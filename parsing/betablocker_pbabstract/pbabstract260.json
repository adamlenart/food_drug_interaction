The significance of its occurrence lies not only in the potentially dangerous and physiologic derangement to patients, but also in the impact it has on the utilization of health care resources. Several clinical observations suggest that the occurrence of atrial fibrillation after bypass surgery has some unique features related to the perioperative circumstances. Numerous therapies, both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic have been tested to prevent this tenacious problem. Its persistence continues to intrigue cardio-thoracic surgeons, cardiologists, anesthesiologists and the insurers alike. In this review we discuss the published literature on postbypass AF, with a special emphasis on pharmacologic prevention.", 
    "17": "In this study, we identify and investigate the role of protein kinase G (PKG) in cells cultured from human prostatic stroma. Cells were used for immunocytochemistry, contractility or K(+) fluorescent imaging studies. All cultured prostatic stromal cells showed PKG immunostaining. Phorbol 12,13 diacetate (PDA, 1 microM) elicited contractions from human-cultured prostatic stromal cells that could be blocked by both the L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker, nifedipine (3 microM), and the protein kinase C inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide (1 microM). The nitric oxide donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP, molar pIC(50) 5.16+/-0.17) and the cGMP-phosphodiesterase inhibitor, zaprinast (50 microM), inhibited PDA (1 microM)-induced contractions. The PKG activator beta-phenyl-1, N(2)-ethenoguanosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (PET-cGMP, molar pIC(50) 6.96 +/- 0.25) also inhibited PDA (1 microM)-induced contractions. Glibenclamide (10 microM) and Rp-8-Br-cGMPS (5 microM), but not iberiotoxin (100 nM) or Rp-cAMP (5 microM), reversed this inhibition. In human-cultured prostatic stromal cells loaded with the K(+) fluorescent indicator, 1,3-Benzenedicarboxylic acid, 4,4'-[1,4,10,13-tetraoxa-7,16-diazacyclooctadecane-7,16-diylbis(5-methoxy-6,2-benzofurandiyl)]bis-, tetrakis [(acetyloxy) methyl] ester (PBFI), PET-cGMP (300 nM) caused a reduction in intracellular K(+) that was blocked by glibenclamide (10 microM) and Rp-8-Br-cGMPS (5 microM), but not by iberiotoxin (100 nM). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that, in human-cultured prostatic stromal cells, PKG inhibits contractility through the activation of K(ATP) channels.", 
    "18": "To study whether nipradilol, which is used as an ophthalmic solution for the treatment of glaucoma, has a cytoprotective effect, we investigated its effect on the apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal in PC12 cells. Nipradilol has alpha1- and beta-adrenoceptor-blocking and nitric oxide (NO)-donating properties. We also investigated the effects of timolol, prazosin and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) on PC12 cell death. Serum withdrawal from PC12 cells resulted in apoptosis, and the survival rate was decreased in a time-dependent manner. The addition of nipradilol to the medium showed a cytoprotective effect on PC12 cell death in a dose-dependent manner, but timolol and prazosin did not. We measured caspase-3 activity to clarify the mechanism of the inhibition of apoptosis in the presence or absence of dithiothreitol (DTT). The caspase-3 activity could be reactivated by DTT. In addition, to investigate the relationship of the cGMP-dependent pathway to the nipradilol-induced cytoprotective effect, we tested the effect of the protein kinase G inhibitor KT5823. KT5823 partially reversed the nipradilol-mediated cytoprotective effect. These results indicate that the cytoprotective effect of nipradilol in PC12 cell death was due to the caspase-3 inhibition mediated by NO-related S-nitrosylation and activation of protein kinase G.", 
    "19": "The aim was to study the effect of intraduodenal capsaicin on interdigestive gastric contractions. Mongrel dogs were equipped with strain-gauge force transducers to measure gastroduodenal motility. The effects of intraduodenal capsaicin with or without pharmacological antagonists on spontaneous and motilin-induced interdigestive gastric contractions and on plasma motilin were studied in dogs with intact stomachs. The effect of intraduodenal capsaicin on gastric contractions was also studied in vagally denervated gastric (Heidenhain) pouch and vagally innervated antral pouch. Intraduodenal capsaicin inhibited spontaneous and motilin-induced gastric contractions. The spontaneous peak in plasma motilin was inhibited by intraduodenal capsaicin. The effect of intraduodenal capsaicin on motilin-induced gastric contractions was not affected by blockade of nitric oxide synthase, or by beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. Administration of alpha-adrenergic blocker inhibited basal interdigestive gastric motility. Intraduodenal capsaicin had no effect on contractions in the Heidenhain pouch but inhibited those in vagally innervated antral pouch. Duodenal afferent fibres stimulated by capsaicin inhibit gastric contractions via a nitric oxide-independent extrinsic neural reflex.", 
    "20": "Autonomic innervation of ciliary smooth muscle is mediated principally by the parasympathetic nervous system and is supplemented by the sympathetic nervous system. Previous drug and nerve stimulation experiments on humans and animals have demonstrated that sympathetic innervation is inhibitory (via beta-2 adrenoceptors), relatively small, slow and augmented by concurrent levels of background parasympathetic activity. These characteristics are pertinent to the sympathetic system having a specific role in our ability to adapt successfully to sustained near vision tasks and, given the clear association between near vision and the onset and development of myopia, to a putative aetiological role in myopia development in pre-disposed individuals. A fifth characteristic, namely the variation between individuals in access to an inhibitory sympathetic facility is therefore of particular interest. A novel method for continuous recording of accommodation, currently employed in a large sample longitudinal study of myopia in young adults, was used following topical instillation of non-selective (timolol) and selective (betaxolol) sympathetic beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Measures of post-task accommodative hysteresis were taken with reference to the time-course of regression of accommodation when open-loop (Difference of Gaussian) conditions were immediately imposed following short (10 s) and long (3 min) duration far (0D) and near (3D above tonic level) tasks viewed through a Badal system. Data confirm earlier informal experimental observations that only one in three individuals are likely to have access to a sympathetic inhibitory facility during sustained near vision.", 
    "21": "Pharmacological intervention with peripheral sympathetic transmission at ciliary smooth muscle neuro-receptor junctions has been used against a background of controlled parasympathetic activity to investigate the characteristics of autonomic control of ocular accommodation.", 
    "22": "A continuously recording infra-red optometer was used to measure accommodation on a group of five visually normal emmetropic subjects under open- and closed-loop conditions. A double-blind protocol between saline, timolol and betaxolol was used to differentiate between the localised action on ciliary smooth muscle and effects induced by changes in stimulus conditions. Data were collected before and 45 min following the instillation of saline, timolol or betaxolol. Open-loop post-task decay was investigated following 3 min sustained near fixation of a stimulus placed 3 D above the subject's pre-task tonic accommodation level. Closed-loop dynamic responses were recorded for each treatment condition while subjects viewed sinusoidally (0.05-0.6 Hz) or stepwise vergence-modulated targets over a 2 D range (2-4 D).", 
    "23": "Open-loop data demonstrate a rapid post-task regression to pre-task tonic accommodation levels for saline and betaxolol control conditions. A slow positive post-task shift was induced by timolol indicating that sympathetic inhibition contributes to accommodative adaptation during sustained near vision. Closed-loop accommodation responses to temporally modulated sinusoidal stimuli showed characteristic features for both saline and betaxolol control conditions. Timolol induced a reduced gain for low- and mid-temporal frequencies (< 0.3 Hz) but did not affect the response at higher temporal frequencies. Response times to stepwise stimuli increased following the instillation of timolol for the near-to-far fixation condition compared with the controls and was related to the period of sustained prior fixation.", 
    "24": "Modulation of accommodation under open- and closed-loop conditions by a non-selective beta-blocker is consistent with the temporal and inhibitory features of sympathetic innervation to ciliary smooth muscle. Although parasympathetic innervation predominates there is evidence to support a role for sympathetic innervation in the control of ocular accommodation.", 
    "25": "In 12 healthy horses, the effects of the beta2-agonist clenbuterol and the glucocorticoid dexamethasone on the lymphocyte beta2-adrenoceptor density and affinity (determined by (-)-[125I]-iodocyanopindolol binding) as well as its responsiveness (assessed by lymphocyte cyclic AMP [cAMP] responses to 10 micromol/l (-)-isoprenaline) were studied. Clenbuterol treatment, 2 x 0.8 microg/kg/day i.v. for 12 days, decreased significantly ICYP binding sites by approximately 30-40%; concomitantly, lymphocyte cAMP response to (-)-isoprenaline was reduced. After withdrawal of clenbuterol, beta2-adrenoceptor density and responsiveness gradually increased, reaching predrug levels after 4 days. The effects of dexamethasone on clenbuterol-induced desensitisation were further investigated. Administration of dexamethasone (1 x 0.1 mg/kg/day, i.v. for 5 days) immediately after clenbuterol withdrawal accelerated beta2-adrenoceptor recovery: only 24 h after administration dexamethasone restored the number of binding sites and cAMP response to (-)-isoprenaline to levels statistically indistinguishable from values before clenbuterol treatment. Three days after dexamethasone administration, lymphocyte beta2-adrenoceptors were further increased about 2-fold the pretreatment values, and this increase declined gradually after dexamethasone withdrawal, reaching baseline values after 4 days. Furthermore, in groups exposed simultaneously to both drugs, dexamethasone completely prevented clenbuterol-induced decrease in lymphocyte beta2-adrenergic receptor density and responsiveness. No significant change was observed in the dissociation constant for ICYP in any of the situations. We conclude that dexamethasone (glucocorticoids) can reverse and prevent Clenbuterol-induced desensitisation (down-regulation) of the lymphocyte beta2-adrenoceptors and therefore, a combined therapy with clenbuterol and dexamethasone may be potentially beneficial in horses suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).", 
    "26": "Adrenergic receptors transduce signals through the G proteins to regulate cardiac function. The catecholamines, via alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) stimulation, may play a role in the development of heart failure. Norepinephrine and isoproterenol can induce cardiac myocyte apoptosis. Studies suggest that alpha-, beta1-, and beta2-adrenergic pathways differentially regulate cardiac myocyte apoptosis. The stimulation of beta1-AR leads to cyclic AMP-dependent apoptosis, whereas that of the beta2-AR elicits concurrent apoptosis and survival signals in cardiac myocytes coupled to Gs protein. Overexpression of alpha1-adrenergic receptors does not induce apoptosis in wild-type mice. In contrast, the heart failure observed in some murine models has to be related to an enhanced beta-AR kinase expression. These recent advances make it possible to understand the beneficial effects of beta-blockers in the treatment of chronic heart failure and provide novel therapeutic modalities through the stimulation of beta2-ARs or the inhibition of beta-AR kinase expression.",

In monkeys, equivalent nipradilol concentration in the periocular tissue around the optic nerve insertion was higher on the ipsilateral side than on the contralateral side (140 +/- 25 ng/g and 42 +/- 10 ng/g, P = 0.022, n = 5). Radioactivity was higher in the periocular tissue behind the equator than around the optic nerve insertion on the ipsilateral side (P = 0.004), but not on the contralateral side. The equivalent nipradilol concentration in the ipsilateral posterior retina-choroid was 636 +/- 92 ng/g, which was significantly higher than that on the contralateral control side (521 +/- 92 ng/g, P < 0.001).", 
    "30": "The ipsilateral increase in ONH blood velocity induced by topical nipradilol in humans was attributed to drug that penetrated locally.

    "31": "This work investigated if methods used to produce a uniformly sampled heart rate variability (HRV) time series significantly change the deterministic signature underlying the dynamics of such signals and some nonlinear measures of HRV. Two methods of preprocessing were used: the convolution of inverse interval function values with a rectangular window and the cubic polynomial interpolation. The HRV time series were obtained from 33 Wistar rats submitted to autonomic blockade protocols and from 17 healthy adults. The analysis of determinism was carried out by the method of surrogate data sets and nonlinear autoregressive moving average modelling and prediction. The scaling exponents alpha, alpha(1) and alpha(2) derived from the detrended fluctuation analysis were calculated from raw HRV time series and respective preprocessed signals. It was shown that the technique of cubic interpolation of HRV time series did not significantly change any nonlinear characteristic studied in this work, while the method of convolution only affected the alpha(1) index. The results suggested that preprocessed time series may be used to study HRV in the field of nonlinear dynamics.", 
    "32": "Partitioning of 15 beta-blockers and structurally related compounds was examined in aqueous dextran-PEG two-phase systems and octanol-buffer systems at pH from 2.0 up to 12.5. The same compounds were examined by gradient RP-HPLC at pH 2.0, 7.4, and 11.0. The differences between the hydrophobic character of the phases in all three systems at different pH values were characterized using a homologous series of dinitrophenyl-amino acids by measuring the free energy of transfer of a methylene group. Estimates of the relative hydrophobicity, N(CH(2)), and lipophilicity, logD, of the compounds obtained by the three techniques employed were compared. The data indicate that while similar pH profiles for a given compound were established by all these techniques, the information provided is different. It is suggested that the combination of the two descriptors, logD and N(CH(2)), may be useful for quantitative structure-activity relationship analysis of the biological activities involving distribution and/or transport of chemical compounds in biological systems.", 
    "33": "In this study, standardized food extracts were screened for their possible inhibitory effect on the P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated efflux of 3H-ciclosporin A (CsA) using the in-vitro Caco-2 model. CsA is commonly used as a substrate for P-gp-related efflux carriers and is characterized by a polarity in transport, the absorptive transport being much lowerthan the secretorytransport (polarityfactor: PF approximately 7). Of the 68 tested, nine extracts showed a decreased efflux of CsA (< 75% of the reference value) and were retained for further experiments on the bidirectional transport of CsA across Caco-2 monolayers. Results of these experiments showed that strawberry, orange, apricot and mint extract exert an inhibitory effect on intestinal P-gp-related functionality (PF < 4.2). The effect of apricot extract was also studied on the bidirectional transport of talinolol, a specific P-gp substrate; inclusion of 1%, v/v, in the apical compartment of Caco-2 monolayers resulted in a significantly reduced polarity in the transport of talinolol (PF reference = 15.5; PF in the presence of apricot extract = 2.5). This study suggests that co-administration of fruit extracts might be a conceptually safe and useful strategy to enhance the intestinal absorption of P-gp substrates. More research is necessary to characterize the impact of this inhibition on P-gp-related efflux mechanisms in other absorption models (in-vitro and in-vivo) and to identify the compounds that are responsible for this inhibitory effect.",

Isolated rabbit Purkinje fibers were superperfused in Tyrode solution with solvent, indapamide (1 x 10 (-4) M, an I(ks) blocker mimicking long QT1), dofetilide (1 x 10 (-9), 1 x 10 (-8) or 1 x 10 (-7) M, an I(kr) blocker mimicking long QT2) or anthopleurin (1 x 10 (-8) M, an inhibitor of the inactivation of the I(Na(+)) current mimicking long QT3) (n=8 per group) for 25 min, and stimulated at 1 Hz for 20 min and at 0.2 Hz for another 5 min. Indapamide did not change APD and triangulation or elicit early afterdepolarizations even in the presence of beta-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol. Dofetilide concentration-dependently prolonged APD(90), increased triangulation and elicited early afterdepolarizations. Anthopleurin markedly increased APD(90) as well as triangulation and elicited early afterdepolarizations. The induction of early afterdepolarizations by dofetilide and anthopleurin was associated with a prolongation of APD(90) or an increase in triangulation, but not with a change in APD(40). Moreover, the degree of the increase in the triangulation was larger than that of APD(90) in long QT2 (dofetilide-induced) and long QT3 (anthopleurin-induced) models in isolated rabbit Purkinje fibers. Our present study indicates that rabbit Purkinje fibers can be used as long QT2 (dofetilide-mimicking) and LQT3 (anthopleurin-mimicking) syndrome models, and confirms that drug-induced long QT1 (indapamide-mimicking) is absent. Our present study also shows the relationship between a prolongation of APD(90) or increase in triangulation and the induction of early afterdepolarizations with dofetilide (I(kr) blocker) and anthopleurin (I(Na) modulator) in isolated rabbit Purkinje fibers.",

The motor-evacuation function of gallbladder was estimated on dynamic ultrasonographic findings of biliary system sorbet. The character of the autonomic regulation was determined on the basis of variability parameters of the heart rhythm. The results of the repeated dynamic ultrasonography of biliary system with sorbet on a background of vegetotropic medications (Atropine, Propranolol, Metoclopramide) have demonstrated that the variability parameters of heart rhythm can be used for an estimation of the autonomic regulation type and can become the basis of vegetotropic pharmacotherapy choice for the patients with chronic non-calculous cholecystitis and biliary dyskinesia.", 
    "56": "The use of beta-blockers reduces angiotensin II levels, but could not adequately suppress aldosterone production. Thus, the combination of a beta-blocker with an aldosterone receptor antagonist could exert additive effects. The effects of metoprolol and spironolactone and their combination on hemodynamics and cardiac remodeling in cardiomyopathic hamsters (CMH) were investigated. The Bio TO-2 dilated strain of CMH was treated orally with metoprolol (10 mg/kg/day), spironolactone (20 mg/kg/day), or both according to a 2 x 2 factorial design (24 animals per group) from 120 days of age and during 120 days. As compared to corresponding untreated groups, metoprolol significantly decreased mean blood pressure (-7%), and metoprolol and spironolactone significantly increased cardiac output (18% and 19%, respectively), mesenteric blood flow (11% and 14%), and femoral blood flow (13% and 17%), and significantly decreased systemic (-24% and -15%), mesenteric (-14% and -13%) and femoral (-19% and -10%) vascular resistances. Metoprolol significantly increased renal blood flow (22%) and significantly decreased renal vascular resistance (-23%). Metoprolol and spironolactone significantly decreased the cavity area of the left ventricle (-21% and -32%, respectively) and the collagen density of the left (-36% and -39%) and right (-38% and -43%) ventricles. Although the combination did not induce stronger effects than each drug alone on the systemic and most regional hemodynamic variables, it did have a stronger effect on the cardiac remodeling (compared to control group: -24%, -34%, and -46% for the left ventricle cavity area, -33%, -35%, and -62% for collagen density in the left ventricle, and -52%, -57%, and -59% for collagen density in the right ventricle, respectively, in the metoprolol, spironolactone, and metoprolol + spironolactone groups). In CMH, metoprolol and spironolactone combined did not improve hemodynamics more than each drug alone, but did exert additive effects on cardiac remodeling.", 
    "57": "A group of 61 men who suffered from myocardial infarction (MI) were divided into two groups: group A (31 patients post MI, one day at intensive care unit (ICU), no beta-blockers, physical therapy according to a seven-day programme) and group B (30 patients post MI, two days at ICU, with beta-blockers, physical therapy according to a seven-day programme). Results from both groups were compared with a control group (C) (38 patients post MI, three days at ICU, physical therapy according to a longer ten-day graded programme). The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of a proposed modified rehabilitation programme in patients after acute MI on the basis of a submaximal stress test performed on a cycle ergometer and to find out which stress test parameters might be used for the selection of an appropriate phase 2 rehabilitation programme. The performed analysis of correlation between exercise and resting parameters showed statistical relevancy with regard to systolic blood pressure in group A. Maximal load (WATs), metabolic cost (METs), maximal heart rate (beats/min), stress-test time (T-test) and time of normalization for the exercise parameters (t(n)) are the parameters of the stress test that should be taken into consideration for appropriate selection of an out-patient (phase 2) rehabilitation programme.",

Adult DBA/2J mice were treated with timolol, pilocarpine, brimonidine, dorzolamide, or NMDA-receptor antagonist memantine. Surviving retinal ganglion cells of treated and control mice were retrogradely labeled with fluorogold and counted after whole mount preparation. In treated mice, only memantine and timolol had significant effects on retinal ganglion cell survival (P<0.0001, analysis of variance). Brimonidine was lethal to these mice, and these retinae were not analyzed further. The DBA/2J mouse represents a promising candidate for further experimentation in ocular hypertension.", 
    "59": "The synthesis of S-(-)-1-(4-(2-ethoxyethoxy)phenoxy)-2-hydroxy-3-(2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethylamino)propane hydrochloride (D140S.HCl 6), a novel short acting beta(1)-specific adrenoceptor antagonist, has been described. The antagonist potency for D140S.HCl 6 has been compared with esmolol, another short acting agent, and other well known beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in isolated rat tissue preparations. The pharmacokinetics of D140S.HCl 6 in 7 day continuous intravenous infusions and 4 weeks intravenous bolus injection studies in conscious rats and dogs have been examined in toxicology studies. The effect on the isoprenaline-induced heart rate increase and the pharmacodynamic half-life of D140S.HCl 6 has been compared with esmolol in a conscious rat model. In addition, the results of a range of toxicological studies are presented. The results indicate that D140S.HCl 6 is a highly specific beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist (pA(2) = 8.15+/-0.22, beta(1)/beta(2) selectivity > 4400). The in vitro studies suggest D140S.HCl is ca. ten times more potent and 60 times more beta(1)-specific than racemic esmolol. Pharmacokinetic non-linearity was seen when given as a 7 day intravenous infusion at toxicological doses above 10 mg kg(-1) h(-1) in the rat and 2.5 mg kg(-1) h(-1) in the dog. Both D140S.HCl 6 and esmolol have very short durations of action after intravenous infusion in the rat (pharmacodynamic half-life is < 15 min for D140S.HCl and 10 min for esmolol). The toxicological tests indicate that D140S.HCl 6 shows no unexpected toxicity and none of the tissue irritancy problems reported for esmolol formulations.", 
    "60": "Analysing specific non-fatal events in isolation may lead to spurious conclusions about efficacy unless the events considered are combined with all-cause mortality. The use of combined endpoints has therefore become widespread, at least in cardiovascular disease trials. Combining all-cause mortality with selected non-fatal events is useful because event-free survival, an important criterion in therapy evaluation, is addressed in this manner. In many clinical trials, symptoms, signs or paraclinical measures (for example, blood pressure, exercise duration, quality of life scores) are used as endpoints. If the patient died before the endpoint was measured, or it was otherwise not possible to perform follow-up assessments as planned, the effect of treatment on these endpoints may be distorted if the patients concerned are ignored in the analysis. Examples are given of how distortion can be avoided by including all patients randomized in an analysis that uses a ranked combined endpoint based both on clinical events and on paraclinical measures. A distinction is made between a pseudo intention-to-treat analysis that disregards study medication status at the time of endpoint assessment but is confined to patients with data, and a true intention-to-treat analysis that takes into account all patients randomized based on a ranked combined endpoint.", 
    "61": "The present study investigated the activation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and the potential role of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) in the brain's response to focal brain ischemia in the permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) model. Phosphorylated ERK p44 and p42 were increased time-dependently and significantly 18- and 28-fold, respectively, at 24-h post-pMCAO. Similarly, IL-1beta protein levels were significantly increased with the peak at 24 h in the lesioned core of the ischemic hemisphere compared to the contralateral side. Previous studies using various stimuli have shown ERK-dependent IL-1 induction. The results from our study suggest that this relation may also exist in vivo in ischemic brain tissue. Based on the progressive nature of IL-1 induction, we hypothetized that inhibition of interleukin-converting enzyme (ICE) could provide an extended time-window for neuroprotection. Therefore, we applied N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD x fmk), an ICE blocker 3 or 6 h after pMCAO. Reductions of infarct volume, however, were not observed. Taken together with previous results, where we showed protective activity of zVAD x fmk when given immediately after pMCAO, we conclude that the time window for zVAD x fmk is less than 3 h.", 
    "62": "Macrophages play an important role in immune and inflammatory responses, largely through secretion of bioactive molecule such as cytokines. While calcium is known to be an important regulator of this process, less is known about the role of other ions and the ion channels that regulate them. We have previously implicated an outwardly rectifying potassium channel (Kor) in this process and for this reason we have investigated the role of potassium (K+) and K+ channels in the regulation of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)and interleukin (IL)-8 production by activated human culture-derived macrophages. The effect of blockade of Kor is to inhibit phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced cytokine production by translational or post-translational mechanisms, an effect that is duplicated by increasing extracellular K+. By contrast, the effects of K+ on LPS-stimulated cells are far more complex and are probably mediated through the change of osmolality and occur largely at the mRNA level. This data directly implicates K+, and its regulation through Kor, in early events following PMA stimulation of these cells.",

In some cases, antagonists to CRF, adrenergic or opiate receptors, or their vehicle were administered prior to the stressors. Levels of LH, T, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and/or corticosterone were measured in serial blood samples.", 
    "65": "All three challenges significantly lowered basal LH and T levels and blunted the T response to hCG, though the magnitude of this inhibition was significantly (p < 0.01) smaller in shocked rats (42%), compared to animals injected with LPS (92%) or turpentine (78%). Shocks, LPS and turpentine all significantly stimulated ACTH and corticosterone release, and the magnitude and time course of these responses were also stressor specific. While turpentine only increased circulating IL-6 concentrations, shocks and LPS both significantly increased circulating TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels, but the effect of shocks was markedly smaller. Pretreatment with propranolol did not restore T responses, while naloxone produced small and inconsistent effects. However, the CRF antagonist Astressin B, which significantly prevented stressor-induced increase in circulating levels of ACTH and corticosterone, partially reversed the inhibitory effect of LPS on hCG-induced T release.", 
    "66": "(1) Both neurogenic and systemic stressors lower basal plasma LH and T levels and blunt the T response to hCG. (2) LPS, whose ability to release ACTH and corticosterone was similar to that of shocks, but caused increases in circulating TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels that were significantly larger than those due to the other stressors, was the most potent inhibitor of the T response to hCG. (3) Neither beta-adrenergic nor opiate receptors play a major role in the ability of the stressors we used to inhibit T release.", 
    "67": "We examined the expression and function of beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) subtypes in both isolated primary rat microglia and a rat microglial cell line. RT-PCR analyses revealed that microglia expressed beta(1)- and beta(2)-ARs but not beta(3)-ARs, whereas rat primary peritoneal macrophages expressed only beta(2)-ARs. Stimulation of beta-ARs on microglia by norepinephrine (NE) resulted in an increase in the level of intracellular cAMP and the subsequent expression of interleukin-1beta mRNA. These effects were prevented by propranolol. Similar results were obtained with other selective beta(1)-AR agonists and antagonists. beta(2)-ARs on microglia were also functional. It is possible that noradrenergic innervations participate in the control of microglial functions via beta(1)-ARs on microglia in the brain, because NE has high affinity for beta(1)- and beta(3)-ARs but little or no affinity for beta(2)-ARs. It seems physiologically significant that microglia can be controlled by NE, which predominates over epinephrine in the brain, whereas macrophages in peripheral tissues can be controlled by epinephrine, which is at higher levels in peripheral tissues.",

    "72": "Betaxolol is a beta-adrenergic blocker but its neuroprotective action is generally thought to be due to its calcium channel blocking properties. In this study, we investigated neuronal cell damage and changes in the expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) immunoreactivity in the ischemic retina and its relationship to the neuroprotection of betaxolol treatment after ischemic injury. Using the retina after ischemia, the expression of nNOS was studied by immunocytochemistry. In control retinas, two types of amacrine cells and a class of displaced amacrine cells were nNOS-labeled. After ischemia/reperfusion, the number of nNOS immunoreactive cells increased in both the ganglion cell layer and the inner nuclear layer compared to the control retinas. However, when experiments were carried out on animals that had been treated with betaxolol twice daily after ischemia/reperfusion, the number of nNOS immunoreactive cells decreased compared to the untreated ischemic retinas. These results suggest that an increase in nNOS expression could be associated with the degenerative changes in the ischemic retina, and that betaxolol treatment appears to play a role in protecting retinal tissue from ischemic damage.",

This study focuses on the use of the Caco-2 system containing solubilizers to predict the absorption of poorly water-soluble drugs in humans. First, the effects of propylene glycol (PG), hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD), polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400), and Tween 80 on the viability (transepithelial electrical resistance, TEER) of 3-day cultured Caco-2 monolayers were evaluated. These solubilizers, even at the low concentration, reduce the viability of Caco-2 monolayers; these results indicate the impossibility for 3-day cultured Caco-2 monolayers to be used for this test. Next, the effects of PG, Tween 80, PEG 400, HP-beta-CD, Pluronic F-68 (Pluronic), HCO-40, sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), Gelucire 44/14, Transcutol P, and extract gall powder on the viability of 21-day cultured Caco-2 monolayers and the apparent permeability (P(app)) of propranolol (PPL), Nadolol (NDL), and FITC-dextran 4000 (FD-4) were investigated. Five different solubilizing methods (20% PG, 5% Tween 80, 5% PEG 400, 5% HP-beta-CD, and 5% Tween 80+5% PEG 400) did not affect the viability of 21-day cultured Caco-2 monolayers. Furthermore, the P(app) values of the three compounds containing these solubilizers did not differ from the values for control formulations (without solubilizers). These results clearly suggest that the use of PG, Tween 80, PEG 400, or HP-beta-CD as solubilizing excipients and the testing of these formulations on 21-day cultured Caco-2 monolayers can predict intestinal absorption of poorly water-soluble drugs in humans.",

Furthermore, the clearance profiles of NDP enantiomers were examined in an enzyme reaction system of rat liver mitochondria without NAD+. The amounts of S-NDP remaining in the incubation medium were similar to those of R-NDP, suggesting that monoamine oxidase (MAO) catalyzes the deamination of NDP to the aldehyde intermediate, but fails to deaminate enantioselectively S-NDP or R-NDP. Cyanamide, a potent inhibitor of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), markedly decreased the formation of NLA from racemic NDP in the enzyme reaction system of rat liver mitochondria with NAD+. When rat liver cytosol and microsomes were added to this enzyme reaction system, no significant alterations were observed in the amount of NLA generated from racemic NDP. We concluded that MAO deaminates NDP to an aldehyde intermediate, and that mitochondrial ALDH subsequently catalyzes the enantioselective metabolism of the aldehyde intermediate to NLA in rat liver.",

Whereas pancreatic beta-cells normally respond to glucose challenge by rapid insulin release (first phase insulin secretion), there is a loss of this acute response in virtually all of the type 2 diabetes patients with significant fasting hyperglycemia. Our previous studies demonstrated that irreversible intracellular accumulation of a glucose metabolite, protein O-linked N-acetylglucosamine modification (O-GlcNAc), is associated with pancreatic beta-cell apoptosis. In the present study, we show that streptozotocin (STZ), a non-competitive chemical blocker of O-GlcNAcase, induces an insulin secretory defect in isolated rat islet cells. In contrast, transgenic mice with down-regulated glucose to glucosamine metabolism in beta-cells exhibited an enhanced insulin secretion capacity. Interestingly, the STZ blockade of O-GlcNAcase activity is also associated with a growth hormone secretory defect and impairment of intracellular secretory vesicle trafficking. These results provide evidence for the roles of O-GlcNAc in the insulin secretion and possible involvement of O-GlcNAc in general glucose-regulated hormone secretion pathways.",

The combined therapy also synergistically inhibited the accumulation of interstitial matrix components, such as fibronectin and collagen I, and suppressed renal expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and its type I receptor. In vitro studies revealed that AngII by itself did not induce alpha SMA, but it drastically potentiated TGF-beta1-initiated alpha SMA expression in tubular epithelial cells. Furthermore, HGF abrogated de novo alpha SMA expression induced by TGF-beta1 plus AngII. These results suggest that many factors are implicated in the pathogenesis of renal interstitial fibrosis; therefore, a combined therapy aimed at simultaneously targeting multiple pathologic pathways may be necessary for halting the progression of chronic renal diseases. These findings may provide the basis for designing future therapeutic regimens for blocking progressive renal fibrosis in patients.", 
    "105": "Studies have suggested a pivotal role for free sulfhydryls in platelet integrin function, and enzyme-mediated reduction of disulfide bonds on platelets has been implicated. The platelet fibrinogen receptor alpha(IIb)beta(3) is the best-studied platelet integrin and serves as a model system for studying the structure-function relation in this family of adhesion receptors. The demonstration of free sulfhydryls on the exofacial domain of purified alpha(IIb)beta(3), specifically in its activated conformation, prompted us to explore the potential for activation-dependent, enzymatically catalyzed thiol expression on intact platelets and the possible role of surface-associated protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) in alpha(IIb)beta(3) ligation. Using the membrane-impermeant sulfhydryl blocker para-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonate, the inhibitor of disulfide exchange bacitracin, and the monoclonal anti-PDI antibody RL90, we examined fibrinogen binding to alpha(IIb)beta(3) as well as ligation-induced allosteric changes in the conformation of alpha(IIb)beta(3). We sought to distinguish the possible involvement of disulfide exchange in agonist-induced platelet stimulation from its role in integrin ligation. Analysis of the role of free thiols in platelet aggregation suggested a thiol-independent initial ligation followed by a thiol-dependent stabilization of binding. Flow cytometric analysis showed that sustained binding of fibrinogen, as well as expression of ligand-induced binding site epitopes and ligand-bound conformation, depended on free thiols and disulfide exchange. Expression of P-selectin was minimally affected, even with complete inhibition of alpha(IIb)beta(3) function. These data indicate that although agonist-induced platelet stimulation is independent of ecto-sulfhydryls, engagement of integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) on the intact platelet depends totally on their enzymatically catalyzed surface expression.",

    "110": "1 It has recently been reported that CGP 12177 can act as an agonist at a novel secondary site within the human beta(1)-adrenoceptor. The aim of this study was to undertake a detailed pharmacological study of the effects of CGP 12177 on the human beta(2)-adrenoceptor. 2 CGP 12177 acted as a potent partial agonist of (3)H-cyclic AMP accumulation (log EC(50)-8.90+/-0.06) and CRE-mediated reporter gene transcription (log EC(50)-9.66+/-0.04) in CHO-K1 cells expressing the human beta(2)-adrenoceptor. These CGP-induced responses were antagonized by the beta(2)-selective antagonist ICI 118551 (apparent log K(D) values of -8.84+/-0.15 and -9.51+/-0.02 for the cyclic AMP and reporter gene responses respectively). 3 CGP 12177 was also able to antagonize both cyclic AMP and reporter gene responses to more efficacious beta(2)-agonists with similar log K(D) values (e.g. -9.57+/-0.15 and -10.04+/-0.096 respectively with salbutamol as agonist). 4 (3)H-CGP 12177 binding to beta(2)-adrenoceptors in intact CHO-beta(2) cells yielded a log K(D) value of -9.84+/-0.06, but indicated that the ligand dissociates very slowly from the receptor (t(1/2) for dissociation=65 min). However, studies with a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-tagged beta(2)-adrenoceptor indicated that CGP 12177 does not stimulate beta(2)-adrenoceptor internalization. 5 This study demonstrates that CGP 12177 is a high affinity partial agonist of both cAMP accumulation and CRE-mediated gene transcription at the human beta(2)-adrenoceptor. It provides no evidence that CGP 12177 can discriminate a secondary site on the beta(2)-adrenoceptor analogous to that observed for the human beta(1)-adrenoceptor. However, despite its very weak actions on cAMP accumulation, the potent agonist effects of CGP 12177 on CRE-mediated gene transcription at the human beta(2)-adrenoceptor, coupled with its long duration of action, offers a potential lead for drug development for the treatment of chronic inflammatory airway diseases.", 
    "111": "To date, blood-pressure lowering has been the main therapeutic objective in patients with arterial hypertension, regardless of the drug used, except for drugs selected for accompanying conditions. The LIFE study, carried out in 9,193 high-risk hypertensive patients (with ECG criteria of left ventricular hypertrophy), has shown that a therapeutic regimen based on losartan combined with a thiazide was accompanied by a significant reduction in the risk of cardiovascular complications in more than 90% of patients compared with atenolol and a thiazide over a mean follow-up period of 4.8 years. The incidence of the primary endpoints (cardiovascular death, stroke, and myocardial infarction) was 11% in the losartan group and 13% in the atenolol group (13% relative risk reduction, p = 0.021). Losartan therapy was associated with more benefits in stroke risk reduction and in the development of new cases of diabetes. In the analysis of the subgroup of 1,195 patients with hypertension and diabetes included in the LIFE study, losartan had a special prognostic benefit. One of the cardiovascular events included as a primary endpoint was observed in 18% of the losartan-treated patients and in 23% of the atenolol-treated patients (24% relative risk reduction, p = 0.031). The LIFE trial showed that losartan produced better cardiovascular protection than atenolol, a similar blood pressure reduction, and was better tolerated. This drug seems to confer extra cardiovascular protection in addition to reducing blood pressure.",

Male rats (Wistar) were divided into four groups (n = 7). Three groups of rats were treated in single oral daily doses of 45 mg cyclosporine A/kg body weight to cause cyclosporine nephropathy. Two of the treated groups were then medicated either with carvedilol or BL-443 in single daily doses of 10 mg/kg b.w., and 1 ml doses of saline were given daily i.p. to the third group of rats. Animals were treated and medicated for 17 days. The rats of intact group had no treatment and medication. L-lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes LD(1-4) in the kidney extracts were determined by polyacrylamide gel clectrophoresis. Significant differences of LD(1-4) pattern in kidneys between intact rats and each of the three groups of rats with cyclosporine nephropathy were found by F-test and t-test (p < 0.05). Treatment with cyclosporine A affected the LD(1-4) pattern in kidneys. On the other hand, no significant differences of LD(1-4) pattern in kidneys between rats with non-treated cyclosporine nephropathy and rats with cyclosporine nephropathy medicated with carvedilol or BL-443 were found.",

Although their potencies were different, KAD-1229, glibenclamide, nateglinide, and repaglinide all concentration-dependently and significantly induced insulin release from these cells. Further, each agent displaced the binding of 3H-glibenclamide to the cell membrane and inhibited 86Rb+ efflux from the cells. These results indicate that KAD-1229, glibenclamide, nateglinide, and repaglinide each exert their insulinotropic effect by binding to the glibenclamide binding sites (sulfonylurea receptors) on pancreatic beta-cells and closing K+ channels. Diazoxide, a K+ channel opener, and nitrendipine, a Ca2+ blocker, suppressed the insulin release induced by KAD-1229 or glibenclamide. These results demonstrate that the insulinotropic actions of KAD-1229 and glibenclamide involve similar underlying pathways.", 
    "121": "Arterial hypertension and diabetes are potent independent risk factors for cardiovascular, cerebral, renal and peripheral (atherosclerotic) vascular disease. The prevalence of hypertension in diabetic individuals is approximately twice that in the non-diabetic population. Diabetic individuals with hypertension have a greater risk of macrovascular and microvascular disease than normotensive diabetic individuals. Hypertension is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in diabetes, and should be recognized and treated early. Type 2 diabetes and hypertension share certain risk factors such as overweight, visceral obesity, and possibly insulin resistance. Life-style modifications (weight reduction, exercise, limitation of daily alcohol intake, stop smoking) are the foundation of hypertension and diabetes management as the definitive treatment or adjunctive to pharmacological therapy. Additional pharmacological therapy should be initiated when life-style modifications are unsuccessful or hypertension is too severe at the time of diagnosis. All classes of antihypertensive drugs are effective in controlling blood pressure in diabetic patients. For single-agent therapy, ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blocker, beta-blockers, and diuretics can be recommended. Because of concerns about the lower effectiveness of calcium channel blockers in decreasing coronary events and heart failure and in reducing progression of renal disease in diabetes, it is recommended to use these agents as second-line drugs for patients who cannot tolerate the other preferred classes or who require additional agents to achieve the target blood pressure. The choice depends on the patients specific treatment indications since each of these drugs have potential advantages and disadvantages. In patients with microalbuminuria or clinical nephropathy, both ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are considered first line therapy for the prevention of and progression of nephropathy. Since treatment is usually life-long, cost effectiveness should be included in treatment evaluation.",

    "126": "A new HPLC method was developed using a chiral column to efficiently separate four 1\"-hydroxybufuralol (1\"-OH-BF) diastereomers that are major metabolites of bufuralol (BF). Employing this method, we examined diastereomer selectivity in the formation of 1\"-OH-BF from BF racemate or enantiomers in four individual samples of human liver microsomes. Three different human liver microsomes showed a selectivity of 1\"R-OH < 1\"S-OH for BF enantiomers, which was similar to that of recombinant CYP2D6 expressed in insect cell microsomes, whereas one human liver microsomal fraction yielded a selectivity of 1\"R-OH > 1\"S-OH for BF enantiomers, which was similar to those of recombinant CYP2C19 expressed in insect cell microsomes. Recombinant CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 showed a selectivity similar to that of CYP2D6, but their BF 1\"-hydroxylase activities were much lower than those of CYP2D6. In inhibition studies, quinidine, a known CYP2D6 inhibitor, markedly inhibited BF 1\"-hydroxylation in the fractions of human liver microsomes that showed the CYP2D6-type selectivity. Furthermore, omeprazole, a known CYP2C19 inhibitor, efficiently suppressed the formation of 1\"-OH-BF diastereomers from BF in the microsomal fraction that showed the CYP2C19-type selectivity. From these results, we concluded that the diastereomer selectivity in the formation of 1\"-OH-BF from BF differs between CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, both of which can be determinant enzymes in the diastereoselective 1\"-hydroxylation of BF in human liver microsomes.", 
    "127": "Previous studies suggesting that norepinephrine is directly trophic for the vascular wall have been confounded by concomitant hemodynamic disturbances. Herein, a microcatheter connected to an osmotic minipump was implanted adjacent to the rat carotid for 2-wk perivascular suffusion of agents at systemic levels ~1,000 times below the threshold for altering arterial pressure. Norepinephrine decreased lumen and adventitial areas and circumference by 10, 14, and 5%, respectively (all P < 0.05); a nonsubtype-specific alpha(1)-adrenoceptor (AR) antagonist had no effect. When begun at the time of balloon injury, 2-wk norepinephrine increased lumen loss by 45%, increased neointimal area by 64% and collagen content by 33%, and reduced vessel circumference by 5% (all P < 0.05). alpha(1)-AR antagonists decreased neointimal area by 33% (all P < 0.05). alpha(1)A-AR antagonist reduced lumen loss by 70%, neointimal area by 54%, circumference decline by 84%, and adventitial thickening by 87% (all P < 0.05), whereas alpha(1B)-, alpha(1D)-, alpha(2)- and beta-AR antagonists were without effect.

Several studies have shown that inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis decreases the heart rate. In the present study, we investigated the effect of a single bolus administration of L-NAME on blood pressure and heart rate monitored for one hour in anesthetized rats and the influence of vagotomy and beta1-receptor blocker metoprolol on the L-NAME induced bradycardia. After L-NAME treatment, the blood pressure rose immediately after the injection of the drug (peak response in the third minute: +24%, p<0.001) and fell to the control level in the 20th minute. The heart rate decreased immediately after L-NAME administration, the lowest value being reached in the 10th minute (-14%, p<0.001). However, bradycardia was sustained even after the blood pressure had returned to the control level. Bilateral vagotomy failed to influence the negative chronotropic effect of L-NAME, but bradycardia was completely abolished by metoprolol pretreatment. We concluded that the bradycardia evoked by L-NAME is mainly due to the withdrawal of sympathetic tone upon the heart rate. However, the cause of sustained bradycardia after normalization of blood pressure cannot be elucidated.",

Carvedilol is a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with additional alpha 1-receptor-blocking properties. Furthermore, it has additional antioxidative and antiproliferative effects. Bisoprolol and metoprolol are beta 1-selective beta blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Based on the results of the US carvedilol trials, the CIBIS-II trial, the MERIT-HF study and the COPERNICUS study, it has been shown that beta blocker therapy can improve the prognosis of patients with compensated heart failure (NYHA II and III) and carvedilol can improve prognosis in severe heart failure (stage IV). Induction of therapy must be performed using very low doses, that can be increased in 2- to 3-week intervals. Drug dosages should be increased as much as possible. Besides a better prognosis, clinical symptoms and left ventricular ejection fraction can be expected to improve. The final effect can be expected only after months up to 1 year. Therapy should continue lifelong.",

ACE-inhibitors have become the mainstay of heart failure therapy. In addition, beta blocker evolved to be effective in improving survival in this disease. Recently, the COPERNICUS study established the efficacy of carvedilol in severe heart failure and extended the benefits of this drug first observed in patients with mild and moderate symptoms to those with advanced disease. In this study, carvedilol resulted in a significant reduction of all-cause mortality and combined mortality and hospitalization, the frequency of hospitalizations, the risk of repeated hospitalizations, the number of days in hospital, the average duration of each admission and the utilization of treatments and procedures for heart failure. Carvedilol was well tolerated, improved the sense of well-being, was associated with a lower risk of a serious adverse event, particularly one related to the progression of heart failure and fewer patients requiring withdrawal of treatment for an adverse event. These favourable results were equally seen in all subgroups. Carvedilol treatment was even cost-effective in severe disease. Therefore, this new therapeutic option should be available to all patients with symptomatic systolic heart failure.",

Despite this evidence, the use of beta blockers in the post-MI setting is far from uniform and now lags considerably behind the routine use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) in this clinical setting. Given the major advances in the management of myocardial infarction and its sequelae that have occurred in the last two decades (including the use of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty [PTCA], thrombolysis, aspirin, ACEIs, and statins), there was clearly a need to revisit the issue of beta blocker therapy in patients with beta blockers in the setting of post-MI heart failure. For all these reasons, the CAPRICORN trial of carvedilol in post-MI left ventricular dysfunction was an important and eagerly awaited trial, which could show that carvedilol treatment post-MI on top of the so-called modern post-MI therapy reduces mortality. Further studies have to show whether this results can be repeated with other beta blockers.",

Another important aspect is the intrinsic-sympathomimetic activity of some compounds (e.g., pindolol, oxprenolol).",

Only recently, interest has been raised because of their application in a hitherto forbidden indication, namely heart failure.

Hypertension, atrial fibrillation and heart failure are often associated diseases as hypertension is a risk factor for both other diseases.", 
    "142": "Several systemic factors have been shown to contribute to the acceleration of large vessel atheroma. Correction of these factors leads to a reduction in the progression of plaque formation and associated arterial wall thickness. Atheroma remains, however, a focal disease, developing at characteristic sites within the arterial tree. These sites are typically at areas of vessel branching or marked curvature, and correspond to regions of high tensile stress and low sheer stress, leading to the hypothesis that local haemodynamic factors and vessel wall mechanics potentiate the focal development of atheroma. Current assessment of vascular haemodynamics suffers from an inability to handle complex flow, and does not allow accurate determination of locally varying flow, and shear stress patterns. The application of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) flow simulation techniques to ultrasound and local pressure data, however, allows a comprehensive, non-invasive appraisal of haemodynamic flow parameters to be performed. The Candesartan cilexetil and Atenolol Carotid Haemodynamic Endpoint Trial (CACHET) study compares the effects of two antihypertensive regimens, one b-blocker-based, the other angiotensin receptor blocker based, on carotid intima-media thickness. The collection of ultrasound and pressure data on each subject provides a unique opportunity to apply these data to the CFD model to study the effects of these antihypertensive regimens on local fluid dynamics. This will lead to a greater understanding of the relationship of these factors to atheroma formation and regression.",

Pharmacological treatment with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta blockers improve survival and reduce hospitalization in these patients. Inspite of these therapies, morbidity and mortality remains problematic. Possibly phenomena like the genetic induced Angiotensin-II-escape are responsible for the individual response in patients. Regarding their different pharmacological effects the new group of Angiotensin-II type 1 receptor (AT1) blockers seem to be promising for the treatment of heart failure. In trials like ELITE 1, ELITE 2 and Val-HeFT it could be demonstrated that AT1-blockers and ACE-inhibitors have a comparable effect in improving survival of heart failure patients. In the Val-HeFT study the combination of an ACE-inhibitor and an AT1-blocker reduce hospitalization and improve quality of life of heart failure patients compared with single treatment using an ACE-inhibitor or AT1-blocker. Mortality showed no significant difference. Before a final assessment of the combination treatment with ACE-inhibitors and AT1- blockers in heart failure patients we need more studies like the present CHARM-study.",

The standard-therapy consists of diuretics, ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers and can be supplemented by cardiac glycosides, if heart failure worsens. Cardiac glycosides are also administered if tachycardic arrhythmias occur. Aldosterone-antagonists are combined with standard therapy in NYHA III - IV to counteract cardiac remodelling. AT1-antagonists are indicated when ACE-inhibitors are contraindicated or cannot be administered because of side-effects. Combination with ACE-inhibitors and AT1-antagonists may be of benefit for the patient since morbidity and hospitalization decrease.", 
    "156": "The L-type Ca2+ current (I(Ca,L)) plays an important role in the regulation of cardiac contractility. However, there is little data with regard to the significance of the I(Ca,L)-independent mechanism of beta-adrenoceptor mediated positive inotropy. The effects of isoproterenol (ISO) on I(Ca,L) and contractility in the presence of Ca2+ channel blockers (nifedipine, verapamil) were examined in adult mouse ventricular myocytes. ISO increased contractility over the level before the administration of Ca2+ channel blocker, although it had a very limited effect on I(Ca,L). The positive inotropy of ISO disappeared after administration of Ni2+, an inhibitor of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger. The addition of ISO after nifedipine pretreatment also increased the [Ca2+]i transient over the control level and the application of Ni2+ or KB-R7943, a selective Na+-Ca2+ exchange inhibitor (reverse mode), abolished the increase in [Ca2+]i transient. Therefore, an I(Ca,L)-independent mechanism plays a significant role in beta-adrenoceptor mediated positive inotropy. The Na+-Ca2+ exchanger is necessary for the development of this action.", 
    "157": "Cyclosporin is a powerful stimulator of oxidative stress signaling, leading to TGFbeta production, NO degradation, endothelial dysfunction, hypertension and post-transplant nephropathy. Carvedilol, alpha1-beta-blocker with strong antioxidant activity, may interfere with this chain of events. Therefore, we measured monocyte ecNOS, TGFbeta and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) mRNA level and plasma nitrite/nitrate, 3-nitrotyrosine, an estimate of peroxynitrite, and total plasma antioxidant power in kidney-transplanted patients with post-transplant hypertension, before and after treatment with carvedilol, 25 - 50 mg o.d. orally for 4 months (n = 15). The dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker nifedipine (n = 10) was used as comparator antihypertensive drug. Blood pressure fell to a similar extent with both drugs. Carvedilol increased plasma antioxidant power and HO-1 mRNA and reduced 3-nitrotyrosine and TGFbeta mRNA levels, while the same was not observed with nifedipine. Monocyte ec NOS mRNA levels and plasma nitrite/nitrate were higher in the patients than in a normotensive healthy control group and were unaffected by either treatment. In conclusion, carvedilol reduces the oxidative stress and corrects the altered cellular signaling mediated by oxidative stress in CsA-induced post-transplant hypertension. Therefore, it may prevent long-term complications, such as endothelial dysfunction, fibrogenesis and post-transplant nephropathy by decreasing NO degradation and production of TGFbeta, a key fibrogenic cytokine, and by activating HO-1 production.",

Hydrogels were prepared by dissolution of ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA, 10 mM) in HEMA with or without methacrylic acid (MAA) or methyl methacrylate (MMA; 100-400 mM) and with or without timolol maleate (10 mg/mL), initiation of polymerization by addition of 2,2'-azo-bis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN, 10 mM), injection in molds, and curing in an oven at 50-70 degrees C. Unreacted reagents were removed by boiling. The dry hydrogels were clear and fully polymerized with smooth, poreless surfaces and presented optimal mechanical properties. The hydrogels were then characterized by determination of their swelling and timolol release kinetics in 0.9% NaCl, phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and artificial lacrimal fluid, and of the timolol loading capacity of both nonimprinted hydrogels and de-timololized imprinted hydrogels at various pHs. Both water uptake and timolol release exhibited Fickian kinetics, except in the case of hydrogels made with 400 mM MAA. Timolol diffusion into 0.9% NaCl from HEMA or HEMA/MMA was slow; release from HEMA/MAA into phosphate buffer or lacrimal fluid was faster and increased with the MAA content of the polymer. Timolol loading was significant for HEMA/MAA hydrogels (imprinted or not) at pH 5.5-7.5, and specially for imprinted hydrogels containing 100 mM MAA, which absorb 12 mg timolol/g dry hydrogel. The results indicate that the incorporation of MAA as comonomer increases the timolol loading capacity to therapeutically useful levels while retaining appropriate release characteristics.",

None of these agents had an effect on the amplitude of the ciliary muscle twitch contraction evoked by electrical field stimulation.",

Further, these agents had no effect on the contraction evoked by field stimulation, which indicates that the drugs have no presynaptic effects. These results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that drugs that increase uveoscleral outflow relax the ciliary muscle with a consequent increase in uveoscleral outflow. Further investigation of the role of ciliary muscle contractility on uveoscleral outflow is warranted.",

Either N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), the inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthase, or charybdotoxin, the blocker of Ca(2+)-activated K+ (K(Ca)) channels, partially attenuated the infarct size-limiting effect, and both of them completely abolished the effect. The incidence of ventricular fibrillation was also less in the raloxifene group than in the control group (11% vs. 44%, p < 0.05). Activity of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase increased with 15-min ischemia, and raloxifene pretreatment inhibited the activity.

However, betablockers may also make a patient with heart failure worse, especially when treatment begins and there is reluctance to use betablockade therapy. Complications can generally be avoided by starting with extremely low doses and increasing the dose very slowly.

Effectiveness, as assessed by intraocular pressure, local and general tolerance of the treatment, and the quality of life of the patients included in the study, was compared for these two eye drops. This multicenter and prospective study, performed by 450 ophthalmologists, included 807 adults presenting with glaucoma or ocular hypertony over 8 months. After a poorly tolerated beta-blocker treatment, which had started at least 6 months before, these patients received brimonidine over 8 weeks. At 3 successive visits, intraocular pressure, biomicroscopic examination results, and visual acuity were recorded. A quality-of-life questionnaire evaluating breathlessness, fatigue, depressive mood, loss of appetite, and satisfaction with the treatment was also given to patients. In the 731 patients observed in the study, the analysis concluded a statistically significant decrease in intraocular pressure (-2.5mmHg) and in the cardiovascular parameters during brimonidine treatment: blood pressure was reduced by 3mmHg and 1.1mmHg for systolic and diastolic pressure, respectively. The heart rate rose by 1.7 beats/min. The quality-of-life questionnaire revealed less breathlessness (-26%), fatigue (-24.9%), depressive mood (-19.3%), and better appetite (+8.2%). The feeling of satisfaction with the brimonidine treatment was significantly improved for 95 patients. However, 12% of all patients stopped their treatment because of adverse effects. Brimonidine improved the glaucomatous patients' quality of life, at least in some areas. Improved intraocular pressure could at least in part result from better compliance with the treatment.

    "184": "Catecholamines are released in high levels after hemorrhage or endotoxemia and have been shown to modulate immune function, including cellular release of inflammatory mediators. In the present experiments, we examined the effects of endogenous and exogenous catecholamines on neutrophil accumulation and activation in the lungs using pretreatment with alpha- or beta-antagonists or alpha-adrenergic agonists before hemorrhage or endotoxemia. These studies showed that alpha-, but not beta-adrenergic stimuli, modulated the severity of acute lung injury after hemorrhage or endotoxemia, and alpha-adrenergic stimuli was proinflammatory after hemorrhage but anti-inflammatory after endotoxemia. The observed alpha-adrenergic effects on lung neutrophil activation appeared to involve primarily the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway at the upstream kinase Raf, but not Ras. Although p38 and protein kinase A were activated in lung neutrophils after hemorrhage or endotoxemia, these kinases were not affected by alpha- or beta-adrenergic modulation. These results demonstrate that catecholamines have important immunomodulatory effects in vivo that affect intracellular signaling pathways in neutrophils and neutrophil-driven, inflammatory processes such as the development of acute lung injury.", 
    "185": "The objective of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms by which nebivolol, a cardio-selective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, inhibits rat aortic smooth muscle cell (RASMC) proliferation. Nebivolol was compared with DETA-NO and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), two nitric oxide (NO) donor agents, and alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a known inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). All four test agents inhibited RASMC proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner, with nebivolol being the most potent (IC(50) = 4.5 microM), whereas atenolol, another relatively selective beta(1)-blocker, was inactive. DFMO, nebivolol, and DETA-NO interfered with cell proliferation in a cell-density-dependent manner, the lower the cell density the greater the inhibition of cell proliferation. The cytostatic effects of nebivolol and DETA-NO were completely independent of cyclic GMP, as neither ODQ (cytosolic guanylyl cyclase inhibitor) nor zaprinast (cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor) affected the antiproliferative action of nebivolol or DETA-NO. The cytostatic effects of nebivolol, SNAP, and DFMO were largely prevented by the addition of excess putrescine, but not ornithine, to cell cultures. Moreover, nebivolol caused a marked reduction in the intracellular levels of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine. Like DFMO, nebivolol and DETA-NO interfered with the G(1)-phase to S-phase cell cycle transition in RASMC. These observations confirm previous findings that DFMO and NO interfere with RASMC proliferation by inhibiting ODC and polyamine production and provide evidence that nebivolol works by the same mechanism.",

The objective of the present study was to elucidate in more detail the mechanisms by which nebivolol relaxes vascular smooth muscle. In the canine species, nebivolol caused relaxation of isolated precontracted rings of coronary artery and pulmonary artery largely by endothelium-dependent, NO-dependent, and cyclic GMP-dependent mechanisms. Vasorelaxation was inhibited by N(G)-methylarginine, and this inhibition was reversed by addition of excess L-arginine. Moreover, the vasorelaxant responses to nebivolol were markedly inhibited by oxyhemoglobin, methylene blue, and 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-alpha]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), whereas vasorelaxation was enhanced by zaprinast. Rat aortic ring preparations, however, relaxed in response to nebivolol by both endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent mechanisms, both involving NO, and cyclic GMP. Endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasorelaxation were inhibited by oxyhemoglobin, methylene blue, and ODQ. However, only endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation in response to nebivolol was inhibited by N(G)-methylarginine. Additional experiments ruled out other endothelium-independent vasorelaxant mechanisms. In conclusion, the vasodilator responses to nebivolol involve NO and cyclic GMP in both vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells.",
