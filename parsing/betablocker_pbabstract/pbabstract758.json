Blood flow in the circumflex artery was measured in pentobarbital-anesthetized, open-chest dogs. Intracircumflex artery bolus injections of 40 mumol of isomotic KCl produced decreases in coronary vascular resistance ranging from 34% to 48%, depending on the initial resistance of the vascular bed. K+ administration had no effect on heart rate and produced a 4 mm Hg decrease in mean arterial pressure. K+ injection caused a 0.2 vol% increase in coronary sinus O2 content in a preparation in which left common coronary flow was held constant. The magnitude of K+-induced vasodilation was not significantly affected by the administration of propranolol, atropine, phentolamine, or lidocaine. K+-induced vasodilation was attenuated (50%) by ouabain plus lidocaine. Acetylcholine-induced vasodilation was not significantly diminished by ouabain plus lidocaine. We conclude that the mechanism of K+-induced vasodilation does not involve an increase in the metabolic activity of the heart or an interaction between K+ and tissue neural elements. Our data do support the hypothesis that K+-induced vasodilation is at least partly the result of an activation of the electrogenic Na+-K+ transport system of coronary smooth muscle.", 
    "1": "We determined the effects of epinephrine on automaticity and action potential characteristics of right atrial specialized fibers (RAF) from human atria obtained during cardiac surgery. RAF were studied with standard microelectrode techniques during superfusion with Tyrode's solution at 37 degrees C. A biphasic response to epinephrine was seen, rate slowing at low agonist concentrations and increasing at high concentrations. The epinephrine-induced slowing of spontaneous rate was due to a decrease in the slope of phase 4 depolarization. At the high epinephrine concentrations RAF hyperpolarized. The alpha-adrenergic blocker, phentolamine, shifted the dose-response curve upward and to the left and enhanced the hyperpolarization of RAF. The beta blocker, propranolol, shifted the curve to the right and decreased the degree of hyperpolarization. Our study suggests the presence of alpha and beta receptors in RAF. The alpha response consists of a slowing of rate, the beta response of an acceleration of rate and hyperpolarization of RAF.", 
    "2": "The hemodynamic, cardiovascular, and metabolic effects of acute (intravenous) and prolonged (four weeks oral) timolol treatment were assessed in 16 patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension. Fifteen patients completed the outpatient study and ten showed a fall in mean arterial pressure of at least 10 mm Hg. They also demonstrated a significant fall in supine systolic (7%), diastolic (9%), and mean arterial pressure. Hemodynamic evaluation was performed in 13 patients and cardiac index was found to be reduced with both intravenous (20%) and oral timolol (13%). There was no correlation between the decrease in cardiac index and arterial pressure. Calculated total peripheral resistance rose with intravenous timolol and returned toward, but not below, pretreatment values with the oral therapy. Left ventricular ejection rate also fell significantly with intravenous timolol but returned toward pretreatment levels with oral therapy. Plasma renin activity was reduced similarly with both modes of administration and its reduction also did not correlate with the fall in arterial pressure. Plasma volume fell in eight of 13 patients. Reflexive responses to the Valsalva maneuver were considerably modified by both intravenous and oral timolol but responses to 50 degrees upright tilt and handgrip were not. Timolol is an effective oral antihypertensive agent with similar hemodynamic and metabolic effects to propranolol.", 
    "3": "The effect of propranolol on exercise-induced or augmented ventricular ectopy was studied in sixteen male patients, six of whom had documented coronary artery disease. Fifteen patients were exercised after two weeks of oral therapy, fourteen after single oral therapy and eight patients after intravenous therapy. Propranolol dosage was titrated to produce maximal beta-adrenergic blockade. Effective reduction of exercise-induced ventricular ectopy occurred in ten of fifteen patients (P less than 0.001), and in five of six patients with coronary disease (P less than 0.02). Propranolol therapy abolished ventricular couplets in eight of twelve patients and ventricular tachycardia in four of the patients. Single oral and intravenous therapy had similar or greater effects. Plasma propranolol levels following different routes of administration did not correlate with exercise-induced maximal heart rates or percent reduction in ventricular ectopy. When compared to exercise in eleven patients, ambulatory monitoring underestimated the severity, particularly the highest grades, of ventricular ectopy.", 
    "4": "38 psychiatric inpatients with various degrees of sleeping disorders were given L-tryptophane plus oxprenolol or placebo, each for two nights. Self-rating, rating of the nursing staff, tests of attention level and motor performance were the variables of the investigation. The statistical evaluation of the double-blind study shows no significant difference under these specific experimental conditions.", 
    "5": "The effect of salmefamol, a new beta 2-agonist, on pentagastrin-induced gastric acid secretion was studied in conscious gastric fistula dogs. Salmefamol inhibited the acid secretion, an effect which was dose dependent. The volume as well as the acidity was inhibited. Salmefamol caused an increase in the pulse rate. Propranolol prevented the inhibition of acid output as well as the increase in pulse rate. Practolol, a beta 1-adrenoceptor blocker, had no effect on the inhibition of acid secretion but prevented the increase in pulse rate. Dose-response experiments with 6 doses of pentagastrin and 1 dose of salmefamol showed a decrease in calculated maximal response (CMR) and an unchanged D50. It is concluded that salmefamol strongly inhibits pentagastrin-induced acid output in the dog, and the inhibition follows a non-competitive kinetic. The mechanism of gastric secretion probably involves a beta 2-receptor.",

    "7": "The effects of (+/-)-4-(2-[3-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-1-methylpropyl]-amino)-ethyl-pyrocatechol hydrochloride (dobutamine) on myocardial O2 balance were investigated in healthy conscious dogs with experimental AV-block. Dobutamine, injected as a bolus of 3, 6, 10 micrograms/kg, increased myocardial contractility, coronary flow, coronary venous O2 saturation and aortic pressure, while initially decreasing SA-node rate. Following ganglionic blockade the effects of dobutamine on myocardial contractility were unchanged while those on coronary flow and coronary venous O2 saturation were reduced by 30%. Aortic pressure and heart rate showed a dose dependent, long-lasting increase. The effects of dobutamine on heart rate and myocardial contractility could be abolished by beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade with practolol (2 mg/kg) while the effects on coronary flow and myocardial O2 extraction were reduced by 40% after practolol. Following beta 1 + 2 adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol, dobutamine increased aortic pressure and coronary flow while coronary resistance and myocardial oxygen extraction were unaffected.", 
    "8": "Through specific cytoplasmic-nuclear receptors, brain appears as a target tissue for corticosteroids in their affecting neuroendocrine and behavioural activities. 3H-corticosterone (3H-B) uptake in various brain areas of differentially reared mice was studied in order to ascertain possible differences which might be connected to the different patterns of behavioural, neurochemical and stress responses. In 4-day adrenalectomized mice 1-h 3H-B uptake was higher in grouped than in isolated ones. Prlonged social stress in the grouped mice before adrenalectomy remarkably reduced 3H-B uptake. In 4-hour adrenalectomized dominant males, 4-h 3H-B uptake was higher than in submissive ones. All drugs tested (chlorpromazine, fluanisone, morphine, methergoline, naloxone, propranolol) affected 3H-B uptake. Knowledge of the interactions between behavioural manipulations or drugs and brain corticosteroid-receptors can improve the approach to the regulatory mechanisms of the hypothalamo-hypophyso-adrenal axis also in relation with behavioural phenomena.", 
    "9": "Isolated uteri from rats with regular 4-day cycles were incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer and the release of PGF into the medium was measured by radioimmunoassay after extraction of the incubation medium with ethyl acetate at pH 3.0-3.5. PGF was produced from endogenous precursors and accumulated in equal amounts in the medium during two successive 60 min periods on each day of cycle, but the magnitude of the production varied significantly during the cycle, being greatest in estrus. Oxytocin in doses up to 500 mU/ml had no effect on PGF accumulation in the incubation period at any stage of the cycle, while epinephrine (10(-3)) greatly stimulated PGF release from the estrous uterus but had no effect on PGF release from the diestrous uterus. Phentolamine, an alpha-blocking agent, had no effect on the epinephrine-induced release of PGF, while propranolol, a beta-blocking agent, not only prevented in increase in PGF production induced by epinephrine but also reduced the basal release of PGF by the estrous uterus. Since oxytocin contracts and epinephrine relaxes the nonpregnant rat uterus both in vivo and in vitro, it is unlikely that the effects of these two compounds on uterine contractility are mediated by the release of PGF2alpha.", 
    "10": "Bladder and urethral pressure responses to pelvic sympathetic and pudendal nerve stimulation 60 anesthetized cats were studied. Results show that urethral resistance is composed of smooth and skeletal musclar components, which relax with pelvic nerve stimulation. Reciprocal inhibition of the detrusor-external sphincter is a spinal-mediated reflex that can be elicited by pelvic or pudendal nerve stimulation. Urethral smooth muscular pressure loss with pelvic nerve stimulation can be blocked with propranolol, suggesting that beta-receptors are involved in this response.", 
    "11": "Most attempts to quantitate myocardial function rely on morphologic features of complex pressure waveforms to reflect the functional properties of the ventricular myocardium. Relationships between waveform components and the function of the organ generating them were examined in 38 rhesus monkeys by harmonic analysis of left ventricular pressure waveforms. In the basal state, harmonic content was closely correlated (r=0.98) with hemodynamic state, as quantitated by heart rate, systolic and diastolic pressures, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and maximum contractile element velocity. Hemodynamic indices were expressed as significant linear functions of harmonic terms (r=0.71--0.83), in patterns consistent with the principle of superposition. In 20 animals, infusions of dextran, methoxamine, propranolol or ouabain were used to further assess this relationship. Results demonstrated (1) significant correlation between changes in hemodynamic and harmonic parameter (4= 0.99), (2) correlations between each harmonic term and the set of hemodynamic indices such that specific terms varied directly with contractility but not with loading, whereas others correlated significantly only with loading, and (3) that the patterns in these correlations were of such specificity as to permit construction of significant discriminant functions (p less than 0.0001) that accurately characterized the pharmacologically induced hemodynamic change in 85% (56/67) of trials.", 
    "12": "Interstitial plasma-like cells, constantly present in the submaxillary glands, are they endocrine cells or true plasma-cells? They do not show any change in case of hypertrophy of the salivary glands which is observed under isoproterenol repeated administration. In contrary their number increase greatly during the immunologic stimulation by human albumin injections in the Hamster cheek pouches. So, it does appear that they would be true plasma cells involved in immunoglobulins synthesis.", 
    "13": "Sixteen patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and three healthy volunteers were treated with a combination of a long-acting nitrite and a beta-receptor blocking agent. The drug proved effective in diminishing haemodynamic changes after physical and mental stress, respectively. The implications of these findings are discussed in the light of recent knowledge on CHD pathogenetic mechanisms.", 
    "14": "The effect on the exercise tolerance induced by a new selective beta1-receptor antagonist, metoprolol, given by a single administration per os, has been evaluated in 16 patients with stable angina pectoris. The study was a double blind cross-over between metoprolol 100 mg and placebo. Patients were hospitalized for the time required for the performance of the study; every cardioactive drug, except for trinitrine, was stopped 72 hours prior to the study period. Exercise testing was performed two hours after the intake of the drug, in a sitting position on a bicycle ergometer; the workload was increased by 25 Watts increments every two minutes. Compared to placebo, the total workload performed and duration of exercise increased after metoprolol (P less than 0.001), heart rate decreased (P less than 0.001) both in the resting state and during exercise test, systolic blood pressure didn't change in the resting state but decreased during exercise test (P less than 0.01), pressure-rate product, an useful index of changes in myocardial oxygen consumption decreased both in the resting state (P less than 0.001) and during exercise test (P less than 0.001). It is concluded that metoprolol induces a significant increase in exercise tolerance. This is due to a marked reduction in oxygen myocardial consumption resulting by both decreased heart rate and systolic pressure.", 
    "15": "The Authors, using cycle ergometer tests, assess the effectiveness of two Ca-antagonistic drugs, nifedipine and verapamil, administered full strength to patients suffering from typical angina from effort. The true effectiveness of these drugs was tested by comparing the results with those obtained with placebo, isosorbide dinitrate and propranolol. The effect of nifedipine proved statistically significant (p less than 0.01) with respect to the parameters: double product, time of insurgence of angor and time of appearance of electrocardiographic anomalies. Verapamil proved slightly significant (p less than 0.05) only with regard to time of appearance of electrocardiographic anomalies. There follows a brief discussion of the differences between these results. Isosorbide dinitrate and propranolol increase tolerance to effort with respect to placebo treatment. These results are statistically significant on all parameters used.", 
    "16": "In a randomized crossover comparison between acebutolol and methyldopa for the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension in 30 patients, acebutolol, a cardioselective beta-one-adrenergic blocker, at 400 to 800 mg daily was found to be significantly better (p less than 0.002) than 500 to 1000 mg methyldopa daily in reducing both systolic and diastolic blood pressures and pulse rate. Patient compliance with therapy was excellent, and there were no side-effects on acebutolol, whereas patients on methyl-dopa reported a significant number of side-effects (p less than 0.002). The potassium-sparing effect due to acebutolol was significant (p less than 0.005) and this has not been reported before. This may be beneficial in diuretic-induced hypokalaemia in the hypertensive patient.", 
    "17": "Two groups of twenty-five hypertensive patients each were treated with a beta-adrenergic blocking agent (pindolol), either alone or in combination with classical anthihypertensives. In the group under monotherapy a significant lowering of the blood pressure was observed. The effect was, however, not so consistent as in the group under combined therapy. The trial shows the efficacy and safety of pindolol in the treatment of hypertension mainly if applied in combination with a diuretic.", 
    "18": "The influence of Deslanoside C (D), 1.2 mg intravenously on the systolic time intervals (STI) was assessed in 15 individuals with right ventricular pacemakers, who were studied on two occasions, ten days apart. In the first case D was given under basal conditions, and in the second after autonomic blockade (with practolol 20 mg intravenously and atropine 1.5 and 1.0 mg intravenously) at 1 hour's interval. There were similar changes of the STI with digitalis administration both before and after automic blockade. Autonomic blockade is not necessary for full expression of digitalis action on the human heart, as advocated by some authors to be the case in experimental animals.", 
    "19": "The antihypertensive effect of atenolol, a new beta 1 receptor blocking agent, was studied in a double blind non cross-over trial in 40 patients (pts) affected by mild to moderately severe essential hypertension with normal plasma renin activity. After a run-in period (15 days) of placebo treatment pts were assigned to two groups. The first (group A) continued placebo treatment for 30 days, the second (Group B) were given atenolol (ICI 66082) 100 mg daily for 30 days also. Atenolol significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure in recumbent and standing position and heart rate at rest. No significantly changes of the same parameters were observed in group A. Body weight and plasma renin activity was unchanged in both groups. Atenolol treatment never was discharged in order to side effects. These results seem to suggest that atenolol can be an useful drug in the treatment of systemic blood hypertension.", 
    "20": "A comparative trial was carried out in 21 patients on the antihypertensive effect of pindolol given once or twice a day. A change-over design was employed, with two treatment schedules and four treamtnet periods of six weeks each. No statistically significant difference was found in BP lowering effect between one and two daily doses. It is unlikely that a switch from pindolol twice daily to the same amount once daily will crease the BP by more than at most 1.0 mmHg systolic and 2.2 mmHg diastolic, or decrease it by more than 2.7 and 1.0 mmHg, respectively. It is concluded that pindolol given once daily can be recommended.", 
    "21": "The changes in the basic hemdynamic indices and in the phase structure of the cardiac cycle in patients with acute infarction prior to and post treatment with beta-blockers (Obsidan and Trasicor) were studied. Manifested changes in the hemodynamics were established, namly: pulse rate and cardiac flow decrease, the total peripheral resistance grows; veloqcilty of blood flow is slowed down. The preparations used have a negative effect upon the phase structure of left ventricle as well. The authors underline that beta-blockers administration in acute myocardial infarction should be evaluated very carefully and in the presence of clinical signs for cardiac insufficiency, it should be carried out on the background of cardiotonic treatment.", 
    "22": "1. The antihypertensive effects of alpha-methyldopa and metoprolol have been compared in 110 patients (fifty-one males and fifty-nine females) with previously untreated essential hypertension (sixty-eight WHO stage 1 and forty-two WHO stage 2). 2. After 2 weeks of placebo, the patients were randomly allocated to treatment with either of the two drugs: alpha-methyldopa up to 500 mg b.i.d. and metroprolol up to 200 mg b.i.d. for 6 weeks. Periodical clinical, biochemical, haematological, radiological and electrocardiographical measurements were performed. 3. The average reduction in blood pressure produced by the two drugs was comparable. 4. In general, side-effects were few and tolerable: mainly bradycardia in the metoprolol group and dizziness and drowsiness in the alpha-methyldopa group. 5. The plasma renin activity was significantly reduced in the metoprolol but not in the alpha-methyldopa group.", 
    "23": "Three renal patients with transplant kidneys and uncontrolled hypertension were treated with intravenous doses of labetalol. Only minor depressor effects were noted and tachyphylaxis developed in 1 patient. Other parenteral hypotensive agents reduced blood pressure satisfactorily.", 
    "24": "The effects of the association of calcium antagonists (CAI) with a nitroderivate and a betablocker were studied by means of exercise tests in 8 patients with stable effort angina pectoris. According the statistical model of a latin square 4 x 4, the first 4 patients were tested with the following treatments: placebo, oral; nifedipine (N) 10 mg, oral; N + isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) 10 mg oral; N + propranolol (Pr) 40 mg, oral. In the second square verapamil 80 mg oral represented the CAI treatment. Compared to placebo, all the treatments produced a significant increase of exercise duration and total work performed before angina. In both the squares the improvement observed after CAI + ISDN was significantly higher than after administration of CAI alone. In both the squares the association of CAI + Pr determined a little, non significant improvement of exercise duration in respect to CAI alone. EKG positivity was delayed by Pr more than angina appearance: hpwever, also this effect was not significant when compared with administration of CAI alone. By the analysis of the changes of heart rate, maximal arterial pressure, ejection time and triple product at the same level of work, a relevant inhibition of myocardial contractility with the adopted doses of CAI can be excluded; the effect of these drugs seems to be due mainly to a decrease of arterial pressure, and, when associated to ISDN, to decreases of arterial pressure and ejection time.", 
    "25": "Pindolol was given for 12-15 consecutive weeks to 35 patients for the treatment of essential hypertension. Significant blood pressure reductions were achieved in the group of 28 patients who completed the trial, as tested by the Wilcoxon pair test. There was no difference in antihypertensive effect between a three times a day and a twice a day administration schedule. The incidence of side-effects was not affected by the change in dosage or schedule.", 
    "26": "The effect of exercise upon hemodynamic variables was investigated in seven patients with coronary artery disease during an eight-week double blind cross-over study with placebo and with mepindolol-sulfate, a new beta-receptor blocking agent.", 
    "27": "1. The first hemodynamic sign of myocardial ischemia during exercise was an increase of pulmonary capillary pressure in parallel with ST-segment depression in the Ecg. 2. Angina was accompanied by a fall of the stroke volume and an increase of the peripheral resistance. 3. During beta-receptor blockade with mepindolol-sulfate angina was compensated, the unfavourable hemodynamic effects seen during placebo did not occur. 4. No signs of congestive heart failure were found during mepindolol-sulfate-therapy. 5. Mepindolol-sulfate showed a pronounced blood-pressure lowering effect.", 
    "28": "Acebutolol (Sectral) was used successfully in a clinical trial involving thirty-two hypertensive patients. Twenty-three patients received acebutolol at a dosage of 400--800 mg daily as sole treatment and nine patients received concurrent treatment with thiazide diuretics. In both groups of patients there was a substantial fall in diastolic and systolic pressure to levels within the normotensive range. The combination of acebutolol with thiazide diuretics was a particularly effective form of anti-hypertensive treatment where a greater anti-hypertensive effect was required. Acebutolol did not significantly slow the heart rate. The only side-effect was slight pitting oedema of both legs in one patient. Acebutolol appears to be a useful anti-hypertensive in the management of hypertension.", 
    "29": "1. The cardiovascular responses of mianserin hydrochloride and tricyclic antidepressant drugs were investigated using non-invasive methods of cardiac investigation. A study of the interaction of mianserin and antihypertensive drug therapy is reported. 2. In six normal volunteers, mianserin hydrochloride 20 mg was shown to prolong the corrected Q-T interval at 150 min (P less than 0.001). It did not affect heart rate, systolic time intervals or the peak normalized derivative of the apexcardiogram. Amitriptyline 50 mg increased the corrected pre-ejection period interval (PEPI) and the PEP/left ventricular ejection time (LVET) ratio of the systolic time intervals at 150 min (P less than 0.001). Q-T interval was shortened at 90 minutes. 3. In a double-blind patient study, clomipramine increased heart rate, P-R interval, QRS and corrected Q-T interval in one patient at 2 weeks. Mianserin prolonged corrected Q-T interval at 1 week but this returned to the pretreatment time by 2 weeks in two patients. 4. In an open study, mianserin 20 mg three times daily did not antagonize the hypotensive action of propranolol or propranolol and hydrallazine in three patients. 5. In a double-blind study in three patients with desmethylimipramine 25 mg three times daily, mianserin 20 mg three times daily did not antagonize the hypotensive action of either guanethidine or bethanidine.", 
    "30": "The haemodynamic effects of atenolol, a new cardioselective beta-blocking agent, have been studied at rest in 8 patients with coronary artery disease. The drug was administered intravenously in cumulative doses of 0.03, 0.06, and 0.12 mg/kg body weight. A significant decrease in heart rate was associated with a fall in cardiac output. However, this cardiac output fall was not entiely rate dependent, since stroke volume fell significantly both during spontaneous sinus rhythm and when heart rate was maintained constant by atrial pacing. A dose related and significant reduction occurred in left ventricular dP/dt max without significant change in left ventricular filling pressure or mean aortic pressure. Total peripheral resistance at rest rose after atenolol. The haemodynamic findings more closely resemble those which follow intravenous propranolol than those after intravenous practolol in a similar group of patients. These actions of atenolol suggest that it may be a useful agent in the treatment of patients with angina pectoris.", 
    "31": "Atenolol, a cardioselective beta-blocking agent, at dose levels of 0.03, 0.06, and 0.12 mg/kg intravenously, produced prolongation of atrioventricular nodal conduction in 22 patients with suspected coronary artery disease. In a dose of 0.12 mg/kg body weight atenolol produced significant prolongation of sinus cycle length, sinus node recovery time, atrioventricular node conduction, and the effective and functional refractory periods of the atrium and the atrioventricular node. No significant effects were observed on the His Purkinje system or the effective refractory periods of the ventricle. In these actions atenolol closely resembles propranolol. However, because in contrast to propranolol it increases atrial refractoriness, it may have advantages in the treatment of atrial arrhythmias.", 
    "32": "Nine radiolabeled compounds were identified in human urine after administering a single oral dose of 3H-l-bunolol (3 mg) to 5 male volunteers. These compounds represented 54.7% of the dose and 71.4% of the isotope excreted in 3 days. Intact bunolol accounted for 14.7% of the dose and its conjugates totaled an additional 5.0%. The major drug metabolite (28.2% of dose) was dihydrobunolol, a reduction product known to have the same pharmacological activity and potency as bunolol. Dihydrobunolol conjugates amounted to 3.9% of the dose. Two minor acidic metabolites were produced by oxidative cleavage of the bunolol side chain, and another minor metabolite (hydroxydihydrobunolol) resulted from both reductive and oxidative biotransformation. Bunolol metabolism in man showed qualitative and quantitative differences from patterns observed in the rat and dog.", 
    "33": "Urine collected for 24 hr from rats given a single oral dose of 3H-l-bunolol (10 mg/kg) was found to contain only 25.8% of the dose and more than 30 labeled compounds. Nine compounds were identified and quantified as follows: bunolol (0.35% of urinary tritium), bunolol glucuronide (5.12%), bunolol sulfate (0.08%), dihydrobunolol (0.08%), dihydrobunolol glucuronide (0.74%), dihydrobunolol sulfate (0.12%), hydroxydihydrobunolol (0.58%), beta-(5-oxytetralonyl)lactic acid (0.74%), and (5-oxytetralonyl) acetic acid glucuronide (1.12%). The total quantity of identified labeled compounds was only 2.3% of the dose and 8.9% of the urinary radioactivity.", 
    "34": "Effects of hypertonic urea solution on potassium contracture were investigated in a bullfrot ventricular strip. In a medium of three times hypertonic urea, the contracture induced by 100 mM potassium solution was markedly inhibited whereas the twitch contraction was augmented in the hypertonic urea solution. The extent, as well as the time course, of the membrane depolarization produced by high potassium solution was essentially identical in both isotonic and hypertonic conditions. Endogeneous catecholamine does not seem to participate in this inhibition since the treatment with propranolol did not modify the results. Thus, the possibility of the well-known catecholamine-induced inhibition of potassium contracture can be excluded. The myocardial contractility was never suppressed, or even augmented, at this stage of urea perfusion although a prolonged hypertonic urea perfusion gradually suppressed the contractility. It was suggested that hypertonic urea exerts its negative inotropic action on the potassium contracture independently of its positive inotropism on the twitch contraction by accelerating the uptake of the activator calcium ion to some undefined intracellular sites.", 
    "35": "Platelet function was investigated in four normal volunteers, one patient with a mild form of von Willebrand disease, and one with a thrombocytopathy, all taking propranolol. No effect on platelet function attributable to this drug could be demonstrated in any of these subjects. It is suggested that propranolol administered in conventional doses does not impair platelet hemostatic function.", 
    "36": "The interference of placebo effect in the treatment of angina pectoris has been studied in a group of patients with stable angina pectoris, selected on the basis of normal electrocardiogram at rest and a pathologic ergometric electrocardiographic test. It was found that the patients could be divided, according to the results of the exercise test, into two groups: placebo responders and place-bo-non-responders. The anti-anginal effect of beta-blocking agents has been clearly demonstrated only in the placebo-non-responders group. No statistically significant effect of beta-blocking agents was observed in the placebo-responders group. This result shows that it is necessary, in double blind trials, at first to separate placebo-responders from placebo-non responders. Otherwise the correct evaluation of a drug can be modified by the placebo-responders group.", 
    "37": "Predictors for operative mortality (OM) were studied in 172 consecutive patients (pts) undergoing coronary artery grafts (CAG) for angina pectoris.Seventy eight pts had Class IV angina; of the 147 patients given propranolol, 41 were gradually withdrawn from propranolol and finally discontinued 24 hours before surgery, and 106 were abruptly withdrawn from propranolol 24 hours before CAG; 20 pts had left main coronary disease; 156 pts had cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time shorter than 20 minutes, and 16 pts had a CPB longer than 120 minutes.The operative mortality was 5.2% (9/172) for the entire group. Class IV angina (OM 7%), abrupt propranolol withdrawal (OM 6.6%), left main coronary artery disease (OM 25%), and CPB longer than 120 minutes (OM 50%), all significantly increased OM. These variables were interdependent, however, as many pts belonged to several predictor categories, combinations of predictors were examined, in order to more accurately predict the risk of individual pts. The combination of left main coronary artery disease and CPB longer than 120 minutes; and Class IV angina and CPB longer than 120 minutes were significantly associated with higher operative mortality.We conclude that Class IV angina, abrupt propranolol withdrawal, left main coronary artery disease and prolonged CPB are potent, interdependent predictors of OM in pts undergoing CAG. Consideration of these predictors, alone and in combination, allows effective prediction of OM for CAG in patients with stable angina pectoris.", 
    "38": "39 patients with sigmoid lesions have been examined with angiografphy, using epinephrine and propranolol. 11 had carcinoma, all were diagnosed angiographically. Fibrosis may appear similar on phamacoangiography whereas the inflammatory reaction is different.", 
    "39": "Autonomic regulation of the secretion of granule components in the convoluted tubular cells of male mouse submandibular glands was investigated with the use of an agar gel diffusion test using an antisera for male specific components. Whereas the injection of neither a parasympathomimetic agent (pilocarpine) nor a beta-adrenergic agent (isoproterenol) decreased the amount of the components in the glands, the injection of alpha-adrenergic agents (norepinephrine or phenylephrine) significantly decreased the amount of male specific components. Phenoxybenzamine, an alpha-blocker, completely inhibited these actions of norepinephrine and phenylephrine. These facts suggest that the alpha-adrenergic receptor participates in the secretion of male specific components present in the granules in the convoluted tubular cells of mouse submandibular glands.", 
    "40": "The IV injection of 1-2 mg/kg dl-propranolol in dogs elicited a reduction of arterial blood pressure accompanied by a blockade of hypertensive responses to carotid occlusion or stimulation of the central trunk of the vagus. The same fall of blood pressure and identical blockades were seen following propranolol injected in the cisterna magna at a total dose of 2-5 mg. This late treatment also abolished the hypertensive response to KCl injected into the cisterna magna. On the other hand, propranolol failed to modify significantly responses to the electrical stimulation of hepatic and splenic sympathetic fibers and did not influence the hypertensive effects of adrenaline and noradrenaline. These findings are compatible with the notion that propranolol lowers systemic blood pressure via an action on central nervous system vasomotive centers.", 
    "41": "The experiments carried out on the isolated carotid sinus in the rabbit demonstrated that alpha and beta adrenoceptors are capable of detecting the circulating catecholamines and the catecholamines of the synaptic cleft in order to modulate the release of noradrenaline from the sympathetic nerve endings in response to a potential action.", 
    "42": "The blocking effects of 50 mg and 100 mg of propanolol, a beta-receptor blocker, upon the beta-adrenergic receptors of cattle heart were verified by means of 250 microgram of isoprenaline, a maximum dose. The 50-mg-propanolol dose inhibited between 77 and 80 per cent of the isoprenaline-caused QT reduction, whic action was considered as being sufficiently safe to rule out any beta-adrenergic cardiac effect. Blockade was further increased to the order of between 89 and 92 per cent by using 100 mg of propanolol, but certain side-effects occurred (expiratory dyspnoe, quinidinlike action in terms of PQ extension, and vagovasal collapse). Therefore, 50 mg of propanolol are recommended as the proper dosage with which to examine cardiac and extracardiac beta-adrenergic receptors in cattle. Application of propanolol to non-anaesthetised, nonatropinised cattle resulted in higher bloackade of isoprenaline-caused QT reduction, as compared to the parameters PQ, TP, TQ, time of cardiac action, PP, and momentary heart rate. This phenomenon is being analysed. With reference being made to the peculiarities of sympathico-parasympathetic interactions on the heart, QT time is considered as a more safe parameter by which to assess substrate competition between propanolol and isoprenaline at cardiac beta-receptors, while the ventriculodiastolic ECG recordings TQ, TP, and PQ as well as time of cardiac action, PP and momentary heart rate might come under a somewhat stronger influence of the parasympathetic system.", 
    "43": "The synthesis of biotinyl-hexaglycyl-NEDA (abbreviation:BGN), a biotinyl derivative of propranolol, is described. This bifunctional molecule binds with high affinity to the biotin-binding protein, avidin. The duck erythrocyte was used as a model beta-receptor system. Formation of an avidin-BGN-beta-receptor complex was demonstrated in intact erythrocytes, in erythrocyte ghosts, and in the digitonin-solubilized beta-receptor. The avidin-BGN complex will be used for localization and purification of the beta-receptor.", 
    "44": "A short review of the role of cyclic nucleotides and prostaglandins (PGs) in normal and pathological functions of the heart is given. Possible interrelationships of these two regulatory systems have been studied by using spontaneously beating rat atria preparations. Addition of noradrenaline (NA) to the incubate (1 . 10(-6) M) caused an increase in amplitude and frequency which was preceded and parallelled by an elevation of the tissue cAMP level. A transient increase in cGMP and PGE values was also seen. Propranolol (5 . 10(-6) M) abolished the increase in amplitude and frequency as well as in cAMP and PGE concentrations. Indomethacin (1 . 10(-5) M) inhibited the formation of PGE. The increase in cGMP was blocked by phenoxybenzamine. Interchange between beta- and alpha-receptors according as the temperature is lowered has been described earlier. Hypothermia (20 degrees C) had a positive inotropic effect on the atria and increased the tissue cAMP concentration. Loading of the atria caused an increase in cAMP without any effects on cGMP or PGs. Slight hypoxia did not change the cAMP or PG levels, but elevated the cGMP values. Arrhythmias induced by hypo- or hyperpotassemia did not modify the biochemical parameters measured. PGF2alpha (1. 10(-5) M) normalized the atrial rhythm and increased the amplitude without changing cyclic nucleotide or PG levels. PGE1 (1 . 10(-4) M) increased the amplitude of normorhythmic atria and the tissue concentration of cAMP. PGE2 was the only PG tested which stimulated the heart adenylate cyclase in vitro. There seems to be close but complicated relationships between cyclic nucleotides and PGs in the heart.", 
    "45": "The effect of agents influencing intracellular cyclic nucleotide levels and that of exogenous cAMP was studied on the cytotoxicity of normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells on antibody coated human and chicken erythrocytes. Elevation of the cAMP level resulted in a marked decrease in cytotoxicity, while basically similar in the allogeneic and the xenogeneic test systems, but more expressed in the allogeneic system.", 
    "46": "Further investigations about the role of the mitochondria-rich cell (MR cell) in hormone-mediated transport regulation in the epithelium of frog skin brought the following results: Unlike toad bladder, in frog skin the spontaneous potential difference cannot be reversed when Na transport is blocked. A similar situation is obtained when, in addition to transport-blockade, one applies a chemical gradient for chloride to the epithelium. Under these conditions we found that in the intact preparation as well as in the separated epithelium: (i) the reversed current (RC) is linearly related to the number of MR cells; (ii) RC is mainly carried by a passive, transcellular chloride flux inwards and (iii) RC is sensitive to nor-adrenaline (10(-7) M). The beta-blocker propranolol abolishes this effect. We propose that the MR cells are the sites of transepithelial shunt-path and that this chloride flux is transcellular. As it is hormone sensitive, it could be an important regulatory instrument for the regulation of overall salt transport (internal shorting).", 
    "47": "The effects of atropine and oxprenolol on changes occurring in total catecholamine, cyclic AMP (cAMP) and lactate concentrations in arterial and coronary sinus blood, during submaximal isometric exercise, were studied in 10 patients. Static one-third-maximal handgrip exercise, sustained for 5 minutes, did not produce an increase in either arterial or coronary sinus plasma catecholamine concentrations (measured at rest and during the last minute of exercise) and was not influenced by atropine and oxprenolol. Myocardial lactate production did not occur. Coronary sinus cAMP concentrations fell during isometric exercise from 11.53 +- 0.93 to 9.42 +/- 0.81 nmol/l (+/ SEM), and following autonomic blockade from 12.46 +/- 1.12 TO 9.6 +/- 0.87 nmol/l but rose on subsequent isometric exercise to 11.27 +/- 0.8 nmol/l (p less than 0.05). Although this latter increase could still be due to beta-adrenergic stimulation, the absence of any change in catecholamine concentrations in the presence of beta-blockade suggests that other factors may have been responsible."
