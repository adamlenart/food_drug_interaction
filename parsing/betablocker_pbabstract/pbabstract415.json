    "0": "The effect of hypoxia and acidosis on the elimination of an oxidatively metabolized drug, S-propranolol, was examined in the single-pass isolated perfused rat liver (IPRL). The experiments (N = 6) consisted of four consecutive 30 min phases: normal pH (pH 7.4)/normal oxygen delivery, normal pH/hypoxia, hypercapnic acidosis (pH 7.1)/normal oxygenation and hypercapnic acidosis/hypoxia. Hypoxia and acidosis were produced by equilibrating the perfusate with appropriate mixtures of O2, N2 and CO2. With normal oxygen delivery there was no difference in hepatic clearance of propranolol between normal pH and acidosis (9.65 +/- 0.34 and 9.78 +/- 0.11 mL/min, respectively. P < 0.05). During hypoxia, propranolol clearance was impaired to a similar extent under both pH conditions (7.41 +/- 0.97 and 8.06 +/- 0.81 mL/min, respectively, P > 0.05). Therefore, respiratory acidosis does not affect the clearance of propranolol by the IPRL, nor does it influence the sensitivity of propranolol clearance to hypoxia. Neither acidosis nor hypoxia resulted in a significant reduction in bile flow compared with the normal pH/normal oxygen phase and there was no correlation between bile flow and perfusate bicarbonate concentration (P > 0.05).", 
    "1": "We investigated, using the single-pass isolated perfused rat liver preparation, whether the centrilobular location of hepatic oxidative drug metabolism could be a contributing factor to the marked sensitivity of drug oxidation to hypoxia. Livers (N = 7) were each perfused for 130 min with 2 micrograms/mL (+)-propranolol, a drug metabolized almost entirely by oxidation in the rat. The direction of flow was reversed after 60 min, the order of flow direction being randomized. Normal oxygenation was used during the first 30 min of antegrade and of retrograde perfusion, but in the second 30 min perfusate was equilibrated with a N2/O2 mixture designed to reduce hepatic oxygen delivery by half. During normal oxygenation there was no significant difference between antegrade and retrograde perfusion in hepatic oxygen delivery and physiological parameters such as oxygen consumption and extraction, perfusion pressure and bile flow. During hypoxia, mean oxygen delivery was slightly lower with retrograde perfusion (retrograde: mean = 2.37 mumol/min/g liver, range = 1.56-3.17; antegrade: mean = 2.90 mumol/min/g liver, range = 1.96-4.08; P = 0.04), but there was no significant difference in physiological parameters within each liver (P > 0.05). Propranolol clearance during normal oxygenation was similar to the perfusion rate (10 mL/min) and was the same for both directions of perfusion (antegrade 9.88 +/- 0.07 mL/min, retrograde 9.88 +/- 0.13 mL/min, P > 0.05). Hypoxia reduced propranolol clearance substantially, but the decrease was significantly greater with antegrade perfusion (5.65 +/- 1.89 mL/min) than with retrograde perfusion (6.76 +/- 1.95 mL/min, P = 0.014). Oxidative drug metabolism is located primarily in the centrilobular zone and sinusoidal oxygen concentration is lowest in the \"downstream\" zone with both antegrade and retrograde perfusion. These findings suggest that the centrilobular location of propranolol metabolism may influence the effect of hypoxia on propranolol elimination, but is not a major contributor to the marked sensitivity of propranolol elimination to hypoxia antegrade perfusion.", 
    "2": "Twenty-eight patients (11 Caucasian, 17 black) whose blood pressure was more than 160/96 mmHg after 4 weeks on placebo added to atenolol 100 mg/day were randomly given, in addition, nisoldipine 10 mg or nifedipine 20 mg each twice a day for 8 weeks in a double-blind cross-over study. There was a statistically significant (P < 0.001) fall in blood pressure with no change in heart rate, both supine and erect, on both drugs. There were no significant differences between nisoldipine and nifedipine. Adverse effects were recorded in 15%, 17% and 35% of the patients available for safety comparison for placebo, nisoldipine and nifedipine, respectively. There were no significant differences between the black and Caucasian patients in blood pressure responses, although the study had only a low power to detect these. However, the fasting serum triglyceride levels at the end of both calcium antagonist treatment periods were highly significantly lower in the black patients compared with the Caucasian patients. Nisoldipine, which has a higher coronary vascular selectivity and less negative inotropism than nifedipine, is as effective and as well tolerated as nifedipine in patients whose hypertension is inadequately controlled on atenolol. It may have a special role in hypertensive patients with impaired left ventricular function.", 
    "3": "A method based on LC-MS-MS has been developed for the determination of timolol in plasma using the (CD3)3-labelled species as the internal standard. Timolol is isolated from plasma by a simple solid-phase extraction and converted to its oxazolidin-2-one prior to analysis on a 50 x 4.6 mm reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography column packed with SynChropak, C18, 5 microns. The column eluate is passed by means of a heated nebulizer interface into a corona discharge atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source where the analyte and its internal standard are detected using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The very high specificity of this technique permits chromatographic run times of less than 2 min. The method has a lower quantifiable limit of 0.5 ng ml-1, with intra- and inter-day relative standard deviations less than 10%, and enables the determination of timolol in plasma after ocular administration to volunteers.", 
    "4": "In the liquid chromatographic analysis of pharmaceuticals, two challenges are often encountered: detectivity and chiral separations. Propranolol, a beta adrenergic blocker, is a pharmaceutical compound that faces both of these limitations. In this study, both limitations are overcome simultaneously using derivatization with (+)-1-(9-fluorenyl)ethyl chloroformate (FLEC), a highly fluorescent and chiral reagent. The derivatization is automated using an autosampler with an AutoMix microrobotic feature, which greatly contributes to the efficiency and reproducibility of the method when manipulating microliter volumes of sample and reagents. The method yields excellent separation of the diasteriomers, has a detection limit of 1 picomol, good reproducibility and linearity in the 50-400 pmol range (on column). In addition, this method is simple, requires no elevated temperature, no chiral stationary or mobile phases and can be easily automated.", 
    "5": "Carvedilol is a novel multiple-action cardiovascular drug that has recently been introduced to the market for the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. Clinical studies have demonstrated that once daily therapy with carvedilol is efficacious and has a favourable side-effect profile. Clinical studies are in progress to establish the utility of carvedilol in angina and congestive heart failure. Carvedilol is a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist and a vasodilator, with the vasodilating activity resulting primarily from alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade and possibly also from calcium channel blockade. The reduction in BP produced by carvedilol results from the vasodilating activity of the drug because peripheral vascular resistance is significantly reduced. The reduction in BP produced by carvedilol is not associated with reflex tachycardia owing to the beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity of the compound. Throughout its antihypertensive dose range, carvedilol has been a renal-sparing antihypertensive agent in animals and also in humans, inasmuch as renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate and sodium excretion are all maintained. In preclinical experimental models of acute myocardial infarction, carvedilol has produced marked reductions in infarct size in the pig, rat and dog. The cardioprotection observed with carvedilol is greater than that provided by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists alone, suggesting that the additional activities of carvedilol may provide benefit in the setting of myocardial ischaemia.", 
    "6": "We have developed a human B-lymphoblastoid cell, designated h2D6v2, which expresses high levels of CYP2D6 cDNA. Microsomal P450 contents of 160 pmol mg-1 protein were observed. NADPH-fortified microsomes exhibited a substantial capacity to hydroxylate the prototype CYP2D6 substrates bufuralol and debrisoquine. Kinetic parameters, apparent Km, turnover number, Ki for quinidine inhibition and stereospecificity of bufuralol hydroxylation, observed with the human lymphoblast expressed enzyme were similar to those observed in human liver microsomes or purified liver CYP2D6 proteins. Therefore, the human lymphoblast expressed material appears to faithfully reflect the authentic protein. Relative to control cells, h2D6v2 cells were more sensitive to the cytotoxicity and mutagenicity of 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), supporting our previous observation with a cell line expressing lower levels of CYP2D6. h2D6v2 microsomes were capable of metabolizing NNK and NNK metabolism and mutagenicity were markedly inhibited by the addition of quinidine, a CYP2D6 inhibitor. h2D6v2 cells coupled with control cells, represent a useful in vitro system for studying xenobiotic metabolism by the clinically important, polymorphic CYP2D6. The human lymphoblast system offers the desirable ability to couple metabolic transformation studies with toxicological endpoints such as cytotoxicity and mutagenicity.", 
    "7": "The antianginal activities of nicorandil, 10 and 20 mg bid, and metoprolol, 100 mg bid, were compared in patients with stable effort angina pectoris in a randomized, double-blind parallel group study lasting 7 weeks. Twenty patients were enrolled into the trial and 16 patients completed the study. To evaluate the anti-ischemic effects of the two drugs, a treadmill exercise test was performed after a 1-week placebo run-in period and 6 weeks of treatment. On the same occasions, weekly sublingual nitroglycerin consumption and the number of anginal attacks were also recorded in the patient's diary. The total duration of exercise increased significantly with both nicorandil, 10 and 20 mg, and metoprolol (p < 0.01). Similar improvements were observed in the time to onset of ischemia with both treatments (p < 0.01). The double product at maximal comparable workload (MAX 1) was reduced with the two drugs (p < 0.05 for nicorandil and p < 0.01 for metoprolol), while at the maximal exercise time (MAX 2) it was reduced with metoprolol (p < 0.01) and slightly but not significantly increased with both doses of nicorandil. Weekly sublingual nitroglycerin consumption and anginal attacks were also significantly reduced a similar manner by both treatments (p < 0.01). In conclusion, nicorandil, 10 and 20 mg bid, exerted an anti-ischemic effect comparable with that of metoprolol in patients with stable effort angina pectoris.", 
    "8": "The causes of organ failure following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were multi-factorial. Damage was initiated by elastase which was released from activated granulocytes under conditions of significant reduction in the protease inhibitor level (p < 0.01). The increase in endothelin excretion observed during and after the CPB induced a further vasoconstrictive response in the microvasculature and accelerated ischemic cellular damage. Upon completion of the CPB, the elevation of the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucuronidase was influenced by the elastase and endothelin concentrations (r = 0.8 and r = 0.67 respectively). Renal damage, which was detected by an increase in renal tubular enzymes (N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase), was affected by endothelin (r = 0.61, 0.75) and elastase concentrations (r = 0.74, 0.75) respectively. In the group treated with nicardipine during the CPB, an increase in beta-glucuronidase was significantly low (p < 0.01) and renal tubular damage was significantly reduced. Moreover, lesser elevation of the elastase level on arrival in the ICU was evidenced (p < 0.05). Thus we concluded that nicardipine inhibited the release of elastase from the activated neutrophils and prevented the vasoconstriction caused by the endothelin secretion.", 
    "9": "The pharmacokinetics of propranolol following intravenous administration (1 mg/kg), with and without treatment with oral activated charcoal, was investigated in rabbits. In charcoal-treated rabbits a significant reduction in propranolol serum concentrations was observed compared to control animals. Charcoal treatment significantly reduced the half-life of elimination (16.6%) and the mean residence time (19%) of propranolol. A 17% increase in the systemic clearance and a 14% decrease in AUC were also noted. Charcoal administration did not significantly alter the volume of distribution (Vc' V(area) and Vss) or the apparent distribution half-life. A two-compartment model adequately described propranolol in control and treated rabbits. The results indicate that administration of oral activated charcoal enhances the systemic elimination of propranolol. This is presumably mediated by interruption of the enterohepatic circulation of propranolol by activated charcoal.", 
    "10": "The aim was to test the effect of propranolol, a beta adrenergic receptor blocking drug which diminishes myocardial ischaemia, on coronary collateral development.", 
    "11": "Dogs were chronically instrumented with a left circumflex coronary artery Doppler flow probe, ameroid constrictor, pneumatic occluder, and left atrial and aortic catheters. Haemodynamic studies and measurements of normal myocardial and collateral blood flows were performed at least weekly after surgery, or sooner if the left circumflex artery occluded spontaneously, in eight control dogs and seven animals treated with propranolol, 240 mg twice daily (a dose which successfully attenuated the chronotropic effect of a graded infusion of isoprenaline). In dogs in which the left circumflex artery occluded within the first four weeks after surgery, collateral blood flow was measured during exercise on a motorized treadmill.", 
    "12": "There was no difference between the groups in the rate or pattern of coronary collateral development, magnitude of collateral flow before or after spontaneous left circumflex occlusion, and collateral vascular reserve during exercise. At the time of coronary occlusion resting collateral flow was equivalent to normal perfusion levels in both groups and averaged 87-96% of normal flows during exercise.", 
    "13": "Propranolol has no observable effect on coronary collateral development despite its acknowledged ability to prevent or attenuate myocardial ischaemia.", 
    "14": "The pharmacokinetics of R- and S-atenolol after intravenous administration of racemic atenolol were studied in 3-, 12- and 24-month-old rats and in 3-month-old rats with renal failure induced by uranyl nitrate. In all age groups, the area under the plasma concentration-time curves is higher for R- than for S-atenolol; volume of distribution, total clearance and renal clearance are lower for R-atenolol than for S-atenolol, but the differences are small. In function of age there is for both enantiomers a significant increase in AUC, due, at least in part, to a decreased renal clearance; the effect of aging is not stereoselective. In rats with renal failure, the AUC of both enantiomers increases, due mainly to a decrease in renal clearance, but to a lesser degree also to a decrease in nonrenal clearance. For both enantiomers, the volume of distribution decreases and the half-life increases in the uraemic rats. The total amount of both enantiomers excreted in the urine is decreased in the rats with renal failure. There are no stereoselective effects of treatment of the rats with uranyl nitrate.", 
    "15": "The effects of SQ29,852 (n = 24), a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, and atenolol (n = 22), monotherapies were compared in 46 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Both SQ29,852 (mean dose 15.0 +/- 5.1 mg/day) and atenolol (mean dose 37.5 +/- 18.5 mg/day) significantly decreased both systolic and diastolic blood pressures. There were no significant changes in serum lipids, apolipoproteins, lipoproteins or atherosclerotic indices after both SQ29,852 and atenolol. There were also no significant inter-group differences. There were no serious side effects or abnormal laboratory tests in both treatment groups. It is concluded that SQ29,852 is an effective antihypertensive drug without adverse effect on lipid metabolism.", 
    "16": "The antihypertensive efficacy of single-drug therapy with nifedipine (N), prazosin (P), or acebutolol (A) and the influence of these agents on coronary risk factors including hypoglycemia, hyperuricemia, and hyperlipidemia, were studied in adolescents with hypertension. Ninety patients (73 girls and 17 boys) aged 14 to 18 years with idiopathic hypertension (IH) were randomized into three groups. Each group received N, P, or A as single-drug therapy for six months. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures fell in all three groups, from 152/90 mmHg to 127/70 mmHg* with N, from 150/90 mmHg to 121/70 mmHg* with P, and from 148/92 mmHg to 122/74 mmHg* mmHg with A. In 17% of cases, N failed to reduce blood pressures below the 90th centiles. Heart rate was not influenced by N or P but decreased from 84 to 75 bpm with A. Although none of the drugs modified serum uric acid levels, fractional uric acid secretion rose with P and A (from 4.1% to 6% with P; and from 4.4% to 6% with A). The lipid profile remained unchanged under N and P, whereas a decrease in serum LDL-cholesterol from 99.6 to 88.8% mg* was seen with A. Fasting serum glucose levels increased from 86.4 to 92.7 mg %* in the group given A. N, P, and A are suitable for single-drug therapy of IH in adolescents; the most appropriate drug should be selected on the basis of medical history.", 
    "17": "Nonstereospecific studies have indicated that the pharmacokinetics of propranolol (PR) are altered in inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. However, as the kinetics and dynamics of PR are stereoselective, we examined the effect of adjuvant arthritis (AA) on the disposition of the individual enantiomers. A novel normal-phase stereospecific HPLC assay for PR was developed involving chiral derivatization with S-(naphthyl)ethyl isocyanate and fluorescence detection. Oral and iv doses of racemic PR were administered to control and AA rats (n = 6). AA had no significant effect on either clearance or S:R ratio after iv doses. On the other hand, after oral doses, clearance was significantly decreased in AA. Although significant for both enantiomers, this effect was more pronounced on the less active R-enantiomer. The AUC R:S ratio was, therefore, significantly altered (AA, 14 +/- 3.0; control, 4.3 +/- 1.2). Increased total (S+R) plasma concentrations of PR in AA, possibly due to a reduced intrinsic clearance, therefore, reflect mainly increased concentrations of the less active R-enantiomer.", 
    "18": "Although insulin is known to cause internalization of its own receptors, the physiological significance of this phenomenon is not clear. In the isolated rat heart we observed that the positive inotropic effect of 25 munits/ml insulin was completely abolished if the heart was preperfused with insulin for 10 min. This tachyphylactic response to insulin began to appear 3-4 min after starting preperfusion with insulin and was partially reversible after 30 min of washing. Preperfusion with insulin did not affect the action of vanadate, which has insulin-like effect on glucose transport, or the actions of the other positive inotropic agents, isoproterenol and ouabain. The presence of propranolol in the perfusion medium, unlike atenolol, phenoxybenzamine, guanethidine, verapamil or quinidine, modified the inotropic as well as tachyphylactic responses to insulin. The positive inotropic and tachyphylactic responses to insulin were not altered in hearts from reserpine-treated animals. Perfusion of heart with glucose-free solution abolished the tachyphylaxis due to insulin. Likewise, no tachyphylactic response to insulin was evident when iodoacetate, but not sodium fluoride, was added in medium containing glucose. These results suggest that ATP formed during glycolysis may play an important role in insulin-induced tachyphylaxis with respect to cardiac contractile activity.", 
    "19": "Medical treatment of atrial fibrillation has been carried out most frequently with digoxin, quinidine, propafenone or flecainide. In spite of unequivocal efficacy, the use of class I antiarrhythmic agents is the subject of considerable controversy. In addition to increased mortality in patients with ventricular arrhythmias after myocardial infarction, proarrhythmic effects with flecainide have also been described in patients with supraventricular arrhythmias. A meta-analysis of long-term treatment of atrial fibrillation with quinidine disclosed that the mortality in those treated with quinidine at 2.9% was significantly higher than those receiving placebo at 0.8%. In consideration of the prevailing uncertainty with the use of class I antiarrhythmic agents, class III antiarrhythmic drugs such as sotalol and amiodarone have been administered for supraventricular arrhythmias with increasing frequency. Treatment of atrial fibrillation with sotalol Sotalol is a noncardioselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocker with antiarrhythmic properties of class III. This drug prolongs the duration of the action potential and the refractory periods in atrial and ventricular myocardium and slows the AV-conduction as well as the sinus node rate. On oral administration, there is good resorption and a half-time of seven to 18 hours. The effective oral dose varies between 80 and 320 mg/12 hours. For conversion of acute supraventricular arrhythmias, an i.v. bolus of 0.5 to 1.5 mg/kg has been used. The results of clinical studies with sotalol in the treatment of atrial fibrillation are shown in Table 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "20": "The objective of this study was to examine the contribution of beta-blockade to antihypertensive treatment regimens including an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or a calcium antagonist. The effects on BP control, adverse events, and plasma active renin concentration of removing atenolol from standard triple therapy (bendrofluazide and atenolol together with captopril or nifedipine) were assessed in a double-blind, randomised, parallel-group study, of eight weeks' duration in 46 patients from the Glasgow Blood Pressure Clinic. Blood pressures rose in patients randomised to placebo-atenolol compared with those who continued active-atenolol although the difference did not achieve statistical significance. However, the proportion of patients with controlled blood pressure (supine systolic BP < 140 mmHg plus supine diastolic BP < 95 mmHg) fell from 31% to 0% over the study period in patients given placebo-atenolol. There was a trend for BP control to deteriorate most when atenolol was withdrawn from nifedipine treated patients, but the 95% confidence intervals for the difference from captopril-treated patients were wide. Few side-effects were seen and these did not differ quantitatively between the study groups. Plasma active renin concentration was initially higher in captopril-treated patients, and increased on withdrawal of atenolol in both groups. Our findings suggest that beta-blockers make a clinically relevant contribution to treatment regimens including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium antagonists when given as part of standard triple antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "21": "1. We have assessed the effect of allopurinol, amlodipine and propranolol pretreatment on both endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent coronary vasodilatation in vivo, by comparing pre-ischaemic responses with those measured after 60 min of coronary artery occlusion and 30 min of reperfusion in anaesthetized dogs. 2. In 15 untreated dogs ischaemia and reperfusion attenuated the increases in coronary blood flow produced by either acetylcholine (0.01-0.05 micrograms kg-1, i.a.) or glyceryl trinitrate (0.05-0.2 micrograms kg-1, i.a.), to an average of 39 +/- 4% and 42 +/- 5% of the pre-ischaemic control response, respectively (both P < 0.05). 3. In 5 dogs treated with allopurinol (25 mg kg-1, orally, 24 h previously, plus 50 mg kg-1, i.v., 5 min before occlusion), the increases in coronary blood flow after ischaemia and reperfusion (acetylcholine: 78 +/- 12%, glyceryl trinitrate: 60 +/- 3% of pre-ischaemic response) were significantly larger than post-ischaemic responses in untreated dogs (both P < 0.05). 4. Similarly, amlodipine treatment (3 micrograms kg-1 min-1, i.v., starting 90 min before occlusion) in 5 dogs improved post-ischaemic increases in blood flow (acetylcholine: 58.5%, glyceryl trinitrate: 66 +/- 6% of pre-ischaemic response, significantly greater than post-ischaemic responses in untreated dogs, P < 0.05). 5. In contrast, in a further 6 dogs pretreated with propranolol (1 mg kg-1, i.v., 30 min before occlusion,plus 0.5 mg kg-1 h-1, i.v.), blood flow responses after ischaemia and reperfusion were not different from post-ischaemic responses in untreated dogs (acetylcholine: 46 +/- 6%, glyceryl trinitrate: 46 +/-6% of pre-ischaemic response).6. These results suggest that allopurinol and amlodipine protect against the post-ischaemic impairment of endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent coronary vasodilatation in vivo by mechanisms additional to endothelial protection.", 
    "22": "Mean arterial blood pressure (P(a)) and heart rate (HR) were studied in normal conscious cane toads (Bufo marinus) or in autonomically blocked animals treated variously with bretylium, atropine, phentolamine, and propranolol. Partial or total autonomic blockade had no effect on resting values of the variables tested, with the exception that atropine treatment of bretylium-treated toads caused an increase of heart rate by 5.3 +/- 1.3 beats/min. In graded hemorrhage, aliquots of blood (1.68 ml/100 g body wt) were removed at 60-min intervals. There was extensive plasma recruitment, and blood could be removed up to 10.08 ml/100 g without inducing cardiovascular shock. Each hemorrhage caused an initial transient decrease in P(a) and increase in HR followed by recovery toward prehemorrhage values. Repeated hemorrhage caused a progressive rise in basal HR and fall in basal P(a). The effects of drug treatments suggest that transient increases in HR may be caused by the release of adrenal catecholamines. In addition, hemorrhage may increase sympathetic tone so that basal HR becomes elevated, which, together with sympathetic vasoconstriction, limits the progressive fall of basal P(a).", 
    "23": "The role of KATP channels in myocardial stunning produced by repetitive coronary occlusions was studied in barbital-anesthetized dogs. Regional percent segment function (%SS) was measured by sonomicrometry, and the monophasic action potential (MAP) in the ischemic region was measured by an epicardial probe. Under control conditions, six 5-min periods of coronary occlusion, interspersed with 10-min periods of reperfusion, and ultimately followed by 2 h of reperfusion produced regional segment dysfunction and a similar rate and amount of shortening of the MAP measured at 50% repolarization duration (MAPD50) during each successive ischemic period. Pretreatment with glibenclamide (0.3 mg/kg iv), a KATP channel antagonist, significantly prevented the reduction of MAPD50, particularly during the first occlusion period, and it worsened postischemic dysfunction. In contrast, pretreatment with aprikalim (10 micrograms/kg bolus +/- 0.1 microgram.kg-1.min-1 iv), a KATP channel opener, accelerated the rate and extent of shortening of MAPD50 during each occlusion and markedly improved %SS throughout reperfusion. Pretreatment with d-sotalol (2 mg/kg iv), an antagonist of voltage-dependent K+ channels, significantly prolonged MAPD50 of the ischemic region before coronary occlusion but did not alter the rate of shortening of MAPD50 during ischemia and did not affect the recovery of %SS. These results indicate that activation of KATP channels during ischemia with the resultant shortening of the MAPD50 is an endogenous adaptive mechanism that affords functional myocardial protection during repetitive, brief periods of coronary arterial occlusion.", 
    "24": "A generalized, weighted, nonlinear least squares procedure is developed, based on pH titration data, for the refinement of octanol-water partition coefficients (log P) and ionization constants (pKa) of multiprotic substances. Ion-pair partition reactions, self-association reactions forming oligomers, and formations of mixed-substance complexes can be treated with this procedure. The procedure allows for CO2 corrections in instances where the base titrant may have CO2 as an impurity. Optionally, the substance purity and the titrant strength may be treated as adjustable parameters. The partial differentiation in the Gauss-Newton refinement procedure is based on newly derived analytical expressions. The new procedure was experimentally demonstrated with benzoic acid, 1-benzylimidazole, (+/-)-propranolol, and mellitic acid (benzenehexacarboxylic acid, AH6). Ionic strength (l) was adjusted with KNO3. Benzoic acid (20 degrees C; l 0.1 M): pKa = 3.99 +/- 0.02, log P = 1.96 +/- 0.02, log P (anion) = -1.2; 1-benzylimidazole (25 degrees C; l 0.1 M): pKa = 6.70 +/- 0.03, log P = 1.60 +/- 0.04; propranolol (25 degrees C; l 0.1 M): pKa = 9.53 +/- 0.06, log P = 3.35 +/- 0.03, log P (cation) = 0.62 +/- 0.08; mellitic acid (26 degrees C; l 0.2 M): pKas 1.10 +/- 0.46, 1.69 +/- 0.03, 2.75 +/- 0.02, 4.00 +/- 0.02, 5.05 +/- 0.01, and 6.04 +/- 0.02; in the presence of 0.01 M n-Bu4NBr, log P (AH6) = 1.5, log P (AH5-) = 1.1, log P (AH4(2-)) = 0.8, log P (AH3(3-)) = 0.3, log P (AH2(4-)) = -0.1, and log P (AH5-) = -0.5 (all +/- 0.1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "25": "Inhaled propranolol (P) was administered to a population which included asthmatic children (30 subjects) and adults (43 subjects): 1) to investigate the determinants of induced bronchial response; 2) to examine the relationship with treatment requirements; 3) to determine the relationship with responsiveness to methacholine (M) and ultrasonically nebulized distilled water (UNDW) (50 subjects); and 4) to establish the short-term repeatability of bronchial response to propranolol compared with methacholine (22 subjects). Bronchial response to propranolol and methacholine was expressed as the cumulative provocative dose (PD20 in mumol) and responsiveness to UNDW as the provocative output (PO20 in ml.min-1) producing a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). Response to propranolol was significantly related to the degree of responsiveness to methacholine, but not to age, gender, presence of atopy, age at asthma onset, or baseline FEV1. PD20P was measurable in all but three subjects. A significant difference in mean PD20M but not in PD20P was found between subjects requiring more anti-asthmatic treatments compared to those without therapy. The difference between geometric mean PD20P and geometric mean PD20M was 14.1. PO20UNDW was measurable in only 21 out of 50 subjects. Both PD20P and PD20M were significantly lower in responders to UNDW than in nonresponders. Reproducibility of PD20P was comparable to that of PD20M (coefficients of repeatability: 1.17 and 1.09). We conclude that bronchial responsiveness to propranolol is safely measurable in most children and adults with asthma. Repeatability of bronchial response to propranolol is comparable to that of methacholine. Moreover, responsiveness to propranolol is not a predictor of treatment requirement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Forty patients with moderate to severe hypertension and daytime ambulatory diastolic blood pressure > or = 90 mm Hg were randomized double-blind to once-daily treatment with either quinapril up to 20 mg (n = 20) or atenolol up to 100 mg (n = 20) as single drugs or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg over a period of 12 weeks. 2.

Quinapril and atenolol reduced conventional blood pressure equally with substantial additional effect seen on combination therapy. The two regimens induced a significant decrease in ambulatory BP. However, the atenolol treated ambulatory hypertensive group experienced significantly greater decreases in diastolic blood pressure during 24 h, awake and sleep periods than did the quinapril group. 4. Adverse reactions were mild with both drugs except for severe Raynaud phenomenon in one patient in the atenolol group. Triglyceride levels were significantly increased with atenolol alone and in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. 5. Thus, within the limits of the dose ranges tested, quinapril and atenolol as single drugs or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide reduce significantly conventional and ambulatory blood pressure in moderate to severe hypertensives, but atenolol is more effective in reducing ambulatory diastolic blood pressure.", 
    "27": "1. The effects of metoprolol-Oros 14/190 once daily, propranolol 80 mg twice daily and temazepam 10 mg once daily on central nervous system (CNS) related performance and haemodynamic variables were evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, crossover study in 12 healthy volunteers. Drugs were administered for 3 consecutive days except for temazepam, which was administered on days 1 and 3 only. Treatment effects were evaluated at 0, 2, 5 and 8 h on days 1 and 3. 2. Neither beta-adrenoceptor blocker had significant effects in a battery of tests after single or 3 days dosing. Temazepam caused a decrease in saccadic peak velocity of 37.4 degrees s-1 (95% CI: 6.0, 68.9) at 2 h and an increase of auditory reaction times of 11.5 ms (0.2, 22.8) at 8 h on day 1. No significant effects of temazepam were detected on day 3. 3. Both beta-adrenoceptor blockers reduced exercise heart rate. Peak effects were measured at 2 h 40 min after propranolol but not metoprolol-Oros (difference, day 1:20 (11, 29) beats min-1, day 3:13 (8, 19) beats min-1). Both beta-adrenoceptor blockers significantly reduced baseline exercise heart rate on day 3. Compared with day 1, metoprolol-Oros caused larger reductions of exercise heart rate at all times on day 3. 4. Metoprolol-Oros and propranolol caused similar reductions of systolic- and diastolic blood pressure on days 1 and 3. Temazepam caused a small reduction in diastolic blood pressure at 5 h 40 min on day 1 but was otherwise devoid of haemodynamic effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Sinus cycle length (SCL) shortened significantly after PAB in both groups. PA and HV intervals did not change after PAB. AH interval shortened and Wenckebach period increased after PAB in SSS group. Maximum corrected sinus node recovery time shortened in the control group but did not change in the SSS group after PAB. Calculated sinoatrial conduction time shortened after PAB in both groups. Refractory periods of the atrioventricular (AV) node and the ventricle shortened significantly, but those of the atrium did not change after PAB. Linear relations existed between the change of SCL and the change of AH interval and of the Wenckebach period.

Thirty-two patients were followed for more than 48 weeks, and 22 patients remain on the treatment after 24 to 48 weeks. The study was interrupted in 17 patients. In 32 patients who were followed for more than 48 weeks, blood pressure was well controlled in 21 (65.6%) patients. In seven of these patients alpha beta- or beta-blockers were added to manidipine to control blood pressure. Only 1 of 32 patients whose serum creatinine level was below 3.1 mg/dl showed deterioration of renal function during the 48 weeks. Two of the 17 patients in whom the study was interrupted died of cerebral bleeding or pneumonia. Two patients discontinued the study because of complications of myocardial infarction and retinal infarction, six withdrew because of deterioration in renal function, and the other seven patients withdrew because of poor compliance. From these studies, it was concluded that manidipine is well tolerated and effective in hypertensive patients with renal impairment (serum creatinine levels < or = 3 mg/dl). If blood pressure is not well controlled in these patients, combined treatment with manidipine and alpha beta- or beta-blockers is recommended.", 
    "48": "To delineate the factors responsible for impaired clearance in cirrhosis, we examined propranolol disposition in rats with carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis and compared it with that in control animals, rats treated with chlorpromazine (an inhibitor of propranolol metabolism) and rats with acute liver injury. We measured the extraction ratio of propranolol by the isolated perfused liver and related it to estimates of propranolol drug-metabolizing enzyme activity in homogenates of the same livers. In control animals, drug-metabolizing enzyme activity (measured as the ratio Vmax/Km) averaged 5,319 +/- 1,193 ml/min; the extraction ratio in the perfused liver was close to 1.0 (0.97 +/- 0.01). Important decreases of microsomal enzyme activity were observed in rats treated with chlorpromazine (30 +/- 27 ml/min, p < 0.001) and in rats with acute liver injury (724 +/- 401 ml/min, p < 0.001), accounting for the decrease in the hepatic extraction ratio by the perfused liver (0.33 +/- 0.09 and 0.71 +/- 0.04, respectively, p < 0.01). In cirrhotic livers, enzyme activity was not significantly different from that of controls (3,592 +/- 1,857 ml/min) and could not account for the observed decrease in extraction (0.66 +/- 0.14, p < 0.01). The extraction of antipyrine by the isolated perfused liver was also measured as an index of microsomal enzyme activity and related to propranolol extraction. Antipyrine extraction was decreased by 90% in acute liver injury, compared with 33% in cirrhosis, suggesting a much greater reduction of microsomal enzyme activity in the former group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "49": "This study investigated the effects of the short-term administration of propranolol on gastric blood perfusion in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertensive gastropathy. Portal hypertensive gastropathy is a common cause of nonvariceal bleeding in cirrhosis, which is associated with increased gastric mucosal perfusion and is favorably influenced by propranolol therapy. Gastric mucosal perfusion was evaluated with laser-Doppler flowmetry and reflectance spectrophotometry. Measurements were performed under basal conditions and after the double-blind administration of propranolol (0.15 mg/kg intravenously) or placebo. Propranolol administration significantly reduced (p < 0.001) the laser-Doppler signal (2.93 +/- 0.23 vs. 2.25 +/- 0.22 V) and the hemoglobin content of the gastric mucosa (99.2 +/- 3.8 vs. 89.3 +/- 3.1 arbitrary units), whereas the oxygen content remained unchanged (37.4 +/- 1.2 vs. 36.9 +/- 1.0 arbitrary units). Placebo administration had no effect in any of these parameters. Changes in gastric perfusion after propranolol administration were associated with a significant decrease in hepatic venous pressure gradient and azygos blood flow. We conclude that short-term propranolol administration, in addition to lowering portal pressure, reduces the increased gastric blood perfusion in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertensive gastropathy, an effect that may contribute to prevention of bleeding from these lesions.", 
    "50": "The aim of the study was to assess the effect of adding pindolol to previously used verapamil monotherapy on left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function in 20 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Patients were initially treated with verapamil in maximal well-tolerated doses for 16 +/- 14 months; pindolol, 5 mg twice daily, was added. In a Doppler echocardiographic study all patients had altered LV diastolic filling despite verapamil therapy. The control examination, which consisted of echocardiographic study and New York Heart Association functional status classification, was performed after 20 days and repeated after > or = 6 months of follow-up. Combined pindolol and verapamil therapy caused an increase in LV diastolic filling manifested by beneficial changes of transmitral flow parameters. Also, inhibition of hypercontractile LV function expressed by reduction of LV outflow tract pressure gradient and ejection fraction was observed. New York Heart Association functional class was reduced in 13 patients. The magnitude and distribution of LV myocardial hypertrophy did not change significantly. It is concluded that pindolol and verapamil combined therapy is superior to verapamil monotherapy because of improved LV diastolic function (probably due to partial agonist activity of pindolol) and reduced hypercontractile function in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.",

    "57": "To analyze the arrhythmogenic risk of common antiarrhythmic drugs in a quantitative and comparative manner, isolated perfused rabbit hearts were treated with increasing concentrations of antiarrhythmic drugs corresponding to low, medium, and high therapeutic concentrations. For analysis of the epicardial activation process, an epicardial mapping (256 unipolar leads) was performed. For each electrode, the activation time was determined. From these data, the origins of epicardial activation (\"breakthrough points\" [BTP]) were determined. At each electrode, an activation vector (VEC) was calculated giving direction and velocity of the local excitation wave. The beat similarity of various heartbeats (under treatment) compared with control was evaluated by determination of the percentage of identical BTPs (deviation < or = 1 mm) and of similar VECs (deviation < or = 5 degrees). BTP and VEC were reduced by all antiarrhythmic agents tested (propafenone = flecainide > quinidine > ajmaline > procainamide > disopyramide > mexiletine = lidocaine > sotalol), indicating a more or less pronounced disturbance of the epicardial activation process. Treatment with propafenone, quinidine, and disopyramide and to a lesser extent sotalol prolonged the activation-recovery interval (ARI). ARI dispersion was greatly enhanced by flecainide and was reduced by sotalol. In addition, it could be shown that propranolol is able to reduce the proarrhythmic action of flecainide. This effect seemed to be due to a reduction of the flecainide-induced increase in ARI dispersion.",

    "59": "The present study addressed the possibility that disinhibition of serotonin (5-HT) autoreceptor-mediated negative feedback might potentiate the elevation of nerve terminal 5-HT output induced by selective 5-HT reuptake blockade. To this end, rats were given citalopram and the 5-HT autoreceptor-blocking agents (S)-UH-301 (5-HT1A) and (-)-penbutolol (5-HT1A/1B), and the effect on extracellular 5-HT in the ventral hippocampus was monitored by means of in vivo microdialysis. Citalopram (5 mg/kg, s.c.) approximately doubled the 5-HT output, a response that was markedly augmented by (S)-UH-301 (3 mg/kg, s.c.) and (-)-penbutolol (8 mg/kg, s.c.) and by combined treatment with (S)-UH-301 (3 mg/kg, s.c.) plus (-)-penbutolol (1 microM; via the dialysis perfusion medium), but not by (-)-penbutolol (1 microM) alone. These findings provide evidence that 5-HT, in particular 5-HT1A, autoreceptor-mediated negative feedback mechanisms are pivotal in determining the nerve terminal 5-HT output level after 5-HT reuptake inhibition. These findings have important implications for the interplay between different processes controlling 5-HT transmission in vivo and might possibly offer a lead toward novel, therapeutically exploitable principles.", 
    "60": "Gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1(7-36) amide (GLP-1) are thought to be the most probable candidates for incretin. However, the precise mechanism of incretin effect is unclear. In the present study, to elucidate the possible role of the autonomic nervous system in incretin effect, the effects of atropine, propranolol, metoprolol, and phentolamine on GIP- or GLP-1-induced insulin release were investigated in the rat. The GIP-induced (2 or 20 micrograms) insulin release was partly inhibited by propranolol pretreatment (0.5 mg/kg subcutaneously [SC]), and GLP-1-induced (2 or 20 micrograms) insulin release was partly inhibited by propranolol or metoprolol (35 mg/kg SC). These results suggest that a beta-adrenergic mechanism may be involved in the incretin effect, probably through a modulating effect on GIP- or GLP-1-induced insulin secretion.", 
    "61": "Characterization of adrenergic receptors in membranes from the rat seminal vesicle was studied by radioligand binding assay. Seminal vesicle membranes contained saturable and high affinity binding sites for the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist 3H-dihydroalprenolol (3H-DHA) and for the alpha-adrenergic antagonist 3H-prazosin. The observed order of potency for adrenergic agonists in competing for the 3H-DHA binding sites: isoproterenol > epinephrine congruent to salbutamol > norepinephrine indicates that these membrane receptors have the properties of beta 2-adrenergic receptors. alpha 1-Adrenergic receptors were defined mainly as alpha 1A subtypes by demonstrating their insensitivity to pretreatment with chlorethylclonidine and the different rank orders of antagonist affinities. No significant binding sites for the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonist 3H-clonidine were observed. The GTP-induced reduction in the affinity of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors for epinephrine was significantly reversed by the muscarinic cholinergic agonist carbachol. Atropine effectively antagonized this effect of carbachol on the competitive inhibition of 3H-prazosin binding by epinephrine in the presence of GTP, which suggests that muscarinic cholinergic receptors regulate the affinity of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors by modulating the effect of guanine nucleotides. The effect of GTP on decreasing the affinity of beta 2-adrenergic receptors was not influenced by the addition of carbachol.", 
    "62": "We investigated the extent to which sympathetic alpha 1-adrenoreceptor activation is involved in chronic pulmonary vascular regulation in conscious dogs after left lung autotransplantation (LLA). Continuous left pulmonary vascular pressure-flow plots were generated in conscious dogs 3-4 wk post-LLA and in identically instrumented conscious dogs not subjected to LLA (sham-operated controls). LLA resulted in a marked upward shift in the baseline left pulmonary vascular pressure-flow relationship compared with the control group (P < 0.01), i.e., LLA caused a chronic increase in pulmonary vascular resistance. The sympathetic alpha 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist prazosin partially reversed (P < 0.01) the LLA-induced increase in pulmonary vascular resistance. Circulating concentrations of norepinephrine and epinephrine at 2 and 4 wk post-LLA were not significantly different from values measured in control dogs. However, the dose-response relationship to the exogenous administration of the sympathetic alpha 1-adrenoreceptor agonist phenylephrine was shifted (P < 0.05) to the left post-LLA compared with control, which indicates an increase in pulmonary vascular reactivity to alpha 1-adrenoreceptor activation. This effect was not due to a generalized increase in pulmonary vascular reactivity to vasoconstrictor stimuli because the dose-response relationship to the thromboxane analogue U-46619 was not significantly altered post-LLA compared with control. Thus LLA results in a chronic increase in pulmonary vascular resistance in conscious dogs. A component of the increase in pulmonary vascular resistance resulting from LLA is mediated by an enhanced reactivity to sympathetic alpha 1-adrenoreceptor activation.", 
    "63": "1. The effects of age and of chronic antidepressant treatment on [3H]tryptamine and [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding site density were measured in brain cortical membranes from male Sprague-Dawley rats. 2. The density but not the affinity of [3H]tryptamine binding sites was increased in 18-month-old rats relative to 3-month-old rats. Neither the density nor the affinity of [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding sites was affected by age. 3. Chronic administration (28 days s.c. via Alzet osmotic minipumps) of tricyclic antidepressant drugs (daily doses: imipramine.HCl, 30 mg kg-1; desipramine.HCl, 10 mg kg-1; clomipramine.HCl, 10 mg kg-1) resulted in decreases in [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding site density but no changes in [3H]tryptamine binding site density; no changes in affinity of either site were observed. 4. Chronic administration (s.c. via Alzet osmotic minipumps) of monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressant drugs (daily doses: tranylcypromine.HCl, 0.5 and 1.0 mg kg-1; phenelzine sulfate, 5 and 10 mg kg-1, each for 28 days; clorgyline.HCl, 1.0 mg kg-1; (-)-deprenyl.HCl, 1.0 mg kg-1, each for 14 days) resulted in decreases in [3H]tryptamine binding site density, without any effects on the affinity of this site. In addition, each of these monoamine oxidase inhibitors except (-)-deprenyl resulted in a decrease in [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding site density. No affinity changes were observed. 5. These data indicate that the [3H]tryptamine binding site exhibits physiological changes with aging and is differentially sensitive to the actions of tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressants, respectively.", 
    "64": "In several animal species the catecholamines stimulate the release of alpha-MSH from the melanotrope cells of the pituitary neurointermediate lobe through beta-receptors. The human hypophysis does not include a well-defined intermediate lobe and the methods for measuring alpha-MSH are often poorly sensitive. Neuroregulation of this hormone in man has thus received little attention. To see whether the adrenergic system is involved in the control of alpha-MSH secretion and whether the latter is independent of that of other peptides derived from proopiomelanocortin, such as ACTH, we studied the effects on plasma alpha-MSH-like immunoreactivity (alpha-MSH-LI), ACTH, and cortisol of some adrenergic drugs active on the beta-receptors. Six normal volunteers underwent the infusion of the following drugs: isoproterenol (0.03 microgram.kg-1.min-1 for 60 min), propranolol (1 mg.min-1 for 5 min followed by 0.1 mg.min-1 for 115 min), propranolol+isoproterenol (infused between 30 and 90 min of propranolol infusion), placebo (saline solution). Isoproterenol increased alpha-MSH-LI at 15 min (p < 0.001). Propranolol induced a fall of alpha-MSH-LI between 30 and 60 min (p < 0.001), followed by a return to preinfusion concentrations beginning at 75 min, and completely prevented the stimulatory effect of isoproterenol. Plasma ACTH and serum cortisol were always unaffected. These results indicate that in man the adrenergic system stimulates alpha-MSH-LI release through beta-receptors, and that alpha-MSH-LI secretion is dissociated from that of ACTH and cortisol. This in turn suggests that separate neuroregulatory mechanisms exist for the melanotrope and corticotrope cells.",

The specificity of betaxolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, for beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors was compared with that of other beta-antagonists, atenolol, ICI-118551, butoxamine and (+/-)-propranolol, in the bovine trachea and heart by competitive interaction with [3H]-CGP12177 as a radioligand. 2. The radioligand Kd values were 0.75 +/- 0.12 and 1.60 +/- 0.11 nM in the trachea and heart, respectively, and the Bmax values were 34.00 +/- 4.41 and 21.54 +/- 2.94 fmol mg-1 protein, respectively. 3. Using ICI-118551, we determined the ratio of beta 1:beta 2-adrenoceptors in the trachea and heart to be approximately 29:71 and 56:44, respectively. 4. In the trachea, a beta 2-predominant tissue, betaxolol and atenolol were more selective for beta 1-adrenoceptor binding sites than beta 2-adrenoceptor binding sites, whereas ICI-118551 and butoxamine were more selective for beta 2-adrenoceptor binding sites. 5. The beta 1-selectivity of betaxolol was 2.2 and 2.7 fold higher than that of atenolol in the bovine trachea and heart. These findings suggest that betaxolol may be useful in the treatment of hypertension, cardiac arrhythmia and angina pectoris.",

    "67": "We reported previously that both the systemic administration and the local application of ethanol potentiated gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-induced depressions of cerebellar Purkinje neurons if the GABA responses were concomitantly facilitated (positively modulated) by a beta adrenergic agonist, such as isoproterenol (ISO). In the present study we investigated the influence of aging on the beta adrenergic sensitization of GABA responses in young and aged Fischer 344 (F344) rats which exhibit age-related deficits in beta adrenergic receptor functions in the cerebellum. We found that the efficacy of ISO to modulate GABA responses was less in aged F344 rats vs. young F344 rats and that ethanol potentiated further the ISO-facilitated GABA responses of only 15% of the cerebellar Purkinje neurons recorded from aged F344 rats compared to 56% of the neurons from young F344 rats. Furthermore, in aged F344 rats, local applications of ISO frequently attenuated (negatively modulated) GABA responses of cerebellar Purkinje neurons and ethanol decreased further these attenuated GABA responses. Similar interactions were only observed infrequently from young F344 rats. In addition, these data suggest that age-related changes in the function of beta adrenergic mechanisms in the cerebellum are reflected not only in the decreased frequency of neurons exhibiting ethanol potentiation of ISO-modulated GABA effects but also in the observation that ethanol reduced GABA responses even in the presence of beta adrenergic receptor stimulations. This latter ethanol effect may also involve a beta adrenergic mechanism.", 
    "68": "The adrenergic regulation of adipose tissue lipolysis and glucose metabolism was investigated in situ during a standardized mental stress test in 11 nonobese, healthy subjects, using microdialysis of the extracellular water space in sc adipose tissue. Microdialysis probes were inserted in the abdominal sc fat, and were perfused using solvents with or without adrenoceptor blocking agents. The tissue dialysate concentrations of glycerol (lipolysis index) glucose, lactate, and pyruvate were determined. The glycerol concentration in adipose tissue increased markedly during the stress test and decreased in the poststress period. A similar kinetic pattern was observed in blood. In situ administration of the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent propranolol almost completely prevented the stress-induced increase in adipose tissue glycerol levels, whereas a nonselective alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agent (phentolamine) was ineffective in this respect. Plasma levels of glucose and lactate remained unaltered during and after the stress test; at the same time plasma pyruvate decreased moderately. By contrast, glucose, lactate, and pyruvate in adipose tissue increased by 25-30% during or after the stress (P < 0.05). The increase in lactate and pyruvate in adipose tissue after the stress was completely off-set by alpha-adrenoceptor blockade in situ, whereas beta-adrenoceptor blockade in situ did not influence the kinetic pattern of these metabolites. It is concluded that the lipolytic activity in human adipose tissue is markedly enhanced during mental stress, owing to adrenergic mechanisms that are mediated via beta-adrenoceptors. After mental stress, adipose tissue glucose utilization is decreased and routed toward nonoxidative pathways. The latter seems to involve adrenergic effects that are mediated via alpha-adrenoceptors.", 
    "69": "We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study on the effect of disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) and nedocromil sodium (NED) on propranolol-induced bronchoconstriction (PIB) in 12 asthmatic subjects 10 to 53 years of age. Placebo (saline solution) and active drugs (10 mg) were aerosolized 30 minutes before bronchoprovocation with inhaled propranolol. Bronchial response to propranolol was expressed as the cumulative dose provoking a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20P) and given in mumol. Reproducibility of PD20P was estimated before and after the days of study. PD20P varied within two doubling doses. Disodium cromoglycate and NED had no significant effect on baseline lung function. Although, geometric mean PD20P values (+/- GSEM) recorded after DSCG (7.24 mumol +/- 1.31) and after NED (9.22 mumol +/- 1.26) were higher than values recorded after placebo (6.55 mumol +/- 1.31), these differences were not statistically significant. A greater than 2-fold increase in PD20P was noted after NED in three subjects and in one subject after DSCG. We conclude that both DSCG and NED only modestly alter PIB, with some between subject differences.", 
    "70": "The case of a male patient who experienced four allergic accidents after drinking coffee is reported. Two serious anaphylactic reactions with cardiac arrest occurred after a continuous treatment with beta-blocking eye drops (timolol) was prescribed. Dual sensitivation to coffee and to the gum arabic coating roasted coffee beans was demonstrated by skin prick tests and by human basophil degranulation tests. Occupational allergy to green coffee has been widely described, but food sensitization to these two allergens has not yet been reported. This case also draws attention to the risk, inherent in beta-blockers, of immuno-allergic reactions. These drugs produce a loss of compensatory cardiovascular mechanisms and make those who take them resistant to the conventional treatment of anaphylactic shocks, which explains the serious accidents that occurred in this patient. The authors stress the usefulness of a thorough investigation for food allergy to a rare allergen in patients with idiopathic anaphylaxis.", 
    "71": "The aim of this study was to assess the effect of propranolol treatment on the recurrence of variceal bleeding and mortality in patients with hepatic cirrhosis. Fifty seven patients were studied; they were recruited within 15 days of an episode of variceal bleeding, assigned randomly to receive propranolol (n = 29) placebo (n = 28) and followed during 4 years. Three patients were lost from follow up and in 3 propranolol was discontinued due to secondary effects. Bleeding recurrence was less frequent in the treated patients (Kaplan Meier analysis p < 0.01). Ten patients on placebo and 1 receiving the active drug died. Life table analysis showed a significantly better survival in the group of patients treated with propranolol. It is concluded that propranolol decreases the recurrence of variceal bleeding and improves survival in patients with hepatic cirrhosis.", 
    "72": "Sotalol causes noncardioselective beta-adrenergic antagonism and prolongation of repolarization of cardiac tissues (Class III electrophysiologic action). This dual pharmacologic profile confers unprecedented antiarrhythmic properties to the drug. Sotalol is highly bioavailable when administered orally in the fasting state and is mostly cleared unchanged in the urine with an apparent half-life of elimination of 15 to 17 hours. It has been found effective in the suppression of nearly all cardiac arrhythmias, with the exception of those precipitated by prolongation of ventricular repolarization. Its safety and efficacy relative to other antiarrhythmic drugs need to be examined more fully in randomized controlled trials of unselected patients. The adverse effects potentially associated with the use of sotalol are those commonly observed with beta-adrenergic blockade, as well as those resulting from excessive prolongation of the QT interval. The occurrence of torsade de pointes during treatment with sotalol may be minimized by limiting doses to no more than 640 mg/day and by strictly avoiding the development of hypokalemia.", 
    "73": "Carotid sinus massage (CSM) was performed in 44 patients (23 female, 21 male, mean age 52 years) with recurrent episodes of unexplained syncope and without any organic heart disease. The protocol of examination consisted of 5 s CSM performed unilaterally in supine, upright 60 degrees positions, after administration of propranolol (i.v. 0.1 mg/kg) and during autonomic inhibition (atropine i.v. 0.02 mg/kg after propranolol). The diagnosis of hypersensitive carotid sinus syndrome (HCSS) was established in case of pathologic response to CSM in supine and upright 60 degrees positions. Positive results of CSM was obtained in 15 (34%) examined patients. Cardioinhibitory form of HCSS was recognized in 9 and mixed form in 6 cases. Pathologically augmented carotid sinus reflex was provoked in 8 cases by massage of the right, in 4 cases of the left and in 3 both carotid sinuses. Maximal time of electrical asystole after CSM was 6300 ms while maximal decreased od systolic blood pressure was 70 mmHg. Intravenous administration of propranolol caused decrease of systolic blood pressure approximately 43 +/- 15 mmHg whereas the cardioinhibitory effect of CSM after this drug significantly was increased only in patients with a positive response to CSM in the supine or upright 60 degrees positions. Autonomic inhibition significantly decreased the cardioinhibitory effect of CSM without significant influence on its vasodepressive component.", 
    "74": "Episodes of atrial fibrillation or flutter frequently complicate the postoperative course after coronary bypass surgery. A hundred and one patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery were randomized to oral pre- and postoperative treatment with sotalol, a non-selective beta-blocking agent with class-III antiarrhythmic properties (50 patients), or to half the preoperative beta-blocking dose according to the routine of the department (51 patients). Thus, there was no equipotency regarding beta blockade in the two groups. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was 10% in the sotalol group and 29% in the comparison group, p = 0.028. In 10% of the sotalol patients the dose had to be reduced or stopped compared to in none the group given routine treatment. The patients who developed atrial fibrillation were older, but otherwise there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Sotalol was effective in reducing the incidence of atrial fibrillation. However, careful titration of the optimal dose should be performed in order to avoid side effects of the beta blockade.", 
    "75": "As more headache sufferers seek medical care for their headaches, it is incumbent on physicians to consider all of a patient's medical illnesses in choosing therapy. The availability of new medications for headache will facilitate the tailoring of treatment to specific patient needs. The physician who treats patients with headache and concomitant medical problems must be knowledgeable about the pharmacology and adverse effects of these agents. This will permit the practitioner to use specific therapy, limit the number of medications prescribed, and prevent an exacerbation of either the medical condition or the headaches.", 
    "76": "The excessive or inappropriate response of the neuroendocrine system to impaired cardiac performance has become a major therapeutic target in heart failure. While the benefits of ACE inhibition and vasodilation are now established, and the necessary effects of diuretic therapy accepted, there is increasing evidence that in many patients additional benefit would follow modulation of the sympathetic nervous system. Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs improve survival following myocardial infarction and have improved patients with heart failure. Drugs such as carvedilol, which combine vasodilation mediated through alpha-adrenergic blockade with beta-adrenergic blockade have an attractive profile as they unite these two pharmacological actions in a way that may benefit patients with heart failure.", 
    "77": "Clinical experience indicates that carvedilol, a beta-blocker with vasodilating properties, is effective as once daily monotherapy in both young and elderly hypertensives. Titration is simple to an effective dosage, and response rates appear to be equivalent to those noted with other monotherapeutic agents presently recommended as initial therapy in hypertension. The drug is well tolerated by the majority of patients. No significant metabolic changes have been noted with carvedilol in short-term studies. Additional research is ongoing to determine the long-term effectiveness of this new antihypertensive agent.", 
    "78": "Previous studies have demonstrated pronounced ischemic zone myocardial concentrations of metoprolol following coronary venous retroinfusion in pigs with coronary artery ligation. The effect of coronary venous retroinfusion of metroprolol on myocardial infarct size was studied in 16 pentobarbital-anesthetized open-chest pigs undergoing 60-minute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by 3 hours of reperfusion. Pigs in the experimental group (n = 8) were given 0.4 mg/kg (1.0 mg/ml) of metroprolol via the anterior interventricular vein over a period of 5 minutes, beginning immediately after coronary occlusion followed by 0.2 mg/kg/hr intravenously. Control pigs (n = 8) received the same volume of saline as the treated group. The risk area and the necrotic area were assessed by monastral blue dye and triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining, respectively. Metoprolol did not influence hemodynamics. Plasma concentrations of metoprolol were within therapeutic levels. The administration of the beta-blocker resulted in a trend toward reduced norepinephrine concentrations, both in the aorta and coronary vein after coronary occlusion, but it did not prevent norepinephrine overflow following reperfusion. Infarct size expressed as a percentage of the risk area was 77 +/- 11% in the control group and 75 +/- 12% (mean +/- SD; NS) in the treated group. Thus, metoprolol retroinfusion did not reduce infarct size and did not prevent catecholamine overflow after reperfusion. It is concluded that the beneficial effects of metroprolol in acute infarction are probably unrelated to local beta-adrenergic blockade, at least in the pig, an animal with a paucity of coronary collateral blood flow.", 
    "79": "Beta-blockers with less cardiodepressive effect than traditional nonselective beta(1+2)-blocking agents could be useful in the treatment of hypertension, provided the reduction in blood pressure was satisfactory. Epanolol, a selective beta 1-receptor blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, induced a fall in intraarterial pressure of 8% at rest sitting and 11% during 100 W bicycle exercise after the first dose of 200 mg in 12 patients with essential hypertension. Heart rate, stroke index, and cardiac index initially fell by 14%, 11%, and 23%, respectively. The total peripheral resistance index increased by 21% after 2 hours, and then reverted towards the pretreatment level. After 10 months of epanolol treatment (mean 300 mg/day), the reduction in arterial pressure was 5% at rest and 10% during exercise. Cardiac index and heart rate were still reduced 14-21%, while total peripheral resistance was unchanged or slightly increased (2-10%). Twenty-four hour ambulatory blood pressure was higher on epanolol (300 mg/day) than on atenolol (150 mg/day) treatment (137/97 vs. 128/91 mmHg). Thus, the achieved blood pressure reduction induced by epanolol was moderate, while other characteristics of beta-receptor blockade, in particular, the reduction of heart rate and cardiac output, were maintained. This suggests that the compound may be useful for other cardiovascular disorders, e.g., angina pectoris in patients without hypertension or cardiac arrhythmia.", 
    "80": "Vagal stimulation of the stomach induces a relaxation mediated via non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) nerves. The neurotransmitter which is responsible for this relaxation is still unknown. To determine whether nitric oxide (NO) or a NO related substance mediates this relaxation, an intact guinea-pig stomach was mounted in an organ bath, with electrodes surrounding the vagal nerves. Electrical stimulation of the vagal nerves, in the presence of atropine, induced frequency dependent, tetrodotoxin-(TTX) sensitive relaxations of the stomach quantified as changes in volume. These relaxations were not affected by alpha- or beta-adrenoceptor antagonists or guanethidine. Thus they were evoked by non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) inhibitory nerves. The relaxant responses could be inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) a substance that inhibits the formation of nitric oxide (NO). Addition of L-arginine, the substrate for NO-synthase, reversed the L-NNA-induced-inhibition of the relaxation. Addition of nitroglycerin (a NO-donor) to a non-stimulated stomach mimicked the relaxations observed after vagal stimulation in a concentration dependent manner. These relaxations were insensitive to TTX. Relaxation of the stomach by vagal stimulation was prevented by an inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase, methylene blue, further supporting our conclusions. These data indicate that NO or a substance releasing NO plays an important role in NANC-neurotransmission after vagal stimulation of the guinea-pig stomach.", 
    "81": "beta-Adrenoceptor density and beta 1- and beta 2-subtype distribution were examined in hippocampi and cerebella from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD/SDAT). Tissues from age-, sex and post-mortem delay matched non-demented patients served as controls. The total beta-adrenoceptor density as evaluated in saturation experiments with the hydrophilic radioligand [3H]CGP 12177 was higher in hippocampal (36-39 fmol/mg protein) than cerebellar tissues (20-21 fmol/mg), however, no differences were found in either brain region between AD/SDAT patients and controls. Subtype distribution using the highly selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist CGP 20712A revealed a slightly higher proportion of beta 1-adrenoceptors in hippocampus (26%-27%) than in cerebellum (20%-21%) with, again, no difference between AD/SDAT and controls. We recently described a 40% reduction in basal and stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in post-mortem hippocampus of AD/SDAT patients, a brain region greatly affected by the disease, the present data now demonstrate that this disease-related effect is not mirrored by a similar change in beta-adrenoceptor density nor in subtype distribution.", 
    "82": "Treatment of hypertension in the elderly has hitherto been considered to be potentially dangerous. Three recent studies have clearly shown that in selected elderly hypertensives, blood pressure reduction very effectively reduces cardiovascular complications without causing unacceptable adverse effects. The impact on non-fatal stroke was most striking although a reduction in coronary events was also achieved. Thiazide diuretics were used in all three trials, and beta-blockers were used in two. Thiazide diuretics had a major beneficial effect. In this review the applicability of these results to the whole unselected population of elderly hypertensives is considered, and the choice of therapy in different subgroups of patients discussed.", 
    "83": "The aim was (1) to test the hypothesis that the prevention of haemodynamic deterioration decreases arrhythmia formation in the infarcting heart and augments the antiarrhythmic effects of beta blockade; and (2) to assess the ventricular fibrillation threshold as an index of innate arrhythmogenic propensity.",

    "85": "Changes in ventricular fibrillation threshold were determined for 50 min after anterior descending coronary artery occlusion in open chest pigs (group 1, n = 5). In group 2 (n = 9), ventricular fibrillation threshold was studied in the same way but cardiac output was maintained at 100 ml.min-1.kg-1 body weight and mean aortic pressure at 60(SEM 3) mm Hg by means of right heart and arterio-arterial bypass. In both groups intravenous propranolol 1.2 mg.kg-1 was injected 35-40 min after coronary artery occlusion. In group 3 (n = 6) spontaneous arrhythmias following coronary artery occlusion were recorded to test how well the ventricular fibrillation threshold reflected the incidence and time course of these arrhythmias.", 
    "86": "In group 1, there was a deep trough in ventricular fibrillation threshold--from 11.3(0.3) mA to 6.0(0.3) mA--within 10 min of coronary artery occlusion (47% decrease, p < 0.001). There was a shallower trough between 10 and 30 min. In group 2, preocclusion ventricular fibrillation threshold increased from 13.9(1.2) mA to 32.1(5.6) mA (p < 0.05) because of stabilised haemodynamics. After coronary occlusion, fibrillation threshold remained high throughout, being 22.7(1.3) mA and 20.4(1.1) mA at the times of the expected troughs (p < 0.005 v group 1 for both values). Propranolol increased ventricular fibrillation threshold by 24(7)% in group 1 (p < 0.05) and by 53(8)% in group 2 (p < 0.0005). In group 3 spontaneous arrhythmias followed a biphasic pattern, similar to group 1. There was a positive correlation between ventricular fibrillation threshold and arrhythmia score (r = 0.84).",

    "88": "The beta-adrenergic receptor, its occupancy and subsequent modulation of intracellular cAMP, and mRNA expression were characterized for the promonocytic leukemia cell line THP-1. We report that THP-1 cells appear to express a beta-1 receptor with a Kd of 1.8 +/- 0.3 x 10(-11) microM and a B max of 108 +/- 0.07 fmole/mg protein using 125I-iodocyanopindolol (125I-ICYP). The potency of various beta-adrenergic agonists to compete for the 125I-ICYP binding site followed the order: isoproterenol (0.8 microM) > dobutamine (2.1 microM) > salbutamol (3 microM) > epinephrine (3.8 microM) > soterenol (4.6 microM) > terbutaline (11.1 microM) > norepinephrine (13.8 microM). Occupancy of the beta receptor on THP-1 cells results in activation of adenyl cyclase suggesting that these cells have a functional beta-adrenergic receptor. This receptor also has specific immunoregulatory properties, reducing message levels for tumor necrosis factor--but not interleukin 1, following treatment with isoproterenol (approximate EC-50 of 0.01 microM). We conclude, based on the above criteria, that THP-1 cells express a beta-1 receptor which, following ligand binding, results in increased cAMP leading to downregulation of TNF expression.", 
    "89": "Nipradilol (3,4-dihydro-8-(2-hydroxy-3-isopropylamino) propoxy-3-nitroxy-2H-1-benzopyran) is a newly synthesized chemical agent designed to possess beta-adrenoceptor blocking and vasodilating actions. Nipradilol decreased left ventricular contractility index (Emax, slope of the ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relation), systolic pressure-volume area (PVA, a measure of ventricular total mechanical energy) and oxygen consumption in cross-circulated excised dog hearts. However, nipradilol did not decrease total coronary resistance. These results indicate that nipradilol, like propranolol, depresses myocardial mechanoenergetics and that the vasodilating action of nipradilol could not be detected in the present study.", 
    "90": "beta-Adrenoceptors in pig basilar arteries were investigated by measuring the relaxation response to norepinephrine and by a radioligand binding assay with [3H]-dihydroalprenolol (DHA). Norepinephrine induced concentration-dependent relaxations. The relaxation responses were independent of the presence of endothelial cells, and they were competitively antagonized by (+/-)-propranolol, atenolol, butoxamine and ICI 118,551. Specific [3H]-DHA binding to beta-adrenoceptors was saturable, reversible and high affinity (Kd = 1.4 nM), with a Bmax of 48.7 fmol/mg protein. Computer analysis of inhibition of [3H]-DHA binding by atenolol, butoxamine and ICI 118,551 gave a beta 1: beta 2-adrenoceptor ratio of approximately 65:35. The pA2 values of these antagonists were significantly correlated with the Ki values for beta 1-adrenoceptor determined by the radioligand binding assay. The present findings indicate that the relaxation responses to norepinephrine are predominantly mediated through the stimulation of beta 1-adrenoceptors on vascular smooth muscle cells in a pig basilar artery.", 
    "91": "Normobaric hyperoxia decreases heart rate (HR) in humans and animals. This study explored the mechanisms of hyperoxic bradycardia by examining its response time, autonomic neural mediation, and reversibility in conscious dogs. Five trained mongrel dogs breathed from a mask as the inspired gas was alternated between air and O2 for multiple cycles, and continuous time series records of HR and oxyhemoglobin saturation were recorded on a digital computer and analyzed by the technique of ensemble averaging. Hyperoxia decreased HR by 9% (P < 0.001), but only gradually, requiring 5 min to reach steady state. This delay was much longer than the time required for hyperoxic respiratory depression (10-20 s), a response known to be mediated by chemoreceptor reflexes. The bradycardia was sustained for > or = 30 min. On return to normoxia, HR gradually returned toward, but failed to reach, the baseline HR, suggesting incomplete reversibility of the response. However, in control experiments without hyperoxic challenge, HR showed a slow continuous downward trend that was sufficient to account for the apparent incomplete reversibility of hyperoxic bradycardia. Hyperoxic bradycardia was unaffected by beta-adrenergic blockade but was completely prevented by muscarinic cholinergic blockade. We conclude that 1) hyperoxia-induced bradycardia in conscious dogs is mediated by efferents of the vagus nerve; 2) its afferent pathway remains unknown, but its long response time suggests mechanisms other than chemoreceptor reflexes or other known neural reflexes; and 3) it is completely reversible.", 
    "92": "The antihypertensive, biochemical and adverse effects of captopril, hydralazine, nifedipine and placebo were compared in 160 patients with BP inadequately controlled by atenolol 100 mg daily plus bendrofluazide 5 mg daily. Treatments were given for up to 12 weeks. Beta-blocker and thiazide were continued unchanged. All three active drugs reduced supine BP relative to placebo; mean BP changes attributable to active treatment (95% confidence intervals): captopril 13.4/10.3 mmHg (0.6/4.0 to 26.2/16.6), hydralazine 15.0/10.0 mmHg (1.7/3.4 to 28.3/16.6), nifedipine 16.8/8.1 mmHg (4.0/1.8 to 29.6/14.4). There were no significant differences between the agents. Results for erect BP were similar. Target BP (< 140/95 mmHg) was achieved more frequently on captopril (33%), hydralazine (29%) and nifedipine (17%) than on placebo (10%). Compared with the other treatments captopril increased serum potassium concentration (P = 0.01), and hydralazine reduced serum cholesterol concentration (median changes: captopril -0.2 mmol/l, hydralazine -0.8 mmol/l, nifedipine -0.2 mmol/l, and placebo +0.2 mmol/l, P < 0.001). Overall, side-effects did not differ significantly between the groups; withdrawals resulting from adverse reactions: captopril 15%, hydralazine 24%, nifedipine 22%, and placebo 3% (chi 2 = 8.2, P = 0.04). Captopril, hydralazine and nifedipine did not differ significantly in efficacy and tolerability when added to atenolol and bendrofluazide. However, there were trends in favour of captopril, on which drug the highest proportion of patients had their BP controlled and the lowest proportion were withdrawn because of side-effects. Thus, of the drugs tested, captopril appears to be the best option as third drug in hypertension.", 
    "93": "1. This study has explored the mechanism underlying the long duration of action of the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, salmeterol. 2. Salmeterol, salbutamol and isoprenaline caused a concentration-related inhibition of electrically-induced contractile responses of the guinea-pig superfused trachea preparation. The effects of both isoprenaline and salbutamol were rapid in onset and rapidly reversed upon removal of the agonist. In contrast, the effects of salmeterol were slower in onset and could not be reversed by superfusion of the tissue with agonist-free Krebs solution even for periods of up to 10 h. 3. The effects of salmeterol were, however, readily reversed by a number of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, as was the effect of a continuous infusion of isoprenaline. Upon removal of the antagonist, however, the effects of salmeterol and of the isoprenaline infusion were reasserted at a rate which was inversely related to the lipophilicity of a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs. 4. Salmeterol inhibited the binding of [125I]-(-)-iodopindolol (100 pM) to rat lung membranes (pIC50 7.1), with isoprenaline (pIC50 6.2) and salbutamol (pIC50 5.1) having lower potencies. The inhibition of binding by salmeterol was apparently non-competitive, whereas that produced by salbutamol and isoprenaline was competitive in nature. 5. Isoprenaline and salbutamol rapidly dissociated from their binding sites, whereas in marked contrast, the binding of salmeterol showed no dissociation for periods of up to 1 h. 6. These data are consistent with the mechanism in which salmeterol binds adjacent to the active site of the beta 2-adrenoceptor, such that the drug cannot be washed out of the tissue, yet can interact with and activate the receptor. This latter property is susceptible to antagonism by beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs but is reassured when the antagonists are removed.", 
    "94": "In some blood vessels, the alpha 2-adrenergic agonist clonidine simultaneously activates vasoconstrictive alpha-adrenoceptors on smooth muscle cells and endothelial alpha 2-adrenoceptors mediating release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), with the net vascular response representing a balance between these two counteracting pathways. To investigate whether clonidine's modest constrictor effect in human veins is due to simultaneous release of EDRF, the dorsal hand vein compliance technique was used to measure vascular responses in healthy volunteers. Clonidine-induced venoconstriction was not potentiated by methylene blue, an inhibitor of EDRF-mediated relaxation. After preconstriction with angiotensin II, clonidine did not cause venodilation but rather promoted further constriction, which could be reversed by the alpha 1-antagonist labetalol. However, in veins preconstricted with the full alpha 1-agonist phenylephrine, clonidine induced venodilation, suggesting that clonidine is a partial agonist at venous alpha 1-adrenoceptors. In conclusion, we found no evidence for endothelial alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated release of EDRF in human hand veins. The results further suggest that postjunctional alpha 1-adrenoceptors participate in clonidine-induced venoconstriction in humans.", 
    "95": "We investigated the effects of an alpha 1-adrenoceptor (phenylephrine) and a purinoceptor agonist (ATP), both of which accelerate the phosphoinositide turnover, on the Na-H antiport activity of rat single cardiac cells using the pH-sensitive fluorescent indicator seminaphthorhodafluor-1 (SNARF-1). Both phenylephrine, in the presence of a beta-adrenoceptor blocker, and ATP enhanced the ability of the cell to regulate its intracellular pH (pHi) after an imposed acid load. This effect was observed in HCO3-free N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) and prevented by Na-H antiport inhibitors ethylisopropylamiloride (EIPA) or amiloride. Similar results were obtained when cells were bathed in an acidic extracellular medium. Hence, the alpha 1-adrenoceptor and purinoceptor agonists activate the Na-H antiport even when it is partially inhibited by extracellular protons. To further evaluate the effects of the two neurohormones, the rate of proton efflux was estimated as a function of the magnitude of the imposed acid load. The results indicate that the agonist-induced modulation of the Na-H antiport is caused by an acceleration of its exchange activity and by a shift of its dependence on pHi toward more alkaline pH values. The agonist-mediated stimulation of the antiport was also observed in partially depolarized cells and was not dependent on intracellular Ca. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was not able to reproduce the effects of the agonists on the Na-H antiport. Conversely, the inhibitors of protein kinase C did not prevent the activation of the antiport by the neurohormones. Thus our data suggest that neither a Ca-calmodulin-dependent kinase nor protein kinase C is responsible for the alpha 1-adrenoceptor- and purinoceptor-mediated stimulation of the antiport.", 
    "96": "In previous publications from our laboratory it was shown that catecholamines (CA) injected intraperitoneally (IP) to fasted rats induce a transient inhibition of food intake. This effect seems to be both alpha- and beta-adrenergic. According to more recent data (20), IP CA also reduced water intake in water-deprived rats, and the effect is exclusively alpha-adrenergic. In order to obtain more information on the adrenergic specificity of the two inhibitory effects we measured the amount of food and water ingested during 30 min by male and female rats previously deprived of both food and water for 18 h. Three adrenergic agonists (norepinephrine, isoproterenol, and salbutamol) were injected IP after the administration (IP) of the following adrenergic antagonists: phentolamine, prazosin, yohimbine, propranolol, or metoprolol. Results showed that, under these experimental conditions, water intake inhibition was due exclusively to an alpha 1 effect, whereas food intake inhibition seemed to depend on alpha 1 and beta 1 actions plus some beta 2 participation. It is also suggested that blocking one type of receptors may enhance the responsiveness of the other type.", 
    "97": "It has been demonstrated that beta-adrenergic antagonists and nitrovasodilators reduce portal pressure in patients with portal hypertension. Thus, the hemodynamic effects of nipradilol, a new beta-adrenergic antagonist combined with a nitroxy base, was studied in conscious and unrestrained rats in two models of portal hypertension. The hemodynamic effects were compared to those obtained after propranolol administration. Both nipradilol (20 mg/kg) and propranolol (20 mg/kg) significantly decreased portal pressure in both groups of portal hypertensive rats. In cirrhotic rats, nipradilol decreased portal pressure (-24 +/- 2%) more than propranolol (-9 +/- 2%). Both nipradilol and propranolol significantly decreased portal tributary blood flow and cardiac index in both groups. Changes in portal tributary blood flow and cardiac index were not significantly different between nipradilol and propranolol. Propranolol, but not nipradilol significantly increased hepatocollateral resistance in cirrhotic rats but not in portal vein stenosed rats. Thus, the marked reduction of portal pressure after nipradilol administration depends in part on a limited increase in hepatocollateral resistance. Nipradilol significantly decreased mean arterial pressure, while propranolol did not change this value in either groups. In conclusion, nipradilol markedly decreased portal pressure in rats with portal hypertension. This beneficial effect suggests that nipradilol should be tested in the patients with portal hypertension.", 
    "98": "The effects of epanolol (200 mg once daily) and diltiazem (60 mg three times daily) on the response of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) to exercise were investigated in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study in 16 patients with angina pectoris. Exercise tolerance as assessed by peak oxygen consumption was similar with all treatments. Peak heart rate (mean and 95% confidence intervals) was lower (P < 0.05) with epanolol (121 (115-130) beats min-1) than with diltiazem (137 (126-148) beats min-1) or placebo (141 (130-152) beats min-1). ANP did not change from resting values with placebo or diltiazem, but rose significantly (P < 0.05) with epanolol from 19.7 (13.0-29.8) pg ml-1 (geometric mean and 95% confidence intervals) during supine rest to 49.6 (33.7-73.0) pg ml-1 at peak exercise. Since ANP release is stimulated by atrial distension, patients with untreated angina may stop exercise before atrial dilatation occurs. With beta-adrenoceptor blockade, a reduction in peak heart rate may necessitate increased chamber volumes to maintain cardiac output, accounting for the rise in ANP.", 
    "99": "The prognostic value of a normal exercise thallium-201 scintigram was determined in 211 patients with a normal exercise and resting scintigram. Endpoints were sudden cardiac death, non-fatal acute myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Forty patients (19%) had a history of a previous myocardial infarction and 40 (19%) were known to have had a previous percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting. Sixty-four patients (31%) were on treatment with beta-blocking agents. After a mean follow-up period of 23.5 months, 22 patients had had a cardiac event (1 cardiac death, 6 myocardial infarction, 15 revascularization). For the total group, the 1-year event rate for cardiac death, myocardial infarction, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting was 7.0%. For cardiac death or myocardial infarction alone the event rate was 2.8%. The only parameter independently predictive for cardiac events was the regular use of beta-blocking agents. The high event rate in patients on beta-blocking treatment is partly due to the fact that these patients were more symptomatic for coronary artery disease. The sustained beta-adrenergic blockade in this patient group, even in patients advised to stop medication, was suspected to interfere with the results of 201Tl scintigraphy. Therefore, more attention should be paid to patient instruction regarding the discontinuation of medication before the test.", 
    "100": "Spinal cord perfusion pressure may be reduced when sodium nitroprusside is used to control proximal aortic hypertension during thoracic aortic clamping. The effect of esmolol infusion on spinal cord perfusion pressure during thoracic aortic clamping is unknown. This study compares spinal cord perfusion pressure following control of proximal hypertension with either sodium nitroprusside or esmolol during thoracic aortic clamping.", 
    "101": "The thoracic aorta was cross-clamped for 30 min in 18 dogs anesthetized with halothane. A control group (n = 6) received no treatment of proximal hypertension during cross-clamping. In two other groups, proximal arterial pressure was controlled (100 mmHg) by infusion of either sodium nitroprusside (n = 6) or esmolol (n = 6). Brachial and femoral arterial pressures, spinal cord perfusion pressure, pulmonary artery occlusion, central venous pressures, and cardiac output were monitored. Neurologic assessment was performed 24 h following surgery.", 
    "102": "Femoral arterial pressure was lower with nitroprusside (14 +/- 3 mmHg) compared to esmolol (24 +/- 4 mmHg) after 15 min of aortic cross-clamping. Cerebrospinal fluid pressure increased during aortic cross-clamping in the sodium nitroprusside group (from 7 +/- 5 to 16 +/- 6 mmHg) but not in esmolol or control groups. Spinal cord perfusion pressure was lower with nitroprusside at 15 min of aortic cross-clamping (2 +/- 4 mmHg) compared to control (15 +/- 7 mmHg) and esmolol groups (17 +/- 11 mmHg). Esmolol infusion reduced cardiac output and increased ventricular filling pressures compared to control and nitroprusside groups.", 
    "103": "Esmolol was associated with greater spinal cord perfusion pressure, but adverse hemodynamic effects, when compared with nitroprusside during thoracic aortic cross-clamping. When only surviving dogs (4 control, 5 esmolol, 6 nitroprusside) are considered, the incidence of neurologic deficit was greater in nitroprusside-treated dogs than in either control or esmolol-treated dogs. No difference in outcome was present when all dogs are considered.", 
    "104": "In the present experiments, we studied the effect of i.t. nicotine on synovial bradykinin-induced plasma extravasation (BK-PE), assessed by measurement of extravasation of Evan's blue dye into the rat knee joint. We report that in normal rats, i.t. nicotine dose-dependently inhibited BK-PE; the dose required was 100 times greater than the effective s.c. dose. In adrenal medullectomized rats, i.t. nicotine inhibited BK-PE at doses 10(6) times smaller than in rats with intact adrenal medullae. A similar leftward shift in the i.t. nicotine dose-response curve was seen in normal rats after blocking peripheral nicotinic receptors by hexamethonium or after bilateral denervation of the adrenal medulla. Intra-articular infusion of the knee joint in normal rats with knee joint perfusate collected from donor rats that had received i.t. nicotine decreased BK-PE significantly. Denervation of the sciatic nerves in the donor rat did not affect this action of i.t. nicotine. Perfusate collected from adrenal medullectomized donor rats that had received i.t. nicotine resulted in a greater decrease of BK-PE compared to the decrease produced by perfusate from normal donor rats that received i.t. nicotine. Intra-articular pretreatment of recipient rats with different receptor antagonists [phentolamine (alpha adrenoceptors), ICI-118,551 (beta 2 adrenoceptors), methysergide (serotoninergic S1/2 receptors) or naloxone (opioid receptors)] did not affect the BK-PE response produced by this perfusate. Nicotine, when administered i.t., can inhibit synovial BK-PE, but this effect is expressed only at high doses in the presence of an intact adrenal medulla.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "105": "The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms by which glucocorticoids inhibit GH secretion in man. In 10 normal volunteers subjects we compared the pattern of GHRH-induced GH release to that elicited by similar challenge given 60 min after a pretreatment with drugs affecting adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic neurotransmission, both in basal situations and after having induced hypercortisolism. In a first study (P), synthetic GHRH [GRF-(1-29); 1 microgram/kg, i.v.] was administered 60 min after giving placebo. In other experiments, the administration of propranolol (PRO; 40 mg, orally), or clonidine (CLO; 0.300 mg, orally), or pyridostigmine (PD; 120 mg, orally) was followed by GHRH administration 60 min later. These experiments were repeated after giving a nocturnal dose of dexamethasone (DEX; 8 mg, orally at 2300 h). The administration of DEX significantly (P < 0.05) blunted the GH response to GHRH (peaks: 10.7 +/- 3.9 vs. 20.3 +/- 5.5 micrograms/L; DEX vs. P study, respectively). Conversely, either beta-adrenergic blockade (PRO), or alpha 2-adrenergic agonism (CLO), or the enhancement of muscarinic cholinergic tone (PD) significantly increased the GH response to GHRH (peaks: 43 +/- 4.6, 55.6 +/- 5.6 and 51.2 +/- 7, micrograms/L; PRO, CLO, and PD, respectively; P < 0.01 vs. P study). After nocturnal DEX administration, both PRO and CLO, but not PD, were able to reverse the inhibitory effect of DEX on GHRH-elicited GH release (peaks: 39 +/- 5.5, 25.9 +/- 3.9 and 12.9 +/- 3.1, micrograms/L; DEX + PRO, DEX + CLO, and DEX + PD, respectively). However, whereas the potentiating effect of PRO on GHRH-elicited GH release was still observed under hypercortisolism, it was lacking for both CLO and PD when these drugs were given in this situation. These data suggest that the inhibitory effect of glucocorticoid excess on GH release is due to increased hypothalamic somatostatin secretion which appears to be dependent on DEX-induced enhanced beta-adrenergic responsiveness. Moreover, the data further support a major role of hypothalamic alpha 2-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic activities in GH neuroregulation in man.", 
    "106": "Binding sites labeled by the beta-adrenergic receptor radioligand (-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol ([125I]ICYP) and the selective D1-subtype dopamine (DA) receptor radioligand (+)-[125I]SCH 23982 were identified on immortalized hypothalamic GnRH neurons (GT1-7 cell lines). Saturation analyses in crude particulate suspensions of GT1 cells described high affinity and low capacity binding sites for [125I]ICYP (Kd, 41 pM; binding capacity, 25 fmol/mg protein) and [125I]SCH 23982 (Kd, 320 pM; binding capacity, 23 fmol/mg protein). These binding sites were further characterized in competition assays using a variety of agonists and antagonists selective for either beta-adrenergic or DA receptor subtypes. The pharmacological profiles of [125I]ICYP and [125I]SCH 23982 binding obtained from these studies indicated that the radioligands were labeling beta 1-adrenergic and D1-dopaminergic receptor sites, respectively. Northern blot analyses of purified GT1 cell mRNA documented the expression of D1-dopaminergic and beta 1-adrenergic receptor mRNAs. beta 2-Adrenergic receptor mRNA was not identified. All three transcripts were detected in mouse brain mRNA. Both beta 1-adrenergic and D1-receptors were discovered to be positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase. DA and the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol each provoked a rapid and marked stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity in GT1 cell membrane suspensions. Subtype-selective beta-adrenergic and DA receptor antagonists were used to inhibit isoproterenol- and DA-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities. Their relative potencies indicated that the isoproterenol stimulation was mediated via the beta 1-adrenergic receptor. The DA-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was mediated via the D1-DA receptor. These studies have identified functional beta 1-adrenergic and D1-dopaminergic receptors positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase on GT1 GnRH neurosecretory cells. The existence of these receptors suggests that the noradrenergic and dopaminergic regulation of gonadotropin secretion may be mediated at least in part via direct synapses on GnRH neurons.", 
    "107": "Peptide-YY-(1-36) [PYY-(1-36)] is an endocrine peptide that is found primarily in the mucosal layer of the colon. We reported previously that a direct intracolonic (IC) infusion of amino acids in dogs resulted in a robust release of PYY compared to other nutrients (fat, glucose, and protein). The objective of this study was to investigate the possible mechanisms underlying the release of PYY in response to IC infusion of amino acids. Intracolonic infusion of a mixture of tryptophan and phenylalanine (Trp+Phe; 100 mM; 200 ml/h) resulted in a significant release of PYY [integrated PYY release, 74.5 +/- 14.0 ng (0-120 min)/ml], which was not affected by iv atropine, hexamethonium, or propranolol treatment. Intravenous infusion of Trp+Phe failed to release PYY [integrated PYY release, -0.6 +/- 0.9 ng (0-120 min)/ml]. Intracolonic infusion of aromatic amino acids (Trp+Phe) was more potent in releasing PYY than aliphatic (leucine and glycine) and charged (arginine) amino acids. PYY release in response to IC infusion of the deamino and decarboxylated forms of Phe was significantly (P < 0.05) decreased [integrated PYY release, 17.5 +/- 2.6 and 12.1 +/- 2.8 ng (0-120 min)/ml, respectively] compared to that in response to intact Phe [integrated PYY release, 39.4 +/- 4.3 ng (0-120 min)/ml]. These results suggest that 1) PYY release in response to IC administered amino acids is independent of ganglionic, cholinergic, and beta-adrenergic transmission; 2) PYY release in response to IC amino acids is due to a direct contact of amino acids with the luminal pole of PYY cells in the colon and is not the result of a stimulatory action of amino acids via the general circulation; and 3) the amino and carboxylic groups of an amino acid as well as the ring structures of aromatic amino acids are structural requirements for PYY release.", 
    "108": "beta-Adrenergic blockade is known to improve the survival of patients after acute myocardial infarction and to reduce myocardial infarct size in experimental coronary occlusion. However, the effects of beta-blockade on global and regional left ventricular (LV) remodeling have not been characterized after coronary occlusion with reperfusion. In rats subjected to coronary occlusion and reperfusion, we have demonstrated beneficial effects of reperfusion in sedentary rats with a hypertrophic response to exercise in the surviving outer wall of the infarcted zone, and in this study we investigated whether such remodeling is modified by beta-blockade in both sedentary and exercised rats.", 
    "109": "Female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into groups at 5 days after 45 minutes of left coronary artery occlusion followed by reperfusion to produce nontransmural infarction. Animals completing the experiment included a propranolol-treated sedentary group (750 mg/l drinking water) (n = 20) and a propranolol-treated exercised group (n = 19), and these groups were compared with two groups of simultaneously randomized rats (which were also part of a separate study): an untreated sedentary group (n = 21) and an untreated exercised group (n = 20). After 3 weeks of intervention, global and regional LV morphological changes were analyzed in 78 completed experiments from midventricular transverse slices of hearts after perfusion fixation. Compared with sedentary untreated rats, propranolol-treated sedentary rats showed significantly increased LV cavity area (41.6 versus 31.5 mm2, p < 0.001) and reduced wall thicknesses in the noninfarcted (1.77 versus 1.95 mm, p < 0.01) and infarcted regions (1.29 versus 1.36 mm, p < 0.01) (two-way ANOVA). In the propranolol-treated rats, exercise further increased the LV cavity area (44.6 versus 39.1 mm2, p < 0.001), reduced the noninfarcted wall thickness (1.62 versus 1.81 mm, p < 0.01), and increased the LV dimension/wall thickness ratio in the noninfarcted region (4.7 versus 3.95 mm, p < 0.001). Whereas exercise in the reperfused group in the absence of beta-blockade significantly increased the viable subepicardial area of the infarcted zone, as reported elsewhere, propranolol treatment prevented this exercise-induced increase of subepicardial area (7.8 rest versus 7.7 mm2 exercise, NS), and there was a significant reduction of total myocardial area in the propranolol-treated exercised group compared with the untreated exercised group (p < 0.05). Corresponding trends in LV weights were not statistically significant.", 
    "110": "These findings provide evidence for altered LV remodeling, including LV cavity dilation and reduced wall thickness, after 3 weeks of propranolol treatment in sedentary rats after coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion to produce nontransmural infarction. In addition, after 3 weeks of exercise together with propranolol treatment, morphological changes were consistent with suppression of exercise-induced myocardial hypertrophy globally and in the viable outer wall of the infarcted region, accompanied by further LV cavity dilation.", 
    "111": "Several studies performed before the advent of thrombolysis have shown that the presence of ventricular arrhythmias is an independent risk factor for subsequent mortality in patients recovering from acute myocardial infarction. Since fibrinolysis affects the natural history of infarction and may alter the clinical relevance of different risk factors, the aim of the present study was to establish the prevalence and prognostic value of ventricular arrhythmias in post-myocardial infarction patients treated with fibrinolytic agents during the acute phase.", 
    "112": "Twenty-four-hour Holter recordings obtained before discharge from the hospital in 8,676 post-myocardial infarction patients of the GISSI-2 study were analyzed for the presence of ventricular arrhythmias. Patients were followed for 6 months from the acute event; total and sudden cardiovascular mortality rates were computed, and relative risks in univariate and multivariate analyses were calculated. Ventricular arrhythmias were present in 64.1% of the patients, more than 10 premature ventricular beats per hour were recorded in 19.7% of the patients, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was present in 6.8% of the patients. Ventricular arrhythmias were more frequent when signs or symptoms of left ventricular damage were present. During follow-up, there was a total of 256 deaths 2.0% in patients without ventricular arrhythmias, 2.7% in patients with one to 10 premature ventricular beats per hour, 5.5% in those with more than 10 premature ventricular beats per hour, and 4.8% in those with complex premature ventricular beats. Even after adjusting for several risk factors, the presence of frequent (more than 10 premature ventricular beats per hour) ventricular arrhythmias remained a significant predictor of total (RRCox, 1.62; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-2.26) and sudden mortality (RRCox, 2.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-4.08). On the other hand, the presence of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was not associated with a worsening of the prognosis in the adjusted analysis (RRCox, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-1.79).", 
    "113": "This study shows that approximately 36% of patients recovering from acute myocardial infarction presented with less than one premature ventricular beat per hour in Holter recordings obtained before discharge from the hospital, whereas almost 20% of patients showed frequent (more than 10 premature ventricular beats per hour) ventricular arrhythmias. Due to the large size of the population of this study, these figures may be used as a reliable estimate of the prevalence of arrhythmias in postinfarction patients treated with fibrinolytic agents during the acute phase. Frequent premature ventricular beats are confirmed as independent risk factors of total and sudden death in the first 6 months following the acute event; the significance of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in this population appears more controversial.", 
    "114": "Vascular permeability was significantly increased in the incisor pulp and skin of the lower lip in the rat after antidromic electrical stimulation of the inferior alveolar nerve, and this response was significantly inhibited by a substance-P antagonist. The content of substance P in the pulp and lip was also increased after stimulation. The permeability response was reduced by aspirin and bradykinin antagonists (both B1- and B2-receptor types) in the pulp and lip, indicating that prostaglandins and bradykinin may be involved. Mepyramine and methysergide inhibited the vascular response in the lip but not the pulp; the roles of histamine and serotonin differ in the two tissues. Injection of substance P into the incisor pulp and the lip skin caused dye leakage. This response was inhibited by pretreatment with compound 48/80 in the lip but not the pulp. Lip histamine content was decreased significantly after antidromic stimulation of the inferior alveolar nerve and pretreatment with compound 48/80, but was not changed in the pulp. The results suggest that substance P in the lip, after being released from the peripheral sensory-nerve endings, may act on the vascular system via histamine release from mast cells; but in the pulp may cause vascular response directly because of the scarcity of mast cells."
