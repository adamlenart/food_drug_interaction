    "8": "Some Clostridium difficile strains produce, in addition to toxins A and B, the binary toxin Clostridium difficile transferase (CDT), which ADP-ribosylates actin and may contribute to the hypervirulence of these strains. The separate binding and translocation component CDTb mediates transport of the enzyme component CDTa into mammalian target cells. CDTb binds to its receptor on the cell surface, CDTa assembles and CDTb/CDTa complexes are internalised. In acidic endosomes, CDTb mediates the delivery of CDTa into the cytosol, most likely by forming a translocation pore in endosomal membranes. We demonstrate that a seven-fold symmetrical positively charged \u03b2-cyclodextrin derivative, per-6-S-(3-aminomethyl)benzylthio-\u03b2-cyclodextrin, which was developed earlier as a potent inhibitor of the translocation pores of related binary toxins of Bacillus anthracis, Clostridium botulinum and Clostridium perfringens, protects cells from intoxication with CDT. The pore blocker did not interfere with the CDTa-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of actin or toxin binding to Vero cells but inhibited the pH-dependent membrane translocation of CDTa into the cytosol. In conclusion, the cationic \u03b2-cyclodextrin could serve as the lead compound in a development of novel pharmacological strategies against the CDT-producing strains of C. difficile.",

However, because she developed adult-onset asthma we tried to switch propranolol, a nonselective beta-blocker, to beta-1-cardioselective agents, bisoprolol and metoprolol.

From these studies, the picture has emerged that dual blockade is hardly effective and increases the risk of hyperkalaemia and renal failure. Background use of beta blockers - little recognised indirect renin inhibitors - may play a role in the detrimental effects of dual blockade.

It remains unclear whether the differentiations of ES cells and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells rely on similar molecular mechanisms. In addition, no previous studies have shown that human iPS cells express \u03b2-adrenoceptors. Therefore, in the present study, we determined the involvement of \u03b2-adrenoceptors in the differentiation of human iPS cells into mesodermal progenitor cells. The induction of differentiation of human iPS cells into kinase insert domain receptor (KDR)-positive mesodermal progenitor cells was performed on feeder cells in a differentiation medium with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP-4), and activin A. When the iPS cells that were exposed to bFGF, BMP-4, and activin A were treated with L-isoproterenol (a \u03b2-adrenoceptor agonist) for 4 days, the expression of KDR was significantly increased compared to that in the cells that were not treated with L-isoproterenol. Pretreatment of the cells with either atenolol (a \u03b21-adrenoceptor antagonist) or ICI-118551 (a \u03b22-adrenoceptor antagonist) significantly inhibited the L-isoproterenol-induced increase in KDR expression. In addition, pretreatment with both H89 (a protein kinase A inhibitor) and SB203580 (a p38 MAPK inhibitor) significantly inhibited the L-isoproterenol-induced increase in KDR expression. Treatment with L-isoproterenol enhanced the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in human iPS cells exposed to bFGF, BMP-4, and activin A. These results suggest that \u03b2-adrenoceptor stimulation in human iPS cells may enhance their differentiation into mesodermal progenitor cells via the activation of either protein kinase A or p38 MAPK.",

Prills, providing controlled and immediate drug release, were processed and finally combined in capsules yielding a fixed-dose combination. Metoprolol tartrate (MPT) and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) were used as controlled and immediate release model drugs, respectively. These drugs were embedded in matrices composed of fatty acids and polyethylene glycol (PEG). In order to tailor drug release from the prills, the type of fatty acid, the PEG molecular weight and the fatty acid/PEG ratio were varied. To provide controlled drug release, MPT was embedded in matrices containing PEG and behenic acid. Using different PEG molecular weights (PEG 4000, 6000 and 10,000), MPT release could be tailored over a wide range. To obtain immediate release, HCT was incorporated in matrices composed of PEG and stearic acid. Since high amounts (at least 60%) of PEG were needed for acceptable immediate release, HCT release was independent on PEG molecular weight. Solid state characterization revealed that MPT crystallinity was decreased, while HCT was molecularly dispersed throughout the matrix. Drug release of both MPT and HCT prills was stable during storage. Compared to a fixed-dose reference, oral co-administration of the MPT and HCT prills to dogs yielded a similar bioavailability for the HCT prills, while the MPT prills resulted in a significant higher bioavailability.", 
    "38": "Summary A 19-year-old woman with asphyxiation complicated by cardiac arrest, following an unsuccessful suicide attempt by hanging, developed an uncommon complication of trauma-induced thyroid storm. She was initially admitted to the intensive care unit intubated and mechanically ventilated for postcardiac arrest management. Investigation of thyroid storm was pursued after the patient was noted to be persistently hypertensive, tachycardic and agitated despite high levels of sedation. Thyroid function tests confirmed the clinical suspicion of progressive thyrotoxicosis, with associated imaging consistent with thyroid inflammation secondary to band-like traumatic pressure to the lower half of the thyroid gland. Treatment with \u03b2-blockers and a thionamide resulted in the eventual resolution of her thyroid storm state and normalisation of her thyroid function. We conclude that traumatically induced thyroid storm should be considered in all hypermetabolic patients following blunt neck injuries including hanging, and that traditional treatment of hyperthyroidism can be successfully applied.",

As there have been no randomized trials of treatment for TRH, the physician confronted with such cases must devise treatments on the basis of observational data and pathophysiological reasoning (volume status considering renin levels, sympathetic blockade, vasodilatation).

The precise mechanisms underlying H2S-related events, including the producing enzymes and target molecules in gastrointestinal tissues, have not been elucidated in detail. We herein examined the involvement of H2S in contractions induced by repeated electrical stimulations (ES). ES-induced contractions were neurotoxin-sensitive and increased by aminooxyacetic acid, an inhibitor of cystathionine \u03b2-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine \u03b3-lyase, but not by D,L-propargylglycine, a selective inhibitor of cystathionine \u03b3-lyase, in an ES trial-dependent manner. ES-induced contractions were markedly decreased in the presence of L-cysteine. This response was inhibited by aminooxyacetic acid and an antioxidant, and accelerated by L-methionine, an activator of CBS. The existence of CBS was confirmed. NaHS transiently inhibited ES- and acetylcholine-induced contractions, and sustainably decreased basal tone for at least 20 min after its addition. The treatment with glibenclamide, an ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker, reduced both the L-cysteine response and NaHS-induced inhibition of contractions. The NaHS-induced decrease in basal tone was inhibited by apamin, a small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel blocker. These results suggest that H2S may be endogenously produced via CBS in ES-activated enteric neurons, and regulates contractility via multiple K+ channels in the ileum.",

The co-treatment of Phentolamine, I127, LY294002 and L-NAME with NE blocked the effects of NE on EPCs proliferation and migration. Treatment with NE significantly increased phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS of EPCs. Addition of phentolamine and I127 attenuated the activation of Akt/eNOS pathway, but metoprolol could not.

Cox's proportional hazards model was used to assess the hazard ratio for mortality at 5 years. Heart rate was categorized into 4 groups by quartiles (<60, 61-67, 68-75, >75 beats per minute). High heart rate was defined as \u226575 beats per minute. Landmark analysis was performed at 1 year.",

In the AAI group, a high degree atrioventricular block occurred on average after 46.3 \u00b1 8.8 months and its incidence was estimated at 0.85% per year. Atrial fibrillation (AF) developed in 8 patients in the AAI group and 81 patients in the DDD group (p = 0.23). Among aetiological factors of an increased risk of developing AF, only the presence of tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome (hazard ratio [HR] 11.31) and the absence of antiarrhythmic therapy (HR 4.23) significantly increased the risk of AF. Urgent reoperation was needed in 23 patients in the AAI group and 62 patients in the DDD group (p < 0.01). Log-rank test analysis showed a significant effect of the development of AF on the risk of reoperation in this group (p = 0.0420). Lead-related complications were noted in 6 patients in the AAI group and 49 patients in the DDD group (p = 0.94).

DDD and AAI groups did not differ significantly in terms of survival, development of persistent AF, and lead-related complications. 3. Tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome and the lack of antiarrhythmic treatment with beta-blocker and amiodarone increased the risk of persistent AF during long-term follow-up. 4.

The seven RCTs included four hydrocortisone studies, three propranolol studies (of which one study had a third arm investigating gabapentin), and single trials of escitalopram and temazepam. Outcome assessment measures included the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the Center for Epidemiological Studies - Depression Scale (CES-D).In four trials with 165 participants there was moderate quality evidence for the efficacy of hydrocortisone in preventing the onset of PTSD (risk ratio (RR) 0.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 0.56; P value = 0.004), indicating that between seven and 13 patients would need to be treated with this agent in order to prevent the onset of PTSD in one patient. There was low quality evidence for preventing the onset of PTSD in three trials with 118 participants treated with propranolol (RR 0.62; 95% CI 0.24 to 1.59; P value = 0.32). Drop-outs due to treatment-emergent side effects, where reported, were low for all of the agents tested. Three of the four RCTs of hydrocortisone reported that medication was more effective than placebo in reducing PTSD symptoms after a median of 4.5 months after the event. None of the single trials of escitalopram, temazepam and gabapentin demonstrated evidence that medication was superior to placebo in preventing the onset of PTSD.Seven of the included RCTs were at a high risk of bias. Differential drop-outs between groups undermined the results of three studies, while one study failed to describe how the allocation of medication was concealed.

The principle objective of the present work, therefore, is to evaluate the adsorption behavior of three ionizable, polar compounds occurring in different forms: cationic (propranolol - PRO), anionic (sulfisoxazole - SSX) and neutral (sulfaguanidine - SGD) onto soil under various temperature conditions. The adsorption thermodynamics of these researched compounds were extensively investigated using parameters such as enthalpy change (\u0394H\u00b0), Gibbs free energy change (\u0394G\u00b0) as well as entropy change (\u0394S\u00b0). These calculations reveal that sorption of PRO is exothermic, spontaneous and enthalpy driven, sorption of SGD is endothermic, spontaneous and entropy driven whereas sorption of SSX is endothermic, spontaneous only above the temperature of 303.15K and entropy driven. Furthermore, we submit that the calculated values yield valuable information regarding the sorption mechanism of PRO, SGD and SSX onto soils.",

Therefore, novel approaches are needed like designing greener pharmaceuticals, i.e. better biodegradability in the environment. This study addresses a tiered approach of implementing green and sustainable chemistry principles for theoretically designing better biodegradable and pharmacologically improved pharmaceuticals. Photodegradation process coupled with LC-MS(n) analysis and in silico tools such as quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) analysis and molecular docking proved to be a very significant approach for the preliminary stages of designing chemical structures that would fit into the \"benign by design\" concept in the direction of green and sustainable pharmacy. Metoprolol (MTL) was used as an example, which itself is not readily biodegradable under conditions found in sewage treatment and the aquatic environment. The study provides the theoretical design of new derivatives of MTL which might have the same or improved pharmacological activity and are more degradable in the environment than MTL. However, the in silico toxicity prediction by QSAR of those photo-TPs indicated few of them might be possibly mutagenic and require further testing. This novel approach of theoretically designing 'green' pharmaceuticals can be considered as a step forward towards the green and sustainable pharmacy field. However, more knowledge and further experience have to be collected on the full scope, opportunities and limitations of this approach.",

First of all, among the notable 2012 approvals, is ivacaftor or Kalydeco\u00ae. This is the first treatment that targets one of the gene defects that is underlying cause of cystic fibrosis. This is also an example of the promise of personalized medicine. The benefits with bedaquiline or Sirturo\u00ae are its ability to likely provide clinically relevant activity as part of multi-drug regimens against tuberculosis (TB) based on clinical data in multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) patients, who were defined as being at least resistant against the two major tuberculostatic medicines (isaoniazide and rifampicine). On December 2012 and then, on December 2013, the FDA and European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has recommended granting a conditional marketing authorization for Sirturo\u00ae (bedaquiline), respectively, for use as part of a combination therapy for pulmonary multidrug resistant tuberculosis in adult patients when an effective treatment regimen cannot otherwise be composed for reasons of resistance or tolerability. Amyvid\u00ae, which is a solution for injection that contains the active substance florbetapir (18F), is a radiopharmaceutical that emits low amounts of radiation and works by targeting and attaching to \u03b2-amyloid plaques in the brain.

In multivariate logistic regression analysis, presence of chronic kidney disease is more likely to be associated with resistant hypertension (odds ratio [OR] 2.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.56-5.35). On the other hand, increase per year of age is associated with lower odds of resistant hypertension in this population (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.93-0.99).", 
    "97": "Resistant hypertension is present in nearly one in ten hypertensive patients on treatment. Hypertensive patients who have underlying chronic kidney disease are associated with higher odds of having resistant hypertension. Hence, in managing patients with hypertension, primary care physicians should be more alert and identify patients with chronic kidney disease as such patients are more likely to develop resistant hypertension. By doing that, these patients can be treated more aggressively earlier in order to achieve blood pressure target and thus reduce cardiovascular events.",

We aimed to explore changes in the plasma copeptin level for assessing the therapeutic efficacy of metoprolol for POTS in children. We included 49 children with POTS and 25 healthy children as controls. Patients received metoprolol for 1.5 to 3\u00a0months. The plasma copeptin level was measured by sandwich immunoluminometric assay. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to explore the predictive value of the plasma copeptin level. The baseline plasma copeptin level was higher in children with POTS than controls (10.524 \u00b1 2.016 vs 8.750 \u00b1 1.419 pmol/L, p <0.001) and was lower for responders than nonresponders to metoprolol (9.377 \u00b1 1.411 vs 12.054 \u00b1 1.662 pmol/L, p\u00a0= 0.003). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.889 (95% confidence interval 0.799 to 0.980). With a baseline plasma copeptin level of 10.225 pmol/L as a cutoff, the sensitivity was 90.5% and specificity 78.6% in predicting the efficacy of metoprolol in children with POTS.

In this study, we examined the ionic mechanisms mediating the intrinsic excitability of Kenyon cells in the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus. A perforated whole-cell clamp study using \u03b2-escin indicated the existence of several inward and outward currents. Three types of inward currents (INaf, INaP, and ICa) were identified. The transient sodium current (INaf) activated at -40 mV, peaked at -26 mV, and half-inactivated at -46.7 mV. The persistent sodium current (INaP) activated at -51 mV, peaked at -23 mV, and half-inactivated at -30.7 mV. Tetrodotoxin (TTX; 1 \u03bcM) completely blocked both INaf and INaP, but 10nM TTX blocked INaf more potently than INaP. Cd(2+) (50 \u03bcM) potently blocked INaP with little effect on INaf. Riluzole (>20 \u03bcM) nonselectively blocked both INaP and INaf. The voltage-dependent calcium current (ICa) activated at -30 mV, peaked at -11.3 mV, and half-inactivated at -34 mV. The Ca(2+) channel blocker verapamil (100 \u03bcM) blocked ICa in a use-dependent manner. Cell-attached patch-clamp recordings showed the presence of a large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BK) channel, and the activity of this channel was decreased by removing the extracellular Ca(2+) or adding verapamil or nifedipine, and increased by adding the Ca(2+) agonist Bay K8644, indicating that Ca(2+) entry via the L-type Ca(2+) channel regulates BK channel activity. Under the current-clamp condition, membrane depolarization generated membrane oscillations in the presence of 10nM TTX or 100 \u03bcM riluzole in the bath solution. These membrane oscillations disappeared with 1 \u03bcM TTX, 50 \u03bcM Cd(2+), replacement of external Na(+) with choline, and blockage of Na(+)-activated K(+) current (IKNa) with 50 \u03bcM quinidine, indicating that membrane oscillations are primarily mediated by INaP in cooperation with IKNa. The plateau potentials observed either in Ca(2+)-free medium or in the presence of verapamil were eliminated by blocking INaP with 50 \u03bcM Cd(2+). Taken together, these results indicate that INaP and IKNa participate in the generation of membrane oscillations and that INaP additionally participates in the generation of plateau potentials and initiation of spontaneous action potentials. ICa, through L-type Ca(2+) channels, was also found to play a role in the rapid membrane repolarization of action potentials by functional coupling with BK channels.",

The aim of this study therefore is to evaluate the possible protective effect of carvedilol on streptozotocin-induced early diabetic nephropathy and various mechanisms underlie this effect in rats. Single i.p. injection of streptozotocin (65\u2009mg/kg) was administered to induce early diabetic nephropathy in Wistar rats. Oral administration of carvedilol at a dose level of 1 and 10\u2009mg/kg daily for 4 weeks resulted in nephroprotective effect as evident by significant decrease in serum creatinine level, urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, and kidney index as well as renal levels of malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor- \u03b1 , and cyclooxygenase-2 with a concurrent increase in creatinine clearance and renal reduced glutathione level compared to diabetic untreated rats. The protective effect of carvedilol was confirmed by renal histopathological examination. The electron microscopic examination indicated that carvedilol could effectively ameliorate glomerular basement membrane thickening and podocyte injury. In conclusion, carvedilol protects rats against streptozotocin-induced early diabetic nephropathy possibly, in part, through its antioxidant as well as anti-inflammatory activities, and ameliorating podocyte injury.",

In advanced heart failure the treatment with various devices reaches importance, for example biventricular pacing for cardiac resynchronization. Recently, it has been discussed the question of long-term cardiovascular safety of hypoglycaemic drugs. Older anti-diabetic agents such as insulin, metformin, and sulfonylurea are considered to be cardiovascular safe. However, rosiglitazone from thiazolidinedione class increases incidence of cardiovascular events, resulting in cancellation of its registration in Europe and its considerably limited use in the United States. Therefore, cardiovascular safety is tested very carefully in clinical trials in new anti-diabetic agents that affect incretin system.

Cynomolgus CYP2D17, highly homologous to human CYP2D6, metabolizes human CYP2D6 substrates such as bufuralol and dextromethorphan, and the gene is expressed predominantly in liver. Although human CYP2D6 variants account for the variability of the enzyme properties among individuals and populations, genetic variants have not been investigated in CYP2D17. In the present study, CYP2D17 from 87 cynomolgus and 40 rhesus macaques was resequenced. The analysis found a total of 36 nonsynonymous variants, among which 5 were located in substrate recognition sites, the region important for protein function. Twenty-two variants were unique to cynomolgus macaques, of which 11 and 9 were found only in Indochinese and Indonesian cynomolgus macaques, respectively. Eight variants were unique to rhesus macaques. The functional characterization showed that two variant proteins (S188Y and V227I) heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli did not show substantial differences in the rate of bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation as compared with wild-type. However, measuring catalytic activities of the genotyped liver microsomes revealed that I297M and N337D were together significantly associated with higher rates, approximately 2.3- and 11.5-fold, of bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation and dextromethorphan O-demethylation, respectively, in the homozygotes than wild-type animals.

Knowing that both metformin and atenolol are eliminated by organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2/SLC22A2) expressed in the renal basolateral membrane, it is not clear whether there is a competitive effect on the renal excretion of metformin and/or atenolol when metformin and atenolol were co-administered, and whether age was involved in this drug-drug interaction. In this present study, both young rats (aged 3 months) and aged rats (aged 12 months) were used, rats were divided into metformin-treated group and metformin and atenolol co-administrated group, respectively. Either metformin (2.5 mg/kg) alone or metformin (2.5 mg/kg) in combination with atenolol (8 mg/kg) was administered to rats by tail vein injection. Then, urine was collected and the metformin concentration in urine was determined by HPLC.

    "146": "The objective of this study was to develop a novel ethylcellulose (EC)-coated pellet with partial active dose as a pore former for the controlled release of water-soluble metoprolol succinate (MS) without an initial lag phase (slow/non-drug release phase). MS-layered cores with a high drug-loading efficiency (97%, w/w), a smooth surface, and an acceptable level of resistance to abrasion were first obtained by spraying a concentrated drug solution (60% w/w at 70\u2009\u00b0C) on non-pareils in the absence of other binders. The presence of the drug in an EC coating solution significantly improved the coating process by reducing pellet stickiness. Central composite design and response surface methodology was employed to optimize and explore the effect of pore former MS level (X1) and EC coating level (X2) on the drug release. The pore former level had a positive effect on the MS release and the coating level had a negative effect. The level of X1 and X2 of the optimization were 17% and 23%, respectively, and the cumulative percent of MS released within 1\u2009h was up to 9.2%. Accordingly, the initial lag phase associated with in vitro drug release from EC-coated pellets was absent when MS drug was used as a pore former, which was further confirmed by in vivo drug release in beagle dogs. Thus, a novel approach for the controlled release of MS from coated pellets without lag phase has been successfully developed, which is valuable for the advancement of sustained-release pellets.",

The number of shocks and inappropriate detections are irrelevant for the definition. Within a period of 3 years ES occurred in approximately 25 % of ICD patients with secondary prophylaxis indications of sudden cardiac death. Although the definition includes minor arrhythmic events, ES frequently consists of up to 50 VTs. Potential triggers found in 20-65 % of patients include new/deteriorated heart failure, diarrhea/hypokalemia, changes in antiarrhythmic medication, association with other illnesses, and psychological stress. In most patients ES consists of monomorphic VT indicating the presence of reentry while ventricular fibrillation indicating acute ischemia is rare.",

The key intervention in ES is a reduction of the elevated sympathetic tone by beta blockers and also frequently sedation. Amiodarone i.v. is highly efficient in ES while class I antiarrhythmic drugs are usually unsuccessful. Substrate mapping and VT ablation may be useful in treatment and prevention of ES. Prevention of ES requires ICD programming systematically avoiding unnecessary shocks by long VT detection and numerous attempts of antitachycardia pacing before shock therapy which can fuel the sympathetic tone and prolong ES.",

Thirty-six male homozygous apolipoprotein E-deficient mice and wild-type C57BL/6J mice were randomized into 6 treatment groups: wild-type, atherosclerotic model, atorvastatin, low-dose \u03b23-AR agonist, high-dose \u03b23-AR agonist, and \u03b23-AR antagonist groups. The serum lipids, aortic-free cholesterol (FC), and cholesteryl ester (CE) concentrations were measured at the end of the treatments.

Protein expression levels of apoA1, PPAR\u03b1, and PPAR\u03b3 in the liver were determined by western blot analysis. Treatment with \u03b23-AR significantly increased the plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apoA-I, whereas the levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased. The \u03b23-AR agonist treatment markedly decreased both the FC and the CE concentrations in the aorta compared with the atherosclerotic model mice. The \u03b23-AR agonist increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of apoA-I, PPAR\u03b1, and PPAR\u03b3 in the liver. This study demonstrates that long-term \u03b23-AR activation can regulate lipid metabolic disorders and reduces the aortic FC and the CE concentrations.

All the ecotoxicological studies were supported by instrumental analysis to measure deviation between nominal and real test concentrations. Based on toxicological data from the green algae test (S. vacuolatus) propranolol and metoprolol can be considered to be harmful to aquatic organisms.

Not only does ILE have demonstrable efficacy as an antidote to local anesthetic toxicity, it is also effective in lipophilic drug intoxications. Our case series involved 10 patients with ingestion of different types of lipophilic drugs. Intravenous lipid emulsion treatment improved Glasgow Coma Scale or blood pressure and pulse rate or both according to the drug type. Complications were observed in 2 patients (minimal change pancreatitis and probable ILE treatment-related fat infiltration in lungs). In our case series, ILE was used for different lipophilic drug intoxications to improve cardiovascular and neurologic symptoms. According to the results, it was found that ILE treatment is a lifesaving agent in lipophilic drug intoxications and it can be used in unconscious patients who have cardiac and/or neurologic symptoms but no history of a specific drug ingestion.", 
    "160": "Metoprolol (MTP) is a compound of concern, considered as an emerging contaminant due to its high consumption, pseudopersistence and potential ecotoxicity. Activated sludge batch experiments were performed to evaluate the biological transformation of MTP and the formation of transformation products under different treatment conditions. Total MTP removal was obtained in aerobic conditions, and the formation of MTP known metabolites (metoprolol acid (MTPA), \u03b1-hydroxymetoprolol (\u03b1-HMTP) and O-desmethylmetoprolol (O-DMTP)) and unknown transformation products (TPs) was investigated. The three known metabolites and two new TPs generated along the experiments were identified by liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry. For the two new TPs plausible structures were proposed based on the tentative identification. MTPA had the major ratio formation for the TPs identified along the experiments (up to 40% of initial MTP concentration after 96\u00a0h treatment) and its persistence through biological treatment was proven. Ecotoxicity studies using Vibrio fischeri bioluminescent bacteria in an acute toxicity test showed that MTP and its known TPs are not toxic with the exception of o-DMTP. Finally, MTP and its TPs were monitored in a full scale membrane bioreactor and in a full scale conventional urban wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and the results were compared with those obtained in batch experiments. \u03b1-HMTP was detected for the first time in a WWTP influent whereas MTPA was detected in influent and effluent WWTP samples at much higher levels (up to 100 folds higher) than MTP itself remarking its high persistence.", 
    "161": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of epinephrine as additive for propranolol as an infiltrative anesthetic. Using a rat model of cutaneous trunci muscle reflex (CTMR), we tested the effect of co-administration of epinephrine with propranolol on infiltrative cutaneous analgesia. Bupivacaine, a long-lasting local anesthetic, was used as control. Subcutaneous propranolol and bupivacaine elicited a dose-dependent local anesthetic effect on infiltrative cutaneous analgesia. On the 50% effective dose (ED50) basis, the relative potency was bupivacaine [2.05 (1.95-2.21) \u03bcmol/kg]>propranolol [9.21 (9.08-9.42) \u03bcmol/kg] (P<0.01 for each comparison). Subcutaneous epinephrine (0.012 \u03bcmol/kg) did not produce cutaneous analgesia. Mixtures of epinephrine (0.012 \u03bcmol/kg) with drugs (propranolol or bupivacaine) at ED50 or ED95, respectively, intensified and prolonged drug action on infiltrative cutaneous analgesia. Intraperitoneal injection of combined drugs (propranolol or bupivacaine) at ED95 with epinephrine (0.012 \u03bcmol/kg) exhibited no cutaneous analgesia. We concluded that propranolol was less potent but produced a similar duration of action when compared to bupivacaine on infiltrative cutaneous analgesia. Epinephrine as adjuvant for propranolol or bupivacaine enhanced the potency and extended the duration of action on infiltrative cutaneous analgesia.", 
    "162": "The present study aimed at investigating the effect of MDMA on measures of empathy and social interaction, and the roles of oxytocin and the 5-HT1A receptor in these effects. The design was placebo-controlled within-subject with 4 treatment conditions: MDMA (75 mg), with or without pindolol (20 mg), oxytocin nasal spray (40 IU+16 IU) or placebo. Participants were 20 healthy poly-drug MDMA users, aged between 18-26 years. Cognitive and emotional empathy were assessed by means of the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test and the Multifaceted Empathy Test. Social interaction, defined as trust and reciprocity, was assessed by means of a Trust Game and a Social Ball Tossing Game. Results showed that MDMA selectively affected emotional empathy and left cognitive empathy, trust and reciprocity unaffected. When combined with pindolol, these effects remained unchanged. Oxytocin did not affect measures of empathy and social interaction. Changes in emotional empathy were not related to oxytocin plasma levels. It was concluded that MDMA (75 mg) selectively enhances emotional empathy in humans. While the underlying neurobiological mechanism is still unknown, it is suggested that peripheral oxytocin does not seem to be the main actor in this; potential candidates are the serotonin 2A and the vasopressin 1A receptors.

After norepinephrine administration, the HR and cardiac output were higher in rats with enhanced physical activity after preliminary hypokinesia than in rats with low physical activity. After propranolol administration, stroke volume and cardiac output in 100-day-old rats with limited activity were lower, and HR higher was than in rats with enhanced physical activity after preliminary 70-day hypokinesia. After administration of doxazosin, rats with limited motor activity demonstrated more pronounced changes in HR than rats with enhanced physical activity after preliminary 70-day hypokinesia.",

All underwent 24-hour blood pressure and HR monitoring, and were assessed for markers of inflammation, insulin resistance, albuminuria, presence of peripheral neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease. Subjects whose night-time HR did not decrease by more than 10% as compared to daytime readings were classified as non-dippers.", 
    "166": "Univariate analysis revealed that non-dippers had significantly higher logarithmic albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR; p = 0.001) and higher platelet count (p = 0.014). Also, non-dippers were more likely to be on \u03b2-blockers (p = 0.037). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that logarithmic ACR (p = 0.001) and platelet count (p = 0.026) were independent predictors of non-dipping HR, even when correcting for \u03b2-blocker use.", 
    "167": "In this high-risk type 2 diabetic population, non-dipping HR was independently associated with ACR and platelet count, suggesting that non-dipping HR might give an indication of underlying generalised atherosclerosis in diabetic patients. Also, non-dipping HR may represent a novel mechanism explaining the association of nephropathy with cardiovascular events. This merits further study.", 
    "168": "The exercise pressor reflex (EPR) is generated by group III and IV muscle afferents during exercise to increase cardiovascular function. Muscle contraction is triggered by ACh, which is metabolized into choline that could serve as a signal of exercise-induced activity. We demonstrate that ACh can induce current in muscle afferents neurons isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats. The nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) appear to be expressed by some group III-IV neurons since capsaicin (TRPV1) and/or ATP (P2X) induced current in 56% of ACh-responsive neurons. \u03b17- And \u03b14\u03b22-nAChRs have been shown to be expressed in sensory neurons. An \u03b17-nAChR antibody stained 83% of muscle afferent neurons. Functional expression was demonstrated by using the specific \u03b17-nAChR blockers \u03b1-conotoxin ImI (IMI) and methyllycaconitine (MLA). MLA inhibited ACh responses in 100% of muscle afferent neurons, whereas IMI inhibited ACh responses in 54% of neurons. Dihydro-\u03b2-erythroidine, an \u03b14\u03b22-nAChR blocker, inhibited ACh responses in 50% of muscle afferent neurons, but recovery from block was not observed. Choline, an \u03b17-nAChR agonist, elicited a response in 60% of ACh-responsive neurons. Finally, we demonstrated the expression of \u03b17-nAChR by peripherin labeled (group IV) afferent fibers within gastrocnemius muscles. Some of these \u03b17-nAChR-positive fibers were also positive for P2X3 receptors. Thus choline could serve as an activator of the EPR by opening \u03b17-nAChR expressed by group IV (and possible group III) afferents. nAChRs could become pharmacological targets for suppressing the excessive EPR activation in patients with peripheral vascular disease.",

    "175": "The expression and effects of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2-ARs) on the neurons of the bulbospinal rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) have been limitedly examined to date. The objective of this study was to examine the expression of \u03b21- and \u03b22-ARs on the bulbospinal RVLM neurons electrophysiologically and histologically. To directly investigate whether RVLM neurons display sensitivity to metoprolol (a \u03b21-AR antagonist), dobutamine (a \u03b21-AR agonist), butoxamine (a \u03b22-AR antagonist), and salbutamol (a \u03b22-AR agonist), we examined changes in the membrane potentials of the bulbospinal RVLM neurons using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique during superfusion of these drugs. During metoprolol superfusion, 16 of the 20 RVLM neurons were hyperpolarized, and 5 of the 6 RVLM neurons were depolarized during dobutamine superfusion. During butoxamine superfusion, 11 of the 16 RVLM neurons were depolarized, and all of the 8 RVLM neurons were hyperpolarized during salbutamol superfusion. These results suggest the expression of \u03b21- and \u03b22-ARs on the RVLM neurons. To determine the presence of \u03b21- and \u03b22-ARs histologically, immunofluorescence examination was performed. Five metoprolol-hyperpolarized neurons were examined for \u03b21-AR and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity. All of the neurons displayed \u03b21-AR immunoreactivity, whereas three of the neurons displayed TH immunoreactivity. All of the five RVLM neurons that became depolarized during metoprolol superfusion and hyperpolarized during butoxamine superfusion displayed \u03b21- and \u03b22-AR immunoreactivity. Our findings suggest that \u03b21-AR antagonists or \u03b22-AR agonists may decrease blood pressure through decreasing the activity of the bulbospinal RVLM neurons.", 
    "176": "Intravenously administered nanocarriers are widely studied to improve the delivery of various therapeutic agents. However, recent in vivo studies have demonstrated that intravenously administered nanocarriers that do not contain any drug may affect cardiovascular function. Here we provide an example where the drug and the nanocarrier both affect the same cardiovascular parameters following intravenous administration. The peptide ghrelin antagonist (GhA) increases arterial pressure, while thermally hydrocarbonized porous silicon nanoparticles (THCPSi) transiently decrease it, as assessed with radiotelemetry in conscious rats. As a result, intravenous administration of GhA-loaded THCPSi nanoparticles partially antagonized GhA activity: arterial pressure was not increased. When the cardiovascular effects of GhA were blocked with atenolol pretreatment, GhA-loaded nanoparticles reduced arterial pressure to similar extent as drug-free nanoparticles. These data indicate that the biological activity of a drug delivered within a nanocarrier may be obscured by the biological responses induced by the nanocarrier itself.",

To determine if select flavonoids regulate hepatic apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) synthesis, we examined the effects of quercetin, isoquercetin, and myrescetin on apo A-I gene expression in HepG2 (hepatocytes) and Caco-2 (intestinal) cells.",

    "179": "Quercetin and isoquercetin, but not myrecetin, induced apo A-I protein and mRNA synthesis, and induced apo A-I promoter activity. Induction by quercetin required an estrogen-responsive region of the apo A-I promoter. Addition of estrogen receptor blocker ICI-182780 to quercetin-treated cells inhibited the effects of quercetin on apo A-I gene expression. Down-regulation of ESR1 with ESR1 siRNA had no effect on basal apo A-I gene expression; however it prevented quercetin-mediated induction of apo A-I gene expression.",

We herein reported the successful treatment of mild pediatric KMP with propranolol monotherapy in a case of a five-week-old child with kaposiform hemangioendothelioma with successful treatment of both clinical and hematologic responses. After eight months of follow-up, patient still had stable cutaneous lesion while receiving propranolol monotherapy. Regular hematologic monitoring was done in order to detect any late relapse of the disease. Six months after discontinuation of propranolol, patient has still remained free of hematologic relapse, and primary cutaneous lesion has become a pale pink, 1\u2009cm sized skin lesion.",

The following parameters were recorded: minimal hypotensive response, maximal hypertensive response, response duration and heart rate.", 
    "184": "Epinephrine, but not felypressin, exerted an important hypotensive action; non-treated hypertensive rats showed more pronounced vasodilation. Treated and non-treated rats showed hypertensive responses of the same magnitudes in all groups; 1K1C atenolol rats showed reduced hypertensive responses to both vasoconstrictors. Felypressin's response duration was longer than that of epinephrine in all groups. Epinephrine increased heart rate while felypressin reduced this parameter only in the normotensive group.", 
    "185": "Our results suggest that felypressin has equipotent pressure responses when compared with epinephrine, showing a greater extent of action. Atenolol's reduction of hypertensive effects surprisingly suggests that atenolol \u03b2-blockade may also be important for felypressin's cardiovascular effect, as is widely known for epinephrine. Our data suggest that felypressin is safe for hypertensive subjects, in particular those receiving atenolol.",

Glass microelectrode technique was used to observe action potentials of right ventricular papillary muscle of guinea pig. The onset time of arrhythmia induced by CaCl2 was significantly prolonged by TJ0711 at 0.75, 1.5 and 3 mg x kg(-1) doses. TJ0711 (1.5 and 3 mg x kg(-1)) can significantly shorten the ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) duration, the incidence of VF and mortality were significantly reduced. On ischemia-reperfusion-induced arrhythmic model, TJ0711 (0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg x kg(-1)) can significantly reduce the ventricular premature contraction (PVC), VT, VF incidence, mortality, arrhythmia score with a dose-dependent manner. At the same time, rats serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) activities decreased significantly by TJ0711 (1 and 2 mg x kg(-1)). Ouabain could cause arrhythmia in guinea pigs, when TJ0711 (0.375, 0.75, 1.5 and 3 mg x kg(-1)) was given, the doses of ouabain inducing a variety of arrhythmia PVC, VT, VF, cardiac arrest (CA) were significantly increased with a dose-dependent manner. In the TJ0711 0.1-30 micromol x L(-1) concentration range, guinea pig right ventricular papillary muscle action potential RP (rest potential), APA (action potential amplitude) and V(max) (maximum velocity of depolarization) were not significantly affected. APD20, APD50 and APD90 had a shortening trend but no statistical difference with the increase of TJ0711 concentration. TJ0711 has antiarrhythmic effect on the sympathetic nerve excitement and myocardial cell high calcium animal arrhythmia model. Myocardial action potential zero phase conduction velocity and resting membrane potential were not inhibited by TJ0711. APD20, APD50 and APD90 were shortened by TJ0711 at high concentration. Its antiarrhythmic action mechanism may be besides the action of blocking beta1 receptor, may also have a strong selective blocking action on alpha1 receptor and reducing intracellular calcium concentration.",

Here, we show that treatment with the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor agonist clenbuterol increases survival, rescues abnormalities in respiratory function and social recognition, and improves motor coordination in young male Mecp2-null (Mecp2(-/y)) mice. Importantly, we demonstrate that short-term treatment with clenbuterol in older symptomatic female heterozygous (Mecp2(-/+)) mice rescues respiratory, cognitive, and motor coordination deficits, and induces an anxiolytic effect. In addition, we reveal abnormalities in a microRNA-mediated pathway, downstream of brain-derived neurotrophic factor that affects insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) expression in Mecp2(-/y) mice, and show that treatment with clenbuterol restores the observed molecular alterations. Finally, cotreatment with clenbuterol and recombinant human IGF1 results in additional increases in survival in male null mice. Collectively, our data support a role for IGF1 and other growth factor deficits as an underlying mechanism of Rett syndrome and introduce \u03b22-adrenergic receptor agonists as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of the disorder.",

Although recent treatment strategies have led to improved outcomes, variceal hemorrhage still carries a 6-week mortality rate of 15-20%. Current standards in its treatment include antibiotic prophylaxis, infusion of a vasoactive drug and endoscopic variceal ligation. The placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is considered for patients that have treatment failure or recurrent bleeding. Recurrent hemorrhage is prevented with the combination of a non-selective beta-blocker and endoscopic variceal ligation.

The percentage of patients taking \u03b2-blockers was 38%; the percentage taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARBs) was 32%. Medication usage did not differ significantly by race or sex. In multivariate-adjusted logistic regression models, a visit to a cardiologist, hypertension, heart failure as a primary reason for the visit, and a visit duration longer than 15 minutes were positively associated with ACEI/ARB use; and a visit to a cardiologist, heart failure as a primary reason for the visit, the presence of ischemic heart disease, and visit duration longer than 15 minutes were positively associated with \u03b2-blocker use. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was negatively associated with \u03b2-blocker use. Approximately 1% of heart-failure visits resulted in hospitalization. In outpatient heart-failure management, gaps that might warrant attention include suboptimal health education and low usage rates of medications, specifically ACEI/ARBs and \u03b2-blockers.", 
    "208": "Rebleeding after an initial oesophageal variceal haemorrhage remains a significant problem despite therapy with band ligation, non-selective \u03b2-blockers or a combination of these. Carvedilol is a vasodilating non-selective \u03b2-blocker with alpha-1 receptor and calcium channel antagonism. A recent study has suggested it is effective in the prevention of a first variceal bleed. Our aim was to compare oral carvedilol with variceal band ligation (VBL) in the prevention of rebleeding following a first variceal bleed.", 
    "209": "Patients who were stable 5 days after presentation with a first oesophageal variceal haemorrhage and had not been taking \u03b2-blockers were randomised to oral carvedilol or VBL. Patients were followed-up after one week, monthly, then every 3 months. The primary end point was variceal rebleeding on intention-to-treat analysis.", 
    "210": "64 patients were randomised, 33 to carvedilol and 31 to VBL. 58 (90.6%) patients had alcohol related liver disease. Age and Child-Pugh score were similar in both groups at baseline. Median follow-up was 26.3 (interquartile range [IQR] 10.2-46.6)months. Compliance was 68% and 65% for carvedilol and VBL respectively (p=0.993) and serious adverse events between the two groups were similar (p=0.968). Variceal rebleeding occurred during follow-up in 12 (36.4%) and 11 (35.5%) patients in the carvedilol and VBL groups, respectively (p=0.857), with 9 (27.3%) and 16 (51.6%) deaths in each group, respectively (p=0.110).", 
    "211": "Carvedilol is not superior to VBL in the prevention of variceal rebleeding. The trend to a survival benefit for patients taking this drug compared with those undergoing banding requires further exploration.", 
    "212": "We performed a real-life retrospective analysis to assess the impact of long-acting bronchodilator therapy and associated exposure to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).", 
    "213": "We used record linkage data from patients with a diagnosis of COPD in Tayside, Scotland, between 2001 and 2010. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality were assessed using Cox proportional hazard regression.", 
    "214": "A total of 4,133 patients were included, mean FEV1 of 59.5%, mean age of 68.9 years and mean follow-up of 4.6 years. There were 623 who were exposed to long-acting bronchodilators only and 3,510 to long-acting bronchodilators plus ICS. 1,372 patients (33%) died during the study period. Compared with controls taking only long-acting bronchodilators either alone or in combination, all-cause mortality was reduced in patients taking long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) + ICS as dual therapy: adjusted hazard ratio 0.62 (95% CI 0.45-0.85), but not by long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) + ICS: adjusted hazard ratio 1.02 (95% CI 0.80-1.31). Cardiovascular mortality was not reduced by dual therapy with either LABA or LAMA and concomitant ICS exposure. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality were both reduced in patients taking triple therapy with LABA + LAMA + ICS: adjusted hazard ratio 0.51 (95% CI 0.41-0.64) and 0.56 (95% CI 0.35-0.90), respectively.", 
    "215": "In patients exposed to ICS, concomitant use of LAMA alone as dual therapy or in combination with LABA as triple therapy were associated with reductions in all-cause mortality, while concomitant use of LABA without LAMA conferred no reduction. Moreover, only triple therapy was found to confer benefits on cardiovascular mortality.",

    "217": "The CLARIFY registry is a prospective registry conducted in 41 countries that included outpatients with stable coronary artery disease attending primary care or specialist units between October 2009 and June 2010. The present study describes the baseline characteristics of the Spanish cohort compared with the western European cohorts included in the registry.", 
    "218": "A total of 33,248 patients were included: 14,726 in western Europe and 2257 in Spain (selected by 192 cardiologists). The majority of the participants in Spain were men (81%) with a mean age of 65 years. There was a higher frequency of diabetes (34% vs 25%; P<.0001), coronary artery disease family history (19% vs 31%; P<.0001), myocardial infarction (64% vs 60%; P<.0001), and stroke (5% vs 3%; P=.0007) in the Spanish cohort than in the western European cohorts. The most common treatments in the Spanish sample were lipid-lowering drugs (96%), acetylsalicylic acid (89%), and beta-blockers (74%).", 
    "219": "Patients in the Spanish cohort are similar to those in the western European cohorts and seem to be representative of the Spanish population with coronary artery disease. Therefore, they form a suitable basis for the study of prognostic factors at 5-year follow-up.", 
    "220": "Oxidative stress is closely related to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. Carvedilol, a nonselective \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blocker with pleiotropic activity has been shown to exert neuroprotective effect due to its antioxidant property. However, the neuroprotective mechanism of carvedilol is still not fully uncovered. The phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway plays key role in cell survival and the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/antioxidant response element (ARE) signaling pathway is the major cellular defense mechanism against oxidative stress. Here we investigated the effects of carvedilol on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced cell death as well as the Akt and Nrf2/ARE pathways in PC12 cells. We found that carvedilol significantly increased cell viability and decreased reactive oxygen species in PC12 cells exposed to 6-OHDA. Furthermore, carvedilol activated the Akt and Nrf2/ARE pathways in a concentration-dependent manner, and increased the protein levels of heme oxygenase-1(HO-1) and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1(NQO-1), two downstream factors of the Nrf2/ARE pathway. In summary, our results indicate that carvedilol protects PC12 cells against 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity possibly through activating the Akt and Nrf2/ARE signaling pathways.", 
    "221": "Intracerebroventricular infusion of a mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) or angiotensin\u00a0II type\u00a01 receptor (AT1R) blocker in rats attenuates sympathetic hyperactivity and progressive left ventricular (LV) dysfunction post myocardial infarction (MI). The present study examined whether knockdown of MRs or AT1Rs specifically in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) contributes to these effects, and compared cardiac effects with those of systemic treatment with the \u03b21-adrenergic receptor blocker metoprolol. The PVN of rats was infused with adeno-associated virus carrying small interfering RNA against either MR (AAV-MR-siRNA) or AT1R (AAV-AT1R-siRNA), or as control scrambled siRNA. At 4\u00a0weeks post MI, AT1R but not MR expression was increased in the PVN, excitatory renal sympathetic nerve activity and pressor responses to air stress were enhanced, and arterial baroreflex function was impaired; LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was increased and LV peak systolic pressure (LVPSP), ejection fraction (EF) and dP/dtmax decreased. AAV-MR-siRNA and AAV-AT1R-siRNA both normalized AT1R expression in the PVN, similarly ameliorated sympathetic and pressor responses to air stress, largely prevented baroreflex desensitization, and improved LVEDP, EF and dP/dtmax as well as cardiac interstitial (but not perivascular) fibrosis. In a second set of rats, metoprolol at 70 or 250\u00a0mg\u00a0kg(-1)\u00a0day(-1) in the drinking water for 4\u00a0weeks post MI did not improve LV function except for a decrease in LVEDP at the lower dose. These results suggest that in rats MR-dependent upregulation of AT1Rs in the PVN contributes to sympathetic hyperactivity, and LV dysfunction and remodelling post MI. In rats, normalizing MR-AT1R signalling in the PVN is a more effective strategy to improve LV dysfunction post MI than systemic \u03b21 blockade."
