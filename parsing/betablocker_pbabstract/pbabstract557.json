    "0": "The split hydronephrotic kidney preparation was used to directly observe the effects of locally applied dopamine on the in vivo diameters of renal vessels. Dopamine (1 X 10(-6) to 3 X 10(-5) M) produced a concentration-dependent dilation of the arcuate and interlobular arteries and afferent arterioles. Efferent arterioles near the glomeruli also dilated to dopamine but the dilation was less than that of the preglomerular vessels. Higher dopamine concentrations (3 X 10(-4) and 1 X 10(-3) M) produced more variable effects, with a tendency for the arcuate and interlobular arteries and the afferent and efferent arterioles away from the glomeruli to decrease in diameter. After pretreatment with haloperidol, dopamine (1 X 10(-6) to 1 X 10(-4) M) did not dilate any pre- or postglomerular vascular segment, but the tendency for pre- and postglomerular constrictions with higher dopamine concentrations were not abolished. Pretreatment with phentolamine and propranolol enhanced the dilator response of the pre- and postglomerular vessels (except the afferent arterioles near glomeruli and efferent arterioles near welling points) to dopamine (3 X 10(-5) and 1 X 10(-4) M), and abolished the reductions in diameter produced by the high dopamine levels. These data indicate that the dilator effect of dopamine is mediated by interactions with specific dopaminergic receptors, while alpha and beta adrenergic receptors appear to mediate a constrictor influence observed with high dopamine concentrations. The overall effect of dopamine on the renal vessel diameters thus appears to depend on the balance of dilator and constrictor stimuli mediated by multiple receptors.", 
    "1": "Plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma renin concentration (PRC), inactive renin concentration (IRC) and total renin concentration (TRC) were measured in 31 normal controls and in 8 patients with hyperthyroidism. TRC was determined as angiotensin I generated with sheep renin substrate after an acid activation of plasma. The angiotensin I of non-acidified plasma was expressed as PRC. IRC was calculated as TRC minus PRC. The mean values for PRA, PRC, IRC and TRC were significantly (P less than 0.05 to P less than 0.01) higher in the hyperthyroid patients than in the normal or euthyroid controls. The administration of a beta 1-adrenergic blocker, metoprolol (120 mg/day for 14 days), produced a significant (P less than 0.05 to P less than 0.01) fall in levels of T4, PRA and TRC, and reduced the active renin ratio calculated from PRC/TRC significantly (P less than 0.025), as compared to the pretreatment values. Our observations support the idea that the higher PRA in hyperthyroidism is due to an increased secretion of renin. Furthermore, the results may indicate that the conversion of inactive to active renin is accelerated in hyperthyroidism, possibly by an increased sympathetic activity.", 
    "2": "The beta-adrenergic receptors were investigated in partially purified mononucleal leukocytes (MNL) plasma membranes from 18 patients with IDDM in pediatric period, 9 healthy children and 8 normal adults. The decreased beta-adrenergic receptor number was seen in patients with IDDM (Bmax = 27.6 +/- 8.3 fM (125I) IHYP/mg protein) compared with normal children (Bmax = 40.4 +/- 10.4 fM (125I) IHYP/mg protein) and normal adults (Bmax = 36.9 +/- 6 fM (125I) IHYP/mg protein). MNL beta-receptor binding affinities (apparent Kd = 109.8 +/- 26.1 pM in IDDM, 102.8 +/- 46.6 pM in normal children, 130.0 +/- 43.1 pM in normal adults) did not differ. We divided the patients with IDDM into two groups based on their level of blood glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1) when samples were taken. Group A IDDM (consisted of 9 diabetic patients with below 10% of HbA1) had markedly decreased beta-receptor numbers compared with group B IDDM (consisted of 9 diabetic patients with more than 10% of HbA1), whereas Kd was not significantly different. Also, there was negative correlation between Bmax and level of blood sugar or HbA1 in IDDM. This is the first report concerning the beta-adrenergic receptor in IDDM in pediatric period. We suggest that decreased Bmax in group B is a homeostatic response to restore the poorly-controlled hyperglycemic state to normoglycemia because the group B patients had high level of HbA1 and blood sugar.", 
    "3": "Cumulative concentration-effect relationships of isoproterenol (isoprenaline) on guinea pig tracheal spirals and lung parenchymal strips were determined in organ baths kept at 37 degrees C or at 18 degrees C. The IC50's for isoproterenol at 18 degrees C were significantly (p less than .01) higher than those for isoproterenol at 37 degrees C in both the tissues; although the parenchymal response was affected more than that of the trachea by cooling. pA2 values for propranolol were determined on both tracheal spirals and parenchymal strips at 37 degrees C and 18 degrees C. The pA2 values were decreased in both the tissues by cooling. The decrease was more prominent in the parenchyma than in the trachea, a finding consistent with the concentration-effect relationships studies mentioned above.", 
    "4": "Membranes prepared from both circular and longitudinal muscle layers of the uteri of two groups of virgin adult guinea-pigs were used to study the influence of ovarian steroids upon beta-adrenoreceptor binding sites. Animals were (i) treated for 14 days with oestradiol cypionate, beginning on day 9-10 of the oestrous cycle; or (ii) treated as in (i) and in addition, with progesterone for the last four days of oestradiol administration. (-)-[125I]-iodocyanopindolol ([125I]-CYP) was used to determine the numbers and characteristics of beta-adrenoreceptor binding sites in the four membrane preparations. In all cases, binding displayed characteristics of a saturable bimolecular reaction; the estimates of receptor site density (Bmax; 0.26-0.33 pmol g-1 wet weight) were similar in all four preparations, as were those of binding affinity KD; 18-31 pmol l-1). The mean negative logarithms of apparent dissociation constants (pKD) for the inhibition of specific [125I]-CYP binding by ICI 118, 551 (beta 2-adrenoreceptor selective antagonist) ranged from 8.4 to 8.6; and those for L 643, 717-01J10 (beta 1-adrenoreceptor selective antagonist) were 5.7-6.2. Thus the [125I]-CYP binding sites in all four membrane preparations displayed the characteristics expected of homogeneous populations of adrenoreceptors of the beta 2-subtype. The pKD values for isoprenaline were also similar in each type of membrane preparation (5.8-6.0). It is concluded that the clearcut differences in the contractile responsiveness, to adrenoreceptor agonists, of the circular and longitudinal myometrial preparations from oestrogen-treated guinea-pigs are not due to differences in the numbers, subtype or binding affinities of beta-adrenoreceptor binding sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "5": "Lung membranes are susceptible to oxygen radicals, formed during inflammation, redox cycling of toxic agents, exposition to ozon etc. Oxygen radicals may modify the beta-adrenergic response. However, at the same time beta-adrenoceptors of the lung are frequently addressed in therapy. We embarked upon this problem by studying the effects of the aldehyde 4-hydroxy-2,3-transnonenal (HNE), one of the major products of lipid peroxidation, on the density of beta-adrenoceptors of rat lung membranes. It is shown, that the physiological important sulfhydryl blocking agent HNE inactivates the beta-adrenoceptors in a time- and concentration dependent (0.5-2.5 mM) way, indicated by a decrease in (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) binding to lung membranes. Moreover, it is shown that combined treatment of HNE with (-)-isoproterenol (0.5 microM) or 1-alprenolol (0.5-10 nM) does not influence the extent of inactivation of beta-adrenoceptors by HNE. This is in contrast with previous studies, conducted with other, synthetic, sulfhydryl blocking agents, such as N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), suggesting that an other mechanism of inactivation is involved upon HNE treatment.", 
    "6": "Post-training administration of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (0.1 mg/kg) facilitated 48-hr retention, in mice, of a one-trial step-through inhibitory avoidance response. The naloxone-induced memory facilitation was blocked in animals given the selective brain-noradrenergic neurotoxin DSP4 (N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine) (50.0 mg/kg, ip) 7 days before training. Pretreatment with the norepinephrine-uptake inhibitor desmethylimipramine (10.0 mg/kg, ip, 30 min), but not with the serotonin-uptake inhibitor fluoxetine (5.0 mg/kg, ip, 30 min), prevented this antagonism. The simultaneous administration of the central beta-adrenoceptor blocker l-propranolol (2.0 mg/kg, ip), also blocked the effects of naloxone on memory. The effects of naloxone were not blocked by d-propranolol (2.0 mg/kg, ip), the peripheral beta-adrenoceptor blocker sotalol (2.0 mg/kg, ip), the alpha-adrenoceptor blocker phenoxybenzamine (10.0 mg/kg, ip), or the predominantly peripheral alpha-adrenoceptor blocker phentolamine (10.0 mg/kg, ip). These findings suggest that central beta-adrenergic mechanisms are involved in the effects of naloxone on memory. Naloxone (0.1 mg/kg, ip) potentiated the effects of the central beta-adrenoceptor agonist clenbuterol (0.001-1.00 mg/kg, ip), which, when administered alone, facilitates or impairs retention as a function of the dose injected. The simultaneous administration of beta-endorphin (0.1 micrograms/kg, ip) exerted effects opposite to those elicited by naloxone, that is, shifted the dose-response curve of clenbuterol to the right. Considered together, these findings are consistent with the view that the facilitatory action of naloxone on memory results from the release of central beta-adrenergic mechanisms from an inhibition induced by opioid peptides released during or immediately after training.", 
    "7": "The effect of short term and long term ischemia induced by right carotid occlusion was studied on beta-adrenergic receptor function in rat cerebral microvessels. The results show a different time-dependent responsiveness of the two hemispheres to ischemia, with a pronounced and more persistent decrease in the number of capillary beta-receptors in the left side of the brain. The data suggest the existence of asymmetries in the control of brain microvasculature which may mediate the different time-course of beta-receptor changes in response to ischemia.", 
    "8": "Spontaneous or propranolol-induced hypoglycemia can occur in uremic humans. We studied glucose kinetics (using [3-3H]glucose) in five uremic humans 24 h after hemodialysis and in seven normal controls. The effect of glucagon infusion at rates of 3, 6, 12, and 18 ng X kg-1 X min-1 at 60-min intervals was compared with either saline or beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol infusion). In uremics, plasma glucose increased by 20-25% and by 40-50% at the 3 and 6 ng X kg-1 X min-1 glucagon doses, respectively, with no further increases at higher infusion rates. Glucose production increased transiently and in tandem with glucose uptake at each glucagon increment (P less than 0.0001). During beta-adrenergic blockade, the effect of glucagon in stimulating glucose production was blunted by 14-24% at the 6-18 ng X kg-1 X min-1 doses (P less than 0.05). During saline infusion, plasma insulin concentrations increased progressively to peak levels fourfold above basal at the 18 ng X kg-1 X min-1 dose. This increase in plasma insulin was virtually abolished by concomitant beta-adrenergic blockade (P = 0.0002). In contrast to uremic subjects, normal controls exhibited lesser degrees of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia at all glucagon infusion rates. Propranolol infusion had no effect on the increments in glucose production and uptake nor on the plasma insulin response. These results suggest that in uremic humans propranolol independently reduces the hepatic response to glucagon and the insulin secretory response to hyperglycemia and/or hyperglucagonemia. These observations provide a possible mechanism for the adrenergic regulation of glucose homeostasis in uremia.", 
    "9": "Clinical trials have shown an increase in survival in patients treated with beta blockers after infarction. In addition, the majority of patients undergoing myocardial revascularization are also treated preoperatively with beta blockers. It is commonly thought that beta blockers exert their protective effect primarily by decreasing heart rate and subsequent myocardial work. The present study was designed to determine whether beta blockade has any primary protective metabolic effects on globally ischemic myocardium. Thirty-four anesthetized dogs underwent total myocardial ischemia at 37 degrees C. High-energy nucleotide and lactate levels in left ventricular tissue samples were determined at control and at 15 minute intervals as well as at the onset of ischemic contracture in 24 dogs. Seventeen dogs were treated with propranolol before ischemia. The time to ischemic contracture in control dogs was 63.3 +/- 1.4 minutes compared with 75.9 +/- 2.2 minutes in the propranolol-treated group (p less than 0.01). In addition to significantly delaying the onset of ischemic contracture, propranolol also decreased the rate of anaerobic glycolysis during ischemia. Ischemic contracture occurred in the control group with an average adenosine triphosphate level of 1.26 +/- 0.08 mumol compared to 0.91 +/- 0.08 mumol/gm wet weight for the beta blocked group (p less than 0.0025). These are the first data suggesting that the protective effects of beta blockade may be related to a beneficial effect on ischemic myocardial metabolism allowing myocardium to survive with lower levels of adenosine triphosphate.", 
    "10": "This study was performed to determine if the unperfused microvascular reserve in the rabbit heart can be controlled by beta adrenoceptors. Anesthetized, open chest rabbits (N = 54) were subjected to saline i.v., 0.7 mg/kg of atenolol i.v., 1 mg/kg of practolol, 0.1 microgram/kg of salbutamol, 1 microgram/kg of salbutamol or 0.7 mg/kg of atenolol + 1 microgram/kg of salbutamol treatments. In half these animals coronary flows were determined before and after treatment using radioactive microspheres. The others were given 100 mg/kg of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran and the hearts were removed and analyzed for perfused and total microvascular morphology. The fluorescence marked the perfused microvessels and the slides were stained to show all vessels. Control group blood flow was 213 +/- 25 ml/min/100 g. Flows decreased 25% with atenolol and practolol whereas no change was seen with salbutamol or atenolol + salbutamol. Total capillary volume fraction ranged from 0.15 to 0.20 mm3/mm3 with 60% of this perfused in controls. Atenolol significantly reduced this to 47% whereas practolol (90%), high-dose salbutamol (97%) and salbutamol + atenolol (99%) resulted in a significant mobilization. Low-dose salbutamol resulted in a mobilization of capillaries to a degree intermediate (79%) between controls and high-dose salbutamol. Total arteriolar volume fraction ranged from 0.002 to 0.004 mm3/mm3 and in controls 65% of this was perfused. This percentage was reduced with atenolol and significantly increased with all other treatments except practolol. Thus, blockade of beta-1 adrenoceptors results in decreases in the percentage of perfused microvessels whereas stimulation of beta-2 adrenoceptors results in an increase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "11": "The role of prostanoids in the regulation of chick myoblast differentiation has been investigated. At 3 X 10(-6) M, indomethacin and chloroquine specifically inhibit cell fusion. They do not affect cell proliferation, alignment, or the expression of two muscle-specific proteins, namely, the acetylcholine receptor and the muscle-specific form of creatine phosphokinase. The results demonstrate that it is indomethacin's activity as an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis at the cyclooxygenase step that causes the block of cell fusion, whereas chloroquine probably acts at the earlier step of phospholipase A. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), but not prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), rapidly reverses the inhibition of fusion imposed by indomethacin or chloroquine. The dose response of the myoblasts to PGE1 is a bell-shaped curve with a 100% reversal of fusion at approximately 10(-9) M. Eicosatrienoate and linoleate reverse the inhibition of fusion with similar kinetics, whereas arachidonate is completely ineffective. The ability of PGE1 and eicosatrienoate but not PGE2 and arachidonate to restore fusion to control levels implies that fusion is specifically regulated by a prostanoid of the one series. The reversal of the fusion-block by linoleate further suggests that this fatty acid provides the necessary source of eicosatrienoate in the myoblast plasma membrane. At 10(-8) M and above, PGE1 and PGE2 stimulate adenylate cyclase and depress control fusion as does 10(-5) M isoproterenol. The beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol abolishes both isoproterenol's inhibition of myoblast fusion and its activation of adenylate cyclase. The similar depressions imposed on cell fusion by 10(-8)-10(-6) M prostanoid and 10(-5) M isoproterenol suggest that in both cases the depressive effects are mediated by cyclic AMP. It is concluded that a prostanoid of the one series regulates fusion by a cyclic AMP-independent mechanisms.", 
    "12": "Overdose with amitriptyline and other tricyclic antidepressants can result in ventricular conduction abnormalities as well as severe ventricular arrhythmias. The arrhythmogenic effects of these compounds may be attributed to their direct local anesthetic actions in blocking sodium channels in cardiac membranes. Thus tricyclic-induced ventricular arrhythmias usually do not respond well to therapy with standard Class I antiarrhythmic drugs that also have the same direct local anesthetic action and may potentiate the adverse effects of tricyclic antidepressants. Cardiac toxicity was produced in dogs by the administration of amitriptyline, both orally and IV. At serum concentrations less than 2,000 ng/mL, sinus tachycardia occurred with widened QRS complexes. At higher concentrations, QRS duration became more markedly prolonged and was followed by ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Occurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias was associated with QRS durations of more than 0.11 second. Sodium bicarbonate (18 to 36 mEq) administered IV over either 30 seconds or two minutes rapidly converted ventricular tachycardia to normal sinus rhythm. Conversion was associated with abbreviation of the QRS complex and was accompanied by a rise in both systolic and diastolic pressures. The duration of sodium bicarbonate effect paralleled the duration of the changes in arterial pH and plasma bicarbonate concentrations. In vitro studies in cardiac Purkinje fibers suggested that reversal of amitriptyline-induced cardiac membrane effects by sodium bicarbonate may be attributed not only to alkalinization but also to increased in extracellular sodium concentration, diminishing the local anesthetic action of amitriptyline and resulting in less sodium channel block.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "13": "Clones have been isolated from the human astrocytoma cell line G-CCM. Homogenates of clone D384 contain an adenylate cyclase that is stimulated by 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethylamine (dopamine), noradrenaline, and isoprenaline with Ka apparent values of 4, 56, and 2.7 microM, respectively. The Ka apparent value for dopamine was increased by the D-1 antagonist cis-flupenthixol, 25 and 100 nM, to 23 and 190 microM, respectively, but was unaffected by propranolol (1 microM). Noradrenaline stimulation of adenylate cyclase was only partially inhibited by either propranolol (10 microM) or cis-flupenthixol (1 microM). Propranolol (10 microM), but not cis-flupenthixol (1 microM), prevented stimulation by isoprenaline. The stimulation of adenylate cyclase by dopamine and noradrenaline remained unchanged in the presence of phentolamine (1 microM) and sulpiride (1 microM). These results suggest that clone D384 contains both D-1 dopaminergic and beta-adrenergic receptors coupled to adenylate cyclase. Dopamine stimulates D384 adenylate cyclase through D-1 receptors, isoprenaline via beta-receptors, and noradrenaline through both receptors.", 
    "14": "The purpose of the present study was to elucidate the effects of different kinds of autonomotropic drugs on the nasal mucosa as well as on the nasal reaction to specific allergens in patients with nasal allergy. First, phenylephrine (alpha-agonist), phentolamine (alpha-antagonist), isoproterenol (beta-agonist), propranolol (beta-antagonist), methacholine (choline agonist), or ipratropium (choline antagonist) was applied to the nasal mucosa with an atomizer using saline as control. Definitive effects appeared at the spray of alpha-agonist or choline agonist. Phenylephrine reduced nasal airway resistance, and methacholine increased nasal secretion. Secondly, after treatment with the drugs, nasal provocations were performed. The statistically significant effects were noted as follows: phenylephrine spray inhibited the increase of nasal airway resistance, while phentolamine or isoproterenol enhanced it. Methacholine enhanced nasal secretion, while ipratropium inhibited it. None of the drugs, however, affected the number of sneezes. The present results suggest that adrenergic receptors are mainly distributed on the walls of vessels and cholinergic receptors mainly on the secretory glands. Pharmacological conditions of the local autonomic nervous system would affect the nasal response in allergy in different ways according to different conditions.", 
    "15": "1. The effects of dietary polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and excess tyrosine on serum and liver lipids, urinary ascorbic acid and catecholamines were compared in male Wistar rats. 2. Serum levels of cholesterol, urinary ascorbic acid, norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine and histamine were significantly increased in rats given either PCB or excess tyrosine. 3. The hypercholesterolaemia induced by PCB or excess tyrosine was blocked by the adrenergic alpha-blocker, phenoxybenzamine. 4. The present results suggest causal interrelations between the hypercholesterolaemia induced by dietary PCB or excess tyrosine and the secretion of catecholamines.", 
    "16": "The effects of beta-adrenoceptor agonists on the clonidine-induced aggression in mice were studied. Clenbuterol (0.05-2 mg/kg ip), salbutamol (5-20 mg/kg ip) and terbutaline (10, 20 mg/kg ip) significantly potentiated the effect of clonidine. The enhancement of clonidine aggressiveness induced by clenbuterol (0.5 mg/kg) was prevented by propranolol (2.5, 5 mg/kg) and reduced by prazosin (1 mg/kg). The obtained results provide evidence that stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors facilitates the alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated behavior.", 
    "17": "The effects of beta-, and alpha 1-antagonists on the clenbuterol- and clonidine-induced depression of the exploratory activity was measured in rats in the open field test. The ability of clenbuterol (0.5 mg/kg) to reduce exploration was antagonized by 1-propranolol, significantly reduced by rauwolscine and unchanged by corynanthine and prazosin. Clonidine (0.2 mg/kg)-induced hypoactivity was significantly reduced by all the used adrenergic antagonists. A combined treatment with non-sedative doses of clenbuterol and clonidine significantly reduced exploration. Results suggest that both beta- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors are involved in clenbuterol- and clonidine-induced sedation. Moreover, they may indicate the existence of beta- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor interaction.", 
    "18": "A double-blind study of the effect of three beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs (beta-blockers) on exercise muscle blood flow (MBF) in 14 normotensive volunteers was carried out. MBF was measured by the xenon-133 clearance technique. MBF was not altered by placebo, sotalol or labetalol. Atenolol significantly reduced MBF compared with placebo, sotalol and labetalol. We conclude that sotalol and labetalol may be more useful than conventional beta-blockers for treatment of hypertension or angina in association with peripheral vascular disease.", 
    "19": "(-)-Pindolol antagonized competitively and to a similar extent the positive inotropic effects of both (-)-noradrenaline and (-)-adrenaline in human ventricular preparations. An equilibrium dissociation constant KD (-log mol 1(-1) = pKD) of 9.2-9.3 was estimated regardless of disease present or agonist used. (-)-Pindolol antagonized competitively the positive inotropic effects of (-)-adrenaline more than those of (-)-noradrenaline in human atrial preparations. pKD values of (-)-pindolol were 9.6 against (-)-adrenaline and 9.1 against (-)-noradrenaline. The results are consistent with a moderate selectivity of (-)-pindolol for beta 2-compared to beta 1-adrenoceptors in human atrium. (-)-Pindolol competed with [3H]-(-)-bupranolol with a pKD of 9.4 for beta-adrenoceptors of human ventricle. Positive inotropic effects of (-)-pindolol were not detected on human atrium or ventricle in a concentration range of 1-1000 nmol 1(-1). The affinity of (-)-pindolol estimated for human myocardial beta-adrenoceptors, its moderate beta 2-selectivity and its lack of intrinsic activity for contractile force agreed with similar characteristics in other species. (-)-Pindolol caused marked positive chronotropic effects in kitten right atria with an intrinsic activity of 0.5 with respect to catecholamines. On kitten left atria it caused only weak positive inotropic effects with an intrinsic activity of 0.1. (-)-Pindolol (0.6-6000 nmol-1) did not cause positive inotropic effects in kitten papillary muscle. The concentration-effect curve for (-)-pindolol on kitten right and left atria was biphasic. Its positive chronotropic and inotropic effects were not blocked by methysergide, suggesting that 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-receptors were not involved. Low concentrations of antagonists selective for beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors blocked the high sensitivity component but not the low sensitivity component of the positive chronotropic and inotropic effects. The biphasic nature of the positive chronotropic effects of (-)-pindolol in kitten agreed with previous observations made on guinea-pig right atria and support the concept that 3 receptors in the sinoatrial pacemaker contribute to these chronotropic effects: beta 1, beta 2 and a low-affinity receptor for (-)-pindolol which is neither beta 1 nor beta 2. The partial agonistic activity of (-)-pindolol in the heart appears to be mainly (kitten) or completely (man) restricted to the sinoatrial pacemaker.", 
    "20": "Atrial and ventricular chronotropic effects of the individual stereoisomers of propranolol, pindolol, metoprolol and penbutolol were studied in conscious dogs with chronic atrio-ventricular (A-V) block. Ventricular beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity was assessed for all drugs against isoprenaline under the same experimental conditions. At low doses, the stereoisomers of propranolol and penbutolol decreased atrial rate, whereas those of pindolol and metoprolol produced an increase. At higher doses, all drugs increased atrial rate. All drugs decreased ventricular rate dose-dependently except (+)-pindolol. Relative ventricular beta-blocking potencies of the (-)-isomers of propranolol, pindolol, metoprolol and penbutolol were respectively 38, 21, greater than 43 and 31 times higher than those of their corresponding (+)-isomers. In addition, beta-blocking potencies of (-)- and (+)-pindolol were respectively 60 and 120 times higher, those of (-)- and (+)-penbutolol 7 and 8 times higher and those of (-)- and (+)-metoprolol 4 and greater than 4 times weaker than those of (-)- and (+)-propranolol. At comparable levels of ventricular beta-adrenoceptor blockade, (-)-pindolol and (-)-metoprolol were more potent in producing ventricular bradycardia than their respective (+)-isomers, whereas (-)- and (+)-propranolol and (-)- and (+)-penbutolol were equiactive. In addition, regardless of which isomer was being studied, the order of ventricular bradycardiac potencies, at comparable levels of beta-adrenoceptor blockade, was metoprolol greater than propranolol greater than penbutolol greater than pindolol. In addition, regardless of which isomer was being studied, the order of ventricular bradycardiac potencies, at comparable levels of beta-adrenoceptor blockade, was metoprolol > propranolol > penbutolol >pindolol. 5 These results show that antagonism of beta-adrenoceptors in the ventricle is at least partly responsible for the ventricular bradycardiac effect produced by these drugs, but also that some other factor, apparently distinct from the membrane stabilizing activity, is involved, suggesting the existence of some other as yet unknown pharmacological property of the beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, especially evident in metoprolol. Finally, these results demonstrate that the intrinsic sympathomimetic activity exhibited by some of these drugs attenuate their bradycardiac effect.", 
    "21": "The cardiohemodynamic effects of nipradilol (K-351) were studied in comparison with those of propranolol, nadolol and prazosin in anesthetized, open-chest dogs. All drugs were administered intravenously. Nipradilol produced dose-dependent decreases in systemic blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), venous return (VR) and cardiac output (COP), but virtually no change in right atrial pressure (RAP). Propranolol decreased HR, tended to decrease VR and COP and increased RAP, but produced no change in systemic BP. Nadolol also decreased HR, VR and COP and increased RAP, but did not change systemic BP. Prazosin decreased systemic BP, VR and COP and tended to decrease RAP, but scarcely affected HR. After propranolol or nadolol, nipradilol failed to reduce HR, but still produced definite decreases in systemic BP, VR and COP and a slight decrease in RAP. After prazosin, nipradilol still produced decreases in systemic BP, HR, VR and COP. These results suggest that nipradilol decreases VR and COP mainly by increasing venous capacitance through direct venodilator action and in part by increasing resistance to VR through beta-adrenoceptor blockade. This effect also appears to be responsible for its hypotensive effect.", 
    "22": "Several clinical papers have reported that beta-adrenoceptor antagonists were useful in the management of schizophrenia and tardive dyskinesia. The present study examined effects of beta-antagonists on haloperidol (HAL)-induced catalepsy using mice in order to study the relationship between beta-antagonists and central dopaminergic functions. Catalepsy was tested by the standard bar test 30 min after intraperitoneal treatment of HAL. Beta-antagonists were administered subcutaneously just after HAL-treatment. Propranolol, alprenolol, oxprenolol and pindolol increased the incidence of catalepsy compared to HAL alone. Atenolol, not penetrating into the brain, and the sedative and hypnotic drug chlordiazepoxide did not potentiate it. These results suggest that the potentiation of HAL-catalepsy by beta-antagonists is based on their central action. Therefore, a central beta-receptor appears to be implicated in the regulation of the central dopaminergic functions.", 
    "23": "This paper briefly reviews the current knowledge regarding the effects of hypertension and of antihypertensive drugs on the arterial wall and their possible influence on atherogenesis. The potential clinical implications of the experimental data are discussed, and the following recommendations are made regarding therapy of the hypertensive patient: 1) Management of associated hyperlipoproteinemia, even if mild, would appear to be essential in the hypertensive patient because hypertension does not appear to promote atherosclerosis appreciably when plasma cholesterol levels are low. 2) In the mild hypertensive with diastolic blood pressure from 90-95 mmHg without associated target-organ damage or other major risk factors, treatment of the hypertension should primarily be nonpharmacologic in nature. 3) Hypertensive subjects receiving antihypertensive drugs that can have an adverse effect on plasma lipoproteins should have plasma lipids monitored closely; if unfavorable effects occur, revision of therapy should be considered. 4) Major attempts should be made to reduce other risk factors as well, particularly smoking. 5) Because of inherent difficulties in reversing atherosclerosis, treatment of hypertension and other abnormal risk factors should be instituted early in life before severe disease has developed. Finally, research efforts should intensified to delineate the mechanisms by which hypertension and antihypertensive drugs affect the arterial wall and to develop new approaches for protection against arterial injury.", 
    "24": "The density of beta adrenoceptors, the relative number of beta 1 and beta 2 adrenoceptor subtypes, and adenylate cyclase activity were studied in preparations from atrial biopsy specimens of 32 patients with coronary heart disease. Six patients were not receiving beta blocking agents, whereas the others were treated with different beta blocking drugs (timolol, propranolol, pindolol, metoprolol, and atenolol). Clinical and haemodynamic variables were similar in the different groups of patients. Beta adrenoceptor density was 17% significantly lower in the non-treated group than in the groups treated with beta blocking drugs. Among these, the group treated with pindolol, a drug with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, had receptor densities that were 38% significantly higher than those treated with other beta blocking drugs and 51% significantly higher than the non-treated group. The relative numbers of beta 1 and beta 2 adrenoceptor subtypes were very similar in the different groups (beta 1 receptors 75-80%, beta 2 receptors 20-25%). A significant increase in the ratios of terbutaline stimulated to basal and terbutaline stimulated to isoproterenol stimulated adenylate cyclase activities was found in patients treated with beta 1 selective blockers (metoprolol, atenolol), indicating that beta 1 selective drugs may improve beta 2 receptor-adenylate cyclase coupling. In contrast, pindolol caused a significant reduction in the ratio of terbutaline stimulated to isoproterenol stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, indicating that this drug may cause a reduction in beta 2 receptor-adenylate cyclase coupling efficacy. Thus treatment with beta blocking agents causes upregulation of human myocardial beta receptor density. Intrinsic sympathomimetic activity seems to favour receptor upregulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "25": "beta-Blocking drugs are widely used throughout the world and serious adverse reactions are relatively uncommon. Most of those which do occur are pharmacologically predictable and may be avoided by ensuring that patients who are to be given beta-blockers do not have a predisposition to the development of bronchospasm, cardiac failure or peripheral ischaemia. In some situations, the use of a beta 1-selective blocking drug may reduce the risk of a severe adverse reaction, but there is little evidence that other ancillary properties such as partial agonist activity are of relevance in this context. Long term experience with many of the beta-blockers in current use suggests that unpredictable major adverse reactions such as the practolol oculomucocutaneous syndrome are unlikely to be repeated, although some of these drugs may be associated with immunological disturbances and some have been implicated in the development of retroperitoneal fibrosis. beta-Blocking drugs appear to be associated with a number of subjective side effects including muscle fatigue, peripheral coldness and some neurological symptoms. These side effects are highly subjective and are therefore difficult to quantify and it is not known whether they are of major importance in terms of their effect upon patients' overall well-being. It cannot be assumed that simply because such side effects can be elicited that they do, in fact, matter. However, because beta-blockers are often prescribed for patients who have no symptoms and for whom the benefits of therapy are generally small, such side effects would be of considerable importance if they had an overall effect upon quality of life. There are theoretical reasons to suppose that the incidence and severity of such side effects may be related to the ancillary properties of the individual drugs, but there is little evidence that parameters such as beta 1-selectivity, or partial agonist activity are clinically important determinants of the severity of these side effects. Lipophilicity, however, may be associated with an increased incidence of neurological symptoms. beta-Blocking drugs may cause a variety of metabolic disturbances including an increase in serum VLDL-cholesterol concentrations. However, long term studies have not shown that such disturbances are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, indicating that such metabolic changes may not be of major importance in practice. beta-Blocking drugs may be involved in a number of interactions with other drugs, but few of these have been shown to be of clinical significance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "26": "Cardiac hemodynamics and myocardial contractility were examined in patients with acute myocardial infarction during urgent aorto-coronary shunting with and without beta-adrenergic blockers. The beta-blockers were shown to have a protective effect, as reflected in a smaller myocardial strain owing to a decrease in heart rate, stroke and cardiac outputs, and pulmonary arterial blood pressure. Propranolol proved the most effective agent, whereas visken produced the smallest effect.", 
    "27": "It has been reported that beta blockers are not effective antihypertensives in black populations. A review of the literature revealed that, for the most part, studies drawing this conclusion were of small sample size, lacked controls, and did not represent the demographics of the US black population. The largest US study (Veterans Administration Cooperative Study) showed propranolol to be effective in at least one half of the black patients, with white patients responding better, but diuretics were more effective in both races. More recent studies show beta blockers with alpha-antagonistic properties to be effective in black hypertensives. The question is raised whether enough data have been analyzed to suggest these drugs are ineffective for black hypertensives.", 
    "28": "The side-effect profile of labetalol was assessed in 34 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension who had previously experienced side effects during beta-blocker therapy. The most frequently reported beta-blocker side effects were fatigue, impotence, cold extremities, and depression. After discontinuing their previous beta-blocker for 4 weeks, labetalol was titrated (100-400 mg b.i.d.) to achieve blood pressure control. Twenty-seven of 34 patients did not have a recurrence of a beta-blocker related side effect while receiving labetalol. The most common new side effect with labetalol was dizziness (3 patients). As judged by the attending physician and the patient, labetalol was better tolerated than conventional beta-blocker therapy in 30 of 34 patients (88%). Twenty-four of 34 patients (71%) preferred labetalol over previous therapy. Labetalol controlled blood pressure in 30 of 34 patients (88%). At equal antihypertensive doses, some side effects common to beta-blockers are seen less frequently with labetalol.", 
    "29": "With the current availability of a plethora not only of blood pressure-lowering medications but also of classes thereof and the concern that the long-term use of some of these may result in adverse effects which may offset their benefits has come the recognition of the importance of the choice of an initial antihypertensive agent. Indeed, the initially chosen medication will often be taken for the longest time. The purpose of this review is to consider nine of the major factors permitting a rational choice of medication: antihypertensive efficacy, mechanism of action, safety, patient acceptance (quality of life), cost, numbers of doses per day, need for laboratory follow-up, potential interactions with other drugs, and additional salutary effects. The question of the role of nondiuretic monotherapy is, of necessity, an integral component of this discussion. Preliminary data indicate that the use of this approach with some of the newer agents, including converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers, constitutes excellent therapy, at least in certain patients. Finally, because one of the new approaches to antihypertensive therapy is comprehensive risk management, the effect of medication on the lipid profile is considered in some detail.", 
    "30": "Previous studies have demonstrated that there is a disproportionate increase in connective tissue in right ventricular myocardium subjected to pressure-overload hypertrophy associated with depressed cardiac contractility. While the myocardium is primarily responsive to load, the aim of the present study was to determine whether catecholamines also modulate the response of myocardial tissue components and cardiocyte organelles in pressure-overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Four experimental groups of cats were examined: a sham-operated control group, a group which had their pulmonary arteries banded in order to induce a pressure overload, a group which had been subjected to the same pressure overload, but in addition had beta-adrenoceptor blockade produced prior to and during the pressure overloading, and a group which had been subjected to the same pressure overload, but in addition had alpha-adrenoceptor blockade produced prior to and maintained during the pressure overloading. As in our previous study, there was a significant and equivalent degree of right ventricular hypertrophy in all experimental groups with pressure overload when assessed either as the ratio of right ventricular weight to body weight or as cardiocyte cross-sectional area. At the light microscopic level, the disproportionate increase in the volume density of myocardial connective tissue seen in banded animals was completely prevented by either alpha- or beta-adrenoceptor blockade. At the electron microscopic level, there was a reduction in the mitochondrial and myofibrillar volume fractions following beta-adrenoceptor blockade. The results of this study provide evidence for a modulatory role of catecholamines in the control of myocardial connective-tissue proliferation in pressure-overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy. There is also evidence to support the role of the adrenergic nervous system in regulating cardiocyte subcellular organelles, independent of the regulation of cardiocyte size.", 
    "31": "In order to settle the question about whether or not opioid peptides stimulate or inhibit insulin secretion, we studied effects of rimorphin and dynorphin, two members of the preproenkephalin B group, on glucose-induced insulin secretion in the isolated, perfused rat pancreas. These peptides (3.95 X 10(-8) M), like morphine (3.95 X 10(-8) M), significantly inhibited the glucose-induced insulin secretion. The inhibitory effect of rimorphin was attenuated by naloxone (1.2 X 10(-6) M) and phentolamine (10(-6) M), suggesting an involvement of adrenergic alpha receptors in the inhibition of glucose-induced insulin secretion mediated through specific opiate receptors. Rimorphin also inhibited glucose-induced insulin secretion even in the cysteamine-treated rat pancreas from which somatostatin had been depleted. Thus, somatostatin does not appear to play a major regulatory role in the insulin secretion in the pancreas.", 
    "32": "The Swedish trial in old patients with hypertension was initiated by the Swedish League against Hypertension. It will be conducted as a prospective multicentre study in Swedish primary health care, and will comprise approximately 2 000 patients on active treatment and 2 000 on placebo to be studied for three years. The primary goal with this study is to investigate whether pharmacological treatment of hypertension in men and women aged 70-84 years will reduce the incidence of fatal and nonfatal cardiac and cerebrovascular disease. Before starting the main trial a pilot study comprising 400 patients will be carried out during one year to evaluate all logistical aspects of the study. This pilot study commenced in October 1985.", 
    "33": "A kinetic model has been employed to compare the duration of the antihypertensive activity of indenolol to its plasma half-life both after single administration and at steady-state. After a 14 day run-in period with placebo, 60 or 120 mg indenolol were given to hypertensive patients I or II grade, according to W.H.O. guidelines, once a day for 14 days. Blood samples were drawn and blood pressure recorded at intervals after the first dose, during treatment and after the last dose of the compound. Both plasma concentration and mean arterial pressure difference curves were fitted by a first order input-output model, where plasma half-life was 4 h, while pharmacological half-life was 24 h for both dose-levels tested. Therefore, with once-a-day dose regimen an accumulation of the antihypertensive effect of indenolol was demonstrated, with 99% steady-state of blood pressure reached after 7 days, while the drug did not accumulate in the central compartment.", 
    "34": "Chronic administration of acebutolol (15 mg kg-1 s.c. three times a week for five weeks, then 30 mg kg-1 for three weeks) did not lower blood pressure in 17 and 33 weeks-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). At the end of this treatment, the plasma concentrations of acebutolol and diacetolol were measured by HPLC. After 24 h, acebutolol was absent from plasma while diacetolol was lower after chronic treatment than after acute administration. Twenty-four hours after the last injection of acebutolol, both isoprenaline-induced tachycardia and vasodilatation were reduced. The vasomotor agents, noradrenaline, bradykinin and angiotensin, exhibited the same activity in control and treated SHR. These findings suggest that the lack of antihypertensive effect of acebutolol in SHR may be the result of a decrease in diacetolol formation together with blockade of beta 2 vascular receptors.", 
    "35": "The cardiotoxic effects of hydralazine and prenalterol, given alone and in combination, were assessed in rats and rabbits. Acute myocardial necrosis was induced by a single administration of each drug alone in rats. However, the incidence and severity of lesions were markedly enhanced when both drugs were given in combination. Rats that received the same treatment for 10 consecutive days showed minimal or no acute necrosis, demonstrating the development of a resistance to further cardiotoxic effects of the drugs. Rabbits showed only minimal lesions when either drug was used alone and no enhancement of lesions when they were given in combination. From these data, it is concluded that the possibility of a cardiotoxic interaction exists when these drugs are used in combination and that the heavy rat (500-600 g) is a more sensitive model than the rabbit for studies of this nature.", 
    "36": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of catecholamines on motility of stomach and intestine in chronic experiments on dogs with fistulas in stomach and duodenum. The contractions of stomach and duodenum were registered by a balloon method. It was established that i.v. adrenaline and noradrenaline injections in dogs with intact vagi inhibited food-induced motility in stomach and duodenum and did not produce contractions in the empty and quiescent gastrointestinal tract. Beta-adrenoagonist isoprenaline on the contrary produced stomach and duodenum contractions in fed dogs during the quiescent period. In fed dogs isoprenaline caused a 3-phasic reaction: a phase of primary short-term suppression of stomach and duodenum motility, a phase of motility increase and a phase of secondary suppression of stomach and duodenum motility. The contractions evoked by isoprenaline in the stomach resemble in amplitude and shape, periodical activities which are typical for fasting dogs. Vagotomy intensified isoprenaline motor effects in hungry and fed dogs and eliminated the phase of primary suppression in fed dogs. The isoprenaline effects were blocked by propranolol, but not by phentolamine. They were decreased more effectively in the stomach by atropine and by hexomethonium in the duodenum.", 
    "37": "We used radioligand binding techniques and measurement of beta-agonist-mediated positive inotropic responses in isolated cardiac tissue to examine beta-adrenergic-receptor subpopulations in nonfailing and failing human left and right ventricular myocardium. In tissue derived from 48 human hearts the receptor subtypes identified in nonfailing ventricle by radioligand binding were beta 1 (77%) and beta 2 (23%), with no evidence of an \"atypical\" beta-adrenergic receptor. In failing left ventricle the beta 1:beta 2 ratio was markedly different, i.e., 60:38. This decrease in the beta 1 proportion and increase in the beta 2 proportion in the failing ventricles were due to a 62%, \"selective\" down-regulation of the beta 1 subpopulation, with little or no change in beta 2 receptors. In muscle bath experiments in isolated trabeculae derived from nonfailing and failing right ventricles, both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors were coupled to a positive inotropic response. In nonfailing myocardium, beta 1 responses predominated, as the selective beta 1 agonist denopamine produced a response that was 66% of the total contractile response of isoproterenol. In heart failure the beta 1 component was markedly decreased, while the beta 2 component was not significantly diminished. Moreover, in heart failure the beta 2 component increased in prominence, as the contractile response to the selective beta 2 agonist zinterol increased from a minority (39%) to a majority (60%) of the total response generated by isoproterenol. We conclude that failing human ventricular myocardium contains a relatively high proportion of beta 2 receptors, due to selective down-regulation of beta 1 receptors. As a result, in the failing human heart the beta 2-receptor subpopulation is a relatively important mediator of inotropic support in response to nonselective beta-agonist stimulation and is available for inotropic stimulation by selective beta 2 agonists.", 
    "38": "The pharmacodynamic profile of bisoprolol, a new beta 1-selective adrenoceptor antagonist, was investigated in four independent studies including 36 healthy male volunteers. Using the model of exercise-induced tachycardia (ET) the beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties of bisoprolol (2.5-40 mg) were examined in comparison to metoprolol (50 and 100 mg), propranolol (40 and 80 mg) and atenolol (50 and 100 mg). The maximal reduction of ET was achieved between 1 and 4 h following single oral administration. The dose-response relationship using individual maximal reduction of ET showed, on a molar basis, that bisoprolol is about 5, 7 and 10 times more effective than propranolol, atenolol and metoprolol, respectively. In the model of insulin-induced hypoglycaemia bisoprolol behaved as a beta 1-selective adrenoceptor antagonist. There was a good correlation (r = 0.94) between the log bisoprolol concentration and the reduction in exercise-induced tachycardia. Bisoprolol is a potent new cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with a competitive action at beta 1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "39": "During the past decade, advances in basic and applied cardiology have led to the introduction of several new antiarrhythmic drugs that have distinct clinical advantages over their older counterparts. These therapeutic advantages comprise either a more favorable pharmacokinetic disposition in the patient or new and perhaps novel mechanisms of antiarrhythmic actions. The class IV agent verapamil, for example, selectively blocks the slow inward Ca++ current in excitable tissues and this action is proving to be quite effective in controlling supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Tocainide is a newly approved class I agent that exerts lidocaine-like effectiveness in treating serious ventricular arrhythmias. Unlike lidocaine, however, tocainide is not restricted to intensive care because it is effective after oral administration and has comparatively longer duration of antiarrhythmic action. Other recently approved or investigational agents include bretylium and amiodarone (class III), and aprindine, mexiletine, and disopyramide (class I). Along with clinical advantages, however, each drug has a characteristic pharmacologic-toxicologic profile and resulting spectrum of therapeutic application for only particular cardiac dysrhythmias. The advantages and disadvantages of each compound should be weighed equally when the new antiarrhythmic drugs are assessed as therapeutic alternatives for the older ones.", 
    "40": "Recent advancements in cardiac pharmacology and physiology have led to the identification of many new antiarrhythmic drugs and a better understanding of basic arrhythmogenic mechanisms. These parallel developments prompted a new nomenclature system for classifying the clinically important antiarrhythmic drugs according to their predominant electrophysiologic actions in cardiac cells. Antiarrhythmic drugs are now grouped into 4 main classes: classes I through IV. Class I agents comprise the standard membrane-stabilizing drugs such as lidocaine, quinidine, and procainamide; newer class I agents include disopyramide, aprindine, tocainide, and flecainide. Class II agents decrease sympathoadrenal excitation of the heart, and the clinically relevant members of this type act through blockade of the cardiac beta 1-adrenergic receptors; propranolol is the prototype. Class III agents selectively prolong the cardiac action potential and refractory period, and bretylium and amiodarone represent this group. Class IV agents are the calcium entry blocking drugs such as verapamil. An understanding of this classification system is essential to the internist and cardiologist who are beset with an emerging array of new antiarrhythmic drugs and affiliated pharmacodynamic terminologies.", 
    "41": "Four groups of mice were subjected to controlled fatal head trauma and then evaluated for the presence of ascites (neurogenic hyperacute ascites, NHA). The animals died virtually instantaneously and without evidence of maintained pain or suffering. The volume of ascites was determined in one group of animals. Two of the traumatized groups were pretreated, one with the beta-blocker propranolol and the other with the alpha-blocker phentolamine. A fifth, non-traumatized, group which was killed with either inhalation served as a control group. Two more groups of non-traumatized mice were administered either the alpha-adrenergic agonist methoxamine hydrochloride or the beta-agonist isoethrane mesylate before killing by ether inhalation, and then evaluated for ascites. Transudative ascitic fluid was found in 87-100% of untreated traumatized mice and in no control animals. Pretreatment with phentolamine had no effect on the prevalence of ascites. Pretreatment with propranolol produced a significant decrease in the prevalence of ascites compared with trauma alone (P less than 0.001). Isoethrane (beta-agonist) administration caused ascites in 100% of the treated animals. Methoxamine (alpha-agonist) administration did not cause ascites. A previously undescribed consequence of acute brain trauma is described (NHA) which appears to be mediated by beta-sympathetic activity of central origin. NHA is inhibited by beta-blockade and can be simulated with beta-agonist administration.", 
    "42": "Fifty eyes of 40 patients with glaucoma underwent extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber lens implantation. Their visual results and early postoperative complications were compared with those of eyes in an age-matched group of patients without glaucoma after the same procedure. Substantial increases in early postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) occurred in 62% of the glaucomatous eyes and in only 10% of the normal eyes. The level of best visual acuity was slightly worse (20/40) on average in the glaucomatous eyes than in the nonglaucomatous eyes (20/25). At six months after surgery, 82.5% of the nonfiltered glaucomatous eyes needed the same number of or additional glaucoma medications to maintain an IOP of less than 20 mm Hg. Ten of the glaucomatous eyes underwent trabeculectomy along with cataract surgery due to inadequate IOP control while the patient was receiving maximum medical therapy. Control was substantially improved, with 100% of these patients receiving the same number of or fewer medications at six months. By one year, only 30% of these patients required the same number of medications postoperatively as preoperatively, but all had IOP control.", 
    "43": "To study the previously undefined effects of calcium entry blockade on left ventricular (LV) function and coronary blood flow during dynamic exercise we gave intravenous equihypotensive infusions of nifedipine (10 +/- 4 SE micrograms X kg-1 X min-1), diltiazem (60 +/- 8 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1), and verapamil (52 +/- 7 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1) before and after intravenous propranolol (2 mg/kg) to chronically instrumented dogs at rest and while running on a treadmill at 4 and 10 km/h. Prior to beta-blockade, each agent significantly and equivalently (P = NS among drugs) reduced mean arterial pressure during exercise (-13% nifedipine, -8% diltiazem, -15% verapamil at 4 km/h, each P less than or equal to 0.01 vs. exercise alone) but did not significantly alter LV end-diastolic dimension (EDD), heart rate, or cardiac output compared with exercise alone. Only verapamil blunted the positive inotropic response to exercise (LV dP/dtmax decreased 20% at 4 km/h, P less than 0.01 vs. exercise alone). Coronary blood flow was significantly and equivalently increased at rest and during submaximal exercise with each calcium blocker, but this effect was largely offset by propranolol. During exercise after beta-blockade each agent produced significant additional reductions in mean arterial pressure and dP/dtmax at peak exercise but did not alter LVEDD or heart rate compared with results obtained with propranolol alone. Combined beta-blockade and verapamil uniquely diminished myocardial contractility to a greater extent at peak exercise than at rest (dP/dtmax 1,260 +/- 410 peak exercise vs. 1,775 +/- 431 mmHg/s rest, P less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "44": "Coronary blood flow and epicardial coronary artery diameter were simultaneously measured by an electromagnetic or Doppler flow probe and a pair of ultrasonic crystals, respectively, during reactive hyperemia in conscious dogs. Reactive dilation appeared after the full appearance of reactive hyperemia and lasted for a period of 4-20 times the duration of the coronary occlusion. beta-Receptor blockade (propranolol, 1 mg/kg iv) attenuated both the reactive hyperemia in volume by 21-22% (P less than 0.01) and dilative responses of the epicardial coronary diameter by 27-28% (P less than 0.01), despite a nonsignificant attenuation of the resting or peak hyperemic coronary blood flow. When coronary blood flow was held constant during reperfusion, by an occluder distal to the ultrasonic crystals, the reactive dilation disappeared. A peculiar reactive constriction was noted when coronary occlusion was performed proximal to the site of the ultrasonic crystals. Appearance of this constriction was at 149 and 385 s after the release of 5 and 60 s of coronary occlusion, respectively. This late reactive constriction disappeared after pretreatment with alpha- (phentolamine, 1 mg/kg iv) and/or alpha- + beta-blockade, but not with beta-blockade alone, and it was not observed when the coronary diameter was measured proximal to the occluder. Thus reactive dilation of the epicardial coronary artery derives from an increase in coronary flow and is reduced by propranolol via a reduction in the hyperemic flow, suggesting a flow-dependent change in the diameter of the epicardial coronary artery. Reactive constriction is a local phenomenon following marked reduction in the coronary diameter and is abolished by alpha-adrenergic blockade with phentolamine.", 
    "45": "The role of intravenously (iv) injected adrenergic agonists in the pulsatile secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) was examined in unanesthesized, freely behaving, castrated male rats. The alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonist, clonidine (25 micrograms/kg), and the alpha 1-adrenergic agonist, (-)-phenylephrine (12.5 micrograms/kg), did not significantly alter pulsatile release of LH. The physiological beta 2-adrenergic receptor agonist, (-)-epinephrine (2.5 micrograms/kg), significantly increased the mean plasma concentrations of plasma LH and the amplitude of the LH pulses over a period of 70 min. The specific beta 2-receptor agonist, salmefamol, significantly increased the mean plasma concentrations of LH and especially the average amplitude of LH pulses over 70-80 min in a dose-related fashion following the injection of doses from 25 to 125 micrograms/kg. The frequency of LH pulses was not significantly increased by either agonist at any of the doses employed. Salmefamol-induced increases in plasma LH could be prevented by the beta-adrenergic blocker, bornaprolol (FM-24), in a dose-related manner. When injected together with synthetic LH-releasing hormone (400 ng/kg), salmefamol (125 micrograms/kg) significantly increased the mean plasma concentrations of LH over 70 min compared with values in controls receiving LH-releasing hormone only. The data support the concept that beta-agonists act on their receptors in the pituitary to facilitate LH-releasing hormone-induced discharge of LH.", 
    "46": "Insulin increases O2 consumption by 25-30% in perfused rat muscle following intense exercise. The object of the present study was to characterize further the basis for this finding. Toward this end, O2 consumption was measured in the perfused hindquarter of rats either following a treadmill run or muscle contractions induced by electrical stimulations of the sciatic nerve. The results indicate that the increase in O2 consumption induced by insulin varies with the intensity of exercise, that it is initiated by factors generated locally rather than systemically, and that it is not attenuated by alpha or beta-adrenergic blockade. The results also demonstrated that the increase in O2 consumption is substantially diminished if glucose is not added to the perfusion medium.", 
    "47": "Efficacy and safety of esmolol in the treatment of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (SVT) was evaluated in this open-label, baseline-controlled, multicenter study. One hundred sixty patients with SVT received an intravenous infusion of esmolol in doses ranging from 25 to 300 micrograms/kg/min for up to 24 hours. All of the 160 patients were evaluated for safety, and 147 of them were eligible for evaluation of therapeutic response. Therapeutic response was defined as greater than or equal to 15% reduction in the average baseline heart rate of conversion to normal sinus rhythm. Seventy-nine percent (116 of 147) of the patients exhibited a therapeutic response. The cumulative percentage response increased significantly with increasing esmolol doses up to 200 micrograms/kg/min. The mean (+/- SEM) dose of esmolol producing a therapeutic response was 97.2 +/- 5.5 micrograms/kg/min. Among all patients (n = 160), 39% exhibited hypotension. In 58% of these patients, hypotension resolved with or without adjustment of the esmolol dose while the infusion continued; among almost all of the remaining patients, hypotension resolved within 30 minutes after esmolol was discontinued. Most patients at risk for adverse effects during beta blockade (i.e., those with diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, asthma, etc.) tolerated esmolol therapy, and there were no clinically important trends among the reported changes in laboratory variables. The results of the study indicate that esmolol is effective and well tolerated for the treatment of SVT.", 
    "48": "The relationship between occupancy of beta adrenergic receptors and stimulation of adenylate cyclase in dog atrial tissue was examined by studying the binding of [125I]iodopindolol and the activation of adenylate cyclase. Computer-assisted nonlinear regression analysis was used to analyze the inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity by beta-1- or beta-2-selective antagonists. The Ki values for each subtype of receptor for the selective antagonists resulting from studies of the inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity were similar to those determined in studies of the inhibition of the binding of [125I]iodopindolol. To compare further the occupancy of beta-1 or beta-2 adrenergic receptors with the activation of adenylate cyclase mediated by each class of receptor, computer modeling of the stimulation of adenylate cyclase by the beta-1-selective agonist norepinephrine was carried out. The EC50 values of norepinephrine for each receptor subtype, as measured in studies of norepinephrine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, were similar to the Ki values for the inhibition by norepinephrine of the binding of [125I]iodopindolol to each receptor subtype. The data led to the conclusion that beta-1 adrenergic receptors make up about 70% of the total number of beta adrenergic receptors and mediate 70% of the increase in adenylate cyclase activity produced by isoproterenol. These results suggest that the relationship between occupancy of each class of receptor and activation of adenylate cyclase is linear and that, when agonist-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity is used as a functional response, neither spare beta-1 nor spare beta-2 adrenergic receptors exist in the atrium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "49": "To further define the capacity for recovery after acute phase electrical and mechanical injury in patients with Q wave myocardial infarction who were treated with standard measures, 120 lead body surface potential maps and radionuclide angiograms were recorded at day 5 before discharge and month 6 after infarction in 23 patients with a first infarction (12 anterior and 11 inferior by standard 12 lead electrocardiographic criteria). In addition to assessment of spatial changes in electrocardiographic and wall motion patterns, five quantitative variables were evaluated: minimal Q zone integral, sigma Q wave integral, maximal ST integral, left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular wall motion abnormality score. From day 5 to month 6 after infarction, the only change in the inferior infarction group was a gain in sigma Q wave (-91 +/- 40 mu V X s X 10(2) to -68 +/- 24 mu V X s X 10(2); p less than 0.05). In contrast, all variables improved over the same time period in the anterior infarction group: Q zone minimum, -34 +/- 20 to -24 +/- 13 mu V X s (p less than 0.05); sigma Q wave, -160 +/- 122 X 10(2) to -120 +/- 90 mu V X s X 10(2) (p less than 0.05); ST maximum, 44 +/- 19 to 18 +/- 9 mu V X s (p less than 0.01); ejection fraction, 54 +/- 7 to 63 +/- 17% (p less than 0.05); and wall motion score, 6 +/- 3 to 3 +/- 3 (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Trained rats ran 1 h/d at 26.8 m/min, 15% grade, 5 d/wk, 10 wk. Both beta-antagonists were given at doses that decreased exercise heart rates by 25%. Training increased skeletal muscle citrate synthase, cytochrome c oxidase (Cyt-Ox), carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT), beta-hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase, mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (MDH), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities significantly in the TC group, but not in TP. These enzyme activities, except Cyt-Ox and CPT, were also significantly increased in TA. Hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity did not alter with training or beta-blockade. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase activity was lower in TC than in SC, but unchanged in TP or TA. Hepatic mitochondrial MDH and ALT activities increased with training only in TC. It is concluded that beta 2-adrenergic mechanisms play an essential role in the training-induced enzymatic adaptation in skeletal muscle.", 
    "51": "Metastatic pheochromocytoma, a rare complication of pregnancy, was managed from 30 weeks' gestation until delivery three weeks later with a combination of alpha-adrenergic blockade (Minipres) beta-adrenergic blockade (Timolol), and dopamine synthesis inhibition (Demser). The biophysical parameters of fetal heart rate (FHR) baseline, variability, and reactivity, as well as fetal breathing movements, body movements, tone, and amniotic fluid volume were followed sequentially during this period. A 1450-g growth-retarded infant, who subsequently did well, was delivered by cesarean section; the mother received combined surgical and medical therapy for her metastatic disease in the postpartum period. The initial fetal biophysical alteration observed was a reduction in mean FHR baseline rate; further biophysical test abnormalities appeared only after overt fetal compromise was evident. Sequential multiple parameter biophysical testing in such circumstances appears to be a valid and valuable approach to antepartum management.", 
    "52": "The two standard methods of computation of the time constant of the isovolumic single exponential decay of the left ventricular pressure were compared in anaesthetised, artificially ventilated, closed chest dogs in 87 experiments. In 23 additional experiments, carried out under basal steady state conditions, the time constant attained a mean (SD) value of 32(5) ms when computed according to the method with zero pressure asymptote assumption (Tz) and 39(7) ms when estimated according to a fit with variable pressure asymptote (Tv). Phenylephrine infusion significantly prolonged Tz from 31(6) to 46(12) and Tv from 39(7) to 92(52) ms. The increase in Tv was significantly greater than that in Tz. Propranolol increased Tv by 50% but Tz remained unaltered. Isoproterenol significantly decreased Tz from 33(2) to 18(3) and Tv from 38(3) to 29(3) ms. The decrease in Tz was significantly greater than that in Tv. Calcium chloride and atrial pacing decreased time constants, but volume loading by dextran infusion did not affect them. With regard to the whole material, the linear regression analysis yielded 0.776 as the coefficient of correlation between Tz and Tv. The two methods of time constant calculation appeared to diverge significantly always when changes in afterload or sympathetic activity were involved. These results indicate the dependence of relaxation on afterload but the independence on preload or ejection timing. In the light of these results the zero pressure asymptote method is recommended for the time constant computation as the practical choice when relaxation of the intact left ventricle is assessed.", 
    "53": "Effects of ketanserin on the pacemaker activity and atrial contractility and on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-induced cardiac responses were investigated in the isolated, blood-perfused dog atrium. Ketanserin (1-300 micrograms) injected into the sinus node artery evoked a transient positive followed by a negative chronotropic effect, and a dose above 30 micrograms of ketanserin produced a dose-dependent negative inotropic effect with a little positive one. Ketanserin-induced negative chronotropic and inotropic effects were not affected by atropine in a dose which blocked ACh-induced responses. Propranolol inhibited positive inotropic responses to ketanserin and norepinephrine and significantly augmented the negative chronotropic and inotropic responses to ketanserin. Imipramine did not affect the transient positive followed by negative chronotropic and the negative inotropic responses to ketanserin but it induced the positive cardiac responses following the negative ones. Tetrodotoxin, phentolamine, and diphenhydramine did not modify the effects of ketanserin. From these results, it is concluded that ketanserin might induce the direct negative chronotropic and inotropic effects and the indirect effects by catecholamine release. Ketanserin-induced catecholamine release might not be due to tyramine-like or nicotine-like action. Ketanserin significantly inhibited a low dose (3 micrograms) of 5-HT-induced negative chronotropic and inotropic effects, suggesting the possibility of 5-HT2 receptors in the isolated dog atrium.", 
    "54": "The cardiovascular effects of single oral doses of nifedipine (20 mg), atenolol (50 mg), or of their combination were compared with placebo in a double-blind randomized cross-over study in 10 normotensive volunteers. After subjects rested for 2 h, before drug administration, heart rate, blood pressure, stroke volume index, and cardiac index were measured noninvasively. These cardiovascular parameters were then determined prior to and after exercise periods (160 W, 10 min, bicycle ergometry) which were performed 40, 70, 130, 190, 310 min, and 22 h after drug intake. Nifedipine decreased resting diastolic blood pressure (p less than or equal to 0.05) after 2 h, whereas systolic blood pressure remained unchanged and heart rate significantly increased at rest and after exercise. Stroke volume index and cardiac index were unaffected. Atenolol significantly decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as heart rate; stroke volume index following exercise increased significantly, and cardiac index was unchanged. Administration of the combination caused a significantly more pronounced fall of systolic and diastolic blood pressure as compared with either drug alone, whereas the negative chronotropic effect was not different from that of atenolol. As did atenolol, the combination increased stroke volume index after exercise with no change in cardiac index. Maximum plasma concentrations of nifedipine (37.1 +/- 16.7 ng/ml) and atenolol (276.3 +/- 107.2 ng/ml) and terminal half-life of atenolol (9.9 +/- 2.6 h) were not altered by combined administration of the drugs.", 
    "55": "The chronotropic effects of propafenone were studied in the conscious dog with chronic atrioventricular block. Propafenone at 0.5-4 mg/kg, i.e., at plasma levels within the assumed therapeutic range, dose relatedly raises atrial rate. This effect falls off and bradycardia is even observed at 0.5 and 1 mg/kg once plasma levels have dropped below 330 +/- 31 ng/ml. After atropine, propafenone (2 mg/kg) lowers atrial rate, after propranolol it raises it, and after pindolol it does not modify it. Propafenone dose relatedly raises ventricular rate, although again this effect subsequently reverses at 4 mg/kg. After atropine, propranolol, and pindolol, propafenone (2 mg/kg) instead of initially raising ventricular rate lowers it lastingly. It initially lowers mean blood pressure according to dose. At 2 mg/kg neither this effect nor the plasma levels are modified by the antagonists. The beta-blocking potency is 1/40th that of propranolol as determined against isoproterenol-induced cardioacceleration. These results show that the atrial cardioacceleration due to propafenone results from direct and reflex vagolytic action and that the bradycardia at low plasma levels (buffered by the vagolytic effect at high levels) seems due to its membrane-stabilizing action. They also show that the initial ventricular cardioacceleration is a reflex response to its hypotensive effect, whereas the ventricular bradycardia at high doses is attributable to its membrane-stabilizing action and its albeit weak beta-blocking action.", 
    "56": "Pharmacological and radio-ligand binding studies have recently indicated the existence of beta 2-adrenoceptors in the human heart. Their physiological role, however, remains to be elucidated. The present study investigated in 17 normal, young volunteers the effect on resting left ventricular (LV) function of two types of beta-blockers; a predominant beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist (atenolol, 50 mg once daily) and ICI 118,551 (20 mg t.i.d.), a new, predominant beta 2-antagonist. LV function was assessed using M-mode echocardiograms and systolic time intervals. Atenolol, ICI 118,551, and placebo were given according to a randomized, double-blind, cross-over protocol. As compared with placebo, both drugs caused a decrease in resting heart rate, but the reduction by ICI 118,551 was less pronounced. Systolic blood pressure was only reduced by atenolol 8 mm Hg on average. Cardiac output was decreased to the same extent following treatment with atenolol (-20%) as after ICI 118,551 (-17%). These decreases in cardiac output were related to the beta-blocker-induced bradycardia, since stroke volumes were not affected during either selective beta 1- or beta 2-blockade. In addition, all other echocardiographic variables reflecting LV pump function, such as fractional shortening, velocity of diameter change and of displacements, pre-ejection period, and the ratio of PEP/LVET, were not different from placebo. We conclude that in normal young subjects, global LV pump function is not affected by beta 1- or by beta 2-blockade, despite the negative chronotropic effect of both drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "57": "To assess acute hemodynamic effects of the new beta-adrenergic blocking drug bisoprolol with experimentally documented beta 1 selectivity, we studied 16 patients with stable angina and angiographically proven coronary artery disease. Simultaneous right heart catheterization and radionuclide angiocardiography were performed at rest and during exercise without treatment (control) and 2 h after 5 mg bisoprolol (6 patients) and 20 mg bisoprolol (10 patients), respectively, administered perorally. The hemodynamic profile of bisoprolol was similar to that previously described after acute beta-blockade. A negative chronotropic effect occurred after 5 mg bisoprolol at rest, but the negative inotropic changes did not reach significance, whereas cardiac index decreased and total vascular resistance increased after 20 mg bisoprolol. During exercise, negative inotropic and blood-pressure-lowering effects were present after both dosages, resulting in improved myocardial oxygen consumption as reflected by a significantly reduced rate pressure product. Because ejection fraction and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure were not significantly changed even after the 20 mg dose, bisoprolol has only mild negative inotropic effects and seems hemodynamically safe.", 
    "58": "The pharmacokinetic profile and the cardiovascular actions of desethyl-N-acetylprocainamide (NAPADE) were studied in chloralose-urethane anesthetized dogs. NAPADE was given as a 15-min i.v. infusion in doses of 12 and 60 mg/kg. In all cases, the plasma concentration vs. time curve could be resolved into two exponential components, and the distribution and elimination of NAPADE were analyzed with a two-compartmental model. Total apparent volume of distribution was 0.4153 +/- 0.0301 liters/kg (mean +/- S.E.M.) for the 12-mg/kg group and 0.4946 +/- 0.0691 liters/kg for the 60-mg/kg group (P greater than .05). Elimination clearance was 0.0061 +/- 0.0006 liters/min/kg for the 12-mg/kg group and 0.0086 +/- 0.0013 liters/min/kg for the 60-mg/kg group (P greater than .05). The elimination phase half-life (T1/2 beta) was 57.0 +/- 4.1 and 53.1 +/- 3.2 min for the 12- and 60-mg/kg groups, respectively (P greater than .05). Thus, NAPADE exhibited first-order kinetics of distribution and elimination in the dose range studied. Renal clearance of unchanged NAPADE amounted to 45.9 +/- 4% of total plasma clearance. NAPADE had a dose- and concentration-related positive inotropic effect, as measured with a Walton-Brodie gauge sutured to the right ventricle. A 12-mg/kg infusion caused a peak increased in myocardial force of 18.4 +/- 3.6% over base line, whereas a 60-mg/kg infusion caused a peak increase in myocardial force of 48.9 +/- 10% over base line. The positive inotropic effect of NAPADE was sustained for 50 to 90 min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "59": "The effect of encainide administration on steady-state plasma digoxin levels was evaluated in 17 patients receiving stable doses of digoxin. A paired t test, comparing plasma digoxin levels (mean +/- standard error) before encainide therapy (1.05 +/- 0.14 ng/ml) and after 2 weeks of encainide, 100 mg/day (1.03 +/- 0.11 ng/ml) or 200 mg/day (1.2 +/- 0.2 ng/ml), indicates no significant (p greater than 0.05) change in digoxin levels. These results were confirmed in a second study of 10 patients with severe congestive heart failure. Also, no difference in efficacy of either drug was observed and changes in dosing of digoxin were not required. Plasma concentrations of encainide and its 2 major metabolites, O-demethyl encainide (ODE) and 3-methoxy-O-demethyl encainide, significantly increased by 31.6%, 43.1% and 35.6% after concomitant cimetidine administration in 13 healthy adult men receiving 75 mg/day of encainide. However, a retrospective evaluation of 33 patients receiving both drugs did not reveal any clinically significant interactions. Retrospective evaluation of patients enrolled in clinical studies who received concomitant digoxin (268), antiarrhythmics (118), anticoagulants (78), antidiabetics (40), antipsychotics (23), beta blockers (88), calcium-channel blockers (24) or diuretics (229) did not reveal any clinically significant interactions with encainide. Similarly, in vitro protein binding studies did not reveal any clinically significant interactions with encainide or its major metabolites. Six patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10 to 38 ml/min) received 25 mg of encainide, 3 times/day, for 7 doses. Plasma encainide, ODE and 3-methoxy-O-demethyl concentrations were similar to those observed in normal subjects who had received twice the dose of encainide, and steady-state apparent oral clearance of encainide was reduced by 66% with renal impairment. Based on these data it is recommended that in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment encainide be initiated at one-third the normal dose, or 25 mg once a day. Doses may be elevated in small increments at 1-week intervals if needed for efficacy. The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of encainide was studied in 7 patients with clinically documented cirrhosis. Compared with normal subjects studied using a similar protocol, the plasma concentrations of encainide were elevated significantly due to a 6-fold decrease in oral clearance. However, since plasma concentrations of the active metabolite ODE were correspondingly lower, specific encainide dosing instructions for patients with hepatic impairment are not indicated.", 
    "60": "The effects of multiple doses of doxorubicin (DXR) on myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor density and dissociation constant were investigated in male Sprague Dawley rats. The rats received DXR (2 mg/kg) or vehicle weekly by the SC route for 13 weeks. One group of DXR-treated rats plus corresponding controls were sacrificed at 14 weeks, one week after the last dose. Another group of DXR-treated rats plus corresponding controls were sacrificed at 19 weeks, six weeks after the last dose. The myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor was characterized by radio-ligand binding studies using [125I]iodocyanopindolol. Beta--receptor densities in DXR-treated rats of 7.0 and 7.4 fm/mg protein were unchanged from control levels of 7.2 fm/mg protein at both 14 and 19 weeks, respectively. Receptor dissociation constants in DXR-treated rats of 36.7 and 36.9 pM were increased over control levels of 24.6 and 30.0 pM at 14 and 19 weeks, respectively. However, the change in dissociation constant is only significant at 14 weeks. The increased dissociation constants suggest diminished agonist binding affinity of the myocardial beta-receptor. This impaired response of the receptor to catecholamines would tend to diminish the ability of myocardium to adequately respond to adrenergic stimuli.", 
    "61": "In the Medical Research Council trial for the treatment of mild hypertension, bendrofluazide showed an unexpected and sizeable benefit compared with propranolol in the reduction of stroke. It is suggested that this difference reflects the opposing actions of these drugs on the renin-angiotensin system. The hypothesis that angiotensin-II protects the distal smaller cerebral vessels, which are the usual site of vessel rupture in intracerebral haemorrhage, indicates that long-term benefit of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors in the treatment of hypertension cannot be assumed.", 
    "62": "Overall initial uptake rates of propranolol by isolated rat hepatocytes were analyzed to give both apparently linear and saturable processes. The rate constant for the linear transport process in 7- and 24-week old rats was approximately 0.01 ml X sec-1 X (10(6) cells)-1. For the capacity-limited uptake process of propranolol, the kinetic parameters in 7-week-old rats, were estimated as Vmax = 0.609 microgram X (10(6) cells)-1 X sec-1 and Km = 8.17 micrograms/ml, whereas in 24-week-old rats, Vmax = 0.348 microgram X (10(6) cells)-1 X sec-1 and Km = 9.40 micrograms/ml. The overall uptake rate, when the hepatocytes were incubated with 20 micrograms/ml of propranolol, was reduced with age of the rats between 5 or 7 and 24 weeks and declined gradually thereafter, A higher cell to medium concentration ratio for the initially, net transported component of propranolol in relatively young (5- to 11-week-old) rats suggested an age-dependent saturable uptake process. This was supported by the direct comparison of the saturable uptake rates between 7 and 24 weeks. Therefore, the saturable sinusoidal transport (i.e. saturable uptake by the hepatocytes) may be considered one of the most important mechanisms determining the age-dependence in the intrinsic hepatic clearance of this drug noted in our previous report.", 
    "63": "The oxidative metabolism of metoprolol has been shown to display genetic polymorphism of the debrisoquine-type. The use of in vitro inhibition studies has been proposed as a means of defining whether one or more forms of cytochrome P-450 are involved in the monogenically-controlled metabolism of two substrates. We have, therefore, tested the ability of debrisoquine and other substrates to inhibit the oxidation of metoprolol by rat liver microsomes. Debrisoquine and guanoxan were potent competitive inhibitors of the alpha-hydroxylation and O-desmethylation of metoprolol as well as its metabolism by all routes (measured by substrate disappearance). Cimetidine and ranitidine, drugs which are known to impair the clearance of metoprolol in man, showed an inhibitory action comparable to that of debrisoquine in rat liver microsomes. Antipyrine, a compound whose metabolism is not impaired in poor metabolisers of debrisoquine, was found to be only a weak inhibitor of the metabolism of metoprolol. These findings suggest that the oxidation of metoprolol is linked closely to that of debrisoquine, cimetidine and ranitidine but not to that of antipyrine in the rat.", 
    "64": "Isolated and purified leucocytosis promoting factor (LPF), alternatively described as pertussis toxin, reduced the hypotension after beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation with salbutamol as well as the negative chronotropic activity induced by the muscarinic receptor stimulant arecoline 4 days after its injection into rats. These inhibitory effects of LPF were accompanied by a reduction in basal blood pressure. No effect on autonomic responsiveness or blood pressure was observed 5 h after injection of LPF. Sublethal doses of purified B. pertussis endotoxin (LPS) elicited neither vascular beta 2-adrenergic nor cardiac cholinergic blockade 4 days following injection. Only a distinct vascular beta 2-adrenolytic effect was measured 5 h after pretreatment with the same doses of LPS. This beta 2-adrenoceptor hyporesponsiveness was accompanied by neither an anticholinergic nor a hypotensive effect, but rather by a slight but significant elevation of the blood pressure. In conclusion, both components of B. pertussis (LPS and LPF) give rise to vascular beta 2-adrenergic hyporesponsiveness irrespective of blood pressure effects. There is an important difference between both components with respect to their various kinetic profiles for this phenomenon: an early occurring and short-lasting beta 2-adrenergic blockade for LPS and a late occurring LPF-mediated beta 2-adrenergic blockade.", 
    "65": "Monitoring of the electrocardiogram during normal daily activity yields data regarding silent myocardial ischemia and its relation to heart rate in addition to the detection of cardiac arrhythmias. In recent years various techniques have been developed to quantify the frequency and duration of ischemic episodes in patients with ischemic heart disease. Of particular importance are the newer frequency-modulated recording techniques, which ensure adequate low frequency response, and the computerized digital analysis used to define the role of ST-segment monitoring in the clinical and research setting. The techniques used for acquiring artifact-free signals, the methods of data analysis and the clinical role of ambulatory Holter monitoring of ST-segment changes in the diagnosis of Prinzmetal's angina, in chronic stable angina and in the detection of calcium antagonist withdrawal syndrome in angina are discussed. The data indicate the particular utility of Holter monitoring to analyze the variability of heart rate in defining the effects of calcium-channel blockers, beta-adrenergic blocking agents and their combined use in pharmacologic therapy of ischemic myocardial syndromes.", 
    "66": "We have demonstrated that the rat pituitary tumor cell line GH3 has a carrier-mediated active transport system for the beta-adrenergic antagonist dihydroalprenolol (DHA). Transport of DHA in GH3 was saturable, with an apparent Km of 1.4 microM, was temperature and pH dependent, and was inhibited by the ionophore monensin and the amine transport inhibitor reserpine. Propranolol competed for DHA transport, but not in a stereoselective fashion. The tricyclic antidepressant imipramine also competed for DHA transport, but catecholamines or serotonin did not. This amine transport system in GH3 cells appeared to be identical to the one we recently described in several other cell types; however, analysis in those cells was complicated by the fact that they contain beta-adrenergic receptors which bind beta-adrenergic ligands. In this report we show that GH3 cells do not possess detectable beta-adrenergic receptors, based on their inability to bind the partial agonist CGP-12177, their inability to bind nanomolar concentrations of DHA in a saturable, stereospecific manner, and their failure to produce cAMP in response to stimulation by beta-adrenergic agonists. Characterization of the amine transport system in GH3 cells clearly distinguishes it from receptor-mediated phenomena and should facilitate our efforts to fully understand its mechanism and significance.", 
    "67": "Binding of the beta-adrenergic ligands [3H]dihydroalprenolol and [125I]cyanopindolol to pineal particulate fractions was increased 1- to 3.5-fold by addition of low concentrations of melatonin, alpha-adrenergic agonists, or alpha-adrenergic antagonists. Minimum concentrations of melatonin or alpha-adrenergic compounds which increased beta-adrenergic binding were between 1 pM and 0.1 nM. The increased binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol caused by melatonin (0.1 muM) was attributed to a major increase in Bmax, which persisted in protein fractions after removal of melatonin. Melatonin enhancement of [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding was apparent after 5 to 7 min (30(0], was was optimal between 20 and 40 min, and decreased at longer times. Alpha-Adrenergic receptors are unchanged during beta-receptor enhancement.", 
    "68": "This experiment examined whether various catecholaminergic synthesis inhibitors and receptor blockers affect the inhibitory effect on the frequency of pulsatile luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion induced by local application of estradiol benzoate (EB) into the preoptic suprachiasmatic area (POSC) of ovariectomized rats. Ovariectomized rats were pretreated with either alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (AMPT; tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor), AMPT plus threo-dihydroxyphenylserine (DOPS; norepinephrine precursor), diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC; dopamine-beta-hydroxylase inhibitor), pimozide (dopaminergic receptor blocker), phenoxybenzamine (alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker), propranolol (beta-adrenergic receptor blocker), or their vehicles. EB implantation into the POSC reduced the frequency of existing pulsatile LH secretion in vehicle-treated rats. Pretreatment of the rat with AMPT, AMPT plus DOPS, or pimozide did not affect the basal pulsatile LH secretion but eliminated the suppressive effect of EB implantation on the LH pulse frequency. In rats pretreated with DDC or phenoxybenzamine, basal pulsatile LH secretion was significantly inhibited, and EB implantation did not lower serum LH further in these rats. Propranolol had no obvious effect on either basal pulsatile LH secretion or EB-induced suppression of LH pulse frequency. These findings suggest that, in addition to the alpha-adrenergic involvement in maintaining the basal pulsatile LH secretion, the intact dopaminergic system is required for the suppression of the frequency of LH pulses induced by estrogen.", 
    "69": "Minoxidil is very effective in the treatment of severe or resistant hypertension but fluid retention and hypertrichosis have been side-effects. This study examines the suggestion that the use of small doses of minoxidil may be effective in the treatment of moderate hypertension without causing these adverse effects. Sixteen patients with an elevated blood pressure level that was suboptimally controlled by combination therapy with diuretic and beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agents entered a randomized open trial to compare the efficacy and acceptability of minoxidil and prazosin as supplementary therapy to bendrofluazide and metoprolol. Blood pressure control was similar in the two groups. However, relatively large doses of minoxidil were required and over-all tolerance to the drug was poor; five of eight patients who were receiving minoxidil experienced marked fluid retention that necessitated a change in diuretic agent to substantial doses of frusemide. Low doses of minoxidil do not appear to be effective in the treatment of moderate hypertension, and the drug cannot be recommended for this indication.", 
    "70": "Calmodulin antagonists, trifluoperazine, chlorpromazine, calmidazolium, N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide (W-7), strongly inhibited the electrofusion of barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv Moor) protoplasts with a marked increase of broken fusion products, after 60 minutes of incubation. W-5, a dechlorinated analog of W-7, was found less effective for the inhibition than W-7. Ethyleneglycol-bis(beta- aminoethylether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid a Ca(2+) chelator, La(3+), a surface Ca(2+) antagonist, and verapamil, a Ca(2+) channel blocker, also inhibited electrofusion. Dielectrophoresis was inhibited by La(3+). A microtubule inhibitor, vinblastine, inhibited electrofusion strongly while colchicine, slightly. A microfilament inhibitor, cytochalasin B, promoted fused cells to become spherical while phalloidin did not affect electrofusion.", 
    "71": "To evaluate the influence of beta-blockers and/or minor tranquillizers on autonomic reactions during brief stress, 48 healthy subjects were randomised into 4 groups: A = 4 mg Pindolol, B = 1.5 mg Cloxazolam, C = Placebo, D = 4 mg Pindolol + 1.5 mg Cloxazolam. Subjects underwent four stress situations: Counting, noise, mental arithmetic and ergometry, each lasting 4 min with rest periods of 8 min in between. Electromyogram, finger pulse amplitude, heart rate, pulse wave velocity and electrodermal activity were recorded simultaneously on-line. Analysis of variance showed that the two drugs had significant main effects in different systems: Pindolol reduced heart rate, mainly during mental arithmetic and ergometry, Cloxazolam reduced electrodermal activity, mainly during noise. It can be concluded that different structured situations with a varying amount and type of anxiety induce different autonomic reactions; these reactions can be differentially modified by the drugs applied.", 
    "72": "Exercise investigations were performed in 39 male hypertensives (WHO stage I-III) to assess haemodynamics and cardiac function after intravenous application of 5 mg propranolol for the detection of latent heart failure. Radiocardiography was used to determine volumetric parameters such as LV end-diastolic volume and ejection fraction, and microcatheterization was employed to obtain the LV filling pressure via pressure measurement in the pulmonary artery (PA). The negative inotropic and chronotropic effects of propranolol on pump function and myocardial mechanics at rest were found to be minimal. During 50 watt exercise however, an increase of the diastolic PA pressure has been observed simultaneously with a diminution of cardiac output (stroke volume being constant). Thus, under acutely administered beta blockade, a general disturbance in the flow-pressure relation could be induced, being comparable to heart failure. Only in a few cases was the reduced contractility compensated by the Frank-Starling mechanism, but only if the mechanism did not participate in the regulation of pump function during the previous control investigation. In other cases a remarkable reduction of cardiac output and even stroke volume occurred, results which may be explained as a consequence of a reduced venous return (or pooling) connected with acutely induced vascular effects (beta-2 blockade).", 
    "73": "BN 52021 antagonized PAF-acether-induced bronchoconstriction (BC) in the guinea-pig and inhibited BC triggered by antigen in passively sensitized animals. The anti-anaphylactic activity was prevented by propranolol and may either result from an additional property of the drug, independent from PAF antagonism or from different PAF-dependent mechanisms with different responsiveness to the various antagonists."
