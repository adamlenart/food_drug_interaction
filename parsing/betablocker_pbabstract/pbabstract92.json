Propranolol is a non-selective \u03b2 adrenergic receptor blocker which antagonises the anti-inflammatory effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs via the \u03b21 and \u03b22 adrenergic receptors. The roles of epinephrine and cortisol were investigated in the analgesic activity of metyrosine in rats with reduced epinephrine levels induced by metyrosine. Pain threshold measurement was performed using an analgesimeter with different doses and the single or combined usage of metyrosine, prednisolone, metyrapone and propranolol in rats. Epinephrine and corticosterone levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography in metyrosineadministered rats. Metyrosine reduces the epinephrine levels without affecting the corticosterone levels, thereby creating an analgesic effect. It was determined that prednisolone did not have an analgesic effect in rats with normal epinephrine levels, but its analgesic activity increased with a parallel decrease in the epinephrine levels. Similarly, the combined use of prednisolone and metyrosine provided a stronger analgesic effect than that rendered by metyrosine alone. The strongest analgesic effect, however, was observed in the group of rats with the lowest epinephrine level in whom the metyrosine + prednisolone combination was administered. The findings of this study may be useful in severe pain cases in which the available analgesics are unable to relieve the individual's pain.", 
    "1": "For the purpose of efficient and safe transdermal administration of propranolol hydrochloride (PHCl), effects of (+)-borneol, (+)-camphor, and \u03b1-bisabolol (5 w/v%) in 66.6% ethanol solution on transdermal permeation across rat skin in vitro and their enhancement mechanism was investigated with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and PHCl-stratum corneum binding studies. Each of (+)-borneol, (+)-camphor, and \u03b1-bisabolol significantly increased the transdermal flux of PHCl through rat skin in comparison to the control. The enhancement mechanism of the terpenes is involved with disruption of the lipid bilayer and increase of PHCl partitioning coefficient to the stratum corneum. As for \u03b1-bisabolol, the protect effect of skin from dehydration and an important reason of irritation incident were observed with differential scanning calorimetry for the first time.",

In women with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), the use of tocolysis is still controversial. In theory, tocolysis may prolong pregnancy in women with PPROM, thereby allowing for the corticosteroid benefit and reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with prematurity.",

Compared to no tocolysis, tocolysis was not associated with a significant effect on perinatal mortality in women with PPROM (risk ratio (RR) 1.67; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 3.29). Tocolysis was associated with longer latency (mean difference (MD) 73.12 hours; 95% CI 20.21 to 126.03; three trials of 198 women) and fewer births within 48 hours (average RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.95; six trials of 354 women; random-effects, T(2) = 0.18, I(2) = 43%) compared to no tocolysis. However, tocolysis was associated with increased five-minute Apgar of less than seven (RR 6.05; 95% CI 1.65 to 22.23; two trials of 160 women) and increased need for ventilation of the neonate (RR 2.46; 95% CI 1.14 to 5.34; one trial of 81 women). In the subgroup analysis comparing betamimetic to no betamimetics, tocolysis was associated with increased latency and borderline significance for chorioamnionitis. Prophylactic tocolysis with PPROM was associated with increased overall latency, without additional benefits for maternal/neonatal outcomes. For patients with PPROM before 34 weeks, there was a significantly increased risk of chorioamnionitis in women who received tocolysis. However, neonatal outcomes were not significantly different. There were no significant differences in maternal/neonatal outcomes in subgroup analyses comparing cox inhibitor versus no tocolysis, calcium channel blocker versus betamimetic, antibiotic, corticosteroid or combined antibiotic/corticosteroid.",

    "9": "The induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of excitatory postsynaptic currents was investigated in proximal synapses of layer 2/3 pyramidal cells of the rat medial prefrontal cortex. The spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) induction protocol of negative timing, with postsynaptic leading presynaptic stimulation of action potentials (APs), induced LTD as expected from the classical STDP rule. However, the positive STDP protocol of presynaptic leading postsynaptic stimulation of APs predominantly induced a presynaptically expressed LTD rather than the expected postsynaptically expressed LTP. Thus the induction of plasticity in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells does not obey the classical STDP rule for positive timing. This unusual STDP switched to a classical timing rule if the slow Ca(2+)-dependent, K(+)-mediated afterhyperpolarization (sAHP) was inhibited by the selective blocker N-trityl-3-pyridinemethanamine (UCL2077), by the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol, or by the cholinergic agonist carbachol. Thus we demonstrate that neuromodulators can affect synaptic plasticity by inhibition of the sAHP. These findings shed light on a fundamental question in the field of memory research regarding how environmental and behavioral stimuli influence LTP, thereby contributing to the modulation of memory.", 
    "10": "Prorenin is thought to be an inactive precursor of renin. This study investigated whether human prorenin was capable of activating the (pro)renin receptors [(P)RRs], leading to the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) in cultured human renal mesangial cells (HRMCs). HRMCs cultured in vitro were pretreated with an AT1 and AT2 blocker prior to stimulation by prorenin, PD98059 (an inhibitor of ERK1/2) and handle-region peptide (HRP). Phosphorylated ERK1/2 was evaluated using Western blot analysis, and the concentration of TGF-\u03b2 was measured by ELISA. The mRNA of TGF-\u03b2 was evaluated by RT-PCR. It was found that prorenin activated the (P)RR in cultured HRMCs, which in turn increased p-ERK1/2. Prorenin induced rapid phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and increased p-ERK1/2 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The protein levels of TGF-\u03b2 increased significantly with the stimulation of prorenin. PD98059 significantly decreased p-ERK1/2 and then downregulated TGF-\u03b2. HRP did not inhibit either ERK1/2 phosphorylation or the increase in TGF-\u03b2. ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by prorenin led to a marked increase in TGF-\u03b2. The regulation of TGF-\u03b2 was highly dependent on ERK1/2. Thus, ERK1/2 may play a key role in the development of kidney disease. HRP neither affects the ERK1/2 signaling nor the level of TGF-\u03b2 in HRMCs.",

The animals were also pretreated with saline icv (SAL) or SR59230A (50 nmol) followed by BRL37344 (20 nmol) or SAL in order to determine the selectivity of the effects evoked by BRL37344 on food intake or the selectivity of the effects evoked by SR59230A on risk assessment (RA) behavior. The highest dose of BRL37344 (N = 7) decreased food intake 1 h after the treatment (6.4 \u00b1 0.5 g in SAL-treated vs 4.2 \u00b1 0.8 g in drug-treated rats). While both doses of SR59230A failed to affect food intake (5.1 \u00b1 1.1 g for 10 nmol and 6.0 \u00b1 1.8 g for 50 nmol), this treatment reduced the RA frequency (number/30 min) (4 \u00b1 2 for SAL-treated vs 1 \u00b1 1 for 10 nmol and 0.5 \u00b1 1 for 50 nmol SR59230A-treated rats), an ethological parameter related to anxiety. While pretreatment with SR59230A (7.0 \u00b1 0.5 g) abolished the hypophagia induced by BRL37344 (3.6 \u00b1 0.9 g), BRL37344 suppressed the reduction in RA frequency caused by SR59230A. These results show that the hypophagia caused by BRL37344 is selectively mediated by \u03b23-adrenergic receptors within the central nervous system. Moreover, they suggest the involvement of these receptors in the control of anxiety.",

Peripartum anaesthetic management of a patient with tuberculous meningitis is a rare event.", 
    "13": "Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) is the major cause of persistent neonatal hypoglycemia. CHI most often occurs due to mutations in the ABCC8 (which encodes sulfonylurea receptor 1) or KCNJ11 (which encodes the potassium channel Kir6.2) gene, which result in a lack of functional KATP channels in pancreatic \u03b2 cells. Diffuse forms of CHI (DiCHI), in which all \u03b2 cells are abnormal, often require subtotal pancreatectomy, whereas focal forms (FoCHI), which are characterized by localized hyperplasia of abnormal \u03b2 cells, can be cured by resection of the lesion. Here, we characterized the in vitro kinetics of insulin secretion by pancreatic fragments from 6 DiCHI patients and by focal lesion and normal adjacent pancreas from 18 FoCHI patients. Responses of normal pancreas were similar to those reported for islets from adult organ donors. Compared with normal pancreas, basal insulin secretion was elevated in both FoCHI and DiCHI tissue. Affected tissues were heterogeneous in their secretory responses, with increased glucose levels often producing a rapid increase in insulin secretion that could be followed by a paradoxical decrease below prestimulatory levels. The KATP channel blocker tolbutamide was consistently ineffective in stimulating insulin secretion; conversely, the KATP channel activator diazoxide often caused an unanticipated increase in insulin secretion. These observed alterations in secretory behavior were similar in focal lesion and DiCHI tissue, and independent of the specific mutation in ABCC8 or KCNJ11. They cannot be explained by classic models of \u03b2 cell function. Our results provide insight into the excessive and sometimes paradoxical changes in insulin secretion observed in CHI patients with inactivating mutations of KATP channels.", 
    "14": "The aim of this study is to assess the blood pressure (BP) and metabolic effects of lercanidipine when combined with other classes of first-line antihypertensive drugs in day-to-day clinical practice. For this study, we consecutively enrolled 162 patients with uncomplicated primary hypertension, who are partial responders to the treatment with lercanidipine over a period of 24 months. Patients were then allocated to the combination of lercanidipine (10-20 mg/day) with \u03b2-blockers, diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin-II receptor blockers according to compelling indications (if any) and/or suggestions of European Society of Hypertension-European Society of Cardiology (ESH-ESC) guidelines. All the enrolled patients completed the study and no adverse drug reaction was registered during the research period. The association of a second drug with lercanidipine determined an additional BP decrease of either systolic BP or diastolic BP independently from the type of drug added (P always <.05). The additional effect of lercanidipine appears widely distributed with no significant differences in the size of BP decrease. From the metabolic point of view, the addition of a second drug did not determine a significant variation in the serum levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P always >.05). Conversely, a significant decrease in fasting plasma glucose and serum levels of triglycerides has been observed in patients where lercanidipine has been combined with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin-II receptor blocker. In conclusion, in our study we observed that lercanidipine-based protocols are well tolerated and efficacious in reducing BP. Moreover, the association of lercanidipine with renin-angiotensin system blockers is also associated with significant improvements in triglycerides and fasting plasma glucose.", 
    "15": "After menopause, the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is due not only to estrogen decline but also to androgen decline. This study examined the effects of either estradiol (E(2)) or testosterone replacement alone or E(2)-testosterone combination on isolated myocytes in ovariectomized (Ovx) rats subjected to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Furthermore, we determined whether the effects are associated with \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptor (\u03b2(2)-AR). Five groups of adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were used: Sham operation (Sham) rats, bilateral Ovx rats, Ovx rats with E(2) 40\u200a\u03bcg/kg per day (Ovx+E), Ovx rats with testosterone 150\u200a\u03bcg/kg per day (Ovx+T), and Ovx rats with E(2) 40\u200a\u03bcg/kg per day+testosterone 150\u200a\u03bcg/kg per day (Ovx+E/T). We determined the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, percentage of rod-shaped cells and apoptosis of ventricular myocytes from rats of all groups subjected to I/R. Then, we determined the above indices and contractile function with or without a selective \u03b2(2)-AR antagonist ICI 118\u200a551. We also determined the expression of \u03b2(2)-AR. Our data show that either E(2) or testosterone replacement alone or E(2) and testosterone in combination decreased the LDH release, increased the percentage of rod-shaped cells, reduced apoptotic cells (%), and combination treatment appeared to be more effective than either E(2) or testosterone replacement alone. ICI 118\u200a551 abolished the effects of the three. Combination supplementation also enhanced the expression of \u03b2(2)-AR. We concluded that in Ovx rats, testosterone enhances E(2)'s cardioprotection, while E(2) and testosterone in combination was more effective and the protective effects may be associated with \u03b2(2)-AR. The study highlights the potential therapeutic application for CVD in postmenopausal women.", 
    "16": "Myocardial \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2ARs) are important in altering heart rate, inotropic state, and myocardial relaxation (lusitropy). The \u03b21AR and \u03b22AR stimulation increases cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentration with the net result of myocyte contraction, whereas \u03b23AR stimulation results in decreased inotropy. Downregulation of \u03b21ARs in heart failure, as well as an increased \u03b23AR activity and density, lead to decreased cyclic adenosine monophosphate production and reduced inotropy. The \u03b2AR antagonists are commonly used in patients with coronary artery disease and heart failure; however, perioperative use of \u03b2AR antagonists is controversial. Individual patient's response to beta-blocker therapy is an area of intensive research, and apart from pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and ethnic differences, genetic alterations have become more important in the last 20 years. The most common genetic variants in humans are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). There are 2 clinically relevant SNPs for the \u03b21AR (Ser49Gly, Arg389Gly), 3 for the \u03b22AR (Arg16Gly, Gln27Glu, Thr164Ile), and 1 for the \u03b23AR (Trp64Arg). Although results are somewhat controversial, generally large datasets have the potential to show a relationship between \u03b2AR SNPs and outcomes such as development and progression of heart failure, coronary artery disease, vascular reactivity, hypertension, asthma, obesity, and diabetes. Although \u03b2AR SNPs may not directly cause disease, they appear to be risk factors for, and modifiers of, disease and the response to stress and drugs. In the perioperative setting, this has specifically been demonstrated for the Arg389Gly \u03b21AR polymorphism with which patients with the Gly variant had a higher incidence of adverse perioperative events. Knowing that genetic variants play an important role, perioperative medicine will likely change from simple therapeutic intervention to a more personalized way of adrenergic receptor modulation.", 
    "17": "Glucocorticosteroids are the mainstay treatment for chronic asthma; however, adverse effects can limit their usefulness. We previously determined in experimental asthma that chronic administration of \u03b2\u2082-adrenoceptor inverse agonists reduced airway hyperresponsiveness and indexes of inflammation. However, the effect of co-administration of glucocorticosteroids with \u03b2\u2082-adrenoceptor inverse agonists is unknown. Therefore, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory effect of co-administration of dexamethasone, a glucocorticosteroid, and nadolol, a \u03b2\u2082-inverse agonist, in a murine asthma model. We measured eosinophils and cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and mucin content in epithelial cells after exposure to different concentrations of dexamethasone and nadolol. Dexamethasone was administered for 3 days and nadolol for 24 days prior to ovalbumin challenge. Both drugs were continued during five daily intranasal challenges with ovalbumin. Independent administration of dexamethasone (0.4 mg/kg/day) or nadolol (25 ppm) reduced bronchoalveolar lavage eosinophils by 58% and 36%, respectively (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Co-administration of both drugs yielded an additive reduction in eosinophils (81%, P\u2009<\u20090.05). Co-administration of both drugs (dexamethasone 0.4 mg/kg/day and nadolol 25 ppm) also yielded a greater reduction in mucin volume density (83%) than either drug alone (18% for dexamethasone and 62% for nadolol) and greater than high-dose dexamethasone (71%) alone (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Similarly, co-administration of both drugs (dexamethasone 0.4 mg/kg/day and nadolol 25 ppm) yielded an additive effect on the reduction of type 2 cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid equivalent to the administration of a 10-fold higher dose of dexamethasone. In Summary, the simultaneous administration of a glucocorticosteroid and a \u03b2\u2082-adrenoceptor inverse agonist was more effective at reducing indexes of airway inflammation than either drug given alone; suggesting nadolol may possess \"glucocorticoid-sparing\" properties.",

Hearts were perfused on a Langendorff apparatus. Results were compared with hearts acutely treated with sotalol (S; 50-100 \u03bcM; n = 14). A 12-lead electrocardiogram and up to 8 ventricular epi- and endocardial monophasic action potentials showed a significant prolongation of QT interval (D: +24 milliseconds, A: +28 milliseconds, S: +35 milliseconds (50 \u03bcM), +56 milliseconds (100 \u03bcM); P < 0.02) compared with baseline. In contrast to D and A, S led to a significant increase in dispersion of repolarization and exhibited reverse use dependence. D, A, and S increased refractory period, resulting in a significant increase in postrepolarization refractoriness (effective refractory period minus action potential duration; D = +12 milliseconds; A = +14 milliseconds; S = +25 milliseconds; P < 0.05). S led to a triangular action potential configuration, whereas D and A caused a fast phase 3 prolongation.

    "29": "Stress responses are known to modulate leukocyte trafficking. In the skin, stress was reported both to enhance and reduce skin immunity, and the chronicity of stress exposure was suggested as a key determining factor. We here propose a dual-stage hypothesis, suggesting that stress, of any duration, reduces skin immunity during its course, while its cessation is potentially followed by a period of enhanced skin immunity. To start testing this hypothesis, rats were subcutaneously implanted with sterile surgical sponges for four-hours, during or after exposure to one of several acute stress paradigms, or to a chronic stress paradigm. Our findings, in both males and females, indicate that numbers of sponge-infiltrating leukocytes, and their specific subsets, were reduced during acute or chronic stress, and increased after stress cessation. Studying potential mediating mechanisms of the reduction in leukocyte numbers during acute stress, we found that neither adrenalectomy nor the administration of beta-adrenergic or glucocorticoid antagonists prevented this reduction. Additionally, administration of corticosterone or epinephrine to adrenalectomized rats did not impact skin leukocyte numbers, whereas, in the blood, these treatments did affect numbers of leukocytes and their specific subsets, as was also reported previously. Overall, our findings support the proposed dual-stage hypothesis, which can be evolutionally rationalized and accounts for most of the apparent inconsistencies in the literature regarding stress and skin immunity. Other aspects of the hypothesis should be tested, also using additional methodologies, and its predictions may bear clinical significance in treatment of skin disorders related to hyper- or hypo-immune function.",

When erythromycin existed in the apical medium, the permeations of fexofenadine and talinolol were significantly enhanced without change in their dissolution. The prediction of oral absorptions of fexofenadine and talinolol from in vitro data indicated that co-administration of erythromycin results in 2.1- and 1.9-fold higher oral absorptions, respectively. Moreover, the D/P system could estimate the effect of cremophor EL on the oral absorption of saquinavir. These estimations corresponded well to in vivo human observations. Our in vitro system is useful in assessment of the effect of P-gp-mediated efflux on in vivo oral absorption of P-gp substrates.", 
    "37": "The oxytocin receptor (OTR) and the \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2(2)AR) are key regulators of uterine contraction. These two receptors are targets of tocolytic agents used to inhibit pre-term labor. Our recent study on the nature of OTR- and \u03b2(2)AR-mediated ERK1/2 activation in human hTERT-C3 myometrial cells suggested the presence of an OTR/\u03b2(2)AR hetero-oligomeric complex (see companion article). The goal of this study was to investigate potential allosteric interactions between OTR and \u03b2(2)AR and establish the nature of the interactions between these receptors in myometrial cells. We found that OTR-mediated ERK1/2 activation was attenuated significantly when cells were pretreated with the \u03b2(2)AR agonist isoproterenol or two antagonists, propranolol or timolol. In contrast, pretreatment of cells with a third \u03b2(2)AR antagonist, atenolol resulted in an increase in OTR-mediated ERK1/2 activation. Similarly, \u03b2(2)AR-mediated ERK1/2 activation was strongly attenuated by pretreatment with the OTR antagonists, atosiban and OTA. Physical interactions between OTR and \u03b2(2)AR were demonstrated using co-immunoprecipitation, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) and protein-fragment complementation (PCA) assays in HEK 293 cells, the latter experiments indicating the interactions between the two receptors were direct. Our analyses suggest physical interactions between OTR and \u03b2(2)AR in the context of a new heterodimer pair lie at the heart of the allosteric effects.", 
    "38": "In this paper, a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the simultaneous analysis of metabolic stability and metabolite profiling of 1-[4-(2-methoxyethyl) phenoxy]-3-[[2-(2-methoxyphenoxy) ethyl]amino]-2-propanol hydrochloride (TJ0711 HCl), a new vasodilatory \u03b2-blocker. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was used as a survey scan to quantify the parent compound and to trigger the acquisition of enhanced product ions (EPI) for the identification of formed metabolites. In addition, comparison between MRM-only and MRM-information dependent acquisition-EPI (MRM-IDA-EPI) methods was conducted to determine analytical variables, including linearity, limit of detection (LOD), lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), as well as intra-day and inter-day accuracy and precision. Results demonstrated that MRM-IDA-EPI quantitative analysis was not affected by the addition of EPI scans to obtain qualitative information during the same chromatographic run, compared to MRM-only method. Thereafter, metabolic stability and metabolite identification of TJ0711 HCl were investigated using human liver microsomes (HLM) by the MRM-IDA-EPI method. The in vitro metabolic stability parameters were calculated and t(1/2), microsomal intrinsic clearance (CL(int)), as well as hepatic CL, were 13.0 min, 106.5 \u03bcL/min/mg microsomal protein, and 1082.2 mL/min, respectively. The major formed metabolites were also simultaneously monitored and the metabolite profiling data demonstrated that this MRM-IDA-EPI method was capable of targeting a large number of metabolites, in which demethylation and hydroxylation were the principle metabolism pathways during the in vitro incubation with HLM.", 
    "39": "New zwitterionic stationary phases were synthesized by covalently bonding 3-P,P-diphenylphosphonium-propylsulfonate to silica gel. The resulting materials possess both a negatively charged sulfonate group and a positively charged quaternary phosphonium group, which means that there is no net charge over a wide pH range. The retention mechanism and chromatographic behavior of polar solutes under HILIC conditions were studied on these zwitterionic phases. Compared to the commercial ZIC-HILIC column and a bare silica gel stationary phase, the newly synthesized zwitterionic stationary phases provided greater retention, higher peak efficiency and better peak symmetry in the HILIC mode. The analytes examined included: \u03b2-blockers, nucleic acid bases and nucleosides, salicylic acid and its analogues, and water soluble vitamins. Factors, such as the type of organic modifiers, solvent composition, pH and the buffer concentration of the mobile phase, have been considered as potential variables for controlling the chromatographic retention of polar analytes.", 
    "40": "Heart failure (HF) and benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) are two conditions that commonly coexist in men 60 years and older. Carvedilol is the only \u03b2-adrenergic blocker approved for HF that also has additional \u03b11-adrenergic blockade. As \u03b11-adrenergic blockers are used in the treatment of BPH, it is intuitive that carvediolol could improve BPH symptoms. We present a case where carvedilol was replaced with bisoprolol resulting in acute urinary retention. When carvediolol was reinstituted, the patient's symptoms of BPH resolved. Benign prostatic hypertrophy was later diagnosed by digital rectal exam. Six month after reinstituting the carvediolol, the patient remains free of his BPH symptoms. This case suggests that carvedilol may be considered for the management of HF with systolic dysfunction in patients with concomitant BPH thus eliminating the need for an \u03b11-adrenergic blockers.", 
    "41": "Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) has become by far the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive drug in the US. In 2008, 47.8 million prescriptions were written for HCTZ alone and 87.1 million prescriptions for HCTZ combinations. However, there is no evidence that HCTZ in its usual dose of 12.5-25 mg daily reduces myocardial infarction, stroke, or death. In a meta-analysis of 19 randomized trials with over 1400 patients, the 24-hour decrease in blood pressure with HCTZ was inferior to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers (P <.001 for all). Even in combination with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, HCTZ was found to reduce morbidity and mortality less well than a calcium channel blocker. As measured by the adherence rate, thiazides are less well tolerated than any other drug class. Because outcome data at the usual daily dose of 12.5-25 mg are lacking, antihypertensive efficacy is paltry, and adherence is poor, HCTZ is an inappropriate first-line drug in hypertension. If a \"thiazide-type\" diuretic is indicated, either chlorthalidone or indapamide should be selected.", 
    "42": "Although similarity of pharmacological responses to certain stimuli between guinea pigs and humans has been reported, this has been poorly defined by a molecular biological approach. In this study, we cloned the gene of guinea pig ?1-adrenoceptor (ADRB1). The deduced amino acid sequence of guinea pig ADRB1 (467-aa) showed 91% and 92% identity with the human and rat ADRB1 sequences, respectively. Using HEK293T cells expressing guinea pig, human and rat ADRB1s independently, we elucidated the functional characteristics of each ADRB1. The ligand-binding profiles and the concentration-response relationships for isoprenaline-induced cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production were similar among the three ADRB1s. Isoprenaline also induced phosphorylation of extracellular-signal related kinases (ERK) through ADRB1s in a concentration-dependent manner. The minimum effective concentration of isoprenaline for phosphorylation of ERK, through guinea pig ADRB1 was the same as through human ADRB1, but markedly lower than that of through rat ADRB1. ERK phosphorylation through guinea pig ADRB1 was sensitive to pertussis toxin, a dominant-negative ras and PD98059, indicating that a G(i)-mediated pathway is involved in the ADRB1/ERK signaling loop. These results suggest that the G(i)-coupling efficacy of guinea pig and human ADRB1s may be higher than that of rat ADRB1.", 
    "43": "In acute experiments in anesthetized rabbits, changes of the pulmonary hemodynamics following myocardial ischemia in the region of the descendent left coronary artery were studied as well as in control animals and after the blockade of beta-adrenoreceptors. The myocardial ischemia decreased the left ventricular myocardial contractility, cardiac output and arterial pressure, decreased the pulmonary artery pressure and flow. Following myocardial ischemia, the pulmonary artery pressure decreased less than pulmonary artery blood flow as the result of elevating of the left atrial pressure, meanwhile pulmonary vascular resistance was not changed. Following myocardial ischemia in animals after the blockade of the beta-adrenoreceptors, the pulmonary flow decreased the same as in control animals. However, the pulmonary artery pressure was decreased twofold more significantly than in control animals, and its diminishing was in the same degree as the pulmonary artery flow. Following myocardial ischemia after the blockade of the beta-adrenoreceptors, the pulmonary vascular resistance decreased whereas the left atrial pressure did not change significantly because the myocardial contractility decreased less than in control animals.",

    "45": "One eye each of 77 POAG patients was included in this prospective, observer-masked, crossover comparison. Following a 2-month timolol run-in period, patients had three intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements at 1000, 1200 and 1400 h while on timolol treatment. Patients showing at least a 20% IOP reduction on timolol were randomised to 3 months of therapy with DTFC or BTFC, and then were crossed over to the opposite therapy.", 
    "46": "Sixty POAG patients completed the study. The mean 24-hour IOP was significantly reduced with both the fixed combinations compared with the timolol-treated diurnal IOP (P < 0.001). When the two fixed combinations were compared directly, DTFC demonstrated a lower mean 24-hour IOP level as compared with BTFC (mean difference: -0.7 mm Hg, 95% confidence interval (CI): (-1.0, -0.3), P < 0.001). At two individual time points, DTFC significantly reduced IOP more than BTFC: at 1800 h (-1.0 mm Hg, 95% CI (-1.6,-0.5), P = 0.001) and at 0200 (-0.9 mm Hg, 95% CI: (-1.4,-0.5), P = 0.001).

    "49": "Ninety patients with stable coronary angina pectoris with renal insufficiency (creatinine value \u22651.2 mg/dl) were included for this prospective study. Patients were divided into two groups. Patients in group 1 (n=55) received oral administration of nebivolol 5 mg/daily for coronary artery disease and/or hypertension. Group 2 consisted of 35 patients who received metoprolol 50 mg/daily for the same indications. All patients were hydrated with 0.9% NaCl at a rate of 1 mL/kg/hr for 12 hours before and 24 hours after the procedure. Patients were also given N-acetylcysteine (NAC) 600 mg twice a day, beginning 24 hours before and continuing 48 hours after the procedure. All patients underwent routine coronary angiography. Serum creatinine was assessed just before, immediately after and 48 hours after the procedure. CIN was defined as an increase in serum creatinine concentration of \u226525% within 48 hours after the procedure compared to the patient's baseline value. Tests for significance between groups were conducted using the independent sample t-test for continuous variables and Chi-square test for categorical variables.", 
    "50": "Baseline serum creatinine levels were statistically comparable in two groups. Following angiography, serum creatinine levels increased in both groups. Post-angiographic creatinine levels were not statistically different in the nebivolol and the metoprolol groups. Contrast induced nephropathy developed in 13 patients (24%) of the nebivolol group and in 12 patients (33%) of the metoprolol group. The incidence of CIN was statistically significantly lower in the nebivolol group comparing with the metoprolol group (p=0.03).", 
    "51": "The use of oral nebivolol for one week at a dose of 5 mg per day may decrease the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy in patients who underwent coronary angiography with renal dysfunction. The small numbers of this study do not allow to draw final conclusion on the use of nebivolol in the prevention of CIN. Therefore, larger studies may be necessary to address the definite role of nebivolol in this setting.",

It is unknown by which mechanism DA reduces oedema formation and inflammation. Therefore we tested the first time in an isolated rat lung model if dopaminergic or adrenergic receptors are involved.", 
    "53": "Rats were treated for 1 hr with NaCl, DA or simultaneously with DA alpha- beta- D1- or D2-receptor blockers. Thereafter lungs were explanted, flushed with Perfadex-solution and stored at 4\u00b0C. Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) and lung weight were measured during reperfusion of 3 hrs. Inflammatory mediators and the expression of adhesion molecules were measured after perfusion.", 
    "54": "Up to 6 hours of hypothermia did not influence oedema formation or PIP and PAP during reperfusion time. However, hypothermia after 8 hrs significantly increased PIP, PAP and pulmonary oedema in NaCl, alpha- and beta-blocker treated lungs, but significantly not in DA, D1- or D2-blocker treated lungs. Perfusion and ventilation alone induced a strong upregulation of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 and adhesion molecules in untreated, alpha- and beta-blocker treated lungs, while in DA, D1- and D2-blocker treated lungs significant lower levels were found.",

The aims of this study were to enumerate the proportion of patients presenting with typical angina or other cardiac symptoms and to elucidate what important clinical variables are associated with the presence of typical angina in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and angiographically documented coronary artery disease. Symptoms of angina, anginal equivalents, or an absence of symptoms were obtained using baseline data from the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes (BARI 2D) trial (n = 2,319). A bivariate analysis stratified by the presence or absence of previous revascularization and logistic regression modeling with a stepwise covariate selection was used. Eighty-two percent of patients had symptoms, while 18% presented asymptomatically. This was further divided approximately into typical angina (1/5), anginal equivalents (1/5), combination (2/5), and asymptomatic (1/5). A history of previous revascularization was a determinant of the type of symptom presentation with regard to the variables gender, age, current insulin use, myocardial jeopardy index score, and use of \u03b2 blockers. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, of the available candidate variables, only a history of \u03b2-blocker use (odds ratio 1.53, 95% confidence interval 1.24 to 1.94, p <0.0001) and previous percutaneous coronary intervention (odds ratio 1.55, 95% confidence interval 1.24 to 1.94, p <0.0001) had higher odds of an association with typical angina. In conclusion, a large proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease indeed have symptoms. Future studies of long-term outcomes associated with these symptoms are needed.", 
    "57": "To fully utilize the extended contact time of gel formulations a novel formulation with drug containing catanionic aggregates offering prolonged drug release and skin penetration were investigated. This study aimed to further explore the drug release process from catanionic vesicles in gels. Catanionic vesicles were formed from alprenolol and sodium dodecyl sulphate. Physical gels composed of catanionic vesicles and a SoftCAT polymer were used as well as covalent Carbopol gels. Drug release was measured in vitro using a modified USP paddle method and the skin penetration was studied using dermatomized pig ear skin mounted in horizontal Ussing chambers. The aggregate structure was visualized with cryo-TEM during the drug release and skin penetration process. The study results show that catanionic vesicles are present in the formulations throughout the drug release process and during the clinically relevant skin application time. Hence, the decreased skin penetration rate stems from the prolonged release of drug substance from the gels. The rheological investigation shows that the gel structure of the physically cross-linked gels is maintained even as the drug substance is released and the gel volume is decreased. These findings indicate that the applicability of formulations like these is a future possibility.",

There were more men (1 787 vs. 713) and patients under 70 years of age (1 491 vs. 1 009) in the cohort. Eighteen percent of patients had more than one MI. Mean age at the first infarction was 59.2 years in men and 64.9 in women (p < 0.001). NYHA breathlessness category higher than II was reported by 13.0% of patients only, 57.2% of patients reported they never had chest pain following an MI. Hypertension was the most frequent co-morbidity (84%). The mean blood pressure was 132/79 mmHg with no difference between men and women, the mean heart rate was 68/min, the mean cholesterol level was 4.55 mmol/l. 66% of patients had been prescribed all recommended pharmacotherapeutic groups according to guidelines (RAAS blockers, beta-blockers, statins, antiaggregation agents) and each group individually was used in > 90% of patients. There were no differences between men and women and older and younger patients. ACE inhibitors and statins were not always prescribed in recommended (high) doses. Ramipril and perindopril were the most frequently prescribed ACE inhibitors and atorvastatin the most frequently prescribed statin. There was a high level of compliance when it came to achieving the target blood pressure and heart rate values as well as to prescribing of the recommended drug groups. However, renin-angiotensin system-blocking agents and statins are not being prescribed in sufficiently high doses and this should be improved.",

    "60": "Higenamine mediates cardiotonic, vascular relaxation and bronchodilator effects. The relaxation effects and the mechanism of action of higenamine on the rat corpus cavernosum (CC) were assessed to investigate the effect of higenamine on penile erection. Strips of CC and aorta were used in organ baths for isometric tension studies. Tension was measured with isometric force transducers, and muscle relaxation was expressed as the percent decrease in precontraction induced by phenylephrine (PE). The relaxation reactions were investigated in an endothelial-denuded group and groups pretreated with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (NO synthesis inhibitor), propranolol (\u03b2-receptor blocker), indomethacin (COX inhibitor), glibenclamide (K(+)(ATP) channel inhibitor), 4-aminopyridine (membrane potential-dependent potassium channel inhibitor) and methylene blue (guanylyl cyclase inhibitor) for 30\u2009min. Intracavernous pressure (ICP) was assessed in rats after the intravenous administration of higenamine, and changes in guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate and adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations were measured on the basis of the higenamine concentration. Also, the combined reaction of higenamine and the phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors was assessed. Higenamine induced relaxation of the CC and the aortic strips precontracted with PE in a dose-dependent manner. The CC was significantly more relaxed than the aortic rings in response to the same higenamine concentration (P<0.05). The CC relaxation reaction was suppressed by the \u03b2-receptor blocker propranolol. The cAMP concentration increased gradually with increased higenamine concentration (P<0.05). The ICP also increased with increased higenamine concentration in vivo (P<0.05). In the group pretreated with 10(-7)\u2009M higenamine, the relaxation reaction of CC induced by the PDE-5 inhibitor increased significantly, compared with CC exposed to the PDE-5 inhibitor but not pretreated with higenamine (P<0.05). In conclusion, higenamine induced relaxation of the rat CC in a dose-dependent manner. The effect may be mediated through \u03b2-adrenoceptors. The results suggest that higenamine may be valuable as a new lead compound for treating erectile dysfunction.",

It is important to reassure patients with clinically significant coronary artery disease, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, that for most lifestyle modification and optimal medical therapy will prove sufficient treatment. However, a minority of patients may also require intervention by stents or surgery. It is vital that patients with obvious precipitating factors that may promote or aggravate underlying coronary artery disease address these with lifestyle changes. Smoking should be stopped and a balanced diet and regular exercise encouraged. Advice should be given on factors that aggravate angina e.g. cold weather, heavy exercise and emotional stress. Advice about physical exertion and sexual activity should be included. A short-acting nitrate for angina prevention and treatment of episodes of angina is recommended. It should be used prophylactically in advance of any exertion. In terms of secondary prevention, basic therapy includes aspirin and a statin and antihypertensive agents for those with higher blood pressure. Optimal drug therapy consists of two anti-anginal drugs, such as a beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker as first-line treatment and in preference to other drug therapy unless there are side-effects or contraindications to these. Prognosis of coronary artery disease is strongly linked to the volume of underlying myocardial ischaemia and this cannot be determined simply by the level of symptoms. This should be explained to patients who should be offered further investigation if they wish and should certainly be encouraged in younger patients. Patients who have positive exercise tests require further investigation, usually by angiography. Unless a significant volume of myocardium (>10%) is at risk from ischaemia, there may be no prognostic benefit from revascularisation. However, even in patients in whom there is no significant burden of ischaemia, revascularisation can be justified if the patient remains highly symptomatic despite optimal medical therapy or is intolerant of maximal medical therapy.", 
    "80": "Several studies in humans or transgenic animals have reported that the 389 Arg or Gly polymorphic variation of the \u03b21-adrenergic receptor (AR) is associated with differential responses to beta-blocker therapy and/or myocardial disease progression. Analysis of changes in gene expression is an important means of defining molecular differences associated with structural or functional phenotypic variations. To determine if structural and functional myocardial phenotypic differences between \u03b21389 Arg vs. Gly transgenic overexpressors are associated with qualitative and/or quantitative differences in gene expression, a comprehensive analysis of mRNAs and miRNAs expressed in the hearts of 3 and 6-8 mo old \u03b21-Arg389 and \u03b21-Gly389 overexpressor transgenic mice was performed. Changes in mRNA and miRNA expression were analyzed by arrays and partially confirmed by RT-qPCR. Bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that several genes, including those involved in PKA and CaMK signaling pathways, are regulated in a temporal- or phenotype-specific manner. Furthermore, expression signature analyses indicated that miRNAs have the potential to target expression of a number of genes involved in multiple cardiomyopathy-related pathways, and changes in miRNA expression can precede the onset of disease. Differences in gene expression between \u03b21-Arg389 and \u03b21-Gly389 transgenic mice are largely quantitative rather than qualitative and are associated with the development of cardiomyopathy in a time-dependent manner. Chronic \u03b21-AR overdrive results in increased expression of components of the CaMK pathway, with correspondingly decreased levels of components of the PKA pathway. Based on the temporal and genotype-specific pattern of miRNA expression, miRNAs are likely to be important predictors of disease states, especially when miRNA expression is paired with mRNA expression, and that miRNA/mRNA expression signatures have the potential to be useful in determining the underlying risk associated with cardiac disease progression.",

    "86": "The \u03b2-blocker propranolol displays antihypertrophic and antifibrotic properties in the heart subjected to pressure overload. Yet the underlying mechanisms responsible for these important effects remain to be completely understood. The purpose of this study was to determine signaling pathway-focused gene expression profile associated with the antihypertrophic action of propranolol in pressure overloaded hearts. To address this question, a focused real-time PCR array was used to screen left ventricular RNA expression of 84 gene transcripts representative of 18 different signaling pathways in C57BL/6 mice subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) or sham surgery. On the surgery day, mice received either propranolol (80 mg/kg/day) or vehicle for 14 days. TAC caused a 49% increase in the left ventricular weight-to-body weight (LVW/BW) ratio without changing gene expression. Propranolol blunted LVW/BW ratio increase by approximately 50% while causing about a 3-fold increase in the expression of two genes, namely Brca1 and Cdkn2a, belonging to the TGF-beta and estrogen pathways, respectively. In conclusion, after 2 weeks of pressure overload, TAC hearts show a gene expression profile superimposable to that of sham hearts. Conversely, propranolol treatment is associated with an increased expression of genes which negatively regulate cell cycle progression. It remains to be established whether a mechanistic link between gene expression changes and the antihypertrophic action of propranolol occurs.", 
    "87": "Beta-adrenergic receptor- (\u03b2-AR) mediated vasorelaxation declines with age. This change is likely related to receptor desensitization, rather than down regulation. One kinase responsible for desensitization is G protein receptor kinase 2 (GRK2). We have shown that GRK expression and activity increases with age in Fischer 344 rat aorta. In this study we validated that carotid arteries have similar age-related changes in the \u03b2-AR signaling axis as aorta. This finding allowed use of in vivo infection and delivery of two adenovirus vectors to carotid arteries of 2-month-old (2M) and 12-month-old (12M) male Fischer 344 rats. Adeno-GRK2 was used to overexpress GRK2, and adeno-\u03b2-ARK-ct was used to inhibit GRK2 function. Following a five-day infection, vessels were collected and ex vivo tissue bath was used to evaluate vasoreactivity. We used KCl contracted segments, and determined that overexpression of GRK2 significantly impaired isoproterenol (ISO)-mediated vasorelaxation in both age groups. Maximum relaxation (MAX) to ISO in vessels from 2M decreased from 44% to 21%. MAX to ISO in vessels from 12M decreased from 12% to 6%. Sensitivity (ED\u2085\u2080) in vessels from 2M and 12M was also impaired 57%, and 30% respectively. We also determined that expression of adeno-\u03b2-ARK-ct significantly improved ISO-mediated vasorelaxation in both age groups. MAX in vessels from 2M increased from 44% to 58%. MAX in vessels from 12M increased from 15% to 69%. ED\u2085\u2080 in vessels from 2M and 12M was also improved 46%, and 50% respectively. These findings further implicate age-related increases in GRK2 expression as an important regulator of the age-related decline in \u03b2-AR-mediated vasorelaxation.", 
    "88": "The conventional antihypertensive therapies including renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonists (converting enzyme inhibitors, receptor blockers, renin inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers), diuretics, \u03b2-blockers, and calcium channel blockers are variably successful in achieving the challenging target blood pressure values in hypertensive patients. Difficult to treat hypertension is still a commonly observed problem world-wide. A number of drugs are considered to be used as novel therapies for hypertension. Renalase supplementation, vasopeptidase inhibitors, endothelin antagonists, and especially aldosterone antagonists (aldosterone synthase inhibitors and novel selective mineralocorticoid receptor blockers) are considered an option in resistant hypertension. In addition, the aldosterone antagonists as well as (pro)renin receptor blockers or AT(2) receptor agonists might attenuate end-organ damage. This array of medications has now been complemented by a number of new approaches of non-pharmacological strategies including vaccination, genomic interference, controlled breathing, baroreflex activation, and probably most successfully renal denervation techniques. However, the progress on innovative therapies seems to be slow and the problem of resistant hypertension and proper blood pressure control appears to be still persisting. Therefore the regimens of currently available drugs are being fine-tuned, resulting in the establishment of several novel fixed-dose combinations including triple combinations with the aim to facilitate proper blood pressure control. It remains an exciting question which approach will confer the best blood pressure control and risk reduction in this tricky disease.", 
    "89": "Conductance-based models of reciprocally inhibiting burst neurons suggest that intrinsic membrane properties and postinhibitory rebound (PIR) determine the amplitude and frequency of saccadic oscillations. Reduction of the low-threshold calcium currents (I(T)) in the model decreased the amplitude but increased the frequency of the simulated oscillations. Combined reduction of hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I(h)) and I(T) in the model abolished the simulated oscillations. We measured the effects of a selective blocker of I(T) (ethosuximide) in healthy subjects on the amplitude and frequency of saccadic oscillations evoked by eye closure and of a nonselective blocker of I(h) and I(T) (propronolol) in a patient with microsaccadic oscillation and limb tremor syndrome (mSOLT). Ethosuximide significantly reduced the amplitude but increased the frequency of the saccadic oscillations during eye closure in healthy subjects. Propranolol abolished saccadic oscillations in the mSOLT patient. These results support the hypothetical role of postinhibitory rebound, I(h), and I(T) , in generation of saccadic oscillations and determining their kinematic properties.",

Hot Spot Analysis was used to determine the existence of any spatial clustering patterns in adherence rates. The analysis was performed at the census tract level by using the percentage of nonadherent patients within a census tract to represent adherence for the people living within that tract, standardized by the number of residents in a census tract aged 40 years or older. Hot Spot Analysis identified unique geographic areas of high, neutral, and low adherence in the southeast area. Highly adherent census tracts were primarily located in and around the city where the university hospital and clinics are located. Areas of low adherence were located to the west, southwest, and southeast of the city. All other census tracts were considered neutral in adherence rates.",

The aim of this work was to determine whether PKC activation is involved in the physiological regulation of LL volume in a whole lung preparation. Rat lungs were perfused with a modified Ringer solution, and the lumen was filled with the same solution without glucose. LL volume was measured during a control period and after modulating drugs were administered, and net LL transepithelial movement (J(v)) was calculated. When the PKC activator PMA (10(-5) M) and the Ca(2+) ionophore ionomycin (10(-6) M) were instilled into the lung together, J(v) was significantly reduced (P = 0.03). This reduction was blocked by the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine chloride (10(-6) M; P = 0.56) and by a second PKC inhibitor GF109203X (10(-5) M; P = 0.98). When PMA and ionomycin were added with the \u03b2-adrenergic agonist terbutaline, the terbutaline-induced increase in J(v) was abolished. Addition of PMA and ionomycin with the epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) blocker amiloride had no additional inhibitory effect. Together, these results suggest that PKC is likely to be involved in LL absorption, and the ability of PMA/ionomycin to block the terbutaline-induced increase in J(v) suggests that the downstream target of PKC is ENaC.",

Because catecholestradiols and catecholamines exhibit structural similarities and have high affinity for \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (ARs), we investigated whether the endothelial \u03b1- or \u03b2-ARs mediate catecholestradiol-induced proliferation of P-UAECs and whether catecholamines alter these responses. Western analyses revealed expression of specific AR subtypes in nonpregnant UAECs and P-UAECs, including \u03b1(2)-, \u03b2(2)-, and \u03b2(3)-ARs but not \u03b1(1)- and \u03b2(1)-ARs. Levels of \u03b2(2)-ARs and \u03b2(3)-ARs were unaltered by pregnancy, whereas \u03b1(2)-ARs were decreased. Norepinephrine and epinephrine increased P-UAEC, but not nonpregnant UAEC proliferation, and these effects were suppressed by propranolol (\u03b2-AR blocker) but not phentolamine (\u03b1-AR blocker). Catecholamines combinations with 2-OHE(2) or 4-OHE(2) enhanced P-UAEC mitogenesis. Catecholestradiol-induced P-UAEC proliferation was also inhibited by propranolol but not phentolamine. \u03b2(2)-AR and \u03b2(3)-AR antagonists (ICI 118 551and SR 59230A, respectively) abrogated the mitogenic effects of both 2-OHE(2) and 4-OHE(2). Stimulation of \u03b2(2)-ARs and \u03b2(3)-ARs using formoterol and BRL 37344 dose-dependently stimulated P-UAEC proliferation, which was abrogated by ICI 118 551 and SR 59230A, respectively. Proliferation effects of both catecholamines and catecholestradiols were only observed in P-UAECs (not nonpregnant UAECs) and were mediated via \u03b2(2)-ARs and \u03b2(3)-ARs.

This work aimed to investigate the antinociceptive action of curcumin on neuropathic pain and the underlying mechanism(s). Chronic constriction injury (CCI), a canonical animal model of neuropathic pain, was produced by loosely ligating the sciatic nerve in mice and von Frey hair or hot plate test was used to assess mechanical allodynia or thermal hyperalgesia (to heat), respectively. Chronic, but not acute, curcumin treatment (5, 15 or 45 mg/kg, p.o., twice per day for three weeks) alleviated mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in CCI mice, accompanied by increasing spinal monoamine (or metabolite) contents. Chemical ablation of descending noradrenaline (NA) by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), or depletion of descending serotonin by p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA), abolished curcumin's antinociceptive effect on mechanical allodynia or thermal hyperalgesia, respectively. The anti-allodynic action of curcumin on mechanical stimuli was totally blocked by chronic co-treatment with the \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551, or by acute co-treatment with the delta-opioid receptor antagonist naltrindole. Meanwhile, co-treatment with the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY-100635 chronically, or with the irreversible mu-opioid receptor antangonist \u03b2-funaltrexamine acutely, completely abrogated the anti-hyperalgesic action of curcumin on thermal stimuli. Collectively, these findings indicate that the descending monoamine system (coupled with spinal \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptor and 5-HT(1A) receptor) is critical for the modality-specific antinociceptive effect of curcumin in neuropathic pain. Delta- and mu-opioid receptors are likely rendered as downstream targets, accordingly. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder'.",

This paper compares and evaluates derivatization procedures for the determination of six \u03b2-blockers (acebutolol, atenolol, metoprolol, nadolol, propranolol, pindolol) and two \u03b2-agonists (salbutamol, terbutaline) using GC techniques. Nineteen different derivatizing reagents (nine of them used for the first time with almost all the drugs) were employed in order to obtain a single derivative for each target compound with the greatest effectiveness of this reaction. Trimethylsilylation, tert-butyldimethylsilylation, acylation (e.g. trifluoroacetylation), combined trimethylsilylation and acylation, and the formation of cyclized silyl derivatives were carried out and the mass spectra (EI, 70 eV) recorded. The influence of the reaction time and temperature on these procedures was investigated. Additionally, the effects of the type of solvent and the amount of added trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) on the silylation of the target compounds using N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) were tested.

After randomization group 1 comprised 56 patients (age 62.9+/-1.8 years) who were prescribed slow release metoprolol succinate (59.1+/-4.5 mg/day). Group 2 comprised 44 patients (age 59.4+/-1.3 years) who were prescribed If channel inhibitor ivabradine (12.1+/-2.3 mg/day) if beta-blocker use was not possible. Examination at baseline and in 6 months included treadmillometry with assessment of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) at exercise, echocardiography, 24-hour blood pressure monitoring, measurement of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in blood plasma. For objective qualitative assessment of the state of RAS we used a test of cardio-respiratory synchronism. Therapy with the use of ivabradine improved structural and functional state of the myocardium, elevated tolerance to exercise, caused positive changes of NT-proBNP concentration in blood plasma and VO2 max at exercise. Thus ivabradine probably can serve as alternative to -adrenoblockers when their use is not possible patients with FC III CHF at the background of IHD and/or stage III HD.",

In adult rats administered with 1000 \u03bcg testosterone enanthate at postnatal day 2 a higher density of catecholamine (CA)-synthesizing thymic cells, including thymocytes, and a rise in their CA content was found. In addition, in these animals increased thymic noradrenergic nerve fiber fluorescence intensity, reflecting their increased CA content, was detected. These changes were followed by an increase in thymic NA concentration. The rise in thymic NA content in thymic nerve fibers and cells was associated with changes in the expression of mRNA for enzymes controlling pivotal steps in NA biosynthesis (tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine-\u03b2-hydroxylase) and inactivation (monoamine oxidase). In contrast, the thymic level of \u03b2(2)-AR mRNA on a per cell basis and the receptor surface density on thymocytes was reduced in testosterone-treated (TT) rats. As a consequence, 14-day-long treatment with propranolol, a \u03b2-AR blocker, was ineffective in modulating T-cell differentiation/maturation in TT rats.

Ammonium hydroxide's high volatility leaves no residual additive in the purified sample unlike classical additives in preparative chromatography such as diethylamine and triethylamine. We demonstrate that the silica support is stable despite having ammonium hydroxide in the modifier by running a durability study for over 350 h (105 L of solvent, 105,000 column volumes) on an analytical Chiralcel OJ column and a second study for 30 h (7.2 L, 14,400 column volumes) on an analytical Lux Cellulose-1 column. The peak shape of small, basic molecules is greatly improved with the use of ammonium hydroxide and this improvement is very similar to those having 0.1% diethylamine as a mobile phase additive. Electrospray ionization is also enhanced with the presence of ammonium hydroxide compared with that of diethylamine. We have found that the age of the 28-30% bottle of ammonium hydroxide solution can have significant effects on the chromatography and we describe how this can be overcome.

It is shown that the endogenous rhythmical activity can be regulated not only by a change in frequency of basic rhythms, but also by action on all parameters and properties of their rhythmical variations and secondary rhythms. The changes in power of the heart secondary rhythms exceed considerably the frequency oscillations of basic rhythms during blockade of cholinergic innervation or a change in the motor activity level that affects both the basic rhythm circulation and respiration and their variations--secondary rhythms. The atropine blockade of M-cholinoreceptors at the studied ages changes the heart beating rhythm within the limits of 10% of bradicardia in newborns to tachycardia in the 3-week old animals. At the same time, power of the cardiac rhythm secondary oscillations changes several times. These data indicate that the cholinergic mechanisms play the key role in formation of the secondary rhythms and their correlation with motor activity.",

The results point out that the non-linear growth (exponential growth) of the films is not modified by the percentage of acetylation of the CHI (AC). The comparison of the thickness obtained by D-QCM and by ellipsometry has allowed us to calculate the water content of the films showing that the multilayers are highly hydrated. This agrees with the values of the complex shear modulus obtained from the analysis of D-QCM data that are in the MPa range, and show a transition from a viscous to mainly elastic behavior depending on the charge density of the CHI chains. The monomer surface density in each layer (obtained from the combination of ellipsometry and differential refractive index measurements) indicated that the mechanism of charge compensation depends on the percentage of acetylation of the CHI. It was found that the adsorption kinetics is a bimodal process with characteristic times that depend on the number and nature of each layer.

    "164": "The cardiac cycle imposes a mechanical stress that dilates elastic carotid arteries, while shear stress largely contributes to the endothelium-dependent dilation of downstream cerebral arteries. In the presence of dyslipidemia, carotid arteries stiffen while the endothelial function declines. We reasoned that stiffening of carotid arteries would be prevented by reducing resting heart rate (HR), while improving the endothelial function would regulate cerebral artery compliance and function. Thus we treated or not 3-mo-old male atherosclerotic mice (ATX; LDLr(-/-):hApoB(+/+)) for 3 mo with the sinoatrial pacemaker current inhibitor ivabradine (IVA), the \u03b2-blocker metoprolol (METO), or subjected mice to voluntary physical training (PT). Arterial (carotid and cerebral artery) compliance and endothelium-dependent flow-mediated cerebral dilation were measured in isolated pressurized arteries. IVA and METO similarly reduced (P < 0.05) 24-h HR by \u224815%, while PT had no impact. As expected, carotid artery stiffness increased (P < 0.05) in ATX mice compared with wild-type mice, while cerebral artery stiffness decreased (P < 0.05); this paradoxical increase in cerebrovascular compliance was associated with endothelial dysfunction and an augmented metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity (P < 0.05), without changing the lipid composition of the wall. Reducing HR (IVA and METO) limited carotid artery stiffening, but plaque progression was prevented by IVA only. In contrast, IVA maintained and PT improved cerebral endothelial nitric oxide synthase-dependent flow-mediated dilation and wall compliance, and both interventions reduced MMP-9 activity (P < 0.05); METO worsened endothelial dysfunction and compliance and did not reduce MMP-9 activity. In conclusion, HR-dependent mechanical stress contributes to carotid artery wall stiffening in severely dyslipidemic mice while cerebrovascular compliance is mostly regulated by the endothelium.", 
    "165": "Renal neurohormonal activation leading to a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) has been suggested as a mechanism for renal insufficiency (RI) in the setting of heart failure. We hypothesized that RI occurring in the presence of renal neurohormonal activation may be prognostically more important than RI in the absence of renal neurohormonal activation.",

The blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (BUN/Creatinine) was employed as a surrogate for renal neurohormonal activation and the primary outcome was the interaction between BUN/Creatinine and RI associated mortality. Baseline RI (GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m&sup2;) was associated with mortality in all study populations (P < 0.001). In patients with higher BUN/Creatinine, the risk of mortality was consistently greater in patients with RI [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) ESCAPE = 2.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-14.3, P = 0.019; BEST = 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.2, P = 0.002; SOLVD = 1.6, 95% CI 1.3-2.0, P = 0.001].

    "168": "In vivo application of the K(ATP)-channel blocker glibenclamide can reverse endotoxin-induced hypotension, vascular hyporeactivity and shock in experimental animals. The hypothesis of the present study is, that the drug effects might not only be based on direct inhibition of K(ATP)-channels of vascular smooth muscle cells, but might also reflect reduction of shock-induced excess proinflammatory cytokines and procoagulatory molecules produced in the blood monocytes.", 
    "169": "Human whole blood (normoxaemic or hypoxaemic) supplemented ex vivo with 100 ng/ml LPS was used to assess glibenclamide (3-100 \u03bcM) effects on IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, tissue factor, and plasminogen-activator-inhibitor-2 (PAI-2). Co-incubations with monocytes and erythrocytes and cytosolic calcium measurements were performed to reveal their purinergic intercellular interaction.", 
    "170": "In heparinized blood, glibenclamide reduced LPS-induced release of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha, tissue factor and PAI-2 mRNA in a concentration-dependent manner. When samples were subjected to strong hypoxemia using 95% N(2)/5% CO(2), these parameters became even more sensitive to the drug. No drug effect was observable in citrated blood or in isolated monocytes. IL-1 beta mRNA inhibition by glibenclamide appeared to be dependent on P2X7-receptor activation of monocytes by ATP-releasing erythrocytes during hypoxia. Cytosolic calcium values as well as the duration of calcium transients elicited by P2X7-receptor stimulation in isolated monocytes were strongly increased during hypoxia, both of which could be abolished by glibenclamide.",

    "172": "Alzheimer's disease is the most devastating neurodegenerative disorder in the elderly, yet treatment options are severely limited. The drug development effort to modify Alzheimer's disease pathology by intervention at beta amyloid production sites has been largely ineffective or inconclusive. The greatest challenge has been to identify and define downstream mechanisms reliably predictive of clinical symptoms. Beta amyloid accumulation leads to dysregulation of intracellular calcium by plasma membrane L-type calcium channels located on neuronal somatodendrites and axons in the hippocampus and cortex. Paradoxically, L-type calcium channel subtype Ca(v)1.2 also promotes synaptic plasticity and spatial memory. Increased intracellular calcium modulates amyloid precursor protein processing and affects multiple downstream pathways including increased hyperphosphorylated tau and suppression of autophagy. Isradipine is a Federal Drug Administration-approved dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that binds selectively to Ca(v)1.2 in the hippocampus. Our studies have shown that isradipine in vitro attenuates beta amyloid oligomer toxicity by suppressing calcium influx into cytoplasm and by suppressing Ca(v)1.2 expression. We have previously shown that administration of isradipine to triple transgenic animal model for Alzheimer's disease was well-tolerated. Our results further suggest that isradipine became bioavailable, lowered tau burden, and improved autophagy function in the brain. A better understanding of brain pharmacokinetics of calcium channel blockers will be critical for designing new experiments with appropriate drug doses in any future clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease. This review highlights the importance of Ca(v)1.2 channel overexpression, the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau and suppression of autophagy in Alzheimer's disease and modulation of this pathway by isradipine.", 
    "173": "Excessive renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activation within the kidney induces not only renal oxidative stress but also renal scarring and dysfunction. This study examined the effects of an angiotensin II (Ang II) type I receptor (AT1R) blocker (ARB) on the progression of renal injury in rat anti-glomerular basement membrane glomerulonephritis (GN), with a particular focus on the participation of glomerular RAS activation in glomerular structural alterations, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Nephritic rats were divided into 2 groups and treated with vehicle or ARB until day 28. Treatment with ARB improved proteinuria significantly in nephritic rats. Vehicle-treated nephritic rats developed crescentic GN accompanied by marked macrophage infiltration and the enhanced expression of glomerular \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), angiotensinogen (AGT), Ang II, AT1R, and NADPH oxidase (Nox2) on days 7 and 28 of GN. ARB improved pathologic alterations such as crescent formation and glomerulosclerosis, and it had a significant inhibitory effect on the levels of these parameters on day 28 of GN. Enhanced superoxide production in nephritic glomeruli was decreased also by ARB. Moreover, Ang II and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) in the supernatant of cultured glomeruli was increased significantly in vehicle-treated nephritic rats whereas ARB inhibited the production of these compounds significantly on day 28. These results indicate that increased glomerular RAS activity and the resulting Ang II play important roles in progressive glomerular injury-the induction of oxidative stress and TGF-\u03b2 expression, and they suggest that AT1R blockade attenuates proteinuria and progressive glomerular remodeling via the suppression of glomerular RAS activation in GN.",

The effect of nanodrug carriers on drug release and permeability was assessed using stripped porcine jejunum and everted rat gut sac method and compared with hydroalcoholic drug solution, oily solution, and conventional emulsion and suspension. The SNEDDS showed a significant (P < 0.001) increase in drug release, permeability, and in vivo bioavailability as compared to drug suspension.
