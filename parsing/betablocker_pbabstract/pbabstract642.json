The effects of neuropharmacological agents on the Tcp-induced convulsions were observed. dl-Propranolol, phentolamine, phenoxybenzamine and methysergide had been administered intraperitoneally 20 approximately 30 minutes before Tcp challenge. B-withdrawn rats had been pretreated with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, 5-hydroxytryptophan, p-chlorophenylalanine or reserpine, or with the combination of iproniazid and reserpine (5 hrs after iproniazid administration) before Tcp challenge. alpha-MT and dl-propranolol inhibited B withdrawal convulsion markedly, though high doses of dl-propranolol rather tended to show a less effect on the convulsion. alpha-Adrenoceptor blockers scarcely inhibited the convulsion. Methysergide or 5-HTP failed to inhibit, but PCPA intensified the convulsion. Reserpine, when administered alone, aggravated the convulsion, but when administered after iproniazid, inhibited it significantly. These findings suggested that the balance between the activities of noradrenergic and serotonergic neurons might be of importance in the manifestation of B withdrawal convulsions, the former probably being excitatory and the latter, inhibitory.", 
    "1": "The binding characteristics of beta-adrenergic ligand [3H]-dihydroalprenolol (DHA) were determined in particulate membranes of early human placenta (8-12 weeks of gestation). [3H]-DHA binding to crude membrane fractions was rapid, reversible, saturable and linearly correlated with the membrane protein concentration. Scatchard analysis of saturation experiments showed a KD of 2.80 +/- 0.9 nM and a density of binding sites of 330.30 +/- 93.5 fmol/mg protein. Agonist potency isoproterenol greater than epinephrine greater than norepinephrine indicated that early human placenta contains an adrenergic receptor of beta-2 subtype.", 
    "2": "Nifedipine, a calcium channel blocking drug with vasodilating action in both systemic and coronary arterial beds, was administered to 79 patients with a variety of ischemic heart diseases. Forty-five variant angina patients given a mean daily dose of 78 mg experienced a reduction from 2.6 to 0.28 attacks per day (p<0.001), confirmed by in-hospital ergonovine testing (22 patients) and outpatient 24-hour Holter monitoring (28 patients). Twenty-one stable post-acute myocardial infarction patients given a single 20 mg oral dose showed a significant (p<0.001) decrease in mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance, accompanied by a significant (p<0.01) increase in cardiac index and heart rate, most noticeable in the patients with the worst ventricular function. Symptoms were relieved in nine of 13 patients with class III and IV refractory angina pectoris when nifedipine 40-80 mg was added to nitrate and beta blocker therapy. Of angina patients, 40% experienced mild side effects, but only 3% were forced to stop therapy due to peripheral edema. No serious hemodynamic or electrocardiographic toxicity occurred. Precautions should be taken if hepatic enzyme abnormalities or reflex tachycardia develop which may worsen angina. Diltiazem and verapamil have different hemodynamic effect and can be used advantageously in some clinical circumstances.", 
    "3": "The beta-blocking action of 100 mg per diem Atenol was evaluated in 8 patients with conditions requiring treatment with a beta-blocking drugs (ischaemic cardiopathy, arterial hypertension, hypertrophic myocardiopathy). Ergometer bicycle exertion tests were used to evaluate the extent of Atenol's beta-blocking action (in basal condition, 3 and 24 hours after administration of the drug) as well as Holter type dynamic ECG recordings (basal and under treatment). The drug significantly reduced cardiac frequency and arterial pressure both at rest and under exertion. It also significantly reduced average hourly and daily cardiac frequency as shown by dynamic ECG. No side effects of the drug were observed.", 
    "4": "Simultaneous bilateral fluorescein angiography of the iris vessels (SIFA) was performed on 2 groups of patients. One group comprised previously untreated patients with elevated intraocular pressure who underwent a SIFA both before and after a 3 days' timolol treatment in one eye and pilocarpine treatment in the other eye. The other group consisted of glaucomatous patients treated with timolol for 4 to 24 (mean 11) months before the angiography. Short- or long-term use of timolol neither caused, increased nor decreased leak of the dye from the iris vessels, either at the pupillary border, or in other areas of the iris. Dynamics of the blood flow also remained unaffected. Short-term use of pilocarpine increased extrapupillary focal leakage in one eye.", 
    "5": "Reports on drug absorption in intestinal diseases are scarce. To investigate pindolol absorption, a drug particularly well absorbed and with low hepatic extraction, plasma concentrations and 54-h urinary excretion (after both oral and intravenous dose) were studied in 6 healthy volunteers and 13 patients with intestinal malabsorption (coeliac disease 5 cases, short bowel syndrome 8 cases) after an overnight fasting. Pindolol plasma concentrations were almost identical after a single intravenous dose in both patients and controls. Again mean blood levels after an unique oral dose were not significantly different between the two groups. However, absorption was slow and/or delayed in eight out of thirteen patients and overall absorption was decreased in two of them. These abnormalities might be related to the diseased intestine, since plasma concentrations and urinary excretion following intravenous administration were quite similar to those observed in volunteers. Nevertheless, results were not related to the extent of the intestinal disease nor the degree of impairment of small intestinal function.", 
    "6": "We have observed dextroamphetamine sulfate to cause cardiovascular malformations in the 4-day-old chick embryo. Essentially all malformations were of the heart and great vessels. About one-half of these were the abnormal persistence of the left fourth aortic arch. Ventricular septal defects comprised the vast majority of the other malformations. Since d-amphetamine has both a direct and, more importantly, an indirect mode of alpha and beta adrenergic stimulation, three drugs were used to try to inhibit malformation production: alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (AMT), a catecholamine synthesis inhibitor; metoprolol, a beta 1 blocker; and phentolamine, an alpha blocker. When given with d-amphetamine, all three drugs significantly reduced the malformation rate resulting from d-amphetamine alone. We speculate that the embryonic chick is capable of responding to the alpha and/or beta properties of dextroamphetamine sulfate. These properties may be causally related to the malformations observed.", 
    "7": "Measurements of potassium status were reviewed in 23 hypertensive patients receiving metoprolol either alone or in combination with chlorthalidone or chlorthalidone plus potassium over an average period of nine months. There was no statistically significant change in plasma potassium, total blood cell or total body potassium in patients on long-term metoprolol. Four subjects (17%) in the diuretic groups developed hypokalaemia (serum potassium less than 3.0 mmol/l) in the absence of significant falls in total blood cell or total body potassium. Thus the use of chlorthalidone plus potassium did not provide adequate prophylaxis against hypokalaemia even in metoprolol recipients. The study confirms that monitoring parameters of potassium handling is still necessary in beta-blocker recipients who also receive diuretics alone or in a fixed-dose combination with potassium.", 
    "8": "The responses to isoprenaline, phenylephrine, and carbachol in different segments of isolated intact oviduct were studied. Smooth muscle electrical activity was recorded with suction electrodes placed, one electrode in each, in the infundibulum, proximal magnum, distal magnum, isthmus, shell gland, and vagina. The drugs were added cumulatively. Only in the magnum did isoprenaline cause a significant change in the frequency of spike discharges; the decrease was about 20%. The effects of phenylephrine were not so clear, although the frequency of the electrical activity increased 30% in the shell gland. With the exception of the infundibulum, carbachol significantly increased the frequency of the oviductal electrical activity. It was concluded that adrenergic nerves have only a minor role in controlling quail oviductal smooth muscle because the oviduct was rather insensitive to adrenergic drugs whereas the cholinergic drug carbachol caused a strong response.", 
    "9": "The parameters of water-electrolyte metabolism and central hemodynamics were studied in 44 patients with essential hypertension (stage II-III) after 3-week treatment with sympatholytics and diuretics. Patients with hyperkinetic type of hemocirculation had a sodium lack at the stage of stable hypertension, therefore the diuretic treatment is not indicated for such patients. The treatment with the diuretic oxodolin was accompanied by the decrease in the peripheral resistance of blood vessels, in sodium metabolism and its extracellular fraction, and by the increase of the deposit sodium fraction. The elevation of the renin-angiotensin system activity due to the diuretic therapy did not influence the blood pressure level and the central hemodynamics parameters.", 
    "10": "Cardioselective beta-blocking agent tenormin (atenolol) was used in 55 patients with essential hypertension, Stage II; in 20 of those, central, intracardiac and regional hemodynamics were assessed echocardiographically and rheographically. Tenormin produced a pronounced hypotensive effect within 2-4 weeks of treatment (BP decreasing by 26.8/22.8%). A significant decrease was noted in cardiac index (by 26.8%), heart rate (by 24%), intramyocardial tension (by 21.9%), the myocardial circular fibre shortening rate (by 6.5%), left-ventricular myocardial wall thickness and weight (by 4.5%). Total vascular peripheral resistance did not change significantly (it dropped in half of the patients). Stroke index, output fraction and left-ventricular size remained unchanged. Cerebral and femoral arterial tone also decreased. Tenormin was effective in 5 patients with hypertension combined with bronchial asthma. Owing to its prolonged action, tenormin can be administered once or twice daily, a factor that facilitates considerably prolonged out-patient treatment.", 
    "11": "The pharmacokinetics of atenolol were investigated following single intravenous (25 mg) and oral administration (100 mg) of atenolol in 13 patients with chronic liver disease and normal renal function and in 12 normal healthy volunteers. Four of the patients with chronic liver disease were not included in the statistical evaluation of kinetic data, since a reduction of creatinine clearance was observed during the course the study after ingestion of atenolol. A tendency to an increased distribution volume of atenolol could be observed in subjects with liver disease compared to normal volunteers. After intravenous and oral administration of atenolol, pharmacokinetic parameters such as elimination half-life, plasma clearance, and renal clearance did not differ significantly between patients with chronic liver disease and healthy volunteers. Thus, plasma half-life after intravenous dosing of atenolol was 6.0 +/- 0.46 hours in patients with hepatic disease and 5.0 +/- 0.4 hours in the controls, indicating absence of atenolol accumulation in hepatic failure. In the first days after starting beta-blocker therapy such as atenolol administration, parameters of kidney function as plasma creatinine, or possibly creatinine clearance, should be initially monitored at regular intervals, as there may be transient changes of renal function in patients with chronic liver disease, leading to delayed elimination of the drug.", 
    "12": "The effect of pindolol, a beta blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), on serum lipoprotein composition was studied in 13 patients admitted to the hospital for an attack of coronary heart disease. The control group consisted of 11 coronary patients without any beta-blocker therapy. Pindolol therapy was started during the stay in the hospital with a dose of 2.5-5.0 mg 2-3 times daily (mean dose 7.5 mg daily) and continued unaltered throughout the study. Serum samples were taken upon admission to the hospital and 4-6 months later, when the effect of acute coronary heart attack was stabilized. Initial serum cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol values were 6.82 mmol/l and 1.04 mmol/l, respectively. The ratio of HDL-cholesterol to total cholesterol (HDL/total) was 0.155 and serum triglycerides 1.78 mmol/l. During the pindolol therapy HDL-cholesterol and the HDL/total ratio increased by 12.5 and 11.2%, respectively, and the triglyceride level decreased by 16.9%. These changes, however, were not statistically significant due to interindividual variation. The results suggest that pindolol, unlike some other beta blockers, has no harmful effect on lipoprotein metabolism. This finding may have relevance when choosing a beta blocker for a patient with coronary heart disease.", 
    "13": "We studied the cardiovascular effects of increasing intrathoracic pressure in an acute pentobarbital-anesthetized canine model of acute ventricular failure induced by large doses of propranolol. Left ventricular (LV) function curves were generated by volume loading from LV filling pressures of 5-20 Torr. The animals were ventilated by using intermittent positive-pressure ventilation with large tidal volumes (30 ml/kg). Chest and abdominal pneumatic binders were used to increase intrathoracic pressure. When compared with the control state, acute ventricular failure was associated with a decrease in the slope of the LV function curves (P less than 0.01). After binding the increase in intrathoracic pressure (1.1 +/- 1.6 to 12.1 +/- 2.4 Torr, P less than 0.01) was associated with an improvement in both right ventricular and LV function. Our study demonstrates that in this model of acute ventricular failure, increasing intrathoracic pressure improves cardiac function. We postulate that this observed improvement with increased intrathoracic pressure is due to reduced LV wall stress in a manner analogous to that seen with arterial vasodilator therapy in congestive heart failure.", 
    "14": "We administered atenolol to 10 patients with effort limiting angina pectoris. Doses of 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg provided significant improvement (P less than 0.05) in exercise tolerance tested 24 hours after the drug was given. Twenty-five milligrams was not significantly better than placebo in increasing work tolerance. Side effects were minimal, and treatment could be continued throughout the study. The beta-blocker atenolol is an effective drug in the treatment of exercise-induced angina.", 
    "15": "The possibility of preventing morphological changes in arterial walls in coarctation of the thoracic aorta with antihypertensive therapy was evaluated in an experimental study on dogs. Seven mongrel dogs weighing 2350-2980 g were operated upon at the age of 2 months. Antihypertensive therapy with a diuretic (hydrocholothiazide 25 mg/day), beta-blocker (propranolol and 80 mg/day) and vasodilatator (prazosin ad 40 mg/day) was started 1 month after the experimental coarctation was produced in the animals. Blood pressure decreased significantly, although not to the level of the control group. Seven months after the coarctation a perfusion fixation was done. Morphometrical light microscopic analysis was performed on the coronary and cerebral arteries. The histochemical findings in the aorta were analysed qualitatively, as was the amount of lipid in the coronary and the middle cerebral arteries. Electron microscopic studies were performed on the coronary artery. The findings were compared to the control and coarctated (non-treated) groups studied earlier (Uhari et al., 1982). Active antihypertensive therapy prevented all the major morphological changes previously reported to occur in coarctation. We suggest that active antihypertensive therapy started immediately after the diagnosis of coarctation might improve the prognosis of the patients with aortic coarctation by preventing morphological changes in the great arteries.", 
    "16": "1 Free fractions of diazepam, propranolol and warfarin were determined in 15 male chronic alcoholics in alcohol withdrawal. 2 On admission the mean free fraction of diazepam was 25% above and propranolol 44% below the limits of normal range, while the mean warfarin free fraction was in high normal range. One week later mean free fraction of diazepam declined by 20% while propranolol and warfarin increased by 24% and 19% respectively (P less than 0.05). 3 Propranolol free fraction and alpha 1-AGP concentrations were highly correlated (linear r = -0.83, P less than 0.001). In contrast the sources of variation in diazepam and warfarin free fraction were more complex and less certain. 4 Statistically significant changes of drug free fractions in serum of chronic alcoholics were observed during alcohol withdrawal. The extent and direction of these changes differed for various classes of drugs and their potential causes appear to be quite different. 5 Clinically important changes in drug effect may be present acutely, within the dosing interval, as a result of altered drug binding. These are more likely when the clinical response is closely related to drug concentration and will occur within the dosing interval due to larger fluctuations in free drug concentration, even though the average free drug concentration will remain unchanged. 6 Total drug level changes will be observed during alcohol withdrawal even in absence of detectable changes of drug metabolism.", 
    "17": "1 Labetalol pharmacokinetics and concentration-effect relationships following intravenous administration have been studied in 10 women during the last trimester of pregnancies complicated by hypertension, in seven of these women postpartum (when normotensive) and in 10 normotensive female volunteers. 2 The clearance and volume of distribution of labetalol were the same in all three groups. Clearance values (1 min-1) were: pregnant, 2.16 (range 1.54-3.14); postpartum 2.35 (1.56-3.85); controls 1.96 (0.98-2.61). Volumes of distribution (1) were: pregnant 274 (250-547); postpartum 407 (248-701); controls 234 (186-415). 3 A linear model relating labetalol concentration to effect successfully described the antihypertensive action of labetalol in the pregnant patients. Supine systolic blood pressure fell by 0.38 (0.14-0.91) mm Hg per ng ml-1 of labetalol and diastolic by 0.36 (0.21-1.14) mm Hg per ng ml-1 of labetalol. In the other two groups labetalol did not lower pressure sufficiently to allow modelling to be performed. 4 We conclude that pregnancy does not alter the clearance or volume of distribution of labetalol. Modelling techniques can be applied successfully to drug induced blood pressure changes during pregnancy.", 
    "18": "1 The present study compared the effects in healthy volunteers of the acute and chronic administration of placebo, pindolol and propranolol to see if the partial agonist activity of pindolol was reduced by the beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity of pindolol on chronic administration. 2 Five subjects received in random order for 8 days placebo, propranolol 160 mg and pindolol 10 mg; on days 1 and 8 treatments were given twice at 0 and 2 h. Heart rate in supine position and at end of exercise was recorded before dosing and at 2 and 4 h post-dosing on days 1 and 8. 3 Propranolol and pindolol reduced exercise heart rate to the same extent on days 1 and 8. 4 Propranolol reduced supine heart rate more than pindolol on days 1 and 8 but the difference was only significant on day 8.",

    "20": "This report describes the anaesthetic management of a ventricular arrhythmia-prone patient with a prolonged Q-T interval for closed reduction and wiring of a mandibular fracture. The patient was premedicated with propranolol and anaesthetized with isoflurane (inhalation). Documentation of heart rate v. Q-T interval revealed the benefit of this technique.", 
    "21": "Internal defibrillating leads were implanted in 6 dogs through a left thoracotomy and in 6 pigs through a subxiphoid approach. The effects of digoxin (0.04 mg per kilogram of body weight), procainamide (15 mg per kilogram), and propranolol (0.2 mg per kilogram) on the defibrillation threshold was determined 30 to 60 minutes following intravenous administration. Resultant blood levels were equal to or greater than therapeutic levels. Individually these drugs resulted in no appreciable change in the defibrillation threshold from baseline. Pathological study of the myocardium obtained from 6 dogs that underwent more than two hundred shocks each did not demonstrate any abnormality. The 6 pigs were reliably defibrillated, this indicating that thoracotomy is not required for successful implantation. The automatic implantable defibrillator is not the definitive treatment for recurrent ventricular arrhythmias, but is a practical regimen of therapy for a select group of high-risk, out-of-hospital patients. These observations advance our knowledge of the use of this device and give more assurance for future implantation in this select group of patients.", 
    "22": "The interactions between baroreceptor and sympathetic pathways were determined in anesthetized cats using computer summation techniques. Electrical stimuli applied to baroreceptor afferent nerves produced an early and late period of inhibition of sympathetic nervous discharge (SND) recorded from the external carotid or inferior cardiac nerves. The late period of baroreceptor-induced inhibition summated algebraically with the cardiac-locked slow wave of SND during all phases of the cardiac cycle. Increases in the intensity of baroreceptor stimulation resulted in an increase in the amplitude and duration of the late inhibition. Alterations in the periodicity of SND failed to effect the late phase of inhibition. Picrotoxin blocked the late period of baroreceptor-induced inhibition but enhanced the cardiac locking of SND. These data indicate that the late period of inhibition reflects the ability of afferent nerves to modulate the amplitude of central sympathetic outflow, regardless of its periodicity. In addition, the central baroreceptor pathways involved in amplitude modulation and temporal locking of SND to the cardiac cycle are distinct and are located at the level of the brain stem. A spinal component of baroreceptor-induced sympathoinhibition is also described.", 
    "23": "Norepinephrine increases the spontaneous contraction frequency of isolated bovine lymphatic vessels but, paradoxically, reduces contraction force. In this investigation contractions were elicited by electrical stimulation, applied as field stimulation or across a sucrose gap. Evoked contractions were not reduced in force by concentrations of norepinephrine that have previously been shown to dramatically reduce contractility in spontaneously active vessels. However, at higher concentrations a beta-inhibitory component of the norepinephrine effect was often observed. Simultaneous recordings of electrical and mechanical activity from spontaneously active vessels showed that each spontaneous contraction was initiated by a single action potential. Norepinephrine significantly disrupted electrical activity causing increased action potential frequency, reduction in action potential amplitude, and frequent failure of full action potential development. We conclude that norepinephrine depresses the force of spontaneous contractions by disruption of spontaneous pacemaking rather than by any direct effect on vessel contractility.", 
    "24": "The effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) on the feline ileum and ileocecal sphincter (ICS) were studied in vivo using simultaneous myoelectric and pressure recordings. Both inhibitory and excitatory responses were seen in the ileum and ICS, with the inhibitory response being seen with lower doses of 5-HT (EDmax for inhibition was 5.0 micrograms/kg and EDmax for contractile response was 80.0 micrograms/kg). The inhibitory and excitatory responses were antagonized separately by different 5-HT antagonists. Methysergide inhibited the ICS relaxation response only, whereas cinanserin inhibited the ICS contractile response. Neither effect was inhibited by tetrodotoxin, suggesting that 5-HT acts directly on the smooth muscle at at least two separate receptors. In addition, methysergide alone resulted in a usually tonic increase (8.6 +/- 0.6 mmHg) in basal ICS pressure (P less than 0.05) without an ileal effect, and tetrodotoxin alone induced phasic ileal and ICS contractions (delta ICS = 7.3 +/- 1.5 mmHg). These data suggest the action of at least two inhibitory neurons tonically at the ICS.", 
    "25": "Short-term topical application of timolol, in a prospective, randomized, double-masked study of 32 human eyes, was associated with an average aqueous humor protein concentration of 38 mg/100 ml, compared to 13 mg/100 ml in control subjects (P less than .001). This apparent influence of timolol on aqueous protein levels probably resulted from reduced aqueous production. It did not affect the course of intraocular surgery.", 
    "26": "Ventricular arrhythmia originating from the outflow tract of the right ventricle is a presumed cause of late sudden death in patients after repair of tetralogy of Fallot. Exercise testing has been shown to enhance detection, and phenytoin has been shown to control ventricular arrhythmias in these patients. This study reports new findings in 3 patients who underwent electrophysiologic studies at postoperative cardiac catheterization; in each, sustained ventricular tachycardia was induced and found to originate from the inflow-septal area of the right ventricle. Using serial studies, the same sustained ventricular tachycardia was induced during therapeutic serum concentrations of phenytoin but not after propranolol. No patient had ventricular arrhythmia during a 24-hour electrocardiogram or during exercise. Although no patient had normal hemodynamic function, only 1 patient had right ventricular pressure greater than two-thirds systemic pressure. Each patient had undergone initial intracardiac repair at a relatively late age (3, 9, and 9 years).", 
    "27": "The effects of intravenous injection of prenalterol, a selective beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist, on central haemodynamics and the distribution of ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) were assessed in eight patients after aortic and/or mitral valve replacement. VA/Q distributions were determined by the multiple inert gas elimination technique. Administration of prenalterol resulted in a significant increase in cardiac output and heart rate with no changes in mean pulmonary arterial pressure and wedge pressure. There was an insignificant fall in arterial oxygen tension from 14.3 to 12.4 kPa, accompanied by a significant increase in the inert gas shunt from 6.4 to 11.3% of cardiac output, while the configuration of the distribution of perfusion and ventilation on VA/Q remained unchanged. The increase in shunt was probably more an effect of the increase in cardiac output than a direct effect of the drug on the pulmonary vascular bed.", 
    "28": "The purpose of the present experiments was to evaluate the pharmacological properties of the discriminative stimulus effects of the prototypic sigma receptor agonist N-allylnormetazocine (NANM, SKF 10,047). Rats were trained to discriminate between saline and 3.0 or 5.6 mg/kg of NANM in a two-choice, shock-avoidance procedure. NANM-like stimulus control of behavior was produced by the opiates, in order of relative molar potency, cyclazocine greater than NANM greater than N-propylnormetazocine HCI greater than levallorphan greater than dextrorphan greater than pentazocine. Metazocine produced NANM-like discriminative effects but only when tested concomitantly with naloxone. Seven other opiate derivatives, including levorphanol, ethylketazocine and nalorphine, failed to produce NANM-like discriminative stimuli. Among enantiomeric pairs tested in the lower training dose group, d-NANM and l-NANM as well as levallorphan and dextrallorphan were equipotent, but the levo isomers of cyclazocine and pentazocine were more potent than their dextro counterparts, whereas dextrorphan but not levorphanol produced NANM-like discriminative stimuli. In the lower training dose group, the opioid antagonist naloxone failed to antagonize the NANM-like discriminative effects of NANM, l-cyclazocine and levallorphan, although naloxone did produce a parallel shift to the right of the dose-effect curve for pentazocine, and \"unmasked\" NANM-like effects of higher doses of metazocine. The nonopiate psychoactive drugs phencyclidine and dexoxadrol, but not its enantiomer levoxadrol produced NANM-like discriminative stimuli. Propranolol also occasioned an appreciable percentage of NANM-appropriate responding in the lower training dose group but not the higher dose group. Diazepam, d-amphetamine, d-lysergic acid diethylamide tartrate, imipramine, clonidine and haloperidol also failed to produce NANM-like discriminative stimuli in the lower training dose group. The present results demonstrate that the discriminative stimulus properties of NANM are distinguishable from those of morphine and ethylketazocine but similar to those of dissociative anesthetics such as phencyclidine and lend additional support to the hypothesis that sigma receptors mediate the common actions of NANM and phencyclidine.", 
    "29": "Basic lipophilic drugs such as propranolol and lidocaine are strongly bound by alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein, also called orosomucoid. Although the liver is known to rapidly clear plasma protein-bound propranolol or lidocaine, it is generally regarded that peripheral tissues, such as brain or heart, are only exposed to the small fraction of drug that is free or dialyzable in vitro. The \"free drug\" hypothesis is subjected to direct empiric testing in the present studies using human sera and an in vivo rat brain paradigm. Serum from 27 human subjects (normal individuals, newborns, or patients with either metastatic cancer or rheumatoid arthritis) were found to have up to a sevenfold variation in orosomucoid concentrations. The free propranolol or lidocaine as determined in vitro by equilibrium dialysis at 37 degrees C varied inversely with the orosomucoid concentration. Similarly the rate of transport of propranolol or lidocaine through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was inversely related to the existing serum concentration of orosomucoid. However, the inhibition of rat brain extraction of drug by orosomucoid in vivo was only about one-fifth of that predicted by free drug measurements in vitro. This large discrepancy suggested orosomucoid-bound drug was readily available for transport into brain in vivo. Studies using purified human orosomucoid in the rat brain extraction assay also showed that orosomucoidbound propranolol or lidocaine is readily transported through the BBB. Conversely, albumin-bound propranolol or lidocaine was not transported through the BBB. The studies using albumin provide evidence that the in vivo rat brain paradigm used in the present investigations is capable of confirming, when possible, predictions made by the \"free drug\" hypothesis. These data suggest that the amount of circulating propranolol or lidocaine that is available for transport into a peripheral tissue such as brain is not restricted to the free (dialyzable) moiety but includes the much larger globulin-bound fraction. Therefore, existing pharmacokinetic models should be expanded to account for the transport of protein-bound drugs into peripheral tissues similar to what is known to occur in liver.", 
    "30": "The relationship between alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) plasma concentration and plasma verapamil binding was examined in samples obtained 15 minutes after 10 mg IV verapamil to 15 subjects. There was a good correlation (r = 0.83) between the binding ratio and AAG concentration, suggesting that AAG could bind verapamil. This was confirmed in vitro by the addition of AAG to an albumin solution, which resulted in a strong correlation between binding ratio (r = 0.99) and AAG concentration. The relationship between both free and total plasma concentrations and the effects of verapamil on the PR interval was also examined several times after 10 mg IV verapamil in seven of the subjects. While there was a correlation between log of both concentrations and the percent prolongation in PR interval (P less than 0.001), the correlation was stronger with free drug concentration (r2 = 0.58) than with total plasma concentration (r2 = 0.36). The range of free concentrations associated with a given effect (220%) was also narrower than that for total concentration (300%). While these data indicate that AAG is responsible for most of the variability in plasma verapamil binding, which in turn contributes somewhat to variation in effectiveness of a given total plasma concentration, neither of these causes of individual variations is likely to have a major clinical impact in patients who, apart from arrhythmia, are otherwise healthy.", 
    "31": "A simple method for quantifying visual field survival was devised to assess the progress of chronic simple glaucoma in 36 patients treated with timolol maleate over a 3-year period. Routine tonometric monitoring of the intraocular pressure (IOP) was carried out in conjunction with these Goldmann field studies. Statistical analysis revealed that field survival measurement provided a more consistent clinical guide to the progress of glaucoma under treatment than did IOP (p much less than 0.001). Timolol therapy was associated with sustained IOP reductions of 24.3-34.5%, and 63% of those treated who were monitored for field survival showed no significant field loss. The observed relationships of IOP to field survival are discussed.", 
    "32": "To evaluate the role of ventricular baroreceptors in humans, we studied the effects of propranolol on reflex vasoconstrictor responses to simulated orthostatic stress. We measured forearm vascular resistance in 10 normal males in the control state and during lower body negative pressure (LBNP) at -10 and -40 mm Hg before and after propranolol (0.1 mg/kg i.v.). Baseline forearm vascular resistance showed no significant change: 23.9 +/- 3.4 U (+/- SEM) before vs 28.0 +/- 0.5 U after propranolol. Reflex increases in forearm vascular resistance during LBNP at -10 and -40 mm Hg were 5.2 +/- 1.2 and 21.2 +/- 6.6 U before and 3.4 +/- 1.2 and 10.6 +/- 2.2 U, respectively, after propranolol. Thus, propranolol significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced responses to LBNP at -40 mm Hg. In contrast to the effects with LBNP, propranolol did not attenuate increases in forearm vascular resistance during the cold pressor test and handgrip, thus excluding a nonspecific depression of reflexes. We also studied the effects of propranolol on carotid baroreflex-mediated vasoconstrictor responses to neck pressure at 15 and 30 mm Hg. Propranolol had no significant effect on the vasoconstrictor responses to neck pressure. In conclusion, propranolol selectively attenuates vasoconstrictor responses to LBNP. We suggest that this results from a propranolol-induced decrease in the activity of cardiac ventricular baroreceptors. The results support the view that ventricular baroreceptors play an important role in reflex adjustments to orthostatic stress in humans.", 
    "33": "The hemodynamic effects of an acute infusion of prenalterol (PN), a new inotropic beta-adrenoceptor agonist, have been evaluated by cardiac catheterization in 10 patients with primary dilated (congestive) cardiomyopathy. A single dose of 20 micrograms/kg was administered over 5 min after basal hemodynamic and angiographic measurements. The administration of prenalterol caused a significant increase in mean cardiac index, from 2.3 to 3.3 l/min/m2 (P less than 0.01) and mean stroke volume, from 47 to 62 ml (P less than 0.01) without a change in heart rate. Mean left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was reduced from 19 to 13 mm Hg (P less than 0.05) and left ventricular dp/dt rose from 902 to 1089 mm Hg/s (P less than 0.01). Stroke work index increased from 27 to 40 g m/m2 (P less than 0.01) and ejection fraction from 31 to 36% (P less than 0.05). Mean blood pressure did not change and the systemic vascular resistance decreased from 24 to 17 RU (P less than 0.01). The favorable effect of prenalterol on left ventricular relaxation was shown by an increase of peak negative left ventricular dp/dt from 946 to 1159 mm Hg/s and by a decrease of the time constant of left ventricular pressure fall from 49 to 39 s. These results demonstrated a positive inotropic effect of prenalterol on patients with diffuse and severely reduced contractility.", 
    "34": "Five experiments examined the role of circulating androgens in the control of sexual behavior (lordosis) in the intact cycling rat. The androgen receptor blocker, flutamide (FLU), was administered daily to cycling rats beginning on the day of estrus, and lordotic responsiveness was measured on the 2nd subsequent proestrus day and on the day of estrus. FLU-treated females showed significantly higher levels of lordosis throughout the end of the period of estrus than controls (Experiment 1). Neither the maximal levels of lordosis seen on the evening of proestrus nor the time of onset of estrous responsiveness during the preceeding afternoon were affected by FLU (Experiment 2). Serum estradiol concentrations seen on the morning of proestrus (Experiment 3) did not differ between FLU- and vehicle-treated animals. The weak 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor, testosterone-17 beta-carboxylic acid (17 beta C), prolonged slightly, but did not significantly lengthen, the period of estrus (Experiment 4), while the highly potent steroidal 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor, 4 MA, significantly increased the rate at which estrous behavior declined on the day of estrus (Experiment 5). Circulating androgens do not appear to affect the maximal level of sexual receptivity displayed nor the time of estrus onset; however, they may govern the duration of the period of estrus by influencing the rate of estrus termination.", 
    "35": "Human trigone and porcine urethral, bladder neck and trigone smooth muscle were exposed to transmural electric field stimulation in vitro. The responses were composed of different combinations of a relaxation phase and a contraction phase. A few strips exhibited contractions only and a few strips relaxation only. The individual strip retained the behavior throughout the experiment. No systematic difference in the responses was found in strips from the different regions. The configuration of the response was slightly shifted in favor of contraction by beta-adrenergic blockade with propanolol and prostaglandin synthesis inhibition with Ketoprofen. After alpha-adrenergic blockade with phentolamine and cholinergic blockade with atropine, the reverse effect was seen with augmentation of the relaxation and reduction of the contraction. The relaxation phase was completely abolished by nerve poisoning with tetrodotoxin, but was still observed with all other antagonists present, and was therefore nerve-mediated through non-cholinergic, non-adrenergic and non-prostaglandin transmitter or modulator systems.", 
    "36": "Recently, it has been shown that nonischemic parts of the heart in myocardial infarction were separated from ischemic damaged ones by a sharp border zone. In this connection, the disturbance of contractile function of the myocardium of nonischemic parts is suggested to result from the infarction-concomitant emotional-painful stress. In order to test this assumption, the contractile function of the right auricle, which is an a priori nonischemic heart division, was studied in rats subjected to myocardial infarction of the left ventricle. In the study of the isolated auricle the following facts were established: 1 day after the induced infarction the atrial myocardium shows reduced extensibility, depression of the Starling curve, a concomitant approximately twofold decrease of the maximal systolic tension, and a reduced myocardial resistance to hypoxia and calcium excess. This complex of shifts, first, is completely reproduced without myocardial infarction by emotional-painful stress and, second, can be prevented to a considerable extent by propranolol indicating that it is essentially stress induced. In infarction, these above said stress-induced disturbances of the contractile function of nonischemic divisions of the heart were found to be prevented or limited by factors stabilizing the membranous lipid bilayer of cardiomyocytes, i.e., by antioxidant ionol, by nicotinamide, a lipase inhibitor, and by chloroquine, a phospholipase inhibitor. The aspects of application of these factors for the therapy of ischemic heart disease requires further studies.", 
    "37": "The rise in metabolic rate after intragastric feeding with fat and carbohydrate was enhanced in cold-acclimated (5 degrees C) rats and diminished in warm-acclimated (30 degrees C) rats compared to controls (24 degrees C), but the response was largest in cold-acclimated animals intubated with fat. These acute effects of nutrients were almost completely abolished by beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol in all groups, while the parasympathetic antagonist atropine sulphate enhanced the responses in control rats, but had little effect in cold-acclimated animals. Feeding carbohydrate produced similar increases in interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) temperature in control and cold-acclimated rats, but fat caused a much greater rise in the latter group. The thermic effects of both nutrients were lower in genetically obese Zucker rats than in their lean littermates. Atropine slightly increased the thermic responses to fat and carbohydrate in the lean Zucker rats and caused marked potentiation in obese rats intubated with fat, but did not alter the effect of carbohydrate in the obese animals These data suggest that the size of the acute rise in metabolic rate after fat and carbohydrate is dependent on the thermogenic capacity of the animal. The response to fat was particularly large in cold-acclimated rats, where BAT activity is high, possibly due to a direct action of fat on the tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "38": "Rats treated with DSP-4 showed a marked enhancement of shock-induced fighting (SIF). Administration of 1-propranolol attenuated or completely counteracted SIF in control animals, but only the highest dose (10 mg/kg) of this beta-adrenergic antagonist was effective in reducing SIF in DSP-4 animals. Other behavioral experiments indicated that the responsiveness of DSP-4 rats to dopaminergic, serotoninergic, and cholinergic agonists was unchanged compared to that of control rats. The results confirm the participation of the noradrenergic system in SIF, and substantiate an involvement of beta-adrenergic receptors in this kind of aggression.", 
    "39": "Frog liver adenylate cyclase was characterized with respect to divalent cation interaction and hormonally stimulated activities. The enzyme catalyzed the synthesis of cyclic [32P]3',5'-AMP from alpha-32P-labeled ATP. The activity of the enzyme was linear with time and protein concentration. The Km for ATP was 0.5 mM, in the presence or absence of stimulators. The temperature optimum was 25 degrees. GTP (10(-4) M) increased the stimulation of adenylate cyclase by epinephrine. Similar activities were obtained using 5 mM Mg2+ or Mn2+. At higher concentrations, both ions inhibited epinephrine-stimulated, but not basal or fluoride-stimulated activities. Approximately equivalent hormonal stimulation was obtained with maximal stimulating concentrations of epinephrine, isoproterenol, glucagon, and prostaglandin E1. Norepinephrine was less stimulatory. Only catecholamine-stimulated activities were inhibited by propranolol (10(-5) M). The data suggest that catecholamines stimulate frog liver adenylate cyclase through interactions with beta adrenergic receptors. The adenylate cyclase in frog liver differs from its mammalian counterpart in its response to temperature and maximally stimulatory concentrations of hormones.", 
    "40": "Effects of ftorafur and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) on the canine sinoatrial node were studied using isolated sinoatrial node and an atrial preparation which were obtained from puppies and perfused with oxygenated Tyrode solution through the dorsal right atrial artery (sinus node artery). The injection of ftorafur and 5-FU caused positive inotropic and chronotropic effects. However, the solvent of 5-FU caused similar effects. These positive inotropic and chronotropic effects were not abolished by pindolol. Verapamil did not alter the effects of ftorafur and 5-FU. Also a change in extracellular calcium concentration and aminophylline did not affect the positive chronotropic and inotropic responses to the two agents. These findings suggest that ftorafur may induce the positive responses by direct action.", 
    "41": "A simple technique is described for evaluating the effects of drugs on postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation in guinea pig atrial tissue. Raising the voltage of stimulation tenfold (high voltage stimulation, HVS) in the left atrium produced a positive inotropic response. Propranolol abolished this effect but failed to reveal a negative inotropic response. However, in atria obtained from 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) pretreated animals, HVS produced a negative inotropic effect. The magnitude of the response was frequency-dependent and was potentiated by the anticholinesterase dyflos. Tetrodotoxin abolished the response but mecamylamine had no significant effect. Drugs which inhibit cardiac muscarinic receptors caused a parallel shift of the frequency-response relationship. In the right atrium, HVS caused a biphasic inotropic response. Propranolol or 6-OHDA pretreatment inhibited the positive inotropic effect, thereby enhancing the negative inotropic response. The effect did not show as great a dependence on the frequency of stimulation as in the left atrium and was less useful for comparing the effectiveness of muscarinic receptor antagonists.", 
    "42": "Twenty-two patients with chronic, stable, exercise-induced angina pectoris were assessed during periods of therapy with propranolol, standard-formulation pindolol, and a slow-release preparation of pindolol. Patients maintained diaries of the frequency of angina pectoris and nitroglycerin consumption and underwent treadmill exercise testing at 2 weekly intervals. No significant differences were observed in nitroglycerin consumption or anginal frequency during these 3 treatment programs. Resting heart rates were higher with pindolol than with propranolol, but no differences were noted between periods on standard and slow-release pindolol. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were similar during therapy with these 3 treatment programs. Treadmill walking time to the development of moderate angina and systolic and diastolic blood pressure was similar during treatment with propranolol, standard-formulation pindolol, and slow-release pindolol. Exercise heart rates were slightly higher during therapy with slow-release pindolol than during standard-formulation pindolol. It is concluded that propranolol, pindolol, and slow-release pindolol are equally effective in the management of patients with chronic, stable, exercise-induced angina.", 
    "43": "1. Male Wistar rats were either bilaterally adrenalectomized or sham-operated, and given 1% sodium chloride solution instead of tap water to drink. Seven days later, arterial blood pressures were recorded directly from conscious freely moving rats. 2. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly lower in the adrenalectomized rats, whereas heart rates were significantly higher than in sham-operated animals. The tachycardia was due to a combination of sympathetic hyperactivity and reduced vagal tone, which may have been reflex responses to a reduction in effective blood volume. 3. Baroreflex control of the sinus node was assessed from the pulse interval responses to rises (induced by methoxamine) or falls (induced by glyceryl trinitrate or sodium nitroprusside) in systemic arterial blood pressure. The relation between pulse interval and systolic blood pressure was described by the same curve in sham-operated and adrenalectomized rats, indicating that, in the latter, there was no change in baroreflex setting or sensitivity. 4. Intravenous administration of naloxone (2 mg/kg) had no effect on systemic arterial blood pressure in adrenalectomized rats, suggesting that endogenous opiates were not contributing to the hypotension.", 
    "44": "Twenty-nine moderate and severe essential hypertensive patients completed a crossover study aimed at evaluating efficacy and tolerability of a double combination (chlorthalidone plus propranolol) and of a triple combination (chlorthalidone plus oxdralazine plus propranolol). After one month on 25 mg/day chlorthalidone, which caused nonsignificant reduction in blood pressure of 7/4 mm Hg, patients were randomized to receive either the double or triple regimen for a three-month period. Then, after another month on chlorthalidone alone at the same dose of 25 mg/day, treatments were crossed over and the study continued for another three-month period. The double regimen caused a drop in pressure of 16/11 mm Hg after one month (daily doses 25 mg chlorthalidone, 103 +/- 25 mg propranolol), and this reduction did not change at the third month in spite of dosage increases (daily doses 25 mg chlorthalidone, 222 +/- 77 mg propranolol). The triple regimen reduced blood pressure 35/15 mm Hg after one month (daily doses 25 mg chlorthalidone, 20 mg oxdralazine, 40 mg propranolol), and further increase in dosages caused a reduction of 45/24 mm Hg at the third month (daily doses 25 mg chlorthalidone, 56 +/- 20 mg oxdralazine, 112 +/- 40 mg propranolol). Both treatments were well tolerated; in particular, at the end of the third month of each treatment period, 25 patients on the triple regimen achieved a stable diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or less, as compared to 10 patients on the double regimen (P less than 0.01).", 
    "45": "Plasma insulin and glucose concentrations were examined in man in a basal state from central venous samples taken at 1-min intervals for up to 2.5 h. Normal subjects have insulin oscillations of mean period 14 min (significant autocorrelation, p less than 0.0001) with changes in concentration of 40% over 7 min. The pulsation frequency was stable through cholinergic, endorphin, alpha-adrenergic or beta-adrenergic blockade, or small perturbations with glucose or insulin. Stimulation of insulin secretion by intravenous glucose, tolbutamide or sodium salicylate increased the amplitude of the insulin oscillations while the frequency remained stable. Patients with a truncal vagotomy or after Whipple's operation had longer-term oscillations of 33 and 37 min periodicity (autocorrelation: p less than 0.0001), with insulin-associated glucose swings four times larger than those of normal subjects. Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic patients had a similarly increased insulin-associated glucose swing of six times that seen in normal subjects. The hypothesis is proposed that the 14-min cycle of insulin production is controlled by a 'pacemaker' which assists glucose homeostasis. The longer 33-37-min oscillations, seen in those with denervation, may arise from a limit-cycle of the feedback loop between insulin from the B cells and glucose from the liver. The vagus may provide hierarchical control of insulin release.", 
    "46": "The effects of adrenaline and noradrenaline on membrane potential and glucose-induced electrical activity were studied in micro-dissected mouse Islets of Langerhans. Both catecholamines induced hyperpolarization and blocked electrical activity in the presence of 11.1 mM glucose. Phentolamine, but not propranalol, blocked these effects, indicating predominantly alpha receptor action. Quinine, but not tetraethylammonium ions, antagonized the inhibitory effects of the catecholamines. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that alpha receptor activation induces a transient increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration which in turn leads to an increase in K+ permeability.", 
    "47": "An isotope dilution assay has been developed for the determination of both oxprenolol enantiomers in biological samples after administration of the racemic 14C-labelled mixture. The enantiomers were reacted with optically pure S(-)-1-phenylethyl isocyanate and the diastereoisomeric urea derivatives formed were separated by normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Quantitation was performed by on-line ultraviolet detection at 275 nm and off-line radiometry. Endogenous compounds and oxprenolol metabolites did not interfere with the assay. Analysis of water and blood, plasma and urine samples of rats and dogs spiked with [14C]oxprenolol hydrochloride showed mean recoveries for R(+)-oxprenolol hydrochloride of 99.2% (water), 99.3% (blood), 99.1% (plasma) and 97.9% (urine), and for S(-)-oxprenolol hydrochloride of 99.7% (water), 98.1% (blood), 98.6% (plasma) and 96.9% (urine). In a pilot study, the presented method was used to investigate the metabolic fate of the enantiomers in two dogs dosed orally with racemic [14C]oxprenolol hydrochloride (3 mg/kg). The results show that conjugation of R(+)-oxprenolol exceeded that of S(-)-oxprenolol.", 
    "48": "An isotope dilution assay for the specific determination of 14C-labelled oxprenolol and nine of its metabolites in the same biological sample is described. After addition of unlabelled carriers to the sample, oxprenolol and the metabolites were isolated by base- and acid-specific extraction and separated by normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography using two different mobile phases. Quantitation of the various peaks was performed by on-line ultraviolet detection at 275 nm and off-line radiometry by liquid scintillation counting. Endogenous compounds and unknown metabolites did not interfere in the assay. The analysis of rat and dog blood, plasma and urine samples spiked with [14C]oxprenolol hydrochloride, showed mean recoveries between 98.7 and 99.8%. The assay was used to investigate the metabolic fate of [14C]oxprenolol in the dog. Analyses of blood and urine demonstrated the quantitative significance of the various metabolites in the biotransformation of oxprenolol.", 
    "49": "We have studied the effects of four doses of atenolol in 11 patients with stable angina pectoris using a symptom-limited exercise test and angina diaries. The doses 100 mg twice daily and 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg once daily were given double-blind and randomised within patients following run-in on placebo. Measurements were made 12 hours after the last twice daily dose and 24 hours after the last once daily dose. Exercise tolerance was improved by 40-74% and exercise duration before the onset of angina by 61-94% (P less than 0.01). Maximal heart rate was reduced further by a total daily dose of 200 mg than by lower doses, but no extra benefit was derived by giving the drug twice daily. The largest increase in exercise tolerance was obtained during treatment with 50 mg once daily. Atenolol was shown to be an effective anti-anginal agent when given once daily, and there were no major differences between the doses studied.", 
    "50": "When internists are consulted to assess risks and to aid in the perioperative management of surgical patients, they often can rely on substantial clinical data to guide the consultation. Perioperative cardiac risk can be estimated based on the severity of underlying heart failure, the occurrence of a recent myocardial infarction or various arrhythmias, the presence of aortic stenosis, the patient's age, the type of planned surgery (including whether it is an emergency or elective procedure), and the patient's general medical condition. Preoperative exercise testing or cardiac catheterization to assess risk are not routinely indicated, but perioperative hemodynamic monitoring to improve management is recommended in patients at high risk. Postoperative hypertension, arrhythmias, and heart failure commonly occur in the first 2 days after surgery, but the risk of myocardial infarction persists for at least 5 or 6 days after surgery. Effective perioperative consultation must include careful postoperative observation to detect cardiac complications at an early stage and to assist in their management.", 
    "51": "The effects of cold exposure on tissue sensitivity and responsiveness to insulin were determined by the euglycemic insulin clamp technique. Insulin was infused at rates of 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 6.0, and 30.0 mU x kg-1 x min-1 into five adult sheep in a warm environment and after cold exposure (0 degree C) from 7 to 23 days. Cold exposure increased basal plasma glucose concentration and basal glucose irreversible loss. Glucose metabolic clearance rate (MCR) was significantly increased by cold exposure at all rates of insulin infusion, with increases ranging from 44 to 72%. The insulin concentration causing half-maximal stimulation of glucose MCR was unchanged by environment (warm, 42 microU/ml; cold, 36 microU/ml). Combined alpha + beta-adrenergic blockade did not affect the increased response to insulin during cold exposure. Endogenous (hepatic) glucose production was inhibited by insulin to a similar extent in the two environments and was less sensitive to insulin than was glucose utilization or MCR. The results suggest that cold exposure increases the responsiveness to insulin of a postreceptor event in peripheral tissues.", 
    "52": "Eighty-six hypertensive patients were treated with pindolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking drug with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. To evaluate the interactions between beta-blockade, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and the level of pretreatment sympathetic activity, blood pressure, heart rate, and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) were examined before and during a 15-week treatment program. The response of patients with a relatively higher pretreatment sympathetic tone reflected by a resting heart rate equal to or greater than 80 beats per minute (Group I) was compared with the response of patients with a lower pretreatment heart rate (less than 80 beats per minute) (Group II). Decreases in mean blood pressure were similar in the two groups. In patients in Group I, the net effect of pindolol was a modest decrease in heart rate and FEV1, supporting the concept that when sympathetic tone is relatively high, the beta-blocking effect is dominant. In contrast, patients in Group II showed little change in heart rate or FEV1 during pindolol treatment, reflecting a balance between the intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and beta-blocking effects of pindolol. Thus, the intrinsic sympathomimetic activity of pindolol is physiologically evident, and relative impact is dependent on the pretreatment level of sympathetic tone.", 
    "53": "An area where the sinus node was located in 36 dogs was defined as the \"SN-area.\" Five to 7 days after cauterization of the SN-area, a subsidiary pacemaker remained in the SN-area in seven (group S) and shifted to outside the SN-area in 14 dogs (group E). The SN-area in group S had escaped complete destruction, but that in group E was destroyed completely. Heart rate in group S and group E was 154.0 +/- 27.1 and 107.6 +/- 16.8 beats/min (p less than 0.001), respectively. Maximum duration of asystole after overdrive (maxDAO) in group S and group E was 656.7 +/- 260.2 and 2470.2 +/- 2271.6 msec (p less than 0.01), respectively. Propranolol (0.2 mg/kg intravenously) decreased heart rate in group S and group E to 88.3 +/- 7.9 and 71.7 +/- 8.7% (p less than 0.001), and prolonged maxDAO to 140.1 +/- 28.1 and 492.7 +/- 591.4% (p less than 0.025), respectively. It is concluded that the rate and stability of subsidiary pacemakers after cauterization of the sinus node have a close relationship with their location in the right atrium, which is dependent on the extent of lesions in the SN-area. Sympathetic tone played a significant role in maintaining these functions in group E.", 
    "54": "Daily carbohydrate intake of seven men with normal weight was limited to 220-265 g/d for 6 d and then increased to 620-770 g/d for 20 d, while intake of protein, fat, and sodium remained constant. Carbohydrate overfeeding increased body weight by 4.8%, basal oxygen consumption (VO2) by 7.4%, BMR by 11.5%, and serum triiodothyronine levels by 32%. Overfeeding did not affect the thermic effect of a standard meal. Intravenous propranolol reduced the thermic effect of a meal by 22% during the base-line feeding period, and by 13% during carbohydrate overfeeding, but did not affect preprandial VO2. Overfeeding attenuated the rise in plasma glucose and FFA levels induced by infusion of norepinephrine, but had no effect on the increase in VO2 induced by norepinephrine. Overfeeding did not alter 24-h urinary excretion of vanillylmandelic acid, supine plasma catecholamine levels (pre- and postprandial), blood pressure, or plasma renin activity, but increased peak standing plasma norepinephrine levels by 45% and resting pulse rate by 9%. Even though short-term carbohydrate overfeeding may produce modest stimulation of sympathetic nervous system activity in man, the increase in thermogenesis induced by such overfeeding is neither suppressed by beta adrenergic blockade nor accompanied by an increased sensitivity to the thermogenic effects of norepinephrine. These data do not support an important role for the sympathetic nervous system in mediating the thermogenic response to carbohydrate overfeeding.", 
    "55": "A pilot study on 10 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed glaucoma and a randomised double-blind study on 18 patients with glaucoma were carried out to investigate the effect of pindolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, on the intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with glaucoma. The studies showed that pindolol may reduce the IOP and that no significant difference between the effect of timolol 0.5% and of pindolol 0.25% could be demonstrated. The serum concentration of pindolol was measured in 9 of the patients, but none had measurable serum levels.", 
    "56": "The results of a 12-month blind randomised trial comparing the intraocular pressure lowering effect of timolol 0.25% with timolol 0.5% are presented. 27% of patients (22% of eyes) required additional antiglaucoma medication after a minimum time interval of 6 months to maintain an intraocular pressure less than 23 mmHg. The mean reduction in intraocular pressure (from pretreatment values) at 12 months was 24% for eyes treated with timolol 0.25% and 19% for eyes treated with timolol 0.5%. When reductions in intraocular pressure at each follow-up interval were statistically significant (timolol 0.25% treated eyes compared with timolol 0.5% treated eyes), the significance always favoured timolol 0.25%.", 
    "57": "Patients receiving metoprolol before cardiac revascularization surgery were randomly divided into those in whom metoprolol was discontinued before the operation (N = 10) and those in whom metoprolol was continued up to the time of operation (N = 10). Cardiovascular responses to neuroleptanesthesia and sternotomy were studied. Coronary sinus catheterization for blood-flow measurement and sampling was performed in 5 patients in each group. Two of 10 patients had a myocardial infarction after discontinuation of metoprolol and surgery was therefore postponed. Tachycardias were common during intubation after discontinuation of metoprolol, but otherwise hemodynamic responses and myocardial oxygen consumption were similar in both groups. Recurrent ST-T depression occurred in 7 of 8 patients and myocardial lactate release in 2 of 5 patients in whom metoprolol was withdrawn, whereas patients who continued to receive metoprolol showed few episodes of ST-T depression (2 of 10) and no lactate release. The latter had lower plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels, but myocardial release of NE was similar in both groups. Preoperative metoprolol withdrawal seemed to precipitate myocardial ischemia, whereas maintenance of therapy was well tolerated.", 
    "58": "The aminothiol WR-2721 and beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol both conferred considerable radioprotection to the rat parotid gland. Isoproterenol acts on the beta-receptor, and its specific antagonist, propranolol, eliminated isoproterenol's protective effect, implicating the beta-receptor and possibly cAMP in the mechanism of the protection. Since other sulfhydryl-containing protectants have been shown to elevate cAMP it was reasoned that WR-2721 might do so as well. However, the radioprotection conferred by WR-2721 was not reduced by propranolol, showing that the beta-receptor played no part in WR-2721's action. The possible role of cAMP in radioprotection by isoproterenol is discussed.", 
    "59": "The action of beta-adrenergic agonists on pulmonary surfactant secretion requires lung cell membrane beta-adrenergic receptors. In the fetus, the density of beta-adrenergic receptors in lung increases in the latter stages of gestation. The increase in density can also be induced by maternal glucocorticoid treatment. In this study, we measured beta-adrenergic receptors in developing rat lung by (-) [3H]-dehydroalprenalol (DHA) binding and confirmed the increase in beta-adrenergic receptors late in gestation. To determine if glucocorticoids have a direct effect on fetal lung to regulate beta-adrenergic receptors, we cultured fetal lung explants with dexamethasone. Treated explants had increased DHA binding compared with controls (138.0 +/- 8.8 versus 63.2 +/- 5.0 fmole/mg membrane protein). Scatchard analysis revealed that the increased DHA binding was due to an increase in maximum receptor number. There was also a significant difference in the dissociation constant of the treated and control explants (0.85 +/- 0.07 nM versus 0.43 +/- 0.08 nM, respectively; P less than 0.05), suggesting that the receptors induced by dexamethasone were of lower binding affinity. Cyclohexamide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, completely eliminated the dexamethasone induced increase in DHA binding. These data indicate that glucocorticoids have a direct effect on fetal lung to increase beta-adrenergic receptor density and that new protein synthesis is required for this effect.", 
    "60": "Following direct administration of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), but not thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) or vehicle solution, into the lateral cerebral ventricle in rats, three main categories of behaviour were provoked: activity of the normal type--stimulation of forward locomotion, head and body rearing (as shown by an enhancement in gross movements); stereotyped activity--increased grooming and head swaying (as shown by an enhancement in fine movements); abnormal behaviour--tail elevation and piloerection (as observed grossly). The behavioural excitation caused by TRH was antagonized by pretreatment of the rats with either a narcotic receptor antagonist, naloxone, an alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonists, yohimbine, or a dopaminergic receptor antagonist, haloperidol, but not with a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, propranolol. Intraventricular administration of amphetamine to rats caused stimulation of forward locomotion, head and body rearing, increased grooming and sniffing. Unlike TRH, amphetamine did not produce wet-dog shakes, tail elevation and piloerection. Furthermore, the amphetamine-induced excitation was antagonized by pretreatment with a dopaminergic receptor antagonist, haloperidol, but not with either naloxone, yohimbine or propranolol. The data indicate that both opiate and catecholaminergic receptors are involved in the TRH-induced behavioural excitation, whereas dopaminergic receptors are involved in amphetamine-induced excitement in the rat.", 
    "61": "Adrenergic control of human fat cell lipolysis is mediated by two kinds of receptor sites that are simultaneously stimulated by physiological amines. To establish a correlation between the binding characteristics of the receptor and biological functions, the ability of physiological amines to stimulate or inhibit isolated fat cell lipolysis in vitro was compared to the beta- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor properties of the same fat cell batch. The beta-selective antagonist (-)[3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA) and the alpha 2-selective antagonists [3H]yohimbine ([3H]YOH) and [3H]rauwolscine ([3H]RAU) were used to identify and characterize the two receptor sites. Binding of each ligand was rapid, saturable, and specific. The results demonstrate 1) the weaker lipolytic effect of epinephrine compared with norepinephrine. This can be explained by the equipotency of the amines at the beta 1-sites and the higher affinity of epinephrine for alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. 2) The preponderance of alpha 2-adrenergic receptor sites labeled by [3H]YOH (Bmax, 586 +/- 95 fmol/mg protein; KD, 2.7 +/- 0.2 nM) or [3H]RAU (Bmax, 580 +/- 100 fmol/mg protein; KD, 3.7 +/- 0.1 nM). These two ligands can be successfully used to label alpha 2-adrenergic receptor sites. 3) The beta 1-adrenergic receptor population labeled by [3H]DHA(Bmax, 234 +/- 37 fmol/mg protein; KD, 1.8 +/- 0.4 nM), although a third as numerous as the alpha 2-adrenergic population, is responsible for the lipolytic effect of physiological amines and is weakly counteracted by simultaneous alpha 2-adrenergic receptor stimulation under our experimental conditions. It is concluded that, in human fat cells, the characterization of beta 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors by saturation studies or kinetic analysis to determine affinity (KD) and maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) is not sufficient for an accurate characterization of the functional adrenergic receptors involved in the observed biological effect.", 
    "62": "We have determined maximum binding capacities for beta-adrenergic binding sites in developing cat visual cortex. These increase quickly from birth to 4 weeks, after which time a slower increase reaches maximal levels at 12 weeks. Dark-rearing and monocular eyelid suture have no influence on this developmental profile.", 
    "63": "The development of calmodulin, calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase and beta-adrenergic receptors was studied in the rat brain. Membrane-bound calmodulin detected was approximately 40-50% of the total calmodulin throughout the postnatal development of either in the cerebrum or cerebellum. No significant difference was found between the quantitative patterns of the membrane-bound and cytosolic calmodulin during the entire period of postnatal development in either of these tissues. Both the cytosolic and membrane-bound calmodulin were present in low concentrations in the immature brain after birth. Their contents rapidly increased during the second postnatal week. Subsequently, the cytosolic calmodulin content remained constant, but showed a considerable decrease in the particulate fraction after day 14. Basal adenylate cyclase activity in the rat cerebrum slowly increased up to the second postnatal week and decreased after day 14. The responsiveness to calmodulin of this enzyme remained unaltered during postnatal development, whereas fluoride and guanine nucleotide sensitivities increased in the same period. The maximum number of (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol binding site sharply increased during day 9-14 in the rat cerebrum, although the dissociation constant Kd of the binding site was not affected by age. The results in the latter study suggest that calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase may be already present in the earlier postnatal ages of the rat brain, while the beta-adrenergic receptor and guanine nucleotide regulatory unit, both of which are required for a hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclase, may sharply increase in the second postnatal week.", 
    "64": "Exposure of rats to 25 min anoxia within 24 h following birth caused behavioural as well as biochemical changes during their development and maturity. Following postnatal anoxia, a significant increase in the concentration of the cholinergic muscarinic receptors in the hippocampus was noted at the early stages of development, between 6 and 20 days of age, but reached normal values at 40 days of age. However, at this age, significant increase in the concentration of beta-adrenergic receptors in the hippocampus was found, which remained significantly high during maturity and adulthood, as compared to controls. Rats submitted postnatally to anoxia exhibited hyperactivity in the open field which was maximal at 20-25 days of age and declined towards normal values at 40 days of age. At maturity, between 60 and 80 days of age, these rats showed poor performance in a complex 6-choice discrimination learning but not in simple differential conditioning. Possible correlations between the behavioural and biochemical findings are discussed.", 
    "65": "1 The effect of prolonged, excessive thyroxine on beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation of guinea-pig trachea was studied. 2 Thyroxine did not significantly affect the potency of the beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist, noradrenaline, or the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, terbutaline. 3 Thyroxine did not significantly affect the apparent KB values of the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, practolol, or the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, butoxamine. 4 Thyroxine did not significantly affect the maximum response to noradrenaline. The maximum response to terbutaline in tissues from the thyroxine-treated animals was only slightly lower than the maximum response in tissues from paired control animals. 5 These results suggest that excessive thyroxine does not significantly affect the beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation of guinea-pig trachea and that the reported modulation of beta-adrenoceptor-mediated responses in other tissues is specific for the given tissue rather than common to all beta-adrenoceptor systems.", 
    "66": "A study was performed to determine whether a constant 1-week exposure to either alpha or beta agonists in vivo would allow alteration or manipulation of the responses of rat aortic alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors. Osmotic minipumps delivering either phenylephrine, isoproterenol, or propranolol for 7 days at a dose of 3.2, 4.2, or 5.2 mg/kg/day, respectively, were implanted in male Holtzman rats under halothane anesthesia. Seven days later, rats were killed and aortic ring preparations were used to measure alpha- and beta-adrenergic responses. In phenylephrine-pretreated rats, alpha-adrenergic responses, as measured by contractions induced by phenylephrine, were markedly reduced (P less than 0.05) across a dose range of 10(-9) to 10(-6) M. In contrast, in these same phenylephrine-pretreated preparations, the beta-adrenergic responses involving isoproterenol-induced relaxation were significantly increased (P less than 0.05) across a dose range of 10(-7) to 10(-5) M. Isoproterenol pretreatment for 7 days resulted in a statistically significant reduction of beta-adrenergic aortic relaxation, whereas the alpha-adrenergic responses to phenylephrine remained unchanged compared with controls. Propranolol pretreatment had no effect on either alpha- or beta-adrenergic responses. These findings indicate that the alpha agonist-induced response after in vivo pretreatment induces reciprocal changes in the functionally related beta-adrenergic apparatus, and also suggest linkage between these two receptors. In contrast, the beta response appears to desensitize or downregulate in response to beta agonist exposure in a manner that seems to be independent of or to operate in the absence of an alteration of the alpha response.", 
    "67": "Anesthetized dogs with isolated carotid sinus preparation were used to examine the mechanisms involved in the increase in renin secretion rate produced by carotid baroreceptor reflex renal nerve stimulation (RNS) at constant renal perfusion pressure. Lowering carotid sinus pressure by 41 +/- 5 mmHg for 10 min increased mean arterial pressure and heart rate, caused no or minimal renal hemodynamic changes, decreased urinary sodium excretion, and increased renin secretion rate. Metoprolol, a beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, given in the renal artery, did not affect the decrease in urinary sodium excretion but attenuated the increase in renin secretion rate, from 1,764 +/- 525 to 412 +/- 126 ng/min (70 +/- 8%). Indomethacin or meclofenamate, prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors, did not affect the decrease in urinary sodium excretion but attenuated the increase in renin secretion rate, from 1,523 +/- 416 to 866 +/- 413 ng/min (51 +/- 18%). Addition of metoprolol to indomethacin-pretreated dogs attenuated the increase in renin secretion rate from 833 +/- 327 to 94 +/- 60 ng/min (86 +/- 10%). These results indicate that reflex RNS at constant renal perfusion pressure results in an increase in renin secretion rate that is largely mediated by renal beta 1-adrenoceptors and is partly dependent on intact renal prostaglandin synthesis. The beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated increase in renin secretion rate is independent of and not in series with renal prostaglandins.", 
    "68": "AtT-20 cells comprise a mouse anterior pituitary tumor cell line that synthesizes and secretes adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH). beta-Adrenergic receptors were characterized on AtT-20 cells using receptor binding methodology and the ability of beta-receptor agonists to stimulate intracellular cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) formation and the release of ACTH immunoreactivity. The density of beta-receptors on membrane preparations of these cells is 64 fmol/mg of protein and their affinity constant (KD value) for tritiated dihydroalprenolol is 11 nM. The binding of [3H] dihydroalprenolol to AtT-20 cells is stereoselectively inhibited by propranolol and isoproterenol but is not affected by phentolamine. The beta-receptors on these cells appear to be of the beta 2-receptor subtype since a selective beta 2-receptor agonist, salmefamol, can inhibit [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding, whereas practolol, a beta 1-receptor blocker, is ineffective. (-)-Isoproterenol stimulates cAMP formation in AtT-20 cells and this effect is blocked by dl-propranolol. Both l-epinephrine and l-norepinephrine induce dose-dependent increases in cAMP formation with the former agonist being more potent. Salmefamol also stimulates cAMP formation in these cells. The secretion of ACTH from AtT-20 cells is induced by (-)-isoproterenol as well as by other adrenergic agonists. The isoproterenol effect on ACTH release is stereoselective, calcium dependent, and blocked by dl-propranolol but not by phentolamine or practolol.", 
    "69": "We compared the effects of single doses of 50 mg atenolol (cardioselective), 40 mg propranolol (nonselective), and placebo on both exercise- and isoproterenol-induced tachycardia in two experiments involving nine normal subjects. Maximal exercise heart rate was reduced from 187 +/- 4(SEM) after placebo to 146 +/- 7 bpm after atenolol and 138 +/- 6 bpm after propranolol, but there were no differences between the drugs. The effects on isoproterenol tachycardia were determined before and after atropine (0.04 mg/kg IV). Isoproterenol sensitivity was determined as the intravenous dose that increased heart rate by 25 bpm (CD25) and this was increased from 1.8 +/- 0.3 micrograms after placebo to 38.9 +/- 8.3 micrograms after propranolol and 8.3 +/- 1.7 micrograms after atenolol. The difference in the effects of the two was significant. After atropine the CD25 was unchanged after placebo (2.3 +/- 0.3 micrograms) and atenolol (7.7 +/- 1.3 micrograms); it was reduced after propranolol (24.8 +/- 5.0 micrograms), but remained different from atenolol. This change with propranolol sensitivity was calculated as the apparent Ka, this was unchanged by atropine (11.7 +/- 2.1 and 10.1 +/- 2.5 ml/ng). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that exercise-induced tachycardia results largely from beta 1-receptor activation that is blocked by both cardioselective and nonselective drugs, whereas isoproterenol activates both beta 1- and beta 2-receptors so that after cardioselective blockade there remains a beta 2-component that can be blocked with a nonselective drug. While there appear to be beta 2-receptors in the human heart, their physiologic or pathologic roles remain to be defined.", 
    "70": "Although the positive inotropic effect of cardiac glycosides correlates well with inhibition of Na+ pump activity in many preparations, digitalis at low concentrations (10(-9) to 10(-8) M) may produce an apparent stimulation of monovalent cation transport in isolated intact myocardium or produce an inotropic effect that does not correlate with pump inhibition. Digitalis is known to modify tissue metabolism of endogenous neurotransmitters that may affect inotropic state, Na,K-ATPase activity, and K+ permeability. We examined the interactions of low concentrations of ouabain with adrenergic and cholinergic influences in isolated guinea pig left atria stimulated at 3.3 Hz in which inotropic state and monovalent cation transport (measured as 86Rb+ uptake) were assessed simultaneously. Ouabain (10(-9) M) stimulated Rb+ transport (+25%) without an inotropic response; the stimulatory effect on transport was abolished by propranolol or atropine pretreatment. In atria pretreated with atropine, 10(-8) M ouabain produced a small positive inotropic effect (+10%) without measurable associated Na+-K+ pump inhibition. This inotropic response was abolished in catecholamine-depleted atria. Ouabain (10(-7) M) always produced a positive inotropic response (about +25%) independent of catecholamine depletion, beta-adrenergic blockade, or muscarinic blockade, but Rb+ uptake inhibition was observed only in beta-adrenergically-blocked atria. In all preparations, ouabain concentrations greater than 10(-7) M caused an inotropic response associated with pump inhibition. At concentrations 3 X 10(-7) M and higher, mechanical toxicity was observed in all preparations except those pretreated with propranolol. Incubation with low concentrations of ouabain did not modify the inotropic response to isoproterenol. At concentrations of isoproterenol sufficient to stimulate Rb+ transport by 25%, there was a large (+80%) inotropic response. We conclude first, that, in guinea pig atria exposed to ouabain, the mechanism as well as the extent of inotropic response and of monovalent cation transport modification is concentration dependent, second, that at low concentrations (1-10 X 10(-9) M), in vitro inotropic and monovalent cation transport responses are in part mediated by an effect of ouabain on endogenous neurotransmitters; and third, that in this preparation at concentrations between 10(-9) and 10(-7) M ouabain, monovalent cation transport as measured by tissue 86Rb+ uptake does not correlate with inotropic response.", 
    "71": "The present paper reports on the changes occurring in the juxtaglomerular apparatus during preservation of the rat kidney by cold storage, using two media: Sacks and Plasmagel, to which a membrane stabilizing \"cocktail\" was added (hydrocortisone, chlorpromazine, epsilonaminocaproic acid - EACA, propranolol). Evident alterations appeared at 48 hours more accentuated at 72 and 96 hours, and more intense when preserved in Plasmagel. The most affected structure in the juxtaglomerular apparatus was the macula densa, the epithelial cells having a more stable structure.", 
    "72": "In acute experiments on cats, the increase of capillary filtration coefficient and venous distensibility in small intestine was revealed after 3-5, 14-16 and 29-31 days of high altitude adaptation (The Pamirs, 3370 m above sea level), the changes being more obvious (by 78% and 45%, resp.) after 3-5 days in comparison with low altitude control. The effects of noradrenaline on the small intestine precapillary sphincters and venous distensibility were preserved at high altitude, whereas regional blockade of alpha- or beta-adrenoreceptors exerted no effect on the results. The increased capillary filtration coefficient seems to be of great importance in \"struggle for oxygen\" at high altitude hypoxia, and this obviously depends on the opening of preexisting capillaries.", 
    "73": "Fat cells from epididymal adipose tissue from normal and streptozotocin-diabetic rats were studied to determine glucose utilization and cyclic nucleotide levels. Diabetic rat fat cells present a higher cAMP content (P less than 0.05) compared with controls. Addition of insulin decreases within 10-min incubation the cAMP content in both normal and diabetic cells (P less than 0.05). However, the value obtained in the latter remains by 25% higher than that of normal cells not exposed to insulin. No changes in cGMP were detected. Pretreatment of the diabetic animals during two days with propranolol (1 mg kg body wt-1 day-1) induces the decrease to normal levels of the fat cell cAMP content. However, it persists the impairment on glucose utilization observed in fat cells from diabetic animals. It seems that the increase in the intracellular amount of cAMP found in fat cells from diabetic rats is not involved, at least directly, to the impaired glucose utilization found in the diabetic state. Furthermore, through an unknown mechanism, pretreatment with propranolol can induce a drop in fat tissue cAMP toward normal values without normalizing glucose utilization.", 
    "74": "1 Three drugs have been tested for activity against antigen-induced histamine release from passively sensitized human lung fragments after increasing periods of pre-incubation before challenge.2 After 30 s pre-incubation, sodium cromoglycate inhibited histamine release in the concentration range 0.2-200 muM, producing a maximum inhibition of 33.0%. As the pretreatment period was extended, tolerance developed in a dose-related manner, resulting in a 48.3% and 82.8% loss of activity of the 200 muM dose after 60 min and 19 h pre-incubation, respectively. Tolerance was independent of extracellular calcium and was poorly reversible. Lung tissue desensitized to cromoglycate was cross-tolerant to the related drug, bufrolin, but not to salbutamol or chlorpromazine.3 In acute studies, salbutamol (0.03-3.0 muM) produced dose-related inhibition of histamine release, with a maximum inhibition of 72.2%. The effect was blocked stereoselectively by 1 muM propranolol, suggesting that it occurred through an interaction with lung beta-adrenoceptors. Increasing the pre-incubation time with salbutamol from 30 s to 19 h did not produce tolerance. Inhibition produced by incubation with salbutamol for 19 h was totally prevented when propranolol was added at the beginning of the pre-incubation period, indicating that it resulted from stimulation of beta-receptors and not from a non-specific or toxic effect. However, studies of reversibility of effect through washing or late addition of propranolol did indicate some change in the nature of salbutamol inhibition with time.4 Chlorpromazine was a weak inhibitor of immunological histamine release. A 100 muM concentration was ineffective after 30 s pre-incubation but its activity increased with time. Pre-incubation of lung fragments with this concentration for 1 h or longer, or with a 1 mM dose for a shorter period, provoked histamine release in the absence of antigen. Effects of chlorpromazine were not reversed by washing.5 The different characteristics shown by sodium cromoglycate, salbutamol and chlorpromazine indicate that these drugs inhibit histamine release by interfering with the secretory mechanisms in different ways.", 
    "75": "Beta-adrenoceptor mechanisms were studied in the isolated guinea-pig taenia caecum. Isoprenaline, desisopropylprocaterol and carteolol relaxed guinea-pig taenia caecum, and their intrinsic activities (mean +/- S.E.) were 1.0, 0.95 +/- 0.03 and 0.61 +/- 0.08, respectively. The pD2 values (mean +/- S.E.) were 8.59 +/- 0.06 for isoprenaline, 7.94 +/- 0.21 for desisopropylprocaterol and 6.35 +/- 0.14 for carteolol. The beta-adrenoceptors in guinea-pig taenia caecum were irreversibly inactivated by photoaffinity labeling with isoprenaline (6 X 10(-6) M). Photoinactivation of beta-adrenoceptors caused a considerable parallel shift in the dose-response curve of isoprenaline. The decline of the dose-response curves of desisopropylprocaterol and carteolol without a preceding shift was observed after photoinactivation. Isoprenaline, desisopropylprocaterol and carteolol increased cyclic AMP levels in guinea-pig taenia caecum, and the pD2 values were 7.43, 6.97 and 5.96, respectively. When differences between the pD2 values for test drugs obtained from the mechanical responses and from the increases of cyclic AMP levels were calculated, the differences for isoprenaline was larger than those for desisopropylprocaterol and carteolol. The dose-response curves for relaxation and cyclic AMP level by isoprenaline were both shifted to the right as a result of prior incubation with carteolol. These results suggest that there are spare receptors for isoprenaline, but few for desisopropylprocaterol and carteolol in the smooth muscle."
