    "0": "During the course of equilibrium competition binding assays with intact cells, agonists induce conversion of beta-adrenergic receptors (BARs) from a native form with high affinity for agonists to a form with a markedly lower apparent affinity. The roles of receptor internalization, receptor-Gs coupling, and receptor phosphorylation in this agonist-induced conversion to the low affinity form were investigated. Agonist and antagonist competition for [125I]iodopindolol binding to intact cells was measured in mouse L cells expressing wild-type BARs (C+I+), mutated BARs that do not couple to Gs but do internalize (C-I+), and mutated BARs that do not couple to Gs and do not internalize (C-I-). For C+I+ and C-I+ cells, most of the receptors exhibited apparent affinities for the agonist isoproterenol that were 500-900-fold lower in equilibrium assays with intact cells than in short-time assays with intact cells or in equilibrium assays with isolated membranes, similar to previous results with cells expressing native BARs. The extent of conversion to this lower affinity form for C-I- cells was markedly decreased. Binding properties for the antagonist metoprolol were similar for all three BARs in both short-time and equilibrium assays. Isoproterenol competition in short-time and equilibrium assays also was compared in Chinese hamster fibroblasts expressing wild-type BARs, mutated BARs that lack BAR kinase sites, mutated BARs that lack cAMP-dependent protein kinase sites, and mutated BARs that lack both types of phosphorylation sites. All three BAR phosphorylation mutants showed only small but significant decreases, relative to the wild-type BAR, in the extent of conversion to the low affinity form. These results provide additional evidence that receptor internalization is the major determinant for the conversion of intact cell BARs to the low affinity form. Receptor phosphorylation may play a minor role in conversion to the low affinity form, whereas receptor coupling to Gs is apparently not required.", 
    "1": "To define the roles of beta- and alpha-adrenergic receptors in intense exercise, 17 lean healthy fit young males underwent 13.6 +/- 0.2 (+/-SE) min of cycle ergometer exercise: 6 at 100% maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max; MAX), 7 at their maximum possible (87 +/- 2.3%) during iv propranolol (P; 150 micrograms/kg bolus 30 min preexercise, then 80 micrograms/kg.min), and 7 (including 3 of the P subjects) at 87% VO2max (C) as controls for P. Plasma glucose increased from similar resting values to a peak in the early recovery period at 7.2 +/- 0.44 in MAX and 6.8 +/- 0.37 in P, but only 5.2 +/- 0.3 mmol/L in C. The rate of glucose appearance (Ra) rose about 8-fold in both MAX and P, but only 4-fold in C (P = 0.001). The rate of glucose disappearance (Rd) increased 4-fold in MAX, 5.5-fold in P, and 3-fold in C (P = 0.001). Plasma insulin declined during exercise (P < 0.05) in MAX and P, but not in C, whereas plasma glucagon increased modestly in all groups. The mean peak plasma norepinephrine level was 36.3 +/- 4.5 in MAX, 20.2 +/- 3.4 in P, and 15.2 +/- 2.9 nmol/L in C (P = 0.002); epinephrine reached 7141 +/- 1790 in MAX and 5605 +/- 1532 in P (P = NS), but only 1715 +/- 344 pmol/L in C (P = 0.03). Therefore, 1) an \"unmasked\" alpha-adrenergic effect, directly and/or via an altered glucagon/insulin ratio, probably contributed to increased Ra with P treatment; and 2) the marked facilitation of the increase in Rd with P supports a major role for beta-adrenergic restraint of Rd at this exercise intensity.", 
    "2": "We examined epinephrine- and isoproterenol-stimulated DNA synthesis in primary cultured hepatocytes from 6-, 12-, and 24-month-old rats. Epinephrine-stimulated DNA synthesis in 6-month-old rat hepatocytes began after 20 h and reached a maximum at 50 h. Similarly, isoproterenol-stimulated DNA synthesis in 6-month-old rat hepatocytes began after 10 h and reached a maximum at 45 h. In contrast, both epinephrine- and isoproterenol-stimulated DNA synthesis in 12- and 24-month-old rat hepatocytes were reduced approximately 40-60% and 80%, respectively, as compared to that at 6 months. Both epinephrine- and isoproterenol-stimulated DNA synthesis were strongly inhibited by the beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol, but not by the alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist, prazosin, or the alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist, yohimbine. However, in the presence of EGF, epinephrine-stimulated DNA synthesis activity was inhibited by prazosin but not by propranolol. These results indicate that stimulated DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes declines with age and that there are two different pathways for epinephrine-stimulated DNA synthesis in the presence or absence of EGF.", 
    "3": "Circulatory collapse and obtundation occurred in a 37-year-old woman following an iatrogenic overdose of labetalol. Conventional therapy with glucagon and alpha-adrenergic receptor-stimulating agents was ineffective in raising the patient's cardiac output or improving her mental status despite increasing the arterial pressure. The administration of amrinone was temporally associated with significant increases in the cardiac output accompanied by improved mental status. This case suggests that amrinone may be effective adjunctive therapy for beta-adrenergic receptor blocker overdoses by reversing their negative inotropic effects.", 
    "4": "A transgenic mouse carrying a simian virus-40 T-antigen gene under control of a mouse urinary protein promoter induced the formation of a brown fat tumor. In tissue culture, these tumor cells expressed the brown fat-specific mitochondrial uncoupling protein (Ucp) gene when stimulated by norepinephrine. To develop cell lines for the analysis of Ucp expression, we investigated growth conditions that would maintain expression. We found that the addition of 10(-7)-10(-6) M norepinephrine was critical for establishing cells with high Ucp expression, mitochondrial content, and adipogenesis. Norepinephrine exerts its effects by selectively stimulating the proliferation of brown fat cells. Results with receptor-specific agonists and antagonists indicate that norepinephrine interacts with the beta 1-adrenergic receptor to stimulate cell proliferation. The capacity of these brown fat cells to respond to norepinephrine by proliferating seems to be a manifestation of a normal physiological response of brown fat cells, because exposing an animal to the cold increases cell proliferation. Thus, this system indicates that two independent pathways for cell proliferation coexist in parallel, one based on transformation of the cell by the simian virus-40 T-antigen and the other on the normal response of the cell to stimulation by norepinephrine. Several clonal lines have been isolated that have similar levels of marker gene expression for adipogenesis and mitochondriogenesis, but differ in the level of Ucp expression. The results underscore the extreme sensitivity of mechanisms controlling Ucp expression and the fact that the expression of Ucp in brown fat is not coordinately linked to that of other nuclear genes which encode proteins associated with thermogenesis.",

However, its clinical application in Chinese patients has not yet been reported.",

    "8": "With the dosing regimen recommended in western published reports (repeated loading infusion with stepwise increment), acute hypotension with systolic pressure < 80 mm Hg occurred in all six patients after 1 min of loading infusion of esmolol (500 micrograms/kg body weight per min). To avoid the aforementioned complications, a new dosing regimen was constructed. The initial infusion rate of esmolol was set at 150 or 100 micrograms/kg per min, depending on the patient's age and blood pressure. When the desired heart rate was achieved, the initial infusion rate was reduced to the maintenance infusion rate to maintain the therapeutic effect [Maintenance infusion rate = Initial infusion rate x (1 - e-0.077t), where t is the time period in minutes required by the initial infusion of esmolol to achieve the therapeutic effect]. With this new dosing regimen, tachycardia in most patients (9 of 11) could be controlled within 10 min, and no one experienced the side effect of hypotension. The maintenance infusion rate of esmolol needed to control supraventricular tachyarrhythmia in our patients was only 73 +/- 42 micrograms/kg per min (mean +/- SD), much less than that noted in western reports.",

They were present in 33 (62%) of 53 patients with the long QT syndrome and in 8 (15%) of 53 control subjects (p < 0.001). Moreover, among patients with the long QT syndrome they were much more frequent in symptomatic (history of syncope or cardiac arrest) than in asymptomatic subjects (30 [81%] of 37 vs. 3 [19%] of 16, p < 0.001). The same distribution was observed within families with the long QT syndrome, in which symptomatic members had more pronounced T wave abnormalities than did their asymptomatic siblings or parents. In symptomatic patients, the occurrence of T wave abnormalities was independent of the length of repolarization (corrected QT). These T wave abnormalities were associated with the presence of a specific pattern of abnormal left ventricular wall motion.",

    "15": "Four non-selective 5-HT2C/5-HT2A receptor antagonists, mianserin (2-8 mg/kg), 1-naphthyl piperazine (1-NP) (0.5-1 mg/kg), ICI 169,369 (20 mg/kg) and LY 53857 (5 mg/kg), increased punished responding for a food reward in the rat Geller-Seifter test 30 min after subcutaneous (SC) administration. This property was shared by the benzodiazepine anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg SC). However, the selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonists ketanserin (0.2-1 mg/kg SC) and altanserin (0.5, 1 mg/kg SC) had little effect. The 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists pindolol and cyanopindolol (6 mg/kg SC) did not affect punished responding either, nor did the 5-HT1D receptor partial agonist and alpha 2 adrenergic receptor antagonist yohimbine (2.5 mg/kg SC) or the histamine H1 receptor antagonist mepyramine (1 mg/kg SC). Unpunished responding was also modestly increased after some doses of the 5-HT2C/5-HT2A receptor antagonists. However, this effect was inconsistent and was also seen after chlordiazepoxide. Furthermore, it was not associated with the increase in punished responding observed in rats orally treated with mianserin (10, 20 mg/kg), 1-NP (10, 20 mg/kg) or ICI 169,369 (50 mg/kg). The action of the 5-HT2C/5-HT2A receptor antagonists tested is therefore consistent with anxiolysis. The results also strongly suggest that this effect is mediated by blockade of the 5-HT2C receptor, although the possibility of 5-HT2B receptor mediation is discussed.", 
    "16": "1. The effect of removal of the longitudinal muscle-myenteric plexus (LM-MP) and/or indomethacin (10 microM) on the response to the tachykinin NK-2 receptor selective agonist, [beta Ala8]NKA(4-10), or to the NK-3 receptor selective agonist, senktide, was investigated by measuring mechanical activity (isotonic recording) of circular muscle (ring preparation) of the guinea-pig ileum. 2. Indomethacin (10 microM) increased the percentage of ileal rings displaying spontaneous activity, either intact or LM-MP-free. The response to senktide (10 nM and 1 microM) was lower in LM-MP-free than in intact ileal rings, either in the absence or presence of indomethacin. The response to a low concentration (10 nM) of [beta Ala8] NKA (4-10) was enhanced in LM-MP-free rings and by indomethacin. 3. In intact ileal rings, the response to senktide was unaffected by atropine (3 microM) alone or by the tachykinin NK-2 receptor antagonist MEN 10,376 (10 microM) alone while it was reduced by the combined administration of the two antagonists. The response to senktide was greatly reduced by tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 microM). Senktide-induced contractions (10 nM) were also reduced by the blocker of N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, omega-contoxin (CTX, 0.1 microM). 4. In about 30% of preparations tested, an inhibitory response (decrease in spontaneous activity) to 10 nM senktide, was disclosed in CTX-treated intact ileal rings. This inhibitory effect was TTX-sensitive. 5. In LM-MP-free ileal rings, the response to senktide was abolished or reduced by atropine and MEN 10,376, alone or in combination, and was also reduced or abolished by TTX and CTX. 6. The response to [beta Ala8]NKA (4-10) was inhibited by MEN 10,376, in both intact and LM-MP-free ileal rings while it was unaffected by atropine, TTX or CTX. 7. These results indicate that indomethacin pretreatment induces a regular background activity for studying the motor response to tachykinins in the circular muscle of the ileum, probably by blocking the formation of relaxant prostanoids. A further increase in sensitivity to direct smooth muscle stimulation (NK-2 receptor agonist) can be obtained by removal of the LM-MP. The response to NK-3 receptor stimulation is diminished but not abolished by removal of the LM-MP, suggesting that NK-3 receptors are located on neuronal bodies of myenteric neurons, but possibly also at other sites (possibly, nerve terminals).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "17": "Mechanisms contributing to the ability of norepinephrine (NE) to enhance arteriolar myogenic responsiveness were studied in the rat cremaster muscle. Anesthetized rats were enclosed in an airtight box that could be pressurized to increase intravascular pressure in the cremaster, which was exteriorized into a tissue bath. Vessel diameter, intravascular pressure, and red cell velocity were measured in the first-order (1A) arteriole during box pressure increases of 10, 20, and 30 mmHg. Control arterioles [diameter = 113 +/- 3 (SE) microns] did not exhibit myogenic constriction in response to step increases in intravascular pressure (e.g., + 30 mmHg, diameter = 122 +/- 5 microns), whereas after 25% constriction with NE (diameter = 85 +/- 2 microns) arterioles exhibited significant myogenic constriction (e.g., +30 mmHg, diameter = 70 +/- 4 microns). The NE effect on myogenic reactivity was augmented by Ca2+ channel agonists and inhibited by antagonists, suggesting a role for voltage-operated Ca2+ channels. In contrast to NE, exposure to KCl (30 mM) did not enhance myogenic responsiveness, suggesting that factors in addition to voltage-operated channels were involved in the NE effect. The protein kinase C (PKC) activator indolactam (1 microM) was found to increase vascular tone in the 1A arterioles (diameter = 109 +/- 6 to 89 +/- 7 microns) and to induce significant myogenic responsiveness similar to that produced by NE (e.g., +30 mmHg, diameter = 65 +/- 9 microns). Staurosporine (0.1 microM) and calphostin C (1 microM), inhibitors of PKC, significantly attenuated the NE-induced myogenic response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "18": "We studied the effects of inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) (endothelium-derived relaxation factor) synthase in combination with alpha and beta adrenergic receptor blockade on pulmonary vascular tone during exercise. In paired studies, we exercised sheep on a treadmill at a speed of 4 mph, and measured blood flow and pressures across the pulmonary circulation with and without inhibition of NO synthase (N omega-nitro-L-arginine 20 mg/kg intravenous [i.v.]), alpha receptor blockade (phentolamine 5 mg i.v.), beta receptor blockade (propranolol 1 mg i.v.), and combined alpha and beta receptor blockade. Activation of both types of adrenergic receptors occurs with exercise, and because increased release in NO is hypothesized to occur during exercise, these studies were designed to determine the magnitude of effect and interactions of these competing dilator and constrictor influences. We found that inhibition of NO synthase raised pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) at rest and that, although a reduction in PVR occurred with exercise from this new baseline, vasoconstriction persisted. Combined beta blockade and NO synthase inhibition unmasked unopposed alpha vasoconstriction; PVR rose at rest and continued to rise with exercise; and mean pulmonary arterial pressures approached very high levels, 43.8 +/- 4.4 cmH2O. Using a distal wedged pulmonary artery catheter technique, most of the vasoconstriction was found to be in vessels upstream from small pulmonary veins. During exercise in sheep there appears to be a high degree of alpha and beta adrenergic-mediated tone in the pulmonary circulation. Endogenous production of NO actively dilates pulmonary vessels at rest and opposes potent alpha-mediated pulmonary vasoconstriction during exercise.",

    "20": "Healthy male volunteers (n = 31) were subjected to two consecutive mental tasks. Subjects were randomly assigned to a beta-blocker (propranolol 40 mg) or a placebo group. The capsules were ingested 1 hour before the tasks. The tasks evoked sympathetic responses, as indicated by an increase in heart rate and a decrease in the preejection period. These effects were abolished under beta-blockade, indicating that effective beta-blockade was achieved. In the immune system, significant increases were found for the number of NK cells and NK cell activity in the placebo group; these increases were absent in the propranolol group. In addition, an increase in all lymphocyte subsets was observed in subjects who had ingested propranolol. This increase, however, was also observed in subjects who had received propranolol but had not performed the tasks, indicating that these non-subset-specific increases in lymphocytes were a side effect of the beta-blocker.", 
    "21": "Mental stress induces activation of the sympathetic nervous system, with concomitant increases in the number of NK cells in the circulation.

    "22": "The D2 dopamine agonist, bromocriptine, has been used as treatment for human PRL-secreting pituitary adenomas. The result of bromocriptine treatment is often a substantial reduction of tumor mass, suggesting that the dopamine agonist is acting as an antiproliferative agent. This action can be observed with a clonal pituitary tumor cell line. The agonist activation of the D2 dopamine receptor inhibits the growth of GH4ZR7 cells, a GH4C1 cell line stably transfected with the cDNA encoding the short form of the D2 dopamine receptor. This effect of dopamine was not sensitive to overnight treatment with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin. Treatment of GH4ZR7 cells with the phorbol ester 4 beta-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate resulted in the loss of dopaminergic inhibition of growth, whereas treatment with 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate had no effect. Inhibitors of protein kinase-C (PKC), such as staurosporine and H7, also blocked the effect of dopamine. Down-regulation of cellular PKC by phorbol ester treatment resulted in a complete loss of dopaminergic inhibition of growth. Long term treatment of GH4ZR7 cells with TRH results in a specific down-regulation of the epsilon form of PKC and abolished the ability of dopamine to inhibit growth. These results suggest that PKC epsilon is involved in mediating the antiproliferative effects of dopamine. This mediation of growth appears to be through a novel signaling pathway for the D2 dopamine receptor.", 
    "23": "Ventricular arrhythmias occur frequently in patients with hypertensive left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and have been associated with increased incidence of sudden death. In this study, the effect of various antihypertensive medications on ventricular arrhythmias was evaluated in 31 hypertensive patients with moderate to severe LV hypertrophy. Patients were assessed at baseline (after 3 weeks of placebo treatment) and after treatment with each of 4 monotherapies: diltiazem 120 or 240 mg/day, metoprolol 100 or 200 mg/day, enalapril 10 or 20 mg/day and hydrochlorothiazide 50 or 100 mg/day. Each drug therapy was administered for 4 weeks. The sequence of each treatment was determined at random. Echocardiographic measurements and electrocardiograms were obtained only at baseline. Biochemical measurements and 48-hour Holter monitoring were obtained at baseline and at the end of each treatment. All treatments resulted in a significant but similar decrease in blood pressure. In the group as a whole diltiazem decreased ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) by 65% (p < 0.05) and metoprolol by 52% (p = 0.07). Enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide had no effect. In 12 patients with > or = 5 VPCs/hour at baseline, diltiazem and metoprolol decreased VPCs by 66% (p < 0.05). It is concluded that in hypertensive patients with moderate to severe LV hypertrophy, both diltiazem and metoprolol significantly reduce VPCs.", 
    "24": "It has been reported in the literature that alpha 1-adrenoceptor activation in adult rat heart does not cause an increase in Ca2+ current but involves a decrease in I(t). This may explain in part the positive inotropic effect of alpha 1-adrenoceptor activation. In this study, the effect of phenylephrine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, on L-type Ca2+ channel current was compared in young and neonatal rat myocytes. In the presence of propranolol, phenylephrine increased the Ca2+ current (reversed by prazosin) in neonatal but not in young rat myocytes suggesting that the coupling of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor to Ca2+ channels may switch during development.", 
    "25": "A 49-year-old woman was admitted because of several syncopes during sports activity. She was appeared well, and the physical examination revealed no pathological findings, particularly no heart murmurs. The electrocardiogram had a normal PQ, QRS and the corrected QT (QTc)interval was 0.44 s. During the exercise test no arrhythmias were seen and the QTc was unchanged of 0.44 s, but 0.6 mg atropine injected intravenously provoked prolonged QTc = 0.49 s followed by nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Electrophysiological examination and coronary arteriography showed no inducible arrhythmias and no presence of coronary artery disease. Beta-blocker treatment was started. During one year of observation she presented no syncope, and was still active in sports. It is concluded that patients presenting with syncope and an ECG with borderline QT prolongation should undergo several provocation trials, if simple stress test is initially negative, because undiagnosed patients without prophylactic treatment have a high mortality.", 
    "26": "Norepinephrine is associated with long-lasting modifications of neuronal activation in hippocampal slices. Long-lasting potentiation is produced by a single application of 1.0 microM isoproterenol (a beta-adrenergic antagonist) to the dentate gyrus. The results of the present work indicate that a much lower 75 nM concentration of isoproterenol produces long-lasting potentiation in the dentate gyrus if it is perfused in two applications separated by a 30 min wash. The potentiation so produced is prevented by beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, but not prevented by the NMDA receptor antagonist aphosphonopentanoic acid. The implication of these results is that long-lasting potentiation in the dentate gyrus can be produced by more than one beta-adrenergic-activated mechanism.", 
    "27": "An aromatic residue, tyrosine 326 in the prototypical human beta 2-adrenergic receptor, exists in a highly conserved sequence motif in virtually all members of the G protein-coupled receptor family. The potential role of this conserved aromatic amino acid residue in the cellular processes of sequestration (a rapid internalization of the surface receptor) and down-regulation (a slower loss of total cellular receptors) associated with agonist-mediated desensitization of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor was assessed by replacing tyrosine residue 326 with an alanine residue (beta 2AR-Y326A). This mutation completely abolishes agonist-mediated receptor sequestration without affecting the ability of the receptor to activate maximally adenylyl cyclase, to undergo rapid desensitization, and to down-regulate in response to agonist. The only other major change associated with the mutated receptor is a complete loss of the ability to resensitize following rapid desensitization. These results imply that this tyrosine residue, which is part of a highly conserved sequence motif in G protein-coupled receptors, may be responsible for their agonist-mediated sequestration and that sequestration and down-regulation of the receptor are dissociable phenomena. The lack of resensitization in the sequestration-defective beta 2-adrenergic receptor mutant strongly suggests that the sequestration pathway is an important mechanism by which cells re-establish the normal responsiveness of G protein-coupled receptors following the removal of agonist.", 
    "28": "The efficacy and safety of amlodipine (2.5-10 mg) once daily was compared with atenolol (50-100 mg) once daily in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension in a randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study. A total of 125 patients were randomly allocated at the end of a 4-week run-in placebo period to 8 weeks of double-blind treatment with amlodipine (n = 41), atenolol (n = 43), or placebo (n = 41). The placebo group had small mean changes in supine and standing blood pressure compared with baseline. The mean blood pressure changes from baseline 24 hours postdose in the amlodipine group (mean daily dose 8.8 mg) were -12.8/-10.1 mm Hg for supine blood pressure and -11.5/-9.8 mm Hg for standing blood pressure (p < 0.001 compared with placebo), and for the atenolol group (mean daily dose 83.7 mg) the changes were -11.3/-11.7 mm Hg for supine blood pressure and -13.3/-12.3 mm Hg for standing blood pressure (p < 0.001 compared with placebo). There were no statistically significant blood pressure differences between active treatments. The responder rates for amlodipine, atenolol, and placebo were 61.1, 64.9, and 11.1%, respectively. The blood pressure values taken over the 24-hour period at final visit revealed that amlodipine and atenolol maintained the supine blood pressure < or = 140/90 mm Hg throughout the period of observation; the corresponding time-effect curve for the placebo group was clearly in the hypertensive range. Both amlodipine and atenolol were well tolerated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "29": "Calcium antagonists are effective antianginal agents in the treatment of patients with stable exercise-induced angina pectoris. A series of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies with the novel, once-daily calcium antagonist amlodipine have been completed in a large number of patients with stable exercise-induced angina pectoris. Compared with placebo, once-daily amlodipine demonstrated a significant dose-related extension in exercise duration and workload accomplished, and reduction in number of anginal attacks and associated glyceryl trinitrate consumption. The clinical antianginal attributes of amlodipine were accompanied by significant reductions in electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischemia. In comparison with other antianginal drugs, once-daily amlodipine at a dosage range of 5-10 mg demonstrated antianginal activity comparable to thrice-daily diltiazem and once-daily nadolol. Amlodipine administered once daily achieves symptomatic and electrocardiographic amelioration of myocardial ischemic episodes induced by exercise in the majority of patients with stable angina pectoris. Amlodipine does not depress left ventricular pumping activity, and its side-effect profile does not differ substantially from that of placebo.", 
    "30": "Improved understanding of the pathogenesis of symptomatic and silent myocardial ischemia has led to important advances in the prevention and treatment of these syndromes. For example, recognition of the role of platelets in the atherogenic process and of thrombosis in acute myocardial ischemia has led to extensive use of aspirin and thrombolytic therapy, with resultant decreases in mortality. Both nitrates and beta-adrenergic blockers effectively alleviate myocardial ischemia. However, long-term nitrate use is limited by the occurrence of tolerance. beta blockers have been shown to decrease subsequent cardiovascular events in patients with acute myocardial infarction; however, adverse effects are often associated with their use. Calcium antagonists have been shown to be effective in the treatment of stable and vasospastic angina. In patients with coronary artery disease and symptoms resulting from either fixed obstruction or vasospasm, these agents decrease the frequency of angina episodes. The 3 types of calcium antagonists currently available--phenylalkylamine, benzothiazepine, and dihydropyridine derivatives--while chemically a heterogeneous group, share the common property of decreasing depolarization of smooth muscle, albeit to varying degrees. Nonetheless, other characteristics, including varying electrophysiologic effects, distinguish these groups. The novel calcium antagonist amlodipine is effective and well tolerated as an antianginal agent, and offers the advantage of once-daily dosing. Calcium antagonists appear to be well tolerated in patients with concomitant conditions such as diabetes and are effective in commonly coexistent cardiovascular disorders such as hypertension.", 
    "31": "The potential cytoprotective effect of the purine transport inhibitor S-(p-nitrobenzyl)-6-thioinosine (NBTI) in a model of myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion was investigated in the anaesthetised ferret. The left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was occluded for 90 min, producing ischaemia in 53 +/- 3% of the left ventricular free wall, followed by 240 min reperfusion. NBTI (0.5 mg kg-1, i.v.) was given prior to ischaemia or prior to reperfusion. In addition the effect of purine transport inhibition was investigated in animals subjected to ischaemia without reperfusion. NBTI reduced infarct size from 84.0 +/- 1.7 to 71.4 +/- 3.7% of the area at risk (P < 0.05) when given prior to occlusion of the LAD. NBTI was ineffective however when given 15 min prior to reperfusion. NBTI had no effect upon infarct size produced by ischaemia without reperfusion. The effect of NBTI was independent of significant changes in myocardial blood flow during ischaemia and reperfusion or upon neutrophil infiltration.",

After three months of treatment, the blood pressure of treated subjects was significantly lower and their well-being score approached that of a control group of healthy adults. It was noted that the scores of female subjects were higher than those of the male subjects both before and after the treatment period. This indicated greater psychosocial sensitivity. While all the different types of anti-hypertensive drugs were prescribed, none were found to be more effective in reducing blood pressure nor in improving the quality of life than the combination of diuretics and conversion enzyme inhibitors.",

    "36": "The interaction of isoproterenol with beta-adrenoceptors has been investigated in astroglial and neuronal cells isolated from adult rat cerebral cortices. Using the non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist (3H)CGP-12177 as a ligand, binding experiments revealed that both types of cells exhibit beta-adrenoceptors. However the analysis of the isoproterenol displacement curve indicated that only neuronal cells contained the high affinity conformational state of the beta-adrenoceptor.", 
    "37": "The effects of two Neuropeptide Y (NPY) analogs (Y1- and Y2-type) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) on both catecholamine (adrenaline and noradrenaline) release and aldosterone production by rat adrenal capsule/glomerular zone, have been investigated in vitro. The adrenal capsule/glomerular zones, collected from adult male rats, were incubated in a medium (Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer supplemented with glucose and bovine serum albumin) containing or not one of the following synthetic peptides: human Leu31,Pro34-NPY (an agonist of the Y1-type receptors), human/porcine NPY18-36 (an agonist of the Y2-type receptors) and VIP at the concentration of 10(-7) M, associated or not with 10(-7) M atenolol (a beta 1 adrenergic antagonist) or ICI-118,551 hydrochloride (a beta 2 adrenergic antagonist). The two NPY analogs as well as the VIP stimulated the release of catecholamines and of aldosterone. The beta 1 adrenergic antagonist, but not the beta 2 one, which failed to affect basal aldosterone production when given alone, prevented NPY18-36-, Leu31,Pro34-NPY- or VlP-induced aldosterone secretion. Present data support the hypothesis that adrenaline and/or noradrenaline could mediate the effects of both NPY and VIP on aldosterone secretion via beta 1 adrenergic receptors; alternatively, the steroidogenic effect of NPY or VIP could be related to direct interaction between NPY- or VIP-specific binding sites, present on the capsule/glomerular zone of the rat adrenal cortex, and beta 1 adrenergic receptors. Then the NPYergic, VIPergic and catecholaminergic innervation of the adrenal cortex, previously characterized by immunohistochemistry, may be a potent stimulatory element in the nervous control of the aldosterone secretion.", 
    "38": "Studies using dobutamine thallium-201 myocardial perfusion imaging have suggested a high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of coronary artery disease. However, few data are available comparing dobutamine with exercise stress for the detection and localization of perfusion defects. This study compared the effects of dobutamine and exercise stress using technetium-99m sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomographic imaging in the same patients in a prospective crossover trial. Twenty-four patients with a high likelihood of coronary artery disease underwent tomographic myocardial imaging at rest, after symptom-limited treadmill exercise, and after intravenous dobutamine (maximum 30 micrograms/kg/min). Tomograms of the left ventricle were divided into 20 segments and were interpreted without knowledge of patient identity or stress protocol. Dobutamine was well tolerated by all patients. Segment-by-segment concordance between exercise and dobutamine images was highly significant (kappa = 0.56, p < 0.0001). Global first-order agreement (normal vs abnormal) between exercise and dobutamine studies was 96% (kappa = 0.65, p = 0.02); global second-order agreement (normal vs fixed vs ischemic defect) was 88% (kappa = 0.45, p = 0.02). Regional first- and second-order agreement were 96 and 93%, respectively (p < 0.001 for both). Twenty patients underwent coronary angiography. Comparisons between exercise and angiography and between dobutamine and angiography were similar for both global agreement (95 vs 100%, p = NS) and regional agreement (77 vs 72%, p = NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "39": "Evidence for the utilisation of substrates by the ischaemic myocardium and its dependence for viability on a critical supply of glucose was established many years ago. It was recognised that an excess of free fatty acids (FFA) could increase the severity of ischaemic damage and possibly be arrhythmogenic. But metabolic intervention to improve survival during acute myocardial infarction was not regarded as a priority, perhaps because of uncertainty about its value and the advent of trials of beta-blocker and antiarrhythmic drugs. There has never been an adequate trial of the benefit to the ischaemic or infarcting myocardium of increasing local glucose concentrations or reducing the availability of FFA. We have taken into account new knowledge of the effects of fatty acids on cation channels and brought up to date the arguments for metabolic intervention with glucose-insulin solutions or antilipolytic drugs sustained ischaemia.", 
    "40": "Insulin secretion from pancreatic islets is controlled by peptides as well as by nutrients. We report here a novel, extraordinarily potent peptidergic regulation of insulin secretion. A 27-residue form of pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP27) as low as 10(-14) to 10(-13) M stimulated insulin release from rat islets in a glucose-dependent manner. PACAP27 also increased cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in islet beta-cells. Nitrendipine, a blocker of the L-type Ca2+ channel, abolished both [Ca2+]i and insulin responses. Vasoactive intestinal peptide, a peptide exhibiting 68% amino acid homology with PACAP, also increased [Ca2+]i in beta-cells but only at concentrations in the nanomolar range, indicating that PACAP27 is 4 logs more potent. A 38-residue form of the peptide (PACAP38) stimulated insulin release and increased beta-cell [Ca2+]i in a manner similar to that of PACAP27. PACAP-like immunoreactivity was demonstrated in pancreatic nerve fibers, islets, and capillaries. The results indicate that PACAP is a physiologically occurring peptide in pancreas and that PACAP, in a glucose-dependent manner, activates beta-cells presumably via a high affinity PACAP-selective receptor, raises [Ca2+]i by increasing the activity of L-type Ca2+ channels, and consequently stimulates insulin release. PACAP appears to be by far the most potent insulinotropic peptide known.", 
    "41": "A direct high-performance liquid chromatographic assay for the determination of labetalol diastereoisomers in plasma without derivatization was developed. Baseline resolution of diastereoisomers was accomplished on a C18 bonded reversed-phase polymeric column with a basic (pH 11.5) mobile phase and isocratic elution. Sample treatment was optimized in order to achieve a complete extraction of labetalol diastereoisomers and to avoid racemization during extraction. Fluorimetric detection improved the selectivity and afforded a detection limit of 3 ng/ml for each diastereoisomer. This method is suitable for routine quantification of labetalol diastereoisomers and has been applied to a pharmacokinetic study in small laboratory animals.", 
    "42": "Vascular smooth muscle cell membranes from prehypertensive rats of the Milan hypertensive strain (MHS) were used to examine adenylyl cyclase activity and its regulation by guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins (G-proteins). Basal adenylyl cyclase activity was similar in MHS and Milan normotensive strain (MNS) membranes. Forskolin (10(-4) M) produced a significantly greater stimulatory response in MHS membranes, but this was not observed with NaF (10(-2) M). Isoproterenol (10(-4) M) caused a significantly decreased stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity in MHS membranes, while prostaglandin E1 (10(-5) M) produced similar responses in the two strains. Gi function and GTP responses, as observed by biphasic effects of GTP on isoproterenol-stimulated membranes, were similar in both strains. The levels of Gi2 alpha and Gq alpha/G11 alpha were similar in the two strains, while the levels of Gs alpha (44 and 42 kDa forms) and the beta-subunit were significantly reduced by approximately 20% in MHS membranes. The alpha-subunit of Gi3 was dramatically reduced by approximately 80% in MHS membranes. The affinities of beta-adrenergic receptors for the antagonist, cyanopindolol, were similar in the two strains; however, the number of beta-adrenoceptors was substantially reduced in MHS membranes. These findings may be of relevance to altered vascular reactivity and transmembrane ion distribution observed in the MHS.", 
    "43": "In rat aorta, KT2-734 inhibited contractile responses to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and KCl. KT2-734 inhibited the relaxing effect of verapamil, but not nifedipine. Similarly, verapamil, but not nifedipine, inhibited the vasorelaxing effect of KT2-734. KT2-734 relaxation was inhibited by endothelium removal but not by atropine and propranolol. Methylene blue, a guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, and NG-monomethyl arginine also inhibited the relaxation both in the presence and absence of endothelium. In the absence of endothelium, KT2-734 potentiated the relaxation induced by L-arginine, nitroglycerin and isoproterenol. In addition, M & B 22,948, a cGMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, and theophylline inhibited and potentiated, respectively, KT2-734-induced relaxation. However, methylene blue inhibited the potentiation of isoproterenol relaxation by KT2-734 and that of KT2-734-relaxation by theophylline. KT2-734 caused increases in the level of cGMP without significantly affecting the cAMP level. These results suggest that KT2-734 may cause endothelium-independent relaxation mainly due to inhibition of cGMP-phosphodiesterase.", 
    "44": "Selective histamine H3 receptor agonists, such as R-alpha-methylhistamine, have been shown to inhibit neurogenic sympathetic pressor responses in vivo. The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that R-alpha-methylhistamine would evoke an histamine H3 receptor mediated hypotensive response in an animal with intact sympathetic vascular tone. In pentobarbital anaesthetized rats, administration of R-alpha-methylhistamine (0.1-3 mg.kg-1, i.v.) had a biphasic effect on arterial pressure, consisting of a transient depressor response followed by a more long-lasting pressor response. The depressor response was antagonized by chlorpheniramine (selective histamine H1 receptor antagonist, 3 mg.kg-1, i.v.), but was unaffected by cimetidine (selective histamine H2 receptor antagonist, 3 mg.kg-1, i.v.) or thioperamide (selective histamine H3 receptor antagonist, 3 mg.kg-1, i.v.). The pressor response was unaltered by chlorpheniramine, cimetidine or thioperamide. In pithed rats, R-alpha-methylhistamine had a biphasic effect on arterial pressure which was qualitatively similar to that seen in anaesthetized rats with the exception that the pressor responses were much greater in magnitude and duration and were accompanied by significant increases in heart rate. On a pharmacological basis, the biphasic response in pithed rats was identical to that seen in anaesthetized rats inasmuch as the depressor response was antagonized by chlorpheniramine whereas the pressor response was resistant to histamine H1, H2 and H3 receptor antagonists. Combined alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade (with phentolamine and nadolol) produced significant attenuation of the pressor and tachycardic responses to R-alpha-methylhistamine in pithed rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "45": "The study aimed at determining relationship between plasma free fatty acid (FFA) and impaired glucose tolerance in hyperthyroid patients prior to and after the treatment with propranolol or acebutolol, i.e. following lipolytic blockade leading to a decrease in plasma FFA levels. The study included 31 untreated hyperthyroid patients and 12 normal subjects serving as a matched control group. IVGTT was performed in all subjects. Venous blood specimens were collected at 0, 3, 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes following intravenous glucose load (0.33 g/kg body weight during 3 minutes). Nineteen patients with normal K values were randomized to groups treated either with propranolol in the daily dose of 120 mg (10 patients) or 400 mg acebutolol (9 patients). Twelve patients with low K values were randomized to groups treated with either propranolol (5 patients) or acebutolol (7 patients). The second IVGTT was performed after 7 days of therapy. Glucose, FFA and insulin levels were determined in all blood samples whereas T3 and T4 were determined in samples taken at 0 minute. Plasma T3, T4 and insulin levels were assayed with radioimmunological technique, glucose--with glucose oxidase, and FFA--colorimetrically. Significantly higher plasma FFA levels were found in patients with low K values in comparison with control group. There were no differences in plasma FFA levels in both hyperthyroid patients and normal subjects. Acebutolol but not propranolol normalized K value whereas propranolol (but not acebutolol) significantly decreased acute phase of insulin secretion. Plasma glucose and insulin levels as well as K value were not altered during propranolol acebutolol therapy in patients with normal K value.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "46": "Interaction of beta-adrenergic and somatostatinergic systems in the hippocampus has not been investigated fully. We studied the influence of DL-isoproterenol (ISO), a beta-adrenergic agonist and DL-propranolol (PRO), a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, on the somatostatinergic system in the rat hippocampus. The short-(5h) and long-term (14 days) administration of ISO (5 mg/kg i.p.) or of PRO (10 mg/kg i.p.) did not affect somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SSLI) content in the hippocampus of male Wistar rats. Both short- and long-term ISO administration decreased the number of specific [125I]Tyr11-somatostatin ([125I]Tyr11-SS) receptors in synaptosomes from hippocampus (29%, P < 0.05 and 34%, P < 0.05, after short- and long-term administration, respectively) without changing the affinity constant. This decrease in the number of [125I]Tyr11-SS receptors was not due to a direct effect of ISO on these receptors since no decrease in binding was produced by high concentrations of ISO (10(-5) M) when added in vitro. In addition, this decrease could be blocked by pretreatment with PRO. Short- and long-term administration of PRO alone increased the [125I]Tyr11-SS binding in hippocampus (42%, P < 0.05 and 33%, P < 0.05, after short- or long-term administration, respectively) without changing the affinity constant. Although there is no direct evidence that the regulation of SS receptors by the beta-adrenergic system has a physiological significance, this mechanism may provide a means by which the brain environment could modulate SS receptor number and, therefore, sensitivity to SS in a subset of SS-sensitive neurons.", 
    "47": "Multidrug resistant cancer cells of the MDR-1 phenotype utilize an ATP-dependent pump to excrete toxic drugs. Rhodamine 123 (R123) is a fluorescent substrate of the MDR pump. An assay for the ATP-dependent initial efflux of R123 from CEM/VLB100 human leukemic lymphoblasts has been developed. The MDR-1 cells were treated with a reversal agent and preloaded with 40.0 nM R123 in buffer at 30 degrees C that contained sodium azide and 2-deoxyglucose. The cells were rinsed with cold buffer and resuspended in L-glutamine/glucose solution at 23 degrees C. The cell suspension was passed through a filter and R123 in the filtrate was detected at 2-s intervals by fluorescence. Efflux of R123 was inhibited by the reversal agents amiodarone, cyclosporin A, Ro11-2933 (DMDP), quinidine, and the optical isomers of propranolol. The MDR pump is stereospecific for the (R)-diastereomer quinidine; however, the (S)-diastereomer quinine is a relatively weak inhibitor of the pump. Cyclosporin A was the most potent inhibitor tested against the efflux of R123 by the MDR pump.", 
    "48": "The effect of nitroglycerin, nifedipine, diltiazem or propranolol on fibre types and capillaries was studied in extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus (S) muscles of the rat. In EDL muscle nifedipine increased the proportion of type I fibres (7.9% +/- 1.7 vs. 4.7% +/- 2.7). Nitroglycerin and dialtiazem decreased IIB fibres (40.7% +/- 10.6 and 37.3% +/- 14.6 respectively vs. 52.3% +/- 9.4). Propranolol increased IIB fibres to 66.3% +/- 8.1, while reducing IIA fibres (25.3% +/- 6.6 vs. 42.2% +/- 6.9). No changes in fibre type proportion were found in S muscle. Capillary density was increased in EDL by nitroglycerin (965 +/- 171 vs. 818 +/- 98 cap/mm2). Propranolol had a dual effect on this parameter, decreasing it in EDL to 570 +/- 85 and augmenting it in S (754 +/- 117 vs. 601 +/- 121). No change was found in capillary to fibre ratio with any of the drugs either in EDL or S muscles. In EDL all the drugs except propranolol, which had the opposite effect, decreased the area of IIA fibre per capillary around 20%; this effect can be interpreted as a reduction of diffusion distance from blood to fibre.",

    "50": "Ca++-antagonist is effective not only for variant angina but also for effort angina. The effects of sustained release diltiazem (diltiazem-R) and beta 1-blocker (atenolol) on exercise tolerance were studied in seven patients with stable effort angina in a cross over trial. Diltiazem-R (100mg) or atenolol (50mg) was given once a day, each treatment period lasting for two weeks after a two-week control period. The treadmill exercise test was performed on the last day of each protocol. Both diltiazem-R and atenolol decreased heart rate at rest and the decrease with atenolol was greater than that with diltiazem-R. The systolic blood pressure was unchanged at rest by both drugs. At maximal work levels, atenolol decreased the heart rate and pressure rate product significantly but diltiazem-R did not. Both diltiazem-R and atenolol significantly prolonged the exercise time (average 137 and 165 seconds respectively), time to onset of 1mm ST depression (240 and 288 seconds respectively). There was no significant difference in exercise tolerance between diltiazem-R and atenolol. These findings suggest that diltiazem-R, a sustained release Ca++-antagonist, provides beneficial effects in patients with stable effort angina.",

The urine levels of tubular enzymes alkaline phospatase (AP), gamma-glutamyl-transferase (GMT) and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase were selected for the evaluation or tubular toxicity. The clearance of endogenous creatinine was observed as well. The experiments were carried out on male rats of outbred Wistar strain within 7 days after the cytostatics had been applied. A significant increase of urine levels of all enzymes studied was observed in animals, which were given CBDCP only. A maximum change was observed in the urine excretion of NAG. Nifedipine application decreased the change significantly, cimetidine had no effect. The effect of combined nifedipine and cimetidine application did not vary from the effect of application of nifedipine itself. In animals given CDDP only, a significant increase of urine levels of all studied enzymes was proved, the maximum change was observed in NAG excretion. This change significantly decreased by nifedipine application. The same effect was reached by cimetidine application. Preventive effects of nifedipine and cimetidine potentiated mutually each other. In conclusion we consider nifedipine as a convenient prevention of CDDP and CBDCP nephrotoxic effects while cimetidine can be used as a prevention of CDDP nephrotoxic effect only.", 
    "52": "The overall objective of this study was to determine the pattern of beta-adrenergic receptors in bovine luteal membranes obtained from slaughtered and from conscious cattle on different days of the estrous cycle. Two approaches were used with respect to the CL collection. In the first approach, CL (n = 20) were obtained from animals slaughtered in a local abattoir. The day of the estrous cycle was estimated based on the morphology of luteal tissue and follicles present. Using 3H-dihydroalprenolol (3H-DHA) as a ligand, we were unable to find specific binding in any of the tissues examined. Therefore, for the second approach we decided to collect CL from mature heifers or cows under local anesthesia on Days 4 (n = 15), 8 (n = 7), 12 (n = 6), and 16 (n = 3) of the estrous cycle by means of colpotomy or by lumbar incision. This procedure was chosen to reduce the influence of stress factors before CL collection. In these samples, specific beta-adrenergic binding sites were found and they varied during the estrous cycle. Maximal binding (Bmax; fmol/mg of protein) was highest on Day 4 (178.3 +/- 15.2); it then decreased significantly (73.2 +/- 14.7, 40.1 +/- 5.5, 10.8 +/- 0.8) on Days 8, 12, and 16, respectively. The dissociation constant (Kd; nM), which followed the same pattern, was 52.0 +/- 14.4, 16.3 +/- 3.9, 14.9 +/- 3.2, and 7.6 +/- 4.0) on the same days, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Contrast medium, 0.7 ml, was injected into the aortic root in the absence and presence of 10(-7) and 10(-5) M beta-blocker to observe the changes in resting tension, force of contraction, rate of contraction, heart rate and PR interval. Beta-blockers and contrast media interact in affecting myocardial contractility, heart rate and atrioventricular conduction. The interaction is milder when the beta-blocker lacks membrane stabilizing activity and the contrast medium is nonionic.", 
    "54": "Serotonin (5-HT) produced concentration-dependent contractions of the isolated rat pylorus in vitro. Serotonergic contractions were antagonized by the calcium L-channel blocker, diltiazem, but not by tetrodotoxin or atropine. Three drugs that block 5-HT2 receptors, ketanserin, xylamidine, and methysergide, unsurmountably inhibited contractions to 5-HT. In contrast, antagonists of 5-HT3, 5-HT1A/1B, beta-adrenergic, or alpha 1-adrenergic receptors did not alter the response to 5-HT. Devazepide, an antagonist of cholecystokinin (CCK) type-A receptors, blocked contraction produced by CCK-8 but not by 5-HT. Conversely, the 5-HT2 antagonists did not affect CCK-stimulated contraction. These results suggest that 5-HT contracts the pylorus by a 5-HT2-like receptor on muscle and that this response occurs independently of CCKergic receptor mechanisms. Furthermore, the parallel between the overall pharmacological profile for serotonergic contraction of the pylorus and that observed previously for the anorectic action of peripheral 5-HT makes the pylorus a logical candidate for peripheral serotonergic control of feeding.",

After double-blind randomization with low-dose atenolol, enalapril, or isradipine, the dose was increased stepwise and hydrochlorothiazide added as needed to achieve goal DBP (less than 90 mm Hg and greater than 10 mm Hg below baseline). During maintenance, patients not at goal were \"stepped up,\" and patients with uncontrolled DBP at maximum dosage were removed from the study.

Preliminary observations on patients with glaucoma using a beta-blocker beneath the upper lid suggested a drop in intraocular pressure into the normal range in some previously refractory patients being treated with the same medications. To test this clinical observation, the authors observed if there were any physiologic differences in topical fluorescein absorption into the anterior chamber when given beneath the upper lid versus the lower lid.",

    "63": "It has been suggested that ischemia secondary to coronary vasoconstriction is responsible for adverse cardiovascular effects of cocaine. However, the reported coronary vascular effects of cocaine vary considerably. We sought to determine the effects of cocaine on the coronary vasculature in anesthetized and conscious rats. Rats anesthetized with chloralose were instrumented for estimation of ascending aortic and coronary blood flows using pulsed Doppler velocitometry. Cocaine administration resulted in bradycardia and a biphasic mean arterial pressure response. Cocaine elicited highly variable increases in coronary vascular resistance and decreases in cardiac output. Decreases in coronary blood flow and rate-pressure product were directly correlated. Prazosin significantly attenuated the cardiac output but not the coronary vascular responses to cocaine. Propranolol, on the other hand, significantly shortened the duration of both responses. Conscious rats, instrumented for coronary blood flow determination, also exhibited cocaine-induced increases in coronary vascular resistance, yet the changes in coronary blood flow were not correlated with the rate-pressure product. These results provide the first evidence that cocaine produces equivalent increases in coronary vascular resistance in conscious and anesthetized rats. However, because the relationship between coronary blood flow and rate-pressure is different between the two preparations, as are other cardiovascular responses, we suggest that anesthesia alters the mechanism(s) by which cocaine affects the rat coronary vasculature.",

Electrophysiological variables were measured during a control period, after propranolol (0.15 mg/kg loading dose followed by 0.1 mg/min infusion), and after autonomic blockade (atropine 0.04 mg/kg).",

In contrast, both RA MAPD90 and RA ERP increased after propranolol (RA MAPD90 from 242 (19) ms to 260 (19) ms; RA ERP from 216 (21) ms to 230 (18) ms, p < 0.0005), and then increased slightly more after autonomic blockade (RA MAPD90 265 (16) ms, p = 0.09; RA ERP 235 (16) ms, p = 0.07), thus remaining above control values (p < 0.0005).", 
    "68": "The results indicate (a) that in the human ventricle vagal stimulation and sympathetic beta stimulation are antagonistic and that direct vagal stimulation predominates over beta stimulation, with sympathetic-vagal interaction being minimal and (b) that in the human atrium vagal stimulation and beta stimulation are synergistic and beta stimulation predominates over vagal stimulation, with direct vagal stimulation having a minimal effect.", 
    "69": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of a beta 1-selective (atenolol 50 mg q.d.) and a non-selective (propranolol 80 mg b.i.d.) beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on human stimulated parotid and submandibular-sublingual (SM-SL) gland secretion. A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over (\"Latin square\") design was used in 19 healthy male volunteers. Stimulated parotid and SM-SL saliva were sampled immediately before and 7 days after the start of each treatment period. Stimulation of salivary secretion was achieved by use of a 3% citric acid solution. Plasma concentrations of propranolol and atenolol were determined from blood samples. The salivary secretion of both glands was assessed for flow rate, amylase, lysozyme, and salivary peroxidase activity and for concentrations of total protein, hexosamine, sialic acid, Ca2+, Cl-, K+, Mg2+, Na+, and PO4(3-). In both parotid and SM-SL secretions, the total protein and phosphate concentrations and amylase activity were significantly decreased during the two active treatment periods. In SM-SL gland secretion, there were significant changes in potassium and calcium concentrations during active treatment as compared with baseline, with potassium showing a decreased and calcium an increased concentration. During atenolol treatment, salivary peroxidase activity decreased significantly in SM-SL secretion. In parotid secretion, the hexosamine/total protein ratio decreased and the sialic acid/hexosamine ratio increased during atenolol treatment, which may indicate an effect on protein synthesis. No significant effects on salivary secretion rates were disclosed.", 
    "70": "Sotalol was developed as a nonselective beta-blocker in the 1960s for the treatment of hypertension and later for cardiac risk management after myocardial infarction. Extensive research has since well described class III type electrophysiologic effects on the repolarization of myocardial fibers. Sotalol prolongs and homogenizes ventricular refractoriness, resulting in good antifibrillatory/antitachycardia protection. The unique combination of beta-blockade and antiarrhythmic effects probably will promote sotalol's use in postmyocardial infarction patients with ventricular tachycardia and sudden death. This article summarizes the pharmacologic and cardiovascular effects of this new drug, outlining its clinical use.", 
    "71": "Renal artery stenosis not only causes severe hypertension, but if left untreated, can progress to renal failure. A 64-year-old woman with a serum creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL and mild proteinuria developed progressively severe hypertension that was resistant to a calcium channel blocker. The patient received lisinopril, which was discontinued after 2 days because of nonspecific symptoms. One week later, an intravenous pyelogram showed a normal-sized but poorly functioning left kidney and a nonfunctional right kidney. The serum creatinine increased to 11.7 mg/dL and the patient was begun on hemodialysis. A renal arteriogram performed 6 weeks later for persistent hypertension showed bilateral renal artery occlusion; renal vein renin values from the left kidney were higher than those from the right kidney. After 11 weeks of hemodialysis, thrombolytic therapy followed by angioplasty was performed. Three weeks later, the renal function had returned to baseline (serum creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL) and hypertension was controlled with a beta-blocker. Renal artery stenosis is a potentially reversible cause of renal failure and should be considered in the evaluation of elderly patients with hypertension, even in the presence of renal failure.", 
    "72": "The present study examined the time course of changes in baroreceptor reflex function by means of sigmoidal curve-fitting analysis in conscious, unrestrained renovascular one-kidney, one clip (1K1C) rats at 1, 3, 7, 15, 30, and 60 days after renal artery clipping. The reflex heart rate responses were elicited by alternate intravenous bolus injections of phenylephrine (change, +5 to +50 mm Hg) and sodium nitroprusside (change, -5 to -50 mmHg). Atropine methylnitrate and atenolol were given to evaluate the responses mediated by the cardiac sympathetic or vagal component, respectively. The average baroreceptor reflex gain (sensitivity) decreased progressively (day 1, 3.35 +/- 0.3 beats per minute [bpm] per millimeter of mercury), reaching a maximal attenuation in the 30-day 1K1C group (1.83 +/- 0.5 bpm/mm Hg) compared with sham rats (approximately 4.60 bpm/mm Hg). The data showed a decreased vagal activity contributing to the attenuation of the baroreceptor gain only in the 30-day 1K1C group. In contrast, the cardiac sympathetic component of the baroreceptor reflex was significantly decreased in all 1K1C groups (from 2.10 +/- 0.4 to 0.50 +/- 0.2 bpm/mm Hg) compared with the respective sham groups (from 3.80 +/- 0.3 to 3.10 +/- 0.4 bpm/mm Hg). These results suggest that a reduced contribution of the sympathetic component to the baroreceptor heart rate reflex may be the main cause of the progressive attenuation of the baroreceptor reflex sensitivity observed in conscious 1K1C hypertensive rats.", 
    "73": "Apart from lowering blood pressure, antihypertensive drugs may influence vessel wall function. In a randomized double-blind study, the effect of lisinopril and metoprolol on arterial distensibility was studied in 40 patients with essential hypertension. After a placebo run-in period, the patients were randomly treated with metoprolol (50, 100, or 200 mg) or lisinopril (5, 10, or 20 mg) for 10 weeks. In the lisinopril group, blood pressure decreased after 10 weeks of therapy from 173 +/- 10/102 +/- 5 to 155 +/- 10/85 +/- 3 mm Hg and in the metoprolol group from 167 +/- 12/102 +/- 4 to 153 +/- 8/84 +/- 3 mm Hg. Diameter (millimeters), relative change in diameter (percent), and distensibility (10(-3)/kPa) of the left common carotid artery were determined after the placebo run-in period and after 6 and 10 weeks of antihypertensive therapy. A multigate Doppler system was used to measure the vessel wall movements by Doppler analysis in M-mode; blood pressure was recorded by finger plethysmography (Finapres). Neither lisinopril nor metoprolol influenced the end-diastolic diameter of the common carotid artery after 6 and 10 weeks of treatment. In the lisinopril group, a significant increase of percent change in diameter (P < .05 compared with the baseline value; P < .05 compared with the metoprolol group) and distensibility (P < .01 compared with the baseline value; P < .05 compared with the metoprolol group) was observed. The results show that lisinopril but not metoprolol improves arterial distensibility in essential hypertension. Pressure-independent effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may be important modulators of adaptive changes in the arterial wall.", 
    "74": "Seventeen male untreated mild essential hypertensive patients aged 41 +/- 2 years agreed to participate in a double-blind randomized trial to test the effects of antihypertensive treatment on the structure and function of subcutaneous resistance arteries. Patients were treated with either 50 to 100 mg/d atenolol or 2.5 to 5 mg/d cilazapril. Blood pressure before treatment was 148 +/- 6/99 +/- 1 and 147 +/- 2/99 +/- 1 mm Hg, respectively. At 1 year of treatment blood pressure was 131 +/- 4/85 +/- 2 and 132 +/- 2/87 +/- 1 mm Hg, respectively. Resistance arteries (200 to 400 microns lumen diameter) dissected from subcutaneous gluteal biopsies obtained before treatment and at 1 year showed that the media-lumen ratio of arteries from patients treated with cilazapril was reduced to 6.31 +/- 0.21% from 7.54 +/- 0.31% before treatment (P < .05), still slightly but significantly larger (P < .05) than the media-lumen ratio of resistance arteries of normotensive control subjects (5.15 +/- 0.30%). In contrast, in arteries from patients treated with atenolol there was no significant change with treatment (7.97 +/- 0.60% before and 8.07 +/- 0.45% after 1 year of treatment). Active wall tension responses to endothelin-1 were blunted in hypertensive patients and normalized in the cilazapril-treated patients. Depressed active media stress responses to norepinephrine, arginine vasopressin, and endothelin-1 were accordingly normalized in the patients receiving cilazapril as the media width became thinner but were unchanged in those taking atenolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "75": "Despite constant fluctuations in cardiac preload caused by the effects of respiration and changes in posture on venous return to the heart, arterial blood pressure remains remarkably constant. The effects of instantaneous lung volume (ILV) and variations of central venous pressure (CVP) on blood pressure (BP) were studied by use of frequency domain techniques to quantify the contribution of heart rate (HR) reflexes to attenuation of the effects of changes in right ventricular preload on arterial pressure.", 
    "76": "Random independent variation of ILV, then CVP (obtained using lower-body negative pressure), was performed in eight humans in the supine position. HR, ILV, CVP, and systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) BPs were recorded during control periods and after complete blockade obtained by use of 0.04 mg/kg atropine and 0.2 mg/kg propranolol. A frequency-domain analysis was performed on pairwise relations by the cross-spectral technique. During autonomic blockade, fluctuations in CVP were induced up to 0.14 Hz but caused corresponding changes in arterial pressure only up to 0.08 Hz (P < .02), indicating a mechanical damping effect of the heart and pulmonary vasculature. Fluctuations of BP were also delayed from CVP by 1.55 to 2.10 seconds. At frequencies < 0.1 Hz, relations of CVP to all indices of BP increased with blockade (CVP-SBP, 0.9 +/- 0.5 versus 2.7 +/- 0.8 mm Hg/mm Hg, P < .01; CVP-DBP, 1.3 +/- 0.4 versus 4.3 +/- 1.4 mm Hg/mm Hg, P < .01; CVP-pulse pressure [PP], 1.0 +/- 0.3 versus 1.9 +/- 0.8 mm Hg/mm Hg, P < .05). Higher-frequency fluctuations of arterial BP were a relatively pure manifestation of respiratory activity. At frequencies from 0.15 to 0.35 Hz, the relation of ILV to SBP was unchanged with blockade, whereas relations of ILV to DBP and PP decreased (ILV-DBP, 6.1 +/- 3.5 versus 3.3 +/- 2.2 mm Hg/L, P < .02; ILV-PP, 7.0 +/- 4.3 versus 2.7 +/- 2.2 mm Hg/L, P < .01). An associated change in phase of these relations suggested that neurally mediated changes in HR may offset mechanical effects caused by respiration.", 
    "77": "Both slow changes of BP (< 0.08 Hz) induced by variations of CVP and more rapid changes induced by ILV are actively buffered by heart rate reflexes. During blockade, the mechanical properties of interposed cardiopulmonary structures limit CVP-induced fluctuations of BP. These findings have implications for BP regulation in pathological conditions associated with impairment of HR control.", 
    "78": "A gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) of nifedipine has been developed to provide a once-daily dosing, and predictable, relatively constant plasma concentrations. This study compared the antianginal efficacy of nifedipine GITS with a once-a-day beta-receptor blocker, atenolol. Seventeen patients with documented coronary artery disease and stable stress-induced angina pectoris were studied during a 2-week, single-blind, placebo baseline phase and a 12-week randomized, double-blind, active drug crossover efficacy phase, using the bicycle exercise test and ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings. Patients exercised significantly longer with nifedipine GITS (883 +/- 47 seconds) and atenolol (908 +/- 44 seconds) than with placebo (794 +/- 41 seconds). Nifedipine GITS reduced systolic blood pressure at all stages of exercise compared with placebo but, because heart rate tended to increase more during nifedipine therapy, there was no difference in rate-pressure products between the placebo and nifedipine GITS periods. In contrast, atenolol reduced heart rate, systolic blood pressure and rate-pressure product during exercise compared with placebo. Whereas left ventricular ejection fractions (by radionuclide angiocardiography) increased with exercise, the maximal increase was smaller with atenolol than with placebo and nifedipine. The net increase in left ventricular ejection fraction at the end of exercise was greater with nifedipine than with placebo or atenolol. Ambulatory electrocardiograms showed only a small number of ischemic events. Neither nifedipine GITS nor atenolol reduced the number of ischemic events or total duration of ST-segment deviations significantly. It is concluded that nifedipine GITS is as effective an antianginal agent as atenolol, but the hemodynamic effects of the 2 agents differ.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "84": "The effect of 12-14 weeks streptozotocin-induced diabetes on contractile responses of the highly innervated caudal artery to adrenergic nerve stimulation was studied. The maximum contractile response and sensitivity (as reflected by the pD2 value) to noradrenaline (NA) was significantly greater in diabetic than in control caudal arteries. The maximum contractile response, but not sensitivity, to tyramine was significantly enhanced in diabetic compared with control caudal arteries when expressed as stress (mN/mm2), but not when expressed as a percentage of the maximum NA response obtained between the responses of control and diabetic caudal arteries to electrical field stimulation of adrenergic nerves, when expressed either as stress or as a percentage of the corresponding NA response. Pretreatment with phentolamine markedly inhibited the contractile responses to field stimulation of both diabetic and control caudal arteries, while 6-hydroxydopamine essentially abolished responses to electrical field stimulation and tyramine in both tissues. Finally, pretreatment with hydrocortisone, timolol, and desipramine increased sensitivity to NA in control and diabetic caudal arteries by a similar magnitude. Thus, the enhanced contractile responses of caudal arteries from diabetic rats to NA do not appear to be associated with the development of autonomic neuropathy.", 
    "85": "The effect of the nonsteroidal antiestrogen tamoxifen on carbachol (CCh)-triggered intracellular Ca2+ surges was determined in granulosa cells from the two largest preovulatory follicles of laying hens. The intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured in cells loaded with the Ca(2+)-responsive fluorescent dye fura-2. Resting [Ca2+]i was 96 +/- 5 nM (n = 20), and CCh (1 mM) triggered a large initial [Ca2+]i spike to 600-800 nM, due to the mobilization of Ca2+ from internal stores. Following the spike, the [Ca2+]i dropped to a lower, suprabasal level with super-imposed oscillations, which depended on Ca2+ influx, and returned to the resting level by 2 to 4 min. Tamoxifen (10 microM) did not by itself affect [Ca2+]i but pretreating granulosa cells with tamoxifen (10 microM) prolonged the CCh-triggered [Ca2+]i surge and oscillations by as much as 10 to 30 min. Pretreatment with much higher concentrations of tamoxifen (e.g., 0.5 mM) also had no effect by themselves, but caused a prolonged rise in [Ca2+]i following CCh (1 mM) stimulation. The effect of tamoxifen on CCh-triggered [Ca2+]i responses was mimicked by the tamoxifen metabolite 4-hydroxytamoxifen (10 microM), but not by the structurally related antiestrogens nafoxidine (10 microM) or clomiphene citrate (10 microM). The tamoxifen effect on the CCh-triggered [Ca2+]i response was not mediated through estrogen receptors since pretreating granulosa cells with 17 beta-estradiol (10(-6) M) did not mimic the tamoxifen response. The effect of tamoxifen was inhibited by pretreating granulosa cells with the Ca2+ channel blocker, lanthanum (1 mM), or by incubating the cells in Ca(2+)-free medium. Tamoxifen did not affect [Ca2+]i surges triggered by 17 beta-estradiol (10(-6) M) or dimethyl sulfoxide (1%) which mobilize Ca2+ from internal stores. Pretreating granulosa cells with tamoxifen (10 microM) or 4-hydroxytamoxifen (10 microM) before inducing Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels by depolarizing the cells with 45 mM external K+, caused a prolonged rise of [Ca2+]i, with oscillations, similar to the CCh response. These studies demonstrate that tamoxifen affects the activation of chicken granulosa cell Ca2+ channels by CCh or by raising the external K+ concentration, resulting in a prolongation of the sustained [Ca2+]i elevation and oscillations, which result from the influx of extracellular Ca2+. These observations suggest that tamoxifen interacts with open Ca2+ channels in chicken granulosa cells and keeps them open for prolonged periods of time.", 
    "86": "The effects of several compounds acting through adenylate cyclase system and/or influencing prostaglandin biosynthesis on spermine-FBS cytotoxicity to human myelogenous leukemia K562 cells were studied. Salbutamol, a beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist inhibited to a certain extent spermine-FBS cytotoxic action to K562 cells, and propranolol, a beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, did not affect this inhibition. Aminophylline, an inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, acted suppressing spermine-FBS cytotoxicity to K562 cells. Pretreatment of the cells with dexamethasone did not significantly alter salbutamol-related inhibition of spermine-FBS cytotoxicity. Indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenases directly involved in prostaglandin biosynthesis, did not interfere with protective terbutaline effects against spermine-FBS cytotoxicity to K562 cells during the 24-hour period.", 
    "87": "A new novel delivery system for ophthalmic drugs was developed using an antiglaucoma agent Betaxolol Hydrochloride as a model. The new delivery system involved both the binding and release of drug from ion exchange resin particles. Betaxolol was studied in-vitro via a release model analysis. The ocular comfort of Betaxolol was greatly enhanced by reducing the availability of free drug molecules in the precorneal tear film. The amount of resin concentration was selected to obtain optimum binding of the drug. The zeta potential of suspended particles was adjusted to produce flocculated suspension. Drug resin particles were then incorporated into the structured vehicle, containing Carbomer 934P as a polymer, to enhance the physical stability and ease of resuspendability of the product. This delivery system also optimized the bioavailability of Betaxolol, reducing the total drug concentration in half to 0.25% Betaxolol in 0.25% BETOPTIC S Ophthalmic Suspension as compared with 0.5% Betaxolol in BETOPTIC 0.5% Sterile Ophthalmic Solution dosage form. Increased comfort of 0.25% BETOPTIC S Ophthalmic Suspension, as well as its bioequivalency data in animal models (rabbits), was confirmed in actual clinical trials of the product 0.25% BETOPTIC S Ophthalmic Suspension. The 0.25% BETOPTIC S Ophthalmic Suspension product has been approved gamma FDA and is marketed in U. S. since February 1990. The 0.25% BETOPTIC S Ophthalmic Suspension formulation has an increased bioavailability (equivalent to BETOPTIC 0.5% Sterile Ophthalmic Solution at half the concentration of drug); and pharmaceutically, is an elegant suspension product which settles slowly providing uniform dosage and increased ocular comfort.", 
    "88": "In order to reduce the intraocular pressure antiglaucoma drugs must penetrate into the inner eye. Ocular bioavailability is determined by the ability of drug to penetrate through the cornea and conjunctiva/sclera, and on the other hand, by its elimination from the conjunctival sac. Major part of this elimination is by systemic drug absorption via conjunctiva. Typically conjunctival systemic absorption of drugs is an order of magnitude greater than their ocular absorption. In addition substantial systemic absorption of ophthalmic drugs takes place via nasal mucosa. Systemic absorption of antiglaucoma drugs like beta blocking agents may cause systemic side-effects. The risk of systemic side-effects might be decreased by increasing the ocular/systemic ratio of drug absorption. Several approaches can be used to improve ocular/systemic drug absorption ratio. Firstly, corneal drug permeability is improved. This can be done using different formulations or prodrug derivatives. Secondly, systemic absorption can be decreased e.g. with kinetic drug interactions or drug formulations. Thirdly, the rate of drug delivery can be changed thereby affecting especially the peak concentrations of drug in systemic circulation. Different methods for improvement of ocular delivery relative to the systemic absorption of antiglaucoma drugs are summarized and the impact of systemic pharmacokinetics on the viability of each approach is discussed.", 
    "89": "The antihypertensive effect of isradipine was studied in 45 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension (mean age 59 years) using casual and ambulatory 24-h blood pressure measurement. Patients were included into the study according to their casual blood pressure. Isradipine was started at a dose of 1.25 mg twice daily for 4 weeks, and increased to 2.5 mg twice daily if casual blood pressure was not normalized. If necessary, 3 mg of spirapril, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, (n = 1) or 5 mg of pindolol (n = 1) was added. The active-treatment period lasted 24 weeks. At the end of the therapy, casual blood pressure was significantly decreased (p < 0.001) from 173/103 to 150/86 mmHg, and mean ambulatory blood pressure, from 146/87 to 140/83 mmHg (p < 0.05). When patients were divided into three groups according to initial whole-day ambulatory blood pressure values (group I: < 140/90 mmHg; group II: > or = 140/90 mmHg; group III: > or = 140/<90 mmHg), no effect of treatment was detected in group I. However, whole-day blood pressure fell significantly (p < 0.001) in group II (155/96 vs 143/88 mmHg) as did systolic blood pressure (p < 0.01) in group III (150/83 vs 142/81 mmHg), whereas diastolic blood pressure remained unchanged. Thus, ambulatory blood pressure measurement may be superior to casual measurement in the decision-making process to treat hypertension, avoiding not only the phenomenon of 'white-coat hypertension', but also ineffective treatment. This conclusion, however, should be confirmed by prospective studies.", 
    "90": "The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics of propranolol in patients with hyperthyroidism, and its effect on heart rate (HR) using 24 hour-ECG monitoring. Subjects included 9 patients with hyperthyroidism (group H) and 9 euthyroid patients with hypertension selected as the control group (group C). All patients took propranolol at a dosage of 10 mg, 3 times a day for 7 days. Plasma propranolol concentrations were measured on the 7th day of its administration by the HPLC method. Twenty-four hour-ECG monitoring was recorded twice before and after treatment with propranolol. The mean reduction in the minimum HR was 10.7 +/- 3.6 (11.9 +/- 3.6%) in group H and 5.0 +/- 1.6 (9.5 +/- 3.0%) bpm in group C. That in the average HR was 12.2 +/- 3.7 (11.3 +/- 3.1%) in group H and 9.2 +/- 2.2 bpm (13.7 +/- 3.2%) in group C. That in the maximum HR was 16.9 +/- 5.2 (10.9 +/- 3.1%) in group H and 24.4 +/- 2.4 bpm (21.9 +/- 2.1%) in group C. The peak concentration of propranolol in plasma was 10.8 +/- 2.4 ng/ml in group H and 55.3 +/- 14.3 ng/ml in group C (p < 0.01). There was a linear correlation between the reduction in the hourly maximum heart rate and the peak plasma propranolol concentration in group H. Cardiovascular manifestations in hyperthyroid patients were related to sympathetic hypersensitivity and their improvement was not fully obtained by small doses of propranolol.", 
    "91": "This study tested the hypothesis that reduction in the hyperdynamic systemic circulation with propranolol in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and distal splenorenal shunt would lead to improved maintenance of portal perfusion. After standard distal splenorenal shunt, 50-75% of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis lose portal flow in 6-12 months: this is associated with an increased hyperdynamic systemic circulation. Twelve patients with alcoholic cirrhosis with distal splenorenal shunt received propranolol in a dose sufficient to provide beta blockade. Pulse was reduced by 25%, cardiac output reduced by 32% and hepatic venous pressure gradient reduced by 15% (p < 0.05). These significant hemodynamic changes with propranolol did not lead to any improvement in the maintenance of portal perfusion: overall, 66% of patients lost prograde portal flow within 1 year. We conclude that the hyperdynamic systemic circulation is not the primary mediator of loss of portal perfusion in this group of patients. Rather, it appears that differences in either intrahepatic resistance or collateral pathway (portal vein to shunt) resistance must account for the different patterns or maintenance of portal perfusion after distal splenorenal shunt.", 
    "92": "Pharmacological therapy of cardiac arrhythmias continues to evolve, with an increasing shift from class I to class III compounds and beta-blockers. This is engendered by increasing concern that class I antiarrhythmic drugs might adversely affect mortality in patients with significant structural heart disease. The focus now is on complex molecules such as amiodarone and sotalol, as well as D-sotalol and structurally diverse newer class III agents (such as dofetilide, MK-499, ibutilide, almokalant, and MS-551 among many others), which act only by increasing the time course of myocardial repolarization. In the development of newer drugs, the main endpoint in clinical trials is also beginning to shift to mortality from surrogate endpoints such as those determined by Holter monitoring and programmed electrical stimulation. The advent of implantable devices allows the performance of clinical trials with a mortality endpoint in patients with manifest ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation while providing an alternative mode of therapy for these arrhythmias. In the case of manifest ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation and aborted sudden death, adequately designed, controlled trials can now be undertaken by the use of implantable devices. In such trials, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators may serve in lieu of the placebo arm of a randomized trial. Trials involving a comparison of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and best medical therapy (for the present, amiodarone and sotalol) are currently in progress. To what extent the newer class III agents will meet the requirements of an ideal antifibrillatory agent that reduces mortality in patients with structural heart disease remains a continuing investigative challenge.", 
    "93": "We investigated the involvement of alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtypes in the positive chronotropic response to norepinephrine (NE) in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes at day 3 of culture. The cardiac myocytes at day 3 of culture exhibited a dose-dependent positive chronotropic response to NE in the presence of propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. The positive chronotropic responses to NE were completely antagonized by the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin. The NE-induced positive chronotropic response was inhibited 68% by the alpha 1B-adrenoceptor antagonist, chloroethylclonidine (CEC), but partially (41%) so by the alpha 1A-adrenoceptor antagonist, WB4101. In the membrane fraction derived from cardiac myocytes at day 3 of culture, pretreatment with CEC decreased the Bmax of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor to 22% of the control value. The NE-induced positive chronotropic response was inhibited 62 and 77% by the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel blocker such as nifedipine and verapamil, respectively. These findings indicate (1) that cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes possess both alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtypes, i.e., alpha 1A and alpha 1B, (2) that the predominant alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtypes mediating NE-induced positive chronotropy in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes at day 3 of culture are alpha 1B-subtypes, and (3) that NE-induced positive chronotropy may be caused via voltage-gated Ca2+ channel activation.", 
    "94": "The mitosis inhibitory pentapeptide, pGlu-Glu-Asp-Ser-GlyOH (EPP), which was isolated from mouse epidermis extracts, belongs to a group of growth inhibitory peptides that all have pyroglutamyl at the N-terminal end. Earlier experiments with crude or partially purified skin extracts have shown that the inhibitory effect could be enhanced by beta-receptor agonists and by dibutyryl cAMP, and that beta-receptor blockade could neutralise it. We now show that treatment with the beta receptor blocker propranolol before or after EPP treatment of hairless mice significantly modifies the effect of EPP on mouse epidermal cell proliferation, as estimated by using a metaphase-arrest technique (Colcemid) to estimate the G2-M cell flux. The interaction between propranolol and EPP is complex; only the EPP-induced inhibition of the G2-M cell flux was modified by beta-receptor blockade, while the late (18-21 h) inhibition of the mitotic rate was unaltered. Propranolol alone was followed by a dose-related and transient increase in the epidermal mitotic rate. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor caffeine had no effect on its own on epidermal cell proliferation but counter-acted the late (18-21 h) EPP-induced inhibition.", 
    "95": "Thirty-seven male alcoholics admitted electively for detoxification were randomized to treatment with either diazepam or propranolol. Subjects were comparable both in age and in duration and quantity of alcohol consumed. Admission laboratory parameters did not distinguish between the groups. Eleven subjects required no medication to control withdrawal signs/symptoms. Both groups showed improvement in blood pressure, pulse, and withdrawal tremor. None of the subjects randomized to diazepam manifested withdrawal seizures or hallucinations. By contrast, one subject in the propranolol group had a single withdrawal seizure. Another subject manifested increasing withdrawal that required parenteral paraldehyde treatment. Thus, this study confirms that a significant number of subjects admitted electively for alcohol withdrawal can be managed without medication. Minor tranquilizers still remain the \"gold standard\" for management of the withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "96": "Adrenaline, which is secreted from the adrenal medulla during stress, is considered to be involved in the control of inflammation and immune responses. Therefore, we studied the effects of adrenaline on the plasma levels of one of the major pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-6 (IL-6). Here we describe that in rats, SC administration of adrenaline induces a dose-dependent increase in plasma IL-6 concentrations, reaching its maximum after 2 h. In addition, intravenous (IV) infusion of adrenaline in a dose resulting in circulating adrenaline concentrations similar to those observed during stress, enhanced heart rate and increased plasma IL-6 concentrations. The increase in plasma IL-6 in response to adrenaline given by subcutaneous (SC) route and by IV infusion could be blocked by the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist l-propranolol but not by d-propranolol. Based on these data we conclude that under physiological conditions circulating adrenaline may be involved in the control of IL-6 production, and thereby may modulate inflammatory responses.", 
    "97": "Betaxolol, a long-acting cardioselective beta-blocker, was tested alone and in combination with long-acting nitrates in a multicenter, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study of 3 weeks duration in patients with stable angina pectoris. All patients underwent exercise tolerance tests (ETTs) using Bruce's protocol. During the 3- to 4-week single-blind placebo baseline phase, all other drugs except sublingual nitroglycerin and long-acting nitrates were withdrawn. Those patients (n = 115) whose time to onset of moderate angina was between 2.5 and 7.5 min and was within +/- 15% in 2 consecutive ETTs were randomized to betaxolol 20 mg/day (n = 54) or placebo (n = 53). Betaxolol, compared to placebo, increased time to onset of angina, time to 1 mm S-T segment depression, and total exercise time and decreased the double product, weekly anginal attacks, and sublingual nitroglycerin consumption (p < 0.01). Our results indicate that betaxolol given in fixed 20-mg daily doses was efficacious in stable angina pectoris and its combination with long-acting nitrates potentiated its effect.", 
    "98": "Atrioventricular (AV) conduction time varies on a beat-by-beat basis in response to the influences of cardiac efferent autonomic activity and rate-dependent electrical recovery processes. The goals of this study were to distinguish these effects on AV conduction time and to compare the variability in sinoatrial and AV nodal function.", 
    "99": "The PR interval on the surface ECG served as an index of AV conduction time in this study of 14 adult human subjects undergoing a random interval breathing protocol. P and R waves were located by a template-matching algorithm. Spectral analysis allowed frequency-domain comparisons between PR and RR interval variability. Spectra of PR and RR intervals had similar power distributions, although the power of the RR interval spectra was much greater. Autonomic blockade with atropine plus propranolol reduced the power of both spectra. Standing significantly decreased the spectral power from 0.15 to 0.5 Hz for PR and RR spectra, and introduced a peak near 0.1 Hz in the mean PR and RR spectra, although the latter finding was significant only for the RR interval spectra. Propranolol had no significant effects on the PR and RR interval spectra. Linear regression analysis allowed quantification of the autonomic and recovery effects on AV conduction and showed which effect predominated. Simple linear regression confirmed in adults a previous finding in children that conduction time may be either positively or negatively correlated with cycle length. By multiple regression and transfer function analysis, the inverse relation seen in some subjects was attributed to the effect of recovery from the preceding cycle. With the preceding recovery period accounted for, the conduction time and cycle length of the current beat were positively correlated, presumably due to the parallel autonomic effects on the sinoatrial and AV nodes. The magnitude of the recovery effect predicted by the regression analysis was similar to published values.",

    "101": "In a new series of milrinone analogues (esters of 2-substituted 5-acetyl-1,6-dihydro-6-oxo-3-pyridinecarboxylic acids), ethyl 5-acetyl-1,6-dihydro-6-oxo-2-phenyl-3-pyridinecarboxylate (compound 2f) has been found to be more potent and more effective than milrinone as a positive inotropic agent while affecting only marginally the frequency rate of guinea-pig isolated atria. This finding prompted us to study the mechanism of cardiac action of compound 2f in electrically driven left atrium from reserpine-treated guinea pigs. Compound 2f induced a statistically significant increase in the contractile force at a concentration as low as 1 microM, while the minimum effective concentration of milrinone was 10 microM. The beta-blocker propranolol (0.1 microM) caused a marked inhibition of the inotropic effect of compound 2f. Adenosine deaminase (1 and 2 U/ml) inhibited significantly and in a concentration-dependent manner the increase in inotropism induced by compound 2f and the adenosine deaminase-resistant response was abolished by 0.1 microM propranolol. In the presence of 0.1 microM propranolol, compound 2f (5 to 30 microM) antagonised in competitive manner the negative inotropic effect induced by N6-(R-phenylisopropyl) adenosine (R-PIA) (0.01-1.0 microM), a stable adenosine receptor agonist. Schild regression analysis gave in fact a slope of 1.02 +/- 0.06 and the pA2 value for compound 2f was 5.41 +/- 0.28. Compound 2f also inhibited phosphodiesterase (PDE) III isolated from calf heart, this inhibition being quantitatively significant only at the highest concentrations tested (0.5 M to 1 mM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "102": "Through co-expression of the human beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic receptors in a single tester cell (the murine L fibroblast) and through assaying the effect of the beta 1 and beta 2 selective blockers CGP 20712A and ICI 118551 on isoproterenol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase, it is shown that the maximal stimulation achievable with a given cell density of beta 1 adrenergic receptor is less than that obtained with the same density of the beta 2 adrenergic receptor. It is concluded that the efficacy of the 2 receptors differs in that the beta 1 adrenergic receptor has a lower efficacy (or intrinsic activity) than does the beta 2 adrenergic receptor.", 
    "103": "Delirium in 3 elderly patients with recent cerebral infarction and pre-existing brain dysfunction receiving low dose propranolol is described. The dose ranged from 30 to 60 mg/day and the interval between delirium onset and drug initiation was 3-7 days. One patient exhibited ictal mydriasis and sinus tachycardia. Hypoalbuminemia was found in 1 patient. Discontinuation of propranolol abolished their delirious pictures 2-5 days later. Their delirium may be attributed to central beta blockade or anticholinergic effect. Preexisting brain damage, old age and hypoalbuminemia may predispose such patients to neuropharmacotoxicity of low dose propranolol.", 
    "104": "The HIB 1B cell line, derived from a brown fat tumor of a transgenic mouse, is the first established brown adipocyte cell line capable of expressing the brown fat-specific mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP). UCP gene expression, which was virtually undetectable under basic conditions, was stimulated by acute catecholamine or cyclic AMP treatment to levels comparable to primary cultures of brown adipocytes. Elevation of UCP mRNA levels following stimulation was very rapid but transient, decreasing after about 4 hours with a half-life between 9 and 13 hours. Immunoblotting showed the presence of UCP in HIB 1B mitochondria, but expression was much lower than observed in BAT or primary cultures of brown adipocytes. Upon transfection of HIB 1B cells with a reporter gene containing the UCP promoter, the activity of the transgene was regulatable by cAMP and norepinephrine. Investigation of the possible adrenergic receptors involved in UCP stimulation showed that specific beta 3-adrenergic agonists were much less effective than nonspecific beta-adrenergic agonists and that mRNA levels of the atypical, fat-specific beta 3-adrenoceptor were lower than those observed in brown adipocytes differentiated in primary culture. From pharmacological evidence we conclude that beta 3-adrenergic receptors account for approximately 30-40% of catecholamine induced UCP gene stimulation, whereas about 60-70% is stimulated via the classical beta 1/2 adrenergic pathway. We conclude that HIB 1B cells represent a functional system for the study of mechanisms related to brown adipose thermogenesis.", 
    "105": "The distribution of inhibitory nerves and the mediator of the inhibitory nonadrenergic noncholinergic (iN-ANC) nervous system were investigated in smooth muscle preparations from seven regions of equine airways. In tissues incubated with atropine and precontracted with histamine, electrical field stimulation produced frequency-dependent relaxation, and the magnitude of the relaxation decreased from trachea to central bronchi and was absent in peripheral airways. The degree of relaxation in bronchi was not simply a function of bronchial size or generation. Propranolol inhibited part of the relaxation only in the cranial trachealis. After propranolol, NG-nitro-L-arginine, a nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, eliminated the remaining relaxation in all preparations. This effect was reversed by L-arginine, the NO precursor, but not by D-arginine. Exogenous NO concentration dependently relaxed trachealis. These results indicate that: 1) adrenergic innervation is limited to cranial trachealis, 2) iNANC nerves supply the trachea and central bronchi, and 3) NO mediates iNANC function.", 
    "106": "The aims of our study were 3-fold: (1) to determine the effect of an acute cold pressor test on vagally stimulated gastric acid secretion, (2) to evaluate whether adrenergic blockers are able to prevent the stress-induced alterations of vagally stimulated gastric acid secretion, and (3) to assess the effect of stress and adrenergic blockers on serum levels of vagally stimulated pancreatic polypeptide and gastrin. Twenty-eight studies were carried out on 7 healthy subjects, each one of them being evaluated on four separate occasions. Active (4 degrees C) or control (37 degrees C) cold pressor tests were applied in random order after an interval of 15 min following completion of a vagal stimulation represented by modified sham feeding. Each stressful stimulus was preceded by an intravenous bolus plus an infusion of either adrenergic blockers (propranolol and phentolamine) or placebo. Modified sham feeding significantly stimulated gastric acid secretion and circulating hormonal levels, compared to basal values. Cold pressor test significantly stimulated gastric acid secretion 30 min after the beginning of the stressful stimulus. This stress-induced secretory response was completely prevented by infusions of adrenergic blockers. No effect was induced by stressful stimuli or by adrenergic blockers on human pancreatic polypeptide and gastrin circulating levels. The present study demonstrates that the cold pressor test induces a late increase of vagally stimulated gastric acid secretion suggesting a possible role mediated by adrenergic neural pathways.", 
    "107": "Functional roles of adrenoceptors in parietal cells were pharmacologically investigated using isolated canine parietal cells. In the crude membranes obtained from preparations highly purified in parietal cells (> 95% of purity), the specific binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) was observed with a Kd value of 2.9 nM and Bmax of 234 fmol/mg protein, while the specific binding of [3H]prazosin and [3H]rauwolscine were not attained. Propranolol concentration-dependently reduced the specific binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol with a Ki value of 2.6 nM. Isoproterenol concentration-dependently stimulated [14C]aminopyrine accumulation in preparations enriched in parietal cells (about 70% purity) with the maximum at 10 nM. Isoproterenol increased the content of cyclic AMP in preparations enriched in parietal cells (70%) with the maximum at 100 nM. The isoproterenol-induced stimulatory effect of [14C]aminopyrine accumulation in preparations enriched in parietal cells (70%) was completely abolished by 1 microM propranolol but not by 1 microM phentolamine. In the presence of 1 microM propranolol, 100 microM noradrenaline did not affect carbachol- and histamine-induced [14C]aminopyrine accumulation in preparations enriched in parietal cells (70%). The present study suggests that stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors located on canine parietal cells evokes acid production in a cyclic-AMP-dependent manner. Furthermore, a possibility arises that canine parietal cells are not the site of action of alpha-adrenoceptors in mediating inhibition of gastric acid secretion.", 
    "108": "The effect of in vitro treatment of serum with the alkylating agents carmustine (BCNU) and mechlorethamine on the protein binding of penbutolol, a basic agent mainly bound to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG), was investigated. The free fraction of penbutolol increased significantly (P < 0.001) after the treatment of serum with BCNU (5.27+ +/- 0.47%) and with mechlorethamine (5.23% +/- 0.17%), being 1.98% +/- 0.18% in serum not treated with BCNU or mechlorethamine. In addition, after incubation with BCNU (2 h), the free fraction of penbutolol continued increasing (10.96% +/- 0.70% vs 5.27% +/- 0.47% at time 0; P < 0.001), whereas it remained unchanged after incubation with mechlorethamine. Moreover, dialysis against saline for 24 h did not restore the free fraction of penbutolol, which increased after treatment with carmustine (9.05% +/- 1.24% vs. 11.04% +/- 1.55%, nondialyzed). We concluded that the treatment of cancer patients with alkylating agents could alter the serum proteins and modify their binding capacity, and this should be taken into account in the simultaneous treatment of these patients with other basic drugs like penbutolol, e.g., methadone.", 
    "109": "Previous studies have compared the outcome between patients with and without a confirmed acute myocardial infarction (AMI) mainly during the first few years after its onset. Our aim was to compare the prognosis between patients with and without a confirmed AMI during 10 years of follow-up. Patients participating in an early intervention trial with metoprolol in suspected AMI between 1976 and 1981 took part in this evaluation. The total 10-year mortality rate including hospital mortality was 51% for patients with confirmed AMI as compared with 32% for patients with a possible AMI and 23% for patients in whom AMI was definitely ruled out (p < 0.001). The 10-year mortality after discharge from hospital was in AMI 46%, possible AMI 32% and in definitely ruled out AMI 23% (p < 0.001). When simultaneously considering age, sex, previous history of cardiovascular disease and smoking, the development of AMI appeared as an independent predictor of death (p < 0.001). Thus, among patients hospitalized due to suspected AMI, 10-year mortality after discharge from hospital was directly related to the diagnosis during the first 3 days in hospital.", 
    "110": "A case of cardiomyopathy secondary to an unrecognised pheochromocytoma is reported. It was cured by successful outset with congestive cardiac failure with an ejection fraction of 11%. Following medical treatment including a beta-blocker and converting enzyme inhibitors, the situation remained so disturbing that cardiac transplant was envisaged. It was nevertheless decided to first remove the tumour, with mechanical circulatory assistance cover if necessary. Surgical excision proved to be relatively easy. Cardiac failure disappeared clinically within a few days, though a degree of myocardial impairment revealed by paraclinical investigations persisted after ten months. The pathophysiology, beneficial effect of beta-blockers and the SvO2 usefulness blood during the perioperative period are discussed. The prognosis of the cardiomyopathy, considered up to the present to be uncertain, new seems favourable once it is possible to completely excise the tumour.", 
    "111": "Dominant behaviour and testosterone level were investigated after adrenoreceptor (AR) blocking drugs injections in PT and CBA/Lac mice predisposed, correspondingly, to dominant and subordinate behaviour in a population and their hybrids F1. Phentolamine (alpha-AR blocker, 1 mg/kg) or obsidan (beta-AR blocker, 1 mg/kg) injections resulted in a loss of the dominant rank of CBA/Lac mice and did not affect the PT mice behaviour. Higher doses (2 and 5 mg/kg) were also ineffective. Simultaneous phentolamine and obsidan injections (1 mg/kg) caused a dominant phenotype inversion, decrease of aggression and testosterone level in PT mice. F1 inherited an ability to dominate in a population and a sensitivity of AR form PT inbred strain. Their behaviour and endocrine characteristics after injections of AR-blockers were close to those of PT mice.", 
    "112": "Neurochemical cellular mechanisms of central organization of the consecutive stages of formation of a goal-directed behavioural act were studied in cats by means of microiontophoretic application of biologically active substances. Chemical characteristics of single cortical neurons varied at different stages of behavioural act. Dynamics of spike activity at these stages changed in opposite directions during application of neurotransmitters and their antagonists. The differences were more expressed during propranolol and atropine than during noradrenaline and acetylcholine application.", 
    "113": "Patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction to general medical wards fared less well than those admitted over the same period to the coronary care unit. The median age of the 119 patients admitted to the general wards was 75 years, compared to 64 years for those on the coronary care unit. Although 13 of the 119 fulfilled the local guidelines for thrombolysis, none received it, only 64% were given aspirin and 49% nitrates. The death rate for these patients was 29% compared to 12% of those given thrombolysis on the coronary care unit and 26% of those who were ineligible for thrombolysis but had been admitted to the coronary care unit. Of the survivors on the general wards, 80% were given aspirin as secondary prevention, and 37% were given a beta-adrenergic blocker. None was referred to the hospital cardiac rehabilitation programme.", 
    "114": "1. Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy has been implicated in the reduction of baroreflex sensitivity present in hypertension. The aim of the current study was to investigate the mean arterial pressure-heart rate reflex (MAP-HR) in a model which induced left ventricular hypertrophy but no sustained blood pressure elevation. 2. Five mongrel dogs were exposed to transient blood pressure elevation of between 20 and 30 mmHg, through hindlimb compression using a pneumatic pressure suit, for 7 h per day, 6 days per week for 6 weeks. Resting blood pressure was not altered by the 6 week hindlimb compression intervention. 3. Echocardiographically determined LV mass (mean +/- s.e.m.) was 116.0 +/- 7.4 g prior to hindlimb compression (baseline) and elevated to 125.4 +/- 8.1 g (P = 0.003) after 6 weeks of compression. A reduction in the early (E) to late (A) transmitral diastolic flow ratio (E/A) from 1.80 +/- 0.06 at baseline to 1.54 +/- 0.09 (P = 0.037) after the 6 week intervention suggested that cardiac compliance was reduced. 4. The maximum gain of the MAP-HR reflex, studied using the 'steady-state' drug technique, when blood pressure was normal, showed a trend for reduction from 3.85 +/- 0.43 beats/min per mmHg at baseline to 3.10 +/- 0.45 beats/min per mmHg (P = 0.067) after 6 weeks of compression. This gain reduction became significant after beta-adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol (3.13 +/- 0.55 vs 2.32 +/- 0.25 beats/min per mmHg; P = 0.039). Covariant analysis showed a significant inverse correlation between LV mass and maximum gain (r = 0.96; P < 0.001) during the 6 week compression period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "115": "To better define the mechanism of the increased plasma concentration of propranolol (PL) after meals, the effect of the dietary constitution of a meal on the kinetics of PL and beta-naphthoxylactic acid (NLA), a main metabolite, after administration of the drug, was investigated in rats. Additionally, the hepatic uptake of PL and cytochrome P-450 (P-450) content and uridine 5'-diphosphoglucuronyltransferase (UDPGT) activity in liver were measured after glucose intake. As a result, protein (skim milk) intake slightly, but not significantly, increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and bioavailability of PL, with a slight increase (16%) in hepatic blood flow, and enhanced PL metabolism to NLA. Soybean oil and fatty acid intake significantly decreased the bioavailability of PL, while glucose intake dramatically decreased the hepatic uptake of PL and P-450 content at high glucose levels, resulting in a decrease in the plasma PL concentration at the initial time period and in the inhibition of a metabolic conversion to NLA. Thus, a possible mechanism involved in the effect of food on PL bioavailability could have been due largely to the decreased microsomal P-450 content and hepatic uptake of PL after glucose intake, but only partly to the increased hepatic blood flow after protein intake."
