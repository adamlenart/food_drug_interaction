    "0": "To determine if enflurane has different effects on myocardial sensitivity to adrenaline than those previously reported for halothane, we have studied the enflurane-adrenaline interaction in isolated canine trabeculae using doses of adrenaline necessary to produce slow responses (adrenaline threshold for the development of slow responses, ATSR) as an indicator. The preparations were depolarized in Tyrode's solution containing potassium chloride 26 mmol litre-1, then adrenaline concentrations in the solution were increased stepwise. Enflurane 1% had no significant effect, but 2% and 4% significantly increased the ATSR two-fold and seven-fold, respectively. To investigate the influence of enflurane on the adrenaline-adrenoceptor interaction, we studied the effects on the ATSR of 2% enflurane alone or in combination with either prazosin 8 ng ml-1 or metoprolol 17 ng ml-1. Compared with the ATSR obtained with 2% enflurane alone, alpha 1-block with prazosin did not alter, but beta 1-block with metoprolol significantly increased the ATSR (three-fold). These effects on enflurane are qualitatively as well as quantitatively similar to those reported previously for halothane. Thus, assuming that the MAC value for enflurane is about 2-2.5 times greater than that for halothane, the effects of enflurane on slow channel conductance (antiarrhythmic effects of enflurane) might be about two to three times greater than those of halothane at equivalent depth of anaesthesia. Such differences may explain in part the clinical observation that ventricular arrhythmias are less likely with enflurane than with halothane.", 
    "1": "We investigated the usefulness of a liposome composed of lipid components of stratum corneum as a system to evaluate the enhancing ability of various penetration enhancers. Changes in the lipid fluidity of the model lipid liposome membrane, consisting of ceramide (40%), cholesterol (25%), palmitic acid (25%) and cholesterol 3-sulfate (10%), by the addition of 1-dodecylazacycloheptan-2-one (Azone), oleic acid (OA) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were measured by a fluorescence polarization method using 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene, dansylhexadecylamine and cholesteryl anthracene-9-carboxylate as probes for the hydrophobic lipid, the polar head and cholesterol regions of the lipid bilayer, respectively. The order of lipid fluidizing ability was suggested to be Azone > OA > DMSO. An in vitro permeation study of six beta-blocking agents, propranolol, metoprolol, timolol, pindolol, nadolol and atenolol, was carried out to estimate the enhancing effect of the enhancers using rat abdominal skin. Azone showed a strong facilitating effect on the drug permeation and the effect of OA was weaker than that of Azone. DMSO showed little effect unless a high concentration of over 60% (w/v) was employed. The basis for these enhancing mechanisms is the change in diffusion constant of a drug in the rat skin. These results were consistent with those obtained from the lipid fluidity measurement, that is to say, the stronger the increment effect of the enhancer on the fluidity of the model lipid liposome is, the larger is the D value for the drug in the skin. Applicability of the model lipid liposome in evaluating the penetration enhancer was thus demonstrated.", 
    "2": "We examined the long-term cost effectiveness of treating hypertensive patients aged 47 to 65 yrs with agents that promote regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and ACE inhibitors were compared with standard therapy. To estimate the effect of drug therapy on LVH regression, we pooled data from 25 studies. We estimated the effects of LVH regression on cardiovascular outcomes using Framingham data and the studies of Devereux. The estimated costs of differing treatment strategies included average costs of drug therapy and follow-up care, and direct costs of lost productivity owing to untoward outcomes. Patients were classified by initial left ventricular mass index (LVMI) as low (< 95 g/m2), moderate (95-125 g/m2) and high risk (> 125 g/m2). The data suggested that all three agents reduce LVMI in moderate- and high-risk groups. The respective average reductions in LVMI in high risk and moderate risk were 20% and 12% for ACE inhibitors, 18% and 8% for beta-blockers, and 5% and 6% for calcium channel blockers. We estimated the relative improvement in cardiovascular morbidity/mortality from LVH reversal required for overall cost savings with each drug class compared with a standard regimen. Patients treated with calcium channel blockers needed to realise at least 72% of the expected reduction in cardiovascular outcomes from LVH regression for this strategy to be less costly. For ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, only 32% and 26%, respectively, of the expected reduction in poor outcomes from LVH reversal were required for these agents to be more cost effective. Long-term costs of treatment with ACE inhibitors versus beta-blockers were similar. A 25% higher treatment cost of ACE inhibitors was offset by a greater effectiveness in reversing LVH with attendant lower rates of cardiovascular complications.", 
    "3": "Calcium-channel blockers have been shown to be both safe and effective for treatment of patients with systemic hypertension. These drugs reduce peripheral vascular resistance predominantly by the inhibition of transmembrane calcium ion fluxes in vascular smooth muscle, and by this mechanism can reduce elevated blood pressure. To maximize blood pressure lowering efficacy in patients, calcium-channel blockers have also been used in combination with other antihypertensive treatments that have included diuretics, beta-adrenergic blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "4": "1. Experiments were performed to characterize the effects of the novel brown adipocyte stimulant, ICI D7114, in the guinea-pig isolated ileum, right atrium and tracheal chain. In the ileum, agonist-induced inhibition of the contractile response to either histamine or prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was assessed, along with effects on resting rate in the atrium and resting tone in the tracheal chain. In the latter two preparations, antagonism of isoprenaline-induced responses by ICI D7114 was also assessed. 2. Inhibitory responses were obtained in the ileum to ICI D7114, isoprenaline, BRL37344, and noradrenaline. The responses to ICI D7114, isoprenaline and BRL37344 were resistant to blockade with propranolol (5 microM), naloxone (1 microM), methysergide (0.1 microM), cimetidine, indomethacin and 8-phenyltheophylline (all 10 microM). These responses to isoprenaline, in the presence of propranolol (5 microM), were competitively antagonized by alprenolol (1-100 microM) with a pA2 value of 6.44. The responses to ICI D7114 and BRL37344 were antagonized by single concentrations of alprenolol (1 microM) with apparent pKB values of 6.53 and 6.57 respectively. These data indicate an effect of ICI D7114 at the atypical beta-adrenoceptor in the guinea-pig ileum. 3. The order and relative potency of agonists at the atypical beta-adrenoceptor was BRL37344 (4) < isoprenaline (1) = ICI D7114 (1.1) > noradrenaline (0.5). 4. ICI D7114 (1 nM - 10 microM) caused no significant change in the rate of beating or the resting tone of the guinea-pig right atrium or tracheal chain respectively. It did, however, cause selective blockade of the responses to isoprenaline in these tissues (apparent pKB values 7.63 and 5.85 in atrium and tracheal chain respectively). Responses to histamine (atrium) and aminophylline (tracheal chain) were not significantly affected by 10 microM ICI D7114.5. These results demonstrate that ICI D7114 possesses selective agonist activity at atypical beta-adrenoceptors in the guinea-pig ileum and its use as a tool may help to establish a role for the atypical beta-adrenoceptor in the control of gastrointestinal motility.", 
    "5": "1. The beta-adrenoceptor population was characterized in membrane preparations from rat brown adipose tissue (BAT) and from soleus muscle by use of the radioligand [125I]-iodocyanopindolol ([125I]-ICYP). In addition, atypical binding sites for [125I]-ICYP found in both tissues were examined, and the relationship between these sites and the putative rat beta 3-adrenoceptor is discussed. 2. It was established that BAT membranes host a mixed population of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors. Of these two sites, 55% showed a high affinity for the beta 1-selective ligand CGP 20712A (pK 8.5), and 45% showed a high affinity for the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118551 (pK 8.6). Soleus muscle membranes were found to host a population of beta 2-adrenoceptors, characterized by a high affinity for ICI 118551 (pK 9.1), but beta 1-adrenoceptors could not be detected in this preparation. 5-Hydroxytryptamine receptors were not detected in either preparation. 3. In addition to beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors, atypical binding sites were identified in both tissues using high concentrations of radioligand (0.5-0.6 nM) and in the presence of 1 microM (-)-propranolol. The atypical sites were abundant, representing 80 and 81% of the total [125I]-ICYP binding sites in BAT and soleus muscle respectively. When the pK values for 11 ligands were compared, the correlation coefficient for atypical sites in BAT and soleus muscle was 0.94. 4. The atypical binding sites showed a moderate affinity for (+/-)-cyanopindolol (pK 7.3-7.7), poor stereo selectivity for the (+)- and (-)-enantiomers of alprenolol (<10 fold), and a low affinity for B-adrenoceptor antagonists and partial agonists in the order: (+/-)-cyanopindolol>(-)-alprenolol>(-)-propranolol=(+/-)-ICI 118551>(+/-)-CGP20712A. The affinity of these ligands for the atypical sites reflects their behaviour in functional studies of putative beta 3-adrenoceptors in rat BAT, white adipose tissue, intestine and colon.5. The atypical sites labelled by [125I]-ICYP were resistant to agonist binding, and while the order of affinity of the agonists BRL 37344> isoprenaline> noradrenaline matches their order of potency at putative beta 3-adrenoceptors, none of these compounds caused displacement of the radioligand at concentrations below 10 microM.6. It is concluded that the atypical binding sites for [125I]-ICYP found in rat BAT and soleus muscle membranes are the same, and that these sites show some relationship to the putative rat beta 3-adrenoceptor identified in functional studies using antagonists. However, under the conditions used in the present study, pK values obtained for beta 3-agonist binding are not useful.", 
    "6": "1. Studies of mechanical activity and 86Rb+ efflux have been made in bovine isolated trachealis with the objectives of: (a) identifying which of the beta-adrenoceptor subtypes mediates the opening of plasmalemmal K(+)-channels, (b) gaining further insight into the properties of the novel, long-acting beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, salmeterol and (c) clarifying the role of K(+)-channel opening in mediating the mechano-inhibitory actions of agonists at beta-adrenoceptors. 2. In bovine trachealis muscle strips precontracted with histamine (460 microM), isoprenaline (0.1 nM-1 microM), procaterol (0.1-10 nM) and salmeterol (0.1-10 nM) each caused concentration-dependent relaxation. 3. ICI 118551 (10 nM-1 microM) antagonized isoprenaline, procaterol and salmeterol in suppressing histamine-induced tone of the isolated trachealis muscle. The antagonism was concentration-dependent. In contrast, CGP 20712A (10 nM-1 microM) failed to antagonize isoprenaline, procaterol or salmeterol. 4. Salmeterol (1-10 microM) antagonized isoprenaline in relaxing strips of bovine trachea which had been precontracted with carbachol (1 microM). 5. Cromakalim (10 microM), isoprenaline (100 nM-10 microM), procaterol (10 nM-1 microM) and salbutamol (100 nM-10 microM) each promoted the efflux of 86Rb+ from strips of bovine trachealis muscle preloaded with the radiotracer. In contrast, salmeterol (100 nM-10 microM) failed to promote 86Rb+ efflux. 6. CGP 201712A (1 microM), ICI 118551 (100 nM) and salmeterol (1 microM) did not themselves modify 86Rb+ efflux from trachealis muscle strips, nor did they affect the promotion of 86Rb+ efflux induced by cromakalim (10 microM). In contrast, CGP 20712A (1 microM) and ICI 118551 (100nM) were each able to inhibit the promotion of 86Rb+ efflux induced by isoprenaline (1 microM) or procaterol (100 nM). Furthermore,salmeterol (10 microM) inhibited isoprenaline (1 microM)-induced promotion of 86Rb+ efflux.7. It is concluded that, in bovine trachealis, activation of either beta l- or beta 2-adrenoceptors can promote the opening of 86Rb+-permeable K+-channels in the plasmalemma. The failure of salmeterol to promote plasmalemmal K+-channel opening may reflect, not its selectivity in activating beta 2- as opposed to beta 1-adrenoceptors, but rather its low intrinsic efficacy at beta 2-adrenoceptors. The opening of plasmalemmal K+-channels plays a supportive rather than a crucial role in mediating the mechano-inhibitory effects of agonists at beta-adrenoceptors acting on trachealis muscle.", 
    "7": "1. Mechanical and electrophysiological studies of guinea-pig isolated trachealis have been made with the objectives of: (a) identifying which of the beta-adrenoceptor subtypes mediates the opening of plasmalemmal K(+)-channels, (b) gaining further insight into the properties of the novel, long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist, salmeterol and (c) clarifying the role of K(+)-channel opening in mediating the relaxant actions of agonists at beta-adrenoceptors. 2. Noradrenaline (10 nM-100 microM) caused a concentration-dependent increase in the rate of beating of guinea-pig isolated atria. The selective beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking drug, CGP 20712A (100 nM-10 microM) caused concentration-dependent antagonism of noradrenaline. The selective beta 2-adrenoceptor blocking drug, ICI 118551, also produced concentration-dependent antagonism of noradrenaline, but only when used in concentrations greater than 300 nM. 3. Cromakalim (100 nM-10 microM), isoprenaline (1-100 nM), procaterol (0.1-30 nM), salbutamol (1 nM-1 microM), salmeterol (1-100 nM) and theophylline (1 microM-1 mM) each caused concentration-dependent suppression of the spontaneous tone of guinea-pig isolated trachealis. 4. ICI 118551 (10 nM-1 microM) antagonized isoprenaline, procaterol and salmeterol in suppressing the spontaneous tone of the isolated trachea. The antagonism was concentration-dependent. In contrast, ICI 118551 (1 microM) antagonized neither cromakalim nor theophylline. CGP 20712A (up to 1 microM) failed to antagonize cromakalim, isoprenaline, procaterol, salmeterol or theophylline. In trachea treated with indomethacin (2.8 microM) and carbachol (10 microM), salmeterol (1 microM) antagonized the effects of isoprenaline but not aminophylline. 5. Intracellular electrophysiological recording from guinea-pig isolated trachealis showed that the relaxant effects of cromakalim (10 microM), isoprenaline (100 nM), procaterol (10 nM) and salbutamol(10 nM- 1 microM) were accompanied by the suppression of spontaneous electrical slow waves and by cellular hyperpolarization. In contrast, the relaxant effects of salmeterol (10 nM- 1 microM) were not accompanied by significant cellular hyperpolarization.6. CGP 20712A (1 microM) inhibited the hyperpolarization but not the relaxation induced by isoprenaline(100 nM). In contrast ICI 118551 (100 nM) inhibited both the hyperpolarization and the relaxation induced by isoprenaline (100 nM). Neither CGP 20712A (1 microM) nor ICI 118551 (100 nM) inhibited the hyperpolarization induced by cromakalim (10 microM). Salmeterol (1 microM) inhibited the hyperpolarization induced by isoprenaline (100 nM) but not that induced by cromakalim (10 microM).7. It is concluded that activation of either beta l- or beta 2-adrenoceptors can promote the opening of K+-channels in the trachealis plasmalemma. The poor ability of salmeterol to hyperpolarize trachealis muscle reflects neither its selectivity in activating beta 2-adrenoceptors as opposed to beta 1-adrenoceptors nor a non-specific action in stabilizing the cell membrane. Instead, it may reflect low intrinsic efficacy of the drug at beta 2-adrenoceptors. The opening of plasmalemmal K+-channels plays a supportive rather than a crucial role in mediating the tracheal relaxant actions of agonists at beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "8": "1. Positron emission tomography (PET) with appropriate radioligands offers the possibility of studying receptors non-invasively in man. The suitability of CGP 12177, a hydrophilic non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist which can be labelled with the positron emitter 11C, as a ligand for in vivo studies of beta-adrenoceptors was assessed in rats. 2. [3H]-CGP 12177 was injected into the tail veins of restrained conscious rats. Serial blood samples were taken from tail arteries to determine clearance from plasma. Rats were killed and tissues removed to determine tissue uptake. Radioactivity was assessed by liquid scintillation counting. 3. The uptake of (-)-[3H]-CGP 12177 in various tissues was compared to that of (+/-)-[3H]-CGP 12177. Maximum tissue:plasma ratios obtained for the (-)-enantiomer in lung, heart and liver were 170, 42 and 13 compared with 60, 15 and 12 for the racemate. Prior injection of excess unlabelled (+/-)-CGP 12177 blocked the uptake of both (-)- and (+/-)-[3H]-CGP 12177 in lung and heart but not liver, tissue:plasma ratios for both tracers being reduced to 7, 3 and 7 respectively. 4. Clearance of (-)-[3H]-CGP 12177 from plasma was rapid during the first 5 min but showed only small changes during 5 to 90 min. Uptake in lung and heart reached a maximum at 1 to 5 min and showed a slow decrease during 5-90 min. Prior injection of unlabelled (+/-)-CGP 12177 reduced uptake in lung and heart to 10% and 20% respectively. Injection of unlabelled ( +/-)-CGP 12177 at 15 mind is placed ~75% of the radioactivity by 90 min.5. ( +/- )-Propranolol had a similar effect to that of unlabelled ( +/-)-CGP 12177. Prior injection reduced uptake of radioactivity in lung and heart to 15% and 20% respectively. Injection of ( +/- )-propranolol at 15 min displaced ~ 60% of the radioactivity by 90 min indicating that the tracer binds to beta-adrenoceptor sites in vivo.6. In vivo saturation curves, obtained by injection of (-)-[3H]-CGP 12177 with increasing amounts of unlabelled (- )-CGP 12177, gave values of Bmax for lung of ~45 pmol per g wet weight of tissue and for heart of ~6 pmol per g wet weight of tissue. KD could only be expressed as nmol injected per kg bodyweight, that for lung (2.5 nmol kg-1) being greater than that for heart (1.3 nmol kg-1).7. Competition studies carried out by co-injecting (-)-[3H]-CGP 12177 with unlabelled (+/- )-CGP12177 or (-)-propranolol gave similar values for Bmax (lung 44 pmol g-1, heart 6 pmol g-1,). Values of KD for (+/-)-CGP 12177 (lung 4.7 pmol kg-1, heart 2.6 pmol kg-1) were approximately twice those for(-)-CGP 12177. Values of KD for (-)-propranolol (lung 38 nmol kg-1, heart 104 nmol kg-1) were greater.8. The results show that (-)-[3H]-CGP 12177 is a suitable ligand for assessing beta-adrenoceptors in vivo.", 
    "9": "1. We have recently reported that patients taking beta 1-adrenoceptor-selective antagonists exhibit marked sensitization of beta 2-adrenoceptor responses but unaltered beta 1-adrenoceptor responses in the heart, both in vitro and in vivo. We therefore investigated beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxant responses in rings of human internal mammary artery and saphenous vein without endothelium, taken from beta 1-blocked and non-beta-blocked patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery, for comparison. We also examined alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated contraction in these vessels, to determine whether beta 1-blockade had any cross-regulatory effect. 2. Following alpha-blockade with 10 microM phenoxybenzamine, both noradrenaline adrenaline produced concentration-dependent relaxations in both blood vessels, their effects being mediated predominantly through beta 2-adrenoceptors; a lesser beta 1-adrenoceptor component to relaxation was also found in internal mammary artery and a minor beta 1-adrenoceptor component was present in saphenous vein. No differences were found in beta 1- or in beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated vasorelaxation between beta 1-blocked and non-beta-blocked patients. 3. Methoxamine produced concentration-dependent contractions in both blood vessels, and the potency and efficacy were not significantly different between vessels from beta 1-blocked and from non-beta-blocked patients. 4. These findings indicate that, in these tissues, which possess a relatively minor beta 1-adrenoceptor component in contrast to myocardial tissue, chronic beta 1-blocker treatment does not alter either beta 1- or beta 2-adrenoceptor responses. Likewise, in such tissues, alpha 1-adrenoceptor responses are unaffected by prior beta 1-blockade.", 
    "10": "1. 8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), gepirone, buspirone and ipsapirone dose-dependently antagonized the head-shakes induced by 1-(2,5-dimethoxy 4-iodophenyl)-2-amino propane hydrochloride (DOI) (1.0 mg kg-1) in mice, when these agents were given i.p. 10 min beforehand. 2. para-Chlorophenylalanine (pCPA) abolished the effect of 8-OH-DPAT (0.1 mg kg-1) and of buspirone (1.0 mg kg-1). (+/-)-Pindolol (5.0 mg kg-1) also antagonized the effect of 8-OH-DPAT (0.1 mg kg-1). 3. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists, RX811059 (1.0 mg kg-1), idazoxan (0.5 mg kg-1), yohimbine (1.0 mg kg-1) and 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)-piperazine (1-PP) (2.0 mg kg-1) i.p. prevented the antagonistic effect of 8-OH-DPAT (0.1 mg kg-1) on DOI-head-shakes. 4. Orally-administered buspirone, given 60 min beforehand, only reduced DOI-head-shakes at doses of 60 mg kg-1 and above. However, when buspirone (1.0 mg kg-1) was administered orally twice daily for 21 days, DOI-head-shakes were significantly reduced when tested 60 min after the first daily dose on days 5, 12 and 21 and 48 h after withdrawal. 5. A single oral dose of buspirone (1.0 mg kg-1) strongly antagonized DOI-head-shakes when given 24 h after the last of 4 daily doses of 1-PP (2.0 mg kg-1, p.o.) but had no effect on DOI-head-shakes 24 h after the last of 4 daily doses of water (p.o.). 6. A single oral dose of 1-PP (2.0 mg kg-1) abolished the inhibitory effect of i.p. buspirone(1.0 mg kg-1) on DOI-head-shakes in mice which had received water (p.o.) daily on the 4 previous days but not in mice which had received 1-PP (2.0mg kg-1, p.o.) on these days.7. The ability of 5-HT1A receptor agonists to antagonize DOI-head-shakes may be due to an effect at presynaptic 5-HT receptors. It is suggested that 1-PP, formed from buspirone, may act at a2-adrenoceptors to prevent acutely administered oral buspirone from antagonizing DOI-head shakes, but that tolerance occurs to this effect of I-PP, thus revealing the inhibitory effect of buspirone when the latter is given repeatedly.", 
    "11": "Chronic daily headache appears in migraine patients due to chronic consumption of analgesics-ergotamine. This entity was considered intractable without hospital admission. Our aim was to study the response of this headache to an outpatient treatment protocol. The therapeutic protocol included: 1. Oral information to the patient about the role of analgesics in the chronification of the headache; 2. Abrupt withdrawal of analgesics-ergotamine; 3. Administration of naproxen as symptomatic medication, and 4. Prophylactic treatment. After 2.5 months of treatment we evaluated both the frequency and the intensity of pain episodes as well as analgesic consumption. Thirty patients (8.6% of the outpatient consultations) suffered from chronic daily headache secondary to chronic analgesic abuse. Twenty five were females and 5 were males, their mean age +/- SD being 43 +/- 11 years. The mean +/- SD number of units of analgesics-ergotamine taken per week was 28 +/- 12. Three patients exclusively abused analgesics, the remainder either ergotamine, caffeine and various analgesics (18) or caffeine or several analgesics not containing ergotamine (9). In 29 patients the response was positive. Twenty (67%) showed an excellent improvement (> 75%) in frequency and intensity and completely gave up analgesics. The remaining nine (30%) improved moderately (50-75%). Only 3 patients in this group carried on taking analgesics. One patient showed no improvement. Our work confirms the epidemiological magnitude of chronic daily headache and shows that this is a treatable entity on an outpatient basis combining the abrupt withdrawal of analgesics-ergotamine, and their replacement by naproxen, with prophylactic treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "12": "We challenged six patients suffering from acute neuroleptic-induced akathisia (NIA) with intravenous benztropine (2 mg), propranolol (1 mg), and placebo (saline) using a random, double-blind cross-over design to examine the effects of the drugs on the subjective, objective, and global manifestations of NIA. Benztropine produced a significant amelioration of NIA, more apparent in its subjective component. Propranolol failed to produce a significant improvement overall in any of the akathisia measures, with only one patient showing clinical improvement. The patients demonstrated considerable placebo effect and marked variation in their responses to the drugs.", 
    "13": "Comparison of the rodent and human beta 3-adrenergic receptor cDNAs with the respective genomic sequences has revealed unexpectedly that these genes contain two protein-coding exons. The rat gene was cloned recently and was found to contain three exons and two introns. In the present report, the human beta 3 receptor gene was characterized and was found to consist of two exons and a single intron. Sequence analysis of the human beta 3 receptor gene identified regions in the intron that were homologous to the second exon and second intron of the rat gene. It appears that both species utilize homologous 5' donor sites in the first intron and 3' acceptor sites of the final exon. However, splicing signals within the human intron that are homologous to the second exon of the rat gene are not used. Nuclease protection assays of tissue RNA and polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNA demonstrated conclusively that beta 3 receptor mRNA, containing two protein-coding exons, is expressed in human adipose and intestinal tissues. The pharmacological properties of the full length human beta 3 receptor were determined for the first time in Chinese hamster ovary cells, where catecholamine agonists activated adenylyl cyclase with low potency. The beta 3 receptor agonists CGP 12177 and BRL 37344 also activated adenylyl cyclase. CGP 12177 was 10-15 times more potent than either isoproterenol or BRL 37344 in stimulating adenylyl cyclase activity. These pharmacological properties differed somewhat from those reported previously for Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the truncated receptor. However, direct comparison indicates that it is unlikely that the amino acid sequence derived from the second exon can account for these differences.", 
    "14": "Increases in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration in rat submandibular acini were observed in response to isoprenaline (10 microM), noradrenaline (10 microM) and carbamoylcholine (10 microM). Noradrenaline and carbamoylcholine responses were decreased to 27% and 33% respectively in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, suggesting a major requirement for Ca2+ entry. beta-Adrenergic stimulation elicited a small (35-40 nM) free Ca2+ rise, approx. 75% of which was mobilized from an intracellular store. Results suggest that this Ca2+ rise is a key event in the physiological triggering of mucin secretion by exocytosis.", 
    "15": "To demonstrate that esmolol, sodium nitroprusside, and isoflurane differ in their abilities to alter adrenal medullary blood flow and other peripheral sympathetic responses to hypotension, 16 mongrel dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital were allocated randomly to one of four test groups and given two hypotensive stimuli, separated by 1 h, to a mean arterial blood pressure of 60 mm Hg for 10 min. The first stimulus, induced by blood loss into a pressurized bottle system, constituted the control for each animal. The second hypotensive stimulus was created by either repeat blood loss (Group 1), esmolol infusion (Group 2), sodium nitroprusside infusion (Group 3), or isoflurane administration (Group 4). Before and 10 min into hypotension, the variables of abdominal organ blood flow, adrenal medullary blood flow, arterial norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations were measured. In the control animals (Group 1), comparable decreases in abdominal organ blood flow and similar increases in adrenal medullary blood flow, norepinephrine, and epinephrine were elicited by the first and second hypotensive stimulus. Esmolol-induced hypotension (Group 2) abolished the increase in adrenal medullary blood flow and attenuated the increase in epinephrine by 65% (P < 0.03). The decrease in abdominal organ blood flow and the increase in norepinephrine were similar to that observed during baseline hemorrhagic hypotension. In contrast, sodium nitroprusside-induced hypotension (Group 3) abolished abdominal organ vasoconstriction whereas the increases in adrenal medullary blood flow, norepinephrine, and epinephrine were comparable to baseline hemorrhagic hypotension. In fact, abdominal organ blood flow increased 2.5-fold (P < 0.001) during hypotension with SNP. Isoflurane 2%, 1.54 minimum alveolar anesthesia concentration (Group 4), abolished the increases in adrenal medullary blood flow, norepinephrine, and epinephrine observed during baseline hemorrhagic hypotension and attenuated the decrease in abdominal organ blood flow by 70% (P < 0.001). These data demonstrate that esmolol, sodium nitroprusside, and isoflurane differ radically in their ability to alter or blunt peripheral sympathetic responses to hypotension, and suggest that isoflurane is the drug most effective in blunting multiple responses of the peripheral sympathetic system.",

In contrast, adrenergic regulation of glucagon secretion remains controversial. This study was designed to determine the effects of alpha 2- and beta-adrenergic agonism on islet alpha cells, using isolated perfused pancreata of normal and streptozocin-induced diabetic (STZ-D) rats. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine at a concentration of 10(-7) mol/L significantly stimulated glucagon secretion as compared with basal levels in both normal (1,286 +/- 90 v 417 +/- 53 ng/L, P < .01) and STZ-D rats (551 +/- 86 v 130 +/- 19 ng/L, P < .01). Also, the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol at a concentration of 10(-7) mol/L significantly stimulated glucagon secretion as compared with basal levels in both normal (751 +/- 130 v 347 +/- 41 ng/L, P < .05) and STZ-D rats (182 +/- 22 v 92 +/- 20 ng/L, P < .01). Furthermore, these alpha 2- and beta-agonistic effects were almost completely inhibited in the presence of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol at a concentration of 10(-6) mol/L, respectively. Insulin secretion was markedly reduced in STZ-D rats. These results suggest that even in a severely diabetic state, not only beta- but also also alpha 2-adrenergic agonism stimulates glucagon secretion from rat pancreatic alpha cells.", 
    "17": "A new class of long-acting beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists has been studied in the last few years. Apparently, they display an important anti-inflammatory activity with an inhibition of different cellular functions. This study was carried out to compare a long-acting beta 2-agonist, formoterol, with a conventional short-acting one, salbutamol, on the release of superoxide anion (O2-) and bacterial killing by alveolar macrophages obtained with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from 20 patients with chronic bronchitis. The O2- production in basal conditions was not affected by beta 2-agonists. On the contrary, after phagocytosis of opsonized zymosan 10(-5) M formoterol significantly affected the phagocytic index (difference between stimulated and basal O2- release): 7.9 +/- 2.0 nM O2-/10(6) AM/10 min vs 16.8 +/- 2.5, p < 0.0007. Bacterial killing was inhibited by the two drugs in a dose-dependent way, but the effect of formoterol was more evident than that of salbutamol. After blocking beta 2-receptors with propranolol, we observed a prevention of the beta 2-agonist effects on both O2- release and bacterial killing. The inhibition of the alveolar macrophage functions considered in this study is evident for both beta 2-agonists, but it is significantly more pronounced for formoterol. Our data can be interpreted as one possible mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effect described for long-acting beta 2-agonists. On the other hand, also a potential suppression of pulmonary antibacterial defenses must not be overlooked, particularly in chronic bronchitis, a disease characterized by recurrent airways infections. Whether current therapeutic dosages are sufficient to achieve anti-inflammatory or microbicidal suppressive effects of clinical relevance has not been demonstrated so far.", 
    "18": "Safety and efficacy of simultaneous use of intravenous digoxin and esmolol in the control of rapid heart rate in 21 patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter was assessed. The mean age was 67 (range 40 to 90) years. Seven patients had class III congestive heart failure, with left ventricular ejection fraction between 18% and 61%. Baseline mean heart rate was 143 +/- 4. After 0.25 mg or 0.5 mg intravenous digoxin, esmolol was titrated with initial boluses from 2 mg/min to 16 mg/min in 25 minutes. A tolerated dose of esmolol infusion was adjusted for up to 48 hours. Rapid control of heart rate (29% decrease with heart rate 101 +/- 4) occurred at a mean interval of 21 minutes. Minimum heart rate was 87 +/- 4 at 90 minutes of treatment. Conversion to sinus rhythm occurred in five patients (25%), and one patient experienced mild transient congestive heart failure. No symptomatic hypotension or bronchospasm occurred. In conclusion, simultaneous use of digoxin and esmolol is effective in safely and rapidly controlling heart rate in atrial fibrillation or flutter.", 
    "19": "The effects of beta 2- and beta 1-adrenoceptor (beta 2AR and beta 1AR, respectively) agonists on the cytosolic Ca2+ (Cai) transient (indexed by the transient increase in indo-1 fluorescence ratio after excitation), twitch amplitude (measured via photodiode array), membrane potential, and L-type sarcolemmal Ca2+ current (ICa, measured by whole-cell patch electrode) were assessed in single rat ventricular myocytes. The selective beta 2AR agonist Zinterol increased the amplitudes of both the Cai transient and twitch in a concentration-dependent manner. Similar results were obtained when beta 2ARs were stimulated with isoproterenol in the presence of the selective beta 1AR antagonist CGP 20712A. beta 1AR stimulation induced by norepinephrine increased twitch amplitude to about the same extent as did beta 2AR stimulation. However, several striking differences between response to beta 1AR and beta 2AR stimulation were observed. beta 1AR stimulation had the potent effect of abbreviating the time course of the contraction and Cai transient, and beta 2AR stimulation did not reduce the time course of the Cai transient and had only a minor effect on the twitch duration. For a given increase in twitch amplitude, beta 1AR stimulation caused a greater increase in Cai transient, suggesting a diminished Cai-myofilament interaction. beta 1AR, but not beta 2AR, stimulation evoked spontaneous Cai oscillations, increased the diastolic indo fluorescence level, and caused a decline in resting cell length. beta 1AR and beta 2AR also differed in their effects on ICa. Whereas both beta 1AR and beta 2AR stimulation increased the peak ICa amplitude, beta 2AR stimulation markedly prolonged the ICa inactivation time. Accordingly, beta 2AR stimulation prolonged the action potential duration to a greater extent than did beta 1AR stimulation. 8-(4-Chlorophenylthio)cAMP mimicked the effects of beta 1AR stimulation by norepinephrine but not those due to beta 2AR stimulation. These results clearly indicate that both beta 2ARs and beta 1ARs functionally coexist in rat ventricular myocytes but that stimulation of these receptor subtypes elicits qualitatively different cell responses at the levels of ionic channels, the myofilaments, and sarcoplasmic reticulum.", 
    "20": "In an attempt to resolve the controversy concerning use of beta-adrenoceptor blockade in patients undergoing coronary artery revascularization, 40 consecutive patients with ischaemic heart disease receiving chronic beta-adrenergic blocking therapy (study group) were entered into a randomized trial and were compared with 40 patients receiving no beta-blocking therapy (control group). The postoperative requirement for positive inotropic agents between the two groups was compared. The clinical and operative characteristics of the two groups were similar. After surgery, 2% of patients in the study group required positive inotropic agents compared with 18% of those in the control group (P < 0.05). It is concluded that this difference resulted from an increase in density of beta 1-adrenergic receptors induced by beta-adrenergic blockade, and an increase in the level of catecholamines in the early postoperative period.",

Indeed, heart rate during the early stages of exercise (stages 1-5) was higher in patients with a peak VO2 less than or equal to 20 ml/mm/kg than in those with a peak VO2 greater than 20 ml/min/kg (heart rate 140 v 125 beats/min, p < 0.05). At maximal exercise, however, peak VO2 was positively correlated with heart rate (r = 2.15, p < 0.0001).",

    "26": "Comparative analysis of the effects of intravesical instillation of drugs on urodynamic parameters (MVP, maximum intravesical pressure; RR, residual rate; BC, bladder capacity) was performed using an experimental model in unanesthetized rats. The drugs investigated in this study were atropine (7.2 x 10(-4)-7.2 x 10(-2) M), propantheline (7.2 x 10(-3)-2.2 x 10(-2) M), oxybutynin (2.5 x 10(-3)-2.5 x 10(-2) M), isoproterenol (5 x 10(-2)-10(-1) M) and prazosin (5 x 10(-4) M). Of the anticholinergics, propantheline and oxybutynin showed a remarkable suppression of MVP accompanied with a consistent increase of RR and BC in a dose-dependent manner. Atropine showed, however, no suppression of MVP in spite of a significant change of RR and BC. Isoproterenol suppressed MVP with an increase of RR and BC in a dose-dependent manner at a relatively high concentration. Prazosin increased BC and RR at a relatively low concentration. This study revealed that these intravesical drugs have the ability to suppress spontaneous bladder contraction in unanesthetized rats and to change the micturition function in the urinary filling and storage phases. It is expected that intravesical instillation therapy for detrusor hyperreflexia will be improved in the future based upon the data obtained.", 
    "27": "Tertatolol, a recently developed beta 1-beta 2-blocker has two advantages: it does not induce withdrawal syndrome after abrupt cessation, and it preserves renal function. It has been suggested that the kinetics of tertatolol in patients with hepatic dysfunction are altered. Therefore, the hemodynamic effects and pharmacokinetics following the acute administration of tertatolol were studied in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension. Systemic, splanchnic and renal hemodynamics were evaluated before and 30 min after the simultaneous administration of 2.5 mg tertatolol p.o. and 1.25 mg deuterated tertatolol i.v. in 10 cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices. The pharmacokinetics of tertatolol were evaluated over a 4-day period. Tertatolol significantly decreased heart rate (-22 +/- 10%), cardiac output (-26 +/- 8%), and hepatic blood flow (-27 +/- 23%). The hepatic venous pressure gradient decreased from 15.7 +/- 5.0 to 12.9 +/- 4.0 mmHg (-17 +/- 13%, P < 0.01). Three out of 10 patients were non-responders to tertatolol. Renal blood flow (-9 +/- 28%) and intrinsic hepatic clearance of indocyanin green (-9 +/- 25%) were not significantly modified. The duration of effective beta-blockade was far less than 12 h. Tertatolol was rapidly absorbed with a Cmax of 70 +/- 51 micrograms/l at a peak time of 0.75 +/- 0.26 h. In comparison with healthy volunteers referred to in literature sources, plasma clearance was reduced to 49 +/- 28 ml/min, bioavailability was increased to 72 +/- 20%, and the volume of distribution was increased to 50 +/- 34 l, probably due, in part, to a weaker protein binding -85%--effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "28": "The effects of carbon loading and endcapping on the solid-phase extraction onto C18 bonded silica gel of a range of beta-blockers from aqueous buffer and from dog plasma has been investigated. The highest extraction efficiencies were obtained for those phases with carbon loadings of between 5 and 16% for phases without endcapping or 10.5-14% for endcapped material. With carbon loadings of 18 and 22% (plus endcapping) poor extractions from the matrix were obtained combined with further losses at the wash steps. Matrix effects were observed with dog plasma which accentuated the effects seen with buffer. These results are best explained by assuming that a cationic interaction of the secondary amino group present in the analytes with residual silanols on the silica surface is primarily responsible for the extraction of these analytes.", 
    "29": "The effects of selective beta 2-adrenergic blockade with ICI 118,551 on the histochemical, biochemical, and contractile properties of slow-twitch soleus muscle from spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and normotensive (WKY) rats were examined from birth to 8-10 weeks of age. Chronic treatment of normotensive rats with ICI 118,551 caused an impairment in the differentiation of slow type fibers during development but failed to alter the fiber type distribution of hypertensive rats. beta 2-Adrenoreceptor blockade was ineffective in reducing the enhanced glycolytic and oxidative capacities of soleus in hypertensive rats. The suggestion can be made that beta 2-adrenoreceptor activation is not responsible, at least directly, for the histochemical and biochemical alterations of slow muscle from hypertensive rats.", 
    "30": "The in vivo regional distribution of pulmonary beta-adrenoceptors was imaged and quantified in humans with the hydrophilic beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (S)-CGP-12177 labeled with carbon-11 [(S)-[11C]CGP-12177] and positron emission tomography (PET). Six normal male volunteers and eight patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were studied. PET scanning consisted of transmission (tissue density), C15O (blood volume), and (S)-[11C]CGP-12177 (beta-adrenoceptor) emission scans. High-specific-activity (S)-[11C]-CGP-12177 (7.1 +/- 2.0 micrograms, 6.5 +/- 2.1 GBq/mumol) was given intravenously followed by a low-specific-activity (S)-[11C]CGP-12177 injection (34.0 +/- 4.8 micrograms, 2.3 +/- 0.8 GBq/mumol). Binding capacity (Bmax) was calculated in each region of interest as picomoles per gram by normalizing it to the local extravascular tissue density. In normal subjects, average Bmax for all regions of interest was 14.8 +/- 1.6 (SD) pmol/g, which is similar to previously reported in vitro values. In both groups there were no differences in beta-adrenoceptor density between peripheral and central regions nor between right and left lungs. In patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, extravascular tissue density was 24% higher than in normal subjects; Bmax per milliliter thoracic volume was correspondingly higher but was not different from that in normal subjects when expressed per gram tissue (15.8 +/- 2.6 pmol/g). These data suggest that in vivo beta-adrenoceptor density may be quantifiable in humans with the use of PET. This should offer a means to study physiological regulation through repeat measurements.", 
    "31": "In the past decade, strategies for managing heart failure have changed. The use of beta blockers, although still in the experimental stage, has proved effective in some cases. The protective action of beta-blocking agents against chronic catecholamine stimulation may be enhanced by the combination with L-carnitine. This substance plays an important and synergistic role 1) as an important source of energy due to fatty acid oxidation, and 2) by avoiding the accumulation of lipids in the myocardium. The successful follow-up of a case of dilated cardiomyopathy is critically reviewed. Treatment with the L-carnitine-propranolol combination restored cardiac function in a 52-year-old man with dilated cardiomyopathy: a 50% reduction in mitral EPSS (E Point Septal Separation), from 20 to 10 mm was obtained with the above mentioned therapy; as well as a decrease from 60 to 57 mm in diastolic diameter. Our experience suggests promising benefits in adopting beta blockers combined with L-carnitine therapy in myocardial failure secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy.", 
    "32": "To determine the effect of dihydropyridines on the metabolism of propranolol, we studied the effects of a single oral dose of nicardipine, nifedipine, and BAY-K-8644 on the pharmacokinetics of propranolol in male Wistar rats fitted with a catheter in the jugularis vein. Oral propranolol (15 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg) and intravenous propranolol (1.5 mg/kg) were administered either alone or together with oral nicardipine (2.5 mg/kg). Oral propranolol (15 mg/kg) was administered with oral nifedipine (1.5 mg/kg) and with oral BAY-K-8644 (1.5 mg/kg). Nicardipine increased significantly the AUC and Cmax of oral propranolol (1.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg). However, the plasma concentration time curve of intravenous propranolol (1.5 mg/kg) was unaffected. Nifedipine also significantly increased the AUC and Cmax of oral propranolol (15 mg/kg), whereas with BAY-K-8644 there was only a slight increase in the bioavailability of oral propranolol (15 mg/kg). The results indicate that the dihydropyridine calcium antagonists decrease the metabolism of propranolol as a result of a decrease in first-pass clearance. Although an interaction at the level of cytochrome P450 may also be involved, the results of the present study suggest that the inhibitory effect can be largely attributed to changes in liver blood flow.", 
    "33": "To assess the effect of age on the circadian blood pressure (BP) after an alpha,beta-adrenergic blocker, the ambulatory BP was measured before and after arotinolol chloride administration in nine younger (mean age 49.1 years) and 14 older (72.1 years) patients with essential hypertension. After a 4-week control period, arotinolol chloride was administered twice daily (08:00 and 20:00 hours) for 8 weeks and the ambulatory BP was measured non-invasively at the end of the control and treatment period. Arotinolol significantly reduced the daytime systolic BP from 152.3 to 140.9 mmHg (P < 0.05) and night-time systolic BP from 137.3 to 122.3 mmHg (P < 0.01) in the younger hypertensive patients. In contrast, in the older group, the night-time systolic BP did not show a significant change, although the daytime systolic BP was significantly reduced from 155.0 to 142.2 mmHg (P < 0.02). Diastolic BP in both groups was significantly reduced by arotinolol during the day and night. Night-time reduction of BP was significantly less in the older group (-8.6 vs -15.1 mmHg for the systolic pressure P < 0.01; -5.8 vs -9.8 mmHg for the diastolic pressure P < 0.01).", 
    "34": "Acute systemic and, possibly, coronary vasoconstriction may limit the usefulness of i.v. beta-blockade for the management of hypertension in ischemic patients. The acute hemodynamic and neurohumoral profile of i.v. dilevalol (50 mg/5 min), a nonselective beta-antagonist and selective partial beta 2-agonist, was evaluated for 1 h in nine patients with stable angina, significant (> 50%) coronary artery disease, and mild hypertension. Immediately after administration, arterial pressures fell significantly by 13% and remained lowered for the entire study period. Concomitantly, heart rate slowed from 76 +/- 2 (mean +/- SEM; control) to 67 +/- 2 beats/min (60 min postadministration, p < 0.05), and cardiac index and stroke work decreased significantly by 15 and 21%, respectively. Isovolumetric contractility indices (measured at fixed heart rates) fell progressively by 9-12%, whereas relaxation (Tau1 and Tau2) slowed by 10% (all p < 0.05 vs. control). Consequently, left ventricular end-diastolic and right atrial pressures increased significantly from 17 +/- 3 and 9 +/- 1.2 mm Hg at baseline to 21 +/- 2.5 and 12 +/- 2.1 mm Hg, respectively. Dilevalol did not affect systemic or coronary resistance. However, coronary flow decreased by 24% (p < 0.05 vs. control), accompanied by significant reductions in myocardial oxygen demand and consumption of 23 and 14%, respectively. Levels of circulating norepinephrine and dopamine increased by 35 and 71%, whereas those of renin and angiotensin II decreased by 26 and 33%, respectively (all p < 0.05 vs. control). Adverse side effects did not occur. None of the patients became ischemic. Thus, at the dose level used, dilevalol has predominant beta-blocking effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "35": "This prospective, double-blind study used invasive monitoring and echo-Doppler techniques to compare the hemodynamic effects of nebivolol, a new beta 1-selective beta-blocking agent with those of atenolol in patients recovering from coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. Five milligrams nebivolol and 50 mg atenolol equally decreased heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) but, nebivolol, in contrast to atenolol, caused no decrease in stroke index (SI), cardiac index (CI), and right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF). These differences appeared to be related in part to different peripheral effects of the two agents because nebivolol administration was associated with a reduction in systemic vascular resistance (SVR). After < or = 10 days of treatment, acceleration of aortic flow velocity increased and isovolumic relaxation time decreased with nebivolol but not with atenolol treatment. Both drugs were equally well tolerated. Therefore, nebivolol shares most of its effects with classical beta 1-blockers but is devoid of the potentially harmful effects on cardiac output (CO) and peripheral resistance.", 
    "36": "The cardiovascular effects of YM-16151-4 were evaluated in rats and dogs. In conscious rats, YM-16151-4 (3-30 mg/kg p.o.) produced a dose-dependent hypotensive effect without increasing heart rate (HR) and plasma renin activity (PRA). Nifedipine (3-10 mg/kg p.o.) produced a dose-dependent hypotensive effect but significantly increased HR and PRA. Atenolol (30 mg/kg p.o.) decreased PRA but did not decrease blood pressure and HR. The cardiovascular effects of the combination of nifedipine and atenolol were similar to those of YM-16151-4. It is interesting that the time course of the hypotensive effect of YM-16151-4 was similar to that of its beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking effect, although the time courses of these effects of the combination of nifedipine and atenolol were different. In conscious dogs, YM-16151-4 (0.3-10 mg/kg p.o.) also produced a long-lasting hypotensive effect with almost no effect on HR and PQ-interval. The time course of the beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking effect was similar to that of its hypotensive effect. Furthermore, during 10-day repeated oral administration, neither tolerance nor augmentation was observed in the hypotensive and beta 1-adrenoceptor-blocking effects. In conclusion, the present results indicate that YM-16151-4 is an effective and long-lasting hypotensive agent that does not increase HR and PRA. These effects of YM-16151-4 may be attributable to its calcium-entry-blocking and beta 1-adrenoceptor-blocking activities, and the ratio of two activities was constant after single and repeated oral administrations.", 
    "37": "The purpose of this study was to compare the dose-dependent effects of d-sotalol and l-sotalol (3 x 10(-7) M to 10(-4) M) on electrophysiological parameters in isolated preparations of the rabbit atrioventricular (AV) node. Standard microelectrode techniques were used in recording transmembrane action potentials from cells of the upper and lower AV node. Twelve New Zealand white Rabbits of either sex weighing between 1.5 and 2.6 kg were used. In both cell types studied, d-sotalol as well as l-sotalol prolonged action potential duration to the same extent. No significant effects were observed with either isomer on maximum diastolic potential, action potential amplitude, or maximum upstroke velocity of the action potential (Vmax). The rate of spontaneous discharge in AV nodal cells was decreased to the same extent by both isomers; this effect was caused by action potential prolongation; no effect on the rate of diastolic depolarization or Vmax was observed. Both d-sotalol and l-sotalol prolonged AV nodal conduction to the same degree by lengthening the action potential duration in AV nodal cells. The effects of 10(-4) M d-sotalol on AV nodal reentrant tachycardia were studied in one preparation in which AV nodal reentrant tachycardias could reproducibly be initiated by atrial premature stimulation. d-Sotalol abolished the occurrence of this tachycardia by lengthening refractoriness in AV nodal cells; this effect can be ascribed to a Class III antiarrhythmic effect.", 
    "38": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of enalapril and atenolol in decreasing the severity of proteinuria in hypertensive patients suffering from insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. We studied 20 hypertensive patients. All patients had proteinuria (> 3 g/24 h) and were receiving insulin treatment. Proteinuria was measured monthly in the run-in period (3 months) and during the active drug treatment (8 months). Glomerular filtration rate, effective renal plasma flow, filtration fraction, and total renal resistance were determined after the run-in and treatment periods. The patients were randomly assigned to treatment with enalapril 20 mg/day or atenolol 100 mg/day for 8 months. In both groups blood pressure decreased significantly. After 8 months' treatment, severity of proteinuria significantly decreased both in the enalapril-treated group and in the group receiving atenolol. Glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow significantly increased, while total renal resistance decreased in the patients given enalapril, whereas glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, and total renal resistance significantly decreased in the patients given atenolol. The results of this study show that enalapril and atenolol reduce proteinuria in hypertensive diabetic patients by a mechanism related to their antihypertensive effects; furthermore, the beneficial effects of enalapril might be also linked to intrarenal effects.", 
    "39": "(D-L) Nebivolol is a new beta 1-selective adrenoceptor blocker which in normal individuals preserves rest and exercise hemodynamics. We assessed the effects of the enantiomers (L- and D-nebivolol) on left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function and compared their effects with those of the racemic mixture. LV angiography (+Millar) was performed before and after intravenous (i.v.) infusion of either D- or L-nebivolol (1.25-2.5 mg, n = 22) in patients with ischemic heart disease and previous myocardial infarction. Neither L- nor D-nebivolol produced significant changes in heart rate (HR), peak (+) dP/dt, (dP/dt) DP40, cardiac index (CI) or ejection fraction (EF). Diastolic distensibility, evaluated from the shift of the pressure-volume data at the time of mitral valve opening, did not improve after D- or L-enantiomers administration. In contrast, both D-L-nebivolol 2.5 mg (n = 9) and atenolol 15 mg (n = 9) significantly reduced HR and peak (+) dP/dt, but in comparison to atenolol D-L nebivolol improved EF (+4% after D-L nebivolol vs. -4% after atenolol; p < 0.05 D-L nebivolol vs. atenolol) and maintained cardiac output CO, (+2% vs. -21%; p < 0.05 between groups). Moreover, unlike any of the other drugs in the study, the racemate shifted the diastolic pressure-volume data downward, suggesting improved LV distensibility. The beneficial effects of nebivolol on LV systolic and diastolic function appears to require the presence of both D- and L-enantiomers.", 
    "40": "1. The decreased response to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation seen in heart failure may be related to a defect in cyclic AMP production. The inotropic effects of the selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) III inhibitors, SK&F 94120 and SK&F94836, and the non-selective PDE inhibitor, 3-isobutyl-l-methylxanthine (IBMX), alone and when combined synergistically with isoprenaline, were studied in control and beta-adrenoceptor-desensitized ventricular myocytes. 2. Myocytes isolated from noradrenaline-treated guinea-pigs had a reduced maximum response to isoprenaline compared with control animals (60.0 +/- 2.5%, n = 42 vs 79.5 +/- 1.7% maximum calcium: n = 46, P < 0.001). Together with an approximately 20 fold increase in the isoprenaline EC50, this is indicative of beta-adrenoceptor desensitization as a result with chronic infusion with noradrenaline. 3. The maximum inotropic response of IBMX was depressed following noradrenaline treatment, from 74.9 +/- 4.6% (n = 7) in control, to 61.7 +/- 2.70% (n = 6), as a percentage of maximum calcium in noradrenaline-treated guinea-pig ventricular myocytes (P < 0.02). The pD2 value for IBMX was also reduced (P < 0.02). No significant differences in the inotropic effects of SK&F94120 and SK&F94836 were seen between control and beta-adrenoceptor desensitized myocytes. 4. Threshold inotropic concentrations of SK&F94120 and SK&F94836 caused a five fold decrease in the EC50 of control myocytes for isoprenaline, and an 11 fold decrease in the noradrenaline-treated guinea-pig ventricular myocytes. 5. The maximum response to isoprenaline in myocytes isolated from normal guinea-pigs was unaffected by PDE inhibition; either at threshold or maximum inotropic concentrations, or by CPT cyclic AMP, an analogue of cyclic AMP.6. A significant potentiation of the maximum isoprenaline response by threshold inotropic concentrations was observed with SK&F 94120 (P<0.05), but not with IBMX or SK&F 94836, in myocytes isolated from noradrenaline-treated guinea-pig hearts. This potentiation, however, did not completely restore the response to levels seen in control myocytes.7. The extent of potentiation of the maximum isoprenaline response by maximum inotropic concentrations of either IBMX or CPT cyclic AMP, was no greater than that by threshold concentrations of IBMX, in myocytes isolated from noradrenaline-treated guinea-pig hearts.8. In cardiac myocytes isolated from the explanted hearts of 16 patients with heart failure, threshold concentrations of IBMX and SK&F 94120 decreased the isoprenaline EC50 by a factor of four and six,respectively, but potentiation of the maximum isoprenaline response occurred only with SK&F 94120.The attenuated isoprenaline response was increased from 60.3 +/- 4.5% to 74.3 +/- 4.2% as a % maximum calcium (P<0.05, n = 6), but remained substantially lower than the 116 +/- 7% (P<0.001, n = 6) seen in myocytes isolated from non-failing hearts.9. We conclude that the reduced maximum contraction amplitude with isoprenaline in cardiac myocytes from either patients in end-stage failure, or noradrenaline-treated guinea-pigs, is partly but not solely due to insufficient cyclic AMP levels, since inhibition of cyclic AMP degradation does not result incomplete reversal of the beta-adrenoceptor desensitization.",

The ability to terminate ventricular tachycardia by RAMP (72%) or BURST (65%) pacing was not significantly different. However, time to terminate ventricular tachycardia by RAMP (11.8 +/- 8.5 sec) was significantly shorter than by BURST (16.4 +/- 13.5), P < .001. Acceleration of ventricular tachycardia was uncommon with both pacing modes, 7/108 (7%). The ability to pace terminate ventricular tachycardia was cycle length dependent. The highest success was with ventricular tachycardia cycle length between 300 and 350 msec. The success rate decreased with faster and also slower ventricular tachycardia.", 
    "44": "1. Rate adaptive pacing methods for ventricular tachycardia termination are effective and safe. 2. Autodecremental RAMP pacing afford quicker ventricular tachycardia termination than constant cycle length BURST pacing. 3. The ability to terminate ventricular tachycardia is cycle length dependent with cycle length range of 300-350 msec being most responsive to pace termination.", 
    "45": "The effect of arotinolol on the incomplete tetanic contractions of the cat soleus muscle was studied. Isoproterenol and epinephrine injected intravenously decreased the tension and degree of fusion of incomplete tetanic contractions of the soleus muscle in anesthetized cats. Intravenous arotinolol (> 3 micrograms/kg), propranolol (> 30 micrograms/kg) and pindolol (> 3 micrograms/kg) blocked the effects of isoproterenol and epinephrine, but atenolol (-300 micrograms/kg), prazosin (0.1-10 micrograms/kg) and phentolamine (10, 30 micrograms/kg) did not block them. These results indicate that the receptors involved can be classified as of the beta 2-type. It is proposed that arotinolol may inhibit beta 2-adrenoceptors in the extrafusal muscle fibers of slow muscle, and thereby reduces the amplitude of tremor by changing the incomplete tetanic contractions of the muscle to the complete ones.", 
    "46": "Although the stimulatory action of catecholamines on the heart has been presumed to result exclusively from their direct effects on the cardiac myocytes, little work has been done addressing the effects of catecholamines on the supporting non-myocytes of the heart. We have recently identified medium conditioned by neonatal rat cardiac non-myocytes (NMC-CM) as the source of a growth-promoting factor which leads to cardiac myocyte hypertrophy in culture, suggesting that these non-myocytes may play an active role in myocardial growth. Since cardiac non-myocytes also contain adrenergic receptors (both alpha and beta) on their cell surface, we asked whether adrenergic stimulation of these non-myocytes could supplement the growth-promoting effect of NMC-CM. While isoproterenol (ISO, 0.2 microM) caused no increase in the per cell content of total protein in the non-myocytes, inclusion of ISO in the medium used in the production of NMC-CM augmented the growth promoting effects of this \"ISOCM\" over control CM. This increase was not seen with the alpha 1 adrenergic agonist phenylephrine suggesting that the stimulatory effect was specific to the beta-adrenergic receptor. Because TGF beta 3 contains an upstream cAMP Response Element, we wonder whether its expression could respond to the increase in cAMP induced by ISO. Non-myocytes treated over 72 h with ISO expressed increased steady state mRNA levels for TGF beta 3 but not that for the closely related TGF beta 1 over this time period. We believe that this is the first report indicating that a potential mechanism for the observed effects of beta-adrenergic stimulation on myocardial cells in culture and possibly relevant in vivo is the contribution of beta-stimulated factor(s) produced by non-myocytes which act in a paracrine fashion on myocardial cells.", 
    "47": "Using spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), we studied the effects of a new calcium antagonist, (+/-)-(R*)-3-[(R*)-1-benzyl-3-piperidyl] methyl 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-4-(m-nitrophenyl)-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylate hydrochloride (KW-3049) on the development of hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy. When KW-3049 was administered orally to 5-week-old SHR, a stage before the onset of hypertension, for 12 consecutive weeks, it showed a dose-dependent and marked antihypertensive action. Administration of 3 mg/kg of KW-3049, once a day, significantly suppressed the rise in blood pressure to a similar extent to 15 mg/kg of nicardipine, twice a day. After 12 weeks of administration, the heart weight was decreased or tended to be decreased. Co-administration with propranolol markedly decreased the heart rate, but little affected the heart weight, suggesting changes in the heart rate during the long-term administration of KW-3049 did not largely affect cardiac hypertrophy. KW-3049 did not increase plasma renin activity (PRA) or plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC). There was no significant change in the myocardial DNA and RNA contents. These results suggest the clinical usefulness of KW-3049 as an antihypertensive drug.", 
    "48": "Modifications of membrane phospholipids and binding characteristics of adrenoceptors by hydrocortisone and epinephrine were examined in sarcolemmal preparation from rat heart muscle. The influence of hydrocortisone and epinephrine on the fatty acid composition of membrane phospholipids and the affinity (1/Kd) and number of binding sites (Bmax) of alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptors was studied in male Wistar rats treated daily for 7 days with the hormones. The alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptors were characterized by using the antagonist ligands [3H]prazosin and [3H]dihydroalprenolol, respectively. Administration of the hormones altered significantly the composition of fatty acids, decreased linoleic acid (18: 2(n-6)) level of both phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, and increased arachidonic acid (20: 4(n-6)) level of phosphatidylcholine and docosahexaenoic acid (22: 6(n-3)) level in both phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. The binding sites of alpha 1-adrenoceptors were of high affinity in the control group. Following administration of the hormones Kd of alpha 1-adrenoceptors increased markedly. The number of alpha 1-adrenoceptors binding sites did not change significantly due to the hormones. In contrast, while the hormone treatments did not alter the affinity of the beta-adrenoceptors the number of binding sites were significantly decreased by the hormones. The results indicate that the decrease in affinity of alpha 1-adrenoceptors and the down-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors is accompanied by alteration in percentage fatty acid compositions of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine in cardiac muscle.", 
    "49": "The effects of a preoperative beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, metoprolol, on peroperative anxiety, relaxation, general feeling, blood pressures and heart rate, were studied in patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery during epidural anesthesia. The study was double-blind and placebo controlled. Twenty non-consecutive patients were randomized to receive either metoprolol 100 mg or placebo orally 1-2 hours before anaesthesia. Patients receiving metoprolol scored statistically significantly better on anxiety, and general feeling. The average height of the epidural block was ThVIII. The average blood pressure was reduced by 5% during the first 45 minutes in both groups. The average maximum falls in mean blood pressure from preanaesthetic to the lowest measured after the epidural were 14% (metoprolol) and 7% (placebo). The heart rates were significantly lower after metoprolol. In conclusion, the patients felt subjectively better after metoprolol and no significant differences were found in blood pressure after metoprolol compared to placebo.", 
    "50": "The authors used a new protocol, based upon a supersensitive TSH assay, to examine the thyroid status of 1720 patients. Based upon the serum hormone levels, the patients were divided into different clinical groups. The biochemical relationship between the different hormone levels, and the rate of occurrence of various thyroid diseases were studied. 76.1% of the new patients hadn't received any previous treatment. 15.5% of those patients who had received treatment had hyperthyroidism, while 8.4% of those had hypothyroidism. 76% of the new patients, 38.3% of those who had hyperthyroidism, and only 29.7% of those who had hypothyroidism, were euthyroid. Undetectable TSH levels (< 0.03 mU/L) where observed in 51.8% of the new hyperthyroid patients, and in 33.8% of those who had subclinical hyperthyroidism. Similar results were obtained with those who had been previously treated for hyperthyroidism. The new protocol has the following advantages: it's more convenient to the patients, it's quick, it's economical. With this method it is possible to reduce the assays per patient by 31%. The algorithm was supplemented with results of free hormone levels. By doing this the authors were able to measure free-T4 and T3 hormone levels of 150 more patients. According to the authors, the free-T4 test is more informative than the free-T4-index, especially in the border-line cases and in treated hyperthyroidism. Primarily the free-T3 test is most necessary when examining patients treated with methimasol.", 
    "51": "Long-term effects of cAMP on the surface expression of beta-adrenoceptors and adenylyl cyclase activity were investigated in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes. beta-Adrenoceptor density and catecholamine-responsive adenylyl cyclase activity increased during culturing in a biphasic manner, with a plateau of 10-20 h duration occurring approximately 10 h after plating. Treatment of hepatocyte cultures with 8-bromo-cAMP during the plateau period did not affect the density of beta-adrenoceptors. In contrast, addition of 8-bromo-cAMP, 8-chlorophenylthio-cAMP, forskolin or glucagon during a period of active recruitment of surface beta-adrenoceptors resulted in a suppression of the acquisition of beta-adrenoceptors. In both experimental situations there was a partial decrease in hormone-stimulated and basal adenylyl cyclase activity. The results suggest that cAMP exerts at least two types of long-term regulation of adenylyl cyclase in hepatocytes: a suppressive effect on beta-adrenoceptor acquisition, and a partial, nonselective decrease in adenylyl cyclase activity not involving beta-adrenoceptor down-regulation.", 
    "52": "The antagonist radioligand 1,3-[3H]dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine ([3H]DPCPX) was used to characterize adenosine A1 receptors in membrane preparations from atrial and ventricular myocardium of rat, rabbit, guinea pig and pig. Kd values in crude membranes from guinea pig atria and ventricles (3.3 and 3.0 nM) were higher than those in the other species (ranges, 1.5-1.8 and 1.5-1.9 nM). Bmax values were greater in atria than in ventricles in all four species, and in atria and ventricles of guinea pig (76 and 34 fmol/mg), than in the other species (ranges, 15-17 and undetectable to 12 fmol/mg). In contrast, guinea pig Kd and Bmax values for beta-adrenoceptors, which were labelled with (-)3-[125I]iodocyanopindolol, fell within the range of values for the other three mammalian species. In semipurified membrane preparations from pig, [3H]DPCPX and the agonist radioligand [125I]-N6-4-aminobenzyladenosine appeared to label a similar population of receptors and gave comparable Kd values in atria (0.73 and 0.66 nM) and in ventricles (0.57 and 0.70 nM). In semipurified preparations from pig, the agonist R-(-)-N6-(2-phenylisopropyl)adenosine (R-PIA) displaced [3H]DPCPX in a manner consistent with the presence of both high- and low-affinity adenosine A1 receptors. The data from this study indicate that the density of adenosine A1 receptors in atria is greater than in ventricles, but similar Kd values suggest that the A1 receptor population is the same in the two cardiac tissues. Also, the data demonstrate that the [3H]DPCPX antagonist binding characteristics of guinea pig myocardium differ from those in rat, rabbit and pig.", 
    "53": "We present two patients who were admitted to our Hospital because of repetitive syncopal attacks. The study previous to their admission included electrocardiograms in which the QT interval was normal. During their admission, an striking lengthening of the QT interval, in addition to other criteria of the long QT syndrome, was observed in both patients. We suggest that one normal measurement of the QT interval should not rule out this diagnosis.", 
    "54": "Influence of the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate on the alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptor-mediated positive inotropic effect was studied in the rabbit ventricular myocardium. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (10(-8)-10(-6) M) inhibited the positive inotropic effect mediated by alpha 1-adrenoceptors in a concentration-dependent manner, while the positive inotropy mediated by beta-adrenoceptors was not affected by phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate up to 3 x 10(-7) M. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate at 10(-6) M decreased the beta-mediated effect, but the extent of inhibition was less than that of alpha 1-mediated effect produced by 10(-8) M phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. Thus, the inhibition induced by phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate was 100-fold more selective for alpha 1- than for beta-mediated inotropy. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate at 10(-7) M increased the basal force of contraction in some preparations, but decreased it at 3 x 10(-7) M and higher in a concentration-dependent manner. In membrane fractions derived from the rabbit ventricular muscle, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate did not affect the specific binding of [3H]prazosin. A nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue GTP gamma S shifted the epinephrine-induced displacement curve of [3H]prazosin to the right, but phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate did not affect the curve. Accumulation of [3H]inositol monophosphate induced by alpha 1 stimulation was inhibited by phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. These findings indicate that phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate may induce the selective uncoupling of the myocardial alpha 1-receptor stimulation to activation of phospholipase C, and inhibit selectively the alpha 1-mediated positive inotropy.", 
    "55": "Statistical analysis of difference between groups in change for some variable, adjusting for initial value, is complicated by the presence of intra-individual variation in that variable. We estimate here the asymptotic bias that results from calculating the adjusted between-group difference by ordinary least squares (OLS) from observed data. We also present explicit formulae that use the OLS estimates, the difference between treatment groups in mean initial values, and a measure of the intra-individual variation to compute a corrected estimator and its variance. Alternatively, we can use OLS on transformed data to obtain unbiased estimates, in which we replace initial observed values by conditional Stein estimates of true values. We illustrate the results with data from an observational study and a clinical trial.", 
    "56": "A synthetic 23-mer peptide (M2GlyR) with the amino acid sequence of the putative transmembrane segment M2 of the strychnine-binding alpha subunit of the inhibitory glycine receptor forms anion-selective channels in phospholipid bilayers. The most frequent events show single-channel conductances, gamma, of 25 pS and 49 pS in symmetric 0.5 M KCl with channel open lifetimes, tau o, in the millisecond time range. These properties match those of authentic glycine receptors studied in inside-out patches of cultured rat spinal cord neurons, namely gamma = 27 pS and gamma = 45 pS, and tau o in the millisecond time range. The channel activity of M2GlyR is sequence-specific: 1) a synthetic peptide with the sequence of putative transmembrane segment M1 (M1GlyR), not considered to contribute to the channel lining, does not form channels; 2) an analog of M2GlyR with site-specific substitutions displays distinct channel properties: 2 arginine residues at the N and C termini of M2, postulated to contribute to the anion selectivity of the channel, are substituted by glutamic acids, and the analog peptide ([Glu3,22]M2GlyR) forms cation-selective channels. Further, a four-helix bundle protein (T4M2GlyR) formed by tethering four identical M2GlyR modules to a carrier template forms homogeneous anion-selective channels with gamma = 25 pS in 0.5 M KCl. These channels are blocked by picrotoxin and by the anion channel blockers 9-anthracene carboxylic acid and niflumic acid, but not by an analog of the local anesthetic lidocaine (QX-222), a cation channel blocker. Observed single-channel properties suggest that a pentameric assembly of alpha and beta subunits with a central pore lined by M2 segments would account for conductance properties of the authentic glycine receptor and the 2 arginines at either end of M2 could confer anion specificity to the receptor channel.", 
    "57": "Selection of beta-adrenergic blockers for formulary addition can be a difficult task, especially with the increasing availability of new beta-blockers, as well as the numerous differences in pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of currently available agents. Nevertheless, appropriate evaluation of the important characteristics of beta-blockers should allow selection of the most cost-effective agents for formulary addition. Most importantly, differences in efficacy, product formulation and cost should be carefully considered when making formulary decisions. Notably, evidence from clinical trials indicates differences in efficacy among beta-blockers for post-myocardial infarction prophylaxis, situational anxiety, essential tremor, thyrotoxicosis, migraine prophylaxis and prevention of bleeding associated with oesophageal varices. For many clinical situations, it is also important to select an effective agent that is available in both an oral and intravenous formulation, especially for cardioprotection after acute myocardial infarction and for use in supraventricular arrhythmias. In addition, availability of sustained release products and generic formulations should be considered for their potential to increase compliance and decrease cost, respectively. Comparative drug costs, as well as costs associated with decreased compliance, should also be carefully evaluated. Differences in beta-receptor selectivity, duration of action and presence of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) are also important considerations in the selection of beta-blockers for formulary consideration. Although degree of selectivity is relative, beta 1-selective agents may be less likely to induce bronchospasm in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and may be less likely to affect glucose homeostasis in patients with diabetes mellitus. Duration of action of a beta-blocker is an important consideration for evaluation of efficacy throughout the recommended dosage interval. In addition, beta-blockers with a long duration of action can often be administered once or twice daily, potentially leading to increased compliance and thereby improved effectiveness and economic efficiency. The presence of ISA is an important consideration because certain beta-blockers with ISA may be less effective than those without ISA for certain indications. Factors considered to be less important when making formulary decisions of choice of beta-blockers include the route of elimination, lipophilicity and presence of membrane stabilising activity.", 
    "58": "We have explored the role of phospholipase D (PLD) activation in leukotriene B4 (LTB4)-induced Ca2+ mobilization and degranulation of human neutrophils. Stimulation of [3H]alkyl-acyl-phosphatidylcholine-labeled neutrophils with LTB4 resulted in a rapid accumulation of [3H]alkyl-phosphatidic acid (PA) as well as a somewhat slower accumulation of [3H]alkyl-diglyceride (DG). In the presence of ethanol, PLD catalyzed a transphosphatidylation reaction in which LTB4 increased [3H]alkyl-phosphatidylethanol formation and simultaneously decreased LTB4-induced PA and DG accumulation. This pattern of lipid metabolism is consistent with the conclusion that LTB4 stimulates PLD activity in human neutrophils. Additional studies in which the extracellular and intracellular concentrations of Ca2+ were varied indicated that maximal LTB4-induced PLD activation was dependent upon Ca2+ and potentiated by inhibitors of protein kinase C. The time-course and concentration-response curves for LTB4-induced PLD activation were different from those for LTB4-induced Ca2+ mobilization, as measured by fura-2 fluorescence. On the other hand, the concentration-response curve for LTB4-induced PLD activation was similar to that for LTB4-induced degranulation. Preincubation of the cells with ethanol inhibited LTB4-induced PA and DG accumulation, as well as degranulation, suggesting that one or both of these metabolites were important for this response. In contrast, ethanol had no effect on LTB4-induced Ca2+ mobilization. Propranolol, an inhibitor of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, abolished DG accumulation in response to LTB4 but had no effect on degranulation, suggesting that PA is more important than DG as a mediator of degranulation. Taken collectively, these data indicate that LTB4-induced activation of PLD in human neutrophils is mediated by a Ca(2+)-dependent mechanism, but not by protein kinase C. In addition, PLD activation in these cells may induce degranulation, but not Ca2+ mobilization.", 
    "59": "Electrical-field stimulation caused an endothelium-dependent relaxation in rabbit aorta rings precontracted by phenylephrine. The relaxation was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by morphine, benzalkonium, [D-Pro2,D-Trp7,9]substance P and an beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol. The vasodilatation was enhanced by superoxide dismutase and abolished by haemoglobin and NG-monomethyl-L-arginine. The inhibitory effect of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine was reversed by L-arginine, the precursor of nitric oxide biosynthesis, but not by its enantiomer, D-arginine. These data show that the electrically induced relaxation is independent on nitric oxide released by NK receptors and beta-receptors. Moreover, morphine, by reducing substance P release, decreased the magnitude of electrically induced relaxation, suggesting an indirect role of opioids in the regulation of the peripheral circulation through the control of nitric oxide release. Furthermore our observations confirm the hypothesis that subtypes of beta-adrenoceptors releasing nitric oxide participate in the regulation of vascular tone.", 
    "60": "Recently, we have shown that polarization of an electrogenic H+/K(+)-ATPase pump located in the secretory (luminal) membrane of the frog gastric mucosa is the major factor contributing to the increase in open circuit potential difference (OCPD) induced by voltage clamping. While this transmucosal polarization was not affected by removal of Cl- and Na+ and minimally affected by increasing the K+ concentration to 79 mM in both nutrient and secretory solutions, it was markedly reduced by 10(-3) M famotidine (beta blocker) or 10(-4) M omeprazole (H+/K(+)-ATPase inhibitor) in the nutrient solution. In present experiments, the effects of three other inhibitors of H+ secretion were examined, namely, cimetidine (beta blocker), SCH 28,080 (H+/K(+)-ATPase inhibitor) and SCN- (non-specific inhibitor). While cimetidine and SCH 28,080 markedly reduced the polarization induced by voltage clamp, SCN- affected the polarization to a lesser extent. These data further support the electrogenicity of the frog gastric mucosa proton pump and the lack of a direct effect of SCN- on the pump.", 
    "61": "Type I diabetes [insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM)] is an autoimmune disease associated with the destruction of pancreatic beta cells. Serum from patients with IDDM increased L-type calcium channel activity of insulin-producing cells and of GH3 cells derived from a pituitary tumor. The subsequent increase in the concentration of free cytoplasmic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) was associated with DNA fragmentation typical of programmed cell death or apoptosis. These effects of the serum were prevented by adding a blocker of voltage-activated L-type Ca2+ channels. When the serum was depleted of immunoglobulin M (IgM), it no longer affected [Ca2+]i. An IgM-mediated increase in Ca2+ influx may thus be part of the autoimmune reaction associated with IDDM and contribute to the destruction of beta cells in vivo.", 
    "62": "Although beta-adrenergic blocking agents are known to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, the mechanism of this protective effect is not well understood. The recent demonstration that beta blockers selectively blunt the increased morning risk of myocardial infarction suggests that these agents block the pathophysiologic consequences of stressors concentrated in the morning. We determined the effect of nadolol on the hemodynamic and hemostatic responses to mental stress and isometric exertion (handgrip), 2 potential triggers of infarction. The study was conducted in 15 subjects with mild systemic hypertension, using a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover design. Nadolol reduced systolic pressure and heart rate after mental stress. Poststress systolic pressure was 139 +/- 4 mm Hg during therapy with nadolol versus 161 +/- 4 mm Hg during placebo administration (p < 0.05). Heart rate increased to 61 +/- 2 during nadolol therapy versus 89 +/- 5 beats/min during placebo therapy (p < 0.05). The systolic pressure increase was similar during therapy with nadolol and placebo (29 +/- 2 vs 33 +/- 2 beats/min, p = NS); however, heart rate increase was less during nadolol therapy (4 +/- 1 vs 12 +/- 4 vs beats/min, p < 0.01). The responses to handgrip and their modification during nadolol therapy were similar to those observed after mental stress. Neither platelet aggregability nor fibrinolytic potential was altered by nadolol. Thus, nadolol modified hemodynamic indexes without altering the hemostatic indexes measured. This hemodynamic effect may contribute to the decrease in morning cardiovascular events by beta-adrenergic blockers and their well-documented cardioprotective effect.", 
    "63": "The antihypertensive effects of drugs are partly determined by characteristics of the patients treated. A randomized, double-blind study used 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring to compare the effects of 2 beta blockers, bisoprolol (10 to 20 mg; n = 107) and atenolol (50 to 100 mg; n = 96), administered once daily in 4 population groups. After a 4-week placebo period, patients with an office diastolic BP between 95 and 114 mm Hg were stratified according to race and age, and were randomly assigned to treatment with bisoprolol or atenolol for 8 weeks. BP averages measured by automated monitoring for the 24-hour periods were compared between groups. In elderly patients, the reductions in both average 24-hour systolic and diastolic BP were greater with bisoprolol than with atenolol (13 +/- 3/13 +/- 1 mm Hg [n = 23] vs 4 +/- 2/6 +/- 1 mm Hg [n = 30]; p < 0.01). Similarly, bisoprolol produced greater reductions in average 24-hour diastolic BP than did atenolol in nonblack patients (16 +/- 2/12 +/- 1 mm Hg [n = 85] vs 12 +/- 2/9 +/- 1 mm Hg [n = 83]; p = 0.02). Bisoprolol and atenolol were similar in the black (10 +/- 5/9 +/- 3 mm Hg [n = 22] and 10 +/- 6/6 +/- 3 mm Hg [n = 13], respectively) and young (15 +/- 1/11 +/- 1 mm Hg [n = 84] and 16 +/- 2/10 +/- 1 mm Hg [n = 66], respectively) groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "64": "Statistical studies repeatedly have shown an association between systemic insulin resistance and a preponderance of highly glycolytic, relatively insulin-insensitive muscle fibers as well as a low density of muscle capillaries. The nature of the relationship between these observations is, however, not clear. Female rats were made hyperinsulinemic for 7 days by implantation of osmotic minipumps. Elevated adrenergic activity and secretion of glucocorticoids were controlled by another minipump with propranolol and adrenalectomy was controlled with glucocorticoid substitution. This resulted in hyperinsulinemia and moderate hypoglycemia, the latter probably counteracted by overeating and increased glucagon secretion, as indicated by increased body weight and lower liver glycogen contents, respectively. Systemic insulin sensitivity was increased and measured with a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique. This was paralleled by an elevated glucose utilization estimated as uptake of 2-deoxyglucose in parametrial, retroperitoneal, and inguinal adipose tissues and the soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles. Glycogen synthesis was also elevated in the soleus muscle. Muscle fiber composition changed with hyperinsulinemia and elevated 2-deoxyglucose uptake toward more fast-twitch, type II, particularly type IIb fibers, whereas the proportion of slow-twitch, type I fibers, diminished. Capillary density was elevated per unit muscle surface area as well as per muscle fiber. This was paralleled by increased insulin sensitivity systemically and in muscles. These results suggest that muscle fiber composition alterations may be a consequence rather than a cause of hyperinsulinemia and that capillarization rather than fiber composition is of importance for insulin sensitivity in muscle.",

In the control study, the QT interval was measured at six paced cycle lengths (600, 540, 500, 460, 430 and 400 ms) both in the basal state and after autonomic blockade (intravenous propranolol, 0.2 mg/kg, and intravenous atropine, 0.04 mg/kg); oral quinidine was then administered at a daily dosage of 1,200 mg for 3 to 4 days, after which the QT duration was reassessed using the same method in a second study.",

Quinidine exhibited a prominent but opposite effect on the mean slope of the regression curves in basal conditions (from 0.27 +/- 0.10 to 0.20 +/- 0.07, p < 0.05) and after withdrawal of autonomic modulation (from 0.14 +/- 0.05 to 0.19 +/- 0.05, p < 0.05), thus annulling the differences observed between the two states in the control study.", 
    "69": "A quinidine-induced increase in QT duration as cycle length is prolonged is consistent with a reverse use dependence effect on ventricular repolarization. This effect is not evident in the basal state owing to interaction of quinidine-related vagolytic effect with the autonomic tone. Reverse use dependence and vagolytic activity on ventricular tissue indicate two potentially undesirable effects that could play a role in the lack of efficacy or proarrhythmic effect of quinidine.",

    "74": "Propranolol was extremely effective against ventricular fibrillation. Methacholine and oxotremorine provided a significant, although less marked, protection and caused much less impairment of contractility compared with propranolol. Muscarinic receptor activation may represent a new approach to prevention of sudden cardiac death, particularly when beta-blockers are contraindicated and negative inotropic effects are to be avoided.", 
    "75": "This study assessed the efficacy of the combination of sotalol and either quinidine or procainamide in preventing sustained ventricular tachycardia inducibility and recurrence and prospectively evaluated the ability of the drug combination to prevent ventricular tachycardia recurrence when the arrhythmia remained inducible but was modified.", 
    "76": "Individual antiarrhythmic drugs are often ineffective in preventing the induction and recurrence of sustained ventricular tachycardia. Beta-adrenergic blockade and prolongation of refractoriness may be important components of successful antiarrhythmic therapy in patients with ventricular tachycardia. We reasoned that the combination of sotalol, which has beta-adrenergic blocking properties and prolonged ventricular refractoriness, and quinidine or procainamide, two agents that slow conduction and prolong refractory periods, would be effective therapy in such patients.", 
    "77": "We administered low dose sotalol (205 +/- 84 mg/day) plus quinidine sulfate (1,278 +/- 479 mg/day) or procainamide (2,393 +/- 1,423 mg/day) to 50 patients with spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation and inducible ventricular tachycardia.", 
    "78": "In 21 (46%) of 46 patients, ventricular tachycardia was rendered noninducible at electrophysiologic study (group I), and in 17 patients (37%), inducible tachycardia was modified according to prospectively identified criteria (group II), for a combined 83% response rate. Ventricular refractory periods increased from 252 +/- 24 to 316 +/- 28 ms and from 265 +/- 33 to 316 +/- 24 ms in groups I and II, respectively (p < 0.001), but from 234 +/- 19 to only 286 +/- 13 ms in the group of patients with unmodified ventricular tachycardia inducibility (n = 8, group III, p < 0.001). Cycle length of induced ventricular tachycardia slowed from 324 +/- 62 to 432 +/- 70 ms in group II patients (p < 0.001), whereas it slowed less in group III patients (279 +/- 73 to 314 +/- 63 ms, p = NS). Forty-two of the 50 patients (including all patients in groups I and II) were discharged on treatment with the drug combination. After 25 +/- 19 months of follow-up, the actuarial recurrence rate of ventricular tachycardia was 6%, 6% and 11% at 1, 2 and 3 years, respectively. Among patients in whom this drug combination was unsuccessful at electrophysiologic study (group III) and in those who received alternative therapy after combination therapy was discontinued because of side effects, actuarial recurrence rates were 9%, 14% and 32% at 1, 2 and 3 years, respectively.", 
    "79": "The combination of sotalol plus quinidine or procainamide markedly prolongs ventricular refractoriness and slows induced ventricular tachycardia in a high proportion of patients. Patients with modified or noninducible tachycardia have a low rate of arrhythmia recurrence in follow-up. This drug combination deserves further evaluation.", 
    "80": "To explore a mechanism for spatial recruitment of capillaries, this study determined whether the arterioles controlling capillary perfusion, which typically arise as sequential branches along a transverse arteriole, could respond differently from each other in situ in a spatially ordered way. Diameter changes were measured for these arterioles at a known location in the intact microvasculature in the cremaster muscle of anesthetized Golden hamsters (N = 67); each arteriole controls separate capillary groups. These arterioles all had the same concentration dependence to locally (by micropipette) applied norepinephrine (NE, 10(-9) to 10(-3) mol/L), and 10(-9) mol/L NE did not induce diameter changes when applied locally to individual vessels. However, 10(-9) mol/L NE added to the tissue superfusate, or 5% added superfusate oxygen (also locally subthreshold), each induced significant diameter changes (both constrictions and dilations), in different branches, that were presumably due to summation of individually subthreshold events that changed the prevailing conditions at the point of observation. These significant diameter changes were related to the maximal diameter or to initial tone of the branches, but these changes occurred in different ways for NE versus oxygen. With NE, the branch arterioles that constricted (versus dilated) were significantly larger (maximal diameter, 22.3 +/- 2.6 versus 15.9 +/- 2.1 microns) and had higher tone (fractional constriction, 0.53 +/- 0.05 versus 0.63 +/- 0.05); with oxygen, those that constricted were the same size as those that dilated (maximal diameter, 28.6 +/- 1.1 versus 30.5 +/- 2.7 microns), but constrictors had lower tone (fractional constriction, 0.49 +/- 0.04 versus 0.39 +/- 0.06).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "81": "By collecting in situ the blood flowing from the thyroid, the authors have demonstrated that noradrenaline injected in a dose 1 microgram/kg into rabbit thyroid artery enhanced triiodothyronine secretion without changing thyroxin secretion. This process was inhibited by prazosin, an alpha-adrenoblocker, in a dose 1 microgram/kg, injected 5 min before noradrenaline, but not by propranolol, a beta-adrenoblocker. Phenylephrine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, in a dose 1 microgram/kg, injected into the thyroid artery, influenced thyroid hormone secretion similarly as noradrenaline. The T3/T4.100 ratio taken as an indicator of T4 thyroid conversion increased under the effect of noradrenaline injection after prazosin. Thus, in our experiment noradrenaline activated thyroid function via stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptor system. Hence, catecholamines are capable of directly influencing thyroid functional activity.", 
    "82": "Relationships between adrenergic exposure (stress, administration of adrenomimetics and adrenoblockers) and rat sensitivity to exogenic insulin were studied. The participation of beta-adrenoceptors in regulation of insulin sensitivity of the body was revealed. Drugs characterized by beta-adrenomimetic activity (adrenalin, novodrin, partusisten) enhanced insulin sensitivity upon prolonged (for 24 h) administration. One-hour immobilization stress also enhanced insulin sensitivity. The authors discuss beta-adrenoceptor desensitization phenomenon as a possible mechanism of the before events. Obsidan (a nonselective beta-adrenoblocker) also augmented insulin sensitivity. A single administration of partusisten (an adrenomimetic with a predominant affinity to beta 2-adrenoceptors) reduced insulin sensitivity. Augmentation of beta-adrenergic processes at the expense of beta-adrenoblockers (aminasin, haloperidol, butyroxan) effects also reduced insulin sensitivity. An inverse correlation between the capacity of adrenergic exposures to influence glycogen content in striated muscles and their effects on insulin coma latency (insulin sensitivity market) was detected. This relationship confirms the role of beta-adrenoceptors in insulin sensitivity regulation.", 
    "83": "Ventromedial hypothalamic (VMH) lesions cause excessive fat accumulation in white adipose tissue (WAT), and brown adipose tissue (BAT); however, little information is available on whether or not cell proliferation occurs in WAT and BAT after VMH lesioning. In this study, we determined the DNA content and thymidine incorporation in unilateral parametrial WAT and interscapular BAT 0, 1, 3, and 7 days after VMH lesioning, and examined the mechanism of increased DNA content in WAT. In rats with VMH lesions, the weight of WAT and BAT had increased significantly at 7 days, and the DNA content and thymidine incorporation of WAT had increased significantly at 3 days and continued to increase for up to 7 days, while those of BAT did not increase for as long as 7 days after VMH lesioning. Restricted food intake according to the pair-feeding method partially inhibited the increased DNA content in WAT. The increased DNA content in WAT was mostly restored but not completely by the administration of anti-insulin antibody, and by administration of propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker. The results demonstrated that VMH lesions induced DNA synthesis in WAT early after VMH lesioning, but did not induce DNA synthesis in BAT, and suggested that either hyperinsulinemia or a beta-adrenergic receptor mechanism or both may be responsible for the increased DNA content in WAT.", 
    "84": "In humans and animal models there is evidence that prenatal nicotine exposure causes lasting deficits in cognitive performance. The current study examined the cognitive effects of prenatal exposure of rats to 2 mg/kg/day of nicotine. This dose did not cause significant deficits in maternal weight gain, offspring litter size, or pup weight. The control offspring showed the normal ontogeny of spontaneous alternation from near chance (50%) performance to 80%-85% alternation. In contrast, the nicotine-exposed rats had the opposite progression with abnormally high alternation on days 22-30 and abnormally low alternation on days 35-52. Acquisition of choice accuracy performance on the radial-arm maze (RAM) was not altered in a major way by nicotine exposure. Minor nicotine-induced changes in choice accuracy were seen during the initial trials of acquisition. The nicotine exposed female offspring had a significantly longer response duration. Prenatal nicotine exposure did significantly alter the effects of subsequent drug challenges on choice accuracy performance. The nicotine-exposed male offspring were significantly more responsive to the amnestic effects of the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine. In a subsequent challenge, the effects of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol were examined. A significant dose-related impairment in choice accuracy was seen in the control rats. In contrast, the nicotine-exposed rats did not show any significant response to propranolol. This decreased responsiveness to adrenergic challenge parallels the reduction in adrenergic response to nicotine challenge we previously found in littermates to the rats of the current study. Prenatal nicotine exposure causes subtle alterations in cognitive performance that can be magnified by challenges of nicotinic and adrenergic systems.", 
    "85": "1. The actions of muscarinic agonists and antagonists upon the Ca2+ current (ICa) in acutely dissociated magnocellular cholinergic basal forebrain neurones from 11 to 14-day-old postnatal rats were studied using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. 2. In all cells studied, muscarinic agonists inhibited a transient component of high-voltage-activated (HVA) current, but had no effect upon the low-voltage-activated (LVA) current. The mean IC50 values for ACh and oxotremorine methiodide (oxo-M), obtained from non-cumulative dose-response curves, were 204 and 363 nM respectively. Superfusion with the K+ channel blocker, tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA; 30 mM) shifted the ACh dose-response curve to the right giving an IC50 value of 22:9 microM. 3. Pirenzepine (0.1-1 microM) and methoctramine (0.03-0.3 microM) produced parallel shifts to the right in the agonist dose-response curves. Schild analysis of the agonist dose ratios yielded pA2 (negative log of the apparent dissociation constant KB) values for pirenzepine and methoctramine of 6.8 and 8.2 respectively, indicating the involvement of an M2 receptor subtype. 4. In the presence of GTP-gamma-S (10-500 microM) in the patch pipette, the agonist-induced inhibition of ICa became irreversible. Dialysis with GDP-beta-S (1 mM) abolished all agonist-induced inhibition of the Ca2+ current. The agonist-induced inhibition of ICa was totally blocked by pretreatment with pertussis toxin (500 ng ml-1) but unaffected by preincubation with cholera toxin (500 ng ml-1). Superfusion with 8-bromo cAMP (0.5-1 mM) did not mimic or prevent the effect of agonist application. 5. Inhibition of the Ca2+ current by muscarinic agonists was only partially blocked by omega-conotoxin GVIA (omega-CgTX GVIA), with approximately 46% of the agonist-sensitive current being resistant to omega-CgTX GVIA. Both the agonist- and omega-CgTX GVIA-sensitive components of the current were abolished following maximal inhibition of ICa by GTP-gamma-S. 6. These results indicate that inhibition of the Ca2+ current by muscarinic agonists is mediated via an M2 muscarinic receptor coupled to a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein. The possible modulation of multiple HVA Ca2+ channels by muscarinic agonists and the role that these receptors may play in presynaptic modulation of neurotransmitter release are discussed.", 
    "86": "The effect of pharmacological autonomic blockade on digoxin-induced electrocardiographic changes at rest and during exercise was studied in nine healthy men. The subjects performed bicycle exercise tests on four occasions after: (1) intravenous injection of sodium chloride, (2) intravenous injection of propranolol and atropine, (3) oral ingestion of digoxin 0.5 mg daily for 2 weeks and intravenous injection of sodium chloride, and (4) oral ingestion of digoxin 0.5 mg daily for 2 weeks and intravenous injection of propranolol and atropine. The ST-T segment was significantly depressed after digoxin plus sodium chloride and digoxin plus propranolol and atropine in comparison with sodium chloride only and propranolol and atropine only. The digoxin-induced ST-T changes after sodium chloride and propranolol-atropine injections were not significantly different. Thus, judging from the results of this study, an effect mediated via the autonomic nervous system is an unlikely explanation of digitalis-induced ST-T changes.", 
    "87": "We prospectively studied the effects of oral labetalol therapy in patients with moderate to severe pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH). The outcome variables were blood pressure control, effect on umbilical artery flow velocity waveforms (UAFVW) and fetal outcome. Forty-two patients were recruited, all had moderate to severe PIH. The mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) on entry were 154 +/- 7 mmHg and 104 +/- 5 mmHg, respectively. All had significant proteinuria. After 1 week on labetalol therapy, 85% of patients had their blood pressure controlled. The reduction in both SBP and DBP was statistically significant. There were no significant changes in UAFVW, Resistance Index (RI), uric acid or platelets. The mean fetal age on entry was 246 +/- 10 days while gestation at delivery was 258 +/- 17 days. The mean birth weight was 2712 +/- 609 g. No perinatal mortality occurred in this study. Labetalol is an effective drug in controlling blood pressure and does not adversely affect the UAFVW. No neonatal problems were attributed directly to the drug. Fetal outcome was satisfactory despite the 12 fetuses that were growth-retarded. Labetalol allows safe prolongation of pregnancies complicated by PIH.", 
    "88": "Acute blood loss evoked an increase in the spike activity of the pyloric sphincter' smooth muscles, those of the duodenum and ileum. No such effect was found in joint blockade of alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors. The increase in the spike activity seems to be due to an effect of endogenous catecholamines upon activating alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors of the pyloric sphincter, duodenum and ileum.", 
    "89": "In elderly patients, elevation of systolic blood pressure represents a more serious risk than elevation of diastolic blood pressure. Major trials of antihypertensive therapy in the elderly include the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program, the Swedish Trial of Older Patients with Hypertension, the Medical Research Council Trial, and the Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study Group. Results of these trails indicate that, even for very elderly patients, reducing blood pressure reduces both morbidity and mortality from stroke and cardiac disease. Diuretics and calcium antagonists stand out as particularly efficacious in elderly hypertensive patients. beta-Adrenergic blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may be less suitable in this patient population. Studies of the effects of antihypertensive therapy on the quality of life indicate that elderly patients can easily tolerate efficacious doses of antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "90": "The effects on renal function and urinary albumin excretion of 7 years of antihypertensive treatment compared to the effects of normal aging were studied in a random sample of 40 men with newly diagnosed primary hypertension and in 17 normotensive men of the same age, respectively. The hypertensives were treated with metoprolol either as monotherapy (n = 21) or combined with hydrochlorothiazide or hydralazine. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR; inulin clearance), renal blood flow (RBF; para-aminohippurate clearance), renal vascular resistance (RVR), and the 24 h urinary albumin excretion were determined. GFR was significantly reduced from 104 +/- 15 mL/min (mean +/- SD) to 86 +/- 20 mL/min (P < .001) in the hypertensive group, but the reduction was not significantly greater than in the normotensive group. As judged from the study of a subgroup of the hypertensives, most of the decrease in GFR occurred early as an immediate drug-induced, functionally explained decrease. The changes in RBF and RVR after 7 years of treatment did not differ significantly from those due to normal aging. RVR remained higher and RBF remained lower in the hypertensives than in the normotensives. The urinary albumin excretion in the hypertensives was significantly reduced after 7 years but remained higher than in the normotensives. In conclusion, the changes in renal function and hemodynamics seen after long-term treatment with metoprolol in primary hypertension were not significantly different from the changes caused by normal aging in normotensives.", 
    "91": "The HL-60 cell line was cultured in a serum-free medium and exposed to various concentrations of EPI. The effects on cell growth, differentiation and beta-adrenergic response were followed during the culture period of 72 h. Short-term exposure (3 min) to EPI (1 nM-1 mM) in the presence of theophylline (4 mM) caused a dose-dependent increase of cAMP levels with a maximum of 1500% above basal levels. When the cells were exposed to EPI (1 nM-10 microM) for 72 h, a dose-dependent increase of cAMP levels with a maximum of 60% above basal levels. Sustained exposure to EPI generated a dose-dependent desensitization of the beta-adrenergic signal system. After EPI treatment for 72 h, IPR (10 microM for 3 min) in the presence of theophylline (4 mM) increased cAMP-levels by only 80% above baseline level (cAMP levels after maintained exposure to EPI), compared to 1080% above unstimulated level in control cells. The alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker PHENT (10 microM) did not affect baseline cAMP level or IPR-dependent cAMP response, but a mixture of EPI and PHENT increased the response to IPR. The HL-60 cell growth was not influenced by EPI. However, after repeated exposure to EPI for 72 h a concentration-dependent increase of HL-60 differentiation was demonstrated. Differentiation was not influenced by PHENT. These results suggest a differentiation induction due to a beta-adrenergic-induced cAMP elevation.", 
    "92": "In congestive heart failure, down-regulation of myocardial beta-adrenoceptors (beta-AR) due to an elevated sympathetic tone is well known. In infancy and childhood, heart failure is usually related to congenital heart disease (CHD). Therefore, 71 samples of right atrial tissue of infants and children with CHD undergoing cardiac surgery were studied for beta-adrenoceptor density and distribution of the beta 1-/beta 2-AR subtypes. In 49 cases, the coupling of the beta-AR to the adenylate cyclase (AC) was examined. In a further study of 19 myocardial samples, AC was selectively stimulated with beta 1- or beta 2-AR whereas the other subtype was blocked by an antagonist. The following results were obtained: (1) Infants and children with severe acyanotic or cyanotic CHD had severely reduced beta-AR densities. (2) In most of the cases, the beta-AR down regulation is beta 1-subtype selective, but in critically ill newborns with congenital aortic valve stenosis or transposition of the great arteries, there is additional significant beta 2-AR down-regulation. In Fallot patients treated with the beta-antagonist propranolol, a significant increased beta-AR number compared with untreated Fallot patients was found. (3) beta-Adrenoceptor reduction in CHD is correlated with elevated noradrenaline plasma levels, thus proving a sympathetic dysregulation. (4) In CHD with moderate hemodynamic load, beta 2-AR coupling to AC was markedly more efficient than beta 1-AR coupling. The small number of myocardial beta 2-AR produced most of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate. (5) In severe acyanotic and cyanotic CHD, a partial decoupling of the beta 2-AR to the AC occurred.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "93": "(+/-)-1'-[18F]Fluorometoprol 4 was prepared from desisopropylmetoprolol and [18F]fluoroisopropyl tosylate 2 with a radiochemical yield of 2% [corrected for decay to end of bombardment (EOB), synthesis time 90 min]. Synthon 2 was prepared from (S)-1,2-propanediol di(p-toluenesulfonate) in 45% radiochemical yield (EOB, 40 min). Compound 4 shows in two in vitro assays a similar affinity at beta-adrenoceptors (about 0.3 microM) as metoprolol 5, but with a slightly higher beta 1/beta 2-adrenoceptor selectivity ratio (48.6 vs 30.7). In vivo experiments with 4 showed almost no receptor-mediated uptake in the heart, probably because the affinity of (fluoro)metoprolol for the beta 1-adrenoceptors is too low for successful imaging. However, the in vitro experiments suggest that the fluoroisopropyl group is suitable for the synthesis of [18F]fluorinated beta 1-adrenergic receptor binding ligands.", 
    "94": "We have characterized binding of (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) to the beta-adrenergic receptor population in membrane from longissimus and semitendinosus muscles and subcutaneous adipose tissue (middle and outer layers) of pigs weighing 100 to 120 kg at slaughter. Linearity of specific binding with increasing membrane protein concentration was confirmed for muscle and adipose tissue. Specific binding was saturable; the beta-receptor population showed a high affinity for the radioligand. Half-maximal binding was achieved at similar concentrations of the tracer (.48 to .73 nM) in all tissues. Maximal binding (B max) per milligram of protein for skeletal muscle was approximately half of that for adipose tissue (P < or = .05) and was greater (P < or = .05) in membrane from the middle than in membrane from the outer layer of adipose tissue. Adipocyte membrane preparations yielded Kd estimates similar to those obtained with adipose tissue, but Bmax values were greater (P < or = .05). Kinetic rate constants were estimated and used to calculate the Kd for comparison to that derived from nonlinear regression analysis of Scatchard plots. Association (k1) and dissociation (k2) estimates were similar between tissues and the resulting Kd values were comparable to those derived from equilibrium data. Stereospecificity of binding was verified using the (-) and (+) isomers of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol; selectivity for the (-) form ranged from 8- to 19-fold. Overall, the most notable differences among tissues were in receptor density expressed per milligram of protein. Kinetic rate constants, Kd estimates, and the degree of selectivity for (-)-isoproterenol were similar.", 
    "95": "Apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME) is a rare form of low renin hypertension caused by deficiency of 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 beta-HSD), the enzyme responsible for conversion of cortisol to the bio-inactive metabolite, cortisone. This results in prolonged cortisol half-life, activation of type I (mineralocorticoid) receptors by cortisol, sodium and fluid retention, and consequent childhood-onset hypertension. The cortisol secretion rate is low, perhaps due to cortisol's binding to type II (glucocorticoid) receptors and suppressing corticotropin secretion. Patients with AME thus lack stigmata of Cushing's syndrome. To evaluate any potential contribution of the type II (glucocorticoid) receptor to the development of hypertension in AME patients, we administered RU486, a steroid analogue that acts as a pure type II receptor blocker. Selective glucocorticoid receptor blockade did not decrease blood pressure in our patient; instead, a significant increase in average blood pressure was observed (125.1 +/- 1.7 pre-RU486 v 144.7 +/- 1.2 during RU486 treatment, P = .0001). We conclude that the type II receptor does not contribute to the development of hypertension in patients with AME.", 
    "96": "Because of difficulties in separating the systemic from local effect, the role of presynaptic beta 2-adrenergic receptors in facilitating the neural release of norepinephrine has not been defined previously in humans in vivo. To determine whether stimulation of presynaptic beta-receptors alters local release of norepinephrine, we examined the effects on norepinephrine kinetics of 60 and 400 ng/min intra-arterial isoproterenol in seven healthy male volunteers. Isoproterenol, 60 ng/min, increased forearm norepinephrine spill-over sixfold from a baseline spillover of 0.45 +/- 0.08 to 2.89 +/- 0.69 ng/min (p < 0.01), whereas 400 ng/min isoproterenol increased forearm norepinephrine spillover to 13.25 +/- 2.49 ng/min (p < 0.005), a 29-fold increase above baseline. Coinfusion of 20 to 40 micrograms/min propranolol with 400 ng/min isoproterenol in four subjects significantly attenuated the isoproterenol-induced increase in local norepinephrine spillover to 2.09 +/- 0.92 ng/min (p < 0.05 versus 400 ng/min isoproterenol). This study shows that presynaptic beta-adrenergic receptors facilitate local release of norepinephrine in vivo in humans.", 
    "97": "A beta 1-adrenergic receptor (beta 1AR) clone, designated Clone 5, was isolated from a BALB/c mouse liver genomic library screened at low stringency with a human brain beta 2 AR cDNA probe. Sequence analysis of Clone 5 revealed a 1,395-bp open reading frame encoding a 464-amino-acid polypeptide. The predicted protein exhibited structural features characteristic of members of the G-protein-coupled receptor family including seven hydrophobic segments corresponding to putative transmembrane domains, a potential N-linked glycosylation site near the amino-terminus, and multiple potential phosphorylation sites in the third cytoplasmic loop and carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic tail. The sequence of the Clone 5-encoded protein was nearly identical to those previously reported for the rat and human beta 1 ARs. Potentially important differences were noted in the third cytoplasmic loop and carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic tail. Reverse transcription-primer extension studies of adult mouse brain RNA demonstrated the predominant transcriptional start site to be 415 nucleotides upstream of the translational start site. A GC-box precedes the transcriptional start site by 40 nucleotides. No consensus TATA or CAAT box sequences were identified in this region. Southern blot analysis of a Chinese hamster x mouse somatic cell hybrid panel and of the progeny of an inter-subspecies backcross mapped the Clone 5-encoded gene to mouse chromosome 19, the localization previously determined for the mouse homolog of the human beta 1AR gene. Binding studies of transient COS-7 transfectants and stable L-cell transfectants confirmed that Clone 5 encodes a beta AR of the beta 1 subtype. A probe derived from Clone 5 selectively hybridized in Northern blot studies to mRNA isolated from adult mouse cerebrum, lung, and heart. These data should serve as the basis for further studies of the regulation and function of the beta 1AR.", 
    "98": "The effect of topical isoproterenol (5.8 x 10(-5) M) on the microvascular stasis and histologic injury produced in the rat gastric mucosa by absolute ethanol was investigated using in vivo microscopic and histologic techniques. Our findings show that in control animals, absolute ethanol applied to the gastric mucosa caused a rapid decrease in microvascular blood flow, leading to complete stasis by 3 min. In contrast, prior treatment of the gastric mucosa with topical isoproterenol increased microvascular blood flow initially and then maintained microvascular flow in the majority of microvessels studied after the application of absolute ethanol. Treatment with topical isoproterenol also reduced the histologic injury score and percent mucosal necrosis caused by absolute ethanol. Pretreatment of animals with a beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (2 mg/kg subcutaneously), completely blocked these protective effects. We observed no systemic effects attributable to the topical use of isoproterenol. These results indicate that prior treatment of the gastric mucosa with topical isoproterenol maintains microvascular blood flow and reduces the deep histologic injury in the stomach caused by 100% ethanol.", 
    "99": "The beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol binds to serotonin (5HT) receptors (5HT1B > 5HT1A > 5HT2) in brain membranes. We have recently demonstrated that 5HT acts through 5HT2 receptors in rat Leydig cells to release CRF, which, in turn, inhibits hCG-stimulated cAMP production and steroidogenesis. These observations prompted us to study the effects of propranolol on CRF secretion and cAMP and testosterone production in cultured rat Leydig cells. Treatment with (-)propranolol increased CRF release and inhibited basal and hCG-stimulated cAMP and steroidogenesis, with effects evident at 0.1 microM, an IC50 of 6 microM, and reduction of stimulated levels to near basal at 100 microM. These effects of the drug were prevented by pretreatment of cultures with the 5HT2 receptor antagonist ketanserin or a CRF antagonist or antiserum. Furthermore, propranolol increased the level of 5HT in the incubation medium of cultured Leydig cells. The (+)isomer of propranolol had minor effects on these parameters. Increasing concentrations of (-)propranolol displaced the binding of [125I] +/- 1-[2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophyryl]-2-amino propane hydrochloride (DOI), a selective 5HT2 ligand, to Leydig cell membranes (IC50, 0.2 microM), and (+)propanolol showed weaker potency. The inhibitory actions of propranolol were exerted through its blockade of the Leydig cell 5HT2 low affinity receptor, which has functional properties of an autoreceptor, with consequent increases in 5HT and stimulation of CRF release through 5HT action at the high affinity site. The serotonergic actions of propranolol were prevented by DOI, an inhibitor of 5HT actions at the high affinity site. In addition, the propranolol-induced blockade of the low affinity site further increased the cAMP and steroidogenic responses to gonadotropin over those observed with DOI treatment alone. These studies demonstrate that propranolol acts as an antagonist at the Leydig cell low affinity 5HT2 receptor and stimulates CRF release via a serotonergic mechanism, with consequent inhibition of cAMP generation and steroidogenesis. This serotonergic action of the drug could contribute to the impairment of sexual function reported during propranolol treatment in man.", 
    "100": "5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a commonly employed chemotherapeutic agent. Among the various toxicities associated with 5-FU, cardiovascular toxicity, consisting principally of acute myocardial ischemia and/or myocardial infarction, has been reported in up to 8.5% of patients treated with this drug. While 5-FU-induced coronary vasospasm has been considered as a potential basis for such clinical toxicity, this hypothesis remains unsubstantiated by laboratory investigation. Accordingly, the present study was designed to investigate the hypothesis that 5-FU induces reversible vasoconstriction of vascular smooth muscle and to study the cellular mechanisms of such vasomotor alterations. To investigate the effects of 5-FU on the vasoreactivity of vascular smooth muscle, 479 exposures were performed in 105 rings of aorta freshly isolated from 23 New Zealand white rabbits. Vasoconstriction was documented in 20 of 86 (23%) rings exposed to 5-FU at 7 x 10(-5) M, 45 of 83 (54%) rings exposed to 5-FU at 7 x 10(-4) M, and 41 of 49 (84%) rings exposed to 5-FU at 7 x 10(-3) M. In each case, 5-FU-induced vasoconstriction was endothelium independent. Pretreatment of rings with 10(-9) M staurosporine, a protein kinase C (PK-C) inhibitor, reduced 5-FU-induced vasoconstriction from 25.0 +/- 6.5 to 2.5 +/- 1.7 mg; staurosporine at a concentration of 10(-8) M abolished 5-FU-induced vasoconstriction. Pretreatment of rings with 10(-7) M phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate, an activator of PK-C, increased the magnitude of 5-FU-induced vasoconstriction 23-fold, from 49.7 +/- 11.1 mg before to 1163.6 +/- 276.4 mg after phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (P = 0.0002). Neomycin, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide turnover, did not alter the magnitude of 5-FU-induced vasoconstriction. Membrane receptor blockers, including the alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker phentolamine, the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker propranolol, the H1 receptor inhibitor diphenhydramine, the H2 receptor inhibitor cimetidine, the Ca2+ channel blockers verapamil and diltiazem, and the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin all failed to alter the magnitude of 5-FU-induced vasoconstriction. Furthermore, the 5-FU-related compounds uracil and floxuridine did not produce vasoconstriction. Finally, 5-FU-induced vasoconstriction was abolished by nitroglycerin. These results indicate that (a) 5-FU causes direct, endothelium-independent vasoconstriction of vascular smooth muscle in vitro, (b) this vasomotor response involves activation of PK-C, and (c) this response is independent of vasoactive cell membrane receptors, phosphoinositide turnover, or activation of the cyclooxygenase pathway.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "101": "To determine whether endogenous tachykinins are released in allergic airway response to contribute to bronchoconstriction and whether neutral endopeptidase (NEP), which effectively cleaves tachykinins, modulates that bronchoconstriction, we studied the effects of the NEP inhibitor phosphoramidon on bronchoconstriction induced by allergic response in anesthetized guinea pigs. We mechanically ventilated the guinea pigs sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA) in a bodyplethysmograph and measured the pulmonary resistance (RL). We exposed the sensitized guinea pigs to doubling concentrations of OVA aerosols from 2(-5)% (wt/vol) until the transpulmonary pressure increased more than twofold from the baseline. After the final exposure, we exposed them to phosphoramidon (10(-4) M) or its vehicle. Phosphoramidon significantly potentiated the increased RL induced by OVA challenge. Phosphoramidon also significantly potentiated the increased RL in the guinea pigs treated with atropine, but the potentiation was significantly reduced. In contrast, phosphoramidon failed to potentiate the increased RL induced by OVA in guinea pigs pretreated with capsaicin. These results suggest that 1) endogenous tachykinin-like substances are released in allergic airway response and that 2) when endogenous NEP is inhibited in the guinea pig airways in vivo, the substances contribute to bronchoconstriction by partly activating the parasympathetic nerve.", 
    "102": "The purposes of this study were to determine the role of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems in producing the heart rate (HR) response to dynamic exercise in rats and to determine the effect of attenuation of the HR response to exercise on blood flow redistribution. Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 10) were instrumented with arterial and venous catheters and Doppler flow probes. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), HR, mesenteric blood flow (MBF), and iliac blood flow (IBF) were determined during four exercise tests. On 4 consecutive days, rats were treated with saline (SAL, 1 mg/kg iv), atropine methyl nitrate (ATR, 2 mg/kg), timolol maleate (TIM, 0.5 mg/kg), and combined timolol and atropine. One minute of mild exercise (10 m/min) produced an increase in HR of 90 +/- 6 beats/min after SAL treatment, which was significantly less than the increment after ATR (56 +/- 5 beats/min) or TIM (4 +/- 3 beats/min). For the remainder of graded exercise, ATR treatment produced a modest attenuation in the increment in HR and no effect on MAP, IBF, and MBF. At 30 m/min, TIM markedly blunted the exercise-induced increment in HR (SAL, 138 +/- 8 beats/min; TIM, 53 +/- 4 beats/min) and IBF (SAL, 324 +/- 33%; TIM, 197 +/- 33%) with no effect on MAP or MBF. The results suggest that 1) the sympathetic nervous system is an important mediator of exercise-induced tachycardia in rats and 2) exercised-induced hyperemia, but not MAP, is attenuated by nonselective beta-blockade during exercise in rats.", 
    "103": "The influence of cardiac afferents on the muscle metaboreflex was examined in 16 rats instrumented with a Silastic-tipped catheter in the pericardial space and right atrium, Doppler ultrasonic flow probe and a pneumatic vascular occluder around the terminal aorta, and a Teflon catheter in the thoracic aorta. In protocol I (cardiac efferent and afferent blockade), the muscle metaboreflex was examined under three experimental conditions: 1) control, 2) cardiac autonomic efferent blockade [intrapericardial methylscopolamine (10 micrograms/kg) and propranolol (50 micrograms/kg)], and 3) combined cardiac autonomic efferent and afferent blockade (intrapericardial procainamide, 2%). In protocol II (blood volume expansion), the muscle metaboreflex was examined before and after 15% blood volume expansion. Mild treadmill exercise (9 m/min, 10% grade) increased heart rate (71 +/- 9.4 beats/min), mean arterial pressure (12 +/- 2.0 mmHg), and terminal aortic blood flow velocity (6 +/- 1.0 kHz). During exercise, a reduction of terminal aortic blood flow velocity (10.5 +/- 1.1%) reduced mixed venous PO2 18 +/- 6%. The gain of the muscle metaboreflex in the control condition was 14.6 +/- 2.9 mmHg/kHz. Efferent blockade reduced the gain 51 +/- 7%. However, combined cardiac efferent and afferent blockade increased the gain 207 +/- 64% above the efferent blocked condition and restored the gain to levels above those obtained in the control condition (18.3 +/- 4.6 mmHg/kHz). In addition, 15% blood volume expansion reduced the gain of the muscle metaboreflex regulation of mean arterial pressure and heart rate (44 +/- 9.5% and 41 +/- 12.0%, respectively). Thus cardiac afferents tonically inhibit the pressor response to a reduction in terminal aortic blood flow velocity during exercise.", 
    "104": "Variceal recurrence and rebleeding are common after initial obliteration by injection sclerotherapy. To investigate whether propranolol can maintain variceal obliteration by sclerotherapy, 59 patients with oesophageal variceal bleeding after sclerotherapy were enrolled. Patients were allocated to propranolol treatment (30 patients) or served as controls (29 patients). After a mean follow up of 2 years and 4 months, 53 patients completed the study. Fifty-eight per cent of the propranolol group versus 77% of the control group experienced recurrent varices (P = 0.20). Fifteen per cent of the propranolol group versus 11% of the control group developed cardiac varices. Recurrent variceal bleeding was encountered in 27% of the propranolol group and 19% of the control group. Three patients in the propranolol group, compared with two patients in the control group, died of massive variceal bleeding. Eighty per cent of them bled from cardiac varices. Both groups had similar survival rates. We therefore concluded that the use of propranolol after variceal obliteration by sclerotherapy can neither prevent oesophagogastric variceal recurrence nor prevent further rebleeding.", 
    "105": "The objective of this study was to assess, under steady-state conditions, the stereoselective disposition of (+/-)-sotalol in man. In all patients studied (n = 7) values of oral clearance (137 +/- 51 ml min-1), renal clearance (96 +/- 42 ml min-1) and nonrenal clearance (41 +/- 25 ml min-1) of (-)-sotalol were greater than those for (+)-sotalol (123 +/- 45 ml min-1, 89 +/- 39 ml min-1 and 34 +/- 23 ml min-1, respectively; P < 0.05, Student's paired t-test). Binding to plasma proteins was greater for (+)-sotalol (38 +/- 9% vs 35 +/- 9% for the (-)-enantiomer; P < 0.05) such that unbound oral clearance (+)/(-) ratio (0.95 +/- 0.06) and unbound renal clearance (+)/(-) ratio (0.97 +/- 0.06) were not stereoselective. In contrast, estimated unbound nonrenal clearance, which represents approximately 25% of the total unbound clearance of the drug, was greater for the (-)-enantiomer (64 +/- 42 ml min-1) compared with (+)-sotalol (57 +/- 42 ml min-1; P < 0.05). The difference in the pharmacokinetics of sotalol enantiomers is mainly related to stereoselectivity in plasma protein binding.", 
    "106": "This randomized, double-blind, parallel study compared the anti-anginal effects of nicorandil and atenolol in 37 patients with exercise-induced angina pectoris. At the end of a single-blind placebo period, patients were randomized and received either atenolol 50 mg o.d. or nicorandil 10 mg b.d. for 3 weeks. On the third week, the dosage was increased (nicorandil 20 mg b.d. or atenolol 100 mg o.d.) for the final 3-week period. Treadmill exercise tolerance tests were performed immediately before and 2 h after dosing at the end of the placebo period, and at the end of the third and sixth week of active treatment. Demographic characteristics and exercise performance with placebo were comparable between both treatment groups, and at the end of the treatment periods a significant improvement in exercise time was observed: an increase in the time to peak exercise of 1.33 +/- 0.29 min (mean +/- standard error of the mean) in atenolol-treated patients (P < 0.001), and of 1.47 +/- 0.40 min (P < 0.005) in nicorandil-treated patients. While the anti-anginal activity of the two drugs was comparable, their effects on the rate-pressure product heart rate x systolic blood pressure were clearly different; atenolol induced a decrease at peak exercise, but this parameter was not changed or was slightly increased with nicorandil. One patient with severe three-vessel disease died suddenly after 3 days of treatment with nicorandil 10 mg twice daily. The most frequent adverse effect in both groups was headache, which led to discontinuation of one patient in the atenolol group and of five patients in the nicorandil group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "107": "The first-pass hepatic metabolism of a number of important therapeutic agents is inconsistent with traditional models that assume that the hepatic extraction ratio of a drug is constant in each individual (independent of the concentration of drug in the hepatic sinusoidal blood and also independent of the history of exposure to the drug). In this review, the authors examine the first-pass metabolism of five \"problematic drugs\" (propranolol, lidocaine, propafenone, verapamil, and nitroglycerin). Each of these compounds has unique facets to its hepatic clearance and pharmacokinetics as well as striking similarities. Selected aspects of first-pass metabolism are reviewed, and a theory that may explain some of the unusual behavior of the four lipophilic bases (propranolol, lidocaine, propafenone, and verapamil) is presented. Finally, the unusual and variable clearance of nitroglycerin is discussed."
