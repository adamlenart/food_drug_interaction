    "0": "Oral administration of felodipine to 10 patients with mild essential hypertension acutely reduced systemic vascular resistance (SVR) by 40% after 30 min. The change in SVR was significantly related to age (r = -0.74). The reduction in the intraarterially measured brachial artery pressure was limited to 15/13 mmHg, due to a rise in cardiac output (CO). The tachycardia was sustained for 90 min, as was an elevation of plasma noradrenaline. There was a transient increase in stroke volume, associated with a reduction in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, which was at least partly due to a reduced intravascular volume. In contrast to SVR, pulmonary vascular resistance was not affected by felodipine. Addition of intravascular metoprolol after 90 min decreased HR and CO and augmented SVR. The felodipine-induced rise in plasma renin activity (PRA) of 100% was completely reversed by metoprolol. Plasma angiotensin II (PA II) rose by 15% during felodipine, whereas plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) was not affected. Thus, acutely administered felodipine was a potent dilator of systemic but not of pulmonary arterioles, it stimulated the sympathetic nervous system, and reduced left ventricular filling pressure. The rise in plasma renin did not result in a higher plasma aldosterone level, due partly to reduced generation of angiotensin II.", 
    "1": "Six normal young and six normal elderly volunteers and six elderly hypertensive patients took part in an acute and chronic dose study of a combination capsule containing atenolol (50 mg), hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg) and amiloride (2.5 mg) designed for the treatment of hypertension. No difference in any of the drug pharmacokinetic parameters could be detected between the hypertensives and the normal elderly subjects. The bio-availability and the 24-h blood concentrations of all three drugs, half-life of atenolol and amiloride and the peak concentration of hydrochlorothiazide was significantly greater in the elderly. The 24-h blood concentrations of atenolol and hydrochlorothiazide did not alter with chronic dosing, but amiloride concentrations were significantly higher at this time in all groups. A significant fall in the blood pressure was observed in the hypertensive group. Heart rate fell more in the normal and hypertensive elderly subjects than in the young. The combination has shown to be an effective and well tolerated antihypertensive in the elderly patient with a 24-h duration of action.", 
    "2": "We describe for the first time a non-human primate model of mineralocorticoid-salt hypertension. Baboons instrumented for chronic, direct measurement of arterial pressure, underwent sodium chloride loading (8.6 or 17.1 mEq/kg/day) by different routes for several weeks and deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) 5 mg/2 days i.m., in addition to sodium chloride, for periods lasting up to several months. Salt loading alone at 8.6 mEq/kg/day had no chronic effect on mean arterial pressure (MAP). Salt loading at both doses in combination with DOCA produced increases in MAP within a few days which became progressively larger over weeks to months. DOCA-salt hypertension was associated with hyporeninemia and mild hypokalemia, without consistent changes in heart rate or plasma catecholamines. A biofeedback procedure applied to three animals failed to reduce tonic blood pressure. In two of these animals, administration of clonidine or atenolol also had no antihypertensive effect, whereas a diuretic combination (hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene) rapidly abolished the hypertension. The absence of amelioration of the hypertension by a central sympatholytic agent or a beta-adrenoceptor blocker, coupled with the absence of increased plasma catecholamines, suggests that increased sympathetic activity may not contribute to the hypertension in contrast with findings in lower animals but consistent with clinical reports.", 
    "3": "59Fe was incorporated in vivo into intestinal sacs prepared in control rats as well as in animals with turpentine sterile abscesses and 59Fe counts were detected in the intestinal wall, in blood, in liver, in spleen and in femur of animals, at different time intervals (20, 40 and 120 min) following i.v. injection of isoproterenol (10 micrograms/kg, body weight) or of (-)-propranolol (2 mg/kg, body weight). In rats without inflammation isoproterenol alone enhanced significantly iron counts in blood, spleen, liver and femur, but not in intestinal cells, whereas propranolol evoked opposite actions, the influence being more marked after 40 min, reaching maximal values at 120 min. In animals with sterile turpentine abscesses explored 40 min after injections, iron intestinal counts in turpentine, in turpentine plus isoproterenol and in turpentine plus propranolol groups were significantly lower than in normal saline injected controls (p less than 0.001) and the opposite was the case at 120 min. In blood, iron counts at 20 and 40 min were higher in saline controls (p less than 0.05) than in the turpentine group, whereas at 120 min, values in the turpentine plus isoproterenol group were higher than (p less than 0.01) in saline injected controls or in the group with turpentine alone. Also, at all time intervals explored, iron counts in blood in the propranolol plus turpentine group were smaller (p less than 0.01) than in saline injected controls or in the group with turpentine alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "4": "In a randomized double-blind study the effect of locally applied pindolol 1% and timolol 0.5% on ocular hemodynamics was tested in 19 subjects. The method used was videoangiography, which permits a quantitative analysis of the arterial, capillary and venous phases of retinal circulation. In addition to videoangiography, the Blue Field Entoptoscope was used for a simultaneous quantitative study of retinal microcirculation. The investigation showed a statistically significant negative effect of both beta-blockers on nearly all retinal circulation times as well as on microcirculation in the macular area. It could not be shown that ISA (intrinsic sympathomimetic activity) prevents the negative effect of the beta-blockers on retinal hemodynamics.",

Sixty-eight eyes were treated with acetazolamide, timolol, and pilocarpine. The remaining 26 eyes were treated with acetazolamide and timolol only. The therapy without pilocarpine proved to be significantly more effective.", 
    "6": "We prepared an experimental system to study the effects of drugs on urinary bladder contraction and micturition simultaneously in rats anesthetized with urethane (1 g/kg, s.c.) and alpha-chloralose (25 mg/kg, s.c.). When Tyrode's solution was infused at a constant rate (0.8-1 ml/10 min) through a needle inserted into the bladder from the left ureter, the bladder pressure gradually and then steeply rose, and micturition took place. These changes in bladder pressure and micturition were constantly repeated. In this model, drugs which partially inhibited the bladder contractile force, e.g., atropine (0.01-1 mg/kg, i.v.) and hexamethonium (C6, 5 mg/kg, i.v.) increased the frequency of bladder contraction instead of decreasing the amount of solution excreted from the penis by bladder contraction. The rate of afferent discharges during bladder filling was increased after injection of atropine or C6, and this increase was considered to be responsible for the induction of the increase in the frequency of bladder contraction. Drugs which inhibited the bladder contraction and interrupted micturition, e.g., C6 (20 mg/kg, i.v.) raised the bladder pressure until the solution leaked from the penis. As phentolamine (5 mg/kg, i.v.) or propranolol (1 mg/kg, i.v.) did not facilitate bladder motility but rather inhibited it, the inhibitory action of sympathetic nerves on bladder motility was considered to be weak in rats. This model was useful for studying the effect of drugs on bladder motility and micturition reflex.", 
    "7": "The effects of d,l propranolol on stereotyped behavior induced by apomorphine administration was studied quantitatively. d,l Propranolol caused a 2.5 leftward displacement of the control dose-response curve constructed to apomorphine-induced stereotypy; the ED50 for apomorphine was reduced from 1.87 +/- 0.38 to 0.74 +/- 0.17. The potentiation was dependent on both d,l-propranolol and apomorphine doses. Results are discussed in the light of a possible interference of the central noradrenergic systems with the expression of dopaminergic-induced stereotyped behavior.", 
    "8": "In anesthetized cats, potentials of longitudinal muscles of the middle small intestine and impulses of afferent fibers of mesenteric nerves were recorded. Effects of 1-M sucrose solution prior to and after i.v. administration of the MAO blockers and obsidan (beta-adrenoceptor blocker) were compared. After simultaneous blockade of the MAO and the beta-adrenoreceptors, the duration of excitatory effect on smooth muscles induced by intraluminal sucrose administration increased. The pulse rate of mesenteric nerves, with a declining initial background observed as a result of the MAO and the beta-adrenoreceptor blockers action, increased within 25 min after sucrose administration. A hypothesis of the involvement of serotonin of the small intestine mucose entero-chromaffin cells in the primary perception of sugars, is suggested.", 
    "9": "We studied the functional effects of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and the structurally related peptide histidine isoleucine (PHI) in segments of bovine and human intrapulmonary artery. In both species, VIP caused nearly complete relaxation of precontracted vessel segments. The EC50 was 1.3 +/- 0.3 X 10(-9) M (mean +/- SD) in bovine and 3.4 +/- 0.4 X 10(-9) M in human pulmonary artery. The response to VIP was not endothelium-dependent and it was not affected by either adrenergic and cholinergic blockade or by cyclooxygenase inhibition. PHI also relaxed human and bovine vessels but this related peptide was significantly less effective than VIP. We conclude that VIP is a potent inhibitor of bovine and human pulmonary artery, which appears to act directly on vascular smooth muscle. These data support the concept that VIP may be a neurotransmitter which modulates pulmonary artery tone in both man and cow.",

    "11": "Infusion of adrenaline into healthy male subjects reduced the plasma concentrations of both potassium and phosphate to a similar extent, in a dose-dependent manner, an effect which was prevented by the administration of propranolol. Ergometer bicycling until exhaustion, which caused marked accumulation of lactic acid in the blood and reduction of pH, induced great elevations of both plasma potassium and phosphate with close relationships between the raised plasma concentrations and the reduction in pH, also during beta-blockade. However, longer-term aerobic exercise, without acidosis, also caused some rise of the potassium and phosphate concentrations. During recovery from anaerobic, but not from aerobic, exercise there was a rapid decrease of the plasma potassium levels while the phosphate values normalized gradually together with pH. From measurements of the ion concentrations both in the femoral effluent of one leg, which carried out maximal isokinetic work, and in the opposite antecubital vein it could be calculated that there was for potassium, but not for phosphate, a post-exercise uptake both in the exercised muscle and in the entire organism, indicating the participation of systemic factors.", 
    "12": "Haem arginate is a new haem compound recently introduced for treatment of porphyrias. Previously haematin has been reported to increase certain hydroxylase activities in extrahepatic tissues, but even in therapeutic doses it impairs the microsomal foreign substance metabolism in the liver. Haem arginate at a dose equivalent to haem 10 mg/kg (threefold therapeutic dose) did not prolong the hexobarbital sleeping time of mice, 20 mg/kg did prolong the hexobarbital and possibly also the ethanol sleeping time. Haem arginate administered in high doses prior to oral propranolol did not alter the bioavailability of the latter. With regard to drug interactions haem arginate may be safer than haematin.", 
    "13": "Data on the efficiency of stepwise long-term preventive medication with antihypertensive agents are presented. The stepwise regimen of antihypertensive medication produced at least a short-term hypotensive effect (more than month) in 93.5% of patients within 1 year, with complete arterial BP normalization in 67.7% and partial effect in another 25.8%. Stable effect (more than 6 months) was however achieved in 1/5 of patients only. Side effects associated with this regimen were seen in 19.4% of patients. Since the effect persisted for more than 2 months in 52.6% of patients only, and was only stable (over 6 months) in one-fifth, follow-up examination of patients with arterial hypertension should be made at least once a month to allow assessment of the efficiency and safety of medication.", 
    "14": "The glomerular filtration rate (GFR, inulin clearance) and renal plasma flow (RPF, PAH clearance) were measured in 35 hypertensive patients during chronic administration of an alpha-beta-blocker, labetalol. No significant changes in GFR occurred but RPF increased significantly. The increase in RPF was positively correlated with the decrease in mean arterial blood pressure. Patients with renal failure showed changes similar to patients with normal renal function. Thus chronic treatment with labetalol, unlike most beta-blockers, can increase RPF, an effect which could be related to the alpha-blocking activity of the drug.",

    "16": "We have treated eleven patients with chronic stable angina pectoris with slow-release oxprenolol (160 mg and 320 mg) in a double-blind crossover study and evaluated its efficacy objectively by exercise testing between 180 and 240 min after dosing. The mean exercise time increased significantly from 6.2 min on placebo to 7.2 min and 7.3 min on oxprenolol 160 mg and 320 mg respectively. No overall beneficial effects could be demonstrated for the higher dose. A further 20 patients received slow release oxprenolol 160 mg and 10/170 mg \"Oros\" (osmotic release) oxprenolol in a double-blind crossover study using exercise testing and ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring at 21-23 h after dosing. The mean exercise time increased significantly from 7.0 min on placebo to 8.3 min on slow-release oxprenolol and to 8.1 min on \"Oros\" oxprenolol. The effects of the 2 treatments on exercise and ambulatory heart rates were comparable. Two patients were withdrawn during the double-blind treatment period while receiving oxprenolol slow-release, one because of unstable angina and another because of throbbing headache. These findings confirm that slow-release oxprenolol is effective in treating chronic stable angina pectoris at the 160-mg dose. \"Oros\" oxprenolol 10/170 mg has a profile of action closely similar to but without any additional benefit over slow-release oxprenolol 160 mg.", 
    "17": "GRP is a pancreatic neuropeptide and may be of importance for the neural control of insulin and glucagon secretion. In this study, we investigated the effects of GRP on basal and stimulated insulin and glucagon secretion in the mouse. Intravenous injections of GRP at dose levels exceeding 2.12 nmol/kg were found to rapidly increase basal plasma levels of both insulin and glucagon. Furthermore, at a low dose level without effect on basal plasma insulin levels, GRP was found to potentiate the insulin response to both glucose (by 40%; p less than 0.05) and to the cholinergic agonist carbachol (by 57%; p less than 0.01). Also, GRP was at this dose level found to potentiate the glucagon response to carbachol (p less than 0.01). Glucose abolished GRP-induced glucagon secretion. Moreover, methylatropine given at a dose level that totally abolishes carbachol-induced insulin secretion inhibited GRP-induced insulin secretion by 39% (p less than 0.05) and GRP-induced glucagon secretion by 25% (p less than 0.01). L-Propranolol at a dose level that totally abolishes beta-adrenergically-induced insulin secretion inhibited GRP-induced insulin secretion by 52% (p less than 0.01) and GRP-induced glucagon secretion by 15% (p less than 0.05). In summary, we have shown that GRP stimulates basal and potentiates stimulated insulin and glucagon secretion in mice, and that the stimulatory effects of GRP on insulin and glucagon secretion are partially inhibited by muscarinic blockade by methylatropine or by beta-adrenoceptor blockade by propranolol. We conclude that GRP activates potently both insulin and glucagon secretion in the mouse by mechanisms that are partially related to the muscarinic and the beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "18": "The antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of a fixed-dose combination containing 40 mg penbutolol (a beta-blocking agent) and 6 mg piretanide (a diuretic) in comparison to placebo was investigated in a double-blind, crossover study in 20 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. After a 1-week period on placebo, patients were allocated at random to receive 1 tablet daily for 4 weeks of either the combination preparation or placebo and were then crossed over to the alternative medication for a further 4 weeks. The reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure both at rest, during maximal ergometric exercise and isometric word load, and also in the diurnal blood pressure profile over 24 hours was significantly greater in the group treated with the fixed-dose combination than in the placebo group. Pulse rate was also decreased to a greater extent. Mean diastolic blood pressure before exercise was reduced to normal (85.5 mmHg) after 4-weeks' treatment with the fixed-dose combination. Biochemical, haematological and urinary parameters showed no clinically relevant changes after either treatment. One patient complained of transient dizziness during treatment with the fixed-dose combination. No patient withdrew prematurely from the study because of side-effects.", 
    "19": "The aim of this study was to assess, by a pragmatic controlled trial, the value of propranolol in the prevention of recurrent bleeding in patients with cirrhosis. From January 1982 to December 1984, 368 cirrhotic patients were admitted for bleeding episode due to portal hypertension. Ninety-nine patients were included in the trial 24 h after cessation of bleeding (5 days on the average after hospital admission) and were randomly assigned to 2 groups: 51 patients receiving propranolol at doses that reduced the resting heart rate by 25 p. 100 and 48 receiving neither treatment nor placebo. Ninety-one per cent presented a rupture of varices, and 9 p. 100 acute gastric erosions: 94 p. 100 had an alcoholic cirrhosis. The distribution according to Child Turcotte's classification was grade A: 45.5 p. 100, B: 45.5 p. 100, C: 100 p. 100. The two groups were not significantly different excepted for previous bleeding episodes. The cumulative percentages of recurrent bleeding were not significantly different: between the treated and untreated groups (60 p. 100 vs. 68 p. 100 at 18 months); between the compliant patients (n = 39) and untreated and not compliant patients altogether; between the treated and untreated patients of Child's grade A on the one hand, and patients grades B and C on the other hand. The curves of cumulative survival were not significantly different between treated and untreated patients (66 p. 100 vs. 78 p. 100 at 18 months).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "20": "We have evaluated the effect of propranolol on urinary prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) excretion after frusemide administration in 8 healthy subjects. Urine was collected for 60 min after frusemide administration (20 mg intravenously) with or without propranolol pretreatment, and urinary excretion of PGE2, frusemide, and sodium were determined. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was also measured before and 60 min after frusemide administration. Urinary PGE2 excretion after frusemide administration and frusemide-stimulated PRA were reduced after propranolol pretreatment. However, urine volume and the urinary excretion of frusemide and sodium were not influenced by propranolol pretreatment. These results suggest that urinary PGE2 excretion after frusemide administration may be reduced by propranolol and that the mechanism responsible for the effect of propranolol on the frusemide-induced renal PGE2 production may be, at least in part, secondary to inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "21": "The antihypertensive effect of atenolol 100 mg was compared to that of amiloride HCl 5 mg + hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg (AHCZ) in a double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study of 128 patients. Both drugs were given once daily. Atenolol produced a significant decline in lying, standing, and postexercise blood pressure and pulse rate values. The corresponding values on AHCZ were not significantly different from placebo. Both the beta-blocking agent and the thiazide diuretic with amiloride were relatively well tolerated. More than half of all adverse effects were nonspecific and also observed in patients on placebo. In the population studied, atenolol proved to be a superior antihypertensive agent to AHCZ.", 
    "22": "The recovery of the ECG signs of anterior myocardial infarction has been studied in 70 patients. A significant increase in R-wave amplitude and decrease in Q-wave amplitude on 24-lead precordial mapping was observed during one year after infarction. Patients with lower initial heart rate showed a greater recovery of R- and Q-wave amplitudes, as did patients with smaller infarcts, as assessed by peak heat-stable lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).", 
    "23": "Functional characteristics of isolated single human axillary apoeccrine sweat glands have been studied using in vitro sweat induction methods. Sustained copious clear fluid secretion was evoked by methacholine (MCh), epinephrine (EP), isoproterenol (ISO), and phenylephrine (PL) in decreasing order in a pharmacologically specific manner. Apoeccrine glands showed a higher cholinergic sensitivity than eccrine sweat glands, as shown by the apparent association constant for MCh of 2.7 X 10(-7) M compared with 2.1 X 10(-6) M for the axillary eccrine sweat gland. The average total sweat rate of the apoeccrine gland for a 30-min period was sevenfold higher than that of the eccrine sweat gland. In contrast, isolated apocrine glands showed intermittent pulsatile turbid sweat secretion in response to MCh or EP. The Na+ and K+ concentration of apoeccrine glands was nearly isotonic, whereas those of apocrine sweat was 120-140 mM for Na+ and 10-20 mM for K+. Apoeccrine ductal Na+ absorption was also observed in the apoeccrine glands and was no more efficient than that of the axillary eccrine sweat gland. Thus apoeccrine sweat glands are functionally and pharmacologically distinct from axillary apocrine glands and significantly contribute to overall axillary sweating in humans.", 
    "24": "The effect of acute and chronic beta- and alpha-adrenergic blockade on potassium homeostasis during moderate intensity exercise (40% VO2max) was investigated in control and insulin-dependent diabetic subjects. In protocol I, subjects were studied during exercise alone, exercise plus intravenous propranolol, and exercise plus intravenous phentolamine. In both the control and diabetic groups, exercise alone produced a modest increase in the plasma potassium concentration (0.31 +/- 0.06 meq/l), while propranolol exacerbated this hyperkalemic response. In contrast, the increment in plasma potassium during phentolamine was similar to exercise alone in normals but was 26% (P less than 0.05) lower in the diabetic group. In protocol II, the effect of chronic (5 days) beta-adrenergic blockade on potassium homeostasis was examined. Subjects participated in three studies: exercise alone, exercise plus propranolol (beta 1/beta 2-antagonist), and exercise plus metoprolol (beta 1 antagonist). In the nondiabetic group, both propranolol and metoprolol were associated with a 40% greater increase in potassium compared with exercise alone. In the diabetic group, propranolol, but not metoprolol, was associated with a deterioration in potassium tolerance. In no study could the alterations in potassium homeostasis be explained by a change in urinary potassium excretion. In summary, alpha-adrenergic blockade ameliorates exercise-induced hyperkalemia in diabetic but not in control subjects, nonspecific beta-adrenergic blockade causes a greater increment in potassium when compared with exercise alone, and specific beta 1-adrenergic blockade exacerbates exercise-induced hyperkalemia in control, but not in diabetic subjects. These results indicate that both alpha- and beta-adrenergic regulation of extrarenal potassium metabolism is altered in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.", 
    "25": "Twenty hyperthyroid patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to receive either nadolol 80 mg/day or placebo for 2 weeks; all patients then took carbimazole as well from 2-6 weeks. Twenty-four hour Holter ECG recordings at 0, 2 and 6 weeks showed that nadolol reduced the mean maximum heart rate by 19.9% (P less than 0.0005) at 2 weeks and by 30.3% (P less than 0.0005) at 6 weeks compared to 5.2% (ns) and 18.3% (P less than 0.0005) in patients taking placebo. There was no alteration of the normal circadian variation of heart rate by nadolol. The minimum heart rate before therapy was significantly correlated with FT4 (r = 0.52) and with FT3 (r = 0.44). The percentage of time per hour during which the heart rate was greater than 100 was reduced by 79% at week 2 by nadolol compared to 22% in the placebo group. At the 6 week point the placebo group still had a tachycardia (mean maximum heart rate 101.6 beats/min +/- 15.2 SD) compared to the nadolol group (80.4 +/- 7.7). Nadolol did not cause excessive bradycardia. It is effective in the early management of hyperthyroidism and should be given for at least the first 4-6 weeks.", 
    "26": "In the Beta Blocker Heart Attack Trial, a double blind, randomized, controlled study, patients taking propranolol (180 or 240 mg/day) initiated 5-21 days post myocardial infarction had 26% fewer deaths than those taking placebo over a 25 month (mean) followup. Detailed analysis of the circumstances surrounding the BHAT deaths failed to reveal any striking difference between propranolol and placebo in the type of clinical event preceding death, the incidence and type of acute and prodromal signs and symptoms, the location of death, the activity preceding death or the percentage of deaths that were sudden or instantaneous, suggesting that propranolol may exert an \"across the board\" effect and improve survival by a combination of mechanisms. An unexpected finding was that the protective effect of propranolol appeared to occur during the hours of 10 p.m. to 7 a.m.", 
    "27": "Body temperature was studied in 65 patients admitted to hospital within four hours of the onset of symptoms of acute myocardial infarction. Thirty three patients had been randomly assigned to intravenous timolol treatment and 32 to placebo treatment. Infarct evolution was assessed by continuous vectorcardiography and creatine kinase release. Maximum and mean temperatures during the first eight days were significantly lower in the timolol group, who were discharged from hospital one day earlier. Eight patients in the placebo group had temperatures of greater than 39 degrees compared with one in the timolol group. Both the mean temperature and the maximum temperature correlated significantly with indices of infarct size and ischaemic area as estimated by cumulative creatine kinase release, QRS vector difference, and ST vector magnitude. The results were consistent with the view that reduction of infarct size may partly explain the reduced pyrexial response after timolol treatment. Other mechanisms are probably also involved in larger infarcts. Because high fever has detrimental haemodynamic effects in acute myocardial infarction, reduction of this response may be beneficial. The results support the early use of beta adrenoceptor blockade in acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "28": "The sedative effects of a relatively lipid-soluble and a water-soluble beta-blocker were compared in 20 male hypertensives, 30 to 60 years old. In a blinded, randomized, crossover study, critical flash fusion frequency and computerized Stroop Word Test were used to assess psychomotor function parameters during a drug-free control day and then following 14 days of either metoprolol, 150 mg daily, or atenolol, 100 mg daily, treatment. Both drugs caused subtle but significant reductions in both parameters of sedation (critical flash fusion frequency and computerized Stroop Word Testing). Sedation was significantly related to serum concentrations of both drugs. The maximum drug-induced change was 17.2% +/- 9% for metoprolol and 19.6% +/- 3% for atenolol. The duration of effect was six hours after atenolol and two hours after metoprolol. Blood pressure control for all patients was similar during both treatment phases. These results demonstrate that relative lipid solubility does not reliably predict the neurologic effects of beta-blockers. The intensity of drug-induced sedation was similar, but the water-soluble agent produced a longer duration of sedative activity.", 
    "29": "Left ventricular performance was evaluated noninvasively in 111 patients participating at one study center in the Norwegian Multicenter Study on Timolol After Myocardial Infarction. Systolic time intervals were measured in 55 patients treated with timolol and in 56 patients receiving placebo. Measurements were made before randomization, and after 1, 3 and 12 months of treatment. During the treatment period, the pre-ejection period/left ventricular ejection time ratio was significantly lower in the timolol-treated group, indicating better left ventricular function than in the placebo-treated patients. In the 27 patients who died during the follow-up period of 50 to 72 months, there was a significant increase in the pre-ejection period/left ventricular ejection time ratio from baseline to the last performed recording, indicating a deterioration in left ventricular performance in these patients. No such change occurred in the group that survived the entire follow-up period. Deterioration of left ventricular function is related to a high long-term mortality rate after myocardial infarction, and left ventricular function is better preserved in patients treated with timolol than in patients receiving placebo.", 
    "30": "To determine left ventricular function during the stress of exercise and to evaluate the effects of propranolol on it in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the ECG-multigated blood pool cardiac scintigraphy was performed in 12 without (HNCM) and 10 with (HOCM) left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest and during bicycle ergometer loading. The results were compared to those in 13 normal subjects. 1. Control measurements: Resting and exercise heart rates and blood pressures did not significantly differ between patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and normal subjects. Ejection fraction (EF) was normal or higher in HCM than in normal subjects at rest, but during exercise it failed to increase normally. The increment in cardiac output was half of the normal value. Responses of count-derived end-diastolic volume (EDV) and stroke volume (SV) were different between HOCM and HNCM. They were unchanged during exercise in HNCM and declined in HOCM. End-systolic volume (ESV) was unchanged in HNCM and slightly decreased in HOCM. Responses of the peak ejection rate (PER) and time to the peak ejection rate (TPE) were not significantly different from normal subjects. Left ventricular (LV) ejection time (ET) and TPE/ET were not different from normal subjects. The peak filling rate (PFR) was significantly higher than normal in HOCM at rest and during exercise. The time to peak filling rate was prolonged at rest in HOCM, but not during exercise. 2. Effects of propranolol: Heart rates significantly decreased especially after intravenous propranolol administration. Cardiac output (CO) and SV were unchanged. EDV and ESV increased significantly. The PER was unchanged. The PFR decreased, but not significantly. TPE, time to the PFR (TPF) and ET were prolonged. The ratio of TPE/ET decreased initially, but abruptly increased later. In conclusion, in the control state of HCM patients, the responses of LVEF, EDV and ESV to exercise were abnormal and CO remained half of the normal. There was no difference between patients with and without obstruction. The effect of propranolol on left ventricular function was more obvious in patients with obstruction than without obstruction, especially in ESV, EDV, PFR and TPF. Propranolol did not improve LV systolic and diastolic functions, but the double product decreased depending on the decrease of heart rate maintaining CO by Frank-Starling mechanism due to increased EDV, which may play a part in improving subjective complaints.", 
    "31": "Twenty patients with tongue tremor associated with essential tremor are reported. Patients were unaware of the tongue tremor, and voice disturbance was a complaint in only one patient. Three patients had an isolated tongue tremor. Hand tremor was present in 16 patients. Dystonia, myoclonus, and tremor of other body parts were present in some patients. Three patients had a mild-to-moderate dysarthria. The frequency of tongue tremor (4-8 Hz) was identical to hand tremor. The intravenous infusion of ethanol suppressed tongue tremor. Therapy with propranolol, primidone, or clonazepam also reduced tongue tremor amplitude. Tongue tremor is a common finding in some essential tremor patients but often there are no symptoms.", 
    "32": "SCH 33861 is a novel, non-sulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Topical administration of the compound to the eye of conscious rabbits was employed to examine actions on intraocular pressure (IOP). Falls in IOP resulted from SCH 33861 (0.001-0.01%) administration. Ocular hypotensive responses were sustained for as long as 24 hrs following a single application of 0.001% SCH 33861. The RSS isomer of SCH 33861, which is 200-fold weaker an ACE inhibitor than SCH 33861, caused only transient falls in IOP at 0.1% concentration. The magnitude of the fall in IOP induced by 0.001% SCH 33861 (4.8 +/- 0.5 mmHg) was comparable to that produced by 0.5% timolol (4.5 +/- 0.3 mmHg). Other ACE inhibitors such as captopril (0.1%) and enalaprilic acid (0.01%) also reduced IOP by 4.0 +/- 0.4 and 4.7 +/- 0.4 mmHg, respectively. These findings indicate that SCH 33861 is 500-fold more potent on a weight basis than is timolol in lowering IOP. No loss of ocular hypotensive activity was observed when SCH 33861 was administered twice daily for 5 days suggesting little, if any, potential for tolerance development. SCH 33861, as well as the other ACE inhibitors, caused neither ocular irritation nor alteration of pupil diameter. These findings suggest that inhibition of ocular ACE may represent an effective means of reducing IOP.", 
    "33": "Argon laser iridotomy was performed in 123 eyes of 83 patients with primary angle-closure glaucoma. Sixty-three eyes received argon laser iridotomies with timolol pretreatment and the other 60 eyes served as controls. There were 43 eyes (71.7%) in the control group and 32 eyes (50.7%) in the timolol-pretreated group, whose intraocular pressure increased significantly over baseline level 2 hours after laser treatment. There was statistical difference in the incidence of intraocular pressure elevation in these two groups. Seven eyes (11.7%) in the control group and 4 eyes (6.2%) in the timolol-pretreated group had intraocular pressure elevation at least 11 mmHg over baseline. Additional 28 patients, who received argon laser iridotomy bilaterally, one eye with timolol pretreatment and the other eye served as a matched control, revealed that eyes which were timolol pretreated had statistically significant less intraocular pressure elevation.", 
    "34": "Topically applied ophthalmic drugs can occasionally produce adverse systemic effects due to systemic absorption of the drug or impediment of the drug's metabolism. Increasing evidence points to significant adverse systemic effects from topical ocular administration of timolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent marketed for the treatment of glaucoma. Various methods to decrease or avoid unwanted systemic effects from eyedrops are discussed, including avoidance of overdosage and how to apply eye medications.", 
    "35": "The primary purpose of this study was to determine the relative contribution of the nasal and the conjunctival mucosae to the systemic absorption of topically applied timolol in the pigmented rabbit. The nasal mucosa was found to be about 2.5 times more efficient than the conjunctival mucosa in contributing to systemic timolol absorption, which occurred to the extent of 74% of the instilled dose. In addition, a minimum of 5-10 min prolongation of ocular contact time was determined to be necessary for significantly reducing systemic drug absorption and indirectly enhancing ocular drug absorption. The pharmaceutical implication of this finding is that ophthalmic vehicles such as polymeric inserts and gels would provide more favorable ocular to systemic drug absorption ratios than vehicles such as aqueous solutions and low-viscosity polymer solutions.", 
    "36": "Submaximal exercise heart rate was measured after oral administration of placebo, tertatolol 5 mg, propranolol 80 mg, and atenolol 100 mg to 12 subjects in a double-blind cross-over study. The peaks of beta-blocking activity, observed at 2 hr, were of similar extent for the 3 drugs. The duration of activity of tertatolol, a beta blocker with a short elimination half-life, extended up to 24 hr as did that of atenolol, but was longer than that of propranolol which reached only 18 hr. These results support once-daily administration of tertatolol in therapy.", 
    "37": "Intraperitoneal (i.p.) and intravenous (i.v.) injection of human recombinant interleukin-1 beta (rIL-1 beta) in mice produced a 2-4 fold induction of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) in liver and heart six hours after administration. Lymphoid organs (thymus and spleen) and brain did not respond to rIL-1 beta administration with significant increases in ODC. IL-1-induced responses in heart seemed not to be secondary to stress induced catecholamine release since the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol did not inhibit the induction of ODC produced by injection rIL-1 beta. Injection of 10 micrograms bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an inducer of IL-1 synthesis, exhibited a pattern of tissue responsiveness which was distinct from the responses elicited by rIL-1 beta, most notably a marked 5-fold induction of ODC in spleen. The differences in the responses of various organs to rIL-1 beta vs. LPS suggested that the in vivo effects of LPS may involve more than stimulation of the release of IL-1. The identification of heart as an IL-1 sensitive tissue merits further study to define the contribution of IL-1 to cardiac physiology and pathophysiology.", 
    "38": "To investigate the variability and the mechanism of negative T waves in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), especially giant negative T waves in apical hypertrophy, from view point of adrenergic function, ECG was studied by treadmill exercise test and under administrations of beta-adrenergic agonist (isoproterenol) and antagonist (propranolol) in 33 patients with HCM and negative T waves. Apical hypertrophy was seen in 16 cases, and giant negative T waves were seen in 24 cases. By treadmill exercise test, negative T waves became less deep in all cases of HCM (-1.2 +/- 0.5 mV-----0.6 +/- 0.5 mV, p less than 0.001). The higher exercise level the patients attained, the less deep the negative T waves became. Isoproterenol caused the same reversal of negative T waves as the exercise test, but heart rate and rate pressure product attained by isoproterenol were significantly smaller than those by exercise. R wave amplitude did not change with isoproterenol. Propranolol made negative T waves deeper at rest and inhibited the reversal of negative T waves caused by exercise. In conclusion, negative T wave in HCM, especially giant negative T wave in apical hypertrophy, is variable. Beta-adrenergic function may be at least one of its mechanisms.", 
    "39": "The effects of the amphiphilic cationic drugs chlorpromazine, imipramine, amitriptyline, propranolol and fluoxetine and praziquantel were investigated on glucose uptake and lactate excretion of Schistosoma mansoni. While praziquantel enhances glucose uptake and lactate excretion at a concentration of 10(-7) M, all the other drugs exert the same effects at concentrations above 10(-5) M. Generally, a constant molar ratio of 1:2 is found between glucose uptake and lactate excretion. Above 10(-5) M, praziquantel inhibits glucose uptake and lactate excretion. Similar effects are caused by amphiphilic cationic drugs at 10(-3) M. Pre-incubation of S. mansoni with 10(-5) M praziquantel completely abolish the stimulation of carbohydrate metabolism by serotonin and by 5 X 10(-5) M chlorpromazine or fluoxetine. The action of praziquantel on S. mansoni resembles that of amphiphilic cationic drugs with respect to their influence on carbohydrate metabolism. This, together with data obtained from electrophysiological and electron microscopic studies, provides evidence for the hypothesis that praziquantel exerts its effect by interacting with membrane structures.", 
    "40": "We have evaluated the role of calcium in basal and secretagogue-stimulated release of beta-endorphin and PRL and the levels of their respective mRNAs in primary cultured rat anterior pituitary cells. Treatment of anterior pituitary cells with the calcium channel blocker methoxyverapamil (D600; 10 microM) or with calcium-free medium for 1 h did not alter the basal release of beta-endorphin and only partially blocked CRF (10 nM)-stimulated beta-endorphin release. In contrast to these effects of D600 or calcium-free medium on corticotrophs, both of these test conditions decreased basal secretion of PRL from lactotrophs by 50-70% and completely blocked forskolin (10 microM)-stimulated PRL secretion. Although omission of calcium from the culture medium caused a 50% decrease in basal levels of both proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and PRL mRNA, treatment of cells with D600 did not significantly alter the basal levels of POMC or PRL mRNA. Treatment of cells with D600 partially blocked CRF-stimulated elevation of POMC mRNA and forskolin-stimulated elevation of PRL mRNA. The calcium agonist barium (1 mM) produced a 2-fold increase in both beta-endorphin and PRL release, which was blocked by D600. Treatment of cells with barium had no effect on POMC mRNA levels, but increased PRL mRNA levels. D600 treatment of cells partially blocked barium-stimulated PRL mRNA levels. These findings demonstrate a calcium-dependent as well as a calcium-independent component of CRF-stimulated beta-endorphin secretion and CRF-stimulated POMC mRNA elevation. In contrast, PRL secretion and biosynthesis appear to be totally calcium-dependent processes.",

    "42": "The effects of nadolol on renal haemodynamics and function, and on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and on renal prostaglandin production were studied in eighteen cirrhotics. After 1 month of treatment, nadolol had significantly decreased cardiac output by 25% without affecting arterial pressure, renal plasma flow or renal vascular resistance. Glomerular filtration rate, filtration fraction and the proportion of the cardiac output delivered to the kidneys were significantly increased. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was suppressed and urinary PGE2 excretion was slightly increased. The latter effects were not correlated with those on renal haemodynamics and function.", 
    "43": "The influence of a chronic blood pressure lowering on carotid body morphology and volume was studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Oral propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, was administered beginning 3 weeks after conception up to 18 weeks of the litters. At the end of the experiment the blood pressure was significantly lower in the treated animals. These rats exhibited fewer vascular alterations in their carotid bodies. The carotid body volumes and the relationship of glomic cells, the blood vessels including endothelial cells, and the connective tissue in the carotid bodies did not differ between treated and non-treated rats. It can be concluded that long-term blood pressure lowering by propranolol in SHR does not influence carotid body volume increase.", 
    "44": "Rats were exposed to hypoxia (10% O2) for 1 and 3 weeks with or without daily injections of DL-propranolol (0.66 mg/kg i.p.). The structure of the carotid bodies was analyzed by light microscopical morphometry. Hypoxia induced enlargement of the carotid body due to enhanced vascularity and hypertrophy of glomic and interstitial tissues. The contents of dopamine and norepinephrine multiplied. Propranolol abolished the vasodilatory effect of hypoxia within the first week but did not prevent the other structural changes and the rise in catecholamine content. The data suggest that 1) the vaso-dilation elicited by long-term hypoxia may be controlled by beta-adrenoceptors; 2) the structural and biochemical events occurring in rat carotid body during long-term hypoxia seem to be controlled by different mechanisms.", 
    "45": "Nine healthy volunteers were studied with echocardiography and systolic time intervals at rest and after 3 minutes' isometric exercise by hand grip. The recordings were repeated after intravenous administration of 1 mg digoxin before and after autonomic blockade induced with atropine and propranolol. During hand grip the heart rate rose from 61 +/- 3 (mean +/- SEM) to 73 +/- 5 bpm (p less than 0.05). Afterload, i.e. left ventricular systolic wall stress, increased by 21% from 260 +/- 19 x 10(3) dyn/cm2 (p less than 0.05). Preload, i.e. left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), fractional shortening and the ratio of the pre-ejection period to the left ventricular ejection time (PEP/LVET) did not change, indicating increased contractility. After digoxin heart rate rose during handgrip from 50 +/- 2 to 65 +/- 5 bpm, and wall stress increased by 19% from 274 +/- 21 x 10(3) dyn/cm2 (p less than 0.01 for both). Even though LVEDD rose from 44.8 +/- 1.4 to 46.6 +/- 1.3 mm (p less than 0.05), fractional shortening decreased from 33 +/- 2 to 30 +/- 2% (p less than 0.05) and PEP/LVET increased from 0.292 +/- 0.014 to 0.327 +/- 0.014 (p less than 0.01). This suggests that autonomic reflexes due to digoxin obscured the increase in inotropy during static exercise. Autonomic blockade raised heart rate under digoxin from 50 +/- 2 to 90 +/- 4 bpm and mean blood pressure from 87 +/- 2 to 99 +/- 3 mmHg (p less than 0.001 for both) without changes in loading conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "46": "The effects of bilateral glomectomy on arterial blood pressure and heart rate and the response to the pressor tests were studied in a women of 37. Arterial pressure and ECG were recorded by the continuous unrestricted Oxford method. Hypotension, increased blood pressure variability and tachycardia rapidly developed 2 days after surgery, indicating sympathetic hyperactivity and/or deactivation of vagal tone. Wide blood pressure fluctuations were present on standing and abnormal blood pressure responses to head up tilting and to the Valsalva maneuver were observed reflecting a less prompt and precise control of blood pressure. Treatment with propranolol reduced tachycardia and blood pressure variability. After 5 and 17 months of this therapy propranolol was withheld for 36 h. Tachycardia was still present and blood pressure fluctuations were recorded on assuming the upright posture. However, the heart rate and pressure response to the Valsalva maneuver were normal after 17 months, indicating an improvement of the reflex control of blood pressure.", 
    "47": "In a randomised double-blind cross-over study, 8 normal subjects received propranolol 80 mg twice daily with omeprazole 20 mg or identical placebo each morning. Propranolol kinetics were measured on day 8 of both treatment periods. Areas under the propranolol concentration/time curves were not significantly increased by omeprazole treatment: off treatment mean 787.6, on treatment 802.5 ng-1.ml.h. Maximum and minimum steady-state propranolol concentrations were similarily unaffected. Omeprazole also failed to increase the clinical effect of propranolol, as assessed by exercise tests on Day 8 of treatment. We conclude that omeprazole in the dose likely to be used for peptic ulcer has no significant effect on the kinetics or action of propranolol.", 
    "48": "Seven women were treated with metoprolol 50-100 mg twice daily for hypertension in pregnancy. The disposition of metoprolol and one of its metabolites alfa-OH-metoprolol was studied in venous plasma and amniotic fluid during labour, in mixed cord plasma and in capillary blood of the newborn. Peak concentrations of metoprolol and alfa-OH-metoprolol were reached 60 to 120 min after dosing in maternal plasma while the amniotic fluid levels of these compounds continued to increase from 60 to 180 min to the end of the study and were substantially higher than in the plasma after 4 to 5 h. It is postulated that a major fraction of metoprolol and alfa-OH-metoprolol reaches the amniotic fluid via the fetal urine and that the elimination from the amniotic fluid mainly proceeds via diffusion across fetal membranes and transfer across the fetal capillary bed. No measurable concentrations of metoprolol were found in two of the newborns 2 h after delivery. In the remaining four neonates the 2-h concentrations exceeded the corresponding cord plasma levels. In all neonates the alfa-OH-metoprolol levels in the capillary blood were higher 2 h after birth than in cord blood. In two newborns the metabolite levels continued to increase for 5 h and in one the highest blood concentrations of this metabolite was found 20 h after birth. Redistribution of metoprolol from tissue stores followed by metabolism might be the cause of these temporary elevations of the blood levels of metoprolol and alfa-OH-metoprolol.", 
    "49": "The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of cigarette smoking and gender on the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol. Eighteen volunteers with no evidence of clinical disease each randomly received the following doses of metoprolol tartrate: 100 mg orally, 200 mg orally and 20 mg as a constant-rate intravenous infusion over 20 min. The only significant difference between smokers (S) and nonsmokers (NS) was that S had a larger steady-state volume of distribution (3.3 vs 2.5 l/kg). There were no differences in half-life, systemic clearance or bioavailability (f). No differences were observed between males (M) and females (FM) for any of the kinetic parameters examined. Systemic bioavailability varied markedly between subjects (range: 15 to 92%). In fifteen of the eighteen subjects, f was higher after the 200-mg dose compared to the 100-mg dose. These results suggest that metoprolol may be subject to saturable presystemic elimination and extend the previous observations of Johnsson et al. [1] who showed that f increased from 31% to 46% when doses were increased from 20 to 100 mg. However, the difference in f as the dose is increased is unlikely to be clinically significant since the mean difference is smaller than the variation in f among subjects.", 
    "50": "We have carried out randomized 12-week multicentre study to compare the effects of prazosin and propranolol on blood pressure and serum lipids in 70 patients with essential hypertension after a 4 week minimum period of treatment with thiazide diuretics. After 12 weeks treatment with prazosin (n = 40, 1.5-12.0 mg per day) or propranolol (n = 30, 30-120 mg per day) with diuretics there was a significant blood pressure reduction from 165.1/97.9 mmHg to 151.2/90.6 mmHg and from 167/96.5 mmHg to 153/91.9 mmHg, respectively. In the 12th week a significant decrease was noted in triglyceride and in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL + VLDL-C), but no significant effects were seen in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients receiving prazosin. On the other hand, a significant decrease in lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) was seen in patients receiving propranolol. Twenty-six of 40 patients receiving prazosin were given an additional 12 weeks of treatment. Twenty-two of 30 patients initially treated with propranolol were switched from propranolol to prazosin after 13 weeks and given prazosin up to the 24th week. At 24 weeks, the blood pressure was 149/93.0 mmHg in the prazosin group and 155/89.2 mmHg in the group which switched from propranolol to prazosin. Triglyceride remained reduced in the prazosin group at the 24th week. In the group which switched from propranolol to prazosin, triglyceride decreased significantly over the next 12 weeks.", 
    "51": "In 2 separate double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover studies, the antihypertensive effect and felodipine plasma concentrations were studied after 2 different formulations of felodipine. Both trials studied patients who had previously responded unsatisfactorily to conventional triple therapy (beta-adrenergic blocker, diuretic and vasodilator). Felodipine or corresponding placebo was added to the pre-existing beta-adrenergic blocker/diuretic combination. Both tablet formulations significantly lowered blood pressure. In patients taking plain felodipine tablets, 10mg bid for 10 days, the blood pressure reduction was evident for 12 hours but not 24 hours after each dose. At steady state, the maximal felodipine plasma concentration was 25.2 +/- 1.5 nmol/L and occurred 1.3 +/- 0.2 (range 1 to 3) hours after drug intake. When an extended release formulation of felodipine (20mg once every morning) was used, a more even plasma concentration curve was achieved. After 2 weeks' treatment, the maximal felodipine plasma concentration was 23.3 +/- 2.7 nmol/L and was reached 4.4 +/- 0.5 (range 3 to 7) hours after each dose. Systolic as well as diastolic blood pressure at steady state were reduced over 24 hours. No disturbing side effects were noted on either felodipine formulation. From these studies we conclude that oral felodipine lowers blood pressure in patients with moderate to severe hypertension when added to a beta-adrenergic blocker/diuretic combination. The extended release formulation given in a once-daily long term regimen produced a significant and equally satisfactorily controlled blood pressure reduction over 24 hours compared with the plain tablets but has the advantage of once-daily rather than twice-daily administration.", 
    "52": "In an open-labelled cross-over study, ten healthy males received an oral dose of piretanide (6 mg tablet), penbutolol (40 mg film-coated tablet) or the fixed dose combination (film-coated tablet). Serum pharmacokinetics and 48 h urinary excretion of each drug were determined for the three dose regimens. The serum pharmacokinetics and excretion of penbutolol were unchanged in combination with piretanide. In combination with penbutolol the maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of piretanide was lowered by 40% (p less than 0.05) and time to reach Cmax delayed from 1.0 h to 1.6 h (p less than 0.05). However, areas under the serum concentration-time curves over 12 h and excretion of piretanide were unchanged, and its diuretic effect was undiminished. Thus the bioavailability of piretanide was unaffected by combination with penbutolol. The above changes in the pharmacokinetics of piretanide were explained entirely by differences in dissolution of the conventional and film-coated tablets. The drugs were safe and well tolerated.", 
    "53": "1. Preliminary results are reported from a long-term study aimed at recording the concentrations of serum lipids and lipoproteins at 6, 12 and 24 months of treatment with pindolol in young/middle-aged males with moderate hypertension. 2. Seventy-three patients have been recruited, of whom 47 have completed 6 months treatment. After 6 months treatment 35/47 patients had attained the target blood pressure of less than or equal to 95 mm Hg and analysis of plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations revealed a tendency for an increase of serum triglycerides and a lowering of low density lipoprotein cholesterol.", 
    "54": "1. At 30 weeks of age, homozygote diabetic C57 BL KsJ (db/db) mice were grossly obese, lethargic and displayed moderate hair loss relative to heterozygote control C 57 BL KsJ (db/+) mice. 2. In diabetic mice, compared to control, the total body weights, liver weight: body weight ratios, and blood glucose levels were increased 2.3 fold, 20% and 3.1 fold, respectively. 3. Analysis of plasma membranes isolated from control and diabetic mouse liver established that comparable purity levels were achieved since relative specific activities of the plasma membrane markers 5'-nucleotidase and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase were similar: 10.2 and 11.4 fold with respect to 5'-nucleotidase in control and diabetic states respectively; and 8.0 and 8.3 fold with respect to gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase in control and diabetic states respectively. 4. A select effect of diabetes on gamma-glutamyltranspepetidase, however, was observed. The activity of this enzyme was found to be reduced 16% in diabetic liver compared to control liver. 5. Assessment of [3H]prazosin and [3H]dihydrolalprenolol binding to mouse liver plasma membranes indicated that although there was no difference in beta-adrenergic receptor binding in control and diabetic states, alpha 1-adrenergic receptor binding was found to be reduced 43% in diabetic mouse liver plasma membranes. 6. Scatchard analyses of kinetic studies indicate that the reduction is a reflection of decreases in alpha 1-adrenergic receptor numbers with no change in alpha 1 receptor affinity in the diabetic state: since for diabetic and control liver plasma membranes, Kd values were 3.41 +/- 0.02 nM and 3.40 +/- 0.01 nM respectively; and Bmax were 650.12 +/- 16.44 fmol mg-1 and 380.76 +/- 12.92 fmol mg-1, respectively.", 
    "55": "To elucidate the role of circulating hypertensive factors in the spontaneously hypertensive rat and the effects of antihypertensive treatment on the circulating hypertensive factor, cross circulation was performed in 54 couples of spontaneously hypertensive and normotensive rats. In normotensive rats cross-circulated with untreated spontaneously hypertensive rats mean arterial pressure increased by 20.9 +/- 12.2 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). Increases in mean arterial pressure were also obtained by cross-circulation with spontaneously hypertensive rats pretreated with propranolol, furosemide, and nifedipine. Mean arterial pressure was not changed by cross circulation after pretreatment of the spontaneously hypertensive rats with alpha methyldopa. It is concluded that in this strain of spontaneously hypertensive rats a circulating hypertensive factor exists, the secretion of which can be suppressed by the centrally acting drug, alpha methyldopa. Therefore either the central nervous system may take part in the regulation of the factor or the factor may be synthetized in the central nervous system.", 
    "56": "In a double-blind randomized study of 154 postmyocardial infarction patients assigned to metoprolol (100 mg twice daily) and 147 patients assigned placebo, the outcome during a 3-year follow-up according to serum cholesterol concentrations was evaluated. There was no indication that metoprolol influenced the total serum cholesterol concentration. The median cholesterol value at 3 months was 6.7 mmol/l. In patients with cholesterol less than or equal to 6.7 mmol/l, nonfatal reinfarctions were reduced in the metoprolol group (7 vs. 24%; p less than 0.01). In patients with cholesterol greater than 6.7 mmol/l, mortality was lower in those treated with metoprolol (8 vs. 20%; p less than 0.05). The beneficial effect of conventional postinfarction beta-blockade with metoprolol is independent of serum cholesterol concentration.", 
    "57": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is characterized by progredient myocardial hypertrophy causing ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Long-term results of beta-blocker therapy have been disappointing. Neither the impaired ventricular filling or the prognosis are improved. In contrast, calcium antagonists mainly influence diastolic ventricular dynamics, but also have beneficial effects on systolic function. The results of long-term therapy with calcium antagonists, including patients treated for more than 10 years, are presented here. A total of 84 consecutive patients (mean age 43 years; 20 female and 64 male) with confirmed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were treated with high doses of calcium antagonists (mean doses of 515 mg verapamil or 158 mg gallopamil per day). In the course of therapy with a mean duration of 52 months, heart size--assessed by X-ray technique--and Sokolow-index in the ECG decreased significantly (heart volume: from 947 to 885 ml/1.73 m2 body surface; Sokolow-index: from 5.0 to 4.5 mV). The echocardiogram showed a significant decrease in left atrial diameter, whereas wall thickness only tended to decrease. Hemodynamic control investigations confirmed an improvement in systolic as well as in diastolic ventricular function (mean follow-up period was 31 months). According to these findings the condition and stress tolerance improved in 84% of the patients. Therapy with calcium antagonists also improved prognosis: without treatment or following treatment with beta-blocking agents, annual mortality is approximately 3.5%, whereas in the described patient population mortality dropped to less than 2%. Thus, a calcium antagonist is the medication of first choice for patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.", 
    "58": "The therapeutic effectiveness of propranolol, verapamil and surgery (transaortal subvalvular myectomy) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was assessed in 100 patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) and 12 patients with hypertrophic non-obstructive cardiomyopathy (HNCM) by means of exercise tests with hemodynamic measurements. The effects of propranolol were assessed in 13 HOCM patients, of verapamil in 68 HOCM patients and 12 HNCM patients, and of surgery in 31 HOCM patients after a mean of 3 to 9 months. Of the 68 verapamil-treated patients, 23 were reexamined once more after a mean of 38 months. Ten of the 31 surgically treated patients were reexamined after a mean of 52 months. In the studies performed within the first year of medical treatment or after surgery, verapamil was clinically and hemodynamically superior to propranolol, but not as effective as surgical treatment. Functional limitation according to the NYHA classification improved after propranolol in 31% of the patients, after verapamil in 41%, and after surgery in 94% of the cases. Improvements by more than one NYHA class were observed exclusively after surgical treatment. Maximal exercise capacity was, on average, not changed after propranolol, but increased after verapamil and, more substantially, after surgery. These different responses to treatment could be attributed to hemodynamic changes, especially concerning heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, arterio-venous oxygen difference and pulmonary artery pressure. In the case of verapamil, the beneficial hemodynamic effects occurred independently of the site of intraventricular obstruction in HOCM (subvalvular or midventricular), but seemed to be superior in HOCM as compared to HNCM. The late reexaminations, an average of 38 months after beginning verapamil treatment and 52 months after surgery, demonstrated that the initial salutary clinical and hemodynamic effects of verapamil were not maintained during long-term follow-up in the majority of patients, whereas they persisted or even intensified during long-term observation after surgery.", 
    "59": "Fifteen (14 male and one female) patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, ranging from 22 to 67 (mean: 45.5) years of age were treated with oral nifedipine and propranolol for 6 to 24 (mean:18) months. Twelve of the patients had been pretreated with a mean oral dose of 560 mg verapamil for 60 up to 93 (mean: 78.5) months, showing slight subjective and objective improvement. Treatment with nifedipine-propranolol was terminated in five cases due to deterioration or side effects after 6 and 12 months, respectively. During combined therapy, two patients reported subjective improvement, but in five cases there was no change and eight patients reported deterioration. The mean Sokolow-index showed no change. The radiologically determined heart volume increased in 11/15 patients and significantly in the mean of all patients from 887 +/- 239 to 947 +/- 246 ml/m2. In addition, echocardiographic measurements showed a significant increase in left atrial diameter from 40.0 +/- 9 to 42.1 +/- 9 mm, whereas ventricular wall thickness remained unchanged. Thus, high dose verapamil therapy seems superior to nifedipine-propranolol therapy in most patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.", 
    "60": "The potentialities and importance of methods of ultrasonic investigation including two-dimension and Doppler echocardiography were demonstrated in the diagnosis of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and in the detection of hemodynamic characteristics of the disease in different patients. Hemodynamic characteristics revealed by echocardiography could serve as a basis for an individual choice of therapy and assessment of its effectiveness during long-term treatment.", 
    "61": "Altogether 65 patients with the sinoatrial node weakness syndrome (SANWS) and 48 patients with the heart pain syndrome (control group) were examined for a study of the corrected time of sinoatrial node function recovery (CTSNFR) and the time of sinoatrial conduction (TSAC) before and after medicamentous vegetative blockade (MVB). A considerable increase in CTSNFR and TSAC sensitivity after MVB was noted. In most of the SANWS patients CTSNFR after MVB was increased, TSAC was decreased. Elevated CTSNFR in the SANWS patients was determined by the effect of propranolol and atropine and was noted mainly during atrial stimulation with a high frequency (over 160 imp/min).", 
    "62": "Medroxalol hydrochloride is an antihypertensive agent with beta 1 adrenergic cardiac blocking properties, and beta 2 and some alpha 1 vasodilating activity. In previous carcinogenicity studies medroxalol was shown to induce leiomyomas of the uterus in CD-1 mice but not in Long Evans rats. In addition, there was a significant increase in endometrial stromal sarcomas in mice receiving the lowest dose of medroxalol; however, the lack of a dose response made the relationship to treatment questionable. Because of these findings, additional 18-month drug diet studies were conducted in 3 parallel segments using female CD-1 mice to determine the effects of: 1) an expanded range of doses, 2) various durations of dosing, and 3) the effect of the beta-blocker, propranolol, on leiomyoma induction. These studies confirmed the fact that chronic dietary treatment with medroxalol can lead to an increased incidence of leiomyomas in the mouse uterus, but failed to demonstrate any relationship between endometrial stromal sarcomas and medroxalol administration. A linear trend occurred in the incidence of leiomyomas and of smooth muscle hypertrophy/hyperplasia, a possible precursor to leiomyoma. Both findings were notably increased at 250 mg/kg/day or more. Doses of 50 mg/kg/day or less were considered no effect levels. At 500 mg/kg/day a treatment period of 12 months or more was required before a noticeable increase in leiomyomas occurred in mice examined after 18 months. The beta-blocker, propranolol, prevented this increase in leiomyomas, and led to the conclusion that the beta 2 agonist activity of medroxalol was involved in their induction. Propranolol did not block the spontaneous occurrence of these tumors.", 
    "63": "The carcinogenic potential of medroxalol hydrochloride, an antihypertensive agent with beta 1 adrenergic cardiac blocking properties, and beta 2 and some alpha 1 vasodilating activity, was studied by dietary administration. Long Evans rats were treated for 2 years and CD-1 mice for 18 months at dosages of 0, 50, 250 or 500 mg/kg/day. Medroxalol did not produce any evidence of a tumorigenic effect in the Long Evans rat, but graying of pigmented hair was noted at 250 and 500 mg/kg/day and is probably related to melanin binding of the drug. In the CD-1 mouse, there was a dose related increase in uterine leiomyomas that was statistically significant (p less than 0.05) at doses of 250 and 500 mg/kg/day. The incidence at 50 mg/kg/day was not different from control. Endometrial stromal sarcomas were observed only in treated mice, and pairwise comparison with controls indicated a statistically significant difference (p less than 0.05) only at the lowest dosage (50 mg/kg/day). The latter finding may not be related to treatment since there was no dose response and the incidence in the two higher dose groups was neither statistically significant nor higher than occasionally seen in other control groups.", 
    "64": "The association of pulmonic stenosis with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is rare in infancy. Presented here is an infant with atypical picture of pulmonic stenosis and echocardiographic evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. At eight months of age, she had a successful percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty and has subsequently been managed with propranolol.", 
    "65": "The pharmacokinetics and absolute bioavailability of carvedilol have been studied in 20 male healthy volunteers in a randomised 4-period, cross-over trial. Carvedilol 12.5 mg was given i.v., 50 mg was administered p.o. as a suspension and 25 and 50 mg were given in a capsule formulation. For the 50 mg capsule Cmax was 66 micrograms.l-1, tmax 1.2 h, t1/2 6.4 h. The t1/2 after i.v. administration was 2.4 h, CL 589 ml/min and VZ 132 l. The absolute bioavailability was 24% (50 mg capsule). The kinetics after the 25 and 50 mg capsules were consistent with dose linearity.", 
    "66": "Long-term study of new antihypertensive drugs according to the programme worked out by the Cooperative Trial of Drugs for the Prevention of Arterial Hypertension (CTDPAH) is based on a system approach including observation of patients with essential hypertension and secondary hypertension with different initial level of arterial pressure, simultaneous study of the effect of three basic antihypertensive drugs, and evaluation of the action of these drugs with the application of a stepwise scheme. The study is long-term, cooperative (multicentral) and controlled. The first results in 387 patients, obtained in the curse of 5 to 8 months, showed that in nearly half of the patients with stable, mild or moderate hypertension it is possible to use prolonged antihypertensive monotherapy, with one third of these cases showing normalization of pressure, and other third partial effect. Most promising for long-term antihypertensive prevention proves to be prazosin, an alpha 1-postsynaptic adrenoreceptor blocking drug, which in contrast to propranolol has a marked antiatherogenic effect on blood plasma lipoproteins.", 
    "67": "In 7 pregnant hypertensive patients the elimination half-life of propranolol was enhanced to 6.1 +/- 1.2 h in comparison to 4.4 +/- 0.4 in 9 nonpregnant females. In 8 out of 11 pregnant hypertensive patients in the 29th week of gestation treated with 90 mg phenobarbital daily for at least 7 days before starting propranolol therapy, the half-life of propranolol was 3.1 +/- 0.4 h only. This significant difference between pregnant women with and without phenobarbital pretreatment is discussed as enzyme induction by phenobarbital.", 
    "68": "Clinical efficiency of plasmapheresis in 18 patients with unstable angina pectoris refractory to medical treatment was studied. Plasmapheresis had practically no effect on the acid-base balance, electrolyte and gas blood composition, as well as blood osmolarity. During the study no reliable changes in arterial blood pressure, heart rate and no heart rhythm disturbances were registered. Introduction of plasmapheresis into the complex therapy of patients with unstable angina pectoris refractory to medical treatment made anginal syndrome less pronounced.", 
    "69": "Verapamil-induced cardiovascular depression has been examined in dial-urethane-anesthetized open chest dogs. Verapamil was administered slowly intravenously until the mean arterial pressure was decreased by approximately 45 mm Hg. The dose of verapamil required to reach the hemodynamic endpoint was 1,495 +/- (SE) 165 micrograms/kg. In a second group, interactions between beta-adrenergic blockade, propranolol 1 mg/kg (i.v.), and verapamil were examined. Although propranolol alone had only minor hemodynamic effects, the cardiac depressant dose of verapamil was reduced significantly to 450 +/- 105 micrograms/kg. After cardiovascular depression with verapamil or verapamil plus propranolol, glucagon was administered to assess its inotropic activity using cumulative doses of 5, 15, and 45 micrograms/kg over 20 min. Glucagon produced a dose-dependent recovery of heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and PR interval. Depressed contractility assessed by peak positive dP/dt and right ventricular isometric contractile force also recovered after glucagon. These results suggest a significant interaction between the potency of verapamil as a myocardial depressant and the state of the myocardium as affected by beta-blockade. Cardiac depression by verapamil or verapamil in combination with propranolol was reversible by glucagon.", 
    "70": "A beta 2-selective adrenergic-receptor-blocking drug, ICI 118.551, 150 mg/day, prevented almost as effectively as the nonselective antagonist propranolol, 240 mg/day, the isoprenaline enhancement of essential tremor amplitude.", 
    "71": "Following topical administration to albino rabbits, bunolol hydrochloride, a beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, was rapidly absorbed and distributed in ocular tissues, and transformed intraocularly to a single metabolite, dihydrobunolol. The half-life of bunolol was approximately 1.26 hours in the aqueous humor and 1.63 hours in the ciliary body. There was no significant accumulation of bunolol during a four-day period of twice-daily dosing. Most of the drug was excreted in the urine following ocular or intravenous administration.", 
    "72": "The haemodynamic effects of a combined intravenous treatment of nifedipine and propranolol in ten patients with coronary artery disease compared to a single treatment with nifedipine or placebo were investigated. Nifedipine infusion resulted in a reduction of left ventricular (LV) afterload and LV volumes with an increase in heart rate and EF and no change of the double product, coronary sinus flow, LV diastolic parameters and dp/dtmax. Addition of propranolol lowers myocardial oxygen demand by reducing heart rate and dp/dtmax together with a sustained afterload reduction with no change in LV volumes and EF. The vasodilatatory action of nifedipine pretreatment balanced the negative effects of acute beta-receptor blockade on LV function and allows the reduction of myocardial oxygen demand without a deterioration of LV function.", 
    "73": "Oral administration of felodipine to 10 patients with mild essential hypertension acutely reduced the brachial artery pressure by 15/13mm Hg. The tachycardia which occurred was sustained for 90 minutes together with an elevated plasma noradrenaline concentration. Addition of intravascular metoprolol after 90 minutes decreased heart rate. The felodipine-induced increase of plasma renin activity (100%; p less than 0.001) was completely reversed by metoprolol. Plasma angiotensin II (PA II) rose by 15% (p less than 0.05) during felodipine, whereas plasma aldosterone concentration was not significantly affected.", 
    "74": "Twenty-nine black hypertensive patients were randomized to treatment with controlled-release hydralazine capsules administered BID or QD, or immediate-release hydralazine tablets administered TID, for at least four weeks in a double-blind, parallel study. Hydralazine was begun after a two-week to four-week period in which blood pressure was not adequately controlled with diuretics alone. Each patient initially received 75 mg/day of the assigned drug. The dosage could be increased to 150 or 300 mg/day at weekly intervals if sitting diastolic blood pressure was not adequately controlled (greater than 90 mmHg). A beta-blocker (80 mg/day of nadolol) was added only for patients who had beta-blocker-responsive adverse effects that could not be controlled otherwise. Nine patients were considered unevaluable because of protocol violations or withdrawal from the study before completion of four weeks of treatment, primarily because of adverse effects. Twenty patients were included in the efficacy evaluation. Controlled-release hydralazine BID produced statistically significant mean falls from baseline in sitting diastolic blood pressure and in standing systolic blood pressure and an almost significant drop in standing diastolic blood pressure. Although the other two treatment groups also had substantial falls in all blood pressure measurements, the changes from baseline were not statistically significant. No significant difference in response was noted between patients who received a beta-blocker and those who did not. There were no statistically significant differences among the three treatment groups in incidence and severity of adverse effects or electrocardiographic abnormalities. A statistically, but not clinically, significant fall in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell count was observed in all three treatment groups."
