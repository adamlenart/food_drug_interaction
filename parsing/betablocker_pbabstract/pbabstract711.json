    "0": "Supramaximal electrical field stimulation was employed to produce biphasic response in segments of cervical and thoracic tracheas and in first generation of bronchi isolated from guinea pigs. This response consists of contraction (as measured by maximal active tension, ATmax) followed by relaxation (as measured by maximal active relaxation, ARmax). First, the effect of electrical stimulation was studied in relation to frequency and duration of impulse. Highest degree of relaxation (ARmax) was achieved with a frequency of stimulus of 40 pulses per sec for segments of trachea, and 60 pulses per sec for first generation bronchi, and with duration of pulse of 1.0 msec for segments of trachea, and 2.0-2.5 msec for bronchi, and with duration of pulse of 1.0 msec for segments of trachea, and 2.0-2.5 msec for bronchi. Secondly, mean length-tension relationship was determined. It was found that maximal relaxation (ARmax) occurred at 160 +/- 5% of Lmax in case of tracheal segments and 160 +/- 2% of Lmax for bronchial preparations. Using propranolol pretreatment (10(-4) M), which inhibited participation of adrenergic receptors in relaxation, it was determined that approximately 50% relaxation of airway smooth muscle of the normal guinea pig is mediated through the purinergic nervous system. Both tracheas and bronchi isolated from sensitized guinea pigs, chronically exposed to antigen, showed a significant decrease in overall relaxation (P less than 0.01). However, the per cent decrease in relaxation after propranolol was not different in sensitized animals than that found in controls. The data suggest that relaxation of segments of airways isolated from animals chronically exposed to antigen is decreased in consequence of alterations in both purinergic and adrenergic nervous systems.", 
    "1": "Tolerance to catecholamines in the beta-adrenergic and dopaminergic receptor-adenylate cyclase system from the rat prostatic membrane has been studied. Preincubation of the tissue with isoproterenol produced not only a decrease in beta-adrenergic receptors and its sensitive adenylate cyclase activity, but also a reduction in dopaminergic response. Similarly, exposure to dopamine resulted in a decline both of isoproterenol- and dopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. A beta adrenergic antagonist, propranolol, exclusively blocked desensitization in the beta-adrenergic and dopaminergic adenylate cyclase system caused by isoproterenol, while dopamine-induced refractoriness was prevented by a dopaminergic antagonist, haloperidol. These results suggest that desensitization of the beta-adrenergic and dopaminergic adenylate cyclase system begins on receptor-occupation by its specific agonist.", 
    "2": "To determine whether the baroreflex control of heart rate is altered during acute myocardial ischaemia, the baroreflex slope was measured at the control state, during coronary occlusion, and at the recovery phase in nine conscious dogs. The baroreflex slope was obtained by relating the R-R interval to the preceding systolic pressure during phenylephrine-induced transient hypertension. The baroreflex slope was reduced during coronary occlusion (18.8 +/- 3.8 ms.kPa-1, mean +/- SE) compared with that at the control state (41.4 +/- 6.0 ms.kPa-1). This reduction in the baroreflex slope during coronary occlusion was also present after propranolol, which suggests that this reduction of the slope during myocardial ischaemia is not due to a simultaneous increase in beta-adrenergic activity. These results suggest that the reflex originating from the cardiac receptors may modulate heart rate response to arterial baroreceptor stimulation.", 
    "3": "Metoprolol (200 mg daily) and propranolol (160 mg daily) were each given for one week to 11 normal subjects. The order of administration was randomized and not known to us during the study. Each period of treatment with active drug was followed by one week during which placebo tablets were taken. M-mode echocardiograms and blood pressure were recorded before entry to the trial, twice during each week of treatment with metoprolol or propranolol, and daily for three days and on the seventh day after stopping the drugs. Septal and posterior wall endocardial echoes were traced with an X-Y digitiser and left ventricular minor axis dimensions derived every 10 ms with a minicomputer. Both drugs reduced heart rate, cardiac output, and blood pressure. Systemic vascular resistance was increased significantly by propranolol, and with both agents was inversely related to heart rate, cardiac output, left ventricular diastolic dimension, and indices of contractility.", 
    "4": "Measurements of urinary metanephrines by the Pisano procedure (Clin. Chim. Acta 5: 406, 1960) are unreliable in patients who are taking propranolol owing to the presence of 4-hydroxypropranolol in the urine. Three properties of this propranolol metabolite lead to interference: (a) it is absorbed and eluted from ion-exchange resins under the conditions Pisano used for metanephrine isolation, (b) at high pH it absorbs at 350 to 360 nm, and (c) it is oxidized by periodate to a substance with negligible absorption in this region. Because 350 to 360 nm is the wavelength used to quantitate vanillin, the product formed from periodate oxidation of metanephrines, and because the unoxidized eluate is used as a specimen blank, the presence of 4-hydroxypropranolol spuriously decreases the measured urinary metanephrines; this has special significance because patients being tested for increased metanephrines are also likely to be receiving propranolol for hypertension.", 
    "5": "Blood superfusion techniques were used to study the effects of verapamil on the body surface electrocardiogram and blood pressure of intact, anesthetized dogs as well as transmembrane action potential characteristics of isolated Purkinje fibers. Verapamil, 100 to 600 microgram/kg, administered in sequential doses intravenously to the intact (donor) animal caused a dose-dependent increase in the P-R interval and a decrease in systemic arterial pressure while exerting no significant effect on the normal, fast response Purkinje fiber action potential. To study effects of verapamil in depolarized fibers, maintained stretch was applied to Purkinje fibers until resting potentials had decreased from approximately -91 mV to a stable level of approximately -55 mV. For these fibers, verapamil, 400 microgram/kg, given as a single injection almost totally suppressed the slow response action potential while prolonging the P-R interval by less than 30% above control. These experiments suggest that in the presence of normal sinus and atrioventricular nodal function, plasma concentrations of verapamil which abolish the slow response action potential should have no major effect on sinus rate and atrioventricular conduction.", 
    "6": "Although propranolol administration produces a lowering of PRA, PAC does not decrease in a similar fashion. In the present study the effects of propranolol on the aldosterone MCR were examined. Eight patients with essential hypertension were studied while receiving treatment with a diuretic and again after propranolol (160 to 320 mg/day) was added to the therapeutic regimen. Propranolol therapy was associated with a 25% decrease in PRA (p less than 0.05) and changes in PACs that were variable but not significantly different from diuretic therapy alone. The aldosterone MCR decreased from 1420 +/- 120 to 1120 +/- 90 L/24 hr in response to propranolol (p less than 0.01). The average production rate of aldosterone (MCR X PAC) did not change after propranolol treatment despite a decrease in PRA. There were no changes in plasma concentrations of potassium or in ACTH secretion (as reflected by levels of cortisol) to explain a role for propranolol to sustain aldosterone secretion. Thus propranolol administered to hypertensive patients pretreated with a diuretic can affect circulating levels of aldosterone apart from changes in PRA. Propranolol therapy produces a moderate reduction in aldosterone MCR and appears to augment aldosterone production by a mechanism exclusive of known stimuli.", 
    "7": "Isolated rat thymocytes were preincubated with various catecholamines, alone and together with 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T(3)), and the accumulation of the glucose analogues, 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) and 3-O-methylglucose (3-O-MG), was then measured. Epinephrine induced a time- and dose-dependent increase in the 15-min accumulation of 2-DG; at a concentration of 100 muM epinephrine, the effect was evident after a preincubation period of only 5 min. The lowest concentration of epinephrine at which a significant effect was evident was 1 muM. Epinephrine also produced a dose-dependent increase in the accumulation of 3-O-MG, and the lowest concentration at which a significant effect was evident was again 1 muM. Isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist, like epinephrine, increased the accumulation of 2-DG, whereas the alpha-agonist, phenylephrine, had no effect. The response to epinephrine was inhibited by the beta-antagonist, alprenolol, but the alpha-antagonist, phentolamine, had no effect. As previously demonstrated, T(3) increased 2-DG accumulation, and like epinephrine, its effect was blocked by alprenolol. Neither T(3) (0.1 nM) nor epinephrine (0.1 muM) had any effect when acting alone, but when added together at these concentrations, they significantly increased the accumulation of both 2-DG and 3-O-MG. Neither T(3) with isoproterenol nor T(3) with phenylephrine produced a comparable synergistic effect. But T(3) (0.1 nM) acting with isoproterenol (0.1 muM) and phenylephrine (0.1 muM) together, synergistically increased 2-DG accumulation. In addition, the alpha-antagonist, phentolamine, which alone had no effect, inhibited the synergistic effect induced by T(3) and epinephrine. The effects of epinephrine and T(3) alone, as well as their combined synergistic effect on 2-DG accumulation, were not blocked by the inhibitor of protein synthesis, puromycin. FROM THESE RESULTS WE CONCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: (a) the stimulatory effect of the catecholamines on the accumulation of 2-DG and 3-O-MG reflects an action at the beta-receptor; (b) the synergistic interaction between T(3) and epinephrine requires the participation of both beta- and alpha-adrenergic components; (c) T(3) and epinephrine act on 2-DG and 3-O-MG accumulation through a common mechanism or inter-related mechanisms, probably mediated at the beta-adrenergic site; and (d) these effects of T(3) and epinephrine, alone and together, are independent of new protein synthesis. These results suggest that, with respect to the response we are describing, T(3) and epinephrine do not act on nuclear mechanisms, but may act instead at the level of the plasma membrane.", 
    "8": "The efficary of atenolol given one daily was assessed in 41 otherwise healthy hypertensive patients over a period of six months. Twelve patients whose blood pressure was not well-controlled on methyldopa and chlorthalidone and 11 patients who were treated previously with other beta-blockers all benefited from atenolol which appeared to be effective and well-tollerated. Ten patients complained of fatigue not necessarily related to a drop in blood pressure, and two of headache. Respiratory functions were assessed in a double blind trial on 30 patients. No significant changes in any of the expiratory flow rates were recorded after three months of continuous treatment with atenolol in either smokers or nonsmokers.", 
    "9": "A catheter-tip velocity transducer with two high-fidelity pressure manometers was used to evaluate the left ventricular (LV) hemodynamic effects of intravenous propranolol (10 mg). Nine patients without clinical evidence of heart failure were studied. Pulsatile ascending aortic blood flow velocity and pressure and LV pressure were measured continuously during drug administration. Beat-to-beat changes in stroke volume index, stroke work index, LV end-diastolic pressure, maximum blood flow velocity and acceleration, and maximum LV dP/dt were determined. Propranolol produced a decrease in maximum blood flow velocity (from 58 +/- 4.7 to 42 +/- 5.1 cm/sec, p less than 0.002), and acceleration (from 1181 +/- 130 to 847 +/- 117 cm/sec2, p less than 0.002, max dP/dt (from 1361 +/- 70 to 1146 +/- 63 mm Hg/sec, p less than 0.002), stroke volume index (from 47 +/- 3.0 to 38 +/- 3.2 ml/m2, p less than 0.002) and total stroke work index (from 702 +/- 33 to 603 +/- 44 mJ/m2 p less than 0.04), with little change in mean aortic pressure, peak systolic pressure and LV end-diastolic pressure. Depression in myocardial function was detectable within 1 minute after initiation of propranolol and persisted when negative chronotropic effects were eliminated by atrial pacing. The multisensor catheter technique allows rapid and safe detection of changes in cardiovascular function during propranolol administration in conscious man.", 
    "10": "Sixteen healthy men were evaluated for left ventricular performance changes and beta-blockade after therapeutic oral doses of disopyramide and propranolol administered alone and concurrently. The volunteers were randomly assigned to receive one of two drug treatment regimens that differed in the sequence and duration of administration of the drugs. Left ventricular function was assessed by echocardiographically determined ejection fraction (EF) and systolic time intervals. Beta-blockade was assessed by changes in exercise heart rate. Both disopyramide and propranolol exhibited negative inotropic activity, as evidenced by significant, although clinically inconsequential, decreases in EF and increases in the ratio of preejection period to left ventricular ejection time. The negative inotropic effects of a single 200-mg dose of disopyramide and an 80-mg dose of propranolol were comparable, while chronic disopyramide therapy (200 mg every 6 hours for 1 week) had a greater negative inotropic effect than chronic propranolol therapy (80 mg every 8 hours for 1 week). Only propranolol had beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity. When the drugs were administered concurrently, the negative inotropic effects of oral propranolol and disopyramide were neither additive nor synergistic.", 
    "11": "Questions of the identification of the type of pharmacological activity of physiologically active substances (PAS) with a receptor type of action under conditions of screening are examined. IN accordance with current concepts of the theory of the recognition of modes, the type of action of PAS was identified by establishing a set of criteria (\"vectors of modes\") characteristic of the effect of known substances and by selecting methods of comparing them with the vectors of the modes of the compounds being tested. Test parameters recorded by the the functional multiparametric method permitting identification of the type of the effects and an evaluation of their quantitative manifestations with the framework of a single experimental approach were used as the unknown set of criteria. The method of describing the relative change in the parameters from the dose as the vectors of action was used and the function of proximity (similarity).", 
    "12": "Mongrel dogs were chronically instrumented to measure left circumflex coronary flow, arterial pressure, left atrial pressure, ECG, heart rate and in some cases, left ventricular pressure or cardiac output. A cuff type occluder was placed distal to the flow probe. Total occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery for one minute in unsedated, resting dogs produced reactive hyperemia with an average replacement/deficit ratio of 2.63/1. In 11 dogs, sympathetic influences were investigated by chronic surgical cardiac sympathectomy. Surgical section of all ansae subclaviae responses from 2.61/1 to 1.67/1 (P less than 0.001). Left sympathectomy alone had no effect on the replacement/deficit ratio whereas selective right sympathectomy reduced it from 2.25/1 to 1.38/1. Pharmacological blockade was used to determine beta-receptor involvement in the responses. In 9 intact dogs practolol (10 mg/kg) reduced the reactive hyperemia ratio by 12% (P less than 0.05). Propranolol (1 mg/kg) further reduced this ratio by 30% (P less than 0.001). Our results suggest that sympathetic beta influences work primarily through the right cardiac sympathetic nerves. Also, the magnitude of the response appears to be due, in part, to increased metabolic activity associated with myocardial beta 1-receptors and heart rate increase as well as active vasodilation through beta 2-receptors.", 
    "13": "Fifty-six tuberculosis patients and twenty-eight control subjects were evaluated in a comprehensive investigation of cellular and humoral immune function in pulmonary TB. The patient group showed significantly higher levels of secretory IgA and serum IgG, IgA and IgM than did the control group but 7% of patients displayed a selective secretory IgA deficiency. Levels of alpha-1-antitrypsin were also significantly higher in the patient group. There were no significant differences in levels of total haemolytic complement, C'3 and C'4. In moderate to moderately advanced TB patients there were no significant differences in T and B cell numbers nor in mitogen-induced lymphocyte transformation and lymphokine production, when compared with the control group. The range of PPD-induced lymphocyte transformation and lymphokine production levels encountered was similar in both groups although certain patients did not respond to the PPD antigen. Neutrophils from TB patients showed increased random motility in vitro but eight out of ten patients showed impaired directed motility (chemotaxis). Phagocytic and anti-microbial functions were normal in the patient group. The neutrophil chemotactic defect was reversible and could be corrected in vitro when the patients' cells were treated with sodium and calcium ascorbate, levamisole, metoprolol and propranolol.", 
    "14": "Eleven patients were treated for essential hypertension with metoprolol (Selok\u00e9n) for more than three months. The time course of changes in blood pressure, pulse rate and plasma renin activity was studied during treatment with an oral maintenance dose of 100 mg twice daily. Significant decreases in pulse rate, diastolic blood pressure and plasma renin activity were observed even after the first dose. The plasma concentration of metoprolol reached equilibrium after the second dose. After the third dose there was no further significant change in blood pressure. There was a significant correlation (p < 0.001) between the initial (after three doses) and final (after > 90 days) effect of metoprolol on blood pressure (r = 0.86 and 0.91 for systolic and diastolic blood pressure change, respectively).", 
    "15": "A hypothesis that the beta-adrenergic blocking drugs may possess weak alpha-adrenergic blocking activity, and that their antihypertensive effect may be due to this combined alpha - and beta-adrenergic blockade was tested. Phenoxybenzamine (PBZ) and propranolol (PPL) were selected as alpha - and beta-blocking drugs, respectively. They were given orally at doses of 1--100 mg/kg per day, 5 days per week. Their combined antihypertensive effects were determined in spontaneously hypertensive; deoxycorticosterone and salt hypertensive; and two kidney, one clip renal hypertensive rats. PBZ treatment showed antihypertensive effect in three models of hypertensive rats. However, addition of PPL either did not affect or rather antagonized the effect of PBZ. Moreover, the combined treatment increased side-effects, typically seen as urinary incontinence. The results did not support the above hypothesis, at least when the blockade was caused with PBZ and PPL.", 
    "16": "Although drug treatment of hypertension is associated with improved survival and decreased vascular complications, drug compliance is a major problem in the control of hypertension. All antihypertensive medications are associated with side effects; thus, it is a physician's responsibility to explain to each patient the side effects of the drugs he prescribes to treat hypertension, and to instill in the patient a sense of necessity for the treatment of hypertension. The choice of antihypertensive drug should be made based on each patient's lifestyle, overall health and ability to tolerate the drug. Ideally, the antihypertensive regimen should be simple, effective, convenient to take and have very few side effects.", 
    "17": "Epinephrine (50 ng . kg-1 . min-1) was infused for 120 min in seven normal volunteers alone (combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimulation), with propranolol (alpha-adrenergic stimulation), and with propranolol plus phentolamine (alpha-adrenergic blockade superimposed on alpha-adrenergic stimulation). During alpha-adrenergic stimulation, plasma glucose and glucose production increased 32 and 42% less, respectively, than during infusion of epinephrine alone, whereas glucose clearance was suppressed comparably. Plasma insulin decreased during alpha-adrenergic stimulation but increased during infusion of epinephrine alone. Plasma epinephrine was threefold greater during infusion of epinephrine plus propranolol than during infusion of epinephrine alone. When alpha-adrenergic blockade was superimposed on alpha-adrenergic stimulation, the increases in plasma glucose and glucose production as well as the decreases in plasma insulin and glucose clearance observed during alpha-adrenergic stimulation were virtually abolished, whereas plasma epinephrine levels were unaltered. These results indicate that in man epinephrine can cause hyperglycemia via both alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimulation of glucose production and suppression of glucose clearance, either directly or indirectly. alpha-Adrenergic effects on glucose production and clearance may be mediated by inhibition of insulin secretion.", 
    "18": "The cardiovascular effects of prostaglandin (PG) I2 and E2 were investigated in the anesthetized dog and in the isolated blood perfused canine atrial preparation cross-circulated by the donor dog. When small doses of PGI2 (less than .01 microgram/kg) or PGE2 (1 microgram/kg) were injected into the jugular vein of the donor dog, there was a slight fall in blood pressure (5-10 mm Hg) and a slight degree of tachycardia (2-6 beats/min). However, larger doses of PGI2 (1-10 microgram/kg) or PGE2 (3-10 microgram/kg) produced hypotension that was associated with marked bradycardia. The bradycardia produced by both PGE2 and PGI2 in the donor dog was blocked by either atropine pretreatment or vagotomy and was inverted to tachycardia. The tachycardia was significantly suppressed by propranolol. Administration of PGI2 either to the donor dog or directly into the sinus node arterial cannula did not alter the atrial rate or developed tension in the isolated blood perfused atrial preparation. In contrast, when PGE2 was given in larger doses (10 microgram/kg) to the donor dog, the sinus rate and developed tension in the isolated atria were increased. This effect was markedly diminished after propranolol treatment. Administration of PGE2 (1-30 microgram) close-arterially into the sinus node artery produced positive chronotropic and inotropic effect which was not statistically significant. We conclude that PGI2 and PGE2 produce a negative chronotropic effect which is due to increased vagal activity and that these agents have no direct cardiac stimulatory effects in the anesthetized dog.", 
    "19": "Blood-brain barrier permeability studies made in man using the indicator dilution method revealed that the extraction of the test substance increases during the upslope of the venous (outflow) dilution curve. The present study aimed to obviate the possibility that this could result from intravascular phenomena, such as interlaminar diffusion (the result of differences in molecular size) and erythrocyte carriage. Several reference substances were employed for the determination of the extraction in order that careful correction could be made for differences in intravascular behavior of the test and reference substance. The test substances studied were D-glucose, L-phenylalanine, water, propranolol, and benzodiazepines, representing both carrier-transported and lipophilic substances. In-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid, Na+, Cl-, L-glucose, and L-lysine were employed as reference substances. For all the substances tested, and after correction for intravascular phenomena, the extractions were found to increase during the initial part of the dilution curve. This increasing extraction can be ascribed to heterogeneity of the cerebral circulation; the higher extraction corresponds to longer contact with the blood-brain barrier and indicates a longer transit time. Signs of heterogeneity were also present when blood flow was elevated above normal. Any influence that heterogeneity might have on the mean extraction value can be minimized by using an appropriate calculation of the extraction of the test substance.", 
    "20": "Over a 9-month period, the incidence and characteristics of hypertension following coronary artery bypass surgery were studied in a group of 52 patients. Hypertension occurred in 61% of the patients and was characterized by an increase in arterial blood pressure of 35 +/- 2 mm Hg mean +/- SEM during the early postoperative period. Preoperative blood pressures and hemodynamic variables were similar in those who developed hypertension of those who remained normotensive. Ninety-four percent of those who developed hypertension as compared to only 40% of those who remained normotensive received propranolol during the 24 hours preceding surgery (x2 = 15.4; p less than 0.001). Maximal blood pressures during the first 5 hours following the termination of cardiopulmonary bypass were significantly positively correlated with preoperative propranolol dosage (p less than 0.01). Hypertension was not associated with significant changes in plasma renin activity or angiotensin II levels, but concomitant plasma catecholamine concentrations were elevated significantly (p less than 0.005). However, a similar rise in plasma catecholamine concentrations was found in those who remained normotensive. Hypertension was associated with an increase in systemic vascular resistance (p less than 0.001) and left ventricular stroke work index (p less than 0.05), and a fall in stroke volume (p less than 0.005) and cardiac index (p less than 0.001). These studies suggest that hypertension following coronary artery bypass surgery is common, results from an increase in systemic vascular resistance, is not renin-angiotensin mediated, and may, in part, be related to preoperative propranolol administration.", 
    "21": "Ammonium vanadate (NH4VO3; 50-1000 microM) increases the force of contraction of isolated electrically driven cat papillary muscles in a concentration-dependent manner. The positive inotropic effect (PIE) of NH4VO3 became significant at 50 microM and was maximal at 500 to 1000 microM. It was accompanied by an increase in the rate of force development, in the rate of relaxation and in relaxation time of the isometric contraction. Similar results as with NH4VO3 were also observed in the presence of 1 microM propranolol, 5 microM phentolamine or after reserpine-pretreatment (5 mg/kg i.p.). These results indicate that vanadate produces a direct PIT in ventricular cardiac muscle which is unlikely to be mediated by alpha- or beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. In cat left atrial strips, however, vanadate ions produced a negative inotropic effect through a hitherto unknown mechanism. Vanadate effects similar to those observed in the cat heart were obtained in ventricular and atrial preparations from bovine hearts.", 
    "22": "Neither propranolol (80 mg) nor metoprolol (100 mg) give orally to eight normal subjects altered mean ventilatory responses to carbon dioxide or to moderate graded exercise. Incremental doses of the drugs to totals of 320 mg propranolol and 400 mg metoprolol also did not effect these ventilatory responses. Both drugs markedly decreased the heart rate response to exercise. Neither propranolol nor metoprolol are likely to cause CO2 retention by an effect on the ventilatory responses to inhaled carbon dioxide or to exercise.", 
    "23": "1 The effects were studied of the beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, (+/-)-propranolol and its (+)- and (-)-isomers on contractility of rat isolated diaphragm and inferior rectus muscles. 2 Propranolol (10(-5) M) did not modify the resting tension nor the electrically-induced twitch contraction in diaphragm and extraocular muscles, nor the tonic tension evoked in the latter by high K concentrations. 3 In inferior rectus preparations (+/-)-propranolol (5 x 10(-6) M) reduced significantly tensions evoked by succinylcholine (SCh). Cumulative dose-response curves to SCh were shifted to the right in a nearly parallel manner by (+)- and (-)-propranolol which were about equiactive. 4 It is concluded that the depressant action of propranolol is independent of its adrenoceptor blocking potency and it is not due to an alteration of the contraction mechanism. Propranolol appears to depress SCh-evoked tensions through a curare-like effect on cholinoceptors.", 
    "24": "The soleus, a slow-contracting, and the extensor digitorum longus (EDL), a fast-contracting skeletal muscle from guinea-pig were prepared for isometric recording of sub-tetanic contractions in vitro. The contents of adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) and creatinephosphate (CP) together with their metabolites and the contents of lactate, pyruvate and cyclic adenosine-monophosphate (c-AMP) in the muscles were determined. It was found that the energy and redox state of the isolated soleus and EDL muscles is very stable and does not significantly differ from the normal state in vivo. Moreover, there were no consistent changes in these variables after treatment with terbutaline (a beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist) or propranolol or both. Thus, effects on energy metabolism do not seem to cause the changes in muscle contraction, characteristic for beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. On the other hand, the functional effects were accompanied by elevation of the c-AMP level of the muscles.", 
    "25": "The effects of dihydroxy bile acids on intestinal cyclic nucleotides, Na+-K+-ATPase, and net secretion, and of propranolol pretreatment on these actions were determined. Ileal and colonic loops were constructed in each of 12 rabbits, six of which were treated with propranolol preoperatively. In random order, normal saline, 6mM deoxycholic, chenodeoxycholic, or ursodeoxycholic acids were injected into the intestinal loops. Five hours after, net luminal secretion and mucosal adenylate cyclase, phosphodiesterase, cGMP, and Na+-K+-ATPase were determined. Deoxycholic and chenodeoxycholic acids each increased adenylate cyclase activity (< 0.01) and net secretion (p < 0.01), and decreased cGMP (p < 0.05). Ursodeoxycholic acid did not alter adenylate cyclase activity or secretion but increased cGMP (p < 0.05). Phosphodiesterase and Na+-K+-ATPase were unchanged. Propranolol reversed all of the bile acid effects. In conclusion, chenodeoxycholic and deoxycholic acid induce net intestinal secretion, probably via cAMP. Ursodeoxycholic acid does not affect cAMP but increases cGMP and does not promote net secretion.", 
    "26": "Propranolol blood levels and the effect of these levels on hemodynamic parameters were evaluated in 25 patients with coronary artery disease undergoing cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography. Fifteen patients were receiving high doses of propranolol (320--1920 mg/day) while ten patients were receiving conventional doses (80--240 mg/day). The high dose propranolol group had significantly higher plasma propranolol levels than the conventional dose group (788 +/- 134 SD vs. 43 +/- 7.2 ng/ml SD), and there was a direct linear relationship between propranolol dose and plasma drug levels (r = 0.85, P < 0.001). There were no significant differences between high and conventional dose propranolol groups in terms of all hemodynamic parameters measured, namely ejection fraction, ventricular volume, cardiac index, or peripheral vascular resistance. Despite high drug dosage and blood levels, only mild side effects were seen.", 
    "27": "Because the mechanism of adverse reactions to abrupt cessation of propranolol in patients with coronary heart disease was an enigma, we studied the effect of cessation of propranolol on beta-adrenergic receptor reactivity to catecholamine stimulation. The cyclic AMP concentrations in plasma and left ventricular muscle after the administration of isoproterenol (5 mg/Kg) were measured in rats before, during, 2 days after, and 4 days after of the administration of propranolol (5 mg/Kg). Two days after withdrawal from propranolol, the cyclic AMP concentrations in plasma and left ventricular muscle were significantly increased (p less than 0.005, p less than 0.01). Four days after withdrawal from propranolol, the cyclic AMP concentration in plasma was significantly increased (p less than 0.001). On the other hand, that of left ventricular muscle showed a tendency to have higher value, although, this was statistically not significant. From these results, this study suports that there is a hypersensitivity to adrenergic stimultion after abrupt cessation of long-term propranolol treatment. The explanation of propranolol withdrawal phenomenon most likely lies in lthe nature of beta adrenergic receptors that become activated during long-term blockade.", 
    "28": "The sexual cycle ceases in rats with alloxan diabetes. Chronic administration of phentolamine promoted interruption of the sexual cycle while obsidan was conducive to its preservation in part of the animals. Most diabetic rats both given and not given adrenoblockers showed the complete absence of compensatory hypertrophy of the ovary (CHO). As shown by the analysis, the content of gonadotropins in the pituitary glands of diabetic rats was increased, with the response to chorionic gonadotropin being close to normal. It is suggested that the absence of CHO in most diabetic rats can be accounted for by the fact that after removal of one ovary the hypothalamohypophyseal system does not secrete gonadotropins in adequate amounts.", 
    "29": "In the normal adrenal cell, epinephrine does not activate the rise of either cGMP or cAMP concentrations. In contrast, epinephrine activates the rise of cGMP but not cAMP concentrations in a concentration-dependent manner in isolated adrenocortical carcinoma cells. This effect was duplicated by the alpha-adrenergic agonist, phenylepherine, but was unaffected by the beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol. The epinephrine-activated increase in cGMP was blocked by the alpha-adrenergic antagonist, phentolamine, but was not interfered with by the beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol. Neither acetylcholine, a cholinergic agonist, nor exogenous calcium caused any increase in cGMP. The rise of cGMP maximally activated by ACTH was additive with that obtained with epinephrine. These results indicate that the adrenal neoplastic cell possesses ectopic alpha-adrenergic receptors, and that epinephrine causes a rise of the cGMP level through these receptors. The data, furthermore, suggest that the receptors for ACTH and epinephrine are distinct.", 
    "30": "Soluble TSH receptors were released into the medium when bovine thyroid plasma membranes were incubated in 0.01 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 0 or 20 C. This is a conventional hypotonic medium used in binding assays. The characteristics of binding of bovine [125I]TSH to the released TSH receptor were almost the same as those of binding to TSH receptors solubilized by lithium 3,5-diiodosalicylate or to the original plasma membrane. Released TSH receptor had two binding sites with Ka values of 0.7 x 10(10) and 0.1 x 10(8) M-1. T3, T4, KI, methimazole, and propylthiouracil had no effect on spontaneous TSH receptor release or on bovine [125I]TSH binding to solubilized TSH receptor. Hydrocortisone (10(-5)--10(-3) M) and d,l-propranolol (10(-3) M) inhibited receptor release. cAMP increased the release of TSH receptor. Hydrocortisone, d,l-propranolol, and cAMP had no effect on bovine [125I]TSH binding to solubilized or released TSH receptor. d,l-Propranolol and hydrocortisone may act as membrane-stabilizing agents. cAMP stimulation of release suggests that the release mechanism could depend upon a protein kinase-phosphoprotein system. Although these studies were conducted with membranes in an unphysiological medium, receptor release may occur normally and could be a source of circulating antigen related to production of antireceptor antibody in autoimmune thyroid diseases. Release of receptors during incubation in vitro may affect the results of studies of hormone-receptor interaction.", 
    "31": "Using a continuous superfusion system of rat kidney cortical slices, we investigated the renin-releasing effect of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and its possible mechanism of action. PGE2 caused significant stimulation of renin release in a dose-dependent fashion at concentrations of 3 x 10(-6) to 10(-4) M. Isoproterenol (8 x 10(-7) M) stimulated renin release significantly, and its effect was completely abolished by propranolol (2 x 10(-5) M). PGE2-stimulated renin release was not blocked by the same dose of propranolol. Dibutyryl cAMP caused a dose-dependent increase in renin release at concentrations of 10(-5) to 5 x 10(-3) M. Theophylline (4 x 10(-3) M) had no effect on renin release, but when added to subthreshold doses of PGE2 (10(-6) M), it stimulated renin release significantly. The simultaneous addition of maximal stimulating doses of PGE2 and dibutyryl cAMP had no additive or synergistic effects. These experiments show that PGE2 causes stimulation of renin release by a direct effect on the JG cell. The renin-releasing effect of PGE2 does not depend upon the beta-adrenergic receptors but may be mediated through cAMP.", 
    "32": "Field stimulation produced in isolated guinea-pig left atria a positive inotropic response, which was highly sensitive to the inhibitory actions of lidocaine, tetrodotoxin, and of pindolol. The field-stimulus effect was enhanced by angiotensin and by bradykinin, but not by substance P. Only bradykinin exerted also a direct positive inotropic effect (in the absence of field stimulation). It is concluded that the intramural adrenergic neurons of the guinea-pig atrium have receptors for both angiotensin and bradykinin, but not for substance P.", 
    "33": "The effect of amitriptyline that leads to ventricular tachycardia was evaluated by the repetitive extrasystole threshold (RET) technique in 18 dogs. The RET was 28.8 +/- 7.9 mamp before and 8.2 +/- 5.3 mamp after amitriptyline, p less than 0.001. Physostigmine, propranolol, sodium bicarbonate, and left stellate ganglionectomy reversed the effect of amitriptyline on RET. We conclude that amitriptyline overdose predisposes to sudden death by lowering the ventricular fibrillation threshold. This cardiotoxic effect is mediated partly through the central nervous system and can be inhibited by increased plasma binding (bicarbonate), cholinergic stimulation (physostigmine), beta adrenergic blockade (propranolol), and sympathetic denervation (left stellate ganglionectomy).", 
    "34": "Effects of labetalol on the cardiovascular system were studied in dogs, guinea pigs, rats, rabbits, and bullfrogs. In dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital, labetalol decreased heart rate, arterial blood pressure, and myocardial contractile force, and inhibited carotid sinus reflex, without affecting pO2 and pH of circulating blood, urine volume, and urinary excretion of sodium and potassium. Alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking action of labetalol was demonstrated in dog hearts, arterial preparations of guinea pigs and rats, isolated rabbit hearts, and bullfrog hind limb and rabbit ear preparations. In bullfrog hind limb and rabbit ear preparations, labetalol dilated blood vessels in concentrations larger than those which produced alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade. The dilatation of blood vessels was observed only when labetalol was added to the perfusate, whereas alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade continued even after removal of labetalol from the perfusate. It is concluded that labetalol blocks alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart and blood vessels of the species used herein, and that this compound inhibits carotid sinus reflex in dogs. In addition, the dilatation of the blood vessels of the bullfrog hind limb and rabbit ear as evoked by labetalol probably involves a mechanism different from that of adrenergic blockade.", 
    "35": "This paper will discuss the pharmacology and mechanism of action of various drugs used to treat glaucoma, such as epinephrine, pilocarpine, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and a new class of drugs to be used in ophthalmology, the beta adrenergic blockers, with particular reference to timolol.", 
    "36": "A radioreceptor assay (RRA) recently developed in this laboratory for beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in plasma was evaluated in normal volunteers and compared with a radioimmunoassay (RIA) for propranolol. The RRA depends upon the ability of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists to complete with a radiolabelled ligand for beta-adrenoceptor binding sites on lung membranes. Unlike other assays, it measures biologically active drugs including active metabolites of the parent compound. In volunteers given a single oral dose of (+/-)-propranolol, considerable differences between the two assay methods were demonstrated. In other experiments this difference was shown to relate to the RIA's sensitivity to the inactive (+)-isomer of propranolol and possibly to inactive metabolites. The facility of the RRA in measuring plasma levels of several other non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists was also demonstrated. By employing (-)-propranolol as the standard in the RRA, all of these drugs can be directly compared with a single and relatively simple assay technique.", 
    "37": "1. In cats under chloralose anaesthesia micro-electrodes were inserted into parotid gland cells. 2. The average resting potential was found to be -35 . 6 +/- 4 . 7 (S.D.) mV. 3. Stimulation of the auriculo-temporal nerve caused hyperpolarizing, or occasionally depolarizing, secretory potentials of 5--10 mV, which were abolishable with atropine. 4. Stimulation of the cervical sympathetic trunk regularly caused, after long latency (several seconds), slow depolarizations of 15--20 mV, accompanied by a decrease in input resistance. They were antagonized by practolol and therefore assumed to be mediated by beta 1-adrenoceptors. Occasionally hyperpolarization, ascribed to an effect on alpha-adrenoceptors, was observed. 5. In many units the slow depolarization on sympathetic stimulation was preceded by short-lasting hyperpolarizing (sometimes depolarizing) transients. They resembled the evoked cholinergic responses but could be abolished not only by atropine but also by guanethidine.", 
    "38": "When anesthetized rats were exposed to microwave (power output 1.3 kw, frequency 2,450 MHz), the cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity showed a rapid decline in the skeletal muscle, heart, trachea and lung; no activity essentially could be detected after a 30 sec irradiation. Cyclic AMP levels in these tissues also decreased rapidly to constant values within 30 sec. Concentrations of cyclic AMP in the heart, skeletal muscle, trachea and lung measured by the tissue fixation with liquid nitrogen were approximately 3, 3, 4 and 4 times higher than those after microwave irradiation, respectively. The intravenous injection of procaterol (1 mu mol/kg), a beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, caused a 6-fold increase in the trachea cyclic AMP level when measured after microwave fixation but only a 2-fold increase when measured after liquid nitrogen fixation. It is concluded that rapid tissue fixation by microwave irradiation may provide a useful means for obtaining reliable values of the tissue cyclic AMP content.", 
    "39": "A rapid method for the estimation of perhexiline in serum is presented. The procedure employs a single extraction, and no derivatisation is required. The procedure is linear over the range 0.4-4.0 mg/l, and the limit of detection is 0.09 mg/l. The within- and between-batch coefficients of variation at a concentration of 2.0 mg/l were 2.5 and 4.1%, respectively. Recoveries over the range 0.4-4.0 mg/l produced a mean of 104%. The method is free from interference by other common drugs used in the treatment of angina.", 
    "40": "It has been shown in experiments on rabbits that alpha-and beta-adrenoblockers, and lithium chloride solution exert different effect on intraocular tension of healthy animals with experimental glaucoma and transitory hypertension. The beta-blockker obsidan decreases the tension in experimental glaucoma. Pretreatment with the drug prevents the development of glaucoma. On the contrary, the alpha-blocker pirroxan promotes the development of glaucoma and does not elicit any hypotensive therapeutic effect. The drug-induced decrease in intraocular tension was recorded in healthy animals and in rabbits with transitory hypertensin of the eye. The hypotensive effect of lithium was noted only in the animals with experimental glaucoma. The role of alpha-and beta-adrenergic receiption in the pathogenesis of glaucoma is discussed.", 
    "41": "The role of the hypothalamic beta-adrenoceptors in the depressor response and bradycardia induced by stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus was studied in cats. In chloralose and urethane anaesthetized cats the anterior hypothalamus was superfused with artifical cerebrospinal fluid through a push-pull cannula. Electrical stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus with the tip of the cannula elicited a fall of systemic blood pressure and a decrease in heart rate. Superfusion of the anterior hypothalamus with isoprenaline did not change the depressor response and bradycardia induced by electrical stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus. Superfusion with atenolol or butoxamine also failed to modify the responses. Superfusion with (+/-)-propranolol significantly suppressed the responses. However, superfusion with (+)-propranolol suppressed the responses to the same extent. The resting systemic blood pressure and heart rate were not significantly changed by superfusion of the hypothalamus with these drugs. These results suggest that beta-adrenoceptors of the anterior hypothalamus are not involved in the depressor response and bradycardia elicited by hypothalamic stimulation.", 
    "42": "The pathogenesis of experimental adrenal hemorrhagic necrosis produced by acrylonitrile in the rat was investigated by various morphologic, biochemical, and pharmacologic methods. One dose of this chemical injected intravenously caused 100 per cent incidence of adrenal hemorrhage and necrosis in 90 to 120 minutes. Electron microscopy, histochemistry, and light microscopy combined with colloidal carbon labeling suggested an early damage (30 minutes after administration of acrylonitrile) to the vascular endothelium in the adrenal cortex, prominent at 60 minutes, when lesion to the parenchymal cells was not visible. The use of extracellular diffusion tracer horseradish peroxidase further indicated that parenchymal cell injury was a late event. Damage to the vascular endothelium in the adrenal cortex was associated with retrograde embolization of medullary cells and cell fragments into the cortical capillaries. The ultrastructurally demonstrated platelet aggregation and fibrin precipitation at the sites of discontinuous vascular endothelium were accompanied by a decrease in circulating platelets and fibrinogen as well as prolongation of prothrombin, partial thromboplastin, and thrombin time. The concentration of dopamine, unlike that of noradrenaline, in the adrenals but not in the brain of rats injected with acrylonitrile showed a time-dependent elevation. Pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine (alpha-adrenergic antagonist) or labetalol (alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocker) or metyrapone (11-beta-hydroxylase inhibitor) and the depletion of catecholamines by reserpine or prior medullectomy prevented the chemically induced adrenal necrosis. These results indicate that the presence of a functional adrenal cortex is necessary for the development of cortical damage which is associated with early vascular lesion caused and/or modulated by vasoactive amines from the medulla and/or (metabolites of) acrylonitrile.", 
    "43": "We have previously shown that the hamster sperm acrosome reaction, an event essential for fertilization, is stimulated by beta-adrenergic agonists and inhibited by beta-adrenergic antagonists. In the present report, we describe attempts to use (+/-)-9-aminoacridylpropranolol (9-AAP), a fluorescent derivative of a potent beta-adrenergic antagonist, to microscopically detect beta-adrenergic receptors on cauda epididymal hamster spermatozoa in vitro. 9-AAP binding to washed hamster spermatozoa was localized primarily in the acrosomal region, but we were unable to consistently displace the 9-AAP with the biologically active (-)-stereoisomers of several beta-adrenertic agonists and antagonists. Such displacement is necessary in order to separate binding to receptors from \"nonspecific binding.\" Thus we did not detect sperm beta-adrenertic receptors by this method. Failure to detect the receptors with 9-AAP may be due to their presence in numbers too low for detection by this compound or to the masking of the receptors in these uncapacitated sperm. However, we could displace 9-AAP with either 5.0 mM NH4Cl or 1.2 microgram/ml nigericin, compounds capable of discharging pH gradients across cell membranes. These compounds have also been previously reported to displace the fluorescent portion of 9-AAP, 9-aminoacridine from the acrosome by such mechanism. The present results suggest that 9-AAP fluorescence does not always represent binding to beta-adrenergic receptors or \"nonspecific binding,\" but may also represent the concentration of 9-AAP in acidic compartments within a cell.", 
    "44": "1 The effects of (+) and (+/-)-propranolol, pindolol, alprenolol, practolol, acebutolol and bretylium were studied on the turnover rate of noradrenaline in heart and spleen of rats. 2 Bretylium (8 mg/kg) greatly reduced the turnover rate of noradrenaline in both organs. 3 (+)-Propranolol (4 and 10 mg/kg) also diminished the turnover rate of noradrenaline, but its effects were smaller than those of (+/-)-propranolol (4 and 10 mg/kg). 4 Pindolol (300 micrograms/kg) greatly increased the turnover rate of noradrenaline; this effect was especially important in the spleen. 5 Alprenolol (4 and 10 mg/kg) acebutolol (20 and 40 mg/kg) practolol (10 mg/kg) did not produce any significant change. 6 These effects are compatible with the view that beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents may affect noradrenaline release in different manners: anaesthetic properties of some of these drugs and blockade of beta 2 prejunctional adrenoceptors produce a diminished release of transmitter, whereas the intrinsic sympathomimetic action of pindolol causes the opposite effect.", 
    "45": "Types of beta-adrenoceptors mediating renin release induced by isoproterenol were investigated in conscious dogs. The nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs propranolol, D-32, and pindolol significantly inhibited increases in heart rate and plasma renin activity and a fall of blood pressure produced by intravenous infusion of isoproterenol (10 microgram . kg-1 . 20 min-1). d-Propranolol and d-D-32 did not inhibit these three responses to isoproterenol. The selective beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking drug atenolol, at the oral dose of 6 mg/kg, which selectively suppressed isoproterenol-induced tachycardia, significantly inhibited the renin release caused by isoproterenol. By contrast, the renin release induced by isoproterenol was not modified by the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor blocking drug IPS-339 at an oral dose of 3 mg/kg, which fully and selectively antagonized the fall of blood pressure in response to isoproterenol. There was good correlation between suppression of isoproterenol-induced renin release and that of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia after various beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs. These results lead to the conclusion that in conscious dogs the beta-adrenoceptors mediating release are mainly of the beta 1 type.", 
    "46": "Six radiolabeled beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents with a range of affinity constants were evaluated as radioindicators for adrenoceptors in guinea-pig heart and lung. All concentrated in the heart and lung at levels in excess of 0.1% dose/g tissue. On the basis of displacement studies using propranolol, two of the six compounds showed beta-adrenoceptor binding in the lung, and one, H-3 carazolol, showed receptor binding in the heart. These results agree qualitatively with a bi-molecular reversible equilibrium model, and suggest that the beta-adrenoceptor blockers as a group will not be useful in vivo probes of receptor concentration in the heart because of the low affinity constants and high levels of nonreceptor binding associated with the present-day clinical beta blockers. Beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents with affinity constants in excess of 10(9) will be needed to give heart-to-blood ratios of 10.", 
    "47": "The possibility has been investigated that propranolol administration could alter bronchial reactivity to methacholine and histamine in monkeys (Macaca fuscata and Macaca fascicularis). The impedance of the total respiratory system was measured by the forced 3-HZ oscillation method through an endotracheal tube. Methacholine and histamine dose-dependently increased the impedance in monkeys irrespective of the route of administration (inhalation of aerosol or intravenous injection). Propranolol treatment increased the bronchial response to intravenously injected methacholine and caused no significant change in the bronchial response to aerosolized methacholine. No marked difference was observed in the bronchial response to histamine due to treatment with propranolol regardless of whether administered by intravenous injection or aerosol challenge.", 
    "48": "Three randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover experimental designs were used to define a suitable interdose interval and to study the adequacy of once-daily administration for applications in preventive trials on manifest or latent ischemic patients. Suppression of exercise tachycardia was used as the major effect variable. All measurements were made at different intervals after the last dose when the healthy subjects had been treated for at least 1 wk. Reductions of exercise tachycardia were found 24 hr after the last dose for atenolol, metoprolol, penbutolol, pindolol, propranolol, sotalol, and timolol. Penbutolol and propranolol induced equal reduction of exercise tachycardia at the end of the dose interval regardless of whether the total daily dose was given once daily or divided in 2 daily doses. Atenolol and sotalol, both with long half-lifes (t1/2s), were not superior to other beta blockers. Neither were slow-release preparations of metoprolol and propranolol markedly more effective 24 hr after the preparation than after ordinary tablets. Plasma concentration-time patterns after slow-release preparations may be important in patients with adverse experiences during peak plasma levels after conventional tablets.", 
    "49": "In a double-blind crossover study, it has been shown that the hypotensive response to propranolol in 24 patients with essential hypertension was no greater at doses of 80, 160, or 240 mg twice daily than at 40 mg twice daily. A relationship was observed between dose and response as defined by the ability to achieve a standing diastolic blood pressure of 95 mm Hg. Four patients with low plasma renin activity (PRA) had no fall in blood pressure even at highest dose levels. Plasma propranolol levels in the groups were related to dose, and up to a concentration of 300 ng/ml, with degree of beta-adrenoceptor blockade; there was, however, no correlation with hypotensive response.", 
    "50": "Abrupt withdrawal after the chronic administration of propranolol has resulted in clinical syndromes that suggest adrenergic hypersensitivity. The effect of propranolol administration and withdrawal on beta-adrenergic receptors was studied in human lymphocyte membranes. Receptor density was quantitated by direct binding assays with the radioligand [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol. Administration of propranolol (160 mg/d) for 8 d resulted in trough plasma levels of approximately 35 ng/ml. By day 5 of propranolol administration the density of beta-adrenergic receptors had increased 43 +/- 4% (P less than 0.01) above pretreatment levels. Abrupt withdrawal of propranolol was followed by the disappearance of propranolol from the plasma within 24 h. The density of beta-adrenergic receptors did not return to pretreatment level for several days. Physiologic supersensitivity of beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated responses was suggested by the appearance of significant increases in the orthostatic change in heart rate (P less than 0.05) and the orthostatic change in the heart rate-systolic blood pressure product (P less than 0.01) during the first 48 h after propranolol withdrawal. These data show that propranolol administration leads to an increase in the density of beta-adrenergic receptors in human tissue. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that some of the untoward effects observed after abrupt discontinuation of propranolol are caused by beta-receptor-mediated adrenergic hypersensitivity.", 
    "51": "Organ uptake of 125I-hydroxybenzylpindolol, a potent beta adrenergic antagonist, was determined after intravenous administration. Pretreatment with the beta agonist, epinephrine, inhibited an almost identical fraction of 125I-hydroxybenzylpindolol binding as did the antagonist, propranolol. Specific beta receptor binding accounted for 50% of total uptake in the lung and demonstrated the following characteristics. The dose-response curve for propranolol inhibition of 125I-hydroxybenzylpindolol binding duplicated that reported for its physiologic action. Simultaneous serum propranolol levels as determined by a sensitive radioimmunoassay allowed an apparent dissociation rate constant approximately 7 nM to be obtained that correlated closely with the results reported from membrane binding studies. Alpha blockade had no effect and inhibition of 125I-hydroxybenzylpindolol binding by propranolol demonstrated stereospecificity. After chemical sympathectomy with reserpine or 6-OH dopamine, there was a 100% increase in receptor specific binding. Finally, a scintillation camera was employed to visually and quantitatively detect 125I-hydroxybenzylpindolol displacement from the lung during intravenous propranolol administration in the living animal. Reversal of binding was rapid and an in vivo inhibition curve was generated. Such a method provides the potential for longitudinally assessing beta receptor occupancy and apparent affinity directly in man.", 
    "52": "Recent studies in man have shown a decrease in serum L-T3 (T3) levels in subjects treated with DL-propranolol, but the mechanism of this effect is unknown. Isolated rat renal tubules were used to study the effect of propranolol and related drugs on the formation of T3 from L-T4 (T4). Racemic (DL) propranolol at 100 microM inhibited the net formation of T3 from T4 by 35% (P less than 0.01). The D- and L-isomers of propranolol were also potent in inhibiting T3 formation, but the beta-blockers atenolol and sotalol, which have no significant membrane-stabilizing activity, had no effect at similar concentrations. Quinidine inhibited T3 formation, with a dose-response curve which was similar over the concentrations studied to that of DL-propranolol. L-Epinephrine and L-isoproterenol had no effect on T3 formation, and equimolar amounts of L-isoproterenol did not prevent the inhibition of T3 formation by DL-propranolol. cAMP production was stimulated by 200 micro M L-isoproterenol, and this was blocked by an equimolar concentration of DL-propranolol but not of D-propranolol. It is concluded that DL-propranolol directly inhibits net T3 formation from T4 in this system by a direct membrane-stabilizing or quinidine-like action and not by specific beta-blockade.", 
    "53": "The development of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors was studied in rat cerebral cortex and cerebellum. In the cerebral cortex, which contains mostly beta 1-adrenergic receptors, total beta-adrenergic receptor density increased sharply between postnatal days 10 and 21. The density of receptors remained fairly constant through 6 weeks of age and then subsequently declined. The proportion of beta 1 and beta 2 receptors was relatively constant throughout the development of the cerebral cortex. The development of the two receptor subtypes thus paralleled the development of total beta-adrenergic receptors in the cerebral cortex. The ontogeny of beta-adrenergic receptors in the cerebellum, which contains mainly beta 2 receptors, was strikingly different from that observed in the cortex. Total cerebellar beta receptor density exhibited a slow but steady increase from postnatal day 5 through day 42. The density of receptors then plateaued and remained constant until the animals were approximately 6 months of age. Unlike the results obtained in the cortex, the relative proportions of beta 1 and beta 2 receptors in the cerebellum changed markedly during development. Between postnatal days 8 and 13 approximately 18% of the receptors were of the beta 1 subtype. This proportion steadily decreased with age, and in 3- and 6-month-old animals only approximately 2% of the receptors were of the beta 1 subtype. The results demonstrate that the two subtypes of beta-adrenergic receptors can have different developmental patterns in the same brain area, and that a single receptor subtype can follow different developmental patterns in different brain regions. Possible correlations between the ontogeny of beta 1 and beta 2 receptors and various developmental events are discussed.", 
    "54": "Twenty-five male patients aged 21 - 65 years and with supine diastolic arterial pressures of 96 - 120 mmHg entered an open, controlled cross-over study, in which the effects of single daily doses of sotalol and atenolol were compared. Data collected indicate that moderately elevated blood pressure is effectively controlled for 24 hours by single daily doses of both beta-blockers (sotalol 160 - 800 mg and atenolol 100 - 500 mg). No important side-effects occurred.", 
    "55": "This study was undertaken to examine the elimination of orally administered acebutolol and its major acetyl metabolite in four healthy controls and seven patients with varying degrees of renal functional impairment. Analysis of acebutolol and its metabolites was undertaken using a high performance liquid chromatographic method. Plasma concentrations of acebutolol and the acetyl metabolite were greater in patients with renal functional impairment than in controls. The elimination of acebutolol did not appear to be influenced by impaired renal function. However the elimination of the acetyl metabolite decreased as renal function diminished. Acebutolol has a major non-renal route of elimination, but the acetyl metabolite (also a beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drug) is primarily excreted by the kidney and may accumulate in renal failure."
