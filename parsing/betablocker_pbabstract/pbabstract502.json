Since 1983, wide-scale experimental work has been done at A.N. Bakulev Institute of Cardiovascular Surgery, USSR Academy of Medical Sciences, which has formed the basis for transluminal laser angioplasty (vascular recanalisation with high-intensity laser beam), laser atherolysis (regression of atherosclerotic formations under low-intensity laser beam), and their combinations. Clinical application of these procedures was started in 1985. Sixty-two patients with ischaemic heart disease, Takayasu's and Leriche's syndromes, chronic occlusion of pelvic and lower-limb arteries, and with combined lesions of the arterial bed were exposed to targeted transluminal laser. Laser endovascular therapy alone and in combination with balloon angioplasty or bypass surgery was used. Application of these methods showed their high efficacy. Successful recanalisation and restoration of adequate flow (confirmed by Doppler echography and angiography) were achieved in 93 per cent cases; results were poor (no effect, complications) in 7 per cent cases.", 
    "1": "Topical beta blockers are used to treat glaucoma patients. These drugs inhibit aqueous production for prolonged periods of time. The purpose of this study was to determine whether timolol maleate (a non-specific beta blocker) binds to human iris-ciliary body (CB) melanin and to elucidate the binding characteristics of the drug to melanin. Timolol bound to bovine iris and ciliary body by two possible mechanisms. The binding kinetics indicate that the binding is probably of a nonspecific nature. There was no statistically significant differences between the melanotic tissues (CB, iris) and the nonmelanotic tissues (lens, cornea, liver, kidney) regarding the amount of timolol bound. However significantly more timolol was bound to the isolated melanins than the whole tissues. Timolol was released from the nonmelanotic tissues at a much faster rate than from the melanotic tissues. The amount of timolol bound to iris-CB from albino and pigmented rabbits showed that the amount of timolol bound to these tissues diminished in the following order: black or gray greater than brown greater than albino. It was also found that the rate of timolol release decreased in the following order: albino greater than gray greater than brown or black. Our results demonstrate the binding of beta blocker to human, bovine and rabbit iris-CB and consequent slow release of timolol from these tissues.", 
    "2": "L-timolol has been used successfully in the treatment of glaucoma. Because of its powerful beta blocking activity, however, more and more side effects have been reported. D-timolol, an optic isomer of L-timolol with much less beta blocking activity, was noted to have similar ocular hypotensive effects through inhibition of aqueous production as L-timolol. Thus, it is expected that D-timolol may reduce the side effects considerably if it is used in the clinics. In this study, we observed the ocular hypotensive effect of 0.5% D-timolol in normotensive and water-loaded rabbits as well as in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. A significant reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) which lasted at least six hours was observed. No side effects, either locally or systemically, were found. The concentration of D-timolol was traced in rabbits' aqueous humor after topical administration. The drug quickly appeared in the aqueous 30 minutes after instillation of 100 microliters 1% D-timolol. The peak concentration was 1916.5 ng/ml. It declined to a minimum in four hours, although the hypotensive effect could last at least six hours. For estimating the beta blocking potency of D-timolol, radioligand binding assay was employed to calculate the Ki value from isolated cell membrane of rabbits' lung. It showed that the beta blocking potency of D-timolol was much less than that obtained from L-timolol. It is concluded that D-timolol may be a valuable antiglaucoma agent comparable to L-timolol in lowering the IOP. The side effects induced by beta blocking agents we are using currently might be considerably reduced with D-timolol.", 
    "3": "The effects of a short-term application of various beta-adrenolytic drugs on heart rate and on the changes in subperiods of left ventricle contraction have been studied in 71 patients with untreated hyperthyroidism and in 72 patients with simple goiter. The following drugs were used: propranolol, metoprolol, atenolol, pindolol, nadolol and acebutolol. It was found that those betaadrenolytic drugs which have no sympathomimetic action cause a significant decrease in heart rate both in patients with hyperthyroidism and in those with simple goiter. The effect of these drugs on heart rate was not related to the changes in blood serum concentrations of thyroxine and triiodothyronine. None of the drugs tested influenced appreciably the contraction subperiods of left heart ventricle, both in the patients with hyperthyroidism and in those with simple goiter.", 
    "4": "Efflux of serum potassium following succinylcholine was compared in surgical patients undergoing low-dose, long-term beta 1-adrenoceptor or beta 1,2-adrenoceptor blocking therapy and in those receiving neither of these therapies. There were no significant differences in serum potassium concentration prior to, and over a study period of, 2 hours following succinylcholine administration among the three groups of patients.", 
    "5": "beta-Blockers, particularly propranolol, have been shown to be an effective treatment for neuroleptic-induced akathisia (NIA). To examine the relative contribution of beta-1 and beta-2 receptor blockade to the therapeutic effect of propranolol, we studied a beta-1 selective agent (low dose metoprolol) and a beta-2 specific blocker (ICI 118,551). Both agents ameliorated NIA. To further evaluate instruments for quantifying NIA we compared (a) two sets of clinical ratings during the metoprolol study and (b) clinical and electromechanical ratings of NIA during the ICI 118,551 study. The changes in clinical ratings of NIA after metoprolol were similar for most patients; however, the changes in electromechanical and clinical ratings after ICI 118,551 were similar in less than half of the patients studied.", 
    "6": "Radionuclide ventriculography was performed at rest and during transoesophageal pacing on nine anaesthetized baboons (Papio ursinus), alternatively with and without administration of a beta-blocker. Left ventricular volumes, cardiac output, and ejection fraction were determined at each heart rate. A gradual decrease in end-diastolic, end-systolic, and stroke volume followed with increasing heart rate, significantly more pronounced under beta-blockade. Cardiac output and ejection fraction showed no significant changes, although tendencies to increase were observed without beta-blockade. Comparisons of these parameter changes were drawn to those previously observed during the first 5 h of septic shock (E. coli). We conclude that the tachycardia present during this phase of shock is not the only contributory factor to cardiac function changes but that other depressant influences prevail as the added effect of the beta-blocker seems to suggest.", 
    "7": "This overview of the safety and efficacy of the antianginal agent epanolol presents key features of the data from an international trial programme involving 1274 subjects. Additional information on the most frequently occurring possible adverse reactions is drawn from 2506 patients, which includes those in ongoing studies. Pooled analyses show that epanolol is as effective as reference therapies (nifedipine and atenolol), as assessed by work output during exercise tests, and in studies of anginal attack rate or work output during 12 months of treatment there was no evidence of tachyphylaxis with epanolol. Epanolol has a favourable safety profile, which compares well with those for placebo and for active antianginal therapies.", 
    "8": "The concept of quality of life is used to determine clinically relevant aspects of subjective symptoms and well-being, and refined psychometric instruments are now being developed to assess changes in well-being during pharmacological therapy. In order to evaluate general well-being, subjective symptoms and common side effects during cardiovascular therapy, workers at this hospital have designed a quality of life questionnaire. This consists of a generic section for the evaluation of 3 global aspects of well-being (hedonic tone, activity and relaxation) and a specific symptoms section for assessing 21 common side effects of cardiovascular drugs. The test is based on visual analogue scales. This questionnaire was used in a Swedish subsample (n = 211) of the epanolol versus metoprolol study in patients with stable angina pectoris (VISA 1). In this double-blind crossover study, there were no significant differences between epanolol and metoprolol as regards general well-being with this sample size. The frequency of some specific symptoms (fatigue, sleep disturbances, vivid dreams and cold digits) was somewhat lower during epanolol treatment, but the differences did not attain statistical significance.", 
    "9": "Continuous 24-hour ECG monitoring was performed as an additional objective in 87 patients from 5 centres in the VISA 1 study. The aim of the study was to compare the continuous 24-hour ECG recordings before the study and during treatment with epanolol ('Visacor') or metoprolol. Parameters of particular interest were heart rate and premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). Using the Oxford 4000 system with a 5-lead recorder, 24-hour monitoring was carried out on entry to the study (no antianginal therapy was allowed, with the exception of short acting nitrates), and at the end of both treatment periods. Measurements included the total number of heart beats and PVCs and the incidence of bradycardia. 87 patients, of mean age 59 (range 32 to 80) years, were included in the study. 62 patients had evaluable tapes available on both active treatment periods. The mean heart rate during 24 hours was significantly lower with metoprolol compared with epanolol treatment (64 vs 72 beats/min, respectively, p less than 0.001). The total number of PVCs in 24 hours was similar in both treatment groups and not significantly different from the value recorded at entry. The median total duration of bradycardia (heart rate less than 60 beats/min) in 24 hours was significantly (p less than 0.001) less for epanolol (60 minutes) than metoprolol (428 minutes). Plots of the mean hourly heart rates show that during daytime, epanolol was associated with a mean heart rate in between the rate observed without treatment and with metoprolol treatment. At night-time, almost identical values were found in the groups treated with epanolol compared with the non-treatment period, whereas the metoprolol treatment induced significant lower heart rate levels. Thus, it was shown that there was greater heart rate reduction with metoprolol than with epanolol (p less than 0.001), and that there was no heart rate reduction at night with epanolol. No arrhythmogenic effect was seen for either drug.", 
    "10": "The primary aim of this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, crossover study in 529 patients with stable angina pectoris was to compare the tolerability of epanolol, a novel antianginal agent, administered as a single oral daily dose of 200mg, with an oral retard formulation of twice-daily nifedipine 20mg and to determine patient preference (VISA 2). Confirmation of equal efficacy and safety monitoring were secondary aims of the study. Treatment consisted of 4 weeks on each therapy, and at the end of the study each patient was asked to state their treatment preference. 448 patients (85%) answered the preference question. Preliminary analysis of the data showed that 61% of patients preferred epanolol vs 31% who preferred nifedipine (p less than 0.001). Reason for a preference for epanolol were mainly fewer adverse experiences (11% vs. 23% with nifedipine), a general improvement in well-being (16% vs 10% with nifedipine) and a decrease in the number of angina attacks (11% vs 10% with nifedipine). A tolerability questionnaire comprising 43 questions and covering 7 different body systems showed that epanolol had a better profile than nifedipine for the following 7 side effects: poor sleep, abdominal pain, flushing, swollen ankles, palpitations, headache and a general feeling of being unwell. Four patients died during the study; none of the deaths were associated with the study treatment. Treatment with nifedipine resulted in 63 patient withdrawals compared with 31 patient withdrawals during epanolol treatment; there were 5 patient withdrawals from both treatments. The main reasons for withdrawal of patients from nifedipine treatment were adverse events (9% vs 4% with epanolol) and a lack of efficacy (3% vs 2% with epanolol).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "11": "The tolerability of epanolol, a new antianginal agent given as a single daily oral dose of 200mg, has been compared with the oral formulation of metoprolol (100mg twice daily) in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, crossover study in 573 patients with stable angina (VISA 1). Patient preference for treatment was determined and efficacy was also monitored. Four weeks' treatment with one agent was followed by 4 weeks' treatment with the alternative agent. At the end of the study, patients were asked to express a preference, where possible, for 1 of the 2 treatments. The preliminary results of the study show that the preference question was answered by 524 patients (91.9%), and although 30 more patients preferred epanolol (45% preferred metoprolol, 55% preferred epanolol), the trend did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.137). Reasons for preference for epanolol were largely based on patients having fewer adverse effects, with fewer angina attacks and a general improvement in well-being as secondary reasons. Reasons for preference for metoprolol, however, were evenly divided between fewer adverse effects and fewer angina attacks, with a general improvement in well-being of less importance. Responses to a tolerability questionnaire consisting of 43 questions on 7 different body systems showed that epanolol had a significantly better profile than metoprolol for 10 of the side effects, particularly those associated with beta-blocker treatment. Responses to only one question indicated that patients tolerated metoprolol better than epanolol. Two patients died during the study (one on metoprolol treatment and one on epanolol treatment). Neither death was attributed to the study treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "12": "After examination of the epanolol ('Visacor') clinical package it became clear that, although efficacy and safety of epanolol were equivalent to efficacy and safety with other antianginal therapies, tolerability was improved. It was decided to initiate 2 studies with 500 patients in each to quantify the improved tolerability and examine patient preference for antianginal treatments. One study was a comparison of epanolol 200mg daily with metoprolol 100mg twice a day and the other compared epanolol 200mg daily with nifedipine retard 20mg twice a day. The rationale, design and statistical methodology are presented, together with a summary of the geographical spread of the study.", 
    "13": "Some side effects of the beta 1-adrenoceptor blocker atenolol may result from depression of cardiac output at rest. They may, therefore, be reduced by the use of drugs with beta 1-partial agonist activity, such as epanolol. We compared once-daily atenolol 100mg and epanolol 200mg in 20 patients reporting side effects while taking atenolol for chronic stable angina. A double-dummy, double-blind, crossover design was used to assess side effects by use of visual analogue scales and interviews, and antianginal efficacy by treadmill exercise tests and diary cards. In a comparison with atenolol, no significant differences in exercise time (686 +/- 11 seconds vs 685 +/- 10 seconds, maximum ST depression (1.02 +/- 0.09mm vs 1.07 +/- 0.08mm), time to 1mm ST depression (8.4 +/- 1.9 minutes vs 9.0 +/- 2.0 minutes), or days without angina (median 100% in both) were shown. All visual analogue scores were higher with epanolol (subjective energy 58.3 +/- 1.7 vs 54.3 +/- 1.5, well-being 61.8 +/- 1.8 vs 58.6 +/- 1.5 and warmth of extremities 68.4 +/- 3.6 vs 62.0 +/- 3.1). Although these differences did not attain statistical significance, 11 patients expressed a preference for epanolol and only 6 for atenolol. We conclude that, in this study, epanolol is as effective as atenolol as an antianginal agent for chronic stable angina. It improved the side effect profile in some but not all patients.", 
    "14": "Epanolol is a new once-daily agent for the treatment of angina pectoris. This study was conducted in 2 parts. Firstly, a dose-finding study was performed using placebo and epanolol 100, 200, 300 and 400mg to assess the efficacy and safety of the drug. Once-daily epanolol 200mg was an effective dose, significantly reducing angina attack rate and increasing exercise duration and work output. At the same time, an improvement was noted in the patients' well-being and their ability to undertake normal daily activities. The 200mg dose regimen was used in a long term (12 months) assessment of the efficacy and safety of epanolol in the second part of this study. The efficacy of epanolol was clearly maintained throughout the full treatment period without adverse events or withdrawals as a result of treatment. The effectiveness and safety of epanolol are attributed to its selective beta 1-partial agonist activity. At rest, the degree of agonist activity (about 20% of that of isoprenaline) may prevent some of the untoward effects occasionally seen with full beta-blockers. During exercise, the antagonist activity becomes apparent and cardiac ischaemia is reduced.", 
    "15": "Epanolol has been shown in animal models to be a selective beta-adrenoceptor partial agonist with agonist activity about 20 to 25% of that of the full agonist isoprenaline. Evidence is presented in this review supporting the conclusion that epanolol has the same pharmacological properties in man and that the agonist activity at the beta-adrenoceptor is less than the activity present in pindolol, but greater than that present in acebutolol. The pharmacodynamic consequences in man of the degree of agonist activity possessed by the beta 1-selective partial agonist epanolol include little reductions at rest in heart rate, blood pressure, various measures of cardiac haemodynamic parameters, peripheral blood flow and renal function. On exercise there is attenuation of the heart rate and systolic blood pressure responses, with less perceived exertion than with atenolol. Evidence is available which shows that attenuation of the tachycardia of exercise persists for 24 hours after a single dose of epanolol 200mg, a dose which retains selectivity for the beta 1-adrenoceptor. This pharmacological profile of epanolol in man suggests that it would be an effective antianginal agent when 200mg once daily is administered. Moreover, its unique profile (compared with other antianginal agents) may make it more tolerable to patients than existing antianginal therapy.", 
    "16": "Single doses of epanolol (ICI 141,292) were administered to 12 healthy young male volunteers in a randomised crossover study. Each volunteer received a 200mg tablet, 200mg in solution or 5mg intravenously under fasting conditions, or a 200mg tablet with food. Venous blood samples were collected up to 72 hours after oral administration and 12 hours after intravenous administration. The concentrations of epanolol in plasma were determined by use of a radio-immunoassay technique, whereas those in urine samples were measured by a high pressure liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method. Analysis of variance was used to assess the significance of the differences between the groups. Epanolol plasma concentrations declined biexponentially with time after an intravenous dose, with a half-life of 7 minutes for the first phase and about 3 hours for the second. Plasma clearance was high (2.1 L/min). Peak plasma concentrations of about 30 to 40 ng/ml were observed at mean times of about 1 to 1.5 hours after oral administration. After the peak, plasma concentrations declined biexponentially, with a terminal phase half-life of about 20 hours. The bioavailability of epanolol for the tablet and solution administered to fasted volunteers was similar (7-8%), but it was about 25% lower when administered as a tablet with food. Urinary recovery of epanolol was about 25% of the administered intravenous dose, but recoveries were much lower (about 1%) following oral administration. These data have been compared with those obtained after single oral doses of epanolol 200mg to elderly patients with angina and subjects with renal or hepatic impairment.", 
    "17": "Many antianginal agents are available for the treatment of coronary artery disease. These agents act by influencing the determinants of myocardial oxygen supply and demand. The 3 main classes of agents are the nitrates, beta-adrenergic blocking agents and the calcium entry blockers. Agents from all 3 classes have shown efficacy in treating both symptomatic and asymptomatic myocardial ischaemia. However, some patients cannot be treated with these agents because of side effects or contraindications. An ideal antianginal drug should effectively treat both angina and silent ischaemia. Additionally, it should be free of side effects, allow for maintenance of physical performance and be metabolically neutral. New agents are being developed which strive for this goal.", 
    "18": "beta-receptor blockers are increasingly used in the treatment of pregnancy-induced hypertension. Hitherto an oxytocic effect on the myometrium could not be excluded. We investigated the effect of 0.8 resp 1.6 mg pindolol on uterine activity in a double blind study in comparison with a placebo group, using a puerperal model. A \"paradoxical\" decline in uterine activity could be demonstrated, speaking in favor of a further propagation of beta-blockers in obstetric practice.", 
    "19": "The pharmacologic profile of the novel beta-adrenoceptor antagonist/vasodilator, carvedilol, has been investigated in vitro. Carvedilol produced competitive antagonism of the beta 1-adrenoceptor mediated positive chronotropic response to isoproterenol in guinea pig atria, and the beta 2-adrenoceptor mediated relaxation to isoproterenol in carbachol (1 mumol/l) precontracted guinea pig trachea, with a dissociation constant (KB) for beta 1-adrenoceptors of 0.8 nmol/l and beta 2-adrenoceptors of 1.3 nmol/l. At slightly higher concentrations, carvedilol produced competitive inhibition of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor mediated contractile response to norepinephrine in rabbit aorta with a KB of 11 nmol/l. Carvedilol had no significant effect on the contractile response to angiotensin II in rabbit aorta at concentrations up to 10 mumol/l, thus demonstrating the lack of nonspecific vasodilator actions in arteries. In canine saphenous vein, carvedilol produced noncompetitive blockade of alpha 2-adrenoceptor mediated vasoconstriction, indicative of some additional activity. In estrogen-primed rat uterus precontracted by depolarization with KCl (70 mmol/l), carvedilol produced concentration-dependent relaxation (IC50 of 7.6 mumol/l), consistent with the notion that carvedilol may be a calcium channel antagonist. Support for this hypothesis was obtained in KCl (70 mmol/l) depolarized rabbit aorta where carvediol (10 mumol/l) produced a 10-fold parallel rightward shift in the concentration-response curve to calcium chloride. These studies demonstrate that carvedilol is a potent beta 1-, beta 2- and alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, and a moderately potent calcium channel antagonist. These multiple activities of carvedilol may contribute to the antihypertensive activity of the compound.", 
    "20": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether metabolic responses to inhaled salbutamol may be used to measure the cardioselectivity of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. We therefore studied the effects of oral doses of atenolol 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg (A50, A100, A200), propranolol 40 mg (P40), and placebo (Pl) on the hypokalaemic (K) and hyperglycaemic (Glu) responses to inhaled salbutamol in five healthy subjects. Increasing doses of atenolol were associated with a progressive attenuation of delta K compared with placebo: -0.72 mmol.l-1 (Pl) vs -0.20 mmol.l-1 (A200). However, delta K with A200 was significantly different from the response with P40: +0.12 mmol.l-1. There were partial reductions in the hyperglycaemic response with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, although this was only significant (compared with Pl) for P40: delta Glu 1.92 mmol.l-1 (Pl) vs 0.76 mmol.l-1 (P40). These results show that beta 2-adrenoceptor blockade by atenolol is a dose-dependent phenomenon, which may be measured by the attenuation of salbutamol-induced hypokalaemia. However, beta 2-adrenoceptor blockade by atenolol 200 mg was less than that by propranolol 40 mg. The glucose response to salbutamol was only partially blocked by propranolol and may therefore not be suitable to assess beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonism.", 
    "21": "The article presents the experience gained with a new betablocker- bopindolol-in the treatment of hypertension. Using a three-month double blind study conducted in 2 centres, the antihypertensive effect of bopindolol and metoprolol was compared in a total of 86 patients. The incidence of undesirable effects was determined, and biochemical parameters before and after therapy were followed up. Both drugs were equally effective in controlling blood pressure. In 70% of patients with mild and moderate hypertension, diastolic pressure values less than 95 mmHg were obtained in monotherapy with a betablocker. The incidence of undesirable effects was low, the drug was tolerated well. Biochemical parameters did not change within the three months of study.", 
    "22": "We compared the levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1) in non-insulin-dependent diabetics with hypertension who were treated with monotherapy of diuretics or other antihypertensive drugs (AHD) and in those who were not given any AHD. Total 162 patients were divided into the four groups; the control group without AHD (n = 45), the diuretics group (n = 42), the beta-blocker group (n = 30) and the Ca-antagonist group (n = 45). FPG and HbA1 levels were 153 +/- 44 mg/dl and 10.0 +/- 2.3% for the control group, 145 +/- 55 mg/dl and 9.8 +/- 2.2% for the diuretics, 165 +/- 63 mg/dl and 10.2 +/- 2.1% for the beta-blocker and 158 +/- 42 mg/dl and 10.4 +/- 2.0% for the Ca-antagonist, respectively. There were no significant differences in the levels of FPG and HbA1 among the four groups. Multivariate analysis also revealed no difference in glycemic control even when anti-diabetic treatment (diet alone, oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin), body mass index, serum potassium, systolic and diastolic blood pressures and age were taken into account. Blood pressure levels did not differ among the groups except control and they were well controlled at the low doses of AHD. Our results suggest that the choice of low dose diuretics for the treatment of hypertension in non-insulin-dependent diabetics might not be necessarily excluded by the only reason of the possible deleterious influence on glycemic control.", 
    "23": "The non-specific bronchial reactivity and cough threshold of hypertensive patients on an ACE-I monotherapy regimen (either captopril or enalapril), a beta 1-antagonist monotherapy regimen (either atenolol or metoprolol) or a combination of an ACE-I with a beta 1-antagonist were determined in the present study. Forty-six hypertensives who were on these medications performed a histamine inhalation test (to assess bronchial reactivity) and a further 36 of these individuals participated in the citric acid test (to assess cough threshold). A control cohort consisting of 25 age-matched, drug-free subjects also performed the citric acid test. The incidence of bronchial hyperreactivity was not significantly different between the ACE-I monotherapy regimen and the beta 1-antagonist monotherapy regimen (Chi-squared = 0.248). However, when the monotherapy regimens were pooled and compared with the ACE-I and beta 1-antagonist combination regimen, the combination regimen was found to be associated with a significantly higher incidence of bronchial hyperreactivity (Chi-squared = 6.69). No difference was observed between the age-matched controls and the hypertensive patients in terms of their cough threshold.", 
    "24": "Meta-123I-iodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG), which is an analog of norepinephrine, can be used to evaluate the integrity and function of sympathetic nerve endings in the heart. Myocardial uptake of 123I-MIBG was studied in 30 myocardial infarction patients and compared with the distribution of blood flow assessed with 201Tl. It was found that when a cold defect appeared on the 201Tl scintigram, its localization was identical to the cold defect on the 123I-MIBG scintigram. On the other hand, in three cases, a defect was found on the 123I-MIBG scintigram, corresponding to the electrocardiographic localization of the infarct, whereas the 201Tl scintigram was normal. Most strikingly, the present study shows that drugs (antagonists of the adrenergic receptors, calcium antagonists, amiodarone) decrease or even abolish (as in the case of labetalol) myocardial uptake of 123I-MIBG. Consequently, any interpretation of the 123I-MIBG scintigram must take into account the treatment administered.", 
    "25": "Congestive heart failure is emerging as an important public health problem because of its frequency and high mortality. Over the past decade, a number of clinical trials have been launched in a systematic attempt to determine an optimal therapeutic strategy for the treatment of heart failure. There appears to be a trend to begin treatment with both a diuretic and a vasodilator regimen in patients with symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. Converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to clearly benefit patients with class IV heart failure. The role of digitalis, other inotropic agents, beta-blockers, partial beta-agonists and antiarrhythmic agents is still evolving, but several clinical trials of these agents have been recently launched or are in the planning stages. Patients with symptomless left ventricular dysfunction are at risk to develop heart failure. One attractive hypothesis being tested is that preventive therapy with converting enzyme inhibitors may prevent progressive cardiac dilatation and thereby improve survival in this important reservoir of patients. Until the results of these numerous clinical trials are published, physicians should reserve judgement regarding the undefined efficacy of various investigational agents used in the treatment of heart failure and use their experience and judgement when planning a therapeutic strategy for their individual patients.", 
    "26": "The antiarrhythmic properties of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists have long been recognized and, according to the Vaughan Williams classification of antiarrhythmic drugs, these drugs are regarded as a separate entity, namely class II. In this review, Ad IJzerman and Willem Soudijn focus on the nature and the molecular basis of the antiarrhythmic action of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Structure-activity relationship studies demonstrate that the antiarrhythmic profile of different beta-adrenoceptor antagonists is not fixed and some compounds have class I or class III properties which may be clinically relevant.", 
    "27": "Data collected by a single observer on 362 patients taking part in an acute intervention trial were used to derive simple methods of predicting outcome in conscious stroke victims. The effectiveness of these univariate methods was then compared with that of multivariate models based on discriminant function analysis. The multivariate models were somewhat better at predicting death within the first month in newly-admitted patients, and in predicting lack of functional improvement between one and six months in those still in hospital at one month. Even so, these predictions could not be made with certainty and the improvements in probability offered by multivariate over univariate analysis are unlikely to be of practical benefit to the clinician. Single variables such as power in the affected arm and continence were as good as the discriminant functions at predicting discharge within the first month and first six months, respectively. The predictive power of these single simple clinical variables was validated in a separate group of 277 stroke patients. The various proposed methods of prognostication in stroke need to be compared in prospective studies, but until this is done, we recommend a simple approach using the best available clinical information.", 
    "28": "Behavioural and pharmacological studies have suggested that anxiety may be an important factor in the initiation of non-opioid analgesia in defeated male mice. In the present study, the effects of three 5-HT1A anxiolytics (buspirone, ipsapirone and gepirone) on basal nociception and defeat analgesia were examined. Results show that the analgesic consequences of social defeat were potently blocked by all three compounds, with a rank-order potency (minimum effective doses) of ipsapirone (0.05 mg/kg) greater than gepirone (0.1 mg/kg) greater than buspirone (0.5 mg/kg). These inhibitory effects on defeat analgesia were observed in the absence of intrinsic activity on basal nociception (tail-flick assay). When administered alone, (-)pindolol produced biphasic effects on defeat analgesia with enhancement at 0.5 mg/kg and inhibition at 5.0 mg/kg. Lower doses of (-)pindolol (0.05 and 0.25 mg/kg) which did not affect defeat analgesia when administered alone, totally blocked the inhibitory effects of ipsapirone (0.5 mg/kg). Data are discussed in relation to the involvement of 5-HT1A receptor mechanisms in this adaptive form of pain inhibition.", 
    "29": "The reactivities with beta-adrenergic receptors of the bromoacetyl derivatives of the beta-adrenergic antagonists alprenolol and pindolol, BAAM and BIM, respectively, were compared in intact S49 mouse lymphoma cells. Both compounds caused irreversible blockade of receptors and changes in the mobility of the remaining non-modified receptors. BIM proved to be an irreversible blocker of high potency, with an IC50 of 40-60 nM at 4 degrees C, whereas the IC50 for BAAM was 600-900 nM. Moreover, treatment with both compounds resulted in an inhibition of internalization of non-modified receptors (IC50 = 200-300 nM for both). After treatment of desensitized cells which have internalized 50-60% of their surface receptors, with BIM or BAAM, receptor reappearance was found to be slowed down (IC50 about 100 nM for both compounds). The effects of the bromoacetylated antagonists on receptor internalization were apparently selective for beta-adrenergic receptors, since binding and internalization of transferrin or low-density lipoprotein were not affected.", 
    "30": "1. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of diazepam (1.5-6 mg/kg) decreased the core body temperature (BT) of the rats. The effect was dose-dependent. 2. The hypothermia produced by diazepam (6 mg/kg, i.p.) was decreased in animals pretreated with high doses of bicuculline (BIC, 3 mg/kg, i.p.), while low doses of BIC (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) potentiated the hypothermia. 3. Picrotoxin (PIC, 1 and 2 mg/kg, i.p.) pretreatment also decreased the hypothermic effect of diazepam. 4. Pretreatment of animals with atropine (AT, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) or propranolol (PRO, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) potentiated the hypothermic response of diazepam. Phenoxybenzamine (PHEN, 0.5 mg/kg, i.p.), methergoline (METH, 0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) or pimozide (PIM, 0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) did not change the diazepam hypothermia. 5. Single administration of BIC, PIC, PRO, PIM or METH also induced hypothermia. 6. One can postulate that diazepam hypothermia may be induced through GABAA receptor sites. However, further studies will clarify this hypothesis.", 
    "31": "1. Procaine, a membrane stabilizer, depresses the maximal responses of the electrically driven rat right ventricle to isoprenaline. 2. Esmomol is a competitive beta-adrenoceptor antagonist as it causes parallel rightward shifts of isoprenaline response curves. 3. Atenolol, bufuralol and prizidilol were dual antagonists of the responses to isoprenaline. 4. The competitive component of the dual antagonism (parallel rightward shift of response curve) is due to beta-adrenoceptor antagonism whereas the noncompetitive component (depression of isoprenaline maximal response) is probably due to membrane stabilization. 5. This membrane stabilizing activity of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists may be clinically relevant.", 
    "32": "The phenomenon of sudden mortality in the chick embryo, induced by the exogenous neurotransmitters norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, carbachol, and by the beta-blockers propranolol and atenolol, is described. When introduced singly into eggs (albumen) in doses of 0.1 mg per egg, these substances induced highly significant, sharply increased mortality (60% to 100%) when the introduction was on embryonic (incubation) days 8 to 12 (hereafter called E8 and E12), but none if introduction was earlier. These ages follow the appearance of functional receptors (or receptor-effectors) for these substances. However, the involvement of receptors here has not been proved. Solvent alone (Ringer's solution for chick) had no effect, indicating that the procedures used were in themselves not lethal. Possibly, the above neurotransmitters became lethal to the embryo because they were introduced in excess of the amounts which were produced and needed at that time by the embryo for optimal development.", 
    "33": "Within the last decade it became obvious that the treatment of angina pectoris alone is not sufficient. Modern goals include the optimization of anti-ischemic treatment (\"silent myocardial ischemia\") without compromising quality of life, as well as the reduction of fatal and non-fatal cardiac events. The failure of nitrates to continuously protect from myocardial ischemia (\"nitrate tolerance\") requires a modification of the current step-care recommendations for medical treatment. Numerous combinations of nitrates, betablockers and calcium channel blockers compensate for each other regarding their effects on heart rate, contractility, peripheral resistance and coronary blood flow. Recommendations for combination therapy decisively depend on the choice of the first-line drug. Only nitrates reduce myocardial preload by venodilation and substitute for EDRF-deficiency. After headaches disappear, nitrates do not affect quality of life and they are cheap. The nitrate-induced acceleration of heart rate should be compensated by the addition of beta-blockers or heart rate-decreasing calcium channel blockers. Therefore, the combination of nitrates with heart-rate-increasing calcium channel blockers, such as nifedipine, should be avoided. Many studies have proven the superiority of different double and triple therapies, as compared to their single components. A few reports, however, did not confirm this increase of anti-ischemic efficacy with combination therapy. The improvement of prognosis is proven for beta blockers without ISA in subgroups of patients with acute or post myocardial infarction and can be assumed for nitrates as well. With regard to prognosis, calcium channel blockers were inferior to nitrates and beta blockers. The combination of nitrates with a non-ISA betablocker should be preferred in post myocardial infarction patients with ventricular arrhythmias, whereas the combination of nitrates with a heart rate decreasing calcium channel blocker should be preferred in patients with COPD, severe peripheral arterial disease or severe diabetes. The combination of nitrates with a heart-rate-increasing calcium channel blocker should be considered in patients with sinus bradycardia, first degree AV-block, or proven coronary spasm. In patients with congestive heart failure, betablockers and calcium channel blockers should be avoided. To optimize medical treatment of ischemic heart disease, intermittent high dosage ISDN plus a beta blocker without ISA or ISDN plus a calcium channel blocker like verapamil are recommended. Frequently, however, the patient decides by himself, based on unacceptable side effects.", 
    "34": "A study was made of the effect of beta 1-adrenoblockers (metoprolol, atenolol, talinolol) on bronchial patency in patients with concomitant bronchial asthma (BA) under acute drug use and in the course of continuous therapy. Broncho-obstructive complications occurring in part of the patients were not associated with the disease gravity or with the pathogenetic variety of BA. Besides, they were not associated with the drug dose either (use was made of the mean therapeutic dosage range). The rate and the intensity of bronchial patency abnormalities occurring in the course of the continuous treatment with beta 1-adrenoblockers (with metoprolol, in particular) depended on the initial status of the adrenergic regulation of the body. Significant disorders of bronchial patency including clinically marked ones were naturally observed with initially low excretion of cAMP in the morning portion of urine (less than 3 mmole/1).", 
    "35": "Celiprolol, propranolol or saline were administered to separate groups (n = 5-6) of anesthetized dogs in which a critical stenosis was applied to the circumflex coronary artery for 90 min and then reperfused for 30 min. Test drugs were administered at 30 min poststenosis and the effects on pH, regional function and endocardiogram were monitored. A reduction in coronary flow of 54 +/- 2% (n = 27) yielded marked increases in hydrogen ion concentration (H+) of 17 +/- 2 X 10(-8) and ischemic endocardial ST segment of 6 +/- 1 mV while ischemic segmental shortening decreased 75 +/- 9%. Heart rate, arterial pressure and normal regional function were not altered. Celiprolol 0.1 and 1 mg/kg, i.v., reversed the alterations in H+ and ischemic ST segment to prestenosis values while improving ischemic segmental shortening 20 and 38%, respectively, and not affecting heart rate. Propranolol 0.1 and 1 mg/kg, i.v., reversed the alterations in H+ and ischemic ST segment to prestenosis values while further decreasing ischemic segmental shortening 66 and 30%, respectively. Upon reperfusion, ischemic segmental shortening returned to prestenosis values in the group treated with celiprolol 1 mg/kg, i.v., while the propranolol- and saline-treated groups further decreased. It is concluded that celiprolol is efficacious in normalizing myocardial function and ischemia-induced electrophysiological changes following coronary artery stenosis.", 
    "36": "Cardioprotective and antiarrhythmic effects of three beta-blockers with different pharmacological properties were investigated in 33 anesthetized dogs with a 2-h coronary occlusion. Dogs were divided into 4 groups and received physiological saline or one of the following drugs using a 10-min infusion at 25 min before the occlusion: saline or control (n = 12), propranolol (0.3 mg/kg, n = 7), bisoprolol (0.05 mg/kg, n = 7), and nipradilol (0.2 mg/kg, n = 7) groups. Blood pressure did not significantly differ among the 4 experimental groups throughout the entire observation period. On the contrary, the postocclusion change (fall) in heart rate from the preocclusion value was significantly (P less than 0.05-0.01) greater in the drug-treated groups than in the control group. Each of the beta-blockers effectively prevented the development of ventricular arrhythmias associated with the 2-h coronary occlusion. In terms of assessing a cardioprotective effect, the respiratory control index and rate of oxygen consumption in State III in mitochondria, and lysosomal enzyme activities (N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase or beta-glucuronidase) in myocardial tissues, all prepared from both ischemic and non-ischemic areas, were measured using the respective, established methods. The 2-h coronary occlusion induced a mitochondrial dysfunction and leakage of lysosomal enzymes in the control group, whereas each beta-blocker significantly (P less than 0.05-0.01) protected mitochondria against ischemia and prevented the lysosomal enzyme leakage. The results indicate that the antiarrhythmic effects of beta-blockers on ischemic myocardium are, at least in part, due to their cardioprotective action, and these effects appear to be unrelated to the ancillary pharmacological properties of these drugs.", 
    "37": "29 patients were examined during a therapy with beta blockers. The medication was applied over 12 weeks, 16 patients received propranolol 120 mg/day, 13 patients metoprolol 200 mg/day. Two patients showed side-effects. Neurophysiological examinations, i.e. sural nerve conduction velocity and paired stimulation of the sural nerve, revealed a slight decrease of nerve conduction velocity and a significant increase of the latency prolongation of the second nerve action potential when the medication was finished. These functional changes in the sural nerve may result from the interaction of metoprolol and propranolol with beta-receptors of the peripheral nerve.", 
    "38": "alpha-Naphthyl isocyanate (NI) as a derivatizing agent to separate several beta-blockers was described. This procedure is simple, rapid and gives good resolution. Experiments with NI derivatives of alprenolol showed that the isocyanate group reacted with the amino group on the analyte to form urea under mild conditions and with the hydroxyl group to form carbamate under relatively vigorous conditions. The results also indicated that the derivatized reactions is 1:1 between NT and analytes.", 
    "39": "A short-term cultivation of human skin combined with histoautoradiography have demonstrated that the blood serum of psoriasis patients is characterized by an in vitro effect similar to the beta-blocker effect, i.e. eliminates the epidermal chalone action, thus enhancing the epidermal cell proliferation in foci of skin involvement in psoriasis.", 
    "40": "The effects of carvedilol, a new vasodilating beta-blocking drug, were studied in experimental pigs during short-term acute myocardial ischemia. In 21 anesthetized pigs 0.01, 0.03, and 0.1 mg/kg b.w. carvedilol was studied during repeated 2-min distal LAD-occlusions and a 60-min-period of ischemia. Left ventricular volume was continuously measured by the impedance catheter method. Intravenous administration of 0.01 mg/kg carvedilol resulted in a significant decrease of heart rate (-13%), dp/dtmax (-32%), and ejection fraction (-9%), slight changes of systolic pressure (-3%), and an increase of vascular resistance (+24%), indicating a beta-blocker effect without vasodilation-while the first vasodilatory effect was found at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg. During ischemia carvedilol had no influence on the time-course or the extent of systolic bulging of the ischemic myocardium, but the ischemia-induced decrease of left ventricular ejection fraction was diminished. Both during short-term ischemia, as well as during the 60-min-ischemia-period carvedilol significantly reduced ventricular premature beats. During the 60-min-ischemia-period activation delay measured from local DC-electrograms of the ischemic myocardium, as well as the occurrence of activation block were not altered by carvedilol, as was the incidence of ventricular fibrillation (69%). We conclude that at low dosages the beta-blocking effect of carvedilol exceeds the vasodilating properties. This may also hold true in patients with cardiac failure; they are more sensitive to beta-blocking drugs. During ischemia carvedilol slightly reduces the ischemia-dependent decrease of global ventricular function and it has an antiarrhythmic effect. Therefore, it may be protective in patients with acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "41": "In this single-blind, placebo-controlled trial, carvedilol, a nonselective beta-blocking and vasodilating agent was studied in six patients with chronic stable angina. All patients had reproducible treadmill exercise time without medical treatment and developed chest pain in association with ST-segment depression (greater than 1 mm at J + 80 msec) on exercise. None had a history of rest or unstable angina or myocardial infarction within three months prior to the study. In all patients, anti-anginal medication except sublingual nitroglycerin was discontinued for 10 days. The patients entered an initial two week-phase of placebo. They then received carvedilol, 25 mg and then 50 mg twice daily for two weeks on each dose, followed by another two week-placebo-phase. Radionuclide ventriculography was performed at the end of each phase at rest and during maximal symptom-limited exercise. Bicycle ergometry was carried out in the supine position with incremental workloads. Exercise time and workload were recorded at the end of the first phase and imaging was performed at the same time and workload throughout the trial. Carvedilol produced a dose-related reduction in rest and exercise heart rate and blood pressure. Peak exercise ST-segment change was reduced by both doses of carvedilol, but this did not achieve a level of significance. After the first placebo phase all patients had abnormal left ventricular wall motion and resting ejection fraction (range: 35% to 45%). Four out of six patients had significant improvement in wall motion abnormalities, in two patients there was no change, and none developed a deterioration in abnormal wall motion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "42": "Carvedilol--a vasodilating beta-blocker has been shown in multicentre trials to be as effective as standard beta-blockers in improving exercise tolerance in patients with angina pectoris and it is more effective than nifedipine. The side effects are less than conventional beta-blockers and nifedipine. Carvedilol is an effective anti-anginal therapy and improves the quality of life.", 
    "43": "There are two principal divisions of the beta adrenoceptor blocking drugs in widespread clinical use, non-selective and selective agents, with or without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. These properties confer differing pharmacological properties. A beta blocking drug with significant intrinsic sympathomimetic activity can be regarded as a multiple action drug. A third division of beta adrenoceptor blocking drugs is a newer development; these, which beside blocking the beta receptor, have an important peripheral vasodilator activity. Labetalol was the first drug of this group, prizidilol followed, but has been withdrawn because of toxicity. Several other agents are now under evaluation including bucindolol, carvedilol, dilevalol (one of the isomers of labetalol) and medroxalol. Celiprolol is an agent which is beta 1 selective and in addition has peripheral vasodilator activity. There are three mechanisms which have been described as responsible for peripheral vasodilation, alpha receptor blockade, beta 2 agonism, and a dilator action independent of either the alpha or beta receptors. Evidence for these various mechanisms is more readily obtainable from animal experiments, but some confirmatory evidence has been obtained in man. Inhibition of alpha stimulation has been found with labetalol, to a small degree with medroxalol and carvedilol, and has been suggested with celiprolol. Beta 2 mediated vasodilatation has been shown by celiprolol, dilevalol and medroxalol, and evidence of a vasodilatation independent of alpha or beta receptors has been obtained with celiprolol and carvedilol. More evidence is required to be sure of the exact contribution of each of these mechanisms. Combined action results in important haemodynamic differences from beta blockade, notably, peripheral resistance is reduced and less effect is seen on cardiac output.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "44": "It seems likely that a number of medical and surgical treatments have had an impact on the overall mortality from ischaemic heart disease in recent years although there is comparatively little data upon which to base conclusions. The two forms of treatment which have been shown, in controlled trials, to reduce mortality are beta blockade after infarction and coronary artery bypass surgery in chronic ischaemic heart disease. It is of interest that these treatments seem to be most often applied in countries that have had the greatest fall in mortality, although it is not suggested that they have played more than a small role. It is likely that other influences on mortality have included the use of pacemakers and the avoidance of previously undesirable medical practices. Much more careful documentation of the use of treatments in different countries is highly desirable.", 
    "45": "In vivo somatostatin inhibits exocrine pancreatic secretion. In in vitro experiments, such as the isolated perfused pancreas, somatostatin fails to inhibit exocrine pancreatic secretion. This suggests an indirect action of somatostatin, such as modulation of neural regulation. In the anesthetized rat we tested the inhibitory capacity of somatostatin in the presence of neural blockade in vivo. Neither the drugs given intravenously--phentolamine, propranolol, atropine and naloxone--nor vagotomy were able to prevent somatostatin-induced inhibition of exocrine pancreatic secretion. We conclude that somatostatin-induced inhibition of exocrine pancreatic secretion is not dependent on intact extrinsic innervation.", 
    "46": "Mechanisms of action of norepinephrine (NE) on dentate gyrus granule cells were studied in rat hippocampal slices using extra- and intracellular recordings and measurements of stimulus and amino acid-induced changes in extracellular Ca2+ and K+ concentration. Bath application of NE (10-50 microM) induced long-lasting potentiation of perforant path evoked potentials, and markedly enhanced high-frequency stimulus-induced Ca2+ influx and K+ efflux, actions blocked by beta-receptor antagonists and mimicked by beta agonists. Enhanced Ca2+ influx was primarily postsynaptic, since presynaptic delta [Ca2+]o in the stratum moleculare synaptic field was not altered by NE. Interestingly, the potentiation of both ionic fluxes and evoked population potentials were antagonized by the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV). Furthermore, NE selectively enhanced the delta [Ca2+]o delta [K+]o and extracellular slow negative field potentials elicited by iontophoretically applied NMDA, but not those induced by the excitatory amino acid quisqualate. These results suggest that granule cell influx of Ca2+ through NMDA ionophores is enhanced by NE via beta-receptor activation. In intracellular recordings, NE depolarized granule cells (4.8 +/- 1.1 mV), and increased input resistance (RN) by 34 +/- 6.5%. These actions were also blocked by either the beta-antagonist propranolol or specific beta 1-blocker metoprolol. Moreover, the depolarization and RN increase persisted for long periods (93 +/- 12 min) after NE washout. In contrast, while NE, in the presence of APV, still depolarized granule cells and increased RN, APV made these actions quickly reversible upon NE washout (16 +/- 9 min). This suggested that NE induction of long-term, but not short-term, plasticity in the dentate gyrus requires NMDA receptor activation. NE may be enhancing granule cell firing by some combination of blockade on the late Ca2+-activated K+ conductance and depolarization of granule cells, both actions that can bring granule cells into a voltage range where NMDA receptors are more easily activated. Furthermore, NE also elicited activity-independent long-lasting depolarization and RN increases, which required functional NMDA receptors to persist.", 
    "47": "This paper describes a meta-analysis of data from the 5 primary and 15 secondary prevention studies in patients with portal hypertension, in which beta-blockers were compared with inactive control. These studies involved 1525 patients. Overall, the number of patients who suffered bleeding events was 38% lower in the groups treated with beta-blockers (p less than 0.001). The percentage reductions in bleeding-related deaths and in total mortality were 35% and 18%, respectively (p = 0.007 and p = 0.024). More detailed analysis supports the conclusion that propranolol, the beta-blocker predominantly used in these studies, is effective in both the primary and secondary prevention of bleeding events and mortality due to portal hypertension.", 
    "48": "To assess the efficacy of beta-blockers in the prevention of rebleeding in selected cirrhotics and to compare the tolerability, safety of, and patient compliance with, a selective and a non-selective beta-blocker, 94 patients were randomly assigned to propranolol (32), atenolol (32), or placebo (30). Randomisation was made at least 15 days after the bleeding episode. Propranolol was given orally in increasing doses until the resting pulse rate was reduced by approximately 25%. Atenolol was given at a fixed dose of 100 mg/day. Patients were followed up for a mean of 357 days. Rebleeding occurred in 14 patients in the placebo group, 10 in the atenolol group and 8 in the propranolol group. The incidence of rebleeding was significantly lower in patients receiving propranolol than in those on placebo (PR vs PL: p less than 0.01, log-rank test). Atenolol was less effective than propranolol (AT vs PL: p = 0.065, log-rank test) but bleeding-free survival was improved for patients on active drugs compared with those patients on placebo (PR vs PL: p = 0.01; AT vs PL: p = 0.05, log-rank test). Retrospective analysis revealed that, whatever the type of treatment, abstinence from alcohol was crucial in preventing rebleeding. It was concluded that beta-blocker treatment is effective in preventing rebleeding from oesophageal varices in carefully selected alcoholic cirrhotics who survive at least 2 weeks after acute variceal haemorrhage and who cease drinking.", 
    "49": "The number and activity of erythrocyte ATPase-dependent sodium-potassium pump units were increased in obese subjects (p = 0.02). No link was observed between the number or activity of the pump units and hypertension. The ouabain-insensitive rubidium (i.e. potassium) transport was not associated with relative body weight or blood pressure status. Sodium-lithium countertransport correlated significantly with obesity but not with blood pressure status. In the hypertensive patients, before or after therapy with verapamil, hydrochlorothiazide, pindolol or atenolol there were no significant differences in cation transport. We propose that the correlation between obesity and essential hypertension cannot be explained by these two cation transport systems.", 
    "50": "1. To clarify whether acute changes in the properties of baroreflexes can occur in man, we evaluated the time course of baroreflex control of heart rate and cardiopulmonary baroreflex control of forearm vascular resistance (FVR) over 240 min after intravenous administration of propranolol (0.2 mg/kg) in 13 healthy young men. 2. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure remained unchanged after propranolol. Propranolol significantly decreased cardiac index and heart rate, and significantly increased total peripheral resistance. These effects remained unchanged for 240 min after propranolol. 3. Baroreflex control of heart rate was significantly augmented immediately after, and at 30, 60 min after propranolol, but partly reverted to the initial level afterwards. Cardiopulmonary baroreflex control of FVR was reduced immediately after, and at 30, 60 min after propranolol, but partly reverted to the initial level afterwards. Pressor responses to phenylephrine was reduced immediately after propranolol, but no significant differences were observed after 30 min. 4. These results suggest that acute changes in the properties of baroreflexes occur in man after propranolol.", 
    "51": "1. We examined the preganglionic splanchnic nerve activity and postganglionic renal nerve activity before and after a local injection of naloxone (20 micrograms/kg) into the coeliac ganglion of anaesthetized rabbits. This was done during graded hypertension, induced by the administration of phenylephrine (0.5-10 micrograms/kg, i.v.) and with selective intraganglionic injection of methionine-enkephalin (ME) and bunitrolol, which is a beta-blocker. 2. During hypertension both pre- and postganglionic discharge decreased, but only postganglionic discharge was inhibited by naloxone treatment into the ganglion. 3. Local injection of ME (0.1-10 micrograms/kg) into the coeliac ganglion decreased postganglionic activity by 9.0 +/- 1.0 to 41.2 +/- 4.7% from control, and this decrease was inhibited by naloxone. 4. Administration of bunitrolol (1-300 micrograms/kg) decreased postganglionic discharge by 3.9 +/- 1.4 to 39.7 +/- 2.4% of the control and this decrease was also inhibited by naloxone. 5. These results suggest that opioid receptors in the coeliac ganglion play an inhibitory role in neural ganglionic transmission and that this inhibitory action reduces postganglionic sympathetic discharge.", 
    "52": "32 patients with stable angina and a positive symptom-limited exercise test (SLET) were investigated in a double-blind randomized trial in order to assess the therapeutic efficacy of bopindolol or atenolol on the incidence of angina pectoris and on angina pectoris threshold heart rate (ATHR). After a washout and placebo period of 2 weeks, each of the two drugs were applied in dosages of 0.5 mg bopindolol and 50 mg atenolol. The dosage was increased every month up to 2 mg bopindolol and 200 mg atenolol. At the end of every period, the patients were retested by SLET. After 3 months of active treatment, we noticed that the incidence of anginal attacks was lower in the bopindolol group (2.45 vs. 3.29). The resting heart rate was also lower in the bopindolol group (55.89 vs. 63.38). No statistical significance was found between the peak work rate, ATHR, exercise duration and S-T depression. The rate-pressure product was lower in the bopindolol group. We concluded from this that bopindolol and atenolol are active in decreasing the incidence of angina, the former being more effective. Exercise performance and cardiocirculatory parameters did not differ between the two groups.", 
    "53": "Impaired left ventricular diastolic dysfunction is common in patients with ischaemic heart failure. The beta 1-adrenoceptor partial agonist xamoterol was compared with pindolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, in a haemodynamic study in 17 patients with ischaemic heart disease. Pindolol caused left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, wall stress and T1 to rise, whereas xamoterol produced improvements in all three parameters. These results suggest that xamoterol may be of greater benefit to patients in heart failure.", 
    "54": "An anaesthetised dog preparation was used to examine the pharmacological profiles of xamoterol, cicloprolol, prenalterol and pindolol. The effects of these agents on heart rate and hind limb perfusion pressure revealed that xamoterol is highly cardioselective and has no significant agonist activity at beta 2-receptors and no membrane stabilising effect. These pharmacological properties are not complicated by the formation of active metabolites and may explain the clinical benefits in the long-term treatment of heart failure.", 
    "55": "The effects on carotid artery blood flow of atenolol (a selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist) and xamoterol (a beta 1-adrenoceptor partial agonist with 43% agonist activity) were measured using a Doppler technique in eight healthy volunteers. Atenolol produced a decrease in blood pressure and blood velocity flow, and tended to reduce volume flow. In contrast, there were no changes with xamoterol or placebo. Beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade may reduce cerebral blood flow but the partial agonist xamoterol does not appear to reduce carotid blood flow.", 
    "56": "Changes in peripheral blood flow in response to increasing doses of xamoterol with or without a beta 2-adrenoceptor blocking agent were assessed in eight healthy volunteers. Xamoterol produced increases in femoral artery diameter, blood volume flow and velocity flow. In the brachial and posterior tibial arteries, systolic blood pressure rose, and in the brachial artery, diastolic blood pressure fell. None of these effects was affected by beta 2-adrenoceptor blockade. The actions of xamoterol on the circulation are consistent with direct stimulation of myocardial beta 1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "57": "To determine the effect of strong analgesics on electrical instability (vulnerability to ventricular fibrillation), we examined the action of fentanyl (60 micrograms/kg), sufentanil (10 micrograms/kg) and carfentanil (3 micrograms/kg) on the ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) in a dog model of coronary artery occlusion. The effect of strong analgesics was compared with that of the first-generation beta-blocker propranolol (1.2 mg/kg) and the third-generation beta-blocker celiprolol (3 mg/kg). In the 5th minute of ischaemia, VFT declines in all groups of dogs. VFT values rise significantly from the 23rd to the 60th minute of ischaemia after opiate analgesic administration. The mean increase in VFT after opiate analgesics is less pronounced than after beta-blockers. Administration of opioid analgesics is followed by strong prevalence of vagal drive to the heart. Sympathetic drive to the heart after propranolol administration disappears and is depressed after the administration of celiprolol only. Blockers of the beta-receptors apparently intervene directly in the ischaemic focus and affect the \"substrate\" of electrical instability. The opioid analgesics probably exert their effect through a change in \"substrate\" modulation. There is an ongoing search for drugs that would stabilize the heart electrically in acute myocardial infarction, thus preventing sudden death. Our experimental results favour a combination of strong analgesics with other electrostabilizing drugs.", 
    "58": "This study examined the interpersonal behavior and concomitant cardiovascular reactivity (CVR) of hypertensive patients whose resting blood pressure was controlled by antihypertensive medication. Thirty hypertensive and 30 normotensive subjects matched for age, sex and occupational status were recruited from an industrial setting. The groups were compared on measures of interpersonal behavior, blood pressure and heart rate while they engaged in both role-played (RP) and naturalistic interactions (NI) requiring positive and negative assertion. Interpersonal behavior of the groups was generally similar, with two exceptions: hypertensives made fewer requests for new behavior in the negative RP and verbalized more praise statements in the positive NI. There were no differences between the groups on measures of CVR during interpersonal interactions. Overall effectiveness during scenes requiring negative assertion was associated with increased cardiovascular reactivity, especially for hypertensives. The interpersonal behavior and cardiovascular responses of patients taking beta-blocker medication did not differ from those taking diuretics. These findings are discussed with regard to methodological considerations pertinent to the assessment of interpersonal behavior and the issue of heterogeneity among hypertensives.", 
    "59": "There are conflicting reports on the effect of stimulation of the beta-adrenergic receptors on insulin removal by the liver. It was, therefore, the aim of the present study to clarify that problem. Four experiments have been carried out on a group of 8 healthy female volunteers: (1) isoproterenol was infused intravenously, (2) glucose was infused intravenously, (3) isoproterenol was infused with glucose, and (4) infusion of isoproterenol and glucose was preceded by administration of propranolol (the beta-adrenergic blocking agent). The concentration of C-peptide and insulin was determined in plasma from the antecubital vein. It has been found that stimulation of the beta-adrenergic receptors with isoproterenol reduces insulin removal by the human liver. This effect of isoproterenol is prevented by blockade of the beta-adrenergic receptors with propranolol.", 
    "60": "The question whether initial antihypertensive treatment with a beta-blocker prevents hypertensive complications better than initial treatment with a non-betablocker, mainly diuretic based treatment, has been studied in recent large-scale studies like the Medical Research Council (MRC) trial, the International Prospective Primary Prevention Study in Hypertension (IPPPSH), the Heart Attack Primary Prevention in Hypertension (HAPPHY) study and the Metoprolol Atherosclerosis Prevention in Hypertensives (MAPHY) study. The first three studies were unable to find a more beneficial effect of beta-blockers than of thiazide diuretics. The MAPHY study, however, found a lower total mortality, in the metoprolol treated group than in the diuretic treated. As the HAPPHY and MAPHY studies share a substantial part of patient-years and number of deaths, these diverging results have evoked confusion and debate. This paper presents the main results of both studies and discusses the possible reasons for the different outcome.", 
    "61": "Antihypertensive drugs that interact with adrenoceptors have certain advantages and disadvantages (on the treatment of hypertension). Alpha-1 antagonists such as prazosin have favorable effects on plasma lipids but may produce excessive postural falls in blood pressure, particularly following the initial dose. Recently developed alpha-1 antagonists (doxazosin, terazosin) have longer durations of action than prazosin, allowing less frequent administration. Beta blockers may be cardioprotective but in contrast to alpha-1 antagonists tend to have adverse effects on plasma lipids. Drugs with combined beta and alpha-1 blocking activity such as labetalol have favorable metabolic effects but postural hypotension remains a problem. Recently developed drugs with different alpha-1/beta blocking ratios that differ from labetalol may prove to be more popular clinically. Several beta blockers with vasodilator activity which is not due to alpha-1 blockade have also been developed. These drugs appear to have favorable metabolic effects similar to drugs with alpha-1 blocking activity, but do not cause postural hypotension.", 
    "62": "The hemodynamic effects of CGP 17582 B, a new cardio-selective beta-blocking agent with moderate intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and minimal effects on myocardial contractility, were studied in patients after cardiac surgery for coronary artery bypass graft. Each patient had been treated preoperatively with beta-blocking agents and had a cineangiographic left ventricular ejection fraction between 40 and 60%. Fourteen patients were randomized to receive either 10 mg of propranolol or 50 mg of CGP 17582 B orally. Both drugs resulted in a significant and a similar decrease in heart rate. However, this was associated with a significant decrease in stroke volume after propranolol but not after CGP 17582 B, so that cardiac output significantly decreased only after propranolol. Thermodilution right ventricular ejection fraction significantly decreased after propranolol but not after CGP 17582 B. Each drug was well tolerated during the 10 following days and the recovery was uneventful in each patient. These results indicate that CGP 17582 B is a promising beta-blocking agent susceptible to reduce heart rate without altering cardiovascular function after cardiac surgery.", 
    "63": "beta-Adrenoceptors were identified and characterized by [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([ 3H]DHA) binding experiments in muscle membrane preparations from piglets. The [3H]DHA binding was rapid, reversible and stereoselective. Catecholamines competed for specific binding with a rank order of potency (-)-isopropylnoradrenaline greater than (-)-epinephrine much greater than (-)-norepinephrine, indicating a beta 2-subtype of adrenoceptor. Saturation binding experiments with [3H]DHA showed no significant difference for either the number of binding sites or the equilibrium dissociation constants in normal and splayleg pigs. Adenylate cyclase assays indicated that the basal adenylate cyclase activity and the prostaglandin E1 (PGE1)-, (-)-isopropylnoradrenaline (ISO)-, 5'-guanylyl-imidodiphosphate (GppNHp)- and sodium fluoride (NaF)-stimulated values were not significantly different in normal and splayleg pigs. In both groups, PGE1 did not affect basal activity, whereas ISO and GppNHp stimulated adenylate cyclase activity significantly (p less than 0.001) to about 40% above basal level. NaF induced a significant (p less than 0.001) increase of cAMP in normal and splayleg pigs amounting to 48% and 61% respectively. Significant correlations between absolute adenylate cyclase responses to ISO (r = 0.83***), NaF (r = 0.72**) and GppNHp (r = 0.61*) and basal activity in the splayleg pigs were the most striking findings. In contrast, these correlations could not be detected in the normal pigs. Whether or not this observation reflects an alteration in the signal transduction system needs to be further investigated. To the best of our knowledge this is the first biochemical study which relates an altered beta-adrenoceptor function and porcine splayleg.", 
    "64": "The beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity of the new Class Ic-antiarrhythmic drug diprafenone has been determined in man in comparison with that of propranolol, using the standardized isoproterenol test. Following placebo, the dose of isoproterenol which increased the heart rate by 25 beats.min-1 (CD25) was 0.84 (0.1-2.72) micrograms (median and range). Two hours following single oral doses of 200 mg diprafenone (3.61 micrograms; 1.53-44.15) or 40 mg propranolol (16.06 micrograms; 9.15-27.04) significantly higher CD25-values were found. The affinity constants for the beta-adrenergic receptors calculated on the basis of free drug in the plasma were similar for propranolol and diprafenone (2.79 vs. 2.60 nM-1, respectively). Thus, diprafenone showed a definite degree of beta-blocking activity in a clinically relevant range of plasma concentrations.", 
    "65": "In the 1-day-old rabbit there are a large number of alpha-2- (labeled with [3H]yohimbine) than alpha-1- (labeled with [3H]prazosin) adrenergic receptors in the various parts of urinary tract smooth muscle, but the alpha-1 receptors are functionally more responsive to agonists than are the alpha-2 receptors. Unlike the findings in the adult rabbit, the neonatal bladder dome is functionally more sensitive to alpha-adrenergic agonists than the neonatal bladder base. The rank order of beta-adrenergic receptor densities (labeled with [3H]dihydroalprenolol) in various urinary tract smooth muscles correlates with the magnitude of the relaxant response to isoproterenol. There is a high number of functional muscarinic receptors (labeled with [3H]quinuclidinyl benzylate) in the neonatal urinary tract. The data demonstrate the existence of functional autonomic receptors in neonatal urinary tract smooth muscle.", 
    "66": "The effect of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist metipranolol given twice daily in a dose of 0.5 mg/kg body weight for 3 days on respiration, respiratory control index of mitochondria and oxidative phosphorylation was measured in the heart muscle of anesthetized dogs after 60 min of induced ischemia. In control animals pretreated with saline, all measured variables with the exception of the coefficient of oxidative phosphorylation were significantly decreased. In contrast, pretreatment with metipranolol significantly improved all measured myocardial metabolic variables. The effect of metipranolol on the oxidative phosphorylating processes was more pronounced when the metabolic substrate was glutamate than when it was pyruvate.", 
    "67": "In man a close interrelationship exists between hyperadrenergic states, myocardial ischemia, necrosis, infarction and sudden cardiac death. Persistent high catecholamine levels may also be associated with increased vascular endothelial turnover and permeability to calcium and lipoproteins, increased blood velocity, abnormal blood flow patterns and atheroma formation. There are thus good reasons to predict a cardiovascular protective effect of beta-blockers. Animal data indicate that in spite of apparently adverse plasma lipoprotein changes beta-blockers retard atheromatous plaque formation under conditions of high cholesterol diet with or without stress. A slow heart rate, as well as a reduction in calcium influx and inhibition of both esterification of arterial wall cholesterol (by ACAT) and endothelial permeability to lipoproteins, may be central to this process. Beta-blockers benefit a spectrum of conditions related to the atheromatous process and myocardial necrosis. These are silent ischemia; stable (including mixed), unstable and preinfarction angina; periinfarction events (including myocardial rupture and dissection of the ascending aorta); and myocardial necrosis associated with stress conditions such as head injuries and subarachnoid hemorrhage. In one study coronary deaths in hypertensive men, particularly in smokers, were significantly reduced by metoprolol (a beta 1-selective blocker) compared to a diuretic. In contrast in the MRC study of mild hypertension only nonsmoking men with mild to moderate hypertension who received a nonselective beta-blocker appeared to experience fewer myocardial infarctions. Recent clinical data showed that moderate-severe hypertensives who were optimally controlled by atenolol-based treatment over a 10-year period were less likely to die from myocardial infarction than those suboptimally controlled, irrespective of a rise in serum triglyceride levels. Thus the net effect of acute beta-blockade in hyperadrenergic states, including myocardial infarction, is to limit cardiovascular damage. Chronic beta-blockade inhibits atheroma formation (in animals) and beneficially modifies the incidence of stroke and myocardial infarction, which in man are the long-term consequences of hypertension.", 
    "68": "Both alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic receptors are present on ovine pineals. In the rat these two receptors interact so that activation of the alpha 1-receptor potentiates the beta-receptor-mediated changes in cyclic AMP and the correlated changes in pineal N-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.87). Here we investigate possible interactions between alpha 1- and beta-receptors through changes in cyclic AMP and assess the importance of each receptor to the melatonin response in ovine pineal punches/slices in vitro. The adrenergic agonists isoproterenol (ISO), noradrenaline (NA), and phenylephrine (PHE) stimulated dose-dependent changes in cyclic AMP with the order of potency of ISO greater than NA greater than PHE, consistent with their relative binding affinities for the beta-receptor. The beta-receptor antagonist, propranolol, showed dose-dependent inhibition of the ISO effect, whereas the alpha 1-selective antagonist, prazosin, had no effect. The S-shape of the stimulation and inhibition curves for ISO reflects cyclic AMP changes mediated by the beta-receptor only without interaction through the alpha 1-receptor. Each of the adrenergic agonists stimulated indistinguishable dose-dependent increases in melatonin release. The ability of PHE to stimulate changes in melatonin release in the absence of concomitant changes in cyclic AMP indicates an important role for the alpha 1-receptor. Prazosin inhibits this response, substantiating this conclusion. However, as propranolol is also inhibitory, it seems that the alpha 1-receptor response is absolutely dependent upon a small level of beta-receptor stimulation, thus providing evidence for adrenergic receptor interaction at a step other than cyclic AMP.", 
    "69": "Parallel clinico-pharmacological studies were carried out of ketotifen action in patients with atopic bronchial asthma and in an experimental model of beta-adrenergic blockade in guinea pigs. The results revealed that ketotifen acts on the beta-adrenergic blockade in the patients with atopic bronchial asthma and in the experimental model in guinea pigs. The ketotifen action on beta-adrenergic blockade resembles that of glucocorticosteroids in efficiency.", 
    "70": "Seventy normal persons and 100 patients with coronary disease were examined for circadian rhythms of urine and minerals excretion. The data obtained demonstrate that normal persons were characterized by circadian rhythms of urine and minerals excretion with a definite confidence interval of mesor and amplitude fluctuations. Angina pectoris of effort was marked by infradian rhythms of mineral excreting renal function. Monotherapy with beta-blockers or calcium antagonists given in courses entailed the recovery of the circadian rhythms of mineral-excreting renal function. Parameters of the rhythms of urine and minerals excretion in patients with angina pectoris of effort and rest noticeably differed from those in patients with angina pectoris of effort. In 30.7 percent of the persons, the use of the mathematic methods did not reveal any significant rhythms. The circadian range was found to predominate among the significant rhythms. Antianginal treatment did not produce any appreciable changes.", 
    "71": "8-OH-DPAT (0.25 mg/kg s.c.) produced a facilitation of the male rat sexual behavior, characterized by a decrease in the number of intromissions preceding ejaculation and in the time to ejaculation. This facilitation of the sexual behavior was antagonized by administration of the 5-HT and beta-adrenoceptor antagonist pindolol (4 mg/kg i.p.), but not by the selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist betaxolol (4 mg/kg i.p.). Neither pindolol (2-8 mg/kg), nor betaxolol (2-8 mg/kg), produced any statistically significant effects per se on the male rat sexual behavior, as observed here (mounts, intromissions, ejaculation latency or the post-ejaculatory interval). A higher dose (16 mg/kg) of betaxolol produced a statistically significant reduction in the number of intromissions preceding ejaculation and in the ejaculation latency. The antagonism by pindolol of 8-OH-DPAT-induced effects on male rat sexual behavior suggests an involvement of 5-HT1A receptors in the facilitation of this behavior produced by 8-OH-DPAT.", 
    "72": "Saturation and competition experiments with the radiolabeled beta-adrenergic antagonist (--)-[125I]-iodopindolol were used to characterized beta-adrenoceptor density (Bmax) and receptor affinity in the extraorbital lacrimal gland of male and female Syrian hamsters. Specific binding to the receptor was saturable. Scatchard analysis of saturation isotherms revealed a single population of receptor sites. Male glands had a significantly higher Bmax (38.9 +/- 5.0 vs. 23.3 +/- 2.1 fmol/mg protein, means +/- SEM, p less than 0.02) and receptor affinity (expressed in a lower dissociation constant Kd: 0.065 +/- 0.013 vs. 0.120 +/- 0.015 nM, p less than 0.02) than female glands. Binding of the radiolabeled ligand in competition with various adrenergic antagonists showed the receptor to be stereospecific and of the beta 2-subtype.", 
    "73": "An isolated vagus nerve-trachea tube preparation from guinea-pig was used to study the effect kinetics of bronchodilating beta-adrenoceptor agonists. The test compounds were added either into the fluid-filled lumen or into the external medium and they all inhibited, dose-dependently and completely, the vagally induced contractions. The hydrophilic compounds isoprenaline, salbutamol and terbutaline were much less potent when administered intratracheally as compared with extratracheal administration indicating a slow transport through the epithelial layer. For the lipophilic compound, D2489 (the resorcinol derivative of salmeterol), this difference was less pronounced. When terbutaline was administered as its lipophilic diisobutyrate ester prodrug, ibuterol, the difference between the routes of administration was largely eliminated. The inhibitory effect of terbutaline, but not D2489, was readily reversed by washing. Measurements of terbutaline and D2489 in the tracheal tissue and in the external medium after the intratracheal administration of the compounds support the view that a hydrophilic compound slowly passes the epithelium and is not retained in the tissue, whereas a lipophilic compound rapidly passes the epithelium and is retained by the tissue. The isolated vagus nerve-trachea tube preparation of the guinea-pig is well suited for the concommitant study of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of bronchodilator drugs.", 
    "74": "The ocular antihypertensive effects of ICI 147,798, a natriuretic, non-selective beta-blocker lacking local anaesthetic and intrinsic sympathomimetic activities, were evaluated in unanaesthetized rabbits with water-load-induced ocular hypertension. The racemate was approximately 20 times more potent as a beta-blocker than its d-isomer. The magnitude of reductions in intraocular pressure (IOP) elicited by both compounds was equal following topical administration of an equal dose-concentration (100-300 microliters, 0.5% or 0.75%) to one or both eyes, and the activities were similar to those obtained with timolol. A five-hour duration of the IOP lowering effect was achieved by ICI 147,798 and timolol in this rabbit model. ICI d-147,798 exhibited a shorter duration, which could be prolonged by increasing the concentration of the ophthalmic solution. Timolol caused a pronounced reduction of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia after a single dose (200 microliters, 0.5%) or by repeating the dose twice a day for four consecutive days. Following the same dose regimen, neither ICI 147,798 nor its d-isomer significantly altered the heart rate response produced by isoproterenol. These findings indicate that ICI 147,798, while effective as a potential antiglaucoma agent, does not display the characteristics of beta-blockers on heart rate effects noted with timolol. The results also cast some doubt on the contention that the IOP lowering effect of certain beta-blockers is predominantly determined by specific blockade of beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "75": "Alpha-chymotrypsin-induced ocular hypertension in albino rabbits is widely used as an experimental model to screen potential antiglaucoma drugs. The present study compares the intraocular pressure (IOP) response following the ocular application of single or repeated adrenergic agents in conscious albino and pigmented rabbits. A single instillation of clonidine was not as effective in lowering the IOP in pigmented hypertensive rabbit eyes as in albino hypertensive eyes. Similarly, betaxolol moderately lowered the IOP in albino rabbits but induced a slight response when pigmented rabbits were used as an experimental model. Twice-a-day applications of betaxolol in pigmented hypertensive eyes permitted an identical level of IOP decrease to be reached, as observed in a one-day study in albino rabbits, after at least 6 days of treatment. It has been suggested that the pigmented layers of the iris-ciliary body may act as sites for topically applied antiglaucoma drugs. Non-specific binding could explain in part the frequent discrepancy observed between the preclinical results obtained in albino hypertensive rabbit eyes and clinical results obtained in glaucomatous human eyes."
