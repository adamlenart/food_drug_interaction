    "22": "Cardiomyocytes derived from embryonic stem cells (ESCM) have potential both as an experimental model for investigating cardiac physiology and as a source for tissue repair. For both reasons it is important to characterise the responses of these cells, and one of the key modulators of contraction is the beta-adrenergic system. We therefore undertook a detailed study of the response of the spontaneous beating rate of ESCM to beta-adrenoceptor (betaAR) stimulation. Embryoid bodies (EBs) were generated from murine ES line E14Tg2a by the hanging drop method, followed by plating. Spontaneously beating areas were seen starting from 9-14 days after differentiation: the experiments described here were performed on EBs between developmental day 19 and 48. Beating cell layers were seeded with charcoal to allow tracking of movement by a video-edge detection system. Experiments were performed in physiological medium containing 1 mM Ca2+ at 37 degrees C. Isoprenaline (Iso) increased beating rate with an EC50 value of 52 nM. Iso (0.3 microM) increased basal rate from 67 +/- 7 beats per minute (bpm) to 138 +/- 18 bpm, P < 0.001, n = 22. At earlier developmental time points the response to Iso was not maintained through 5 min exposure; this spontaneous desensitisation only being observed before day 36. A repeat application of Iso after a wash period of 20 min produced reproducible effects on beating rate. Subtype dependence of the betaAR response was determined by comparing an initial response with a second in the presence of selective beta1- or beta2AR antagonists. In the presence of the specific beta1AR-blocker CGP 20712A (300 nM) the increase in rate with Iso was reduced from 207 +/- 42% of basal to 128 +/- 13%, P < 0.01. With the beta2AR-blocker ICI 118,551 (50 nM) there was no significant change in Iso response. Exposure to the muscarinic agonist, carbachol (10 microM), inhibited the increase in frequency mediated by isoprenaline, but had mixed stimulatory and inhibitory effects on basal rate. This study extends the characterisation of ESCM as a preparation for studying receptor pharmacology, and indicates that the beta1AR is the predominant subtype mediating increases in contraction rate in murine ESCM.", 
    "23": "Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) increases contractile force and elicits arrhythmias through 5-HT(4) receptors in porcine and human atrium, but its ventricular effects are unknown. We now report functional 5-HT(4) receptors in porcine and human ventricle. 5-HT(4) mRNA levels were determined in porcine and human ventricles and contractility studied in ventricular trabeculae. Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity was measured in porcine ventricle. Porcine and human ventricles expressed 5-HT(4) receptor mRNA. Ventricular 5-HT(4(b)) mRNA was increased by four times in 20 failing human hearts compared with five donor hearts. 5-HT increased contractile force maximally by 16% (EC(50)=890 nM) and PKA activity by 20% of the effects of (-)-isoproterenol (200 microM) in ventricular trabeculae from new-born piglets in the presence of the phosphodiesterase-inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. In ventricular trabeculae from adult pigs (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine present) 5-HT increased force by 32% (EC(50)=60 nM) and PKA activity by 39% of (-)-isoproterenol. In right and left ventricular trabeculae from failing hearts, exposed to modified Krebs solution, 5-HT produced variable increases in contractile force in right ventricular trabeculae from 4 out of 6 hearts and in left ventricular trabeculae from 3 out of 3 hearts- range 1-39% of (-)-isoproterenol, average 8%. In 11 left ventricular trabeculae from the failing hearts of four beta-blocker-treated patients, pre-exposed to a relaxant solution with 0.5 mM Ca(2+) and 1.2 mM Mg(2+) followed by a switch to 2.5 mM Ca(2+) and 1 mM Mg(2+), 5-HT (1-100 microM, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine present) consistently increased contractile force and hastened relaxation by 46% and 25% of (-)-isoproterenol respectively. 5-HT caused arrhythmias in three trabeculae from 3 out of 11 patients. In the absence of phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 5-HT increased force in two trabeculae, but not in another six trabeculae from 4 patients. All 5-HT responses were blocked by 5-HT(4) receptor antagonists. We conclude that phosphodiesterase inhibition uncovers functional ventricular 5-HT(4) receptors, coupled to a PKA pathway, through which 5-HT enhances contractility, hastens relaxation and can potentially cause arrhythmias.", 
    "24": "The effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on experimental colitis was investigated in Sprague-Dawley rats. Colitis was induced by intracolonic instillation of 4% acetic acid. EA (2 Hz, 0.05 ms, 2 V for 20 min) was applied to bilateral Hoku (LI-4) and Zusanli (ST-36) on 12 hrs and 36 hrs after induction of colitis. EA-treatment significantly reduced the macroscopic damage and the myeloperoxidase activity of colonic samples at 3 days post-induction of colitis. Colitic colon showed a decreased in vitro motility. However, colonic motility of EA-treated group was not significantly different from that of normal group. The anti-inflammatory effect of EA was not inhibited by a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, RU-486, but suppressed by a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranonol. These results suggest that EA-treatment has a beneficial effect on colitis, and its anti-inflammatory effect is mediated by beta-adrenoceptor activation but not by endogenous glucocorticoiddependent mechanism.",

Addition of the calpain inhibitor MDL-28170 mimicked the effects of IPC on protein degradation and reduced LDH release by 48% (P<0.001). The effects of IPC on calpain, alpha-fodrin, and LDH release were blunted by the application of the PKA inhibitor H89 or alprenolol during IPC, while transient stimulation of PKA with CPT-cAMP or isoproterenol before ischemia attenuated calpain activation, alpha-fodrin degradation, and markedly reduced LDH release (P<0.001). In hearts exposed to Na(+)-free perfusion, IPC attenuated calpain activation by 67% (P<0.001) and reduced by 56% (P<0.001) LDH release associated to massive edema occurring during Na(+) readmission without modifying its magnitude.",

    "44": "The pharmacological mechanism of bupropion's thermogenic effect has been investigated in female Wistar rats by measuring oxygen consumption at thermoneutrality (29 degrees C). Bupropion (30 mg/kg) rapidly increased oxygen consumption (VO2) with a maximum effect at 30 min, and VO2 remained elevated throughout the 4-h experimental period. The nonselective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT or serotonin) receptor antagonist, metergoline (1 mg/kg), and the alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin (1 mg/kg), had no effect on the VO2 response to bupropion, whereas the alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist, RS79948 [(8aR, 12aS, 13aS)-5,8,8a,9,10,11,12,12a,13,13a-decahydro-3-methoxy-12-(ethylsulphonyl)-6H-isoquino[2,1-g][1,6]-naphthyridine hydrochloride] (1 mg/kg), potentiated the response. The VO2 response to bupropion during the first 60 min was significantly inhibited by a high dose of the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol (20 mg/kg), but it had no effect at a low dose (1 mg/kg). Pretreatment with the dopamine D2/D1 receptor antagonist, (+)butaclamol (200 microg/kg), caused a partial, but significant, inhibition (P<0.01) of the VO2 response to bupropion during the first 60 min, and this antagonist abolished the effect of bupropion between 90 and 240 min. Pretreatment with a combination of a high dose of propranolol (20 mg/kg) and (+)butaclamol (200 microg/kg) prevented any increase in VO2 induced by bupropion. It is concluded that the beta3-adrenoceptor subtype, as well as dopamine D2/D1 receptors, is responsible for the increase in oxygen consumption induced by bupropion. We have previously demonstrated that bupropion did not significantly reduce food intake in rats. Hence, in this species, its weight-reducing action predominantly results from thermogenesis mediated via activation of beta3-adrenergic and dopamine D2/D1 receptors. Because bupropion has also been reported not to alter food intake in the clinic, thermogenesis may also contribute to its antiobesity effect in man.", 
    "45": "The vascular selectivity of PF9404C ((2'S),(2S)-3-isopropylamine,1-[4-(2,3-dinitroxy)propoxymethyl]-phenoxy-2'-propanol), a new beta-blocker with nitric oxide (NO)-donor and vasodilator properties, was studied in different rabbit arteries and veins. Phenylephrine (10(-6) M) or 35 mM K+ were used to pre-contract the arteries and veins prior to study the relaxant effects of PF9404C and nitroglycerin. The potency of both drugs to depress the phenylephrine-induced contraction was greater than that shown in the blockade of the K(+)-evoked contraction in most of the vessels studied, with the exception of the central ear artery. PF9404C exhibited about three-fold higher potency than nitroglycerin to relax the majority of the vessels studied, especially when they were contracted with K+, and showed a certain selectivity of action for the renal artery. PF9404C produced autotolerance but this effect was about 20-fold less pronounced than that observed with nitroglycerin. Cross-tolerance in those preparations pre-exposed to PF9404C that were relaxed later on with nitroglycerin was much greater than autotolerance. The tolerance for nitroglycerin was practically abolished in the presence of N-acetylcysteine. However, this was not the case for PF9404C. These results indicate that, although sharing the property of being NO donors, PF9404C and nitroglycerin show a different profile in causing vasodilation; furthermore, the tolerance to this effect is lesser for PF9404C and seems to be mediated by a mechanism different to that of nitrates. This makes PF9404C a nice pharmacological tool to further develop novel NO-donor compounds with a lesser degree of vascular tolerance than those now available.", 
    "46": "The effects of trans-(+/-)-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-cyclohexyl]-benzeneacetamide methanesulfonate salt (U50,488H), a selective kappa-opioid receptor agonist, on growth in neonatal ventricular myocytes were determined. In 15% serum culture medium, U50,488H at 0.1-1 microM significantly reduced the protein content, [3H]leucine uptake and cell size of the myocytes. The effect of U50,488H on protein content was abolished in the presence of 1 microM nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI), a selective kappa-opioid receptor antagonist. In a 0.4% serum medium, U50,488H at 0.1-1 microM had no effect on myocyte growth. Interestingly, 1 microM U50,488H abolished the stimulatory effects of 1 microM norepinephrine on protein content, [3H]leucine uptake and cell size of the myocytes in the low serum medium. The effect of U50,488H was abolished by 1 microM nor-BNI. With the exception of cell size, the effects of norepinephrine were completely abolished by blockade of both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors, but only partially blocked by blockade of either adrenoceptors. These results provide first evidence that kappa-opioid receptor stimulation inhibits growth of the neonatal ventricular myocyte as a result of direct action as well as by inhibiting sympathetic stimulation of the heart. The stimulatory effects of sympathetic activity on growth occurs via both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "47": "Catecholamines bind to alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors and are capable of preconditioning ischemic myocardium. Our purpose was to investigate the effect of acute either short or prolonged i.v. administration of beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists on ischemic preconditioning in vivo. Fifty-five anesthetized rabbits were divided into 10 groups (n=5-7 per group) and were subjected to 30-min regional ischemia of the heart after ligation of a prominent left coronary artery and 3-h reperfusion after releasing the snare. Ischemic preconditioning was obtained by three cycles of 5-min ischemia separated by 10-min reperfusion. beta-Adrenoreceptor blockade was obtained by the long acting beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist atenolol or by the short acting esmolol, which were given as a short 5-min infusion or as a prolonged 45-min infusion, starting respectively 20 min before and ending 15 min before the beginning of sustained ischemia, or starting 45 min before and ending immediately before the beginning of sustained ischemia. Atenolol was given at a rate of 0.2 mg min(-1) during 5 min or at a rate of 0.088 mg min(-1) as a 45-min infusion. Esmolol was given as an initial dose of 500 microg kg(-1) within 1 min, followed by a 4-min infusion at a rate of 50 microg kg(-1) min(-1) or as an initial dose of 3.4 mg within 1 min, followed by a 44-min infusion at a rate of 0.15 mg min(-1). Blood pressure and heart rate were continuously monitored. The infarcted and risk areas were delineated with the aid of tetrazolium chloride staining and fluorescent Zn-Cd particles. Infarct size was expressed in percent of the area at risk. All the animals without preconditioning developed an infarct size ranging between 36.3+/-2.4% and 49.6+/-7.6% (P=NS) and all the preconditioning groups developed an infarct size ranging between 14.9+/-1.2% and 21.0+/-2.2% (P=NS). All the preconditioning groups, independently of the use of beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists, had a smaller infarct size than the control group, which developed an infarct size of 47.3+/-2.5% (P<0.01). Intravenous atenolol and esmolol, independent of timing and mode of administration, does not seem to interfere with protection afforded by ischemic preconditioning in vivo.", 
    "48": "Most previous studies of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) pharmacology using primary leukocyte cultures and myeloid cell lines do not differentiate between leukotriene BLT1 and BLT2 receptor activation because both receptors are often expressed by these cells. Here we show that in HeLa cells expressing BLT1 but not BLT2 receptors, BLT1 receptor activation resulted in IP3 mediated calcium release from intracellular stores initially, followed by calcium influx through cell membrane channels. BLT1 calcium signalling was sensitive to the activity of protein kinase C (PKC), protein kinase A (PKA) and protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs), as well as changes in membrane cholesterol levels and treatments that are known to disrupt normal membrane physiology and/or lipid rafts. Inhibition of MAP kinases, Rho-associated kinases, or phosphoinositol-3-kinases (PI3K) had no effect on BLT1 receptor induced calcium signalling, and the receptor was insensitive to the redox state of the extracellular compartment.",

After 3 months of nonrandomized allocation to antihypertensive treatment (20 nonpharmacologic, 36 beta-blockers, 33 angiotensin receptor blocker), oxidized/reduced glutathione ratio and malondialdehyde were significantly reduced, and the activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase was significantly increased in both whole blood and peripheral mononuclear cells. The content of damaged base 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA in hypertensive subjects was also significantly reduced during the antihypertensive treatment. In a group of 42 subjects, the oxidative stress was further reduced and the antioxidant enzyme activities further increased after 12 months of antihypertensive treatment. The changes were independent of the kind of antihypertensive treatment. In conclusion, antihypertensive treatment improved the increased oxidative stress and the decreased antioxidant mechanisms. It is independent of the type of treatment and the beneficial effect of treatment increases over time.", 
    "51": "The fragmental constant approach (FCA) was used to calculate water-sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelle partition coefficients, K(mw), for uncharged solutes from their structure. Subsequently, the availability of K(mw) values allows prediction of retention factor, k, in micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) using the simple relationship k = K(mw)phi, where phi is the phase ratio. The FCA model describes a micelle-water partition coefficient as the sum of the partition coefficients of the constituent atomic/molecular fragments, measured by fragmental constant values, f (i), as well as correction factors to account for various \"intramolecular effects\" that cause deviations from the predicted partition coefficients as, log K(mw) = sum(n)(i=1)aif i+sum(m)(i=1)kiCm. The fragmental constants for a set of 41 fragments were determined using a training set of 229 aromatic solutes and 198 aliphatic compounds. The K(mw) of the aromatic compounds in the training set were determined by MEKC, while the K(mw) of the aliphatic solutes were estimated using the linear solvation energy relationship (LSER) for the SDS micelles. The fragments consisted of both aromatic fragments (i.e., directly attached to an aromatic ring) and aliphatic fragments. The FCA predictions agree nicely with the observed and LSER partition coefficient values, even for complex molecular structures such as beta-blocker drugs. The results show the great potential of the FCA for a priori prediction of retention behavior in MEKC from solute structure.",

    "53": "A dynamic retrospective cohort was assembled from persons aged 66 years and over surviving myocardial infarction in Quebec between 1990 and 1993. Information on hospitalizations was linked to medication and physician claims, demographic characteristics and vital status. Subjects prescribed beta-blockers at hospital discharge had fewer comorbid medical conditions, less pre-existing cardiovascular disease and less severe infarcts. To control for these differences, analyzes were restricted to subjects receiving at least one beta-blocker and mortality was compared between periods with and without beta-blocker exposure using Cox proportional hazard models.", 
    "54": "Among 14,547 survivors of myocardial infarction, 41% were dispensed at least one beta-blocker. Among those subjects, the risk of dying during periods of beta-blocker use was reduced 40% (hazard ratio = 0.6; 95% CI: 0.5, 0.7).", 
    "55": "Confounding by indication threatens the validity of observational studies of intended effects of medications. For elderly survivors of myocardial infarction, the estimated benefit of beta-blockers from observational studies is greater than the estimate from randomized trials. Greater benefits do not seem to be an artifact arising from systematically prescribing beta-blockers to subjects with better prognosis. Reducing confounding by indication can enhance the validity of observational studies of medications and widen research applications of administrative health databases. While the actual benefits of medications are never truly known these studies can provide a credible range that brackets the truth.", 
    "56": "Hypertension and lipid disorders in type II diabetes contribute to increased coronary risk, but optimal drug therapy has not been defined. We investigated primary care physicians choices of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy for subjects with type II diabetes diagnosed with hypertension. Subjects were registered with 105 UK general practices in the General Practice Research Database and prescribed oral hypoglycaemic drugs for the first time between January 1993 and December 2001. We evaluated prescriptions for antihypertensive drugs in subjects with secondary diagnoses of hypertension in the first year following initiation of oral hypoglycaemic therapy. Data were analysed for 4519 diabetic subjects with diagnosed hypertension. Between 1993 and 2001, the proportion prescribed thiazide diuretics increased from 20 to 30%; angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors from 35 to 45% and angiotensin receptor blockers from 0 to 8%. The proportion of subjects prescribed lipid-lowering therapy increased from 8% in 1993 to 33% in 2001, with the proportion prescribed statins increasing from 1 to 30%. At different general practices, the proportion prescribed thiazide diuretics ranged from 0 to 52%, beta-blockers from 5 to 60%, ACE inhibitors from 15 to 81%, and statins from 0 to 50%. Variation between practices was not explained by adjusting for age, sex, prevalent coronary heart disease or study year. Trends in drug utilisation were consistent with the evolving evidence base but there were wide variations in drug utilisation between practices. A more consistent approach to drug selection might be associated with improved patient outcomes.",

    "58": "A total of 47 NTG patients (47 eyes) were randomly assigned to receive Lat alone (25 eyes) or Tg alone (22 eyes). IOP was measured at fixed time points during 24 hours before and after treatment with each drug. In addition, blood pressure and pulse rate were measured before and after treatment.", 
    "59": "Lat reduced IOP significantly at all time points of measurement. Tg reduced IOP significantly at all time points of measurement except at 22:00 and 03:00. Percent reductions in the IOP at 03:00 and in the mean diurnal IOP were significantly greater in the Lat group than in the Tg group. In the Lat group there was no change in diastolic pressure or pulse rate after treatment, but in the Tg group these parameters decreased significantly.",

    "61": "The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a method for separately evaluating the roles of gastrointestinal absorption and hepatic extraction as barriers to oral bioavailability (BA). The method was validated using five reference compounds known to have different absorption and hepatic extraction properties. Dose-dependence was also investigated for one reference compound.", 
    "62": "Five reference compounds, amoxicillin, antipyrine, atenolol, propranolol, and testosterone, were administered as a cassette intravenouly (IV), via the hepatoportal vein (IPV), intraduodenally (ID), and intracolonically (IC) to male Sprague-Dawley rats. Blood samples were taken at nine time points, and the compounds were extracted from plasma using solid phase extraction. Plasma concentrations of each compound were determined using Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Pharmacokinetic parameters including bioavailability were calculated for each compound for each route of administration.", 
    "63": "Testosterone BA was less than 10% by ID, IC, and IPV routes, due to high hepatic extraction, consistent with its high systemic clearance (63 ml x min(-1) x kg(-1)) and short terminal plasma half-life (23 min). The IPV BA of amoxicillin was 95%+/-6% indicating the absence of hepatic extraction in the rat, but with an ID BA of approximately 39% suggesting incomplete GI absorption to be the main barrier to bioavailability. Absorption was poor from the colon, demonstrating site-dependence consistent with literature reports of site-dependent absorption. Low oral BA of propranolol was due in part to first-pass hepatic extraction (IPV BA of 36%). The IPV BA of propranolol was dose-dependent, most likely due to saturation of the P450 enzymes. Atenolol was incompletely bioavailable due to incomplete intestinal absorption, with no contribution of hepatic first-pass metabolism. Antipyrine was highly bioavailable by all routes.", 
    "64": "This in vivo rat model is demonstrated to be useful for identifying and quantifying the causes of incomplete bioavailabilty. It separately evaluates intestinal absorption, hepatic extraction, and site-dependent absorption. Concentration-dependence of saturable processes can also be examined.", 
    "65": "The prevalence of diabetes is increasing, and patients with diabetes are at increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Recently, the results from 11 large randomized clinical trials have suggested a difference in the emergence of new diabetes according to cardiovascular medication use. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium antagonists yielded a lower incidence of diabetes development than beta-blockers and diuretics. Physicians should consider this possible diabetes consequence when prescribing long-term beta-blockers and diuretics, particularly in patients at high risk of developing diabetes.", 
    "66": "Patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) have a resting restrictive ventilatory defect. Any type of exercise requires patients with CHF to markedly increase their minute ventilation. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have airflow obstruction that leads to dynamic lung hyperinflation and reduced ventilatory response to exercise. Because exercise is associated with abnormally high minute ventilation in patients with CHF and with a limited minute ventilation increase in patients with COPD, functional capacity is severely impaired in patients with coexistent CHF and COPD. Optimal treatment of both conditions is a prerequisite to maximally improve functional capacity in patients with CHF and COPD. Unfortunately, beta-adrenergic blockade, the current cornerstone of CHF therapy, is frequently omitted in patients with CHF and COPD for fear of inducing bronchoconstriction. Furthermore, when prescribed, beta-adrenergic blockade is often attempted with a moderate dose of metoprolol tartrate, a beta-1-blocker that results in lesser clinical benefits than combined non-selective beta-blockade with carvedilol at the maximally recommended dose. Recent experience indicates that combined non-selective beta- and alpha-blockade with carvedilol is well tolerated in patients with COPD who do not have reversible airway obstruction. Alpha-adrenergic blockade may promote mild bronchodilation that offsets non-selective beta blockade-induced bronchoconstriction in patients with obstructive airway disease.",

    "69": "The aim of the present study was to develop an experimental paradigm for the study of serotonergic neurotransmission in humans using positron emission tomography and the 5-HT2A selective radioligand [18F]altanserin. [18F]altanserin studies were conducted in seven subjects using the bolus/infusion approach designed for attaining steady state in blood and brain 2 hours after the initial [18F]altanserin administration. Three hours after commencement of radiotracer administration, 0.25 mg/kg of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, citalopram (Lundbeck, Valby, Denmark), was administered to all subjects as a constant infusion for 20 minutes. To reduce 5-HT1A-mediated autoinhibition of cortical 5-HT release, four of the seven subjects were pretreated with the partial 5-HT1A agonist pindolol for 3 days at an increasing oral dose (25 mg on the day of scanning). In each subject, the baseline condition (120 to 180 minutes) was compared with the stimulated condition (195 to 300 minutes). Despite a pronounced increase in plasma prolactin and two subjects reporting hot flushes compatible with an 5-HT-induced adverse effect, cortical [18F]altanserin binding was insensitive to the citalopram challenge, even after pindolol pretreatment. The biochemical and cellular events possibly affecting the unsuccessful translation of the citalopram/pindolol challenge into a change in 5-HT2A receptor binding of [18F]altanserin are discussed.", 
    "70": "Allopregnanolone is a progesterone metabolite and GABA-A receptor modulator with benzodiazepine like effects, including decreased learning and memory. In vitro 3beta-hydroxypregnane steroids antagonize allopregnanolone-induced effects, but no antagonism has been shown in vivo. Our purpose was to evaluate 3beta-20beta-dihydroxy-5alpha-pregnane (UC1011) as a blocker of allopregnanolone-induced effects in vivo and in vitro in rats. We tested adult male Wistar rats in the Morris water maze 8 min after daily injections (i.v.) of allopregnanolone 2 mg/kg (n = 21); allopregnanolone : UC1011 2 : 6 (n = 7), 2 : 8 (n = 7), 2 : 20 (n = 14) mg/kg; UC1011 20 mg/kg (n = 14); or vehicle (10% 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin, n = 4). Studies of chloride ion uptake into cortical and hippocampal membrane preparations were performed. The latency to find the hidden platform was still high in the allopregnanolone-injected group on day 6. Day 3-6 rats injected with allopregnanolone and UC1011 (2 : 20 mg/kg) had lower latency (P < 0.05), compared to the allopregnanolone-injected group. The group that only received UC1011 learned the location of the platform as fast as the controls. There was no significant difference in swim speed between groups. The time spent swimming close to the pool wall was in the allopregnanolone : UC1011 group (2 : 20 mg/kg) significantly decreased (P < 0.05, day 3-6), compared to the allopregnanolone-injected group. The increased chloride ion uptake induced by increasing dosage of allopregnanolone in the presence of 10 micro m GABA was significantly decreased with UC1011 (P < 0.01), in both cortical and hippocampal homogenates. In conclusion, UC1011 can via antagonism at the GABA-A receptor reduce the negative allopregnanolone effect on learning in the water maze.", 
    "71": "To identify and characterize 'reversal' of optic nerve cupping following intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering in scanning laser tomography (SLT) longitudinal image series.", 
    "72": "Modification was made to a previously described analytical approach to longitudinally study putatively increased rim area following IOP lowering. Sustained IOP reduction of 25% was by topical medication. Forty SLT image series with equivalent follow up were assessed: 10 with ocular hypertension (OHT), 10 with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), and as controls, 20 normal. Reproducible rim area reversal was identified by sector and its time-course over 1 year examined.", 
    "73": "By a 2-of-3 reproducibility criterion, reversal following IOP lowering was confirmed in about a third of treated eyes (POAG and OHT) but not in any controls. Rim sectors showing reversal were mostly nasal, with a few occurring superotemporally. Reversal in a fifth of treated eyes persisted for at least 1 year; all these were in the nasal half of the disc. The number of sectors with persisting reversal affected less than 6% of all treated eyes' rim sectors.", 
    "74": "Rim area is not uncommonly increased after IOP lowering and this 'reversal' may persist for at least a year. Within topically treated eyes having IOP lowering of at least 25%, the proportion of rim sectors with persistent reversal appears small. Nevertheless, the effects of IOP reduction on topography, especially in the short term, should be considered when longitudinally assessing progressive rim loss in SLT images.", 
    "75": "Past studies have suggested that the adrenergic system becomes abnormally activated in chronic volume overload, such as in severe aortic valve regurgitation (AR). However, the effectiveness of agents directed against this adrenergic activation has never been adequately tested in chronic AR. We therefore tested the effects of metoprolol treatment on the left ventricular (LV) function and remodeling in severe chronic AR in rats.", 
    "76": "Severe AR was created in adult male Wistar rats by retrograde puncture of the aortic leaflets under echocardiographic guidance. Two weeks later, some animals received metoprolol treatment (25 mg/kg) orally for 24 weeks, and some were left untreated. LV dimensions, ejection fraction, and filling parameters were evaluated by echocardiography. Hearts were harvested at 1, 2, 14, and 180 days for the evaluation of hypertrophy, beta-adrenergic receptor status, and extracellular matrix remodeling. We found that metoprolol treatment prevented LV dilatation and preserved the ejection fraction and filling parameters compared with untreated animals. Metoprolol increased the expression of beta1-adrenoreceptor mRNA and reduced G protein receptor kinase 2 levels. Collagen I and III mRNA levels were reduced. Cardiac myocyte hypertrophy was also prevented.", 
    "77": "In our experimental model of severe AR, metoprolol treatment had a significant beneficial global effect on LV remodeling and function. These results suggest that the adrenergic system is important in the development of volume-overload cardiomyopathy in AR and that adrenergic-blocking agents may play a role in the treatment of this disease.", 
    "78": "Biological age is a strong determinant of prognosis in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We sought to examine the impact of age after primary percutaneous coronary intervention in AMI and to determine whether routine coronary stent implantation and/or platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors improve clinical outcomes in elderly patients after primary angioplasty.", 
    "79": "In the CADILLAC trial, 2082 patients with AMI were randomized to balloon angioplasty, angioplasty plus abciximab, stenting alone, or stenting plus abciximab. No patient was excluded on the basis of advanced age; patients ranging from 21 to 95 years of age were enrolled. One-year mortality increased for each decile of age, exponentially after 65 years of age (1.6% for patients <55 years, 2.1% for 55 to 65 years, 7.1% for 65 to 75 years, 11.1% for patients >75 years; P<0.0001). Elderly patients also had increased rates of stroke and major bleeding compared with their younger counterparts. Among elderly patients (> or =65 years), 1-year rates of ischemic target revascularization (7.0% versus 17.6%; P<0.0001) and subacute or late thrombosis (0% versus 2.2%; P=0.005) were reduced with stenting compared with balloon angioplasty. Routine abciximab administration, although safe, was not of definite benefit in elderly patients. Rates of mortality, reinfarction, disabling stroke, and major bleeding in the elderly were independent of reperfusion modality.", 
    "80": "Despite contemporary mechanical reperfusion strategies, mortality, major bleeding, and stroke rates remain high in elderly patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention, outcomes that are not affected by stents or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. By reducing restenosis, however, stent implantation improves clinical outcomes in elderly patients with AMI.", 
    "81": "Incorporation of [3H]thymidine into trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-insoluble material of the parotid and submandibular glands was used as an index of mitotic activity following unilateral electrical stimulation of the sympathetic innervation (20 Hz, 4 min every fifth minute over 34 min). Stimulation under beta-adrenoceptor blockade (propranolol 2 mg/kg, intravenous) alone or combined with alpha-adrenoceptor blockade (phentolamine 2 mg/kg, intravenous) did not increase the rate of [3H]thymidine incorporation into the two types of glands. However, under alpha-adrenoceptor blockade the [3H]thymidine incorporation increased into the parotid glands, by 122% (compared to the glands on the contralateral side), but not into the submandibular glands. In the presence of the neuronal type NO-synthase (nNOS) blocker N-PLA (30 mg/kg, intravenous) or the unselective NO-synthase blocker L-NAME (30 mg/kg, intravenous), this increase was reduced to 49 and 47%, respectively. Thus, the major part of the sympathetically nerve-evoked beta-adrenoceptor-mediated mitotic response was found to depend on the activity of neuronal type NO-synthase to generate NO. Since the sympathetic nerve fibres of the parotid gland lack NO-synthase, the neuronal type NO-synthase subjected to the inhibitors is likely to be of parenchymal origin.", 
    "82": "Ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonists, L-aspartic acid (L-Asp) and NMDA, have been shown to inhibit histamine-stimulated acid secretion, but their effect on gastric mucosal blood flow (GMBF) is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate whether L-Asp and NMDA inhibit histamine-stimulated GMBF and to examine the expression patterns of NMDA receptor subunits NR1, NR2A, and NR2B in rat stomach. Laser Doppler flowmetry was used to measure gastric blood flow in anesthetized rats. The GMBF was assessed during an intravenous infusion of histamine in the presence of tripelennamine. The effects of L-Asp and NMDA on histamine-induced gastric blood flow were examined. In addition, the distribution patterns of NR1-, NR2A-, and NR2B-contaning NMDA receptors in rat stomach were determined immunohistochemically by using specific antibodies against NR1, NR2A, and NR2B. Histamine-induced enhancement of GMBF depended on acid secretion and the activation of H(2)-receptors. Neither L-Asp nor NMDA had an effect on the spontaneous GMBF. However, L-Asp and NMDA reduced the histamine-induced increase in GMBF. DL-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP-5), an NMDA receptor antagonist; and prazosin, an alpha(1)-receptor antagonist; but not propanolol, a beta(2)-receptor antagonist; or yohimbine, a alpha(2)-receptor antagonist; reversed the inhibitory effect of L-Asp and NMDA on the histamine-induced increase in GMBF. Therefore, L-Asp and NMDA inhibit histamine-induced GMBF via a mechanism involving the activation of NMDA receptors and alpha(1)- adrenoceptors. The fact that NMDA receptor subunits NR1, NR2A, and NR2B were found to be localized in the rat stomach as visualized immunohistochemically with specific antibodies against NR1, NR2A, and NR2B is consistent with this hypothesis.", 
    "83": "Host molecule 1 displays a high affinity in water towards catecholamines and especially related structures such as beta-blockers with extended aromatic pi-faces (up to 7x10(3) M(-1) for each single complexation step or 5x10(7) M(-2) for both steps). The amphiphilic structural design leads to an extensive self-association of host molecules through their aromatic flanks. Above a cmc (critical micelle concentration) of 3x10(-4) M, host 1 forms micelles that produce a favorable microenvironment for hydrophobic interactions with the included guest molecules. Electrostatic attraction of the ammonium alcohol by the phosphonate anions is thus combined with hydrophobic contributions between the aromatic moieties. Ionic hydrogen bonds with polar OH or NH groups of the guest enforce the non-covalent interactions, and finally lead to increased specificity. Both its affinity and its selectivity towards adrenergic receptor substrates are greatly enhanced if the receptor molecule 1 is transferred from water into a lipid monolayer. Catecholamines and beta-blockers lead to drastically different effects at concentrations approaching the micromolar regime. Especially beta-blockers with minute structural changes can be easily distinguished from each other. In both cases, extensive hydrophobic interactions with a self-associated and/or self-organized microenvironment are largely responsible for the observed high efficiency and specificity.", 
    "84": "The influence of using normal-phase and reversed-phase versions of four commercial polysaccharide stationary phases on chiral separations was investigated with capillary electrochromatography (CEC). Both versions of the stationary phases, Chiralcel OD, OJ, and Chiralpak AD, AS were tested for the separation of two basic, two acidic, a bifunctional, and a neutral compound. Different background electrolytes were used, two at low pH for the acid, bifunctional and neutral substances, and three at high pH for the basic, bifunctional and neutral ones. This setup allowed evaluating differences between both stationary-phase versions and between mobile-phase compositions on a chiral separation. Duplicate CEC columns of each stationary phase were in-house prepared and tested, giving information about the intercolumn reproducibility. In general, reversed-phase versions of the current commercial polysaccharide stationary phases are found to be best for reversed-phase CEC, even though at high pH no significant differences were seen between both versions. Most differences were observed at low pH. For acidic compounds, it was seen that an ammonium formate electrolyte performed best, which is also an excellent electrolyte if coupling with mass spectrometry is desired. For basic, bifunctional and neutral compounds, no significant differences between the three tested electrolytes were observed at high pH. Here, a phosphate buffer is preferred as electrolyte because of its buffering capacities. However, if coupling to mass spectrometry is wanted, the more volatile ammonium bicarbonate electrolyte can be used as an alternative.", 
    "85": "The effectiveness of Triton X-102 (TX-102), as a structural modifier of the polymeric surfactant sodium undecanoyl-L-leucinate (L-SUL) was investigated for enhanced enantiomeric recognition of various chiral compounds in micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC). Increasing concentrations of TX-102 were separately added into the micellar solutions of L-SUL and then polymerized to form poly-L-SUL. The resulting polymers were purified by use of 3500 molecular-weight-cutoff (MWCO) dialysis membranes. Fluorescence and pulsed field gradient-nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG-NMR) techniques were used to elucidate the structural effects of TX-102 on poly-L-SUL. Evaluation of data from fluorescence measurements suggested an increase in polarity with increasing concentration of TX-102. However, the polarity decreased at higher concentrations of TX-102. Evaluation of data from PFG-NMR suggested an increase in hydrodynamic radius upon increasing the concentration of TX-102. The racemates of coumarinic and phenythiohydantoin amino acid derivatives, and pindolol were used as test analytes in MEKC. A notable increase in resolution and capacity factors of the test analytes was observed when the modified poly-L-SUL was used in MEKC measurements. Examination of the data obtained from fluorescence, PFG-NMR, and MEKC suggests a strong correlation between the polarity and the hydrodynamic radii of TX-102 modified micelles and the enantiomeric resolution of the test analytes.", 
    "86": "The enantiomeric separation of a series of basic pharmaceuticals (beta-blockers, local anesthetics, sympathomimetics) has been investigated in nonaqueous capillary electrophoresis (NACE) systems using heptakis(2,3-di-O-methyl-6-O-sulfo)-beta-cyclodextrin (HDMS-beta-CD) in combination with potassium camphorsulfonate (camphorSO3-). For this purpose, a face-centered central composite design with 11 experimental points was applied. The effect of the concentrations of HDMS-beta-CD and camphorSO3- on enantioresolution was statistically evaluated and depended largely on the considered analyte. The presence of camphorSO3- was found to be particularly useful for the enantioseparation of compounds with high affinity for the anionic CD. CamphorSO3- seems to act as a competitor, reducing the affinity for the CD, probably by ion-pair formation with these analytes. For compounds with lower affinity for HDMS-beta-CD, the combination of camphorSO3- and the CD appeared to have a favorable effect on enantioresolution only if the optimal CD concentration could be reached. On the other hand, for compounds characterized by a very low affinity for the anionic CD, the association of camphorSO3- and HDMS-beta-CD is always unfavorable. Finally, experimental conditions were selected by means of the multivariate approach in order to obtain the highest resolution (Rs) value for each studied compound.",

    "88": "Vasorelaxation to beta(2)-adrenoceptor stimulation occurs through both endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent mechanisms, and the former is mediated through Ca(2+)-independent activation of endothelial-type nitric oxide synthase (NOS-3). Since Ca(2+)-independent NOS-3 activation may occur through its serine phosphorylation via protein kinase A (PKA) or Akt, we determined the PKA and Akt dependency of beta(2)-adrenergic relaxation of rat aorta. Rat aortic rings were pre-incubated with the PKA inhibitor H-89 (10(-7) m), the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor wortmannin (5 x 10(-7) m), Akt inhibitor (10(-5) m), or vehicle, in the absence or presence of the NOS inhibitor N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME, 10(-4) m). Rings were then contracted with phenylephrine (10(-7) m), and concentration-relaxation responses determined to the beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist albuterol. Rings exhibited a concentration-dependent relaxation to albuterol: pEC(50) 6.9+/-0.2, E(max) 88.2+/-4.0%. l-NAME attenuated E(max) to 60.2+/-3.5% (P<0.001). In the presence of l-NAME, wortmannin or Akt inhibitor did not influence albuterol responses, whereas H-89 reduced E(max) further, to 27.5+/-2.2% (P<0.001). In the absence of l-NAME, E(max) to albuterol was reduced by H-89, wortmannin or Akt inhibitor, to 56.2+/-2.2, 56.0+/-1.6 and 55.4+/-1.8%, respectively (P<0.001 for each); the combinations H-89 plus wortmannin or H-89 plus Akt inhibitor reduced E(max) further still. Western blotting of NOS-3 immunoprecipitates from rat aortas confirmed that albuterol increased serine phosphorylation of NOS-3, and this increase was attenuated by H-89 or Akt inhibitor. Our results indicate that beta(2)-adrenoceptor stimulation relaxes rat aorta through both NO-dependent and independent mechanisms. The latter is predominantly PKA-mediated, whereas the former occurs through both PKA and PI3K/Akt activation.", 
    "89": "During brain development, neurotransmitters act as trophic factors controlling the patterns of cell replication and differentiation. Alpha2-adrenoceptors (alpha2ARs) are transiently overexpressed in zones with high mitotic activity and we evaluated whether these receptors are linked to DNA synthesis in the perinatal rat brain. Acute administration of clonidine (2 mg/kg), an alpha2AR agonist, elicited dramatic decreases in DNA synthesis in the forebrain, brainstem, and cerebellum whether given on gestational day (GD) 21, or on postnatal days (PN) 1 or 8. However, alpha2AR blockade elicited by yohimbine (2.5 mg/kg) also resulted in decreased DNA synthesis on GD21 and PN8, albeit to a smaller extent than with clonidine. Yohimbine was able to blunt the effects of clonidine, verifying that both drugs are acting through the same receptor population. Because betaARs are also known to regulate DNA synthesis, we used propranolol (10 mg/kg) blockade of betaARs to evaluate whether the alpha2AR effects were mediated by presynaptic autoreceptors that regulate the release of norepinephrine and consequent betaAR responses; the effects of yohimbine were still discernible in the presence of propranolol. Accordingly, transiently overexpressed alpha2ARs in the developing brain participate in the control of DNA synthesis in a biphasic manner, with promotional actions at low, endogenous levels of stimulation, but inhibitory effects when stimulation is high. Effects on alpha2ARs are likely to contribute to long-term consequences of adrenergic agents used in obstetrics or neurotoxicants that affect adrenergic activity.", 
    "90": "Despite major advances in treatment options for heart failure patients, morbidity and mortality remain unacceptably high. Frequent readmissions are distressful for patients and are associated with large costs for society. In an attempt to improve care for heart failure patients and thereby reduce morbidity and hospital readmissions, specialised heart failure clinics have emerged over the last 10 years. In particular, clinics relying, at least in part, on nurses specially trained in heart failure have gained popularity. This review of the published literature describes the wide variety of designs and the types of interventions taking place in such heart failure clinics. A total of 18 randomised studies comparing heart failure clinics using nurse intervention with conventional care have been published to date, and the majority of these have shown either a reduction in hospital readmissions or shortening of hospitalisations in the intervention group. These findings are supported by the results of several non-randomised, controlled investigations. Thus, it is concluded that heart failure clinics using nurse intervention should be an integrated part of the care process for patients with heart failure wherever possible. We argue that ongoing attention should be paid to the quality of care delivered by the clinics to ensure that the benefit of this intervention strategy persists. Thus, it would be of importance to continuously record relevant data describing the care process using specific indicators such as ACE-inhibitor and beta-blocker use and doses. One possible, practical method to apply such continuous quality assurance may be by means of electronic medical record databases.",

    "93": "We studied 570 patients (mean age 69+/-9 years, 486 males) who underwent AAA-surgery between 1991 and 2001 at the Erasmus MC. Patients were evaluated for clinical risk factors (age>70 years, histories of MI, angina, diabetes mellitus, stroke, renal failure, heart failure and pulmonary disease), DSE, statin and beta-blocker use. The main outcome was a composite of perioperative mortality and MI within 30 days of surgery.", 
    "94": "Perioperative mortality or MI occurred in 51 (8.9%) patients. The incidence of the composite endpoint was significantly lower in statin users compared to nonusers (3.7% vs. 11.0%; crude odds ratio (OR): 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.13-0.74; p=0.01). After correcting for other covariates, the association between statin use and reduced incidence of the composite endpoint remained unchanged (OR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.10-0.70; p=0.01). Beta-blocker use was also associated with a significant reduction in the composite endpoint (OR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.11-0.54). Patients using a combination of statins and beta-blockers appeared to be at lower risk for the composite endpoint across multiple cardiac risk strata; particularly patients with 3 or more risk factors experienced significantly lower perioperative events.",

    "96": "The extension of contactless conductivity detection in electrophoresis to the determination of basic drugs is demonstrated using beta-adrenergic blocking agents (beta-blockers) and other physiologically active amines as examples. The high-voltage approach to conductivity detection was employed for conventional capillaries as well as microchip devices. Acidic buffers were used in all cases. A buffer consisting of 100 mM acetic acid and 1 mM histidine was deemed most optimal for the separation of six beta-blockers and best results for the analysis of the other amines were achieved with a 20 mM lactic acid buffer at low pH-value. The detection limits ranged from 0.06 to 5 microM. To demonstrate potential practical applications, a main component assay was conducted for three pharmaceutical formulations. On-chip, five pharmaceutical amines could be baseline-resolved in a 8 cm long microchannel in 90 s, albeit a reduced sensitivity and peak capacity compared to conventional capillary electrophoresis.",

The in vitro effects of labetolol, hydralazine, alpha-methyldopa, nifedepine and magnesium sulphate (at concentration ranges from 1 nanomolar to 1 millimolar), and their respective vehicle controls, were measured. Results were expressed as -logEC50 (pD2) and mean maximal inhibition values for each compound.", 
    "99": "All compounds investigated, except alpha methyldopa, exerted a significant relaxant effect on umbilical arterial tone.

The dose response curve of nifedipine yielded a significantly greater PD2 value when compared to that of hydralazine, labetalol, and magnesium sulphate (PD2 value [5.82+/-0.34] versus the above groups [range 3.10+/-0.09-3.52+/-0.14] (P <0.01)).", 
    "100": "These findings demonstrate that agents commonly used for the treatment of hypertensive disease in pregnancy, excluding alpha-methyldopa, have significant direct effects on the feto-placental circulation.

    "101": "Adenylyl cyclase signaling system (ACS) of the higher eukaryotes involves the following main components: receptor, heterotrimeric G protein, adenylyl cyclase (AC), and protein kinase A. At present, these components have been found in cells of different species of the lower eukaryotes. Hence, the signal transduction through ACS of unicellular eukaryotes may have some features in common with those of the higher eukaryotes. We showed earlier that agonists of adrenergic receptors (ARs) regulate AC activity of ciliates Dileptus anser and Tetrahymena pyriformis. The aim of this work was to study molecular mechanisms of AR ligand action on the functional activity of different components of ACS of the ciliates. It has been shown that beta-AR antagonist [3H]-dihydroalprenolol binds membranes of the ciliates with a comparatively lower affinity than those of the higher eukaryotes (Kd for D. anser was 13.4 nM, for T. pyriformis--27 nM). Beta-AR ligands--agonist (-)-isoproterenol and antagonists propranolol and atenolol in competition manner displace [3H]-dihydroalprenolol with IC50 that are 10-100 times higher than corresponding IC50 of beta-AR of the higher eukaryotes. In the presence of GTP, the right shift of competition curves of [3H]-dihydroalprenolol displacement by isoproterenol was obtained, being most considerable in the case of D. anser. Adrenaline and isoproterenol in a dose-dependent manner stimulated GTP-binding in cell cultures of D. anser and T. pyriformis. Suramin (10(-5) M), the inhibitor of heterotrimeric G proteins, completely blocked effects of these hormones. In D. anser culture, adrenaline and isoproterenol in a dose-dependent manner, stimulated AC activity, and its stimulating effects in the presence of beta-AR blockers vanished (propranolol) or decreased to a great extent (atenolol). At the same time the effects were unchanged in the presence of alpha2-AR antagonists yohimbine and idazoxan. These data show the involvement of G protein-coupled beta-AR in signal transduction induced by AR agonists in D. anser cells. In cell culture of T. pyriformis isoproterenol weakly stimulated AC activity, and its effect was completely blocked by beta-AR blockers. Adrenaline in T. pyriformis cells in a dose-dependent manner inhibited AC activity. Inhibiting effect of hormone was decreased in the presence of alpha2-AR blockers. On the basis of the obtained data we concluded that adrenaline in T. pyriformis cells inhibited AC activity through G protein-coupled receptor, being close to alpha2-AR of vertebrate animals.", 
    "102": "Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a heart muscle disease characterized by ventricular dilation and dysfunction, is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity. In the present paper we will consider the main results of studies on the natural history of DCM in 581 consecutive patients prospectively enrolled and systematically followed in the Heart Muscle Disease Registry of Trieste in the last 25 years. In the last decades prognosis of DCM significantly improved over time, mainly as a consequence of optimized treatment with ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers. However, a strong heterogeneity of prognosis was observed among patients both in familial and sporadic cases. Early diagnosis and treatment allowed to recognize two distinct subgroups, one with a rapidly progressive downhill course, high mortality and urgent indication to heart transplantation, another with a more favorable outcome. Long-term optimized treatment with ACE-inhibitors (in 90% of cases) and beta-blockers (in 87% of cases) was associated with a remarkable clinical improvement in 50% of patients and apparent \"healing\" in 16% of cases. A systematic and accurate echocardiographic follow-up showed in these cases a significant improvement of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with \"reverse remodeling\", frequently associated with a decrease of severity of functional mitral regurgitation and regression of the restrictive filling pattern. The response to optimal treatment showed a strong relation to long-term outcome. The 8-year transplant-free survival, starting from the evaluation at 2 years, was 31% in patients with persistent NYHA class III-IV, 64% in NYHA class I-II and LVEF < or = 40%, 83% in NYHA class I-II and LVEF > 40% and 94% in patients with apparent \"healing\" (p < 0.0001). Long-term follow-up showed a significant clinical progression of the disease in 33% of cases, independently of the initial clinical response to treatment. Predictive factors of a favorable response to beta-blocker treatment associated with ACE-inhibitors were a history of mild hypertension, an early diagnosis and treatment and the presence of sinus tachycardia. The risk of sudden death was increased particularly in patients with long-term persistent or progressive left ventricular dilation and dysfunction. A rigorous pharmacological approach (optimization of beta-blockers, withdrawal or decrease of dosage of digitalis), and selective non-pharmacological strategy (automated implantable cardioverter-defibrillators for primary prevention in high-risk patients) are potentially effective to decrease the incidence of sudden death during long-term follow-up. In conclusion, the Heart Muscle Disease Registry of Trieste gave us in the last 25 years new insights into the natural history of DCM, underlying the importance of a rigorous and systematic approach both at clinical presentation and during long-term follow-up on optimized medical treatment.", 
    "103": "Here, we have found that type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (D2) is present in rat aorta media and that there is a circadian variation in the D2 expression. The D2 mRNA was approximately 4-fold higher at 0900 h than at 2100 h, and the activity was approximately 6-fold higher at noon than at 2100 h. The increase in aorta media D2 activity is preceded by the increase in its mRNA. The increase in D2 mRNA and activity in the circadian variation was reduced by the administration of prazosin, an alpha1-adrenergic antagonist, and propranolol, a beta- adrenergic antagonist. Furthermore, phenylephrine, an alpha1-adrenergic agonist, and isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist, caused a significant increase in D2 mRNA and activity. In the hypothyroid rats, aorta mediae D2 mRNA at both 0900 and 2100 h were not significantly different when compared with those in the euthyroid rats. On the other hand, aorta mediae D2 activity at both 1200 and 2100 h in the hypothyroid rats were approximately 2-fold higher. From these results, we suggest that D2 activity of rat aorta media is increased by both alpha1- and beta-adrenergic stimulation, at least partly, at the pretranslational level. We also suggest that both alpha1- and beta-adrenergic mechanisms may be involved, at least partly, in the circadian variation of the activity. In the hypothyroid state, the aorta media D2 activity is increased mainly by the posttranslational mechanism, and the similar circadian variation of the D2 expression is present as in the euthyroid state.",

In patients treated with betablockers, 40% appeared in the operating room with the most favorable heart rate (55-65 b/min). During surgical procedure, heart rate over 80 b/min was observed in more than 30% of patients with betablocker therapy. In patients eligible for betablocker therapy but untreated with these drugs, only 12% have received betablockers in the preoperative period.",

    "108": "The purpose of the study was to examine the capacities of correction of impaired lipid metabolism in patients with CHD receiving selective beta-adrenoblockers (beta-AB) by using an antiatherogenic milk-and-vegetable diet. According to the type of antiatherogenic diet, 67 patients were divided into 2 groups: 1) 42 patients were on an antiatherogenic vegetarian diet (a vegetarian group--VG) and 2) 25 patients received routine mixed diet No. 10c (a control group--CG). At the same time all the patients received similar antianginal drug therapy including the selective beta-AB atenolol in a dose of 50 mg/day. The vegetarian diet without special hypolipidemic therapy had a marked normalizing effect on the serum lipid spectrum in patients with CHD. Thus, in VG, by the end of treatment, the level of total cholesterol significantly decreased by 16% while in the controls it increased by 13%. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased in VG and decreased in CG, therefore the atherogenicity coefficient considerably rose. These were true for triglycerides and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. These parameters significantly decreased in VG (by more than 30%) and increased in CG (by 16%). Among the clinical symptoms, a more pronounced decrease in blood pressure in the patients on vegetarian diet and a more significant increase in their exercise tolerance. Balanced antiatherogenic milk-and-vegetable diet in patients with coronary heart disease prevents the hyperlipidemic effect caused by the selective beta-AB atenolol and it is an agent for preventing its negative effect on lipid metabolism.", 
    "109": "The study was undertaken to examine whether the drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system may be used in the combined treatment of patients with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA). The study covered 20 patients (mean age 46.6 +/- 7.3 years). The diagnosis in all the patients was verified by a complex of instrumental studies, including the determination of plasma aldosterone concentrations (PAC) and plasma renin activity (PRA), and topical diagnostic studies (ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and angiography). The patients were given spironolactone, dihydropyridine calcium blockers, and beta-adrenoblockers, then with the cross-over method, this combination was added by the angiotensin-I receptor blocker (ATRB) losartane or the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) lisinopril for 4 weeks. 24-hour blood pressure (BP) monitoring was used to evaluate the efficiency of therapy. In the combined therapy losartane, 50-100 mg/day, reduced systolic BP (SBP) by 8.4%, diastolic BP (DBP) by 11.1% while lisinopril, 10-20 mg/day lowered SBP and DBP by 7.6 and 9.9%, respectively. Both drugs improved the daily BP profile. When losartane or lisinopril added to the combined treatment, a therapeutic response was achieved in 15 (79%) and 14 (73.7%) patients, respectively. ARB and ACEI exert an antihypertensive effect in patients with IHA and they may be used in the combined treatment of this disease. The use of the above drugs may reduce the dose of spironolactone to the mean therapeutic one. The pathophysiological rationale for the use of ATRB for IHA is that the sensitivity of aldosterone secretion to the stimulating effect of angiotensin II is preserved despite the fact that the PAC is higher and PRA is lower.", 
    "110": "Norepinephrine (NE) plays a complex role in the behavioral state-dependent regulation of sensory processing. However, the role of forebrain NE action in modulating high-order sensory activity has not been directly addressed. In this study, we take advantage of the discrete, feedforward organization of the avian song system to identify a site and mechanism of NE action underlying state-dependent modulation of sensory processing. We have developed an experimental paradigm in which brief arousal repeatedly suppresses song system auditory responsiveness. Using pharmacological manipulations in vivo, we show that infusion of alpha-adrenergic antagonists into the NIf (nucleus interfacialis of the nidopallium), an auditory forebrain area, blocks this state-dependent modulation. We also demonstrate dose-dependent enhancement and suppression of song system auditory response properties by NE and adrenergic agonists. Our results demonstrate that noradrenergic release in a single forebrain area is a mechanism underlying behavioral state-dependent regulation of auditory processing in a neural system specialized for vocal learning.",

In a prospective controlled trial, 145 patients were randomly assigned to treatment with carvedilol, amiodarone, or placebo for 4 weeks before electrical cardioversion.

    "112": "The aim of this study was to investigate the importance of the type of plasticizer in polymer blends used for the coating of solid dosage forms, comparing a lipophilic and a hydrophilic plasticizer (dibutyl sebacate (DBS) and triethyl citrate (TEC)). In vitro drug release from propranolol hydrochloride (propranolol HCl)-loaded pellets coated with blends of ethyl cellulose (EC) and Eudragit L (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75 and 0:100 w/w) was investigated at low as well as at high pH. To better understand the underlying mass transport mechanisms, the physicochemical properties of the film coatings (e.g. mechanical resistance, water uptake and dry weight loss behavior) were determined. Interestingly, drug release strongly depended on the type of plasticizer. Importantly, not only the slope but also the shape of the release curves was affected, indicating that the chemical nature of the plasticizer plays a major role for the underlying drug release mechanisms. Diffusion through the intact polymer coatings and/or through water-filled cracks was found to be dominating for the control of drug release. The relative importance of these pathways strongly depended on the polymer blend ratio and type of plasticizer. In contrast to DBS, TEC rapidly leached out of the coatings, resulting in decreasing mechanical resistances of the films and, thus, facilitated crack formation. In addition, the hydrophilicity of the plasticizer significantly affected the water uptake behavior of the film coatings and, hence, changes in the coatings' toughness and drug permeability. Also the relative affinity of the plasticizer to the different polymers was found to be of significance. In contrast to TEC, DBS has a higher affinity to EC than to Eudragit L, resulting in potential redistributions of this plasticizer within the polymeric systems and changes in the release profiles during storage. Importantly, these effects could be avoided with appropriate curing conditions and preparation techniques for the coating dispersions.", 
    "113": "S-Nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) and 3-nitrooxypivaloyl acid were combined in the form of the respective amides with propranolol, in order to obtain prodrugs (NO-propranololes) with beta-receptor blocking properties of the latter compound with nitric oxide releasing properties of the former compounds. A respective nitratoester could not be synthesized, because it immediately rearranges to the amide after deprotection of the amino group. In vitro tests on porcine pulmonary arteries showed that both types of hybrid molecules (6, 12) elicited vasorelaxation, but the nitratoamide was less potent by more than one order of magnitude. The vasorelaxant effect of SNAP was more pronounced than that of the SNAP-hybrid (12), on the other hand the nitratoamide 6 was more potent than 3-nitrooxypivaloyl acid.", 
    "114": "Independent of the severity of coronary artery disease, diabetic patients have an increased risk of developing heart failure. This clinical entity has been considered to be a distinct disease process referred to as 'diabetic cardiomyopathy'. Experimental studies suggest that extensive metabolic perturbations may underlie both functional and structural alterations of the diabetic myocardium. Translational studies are, however, limited and only partly explain why diabetic patients are at increased risk of cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Although a range of diagnostic methods may help to characterize alterations in cardiac function in general, none are specific for the alterations in diabetes. Treatment paradigms are very much limited to interpretation and translation from the results of interventions in non-diabetic patients with heart failure. This suggests that there is an urgent need to conduct pathogenetic, diagnostic and therapeutic studies specifically in diabetic patients with cardiomyopathy to better understand the factors which initiate and progress diabetic cardiomyopathy and to develop more effective treatments.",

    "119": "To investigate the mechanism responsible for the increased bioavailability of propranolol in bilateral ureter-ligated (BUL) rats, the intestinal absorption and hepatic extraction of propranolol and metoprolol were evaluated. The initial absorption rate of these drugs after intra-intestinal administration was only slightly increased in the BUL rats, whereas the blood drug concentration in these rats was higher than that in control rats. The blood propranolol and metoprolol concentrations during intra-portal infusion in the BUL rat were significantly higher than that in the control rat. In the presence of NADPH, the intrinsic metabolic activity of metoprolol in hepatic microsomes was not altered by BUL. On the other hand, the NADPH generation rate in the hepatic cytosol in the BUL group was lower than that in the control group. These results indicate that the absorption rate-dependent decrease in hepatic first-pass clearance of propranolol and metoprolol due to saturation kinetics is marginal, and that the hepatic metabolic activity and extraction of the drugs is significantly decreased in BUL rats probably due to the reduced NADPH generation rate in the liver.", 
    "120": "A biphasic cardiovascular response to bolus i.v. injection of human urotensin II (hUII, 3 nmol kg(-1)) in conscious, male, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats was identified and underlying mechanisms were explored. Initially (0-5 min) there was tachycardia, hypotension and mesenteric and hindquarters vasodilatation; later (30-120 min), tachycardia, hindquarters vasodilatation and a modest rise in blood pressure occurred. Pretreatment with indomethacin or N(G) nitro-l-arginine methylester (l-NAME) reduced the mesenteric vasodilator response to hUII, and abolished the late tachycardia and hindquarters vasodilatation. Indomethacin also abolished the hypotension and early hindquarters vasodilatation, and substantially reduced the initial tachycardia. Indomethacin and l-NAME together prevented all haemodynamic responses to hUII. Inhibition of inducible NOS had no effect on responses to hUII, whereas inhibition of neuronal NOS reduced the delayed tachycardic response to hUII but did not significantly affect the vasodilatation. Only the initial tachycardic response to hUII was antagonised by propranolol. In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), the initial haemodynamic responses to hUII were qualitatively similar to those in SD rats, although there was also a modest renal vasodilatation. The secondary response comprised a smaller tachycardia and a small rise in blood pressure, with no significant hindquarters vasodilatation. Haemodynamic responses to hUII were not enhanced by endothelin and angiotensin receptor antagonism in either SD rats or in SHRs. One interpretation of these results is that the primary response to bolus injection of hUII is prostanoid- or prostanoid- and NO-mediated (mesenteric vasodilatation) and that this triggers secondary events, which are dependent on eNOS (hindquarters vasodilatation) and neuronal NOS (tachycardia).",

In dogs in sinus rhythm, heart rate and LVdP/dt response to isoproterenol and exercise following pre-treatment with UL-FS 49 is significantly reduced, with heart rate increasing from 103 +/- 7 up to 154 +/- 5 bpm and LV dP/dt(max) from 2925 +/- 171 mmHg/s to 6249 +/- 400 mmHg/s compared to the response in control conditions (HR 220 +/- 3 bpm and LV dP/dt(max) 7473 +/- 616 mmHg/s) (p < 0.05). When heart rate is matched using atrial pacing, the LVdP/dt(max) response reached comparable values as observed in control conditions (7310 +/- 550 mmHg/s). Similar responses were obtained during exercise. Beta-adrenoceptor blockade attenuates considerably the heart rate and LVdP/dt response to sympathetic stimulation. Adjusting heart rate with atrial pacing restores only partially LVdP/dt(max).",

On multivariate analysis, baseline norepinephrine was also a highly significant (P<0.001) independent predictor of death. In contrast, the relation of the change in norepinephrine at 3 months to subsequent clinical outcomes was complex and treatment group-dependent. In the placebo-treated group but not in the bucindolol-treated group, marked norepinephrine increase at 3 months was associated with increased subsequent risks of death or death plus CHF hospitalization. In the bucindolol-treated group but not in the placebo-treated group, the 1st quartile of marked norepinephrine reduction was associated with an increased mortality risk.

Fluoxetine (10 and 20, but not 5 mg/kg, i.p.) injected into diabetic mice produced an antinociceptive effect in both the tail-immersion and hot-plate assays. The percentage maximum possible effect (% MPE) produced by fluoxetine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) was significantly lower in diabetic mice than in control mice. The antinociceptive effect of fluoxetine (20 mg/kg) in diabetic mice was dose-dependently potentiated by pindolol (5 and 10 mg/kg, i.p., a selective 5-HT(1A/1B) receptor antagonist), attenuated by ritanserin (1 and 2 mg/kg, i.p., a selective 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor antagonist) and remained unaffected by ondansetron (1 and 2 mg/kg, i.p., a selective 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist) in both test systems. These results suggest that fluoxetine-induced antinociception primarily involves serotonin pathway modulation through 5-HT(1) and 5-HT(2) receptors, but not through 5-HT(3) receptors, in the chronic pain associated with streptozotocin-induced diabetic neuropathy. Further, the potentiation of the antinociceptive effect of fluoxetine by pindolol indicates the usefulness of a combination of an antidepressant and a 5-HT(1A/1B) receptor antagonist in the treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain in humans.", 
    "133": "An optimised solid phase extraction (SPE) method developed for the extraction of a structural analogue of the beta-blocking drug propranolol from plasma utilising a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) has been compared with methods based on conventional liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), and SPE using C18-bonded and immobilised phenyl boronic acid (PBA). All four methods could be used for the extraction of the analyte with acceptable accuracy and precision. The MIP-based method, unlike the other methods required a protein precipitation step prior to extraction to eliminate the effects of co-extracted protein. The best performance was seen with the LLE method followed by SPE on the C18 phase. The MIP-based method represented no advantage over the comparator methods for this analyte. Indeed the performance of the MIP-based method was marginally worse as leaching of low level template impurities prevented detection of the target analyte at low concentrations (5 ngmL(-1)). This relatively poorer performance was evident as worse accuracy at low concentrations with a consequent higher limit of quantification than the conventional methods.", 
    "134": "Metoprolol is a widely used beta1-selective beta-blocker in hypertension and tachycardia. The influence on vital signs at rest and during ergometry (exercise heart rate or blood pressure, effect areas above baseline) was investigated in a pilot study with 18 healthy volunteers (mean age 29.1 years) by means of multiple and pairwise correlation analysis. At rest, the difference between predose and day 5 values were not associated with anthropometric characteristics. During ergometry for weight and height significant negative correlations were found corresponding to marked beta-values in the multiple regression models. Therefore heart rate decreases less markedly in slim persons which should be taken into consideration in exercise tests during metoprolol intake.", 
    "135": "In clinical trials beta-blockers (BB) are well tolerated in patients with systolic congestive heart failure (CHF). In contrast, in daily practice treatment initiation and titration appear to be more difficult and may differ in various BB -- but systematic data are lacking. We randomized 87 patients with systolic CHF (mean age 70.1 +/- 10.6 years, 24% females, LVEF 0.28 +/- 0.10, NYHA III-IV 29%) to treatment with either bisoprolol or carvedilol, in order to assess and compare the maximally achievable number of patients on treatment with these BB and the maximally achieved dosage during a minimum of 2 months attendance at our out patient heart failure clinic. In those randomized to bisoprolol, mean dose at 2 months was 33% of target dose (3.1 +/- 2.6 mg) and 41% at discharge. In those on carvedilol, the mean dose at 2 months was 27% of target dose (13.4 +/- 14.0 mg) and 32% at discharge. Thirty-nine and 40% of the bisoprolol and carvedilol treated patients, respectively, had stopped treatment at discharge. None of the figures differed significantly between the two treatment groups and no baseline parameter predicted BB tolerability. Thus, almost twice the number of unselected patients with systolic CHF attending a heart failure clinic focusing on systematic medical titration were intolerant to BB treatment and only a minority reached target dose treatment. The present data reveal no clear difference with respect to tolerability of carvedilol and bisoprolol, and no parameter predicts tolerability.", 
    "136": "In the present study, we identify intrinsic cardiac adrenergic (ICA) cells in the neonatal rat heart using immunofluorescent histochemical staining techniques with antibodies that specifically recognize the major enzymes in the catecholamine biosynthetic pathway. ICA cells are most concentrated near the endocardial surface of ventricular myocardium, but are also found sporadically throughout the heart. In primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, ICA cells are closely associated with clusters of cardiomyocytes. To investigate a potential role for intrinsically produced catecholamines, we recorded beating rates in the presence and absence of the catecholamine-depleting agent reserpine or the adrenergic receptor blockers prazosin and timolol using videomicroscopy and photodiode sensors. Our results show that beating rates slow significantly when endogenous catecholamines are depleted or when their action is blocked with either a beta- or an alpha1-adrenergic receptor antagonist. These data indicate that intrinsic cardiac catecholamines help to maintain beating rates in neonatal rat cardiomyocyte cultures via stimulation of alpha1- and beta-adrenergic receptors. This information should help to increase our understanding of the physiologic mechanisms governing cardiovascular function in neonates.", 
    "137": "The chimpanzee (CHP) was evaluated as a pharmacokinetic model for humans (HUMs) using propranolol, verapamil, theophylline, and 12 proprietary compounds. Species differences were observed in the systemic clearance of theophylline (approximately 5-fold higher in CHPs), a low clearance compound, and the bioavailability of propranolol and verapamil (lower in CHPs), both high clearance compounds. The systemic clearance of propranolol (approximately 1.53 l/h/kg) suggested that the hepatic blood flow in CHPs is comparable to that in humans. No substantial differences were observed in the in vitro protein binding. A preliminary attempt was made to characterize cytochrome P450 (P450) activities in CHP and HUM liver microsomes. Testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation and tolbutamide methylhydroxylation activities were comparable in CHP and HUM liver microsomes. In contrast, dextromethorphan O-demethylation and phenacetin O-deethylation activities were approximately 10-fold higher (per mg protein) in CHP liver microsomes. Intrinsic clearance estimates in CHP liver microsomes were higher for propranolol (approximately 10-fold) and theophylline (approximately 5-fold) and similar for verapamil. Of the 12 proprietary compounds, 3 had oral clearances that differed in the two species by more than 3-fold, an acceptable range for biological variability. Most of the observed differences are consistent with species differences in P450 enzyme activity. Oral clearances of proprietary compounds in HUMs were significantly correlated to those from CHPs (r = 0.68; p = 0.015), but not to estimates from rat, dog, and monkey. In summary, the chimpanzee serves as a valuable surrogate model for human pharmacokinetics, especially when species differences in P450 enzyme activity are considered.",

We present three cases of life-threatening crisis in which magnesium sulfate was particularly beneficial in controlling symptoms and signs when more conventional forms of therapy had failed. Two patients presented with hypertensive encephalopathy, and the third presented with catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy. All three patients successfully underwent tumor excision with magnesium sulfate used as the sole drug for control of hemodynamic disturbances during surgery. The problems of pheochromocytoma crisis and the potential benefits of magnesium sulfate in this condition are reviewed.", 
    "139": "Recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) may be related to AF-induced electrical remodeling characterized by shortening of the atrial action potential duration (APD) and loss of its rate adaptation. We investigated the effects of pretreatment with oral d,l-sotalol on rate-dependent changes in atrial monophasic action potential (MAP) duration after cardioversion of chronic AF with reference to the efficacy in preventing the arrhythmia recurrence.", 
    "140": "MAPs were recorded from the right atrium at six pacing cycle lengths (CLs) from 300 to 750 ms in 19 chronic AF patients after electrical cardioversion; 9 had been pretreated with oral d,l-sotalol (196 +/- 42 mg/day) for 7 days and 10 were untreated. MAP duration at 90% repolarization (MAPD90) in 11 control patients increased progressively with increases in CLs from 209 +/- 19 ms at CL = 300 ms to 264 +/- 28 ms at CL = 750 ms. In AF patients without sotalol, the CL-MAPD relation was shifted downward and flattened at longer CLs; MAPD90 values were 206 +/- 11 ms and 227 +/- 16 ms at CLs of 300 and 750 ms, respectively. MAPD90 values at CLs > or =500 ms in AF were significantly shorter than controls. In AF patients with sotalol, the normal CL-MAPD relation was preserved; MAPD90 increased from 226 +/- 19 ms to 282 +/- 46 ms in the CL range. AF recurred within 2 weeks after cardioversion in 14 of 24 patients pretreated with d,l-sotalol (216 +/- 51 mg/day) despite of continuation of sotalol treatment.",

The main etiologies of HF were ischemic in 31.6%, hypertensive in 35.2%, valvular in 14.9% and idiopathic in 7.4%. There was a history of hypertension 69%, diabetes in 35%, myocardial infarction in 22%, atrial fibrillation (AF) in 28%. The presentation form of HF was chronic decompensated in 86%, acute in 12%, refractory in 2%. The causes of decompensation were non compliance with diet or medical prescriptions in 28%, infections in 22% and AF 17%. ECG showed AF in 36% and left bundle branch block in 16%. Echocardiography was performed in 52% of the patients, 69% had left ventricular ejection fraction <40%. On admission, 39% received angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, 15% beta-blocker, 25% digoxin, 16% spironolactone and 53% furosemide.

    "147": "Congestive heart failure is associated with a loss of circadian and short-term variability in blood pressure and heart rate. In order to assess the contribution of elevated cardiac sympathetic activity to the disturbed cardiovascular regulation, we monitored blood pressure and heart rate in mice with cardiac overexpression of the beta1-adrenoceptor prior to the development of overt heart failure. Telemetry transmitters for continuous monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate were implanted in 8 to 9-week-old wildtype and transgenic mice, derived from crosses of heterozygous transgenic (line beta1TG4) and wildtype mice. Cardiovascular circadian patterns were analyzed under baseline conditions and during treatment with propranolol (500mg/L in drinking water). Short-term variability was assessed by spectral analysis of beat-to-beat data sampled for 30min at four circadian times. Transgenic beta1TG4 mice showed an increase in 24h heart rate, while blood pressure was not different from wildtype controls. Circadian patterns in blood pressure and heart were preserved in beta1TG4 mice. Addition of propranolol to the animals' drinking water led to a reduction in heart rate and its 24 h variation in both strains of mice. Short-term variability in blood pressure was not different between wildtype and beta1TG4 mice, but heart rate variability in the transgenic animals showed a rightward shift of the high-frequency component in the nocturnal activity period, suggesting an increase in respiratory frequency. In conclusion, the present study shows that both the circadian and the short-term regulation of blood pressure and heart rate are largely preserved in young, nonfailing beta1-transgenic mice. This finding suggests that the loss of blood pressure and heart rate variability observed in human congestive heart failure cannot be attributed solely to sympathetic overactivity but reflects the loss of adrenergic responsiveness to changes in the activity of the autonomic nervous system.",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were prescribed to 55% of residents, although only 45% received appropriate doses. Residents with hypertension or diabetes mellitus, using nitrates or who were male were more likely to receive ACE inhibitors. Appropriate ACE inhibitor doses were associated with functional impairment, nitrate use and recent hospitalization. Documentation of systolic dysfunction was associated with a greater likelihood of ACE inhibitor use. Beta-blockers were prescribed to 25% of residents, who were more likely to be using nitrates, have ischemic heart disease or had been recently hospitalized, and less likely to have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Residents with atrial fibrillation were more likely to be prescribed digoxin. Potentially hazardous regimens were prescribed to 43% of residents.",

    "155": "The urinary excretion of protein progressively increased following the treatment with ADR, which was prevented by ACEi, ARB, and a combination of both. Similarly, the glomerulopathy assessed by glomerulosclerosis index was also ameliorated by ACEi or ARB. However, combined therapy of both ACEi and ARB was without an additional effect (Control 1.4 +/- 0.4%, ADR 10.7 +/- 2.7%**, ACEi 0.8 +/- 0.4%, ARB 2.6 +/- 1.0%, ACEi+ARB 1.7 +/- 1.5%, ** p < 0.01 vs. Control). The expression of transforming growth factor-beta(1) was increased following the treatment with ADR (1.4 +/- 0.07-fold, p < 0.05 vs. Control), however, the degree of which was similarly blunted by either ACEi, ARB, or the combination of both. The expression of type 1 angiotensin II receptor mRNA increased following the treatment with ADR, the degree of which was further upregulated by ACEi and decreased by ARB to the control level (ADR 1.3 +/- 0.06-fold*, ACEi 1.8 +/- 0.05-fold***, ARB 1.0 +/- 0.04-fold, * p < 0.05 and *** p < 0.001 vs. Control). The combined therapy of ACEi and ARB still showed an upregulation of type 1 angiotensin II receptor mRNA, however, of which degree was mitigated compared with that induced by ACEi alone (ACEi+ARB 1.5 +/- 0.04-fold, ** p < 0.01 vs. Control). On the contrary, the expression of type 2 angiotensin II receptor mRNA was downregulated following the treatment with ADR, which was similarly restored to the control level by ACEi, ARB, and a combination of both (ADR 0.5 +/- 0.08-fold**, ACEi 1.0 +/- 0.06-fold, ARB 1.0 +/- 0.05-fold, ACEi+ARB 1.0 +/- 0.05-fold, ** p < 0.01 vs. Control).", 
    "156": "It is suggested that combined therapy of ACEi and ARB with relatively high or maximal doses of each drug has no additive or synergistic benefits on the progression of ADR-induced glomerulopathy. Effects of RAS blockade may in part be related to differential regulation of type 1 and type 2 angiotensin II receptors.", 
    "157": "Using neuronal NO synthase (nNOS)-specific antisense oligonucleotides, we examined the role of nitric oxide (NO) in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) on control of blood pressure and heart rate (HR) in conscious sham rats and rats with chronic heart failure (CHF). After 6-8 wk, rats with chronic coronary ligation showed hemodynamic and echocardiographic signs of CHF. In sham rats, we found that microinjection of sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 20 nmol, 100 nl) into the PVN induced a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP). SNP also induced a significant decrease in HR over the next 10 min. In contrast, the NOS inhibitor N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA, 200 pmol, 100 nl) significantly increased MAP and HR over the next 18-20 min. After injection of nNOS antisense, MAP was significantly increased in sham rats over the next 7 h. The peak response was 27.6 +/- 4.1% above baseline pressure. However, in the CHF rats, only MAP was significantly increased. The peak magnitude was 12.9 +/- 5.4% of baseline, which was significantly attenuated compared with sham rats (P < 0.01). In sham rats, the pressor response was completely abolished by alpha-receptor blockade. HR was significantly increased from hour 1 to hour 7 in sham and CHF rats. There was no difference in magnitude of HR responses. The tachycardia could not be abolished by the beta(1)-blocker metoprolol. However, the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine did not further augment the tachycardia. We conclude that NO induces a significant depressor and bradycardiac response in normal rats. The pressor response is mediated by an elevated sympathetic tone, whereas the tachycardia is mediated by withdrawal of parasympathetic tone in sham rats. These data are consistent with a downregulation of nNOS within the PVN in CHF.", 
    "158": "This article discusses risk factors for cardiovascular disease in the minority community, including hypertension, obesity, diabetes,and diet. The minority community exhibits important population differences regarding risk and outcomes for cardiovascular disease. The complete explanation for these differential outcomes is lacking and likely to be multifactorial in origin; however, disparities in health care (differences in the quality of health care that are not due to access-related factors or clinical needs, to preferences, or to the appropriateness of the intervention) may emanate from decisions made by the patient, provider, or health care system. Hypertension as a disease entity is strikingly pathologic in African Americans. Correspondingly, the incidence of cardiovascular mortality due to hypertensive heart disease is fourfold higher in African Americans than in non-Hispanic whites. Hypertension and heart failure can be treated effectively in the minority community with a regimen of agents not dissimilar from that used for the general population. Treatment regimens should be individualized based on the disease presentation, associated comorbidity, and disease severity and not on something as arbitrary as race."
