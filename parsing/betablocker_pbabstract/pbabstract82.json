    "2": "70 men (mean age 52.8 \u00b1 8.4) treated with PCI due to acute myocardial infarction, were enrolled in the study. All subjects underwent ultrasound examination of the IMT complex of: common carotid artery (CCA), carotid bulb and common femoral artery (CFA) during hospitalization and follow-up period (3.83 \u00b1 1.29 years).", 
    "3": "During the follow-up 3 patients (4.3%) were not on any medications, 8 pts (11.4%) were on reduced doses of \u03b2-blocker, statin or ACE-I (non-compliant pts.). The others (compliant) - 59 pts (84.3%) received standard pharmacological treatment after MI. Nevertheless, an increase of IMT complex value after follow-up compared to initial IMT values of all examined peripheral arteries was observed (respectively: IMT CCA - 0.91 \u00b1 0.26 vs 1.10 \u00b1 0.36, p=0.002, IMT of carotid bulb - 1.31 \u00b1 0.55 vs 1.82 \u00b1 0.69, p=0.012, IMT CFA - 1.38 \u00b1 0.64 vs 1.97 \u00b1 0.75, p=0.014). Non-compliant patients had statistically significant higher IMT values after follow-up when compared to compliant subjects (1.62 vs 1.20, p= 0.017). Patients with higher IMT values were reported to have cardiac events more frequently during the follow-up (p<0.05).",

    "5": "The relationship between interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2)-induced nociception and the blood glucose level was studied in ICR mice. We found in the present study that intrathecal (i.t.) injection of IL-1\u03b2 increased pain behavior. In addition, i.t. IL-1\u03b2 injection caused an elevation of the blood glucose level. The time-course study showed that maximal blood glucose level was observed 30 and 60 min after i.t. IL-1\u03b2 administration. Furthermore, i.t. injection of IL-1\u03b2 enhanced the blood glucose level when mice were orally fed with d-glucose. The i.t. administration of IL-1\u03b2 antagonist (AF12198) inhibited the hyperglycemia and pain behaviors induced by IL-1\u03b2. We found in the present study that adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA level was also increased by i.t. IL-1\u03b2 injection. Furthermore, intraperitoneal (i.p.) pretreatment with phentolamine (an \u03b1(1)-adrenergic blocker) or yohimbine (an \u03b1(2)-adrenergic blocker) significantly attenuated the blood glucose level and pain behavior induced by IL-1\u03b2 administered i.t. However, the blood glucose level and pain behavior were not affected by butoxamine (a \u03b2(2)-adrenergic blocker), whereas metoprolol (a \u03b2(2)-adrenergic blocker) enhanced IL-1\u03b2-induced blood glucose level and pain behavior in mice fed with d-glucose. However, its effect was not statistically significant. Our results suggest that IL-1\u03b2 administered i.t. increases the blood glucose level via an activation of \u03b1 adrenergic nervous system.", 
    "6": "Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) may alleviate certain forms of neuropathic pain; its mechanisms of action are, however, not fully understood. Previous studies have mainly been focused onto segmental spinal mechanisms, though there is evidence indicating a supraspinal involvement. This study aims to evaluate the relative importance of segmental and supraspinal mechanisms related to the activation of the dorsal columns (DCs). Rats were used to induce the spared nerve injury neuropathy and simultaneously subjected to chronic bilateral DC lesions at the C6-C8 level. Two pairs of miniature electrodes were implanted in each animal, with a monopolar system placed in the dorsal epidural space at a low thoracic level (below lesion) and a bipolar system placed onto the dorsal column nuclei (above lesion). Stimulation (50 Hz, 0.2 ms, 2-4V, 5 min) was applied via either type of electrodes, and tests for sensitivity to tactile and thermal stimuli were used to assess its inhibitory effects. Various receptor antagonists {bicuculline (GABA(A)), saclofen (GABA(B)), ketanserine (5HT(2)), methysergide (5HT(1-2)), phentolamine (\u03b1-adrenergic), propranolol (\u03b2-adrenergic), sulpiride (D(2)/D(3) dopamine) or saline were injected prior to the SCS. Rostral and caudal stimulations produced a comparable inhibition of neuropathic manifestations, and these effects were attenuated by about 50% after DC lesions. Pretreatment with the various receptor antagonists differentially influenced the effects of rostral and caudal stimulation. Our findings suggest that both supraspinal and segmental mechanisms are activated by SCS, and that in this model with DC lesions, rostral and caudal stimulations may activate different synaptic circuitries and transmitter systems.", 
    "7": "The pathophysiology of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) formation involves a complex interplay of genetic predisposition, cardiovascular risk factors, and hemodynamic forces. The medical community has resorted to the use of pharmacologic agents based on weak data transplanted from either abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) or Marfan syndrome. However, aneurysms differ significantly based on their anatomic location and etiology. Epidemiologic and experimental data demonstrate that different genetic and nongenetic risk factors as well as diverse physiologic processes are responsible for the development and progression of sporadic TAA, familial TAA, and AAA. Therefore, these disease processes need to be considered as distinct entities and not hastily grouped together. The extrapolation of data from one aneurysmal disease process to another is still ill-founded and potentially harmful. Clinical trials in TAA are required before medical therapies, such as \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, statins, or macrolide antibiotics, can be recommended.", 
    "8": "The main determinant of myocardial necrosis following an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is duration of ischemia. Infarct size is a strong independent predictor of postinfarction mortality. Interventions able to protect the myocardium from death during an AMI (cardioprotection) are urgently needed. Myocardial injury associated with reperfusion (ischemia/reperfusion injury [I/R]) significantly contributes to the final necrotic size. Duration of ischemia can only be reduced by social and emergency medical services--hospital collaborative programs. However, for a given duration of ischemia, infarct size can be limited by reducing reperfusion injury. Despite the fact that several therapies have been shown to reduce I/R injury in animal models, translation to humans has been frustrating. The cost of developing new drugs able to reduce I/R injury is huge, and this is a major roadblock in the field of cardioprotection. Recent studies have proposed that old, inexpensive drugs--in human use for decades (e.g., \u03b2-blockers and cyclosporine, among others)--can reduce I/R injury when administered intravenously before coronary opening. The demonstration of such a cardioprotective effect should have a significant impact in the care of AMI patients.", 
    "9": "Arterial hypertension is a widely prevalent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases with well documented harmful effects on the heart and the vascular system. Despite a broad antihypertensive drug armamentarium control of hypertension is worldwide suboptimal. Daily practice as well as large intervention trials show that single-drug therapy often fails to adequately control blood pressure (BP). Therefore, the early introduction of a combination therapy may lead to a better and more rapid BP lowering effect, particularly in patients with more than stage I hypertension or in patients with mild hypertension and high cardiovascular risk. In addition, side effects of an antihypertensive drug can be prevented by a meaningful (low dose) combination with a second antihypertensive agent. Moreover, combination of antihypertensive drugs, especially if provided fixed, may substantially improve compliance. However, the choice of the drug combination primarily relates on the demographic features and co-morbidities of the patient. Although BP lowering is the main determinant of cardiovascular risk reduction in the treatment of hypertension, some antihypertensive drugs may exhibit protective effects beyond BP reduction that have to be considered when antihypertensive drugs are combined. In recent large intervention studies, the combination of an ACE inhibitor with a calcium channel blocker was especially advantageous in high risk hypertensive patients. The addition of a thiazide type diuretic to a blocker of the renin-angiotensin system is also sensible and popular with numerous available fixed combinations.",

Blood pressure and 24-hour ECG were monitored monthly for one year; patients were asked to report symptomatic AF episodes and to undergo an ECG as early as possible.", 
    "12": "One hundred and thirty-two patients completed the study (telmisartan, n=70; carvedilol, n=62). Significantly fewer AF episodes were reported with telmisartan versus carvedilol (14.3% vs. 37.1%; p<0.003). Left atrial diameter, assessed by echocardiography, was similar with telmisartan and carvedilol (3.4\u00b12.3 cm vs. 3.6\u00b12.4 cm). At study end, both regimes significantly reduced mean left ventricular mass index, but the reduction obtained with telmisartan was significantly greater than with carvedilol (117.8\u00b110.7 vs. 124.7\u00b114.5; p<0.0001). Mean blood pressure values were not significantly different between the groups (telmisartan 154/97 to 123/75 mmHg; p<0.001; carvedilol 153/94 to 125/78 mmHg; p<0.001).",

    "14": "In the present study, we investigated how increased sympathetic tone during middle-age affects the splenic sympathetic neurotransmission. Fifteen-month-old (M) F344 rats received rilmenidine (0, 0.5 or 1.5mg/kg/day, i.p. for 90 days) to lower sympathetic tone. Controls for age were untreated 3 or 18M rats. We report that rilmenidine (1) reduced plasma and splenic norepinephrine concentrations and splenic norepinephrine turnover, and partially reversed the sympathetic nerve loss; and (2) increased \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) density and \u03b2-AR-stimulated cAMP production. Collectively, these findings suggest a protective effect of lowering sympathetic tone on sympathetic nerve integrity, and enhanced sympathetic neurotransmission in secondary immune organs.", 
    "15": "Portal hypertension is a common complication of chronic liver diseases associated with liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. At present, beta-blockers such as carvedilol remain the medical treatment of choice for protection against variceal bleeding and other complications. Since carvedilol has powerful antioxidant properties we assessed the potential antifibrotic effects of carvedilol and the underlying mechanisms that may add further benefits for its clinical usefulness using a chronic model of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced hepatotoxicity. Two weeks after CCl4 induction of chronic hepatotoxicity, rats were co-treated with carvedilol (10mg/kg, orally) daily for 6weeks. It was found that treatment of animals with carvedilol significantly counteracted the changes in liver function and histopathological lesions induced by CCl4. Also, carvedilol significantly counteracted lipid peroxidation, GSH depletion, and reduction in antioxidant enzyme activities; glutathione-S-transferase and catalase that was induced by CCl4. In addition, carvedilol ameliorated the inflammation induced by CCl4 as indicated by reducing the serum level of acute phase protein marker; alpha-2-macroglobulin and the liver expression of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB). Finally, carvedilol significantly reduced liver fibrosis markers including hydroxyproline, collagen accumulation, and the expression of the hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation marker; alpha smooth muscle actin. In conclusion, the present study provides evidences for the promising antifibrotic effects of carvedilol that can be explained by amelioration of oxidative stress through mainly, replenishment of GSH, restoration of antioxidant enzyme activities and reduction of lipid peroxides as well as amelioration of inflammation and fibrosis by decreasing collagen accumulation, acute phase protein level, NF-\u03baB expression and finally HSC activation.", 
    "16": "To broaden the use of the recombinant high-density lipoprotein (rHDL) approach to the characterization of lead compounds, we investigated the pharmacology of the human beta-2-adrenoceptor in nanolipid bilayers (rHDL) with a broad set of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. To that end, we developed a homogeneous copper-chelate scintillation proximity binding assay (SPA) in order to compare receptor-ligand binding affinities before and after reconstitution into rHDLs. Our results clearly show that the beta-2-adrenoceptor reconstituted in rHDLs display the same pharmacology as that in cell membranes and that rHDLs can be used not only to measure affinities for a range of ligands but also to study binding kinetics.",

Proteomic analyses of the soluble venom from the Mexican scorpion Vaejovis mexicanus smithi showed that it contains more than 200 different components. Among them, a 36-residue peptide with a molecular mass of 3864 Da (named Vm24) was shown to be a potent blocker of Kv1.3 of human lymphocytes (K(d) \u223c 3 pM). The three-dimensional solution structure of Vm24 was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance, showing the peptide folds into a distorted cystine-stabilized \u03b1/\u03b2 motif consisting of a single-turn \u03b1-helix and a three-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-sheet, stabilized by four disulfide bridges. The disulfide pairs are formed between Cys6 and Cys26, Cys12 and Cys31, Cys16 and Cys33, and Cys21 and Cys36. Sequence analyses identified Vm24 as the first example of a new subfamily of \u03b1-type K(+) channel blockers (systematic number \u03b1-KTx 23.1). Comparison with other Kv1.3 blockers isolated from scorpions suggests a number of structural features that could explain the remarkable affinity and specificity of Vm24 toward Kv1.3 channels of lymphocytes.",

The identity of the evaluated compound (labelled as UPB-2) was confirmed by 1H-, 13C-NMR and IR spectral data as well. The estimated physicochemical parameters included melting point data, solubility in various media, purity checking (adsorption thin-layer chromatography), surface activity determination (non-direct Traube stalagmometric method), acidobasic characteristics (pKa value determination by alkalimetric titration), log epsilon values estimation (spectrophotometrically in UV/VIS region) and a study of the influence of acidic and alkaline media towards the stability of UPB-2. Other experimentally estimated values were lipohydrophilic descriptors using RP-HPLC (log k') and the log PexpS in various lipohydrophilic media by the shake flask method. Based on the log Pexp readouts, the ability to permeate across the brain-blood barrier was predicted. For the content determination of UBP-2 the RP-HPLC (reversed-phase HPLC), the method of an internal standard and UV/VIS spectrophotometry at the wavelength of 260 nm (aqueous medium) and at 258 nm (methanolic medium) was applied.",

The objective of this study was to develop a new algorithm by polymorphisms of CYP2C9, VKORC1 and CYP4F2 to predict the daily stable dose of warfarin in Chinese patients with NVAF. A total of 325 Chinese NVAF patients on stable dose of warfarin with a target international normalised ratio of 1.5 to 3.0 were recruited and divided randomly into two cohorts. CYP2C9*3, VKORC1-1639, VKORC1 1173 and CYP4F2 were detected by ligase detection reaction method. The new algorithm was developed with multivariate linear regression in cohort 1 (260 patients) and assessed with Pearson Correlation Analysis (PCA) in cohort 2 (65 patients). From 260 enrolled patients, the model (R2 = 51.7%) was developed as: Dose = 3.47 - 0.022 (AGE) + 0.017 (WT) + 0.189 (PTE) - 0.283 (\u03b2-blocker) - 0.471 (AMIO) - 0.586 (CYP2C9 *1/*3) - 0.296 (VKORC1 CT) - 0.648 (VKORC1 TT) + 0.219 (CYP4F2 TT). PCA displayed that the algorithm was good (r = 0.658). The residual plots revealed that the predicted doses by the algorithm tend to be overestimated when lower doses were administered to patients and to be underestimated in higher doses. The algorithm developed by us might predict warfarin dose used by Chinese NVAF patients.",

Inspection may reveal localized nail abnormalities that should be treated, or may provide clues to an underlying systemic disease that requires further workup. Excessive keratinaceous material under the nail bed in a distal and lateral distribution should prompt an evaluation for onychomycosis. Onychomycosis may be diagnosed through potassium hydroxide examination of scrapings. If potassium hydroxide testing is negative for the condition, a nail culture or nail plate biopsy should be performed. A proliferating, erythematous, disruptive mass in the nail bed should be carefully evaluated for underlying squamous cell carcinoma. Longitudinal melanonychia (vertical nail bands) must be differentiated from subungual melanomas, which account for 50 percent of melanomas in persons with dark skin. Dystrophic longitudinal ridges and subungual hematomas are local conditions caused by trauma. Edema and erythema of the proximal and lateral nail folds are hallmark features of acute and chronic paronychia. Clubbing may suggest an underlying disease such as cirrhosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or celiac sprue. Koilonychia (spoon nail) is commonly associated with iron deficiency anemia. Splinter hemorrhages may herald endocarditis, although other causes should be considered. Beau lines can mark the onset of a severe underlying illness, whereas Muehrcke lines are associated with hypoalbuminemia.

In this report, we further test whether CDH exhibited the hormonal-like response. The application of CDH and an inducer of HO-1, hemin, were able to induce the up-regulation of cucumber HO-1 gene (CsHO1) expression and thereafter the promotion of adventitious rooting in cucumber explants. The effect is specific for HO-1 since the potent HO-1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP) blocked the above responses triggered by CDH, and the inhibitory effects were reversed further when 30% saturation of CO aqueous solution was added together. Further, molecular evidence showed that CDH triggered the increases of the HO-1-mediated target genes responsible for adventitious rooting, including one DnaJ-like gene (CsDNAJ-1) and two calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) genes (CsCDPK1 and CsCDPK5), and were inhibited by ZnPP and reversed by CO. The calcium (Ca2+) chelator ethylene glycol-bis (2-aminoethylether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and the Ca2+ channel blocker lanthanum chloride (LaCl3) not only compromised the induction of adventitious rooting induced by CDH but also decreased the transcripts of above three target genes. However, the application of ascorbic acid (AsA), a well-known antioxidant in plants, failed to exhibit similar inducible effect on adventitious root formation. In short, above results illustrated that the response of CDH in the induction of cucumber adventitious rooting might be through HO-1-dependent mechanism and calcium signaling.",

We have simulated unbinding of \u03b2(1)-selective Esmolol and \u03b2(2)-selective ICI-118551 from both receptors to the extracellular environment and found distinct molecular features of unbinding. By calculating work profiles, we show different preference in antagonist unbinding pathways between the receptors, in particular, perpendicular to the membrane pathway is favourable in the \u03b2(1) adrenoceptor, whereas the lateral pathway involving helices 5, 6 and 7 is preferable in the \u03b2(2) adrenoceptor. The estimated free energy change of unbinding based on the preferable pathway correlates with the experimental ligand selectivity. We then show that the non-conserved K347 (6.58) appears to facilitate in guiding Esmolol to the extracellular surface via hydrogen bonds in the \u03b2(1) adrenoceptor. In contrast, hydrophobic and aromatic interactions dominate in driving ICI-118551 through the easiest pathway in the \u03b2(2) adrenoceptor. We show how our study can stimulate design of selective antagonists and discuss other possible molecular reasons of ligand selectivity, involving sequential binding of agonists and glycosylation of the receptor extracellular surface.",

Severe PE was defined according to the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy (ISSHP) criteria. Infants exposed to labetalol in utero (labetalol infants) were compared with infants, who were not exposed to labetalol (controls). Neonatal records were reviewed for hypotension (RR<mean gestational age in weeks), bradycardia (heartrate<100/min) and hypoglycaemia (glucose<2.7 mmol/L) in the first 48 postnatal hours.", 
    "89": "Of 109 infants, 55 had been exposed to labetalol, whereas 54 were not (controls). Gestational age at delivery and birthweight were similar in both groups (31.8 vs. 32.8 weeks (p=0.06) and 1510 vs. 1639 grams (p=0.25), respectively for the labetalol vs. control group). Hypotension occurred significantly more in conjunction with labetalol exposure (16, (29.1%) vs. 4 (7.4%); p=0.003), irrespective of the route of administration. Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) was present in 9 (56%) of hypotensive labetalol infants compared to 1 (24%) infant in the hypotensive control group (NS). In a multivariate regression model, labetalol exposure, the need for intubation and PDA appeared independently associated with hypotension (P<0.001). Hypoglycemia occurred in 26 (47.3%) of labetalol infants and in 23 (42.6%) of control infants (p=0.62). Bradycardia occurred in 4 (7.3%) of labetalol infants and in 1 (1.9%) of control infants (p=0.18). Hypoglycemia was more common in premature infants (n=45 (48,9%) vs. n=4 (23.5%), p=0.05) in both labetalol and control infants.", 
    "90": "Hypotension is more common after maternal labetalol exposure, regardless of the dosage and route of administration. The need for intubation and the presence of a PDA also play a role. Hypoglycemia is a very common finding in this population and is merely related to prematurity and independent of labetalol exposure as was the incidental occurrence of bradycardia. These findings on the neonatal side effects of maternal labetalol treatment in preeclampsia underline the importance of frequent blood glucose and blood pressure measurements in the first days of life, especially in intubated preterm infants with a PDA.", 
    "91": "The hippocampus, basolateral amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex participate in the extinction of inhibitory avoidance and contextual fear conditioning. We studied the effect of drugs acting on receptors involved in synaptic modulation on extinction of both tasks. The drugs were given bilaterally right after the first of two sessions of extinction in each task through cannulae implanted into the mentioned areas. The doses used are known to influence memory consolidation of the original tasks. Their effects were evaluated on a second extinction session 24h later, and assumed to result from influences on the consolidation of extinction. The glutamate NMDA receptor stimulant d-serine (50 \u03bcg/side) and the histamine methyl-transferase inhibitor SKF9188 (12.5 \u03bcg/side) enhanced, and the NMDA antagonist amino-phosphonopentanoate (5 \u03bcg/side) and the H2 histamine receptor antagonist ranitidine (17.5 \u03bcg/side) inhibited, extinction of both tasks regardless of the region into which they were administered. Thus, glutamate NMDA receptors are involved in the consolidation of extinction of both tasks, and histamine H2 receptors modulate that process in all areas studied. Norepinephrine (1 \u03bcg/side), the \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist timolol (1 \u03bcg/side), the D1 dopamine receptor agonist SKF38393 (12.5 \u03bcg/side) and the D1 antagonist SCH23390 (1.5 \u03bcg/side) also affected extinction of both tasks, but their effects varied with the task and with the site of infusion, suggesting that extinction modulation by \u03b2- and D1 receptors is more complex. In conclusion, extinction of two different aversive tasks is modulatable by various systems, which bears upon the behavioral and pharmacological treatment of fear-motivated brain disorders.", 
    "92": "The drug intestinal permeability (P(eff)) measure has been widely used as one of the main factors governing both the rate and/or extent of drug absorption (F(abs)) in humans following oral administration. In this communication we emphasize the complexity behind and the care that must be taken with this in vivo P(eff) measurement. Intestinal permeability, considering the whole of the human intestine, is more complex than generally recognized, and this can lead to misjudgment regarding F(abs) and P(eff) in various settings, e.g. drug discovery, formulation design, drug development and regulation. Setting the adequate standard for the low/high permeability class boundary, the different experimental methods for the permeability measurement, and segmental-dependent permeability throughout the human intestine due to different mechanisms are some of the main points that are discussed. Overall, the use of jejunal P(eff) as a surrogate for extent of absorption is sound and scientifically justified; a compound with high jejunal P(eff) will have high F(abs), eliminating the risk for misclassification as a BCS class I drug. Much more care should be taken, however, when jejunal P(eff) does not support a high-permeability classification; a thorough examination may reveal high-permeability after all, attributable to e.g. segmental-dependent permeability due to degree of ionization or transporter expression. In this situation, the use of multiple permeability experimental methods, including the use of metabolism, which except for luminal degradation requires absorption, is prudent and encouraged.", 
    "93": "Beta adrenergic receptor blocking drugs (\u03b2-blockers) are used chronically in many cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, ischemic heart disease, arrhythmia, and heart failure. Beneficial effects are associated with the inhibition of symphathetic nervous system hyperactivity, reduction of heart rate, and remodeling by blocking the mitogenic activity of catecholamines. A possible effect of \u03b2-blockers on substrate metabolism has also been suggested. The direct effects of \u03b2-blockers on mouse C2C12 cells were investigated in this study. C2C12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and differentiated into myotubes in the same medium that contained 1% FBS. Palmitic acid oxidation and glycolysis were measured by using [9,10-(3)H]palmitate and [5-(3)H]glucose, respectively. The amount of (3)H(2)O was measured as an indicator of substrate usage. Carvedilol (100 \u00b5mol/L) inhibited palmitate oxidation and increased glycolysis by nearly 50%. Prazosin altered substrate metabolism in a similar fashion as carvedilol, whereas propranolol or bisoprolol were devoid of metabolic effects. When added to mimic sympathetic activation, epinephrine stimulated glycolysis but did not alter fatty acid oxidation. Based on these results, carvedilol appears to have direct effects on substrate metabolism that are related to the blockade of \u03b11 adrenergic receptors.", 
    "94": "Abstract. The purpose of this research was to develop and evaluate effervescent gastric floating tablets of propranolol HCl. The oral delivery of antihypertensive propranolol HCl was facilitated by preparing an effervescent floating dosage form which could increase its absorption in the stomach by increasing the drug's gastric residence time. In the present work, effervescent floating tablets were prepared with a hydrophilic carrier such as polyethylene oxide (PEO WSR N 60K and PEO WSR 303) as a release retarding agent and sodium bicarbonate as a gas generating agent. The prepared tablets were evaluated for all their physicochemical properties, in vitro buoyancy, drug release and rate order kinetics. From the results, P9 was selected as an optimized formulation based on their 12 h drug release, minimal floating lag time and maximum total floating time. The optimized formulation followed first order rate kinetics with erosion mechanism. The optimized formulation was characterized with FTIR studies and no interaction between the drug and the polymers were observed.",

Sprague-Dawley rats of both sexes were exposed to dirty cat litter (trauma) for 10 min and the protocol was repeated 1 week later with a trauma reminder (clean litter). The rats also received intraperitoneal fluoxetine (2.5, 5 or 10 mg/kg/day), propranolol (10 mg/kg/day) or saline for 7 days between two exposure sessions. Functional behavioral experiments were performed using elevated plus maze, following exposure to trauma reminder. Western blot analyses for M(1), M(2), M(3), M(4) and M(5) receptor proteins were employed in the homogenates of the hippocampus, the frontal cortex and the amygdaloid complex. The anxiety indices increased from 0.63\u00b10.02 to 0.89\u00b10.04 in rats exposed to the trauma reminder. The freezing times were also recorded as 47\u00b16 and 133\u00b112 s, in control and test animals respectively. Fluoxetine or propranolol treatments restored the increases in the anxiety indices and the freezing times. Female rats had higher anxiety indices compared to males. Western blot data showed increases in M(2) and M(5) expression in the frontal cortex. Expression of M(1) receptors increased and M(4) subtype decreased in the hippocampus. In the amygdaloid complex of rats, we also detected a down-regulation of M(4) receptors. Fluoxetine and propranolol only corrected the changes occurred in the frontal cortex.

Here, we generated cardiomyocytes from iPSCs derived from patients in a DCM family carrying a point mutation (R173W) in the gene encoding sarcomeric protein cardiac troponin T. Compared to control healthy individuals in the same family cohort, cardiomyocytes derived from iPSCs from DCM patients exhibited altered regulation of calcium ion (Ca(2+)), decreased contractility, and abnormal distribution of sarcomeric \u03b1-actinin. When stimulated with a \u03b2-adrenergic agonist, DCM iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes showed characteristics of cellular stress such as reduced beating rates, compromised contraction, and a greater number of cells with abnormal sarcomeric \u03b1-actinin distribution. Treatment with \u03b2-adrenergic blockers or overexpression of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) adenosine triphosphatase (Serca2a) improved the function of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from DCM patients. Thus, iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from DCM patients recapitulate to some extent the morphological and functional phenotypes of DCM and may serve as a useful platform for exploring disease mechanisms and for drug screening.", 
    "138": "Because chiral liquid chromatography (LC) could become a powerful tool to estimate racemic atenolol quantity, excellent enantiomeric separation should be produced during data acquisition for satisfactory observation of atenolol concentrations throughout the racemic resolution processes. Selection of chiral LC column and analytical protocol that fulfill demands of the ultra fast LC analysis is essential. This article describes the characteristics of atenolol chromatographic separation that resulted from different resolution media and analytical protocols with the use of a Chiralcel\u00ae OD column. The chromatograms showed quite different characteristics of the separation process. The single enantiomer and racemic atenolol could be recognized by the Chiralcel\u00ae OD column in less than 20 min. Symmetrical peaks were obtained; however, several protocols produced peaks with wide bases and slanted baselines. Observations showed that efficient enantioresolution of racemic atenolol was obtained at slow mobile phase flow rate, decreased concentration of amine-type modifier but increased alcohol content in mobile phase and highest ultraviolet detection wavelength were required. The optimal ultra fast LC protocol enables to reduce and eliminate the peaks of either the atenolol solvent or the buffers and provided the highest peak intensities of both atenolol enantiomers.",

A laboratory tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) was diagnosed after excluding other causes of electrolyte imbalance in the diagnostic workup. No treatment was required to reverse the TLS condition, and the propranolol therapy was continued as the electrolyte alterations were only mild. One month later, the IH was remarkably reduced in size and no longer ulcerated. Maintenance of propranolol was extended for a total of 6 months. Parallel to the gradual involution of the IH, serum potassium and phosphorus levels returned within normal levels.

    "151": "Esmolol is a unique cardioselective \u03b2(1)-receptor blocking agent with a rapid onset and short duration of action. Since our previous review in 1995, the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of esmolol have been investigated in a number of acute care settings. Three studies investigated the pharmacokinetics and safety of esmolol in the paediatric population. The disposition of esmolol in children was found to be linear with plasma concentrations increasing in proportion to dose over the ranges studied. The pharmacokinetic estimates for esmolol showed a shorter elimination half-life (t(&frac12;)) [2.7-4.8 minutes] and a higher clearance (281\u2009mL/kg/min) in newborns and infants than that found in children (>2 years old) and adults. Dosing requirements to achieve targeted blood pressure in post-coarctectomy patients were substantially higher (mean 700\u2009\u03bcg/kg/min) than that used in adults. Esmolol was effective in controlling hypertension following cardiac surgery and terminating supraventricular arrhythmias in children. The efficacy of esmolol has been established in a variety of patients, including those with unstable angina, myocardial ischaemia, supraventricular arrhythmias, peri- and postoperative tachycardia and hypertension, and electroconvulsive therapy. With careful titration and monitoring, esmolol can be used effectively in patients with congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive lung disease because of its unique short t(&frac12;) and \u03b2(1)-selectivity. Different dosage schedules have been developed depending on clinical setting and diagnosis. Generally, a loading dose of \u2264500\u2009\u03bcg/kg/min over 1 minute is administered followed by a continuous infusion of 25-300\u2009\u03bcg/kg/min. Hypotension, being the primary adverse effect, can be minimized by careful dosage titration and patient monitoring. In the perioperative setting involving tracheal intubation and extubation, a number of recent studies have suggested that titration of esmolol to a haemodynamic endpoint can be safe and effective, resulting in a decreased incidence of myocardial ischaemia. The most effective regimen in attenuating the response to heart rate and blood pressure after laryngeal tracheal intubation was a loading dose of 500\u2009\u03bcg/kg/min for 4 minutes followed by a continuous infusion of 200-300\u2009\u03bcg/kg/min. In cardiac and non-cardiac surgical patients esmolol has been shown to decrease episodes of myocardial ischaemia and arrhythmias. In the perioperative period for non-cardiac surgery routine use of \u03b2-blockers (\u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists) is no longer recommended. However, in patients at high risk for myocardial ischaemia or undergoing high-risk surgery where a \u03b2-blocker is indicated, esmolol is the ideal perioperative agent to minimize the risk of hypotension and bradycardia based on its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic characteristics. For postoperative patients in atrial fibrillation, esmolol achieves rapid ventricular rate control. However, for the prevention of postoperative atrial fibrillation esmolol provides no advantage over oral \u03b2-blockers. In other situations where emergent \u03b2-blockade is required, such as electroconvulsive therapy, esmolol has been shown to effectively control haemodynamic response. After more than 2 decades of use esmolol continues to provide an important therapeutic option in the acute care setting.", 
    "152": "Mitochondria are best known as the essential intracellular organelles that host the homeostasis required for cellular survival, but they also have relevance in diverse disease-related conditions, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide is the key molecule in AD pathogenesis, and has been highlighted in the implication of mitochondrial abnormality during the disease progress. Neuronal exposure to A\u03b2 impairs mitochondrial dynamics and function. Furthermore, mitochondrial A\u03b2 accumulation has been detected in the AD brain. However, the underlying mechanism of how A\u03b2 affects mitochondrial function remains uncertain, and it is questionable whether mitochondrial A\u03b2 accumulation followed by mitochondrial dysfunction leads directly to neuronal toxicity. This study demonstrated that an exogenous A\u03b2(1-42) treatment, when applied to the hippocampal cell line of mice (specifically HT22 cells), caused a deleterious alteration in mitochondria in both morphology and function. A clathrin-mediated endocytosis blocker rescued the exogenous A\u03b2(1-42)-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, the mitochondria-targeted accumulation of A\u03b2(1-42) in HT22 cells using A\u03b2(1-42) with a mitochondria-targeting sequence induced the identical morphological alteration of mitochondria as that observed in the APP/PS AD mouse model and exogenous A\u03b2(1-42)-treated HT22 cells. In addition, subsequent mitochondrial dysfunctions were demonstrated in the mitochondria-specific A\u03b2(1-42) accumulation model, which proved indistinguishable from the mitochondrial impairment induced by exogenous A\u03b2(1-42)-treated HT22 cells. Finally, cellular toxicity was directly induced by mitochondria-targeted A\u03b2(1-42) accumulation, which mimics the apoptosis process in exogenous A\u03b2(1-42)-treated HT22 cells. Taken together, these results indicate that mitochondria-targeted A\u03b2(1-42) accumulation is the necessary and sufficient condition for A\u03b2-mediated mitochondria impairments, and leads directly to cellular death rather than along with other A\u03b2-mediated signaling alterations.", 
    "153": "The aim of the present study was to study the effect of \u03b2-estradiol (\u03b2-E(2)) on the large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated potassium (BK(Ca)) channel in mesenteric artery smooth muscle cells (SMCs). The mesenteric arteries were obtained from post-menopause female patients with abdominal surgery, and the SMCs were isolated from the arteries using an enzymatic disassociation. According to the sources, the SMCs were divided into non-hypertension (NH) and essential hypertension (EH) groups. Single channel patch clamp technique was used to investigate the effect of \u03b2-E(2) and ICI 182780 (a specific blocker of estrogen receptor) on BK(Ca) in the SMCs. The results showed the opening of BK(Ca) in the SMCs was voltage and calcium dependent, and could be blocked by IbTX. \u03b2-E(2) (100 \u03bcmol/L) significantly increased open probability (Po) of BK(Ca) in both NH and EH groups. After \u03b2-E(2) treatment, NH group showed higher Po of BK(Ca) compared with EH group. ICI 182780 could inhibit the activating effect of \u03b2-E(2) on BK(Ca) in no matter NH or EH groups. These results suggest \u03b2-E(2) activates BK(Ca) in mesenteric artery SMCs from post-menopause women via estrogen receptor, but hypertension may decline the activating effect of \u03b2-E(2) on BK(Ca).",

Rabbits with left anterior descending artery ligation were prepared and allowed to recover for 8 weeks, as HMI group. Animals undergoing an identical surgical procedure without coronary ligation were served as the sham-operated group (sham group). Whole cell voltage-clamp techniques were used to measure and compare currents in cells from the different groups. Noting that I(Ca,T) density in HMI cells increased markedly to -2.36 +/- 0.12 pA/pF (at -30 mV) compared with cells of sham, where little I(Ca,T) (-0.35 +/- 0.02 pA/pF) was observed. Meanwhile, further analysis revealed a significant hyperpolarizing shift of steady-state activation curve of I(Ca,T) in HMI cells, where the time constants of deactivation were prolonged and the time of recovery from inactivation was shortened. Finally, the amplitude of I(Ca,T) was increased. Carvedilol (1 micromol x L(-1)) was found to decrease the amplitude of I(Ca,T) to -1.38 +/- 0.07 pA/pF through inhibiting process of I(Ca,T) activation. Furthermore, carvedilol delayed recovery from inactivation of I(Ca,T) and shortened the time constants of deactivation in HMI cells. This study suggested that the application of carvedilol in HMI cells contributes to the dynamic changes in I(Ca,T) and may account for reduction of incidence of arrhythmia after myocardial infarction.",

In vitro, ritobegron decreased the resting tension of the isolated bladder in a concentration-dependent manner (EC(50) 8.2 \u00b1 2.3 \u00d7 10(-7) M; maximal relaxation 88.7 \u00b1 3.7%). The \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptor (AR) antagonist 3-(2-allylphenoxy)-1-[(1S)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphth-1-ylamino]-(2S)-2-propanol hydrochloride (SR58894A) produced a rightward shift of this concentration-response curve without altering the maximal response (pK(B) value 6.56 \u00b1 0.35). In isolated atria, ritobegron increased the atrial rate only at high concentrations (EC(50) 6.5 \u00b1 1.2 \u00d7 10(-5) M). Ritobegron had no effect on tracheal contraction at concentrations from 10(-9) to 10(-4) M, and even at the highest concentration tested, 10(-3) M, the maximal relaxation it induced was only 26.7 \u00b1 8.1%. Tests of the selectivity of ritobegron for the bladder gave values of 79.3- and 1200-fold higher versus atria and trachea, respectively. In the in vivo study ritobegron significantly decreased intravesical pressure (ED(50) 1.44 mg/kg) without affecting either mean blood pressure or heart rate. In conclusion, ritobegron displayed potent and selective \u03b2(3)-AR agonistic activity and relaxed the monkey isolated bladder, and in vivo it decreased intravesical pressure without affecting cardiovascular parameters. These results suggest that ritobegron may be a promising potential agent for the treatment of overactive bladder.", 
    "165": "The aqueous photolysis of beta-blocker atenolol (ATL) using Xe lamp as simulated solar irradiation source was investigated in the presence of nitrate ions. The effects of nitrate ion concentration, solution pH value, and concentration of bicarbonate and humic substance on the photodegradation of ATL were studied. The results showed that photodegradation of ATL in nitrate solution followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. The increasing concentration of nitrate ion promoted the photodegradation rate of ATL. The first-order rate constant increased from 0.002 26 min(-1) to 0.009 4 min(-1) with nitrate concentration increasing from 0 to 5 mmol x L(-1). Acidic or alkaline condition of the solution favored the photodegradation of ATL. Different concentration of bicarbonate showed insignificant effect of the degradation while the increasing concentration of fulvic acid showed inhibiting effect. Hydroxyl radical was determined to be formed during the photolysis process of ATL using isopropanol as molecular probe. The main photoproducts of ATL were identified by using SPE-LC-MS techniques and possible photoinduced degradation pathways in nitrate solution were proposed.", 
    "166": "Evidence assembled in this review indicates that sympathetic nervous system dysfunction is crucial in the development of heart failure and essential hypertension. This takes the form of persistent and adverse activation of sympathetic outflows to the heart and kidneys in both conditions. An important goal for clinical scientists is translation of the knowledge of pathophysiology, such as this, into better treatment for patients. The achievement of this 'mechanisms to management' transition is at different stages of development with regard to the two disorders. Clinical translation is mature in cardiac failure, knowledge of cardiac neural pathophysiology having led to the introduction of beta-adrenergic blockers, an effective therapy. With essential hypertension perhaps we are on the cusp of effective translation, with recent successful testing of selective catheter-based renal sympathetic nerve ablation in patients with resistant hypertension, an intervention firmly based on the demonstration of activation of the renal sympathetic outflow. Additional evidence in this regard is provided by the results of pilot studies exploring the possibility to reduce blood pressure in resistant hypertensives through electrical stimulation of the area of carotid baroreceptors. Despite the general importance of the sympathetic nervous system in blood pressure regulation, and the specific demonstration that the blood pressure elevation in essential hypertension is commonly initiated and sustained by sympathetic nervous activation, drugs antagonizing this system are currently underutilized in the care of patients with hypertension. Use of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs is waning, given the propensity of this drug class to have adverse metabolic effects, including predisposition to diabetes development. The blood pressure lowering achieved with carotid baroreceptor stimulation and with the renal denervation device affirms the importance of the sympathetic nervous system in hypertension pathogenesis, and perhaps suggests a wider role for anti-adrenergic antihypertensives, such as the imidazoline drug class (moxonidine, rilmenidine) which act within the CNS to inhibit central sympathetic outflow, although the lack of large-scale outcome trials with this drug class remains a very material deficiency.", 
    "167": "Recently, adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs) were emerged as an alternative, abundant, and easily accessible source of stem cell therapy. Previous studies revealed losartan (an angiotensin II type I receptor blocker) treatment promoted the healing of skeletal muscle by attenuation of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, which inhibits muscle differentiation. Therefore, we hypothesized that a combined therapy using ASCs and losartan might dramatically improve the muscle remodeling after muscle injury. To determine the combined effect of losartan with ASC transplantation, we created a muscle laceration mouse model. EGFP-labeled ASCs were locally transplanted to the injured gastrocnemius muscle after muscle laceration. The dramatic muscle regeneration and the remarkably inhibited muscular fibrosis were observed by combined treatment. Transplanted ASCs fused with the injured or differentiating myofibers. Myotube formation was also enhanced by ASC(+) satellite coculture and losartan treatment. Thus, the present study indicated that ASC transplantation effect for skeletal muscle injury can be dramatically improved by losartan treatment inducing better niche.",

A total of 7066 consecutive patients hospitalized with HF at Hamad General Hospital, Doha, Qatar, from 1991 through 2010 were studied. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to age: group 1, 50 years and younger; group 2, older than 50 and up to 70 years; and group 3, older than 70 years. The prevalence of hypertension, chronic renal impairment, and atrial fibrillation increased with increased age. On admission, the older the age of the HF patient, the less likely they were to receive \u03b2-blockers and vasodilators. In-hospital mortality rate was higher in older patients when compared with the younger groups (10.6% group 3 vs 7% group 1 and 7.2% group 2; P=.001). During the study period, the relative reduction in mortality rates was higher in the younger when compared with the older patients (55%, 49%, and 41%, respectively). The clinical characteristics of Middle-Eastern HF patients vary considerably according to age. Over time, an overall marked improvement in hospital survival for HF was observed, which was associated with progressively increased treatment with evidence-based therapies. This survival improvement over time appears to be less pronounced in the elderly.", 
    "169": "Epinephrine and norepinephrine are produced during psychological stress and can directly bind to cells to induce DNA damage. These effects may have more long-lasting consequences such as DNA mutations resulting in an increased potential for cellular transformation and/or tumor progression. This study examined the molecular effects of a chronic (24 h) in vitro exposure to these stress hormones on murine 3T3 cells. Long exposures (24 h) in dose-response experiments with norepinephrine or epinephrine induced significant increases in DNA damage in treated cells compared to that of untreated controls as measured by the alkaline comet assay. Pre-treatment with a blocking agent (the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol) eliminated this increase in damage. In addition, both norepinephrine and epinephrine increased cellular transformation, as assessed by growth in soft agar, and 3T3 cells pre-treated with either norepinephrine or epinephrine induced a more rapid onset of tumors and more aggressive tumor growth in nude mice. In summary, incubation of 3T3 cells with catecholamines results in long-term DNA damage as measured by increased transformed phenotypes and tumor progression, indicating that they are important mediators of stress effects on genomic instability and vulnerability to tumor formation.",

Here we present the case of a 29-year-old male patient with chronic hepatitis B diagnosis who developed type 1 diabetes mellitus and autoimmune thyroiditis during treatment with interferon alfa-2b. Within four months of initiation of treatment with interferon alfa-2b, the patient presented to our clinic with dry mouth, urinary frequency (8 to 10 times per day), drinking plenty of water, night time urination, and tiredness. He was admitted to the clinic when his fasting blood glucose level was detected to be high. After examinations, the patient was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and autoimmune thyroiditis and began to receive treatment with insulin and propranolol. Fasting blood glucose levels were controlled and thyroid hormones decreased to normal levels within one month after the treatments began. For patients who will receive treatment with interferon alpha, especially those individuals with chronic hepatitis, pancreatic autoantibodies should be checked and close monitoring should be performed as there may be glucose tolerance impairment in patients with high titers.

    "180": "Beta-blockers, prescribed for the treatment of high blood pressure and for long-term use after a heart attack, have been detected in surface and ground waters. This study examines the photochemical fate of three beta-blockers, atenolol, metoprolol, and nadolol. Hydrolysis accounted for minor losses of these beta-blockers in the pH range 4-10. The rate of direct photolysis at pH 7 in a solar simulator varied from 6.1 to 8.9h(-1) at pH 7. However, the addition of a natural organic matter (NOM) isolate enhanced the photochemical loss of all three compounds. Indirect photochemical fate, generally described by reactions with hydroxyl radical (OH) and singlet oxygen ((1)\u0394O(2)), and, the direct reaction with the triplet excited state, (3)NOM(\u204e), also varied but collectively appeared to be the major loss factor. Bimolecular reaction rate constants of the three beta-blockers with (1)\u0394O(2) and OH were measured and accounted for 0.02-0.04% and 7.2-38.9% of their loss, respectively. These data suggest that the (3)NOM(\u204e) contributed 50.6-85.4%. Experiments with various (3)NOM(\u204e) quenchers supported the hypothesis that it was singly the most important reaction. Atenolol was chosen for more detailed investigation, with the photoproducts identified by LC-MS analysis.

    "181": "Although memory for emotionally arousing and stressful experiences is strong and resistant to change, recent years have witnessed rapidly emerging evidence for the plasticity of fear memories. Upon retrieval a memory may be rendered labile and vulnerable to the disruptive effects of amnestic agents. This process is referred to as \"disrupting reconsolidation\" and may point to a novel therapeutic strategy for the permanent reduction of fear in patients suffering from anxiety disorders. However, the fear-reducing effects are thus far only demonstrated for freezing reactions in rodents and autonomic fear responding in humans. If disrupting reconsolidation will be of value for clinical practice, it should also target the subjective feelings of anxiety. Using an instructed fear-learning paradigm in humans, we here tested whether disrupting reconsolidation would diminish the subjective feelings of anxiety for a noxious event that was anticipated but never actually experienced. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade during reconsolidation strongly diminished the behavioral expression of the instructed fear memory (i.e., startle responding) as well as the subjective feelings of anxiety 24h later, yet without affecting both the physiological and cognitive component of the anticipation of threat (i.e., skin conductance responding, expectancy ratings). Together, the present findings suggest that the various memory traces of a learned fear association do not necessarily undergo reconsolidation in harmony. Considering that patients with anxiety disorders (1) often fear objects and situations that they have never actually experienced, and (2) primarily suffer from the subjective feelings of anxiety, the present findings may have important ramifications for psychotherapy.",

Propranolol-associated adverse effects occurred in two patients. One infant had occasional tachypnea, and the other had occasional pale-looking appearance. The symptoms resolved after dosage tapering.",

    "186": "To evaluate whether cervical spinal neurons can influence cardiac indices and myocyte viability in the acutely ischemic heart, the hearts of anesthetized rabbits subjected to 30 min of LAD coronary arterial occlusion (CAO) were studied 3h after reperfusion. Control animals were compared to those exposed to pre-emptive high cervical cord stimulation (SCS; the dorsal aspect of the C1-C2 spinal cord was stimulated electrically at 50 Hz; 0.2 ms; 90% of motor threshold, starting 15 min prior to and continuing throughout CAO). Four groups of animals were so tested: 1) neuroaxis intact; 2) prior cervical vagotomy; 3) prior transection of the dorsal spinal columns at C6; and 4) following pharmacological treatment [muscarinic (atropine) or adrenergic (atenolol, prazosin or yohimbine) receptor blockade]. Infarct size (IS) was measured by tetrazolium, expressed as percentage of risk zone. C1-C2 SCS reduced acute ischemia induced IS by 43%, without changing the incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD). While SCS-induced reduction in IS was unaffected by vagotomy, it was no longer evident following transection of C6 dorsal columns or atropinization. Beta-adrenoceptor blockade eliminated ischemia induced SCD, while alpha-receptor blockade doubled its incidence. During SCS, myocardial ischemia induced SCD was eliminated following vagotomy while remaining unaffected by atropinization. These data indicate that, in contrast to thoracic spinal neurons, i) cranial cervical spinal neurons affect both adrenergic and cholinergic motor outflows to the heart such that ii) their activation modifies ventricular infarct size and lethal arrhythmogenesis.", 
    "187": "The subcutaneous and systemic injection of serotonin reduces cutaneous and visceral pain thresholds and increases responses to noxious stimuli. Different subtypes of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors are suggested to be associated with different types of pain responses. Here we show that serotonin also inhibits catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme that contributes to modultion the perception of pain, via non-competitive binding to the site bound by catechol substrates with a binding affinity comparable to the binding affinity of catechol itself (K(i)\u2009=\u200944 \u03bcM). Using computational modeling, biochemical tests and cellular assays we show that serotonin actively competes with the methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) within the catalytic site. Binding of serotonin to the catalytic site inhibits the access of SAM, thus preventing methylation of COMT substrates. The results of in vivo animal studies show that serotonin-induced pain hypersensitivity in mice is reduced by either SAM pretreatment or by the combined administration of selective antagonists for \u03b2(2)- and \u03b2(3)-adrenergic receptors, which have been previously shown to mediate COMT-dependent pain signaling. Our results suggest that inhibition of COMT via serotonin binding contributes to pain hypersensitivity, providing additional strategies for the treatment of clinical pain conditions.", 
    "188": "A chiral monolithic capillary column for rapid enantioseparation was prepared by covalently bonding of cellulose tris(4-methylbenzoate) (CTMB) on N-acryloxysuccinimide-based monolith. The preparation and derivatization conditions of the monolithic column were optimized. The successful grafting of CTMB was confirmed on the characterizations of the infrared spectrum and the cathodic electroosmotic flow (EOF). The effects of acetic acid concentration and methanol content on the enantioseparation were studied. The solvent resistance, reproducibility and stability of the monolithic column have also been investigated. The rapid enantioseparation of the five solutes (phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, propranolol and phenylethanol) with resolution (R(s)) values up to 1.31 was achieved within 1.2 min on the prepared chiral capillary monolithic column by capillary electrochromatography.", 
    "189": "A high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with column-switching was developed and validated for rapid determination of two propranolol enantiomers in rat plasma. The column of restricted-access media was used as a pre-treatment column and a Chiralcel OD-RH was used as analytical column. The plasma samples were injected directly into the pretreatment column to remove plasma protein and endogenous constituents as well as to retent the propranolol enantiomers in the column using the mobile phase of borate buffer (pH 8.5)-methanol (95:5, v/v) at the flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Then the propranolol enantiomers were transferred to the Chiralcel OD-RH column using the mobile phase of isopropanol-ethanol-0.2 mmol/L borate buffer (pH 8.5) (30: 30: 40, v/v/v) at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min by column-switching technology. The column-switching time was 3.0 min, the used wavelength was 293 nm and the column temperature was set at 25 degrees C. The calibration curve showed excellent linear relationship (r = 0.999 5) in the concentration range from 25 mg/L to 500 mg/L for propranolol enantiomers in plasma. The intra-day and inter-day assay precisions and accuracies were well and the relative standard deviations (RSDs) were less than 5%. The average recoveries (n = 6) of the two enantiomers at 3 spiked levels were from 97.89% to 101.56%. All the values of the method validation were within the generally accepted criteria for biological sample analysis. The results show that the method is convenient, quick, sensitive and accurate. The method was successfully applied in the determination of propranolol enantiomers in rat blood pharmacokinetics study.", 
    "190": "Patients with inherited cardiac channel disorders are at high risk of perioperative lethal arrhythmias. Preoperative control of symptoms and a multidisciplinary approach are required for a well-planned management. Good haemodynamic monitoring, adequate anaesthesia and analgesia, perioperative maintenance of normocarbia, normothermia, and normovolaemia are important. In congenital long QT syndrome, torsades de pointes should be prevented with magnesium sulphate infusion and avoidance of drugs such as droperidol, succinylcholine, ketamine, and ondansetron. Propofol and epidural anaesthesia represent safe choices, while caution is needed with volatile agents. In Brugada syndrome, \u03b2-blockers, \u03b1-agonists, and cholinergic drugs should be avoided, while isoproterenol reverses the ECG changes. Propofol, thiopental, and volatiles have been used uneventfully. In congenital sick sinus syndrome, severe bradycardia resistant to atropine may require isoproterenol or epinephrine. Anaesthetics with vagolytic properties are preferable, while propofol and vecuronium should be given with caution due to risk of inducing bradyarrhythmias. Neuraxial anaesthesia should produce the least autonomic imbalance. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy induces ventricular tachyarrhythmias, which should be treated with \u03b2-blockers. Generally, \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation and catecholamine release should be avoided. Halothane and pancuronium are contraindicated, while large doses of local anaesthetics and epinephrine should be avoided in neuraxial blocks. In catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, \u03b2-blocker treatment should be continued perioperatively. Catecholamine release and \u03b2-agonists, such as isoproterenol, should be avoided. Propofol and remifentanil are probably safe, while halothane and pancuronium are contraindicated. Regional anaesthesia, without epinephrine, is relatively safe. In suspicious cardiac deaths, postmortem examination and familial screening are recommended.", 
    "191": "Recent studies have reported that in patients under antihypertensive treatment visit-to-visit (or long-term) variability of clinic BP within a given patient has an independent prognostic significance. Partly based on between-patient dispersion of BP values during treatment (interindividual variability) it has also been reported that long-term clinic BP variability is greater for \u03b2-blocker than for calcium antagonist and other types of treatment.",

    "193": "Long-term intraindividual BP variability was defined as the coefficient of variation of the average systolic or diastolic values of clinic and 24-h BP measured at each visit throughout the treatment period. Patients in whom at least seven clinic (6-month intervals) or at least three (yearly intervals) 24-h values were available from the end of the drug titration phase to the end of the study were considered.", 
    "194": "Visit-to-visit 24-h SBP/DBP variabilities were 20-25% smaller than, and loosely correlated with clinic BP variability (r(2)\u200a<\u200a0.022). There was also a very limited relationship (r\u200a(2)<\u200a0.026) between visit-to-visit and within 24-h ambulatory BP variabilities, the latter being two to three times greater than the former. Visit-to-visit intraindividual clinic SBP variability was only slightly lower on calcium antagonist than on \u03b2-blocker treatment but little or no between-treatment difference was found for visit-to-visit clinic DBP and ambulatory SBP/DBP particularly in patients under monotherapy throughout the study. Interindividual BP variability was markedly greater than the intra-individiual one of which it did not precisely reflect the treatment-induced changes.", 
    "195": "In mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients, visit-to-visit BP variability does not differ substantially between \u03b2-blocker and calcium antagonist treatment. Major discrepancies exist between visit-to-visit BP variability as quantified by 24-h vs. clinic BP, making investigation of which of these indices is clinically more relevant important. Interindividual BP variability during treatment shows marked quantitative differences with intraindividual BP variability questioning whether its use can accurately reflect individual BP variations from one visit to another.", 
    "196": "The Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study has previously demonstrated a beneficial effect of losartan compared to atenolol-based antihypertensive treatment in patients with essential hypertension and left-ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). However, patient age often influences the choice of antihypertensive drugs. Therefore, we investigated the influence of age on the effects of losartan versus atenolol-based antihypertensive treatment.", 
    "197": "A total of 9193 hypertensive patients with LVH aged 45-83 years were followed for a mean of 4.8 years. Blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), Sokolow-Lyon voltage, Cornell voltage-duration product and urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) were measured yearly throughout the study. Patients were divided into two age groups according to the median age of 67 years and the effects of losartan versus atenolol-based antihypertensive treatment on the primary composite endpoint (CEP) consisting of cardiovascular death, nonfatal stroke or nonfatal myocardial infarction were investigated.", 
    "198": "The beneficial effect of losartan versus atenolol-based treatment was greater in the group of patients older than 67 years [hazard ratio 0.79 (0.69-0.91), P\u200a=\u200a0.001] compared to the group of patients younger than 67 years [hazard ratio 1.03 (0.82-1.28), P\u200a=\u200a0809], P\u200a=\u200a0.045 for interaction. The beneficial effects of losartan versus atenolol-based antihypertensive treatment on pulse pressure, HDL-C, UACR, and Cornell and Sokolow-Lyon voltage were not more pronounced in patients older than 67 years compared to patients younger than 67 years. All five risk factors considered as time-varying covariates predicted CEP independently (P\u200a<\u200a0.01) with the exception of pulse pressure (P\u200a=\u200a0.37) and the interaction between age and treatment on outcome remained significant (P\u200a=\u200a0.042).", 
    "199": "We showed a greater beneficial effect of losartan versus atenolol-based antihypertensive treatment in the group of patients older than 67 years compared to the group of patients younger than 67 years.

Moreover, there are no well-known characteristics that can affect the rate of involution of IHs and to predict its completion. Accordingly, intervention is frequently indicated. Different modalities have been reported for treatment of IHs. The possible mechanisms of action of propranolol on IHs are complex.",

    "202": "The first noticeable effects on propranolol treatment were the changes in color and softening of IHs, followed by regression of their sizes. The clinically elicited color changes of superficial IHs and superficial components of compound IHs have been objectively proven by statistically significant color clearance (P \u2264 .001) and resisting index (P \u2264 .01) (\u223c50% increase) as a good indicator of lower vascular activity within IHs. Moreover, the softening of lesions followed by the clinically elicited regression of sizes of deep IHs and deep components of compound IHs has been objectively proven by statistically significant changes at lesions' thickness (P \u2264 .01) (\u223c50% regression) and resisting index (P \u2264 .01) (\u223c50% increase).",

However, propranolol treatment of IHs is still an issue suitable for more studies to confirm the safety and efficacy of the drug and to investigate whether there are some hemangiomas that are, perhaps, nonresponsive to propranolol treatment.", 
    "204": "The extensive utilization of \u03b2-blockers worldwide led to frequent detection in natural water. In this study the photolysis behavior of atenolol (ATL) and toxicity of its photodegradation products were investigated in the presence of nitrate ions. The results showed that ATL photodegradation followed pseudo-first-order kinetics upon simulated solar irradiation. The photodegradation was found to be dependent on nitrate concentration and increasing the nitrate from 0.5 mML(-1) to 10 mML(-1) led to the enhancement of rate constant from 0.00101 min(-1) to 0.00716 min(-1). Hydroxyl radical was determined to play a key role in the photolysis process by using isopropanol as molecular probe. Increasing the solution pH from 4.8 to 10.4, the photodegradation rate slightly decreased from 0.00246 min(-1) to 0.00195 min(-1), probably due to pH-dependent effect of nitrate-induced .OH formation. Bicarbonate decreased the photodegradation of ATL in the presence of nitrate ions mainly through pH effect, while humic substance inhibited the photodegradation via both attenuating light and competing radicals. Upon irradiation for 240 min, only 10% reduction of total organic carbon (TOC) can be achieved in spite of 72% transformation rate of ATL, implying a majority of ATL transformed into intermediate products rather than complete mineralization. The main photoproducts of ATL were identified by using solid phase extraction-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS) techniques and possible nitrate-induced photodegradation pathways were proposed. The toxicity of the phototransformation products was evaluated using aquatic species Daphnia magna, and the results revealed that photodegradation was an effective mechanism for ATL toxicity reduction in natural waters.", 
    "205": "Cardioselective \u03b2 blockers are considered to have little impact on lung function at rest in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, their effects on dynamic hyperinflation, an important mechanism contributing to symptoms and exercise tolerance in patients with COPD, have not been evaluated. Twenty-seven patients with moderate to severe COPD (forced expiratory volume in 1 second 52 \u00b1 13% predicted) completed pulmonary function tests, echocardiography, maximal exercise tests, and cycle endurance tests at baseline. Inspiratory capacity was measured at 2-minute intervals during the cycle endurance test to quantify dynamic hyperinflation. Pulmonary function and cycle endurance testing were repeated after 14 days of bisoprolol 10 mg/day and 14 days of placebo in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. The extent of dynamic hyperinflation at peak isotime exercise with bisoprolol and placebo was compared. Peak isotime was defined as the latest time point that was reached during the 2 cycle endurance tests. Changes in inspiratory capacity from rest to peak isotime were different with bisoprolol compared to placebo (-0.50 \u00b1 0.35 vs -0.41 \u00b1 0.33 L, p = 0.01). Exercise duration tended to be lower with bisoprolol compared to placebo (305 \u00b1 125 vs 353 \u00b1 172 seconds, p = 0.11). The magnitude of change in exercise duration between the bisoprolol and placebo conditions was correlated with the magnitude of change in inspiratory capacity (r = 0.57, p <0.01). In conclusion, bisoprolol was associated with modest worsening dynamic hyperinflation, whereas exercise duration remained unchanged in patients with moderate to severe COPD. The magnitude of these effects was small and should not contraindicate the use of bisoprolol in patients with COPD.",

    "210": "Myocyte contractility, Ca(2+) handling and excitation-contraction coupling were studied in isolated cardiomyocytes from wild-type and GRK2 knockout (GRK2KO) mice without (sham) or with myocardial infarction (MI). In cardiac myocytes isolated from unstressed wild-type and GRK2KO hearts, myocyte contractions and Ca(2+) transients were similar, but GRK2KO myocytes had lower sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) content because of increased sodium-Ca(2+) exchanger activity and inhibited SR Ca(2+) ATPase by local protein kinase A-mediated activation of phosphodiesterase 4 resulting in hypophosphorylated phospholamban. This Ca(2+) handling phenotype is explained by a higher fractional SR Ca(2+) release induced by increased L-type Ca(2+) channel currents. After \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation, GRK2KO myocytes revealed significant increases in contractility and Ca(2+) transients, which were not mediated through cardiac L-type Ca(2+) channels but through an increased SR Ca(2+). Interestingly, post-MI GRK2KO mice showed better cardiac function than post-MI control mice, which is explained by an improved Ca(2+) handling phenotype. The SR Ca(2+) content was better maintained in post-MI GRK2KO myocytes than in post-MI control myocytes because of better-maintained L-type Ca(2+) channel current density and no increase in sodium-Ca(2+) exchanger in GRK2KO myocytes. An L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker, verapamil, reversed some beneficial effects of GRK2KO.",
