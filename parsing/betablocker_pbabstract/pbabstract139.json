Several physiological studies have implicated PLC-linked pathways in in-vivo pain regulation and opioid tolerance. Co-administration of PLC-beta(2/3) activity blocker M119 with morphine resulted in a dramatic increase in morphine-induced amnesic effect in mice, proving a role for beta subunit of PLC enzyme in these processes. Administration of morphine to mice at amnesic dose increased PLC-beta(3) activity, with respect to basal value, in the membrane-soluble material from anterior cortex and hippocampal formation in brain areas. PLC-beta(3) appears to be simultaneously implicated in both analgesic and amnesic effects induced by administration of morphine to mice suggesting a commonality in the molecular mechanisms of morphine-induced analgesia and memory impairment.",

Anticoagulants were continued throughout the study regardless of rhythm, unless contraindications developed. Both groups were treated with beta blockers and/or digoxin to reduce the heart rate to <80 bpm at rest and <110 bpm after walking.

However, no oral data are available in vervets to evaluate cross-species predictive performance. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the use of the vervet to predict human oral pharmacokinetics and drug interactions. Oral pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in the vervet for eight compounds: phenytoin, moxifloxacin, erythromycin, lidocaine, propranolol, ciprofloxacin, metroprolol, and prednisolone. To assess drug-drug interactions, co-administration experiments were conducted with ketoconazole and either propranolol or erythromycin. In general, the vervet provided similar predictivity for human oral exposure as cynomolgus or rhesus monkeys. In all non-human primates, human exposure to phenytoin would be over-predicted, and erythromycin, lidocaine, and propranolol under-predicted, with good predictivity for the other compounds studied. Furthermore, in the vervet, ketoconazole co-administration resulted in a six-fold increase in exposure to erythromycin, demonstrating proof of concept for drug-drug interaction screening.

The flux rates of the four drugs were influenced by the length of the experiment. Both class 1 drugs showed a significantly higher mean flux rate between 2 and 6 h across the jejunal mucosa compared to the class 3 drugs. The results are therefore in line with the drugs' BCS classification.

Biol. 10:11-15, 2009.-When advising travelers to high altitude, clinicians should consider how their patient's underlying medical conditions may be affected by the high altitude and whether changes are necessary in their medical regimen. Given the high prevalence of hypertension in the general population, it is a common medical condition that is often considered in this regard. Little information exists, however, to guide the management of this condition at high altitude. This review considers the available data regarding systemic blood pressure responses and the risks of worsening blood pressure control at high altitude and which antihypertensive medications are more effective for blood pressure control in this environment. The available evidence suggests blood pressure rises to a modest extent in patients with mild to moderate hypertension upon acute ascent to high altitude, but there is no clear evidence of an increased risk of complications due to these increased pressures. There is, however, marked interindividual variability in blood pressure responses at altitude; as a result, patients with poorly controlled or very labile hypertension should monitor their blood pressure upon ascent to high altitude and travel with a plan for altering their medical regimen in the event marked or symptomatic blood pressure elevations occur.",

However, with the correct clinical skill and experience, most geriatric heart failure can be properly diagnosed and managed. Management of geriatric heart failure can be simplified by following this useful mnemonic: DEFEAT Heart Failure. This covers the essential aspects of geriatric heart failure management: Diagnosis, Etiology, Fluid, Ejection fraAction, and Treatment. The process begins with a clinical Diagnosis, which must be established, before ordering an echocardiogram, as nearly half of all geriatric heart failure patients have normal left ventricular ejection fraction. Because heart failure is a syndrome and not a disease, an underlying Etiology must be sought and determined. Determination of the Fluid volume status by careful examination of the external jugular veins in the neck is vital to achieve euvolemia. An echocardiography should be ordered to obtain left ventricular Ejection frAction to assess prognosis and guide Therapy. However, if left ventricular ejection fraction cannot be determined, as in many developing nations, all geriatric heart failure patients should be treated as if they have low ejection fraction, and should be prescribed an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a beta-blocker. Diuretic and digoxin should be prescribed for all symptomatic patients with heart failure. An aldosterone antagonist may be used in select patients with advanced systolic heart failure, carefully avoiding hyperkalemia.",

Experiments have been carried out on 32 pubertal white rats (with body mass 220-250 g). Oxidative stress was induced through perfusion of hydrogen peroxide (with concentration - 4.10 -5 M). Obtained results were analyzed statistically according to the Student's t criterion. Studies have shown that carvedilol and trimetazidin have well expressed antioxidant and cardio protective effects at oxidative stress provoked by hydrogen peroxide compared to lozartan. Moreover, effect of carvedilol on HR and VsCBf was especially obvious than effects of Trimetazidin. Antioxidant and positive treatment effects of carvedilol could be explained by its wide range of pharmacological ability: as nonselective beta-adrenoblocker (via inhibition of adenylatecyclase and decreasing cyclic adenosinemonophosphate), alpha 1-adrenoblocker (decreasing activation of phospholipase C and concentration of inositoltriphosphate, diacylglicerole and Ca(++)) and antioxidant. It is suggested that positive effects of carvedilol on HR and VsCBf at oxidative stress are related with wide range of pharmacological mechanisms of preparation. Cardio protective effects of carvedilol at oxidative stress (revealed in our experiments) along with other positive cardio - hemodynamic peculiarities perhaps is very important and could be used successfully at treatment of cardio-vascular system diseases.",

In addition to these well known beneficial effects of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents it has been demonstrated, that the adrenergic system is involved in the modulation of cellular immune functions. Therefore, the immunomodulatory properties of beta-adrenergic antagonists have been established during the last years and the scientific focus was addressed on the proposed immunologic side effects of a beta-adrenergic blockade and its potential effect on the clinical course of critical illness. This manuscript reviews the rational and the effect of the therapeutic use of beta-adrenergic antagonists in critically ill patients on the base of the current literature and further emphasizes on potential immunologic side effects.",

These studies investigated the hemodynamic and cardiac effects of monoblockade and coblockade of renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems. Stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (16 weeks old; male; n=12 per group) received the sympatholytic imidazoline compound, moxonidine (2.4 mg/kg per day); the angiotensin-receptor blocker eprosartan (30 mg/kg per day), separately or in combination; or saline vehicle for 8 weeks, SC, via osmotic minipumps. Blood pressure and heart rate were continuously measured by radiotelemetry. After 8 weeks, in vivo cardiac function and structure were measured by transthoracic echocardiography and a Millar conductance catheter, and the rats were then euthanized and blood and heart ventricles collected for various determinations. Compared with vehicle, the subhypotensive dose of moxonidine resulted in lower (P<0.01) heart rate, left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area, interleukin 1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and mRNA for natriuretic peptides. Eprosartan reduced pressure (P<0.01), as well as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 44 phosphorylation, Bax/Bcl-2, and collagen I/III, and improved left ventricular diastolic function (P<0.03). Combined treatment resulted in greater reductions in blood pressure, heart rate, left ventricular hypertrophy, collagen I/III, and inhibited inducible NO synthase and increased endothelial NO synthase phosphorylation, as well as reduced left ventricular anterior wall thickness, without altering the other parameters. Thus, in advanced hypertension complicated with cardiac fibrosis, sympathetic inhibition and angiotensin II blockade resulted in greater reduction in blood pressure and heart rate, inhibition of inflammation, and improved left ventricular pathology but did not add to the benefits of angiotensin II blockade on cardiac function.",

To evaluate the feasibility of this approach, we assessed the apparent permeability (P(app)) of mouse intestine for a set of marker compounds [atenolol, paracellular transport; metoprolol, transcellular transport; talinolol, P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated efflux] in both wild-type and P-gp-deficient mice. In wild-type mice, the observed P(app) values for atenolol (1.8 +/- 0.3 x 10(-6) cm/s) and metoprolol (50.2 +/- 20.1 x 10(-6) cm/s) were not significantly affected by inclusion of the P-gp inhibitor verapamil. In contrast, the P(app) value for talinolol (0.9 +/- 0.3 x 10(-6) cm/s) increased 5-fold in the presence of verapamil. The similarity between these values and previously determined P(app) values in rats indicates comparable passive barrier functions and P-gp-mediated efflux transport between mice and rats. In comparison with wild-type mice, the apparent permeability in P-gp-deficient mdr1a/1b(-/-) mice was significantly altered for talinolol (7-fold increase) but not for atenolol or metoprolol. Because of the availability of knockout mice, the intestinal perfusion technique with mesenteric blood sampling in mice may become an important tool to elucidate the role of intestinal metabolism and active transport in drug absorption during preclinical drug evaluation.",

The main syndrome of preterm birth is caused by uterus contractions from excitatory factors. Administration of tocolytic agents is a strategy to prevent the occurrence of preterm births. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of oroxylin A on contractions of uterine strips isolated from non-pregnant female Wistar rats (250-350 g). Contractions of the uterus were induced with acetylcholine (Ach) (1 microM), PGF2alpha (0.1 microM), oxytocin (10-3 U/ml), KCl (56.3 mM), tetraethylammonium (TEA; 1 and 10 mM), 4-aminopyridine (4-AP; 5 mM), glipizide (30 microM), a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor (LNNA; 10-3M), a beta-receptor blocker (propranolol; 10 microM), and a cyclooxygenase inhibitor (indomethacin; 60 microM). The inhibitory effects of the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous contractions by oroxylin A were antagonized with Ach (IC50 22.85 microM), PGF2alpha (IC5027.28 microM), oxytocin (IC50 12.34 microM), TEA; 1 and 10 mM (IC50 52.73 and 76.43 microM), 4-AP (IC50 67.16 microM), and glipizide (IC5027.53 microM), but oroxylin A was not influenced by Ca2+-free medium, LNNA, propranolol, or indomethacin. Otherwise, oroxylin A-mediated relaxation of the rat uterus might occur through opening of uterine calcium-dependent potassium channels or adenosine triphosphate potassium channel activation.

The internalization of G3 and G3P2 dendrimers involved both caveolae-dependent endocytosis and macropinocytosis pathways; internalization of G3L2P2 dendrimer appeared to involve caveolae-dependent, and possibly clathrin-dependent, endocytosis pathways; and internalization of G3L2 dendrimer occurred via caveolae-dependent, clathrin-dependent, and macropinocytosis pathways. Subcellular colocalization data indicated that unmodified and all surface-modified G3 PAMAM dendrimers were internalized and trafficked to endosomes and lysosomes. It is therefore apparent that the initial mode of dendrimer internalization into HT-29 cells is influenced by the surface properties of G3 PAMAM dendrimer.", 
    "50": "It is well established that the serotonergic system (SS) plays important roles in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. However, the impact of serotonin and its inter-relation with the sympathoadrenal system (SAS) in chronic heart failure (CHF) is poorly understood.", 
    "51": "Utilizing high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, we determined blood plasma levels of serotonin (5-hydroxy-triptamine, [5-HT](p)), 5- hydroxy-indole-acetic acid ([5-HIAA](p)), epinephrine ([E](p)), norepinephrine ([NE](p)), 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenyl-alanine ([DOPA](p)), dopamine ([DA](p)) and the platelet concentration of serotonin ([5-HT](pt)) in CHF patients with different morphofunctional alterations of myocardium. The morphofunctional alterations included diastolic dysfunction (DD), diastolic dysfunction with left ventricular hypertrophy (DD&LVH), and diastolic and systolic dysfunction (D&SD).", 
    "52": "All CHF groups showed significant rises of [5-HT](p) and [5-HT](pt). DD&LVH and D&SD individuals also had increased [5-HIAA](p). Levels of SAS blood biomarkers were also significantly changed. The correlation between SS and SAS was increased in CHF and corresponded with disease severity.", 
    "53": "These results clearly demonstrate that in CHF patients significant changes in SS and SAS occur, which are thought to relate to the morphofunctional alterations of myocardium. The observed changes in the levels of these biomarkers may serve as potential surrogates to monitor severity of disease, to evaluate response to drug treatment, and as a rational basis for new therapeutic approaches.", 
    "54": "The simultaneous determination of levodopa (LD) and propranolol (PRO) using fluorescence spectrometric technique is described. The method involves measuring the natural fluorescence of these drugs in the micellar media of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) using principal component analysis-feed-forward neural networks (PC-FFNNs). Experimental conditions such as effect of pH and SDS concentration were optimized. Under the optimum conditions, the linear determination ranges of LD and PRO are 2.0 x 10(-8) to 1.0 x 10(-5)mol L(-1) and 3.6 x 10(-9) to 1.8 x 10(-6)mol L(-1), respectively. A set of synthetic binary mixtures of LD and PRO was prepared and their concentrations were predicted by the proposed method. Satisfactory results were obtained by the combination of fluorescence technique with chemometrics methods. The method was successfully applied to the determination of LD and PRO in tap water and in urine samples.", 
    "55": "Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (EF) has a high prevalence in the geriatric population, and this cohort may be at risk of complications caused by polypharmacy. Effects of commonly used cardiac medications on long-term survival of patients >80 years with HF and preserved left ventricular EF were assessed. One hundred forty-two patients were evaluated. During a 5-year follow-up, 98 patients died (69%). There were no significant differences in baseline parameters in patients who died compared with those who survived at 5 years. None of the drug therapies appeared to make a significant difference in long-term survival, including beta blockers (p = 0.89), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (p = 0.91), calcium channel blockers (p = 0.69), diuretics (p = 0.30), digoxin (p = 0.22), and statins (p = 0.32). In conclusion, based on the present data, it appears that use of certain common cardiac medications may not be associated with a significant effect on long-term survival in octogenarians with HF and preserved EF.", 
    "56": "This article reports the development and delivery properties of swellable drug-polyelectrolyte matrices prepared with complexes of the acid form of carboxymethylcellulose (HCMC). Drug-polyelelectrolyte complexes (HCMC-D) were obtained by neutralization of HCMC with two model basic drugs (atenolol and metoclopramide). Characterization through FT-infrared spectroscopy, power X-ray diffraction, and DSC indicates the ionic nature of the interaction between the carboxylic groups of HCMC and the basic group of D. Matrices prepared by compacting (HCMC-D) alone or in a mixture with sodium carboxymethylcellulose were subjected to measurements of solvent up-take, dynamics of swelling, and release kinetics. Delivery rate of mixed matrices is a function of its composition and may be widely modulated. They exhibited anomalous delivery kinetics with Korsmeyer exponent n in the range 0.67-0.87. Experimental results indicate that the erosion of the hydrogel layer is the main delivery process.",

    "58": "For 555 patients who underwent vasodilator MPI and had coronary angiography within 90 days, global and per-vessel sensitivities and specificities were calculated, and were found to be similar between patients taking beta-blockers and those who were not. beta-blockers did not decrease the ability to detect patients with multivessel disease. Summed stress scores and summed rest scores were likewise similar in both groups. To account in part for catheterization referral bias and the potential of false-negative MPI studies in patients receiving beta-blockers, survival analysis was performed on 2646 patients with normal MPI studies who did not undergo cardiac catheterization and failed to demonstrate significant mortality difference related to the taking of beta-blockers.",

All patients (810 AF cases, 1,512 control subjects) were members of Group Health (GH), an integrated health-care delivery system, were pharmacologically treated for hypertension, and did not have heart failure. Medical records were reviewed to confirm the diagnosis of incident AF and to collect information on medical conditions and health behaviors. Information on antihypertensive medications was obtained from a pharmacy database.",

    "64": "The effect of acute resistance exercise (RE) on whole body energy expenditure (EE) and alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor (alpha(2)-AR) regulation of lipolysis in subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (SCAAT) was determined in sedentary lean (LN) and obese (OB) men. Lipolysis was monitored using microdialysis in 10 LN [body mass index (BMI) 20.9 +/- 0.6] and 10 OB (BMI 36.2 +/- 2.7) men before, during, and for 24 h after RE. EE was measured before and immediately after RE for 40 min. Changes in interstitial glycerol were measured in SCAAT with three microdialysis probes perfused with a control solution, phentolamine (alpha(2)-AR antagonist), or propranolol (beta-AR antagonist). EE and fat oxidation (FOX) were significantly (P < 0.001) elevated immediately post-RE compared with pre-RE in LN and OB subjects, with no differences between groups. RE-induced increases in SCAAT glycerol concentrations from rest to peak exercise were greater in LN than in OB men in the control (LN 142.1 +/- 30.8 vs. OB 65.4 +/- 14.2%, P = 0.03) and phentolamine probes (LN 187.2 +/- 29.6 vs. OB 66.7 +/- 11.0%, P = 0.002). Perfusion of propranolol had no effect on interstitial glycerol concentrations over the time course of the experiment in either group. Plasma insulin concentrations were significantly lower (P = 0.002) and plasma growth hormone (GH) was significantly higher (P = 0.03) in LN compared with OB men. The mechanism behind RE contributing to improved body composition may in part be due to enhanced SCAAT lipolysis and improved EE and FOX in response to RE in LN and OB men. The blunted SCAAT lipolytic response to RE in OB compared with LN men is unrelated to RE-induced catecholamine activation of the antilipolytic alpha(2)-ARs and may be due to depressed GH in OB subjects.", 
    "65": "Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a heterogeneous collection of inherited cardiac ion channelopathies characterized by a prolonged electrocardiogram QT interval and increased risk of sudden cardiac death. Beta-adrenergic blockers are the mainstay of treatment for LQTS. While their efficacy has been demonstrated in LQTS patients harbouring potassium channel mutations, studies of beta-blockers in subtype 3 (LQT3), which is caused by sodium channel mutations, have produced ambiguous results. In this modelling study, we explore the effects of beta-adrenergic drugs on the LQT3 phenotype.", 
    "66": "In order to investigate the effects of beta-adrenergic activity and to identify sources of ambiguity in earlier studies, we developed a computational model incorporating the effects of beta-agonists and beta-blockers into an LQT3 mutant guinea pig ventricular myocyte model. Beta-activation suppressed two arrhythmogenic phenomena, transmural dispersion of repolarization and early after depolarizations, in a dose-dependent manner. However, the ability of beta-activation to prevent cardiac conduction block was pacing-rate-dependent. Low-dose beta-blockade by propranolol reversed the beneficial effects of beta-activation, while high dose (which has off-target sodium channel effects) decreased arrhythmia susceptibility.", 
    "67": "These results demonstrate that beta-activation may be protective in LQT3 and help to reconcile seemingly conflicting results from different experimental models. They also highlight the need for well-controlled clinical investigations re-evaluating the use of beta-blockers in LQT3 patients.", 
    "68": "Hypertension has become a large burden of global development, but the mechanisms of it have still not been well elucidated. Increased contractility of vascular smooth cells induced by the overactivity of neurohormonal system or stress is one of the main and popular explanations until now. Smoothelin-B, recognized as the actin-binding protein, is only expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells and takes part in the contraction process of vascular smooth cells. Rensen et al. demonstrated that deficiency of smoothelin-B resulted in reduced contractile capacity of vascular smooth muscle and hypertension in mice, which provides us a novel fact in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Therefore, we proposed that reduced contractile capacity of vascular smooth muscle could result in hypertension, the mechanism of which might be related to normal cardiac output but blood retention induced by reduced vasoconstriction, impaired vasodilatation and decreased blood vessels. Studies are needed to demonstrate our hypotheses and further investigation and discussion should be focused on the treatment in these patients because beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker may be not suitable for them.", 
    "69": "We report the case of a 56 years old male patient, smoker, obese, with untreated arterial hypertension, hospitalized on 16.02.07 with the diagnosis of inferior acute myocardial infarction, for which he received thrombolysis with streptokinase, followed by anticoagulation with non fractioned heparin. Two days later he started to complain of acute abdominal pain, and laboratory findings showed a low hemoglobin level. Imaging findings (ultrasonography and CT scan) showed evidence of subcapsular liver haematoma, caused by bleeding at hepatic and splenic level. He received red blood packed cells, fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, activated factor VII and was transferred by helicopter to Fundeni Clinical Institute--Intensive care unit (ICU). On admission, the patient was conscious, anxious, dyspneic, with mild hypoxia, with no signs of low cardiac output and with a painful abdomen. ECG, echocardiography and elevated myocardial necrosis enzymes confirmed myocardial infarction. Shortly after admission there was a worsening of his clinical condition, with a decrease in hemoglobin level despite red blood packed cells administration (Hb=7.8 g/dl) and thrombocytopenia (82000/mmc), with normal coagulation tests, thus suggesting active intraabdominal bleeding. Echography and CT scan confirmed bleeding. Emergency surgery was performed, showing massive haemoperitoneum (approx 4.5 L of blood), due to spontaneous rupture of a subcapsular hematoma in the liver. The surgical hemostasis was performed on the liver parenchyma laceration. Duration of surgery was 4 hours. There were no significant cardiac events during surgery (no signs of ischemia on ECG, no ST elevation), despite the need for inotropic agent. After surgery, the patient was referred to the ICU, intubated and ventilated, with inotropic support - dobutamine. Sequential ECG's, enzymatic trend and echocardiographies were performed to monitor myocardial ischemia. The outcome was favourable, no further bleeding and no postoperative myocardial infarction occurred. Secondary prevention was started early (thromboprophylaxis, selective beta-blocker, angiotensin inhibitors and statins). The patient had a favorable outcome and was discharged from the ICU the fourth day after surgery. He had a total length of stay in hospital of seven days, with a follow-up in the cardiology department.",

TCAs increase the extracellular concentrations of noradrenaline and serotonin by blocking the reuptake transporters of these amines. However, the precise downstream mechanism leading to the therapeutic action remains identified. In this work, we evaluated the role of adrenergic receptors (ARs) in the action of TCAs.", 
    "71": "We used pharmacological and genetic approaches in mice to study the role of ARs in the antiallodynic action of the TCA nortriptyline. Peripheral neuropathy was induced by the insertion of a polyethylene cuff around the main branch of the sciatic nerve. The specific role of beta(2)-AR was evaluated by studying beta(2)-AR(-/-) mice. We used von Frey filaments to assess mechanical allodynia.", 
    "72": "The antiallodynic action of nortriptyline was not affected by cotreatment with the alpha(2)-AR antagonist yohimbine, the beta(1)-AR antagonists atenolol or metoprolol, or the beta(3)-AR antagonist SR 59230A. On the contrary, the beta-AR antagonists propranolol or sotalol, the beta(1)/beta(2)-AR antagonists alprenolol or pindolol, or the specific beta(2)-AR antagonist ICI 118,551 blocked the action of nortriptyline. The effect of nortriptyline was also totally absent in beta(2)-AR-deficient mice.",

The NaCl fraction was extracted with water and after drying porous pellets were obtained (33.2% porosity). Immersion of the porous pellets in a 15% and 30% (w/v) metoprolol tartrate solution, ibuprofen impregnation via supercritical fluids and paracetamol layering via fluidized bed coating were evaluated as drug loading techniques.", 
    "77": "Raman spectroscopy revealed that immersion of the pellets in a drug solution and supercritical fluid impregnation allowed the drug to penetrate into the porous structure of the pellets. The amount of drug incorporated depended on the solubility of the drug in the solvent (water or supercritical CO(2)). Drug release from the porous pellets was immediate and primarily controlled by pure diffusion.", 
    "78": "The technique described in this research work is suitable for the production of porous pellets. Drug loading via immersion the pellets in a drug solution and supercritical fluid impregnation resulted in a drug deposition in the entire pellet in contrast to fluid bed layering where drugs were only deposed on the pellet surface.",

The complex in solid state was prepared by the freeze-drying method and characterized by differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The drug, free or in complex form, was incorporated into polymeric films prepared by the casting method using ethylcellulose (EC), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC). The prepared film formulations were characterized in terms of swelling, bioadhesion, and in vitro drug release.", 
    "82": "The formation of a stabile inclusion complex (K(s) = 783.4 +/- 21.6 M(-1)) in 1:1 molar stoichiometry was confirmed in solution and in solid state. The swelling properties of films were predominated by the type of polymer used in the formulation. In vitro bioadhesive properties of the films were well correlated with the swelling properties of the polymers used in the formulation. Although incorporation of the drug, free or in complex form, decreased the bioadhesion of the films, PVA- and HPMC-based formulations retained suitable bioadhesive properties. Higher atenolol solubility upon complexation with RAMEB increased the drug dissolution rate under conditions designed to be similar to those on the buccal mucosa, but it has decreased the drug release rate from the PVA and HPMC film formulation, leading to a sustained drug release pattern. In the case of EC-based films, RAMEB promoted drug release. Other parameters that influenced the drug release rate were associated with the structure of the polymer used in the formulation, swelling characteristics of the films, and the interaction between atenolol and hydrophilic polymers that was demonstrated by FTIR analysis.",

    "84": "The beneficial effect achieved by the treatment of endothelial dysfunction in chronic cardiovascular diseases is already an evidence belonging to the basic treatment of the disease. Given the fact that the vascular system is uniform and consubstantial both physiologically, pathophysiologically and in terms of therapy, and that it plays a key role in age-related macular degeneration (AMD)--a disease leading to tragic loss of vision with its etiology and therapy being unknown--endothelial dysfunction should be treated. The pleiotropic effects of ACE-inhibitors, AR-blockers and statins and third generation beta blockers help to restitute the balance between vasodilators and vasoconstrictors in endothelial dysfunction caused by oxidative stress, the balance of growth factors and their inhibitors, pro- and anti-inflammatory substances and prothrombotic and fibrinolytic factors, inhibit the formation of oxidative stress and its harmful effects; while aspirin with its pleiotropic effects acting as an antiaggregation substance on platelets helps to set the endothelial layer back to its normal balance regarding its vasodilating, antithrombotic, antiadhesive and anti-inflammatory functions; trimetazidine as an adjuvant agent helps to normalize, to restore the disturbed metabolism of the retinal tissue functioning insufficiently, in the end. The angiotensin II receptor blocker telmisartan with its peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonist effect inhibits the development of choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) and improves it clinically favourably. The third generation beta adrenergic receptor blocker carvedilol and nebivolol as well as the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonist pioglitazone elicit their antioxidant vascular protective effects mitochondrially. For the above reasons it is suggested that, as a part of long term primary and/or secondary prevention, the following groups of patients with AMD receive--taking into consideration all possible side effects--ACE-inhibitor and/or AR blocker and statin and aspirin treatment, and trimetazidine as adjuvant medicine, and third generation beta adrenergic receptor blockers: 1. those without macular degeneration but being above the age of 50 and having risk factors inducing endothelial dysfunction; 2. those, who already developed AMD in one eye as a prevention in the second, unaffected eye; and 3. those patients who developed AMD in both eyes in order to ameliorate or merely slow the progression of the disease. Besides, it is advisory and important to eliminate AMD risk factors (cardiovascular risk factors also) inducing oxidative stress with consecutive endothelial dysfunction.", 
    "85": "The present work aimed to investigate the effect of different concentrations of poloxamer 188, a surfactant, on lymphatic uptake of carvedilol-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) for oral bioavailability enhancement. Microemulsion technique was employed to prepare the SLN formulations having varying concentrations of poloxamer 188, which were subsequently subjected to various in vitro and in vivo evaluations to study their release pattern. On increasing the percentage concentration of poloxamer 188, the bioavailability decreased from 4.91- to 2.84-fold after intraduodenal administration in the male Wister rat. It could be attributed to the increase in particle size as well as reduction in hydrophobicity of SLNs. As indicated by pharmacokinetic data, the AUC(0-t) of all three (SLN) formulations (6.27 +/- 0.24 microgh/mL with FZ-1, 4.13 +/- 0.11 microgh/mL with FZ-2, and 3.63 +/- 0.10 microgh/mL with FZ-3) were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that of carvedilol suspension (1.27 +/- 0.23 microgh/mL).

    "90": "Nitric oxide is widely established as an important neurotransmitter in the control of anal sphincter tone; although, a number of other transmitters have also been tentatively implicated. Whilst alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists reduce anal sphincter pressure in man, the role of noradrenaline as a possible transmitter is poorly characterised. We have investigated the contribution of these transmitters to neurogenic relaxations, and evaluated the possible role of a non-nitrergic, non-adrenergic transmitter. The magnitude and duration of neurogenic responses were examined by measuring responses to electrical field stimulation (EFS) in segments of sheep internal anal sphincter following the development of spontaneous myogenic tone. Neurogenic relaxations induced by EFS were significantly reduced in the presence of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) suggesting major involvement of nitric oxide as a neurotransmitter. The duration of neurogenic relaxations was inversely related to the frequency of EFS, with contractile responses often manifest at higher frequencies. The duration of relaxations at high frequencies of EFS was increased by bretylium (adrenergic neurone blocker) and prazosin (alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist). At higher frequencies of EFS, 60% of preparations also produced a residual non-nitrergic, non-adrenergic, apamin-sensitive relaxation which was unaffected by vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and inhibitors of purinergic responses [suramin, pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl 2',4' disulfonic acid (PPADS) and alpha,beta-methylene adenosine triphosphate (ATP)]. However, MRS2179 (P2Y(1) receptor antagonist) showed a modest inhibitory effect. We conclude that endogenous noradrenaline acts via postjunctional alpha(1)-adrenoceptors to antagonize neurogenic relaxations that are largely mediated by nitric oxide. Our results indicate the involvement of a non-nitrergic, non-adrenergic, apamin-sensitive transmitter which is inhibited by MRS2179, suggesting a possible role for purines.",

Twenty patients received sotalol, 19--retard form of verapamil. After 3 months of hypotensive therapy in all patients and separately in groups of patients receiving sotalol and verapamil no significant changes of MMP-1 and TIMP-1 occurred. However in patients with most pronounced hypotensive effect according to 24-hour blood pressure monitoring significant elevation of MMP-1 and lowering of TIMP-1 levels took place. This was associated with improvement of ventricular diastolic function.

At week 12, the change from baseline ranged from -6.22 to -6.79 mmHg in the tafluprost group. Patients switched from vehicle to tafluprost achieved a similar decrease in IOP to those who received tafluprost throughout the study (group difference at 12 weeks, -0.09 mmHg, p=0.812).

We performed a comprehensive literature search regarding treatment for VM or migraine-associated vertigo during the period of 1990-2008 and used, individually or in combination, the search terms VM, migraine-associated vertigo, migraine-associated dizziness, migrainous vertigo, migraine and vertigo, migraine and disequilibrium, and headache and vertigo. We found nine publications that address treatment strategies for VM. One small randomized clinical trial found some benefit from the use of zolmitriptan for abortive treatment of VM. The other eight observational studies showed marginal improvement with migraine prophylactic medications such as nortriptyline, verapamil, or metoprolol. Until more specific treatment options become available, patients with VM need to be managed with similar prophylactic and abortive strategies as those used for migraine in adults.",

The aim of the present study was to identify the enzyme responsible for the stereoselective metabolism of carvedilol in the cells. The expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNA, but not CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP2C9 mRNA, was increased in beta-NF-treated Caco-2 cells, as compared with non-treated cells. Furafylline, an inhibitor of the CYP1A subfamily, decreased the metabolism of S-carvedilol in Caco-2 cells cultured on plastic dishes. In addition, the glucuronidation of carvedilol was not significant in microsomes of beta-NF-treated Caco-2 cells. On the other hand, the oxidation of S-carvedilol in microsomes of beta-NF-treated Caco-2 cells was faster than that of R-carvedilol, and furafylline decreased the oxidative activity of S-carvedilol. These findings suggested that the CYP1A subfamily was responsible for the stereoselective metabolism of carvedilol in beta-NF-treated Caco-2 cells.",

The most common cause of ventricular fibrillation is acute coronary ischemia, whereas a myocardial scar from prior infarct is the most common cause of sustained monomorphic VT in patients with structural heart disease. More benign forms of idiopathic VT can also occur in the absence of structural heart disease. Treatment of VT involves both emergent management and prevention of recurrence with medical and device therapy. Appropriately selected patients who have experienced VT or those who are at risk of VT may be candidates for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. The left ventricular ejection fraction is most frequently used to stratify patients with either ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy who are at risk of sudden death and may be candidates for a prophylactic defibrillator. Catheter ablation may also be an option for appropriately selected patients with many forms of VT. This article discusses the etiologies and management of VT and its association with sudden death.",

This surprising finding raised a question concerning the role of FBPase in this compartment of the cell, and of the extracellular signals regulating nuclear transport of the enzyme. In the present paper we show that, in HL-1 cardiomyocyte cell line, the activity of adenylyl cyclase and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A is essential to nuclear import of FBPase. The import is also stimulated by isoproterenol (a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptors agonist) and inhibited by metoprolol (a selective beta1 antagonist), strongly suggesting that nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of FBPase is under the control of beta1-adrenergic receptor-dependent Gs protein signaling cascade.",

In adjusted logistic regression analyses, medical insurance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and administration of invasive therapy (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft) were important in determining use of treatment at discharge and during follow-up.

Current antihypertensive therapy is discontinued, and hypertension is confirmed, along with collection of other baseline data. Subjects are then randomized to either hydrochlorothiazide or atenolol, with 1 dose titration step, followed by assessment of response to therapy after at least 6 weeks on the target dose.

Immediately thereafter, the liver and gastrocnemius muscle were surgically removed and used for the assay of glycogen. The role of adrenoceptors in PL-induced glycogenolysis was examined by parallel experiments in which idazoxan (IDX, 1 mg/kg), propranolol (PRO, 2 mg/kg) or metoprolol (MET, 2 mg/kg) were administered alongside MEL.

A co-treatment with MEL and an adrenoceptor blocker had a greater attenuating effect on PL-induced glycogenolysis and hyperglycemia than MEL but without impinging on the CAT levels seen with MEL alone. Evidence of maximal inhibitory action by MEL on PL-induced plasma CAT elevation was suggested by the about equal levels of plasma CATs after treatments with MEL and with MEL plus TAU.",

    "128": "The behaviour of a reversed-phase liquid chromatographic (RPLC) system (i.e. elution order, resolution and analysis time), used in the analysis of beta-blockers with acetonitrile-water mobile phases, changes drastically upon addition of an anionic surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulphate, SDS). Surfactant monomers cover the alkyl-bonded phase in different extent depending on the concentration of both modifiers, in the ranges 1 x 10(-3)-0.15M SDS and 5-50% acetonitrile. Meanwhile, the surfactant is dissolved in the mobile phase as free monomers, associated in small clusters or forming micelles. Four characteristic RPLC modes are yielded, with transition regions between them: hydro-organic, micellar, and low and high submicellar. The mobile phases in the two latter modes contain a concentration of SDS below or well above the critical micellar concentration (CMC) in water (i.e. 8 x 10(-3)M), and more than 30% acetonitrile. High submicellar RPLC appeared as the most promising mode, as it allowed full resolution of the beta-blockers in practical times, while these were unresolved or highly retained in the other RPLC modes. The strong attraction of the cationic solutes to the anionic SDS makes a direct transfer mechanism between surfactant molecules in the stationary and mobile phases likely.", 
    "129": "The degree of binding of a drug to plasma proteins has a marked effect on its distribution, elimination, and pharmacological effect since only the unbound fraction is available for distribution into extra-vascular space. The protein-binding of atenolol was measured by equilibrium dialysis in the bovine serum albumin (BSA). Free atenolol concentration was increased due to addition of arsenic which reduced the binding of the compounds to BSA. During concurrent administration, arsenic displaced atenolol from its high-affinity binding Site I, and free concentration of atenolol increased from 4.286 +/- 0.629% and 5.953 +/- 0.605% to 82.153 +/- 1.924% and 85.486 +/- 1.158% in absence and presence of Site I probe respectively. Thus, it can be suggested that arsenic displaced atenolol from its binding site resulting in an increase of the free atenolol concentration in plasma.",

Imipramine precipitates the occurrence of arrhythmias, whereas propranolol shows protection against them.", 
    "131": "The study was conducted to examine effects of a selective copper(I) chelator, neocuproine on the spontaneous or oxytocin-induced contractions in isolated ovariectomized non-pregnant rat, pregnant rat and pregnant human uterus. Uterus activity was evaluated in tissues obtained from bilaterally ovariectomized non-pregnant rats on the 21st day of the operation (n = 24), pregnant rats on the 19-21st day of gestation (n = 24) and women undergoing caesarean section at 38-42 weeks of pregnancy (n = 15). Neocuproine (100 microM) significantly suppressed the amplitude and frequency of the spontaneous contractions in the ovariectomized non-pregnant rat uterus while this agent facilitated the frequency of the spontaneous or oxytocin-induced contractions in the pregnant rat and human uterus without altering the amplitude of these contractions. At high concentration of 200 microM, neocuproine could enhance the amplitude of the contractions in the pregnant uterus. These effects were blocked by a purinergic receptor antagonist, suramin (100 microM) and did not occur following the administration of neocuproine-copper(I) complex or copper(II) chelator cuprizone. alpha, beta-methylene ATP increased the amplitude and frequency of contractions in the pregnant uterus, but not affected the contractions in the ovariectomized non-pregnant rat uterus, and neocuproine potentiated this facilitation effect. However, the suppressive effect of neocuproine on the ovariectomized non-pregnant rat uterus increased in the presence of alpha,beta-methylene ATP. Beta-adrenoceptor blocker, propranolol or nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, L-nitroarginine did not affect the responses to neocuproine. These findings suggest that neocuproine can affect the uterus contractile activity by modulation purinergic excitatory responses and that copper(I)-sensitive mechanisms may play a role in this effect.",

In PNT-treated eyes the mean IOP decrease was 4.5 +/- 1.8 mmHg (19.1 +/- 7.8%) and in latanoprost-treated eyes was 6.6 +/- 1.3 mmHg (28.2 +/- 5.7%) (between two groups, P < 0.001). Eleven PNT-treated eyes (61%) and 17 latanoprost-treated eyes (94%) had an IOP reduction of more than 20% of baseline value (P = 0.049); two PNT-treated patients received additional therapy. At the following months, in the latanoprost group, IOP was stable: an IOP reduction of 20% or more was seen in 89% of the eyes. In some PNT-treated eyes IOP increased: at 2 months, an IOP reduction> or =20% was seen in 50%, at 3 months in 33%, and at 4 months in 17% of the eyes. (between the two groups, respectively, P = 0.03, P = 0.002, P < 0.001). The number of eyes that required therapy increased progressively in the PNT group, and at 8 months all eyes had required therapy, whereas one latanoprost-treated eye had had additional therapy. After PNT, no patients had visual acuity reduction or intraocular inflammation; three eyes had subconjunctival hemorrhage and five eyes a hyperemia that regressed within 1 week.

    "137": "We tested the hypothesis that wt-CFTR down-regulates NFkappaB mediated IL-8 secretion. We transiently co-expressed wt-CFTR and IL-8 or NFkappaB promoters driving luciferase expression in HEK293 cells. Wt-CFTR expression in HEK293 cells suppresses both basal and IL1beta induced IL-8, and NFkappaB promoter activities as compared to the control cells transfected with empty vector (p<0.05). We also confirmed these results using CFBE41o- cells and observed that cells stably transduced with wt-CFTR secrete significantly lower amounts of IL-8 chemokine as compared to non-transfected control cells. To test the hypothesis that CFTR must be localized to cell surface lipid rafts in polarized airway epithelial cells in order to mediate the inflammatory response, we treated CFBE41o- cells that had been stably transduced with wt-CFTR with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (CD). At baseline, CD significantly (p<0.05) induced IL-8 and NFkappaB reporter activities as compared to control cells suggesting a negative regulation of NFkappaB mediated IL-8 signaling by CFTR in cholesterol-rich lipid rafts. Untreated cells exposed to the CFTR channel blocker CFTR-172 inhibitor developed a similar increase in IL-8 and NFkappaB reporter activities suggesting that not only must CFTR be present on the cell surface but it must be functional. We verified these results in vivo by comparing survival, body weight and pro-inflammatory cytokine response to P. aeruginosa LPS in CFTR knock out (CFKO) mice as compared to wild type controls. There was a significant (p<0.05) decrease in survival and body weight, an elevation in IL-1beta in whole lung extract (p<0.01), as well as a significant increase in phosphorylated IkappaB, an inducer of NFkappaB mediated signaling in the CFKO mice.",

These results suggests that long term therapy with a fixed-dose combination of perindopril/indapamide affords vascular protection in hypertensive patients.", 
    "143": "Emerging evidence indicates that impaired mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation plays a key role in liver steatosis. We have recently demonstrated that increased angiotensin (ANG) II causes progressive hepatic steatosis associated with oxidative stress; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that ANG II causes hepatic mitochondrial oxidative damage and impairs mitochondrial beta-oxidation, thereby leading to hepatic steatosis. We used the Ren2 rat with elevated endogenous ANG II levels to evaluate mitochondrial ultrastructural changes, gene expression levels, and beta-oxidation. Compared with Sprague-Dawley littermates, Ren2 livers exhibited mitochondrial damage and reduced beta-oxidation, as evidenced by ultrastructural abnormalities, decrease of mitochondrial content, percentage of palmitate oxidation to CO(2), enzymatic activities (beta-HAD and citrate synthase), and the expression levels of cytochrome c, cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1, and mitochondrial transcription factor A. These abnormalities were improved with either ANG II receptor blocker valsartan or superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetic tempol treatment. Both valsartan and tempol substantially attenuated mitochondrial lipid peroxidation in Ren2 livers. Interestingly, there was no difference in the expression of key enzymes (ACC1 and FAS) for fatty acid syntheses and their transcription factors (SREBP-1c and ChREBP) between Sprague-Dawley, untreated Ren2, and valsartan- or tempol-treated Ren2 rats. These results document that ANG II induces mitochondrial oxidative damage and impairs mitochondrial beta-oxidation, contributing to liver steatosis.",

Despite this, propranolol had no effect on the acquisition or retention of extinction. Unlike propranolol, sotalol did not affect fear expression, although both drugs significantly reduced heart rate. This suggests that propranolol acts centrally to reduce fear. Consistent with this, propranolol reduced the firing rate of PL neurons.",

The major cause for poor image quality was dense calcification precluding the luminal assessment (60.42%). Comparing the maximal percentage diameter stenosis by 64-slice CT versus invasive angiogram, the Spearman correlation coefficient between the two modalities was 0.788 and p value was <0.001.

Timolol monotherapy and timolol add-on treatment to a prostaglandin analog does not lower IOP during the nocturnal period. Laser trabeculoplasty can reduce nocturnal IOP elevation in medically treated glaucoma patients, even in those without significant reduction of diurnal IOP. Though both IOP and central corneal thickness display a 24 h rhythm with peaks during the nocturnal period, there is no correlation between central corneal thickness and 24 h IOP variation in normals and glaucoma patients. Corneal biomechanical properties (corneal hysteresis and corneal resistance factor) remain relatively stable during the 24 h period and are not associated with 24 h IOP fluctuation.",

    "162": "The effects of salbutamol on contractility and cAMP levels were investigated in rat right ventricular myocardium. Salbutamol (1-300 microM), produced a concentration-dependent positive inotropic effect which was not affected by ICI 118551 (50 nM), a beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist but was abolished by CGP 20712A (1 microM) a beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist. However, in rats pretreated with pertussis toxin (30 microg/kg intraperitoneal injection) salbutamol increases contractility (Emax = 9.8 +/- 1.8%, - log EC50 = 6.25 +/- 0.07, n = 5). The combination of salbutamol + CGP 20712A, also produces a concentration-dependent enhancement of contractility (Emax = 43.0 +/- 7.5%, - log EC50 = 6.3 +/- 0.04, n = 6), in the presence of 30 microM of the non selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor 3-isobutylmethylxantine (IBMX) which was prevented by ICI 118551 (50 nM). Also, salbutamol + CGP 20712A fail to increase cAMP tissue levels but enhance them in the presence of IBMX. This effect was also prevented by ICI 118551. These results indicate that PDEs blunt contractility and cAMP production mediated by beta2-adrenoceptors in rat ventricular myocardium. Gi protein, although less efficiently than PDEs, also limits inotropic effects of salbutamol mediated by beta2-adrenoceptors in this tissue.",

To this end, mice were treated with PL (200 mg/kg) and isoproterenol (ISO 200 mg/kg), with and without a pretreatment with TAU (300 mg/kg), LAB (30 mg/kg), or TAU plus LAB, and monitored for heart rate, electrocardiographic (ECG) and myocardial electrolyte changes. PL plus ISO lowered the LD50 of ISO and magnified the changes in heart rate, ECG and myocardial electrolytes seen with ISO alone. Pretreating rats with TAU or TAU plus LAB attenuated the cardiovascular changes induced by PL plus ISO to a greater extent than LAB alone. The attenuating actions of TAU and LAB probably reflect independent and complementary mechanisms of action.",

Systems composed of HCO-40, Transcutol HP, and medium-chain triglyceride were prepared. Essential properties of the prepared systems regarding carvedilol solubility, a model drug, and self-emulsification time were determined. In order to optimize self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDS), formulation dispersion-drug precipitation test was performed in the absence and presence of cellulosic polymers. Furthermore, SNEDDS was loaded onto liquisolid powders. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) activity of the selected SNEDDS was tested using HCT-116 cells. Carvedilol showed acceptable solubility in the selected excipients. It also demonstrated improvement in the stability upon dilution with aqueous media in the presence of cellulosic polymers. Use of granulated silicon dioxide improved the physical properties of liquisolid powders containing SNEDDS. It improved the compressibility of the selected powders and the tested SNEDDS showed marked P-gp inhibition activity. Prepared self-nanoemulsifying tablet produced acceptable properties of immediate-release dosage forms and expected to increase the bioavailability of carvedilol.",

Transdermal flux of carvedilol through heat-separated rat epidermis was investigated in vitro using vertical Keshary-Chien diffusion cells. Biophysical and microscopic manifestations of epidermis treated with AR extract, CTN, and AR extract-CTN mixture were investigated by using differential scanning calorimetry, transepidermal water loss, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Biochemical estimations of cholesterol, sphingosine, and triglycerides were carried out for treated excised as well as viable rat epidermis. The antihypertensive activity of the patches in comparison with that of oral carvedilol was studied in deoxycorticosterone acetate-induced hypertensive rats. The permeation of carvedilol across excised rat epidermis was significantly higher (p < 0.05) when AR extract, CTN, or AR extract-CTN mixture was used as donor vehicle as compared to propylene glycol/ethanol (7:3) mixture. Epidermis obtained after 12 h treatment of viable rat skin with AR extract-CTN mixture showed significantly higher (p < 0.05) permeability to CDL as compared to that after treatment with AR extract or CTN alone. Further, the application of patches containing AR extract-CTN mixture resulted in sustained release of CDL which was able to control the hypertension in deoxycorticosterone acetate-induced hypertensive rats through 36 h. Estimation of micro constituents in rat epidermis revealed maximum extraction of cholesterol, sphingosine, and triglycerides after treatment with AR extract-CTN mixture. This was manifested in altered lipid and protein-specific thermotropic transitions. Further, increase in intercellular space, disordered lipid structure, and corneocyte detachment as observed in SEM and TEM suggested great potential of AR extract for use as percutaneous permeation enhancer. The developed transdermal patches of CDL containing AR extract-CTN mixture exhibited better performance as compared to oral administration in controlling hypertension in rats.",

Each drug was applied at stepwise-increased concentrations every 2 min. The voltage dependence of the steady-state inactivation of the TTX-r Na current was investigated by using a conventional double-pulse protocol. To test for use-dependent blockade of TTX-r Na channels by beta-blockers, trains of depolarizing pulses (to -10 from a holding potential of -70 mV) were applied at one of three frequencies (0.2, 5 or 20 Hz) in the absence or presence of drug (landiolol 8 mmol l, esmolol 140 micromol l).",

Blood pressure goals below those for the non-diabetic subject have been shown to be more effective in lowering mortality and cardiovascular events in the diabetic patient. To achieve these goals in most cases, three to five antihypertensives from different therapeutic groups need to be utilized. Suppression of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin 2 receptor blockers or a renin inhibitor should be the primary therapy. A second goal should be suppression of the sympathetic nervous system utilizing a beta-blocker that does not increase insulin resistance. The addition of a diuretic, calcium channel blocker or a vasodilator to suppressors of the RAS and sympathetic nervous system aid in achieving hypertensive goals in the diabetic patient. Achieving hypertensive goals with suppression of the RAS and sympathetic nervous system should result in a decrease in mortality and cardiovascular events in the diabetic hypertensive patient. In this review article, the benefits and disadvantages of the different antihypertensive therapies in the diabetic patient are discussed.",

Knowledge about the behavior of complex cardiac dynamics indices after different cardiac procedures is very limited, however. We aimed to clarify how nonlinear heart rate dynamics are affected by beating-heart revascularization (off-pump coronary artery bypass graft [CABG] surgery) within the first week after the procedure.",

The patients were on chronic beta-blocker therapy and were scheduled for off-pump CABG. We performed 15-minute high-resolution electrocardiographic recordings preoperatively and on the third and seventh postoperative days to assess linear and nonlinear heart rate dynamics. Frequency-domain measurements, detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) with short-term (<or=11 beats, alpha1) and long-term (>11 beats, alpha2) correlation properties of RR-intervals, and fractal dimension (FD) measurements (average, high, and low) were made. Arrhythmia was monitored preoperatively with 24-hour Holter recordings, postoperatively by continuous monitoring for the first 4 days after the procedure, and subsequently by clinical monitoring; 24-hour Holter recordings were obtained again on the seventh postoperative day. We used the paired-samples Student t test, the Mann-Whitney U test, and the Fisher exact test for statistical analyses. Differences in arrhythmia occurrence before and after the procedure were tested with the Wilcoxon signed rank test and the McNemar test. A P level < .05 was considered statistically significant.",

Values for the alpha1 and high FD parameters decreased significantly after the procedure (P= .028 and .001, respectively), whereas alpha2 increased significantly (P= .023). DFA alpha1 was significantly lower in patients with postoperative atrial fibrillation than in patients remaining in sinus rhythm (mean +/- SD, 0.79+/-0.32 versus 1.13+/-0.45 [P= .003] on the third postoperative day; 0.89+/-0.31 versus 1.22+/-0.34 [P< .001] on the seventh postoperative day), whereas low and average FDs were significantly higher (1.84+/-0.16 versus 1.68+/-0.19 [P= .003] on the third postoperative day and 1.77+/-0.18 versus 1.66+/-0.17 [P= .01] on the seventh postoperative day for the low FD; 1.83+/-0.09 versus 1.76+/-0.10 [P= .011] on the third postoperative day and 1.80+/-0.11 versus 1.73+/-0.10 [P= .014] on the seventh postoperative day for the average FD).

    "187": "The decreases in alpha1, average FD, and high FD indicate that a profound decay of cardiac complexity and fractal correlation can be observed after off-pump CABG. Furthermore, a more extensive impairment of nonlinear indices was observed in patients who developed postoperative arrhythmias than in those who remained in stable sinus rhythm. Our findings suggest that the postoperative hyperadrenergic setting acts as a preliminary condition in which both reduced and enhanced vagal activity may predispose patients to arrhythmia, indicating that postoperative rhythm disturbances are an end point associated with divergent autonomic substrates.", 
    "188": "We describe the use of Raman spectroscopy to detect and quantify, for the first time, the presence of the imprinting template in single molecularly imprinted polymer microspheres. The polymers were imprinted with the beta-blocking drugs propranolol and atenolol, and precipitation polymerization was used to obtain spherical particles of diameters of 200 nm and 1.5microm. The size of the Raman laser spot being between 1microm and a few mum, the nanoparticles were used for bulk detection whereas with micrometer-sized particles, quantitative measurements on single particles were possible. The laser power, and consequently the acquisition times, needed to be adapted as a function of the polymer and template used in order to avoid burning. Analyte quantification from Raman spectra is straightforward by determining the peak height of a typical Raman band of the analyte, and by using a typical polymer peak for normalization. Relatively low detection limits down to 1microM have been reached for the detection of S-propranolol through bulk measurements on MIP nanoparticles.",

Management of obese patients with high blood pressure includes weight loss efforts, but antihypertensive treatment is most often necessary. Beta-blockers, alone or with thiazide diuretics, increase the risk of diabetes in hypertensive patients. Treatment against hypertension must include a renin-angiotensin system blocker, with a calcium channel blocker or a thiazide diuretic, if necessary.", 
    "190": "We have previously shown that metoprolol decreases carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) activity, a mechanism which may partly explain its beneficial effects in heart failure. It is possible that this effect occurs as a result of repression of cardiac CPT-1B expression. CPT-1B is induced by the transcription factors peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) and PPAR-gamma-coactivator 1alpha (PGC1alpha) and repressed by upstream stimulatory factor-2 (USF-2). We therefore hypothesized that metoprolol represses CPT-1B by increasing USF-2-mediated repression of PGC1alpha. Male Wistar Rats were divided into 4 groups: control, control treated with metoprolol for 5 weeks, diabetic and diabetic treated with metoprolol for 5 weeks. After termination, the expression of CPT-1 isoforms, PPAR-alpha, PGC1alpha USF-1 and USF-2, as well as downstream targets were measured. Binding of PPAR-alpha, PGC1alpha and USF-2 to PGC1alpha was measured using coimmunoprecipitation. The occupation of PPAR-alpha and MEF-2A consensus sites in the CPT-1B promoter was measured using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Chronic metoprolol treatment decreased the expression of CPT-1B in diabetic hearts. The expression of USF-2 was increased by metoprolol in both control and diabetic hearts, but the association of USF-2 with PGC1alpha was increased by metoprolol only in diabetic hearts. Metoprolol prevented the increase in PGC1alpha occupation of the CPT-1B promoter region observed in the diabetic heart without affecting PPAR-alpha occupation. Metoprolol decreases CPT-1B expression by decreasing PGC1alpha-mediated coactivation of PPAR-alpha and MEF-2A. This is associated with increased PGC1alpha/ USF-2 binding, suggesting that USF-2 mediates the metoprolol-induced repression of PGC1alpha.",
