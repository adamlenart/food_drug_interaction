Sham feeding was performed without pretreatment (control) and after pretreatment with 400 mg cimetidine, 80 mg propranolol (both given orally) or 1 mg atropine administered subcutaneously 60 min prior to sham feeding. MSF induced a significant increase (about 100%) in PP release. Its early peak was reduced by pretreatment with propranolol whereas cimetidine had no effect. Atropine completely abolished the PP response. Gastrin release was stimulated by MSF only after prior administration of cimetidine and, to a lesser extent, after atropine pretreatment. It is concluded that: (1) the PP release after stimulation is under strong cholinergic control but is also mediated--particularly in the early phase--by adrenergic mechanisms; (2) endogenously released acid during vagal stimulation plays a minor role in the modulation of PP secretion, but (3) masks gastrin response to MSF.", 
    "1": "Protein binding of chlorpromazine, propranolol, meperidine, desipramine, salicylic acid and phenytoin was determined in plasma of 64 healthy volunteers (35 males and 29 females). An attempt was made to identify factors affecting the plasma protein binding of these drugs. Whereas plasma albumin levels decreased as a function of age in both sexes, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein levels increased with age, but the increase was more pronounced in males. The free plasma fraction of the acidic drugs (salicylic acid, phenytoin) and desipramine (a base) showed a significant (p less than 0.005) negative correlation with plasma albumin levels. The free fractions of the other three basic drugs (chlorpromazine, propranolol, meperidine) in plasma showed a significant (p less than 0.005) negative correlation with alpha 1-acid glycoprotein plasma levels. Plasma protein binding of salicylic acid, phenytoin and desipramine decreased as a function of age. Plasma protein binding of chlorpromazine, propranolol and meperidine was virtually unaffected by age or was slightly increased (chlorpromazine). Only in the case of salicylic acid could a statistically significant difference be demonstrated between males and females in the free fraction-age relationship. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis, including age and blood chemistry values such as hematocrit, bilirubin, cholesterol, triglycerides, creatinine, BUN, albumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein as independent variables, identified age as the variable explaining most of the variability in plasma binding of salicylic acid, phenytoin and desipramine. For chlorpromazine, propranolol and meperidine alpha 1-acid glycoprotein was the most important determinant of plasma protein binding.", 
    "2": "The effect of adrenaline on myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) during selective and non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blockade was examined in 26 patients with angina pectoris. Cardiac venous flow was measured by thermodilution and blood was sampled for metabolic studies. Thirteen patients were given atenolol 62.5 micrograms/kg i.v. and the other 13 patients pindolol 7.5 micrograms/kg i.v. Measurements were repeated before and during infusion of adrenaline 0.1 microgram/kg/min. Compared to the control situation, adrenaline increased MVO2 more in atenolol-treated (39%) than in pindolol-treated patients (11%). This was partly due to augmented external cardiac work. Arterial FFA was considerably increased in the atenolol group (105%), but was unchanged in the pindolol group, suggesting an additional metabolic mechanism. Thus, adrenaline stimulation, which is comparable to that found in acute myocardial infarction, increases MVO2 more during selective than non-selective beta-blockade.", 
    "3": "Daily administration of propranolol to 9 chronically instrumented, trained dogs for 2 weeks caused significant (p less than 0.05) decreases in heart rate (70 +/- 8 to 57 +/- 6 beats/min), cardiac output (3.6 +/- 0.3 to 2.9 +/- 0.2 liters/min), pulmonary arterial pressure (15.7 +/- 0.5 to 10.0 +/- 0.5 mm Hg) and total pulmonary vascular resistance (4.6 +/- 0.6 to 3.3 +/- 0.4 units). Nadolol, a structurally dissimilar beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, caused a similar decrease in total pulmonary resistance. Acute meclofenamate administration did not return to normal pulmonary arterial pressure and resistance in the dogs chronically treated with beta-adrenergic receptor blockers. We therefore conclude that chronic beta-adrenergic receptor blockade lowered pulmonary arterial pressure and resistance by a mechanism independent of cyclooxygenase. In addition, chronic beta-adrenergic receptor blockade did not affect the potential for hypoxic vasoconstriction.", 
    "4": "We report the case of a 58-year-old man with coronary vasospasm that occurred within an anomalous coronary artery. The rapidly progressive clinical course and the dramatic treadmill test result preceeded the diagnostic cardiac catheterization. Combination therapy with isosorbide, beta blocker, and nifedipine resulted in complete resolution of symptoms.", 
    "5": "In this study we correlated the effects of cigarette smoking on the activity of vasopressor systems in humans with changes in heart rate and blood pressure and compared them with changes observed after physical exercise or graded norepinephrine infusion. No relationship was established between changes in either plasma angiotensin II or vasopressin concentration and the hemodynamic parameters, although there was a small increase in both hormones during smoking. In contrast, heart rate (r = -0.245, p less than 0.01, n = 136) was negatively related to plasma norepinephrine concentration during the smoking of five cigarettes. A comparable, negative correlation, although much closer, was found during graded norepinephrine infusion between heart rate and norepinephrine concentration (r = -0.682, p less than 0.001), whereas both parameters were positively related under conditions of physical exercise (r = 0.866, p less than 0.001). In an attempt to block the assumed nicotine-induced sympathetic stimulation, smoking experiments were carried out after acute beta blockade (200 mg metoprolol orally). There was a parallel shift of heart rate and blood pressure to lower values. However, beta blockade did not abolish the smoking-induced rise in blood pressure and heart rate. At the present time no direct evidence is available for a nicotine-induced increase of norepinephrine concentration at postsynaptic receptors during smoking in humans.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "6": "The acute hemodynamic effects of intravenous acebutolol, 50 mg, and propranolol, 10 mg, were evaluated in 12 patients undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterization. Each patient received acebutolol or propranolol according to a list of randomization. Both acebutolol and propranolol depressed left ventricular function. There was a significant increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure at rest and after isometric exercise, with a concomitant decrease in cardiac index. Systemic vascular resistance was increased by both drugs. The increment after patients received acebutolol was not statistically significant; however, with propranolol it was statistically significant. The overall hemodynamic effects of acebutolol and propranolol are similar, but a quantitative difference exists in their effect on systemic vascular resistance. Acebutolol, a cardioselective agent, produces less of a peripheral vascular beta 2-blockade than does propranolol.", 
    "7": "Drugs influencing neurotransmission (alpha 1,2, beta 1,2 agonists, antagonists and diazepam) were given intraperitoneally to test their effects on the mortality of intravenous meglumine diatrizoate. Pretreatment with diazepam in two doses (0.14 and 0.56 mg/kg), alpha 1,2 agonist, beta 1 agonist and beta 1 antagonist affected LD50 so that 5 to 9 per cent more contrast medium could be administered to cause the same mortality as the contrast medium alone. Still higher (19-24%) doses could be used after an alpha 1,2 or alpha 1 antagonist. The beta 1,2 antagonist employed in the test decreased the contrast dosage by 13 per cent, causing the LD50.", 
    "8": "Endralazine is a peripherally-acting vasodilator with chemical and pharmacological similarities to hydralazine. In both normotensive volunteers and essential hypertensives, single oral doses of 10 mg endralazine (in combination with a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist) led to substantial falls in blood pressure, with no significant additional orthostatic effect. Maintenance treatment of hypertensive patients with the addition of 5 or 10 mg B.D. endralazine significantly improved blood pressure control: the mean supine blood pressure improved from 197/107 mmHg, on baseline treatment with a thiazide and beta blocker, to 160/86 after one week and 161/91 mmHg after one year with endralazine as third drug therapy. Apart from facial flushing and mild headache following the early doses, no significant side-effects were observed or reported. In the long term, there was no weight gain to suggest fluid retention and in all patients treated with endralazine for at least one year the anti-nuclear factor remained negative. Following acute administration the terminal elimination half-life of endralazine was approximately 2.5 h and the oral bioavailability was 75%. During chronic dosing with endralazine the terminal elimination half-life significantly increased to a mean of 7.5 h, but there was no accumulation of drug. There were no significant differences related to acetylator phenotype either for the dosage, the pharmacokinetics or the hypotensive effect.", 
    "9": "Systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure (SAP, DAP, MAP), heart rate (HR) and tension time index (TTI) were evaluated in 20 uncomplicated hypertensives and in 20 normotensives at rest and during isometric exercise, performed by handgrip (HG). In the hypertensive population the same parameters were evaluated also after two and six weeks of treatment with a beta-blocking agent, nadolol, given in a single daily dose. In all cases isometric exercise induced a significant increase of SAP, DAP, MAP, HR and TTI and this increase was more relevant in hypertensives than in controls. In the hypertensive population, nadolol was effective in lowering arterial pressure at rest, and significantly reduced the levels of SAP, DAP, MAP, HR and TTI reached at the end of the HG test. Moreover, the increments of the investigated parameters induced by isometric exercise were significantly reduced after nadolol. The results suggest that nadolol, unlike other beta-blocking agents, exerts a \"protective\" action against the hazardous increments of blood pressure which may occur in the daily life of hypertensive subjects during involuntary isometric exercises, and which could trigger dangerous cardiovascular complications.", 
    "10": "The effects of labetalol and propranolol were compared in eight healthy human volunteers using pulse rate and blood pressure changes in response to low rates of adrenaline infusion. Propranolol not only blocked but reversed the positive chronotropic and vasodepressor effects of adrenaline. Labetalol appeared to block these effects only partially. The alpha blocking property of labetalol may have contributed to this difference and hence is unlikely to cause alpha receptor mediated side-effects of endogenously released adrenaline in stress. This model is able to differentiate with great sensitivity between pure beta blockers and alpha beta blocking agents.", 
    "11": "Using half-life disappearance of intradermally injected radioiodine as a parameter for cutaneous blood flow, a study was made of the effects of labetalol and propranolol on the vasoconstrictor response to adrenaline at environmental temperatures of 22 degrees C and 32 degrees C in seven healthy volunteers. Iodine clearance was reduced at 22 degrees C, and at both temperatures by 16 pcg of adrenaline. Orally administered propranolol (20 mg) enhanced these effects at the lower temperature and that of adrenaline at both temperatures. This method unequivocally demonstrates the aggravation of adrenaline-induced cutaneous vasoconstriction caused by oral administration of propranolol and distinguishes it from that caused by labetalol.", 
    "12": "Plasma concentrations of propranolol (PROP) and its active 4-hydroxymetabolite were determined in neurological patients receiving chronic therapy with relatively low PROP doses (40-240 mg/day). Plasma PROP concentrations determined before the morning dose were much lower than, but significantly correlated (r = 0.91) with the drug level two hours after dosing. 4-hydroxypropranolol (4-OH-P) was often undetectable (less than 1 ng/ml) in the early morning samples. Plasma concentrations of both parent drug and metabolite determined two hours after the morning dose correlated weakly with the prescribed daily dose. The intrapatient dose-concentration relationship, on the other hand, was strong, particularly for the parent drug. The ratio between 4-OH-P and PROP in plasma was inversely related to the PROP concentration, at least over the lower PROP concentration range (0-100 ng/ml). The usefulness of determining the concentration of the metabolite in the evaluation of the pharmacological action of low doses of PROP is discussed.", 
    "13": "Blood pressure response in 75 patients with primary hypertension to a readjusted treatment regimen was studied. The patients were given 13 antihypertensive drugs in 18 combinations. Since they all suffered from severe hypertension, the first choice was a combination of beta-blocker and diuretic. A vasodilator (hydralazine or prazosin) was added when necessary to control blood pressure. During a three-year follow-up study the patients' systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly lowered, from 174 (SD, +/- 25)/113 (SD, +/- 12) to 154 (SD, +/- 19)/98 (SD, +/- 8) mmHg. There was a significant decrease in serum creatinine levels, but body weight, heart volume, and serum lipid levels remained unchanged. In 62 (83%) patients diastolic blood pressure was reduced below 100 mmHg, and in 13 (17%) it remained above 100 mmHg. During the three-year follow-up study no patients with a diastolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg had a stroke, while three patients with a diastolic blood pressure above 100 mmHg did. This study demonstrates that heterogeneous drug combinations might fail to adequately control blood pressure and reducing the number of combinations might improve control.", 
    "14": "The effects of the beta-adrenoceptor-blocking drugs propranolol, metoprolol, pindolol, and placebo, on mucociliary clearance were studied in three groups of 6 subjects with coronary heart disease and normal lung function. Clearance rates of inhaled 99mTc-labeled human serum albumin minimicrospheres were determined over the apical right region of the lung with a gamma camera. A 3-day medication of propranolol 40 mg b.i.d., when compared with placebo, led to a significant decrease (p less than or equal to 0.05) in mucociliary clearance. Metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d. or pindolol 5 mg b.i.d. did not show any influence on mucociliary clearance. Implications for the use of different types of beta-adrenoceptor-blocking drugs in the treatment of coronary heart disease are discussed.", 
    "15": "A fixed dose combination of 10 mg timolol and 2.5 mg bendrofluazide was evaluated in 1640 general practice patients with mild to moderate hypertension. This was an open study lasting 3 months with an initial 2-week placebo controlled run-in phase. Of the 1315 patients who were evaluable, 1169 (89%) became normotensive on a mean single daily dose of 1.75 tablets. Fifty-four (4%) patients were uncontrolled on a maximum dose of 4 tablets daily and 79 (6%) patients stopped therapy prematurely due to side-effects. A further 13 (1%) patients withdrew because of hypotension or bradycardia. Biochemical parameters stayed within normal values. Overall, the results showed that the combination of timolol and bendrofluazide was an effective and well accepted treatment for mild to moderate hypertension in a large and varied general practice population.", 
    "16": "DL-propranolol, at a dose of 2 mg . l-1, induced in the isolated rat heart an increase in adenine nucleotide synthesis from exogenous 5 microM adenosine (+20%). If supplied during reperfusion following low-flow ischaemia (0.5 ml . min-1, 30 min.), propranolol annulled the decrease in adenosine incorporation (-23%) provoked by ischaemia. When propranolol was given during ischaemia and reperfusion, ATP degradation during the ischaemic period was reduced and adenosine uptake was strongly stimulated on reperfusion (+60%).", 
    "17": "In order to assess acute effects of nitroglycerin, nifedipine and metoprolol on normal, ischemic and scar myocardial segments in man, non-invasive hemodynamic and radionuclide measurements of left ventricular function were performed. Sixteen patients with single left anterior descending (LAD) disease were studied at rest and during exercise: 9 patients with angina and exercise-induced ischemia (LAD stenosis) and 7 patients with previous transmural myocardial infarction and no ischemic changes at thallium imaging (LAD occlusion). Effects on regional ejection fraction were compared between involved antero-septal and normal postero-lateral areas. Global ejection fraction at rest was unchanged after nitroglycerin, increased after nifedipine and decreased after metoprolol. In patients with ischemia, improvement in exercise ejection fraction after all drugs was due to increased regional ejection fraction in ischemic segments, i.e. a real anti-ischemic effect could be demonstrated. In regions of myocardial scar, regional ejections fraction was not changed after either drug. In normal areas, regional ejection fraction remained unchanged after nitroglycerin and nifedipine but decreased after acute beta-blockade. Despite the very similar anti-ischemic effects of all drugs, underlying hemodynamic mechanisms were quite different: Reduction in preload and afterload after nitroglycerin, vasodilatation and reflex sympathetic activity after nifedipine and reduction in double product and contractility after metoprolol. Thus, the mode of action of nitroglycerin, nifedipine and metoprolol on normal, ischemic and scar myocardial segments could be demonstrated in man. Non-invasive antianginal drug testing as shown in this study should allow optimal medical therapy for patients with chronic ischemic heart disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "18": "Different pharmacologic drugs (isadrin, obsidan, phentolamine) changing adrenergic processes are shown to have different effect on the growth and development of lung metastases. An increase in the antimetastatic effect of some cytostatics is also observed in mice with Lewis carcinoma and melanoma B-16 under the influence of isadrin, a stimulator of beta-adrenoreceptors. In authors' opinion, isadrin changes microcirculation in lungs and prevents inhibition of the immune reactivity in animals with metastatic tumours, thus contributing to inhibition of the development and growth of metastases.", 
    "19": "Effects of trapidil and nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate) on coronary blood flow or epicardial coronary diameter were studied in conscious dogs, instrumented with a Doppler flow probe or a pair of ultrasonic dimension crystals on the left circumflex coronary artery. Bolus intravenous injections of trapidil (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg i.v.) increased coronary blood flow, dose-dependently, such being comparable at the peak value seen with nitroglycerin (5, 10 and 20 micrograms/kg i.v.). Coronary blood flow following the intravenous administration of trapidil or nitroglycerin increased biphasically and returned to pre-drug levels in 1.4 +/- 0.2 min (trapidil 1 mg/kg i.v.) or 1.0 +/- 0.1 min (nitroglycerin 10 micrograms/kg i.v.), while the mean coronary diameter increased monophasically and approached the control level 5 min after drug administration. The first peak was observed before the maximal decrease in aortic pressure and the second peak was associated with concomitant increases in heart rate and myocardial contractility induced by a sudden hypotension. Propranolol, a beta-blocker, did not modify the initial peak but attenuated markedly the second peak (P less than 0.05) in case of trapidil (1.0 mg/kg i.v.) or nitroglycerin (10 micrograms/kg i.v.), which corresponded with reduced changes in reflex tachycardia and positive inotropism. Therefore, the direct effects of trapidil and nitroglycerin on coronary circulation of conscious dogs are an initial transient dilatation of the resistance vessels followed by a continuation of the dilatation of the conductance coronary vessels.", 
    "20": "Thirty patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension were treated for an average of 44 months by 14 internists in private practice. All patients had previously participated in a controlled comparative trial of antihypertensive drugs carried out by the same physicians in their offices. During the long-term follow-up period, ie, after completion of the initial trial, the physicians administered antihypertensive therapy based on their best judgment; the drugs they most commonly prescribed were diuretics (80% of patients) and beta-blocking agents (60% of patients). Although 80% of the patients received at least two different antihypertensive agents, diastolic pressures fell below 96 mmHg in approximately 60% of the patients and below 90 mmHg in only a small fraction. Thus it appears that it is not easy for physicians in private practice to optimally reduce blood pressure levels in hypertensive patients despite the availability of numerous antihypertensive drugs. The tendency of practitioners to approximate blood pressure levels to multiples of 5 or even 10 mmHg may be partially responsible for the unsatisfactory results.", 
    "21": "Dopaminergic and adrenergic mechanisms were studied in a dog model which made possible physiological stimulation by food and comparison of vagally innervated and denervated acid and pepsin response at the same time. Five dogs were equipped with two pouches separated from the stomach, and stimulation was done by a standard meal - a mixture of liver, heart and bonemeal , 10 g/kg. The meal was combined with different doses of dopamine 0.1 - 2.0 - 20.0 - 40.0 micrograms/kg/min and with single doses of phentolamine, propranolol and sulpiride separately and combined with dopamine. Acid and pepsin secretion were inhibited in dose-response manner by dopamine in innervated mucosa, but all other effects of the compounds were different in parietal cells and chief cells and in vagally innervated and denervated mucosa.", 
    "22": "The effects of levodopa, apomorphine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine (DOPS) on tonic seizures elicited by strychnine were investigated in mice. Levodopa (6.25-100 mg/kg), apomorphine (0.2-0.8 mg/kg) and FLA-63 (12.5 mg/kg) profoundly delayed the onset and reduced the incidence of strychnine seizures. In addition, these drugs decreased strychnine-induced mortality. DOPS (1-16 mg/kg) apparently shortened the onset of strychnine seizures and altered strychnine-induced mortality in a dose-dependent manner; low doses (1-2 mg/kg) enhanced while moderate doses (4-8 mg/kg) reduced the mortality rate. FLA-63 (12.5 mg/kg) potentiated the anticonvulsant effect of low doses of levodopa (6.25-12.5 mg/kg) while it had no significant influence on the anticonvulsant effect of higher doses (25-100 mg/kg) of levodopa. In addition, the onset of strychnine seizure was further delayed by FLA-63. Haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg) potentiated the convulsant effect of strychnine (1 mg/kg) as well as strychnine-induced mortality. It also antagonised the protective effect of levodopa (12.5 and 100 mg/kg) against strychnine (1 mg/kg). Phentolamine (5 mg/kg) and +/- propranolol (1 mg/kg) antagonised strychnine seizures. Strychnine-induced mortality was also reduced by these drugs. In addition, the effects of DOPS (2 mg/kg) on strychnine seizures were antagonised by phentolamine and propranolol. These results indicate that enhancement of dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission respectively attenuate and potentiate strychnine seizures in mice.", 
    "23": "There have been conflicting reports on the safety of combining beta-adrenergic receptor blockers and Ca++-antagonists, especially verapamil, in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Warnings have been raised against additive negative chronotropic and inotropic effects. This study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of simultaneous administration of verapamil, 360 mg daily, and atenolol, 100 mg daily, with that of either drug alone. Eighteen patients (mean age 58 years) with chronic stable angina were included in the study. After a two-week run-in period, the patients received either drug alone for six weeks and were then given the combination for another six weeks. Frequent ECG and blood pressure measurements were performed. Radionuclide evaluation of left ventricular ejection fraction was done before and at the end of the combined therapy. Exercise testing using a bicycle ergometer was performed during each treatment period. Only one patient developed sinus bradycardia when on combined therapy (48 bpm). The P-Q time increased with single drug therapy as well as with the combination (p less than 0.01). Maximal exercise time increased more with the combination than with single drug therapy. No serious adverse hemodynamic effects were recorded. LVEF increased by 4.6% (p less than 0.01) with the combined therapy. A decrease in nitroglycerine consumption occurred, beeing most pronounced with the combined therapy and corresponding to a subjective improvement. It is concluded that an additive negative chronotropism occurred but that the combination is safe and offers an effective therapeutic alternative in chronic stable angina.", 
    "24": "In a double blind cross-over study the effect of verapamil (Isoptin) 360 mg/d and propranolol 180 mg/d was evaluated in patients with stable angina of effort. The results of verapamil and propranolol treatment were compared to a single blind placebo period of 2 weeks. Both verapamil and propranolol caused a significant reduction in nitroglycerin consumption, days with angina pectoris and in severe angina attacks as compared to placebo. A 50% reduction in angina pectoris attacks and/or nitroglycerin consumption compared to placebo was demonstrated in thirteen of eighteen patients during verapamil treatment (P less than 0.01) and in seven of seventeen patients during propranolol treatment (P greater than 0.05). Of sixteen patients completing both treatment periods, ten were improved both on verapamil and propranolol, three on verapamil only, one on propranolol only, one was unchanged and one deteriorated on verapamil and propranolol. During exercise, maximum exercise capacity was increased during verapamil as compared to placebo (P less than 0.01) and propranolol (P less than 0.02). Maximum exercise capacity was not increased after propranolol as compared to placebo. These findings, that verapamil is at least as effective as propranolol in the treatment of angina of effort, are in accordance with other reported series.", 
    "25": "We studied the influence of a perfluorochemical (PFC) emulsion on the ultrastructure and function of the isolated perfused guinea pig heart compared to a Krebs-Henseleit solution. The PFC perfusion enhanced the force of contraction and reduced the coronary flow rate, but had no influence on the frequency and the oxygen consumption. The positive inotropic action of K-strophanthin and isoproterenol was slightly strengthened, whereas the beta-adrenergic antagonism by propranolol and the vasodilatation by glycerol trinitrate remained unchanged. The positive chronotropic action of isoproterenol was reduced during PFC perfusion. No histological differences depending on the perfusion medium were observed. It is concluded that PFC perfusion improves the functional state of the Langendorff preparation.", 
    "26": "Although adrenergic agonists increase resting ventilation and responsiveness to CO2, there are conflicting data about the effect of adrenergic blockade on ventilatory responses. In this study, we investigated the effect of alpha- or beta-adrenergic blockade on the response to hyperoxic CO2 rebreathing in awake goats. In 5 goats, studied before and after intravenous administration of phentolamine or propranolol, there was no difference (compared to control studies) in the mean slope, x-intercept, or ventilation at end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2) = 70 torr for the CO2 response curves after either drug. When mean inspiratory flow rate (VT/Ti) was plotted against PETCO2, there was also no change in these measurements after propranolol. After phentolamine, there was a slight decrease in the slope and x-intercept, but no change in VT/Ti at PETCO2 = 70 torr. We conclude that acute administration of alpha- or beta-adrenergic blockers does not affect ventilatory response to CO2 inhalation in goats, and suggest that adrenergic activity is not an important modulating influence for CO2 responsiveness in this species.", 
    "27": "In the past five years, new therapeutic modalities have been discovered that have revolutionized the medical and surgical management of glaucoma. New methods of drug delivery have been developed for pilocarpine and epinephrine. Timolol maleate has become the most widely used drug in the treatment of glaucoma since it was approved for general use in 1978. This chapter reviews the pharmacology of the newer antiglaucoma medications and gives a perspective on the role of laser surgery in open-angle glaucoma.", 
    "28": "Renin release elicited by i.v. injection of loop-diuretics was used to study the effects of angiotensin II (AII) on intrarenal hemodynamics. The vasoconstrictive action of intrarenally synthesized AII predominates in the efferent glomerular arteriole. Such a vasoconstrictive effect could affect blood flow in the vasa recta which stem from efferent arterioles of juxtamedullary glomeruli. Renin secretion and renal inner medullary blood flow (tissue clearance of 133Xe) were simultaneously measured before and after frusemide-induced renin release. The relationship between renin secretion and renal inner medullary blood flow was inverse. Changes in renal medullary blood flow may be physiological determinants of medullary osmolality and renal concentration ability. The intrarenal role of AII in urinary concentration recovery after frusemide was examined. Inhibition of renin release by propranolol or AII-blockade (by saralasin or Hoe 409) delayed recovery of urinary osmolality. In the conscious rat, propranolol slowed down recovery of the cortico-papillary gradient for sodium. Its vasoconstrictive action on the efferent glomerular arteriole might enable the renin-angiotensin system to participate in the control of renal excretion of salt and water.", 
    "29": "The efficacy and acceptability of a single half-tablet daily of a fixed combination of 400 mg acebutolol and 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide was assessed in a study of 35 patients suffering from mild to moderate essential hypertension. The results of the 22 patients who completed the 3-month active drug period showed that treatment produced a significant reduction in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure. This effect was apparent from the first week and was maintained throughout the trial. Pulse rate was also lowered by therapy. No clinically significant changes from normal were observed in mean serum potassium and uric acid levels, and no side-effects of treatment were reported.", 
    "30": "Isolated perfused and electrically driven heart preparations of guinea pigs and tissue from different parts of the rabbit hearts have the capacity to rapidly synthesize prostacyclin (PGI2) and thromboxane (TXB2). Auricles showed a higher PGI2 formation than ventricles. Addition of arachidonic acid or PGH2 markedly enhanced the myocardial PGI2 biosynthesis. After acute pressure overload by a graduated aortic stenosis the PGI2 and TXB2 formation of the myocardium is decreased possibly caused by a diminished availability of substrate, an alteration of enzyme activities or changes in the functional state of the cardiac tissue. Pretreatment with dipyridamole or propranolol again induced an increase of this diminished PGI2 and TXB2 synthesis. The PGI2 formation of electrically driven ventricular strips enhanced with an increased stimulation rate. Ouabain, antianginal drugs (dipyridamole, oxyfedrine, propranolol) and endogenous mediators (norepinephrine, histamine, adenosine) induced a significant rise of the cardiac PGI2 formation. The results suggest that the cardiac prostaglandin biosynthesis is involved in the action of the myocardium indicating heart sufficiency and an adaptability to mechanical loading or drug influence.", 
    "31": "Captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, was used to treat 14 patients with lupus nephritis and severe hypertension. All patients had reduced renal function and were on regular immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids and azathioprine. The initial dosage of captopril was reduced according to the level of renal impairment. 11 patients were treated for more than 6 months. Excellent blood pressure control was achieved with captopril, from a mean of 178 +/- 7/110 +/- 4 to 145 +/- 5/92 +/- 3 mm Hg at 6 months, usually in combination with a diuretic only. In 5 cases, a beta-blocker was added. In 3 patients, captopril therapy was discontinued within the 1st month of treatment. 1 patient did not respond to captopril at all; 1 patient had a rejection crisis and required dialysis; in 1 case, a general exanthema developed within 3 weeks and captopril medication was stopped. In addition to blood pressure control, renal function improved in 7 of the long-term-treated patients (mean increase in glomerular filtration rate 73 +/- 34%). In 3 patients, a continued slow deterioration renal function occurred, and in 1 patient, renal function remained unchanged. It is concluded that captopril is an effective antihypertensive drug in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Captopril treatment increased renal function in 64% of patients on long-term therapy. Not only optimal blood pressure control but other factors may also contribute to this beneficial effect, such as drug-induced prostaglandin release potentiating immunosuppressive treatment. Captopril may in fact be the drug of choice for the treatment of SLE patients with severe hypertension.", 
    "32": "This paper discusses: (1) the difficulties associated with description and assessment of Type A behaviour (TAB); (2) the association between measures of TAB and psychopathology; (3) new approaches to the measurement of TAB; and (4) the results of recent studies that have attempted to modify the behaviour pattern, using (a) psychological treatment, (b) exercise, and (c) drug treatment. The psychological dimensions underlying Type A behavioral characteristics have not been identified, and attention is drawn to the very small overlap between the main instruments used to measure the behaviour pattern. An examination of the association between the different measures of TAB and psychopathology suggests that both the Framingham Type A scale and the Bortner scale show high correlations with neurotic manifestations of personality. A case is made for exploring the relationship between the behavior pattern and other psychosocial variables that have been shown in both retrospective and prospective studies to be associated with CHD risk. The paper describes a new method of conceptualising and describing TAB, derived from cognitive social learning theory. This model asserts that assessment of the individual's personal beliefs and fears is essential if the observable behaviours associated with pattern A are to be modified. In the Recurrent Coronary Prevention Project, attempts to modify TAB using techniques derived from cognitive behaviour therapy have produced encouraging results. Future large scale studies of CHD prevention should take account of psychosocial and personality variables as well as more traditional risk factors.", 
    "33": "A post-marketing clinical trial was carried out in ambulatory patients to assess the efficacy and toleration of atenolol (100 mg)/chlorthalidone (25 mg) tablets in the treatment of arterial hypertension. Data are reported on a cut-off at 2449 patients. Analysis of results in the different age groups has shown that after 4 weeks of treatment there was a mean fall of 16-17% in systolic and of 16-18% in diastolic blood pressure. Adequate blood pressure reduction was obtained for all age groups. The frequency of adverse reactions/events was low, these being reported in only 5.7% of cases. As discontinuation of treatment on account of adverse reactions/events occurred in 3.8% of patients, the risk-to-benefit relationship of atenolol/chlorthalidone tablets was very favourable.", 
    "34": "The effects of once daily dosage of the two cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents, atenolol and metoprolol, were studied in 26 patients with primary hypertension. The study was a randomized double-blind cross-over trial with placebo run-in and wash-out. Assessment of effect was performed about 1 and 25 hours after dosing. At rest, both atenolol and metoprolol lowered the blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) compared to placebo. Atenolol induced a more effective BP reduction than metoprolol, especially 25 hours after drug intake. During exercise 1 hour after dosing both drugs reduced BP and HR to a similar extent, whereas 25 hours after dosing atenolol gave a more efficient BP and HR reduction than metoprolol. Our data show that both 100 mg atenolol and 100 mg metoprolol are effective antihypertensive beta-blockers at rest and during exercise, 1 hour after intake. Metoprolol was less effective than atenolol 25 hours after dosing probably due to its shorter plasma half-life, thus implying a twice daily regimen for metoprolol in standard preparation.", 
    "35": "In 585 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and no previous MI the maximal activity of serum heat-stable lactate dehydrogenase (LD) (EC 1.1.1.27) activity was related to 1-year and 2-year mortality rates. All patients participated in a double-blind trial with metoprolol during the first three months after an AMI. Thereafter both groups were treated in a similar way. A strong relationship was found between LD maximum activity and the in-hospital prognosis (p less than 0.001), the 1-year survival rate (p less than 0.001) and the 2-year survival rate (p less than 0.001). When the patients who were alive after primary hospitalization were analyzed as a separate group, the relationship between LD maximum activity and 1-year and 2-year survival rates remained (p less than 0.001). In a subsample of 171 patients the maximal activity of creatine kinase (CK) (EC 2.7.3.2) and CK subunit B did not correlate either with in-hospital, 1-year or 2-year survival rates. We conclude that, when a sufficiently large number of patients are investigated, there is a strong relationship between serum enzyme maximum activity and short- and long-term survival.", 
    "36": "The effects of oral doses of diazepam (single dose of 10 mg and a median dose of 30 mg/day for 2 weeks) and propranolol (single dose of 80 mg and a median dose of 240 mg/day for 2 weeks) on psychological performance of patients with panic disorders and agoraphobia were investigated in a double-blind, randomized and crossover design. Both drugs impaired immediate free recall but the decrease was greater for diazepam than propranolol. Delayed free recall was also impaired but the two drugs did not differ. Patients tapped faster after propranolol than diazepam and they were more sedated after diazepam than propranolol. After 2 weeks of treatment, patients tested 5-8 h after the last dose of medication did not show any decrement of performance. These results are similar to those previously found in healthy subjects. Accumulation of drugs was not reflected in prolonged behavioral impairment.", 
    "37": "In order to test the additional efficacy of the combination of a beta blocker (penbutolol 40 mg single dose) with molsidomine (2 mg single dose), a double blind cross-over trial was performed in 30 patients with stable angina pectoris. Stress tests were done before and 1 h after the beta blocker alone and the combination therapy. Some training effect could be detected on comparing results from the first and second days. Combined therapy showed a better response of resting systolic arterial pressure, resting and maximal diastolic pressure, heart rate gain (from rest to maximal effort) and particularly in the angina severity score. All of these variables changed significantly in comparison to the beta blocker alone, 46 out of 60 post-drug ergometric studies were negative; of the 14 positive tests, 11 followed the beta blocker and only 3 the combined therapy. The combination of a preload reducer molsidomine and a beta blocker may be adequate for patients only partially compensated or with cardiomegaly and/or a depressed ejection fraction.", 
    "38": "In 563 patients with acute myocardial infarction and no previous myocardial infarction, the estimated infarct size was related to the estimated duration of pain and the amount of analgesics given. The size of infarction estimated from analyses of heat-stable lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) at 12-hour intervals for 48-108 h and from Q- and R-wave changes in the ECG correlated positively, although weakly with duration of the pain and the amount of analgesics given. These data support the hypothesis that larger infarcts, as a group, evolve over a longer time period than smaller infarcts and that the duration of pain in many patients might be an indicator of the infarct size. In the individual patient, however, one cannot predict the size of the infarction from the severity of pain.", 
    "39": "The antihypertensive efficacy and the acceptability of nifedipine (NI, Adalat) and the usefulness of its combination with a beta 1-selective blocking drug, acebutolol (AC), were studied in a placebo controlled trial on 15 patients with moderate hypertension. The study consisted of three phases: 1. An acute test, including the single blind comparison of three different single doses of NI (5, 10, 20 mg), alone and in combination with AC 200 mg, with placebo and with AC alone (200 mg), showed an early hypotensive effect, with no differences for the three doses of NI, reaching the maximum between 50 and 240 min, greater than the one of AC, and smaller in comparison with the one of the combinations, which didn't differ at the three doses of NI. Heart rate (HR) and side effects, instead, increased with the increasing doses of NI, suggesting a worse acceptability for the greater doses. 2. A long-term treatment, including a double-blind comparison of three separate periods of 4 weeks of treatment with NI (10 mg three times a day), AC (200 mg three times a day) and with the combination of the same doses, showed a significant reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) for each treatment, not significantly different at rest for the three single drugs but greater for the combined treatment, assuring also a better control of systolic BP during exercise. A reduced number of side effects was seen with the combined therapy which seems to contribute to a better compliance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "40": "The effect on plasma lipids of acebutolol given orally over a 6-month period to 18 patients with essential hypertension was studied. There were no significant changes in the concentrations of plasma total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol and triglycerides during treatment. The level of HDL cholesterol decreased slightly but not significantly during treatment. Plasma free fatty acids decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) during treatment with acebutolol. During an oral glucose tolerance test, blood glucose values were elevated after acebutolol therapy at 60 (p less than 0.05) and 120 min (p less than 0.05). No impairment of insulin release was observed after acebutolol therapy.", 
    "41": "Seventy-four patients from four short-term studies of captopril in mild-moderate essential hypertension continued in a cooperative long-term efficacy and tolerance program. The duration of observation is 2- greater than 4 years, the total treatment time being 2434 months. No development of resistance to therapy was observed. The total daily dose of captopril has been gradually decreased and in 20 patients changed from t.i.d. to b.i.d. regime. The drug has been well tolerated and only few and mild side-effects have been observed after the initial titration period. The drop-outs (n = 19) were mostly due to non-medical causes (n = 14). Except for one case of proteinuria, no laboratory abnormalities were detected and there were no signs of long-term toxicity.", 
    "42": "After receiving placebo for two weeks, 20 patients with essential hypertension were randomly divided into two groups. Those in group 1 received a combination of 25 mg of captopril (CPT) and 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) BID. Those in group 2 received a combination of 80 mg of oxprenolol (OXP) and 10 mg of chlorthalidone (CHLT) BID. Patients whose recumbent diastolic blood pressure was less than 95 mmHg after four weeks of treatment continued with the same regimen for six more weeks, while the dosages were doubled for nonresponders. All the patients in group 1 had satisfactory blood pressure readings after the first four weeks of therapy; six patients in group 2 required double dosages to control their blood pressure. Both drug combinations reduced patients' recumbent systolic blood pressure, but CPT + HCT reduced their diastolic and standing systolic blood pressure more effectively. Doubling the dosages of OXP + CHLT was only slightly more effective in controlling patients' blood pressure. In addition, patients who received CPT + HCT showed a significant decrease in serum sodium level, whereas patients who received the double dosages of OXP + CHLT showed a significant increase in serum cholesterol and creatinine levels. The data suggest that low dosages of CPT + HCT control blood pressure more effectively than high dosages of OXP + CHLT and, in addition, do not have any negative metabolic effects.", 
    "43": "The antihypertensive effect of a new compound, prizidilol hydrochloride (SKF 92657), with both vasodilator and non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist properties was assessed in a series of 17 outpatients 2 of whom were subsequently withdrawn. After a placebo period the systolic supine blood pressure decreased from 154 (SD 3) mmHg to 143 (SD 4) mmHg (p less than 0.05) and the diastolic supine blood pressure from 102 (SD 2) mmHg to 94 (2) mmHg (p less than 0.02) during 12 weeks treatment. Standing blood blood pressure decreased by 14/9 mmHg (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.02) during treatment. The dose of prizidilol was increased by 100 mg biweekly, the mean dose being 466 mg at the end of the study. No significant side-effects were noted and the laboratory tests disclosed no significant biochemical or immunological changes during the study.", 
    "44": "The experience with captopril is limited in patients who are hypertensive after renal transplantation. An increased risk of side effects has been expected because of immunosuppressive therapy and a reduced renal function. We have used captopril in 58 transplanted patients with hypertension. On previous antihypertensive treatment diastolic blood pressure could not be maintained below 100 mm Hg. All patients were on immunosuppressive therapy using prednisolone in combination with azathioprine or cyclosporin. Before captopril treatment the mean s-creatinine concentration was 225 +/- 143 mumol/l. Fifty-four patients were treated for more than four weeks and 28 of them for six months or more. The mean daily dose of captopril was 90 mg. All patients also used furosemide and 2/3 were on a beta-blocker. Captopril was discontinued in nine cases within the first two months, in three because of an unsatisfactory effect on BP, in four because of side effects and in two after successful treatment of a renal artery stenosis of the transplant. The patients who were treated with captopril within the first year after transplantation responded better than patients where treatment was started more than one year after transplantation (p less than 0.05). Half of the patients given captopril early even showed a decrease of s-creatinine during treatment. Captopril in combination with a diuretic and a beta-blocker reduces blood pressure in patients with treatment resistant hypertension following renal transplantation. The risk for serious side effects is small provided that the captopril dose is low and white cell counts and s-creatinine levels are closely monitored.", 
    "45": "Thirty-two patients with moderate to severe essential hypertension whose supine diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) was greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg following 2 weeks' treatment with the optimal dosage of beta blocker-diuretic combination were randomly assigned to the addition of either captopril 25 mg or 50 mg b.i.d. After 6 weeks' treatment, if patients were not normalized (SDBP less than 95 mm Hg), the dose of captopril was doubled for a further 6 weeks. The addition of captopril led to a significant fall in standing and supine diastolic and systolic blood pressure at the end of the sixth and twelfth week of treatment. There was no difference in the change in blood pressure between the two groups. At the end of the study SDBP was normalized in 66% of patients and a further 12.5% had their SDBP reduced by greater than 10%. Captopril 25 or 50 mg administered twice daily proved to be a very effective antihypertensive agent when added to a beta blocker-diuretic combination in patients resistant to optimal doses of these drugs.", 
    "46": "The effects of metoprolol (Betaloc tablets) in a group of 193 hypertensives were compared with the effects of a slow-release formulation (Betaloc Durules) in a further group of 196 patients. Patients were selected at random for treatment. There were no differences between the groups in terms of age, weight, sex, blood pressure, concurrent illness or concomitant therapy. Blood pressure control and apparent adverse effects were similar for both groups; the overall withdrawal rate from each group was similar. Compliance, assessed by tablet counts, was significantly improved in the group receiving once-daily therapy. Simplification of the dosage regimen to once-daily therapy appears to improve the patient's willingness to comply with the physician's instructions.", 
    "47": "Alcoholics during detoxification have elevated blood pressures which are related to the severity of their withdrawal symptoms. We studied the effect of a non-selective beta-blocker, timolol on symptoms, blood pressure and plasma levels of cortisol (PC), noradrenaline (NA), vasopressin (AVP) and renin activity (PRA) during alcohol withdrawal. Eighteen alcoholics, admitted for detoxification, were randomly allocated to timolol or placebo in a double blind trial. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms did not differ either before or after timolol or placebo but patients receiving timolol required less sedation with chlormethiazole. Systolic blood pressures (SBP) and pulse both fell significantly during detoxification in both groups, the change being greater with timolol. Plasma levels of cortisol, NA, AVP and PRA fell significantly, though only NA and PC correlated with initial SBP. Timolol had no effect on any of the biochemical parameters observed. The pressor response to alcohol withdrawal is reduced by beta-blockade and the height of the blood pressure is related to plasma NA and PC levels. Alcohol withdrawal hypertension is probably due to increased sympathetic activity.", 
    "48": "Indomethacin and sulindac were used as tools to study the role of renal and/or systemic prostaglandins in the pharmacological response to atenolol. Patients receiving chronic treatment with atenolol 100 mg received indomethacin 50 mg twice daily or sulindac 200 mg twice daily in a randomised crossover trial. Indomethacin significantly reduced the antihypertensive action of atenolol while sulindac had no effect. The role that systemic and/or renal prostaglandins may play in the antihypertensive action of atenolol is discussed with reference to renal PGI2 production and inhibition of platelet cyclo-oxygenase.", 
    "49": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a long-acting formulation of 60 mg propranolol (Inderal LA; in the following briefly called LA) once a day were compared with those of conventional propranolol (Inderal; in the following called CV) 20 mg three times a day, by a double-blind cross-over method in healthy volunteers. After a single oral dose with LA in 10 subjects, the blood level slowly increased to reach the peak plasma level (Cmax) of 11.56 +/- 2.15 ng/ml (mean +/- SE) at 5 h which was lower than that of CV (42.93 +/- 19.26 ng/ml). However, the peak plasma level was almost constant for another 5 h with LA (11.03 +/- 2.38 ng/ml at 10 h). The elimination half-life with LA was significantly longer than with CV (6.5 +/- 1.0, 3.9 +/- 0.5 h, respectively). The plasma level at 24 h did not differ between LA and CV (3.34 +/- 0.92, 5.47 +/- 1.38 ng/ml, respectively). LA and CV were orally administered for 8 consecutive days in 6 subjects. The plasma level after LA accumulated and Cmax was 1.6 times higher and the area under the time-concentration curve (AUC) 1.7 times higher than on Day 1, but no accumulation of the plasma level was seen after CV. On Day 8 the plasma level after 24 h of LA turned-out to be higher than that of CV (4.4 +/- 2.2, 3.5 +/- 1.5 ng/ml). Although the exercise heart rate was significantly more suppressed by CV than LA on Day 1, the difference disappeared on Day 8.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "50": "Lorcainide, a new class I antiarrhythmic agent, was administered intravenously to eight patients with acute myocardial infarction for 24 hours, and thereafter given by mouth, 200 mg daily for ten days. Ten control infarction patients were given lidocaine 3 mg/min during the first 24 hours and the oral betablocking agent, pindolol, for the following ten days. The two groups were comparable with respect to age, sex, onset-admission interval, and site and size of infarction. Ventricular premature beats were monitored with a 24-hour continuous ECG recording on days 1, 6 and 10. Complex ventricular premature beats were common during the first 24 hours of infarction; their occurrence and severity were similar in both groups, as judged by the Lown grading system. The plasma levels of lorcainide after the 24-hour infusion ranged 72-144 ng/ml (mean 95 ng/ml). On the sixth day, 12 hours after previous oral dose, lorcainide plasma levels ranged 11-82 ng/ml (mean 42 ng/ml). No major adverse effects were noticed, mild insomnia being the most disturbing reaction. It is concluded that lorcainide is an acceptable alternative to lidocaine in the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias in the acute stage of myocardial infarction. It has the advantage of being effective by oral route, too.", 
    "51": "Despite the availability of techniques and concepts for examining the physiologic processes of drug disposition and clearance by the liver in normal subjects and in patients with liver disease, important questions remain in this field. Major problems include high inducibility of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes, even in patients with liver disease (normal drug clearances can occur in liver disease patients who chronically ingest drugs that induce these enzymes); poor correlation between routine liver function tests, such as SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin, and alterations of hepatic drug metabolism in hepatocellular disease; failure of all drugs to be similarly affected in liver disease, even for drugs with similar metabolic pathways. Nevertheless, certain test drugs, such as antipyrine and aminopyrine, whose clearances from plasma or saliva closely reflect their hepatic metabolism, may serve as probes to explore under normal and disease conditions how drugs are handled in the liver. Nevertheless, limitations in the use of antipyrine and aminopyrine metabolism as tests of hepatic function must be recognized: special conditions of patients may render results of these tests by themselves impossible to interpret. Utilizing additional drug substrates and measuring rates of formation of individual metabolites, as well as disappearance of parent drug, investigators may be able to research more effectively and in greater detail for interrelationships between liver disease and the processes of hepatic drug metabolism, hepatic blood flow, and even other, as yet unidentified, processes that influence liver and drugs interactions.", 
    "52": "One thousand four hundred and two patients with essential hypertension were treated by their general practitioners for 3 months with one tablet daily consisting of 200 mg acebutolol plus 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide: 813 were newly diagnosed and 589 were known hypertensives already on treatment. There was no 'wash-out' period before the latter changed to the study treatment. Newly diagnosed hypertensives had an average initial mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 129.9 mm Hg which fell on average by 18.2% during the study: 79% of patients had good results with final MAP levels less than 113 mm Hg (equivalent to e.g., 160/90 mm Hg), and a further 7% also had good results in that MAP fell more than 15%, another 12.5% had moderate results (falls of 5% to 15%): and only 1.5% had poor results (fell less than 5%). Known hypertensives had an average MAP of 127 mm Hg on previous treatment, which fell on average by 15.4% during this study: 70% of patients had good results with final MAP levels less than 113 mm Hg and a further 7% also had good results in that MAP fell more than 15%: 18% had moderate results and 3% poor results. Pulse rate fell by 12.5% in newly diagnosed and 10% in known treated hypertensives. If allowance is made for withdrawals due to side-effects and to the need for more than one tablet of Secadrex daily, then over all 75.7% had a good blood pressure response to study medication, 13.7% a moderate response and 10.7% a poor response. Adverse effects caused the withdrawal of 4% of newly diagnosed and 5% of treated hypertensives, predominantly nausea/vomiting, lassitude/fatigue and malaise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "53": "After screening a local population in the northern part of The Netherlands for hypertension, 119 patients with a diastolic pressure (DP) between 95 and 120 mmHg were randomised and treated either with 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide (n = 59) or 100 mg atenolol (n = 60). After 1 month of treatment 6 patients in the hydrochlorothiazide group and 24 patients in the atenolol group had reached a DP less than or equal to 90 mmHg (p less than 0.001). 43 of the 50 non-responders to hydrochlorothiazide were switched to atenolol and 30 of the 35 non-responders to atenolol were changed to hydrochlorothiazide. One month after the switch 19 patients in the atenolol group and 2 patients in the hydrochlorothiazide group had reached a DP less than or equal to 90 mmHg (p less than 0.001). After 6 months of treatment 32 of the 43 atenolol responders and 7 of the 8 hydrochlorothiazide responders were still receiving the same medication, as their DP was still less than or equal to 90 mmHg. Non-responders to either medication were given the combination (n = 46). 21 patients now became normotensive as did a further 10 after increasing the dose of atenolol to 200 mg. Thus, in all 70 patients had a blood pressure less than or equal to 90 mmHg after treatment for 4 months. Both drugs induced a significant reduction in the total of number of complaints after 1 month of treatment. They did not differ from each other. The reduction was seen both in responders and non-responders and persisted during treatment for 6 months. It is concluded that in terms of short-term efficacy the cardioselective, hydrophilic beta adrenoceptor-blocking drug atenolol is preferable to hydrochlorothiazide in the treatment of uncomplicated hypertension.", 
    "54": "A controlled, double-blind, double-placebo, crossover clinical trial was carried out in 24 mild to moderate hypertensives of either sex to compare the anti-hypertensive and other effects of indapamide (2.5 mg) and pindolol (15 mg). After a 2-week run-in placebo period the patients were randomly assigned to one of the drugs in the study for 6 weeks. After a second 2-week placebo period, the subjects received the alternative drug for an additional 6 weeks. Both drugs produced a significant and similar decrease in arterial blood pressure (averaging 19 mmHg for systolic and 15 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure; p less than 0.05), with minimal differences between the drugs in this respect (p greater than 0.10). Pulse, rate, however, was significantly reduced (from 76 to 67 beats/min; p less than 0.05) only with pindolol. The laboratory data did not change appreciably, and few side-effects were reported. It is concluded that indapamide and pindolol at the dosage levels used are drugs of comparable antihypertensive activity.", 
    "55": "In order to clarify the effects of insulin on the cardiovascular system in patients with and without coronary heart disease (CHD), we studied the changes of electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure, pulse rate, along with those of blood glucose, free fatty acid, immunoreactive insulin, cortisol and potassium during insulin tolerance test (ITT). The presence or absence of CHD was verified by the coronary angiography and various stress testings beforehand. In patients with CHD, ischemic ST-T wave changes were recorded following the increment of double product after insulin injection and these changes were quite similar to those recorded during exercise test. In patients without CHD, although hypoglycemia and suppression of lipolysis were achieved, ischemic ST-T wave changes were not recorded after insulin injection. Furthermore, in a patient with Triple Vessel Disease, ischemic changes of ECG provoked by ITT were abolished completely by the administration of nifedipine and propranolol. ITT may induce ischemic changes of ECG in patients with CHD by different mechanisms from those of exercise tests and it may provide a useful tool for the diagnosis of CHD in clinical applications.", 
    "56": "The widespread acceptance of evidence that even mildly raised blood pressure is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity has led to the setting up of screening programmes and treatment trials for hypertension in several countries. In order to allay anxieties about adverse psychological consequences of their own treatment trial of mild to moderate hypertension in a population of 35-64 year old adults of both sexes, the Medical Research Council supported a special psychiatric study in the pilot phase of the trial. This case-controlled study demonstrated that there was no increase in psychiatric morbidity after diagnosis (labelling) of hypertension nor during one year on the trial. There was, in fact, a fall in such morbidity for trial entrants, related to a greater rate of improvement for those subjects who displayed morbidity and not to any alteration in the incidence of new morbidity. The improvement in psychological state was not associated with any of the antihypertensive drug regimes, nor was it an artefact of selection; rather it appeared to be a beneficial effect of regular clinic attendance. The results of this study are presented and discussed in the context of current research into the psychological aspects of hypertension.", 
    "57": "Betaxolol hydrochloride, 0.5%, and timolol maleate, 0.5%, were compared in a 26-week randomized, double-masked study involving 46 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma. The two drugs were comparable with regard to both intraocular pressure-lowering efficacy and side effects. Since betaxolol is a selective beta 1-adrenergic antagonist, it may be advantageous for patients in whom beta 2-blockade could be harmful.", 
    "58": "The use of routine calcium estimations has led to a marked increase in the number of cases of hyperparathyroidism diagnosed, especially in the elderly. The results of surgery in the elderly are reviewed, as are some studies on the natural history of untreated hyperparathyroidism, and on this basis it is recommended that in the asymptomatic elderly patient observation is the appropriate management.", 
    "59": "In 22 50-year-old men with long-standing, untreated essential hypertension of the low renin type, venous plasma vasopressin concentrations were about three times those of 15 matched normotensive control subjects (p less than 0.005). These patients also had increased arterial concentrations of noradrenaline and adrenaline (p less than 0.05) but there was no direct association between these two catecholamines and vasopressin. On the other hand, adrenergic beta-receptor blockade with oxprenolol reduced both blood pressure and plasma vasopressin (p less than 0.01) while venous plasma dopamine concentrations significantly increased. In addition, the hypertensives had highly significantly increased serum uric acid (p less than 0.001) that correlated positively with venous vasopressin concentrations (p less than 0.05). According to these data, patients with the volume-sustained low renin type of essential hypertension have increased plasma vasopressin concentrations that probably are inversely related to dopaminergic nervous activity. The data also indicate that increased plasma vasopressin correlates with serum uric acid, most probably through increased tubular reabsorption of this acid.", 
    "60": "Common migraine sufferers (25 males, 71 females) with a history of 2-6 attacks per month participated in a 4-centre trial comparing the prophylactic effect of timolol (10 mg b.i.d.) and propranolol (80 mg b.i.d.) to placebo. After a pretreatment period of 4 weeks they entered a double-blind 3-way cross-over trial with 3 treatment periods of 12 weeks each. 83 patients received all 3 treatments. The mean frequency of attacks per 28 days was 3.35 on timolol, 3.69 on propranolol and 4.83 on placebo. Mean severity of attacks (0-3) was 1.75 on timolol, 1.83 on propranolol, and 1.93 on placebo. Mean duration of attacks was 7.41 h on timolol, 7.38 on propranolol and 7.95 on placebo. The headache index (frequency times severity) was 5.71 on timolol, 6.66 on propranolol and 9.03 on placebo (P less than 0.05, P less than 0.01 compared to placebo). The difference between propranolol and timolol was non-significant: frequency of attacks 0.34 (95% confidence limits - 0.26; 0.89). Headache index 0.95 propranolol and 23 patients on placebo experienced side effects (P less than 0.05). It is concluded that timolol and propranolol are equally effective in the used doses (1:8) for common migraine prophylaxis.", 
    "61": "The cardiovascular risk of hypertension depends not only on blood pressure under resting conditions, but particularly on blood pressure increases induced by daily physical and emotional activity. Therefore, the ability of the beta 1-receptor antagonist acebutolol (400 mg/day) and of the alpha 1-receptor antagonist prazosin (4 mg/day) to reduce exercise-induced increases in blood pressure and pressure-rate product during and after standardized ergometric work (50-100 W) was compared in an intrapatient study including 20 outpatients with arterial hypertension (WHO stage 1-2) aged 29-55 years. Both drugs resulted in a significant reduction of systolic (p less than 0.01) and diastolic (p less than 0.001) blood pressure at rest. However, systolic blood pressure (p less than 0.001) and pressure-rate product (p less than 0.001) during exercise were only significantly reduced by acebutolol. The strongest blood pressure lowering effect under all conditions could be achieved by the combination of prazosin and acebutolol. From these findings it is concluded that: (1) beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking agents are the drugs of first choice in the baseline therapy of mild to moderate arterial hypertension, and (2) prazosin potentiates the antihypertensive effect of beta-blocking agents. This therapeutic regimen is recommended especially for hypertensives with ischemic heart disease, because prazosin fails to reduce pressure-rate product as a measure of myocardial O2-consumption.", 
    "62": "An open, randomized crossover trial was carried out in 10 patients with hypertension to compare the degree and duration of antihypertensive effect of metoprolol given as 100 mg ordinary tablets twice daily and as single daily doses of a 200 mg sustained-release tablet. Blood pressures and heart rate were measured, at rest and during maximum exercise effort, before treatment, at the second hour after the start of each treatment sequence, and at the end of both 14-day treatment periods: after 12 hours in the case of ordinary metoprolol and after 24 hours with sustained-release metoprolol. The results showed that heart rate was greatly reduced (less than 0.001) both at rest and on exercise at all times studied with both treatments. At rest, blood pressure was significantly reduced except by sustained-release metoprolol at 2 hours. On exercise, blood pressure was also significantly reduced except for the 12-hour value for diastolic pressure with ordinary metoprolol. It is concluded that, for similar reductions in heart rate reflecting satisfactory beta-receptor blockade, the antihypertensive effect of metoprolol given at a dosage of 200 mg per day was more rapid in onset after the ordinary tablet formulation but less marked at 12 hours than at 24 hours after the sustained-release formulation.", 
    "63": "Neuroendocrine responses to splanchnic nerve stimulation in bursts (at 40 Hz for 1 s at 10 s intervals for 10 min) have been investigated in conscious adrenalectomized calves, 3-6 weeks after birth, in the presence of various pharmacological blocking agents. Preganglionic blockade with hexamethonium abolished all the neuroendocrine responses that were monitored. Pre-treatment with phentolamine significantly reduced, but failed to eliminate, the release of both pancreatic glucagon and pancreatic polypeptide. In the presence of phentolamine splanchnic nerve stimulation produced a massive rise in arterial plasma insulin concentration. None of these pancreatic neuroendocrine responses was significantly affected by additional pre-treatment with propranolol. The rise in mean plasma insulin concentration which occurred in calves pre-treated with both phentolamine and propranolol was significantly reduced by atropine. Release of bombesin-like immunoreactivity (BLI) was unaffected by total post-ganglionic adrenergic and cholinergic blockade. The results indicate that pancreatic endocrine responses to splanchnic nerve stimulation may be attributable, at least in part, to release of BLI in this species.", 
    "64": "Seven asthmatic patients were studied in a single-blind randomized, crossover study after oral administration of 20 mg nifedipine or placebo. Four increasing doses of i.v. terbutaline were then given with 30 min interval. The study was concluded with inhalation of five terbutaline puffs. FEV1 measurements 30 min after intake of nifedipine did not show any difference compared to placebo. During the terbutaline treatment, however, there was a more pronounced bronchodilation after nifedipine than after placebo (P less than 0.05). Terbutaline-induced skeletal muscle tremor was similar after nifedipine and placebo pretreatments. After nifedipine intake there was a decrease of diastolic blood pressure and a reflexogenic tachycardia. Thus, this study showed a small potentiation of the beta 2-adrenoceptor mediated bronchodilation, which is of importance when treating patients with simultaneous asthma and hypertension or angina pectoris.", 
    "65": "Plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) levels were 9.6 pg/ml in the mineralocorticoid-deficient rats, a value significantly greater than 4.8 pg/ml in the glucocorticoid-deficient rats (P less than 0.05), and 1.6 pg/ml in controls (P less than 0.001). The AVP antagonist of the vascular effect of AVP, [1(beta-mercapto-beta, beta-cyclopentamethylenepropionic acid), 2-(O-methyl)tyrosine] AVP, [d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP] (5 micrograms/kg), decreased mean arterial pressure (MAP) from 76.5 to 71.6 mmHg (P less than 0.01) in mineralocorticoid-deficient rats on day 10 but not in glucocorticoid deficient rats on day 14 (113.2-111.6 mmHg, NS) or in control rats (109.7-110.2 mmHg, NS). Plasma renin activity was 40.7 ng X ml-1 X h-1 in mineralocorticoid-deficient rats and 7.2 in glucocorticoid-deficient rats (P less than 0.001). The angiotensin II antagonist, [Sar1-Gly8]angiotensin II (5 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1), decreased MAP from 69.3 to 53.2 mmHg in mineralocorticoid-deficient rats (P less than 0.001) but not in glucocorticoid-deficient rats. Plasma norepinephrine was 1,138 pg/ml in mineralocorticoid-deficient rats and 251 pg/ml in glucocorticoid-deficient rats (P less than 0.001). The alpha-adrenergic blocker, phenoxybenzamine (3 mg/kg), reduced MAP from 82 to 51 mmHg in mineralocorticoid deficient rats (P less than 0.005), a decrease in MAP greater (P less than 0.05) than that observed in glucocorticoid-deficient rats (107.7-84.8 mmHg, P less than 0.02). In addition, the AVP antagonist caused a greater and more prolonged reduction in MAP in mineralocorticoid-deficient rats after the administration of either the angiotensin II antagonist or alpha-blocker. These results indicate that AVP, norepinephrine, and angiotensin II are involved in maintaining blood pressure in the mineralocorticoid-deficient state."
