Twenty-five microliters of 0.65% timolol maleate solutions were instilled into the pigmented rabbit eye at 6 AM, 12 PM, 6 PM, or 12 AM. The time course of timolol concentration in plasma and various eye tissues (conjunctiva, sclera, corneal epithelium, corneal stroma, aqueous humor, iris-ciliary body, and lens) was monitored with the use of reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Ocular timolol concentrations were approximately twice as high when the drug was administered at 12 PM than at 6 AM, 6 PM, or 12 AM, whereas timolol concentration in plasma was lowest when the drug was administered at 12 PM. It may, therefore, be possible to maximize the therapeutic index of topically applied timolol by administering the drug at 12 PM. Moreover, the possible influence of dosing time on the extent of ocular and systemic drug absorption must be considered when planning dosing schedules for topically applied ophthalmic drugs.", 
    "1": "We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial to compare the impact of titrated doses of atenolol (50 to 100 mg once a day), enalapril (5 to 20 mg once a day), and diltiazem (sustained release) (60 to 180 mg twice a day) on blood pressure and quality of life in older hypertensive women. Two hundred forty-two patients were randomized. Dose titration was completed by week 4 after randomization, and the maintenance phase was completed at week 16. Diltiazem (sustained release) demonstrated greater diastolic blood pressure lowering at both weeks 8 and 16 by an intent-to-treat analysis. At week 16, diltiazem changed diastolic blood pressure -13.7 +/- 0.7 mm Hg compared with -10.8 +/- 1.1 mm Hg for atenolol, and -10.5 +/- 0.9 mm Hg for enalapril. Diltiazem also demonstrated greater lowering of systolic blood pressure at week 3, but these differences in systolic blood pressure had decreased by week 16. More patients were classified as treatment failures during the 16 weeks of the trial for atenolol (15%) than for diltiazem (2.5%), while the treatment failure rate was intermediate with enalapril (8%). Total rates of adverse events were equivalent across the three treatment arms. There were few significant differences in the impact of the three treatments on mean scores of quality-of-life measures at week 16. There was a trend for atenolol to have somewhat worse quality-of-life scores, but none of these differences were statistically significant. In conclusion, all three treatment regimens were effective in lowering diastolic blood pressure without significant differences in rates of adverse events or deleterious effects on quality of life.", 
    "2": "Load-dependent relaxation was studied in eight conscious dogs by inflating an intra-aortic balloon during late systole. Initially, the balloon was inflated at the aortic dicrotic notch and deflated before the next systole; subsequently, the inflation time was moved progressively earlier in 30-ms steps. This intervention produced an abrupt increment in left ventricular (LV) systolic pressure. The contraction duration was assessed by measuring the time required for LV pressure to fall by 50% of its maximum value (P50). The rate of LV pressure decline was assessed by measuring its peak negative first time derivative (-dP/dt) and the time constant of relaxation (tau). When the balloon was inflated during late systole (50 +/- 5 ms before aortic dicrotic notch), the time to peak -dP/dt fell, P50 fell, peak -dP/dt increased, and tau was unchanged. Thus the initial rate of LV pressure decline was accelerated, and the duration of the contraction was abbreviated. These data indicated that myocardial relaxation in the intact conscious dog is load dependent. Late systolic balloon inflations were performed after treatment with propranolol, verapamil, or caffeine. During propranolol and verapamil, the rate of LV relaxation (peak -dP/dt and tau) was slowed; however, the effects of balloon inflation on LV pressure transients were qualitatively similar to that seen in the baseline state. By contrast, caffeine prevented the abbreviation in the contraction duration caused by late-systolic balloon inflation. Thus LV relaxation remained load dependent when myocardial relaxation was slowed by propranolol or verapamil; load-dependent relaxation was attenuated by caffeine, presumably due to its influence on the sarcoplasmic reticulum.", 
    "3": "The circadian variation of total ischemic activity was examined during 3289 hours of ambulatory ECG monitoring in 101 patients with stable angina pectoris and proved coronary artery disease, who were not receiving any prophylactic antianginal therapy. The 101 patients displayed 411 episodes of ischemia, 312 (76%) of which were silent; a circadian rhythm was noted for the occurrence of total and silent ischemia. Thirty-eight percent of the ischemic episodes occurred between 6 AM and 12 noon, and total and silent ischemia were significantly more frequent during this period compared with the other three 6-hour periods (p less than 0.01); a lesser peak was noted in the evening. The effects of metoprolol and combined therapy with metoprolol and nifedipine on the circadian variation of ischemic activity were studied in two subgroups of patients in a random, double-blind study design (31 patients receiving metoprolol and 42 receiving combined therapy). During therapy with metoprolol the morning increase in ischemic activity was attenuated, and the highest frequency of ischemia was then noted in the evening (6 AM to 12 noon compared with 6 PM to 12 midnight; p less than 0.05). Combined therapy abolished the morning peak as did metoprolol monotherapy, but even the evening increase in ischemic activity was attenuated (p less than 0.05). The diurnal distribution of the mean heart rate at the onset of ischemia, when patients were off therapy, showed a morning increase similar to the increase in ischemic activity but no second peak in the evening.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "4": "The metabolism of propranolol by human skin and by several cell preparations has been investigated in vitro. The major metabolites produced by human skin in organ culture and by keratinocytes were N-desisopropylpropranolol (DIP), propranolol glycol (GLY), and naphthoxylactic acid (NLA). Formation of GLY and NLA was linear with incubation time up to 6 d and was directly proportional to propranolol concentration. Fibroblasts and melanocytes also produced GLY and NLA, but appeared to have lower propranolol-biotransforming activity than keratinocytes. The three metabolites detected arise from side-chain oxidation of propranolol, and the use of specific enzyme inhibitors determined that monoamine oxidase and cytochrome P450 isozymes are involved in their formation. Aldehyde and alcohol dehydrogenases are also probably involved in the formation of NLA and GLY, but attempts to inhibit these enzyme systems were inconclusive, possibly due to the chemical instability of the intermediate aldehyde resulting from monoamine oxidase activity. No evidence was found for conjugation or ring oxidation by the skin or isolated cells. Induction of keratinocyte differentiation with Ca++ or phorbol ester treatment resulted in an increase of overall biotransformation and the NLA/GLY ratio.", 
    "5": "To determine the effects of acetylcholine on the coronary bed in the baboon and whether the effects preceded or followed the action of acetylcholine on ventricular function, eight adult baboons (Papio anubis) were instrumented to measure left ventricular (LV) and mean arterial pressures, LV dP/dt, regional myocardial function, and coronary blood flow. Acetylcholine was injected locally through a catheter positioned in the coronary artery ostium using fluoroscopic guidance in intact sedated baboons. With heart rate held constant, intracoronary acetylcholine (0.5 micrograms/kg) reduced coronary blood flow by 82 +/- 4% from a baseline value of 34 +/- 4 ml/min without a significant change in mean arterial pressure and with a reduction in LV dP/dt of only 12 +/- 3%. The decrease in coronary blood flow occurred before either LV dP/dt or regional myocardial function fell in the region of the heart receiving acetylcholine. After the intense coronary constriction, a later phase characterized by dilation was observed. The changes in coronary blood flow with acetylcholine were unaffected by combined alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockades but were abolished by muscarinic blockade. Low doses of acetylcholine elicited only coronary vasodilation. All doses of acetylcholine, administered directly into the iliac artery, also elicited only iliac vasodilation. Intracoronary acetylcholine in conscious dogs also induced only coronary vasodilation, whereas in conscious calves at higher doses, initial vasoconstrictor responses were observed, which also preceded reductions in regional myocardial function. These results suggest that the controversy surrounding the effects of acetylcholine can be reconciled on the basis of species, vascular bed studied, and dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "6": "The influence of endothelin 1 on intracellular Ca2+ transients and isometric contractions was investigated in ferret papillary muscles loaded with the Ca(2+)-regulated bioluminescent indicator aequorin. In concentrations of 3 x 10(-9) to 1 x 10(-7) M, endothelin produced dose-dependent increases in the amplitudes of both aequorin light signals (maximum, 31 +/- 12%) and developed tension (maximum, 64 +/- 13%). The peak aequorin light [( Ca2+]i)-peak tension curve generated by increasing endothelin concentrations was steeper and shifted to the left of the curve generated by varying [Ca2+]o; however, the maximum developed tension produced by endothelin did not exceed that produced by 6 mM [Ca2+]o. The effect of endothelin on the amplitude of the aequorin light signal was less than the effect of [Ca2+]o for similar levels of tension development. Moreover, 1 x 10(-7) M endothelin caused an upward shift in the peak aequorin light-peak tension curve generated by varying [Ca2+]o and increased the maximum twitch force by about 12%. The contractions were prolonged, whereas the time course of the Ca2+ transient was not changed in the presence of endothelin. When the function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum was inhibited by 6 microM ryanodine, 10(-7) M endothelin still increased the force generation without increasing the intracellular peak Ca2+, either during isometric twitches or during tetani.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "7": "Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed during a head-up tilt test in 11 control subjects (group I) and 18 patients with recurrent unexplained syncope. In four patients (group II), the head-up tilt test was negative at baseline and after isoproterenol infusion. Syncope was induced during baseline head-up tilt in nine patients (group III) and after isoproterenol challenge in five (group IV). The echocardiographic variables assessed were left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic areas and percent fractional shortening. At the end of head-up tilt, end-systolic area decreased by 4.5 +/- 1.3 and 3.0 +/- 1.2 cm2 in groups III and IV, respectively, compared with 0.5 +/- 0.7 and 0.2 +/- 0.1 cm2 in groups I and II, respectively (p less than 0.04). Similarly, end-diastolic area decreased by 5.5 +/- 2.6 cm2 in group III compared with 2.7 +/- 1.9 and 1.75 +/- 0.4 cm2 in group I and II, respectively (p less than 0.04). Additionally, at the end of the baseline study, fractional shortening was significantly greater in group III and group IV (43 +/- 5%) than in groups I and II (p less than 0.01). In conclusion, syncope induced by head-up tilt is associated with vigorous myocardial contraction and a significant decrease in left ventricular end-systolic dimensions. This left ventricular hypercontractility may play an important role in the pathogenesis of syncope induced by head-up tilt.", 
    "8": "Anti-idiotypic antibodies were generated by immunizing rabbits with affinity-purified antibodies to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT). Anti-5-HT activity was removed from the resulting antisera by chromatography through a 5-HT affinity column. The anti-idiotypic antibodies were demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to bind to affinity-purified whole anti-5-HT antibodies and their Fab fragments. Anti-idiotypic antibodies, purified by affinity chromatography on columns to which antibodies to 5-HT were coupled, competed with 5-HT (covalently bound to protein) for the binding sites on anti-5-HT antibodies and serotonin binding protein. The anti-idiotypic antibodies antagonized the binding of [3H]5-HT to membranes isolated from the cerebral cortex, striatum, and raphe area more than to membranes from hippocampus or cerebellum. The anti-idiotypic antibodies also blocked the binding of the 5-HT1B-selective ligand (-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol (in the presence of 30 microM isoproterenol) to cortical membranes. In contrast, anti-idiotypic antibodies failed to inhibit binding of the 5-HT1A-selective ligand 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-[3H]propylamino)-tetralin [( 3H]8-OH-DPAT) to raphe area membranes or hippocampal membranes. These observations suggested that the anti-idiotypic antibodies may recognize some 5-HT receptor subtypes but not others. This hypothesis was tested by ascertaining the ability of anti-idiotypic antibodies to immunostain cells transfected in vitro with cDNA encoding the 5-HT1C or 5-HT2 receptor or with a genomic clone encoding the 5-HT1A receptor. Punctate sites of immunofluorescence were found on the surfaces of fibroblasts that expressed 5-HT1C and 5-HT2 receptors, but not on the surfaces of HeLa cells that expressed 5-HT1A receptors. Immunostaining of cells by the anti-idiotypic antibodies was inhibited by appropriate pharmacological agents: immunostaining of cells expressing 5-HT1C receptors was blocked by mesulergine (but not ketanserin, 8-OH-DPAT, or spiperone), whereas that of cells expressing 5-HT2 receptors was blocked by ketanserin or spiperone (but not mesulergine or 8-OH-DPAT). The anti-idiotypic antibodies failed to inhibit the uptake of [3H]5-HT by serotonergic neurons. It is concluded that the anti-idiotypic antibodies generated with anti-5-HT serum recognize the 5-HT1B, 5-HT1C, and 5-HT2 receptor subtypes; however, neither 5-HT1A receptors nor 5-HT uptake sites appear to react with these antibodies.", 
    "9": "Two vasodilating beta-blockers, dilevalol and pindolol, were studied for their effects on the development of hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Dilevalol has agonist activity at beta 2-, whereas pindolol interacts with both beta 1- and beta 2-receptor subtypes. Groups of 7-week old spontaneously hypertensive rats were given dilevalol (30 mg/kg) or pindolol (3 mg/kg) in the drinking water for 3 months. A control group of spontaneously hypertensive rats and age-matched normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats were also used. Systolic blood pressure and heart rate were recorded weekly. Cardiac structural changes were determined by morphometric analysis. Control spontaneously hypertensive rats developed hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy as compared with normotensive rats. Dilevalol and pindolol prevented the rise in blood pressure, but only dilevalol lowered heart rate. However, neither of the compounds prevented the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, but they differently influenced myocardial structure as measured by the volume fraction of fibrotic tissue in the left ventricle. Dilevalol markedly prevented the amount of fibrosis to a level comparable to that found in normotensive rats, whereas pindolol had a weaker effect. The data suggest that individual pharmacologic characteristics, such as partial agonist activity of each beta-blocker examined, may account for differential effects on the myocardial structure.", 
    "10": "Hemodynamic Effects of Isradipine and Nifedipine in Hypertension Myocardial wall tension is an important determinant of the oxygen demand, the function and the degree of hypertrophy of the left ventricle. Myocardial wall tension should be influenced more favourably by a non-cardiodepressive antihypertensive than by a potentially cardiodepressive one. Therefore, we investigated the effects of an intravenous infusion of the calcium antagonists isradipine (I; 0.4 mg; 3,5-pyridinecarboxylic acid, 4-[benzofurazanyl]-1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-,methyl-ethylester+ ++ [9CI]; CAS75695-93-1) and nifedipine (N; 2.0 mg) resp., on hemodynamics and myocardial wall tension in 12 hypertensives by an intraindividual comparison. The adrenergic reflex activation induced by vasodilation was limited by pre-medication with 0.1 mg propranolol/kg body weight (i.v.) before application of I and N. Baseline blood pressure of the patients and its changes in response to both calcium antagonists were statistically comparable, as were the left ventricular end-diastolic volumes. The end-systolic volumes, however, decreased significantly on I but not on N: before I: 69 +/- 7.0 (mean +/- standard error), after I: 61 +/- 6.1 ml, 2p less than 0,001; before N: 62 +/- 6.1, after N: 64 +/- 7.0 ml, n.s.

    "11": "To determine the efficacy of and clinical response to several pharmacologic agents for treatment of idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in cats, 17 symptomatic cats were randomized to treatment with either propranolol, diltiazem, or verapamil. Clinical, laboratory, radiographic, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic data were obtained before treatment and after 3 and 6 months of chronic oral therapy. Too few of the cats receiving propranolol or verapamil survived long enough to obtain long-term data needed to make statistical comparisons between groups. However, all 12 cats ultimately treated with diltiazem became asymptomatic, and no adverse effects from this drug were noted in any of these cats. Treatment with diltiazem was associated with a significant reduction of pulmonary congestion assessed radiographically (P less than 0.01), and improved ventricular filling based on echocardiographic measurements of left atrial size (P less than 0.05), left ventricular internal diastolic dimension (P less than 0.05), and relaxation time index (P less than 0.001). There was also a drug-related improvement in jugular venous oxygen tension (P less than 0.001) and blood lactate concentration (P less than 0.01) suggesting improved peripheral perfusion in the cats receiving diltiazem. The results indicate that diltiazem provides an effective and apparently safe treatment for the management of feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.",

The number of ischemic episodes decreased from 445 (409 silent) to 149 (140 silent) (p less than 0.001), and mean duration of silent and symptomatic ischemia per patient decreased from 5.9 +/- 3.3 minutes to 2.4 +/- 2.6 minutes (p less than 0.001) and 4.1 +/- 5.5 minutes to 1.4 +/- 2.8 minutes (p less than 0.001) respectively. Intensive medical therapy is effective in ameliorating SMI in patients with unstable angina.", 
    "13": "The cardiovascular effects of oxodipine, a new dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, were studied after i.v. administration to chloralose-anesthetized dogs, and compared with those of nitrendipine. Nitrendipine produced more marked decreases than oxodipine in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and in total peripheral resistance. No significant modification of heart rate was observed. Oxodipine decreased cardiac contractility, whereas nitrendipine increased it. This difference originated in reflex modifications, since both drugs, administered at doses of 30 and 60 micrograms/kg, decreased cardiac contractility during studies performed after cardiac autonomic blockade. Under these conditions, nitrendipine decreased heart rate, whereas oxodipine had no effect. The two drugs showed comparable effects on coronary and femoral vascular resistance. However, oxodipine caused a very marked persistent decrease of vertebral vascular resistance. On this local circulation, nitrendipine had a weak effect. The results from the present study indicate that oxodipine predominantly increases vertebral blood flow with a concomitant hypertension which is more moderate than after nitrendipine.",

By using modern ultrasound and rheographic techniques, the degree and the relationship of portal and pulmonary hypertensions in patients with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis of the liver are evaluated, the criteria of their early diagnosis are characterized. There was shown a positive action on the renal blood flow of nitrosorbide, an improvement of the pulmonary hemodynamics in patients with diseases of the liver against the background of corinfar exerting no influence on the hepatic blood flow. Obsidan induced a significant decrease of both portal and pulmonary hypertensions, normalization of the total hemodynamics thereby producing the greatest positive effect.", 
    "15": "A convenient high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) assay was developed for determination of sotalol (STL) enantiomers in plasma. Following addition of the internal standard (IS; racemic atenolol), enantiomers of STL and IS were extracted using ethyl acetate. After evaporation of the organic layer, samples were derivatized with a solution of S-(+)-1-(1-naphthyl)ethyl isocyanate (NEIC). The resulting diastereomers were chromatographed with normal-phase HPLC with chloroform:hexane:methanol [65:33:2 (v/v)] as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The fluorescence detection wavelength was set at 220 nm for excitation with no emission filter. The suitability of the assay for pharmacokinetic studies was determined by measuring STL enantiomers in the plasma of a healthy subject after administration of a single 160-mg oral, racemic dose of STL.", 
    "16": "The objective of this study was to compare the influence of pH, tonicity, benzalkonium chloride, and EDTA on the conjunctival and corneal penetration of four beta blockers--atenolol, timolol, levobunolol, and betaxolol. Drug penetration was evaluated using the isolated pigmented rabbit conjunctiva and cornea in the modified Ussing chamber. The conjunctiva was more permeable than the cornea to all four beta blockers. Formulation changes caused larger changes in corneal than in conjunctival drug penetration, especially for the hydrophilic beta blockers, atenolol and timolol. Raising the solution pH to 8.4 caused the largest increase in corneal penetration for all drugs except atenolol. This increase was greater than that obtained by removing the corneal epithelium. The same formulation also increased conjunctival drug penetration, although to a lesser extent. In the case of timolol, the formulation changes evaluated brought about similar changes in its ocular and systemic absorption with good in vitro-in vivo correlations. The above findings indicate that in making formulation changes to maximize corneal drug penetration, it is necessary to evaluate possible changes in conjunctival drug penetration, hence systemic absorption. Moreover, because the conjunctiva plays an active role in the noncorneal route of ocular drug absorption, the relative contribution of the noncorneal to the corneal routes to ocular drug absorption may also be altered by formulation changes.", 
    "17": "Ouabain (1.0 x 10(-6) M) produced a uniform, consistent and reproducible arrhythmia on paced guinea pig left atrium bathed in Ringer-Locke solution. A second spell of arrhythmia of similar intensity and pattern, which had the same latency to onset, was reproduced 60 min after the first spell of arrhythmia. Lignocaine (3.46 x 10(-5) M) and propranolol (1.69 x 10(-5) M) gave full protection against the second spell of arrhythmia, whereas lower doses of these drugs were able to delay the onset and reduce the duration. Clonidine (3.75 x 10(-5) M), however, was found to be ineffective. This model can be used for the detection and assessment of directly acting antiarrhythmics in very low concentrations, since this is a sensitive and reliable method.", 
    "18": "1. The interactions between the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist nisoldipine and two beta-adrenoceptor blocker drugs (atenolol and propranolol) were investigated in two groups of healthy normotensive subjects. 2. The steady state plasma concentrations of both beta-adrenoceptor blockers were significantly altered by the addition of nisoldipine: for propranolol there were significant increases in Cmax, by about 50%, and in AUC by about 30% and for atenolol there was a significant increase in Cmax, by about 20%. 3. The addition of nisoldipine was also associated with significant changes in apparent liver blood flow (measured by indocyanine green clearance) from 1.4 to 2.4 l min-1 in the atenolol group and from 1.3 to 2.3 l min-1 in the propranolol group. 4. Both nisoldipine-beta-adrenoceptor blocker combinations were associated with small enhanced blood pressure reductions e.g. from 104/60 with atenolol alone to 98/50 mm Hg with the combination but there was no alteration to the extent of beta-adrenoceptor blockade (as assessed by bicycle ergometry). 5. This pharmacodynamic profile in healthy normotensives is consistent with the known therapeutic efficacy of such combination treatments in patients with hypertension and angina. 6. It is suggested that there is a pharmacokinetic component to the efficacy of this type of combination, perhaps reflecting vasodilator-induced changes in drug absorption and/or hepatic extraction.",

Measures of memory, information processing ability, mood states and trait anxiety were estimated in a double-blind, double-dummy, randomised cross-over trial which compared the effects of atenolol (50 or 100 mg once daily) and captopril (25 or 50 mg twice daily), each taken for 6 weeks. Eighteen patients with mild to moderately severe hypertension were included. 2. There were no significant differences in systolic or diastolic blood pressure reduction between the two drugs. Pulse rate was slower after atenolol treatment (P less than 0.05). 3. Patients undertook practice on the psychological test battery prior to the treatment phases of the study in order to minimise practice effects. 4. There were no significant differences between the treatments on any of the measures of memory or information processing. 5. Patients reported feeling less anxious during treatment with atenolol (P = 0.02). 6. There were no differences between the drugs in their cognitive effects. The present study has the advantages of using an extensive battery of standard tests in a group of well-practised patients. The decreased anxiety reported with atenolol treatment may have clinical value and probably reflects the well-known effect of beta-adrenoceptor antagonist drugs on the somatic symptoms of situational anxiety.", 
    "20": "We herein describe a family with thyroid hormone resistance. Thyroid hormones and basal TSH were elevated. Pituitary tumor or abnormality in thyroid hormone binding proteins were ruled out by appropriate tests. Mother and sister of the propositus presented similar abnormal hormonal features but no hyperthyroidism. Initially the patient was treated with carbimazole (30 mg/day): three months later a dramatic increase in the size of the thyroid gland and in TSH levels (12.5 to 28 mU/l) were noted. Thereafter, dextrothyroxine (D-T4) and 3, 5, 3'-triiodothyroacetic acid (TRIAC) were given consecutively and treatment was accompanied by a decrease of TSH levels (2 mU/l) but thyroid hormone remained elevated. The symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism improved with the addition of propranolol (30-60 mg/day). In conclusion, the present report describes a new family with the syndrome of THR and variable degrees of involvement among relatives. We suggest the usefulness of TRIAC therapy to decrease TSH levels and propranolol to improve thyrotoxicosis due to pituitary resistance to thyroid hormone.", 
    "21": "We investigated the effects of early chronic administration of propranolol on systemic and splanchnic hemodynamic changes, and the development of portal-systemic shunts in conscious, unrestrained, portal vein stenosed rats. Compared to rats receiving placebo, early chronic propranolol (75 mg kg-1 day-1) administration to rats begun 3 days before portal vein stenosis and then continued for 10 consecutive days, resulted in a significant decrease in both portal pressure (11.8 +/- 1.5 mmHg) and portal-systemic shunts (48 +/- 18%) which were measured 2 to 3 h after the final dose of propranolol (15.2 +/- 1.5 mmHg and 84 +/- 5%, respectively). These beneficial effects were also observed 18 to 24 h after the final dose of chronic propranolol. In rats given propranolol continuously for 5 days starting 5 days after portal vein stenosis, portal pressure (11.8 +/- 1.2 mmHg) was significantly lower than in the placebo group but portal-systemic shunts (76 +/- 14%) were not significantly different. In rats receiving a single dose of propranolol (75 mg/kg) 10 days after portal vein stenosis and measured 2 to 3 h after propranolol administration, portal pressure (12.8 +/- 1.0 mmHg) was significantly lower than in the placebo group. Portal-systemic shunts (72 +/- 17%), however, showed no significant difference from the placebo group.

    "22": "In the present study, we compared cirrhotic patients who had a decrease in the hepatic venous pressure gradient after propranolol intake to patients without a decrease. Twenty patients with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices were investigated during hepatic vein catheterization before and 90 min after an oral dose of 80 mg propranolol. The hepatic venous pressure gradient decreased by 12.6% (19.0 +/- 4.7 to 16.3 +/- 3.6 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). Eight (40%) out of 20 patients had a decrease of less than 10% in protal pressure (non-responders). Responders had a higher baseline cardiac index than non-responders (3.79 +/- 0.74 vs. 2.83 +/- 0.53 1.min-1.m-2; p less than 0.01). No difference in the effect of propranolol on portal pressure was observed between patients with or without ascites, or between Child-Turcotte A, B, and C class patients. Our results suggest that cirrhotic patients who respond to oral propranolol with a decrease in portal pressure are more hyperdynamic than those without a significant fall in portal pressure.", 
    "23": "The effect of one beta-adrenoceptor agonist and one antagonist on preganglionic nerve stimulation (PNS)-evoked increase of plasma neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity (NPY-LI) was studied in the pithed guinea pig, both in the presence and in the absence of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine. Four periods of PNS (8 Hz for 30 s with 20 min intervals) were applied and the increases of mean arterial blood pressure (delta BP), heart rate (delta HR) and plasma NPY-LI (delta NPY-LI) were analysed. Infusion of the non-selective beta-agonist isoprenaline (0.15 micrograms x kg-1 x min-1 i.v.) tended to reduce delta BP in response to PNS and significantly increased HR at baseline without changing the maximal HR response. Pretreatment with yohimbine (1 mg x kg-1 i.v.) significantly increased delta BP in response to PNS by about 20% without any change in basal HR being observed. The non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (5 mg x kg-1 i.v.) significantly reduced delta BP and delta HR both in the presence and in the absence of yohimbine. Isoprenaline infusion enhanced plasma delta NPY-LI by 37% in comparison with the corresponding control. This effect of isoprenaline appeared to be slow in onset and could be blocked by propranolol, which per se did not significantly change plasma delta NPY-LI. Pretreatment with yohimbine caused a three to four-fold increase in plasma delta NPY-LI, which was slightly reduced both in the presence of isoprenaline (-39%) and propranolol (-27%). In conclusion, the sympathetic neurotransmission, also with regard to neuronal NPY, seems to have two adrenergic control mechanisms: one inhibitory and one facilitatory mediated by presynaptic alpha 2- and beta-adrenoceptors, respectively. The facilitatory control mechanism could not be demonstrated if the release of neuronal NPY was already greatly enhanced by alpha 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "24": "The effect of beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol) on exercise performance was studied in 15 patients (12 men and 3 women, mean age 70 years) with complete heart block treated with a ventricular-inhibited pacemaker (VVI). In a double-blind procedure, the patients were randomly given either 0.1 mg/kg of propranolol or saline solution i.v. before a first exercise test and vice versa before a second test. The interval between the tests was 24 hours. Nine patients were in sinus rhythm, 4 patients had atrial flutter, and 2 others had atrial fibrillation. The exercise capacity was on an average 11% lower with propranolol than with placebo (p less than 0.001). The most marked reductions (20 and 33%) were found in the two patients with atrial fibrillation. The atrial rate in patients with sinus rhythm was significantly lower with propranolol than placebo both at rest (68 vs. 83 beats/min, p less than 0.001) and at maximal work load (91 vs. 141 beats/min, p less than 0.001). The present findings show that beta blockade has negative effects on exercise capacity in patients with complete heart block treated with VVI pacemakers. This finding should be considered in the selection of drug treatment in patients with fixed rate pacing and concomitant hypertension and/or ischemic heart disease.", 
    "25": "The efficacy of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol in the acute treatment of patients in attacks of either classical (migraine with aura) or common migraine (migraine without aura) headache was assessed in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial with fixed doses. The trial was carried out on 25 patients. The treatment period was set at eight weeks, with the provision of shortening or lengthening it if necessary with a maximum period of seventeen weeks. A minimum of three migraine attacks were treated during each treatment period. Patients were assessed according to: the mean duration and mean severity per treatment period of migraine attacks. The secondary efficacy assessment was made on the basis of the percentage of attacks requiring escape medication per treatment period. The study, based on the t-distribution statistical model with a confidence level of 95%, showed that propranolol had no significant effect in aborting acute attacks of migraine when compared with placebo.", 
    "26": "Experiments were conducted on dogs to study the effect of heparin, obsidan, and rheogluman on the rate of lymph flow from the thoracic duct and the lymph coagulation potential in acute myocardial infarction. Rheoglumin produced the most marked lymph stimulating effect. The effect of heparin and partly that of rheogluman on lymph coagulability is mediated.", 
    "27": "This is a double-blind, randomized parallel-group multicenter study comprising 340 hypertensive patients. All were treated with 50 mg of atenolol once daily. If their recumbent diastolic blood pressure was greater than or equal to 95 and less than or equal to 115 mm Hg after a 4-week open run-in period, patients were randomized to receive additionally, 5, 10, or 20 mg of lisinopril once daily or placebo for a further 8-week period in a double-blind fashion. The additional effects on the trough (24-28 h after tablet intake) diastolic blood pressure of placebo and 5 mg of lisinopril were not statistically significant. Lisinopril at 10 and 20 mg reduced the recumbent diastolic blood pressure by 3.2 and 3.3 mm Hg, respectively, more than placebo (p = 0.010-0.011). The recumbent systolic blood pressure and heart rate did not change. The side effect profile of lisinopril was not different from that of placebo and adverse effects were few and mild.", 
    "28": "Bromocriptine, a dopamine (DA) receptor agonist, has been reported to have hypotensive effects in anesthetized and conscious normotensive rats but its mechanism of action is still not fully understood. Therefore, we studied the changes in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) elicited by an intravenous (i.v.) administration of bromocriptine (150 micrograms/kg), in either pentobarbital-anesthetized or conscious normotensive rats, pretreated with either i.v. (0.3 mg/kg) or intrathecal (i.t.) (93 nmol) domperidone, a DA receptor antagonist that does not cross the blood-brain barrier. In these preparations, i.v. administration of bromocriptine elicited dose-dependent decreases in MAP and rises in HR. The hypotensive effect was antagonized partially by i.t. and fully by i.v. domperidone. However, the latter compound did not modify the tachycardia, which could be blocked by propranolol (0.5 mg/kg i.v.). In rats pretreated with the latter beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, bromocriptine produced only a decrease in blood pressure that was inhibited by i.v. and i.t. domperidone. These results suggest that, in anesthetized and conscious normotensive rats, the hypotension induced by systemic administration of bromocriptine is fully mediated by DA2 dopamine receptors, which are located partly within the spinal cord and partly in the peripheral circulation.", 
    "29": "Rabbits were trained to accept a standardized feeding regime. Under anaesthesia both parotid ducts were cannulated in a retrograde direction and saliva was subsequently collected in feeding sessions involving pellets and carrots before and after the administration of propranolol. Salivary total protein and amylase concentrations were assayed and protein analysed by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Propranolol produced a reduction in protein secretion but not fluid secretion, indicating that protein secretion is partly under beta-adrenergic control. A transient increase in protein secretion was seen 8 h after the administration of propranolol and suggested the existence of different neural mechanisms involved in protein secretion compared to synthesis. Protein output (with high fluid secretion) during feeding on pellets was higher than on carrots (with high protein concentration) and suggested a significant role of the parasympathetic nervous system. The pattern of protein secretion as seen by SDS-PAGE was similar in individual rabbits and remained largely unchanged with the different foods and in the presence of propranolol.", 
    "30": "Atenolol is a selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist with a duration of activity of at least 24 hours. The scope of therapeutic use of the drug has been expanded and become better defined since it was first reviewed in the Journal in 1979. Atenolol is effective and generally well tolerated in patients with all grades of hypertension. Data from comparative studies show that when administered orally, atenolol reduces blood pressure to a similar extent, and in a similar proportion of patients, as usual therapeutic doses of other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (such as acebutolol, celiprolol, betaxolol, indenolol, metoprolol, nadolol, pindolol, propranolol, tertatolol), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (e.g. captopril, enalapril and lisinopril), calcium antagonists (e.g. amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, isradipine, nitrendipine, nifedipine, verapamil), doxazosin, ketanserin and alpha-methyldopa. Atenolol effectively lowers blood pressure in elderly patients with hypertension and in women with hypertension associated with pregnancy, and improves objective and subjective indices in patients with stable angina pectoris. Oral atenolol is used for preventing recurrence of supraventricular arrhythmias once control is achieved by intravenous administration of atenolol. Early intervention with intravenous atenolol followed by oral maintenance therapy reduces infarct recurrence and cardiovascular mortality in patients with known or suspected myocardial infarction. There is also encouraging evidence of reduced mortality from cardiovascular disease during long term therapy with atenolol in patients with hypertension. Atenolol is well tolerated in most patients. Increases in plasma levels of both total triglycerides and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides have accompanied atenolol therapy although the clinical relevance, if any, of longer term metabolic effects has yet to be determined. Its low lipid solubility and limited brain penetration results in a lower incidence of central nervous system effects than that associated with propranolol. After many years of clinical usage atenolol is a well established treatment option in several areas of cardiovascular medicine such as mild to moderate hypertension and stable angina pectoris. Furthermore, it has also shown potential in the treatment of some cardiac arrhythmias and has been associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality in patients with hypertension and in patients with myocardial infarction.", 
    "31": "Catecholamine-induced beating and myocardial hypertrophy were evaluated in isolated adult feline cardiomyocytes maintained in culture for up to 30 days. Adult feline cardiomyocytes were used in this study because they displayed several unique characteristics that facilitated assessment of factors regulating cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro. These characteristics included the following. 1) A single heart provides a high yield of 20-40 x 10(6) calcium-tolerant rod-shaped myocytes. 2) In culture, isolated adult feline cardiomyocytes maintain a stable population of differentiated myocytes that could be maintained without the dramatic loss of cell number, DNA content, or cell structure seen in adult rat cardiomyocyte cultures. 3) Cultured feline cardiomyocytes remained quiescent in culture unless appropriately stimulated to begin beating. 4) Sustained regular beating activity could be readily initiated up to 3 wk in culture by addition of 1 x 10(-5) M isoproterenol, other beta-adrenergic agonists, or agents known to elevate adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate. Beating could be maintained indefinitely in the presence of isoproterenol, but ceased upon removal of isoproterenol from the medium. Initiation of beating in 7-day-old cultures resulted in a profound restructuring of cardiomyocyte morphology compared with quiescent cultures. Beating heart cells were 66% larger with increased protein content, and they had significantly greater development of striated myofibrillar structure than quiescent myocytes at the same age in culture. We conclude that maintenance of an organized myofibrillar structure in cultured adult cardiac myocytes requires activation of intrinsic beating. Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy also develops following beta-adrenergic activation of beating, but it is unclear whether beating per se is required for inducing hypertrophy in isolated adult cardiomyocytes in vitro.", 
    "32": "The calcium entry blocking, beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking and hypotensive effects of YM-16151-4 were studied in pithed rats and in conscious normotensive rats. In pithed rats, intravenous injection of YM-16151-4 inhibited a YC-170-induced pressor response and an isoproterenol-induced positive chronotropic response with DR10 values of 4.20 and 0.31 mg/kg, respectively. Similarly, a single oral dose of YM-16151-4 inhibited YC-170 and isoproterenol-induced responses with DR10 values of 109.94 and 9.14 mg/kg, respectively. On the other hand, both intravenous and single oral doses of YM-16151-4 produced a dose-dependent hypotensive effect with no increase in heart rate in conscious normotensive rats. The onset of this effect was slow but long-lasting. During repeated oral administration of YM-16151-4 (30 mg/kg) for 5 days, the hypotensive effect of the compound did not change, indicating that this effect did not increase and tolerance did not develop. The time course of the calcium entry blocking activity of YM-16151-4 was very similar to that of its beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking activity, suggesting that the activities of calcium antagonism and beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade of the compound were almost constant at any time after oral dosing. We conclude that YM-16151-4 combines calcium entry and beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking activities in vivo, and produces a hypotensive effect without an increase in heart rate.", 
    "33": "At first N-nitrosoderivatives from six beta-adrenergic antagonists of large consumption were prepared. Secondly the standard nitrosation reactions recommended by WHO were performed to get information about their possible in vivo production and the yields of N-nitrosoderivatives were evaluated by HPLC analyses. Pharmacological tests confirm the potential risk to man of the N-nitrosoderivatives studied.", 
    "34": "The influence of i.v. infusion of adrenaline on the lymph flow and arterial pressure was studied in acute experiments on dogs with experimental renovascular hypertension. A reflex increase of the lymph flow by 268% above the initial level was revealed, as well as more obvious alterations in the arterial pressure, decrease of latencies and increase of the response duration in hypertensive dogs as compared with normotensive ones. After infusion of adrenaline together with obsydan we observed the lymph flow to be 2-fold enhanced. Pyrroxan has abolished the effect of adrenaline on alterations in the lymph flow and arterial pressure. Increase of adrenoreactivity of the lymphatic system under hypertension is caused mainly by alpha-adrenoreceptor activation.", 
    "35": "The paper reviews literature data available and first-hand experience in relation to hemodynamics of portal blood flow, lesser and greater circulation in patients with chronic diffuse hepatic diseases. Relevance of circulatory changes to hepatic lesions is also considered. With regard to specific features of hemodynamic disturbances in hepatic lesions it is suggested to use cardiovascular drugs. A pharmacodynamic effect is compared for beta-adrenoblockers, calcium antagonists and nitrates administered to patients with affected hepatobiliary system.", 
    "36": "Heart rate responses to feeding of both loose-housed and tethered sows, some of which engaged in persistent behavioral stereotypies, were recorded telemetrically in order to determine if stereotypic behavior occurs in response to, and serves to reduce increased sympathetic nervous activity. Heart rates rose in response to feeding (after which stereotypic behavior is most common) and this was greater for tethered sows. This response was partly blocked by a beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist (carazolol), but not by naloxone, although the latter tended to lead to overall increases in heart rate. Thus long-term tethering of sows leads to greater sympathetic nervous responses to feeding. No consistent relationships were found between heart rate and the performance of stereotypic behavior. In Experiment 1, using sows tethered for 6-8 months, neither basal heart rates nor heart rates following naloxone or carazolol differed between high- and low-stereotyping sows. In Experiment 2, using sows tethered for 1-2 months, high-stereotyping sows had lower basal heart rates than low-stereotyping sows. Marked reductions in heart rate caused by a beta-adrenoreceptor blocker did not lead to any change in stereotypic behavior, and preventing stereotypic behavior led to a reduction not an increase in heart rates. The results suggest that stereotypies are performed in situations where heart rate is high, but they provide no evidence that stereotypies reduce this heart rate.", 
    "37": "Toxic effects of drugs and their metabolism may be caused by covalent binding to cellular macromolecules. After oral application of the tritiated beta-blocker B 24/76 to male Wistar rats only the liver showed a significant irreversible binding to tissue proteins, with 11% of the radioactivity distributed in this organ. A covalent binding to collagen was found in liver, lung and muscle. The highest part was measured in the lung with 7% of the radioactivity distributed in this organ.", 
    "38": "Conscious rats were given i. p. polyethylene glycol (PEG) or dextran injections to compare their efficacy in inducing moderate hypovolaemia. Dextran was found unsuitable, producing large variability in the plasma vasopressin (AVP) concentrations. Putative neurotransmitters involved in the AVP response to hypovolaemia and in basal release were examined using opioid, and beta-adrenoceptor and dopamine receptor-blocking agents. A dose of PEG was chosen to produce a decrease in blood volume of approx 14.5% giving plasma AVP concentrations of 19.0 +/- 4.6 pmol/l. Naloxone and phenoxybenzamine failed to influence AVP release under both hypovolaemic and basal conditions. Prazosin also failed to influence the AVP response. In contrast propranolol elevated the plasma AVP concentrations in both conditions. Haloperidol enhanced basal AVP release but did not influence release during hypovolaemia. Guanethidine pretreatment partially blocked the response to hypovolaemia, but did not affect basal plasma AVP. Thus it appears that aminergic pathways have an inhibitory influence on AVP release under hypovolaemic and basal conditions. However, endogenous opioids do not appear to contribute significantly to the hypovolaemic response.", 
    "39": "The relationship between levels of potassium in the serum and the development of malignant arrhythmias was examined in a retrospective study involving 1011 patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction. Thirteen percent of the overall patients studied had significant hypokalemia (k less than 3.5 mmol/liter). The average initial level of potassium in patients who developed malignant arrhythmias was (4.10 mmol/liter) significantly lower (P less than 0.01) than those patients who did not develop such arrhythmias (4.19 mmol/liter). To determine whether the level of potassium was, in itself, the primary cause of malignant arrhythmias following myocardial infarction, a subgroup analysis of factors influencing these levels was performed. It was determined that diabetics have a higher level of potassium than nondiabetics (4.2 mmol/liter versus 4.11 mmol/liter - P = 0.01) and a lower incidence of malignant arrhythmias (50.5% versus 63.5% - P = 0.002). No correlation was found between treatment with either digitalis or diuretics and malignant arrhythmias. Size and location of infarcted areas was found to have a direct relationship with development of arrhythmias. Size and location of infarctions, however, were not found to be related to levels of potassium in the serum. Our findings support and clarify earlier suggestions establishing the levels of potassium in the serum as an important causative factor, together with size and location of infarctions, in the development of malignant arrhythmias.", 
    "40": "The therapeutic value of propranolol and other beta-adrenergic receptor blockers in anxiety disorders is reviewed. The potential side-effects of benzodiazepines, eg psychomotor impairment and dependance, suggest that the main indicators of these compounds are the acute anxiety states and the short term treatment of anxiety disorders requiring sedation. Thus, other psychotropic drugs may be of potential value in the treatment of these disorders. The results of the placebo-controlled studies reviewed here strongly suggest that propranolol is useful in the treatment of anxiety disorders, especially those: 1) characterized by the presence of somatic symptoms related to increased adrenergic tone; 2) of moderate intensity and/or seen in general practice; 3) of recent onset and not fulfilling DSM III criteria for specific chronic anxiety disorders. Propranolol and other beta-blockers may also be useful in the prevention of performance anxiety such as the fear of speaking in public or specific social phobias when limited in number in the same patients. Average therapeutic doses range from 20 to 40 mg, once to three times a day; the clinical efficacy of beta-blockers administered for periods longer than 4 weeks remains to be demonstrated. The potential impairment of cognitive functions by propranolol is still a matter of controversy as well as its ability to induce depressive states in predisposed patients. Furthermore, the efficacy of beta-blockers that do not cross the blood-brain barrier in the treatment of anxiety raises unresolved questions concerning the mode of action (central vs peripheric) of these medications. In short, beta-blocking agents, and especially propranolol, should be considered as potential therapeutic agents in the pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders besides benzodiazepines, antidepressant compounds and the newer azapirones, eg buspirone.", 
    "41": "Using isolated rat hepatocytes, the in vitro intrinsic hepatic clearance of three drugs, namely, antipyrine (AP), propranolol (P), and CGS 13429 was determined. The hepatic extraction ratios of AP, P, and CGS 13429 were then calculated to be 0.10, 0.90, and 0.88, respectively. To determine the in vivo hepatic extraction ratio in the rat, AP, P, or CGS 13429 was infused separately at a rate of 40, 20, and 20 micrograms/min.kg, via jugular and hepatic portal veins. The steady state plasma levels of AP, P, and CGS 13429 were 5.30 +/- 0.33 micrograms/ml, 608 +/- 76 and 380 +/- 46 ng/ml after jugular vein (iv) infusions, and 4.96 +/- 0.46 micrograms/ml, 162 +/- 26, and 148 +/- 23 ng/ml after hepatic portal vein (hpv) infusions, respectively. The blood to plasma ratios of AP, P, and CGS 13429 were 1.0, 0.78, and 1.0, respectively. The in vivo hepatic extraction ratio, calculated as (Css,iv--Css,hpv)/Css,iv from steady state blood levels following iv and hpv infusions for AP, P, and CGS 13429, were 0.065, 0.73, and 0.61, respectively. These results suggest that in vitro metabolism studies by hepatocytes may have potential application, during drug discovery, to distinguish drugs of low and high metabolic hepatic extraction ratio in vivo.", 
    "42": "1. The relaxation induced by beta-adrenoceptor agonists in rat vas deferens was examined under two different experimental conditions: on electrically-induced twitch responses (35 V, 3 ms, 0.07 Hz), and on contractions induced by single doses of barium chloride (300 microM). The experiments were performed in vasa of reserpine-treated rats, after blockade of alpha-adrenoceptors and extraneuronal uptake with dibenamine (10 microM, 30 min), and neuronal uptake with cocaine (10 microM). 2. When twitch responses were used, the values of pD2, interpolated from cumulative concentration-response curves for isoprenaline (Iso), adrenaline (Ad), and noradrenaline (NA) showed a rank order of potency consistent with the presence of beta 2-adrenoceptors (Iso greater than Ad much greater than NA). 3. When twitch responses were used, the non-selective beta-antagonist, propranolol, caused a concentration-dependent parallel shift to the right of Iso concentration-response curves. Similar shifts were obtained by use of the beta 2-antagonist, isopropylmethoxamine (IMA), and higher doses of the beta 1-antagonist, practolol, according to the expectations from receptor occupation theory. Practolol presented the lowest value of pKB, 5.03, corroborating the presence of beta 2-adrenoceptors. 4. When twitch responses were used, and Ad or NA employed instead of Iso, the antagonists produced shifts of concentration-response curves which were smaller than expected from theory, precluding the determination of pKB values. This indicates that other mechanisms are involved besides an interaction with a single population of postsynaptic beta 2-adrenoceptors. 5. When barium chloride was used instead of twitch responses, although the potencies of Iso and Ad were increased respectively by about 30 fold and 5 fold, the rank order of potency was still consistent with an interaction with beta 2-adrenoceptors. In addition, the antagonists produced parallel and concentrationdependent shifts of the curves of all the agonists, as expected from receptor theory. The values of pKB for a given antagonist were not modified by interchanging the agonists used, indicating a typical interaction with a single population of beta 2-adrenoceptors. When compared to the field-stimulated vas, the values of pKB for propranolol and IMA against isoprenaline were respectively 1.3 and 0.6 log units larger. These results suggest the beta l-adrenoceptor agents act by different mechanisms of action in barium-stimulated and electrically-stimulated vas. 6. It is suggested that when barium is used, the effects of agents acting on beta l-adrenoceptors are mediated only by postsynaptic beta 2-receptors, while other complicating factors, probably nerve-dependent presynaptic mechanisms, may be involved with electrical stimulation.", 
    "43": "1. We investigated the presence of dopamine D1 receptors in the myocardium of anesthetized pigs using intravenous infusions of dopamine, alone and after alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade and intracoronary infusions of the selective D1 receptor agonist, fenoldopam. 2. Intravenous infusion of dopamine (2.5, 5 and 10 micrograms kg-1 min-1 for 10 min, n = 6) caused dose-dependent changes in heart rate (from 94 +/- 6 to 132 +/- 10 beats min-1, P less than 0.05), the maximal rate of rise of left ventricular pressure (LVdP/dtmax; from 2280 +/- 170 to 4800 +/- 410 mmHgs-1, P less than 0.05), mean arterial blood pressure (from 87 +/- 5 to 62 +/- 3 mmHg) and systemic vascular resistance (from 40 +/- 4 to 28 +/- 2 mmHgl-1 min, P less than 0.05). The increases in heart rate and LVdP/dtmax were abolished when dopamine was infused after alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade. The vasodilator response was, however, only minimally affected. 3. Intravenous infusions of dopamine decreased coronary vascular resistance from 0.90 +/- 0.06 to 0.53 +/- 0.07 mmHg ml-1 min 100 g (P less than 0.05). This action of dopamine was not observed when dopamine was infused after blockade of the alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors. 4. Pretreatment with alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade had no effect or only slightly attenuated the dopamine-induced decrease in vascular resistance of the brain, kidneys, adrenals and small intestine. 5. In 7 animals, intracoronary doses of 0.04, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4g kg1- min 1 of fenoldopam had no effect on coronary venous oxygen content, local myocardial oxygen consumption, coronary blood flow or coronary vascular resistance. However, systemic effects were observed at the highest two doses, as manifested by a drop in mean arterial blood pressure from 82 +/- 4 to 72 +/- 4mmHg (P < 0.05) due to peripheral vasodilatation (e.g. cerebral vascular bed). Heart rate, LVdP/dt,.,, regional myocardial segment length shortening and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were not affected at these doses. In 2 animals the infusion rate was increased to 4jug kg1 min 1, but again there was no evidence for coronary vasodilatation. 6. We conclude that the intravenous infusion of dopamine after alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade and the intracoronary infusion of fenoldopam provided no evidence for a major role of D1 receptors in the coronary circulation of pigs. The absence of any effect of the employed doses of fenoldopam on LVdP/dt.mx and on regional myocardial segment length shortening also indicates that fenoldopam does not exhibit any inotropic action in this species.", 
    "44": "1. The effects of sustained moderate exercise in the sitting position on renal haemodynamics and glomerular filtration were measured in six normotensive patients with moderately impaired renal function and seven age-matched normal volunteers. 2. The changes in the effects of exercise on renal function induced by chronic cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blockade by drugs with (epanolol) and without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (atenolol) were examined. 3. Both beta-adrenoceptor blockers attenuated the heart rate increase with exercise, but only atenolol lowered blood pressure significantly. In resting volunteers on atenolol, associated with the fall in blood pressure there was a significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate. 4. Glomerular filtration fell significantly in all groups with exercise, and renal blood flow also fell in parallel. These changes were not influenced by drug treatment. 5. The exercise-induced rise in PRA was suppressed by atenolol but not by epanolol. 6. The renal function and haemodynamic responses to moderate exercise does not appear to be mediated by the systemic renin-angiotensin system or by beta 1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "45": "1. Atrial fibrillation is an inefficient cardiac rhythm associated with impaired exercise tolerance, exertional dyspnoea, palpitation and a substantial risk of thromboembolism. 2. The first decision in management is to consider cardioversion which can be achieved in suitable cases electrically, or pharmacologically with a class Ic antiarrhythmic drug like flecainide or propafenone. 3. Prophylaxis in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is best achieved with a class Ic drug or a class III drug such as sotalol or amiodarone. 4. Control of ventricular rate in chronic atrial fibrillation can be achieved by pharmacological manipulation of the atrioventricular node by digoxin alone, or in combination with the calcium channel blockers verapamil or diltiazem, or beta-adrenoceptor blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity like pindolol or xamoterol. 5. In view of the considerable risk of thromboembolism in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation anticoagulation or at least treatment with aspirin should be considered.", 
    "46": "The left descending coronary artery (LAD) was ligated for 45 min or 90 min followed by 1-h reperfusion. During experiments the animals in Group I (15 dogs) received saline infusion, in Group II (20 dogs) they received the ultrashort-acting beta-blocker Brevibloc (esmolol HCl). The marker of lipid peroxidation the malondialdehyde (MDH) as well as endogen scavengers, the glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured in the heart tissue homogenates. In blood and heart tissue samples the 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (PGF1 alpha) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) were determined. Biochemical measurements revealed that esmolol HCl has beneficial effect on the free-radical-meduated-damage reducing the MDA content in the ischemic area. In Group I the value of MDA after 90 min of LAD ligature was 138 +/- 5.6%, in Group II the elevation was only 107.4 +/- 3.2%. After treatment with Brevibloc the GSH content of ischemic-reperfused areas decreased slightly (81.75 +/- 3.5% of the normal value), moreover, in Group I the depletion of GSH was considerable (64.5 +/- 4.2%). Coronary reperfusion caused the release of eicosanoids in both groups, mainly in the first 10 min. The highest value of thromboxane in blood samples could be measured in Group I after 90 min of LAD ligature (24.8 +/- 3.6 pmol/ml; the normal value 8-12 pmol/ml). In Group II during the same period of experiments the TXB2 in the blood was 14 +/- 3.7 pmol/ml. In heart tissue samples the amount of endoperoxides increased in ischemic and non-ischemic areas of Group I and II. Nevertheless, the calculated ratio of PGF1 alpha and TXB2 was near to the normal after Brevibloc treatment (0.85-0.9; the normal values were 1-1.2). These results indicate that esmolol HCl can modulate both the free-radical-mediated reaction and arachidonic acid metabolism.", 
    "47": "Several therapeutic agents have been tested for secondary prevention after acute myocardial infarction. Each patient presents a clinical challenge and gives the physician an opportunity to use the tests and therapy most likely to benefit the clinical course. The presence of other associated medical conditions, the type of myocardial infarction, the presence or absence of accompanying ischemia, left ventricular dysfunction, intracardiac thrombus, or ventricular arrhythmias dictate the choices that are to be made. It is apparent from this review that no single class of agents can be considered a cure, although beta-adrenergic blocking agents come the closest to this role. Analysis of these drugs helps individualize drug therapy and provides a physiologic probe to understanding the pathophysiologic processes that characterize the period after myocardial infarction. To address the impact of developing technology and drug availability on the practice and cost of medical care, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association have developed guidelines for the management of patients with myocardial infarction. The clinical trial remains the best test for the assessment of therapeutic choices and can also expand our knowledge of the natural history of the disease process. Nevertheless, the issue of appropriate therapy is ever-changing, affected by the explosion of new technology and the continued investigation into the pathophysiology of coronary artery disease.", 
    "48": "Bleeding from oesophageal or gastric varices is a major complication of portal hypertension, and a leading cause of death in patients with liver cirrhosis. The efficacy of oral beta-blockers in preventing recurrence of gastrointestinal haemorrhage in these patients is debatable. A recent meta-analysis showed benefits in reducing bleeding risk, but results on mortality were inconclusive. We combined results from all available randomized controlled trials to evaluate treatment with beta-blockers in the prevention of the first bleeding episode, or recurrent haemorrhage, in patients with cirrhosis and varices. Scrutiny of the data from all 13 available randomized trials, in which 1154 patients were entered, suggests that treatment (4 trials, 589 patients) may decrease the rate of the first bleeding episode (p less than 0.001), but not of death in the same patients. Results from the analysis of 9 trials (565 patients) for the prevention of recurrent haemorrhage suggest a beneficial effect of treatment on bleeding (p less than 0.0001), and a slight efficacy on survival (p less than 0.05) by the DerSimonian and Laird method. The implications of this analysis are that (i) updating of meta-analyses is useful to overcome the problem of negative results of undersized trials and previous meta-analyses; and (ii) treatment with beta-blockers, for the prevention of the first bleeding episode or recurrent haemorrhage, appears to be promising, but its effects on an important end point, such as death, still need to be reliably assessed.",

However, since continuous administration of CAs develops tolerance in hemodynamics presumably due to desensitization of beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR)-adenylate cyclase (AC) system, beta antagonist, instead of beta agonist, has recently been employed to treat CHF, in that it may recover beta AR-AC system. In this study, the precise mechanisms of alterations in cardiac beta AM-AC system after chronic administration of beta agonist or antagonist, were investigated. The rats were treated continuously for 14 days with saline, isoproterenol (ISO), atenolol (ATENO), or denopamine (DENO), a new positive inotropic agent with beta 1 selective AR agonistic properties, which is reported to hardly cause the tolerance in clinical studies. beta AR density (Bmax) was markedly reduced by ISO and slightly increased by ATENO. Forskolin stimulated cyclase activity was reduced markedly by ISO. Total amount of the pertussis toxin substrates (inhibitory G-protein; Gi) and cholera toxin substrates (stimulatory G-protein; Gs) were not different among 4 groups. However, Gs activity measured by human platelet reconstitutive assay was reduced by ISO and DENO. These results indicate that ISO-induced desensitization in caused by the reduction in Gs and AC-catalytic activity as well as by the down-regulation of beta AR. Furthermore, it is suggested that DENO may cause slight desensitization of beta AR-AC system due to reduced Gs activity.", 
    "50": "The genetic determinants of the metabolism of certain drugs used in cardiology is one predictable cause of variability in their pharmacokinetics and effects. Genetic polymorphism of the metabolism of drugs is characterised by the existence of several metabolic phenotypes, usually 2, which allow distinction between fast and slow metabolisers. Clinical identification of these phenotypes is relatively simple. The enzymatic deficiency in slow metabolisers concerns a specific metabolic pathway responsible for the biotransformation of the drug but it respects other eventual metabolic pathways. For a given drug and a given metabolic pathway, slow metabolisers are unable to eliminate the parent product by hepatic metabolism. When the drug is given orally, the plasma concentrations of the parent product in slow metabolisers are 5 to 25 times higher than those observed in fast metabolisers. Depending on the given drug, doses usually well tolerated by fast metabolisers may cause excessive effects in slow metabolisers. The pharmacodynamic consequences of genetic polymorphism on the metabolism of drugs depend essentially on the therapeutic index of the drug concerned and on the activity of the metabolites formed by the genetically determined pathway of the parent product. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic consequences of the two main genetic polymorphisms concerning drugs used in cardiology are discussed: the polymorphism of N acetylation and that of cytochrome P-450 IID6.", 
    "51": "The three approaches (physiopathological, epidemiological and pharmacological) to the management of hypertension should converge to provide a personalized prescription of the most appropriate treatment to prevent and/or cure the cardiovascular complications of hypertension: hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy and the risks directly related to it (haemodynamic, arrhythmic, ischaemic) may be corrected by certain antihypertensive agents (methyldopa, ACE inhibitors, some calcium antagonists) although there is no proof as yet of the benefits of this intervention (which could suppress the adaptation to the increased wall stress of the left ventricle); malignant hypertension and its cardiovascular complications have almost disappeared with modern antihypertensive therapy. Cardiac failure can be effectively prevented and cured when exclusively related to hypertension. When diastolic pressures are lowered by 8-10 mmHg cerebrovascular risk is reduced by a half and coronary risk by a quarter. Cardiovascular mortality related to hypertension is thus reduced by 20% and total mortality is thereby significantly decreased; the large scale clinical trials which provided these data were performed in the years 1965-1985 with diuretic therapy relayed by (or compared with) betablockers from 1980 onwards. These two families remain the drugs of reference in the prevention and treatment of the cardiovascular complications of hypertension. Personalized description of antihypertensive therapy should take into account the degree of risk and previous cardiovascular complications of the hypertensive patient: betablockers eventually associated with calcium antagonists are to be preferred in cases of hypertension with coronary artery disease and/or arrhythmias, severe hypertension and hypertension complicated by cardiac failure are good indications for ACE inhibitors without prejudicing other therapeutic options necessary in certain contexts, in particular aspirin therapy in patients with previous transient ischemic cerebral attacks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "52": "We review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and relative costs of beta-blockers, as well as indications for and therapeutic controversies surrounding their use. It is hoped that this discussion will assist clinicians in making informed decisions when choosing a drug for a hospital formulary or a particular patient. Beta-blockers are indicated for a variety of noncardiovascular and cardiovascular conditions, including hypertension, ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, and prophylaxis of myocardial infarction (MI). These agents compete with catecholamines at beta-adrenoreceptors. They have different ancillary properties, including intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), cardioselectivity, and membrane stabilizing-activity, and vary in their duration of action, route of elimination, and lipophilicity. Beta-blocking agents decrease oxygen demand by exerting a negative inotropic and chronotropic effect. They also reduce blood pressure and possess antiarrhythmic effects. Beta-blockers penetrate the central nervous system (CNS) to different degrees and can cause a wide variety of CNS adverse effects. Nonselective beta-blockers have been noted to slightly reduce renal blood flow. Nadolol is an exception in that either no change, or even a small increase in renal blood flow, is observed upon initiation of therapy. Beta-blockers also act on the pulmonary bed by preventing beta 2-mediated bronchodilation, thereby exacerbating bronchospastic disease in some patients. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents can potentiate both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in diabetic patients. Their effects on total peripheral resistance (TPR) are controversial. Initially it appears that beta-blockade increases TPR. After chronic therapy, however, TPR decreases to or below baseline values. These agents appear to be equally efficacious in the treatment of hypertension, arrhythmias, and ischemic heart disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "53": "Few studies have been conducted that focus on survival as the end point of medical therapy of CHF. No vigorous studies have been conducted in dogs. It is generally accepted that diuretic therapy is an essential component of the therapy of CHF in cardiomyopathic dogs. Significant symptomatic improvement is afforded by diuretics, and acute death may be prevented. In this context diuretics can be said to improve survival. However, diuretics do not alter the natural progression of cardiomyopathy and in this context do not favorably influence long-term survival. Digitalis glycosides have been shown in humans to improve various parameters of CHF in a subset of patients with either atrial fibrillation or third heart sounds. In dogs, these gallop heart rhythms due to third heart sounds are usually associated with myocardial failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy. In spite of symptomatic improvement, no study has demonstrated an unequivocal favorable effect of digoxin on survival of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Likewise, there is no convincing evidence of an adverse effect on survival. Newer, powerful inotropes, such as milrinone, often demonstrate impressive short-term improvements in left ventricular function, clinical signs, and exercise tolerance in patients with CHF. However, their long-term benefits are much less impressive, they are arrhythmogenic, and they have not been shown to prolong survival. In fact, long-term milrinone therapy in humans has had an unfavorable influence on mortality. Vasodilators offer the potential advantage of increasing left ventricular performance without an associated increase in myocardial oxygen demand and cardiac rhythm disturbances. The only vigorous survival study that unequivocally demonstrated improved survival of patients with advanced CHF due to myocardial failure, including dilated cardiomyopathy, was the Consensus Trial. Survival of patients receiving enalapril was significantly better than those receiving placebo. In fact, the trial was stopped prematurely by the ethical review committee when it became obvious that the results favored the enalapril group. Although the use of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs in cardiomyopathic patients with CHF is controversial and associated with a risk of short-term deterioration of left ventricular function, their use in human medicine is gaining acceptance. Although hemodynamic and clinical evidence of improvement has been demonstrated along with withdrawal-associated deterioration, the only study purporting a beneficial effect on survival used retrospective controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "54": "The positive lusitropic and direct coronary vasodilating properties of the calcium channel blocking agents are beneficial therapeutic effects not provided by the beta-adrenergic blocking agents for the management of feline HCM. Data from cats studied at the University of Tennessee suggest that diltiazem more consistently alleviates clinical signs and more effectively prolongs survival in cats with HCM than either propranolol or verapamil. Orally administered diltiazem appears to have sustained beneficial effects on left ventricular filling and cardiac performance based on its ability to reduce resting heart rate, decrease blood lactate concentration, increase venous oxygen tension, improve echocardiographic parameters, and resolve radiographic abnormalities. Long-term diltiazem administration may also reverse myocardial hypertrophy in some patients. There appear to be few if any side effects of this drug. Diltiazem, therefore, provides a safe and effective approach for the management of feline HCM.", 
    "55": "Feline myocardial diseases today are largely represented by disorders involving LV hypertrophy. They may be attended by arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, systemic hypertension, thromboembolic complications, and sudden death. These structural myocardial disorders and their hemodynamic and electrocardiographic derangements may cause or result in variable degrees of diastolic dysfunction. Propranolol and aspirin represent two agents commonly employed to treat feline cardiomyopathies for more than 15 years. Nevertheless, clinical data describing their effect on morbidity and mortality are lacking. It is likely that propranolol administered at moderate to high doses effects favorable responses in some cats with clinical signs attributable to severe hypertrophy, outflow obstruction, or tachyarrhythmias. It is unknown whether clinical improvements are due to direct myocardial effects or (more likely) secondary responses to a beta-adrenergic blockade reduction in heart rate or contractility. Personal experience also indicates that high numbers of cats have received the drug for many years in combination with other therapies (especially furosemide) and remain in a compensated state of heart failure without untoward drug effects. On the other hand, many cardiomyopathic cats experience heart failure, arrhythmias, and death despite treatment with beta-blocking agents. Feline thromboembolism is a devastating complication of cardiomyopathic disorders. Until or unless the primary cause(s) of current diseases is elucidated to promote disease reversal, factors responsible for thrombus formation will accompany the heart diseases, protected from effective management. It appears unlikely that aspirin as currently recommended produces any obvious benefit in treating or preventing thromboembolism. Modifications of therapeutic protocols prescribing these frequently used drugs await well-constructed clinical trials evaluating their efficacy with respect to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.",

There were 56 episodes of granulomatous anterior uveitis, all associated with large (mutton-fat) keratic precipitates, flare, cells, and 'white eyes' (except in seven episodes). In 30 (53.6%) of these episodes there was loss of control of intraocular pressure. Metipranolol 0.6% was implicated in 54 of the 56 episodes and metipranolol 0.3% in the remaining two. Fifty-one other cases of metipranolol-associated granulomatous anterior uveitis have so far been reported from other parts of the country to the Committee on Safety of Medicines. As a result multidose metipranolol in 0.1%, 0.3%, and 0.6% strengths has been withdrawn from clinical use in the United Kingdom. The pathogenesis of this adverse drug reaction is uncertain.", 
    "57": "The purpose of this study was to develop and test a new beta-Blocker Visual Analog Scale designed to identify and quantify the impact that the side effects of beta-blocker therapy have on people's lives, and the self-management practices people use to mediate their influence. Instruments included the 20-item beta-Blocker Visual Analog Scale and the Profile of Mood States. Subjects had hypertension; 51 men were involved in a larger study involving antihypertensive medications and exercise, and 19 men and women were receiving beta-blocker therapy as first-line drug of choice. Estimates of internal consistency reliability, content validity, and concurrent and discriminant validity were moderately strong. The most problematic side effects were related to lack of sleep, vivid or active dreams, lack of energy and pep, diminished interest in sexual activity, and changes in vision. Among self-management practices used to mediate side effects were planning rest and activity periods, thinking carefully before reacting, and seeking out others for support.", 
    "58": "Antihypertensive therapy has been used for almost 35 years to reduce blood pressure and prevent morbidity and mortality related to the hypertensive state. Malignant, severe, and moderate hypertension have all been shown to be worthy of drug treatment, but controversy remains as to the degree of benefit that is achievable by treating milder hypertension. A variety of clinical trials have demonstrated that antihypertensive therapy reduces the incidence of stroke, congestive heart failure, and left ventricular hypertrophy and the progression in severity of hypertension. The benefits with respect to prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) have been much less impressive. Thiazide diuretics have been the base therapy for the bulk of the hypertensive subjects studied to date who have not demonstrated reduced incidence of CHD. Therapy with beta-blockers has the potential for reducing CHD, but an analysis of four studies finds only two with positive results. On the other hand, since that study found reduced total mortality as well as CHD compared with thiazide diuretic, its findings cannot be ignored. Other questions deserving further investigation include how other antihypertensive therapies compare with respect to the risk reduction found with thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers, the optimal posttreatment blood pressure, whether persons with mild hypertension benefit from therapy, whether women should be treated differently, and whether atherosclerosis may be affected by specific antihypertensive therapies.", 
    "59": "Beta-Adrenergic blockers have been considered relatively contraindicated in peripheral arterial disease because of the perceived risk that these drugs could worsen intermittent claudication. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of available randomized controlled trials from the English-language literature to determine whether or not beta-blockers exacerbate intermittent claudication. The primary focus of this analysis was the effect of beta-blockers on exercise duration, measured as walking capacity or endurance time. Outcomes were pooled where appropriate. Of 11 eligible reports, six included 11 individual controlled treatment comparisons that provided data for an analysis of pain-free exercise capacity; no effect size was statistically significant. The pooled effect size for pain-free walking distance was -0.24 (95% confidence interval, -0.62 to 0.14), indicating no significant impairment of walking capacity compared with placebo. Only one study reported that certain beta-blockers were associated with worsening of intermittent claudication. These results strongly suggest that beta-blockers do not adversely affect walking capacity or symptoms of intermittent claudication in patients with mild to moderate peripheral arterial disease. In the absence of other contraindications, beta-blockers can probably be used safely in such patients.", 
    "60": "In arteries, analogues of L-arginine inhibit the synthesis of nitric oxide and thereby reduce endothelium-dependent relaxations. Experiments were designed to determine whether analogues of L-arginine affect endothelium-dependent responses in a systemic vein. Rings cut from canine femoral arteries and veins were suspended for the measurement of isometric force in organ chambers. In some rings, the endothelium was deliberately removed. All experiments were conducted in the presence of indomethacin (10(-5) M). NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA, 10(-4) M) reduced significantly endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine, ADP, and thrombin in arteries but not in veins. In the veins, the alpha 2-adrenergic agonist BHT-920 caused contractions which were reduced in rings with endothelium. L-NMMA eliminated the difference in contraction between rings with and without endothelium in the veins. This effect was reversed by L- but not D-arginine (3 x 10(-4) M). N omega-nitro-L-arginine (10(-4) M) reduced endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine, thrombin, and the calcium ionophore A23187 in venous rings. However, it did not alter the contractions to BHT-920 in rings with or without endothelium. L-Canavanine did not alter endothelium-dependent relaxations in the veins. These results suggest that synthesis of nitric oxide is associated with stimulation of alpha 2-adrenergic, muscarinic, and thrombin receptors on venous endothelial cells. Furthermore, the analogues of L-arginine affect endothelium-dependent relaxations in canine veins differentially.", 
    "61": "The hypothesis was tested that peripheral, adrenergic nerves modulate reactive hyperemia (RH) in the intestinal circulation. In anesthetized rats, anterior mesenteric arterial occlusion for 30-120 s elicited subsequent RH responses, including 63-118% increases in the velocity of arterial blood flow, even greater increases in conductance, and durations of 64-139 s. The longer the period of arterial occlusion, the greater the magnitude of RH. Electrical stimulation of postganglionic, sympathetic nerves reduced RH responses in a frequency-dependent manner. RH responses were enhanced by pretreatment with hexamethonium and phenoxybenzamine and were diminished by pretreatment with propranolol. Propranolol also prevented the enhanced RH responses caused by hexamethonium and phenoxybenzamine. Reserpine prevented the enhanced RH responses to hexamethonium, but bilateral adrenalectomy did not. These findings support the hypothesis that peripheral sympathetic nerves modulate RH in rat gut, with alpha-adrenergic receptors restricting and beta-adrenergic receptors enhancing the hyperemia.",

Results of a recent study examining the effects of combination terazosin and verapamil therapy on blood pressure and heart rate are also presented. In several studies of the combination of terazosin plus a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide, methyclothiazide, chlorthalidone, furosemide, amiloride, triamterene, metolazone, or spironolactone), significant decreases in one or more of the blood pressure variables studied were demonstrated (compared with diuretic plus placebo). In a placebo-controlled, double-blind study of terazosin plus atenolol, supine and standing blood pressures decreased significantly from baseline (atenolol monotherapy) after the addition of terazosin but not placebo. In a study of terazosin added to background therapy (including beta-blockers, diuretics, methyldopa, clonidine, captopril, guanethidine, hydralazine, and nifedipine), the addition of terazosin resulted in significant decreases in supine and standing diastolic blood pressures compared with baseline values (background therapy alone). Combination antihypertensive therapy with terazosin and verapamil reduced blood pressure to a significantly greater extent than either agent alone. Preliminary pharmacokinetic results indicate that terazosin did not alter the metabolism of verapamil. No significant abnormal laboratory test results have been reported for patients taking terazosin in combination with other antihypertensive agents; in fact some evidence suggests that terazosin may attenuate adverse lipid, glucose, and potassium changes associated with thiazide diuretics. Adverse experiences associated with terazosin combination therapy are usually mild to moderate. Results from all these studies suggest that terazosin effectively controls mild-to-moderate hypertension when it is used in combination with other antihypertensive agents without cumulative adverse effects.",

The numbers of patients with controlled blood pressure at the last evaluable visit of each therapy period were as follows: terazosin alone, 106 of 245 (43%); terazosin with added diuretic, 70 of 112 (63%); diuretic with added terazosin, 47 of 88 (53%); and terazosin plus diuretic with added beta-blocker, 22 of 32 (69%). Most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Only pain in extremities had a higher incidence during long-term treatment (6%, 181 to 360-day period) than during initial short-term treatment (5%, 1 to 90-day period). Three of six syncopal events occurred during the initial 180 days of treatment; this 0.8% (3/364) incidence was comparable with that reported previously for short-term studies. Only one case of syncope occurred during terazosin monotherapy. Terazosin was judged to be a safe and effective long-term medication for the treatment of hypertension.",

In forebrain tissue, saturable and stereoselective binding was detected on gestational day 13. The amount of beta-adrenergic binding increased until postnatal day 23, when adult values were reached. The dissociation constants of [125I]iodocyanopindolol binding remained the same throughout development, as did the affinity of several beta-adrenergic and non-beta-adrenergic compounds. The proportion of the beta 2-adrenergic receptors was determined using the beta 1-selective antagonist ICI-89406 (7-150 nmol/L) and was found to change from 65% in prenatal forebrain tissue to 28% in adulthood.

    "72": "Phenylephrine increased [3H]norepinephrine efflux and accumulation of cyclic AMP in cultured rat superior cervical ganglion cells superfused with Tyrode's solution. The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism and relationship between these two events. Electrical stimulation (1-2 Hz), potassium chloride (50 mM), and the preferential alpha 1-adrenergic receptor agonist phenylephrine (1-100 microM) increased fractional tritium efflux, whereas methoxamine, cirazoline, and amidephrine were relatively ineffective. Phenylephrine, but not methoxamine and cirazoline, also increased cyclic AMP accumulation. Phenylephrine-induced tritium efflux was not altered by alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists or by removal of extracellular calcium. Phenylephrine-induced cyclic AMP accumulation was blocked by the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists propranolol and atenolol. Forskolin (10 microM) and the nonhydrolyzable cyclic AMP analogue 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)cyclic AMP (100 microM) had minimal effect on tritium efflux. However, phenylephrine-evoked increase in tritium efflux was dose dependently attenuated by the neuronal uptake blocker cocaine, and phenylephrine dose-dependently inhibited the incorporation of [3H]norepinephrine into neuronal stores. We conclude that the increase in tritium efflux induced by phenylephrine is independent of cyclic AMP accumulation and appears to be mediated by uptake of phenylephrine via the neuronal carrier-mediated amine transport process, which in turn promotes efflux of the adrenergic transmitter from its storage sites.", 
    "73": "1. Ventricular myocytes were isolated by enzymatic dispersion of adult rabbit hearts, and voltage clamped using the whole-cell variation of the patch clamp technique. Experiments were carried out at either 35 degrees C or room temperature (21-23 degrees C). 2. In the presence of 10(-3) M-4-aminopyridine to block the transient outward K+ current, and 10(-6) M-propranolol to block beta-adrenoceptors, the alpha 1-adrenergic agonist methoxamine produced action potential prolongation, and a small depolarization of the diastolic membrane potential. Under voltage clamp conditions, methoxamine decreased the magnitude of the inward rectifier K+ current, IK1, in both the inward and outward directions. This effect was dose dependent (10(-5)-10(-3) M) and fully reversible upon wash-out of the agonist. 3. The neurotransmitter noradrenaline (10(-6)-2 x 10(-5) M), in the presence of propranolol (10(-6) M), also reduced IK1 in ventricular cells, and this effect was blocked by the specific alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin. 4. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated decrease in IK1 in ventricular myocytes was not affected by pre-incubation of the cells with 0.5 micrograms/ml pertussis toxin (8-10 h, 30-32 degrees C). This result suggests that in rabbit ventricular cells, the alpha 1-modulation of IK1 occurs via a pertussis toxin-insensitive guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein. 5. These observations demonstrate that IK1 in ventricular myocytes can be modulated by cardiac alpha 1-adrenoceptors. The resulting changes in action potential repolarization and diastolic membrane potential may have significant effects on cardiac performance.", 
    "74": "The relation between the density of beta receptors on myocardial cells and lymphocytes and the pathologic change of myocardium in hypertensive-diabetic (HD) rats in various stages during development of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) was investigated and the alteration of lymphocytic beta receptors in 20 patients with DCM was also studied. The results showed that the density of beta receptors on lymphocytes in the patients with class I-II cardiac status appeared to be in up regulation. The same was found with the receptors on lymphocytes and myocardial cells in HD rats at early stage. Conversely, the receptors were in down regulation on lymphocytes in DCM patients with class III-IV cardiac status and the same with those on lymphocytes and myocardial cells in HD rats at late stage. The changes of the receptors on lymphocytes and myocardial cells in the rats and the patients were quite parallel. Up regulation of beta receptors happened earlier than the pathologic changes in the myocardium in HD rats. Thus, the changes of lymphocytic beta receptors did reflect the behaviour of the receptors on myocardial cells with these data, it is reasonable to use beta blocker at early stage in patients with DCM so as to slow down the disease process.",

Considerable interspecies variations in the magnitude of specific non-beta-adrenergic (NBA) binding of 125I-ICYP were shown. The equilibrium constant of dissociation (Kd) of the specific NBA binding sites for 125I-ICYP was 0.3-0.4 nmol.litre-1, and the binding capacities were 20, 106, and 192 fmol.mg-1 protein in rat, human, and porcine myocardium, respectively. The NBA sites were heat sensitive and destroyed by trypsin. Association to NBA sites occurred more rapidly than to beta adrenoceptors. Dissociation of bound 125I-ICYP from NBA sites and beta adrenoceptors at 30 degrees C revealed first order kinetics with t1/2 of 19 min from NBA, as compared to 120 min from beta adrenoceptors. In all three species the ligand specificity for NBA sites was very similar and various adrenergic agonists and antagonists competed with 125I-ICYP binding with the following potencies: timolol greater than propranolol greater than ICI 118 551 greater than pindolol greater than Sandoz 204 545 greater than terbutaline greater than noradrenaline and adrenaline much greater than isoprenaline and atenolol.

While beta-adrenergic receptors are implicated in the level of anaesthesia/arousal, whether the analeptic action of TRH involves adrenergic systems for its expression is uncertain. The object of the present experiments, therefore, was to examine interactions between adrenergic systems and the anti-anaesthetic effects of TRH analogue CG3703. It was found that pretreatment with the beta-block (+/-)propranolol did not abolish or reduce the ability of CG3703 to antagonize urethane-induced depression of VBT transmission. These results suggest therefore, that beta-adrenergic systems are unlikely to be involved in the anti-anaesthetic effect of the tripeptide.",

In 10 patients with essential hypertension, we investigated the influence of betaxolol, a selective beta 1-adrenergic blocking agent, on renal function and on plasma levels of ANP during exercise, volume depletion and volume expansion. Chronic therapy with betaxolol (mean 14.5 mg/day) did not alter glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow although blood pressure was reduced. Renal vascular resistance decreased from 12795 +/- 1064 dyn/s per cm5 to 10614 +/- 833 dyn/s per cm5 (P less than 0.005). Under betaxolol, basal ANP levels increased from 39 +/- 10 pg/ml to 80 +/- 19pg/ml (P less than 0.01). ANP increased during exercise and volume expansion but was decreased during volume depletion. ANP values observed under betaxolol treatment showed significantly higher values while preserving their dynamic features.

We found that specific [125I]HEAT binding to alpha 1-adrenergic receptors was not affected by aging or by norepinephrine depletion. Although aging also had no effect on the density or affinity of [3H]UK-14,304 and [125I]pindolol binding to alpha 2- and beta-adrenergic receptors, the density of receptors increased significantly in all age groups after noradrenergic denervation. beta-Adrenergic receptors of cerebral microvessels also were unaffected by aging, but increased their density after noradrenergic denervation at all ages. In all instances, there were no significant effects on the affinity of ligand binding. We conclude that aging does not affect the density or the affinity of adrenergic receptors in the cerebral cortex of Fischer-344 rats, nor does it affect the response of these receptors to norepinephrine depletion.", 
    "83": "We established a cell-free system in which epinephrine and other lipolytic agents stimulated lipolysis of endogenous lipid droplets from fat cells by hormone-sensitive lipase. The endogenous lipid droplets were prepared by hypotonic treatment of fat cells and their successive washing with buffer containing 0.025% Triton X-100. In the cell-free system, propranolol inhibited lipolysis induced by various lipolytic agents such as norepinephrine, theophylline and cyclic AMP (cAMP), whereas phenoxybenzamine did not inhibit lipolysis. The binding of these lipolytic agents to endogenous lipid droplets was inhibited by propranolol, but not by phenoxybenzamine. The \"propranolol-sensitive\" binding of these lipolytic agents to the droplets may be involved in lipolysis. Treatment of the droplets with phospholipase C, but not phospholipase D, inhibited the propranolol-sensitive binding of these lipolytic agents to the droplets. These results suggest that the phosphate group of phospholipid in the droplets may be the site of propranolol-sensitive of binding of theophylline, and cAMP in addition to norepinephrine.", 
    "84": "Pulmonary function measurements were made in control ponies and in ponies with recurrent obstructive pulmonary disease (principals) during clinical remission and during an attack of acute airway obstruction. The ponies were given beta-adrenergic antagonists and agonists to determine the role of beta receptors in recurrent obstructive pulmonary disease, and to determine the subtypes of beta receptors mediating bronchodilation in ponies. Aerosol administration of the beta antagonists, propranolol (beta 1 and beta 2), atenolol (beta 1), and butoxamine (beta 2) decreased dynamic compliance (Cdyn) and increased pulmonary resistance (RL) in the principal ponies during airway obstruction, but were without effect when the ponies were in clinical remission. Intravenous administration of atropine reversed the effect of atenolol on Cdyn and RL, but was without effect on the decrease in Cdyn and increase in RL observed after butoxamine administration. The beta antagonists did not affect airway function in the control ponies. The effect of beta blockade on Cdyn and RL suggests beta-adrenergic activation in the central and peripheral airways of principal ponies, mediated through both beta 2- and beta 1-adrenergic receptors. The aerosol beta agonists, isoproterenol (beta 1 and beta 2), and clenbuterol (beta 2) attenuated histamine-induced airway obstruction to a similar extent in control ponies that were given histamine IV. In addition, the beta 1 antagonist, atenolol, did not attenuate the bronchodilation observed with isoproterenol. We concluded that, although beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors exist in pony airways and are activated during acute airway obstruction, bronchodilation in response to beta agonists in ponies seems to be mediated primarily by beta 2-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "85": "We tested the hypotheses that nonselective beta-adrenergic blockade does not cause absolute hypoglycemia unawareness but shifts the glycemic thresholds for symptoms to lower plasma glucose concentrations and that neither neuroglycopenic symptoms nor cognitive impairments during hypoglycemia are altered by beta-adrenergic blockade. To do so, we applied the euglycemic and stepped hypoglycemic clamp techniques to patients with moderately controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) in the absence (n = 8) and presence (n = 9) of the nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. Compared with the corresponding euglycemic clamps, total symptom scores first increased at the 4.4-mM plasma glucose step (a higher level than that of 2.8 mM in nondiabetic subjects studied previously) in the absence of propranolol. Beta-adrenergic blockade did not produce absolute hypoglycemia unawareness. Indeed, at the frankly hypoglycemic step of 2.8 mM, total symptom scores tended to be higher in the presence than in the absence of propranolol. This was largely the result of greater (P less than 0.01) perception of diaphoresis. However, symptom scores did not increase until the 3.3-mM plasma glucose step during beta-adrenergic blockade. The perception of hunger, and perhaps that of tremulousness, was reduced by propranolol at the higher glucose steps. Neuroglycopenic symptoms were not reduced by propranolol. The cognitive function of memory, but not that of attention, was impaired, also starting at the 4.4-mM glucose step. This was not impaired further by propranolol. Thus, we formed the following conclusions. 1) Nonselective beta-adrenergic blockade does not cause absolute hypoglycemia unawareness but shifts the glycemic thresholds for symptoms to lower plasma glucose concentrations in patients with IDDM. 2) Beta-adrenergic blockade does not reduce neuroglycopenic symptoms, and it does not further impair cognitive function during hypoglycemia in IDDM patients.", 
    "86": "To determine the contribution of diuresis-induced bladder hypertrophy, which accompanies the diabetic state, on the biochemical and functional alterations observed in the diabetic bladder, we compared three experimental groups: 8-wk streptozocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats, 8-wk sucrose-fed diuretic rats, and age-matched controls. Diabetic and sucrose-fed rats had higher water intake, higher urine output, and larger bladders than controls. Diabetic rats had lower serum insulin levels, lower body weights, and higher serum glucose levels than either control or sucrose-fed animals. Receptor binding studies with [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate in bladder dome demonstrated an upregulation of muscarinic receptors in diabetic and sucrose-fed rats compared with controls. Parallel binding studies with [3H]dihydroalprenolol and [125I]iodopindolol showed an upregulation of beta-adrenergic receptors in diabetic but not in sucrose-fed bladder domes. Carbachol induced larger contractile responses in diabetic and sucrose-fed than in control bladder dome muscle strips. isoproterenol relaxed KCl-contracted detrusor strips from both diabetic and sucrose-fed rats to a greater degree and with a higher affinity than detrusor strips from controls. Our data show that overdistension and increased workload per se contributed to the upregulation of muscarinic but not to the upregulation of beta-adrenergic receptors in STZ-induced diabetes. Furthermore, the magnitude of carbachol-induced contractions correlated with muscarinic receptor upregulation, whereas the magnitude of isoproterenol-induced relaxation did not correlate with changes in the density of the beta-adrenergic receptors. Thus, it appears that different regulatory mechanisms are involved in diabetes-induced alterations in muscarinic and beta-adrenergic receptors in bladder dome.", 
    "87": "The whole-cell arrangement of the patch-clamp technique was used to examine the effect of protein kinase C (PKC) stimulation on ion channels in isolated guinea pig ventricular cells. In the presence of appropriate external solutions and drugs to reduce contamination from sodium, calcium, and potassium ion currents, application of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, to stimulate PKC, activated a time-independent background current. The current-voltage relation for the PKC-activated current was linear over the voltage range of -90 to +60 mV. Alteration of the chloride equilibrium potential, brought about through changes in external and internal Cl- concentrations, shifted the reversal potential for the background current in a manner expected for a Cl- -selective ion channel. The PKC-activated current was reversibly inhibited by the S-(-)-enantiomer of the monocarboxylic acid derivative 8-chlorophenoxyproprionic acid, at a concentration that did not affect Ca2+ or delayed rectifier K+ currents. Dialysis of ventricular cells with partially purified PKC obtained from rat brain resulted in the activation of a large (greater than 1-nA) time-independent background current after addition of external phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. In the presence of the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol, norepinephrine activated a background current with properties similar to those of the PKC-sensitive current. It is concluded that cardiac ventricular cells contain PKC-activated Cl- channels, which may be regulated during alpha-adrenergic stimulation.", 
    "88": "Endothelin-1 elicited a positive inotropic effect (PIE) on isolated rabbit, guinea pig, and rat but not on dog ventricular myocardium. Specific high-affinity binding of 125I-labeled endothelin-1 was detected in the ventricular membrane fraction of these species. Maximal binding capacity was the highest in the rabbit, lowest in the dog, and in between in the guinea pig and rat; this rank order corresponds roughly to the effectiveness of endothelin-1 in producing a PIE. There was no difference in the potency or efficacy for the PIE of the endothelin isoforms endothelin-1, -2, and -3 in the rabbit papillary muscle. A tumor-promoting phorbol ester, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, inhibited selectively the PIE and the accumulation of [3H]inositol monophosphate induced by endothelin-1 as well as those of myocardial alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation in a concentration that did not (10(-8) M) or only slightly (10(-7) M) reduced the PIE of BAY K 8644. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate did not affect the specific binding of 125I-labeled endothelin-1 in the ventricular membrane fraction of the rabbit. The present findings indicate that the characteristics of the endothelin-induced PIE in mammalian ventricular myocardium are similar to those of myocardial alpha 1-adrenoceptor activation that may involve phosphoinositide hydrolysis. The receptor density and the PIE of endothelin on mammalian cardiac muscle show a wide range of variation among species.", 
    "89": "The effect of isoproterenol on the electrophysiological properties of the S2 proximal segment of the rabbit was examined. Isoproterenol at 10(-8) to 10(-4) M depolarized the basolateral membrane voltage (Vb) in a dose-dependent manner. Propranolol attenuated the isoproterenol-induced depolarization. These possible mechanisms of cell depolarization were explored. The role of luminal Na(+)-organic solute cotransport was negligible, since the removal of organic solute did not change the depolarization. Basolateral Na(+)-(HCO3-) cotransport was supported by the finding that 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid inhibited isoproterenol-induced depolarization. Basolateral K+ conductance was suggested by the finding that the application of Ba2+ blocked the isoproterenol-induced depolarization. Na(+)-K(+)-adenosine-triphosphatase (ATPase) was questionable. Although ouabain blocked isoproterenol-induced depolarization, the removal of Na+ did not inhibit the depolarization. Further experiment revealed that dibutylyl-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), 8-bromo cAMP, and forskolin did not mimic the response of isoproterenol. These results demonstrate: 1) there is a functional beta-adrenoceptor that depolarizes Vb; 2) isoproterenol-induced depolarization is due to an inhibition of basolateral K+ channel or the activation of basolateral Na(+)-(HCO3-)n cotransport; 3) isoproteronol-induced depolarization is independent of cAMP in the rabbit proximal tubule.", 
    "90": "Hearts isolated from 1-yr-old non-insulin-dependent diabetic rats exhibited reduced responsiveness to the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. Over a concentration range of 3 x 10(-9) to 10(-7) M, isoproterenol-mediated stimulation in the rate of left ventricular pressure decline, a measure of myocardial relaxation, and the rate of left ventricular pressure rise, a measure of myocardial contractility, were significantly depressed in the diabetic hearts. To clarify the basis for this defect, individual steps involved in the actions of the beta-adrenergic agonists were examined. Dihydroalprenolol binding assays revealed that neither beta-adrenergic receptor number nor binding affinity was affected by the diabetic condition. Also unaffected by diabetes was isoproterenol-mediated stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity, myocyte accumulation of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), or the increase in cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity ratio. However, it was found that both in the presence and absence of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, activity of the sarcolemmal calcium transporter was significantly depressed in the diabetic heart. Also attenuated was protein kinase-induced enhancement of sarcoplasmic reticular calcium transport. The likelihood that these abnormalities contribute to alterations in calcium homeostasis and myocardial contractile function is discussed.", 
    "91": "Resistance, pulse wave velocity, and wave reflections have been shown to be increased in patients with essential hypertension compared with normotensive controls. These alterations are completely normalized by nitroprusside infusion but exacerbated during beta-adrenergic blockade, suggesting an enhanced smooth muscle tone that is in part modulated by adrenergically mediated vasodilation. The present study was performed to examine the extent to which this apparently enhanced smooth muscle tone is a result of alpha-adrenergically mediated vasoconstriction.", 
    "92": "Age-matched normotensive and hypertensive Chinese subjects were instrumented with catheter-tipped micromanometers and an electromagnetic flow velocity sensor positioned in the ascending aorta. Aortic impedance and wave reflection properties were obtained from Fourier analysis of the pressure and flow signals during baseline conditions, after beta-blockade with propranolol (0.15 mg/kg i.v.), and after alpha-blockade with intravenous phentolamine (range, 15-80 mg) that was sufficient to either normalize blood pressure or produce a pressure that could not be further lowered. Compared with normotensives, in the baseline state, hypertensives had elevated resistance (1,962 versus 1,268 dyne.sec/cm5, p less than 0.001), total power (1,893 versus 1,568 mW, p less than 0.08), reflected pressure wave component (25.6 versus 13.5 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), ratio of reflected to forward wave (0.65 versus 0.42, p less than 0.001), and pulse wave velocity as determined from the frequency of the first zero-crossing of impedance phase angle (4.6 versus 3.5 Hz, p less than 0.03). During combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade, blood pressure decreased into the normal range (from 162/103 to 131/87 mm Hg) but was still somewhat higher than that in the normotensive subjects. Resistance (1,914 dyne.sec/cm5, p less than 0.03), reflected wave (19.5 mm Hg, p less than 0.01), and ratio of reflected to forward wave (0.61, p less than 0.001) were, however, persistently elevated above normal values.",

    "94": "We measured the content and activities of components of the beta-adrenergic receptor-G protein-adenylate cyclase complex and adrenergic neurotransmitter levels in left and right ventricular myocardial preparations derived from 77 end-stage failing human hearts from patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) or ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (ISCDC).", 
    "95": "The results were compared with data obtained in 21 nonfailing hearts removed from organ donors. Compared with ISCDC ventricles, IDC left and right ventricles exhibited a greater degree of total beta- or beta 1-receptor downregulation. In contrast, compared with IDC right ventricles, isolated tissue preparations of ISCDC right ventricles exhibited a greater degree of subsensitivity to the inotropic effect of isoproterenol, indicating a relatively greater degree of functional uncoupling of right ventricular ISCDC beta-receptors from mechanical response. In addition, relative to IDC left ventricles, preparations of ISCDC left ventricle exhibited greater subsensitivity to beta-agonist-mediated adenylate cyclase stimulation, indicating functional uncoupling of left ventricular ISCDC beta-receptors from cyclic AMP generation. The uncoupling of beta-receptors in ISCDC left and right ventricles may have been a result of abnormalities in G protein activation of adenylate cyclase; compared with age- and cardiac function-matched respective left or right IDC ventricles, ISCDC left ventricles exhibited less stimulation of adenylate cyclase by NaF or forskolin but no change in Mn2+ stimulation, whereas ISCDC right ventricles exhibited less stimulation by the nonhydrolyzable guanine nucleotide Gpp (NH)p. Also, IDC right ventricles exhibited a \"selective\" (not present in IDC left ventricles or ISCDC ventricles) decrease in stimulation of adenylate cyclase by Mn2+. Tissue neurotransmitter levels and pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP ribosylation were altered to similar extents in IDC and ISCDC:",

    "97": "In the present work we evaluated the interactions of adrenergic receptors with phospholipase-C (PLC) and protein kinase-C (PKC), using an in vitro system of hypothalamic neurons and astroglial cells in primary cultures. The study was performed on immature neurons after 7 days in vitro (7 Div), that is before synaptogenesis, as well as on mature cells (14 Div). Comparisons were made between neurons and glial cells at the corresponding developmental stages. Norepinephrine (NE) increased inositol phosphates (IPs) formation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The NE effect was mediated by alpha 1-receptor (alpha 1R) and was observed in young cells before synaptogenesis as well as in mature neuronal cultures; its amplitude was enhanced during the latter stage of the neuronal development. The coupling of alpha 1R with PLC was partially sensitive to pertussis toxin treatment and did not implicate the activation of calcium voltage-dependent channels. Activation of PKC by 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) inhibited in a time-dependent manner the NE-stimulated production of IPs in young and mature hypothalamic neurons; however, in PKC depleted cells NE-induced IPs formation remained unchanged. In hypothalamic astroglial cell cultures the adrenergic stimulus of IPs generation was also mediated by alpha 1R. The effect was observed at both developmental stages, with a greater response in 14 Div cultures, and was insensitive to pertussis toxin treatment. As in neurons, activation of PKC resulted in inhibition of NE-induced IPs formation. These data indicate that functional interrelation between alpha 1R, PLC, and PKC is already present in immature neurons and glial cells and progressively develops in culture.", 
    "98": "Estrogen increases the alpha 1-adrenergic contractile sensitivity of the rabbit uterus. Since estrogen treatment increases prostaglandin (PG) production by the perfused rabbit uterus, and PGs contribute to the alpha 1-adrenergic contractile response, we postulated that estrogen's effects on PG production or response may play a role in the increased alpha 1-adrenergic sensitivity induced by estrogen. We studied the effects of the eicosanoid synthesis inhibitor meclofenamate (60 microM) on the response to epinephrine (10(-9)-10(-5) M) of uterine strips from ovariectomized, mature, and estrogen-treated rabbits in terms of both contractile response and PGE2 and PGF2 alpha production. We also measured the contractile response to PGE2 and PGF2 alpha (both 10(-10)-10(-5) M) and KCl (70 mM) of uterine strips from these groups. We found that in the ovariectomized rabbits, meclofenamate decreased PG production, but did not alter the alpha 1-adrenergic sensitivity. In the mature rabbit uterus, meclofenamate decreased both PGE2 and PGF2 alpha production and reduced the alpha 1-adrenergic sensitivity. In the estrogen-treated rabbit uterus, meclofenamate decreased PGF2 alpha, but not PGE2, production and did not alter the alpha 1-adrenergic sensitivity. Finally, meclofenamate reduced the contractile response to KCl in all three groups, and exposure to PGE2 increased the contractile response to KCl in both the mature and estrogen-treated rabbits. We conclude that PGs play a role in the increase in the alpha 1-adrenergic sensitivity of the uterus in mature rabbits, and that this may be the result of an estrogen-mediated alteration in the postreceptor effects of PGs.", 
    "99": "ACh causes a long-lasting inhibition of STOCs via G proteins in intestinal smooth muscle cells. We examined the effects of isoproterenol (Iso) on the ACh-induced inhibition of STOCs in isolated ileal smooth muscle cells using the G omega-seal whole cell clamp technique. In control, ACh (1 microM) completely suppressed STOCs, which did not desensitize over a period lasting 20 minutes. When Iso (10 microM) was added to the bath in the presence of ACh, the ACh-induced inhibition of STOCs was gradually removed. This effect of Iso was prevented by propranolol (10 microM). Application of Db-cAMP (500 microM) mimicked the Iso effects. Intracellulary applied GTP-gamma S (100 microM) gradually suppressed STOCs in the absence of ACh, which could not be removed by either Iso or Db-cAMP. These results suggest that beta-adrenergic stimulation causes a removal of the muscarinic inhibition of STOCs via a cAMP-dependent process.", 
    "100": "The effect of a novel ligand for the 5-HT1A receptor subtype, MDL 73005EF, on the firing rate of serotonergic dorsal raphe neurons was assessed in rat midbrain slices maintained in vitro. Superfusion with MDL 73005EF inhibited neuronal firing in a concentration-dependent manner. Based upon IC50 values, MDL 73005EF was equipotent with buspirone (129 +/- 34 vs. 97 +/- 8 nM, respectively) but significantly less potent than 8-OH-DPAT (8-hydroxy-2(di-n-propylamino)tetralin; 7 +/- 2 nM). Pretreatment with (-)-propranolol (1 microM), a mixed 5-HT1A/B receptor antagonist, blocked by 50% the inhibition of unit activity elicited by MDL 73005EF. Taken together, these data suggest that MDL 73005EF is an agonist at the somatodendritic autoreceptor on dorsal raphe neurons, a 5-HT1A receptor which regulates in part the pacemaker activity of these cells. The results are discussed in the context of receptor reserve, recently proposed to explain apparent discrepancies in the actions of agonists at pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT1A sites.", 
    "101": "To determine the free concentration of a drug (propranolol) in the interstitial space in humans in vivo, seven male students were investigated by microdialysis of the periumbilical subcutaneous tissue. The microdialysis catheters were calibrated in vivo and the propranolol concentration was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Ten hours after intake of 80 mg of propranolol, the total plasma and free interstitial propranolol concentrations were 80 +/- 43 and 7 +/- 2 nM, respectively. After a second dose, maximum concentration was reached after 80 +/- 10 min and 98 +/- 12 min, in plasma, and the concentrations in the interstitial water were 594 +/- 138 and 27 +/- 7 nM, respectively. In a second study, microdialysis was performed on the left ventricular wall in six pigs receiving an intravenous injection of 5 mg of propranolol followed by a constant propranolol infusion for 40 min (5 mg propranolol per h). The maximum concentrations of propranolol were 97 +/- 29 and 6 +/- 2 nM in plasma and in interstitial water, respectively. The data suggest that microdialysis is a useful tool for recording the free concentrations of a drug in the interstitial space."
