    "0": "Despite widespread use of hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA) in aneurysm surgery and for repair of congenital heart defects, there is continued concern about possible adverse cerebral sequelae. The search for ways to improve implementation of HCA has inspired retrospective clinical studies to try to identify risk factors for cerebral injury, and clinical and laboratory investigations to explore the physiology of HCA. At present, risk factors associated with less favorable cerebral outcome after HCA include: prolonged duration of HCA (usually greater than 60 min); advanced patient age; rapid cooling (less than 20 min); hyperglycemia either before HCA or during reperfusion; preoperative cyanosis or lack of adequate hemodilution; evidence of increased oxygen extraction before HCA or during reperfusion; and delayed reappearance of electroencephalogram (EEG) or marked EEG abnormality. Strategies advocated to increase safety of HCA include: pretreatment with barbiturates and steroids; use of alpha-stat pH regulation during cooling and rewarming; intraoperative monitoring of EEG; slow and adequate cooling, including packing of the head in ice; monitoring of jugular venous oxygen content; hemodilution; and avoidance of hyperglycemia. Current investigation focuses on delineating the relationship of cerebral blood flow (CBF) to cerebral oxygen consumption and glucose metabolism during cooling, HCA, rewarming, and later recovery, and identifying changes in acute intraoperative parameters, including the presence of intracerebral enzymes in cerebral spinal fluid, with cerebral outcome as assessed by neurological evaluation, quantitative EEG, and postmortem histology. Clinically, intraoperative monitoring of EEG and measurement of CBF by tracer washout or Doppler flows are contributing to better understanding of the physiology of HCA, and in the laboratory, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has provided valuable insights into the kinetics of intracerebral energy metabolism. Promising strategies for the future include investigation of other pharmacological agents to increase cerebral protection, and use of \"cerebroplegia\" or intermittent perfusion between intervals of HCA to improve cerebral tolerance for longer durations of HCA.", 
    "1": "Rats were treated chronically with epinephrine (EPI-T; 100 micrograms/kg/hr, s.c.) for 6 days. On day 6 of treatment, the rats were anesthetized and the mesenteric vascular bed was isolated and perfused with Krebs' bicarbonate buffer containing cocaine (10 microM) and corticosterone (40 microM). Stimulus-induced (2 Hz, 120 pulses) overflow of neurotransmitter and its modulation by prejunctional adrenoceptors was studied. After chronic exposure to EPI, 50% of the mesenteric catecholamine stores consisted of EPI with no increase in total catecholamine content as compared to the control group (C). Absolute and fractional overflows of catecholamines upon periarterial nerve stimulation (2 Hz, 1 min) were not significantly different in the two groups. Beta adrenoceptor blockade by propranolol (10(-10) to 10(-6) M) did not alter the overflow of catecholamines. Alpha adrenoceptor blockade by phentolamine (10(-5) M) increased neurotransmitter overflow in both EPI-T and C groups. However, there was no significant difference in total catecholamine overflows between the two groups. Moreover, in the presence of phentolamine, propranolol (10(-6) M) remained without effect on overflow in both groups. These data suggest that EPI-T did not significantly increase the stimulus-induced overflow of catecholamines in the rat mesentery, nor did EPI-T result in prejunctional beta adrenoceptor modulation of neurotransmitter release in the mesenteric vascular bed.", 
    "2": "The effect of age and gender on the stereoselective pharmacokinetics of propranolol was studied in 12 young (25 to 33 years old) and 12 elderly (62 to 79 years old) healthy nonsmoking volunteers, half of whom were female. Racemic propranolol was administered (80 mg p.o.) each 8 hr for seven doses. Serum was obtained just before (0 time) and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hr after the final dose and analyzed for propranolol enantiomers. The serum concentration of alpha-1 acid glycoprotein was determined before propranolol administration. The binding of each enantiomer to serum proteins was determined in samples obtained before propranolol administration and two hr after the final dose of propranolol. We found that the intrinsic hepatic clearance of S-propranolol was about 30% smaller in the elderly than in the young, whether it was calculated for total or unbound drug. Additionally, the elimination half-lives of both enantiomers were 2- to 3-fold prolonged in the elderly compared with the young. In all subjects regardless of age or sex the intrinsic hepatic clearance of the total (bound plus free) S-isomer was smaller than that of the R-isomer. There was no age-related difference in alpha-1 acid glycoprotein concentration or protein binding of either enantiomer of propranolol. However, there was a gender-related difference with the females having significantly greater binding of the S-enantiomer than the males.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "3": "Transient atrioventricular (AV) block has been reported during adenosine thallium imaging. This study examined the predictors and hemodynamic implications in 55 patients who had second- or third-degree AV block (group 1) and compared the results with those in 803 patients who did not have AV block (group 2). There were no significant differences in age, sex, or heart rate at baseline between the two groups. ST segment depression was observed in 25% of patients in group 1 and 16% in group 2 (p = NS). Chest pain occurred in 56% in group 1 and 44% in group 2 (p = NS). Preexisting conduction abnormalities (17% vs 16%) and treatment with digitalis (15% vs 15%) and beta-blockers (31% vs 36%) were similar in the two groups. The results of thallium imaging were abnormal in 66% in group 1 and 67% in group 2 (p = NS). Reversible thallium defects were seen in 51% in group 1 and 52% in group 2 (p = NS). The AV block appeared during the first 2 minutes of infusion in 40 patients (73%) and disappeared despite continuation of infusion in 43 (78%). The heart rate during AV block was 79 +/- 18 beats/min, and the systolic blood pressure was 127 +/- 27 mm Hg. Premature termination of adenosine infusion was required in one patient (2%). Aminophylline was used in 5% in group 1 and 2% in group 2 (p = NS). Thus AV block is transient, occurs during the early minutes of infusion, is not aggravated by digitalis or beta-blocker therapy, can be seen in patients with normal perfusion images, and is often well tolerated.", 
    "4": "The adrenergic control of intact PTH secretion was investigated by measuring its plasma concentration during insulin-induced hypoglycemia in normal human subjects under control conditions (n = 12) and after alpha (n = 5)- or beta (n = 6)-adrenoceptor blockade. Blood samples were taken at baseline, at the time of the acute hypoglycemic reaction, and at regular intervals for 60 min thereafter. Plasma concentrations of intact PTH, catecholamines, total calcium, magnesium, albumin, phosphate, and glucose were measured in all subjects, and plasma ionized calcium was also assayed in three subjects during acute hypoglycemia without pharmacological blockade. At the time of the acute hypoglycemic reaction, the plasma concentration of intact PTH in the control subjects fell to 60.8% of baseline values and was accompanied by a small but significant increase in plasma total calcium. Intact PTH concentrations remained suppressed after the plasma calcium concentration had returned to normal. The two groups of subjects who were exposed to adrenoceptor blockade exhibited a reduced fall in plasma intact PTH and showed no significant increase in plasma total calcium. Therefore, insulin-induced acute hypoglycemia was associated with a fall in plasma intact PTH. Adrenoceptor blockade reduced, but did not abolish, the response, suggesting that other factors are involved.", 
    "5": "One hundred thirty-one patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) a mean of 3 hours after the onset of symptoms were treated with oral aspirin and intravenous thrombolytic therapy followed by heparin. One hundred eleven patients (85%) also received intravenous followed by oral beta blockers. Twenty-one patients (19%) discontinued the beta blocker because of complications. Five (4.5%) required the addition of diuretic drugs or converting enzyme inhibitors. Six patients (5%) discontinued the beta blocker after complete mechanical revascularization, and 1 patient was noncompliant. Long-term treatment continued in 90 patients (69%) over a 2-year follow-up period (average 13 months). There were 3 infarct extensions and 3 reinfarctions (5%). Overall mortality at 2 years was 10%. Intravenous beta blockers are well tolerated in most patients treated with thrombolytic agents, aspirin and heparin. They may further improve the survival benefit of chronic beta blocker therapy in the period after AMI.", 
    "6": "To assess central effects of endothelin-1 (ET-1) on plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP), plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), blood pressure, heart rate, and renal solute excretion, ET-1 dissolved in the artificial cerebrospinal fluid was infused intracerebroventricularly (icv) at a dose of either 0.35 ng.kg-1.min-1 (0.14 pmol; LET) or 3.5 ng.kg-1.min-1 (1.4 pmol; HET) for 45 min in conscious rats. In the control study, ET-1 was omitted from the vehicle. Moreover, [1-(beta-mercapto-beta,beta-cyclopentamethylenepropionic acid),2-O-methyl-tyrosine]AVP (TMeAVP), a V1-blocker, and prazosin, an alpha 1-blocker, were peripherally administered. In the LET group, mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) increased without any changes in heart rate, plasma AVP and ANP, and renal solute excretion. In the HET group, MABP markedly increased with rises in plasma AVP and ANP, but urine flow, urinary osmolality, and urinary Na and K excretion decreased. TMeAVP attenuated the pressor response to ET-1, abolished rises in plasma ANP, and partially restored falls in urine flow. Prazosin after TMeAVP obviated the pressor response to ET-1. In the control, these parameters did not change, except for an increase in urinary solute excretion. These results showed that icv ET-1 stimulates the sympathetic nervous activity and plasma AVP, leading to increased blood pressure and renal vasoconstriction, with a reduction in renal water and electrolyte excretion.", 
    "7": "A multicenter, randomized double-blind study of 6 months' duration was performed in 540 patients (average age 54 years, 57% male) with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension to determine the relative effects on quality of life of cilazapril, atenolol, and nifedipine retard. Quality of life was assessed by using both a self-administered and an interviewer-administered questionnaire; the assessment included a complaint score (symptoms checklist), Health Status Index, assessment of work satisfaction, Psychological General Well-being Index, Profile of Mood States subscales, and life satisfaction assessment. Psychomotor function was measured by the Reitan Trail Making test B. At the end of the trial, diastolic blood pressure had fallen by an average of 15 mm Hg in all three groups, but significantly (p = 0.01) more patients taking cilazapril required the addition of a diuretic (36%) compared with those taking atenolol (25%) or nifedipine retard (24%). No significant differences in quality of life were observed between cilazapril and atenolol during the trial. Symptomatic complaints increased on nifedipine retard (p = 0.02) and contributed to a higher discontinuation rate (21% discontinued treatment compared with 13% and 14% taking atenolol and cilazapril, respectively, p = 0.04). However, a possible improvement in the fatigue subscale (p = 0.04) was also observed on nifedipine retard. The 95% confidence intervals showed that none of the drugs in this trial produced an effect equivalent to that previously reported between captopril and methyldopa in the Psychological General Well Being Index or between captopril and methyldopa or propranolol in Trail Making test B.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "8": "Mild electric foot-shock has been shown to be a stressor that can alter immune responses. Male Lewis rats were exposed to one session of 16 5.0-s 1.6-mA foot-shocks. Production of interferon-gamma by splenocytes in response to concanavalin-A was decreased in spleens from the shocked rats compared to control spleens. Spleen cells from rats treated with nadolol, a peripherally acting beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, and then shocked, showed dose-dependent attenuation of the suppression of interferon-gamma production. This suggests that catecholamines mediate shock-induced suppression of interferon-gamma production. The percentage of splenic mononuclear cells expressing class II histocompatibility (Ia) antigens on their surfaces from spleens of shocked rats was determined by flow cytometry. Significantly decreased class II positive mononuclear cells were present in the spleens of shocked rats in comparison to the spleens of control rats. This may reflect an alteration of cell trafficking or decreased production of class II antigens.", 
    "9": "Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) was administered to 13 pediatric renal allograft recipients, ages 7.6 to 17.7 yr, who were 14 to 92 months posttransplant and growth retarded as manifested by either a standard deviation (SD) more negative than -2.00 or a height velocity index of less than 25%. The rhGH was given either daily or thrice weekly (0.375 mg/kg/wk) for a period of 12 to 36 months. Growth velocity increased from 2.7 +/- 2.1 SD for the 12-month period before the initiation of treatment of 6.3 +/- 2.9 SD (P less than 0.00005) and 5.2 +/- 2.9 SD (P less than 0.02) after 12 and 24 months of treatment, respectively. Although individual recipients had improvement in their SD scores, the mean values did not increase despite the increased growth velocity. Except for a 0.5-yr increase over 24 months in two recipients, the bone age did not increase at a rate greater than the increase in chronologic age. Four rejection episodes occurred in two recipients during rhGH treatment--an incidence not greater than that which occurred during a comparable time interval before the initiation of treatment. The calculated creatinine clearance declined from 66 +/- 26 SD mL/min/1.73 m2 at the initiation of treatment to 55 +/- 30 SD mL/min/1.73 m2 at 24 months and 52 +/- 28 SD mL/min/1.73 m2 (P = not significant).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "10": "Changes of lipid peroxidation products and activity of the antioxidant system during corinfar and anaprilin treatment were studied in 36 patients with hypertensive disease (stage II). A decrease of the content of malondialdehyde and dien conjugates was revealed in the blood of these patients after a course of treatment with these agents. Simultaneously, the antioxidant protection of the blood increased: the concentration of reduced glutathione increased, the activity of glutathione peroxidase rose. The changes of oxidated glutathione were not clear. It is suggested that such character of the effect of corinfar and anaprilin on the processes of lipid peroxidation is the result of a direct effect on lipid peroxidation products and also compensatory activation of enzymatic reactions of restoration of natural cellular antioxidants as well as enzymatic system directly utilizing lipoperoxides.", 
    "11": "The antihypertensive efficacy of combination therapy with N-E-A was evaluated during 6 months in 15 patients with hypertension associated with mild to moderate kidney failure. After 6 months a significant reduction of SBP and DBP (p < 0.001), with improvement of creatinine clearance and with no adverse effects on ECG, heart rate and routine laboratory tests test, was observed in 3 patients treated with N 20 mg x 2/d + E 10 mg/d + A 50 mg/d and in 8 patients treated with N 20 mg x 3 + E 10 mg x 2, + A 50 mg x 2. Four patients did not respond to this therapy.", 
    "12": "The antihypertensive and metabolic effects of betaxolol (20 mg/day) were monitored in 40 patients (17 male), aged 54 +/- 2 yr (mean +/- SEM), with moderate essential hypertension. In a subgroup, consisting of 35 obese patients with a Quetelet index greater than 25.0, blood pressure, heart rate, side effects and biochemical variables were registered bi-monthly for a period of 6 months and after a placebo run-in and run-out period of 2 weeks. Betaxolol decreased blood pressure from 165 +/- 3/107 +/- 1 to 151 +/- 3/95 +/- 2 mmHg after 2 weeks and further to 151 +/- 3/93 +/- 2 mmHg after 6 months (p less than 0.001). Ninety percent of the patients responded to therapy with betaxolol. Heart rate fell from 77 +/- 2 to 64 +/- 1 bpm (p less than 0.001). No significant changes were observed in levels of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol or HDL-cholesterol. Triglycerides tended to increase from 2.2 +/- 0.3 to 2.8 +/- 0.4 mmol/l after 4 months of treatment (NS). Renal function was not influenced by betaxolol. Side effects, recorded on a standard questionnaire, did not differ between betaxolol and placebo. In conclusion, betaxolol in a fixed dose of 20 mg/day is an effective antihypertensive drug in the long-term treatment of obese, hypertensive patients, without adverse effects on lipoproteins.", 
    "13": "The distribution of metoprolol tartrate (MPL) into the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from plasma was determined at 2 different steady-state plasma concentrations (2 and 20 nmol/ml) and following intravenous bolus administration (100 nmol/kg) in rats. Under steady-state condition, no difference in the brain and CSF distributions of MPL was observed between 2 different plasma MPL concentrations, and the value of brain- or CSF-to-plasma partition coefficients were 5.7 and 1.5, respectively. Following intravenous administration, MPL distributed into CSF very rapidly and its initial uptake phase was not detected. On the other hand, MPL distribution into the brain was relatively slow with the uptake phase. Thus, the brain uptake of MPL from the plasma was pharmacokinetically analyzed using a modified 2-compartment model and deconvolution method, whereas the CSF distribution of MPL was not adequate for kinetic analysis because of the lack of uptake phase. The analysis of brain uptake of MPL by both compartment model and deconvolution gave the same results and the calculated brain Kp value of MPL was almost comparable with that of observed Kp value under steady-state plasma concentration. The distribution of MPL into CSF was considered mainly depending on the pH difference between the plasma and CSF, and the mutual transfer of MPL between CSF and the brain tissue was considered to be negligible from an in vitro study.", 
    "14": "Distinctly different from the other beta-blocking agents, sotalol prolongs action potential duration in myocardial and Purkinje fibers, and increases atrial as well as ventricular effective refractory periods. Similarly, antegrade and retrograde accessory pathway refractory periods are increased by sotalol. The electrophysiologic and clinical effects of sotalol were studied in 40 patients (31 male and 9 female, mean age 32 +/- 14 years) with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome (WPW). All patients had disabling episodes of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (ST). Of the 40 patients, 15 (37%) had spontaneous recurrence of paroxysmal supraventricular reciprocating tachycardia (PSRT), 14 (35%) of atrial fibrillation (AF) and 11 (28%) of both PSRT and AF. All of the patients were non responders to serial transesophageal electropharmacological tests using I C class drugs. Sotalol 252 +/- 73 mg daily was administered, and, in steady-state, a new transesophageal study (TS) was performed to observe the re-induction of PSRT and/or AF. 34 patients (85%) were responders to TS (noninducibility of ST, or nonsustained ST or AF inducibility with an increase of 30% in the minimum R-R interval between pre-excitated beats during AF) and the results were confirmed during a follow-up of 17 +/- 9 months. In the non-responder group (5 patients), a I C class drug was associated with sotalol. One patient, who was a \"non responder\" to sotalol, sotalol + I C class drug, and to amiodarone, underwent surgical therapy. In the 26 patients (65%) who had episodes of PSRT (37%) or episodes of PSRT and AF (28%), it was impossible to reinduce PSRT in 85% of the cases. AF was induced at baseline in all of the studied patients, but after sotalol administration in 15 patients, it was impossible to reinduce AF. The rate of induced AF decreased from 208 +/- 39 beats/min to 156 +/- 36 beats/min (p < 0.001). The mean shortest R-R interval between pre-excitated beats increased from 214 +/- 35 (baseline) to 293 +/- 97 msec (sotalol steady state) (p < 0.001). No side effects were observed. A significant prolongation (p < 0.001) of the QTc interval was observed in all the patients after sotalol administration (from 0.39 +/- 0.2 to 0.42 +/- 0.02 sec.). On the basis of our results, we may conclude that sotalol has a potent effect on the antegrade refractoriness of the anomalous pathway and, in WPW syndrome at risk, is also effective in patients who don't respond to I C class drugs.", 
    "15": "The maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) after oral administration of 120 mg tablets of slow-release metoprolol (CAS 37350-58-6) to 75 Japanese healthy male volunteers and 15 arrhythmic patients were measured. Extensive and poor metabolizers after oral administrations of slow-release metoprolol tablets were classified by means of the frequency distribution of Cmax values. In addition, the frequency distribution of Cmax values after oral administration of slow-release metoprolol 120 mg tablets was compared with that of conventional metoprolol 40 mg tablets. 1. Mean +/- S.E. values of Cmax, tmax and AUC0-24 after oral administration of slow-release metoprolol tablets to 75 healthy male volunteers and 15 arrhythmic patients were 95.3 +/- 6.6 ng/ml, 4.4 +/- 0.2 h and 1000.4 +/- 70.9 ng.h/ml, respectively. 2. The number of poor metoprolol metabolizers after the oral administration of slow-release tablets in 75 healthy volunteers and 15 patients was estimated to be 2 subjects (2.2%). 3. The frequency distribution of Cmax values after oral administration of conventional metoprolol tablets was similar to that of slow-release metoprolol tablets. In addition, from the result of this study and that obtained in another study, in which the frequency of poor metoprolol metabolizers in British people has been examined, it is concluded that the frequency of poor metoprolol metabolizers varies between ethnic groups (2.2% in Japanese population and 11.3% in British population.", 
    "16": "To clarify a relationship between dopamine neuron and purine, GABA or benzodiazepine system, we have studied the changes in the threshold of tonic convulsion induced by each antagonist after chronic treatment with haloperidol in mice. Mice were given haloperidol (1 mg/kg, sc) once a day for 19 d and challenged with caffeine (an adenosine receptor antagonist), beta-DMCM (beta-carboline derivative: as a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist), picrotoxin (a Cl- channel blocker) or bicuculline (a GABAa receptor antagonist) 30 min, 24 h and 48 h after the last injection of haloperidol. Only the threshold of beta-DMCM-induced tonic convulsion was lowered and it was reversed 7 d after the last injection. The beta-DMCM-induced convulsions on 2 d withdrawal were reversed by diazepam (2.5 mg/kg, ip; a benzodiazepine receptor agonist), Ro15-1788 (5.0 mg/kg, ip; as like a benzodiazepine receptor partial agonist), muscimol (2.0 mg/kg, ip; a GABAa receptor agonist) or apomorphine (0.25 and 2.0 mg/kg, ip; a dopamine receptor agonist). These results suggest that the lowering effect of chronic haloperidol on seizure threshold may be involved in the development of tolerance to haloperidol. It may implicate in direct interactions between benzodiazepine and dopamine or GABA systems but may not between dopamine and GABA neurons in development of lowering seizure threshold following chronic haloperidol treatment.", 
    "17": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of labetalol were assessed after a single oral and intravenous dose in eight patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) maintained on chronic hemodialysis, and in eight age-and sex-matched normal volunteers. The mean area under the serum concentration-time curve, volume of distribution, clearance, and terminal elimination half-life values after a single intravenous dose of 0.5 mg/kg of labetalol were not significantly different between ESRD patients and normal volunteers. Similarly, the absolute bioavailability of an oral dose of 200 mg of labetalol was 0.33 in ESRD patients and was not significantly different from that of normal volunteers (0.26). However, a significant decrease in the area under the mean blood pressure-time curve was found after a single oral dose in ESRD patients, which was not observed in normal volunteers. The pharmacokinetics of labetalol were not associated with changes in blood pressure. Thus, when given orally to the ESRD patient, labetalol should be slowly titrated and the blood pressure closely monitored.", 
    "18": "We examined the utility of the postdose 3-h plasma metabolic ratio (MR) as a phenotyping method for assessing genetically determined debrisoquine-type oxidation polymorphism after an oral dose of 100 mg of metoprolol tartrate administered to 402 unrelated, healthy, and native East Asian (218 Korean and 184 Japanese) subjects. All of them were phenotyped simultaneously with the reported MR employing urine samples collected during an 8-h postdose period. In the two populations, the distribution histograms and probit plots of log10plasma MRs derived from the metoprolol/alpha-hydroxymetoprolol concentration values indicated a large gap between the extensive and poor metabolizers who were phenotyped by the reported criteria of the 8-h urinary MR. There were statistically significant (p less than 0.001) correlations (rs = 0.688 and 0.810, respectively) between the postdose urinary and plasma MRs in the Korean and Japanese populations. Two poor metabolizers (one each included in the two racial groups) identified according to the 8-h urinary MR gave the greatest plasma MRs (i.e., 549.7 among the Koreans and 150.0 among the Japanese). The results suggest that the one-point, postdose 3-h plasma MR is also useful for the phenotyping purpose of oxidation pharmacogenetic polymorphism of metoprolol, a widely prescribed beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug.", 
    "19": "Anxiolytic drugs, such as the benzodiazepines and the azapirones (ipsapirone, gepirone, buspirone), are well known to affect states of vigilance and to decrease the firing rate of serotoninergic neurones within the dorsal raphe nucleus in rats. In order to examine whether the newly developed 5-HT3 antagonists with potential anxiolytic properties act through similar mechanisms, the effects of several of such antagonists: MDL 72222, ICS 205-930, ondansetron and/or zacopride on both sleep-wakefulness and the discharge of serotoninergic neurones within the dorsal raphe nucleus were investigated in rats. When tested in a wide range of doses (0.05-10 mg/kg, i.p.), none of these drugs significantly affected the states of vigilance, except ondansetron, at 0.1 mg/kg, which increased paradoxical sleep for the first 2 hr after administration and MDL 72222, at 10 mg/kg, which reduced both paradoxical and slow wave sleep and increased wakefulness for the same initial period after treatment. In vivo, in chloral hydrate anaesthetized rats, as well as in vitro, in slices of brain stem, none of the 5-HT3 antagonists tested affected the firing rate of serotoninergic neurones. Similarly, no change in the electrical activity of serotoninergic neurones could be evoked in vitro by superfusion of the tissue with the 5-HT3 agonists, phenylbiguanide (10 microM) and 2-methyl-5-HT (1 microM). At a larger concentration (10 microM), the latter compound reduced the neuronal discharge probably through the stimulation of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors since this effect, as that of ipsapirone, could be prevented by 10 microM l-propranolol. Comparison of these data with those obtained with benzodiazepines and 5-HT1A agonists of the azapirone series, supports the concept that different mechanisms are responsible for the anxiolytic-like properties of 5-HT3 agonists, compared to those of other anxiolytic drugs.", 
    "20": "The paper compares the data of selective coronary angiography and 24-hour monitoring in 39 patients with refractory angina pectoris. Transient ST-segment changes were revealed in 79% of the patients, ST-segment depression occurring in 54%, ST-segment elevation in 46%, T-wave inversion in 38%. A combination of ST-T interval changes and occurrence of ventricular premature contraction was found in a third of the examinees. There was no statistically significant correlation between the extent of major coronary lesion and the mean length of ST-segment displacements.", 
    "21": "We report a case of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) apparently induced by topical use of ophthalmic timolol maleate, a beta adrenergic blocking agent. The patient developed fever, malaise, pleurisy and recurrent sterile pleural effusions while taking no medication other than timolol. Antinuclear antibodies in a homogenous pattern, and markedly elevated histone antibodies (IgG anti-(H2A-H2B)-DNA) were present while antibodies to native DNA were absent. After discontinuation of the timolol, his symptoms improved promptly and the pleural effusions resolved. To our knowledge, this is the first report of timolol induced SLE.", 
    "22": "A controlled, randomized, single-blind, parallel-group study compared the effects of nicardipine hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) with those of pindolol/HCTZ in treatment of essential hypertension. The study included 43 patients aged 30-64 years with supine diastolic blood pressures between 95 and 125 mmHg at baseline. Patients initially received 50 mg/day HCTZ for 6 weeks and those patients whose diastolic blood pressure remained at or above 90 mmHg at week 6 (n = 29) completed a 6-week comparative phase in which they were given, in addition, either 30 mg nicardipine hydrochloride or 5 mg pindolol three times daily. Nicardipine was more effective than pindolol as a second-line treatment in controlling blood pressure but, because patients who were treated with nicardipine/HCTZ had higher baseline blood pressures, significance was lost when results were adjusted for the baseline blood pressure values. Treatment was described as 'very good' by 71.4% of patients in the nicardipine/HCTZ group and by 53.9% of those in the pindolol/HCTZ group; thus, both second-line antihypertensives were well accepted. Although 45% of patients in of each treatment group reported treatment-related adverse events, none experienced postural hypotension and no adverse event was unexpected.", 
    "23": "The present experiments examined the effect of ketanserin [5-hydroxytryptamine-2 (5-HT2) antagonist] and 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) (5-HT1 agonist) on the in vitro release of luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) from the medial basal hypothalamus-preoptic area-suprachiasmatic nucleus region (MBH-POA-SCN) of ovariectomized (OVX), estradiol-(E2) treated rats using in vitro superfusion techniques. Regularly cycling female Holtzman rats (250-300 g) were maintained on a photoperiod of 0500-1900 h light at 22 +/- 2 degrees C. Rats were ovariectomized (25-30 days) and received Silastic E2 implants (150 micrograms E2/ml sesame oil) SC 48 h prior to the in vitro superfusion. Following a control period of Krebs-Ringer Phosphate (KRP) superfusion, ketanserin (5-HT2 receptor antagonist, 1 x 10(-6) M) significantly increased LHRH release (p less than 0.05). Subsequent superfusion of 5-HT (1 x 10(-8) M) significantly decreased (p less than 0.05) the effect of ketanserin on LHRH release. The 5-HT2 antagonist Lilly 53857 (1 x 10(-6) M or 1 x 10(-5) M) did not increase LHRH release above control levels. Neither 5-HT nor quipazine had a significant effect on LHRH release at 1 x 10(-6) M. Superfusion of 8-OH-DPAT (5-HT1 receptor agonist 1 x 10(-5) M) significantly (p less than 0.01) increased LHRH release but subsequent superfusion of 8-OH-DPAT + pindolol (mixed 5-HT1a,1b and a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, 1 x 10(-6) M) or pindolol alone had no effect on LHRH release. These results suggest that the 5-HT1 receptor plays a role in LHRH release and this effect may be related to the opposing effects of postsynaptic and autoreceptors. However, the failure of Lilly 53857 to reproduce the stimulatory effect of ketanserin on LHRH release suggests that 5-HT2 receptors in the MBH-POA-SCN may not modify LH release during the estrous cycle.", 
    "24": "An in vitro model was used to evaluate the conjunctival penetration of three peptides, [D-ala2]metenkephalinamide (YAGFM, MW 647), substance P (MW 1348), and insulin (MW 5778), in comparison with two nonpeptides, atenolol (MW 266) and timolol (MW 433). All three peptides were hydrolyzed to varying extents during penetration across the conjunctiva. The permeability coefficient for intact YAGFM and insulin was 4.5 +/- 0.3 and 4.6 +/- 0.7 microns sec-1, respectively. These values were about two to five times lower than those for atenolol and timolol. No permeability coefficient could be calculated for substance P, since its transconjunctival flux never reached steady state. The conjunctival penetration of YAGFM and insulin was improved by about two and three times, respectively, with the addition of 1% Na glycocholate. Increasing the Na glycocholate concentration was more effective than changing the type of bile salt in improving the conjunctival penetration of insulin. The maximum factor of improvement was 12, as the Na glycocholate concentration was raised to 4%. The way in which Na deoxycholate, glycocholate, and taurocholate affected the conjunctival penetration of atenolol, timolol, and insulin suggests that these three bile salts improved mainly the transcellular penetration of the compounds studied.", 
    "25": "Bisoprolol 10 mg and atenolol 100 mg once daily were compared regarding efficacy and safety in stable effort angina in a 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study. Efficacy was evaluated with angina pectoris diaries and bicycle exercise tests. Spontaneously mentioned complaints and side effects were recorded at each visit. In 11 centers, 147 patients completed the study; 76 received bisoprolol 10 mg, and 71 received atenolol 100 mg. After 12 weeks, weekly anginal attack rate was reduced significantly (p less than 0.05) with bisoprolol (5 +/- 0.5 to 2 +/- 0.6) and with atenolol (4 +/- 0.4 to 1 +/- 0.2). Peak exercise capacity (in W x min) increased significantly (p less than 0.05) with bisoprolol (772 +/- 47 to 878 +/- 52) and with atenolol (891 +/- 46 to 986 +/- 53). Rate pressure product (RPP) at peak exercise (in beats/min x mm Hg) decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) with both bisoprolol (25,003 +/- 692 to 20,116 +/- 637) and atenolol (26,544 +/- 557 to 21,603 +/- 576) (all values are mean +/- SE). The differences between the groups were not statistically significant. There were no significant differences regarding nature and incidence of adverse events between the groups. Thus, bisoprolol 10 mg once daily and atenolol 100 mg once daily are equipotent in their effects on stable effort angina. Both regimens were comparable with respect to incidence and nature of side effects.", 
    "26": "Neurokinin (NK) peptides such as substance P (SP) may modulate epithelial ion transport in the small intestine. The present study was undertaken to examine the pharmacological mechanisms by which SP and its endogenous homologs NKA and NKB affect active electrolyte transport in the mucosa of porcine jejunum. Neurokinins and NK agonist analogs increased short circuit current, a measure of active ion transport, across sheets of jejunal mucosa-submucosa with the order of potency: SP greater than [beta-Ala8]NKA4-10 greater than or equal to [Sar9,Met(O2)11]SP greater than NKA = Arg-NKB greater than NKB after their addition to the serosal aspect of tissues (SP EC50 = 11 nM). Epithelial responses to SP or NKA underwent rapid autotachyphylaxis and unidirectional cross-tachyphylaxis after repeated peptide administration. The neuronal conduction blocker tetrodotoxin significantly reduced NK efficacy. SP activity was significantly reduced in tissues pretreated with the muscarinic cholinoceptor blocker atropine or the eicosanoid synthesis inhibitor eicosa-5,8,11,14-tetraynoic acid. NK peptides increased contractility in longitudinally oriented strips of jejunal smooth muscle with an order of potency: [Sar9,Met(O2)11]SP greater than SP greater than Arg-NKB = [beta-Ala8]NKA4-10 greater than or equal to NKB = NKA (SP EC50 = 11 nM). SP-induced contractions were reduced by 70 to 80% in tissues pretreated with atropine or the neuronal Ca++ channel blocker, omega-conotoxin.

Antibody labelled necrotic cardiomyocytes from male Sprague-Dawley rats (190-300 g) were identified by immunofluorescence. Homologous beta adrenoceptor desensitisation was induced by 9 d pretreatment with isoprenaline infusion (20 mg.kg-1.d-1), and heterologous desensitisation by treatment with 0.15% propylthiouracil in the diet for six weeks. The effects of isoprenaline induced cardiomyocyte injury in these animals were compared with those in control rats.",

When the same isoprenaline challenge was given to rats pretreated for 9 d with an isoprenaline infusion, the haemodynamic response was markedly attenuated and very little myocyte necrosis was noted. In the model of heterologous desensitisation occurring in hypothyroidism, isoprenaline challenge produced markedly diminished haemodynamic response and little cardiac myocyte necrosis.",

    "31": "The value of using calcium blockers in post-infarction secondary prevention is controversial. The HELD meta-analysis (1989) involving 17,759 patients concluded that they made no contribution in this indication (9.8% mortality rate vs 9.3% in the control group). The findings of the DAVIT II study with verapamil demonstrate a significant reduction in the infarction recurrence rate (18% vs 21.6%) in the treatment group. In the patients without heart failure, there was some benefit in terms of reduced mortality (7.7% vs 11.8%). The true contribution of calcium channel inhibitors, relative to that of beta-blockers in post-infarction medication should be analyzed in function of the various infarction sub-groups (no Q-wave, thrombolytic, with or without left ventricular dysfunction), of the calcium channel inhibitor being investigated and of the administration regimen.", 
    "32": "Little attention has been paid to the influence of orally administered antihypertensive drugs on intraocular pressure (IOP). Therefore, we evaluated the effects of oral medications on the IOPs and visual fields of 70 patients with systemic hypertension who had no ocular symptoms and had not visited any eye hospital. In patients with systemic hypertension treated with medication, the IOP value (mean, 18.3 +/- 4.2 mmHg; age range, 63.3 +/- 11.6 years) was significantly higher than in a control group with a similar age range who were not receiving oral medication (mean, 13.7 +/- 2.0 mmHg; age range, 62.5 +/- 7.8 years). In the group in which hypertension was controlled by medication, the IOPs were lower when orally administered beta-adrenergic blockers were given than in those patients with uncontrolled hypertension. In the group to whom calcium-channel blockers were administered orally, the IOPs were not lower. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors made the visual fields worse. This study suggests a modulating influence of orally administered drugs on the IOP and visual fields, which may be affected by whether or not the patient's blood pressure is controlled.", 
    "33": "Based on the review of available literature, this article states the possible clinical problems with beta-blocker intoxication. Some 26% of severe cases of intoxication will die. This fact stimulated the attempt, using animal experiments, to gain an insight into the pathophysiological profile of this intoxication. The results of these animal experiments led to the following conclusion: toxic doses of beta-blockers result in a dose-dependent decrease of myocardial contractility. This negative inotropic effect is not related to the antagonizing effects of the beta-blocker at the beta-adrenergic receptor level, nor to the additional properties of this group of drugs, but is influenced by a combination of other factors. These include (1) a direct negative inotropic effect on the myocardium, probably caused by a calcium dependent mechanism; (2) a decrease in serum calcium concentration, probably caused by a decreased parathormone production; (3) a centrally mediated hypotensive action. Toxic doses of beta-blockers do not only affect the myocardium and the haemodynamic system, they can also lead to respiratory arrest. This arrest is caused by the direct effect of these drugs on the central nervous system and can, in itself, be the cause of death. Such results lead to the following therapeutic advice: patients with severe beta-blocker intoxication must be admitted to an Intensive Care Unit, as early initiation of ventilation, as well as administration of beta-antagonist can be essential; the drop in serum calcium concentration must be corrected; drugs which can improve myocardial contractility, other than via the beta-adrenergic receptor, such as phosphodiesterase inhibitors and glucagon, should be administered.", 
    "34": "In order to study the feasibility of systemic delivery of levobunolol transdermally, a matrix-type delivery system was fabricated using a silicone elastomer. The relationship between loading dose and skin permeation rate was evaluated in-vitro using hairless mouse skin mounted on the stirred receptor compartment of the Keshary-Chien glass diffusion cell maintained at 37 degrees C. The concentration of levobunolol in the receptor compartment was determined by HPLC. A similar study without using the skin was carried out to determine the effect of loading dose on the release of levobunolol from discs. It was observed that the release of drug from disc followed a matrix-diffusion controlled (Q) vs square root of time relationship at different loading doses. In contrast, the results of skin permeation of levobunolol from transdermal discs containing different loading doses showed a linear Q vs time relationship indicating a constant zero order skin permeation rate at each loading dose. Skin permeation of levobunolol appeared to reach a plateau at a 5% (w/w) loading dose in the disc indicating the attainment of equilibrium concentration of levobunolol in the skin.",

Alpha- or beta-adrenergic blockade prevented the stimulation but not the inhibition of RR by dopamine in the female animals. 3. Membrane receptor mechanisms mediating these changes do not involve alterations in tissue cyclic AMP content. 4.

    "36": "1. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) produced dose-related positive chronotropic and inotropic responses in isolated atria of a newt, Triturus sp. and a frog, Rana tigrina. It was apparent that CGRP was stimulatory on the heart of the amphibian species. 2. In the frog, these dose-related responses were attenuated in the presence of a CGRP antagonist (hCGRP 3 x 10(-8) M). This was indicative of the presence of cardiac CGRP receptors. 3. In the presence of beta-adrenergic (propranolol 10(-6) M) and calcium channel (verapamil 10(-8) M, but not nifedipine 10(-8) M) blocker, the basal AR in the frog were decreased. AR induced by CGRP were increased however. 4. The maximal AR and AT responses of the isolated atria to CGRP were not affected by the presence of propranolol. 5. In the presence of calcium channel blockers (verapamil and nifedipine), the maximal AT response was attenuated. These changes suggest the cardiac effects of CGRP are related to calcium mobilization.",

Norepinephrine, which was assumed to be the transmitter of the iridophore nerves, induced dispersion of platelets within the cells. 3. The effect of norepinephrine was inhibited by an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, yohimbine, but not by a beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol. 4. Isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist, failed to bring about aggregation of platelets. 5. Forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, was effective in inducing aggregation of platelets. 6. 8-Br-cAMP caused the aggregation of platelets and inhibited the norepinephrine-induced dispersion of platelets. 7. It appears that the adrenoceptors of the iridophores of this species are solely of the alpha type; they mediate the dispersion of platelets; and an increase in intracellular levels of cAMP induces the aggregation of platelets.", 
    "38": "Over 100 chromatographic procedures for the separation of beta-blocker enantiomers are reviewed including a large number for the analysis of biological samples. All the principal chiral chromatographic procedures have found use, namely Chiral Mobile Phase Additives (CMPA), Chiral Derivatization Agents (CDA) and Chiral Stationary Phases (CSP). Chiral Mobile Phase Additives are less frequently employed than the other two procedures and many of the earlier methods were based on the use of CDAs. However, the recent development of sophisticated custom-made CSPs has allowed the separation of native (underivatized) analytes and this approach appears to be gaining in popularity. The beta-blockers are an extensive group of drugs and stereoselective separations have been reported for 40 different structures.", 
    "39": "The results of several studies, mostly without controls, have suggested that betablockers, administered at progressively increasing doses, may be beneficial in cardiac failure. Based on this hypothesis, betablockers with a peripheral vasodilator effect, such as Nebivolol, could be particularly valuable in this indication. A preliminary study of its tolerance, haemodynamic and neurohormonal effects was carried out with a noninvasive methodology in 12 patients with cardiac failure in sinus rhythm, 8 men and 4 women (average age 53 +/- 12 years), all of whom had Class III or IV symptoms according to the NYHA Classification. The protocol had 2 phases: the first was an open phase during which Nebivolol was administered at a dose of 1 mg/day for 48 hours then 2.5 mg/day for 72 h. In the second phase, the patients were randomly separated into 2 groups, one to receive placebo and the other 2.5 mg for one week then 5 mg of Nebivolol for the 5 remaining weeks. The heart rate decreased significantly from 70 +/- 3 to 63 +/- 4 beats/min (p < 0.01) with Nebivolol 1 mg/day without further slowing at the 2.5 mg dosage. During the randomised phase, the heart rate remained stable in the Nebivolol group but increased to its initial value in the group given placebo. No aggravation of symptoms was observed in the Nebivolol group. No significant changes in cardiac output, parameters of cardiac loading or contractility could be demonstrated after 6 weeks' treatment. During submaximal exercise testing, plasma concentrations of catecholamines and atrial natriuretic factor tended to be higher with Nebivolol than with placebo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "40": "The time course of serum levels of malonic dialdehyde and red blood cell activity of antioxidative enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, was assessed from the outcomes of hyperbaric oxygenation combined with antianginal therapy in 38 patients with functional classes II-III stable angina on effort without clinical manifestations of circulatory failure. Hyperbaric oxygenation involved 10-12 sessions at 1.5 ata during 40 min each. The antianginal agents (long-acting nitrates, beta-adrenoblockers, nifedipine) were given in median therapeutical doses. The control group included 26 patients who had hyperbaric oxygenation in the same fashion without taking antianginal drugs. The criteria for beneficial therapy were a reduction in the number of anginal episodes and the nitroglycerin tablets used, an increase in exercise tolerance, as evidenced by repeated bicycle ergometric test. The positive clinical effect of a hyperbaric oxygenation course was shown to be accompanied by higher activity of superoxide dismutase in the red blood cells. The use of nifedipine in the multimodality anginal therapy prevents the hyperbaric oxygenation-induced increase in serum malonic dialdehyde levels.",

This agent is approximately nine times more potent in beta-blocking activity in vivo and eight times more cardioselective in vitro than esmolol. This beta-blocking drug has a short duration of activity, enabling rapid recovery after cessation of administration if side effects occur. It can be used safely in patients suffering from acute heart disease and represents a major therapeutic advance in the treatment of heart disease.", 
    "42": "1. The effects of beta-adrenoceptor blockade on the changes in plasma renin activity (PRA) following angiotensin enzyme (ACE) inhibition were investigated in pentobarbitone-chloralose anaesthetized dogs. 2. ACE-inhibition, with enalapril (2 mg kg-1), caused a significant reduction in systemic arterial blood pressure (BP) with little or no effect on cardiac function, and a significant elevation of plasma renin activity (PRA). By contrast beta-adrenoceptor blockade with atenolol (1 mg kg-1), caused a similar reduction in BP but in addition, significantly reduced cardiac function and PRA. 3. A combination of enalapril with atenolol, caused a significant reduction in BP, cardiac function and PRA, hence there was no elevation of PRA, as was seen following ACE-inhibition with enalapril alone. 4. The observations with beta-adrenoceptor blockade alone, show that there is an important homeostatic role for the renal sympathetic innervation, mediated by beta-adrenoceptors, in controlling basal renin levels. Furthermore, the renal sympathetic innervation appears to be an important contributor to the renin release caused by an ACE-inhibitor as the additional presence of a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent will prevent this release. 5. BW B385C (2 mg kg-1), which combines both ACE-inhibition and beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties, also produced reductions in BP and cardiac function similar to those seen with the enalapril/atenolol combination. In addition, for an equivalent degree of ACE-inhibition by BW 385C, to that seen with enalapril alone, the elevation of PRA was attenuated. 6. A combination of ACE-inhibition and beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity in a single entity, such as BW B385C, therefore also produces a reduced renin release when compared with an ACE-inhibitor, such as enalapril. This provides further confirmation of the importance of the renal sympathetic innervation in the renin response to ACE-inhibition, and supports the concept of combining ACEinhibition with beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "43": "1. The pharmacological actions of T-0509, a 3-hydroxy derivative of denopamine, were studied in various guinea-pig tissues; these effects were compared with those of isoprenaline, denopamine and xamoterol. 2. The intrinsic activities of the positive inotropic actions of T-0509, denopamine and xamoterol compared with isoprenaline (= 100%) in the papillary muscle were 99%, 83% and 28%, respectively, while their relative potencies (EC50 agonist EC50 isoprenaline) were 0.23, 33 and 1.4, respectively. The intrinsic activities of T-0509, denopamine and xamoterol as positive chronotropic agents in the right atria were 98%, 69% and 48%, respectively, and their equipotent concentrations (isoprenaline = 1) were 0.24, 50 and 4, respectively. 3. The positive chronotropic actions of T-0509 and denopamine were antagonized by bisoprolol (3 x 10(-8) M), but not by ICI 118,551 (3 x 10(-8) M). 4. The intrinsic activity of T-0509 in histamine-contracted tracheae was similar to that of isoprenaline, but its equipotent concentration was 38; the effects of both agents were antagonized by ICI 118,551 (3 x 10(-8) M), but not by bisoprolol (3 x 10(-8) M). Denopamine and xamoterol did not show any agonist activity on guinea-pig trachea. 5. Denopamine and xamoterol antagonized the positive chronotropic (pA2, denopamine: 6.98, xamoterol: 7.75) and tracheal relaxant (pA2, denopamine: 5.39, xamoterol: 6.25) effects of isoprenaline. 6. Isoprenaline, T-0509 and denopamine, but not xamoterol, contracted the guinea-pig aorta in a decreasing order in the presence of propranolol (10(-6) M).7.

Two HPLC methods were developed separately for determination of drug levels in urine and plasma. For plasma samples, after addition of internal standard (IS), a single-step extraction of alkalinized plasma was performed with methylene chloride. The organic layer was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure, and the residue was taken up and chromatographed on a microbore silica column. Ronactolol and IS were detected by a UV detector at a wavelength of 278 nm. Excellent linearity was observed between the peak height ratios (ronactolol:IS) and concentrations in plasma. The lowest limit of detection (signal:noise, 3:1) was 1.5 ng/mL of plasma. Urine samples were directly injected and chromatographed on a microbore C18 column with an ion-pairing mobile phase. Excellent linearity was observed between the peak areas and concentrations in urine. The lowest limit of detection (signal:noise, 3:1) was 75 ng/mL of urine.

    "45": "Recent years have witnessed astonishing progress in our understanding of the molecular basis of adrenoceptor structure, function and regulation and revealed an unexpected heterogeneity of adrenoceptors demonstrating the existence of at least 11 subtypes. This paper discusses the implications of these advances on studies regarding a specific role of adrenoceptors in the development of genetic hypertension. The available data indicate that among the alpha-adrenoceptor subtypes the alpha 2A-adrenoceptor is the most likely candidate for an alteration specifically linked to genetic hypertension in the animal model of the spontaneously hypertensive rat and possibly in some patients. Alterations of other alpha-adrenoceptor subtypes may be specific for some forms of genetic hypertension but are unlikely to play an important role for blood pressure regulation. Most beta-adrenoceptor alterations appear to occur secondary to blood pressure elevation independently of whether hypertension has occurred on a genetic basis or not. Moreover, the mechanisms regulating alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor responsiveness upon prolonged agonist exposure may be altered in hypertension and thereby contribute to the pathophysiology of this disease.", 
    "46": "The dose-effect relation and duration of action of 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg ridazolol on ischemic ST-segment depression in exercise-ECG were determined in a randomized, double-blind, acute, cross-over study of 15 patients with confirmed coronary artery disease and reproducible ST-segment depression. Maximal reduction of ST-segment depression in comparison to placebo during constant exercise was 0.16 vs. 0.25 mm (n.s.) after 10 mg, 0.09 vs. 0.25 mm (p less than 0.01) after 20 mg, 0.11 vs. 0.25 mm (p less than 0.01) after 40 mg, and 0.07 vs. 0.25 mm (p less than 0.01) after 80 mg ridazolol. A remarkable reduction of ST-segment depression under placebo was seen in the third and fifth hours after application. Systolic blood pressure under exercise was reduced significantly after 80 mg ridazolol (145 vs. 176 mm Hg; (p less than 0.05) over a period of 5 h. Heart-rate was reduced significantly after 80 mg ridazolol (102 vs. 131/min; p less than 0.05) for 5 h. Rate-pressure product after 20 mg (174 vs. 234 mm Hg/min; p less than 0.01), 40 mg (169 vs. 234 mm Hg/min; p less than 0.01), and 80 mg (153 vs. 234 mm Hg/min; p less than 0.01) ridazolol was reduced significantly over 3 to 5 h. 20, 40 and 80 mg ridazolol show a good antianginal and antihypertensive efficacy. Blood pressure and heart-rate under exercise were significantly reduced over 5 h. In contrast, improvement of ST-segment depression only lasted 1 h. Ridazolol was well tolerated.", 
    "47": "Meta-analysis of several large interventional trials in patients with mild to moderate hypertension has shown that coronary events are reduced to a much lesser extent than expected. One of the possible explanations for this are the metabolic side-effects of diuretics and betablockers used in these trials that may counteract their beneficial blood-pressure-lowering effect. Diuretics, especially thiazide, increase total cholesterol (+5%) and LDL-cholesterol (+10%), while betablockers decrease HDL-cholesterol (-5%) and increase triglycerides (+20%). Calcium antagonists and ACE-inhibitors do not affect lipids, and alpha-blockers have some beneficial effects. Regarding the carbohydrate metabolism, diuretics and betablockers decrease insulin sensitivity, increase plasma insulin, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides, and reduce HDL-cholesterol. Calcium channel blockers are neutral, while alpha-blockers and ACE-inhibitors improve glucose tolerance and reduce insulin resistance. To date, the clinical relevance of this side-effects is not known. Controlled, long-term trials in hypertensive patients with calcium channel blockers, ACE-inhibitors, and alpha-blockers are needed.", 
    "48": "The present study was designed to clarify the mechanism of adrenergic modulation of pancreatic glucagon secretion in rats under physiological conditions by 1) epinephrine infusion alone or together with adrenergic blockers and 2) administration of adrenergic agonists. Intravenous infusion of epinephrine alone (1 microgram/kg/min, equal to 0.7 nmol/kg/min) caused a significant increase in glucagon secretion. Phentolamine (an alpha blocker) or yohimbine (an alpha 2 blocker) administration completely inhibited the increase of glucagon secretion caused by epinephrine infusion, but neither the administration of bunazosin (an alpha 1 blocker) nor beta blockers inhibited it. Infusion of clonidine (an alpha 2 agonist) caused significant increase of glucagon secretion even at a low dose of 0.5 nmol/kg/min, although infusion of neither an alpha 1 nor a beta 2 agonist caused it even at the high dose of 40.0 nmol/kg/min. It is concluded that the alpha 2 receptor mechanism plays the most important role in the adrenergic modulation of glucagon secretion in rats under physiological conditions.", 
    "49": "In order to compare the beta blockers bisoprolol and diazepam in the treatment of cardiac neurosis, 40 patients (16 males and 24 females, mean age: 39 +/- 11 years) were examined in a double-blind, crossover study. Following a 4-week placebo period, patients were randomized to receive either bisoprolol 10 mg daily or diazepam 5 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. After a second 4-week washout period on placebo, patients were switched to the alternative regimen for a further 4 weeks. At the end of the placebo periods and during each phase of treatment, the following parameters were evaluated: somatic symptoms by self-assessment questionnaire, anxiety state by Hamilton rating scale, reaction time to both acoustic and visual stimuli, blood pressure, and heart rate. Both treatments were effective in reducing somatic symptoms of cardiac neurosis, but bisoprolol was significantly more effective than diazepam (p less than 0.01). On the contrary, diazepam was superior to bisoprolol in improving the Hamilton scale related to psychic symptoms. Only diazepam prolonged reaction times. Both treatments were well tolerated; however, 12 patients complained of drowsiness and nine of sedation under diazepam. In conclusion, bisoprolol appeared to be as effective as diazepam in the treatment of cardiac neurosis, but with better effects on somatic symptoms and without affecting patients' psychomotor performance.", 
    "50": "Patients treated with beta-blocking agents often complain of fatigue during exercise. Exercise capacity is decreased under this condition. Nebivolol is a new beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist with a particular hemodynamic profile, which might be due to an ancillary property. Five milligrams once daily seems the optimal dose for antihypertensive treatment. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, the effects of nebivolol on maximal and endurance exercise capacity are compared with those of atenolol in healthy volunteers. The hemodynamic and metabolic effects during exercise are also studied. Nebivolol 5 mg once daily and atenolol 100 mg once daily decrease blood pressure at rest similarly. At these dosages nebivolol shows a smaller decrease in heart rate than atenolol. During exercise, the rise in systolic blood pressure and heart rate is less depressed with nebivolol than with atenolol. In contrast to atenolol, nebivolol does not decrease maximal and endurance exercise capacity, and does not increase perceived exertion significantly. Changes in hemodynamics influence maximal exercise capacity. Since nebivolol has less effect on exercise hemodynamics than atenolol, this might explain why maximal work capacity is not changed during nebivolol. During endurance exercise metabolic effects are thought to be more important. Under nebivolol glycerol and NEFA production is less depressed during exercise and might explain the preserved endurance capacity. These data suggest less beta blockade during nebivolol than during atenolol at the dosages used in this study. In conclusion, at a dose known to be antihypertensive, nebivolol does not alter exercise capacity significantly in healthy volunteers.",

We tested its potential effect against ventricular fibrillation (VF), in a pig model of acute myocardial ischemia. Bucindolol 6 mg/kg IV was administered in two equally divided doses, the first 30 minutes prior to, and the second 10 minutes after, ligation of the anterior descending coronary artery (CAL) in anesthetized open-chest pigs. Bucindolol decreased the incidence of VF to 1/11 versus 14/16 in the control group (p less than 0.005). Bucindolol also decreased the duration of ventricular tachycardia, 15 +/- 8 seconds versus 104 +/- 32 seconds in the control group (p less than 0.01). Bucindolol maintained LVmaxdP/dt at predrug and pre-CAL values, whereas LVmaxdP/dt was decreased by CAL in the control group. Bucindolol decreased arterial pressure and heart rate. Bucindolol increased blood flow in the peripheral ischemic zone (24.6 +/- 1.8% versus 16.2 +/- 1.7% (percent of pre-CAL value) in controls, p less than 0.002), as well as in the nonischemic zones (periischemic zone: 126.4 +/- 6.1% versus 96.7 +/- 4.8% in the control group, p less than 0.0005; remote nonischemic zone: 126.6 +/- 7.1% versus 87.1 +/- 4.3% of pre-CAL value in the control group, p less than 0.0001).

MORBIDITY, MORTALITY AND SURROGATE ENDPOINTS: Only diuretics and beta-blockers have been shown to benefit hypertensive patients in terms of the hard endpoints morbidity and mortality. beta-Blockers and diuretics are cheaper than newer drugs and thus represent good value for money. It is not acceptable to use drug effects on plasma lipids or insulin resistance as measures of the effects on coronary heart disease, since dihydropyridine calcium antagonists improve these parameters while significantly increasing coronary heart disease events in the acute and chronic ischaemic situation. PATIENT PROFILING: Diuretics. Diuretics appear particularly suited to elderly hypertensives, especially those with isolated systolic hypertension, but they may increase cardiac events in younger and middle-aged diabetic and non-diabetic hypertensives. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. ACE inhibitors are undoubtedly valuable in the presence of left ventricular dysfunction, and possibly in the diabetic in maintaining good renal function. beta-Blockers. beta-Blockers are particularly well suited to younger and middle-aged hypertensives at all blood pressure levels, especially white males; where ischaemia and/or stress is a factor, beta-blockers can significantly reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction and strokes. beta-Blockers benefit elderly hypertensives by preventing strokes and may prevent coronary heart disease if prescribed with a diuretic.", 
    "60": "Three hundred and four hypertensive patients with different degrees of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) were recruited and followed for 4 years. The patients were randomized into two groups: Group I (150 patients) was treated with a combination of hypotensive drugs including beta-blockers, and group II (154 patients) was treated with the same combination of drugs including diuretics instead of beta-blockers. By the end of the fourth year, 60 endpoints were recorded: 17 strokes, 13 myocardial infarctions, and 30 cases of chronic coronary insufficiency. Mortality was statistically higher in group II (7 of 154 or 5% v 1 of 150 or 1%) (P less than .035), but there was no difference between the groups in the incidence of nonfatal endpoints. These data confirm that beta-blockers can reduce mortality associated with the complications presented in hypertensive patients. Increased left ventricular myocardial mass (greater than 200 g, according to Teichholz' formula) was shown to have prognostic value for the development of complications. In patients with LVMM greater than 200 g, the probability of fatal complications was higher (P less than .007), as was the probability of nonfatal myocardial infarction (P less than .01), development of coronary artery disease (P less than .02), and all complications (P less than .0003).

Patients not controlled were then prescribed additional diuretic therapy (cyclopenthiazide 0.5 mg and potassium 1200 mg). At each visit blood pressure and adverse events were recorded; plasma lipids were measured at baseline, six and 12 weeks. During titration there was a linear decrease in systolic (-29 mmHg on atenolol and -24 mmHg on terazosin) and diastolic blood pressure (-17 and -12 mmHg) in both groups without subsequent change over the next six weeks; atenolol reduced heart rate (-11 bpm) without change on terazosin. During the initial six weeks the total cholesterol fell in both groups; however, there were significant between-treatment differences in triglyceride responses with a fall on terazosin and a rise on atenolol. Comparing atenolol and terazosin over the total 12 week study (irrespective of thiazide treatment) increased triglyceride levels and reduced cholesterol ratios and HDL were demonstrated on atenolol, contrasting with reduced triglyceride levels and elevated HDL and cholesterol ratios of terazosin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Following this, the doxazosin dose was halved and pindolol, a beta-blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, was added (mean dose 7.8 mg) to maintain blood pressure control. At the completion of 11 weeks of combined alpha- and beta-blockade, HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels were found to be unaltered when compared to pretreatment; however there was a small but significant fall in total cholesterol.

Patients received either placebo (3 men, 11 women) or nebivolol 5 mg (5 men, 13 women) once daily for 4 weeks. In the nebivolol group, a significant decrease in blood pressures (P less than 0.001) and heart rate (P less than 0.01) was seen. Nebivolol therapy also suppressed plasma renin and aldosterone concentration (P less than 0.02) but increased plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels (P less than 0.03). No significant changes in routine blood biochemistry were demonstrated in either group. There was a tendency for left ventricular mass to decline, and left ventricular ejection fraction to rise during nebivolol therapy, but these changes did not reach statistical significance. There was no significant change in ectopic activity. None of the 32 subjects had adverse experiences requiring cessation of therapy. In conclusion, nebivolol in a dose of 5 mg daily is effective and well tolerated in patients with essential hypertension. It suppresses plasma renin and aldosterone and stimulates plasma atrial natriuretic peptide.",

    "73": "This study investigates the role of beta-adrenergic receptors in the immunomodulatory effects of a conditioned aversive stimulus (CS). A CS is an environmental event that is not inherently aversive, but acquires aversive properties through pairings with a stimulus such as electric shock. This study evaluated the effects of administration of the beta 1-receptor selective antagonist atenolol, and the beta 2-receptor antagonist ICI 118,551 on conditioned immune alterations. Administration of either antagonist prior to presentation of the CS resulted in a dose-dependent attenuation of the CS-induced suppression of splenic T-cell proliferative response to concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin, and the combination of ionomycin/phorbol-myristate-acetate. Furthermore, both antagonists dose-dependently attenuated the CS-induced suppression of gamma-interferon production by concanavalin-A (ConA)-stimulated splenocytes. In contrast, neither antagonist significantly attenuated the CS-induced suppression of the B-cell mitogenic response to LPS, interleukin-2 production, natural killer cell activity, or mitogenic responsiveness of blood lymphocytes. Thus it is likely that multiple mechanisms are involved in CS-induced immune alterations and these results clearly implicate beta 1 and beta 2-adrenergic receptors in a subset of immunomodulatory effects.",

    "75": "To determine the modulatory role of the autonomic nervous system on dry air-induced bronchoconstriction (AIB) in the canine lung periphery, we examined the effect of cholinergic, alpha- and beta-adrenergic, and total autonomic ganglionic blockade on AIB. Pretreatment with atropine significantly attenuated AIB by approximately 30%, indicating that AIB is partially mediated via a vagal reflex. Pretreatment with either phentolamine or propranolol did not affect AIB, indicating that alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors, respectively, were not activated in response to dry air challenge. In contrast, pretreatment with hexamethonium significantly potentiated AIB. In addition, exogenous vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), a potential neurotransmitter for the nonadrenergic-noncholinergic (NANC) inhibitory system, significantly inhibited AIB. We conclude that (1) neither alpha- or beta-adrenergic efferents are activated during dry air challenge, (2) total autonomic blockade potentiates the response to dry air, and (3) VIP attenuates AIB. Based on these observations, we speculate that NANC inhibitory activity may be stimulated during dry air challenge and antagonizes AIB.", 
    "76": "In 107 patients with acute myocardial infarction, the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias during the acute phase of thrombolysis was examined by means of Holter monitoring. In patients with a patient infarct-related artery as assessed angiographically at 90 minutes, the occurrence of accelerated idioventricular rhythms was noted significantly more frequently than in patients with a permanent occluded vessel. This arrhythmia peaked in the first 180 minutes after the start of thrombolysis. In addition, single ventricular premature beats and runs of ventricular tachycardia were also more common in patients with successful reperfusion. The effects of acute intravenous administration of beta-blockers were examined in 66 patients without contraindications to this therapeutic approach. There were no differences in the occurrence of any type of rhythm disorders in patients with (n = 43) or without beta-blockade (n = 23). Thus ventricular arrhythmias particularly accelerated idioventricular rhythms, and single ventricular premature beats occur more frequently in patients with a patent infarct artery within the first 24 hours after thrombolysis. Acute intravenous beta-blockade does not appear to exert significant antiarrhythmic effects during this period.", 
    "77": "Atrial fibrillation is associated with potentially life-threatening strokes. Anticoagulation with warfarin or aspirin reduces the risk of embolic events in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation and mitral valve stenosis or other underlying heart disease. In patients with acute onset of atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation is not necessary before cardioversion. However, in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation should be started three weeks before cardioversion and continued for four weeks after the return of normal sinus rhythm. Quinidine remains the agent most commonly used for medical cardioversion in patients who are hemodynamically stable. If a patient is hemodynamically unstable or the atrial fibrillation is not corrected with drug therapy, direct-current electrical cardioversion has a high success rate. Antiarrhythmic (quinidine) therapy is often continued indefinitely to help maintain sinus rhythm.", 
    "78": "Activation of the adrenergic nervous system appears to play a crucial role in the genesis of fatal arrhythmias associated with the very early stages of acute myocardial infarction. The second messenger of beta-adrenergic catecholamine stimulation, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP), has established arrhythmogenic qualities, acting by an increase in cytosolic calcium, which potentially has three adverse electrophysiologic effects. First, stimulation of the transient inward current by excess oscillations of cytosolic calcium can invoke delayed afterdepolarizations, so that triggered automaticity can develop in otherwise quiescent ventricular muscle. Second, cyclic AMP can evoke calcium-dependent slow responses in depolarized fibers, so that conditions for reentry are favored. Third, excess cytosolic calcium can cause intercellular uncoupling with conduction slowing. Focal changes in cyclic AMP and cytosolic calcium promote the development of ventricular fibrillation. Beta-adrenergic blockade can limit the formation of cyclic AMP in ischemic tissue. Furthermore, by reducing sinus tachycardia it can lessen cytosolic calcium overload. Hence, beta-adrenergic blockade helps to prevent ventricular fibrillation in the early stages of acute myocardial infarction and protects from sudden death in the postinfarction phase. In congestive heart failure, abnormalities of cytosolic calcium patterns exist with cytosolic calcium overload. It is proposed that the adverse effects of phosphodiesterase inhibitors on the mortality rate in patients with congestive heart failure can be explained by increased rates of formation of cyclic AMP and the development of calcium-dependent arrhythmias. Because calcium is the ultimate messenger of cyclic AMP-induced arrhythmias and because cytosolic calcium is increased in heart failure, it will be difficult to develop positive inotropic agents that are free of the risk of sudden death.", 
    "79": "The Nifedipine Gastro-Intestinal Therapeutic System (GITS) Circadian Anti-ischemia Program (N-CAP) was designed to test the effect of nifedipine GITS as monotherapy or in combination with a beta-adrenergic blocking agent on the circadian pattern of angina and silent ischemia in patients with chronic stable angina. At 118 sites in the United States, 1,174 patients were screened for entry into this study. To be eligible for participation patients were required to have at least two episodes of angina a week and at least two episodes of myocardial ischemia during 48-h ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring during the baseline placebo period. A total of 207 patients completed all phases of the study. Beta-blockers were continued in those patients already receiving them. In this 7- to 10-week single-blind placebo withdrawal study, a 1-week placebo run-in was followed by up to 5 weeks of single-blind titration with nifedipine GITS, a 4-week efficacy phase with an established dose and a final single-blind 2-week placebo withdrawal period. Ambulatory ECG monitoring was performed at the end of each placebo phase and at the end of the efficacy phase with a digital monitoring device that was validated in a pilot study. Overall, nifedipine GITS significantly reduced the weekly number of anginal episodes from 5.7 to 1.8 (p = 0.0001) and the number of ischemic events from 7.3 to 4 (p = 0.0001) reported during the 48-h monitoring periods, with a significant increase in both during the placebo withdrawal period. The baseline circadian pattern of ischemia showed an early morning peak and a secondary peak in the afternoon. Nifedipine GITS significantly reduced ischemia during the 48-h period when administered as monotherapy or in combination with a beta-blocker. Patients were also randomized to receive nifedipine GITS in either a morning or an evening dose. The two regimens resulted in equal anti-ischemic benefit. The primary side effect of nifedipine GITS was edema, which was dose related. In summary, nifedipine GITS reduced the number of anginal and ischemic episodes when given alone or in combination with a beta-blocker. Nifedipine GITS had a sustained effect: a single daily dose was effective over 24 h regardless of whether it was administered in the morning or evening. This study also suggests that combination therapy with nifedipine GITS and a beta-blocker is especially efficacious in reducing ischemia.", 
    "80": "To determine whether the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) is sympathetically mediated, we studied the effects of beta-blockade by propranolol, ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium, or mechanical pithing on the blood pressure response to EDRF inhibition in anesthetized rats. We inhibited EDRF with 10 mg/kg of either NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) or N omega-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME). In controls, L-NMMA and L-NAME increased blood pressure by 14 +/- 1 (p less than 0.01) and 22 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.01), respectively. Propranolol lowered blood pressure from 98 +/- 3 to 72 +/- 4 mm Hg without altering the response to L-NAME (delta 26 +/- 3). This response correlated with the resting blood pressure (r = 0.87; p less than 0.001). Hexamethonium (25 mg/kg) lowered blood pressure from 118 +/- 6 to 85 +/- 4 mm Hg but did not change the response to L-NMMA (delta 15 +/- 1). In pithed rats, blood pressure was lowered, but the pressor response to L-NAME was unchanged. When blood pressure was returned to normotensive levels by angiotensin II, norepinephrine, or phenylephrine, L-NAME increased blood pressure by 50 +/- 2, 68 +/- 8, and 109 +/- 7 mm Hg, respectively (p less than 0.001). We conclude that an intact autonomic nervous system is not needed for the pressor response to EDRF inhibition. The enhanced response in pithed rats treated with vasoconstrictors may be due to removal of the buffering effect of the baroreceptors and the absence of EDRF, which would oppose vasoconstriction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

This was associated with significant reduction in left ventricular outflow tract gradient (38 +/- 38 versus 87 +/- 43 mm Hg, p less than 0.0001) and significant increases in cardiac output and systemic arterial pressures. Notably, when pacing was discontinued and comparisons were made in sinus rhythm, treadmill exercise durations were greater and left ventricular outflow tract gradients were less at the follow-up evaluation compared with the baseline study.",

    "84": "Although changes in contractility are often accompanied by changes in relaxation, a mathematical model of ventricular coupling has not been described. A model we examined suggests a hyperbolic relation between measurements of contraction and relaxation. We thus tested the hypothesis that relatively load-independent measurements of contractility (end-systolic elastance [Ees]) and relaxation (the slope of the tau-to-end-systolic pressure relation [R]) were coupled.", 
    "85": "To establish the validity of the model, an assessment of Ees and R was made in 30 subjects who underwent sequential digital ventriculography and micromanometer pressure measurements during atrial pacing (93 +/- 10 min-1) before and after graded doses of nitroprusside. To establish if a cyclic AMP (cAMP)-mediated intervention alters coupling, seven of the 30 subjects were studied before and after 3 months of beta-blockade. To determine if a non-cAMP-mediated intervention alters coupling, 12 other patients were studied before and after deslanoside. Nonlinear regression analysis for the initial 30 patients suggested a hyperbolic relation: (Ees) (R) = 1.05 (r = 0.79, p less than 0.001) with an inflection point near Ees = 1.02 mm Hg/ml. Thus, with normal or near-normal contractility, relaxation is normal and not load dependent (R is close to 0). With systolic dysfunction, relaxation becomes very afterload dependent and so must be normalized for load. After long-term beta-blockade in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, small improvements in contractility (elastance) occurred with larger changes in relaxation, but the curve describing the relation was not displaced. Acute administration of deslanoside resulted in a large increase in elastance and a smaller change in relaxation but did not alter coupling. However, the magnitude of the change in R was dependent on the predrug R value.", 
    "86": "These data suggest contraction and relaxation may be physiologically coupled with relaxation relatively preserved in early heart failure and more rapid deterioration in relaxation as elastance falls under 1.02 mm Hg/ml. Both beta-blockers (which may act through cAMP) and digitalis (which is cAMP independent) improve contraction and relaxation, but both mechanisms appear to maintain coupling. The hyperbolic relation between contraction and relaxation may have important implications regarding therapeutic response and selection of patients for clinical trials in heart failure.", 
    "87": "The effects of adrenaline and isoproterenol, a specific beta-adrenergic agonist, on TNF production were investigated. Both agents inhibited the production of TNF by human blood and THP-1 cells stimulated by LPS. The effect of adrenaline was prevented by a beta-receptor antagonist, but not by an alpha-receptor antagonist. Levels of TNF mRNA were not reduced by adrenaline. Inhibition of TNF production was observed only if cells were first exposed to adrenaline or isoproterenol at about the same time as to LPS; incubation of THP-1 cells with isoproterenol for 24 h before LPS stimulation dramatically increased response, and prevented suppression of TNF production by a second dose of isoproterenol. Intracellular cAMP levels were increased by adrenaline and isoproterenol, at concentrations that inhibited TNF production. However, prolonged incubation of THP-1 cells with isoproterenol resulted in depression of cAMP concentrations to below basal levels. These data suggest that TNF production can be regulated by beta-receptor stimulation, that such regulation is mediated by changes in intracellular cAMP concentrations and is exerted at a posttranscriptional level. Adrenaline may be an important endogenous regulator of TNF production in sepsis.", 
    "88": "Human lymphocyte beta-receptor density in heart diseases with various degrees of heart function of 41 cases was determined. beta-receptor density and ejection fraction in congestive heart failure (CHF) before and after conventional therapy with small dose of beta-blocker (metoprolol) or captopril were compared. The aim was to clarify the action and safety of beta-blocker in the treatment of CHF. The results revealed that there was no statistical difference between beta-receptor density in CHF with cardiac function of degree I and II (516.57 +/- 85.93 fmol/10(7) cells, mean +/- s) and in normal controls (576.56 +/- 97.18 fmol/10(7) cells, P > 0.05), while beta-receptor density in CHF of degree III and IV was much lower than that in normal controls (decreased by 50%). There was no statistical difference of beta-receptor density between rheumatic heart disease and cardiomyopathy. Metoprolol up-regulated beta-receptor density from 302.40 +/- 100.91 to 459.60 +/- 174.34 fmol/10(7) cells (P < 0.05), but no change was observed after treatment by captopril. Ejection fraction was increased in both groups (P < 0.01). The results revealed that beta-receptor density was decreased in certain kinds of CHF but no relationship was observed between CHF of different etiology. beta-receptor density was up-regulated by beta-blocker, thus it indicates that it is rational to use beta-blocker for the treatment of certain kinds of CHF. And the use of small dose of beta-blocker with conventional therapy of heart failure might reduce the negative inotropic action of the former.", 
    "89": "The effects of several doses of porcine brain natriuretic peptide-32 (pBNP-32) administered into the lateral brain ventricle were tested as regards the consolidation of passive avoidance learning in rats. The peptide was found to increase the passive avoidance latency in a dose-dependent manner. In order to clarify which transmitter systems might be involved in the action of pBNP-32, the experimental animals were pretreated with different receptor blockers in selected doses which did not influence the behavioral paradigm. Four of the receptor blockers (haloperidol, atropine, phenoxybenzamine and propranolol) effectively blocked the action of the peptide on the consolidation of passive avoidance learning. The other three (naloxone, bicuculline and methysergide) were ineffective. The results suggest that dopaminergic, cholinergic and alpha- and beta-adrenergic mediations might be involved in the effects of pBNP-32 on the consolidation of passive avoidance learning in rats.",

The status of beta-adrenergic and alpha-adrenergic receptors in a purified sarcolemmal preparation was studied by measuring the specific binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol and [3H]prazosin, respectively. Reperfusion with Ca(2+)-containing medium increased the density of both beta- and alpha-adrenoceptors. While the hearts perfused with Ca(2+)-free medium for 5 minutes did not show any change in the Kd values upon reperfusion, the hearts perfused with Ca(2+)-free medium for 10 minutes showed an increase in the Kd value for beta-receptors and a decrease in the Kd value for alpha-receptors. The alterations in adrenergic receptors upon reperfusion in the hearts perfused with Ca(2+)-free medium for 5 minutes were not evident if the medium contained a low concentration of Na+ (35 mM) or was maintained at a low temperature (21 degrees C) to prevent the occurrence of an overload of intracellular Ca2+. These results suggest that an overload of intracellular Ca2+ might play an important role in changing the characteristics of adrenergic receptors in diseased hearts.", 
    "91": "The effect of SR 33557, a novel calcium entry blocker, on calcium overload, and regulation of calcium channels and beta-adrenergic receptors was investigated in the rat heart. Calcium overload and infarct-like lesions were produced by a large dose of isoproterenol (40 mg/kg, subcutaneously) to rats. Calcium overload was maximal 8 hours after administration of isoproterenol (control: 5.7 mmol Ca2+/kg dry weight, isoproterenol: 34.9 mmol Ca2+/kg dry weight). At that time, a decrease in the total number of beta-adrenergic receptors (-27%) and calcium channels (-20% and -23%) was observed. Intravenous injection of SR 33557 (0.5-10 mg/kg), 30 minutes before administration of isoproterenol, attenuated the increase in calcium content in a dose-related manner, such that 5 mg/kg SR 33557 reduced calcium overload by 50%. At this dose, SR 33557 had no effect on the number of beta-adrenergic receptors but prevented the decrease in the number of calcium channels. The total number of binding sites and the dissociation constants of each radioligand were estimated from saturation isotherms. The dissociation constants were unchanged when animals given isoproterenol or SR 33557 and isoproterenol were compared to the control group. The results indicate that SR 33557 is able to protect against the calcium overload induced by sympathetic over-stimulation. This over-stimulation of the sympathetic system causes a down-regulation of the number of active beta-adrenergic receptors and calcium channels. The down-regulation of calcium channels is selectively reduced by earlier administration of SR 33557.", 
    "92": "Lipid mobilization was investigated in subcutaneous adipose tissue specimens obtained before and after a standardized mental-stress test in 14 non-obese healthy subjects. All participants responded with an increased heart rate and elevation of plasma glycerol levels. Plasma norepinephrine concentrations remained unchanged throughout the test. In six subjects, mental stress induced a significant increase in plasma epinephrine levels, to more than 0.26 nmol/L (responders), while the remaining eight individuals showed a response of less than 0.12 nmol/L (nonresponders). In the responders, a 30% increase in catecholamine-stimulated in vitro lipolysis was found after the mental-stress test, while the lipolytic response in isolated fat cells in vitro decreased slightly in the nonresponders after mental stress. A strong correlation (r = .84) was observed between the increased in vitro lipolytic responsiveness due to mental stress and circulating plasma epinephrine levels. In vitro data suggest that the augmentation in lipolytic activity induced by acute mental stress was caused by alterations between the beta-adrenoceptor and adenylate cyclase, ie, probably an increased coupling between beta-receptors and the stimulatory guanosine triphosphate [GTP]-binding protein (G2). This, in combination with elevated levels of circulating epinephrine, may explain the increased lipolysis during mental stress in some individuals (ie, responders). However, other parallel mechanisms for activation of lipolysis during mental stress must also exist in certain individuals (ie, nonresponders), and seem not to involve the adrenergic system.", 
    "93": "Administration of L-thyroxine (T4) to thyroidectomized Calotes versicolor significantly increased the activity of glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase) (liver and kidney), the concentrations of blood glucose and total protein (liver and kidney), and decreased hepatic cholesterol when compared to thyroidectomized lizards. Propranolol injections in thyroidectomized lizards increased the cholesterol concentration and did not change the other parameters. The activity of G-6-Pase and blood glucose content was stimulated, whereas the total protein and cholesterol contents were decreased after alloxan treatment. Administration of T4 to thyroidectomized animals pretreated with propranolol or alloxan significantly elevated the activity of G-6-Pase, the concentrations of blood glucose, and total protein, and reduced hepatic cholesterol level when compared to drug-treated lizards. From the results, it is evident that thyroid hormone has an independent stimulatory influence on intermediary metabolism in C. versicolor irrespective of the involvement of adrenaline or insulin.", 
    "94": "Effect of acute lethal blood loss on character and frequency of cardiac arrhythmias in postresuscitation period has been studied. Experiments were carried out on mongrel male rats resuscitated after 4- and 6-min clinical death caused by acute blood loss. Electric cardiac instability was found in early postresuscitation period. Pacemaker migration, paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia, blockades and extrasystole that lead to ventricular fibrillation were observed in 20 percent of cases. Supported by correlative analysis it has been established that the main arrhythmogenic factors are abundance of catecholamines, free fatty acids, dienic conjugates, lactate and inhibition of Ca dependent ATPase. Antiarrhythmogenic effects of antihypoxant gutimin, the beta-adrenoreceptor blocker inderal, antioxidant oxypiridin-6 were noticed after their separate administration before clinical death. The same effect of carnosine and phosphocreatine administered during resuscitation also was noticed.", 
    "95": "Fever and activation of acute phase responses were induced in human volunteers by intramuscular injection of typhoid vaccine. Vaccine injection caused a rapid (within 1 h) and sustained rise in metabolic rate (peak response 16%, 6-8 h), followed by later increases in white blood cell count (3-4 h), skin temperature (4-5 h), oral temperature (5-6 h), heart rate (6-8 h), and plasma cortisol (5-8 h). A peak fever [1.2 +/- 0.2 degree C (SE) rise] was recorded 12 h after vaccine injection. The involvement of the sympathetic nervous system in the development of these responses was investigated by the oral administration of propranolol before (80 mg) and 3 h after (40 mg) vaccine injection. Propranolol prevented the increases in metabolic rate, heart rate, and skin temperature but did not inhibit the rise in oral temperature or white cell count after vaccine administration. These data indicate that the sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the rise in energy expenditure associated with fever in humans. However, the rise in body temperature can develop in the absence of this increase in metabolic rate possibly by changes in heat loss.", 
    "96": "The mapping of the forebrain regions sensitive to beta-endorphin and morphine for antinociception was performed in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. The antinociception was assessed by the tail-flick test. The sites most sensitive to beta-endorphin (2 micrograms) for inhibition of the tail-flick response were located in the ventromedial regions of the forebrain such as medial posterior nucleus accumbens, medial preoptic area and arcuate hypothalamic nucleus. Other areas such as anterior nucleus accumbens, dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, posterior hypothalamus, lateral hypothalamus, caudate nuclei, thalami and cerebral cortex were not sensitive to beta-endorphin for the tail-flick inhibition. The sites sensitive to morphine sulfate (4 micrograms) for inhibition of the tail-flick response were located in regions of medial preoptic nucleus and arcuate hypothalamic nucleus. Posterior nucleus accumbens, which is sensitive to beta-endorphin, was not sensitive to morphine for antinociception. Morphine injected into this site did not produce tail-flick inhibition in both conscious and pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. The inhibition of the tail-flick response induced by beta-endorphin (2 micrograms) from posterior nucleus accumbens, medial preoptic area and arcuate hypothalamic nucleus was blocked by the administration of beta-endorphin-(1-27), an epsilon opioid receptor blocker, but not by D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Try-Orn-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2, a mu opioid receptor blocker. On the other hand, the inhibition induced by morphine (4 micrograms) from medial preoptic area and arcuate hypothalamic nucleus was blocked by D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Try-Orn-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2, but not by beta-endorphin-(1-27).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "97": "To test the hypothesis of an altered central nervous system influence upon the immune system of Down's syndrome (DS) patients and in order to establish a peripheral biological marker of neuroimmune deficit, we have studied the characteristics of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor (B2AR) system in peripheral blood monocytes (PBMC) of 12 pre-pubertal (six boys and six girls) individuals and correlated alterations in binding with changes in distribution of lymphocyte subsets. Using the very potent beta-adrenergic antagonist, iodocyanopindolol ([125I]CYP), as a ligand, the present study shows that a typical BAR population of the beta 2-subtype is present in PBMC from DS children, with binding kinetics and structural specificity similar to those measured in PBMC from patients with other (non-genetic) forms of mental retardation, or in PBMC from age-matched healthy subjects. On the other hand, this study revealed a significant increase in B2AR binding capacity of PBMC from DS subjects (Bmax = 5258 +/- 470 sites/cell) compared to the values measured in the control population of retarded children (Bmax = 1965 +/- 280 sites/cell), characterized by an approximately three-fold increase in the Bmax, without changes in binding affinity (KD = 40.5 +/- 2.0 and 36.6 +/- 2.5 pM in DS and retarded patients, respectively). The flowcytometric analysis of lymphocyte subsets using a panel of monoclonal antibodies against a series of lymphocyte markers revealed a profound alteration in the distribution of lymphocyte subtypes with an almost 50% decrease in B cell and T-helper populations, a three-fold increase in T-cytotoxic suppressor, a seven-fold increase in lymphocyte-activated killer cells (LAK) and 30% increase in natural killer (NK) subpopulations. When fluorescence-labelled lymphocytes were visualized in the cytofluorograph and sorted for their use in the radioreceptor assay, B cells had approximately twice the number of B2AR when compared to T cells; and cytotoxic/suppressor showed a higher binding capacity compared to T-helper cells. On the other hand, labelled lymphocytes from DS patients showed a specific increase in receptor number in B cells, T-cytotoxic suppressor and NK subpopulations. It is concluded that a profound catecholaminergic dysfunction not previously appreciated in DS is reflected by a significant alteration in lymphocyte subset distribution and by a specific up-regulation of lymphocyte B2AR in phenotypically and functionally distinct T and B cells as well NK subpopulations, suggesting a possible denervation supersensitivity phenomenon.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "98": "Previous studies in non-excitable cells have suggested that depletion of internal Ca2+ stores activates Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space via a mechanism that does not require stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis. To test this hypothesis in vascular endothelial cells, the effect of the Ca(2+)-ATPase/pump inhibitor 2,5-di-t-butylhydroquinone (BHQ) on cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was examined. BHQ produced a dose-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i, which remained elevated over basal values for several minutes and was substantially inhibited in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Application of bradykinin after BHQ demonstrated that the BHQ-sensitive compartment partially overlapped the bradykinin-sensitive store. Similar results were obtained with thapsigargin and cyclopiazonic acid, two other Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitors. Although BHQ had no effect on phosphoinositide hydrolysis, both 45Ca2+ influx and efflux were stimulated by this agent. These results suggest that depletion of the agonist-sensitive Ca2+ store is sufficient for activation of Ca2+ influx. Several characteristics of the Ca(2+)-influx pathway activated by internal store depletion were compared with those of the agonist-activated pathway. Bradykinin-stimulated Ca2+ influx was increased at alkaline extracellular pH (pHo), and was inhibited by extracellular La3+, by depolarization of the membrane, and by the novel Ca(2+)-influx blocker 1-(beta-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxy]-4- methoxyphenethyl)-1H-imidazole hydrochloride (SKF 96365). Additionally, bradykinin stimulated influx of both 45Ca2+ and 133Ba2+, consistent with the hypothesis that the agonist-activated influx pathway is permeable to both of these bivalent cations. Likewise, activation of Ca2+ influx by BHQ, thapsigargin and cyclopiazonic acid was blocked by La3+, membrane depolarization and SKF 96365, but was unaffected by nitrendipine or BAY K 8644. Furthermore, Ca2+ influx stimulated by BHQ was increased at alkaline pHo and BHQ stimulated the influx of both 45Ca2+ and 133Ba2+ to the same extent. These results demonstrate that the agonist-activated Ca(2+)-influx pathway and the pathway activated by depletion of the agonist-sensitive internal Ca2+ store are indistinguishable.", 
    "99": "The hemodynamic response to propranolol in patients with cirrhosis is heterogeneous. In some patients, there is an expected decrease in portal pressure, whereas in others, portal pressure fails to decrease despite adequate beta-blockade. It has been suggested that this lack of response could be related to down-regulation of beta 2-adrenoceptors, promoted by the increased adrenergic activity frequently found in decompensated cirrhosis. The present study investigated this hypothesis by measuring the density and affinity of lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptors (L-beta 2-AR), an established index of beta 2-adrenoceptors in target organs, and the plasma levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine in a group of 32 patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. The portal pressure response to propranolol administration (0.1 mg/kg + 2 mg/h) was also investigated (n = 27). Patients with cirrhosis had increased norepinephrine levels (605 +/- 360 vs. 224 +/- 110 pg/mL in controls; P less than 0.001), but plasma epinephrine level was not increased (136 +/- 72 vs. 111 +/- 22 pg/mL in controls; NS). There were no differences between cirrhotic patients and controls in the density of L-beta 2-AR (1398 +/- 489 vs. 1278 +/- 356 receptors/cell; NS). Portal pressure decreased greater than 10% in 12 patients (responders) and less than 10% in the remaining 15 (nonresponders). Contrary to previous suggestions, there were no significant differences between responders and nonresponders in relation to the density of L-beta 2-AR (1362 +/- 527 vs. 1487 +/- 419 receptors/cell; NS), to the affinity of these receptors (0.15 +/- 0.27 vs. 0.13 +/- 0.12 nmol/L; NS), to the plasma levels of norepinephrine (661 +/- 508 vs. 621 +/- 256 pg/mL; NS), and to plasma epinephrine concentration (141 +/- 90 vs. 140 +/- 75 pg/mL; NS). These results show that the response of portal pressure to propranolol administration is neither related to the density and affinity of L-beta 2-AR nor to the plasma levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine. Thus, the determination of these parameters cannot substitute measurements of portal pressure to identify those patients with an adequate portal pressure response to propranolol treatment.", 
    "100": "Myocardial hypoxia is thought to be an important stimulus for increasing interstitial adenosine concentration. The adenosine hypothesis of coronary control was investigated during steady-state hypoxia by making measurements of coronary venous and epicardial well adenosine concentrations in adrenergically intact dogs and in animals with alpha- and beta-receptor blockade. In the adrenergically intact group, hypoxia sufficient to lower coronary venous oxygen tension to 8 mm Hg increased coronary blood flow 243% from normoxic values. Both coronary venous and epicardial well adenosine concentrations were increased throughout the hypoxic period. In the adrenergically blocked group, hypoxia to a similar level of coronary venous oxygen tension produced an increase in coronary blood flow of only 75%, which was significantly less than in the adrenergically intact group (p less than 0.01). Coronary venous adenosine was only transiently elevated, and epicardial well adenosine was unchanged from control levels. In a separate group of alpha- and beta-receptor-blocked animals that received an infusion of L-homocysteine thiolactone during hypoxia, there was no difference in tissue S-adenosylhomocysteine levels compared with those of normoxic controls. It is concluded that much of the coronary vasodilation associated with systemic hypoxia is dependent on adrenergic activation and that adenosine may only play a role in sustained hypoxic vasodilation when adrenergic receptors are intact.",

The main cause of this misdiagnosis was gonioscopy, as its findings are subject to the impression of the examiners. For objective examination of the chamber angle and the iris configuration, B-scan ultrasonography was performed using a contact eye cup filled with saline. Two groups of patients were noted in particular. The first group contained relatively young patients, more men than women, with plateau iris and a central normal, deep anterior chamber. The second group consisted of patients with presumed glaucoma simplex. The findings were quite different between eyes. In the eye with a higher IOP, pronounced optic nerve damage and visual field defect, the chamber angle was distinctly more narrow and closed. Most of the patients were treated with beta-blocker drops, which they felt were agreeable.",

In 16 cases the beta-blocker was administered as monotherapy and in the remaining patients atenolol was combined with a calcium antagonist and/or a diuretic. Dosage of these drugs was constant throughout the whole study. During an observation period of 12 weeks after halving atenolol from a mean dose of 82 mg to 41 mg, no significant changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure or in response rate (defined as a diastolic blood pressure of 95 mm Hg or less) were observed. In view of our results and those of other authors, it is recommended that in patients with mild hypertension whose blood pressure has been kept below 140/85 mm Hg by treatment for at least one year, betablockers may be reduced in a step-wise fashion.", 
    "106": "The development of hippocampal neuronal sensitivities to the beta-noradrenergic agent, isoproterenol, was examined in tissue from immature rats. The in vitro hippocampal slice preparation was used to assess intracellularly recorded responses from hippocampal neurons to pressure-pulse and bath application of noradrenergic drugs. Effects of the drug on individual hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons were compared across several stages of development, ranging from postnatal day 4-5 (P4-5) to maturity. Isoproterenol, pressure-pulse applied to CA3c pyramidal cells, produced a depolarization of membrane potential and an increase in cell input resistance in tissue as young as P7. Spike frequency adaptation (in trains of action potentials triggered by depolarizing pulses) was reduced, as were the slow after-hyperpolarizations following the spike trains. All agonist effects were blocked by timolol, a beta-antagonist. Drug-induced changes in cell membrane and firing properties in immature tissue were qualitatively similar to beta-receptor-mediated noradrenergic effects in adult tissue. These results indicate that the beta-receptor-mediated component of the noradrenergic effect in rat hippocampus is physiologically functional by the seventh day of postnatal life; at earlier times (P4-5) these beta-receptor-mediated noradrenergic actions are, at best, equivocal.",

    "114": "During continuous stimulation by agonist, beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors (ARs) undergo processes that lead to decreases in receptor expression. This receptor down-regulation serves to limit the cellular cAMP response during chronic agonist exposure. In the recently described third subtype of the beta AR, denoted beta 3AR, we found four potential cAMP response elements in the 5' flanking region, suggesting that expression of this receptor might be positively regulated by agonists. These elements were cloned into the vector pA10CAT2, which contains a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene, and transiently expressed in VERO cells. Three of these elements, TGACTCCA, TGAGGTCT, and CGAGGTCA (located 518, 622, and 1125 bases upstream of the beta 3AR coding block, respectively) were found to increase transcription of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene in response to cAMP analogues and agents that increase intracellular cAMP. 3T3-F442A cells, when differentiated into the adipocyte phenotype by insulin, expressed beta 3AR, and nuclear runoff studies from such cells confirmed cAMP enhancement of beta 3AR mRNA transcription. In these cells, beta 3AR mRNA increased in response to exposure to the beta 3AR agonist isoproterenol and remained elevated during exposures of up to 24-30 hr. During prolonged exposure to agonist, no downregulation of beta 3AR expression in 3T3-F442A cells occurred. Indeed, beta 3AR expression increased during agonist exposure to approximately 165% of basal expression. In marked contrast, beta 1AR expression declined by approximately 70% in response to chronic agonist exposure. These studies reveal a subtype-specific prolonged transcriptional regulation of a beta AR gene by the end product of its signal transduction pathway. Thus, the beta 3AR undergoes a paradoxical increase in receptor expression during chronic agonist exposure."
