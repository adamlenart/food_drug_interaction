    "0": "Transverse muscle strips, 2-mm wide, were cut serially from the gastroduodenal junction in opossums, cats, dogs, and man. Electrical field stimulation with trains of rectangular current pulses of 0.5 ms in all opossums, all cats, some dogs, and the one human specimen induced relaxation in strips from the thickened circular muscle proximal to the mucosal junction. In some opossums weak relaxations also occurred in the first few strips below the mucosal junction. All other strips contracted or showed no response. This relaxation in opossums was abolished by tetrodotoxin but was not affected by antagonists to adrenergic and cholinergic transmission, nor by tripelennamine, methysergide, pentagastrin, secretin, cerulein, or cholecystokinin. Optimal frequency for stimulus-relaxation was 12 Hz. Chronaxie was 0.85 ms. The junctional strips also showed greater resistances to stretch than those remote from the junction. With apparent species variations, the junctional muscle possesses a nonadrenergic inhibitory innervation which is either absent or unexpressed in adjacent muscle of stomach and duodenum. This suggests the existence of a distinctive inhibitory neural control mechanism for pyloric muscle.", 
    "1": "In a previous study we observed an increase in urinary cyclic AMP in labile hypertension in the upright position and during isoproterenol infusion, in contrast to a decrease in control subjects. In the present study we measured the plasma level of cyclic AMP in control subjects and patients with various types of hypertension. We obtained the following results: (1) plasma cyclic AMP increases in response to upright posture in control subjects and hypertensive patients; (2) values of cyclic AMP in the recumbent and upright positions are comparable in control subjects and patients with essential hypertension, but are significantly higher in those with true renovascular hypertension due to bilateral renal artery stenosis; (3) propranolol inhibits the increase of plasma cyclic AMP in response to posture in control subjects, but has an opposite effect in labile hypertension where there is a further increase; (4) the rise in blood pressure in pheochromocytoma is associated with a considerable increase in plasma cyclic AMP.Present and previous data suggest that kidney handling of cyclic AMP is abnormal in hypertension, and that the specific defect may be related to the type of hypertension.", 
    "2": "The mechanism of protamine-induced hypotension and bradycardia was investigated in anesthetized, heparinized dogs. Several groups of animals with intact circulation were studied for their responses to protamine under control conditions and following the administration of various pharmacological agents. The parameters observed include femoral arterial pressure (FAP), central venous pressure (CVP), left ventricular pressure (LVP) and its rate of rise (dp/dt), left ventricular contractile element velocity of shortening (Vce), maximal Vce (V max) and cardiac output (CO). Various groups were studied under the following pharmacological conditions: autonomic cholinergic blockade by atropine; alpha and beta adrenergic receptor blockade using phenoxybenzamine and propranolol respectively; ganglionic and adrenal medullary block using hexamethonium, and depletion of endogenous histamine by means of compound 48/80. Another group was placed on total cardiopulmonary bypass thus isolating the heart from the peripheral circulation. The effect of protamine on the vascular tree alone was then observed by monitoring FAP before and after protamine administration. The findings indicate that the cardiovascular effects of protamine are produced by a direct effect on the myocardium and vascular tree.", 
    "3": "5'-Guanylylimidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)-p) stimulates adenylate cyclase [ATP-pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4.6.1.1] activity in plasma membranes isolated from frog and salmon erythrocytes, from rat adrenal, hepatic, and fat cells, and from bovine thyroid cells. The nucleotide acts cooperatively with the various hormones (glucagon, secretin, ACTH, thyrotropin, and catecholamines) that stimulate these adenylate cyclase systems with resultant activities that equal or exceed those obtained with hormone plus GTP or with fluoride ion. In the absence of hormones, Gpp(NH)p is a considerably more effective activator than GTP, and, under certain conditions of incubation, stimulates rat fat cell adenylate cyclase to levels of activity (about 20 nmoles of 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate mg protein per min) far higher than reported hitherto for any adenylate cyclase system examined. The nucleotide activates frog erythrocyte adenylate cyclase when the catecholamine receptor is blocked by the competitive antagonist, propranolol, and activates the enzyme from an adrenal tumor cell line which lacks functional ACTH receptors. In contrast, Gpp(NH)p does not stimulate adenylate cyclase in extracts from Escherichia coli B. Gpp(NH)p appears to be a useful probe for investigating the mechanism of hormone and nucleotide action on adenylate cyclase systems in eukaryotic cells.", 
    "4": "1 In unanaesthetized pigeons, kept at room temperature (20-23 degrees C) the effects on cloacal temperature were examined of catecholamines, phenoxybenzamine and propranolol, injected into the cerebral ventricles.2 Noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine and isoprenaline caused a fall in cloacal temperature.3 Phenoxybenzamine produced a long-lasting small rise in cloacal temperature. This rise is attributed to removal of the hypothermic effect of noradrenaline released continuously from adrenergic neurones ending in the anterior hypothalamus. Propranolol produced a slight fall in cloacal temperature.4 The hypothermic effects of noradrenaline, adrenaline and dopamine were prevented by phenoxybenzamine but not by propranolol. They are therefore attributed to activation of alpha-adrenoceptors.5 The hypothermic effect of isoprenaline was not prevented by either phenoxybenzamine or propranolol. The effect can therefore not be attributed to activation of either alpha or beta-adrenoceptors. Propranolol actually accentuated the isoprenaline-induced hypothermia.", 
    "5": "1 The shortening of cycle length (=positive chronotropic effect) by ouabain produced in isolated spontaneously beating atria of the guinea-pig was analyzed.2 The action of ouabain was dose-dependent; threshold response was seen at 1 x 10(-7) M, and maximal response occurred at 4 x 10(-7) M. The half-time of the ouabain effect was about 20 minutes.3 The positive chronotropic effect of ouabain was reduced to 40% by beta-adrenoceptor blockade (3.3 x 10(-9) M propranolol) or by reserpine-depletion of catecholamines. Incubation of reserpine-treated atria with noradrenaline partially restored the action of ouabain.4 The effect of ouabain was greatly dependent upon the calcium concentration. The optimal calcium level was 2.5 x 10(-3) M. Calcium and ouabain acted synergistically.5 Increasing calcium concentrations inhibited the positive chronotropic effect of noradrenaline in a manner similar to increasing ouabain concentrations.6 A hypothesis is proposed which explains the chronotropic effect of ouabain on the basis of two mechanisms: (1) increase of the catecholamine concentration affecting the pacemaker; (2) mobilization of calcium, i.e. increase of the biologically effective intracellular calcium level.", 
    "6": "The effects of hemorrhage on arterial pressure, blood flows, and resistances in the coronary, mesenteric, renal, and iliac beds of healthy, conscious dogs and intact, tranquilized baboons were studied. Mild nonhypotensive hemorrhage (14+/-2 ml/kg) increased heart rate and mesenteric and iliac resistances slightly but significantly, and decreased renal resistance (-13+/-2%). Moderate hypotensive hemorrhage, 26+/-2 ml/kg, reduced mean arterial pressure (-23+/-2 mm Hg) and blood flows to the mesenteric (-56+/-3%), iliac (-58+/-5%), and coronary (-39+/-4%) vascular beds, and increased heart rate (+89+/-9 beats/min) and resistances in the mesenteric (+73+/-15%), iliac (+102+/-19%), and coronary (+27+/-5%) beds. In contrast to the other beds, renal flow rose 11+/-6% above control and renal resistance fell 31+/-2% below control. Renal vasodilatation with hemorrhage was also observed in five baboons. The increases in mesenteric and iliac resistances were blocked almost completely by phentolamine, while the increase in coronary resistance was only partially blocked by phentolamine. The renal dilatation was not blocked by phentolamine, propranolol, atropine, or tripelennamine, but was prevented by indomethacin, suggesting that this dilatation was mediated by a prostaglandin-like compound. Thus the peripheral vascular responses to hemorrhage involve intense vasoconstriction in the mesenteric and iliac beds. In the normal conscious dog and the intact, tranquilized primate, the renal bed does not share in the augmentation of total peripheral resistance with nonhypotensive and moderate hypotensive hemorrhage, but does with more severe hemorrhage. In fact, renal vasodilatation occurs with nonhypotensive or moderate hypotensive hemorrhage, which can be prevented by blockade of prostaglandin synthetase with indomethacin.", 
    "7": "1 Histamine (0.02-0.1 mug/ml) contracted the chicken rectum preparation. This effect was antagonized by mepyramine (0.01 mug/ml) but not by hyoscine (0.02 mug/ml).2 5-Hydroxytryptamine (0.05-0.25 mug/ml) relaxed the rectum preparation and at higher concentration produced a biphasic response. These responses were not antagonized by methysergide (0.01 mug/ml), and the relaxation was not antagonized by tetrodotoxin (0.1 mug/ml) or a combination of propranolol (0.05 mug/ml) and phentolamine (0.1 mug/ml).3 Neither mepyramine (0.1 mug/ml) nor methysergide (0.01 mug/ml) antagonized the contractions produced by nerve stimulation in vagus nerve/oesophagus and Remak nerve/rectum preparations.4 5-Hydroxytryptamine (2 mug/ml) in the presence of methysergide (0.01 mug/ml), inhibited the contractions produced by nerve stimulation in Remak nerve/rectum and vagus nerve/oesophagus preparations.5 Adenosine, adenosine 5'-phosphate (AMP), adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), in order of decreasing potency, produced slow contractions in most oesophagus preparations. The action of ATP in this preparation was antagonized by tetrodotoxin (0.1 mug/ml), hyoscine (0.1 mug/ml) and strychnine (5 mug/ml).6 Desensitization of the vagus nerve/oesophagus preparation to ATP did not produce any antagonism of the contractions to nerve stimulation.7 Adenosine and AMP produced relaxations and ADP and ATP contractions in the rectum preparation. ATP was about 100 times as potent as ADP in producing fast contractions which were not antagonized by tetrodotoxin, hyoscine or strychnine.8 Desensitization of the Remak nerve/rectum preparation to ATP resulted in the contractions to nerve stimulation and acetylcholine being inhibited to the same extent.9 Prostaglandin E(2) produced slow contractions in the oesophagus and rectum preparations which were not antagonized by tetrodotoxin (0.1 mug/ml). Polyphloretin phosphate (10 mug/ml) antagonized spontaneous movements and responses to prostaglandin E(2) in the rectum but not the oesophagus.10 Neither polyphloretin phosphate (60 mug/ml) nor indomethacin (20-100 mug/ml) antagonized the contractions produced by nerve stimulation in vagus nerve/oesophagus (with hyoscine in the bathing solution) and Remak nerve/rectum preparations.11 These experiments seem to exclude histamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, adenosine and its nucleotides and prostaglandin E(2) as possible motor transmitters in synapses and neuromuscular junctions in the chicken vagus nerve/oesophagus and Remak nerve/rectum preparations."
