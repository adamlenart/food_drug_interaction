    "0": "Lean body mass and muscle protein breakdown were evaluated in euthyroid and hyperthyroid subjects by measuring the urinary excretion of creatinine and 3-methylhistidine. Since catecholamines probably have an inhibitory effect on muscle protein catabolism through a beta-receptor mechanism, the effects of propranolol on 3-methylhistidine excretion were also evaluated in hyperthyroid subjects. Hyperthyroid subjects had a lower lean body mass (34.9 +/- 6.3 kg versus 47.7 +/- 8.9 kg, p less than 0.001) and a greater 3-methylhistidine excretion (25.1 +/- 7.4 versus 19.0 +/- 4.8 mumol/mmol creatinine, p less than 0.05) than euthyroid subjects. Propranolol administered orally to hyperthyroid subjects decreased pulse rate (p less than 0.01) and plasma triiodothyronine concentrations (from 5.40 +/- 2.28 to 3.61 +/- 1.61 nmol/l, p less than 0.01), but did not modify urinary 3-methylhistidine excretion (24.8 +/- 8.7 versus 25.1 +/- 7.4 mumol/mmol creatinine). These results suggest that muscle wasting in hyperthyroidism is related to increased protein catabolism. This increased protein breakdown is not modified by short term administration of propranolol, a beta-blocking agent widely used in the management of hyperthyroidism.", 
    "1": "Tyramine may be used to stimulate release of endogenous norepinephrine. We have compared the increases in blood pressure and plasma catecholamines in normal volunteers during (a) tyramine infusions, and (b) the more physiological sympathetic stimulus of cold exposure. In a second study, the cardiac component of the pressor effect of tyramine was assessed by measuring systolic time intervals, and by infusing tyramine in beta-blocked subjects. Tyramine, 15.0 micrograms/kg/min for 30 min, elevated systolic BP from 122 +/- 11 to 149 +/- 4 mm Hg, without increasing diastolic BP or heart rate. Plasma norepinephrine rose from 0.547 +/- 0.184 to 0.836 +/- 0.096 ng/ml; plasma epinephrine was unchanged. Thirty-min exposure to 4 degrees C elevated both systolic BP (from 105 +/- 8 to 116 +/- 9 mm Hg) and diastolic BP (from 72 +/- 4 to 81 +/- 6 mm Hg). This was associated with a greater rise in plasma norepinephrine, from 0.357 +/- 0.131 to 1.143 +/- 0.393 ng/ml; plasma epinephrine was again unchanged. A single oral dose of propranolol 160 mg caused approximately a two-fold right shift in the systolic BP dose response to tyramine, and blocked the tyramine-induced shortening of the presystolic ejection period. Tyramine appears to exert its pressor effect mainly by stimulation of cardiac beta-receptors. This may account for the relatively small rise in plasma norepinephrine (relative to cold exposure) since the heart does not contribute a high proportion of circulating norepinephrine.", 
    "2": "The cardiovascular profile of the nifedipine analog, CGP 28 392, was studied in instrumented conscious dogs. CGP 28 392 (25, 50, 100, and 150 micrograms/kg) was administered intravenously, and systemic and coronary hemodynamics monitored with and without prior treatment with nifedipine, phentolamine, propranolol, or atropine. CGP 28 392 increased arterial blood pressure and coronary vascular resistance in a dose-related manner and reduced heart rate. No positive inotropic actions were observed. All hemodynamic effects of CGP 28 392 were blocked by nifedipine but were unaltered by phentolamine. The decrease in heart rate was attenuated by atropine and propranolol. These data demonstrate that the actions of CGP 28 392 are diametrically opposed to those of the dihydropyridine slow channel calcium entry blockers and are specifically blocked by nifedipine. The cardiovascular actions of this compound (with the exception of bradycardia) are not mediated through the autonomic nervous system, and interactions with other pharmacological agents suggest that CGP 28 392 has calcium channel activating properties.", 
    "3": "Rats were treated with methimazole or thyroxine to render them either hypothyroid or hyperthyroid. Left atria from these animals and from control, untreated rats were isolated, placed in organ baths, and paced by direct electrical stimulation delivered via a punctate electrode. Contractile responses to trains of stimuli at 0.01-6 Hz were recorded isometrically. Atria from methimazole-treated rats required less voltage to elicit submaximal contractions; these were greater in magnitude and duration than those recorded from control preparations. The reverse was observed for preparations from hyperthyroid rats. Thyroid state had a marked influence upon the pattern of contractions elicited by trains of stimuli at varying frequencies. Atria from control rats displayed a typical negative interval-strength relationship, i.e., a decrease in contractile amplitude as the interval between stimuli in a train was decreased. This negative relationship was more pronounced in left atria from hypothyroid rats. In preparations from hyperthyroid rats, increases in stimulation frequency resulted in elevations in contractile amplitude. These observations are discussed in the light of known actions of thyroid hormone upon cardiac contractile mechanisms.", 
    "4": "Levonordefrin, a common alternative to levoepinephrine as a vasoconstrictor in dental local anesthetic preparations, is usually used in fivefold higher concentrations, and, as such, is generally considered equivalent to epinephrine. We used anesthetized dogs that had autonomic reflexes blocked by mecamylamine to reevaluate the cardiovascular actions of intravenously administered nordefrin with respect to those of epinephrine and norepinephrine over a 100-fold dose range (0.1-10.0 micrograms/kg). Epinephrine caused a significantly greater pressor effect than nordefrin only at the highest dose studied; at low to moderate doses there was no significant difference between the two drugs. Blockade of alpha-adrenoceptors with phentolamine attenuated the peak pressor effects of all three agents. The epinephrine dose-response curve was suppressed more than the curves for norephinephrine and nordefrin, which were not significantly different from each other. Nordefrin was indistinguishable qualitatively from norepinephrine in that neither agent showed any evidence of beta 2-adrenoceptor vasodilation as seen with epinephrine. These findings suggest that nordefrin resembles norepinephrine rather than epinephrine in the receptor profile through which it produces its cardiovascular effects, and that the true potency difference between nordefrin and epinephrine with respect to pressor activity may be somewhat less than the fivefold difference commonly assumed.", 
    "5": "The characteristics of beta 2-adrenoceptors were studied in vivo in the microcirculation of cremaster muscle and mesoappendix in rats, cheek pouch in hamsters, and mesentery in guinea pigs, using a video-microscope technique. Terbutaline (beta 2-selective agonist) caused vasodilatation in all four microcirculation preparations studied, whereas butoxamine (beta 2-selective antagonist) competitively inhibited the terbutaline-induced vasodilatation. The in vivo pA2 values of butoxamine inhibition of terbutaline vasodilator effect were estimated from Schild plots. The pA2 values (6.22-6.31) were statistically identical in all four microcirculations studied and similar to in vitro values reported in other tissues. In contrast, tazolol and prenalterol (both beta 1-selective agonists) did not produce any vasodilatation in the microcirculations studied. These results supported the existence of beta 2-adrenoceptors involved in vasodilatation in the microcirculation.", 
    "6": "The hemodynamic effects of injections of arginine-vasopressin (AVP) at different doses were measured before and after administration of atropine (250 micrograms/kg), propranolol (2 mg/kg), or phenoxybenzamine (5 mg/kg) in conscious dogs. Measurements of arterial pressure derived from a chronic indwelling catheter, and aortic flow derived from an aortic electromagnetic flow probe, were digitized and analyzed by computer to assess mean and pulsatile arterial pressure, cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, heart rate, and other hemodynamic variables. AVP alone moderately increased arterial pressure and decreased cardiac output and heart rate. For doses between 20 and 40 ng/kg, mean arterial pressure increased by 17.4 +/- 1.5 mm Hg. After atropine, the same dose of AVP increased pressure by 51.6 +/- 3.2 mm Hg. The bradycardiac response to AVP was blunted by atropine as was the decrease in cardiac output. The effect of AVP on total peripheral resistance was not affected by atropine. Neither alpha- nor beta-adrenergic blockade enhanced the pressor effect of arginine-vasopressin. Our results indicate that the potentiation of the pressor response to AVP previously reported with total autonomic blockade is largely due to preventing a vagallymediated decrease in cardiac output in conscious dogs.", 
    "7": "We studied the comparative effects of beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol (PROP) and bucindolol (BUC), a beta-adrenergic agonist having both alpha-adrenergic blocking properties and intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) on airway and cardiovascular responses, in 38 mongrel dogs in situ. Intravenous infusion of 0.6 mg/kg + 6 micrograms/kg/min BUC and 2.0 mg/kg + 20 micrograms/kg/min PROP caused identical shifts in the isoproterenol (ISO) EC50 for chronotropic and hypotensive arterial blood pressure responses. After PROP administration, resting heart rate (HR) decreased from 188 +/- 15 to 142 +/- 12 beats/min (p less than 0.02); BUC caused no decrease in HR. In contrast, the effects of BUC and PROP on mean arterial blood pressure response to ISO were similar. No change in bronchomotor tone was observed after bolus injection of either BUC or PROP. Beta-Adrenergic relaxation to ISO and alpha-adrenergic contraction to norepinephrine (NE) were studied simultaneously in tracheal and bronchial airways using chronotropically equivalent beta-adrenoceptor blocking doses of PROP and BUC. Comparable inhibition of ISO-induced airway relaxation after contraction with 120 micrograms/kg/min i.v. serotonin was demonstrated in both PROP (n = 5) and BUC (n = 5) groups (p less than 0.01 for doses greater than 5 X 10(-11) mol/kg). Similarly, both BUC (n = 5) and PROP (n = 5) blocked beta-adrenergic relaxation and caused identical alpha-adrenergic airway contraction to intravenous NE. We conclude that the ISA of the beta-adrenergic blocking drug BUC can be demonstrated on the spontaneous rate of the heart but not on the activity of bronchial smooth muscle. BUC neither augments ISO-induced relaxation nor inhibits NE-induced contraction of airways after effective chronotropic blockade.", 
    "8": "Hemodynamic and myocardial metabolic parameters in ischemic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction were evaluated in response to the beta-agonist prenalterol. Twenty micrograms/kg intravenous prenalterol increased resting heart rate and cardiac output and decreased LV filling pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and pulmonary artery pressure. Resting coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen consumption increased but net myocardial lactate and oxygen extraction did not change significantly. During pacing induced tachycardia (121 +/- 4 beats/min), prenalterol improved cardiac index and stroke work index; whereas, LV filling pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and pulmonary artery pressure decreased. Coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen extraction did not change significantly. Net myocardial lactate extraction during pacing decreased insignificantly; one patient developed overt lactate production. Thus, prenalterol improves cardiovascular function at rest and during pacing-induced tachycardia in ischemic LV failure, but at the cost of higher resting myocardial oxygen consumption. The majority of subjects had no adverse metabolic response.", 
    "9": "The hemodynamic and cardiac effects of the calcium antagonist nicardipine, alone (n = 10 patients) or combined with propranolol (0.1 mg/kg i.v.; n = 9 patients), were assessed in patients with coronary artery disease. In the absence of beta-blockade, nicardipine (5 or 10 mg i.v.) increased heart rate (+23 and +15 beats/min after 5 and 10 mg, respectively; p less than 0.01) and cardiac output (from 4.7 +/- 1.1 to 7.4 +/- 1.3 L/min after 5 mg and from 5.1 +/- 1.1 to 8.6 +/- 1.6 L/min after 10 mg; p less than 0.005). Systemic vascular resistance decreased with both doses (-46 and -57%; p less than 0.005), whereas mean aortic pressure decreased by 14 mm Hg after 5 mg and by 28 mm Hg after 10 mg (p less than 0.004); left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was unchanged. Nicardipine also decreased significantly end-systolic left ventricular volume and increased ejection fraction (from 63 to 71% after 5 mg and from 54 to 63% after 10 mg; p less than 0.008) and velocity of shortening. Peak (+) dP/dt and (dP/dt)/DP40 (value of dP/dt at a developed pressure of 40 mm Hg) were unchanged, and Emax, the maximal left ventricular pressure/volume ratio, improved slightly (+8%; p less than 0.05). After beta-blockade, nicardipine (2.5 mg i.v.) still decreased mean aortic pressure (-16 mm Hg; p less than 0.05) and systemic vascular resistance, and improved the ejection phase indices; cardiac output and ventricular relaxation, both depressed after propranolol administration, were also normalized after infusion of nicardipine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "10": "Twelve postmyocardial infarction patients, with angiographically proven asynergic areas, but without overt cardiac failure, were treated with prenalterol intravenously, (a new cardioselective inotropic agent) at a dose of 30 micrograms/kg. The aim of this study was to test the usefulness and safety of this new drug in postmyocardial infarction patients, monitoring systolic and diastolic acute hemodynamic changes. Significant improvement in cardiac contractility was demonstrated by the increase of ejection fraction (+23%), stroke volume index (+22%), cardiac output (+41%), positive dp/dt (+82%), and Vmaxd (+39%). Left ventricular systolic, mean aortic, and mean right atrial pressure remained unchanged; a slight decrease in end-diastolic volume index (-2%) occurred. A significant increase in heart rate (from 66 +/- 7 to 85 +/- 14 beats/min), without electrocardiographic changes or subjective complaints of angina pectoris, was observed. Segmental wall motion analysis showed an improved systolic shortening in normal (from 34 to 44%) and in asynergic areas (from 10 to 18%), whereas no changes were observed in dyskinetic areas. The relaxation and filling phase also improved, as tested by negative dp/dt (+39%), time constant of relaxation (-36%), and by indices of ventricular compliance. Side effects consisted of a slight feeling of tension in two patients and a short episode of ventricular tachycardia (5 beats) in another patients. No episode of angina pectoris was observed. These results, with special emphasis on lack of exacerbation of pre-existing ischemia (although obtained in patients without evident heart failure), suggest the potential usefulness of prenalterol in acute cardiac failure, as well as postmyocardial infarction low-output syndrome.", 
    "11": "We examined the effects of prolonged exposure of cardiac cells in primary culture to the partial beta-adrenoceptor agonist prenalterol and inhibitors of phosphodiesterase on their subsequent ability to increase intracellular cyclic AMP during a 5-min exposure to 50 microM isoprenaline (receptor responsiveness). Although prenalterol possesses only 7% of the agonist activity of isoprenaline on adenylate cyclase, it induces extensive beta-adrenoceptor desensitization. Three hours after exposing the cells to 1 microM prenalterol, beta-adrenoceptor responsiveness was reduced by 40% (p less than 0.05), whereas after 12 h the reduction averaged 55%. Prolonging the incubation time to 48 h had no further effect on the magnitude of receptor desensitization. The magnitude of the desensitization was concentration dependent. On exposure of cells to 10(-8) M prenalterol for 16 h, receptor responsiveness was reduced by 19%, and at concentrations of 1 microM and higher responsiveness was reduced by 60% (p less than 0.01). Receptor desensitization appeared to be due to an inability of receptors to activate adenylate cyclase as well as to receptor loss. To investigate if beta-adrenoceptor desensitization as well as receptor loss could be mediated by cyclic AMP, the cells were exposed for 16 h to inhibitors of phosphodiesterase. Exposure of cells to the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine (0.1 mM) (which increased intracellular cyclic AMP by between 50 and 150%) also induced receptor desensitization. The reduction in receptor responsiveness averaged 62% (p less than 0.01). The loss in responsiveness could be accounted for by an inability of receptors to activate adenylate cyclase as well as by receptor loss.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "12": "Calcium channel blockade appears to be at least as effective as beta-blockade in the treatment of anginal syndromes, but whether a similar protective effect is afforded against sudden death is unknown. In order to compare experimental antifibrillatory effects of calcium channel blockade (diltiazem), beta-adrenoceptor blockade (timolol), and nitroglycerin, we measured ventricular fibrillation (VF) thresholds in anesthetized, open-chest dogs before and after 3 min of coronary ischemia before and after i.v. administration of each of these drugs or saline. In control studies, VF occurred after delivery of 11.8 +/- 5.3 mA (X +/- SD) in the nonischemic state and 9.4 +/- 4.6 mA during ischemia (n = 25). During saline administration, no significant change in VF threshold occurred during ischemia, and a minimal increase over time occurred in the nonischemic state. Diltiazem (0.04-0.08 mg/kg/min; n = 10) increased VF thresholds under both ischemic (by 7.7 mA, p less than .01) and nonischemic (by 5.5-5.8 mA, p less than .05) conditions. Timolol (0.03 mg/kg; n = 8) caused substantially greater increases in VFT during nonischemia and ischemia: 11.2 +/- 2.8 mA to 51.6 +/- 38.5 mA (nonischemia) and 8.4 +/- 3.8 mA to 28.7 +/- 16.4 mA (ischemia), both p less than 0.02. VF thresholds were not changed after nitroglycerin (n = 8). Differing experimental effects of these drugs emphasize the need for clinical studies to establish the relative potential of calcium channel blockade and nitroglycerin to reduce mortality in ischemic heart disease.", 
    "13": "The effects of different concentrations of caffeine on the electrical and mechanical events of ventricular myocardial fibers of the dog were studied in vitro under conditions that alter cellular calcium. Caffeine was found to: (a) increase the contractile force quickly and then slowly in a dose-dependent manner, causing contracture only at high concentrations; (b) shift to more positive values and shorten the plateau, slow the final phase III repolarization, and cause a slow return of potential to the resting value during diastole at high concentrations; (c) increase the magnitude but retard the relaxation of the twitch; (d) cause these effects independently of alpha- or beta-adrenergic mechanisms; (e) shift the plateau to more negative values in the absence of calcium; (f) shift the plateau of the slow response action potentials to more positive values and increase the contractile force without prolonging the late phase III in high K; (g) induce less pronounced effects in the presence of local anesthetics or tetrodotoxin; (h) still increase force in the presence of manganese, verapamil, and ryanodine; (i) induce more pronounced effects in the presence of strophantidin; and (j) retard the fall in contractile force on exposure to zero calcium. It is concluded that caffeine, in addition to and as a consequence of other actions, enhances cellular calcium, which in turn is responsible for some of the electrical and mechanical effects of caffeine.", 
    "14": "Acebutolol, a cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent, was administered for 48 weeks to 11 patients with chronic stable angina in a single-blind trial for determining efficacy and safety. As expected, beta-adrenergic blockade reduced angina frequency and improved exercise performance (p less than 0.001). Three patients developed an antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer, and in two patients a low titer present during placebo treatment increased fourfold. Two patients had joint symptoms probably related to acebutolol administration. Readministration of acebutolol after the ANA returned to negative resulted in a significant rise in ANA titer in two patients tested. The other nine patients tolerated long-term acebutolol therapy without significant side effects.", 
    "15": "In the presence of the cholinergic antagonist atropine, electrical field stimulation (FS) (5-20 Hz) caused a marked, reversible increase in the amylase output from superfused rat pancreatic segments. Adrenaline and noradrenaline evoked dose-dependent increases in amylase output which were similar to those produced by FS. The FS- and catecholamine-evoked amylase secretions were abolished by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. The FS-evoked secretion could be abolished by either the removal of external Ca2+ or the application of tetrodotoxin (TTX, 2 X 10(-6) M). FS also resulted in a reversible increase in the fractional efflux of tritium (3H) from rat pancreatic tissues preincubated with either 3H-noradrenaline or 3H-adrenaline. The effects of FS (5-20 Hz) on 3H efflux were abolished by TTX (2 X 10(-6) M). TTX had no effect on the enhancement of 3H efflux caused by elevation of external potassium concentration (high K+, 75 mM). Removal of superfusate Ca2+ completely abolished both the FS- and high K+-induced increases in 3H efflux. These observations suggest that intrinsic nerve stimulation (i.e. FS) results in the Ca2+-dependent release of sympathetic neurotransmitter, noradrenaline, which has a direct secretory action on the rat pancreas. Furthermore, the findings suggest that adrenaline can be taken up by nervous elements. This raises the possibility that uptake and re-release of circulating adrenaline might contribute to the control of rat pancreatic enzyme secretion by the adrenergic nervous system.", 
    "16": "Isoprenaline, but not prenalterol, produced positive inotropy in guinea-pig papillary muscle. Prenalterol was a competitive antagonist of responses to isoprenaline in this tissue with a pKB of 7.24, as estimated by a Schild regression. Guinea-pig papillary muscles pretreated with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, isobutylmethylxanthine (IMX), were 10 times more sensitive than controls to isoprenaline. In these tissues, prenalterol was a partial agonist producing 68% of the maximal response to isoprenaline. Schild regressions with atenolol indicated no change in beta-adrenoreceptors with IMX treatment and also that isoprenaline and prenalterol activated the same receptor in this tissue. The relative efficacy of isoprenaline and prenalterol was measured by using the KB estimated by Schild analysis for prenalterol and a Kd for isoprenaline from published binding studies. The relative efficacy of these drugs (epsilon ISO/epsilon PREN) was 242 +/- 29. The general method of potentiation of responses to weak agonists to estimate relative efficacy is discussed.", 
    "17": "Electrophysiologic studies were performed in 11 patients (9 men, 2 women; mean age: 59.9 yrs) who had survived an episode of cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation. The purpose of the studies was to evaluate the usefulness of serial acute drug testing in selecting an effective chronic antiarrhythmic regimen. Ten of the patients were suffering from chronic ischemic heart disease with one or more previous myocardial infarctions while one had no evidence of structural heart disease. A ventricular aneurysm was present in four of them. During control electrophysiologic study, a sustained VT was induced by ventricular stimulation (single and double extrastimuli at various paced ventricular cycle lengths plus bursts of rapid ventricular pacing) in nine of the ten patients (90%) who were studied while not receiving antiarrhythmic drugs; a non-sustained VT was induced in one of them (10%). In three patients (30%) VT could be initiated only by right ventricular stimulation at a side different from the apex (outflow tract). No arrhythmia was observed in the only patient who was studied while taking amiodarone orally (400 mg/day for more than three months). During serial acute drug testing a totally effective drug regimen (successful in preventing the induction of any ventricular arrhythmia) was found in seven of the ten patients (70%) who underwent this procedure and a partially effective drug regimen (a sustained VT was no longer inducible; it was easier to interrupt and it was considerably slower) was found in two patients (20%). None of the nine patients who received chronic antiarrhythmic therapy based on the results of serial acute drug testing died suddenly during a mean follow-up of 14 months (range: 3-28) and only one had a recurrence of cardiac arrest. The latter, however, was taking antiarrhythmic drugs at a dosage less than that proved to be effective during electropharmacological testing. The only patient who refused serial acute drug testing and received an empiric antiarrhythmic therapy died suddenly at the 21st month of follow-up. These results indicate that serial electropharmacological testing is useful in selecting an effective long-term drug regimen in survivors of cardiac arrest.", 
    "18": "When exposed to the beta-agonist (-)-isoproterenol, rat glioma C6 cells exhibited a time-and concentration-dependent reduction in isoproterenol responsiveness (desensitization) and a loss of beta-adrenergic receptors (down-regulation). Other agents, such as dibutyryl cyclic AMP, isobutylmethylxanthine, and cholera toxin, all of which elevate intracellular cyclic AMP levels, also induced receptor down-regulation but at a much slower rate than isoproterenol. Loss of beta-receptors was detected with intact cells, cell lysates, and cell membranes. Receptor loss was accompanied by a reduction in isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP production and adenylate cyclase activity. For a given amount of receptor loss, this reduction was much greater with isoproterenol than with other agents. In addition, the concentration of isoproterenol required for half-maximal stimulation of cyclic AMP production was increased in cells treated with isoproterenol but not with isobutylmethylxanthine or dibutyryl cyclic AMP. The affinity of beta-receptors for the agonist was also lower in membranes from cells treated with isoproterenol but not the other agents. Prior treatment of the cells with cycloheximide inhibited receptor loss by isoproterenol but did not prevent desensitization or reduced affinity of beta-receptors for the agonist. Cycloheximide also blocked the loss of receptors induced by dibutyryl cyclic AMP and, in addition, prevented a reduction in agonist-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. We propose that desensitization is mediated in rat glioma C6 cells only by agonists and is not dependent on either cyclic AMP or protein synthesis. Down-regulation can be induced both by agonists and by cyclic AMP and does depend on protein synthesis. Thus, desensitization and down-regulation can occur independently.", 
    "19": "The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of somatostatin on gastric acid secretion and gastric antral motility in conscious dogs with gastric fistula. Infusion of pentagastrin induced motility with a digestive pattern. Somatostatin inhibited dose-dependently the stimulated acid secretion, whereas the effect on antral motility was more complex, acting especially on the amplitude of the contractions. The effects of somatostatin were not altered by using alpha- and beta-adrenergic, dopaminergic, and serotonergic blocking drugs. The dose-response kinetics with seven doses of pentagastrin with and without somatostatin showed inhibition of a competitive type for gastric acid secretion and of a non-competitive type for antral motility with regard to amplitude.", 
    "20": "Experiments were carried out to study the effect of sydnocarb 3-(beta-phenylisopropyl)-N-phenylcarbamoyl-sydnonimine), a stimulant of mental and physical performance, and its combination with obsidan, a beta-adrenoblocking agent, on the central and peripheral hemodynamics during a head-up test (+75 degrees) after a 6-hour head-down tilt (-15 degrees). Sydnocarb increased the tone of brain and leg arterioles, left unchanged stroke volume and cardiac output, and decreased the postural increment of heart rate. Sydnocarb (15 mg) combined with obsidan (20 mg) reduced heart rate and its postural increment, increased stroke volume, and increased the tone of resistive vessels, as was also the effect of sydnocarb taken separately.", 
    "21": "Effect of concurrent administration of sucralfate on the bioavailability of indenolol in rats has been investigated. Albino rats were administered with lg/kg body weight of sucralfate just before the oral administration of indenolol solution (10 mg/kg), blood samples were collected at 0,15,30,45,60,120,240 and 360 minutes after the administration of drugs. Indenolol concentration was determined spectrofluorometrically, 2,4, and 6-hour Area Under the Curve (AUC) was calculated. The peak indenolol blood concentration was observed at 45th minute of drug administration. The level in rats treated with indenolol alone (2.46 +/- 0.07 microgram/ml) and indenolol along with sucralfate (1.21 +/- 0.06 microgram/ml) suggested more than a 50% decrease. There were 36.4%, 27.2% and 20.4% decrease in 2-hour AUC, 4-hour AUC and 6-hour AUC respectively. The data suggest that sucralfate significantly decreased the absorption of indenolol, especially in the early phase after administration and clinically significant interaction may occur due to concurrent administration of indenolol with sucralfate.", 
    "22": "The effects of systemic injections of vasoactive substances were studied in the micro-circulation of the hamster skin fold window preparation, which can be observed without anesthesia, exposure, and acute surgical procedures. The effects were characterized by the continuous measurement of the diameter of the arterial microvessels ranging from 100 to 8 micron. Power spectrum analysis was utilized to determine the frequency and the amplitude of the fundamental component of spontaneous diameter changes. Epinephrine and norepinephrine increased the frequency of vasomotion and reduced mean diameter at low dosages. Phentolamine reduced the frequency of vasomotion and increased mean diameter. Propranolol increased the frequency of vasomotion and did not significantly change mean diameter. Adenosine and verapamil suppressed vasomotion and increased mean diameter. These results are explained by postulating that low-dosage alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation facilitates the spontaneous discharge of smooth muscle cells; beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation has the opposite effect, whereas beta-adrenergic receptor inhibition also enhances the vasomotor effect. Calcium entry blockers abolish the rhythmic discharge. This explanation of the activity of the various substances supports the hypothesis that the spontaneous vasomotion of the arterial microvessels is related to the intrinsic property of smooth muscle cells.", 
    "23": "Interruption of long-term treatment with alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonists may be associated with reversal of their hemodynamic effects, clinical and biochemical evidence of increased peripheral sympathetic activity, and behavioral responses similar to those seen after narcotic or alcohol withdrawal. Reactions are most commonly observed after short-acting imidazoline drugs such as clonidine and tiamenidine. Reactions are less common after longer acting agents such as guanfacine. A new management approach to withdrawal has been evaluated, which uses a combination of alpha 1-blockade (prazosin) and cardioselective beta-blockade (atenolol) together with a benzodiazepine (chlordiazepoxide). Withdrawal reactions were not observed in eight patients in whom clonidine was withdrawn under cover of these agents. The mechanism of the withdrawal reaction may involve agonist-induced down regulation of alpha 2-adrenergic receptor affinity, number, or both. Experimental studies with the irreversible alpha-antagonist phenoxybenzamine on the turnover of alpha 2-receptors suggest that recovery of receptor number may be much slower in the brain than in the periphery.", 
    "24": "Effects of catecholamines on plasma uric acid and allantoin levels were studied in oxonate-treated rats and non-treated rats. 1) In non-treated rats, epinephrine, isoproterenol and phenylephrine, which were injected intravenously, clearly increased plasma uric acid and allantoin, and norepinephrine had only a slight effect. The orders of potency to increase plasma uric acid and allantoin were epinephrine greater than isoproterenol greater than phenylephrine greater than norepinephrine. Beta-adrenoceptor agonists also increased plasma uric acid and allantoin in non-treated rats. The order of potency to increase plasma uric acid was isoproterenol salbutamol trimetoquinol greater than terbutaline, and that of potency to increase plasma allantoin was isoproterenol salbutamol greater than or equal to trimetoquinol greater than terbutaline. 2) In oxonate-treated rats, the four beta-adrenoceptor agonists (50 micrograms/kg, i.v.) markedly potentiated the hyperuricemic effect of oxonate. These effects of beta-adrenoceptor agonists were inhibited by propranolol (2.0 mg/kg. i.v.). In addition, the effect of isoproterenol was inhibited by butoxamine (1.0 mg/kg, i.v.), but not by atenolol (1.0 mg/kg, i.v.). These results suggest that hyperuricemia induced by catecholamines is closely related to beta 2-adrenoceptor action.", 
    "25": "We evaluated antiarrhythmic effects of N-696 using canine digitalis ventricular arrhythmia models and electrophysiological actions of N-696 using canine ventricular muscles and isolated blood perfused A-V node preparations and compared the effects with those of propranolol. 1) N-696 at 30 mg/kg, i.v. was not effective on digitalis arrhythmia, but reduced the total heart rate and atrial rate for 60 min and transiently decreased the blood pressure. Propranolol at 3 mg/kg, i.v. transiently suppressed digitalis ventricular arrhythmia and decreased the total heart rate, atrial rate and blood pressure. The minimum effective plasma concentration of propranolol was 1.7 +/- 0.4 microgram/ml. 2) Ten to 100 micrograms/ml N-696 and 3 to 10 micrograms/ml propranolol did not affect the resting potential and the action potential duration at 75% repolarization of the canine ventricular muscle, but decreased the maximum rate of rise of the action potential in a dose-dependent fashion, and 100 micrograms/ml N-696 decreased significantly the action potential amplitude. The minimum effective drug concentration of N-696 was 60 micrograms/ml, and that of propranolol was 6 micrograms/ml. 3) N-696 (30 micrograms-3mg) dose-dependently delayed the A-V conduction time of the isolated blood perfused A-V node preparation when it was administered into the posterior septal artery (PSA) and the anterior septal artery (ASA). Propranolol (10-600 micrograms) also had similar effects, but the doses of N-696 delaying the A-V conduction time by 15% was about 8 to 21 times higher than those of propranolol.", 
    "26": "During the past 17 years at the Department f\u00fcr Pediatric Surgery, University of Heidelberg, 38 children aged 1.6 to 14 years were adrenalectomized (unilateral 3.3, bilateral 5). Individual diagnoses were: neuroblastoma 23; pheochromocytoma 5; adrenocortical carcinoma 8; adrenocortical adenoma 4; bilateral nodular hyperplasia 2 cases. Patients with histologically benign lesions are alive and without recurrence more than 5 years after surgery, except one patient who developed Nelson's tumor after bilateral adrenalectomy for Cushing's disease. Of the patients with malignant adrenal tumors 21 died within 18 months after therapy was started, a 7 years old girl with an adrenal carcinoma died after a period of 3.6 years of combined treatment. In most cases of adrenocortical tumors virilization was the prominent feature.", 
    "27": "Effects of K-351 (3,4-dihydro-8-(2-hydroxy-3-isopropyl-aminopropoxy)-3-nitroxy++ +-2H-1-benzopyran) on hemodynamics and renin release were investigated in pentobarbital anesthetized dogs. K-351 (0.3 mg/kg, i.v.) significantly decreased systemic blood pressure, heart rate, mesenteric blood flow, and renin secretion rate without change in renal blood flow. Degree of hypotension and basal plasma renin activity showed significant correlation. In indomethacin-treated (5 mg/kg, i.v.) dogs, K-351 decreased renal blood flow and caused smaller decrease in systemic blood pressure and larger suppression of renin secretion rate than in non-treated dogs. These results suggest that the hypotensive effect of K-351 may be due in part to suppression of the renin-angiotensin system and may be modulated by the prostaglandin system.",

Basic principles have been emphasized because current understanding requires it.", 
    "29": "Sulfinpyrazone increased the number of beta-adrenoceptors (+ 17-40%) on intact human lymphocytes at concentrations ranging from 10(-5) to 2 X 10(-4) M. It affected the Bmax (187 +/- 6 and 142 +/- 5 fmol mg-1 protein respectively with and without sulfinpyrazone, P less than 0.001) but did not influence KD (4.4 +/- 0.3 and 4.6 +/- 0.7 nM with and without the drug). This effect was observed on either washed or unwashed lymphocyte membrane preparations. These findings have several pharmacological and therapeutic implications.", 
    "30": "The effect of reduction in temperature of perfusion from 37 to 27 degrees C and 20 degrees C on the ability of the adrenoceptor antagonists indoramin and labetalol to block pressor responses to noradrenaline in the perfused mesenteric vascular bed of the rat was examined. The results suggest that in rat mesenteric bed, antagonist potency of both agents is increased at low temperatures.", 
    "31": "Several lines of evidence (binding studies, reduced responsiveness of brain adenylate cyclase to noradrenergic stimulation) indicate that chronic treatment with electroconvulsive shock (ECS) induces down-regulation of central beta-adrenoceptors. The effect of acute and chronic (10 days) treatment with ECS on salbutamol-induced suppression of exploratory activity in rats has been examined. This effect was prevented by chronic but not by acute treatment with ECS. Chronic treatment with ECS did not affect exploratory activity. The salbutamol-induced hypoactivity is mediated through central beta-adrenoceptors (antagonistic effect of (-)-propranolol but not (+)-propranolol or practolol), so the results may be regarded as functional evidence at the behavioral level for the down-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors produced by chronic treatment with ECS.", 
    "32": "This study confirms that exaprolol is a potent beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, having a pA2 value of 9.8 for the inhibition of the inotropic and chronotropic responses of guinea-pig isolated atrial preparations to isoprenaline. In the anaesthetized cat, exaprolol blocks both the myocardial stimulatory and vasodilating effects of isoprenaline, suggesting that it is a non-selective antagonist at beta-adrenoceptors. Exaprolol also has direct electrophysiological effects on cardiac (Purkinje) tissue, reducing the rate of rise of phase 0 of the action potential. This direct action together with its marked blockade of beta-adrenoceptors may explain the drug's ability to markedly suppress the ischaemic ventricular arrhythmias that follow coronary artery occlusion in anaesthetized rats.", 
    "33": "The contractile response to exogenously applied noradrenaline (NA) was examined in vitro in tubal segments (0.2-0.1 mm in diameter) of rat middle cerebral (MCA), basilar (BA) and mesenteric (MA) arteries. In the MCA, the maximum contractile response to NA (10(-4)M) was considerably smaller than that induced by K+ (124 mM) or 5-hydroxytryptamine (10(-5)M), whereas the inverse relationship was found in the MA. NA usually failed to elicit contraction in the BA even in the presence of propranolol and cocaine. In the MCA, propranolol (3 X 10(-7)M) enhanced the maximum contractile response to NA by approximately 100% without affecting the potency of the agonist. In the MA, propranolol had no effect on the concentration-response relationship for NA. Cocaine (10(-5)M) or 6-hydroxydopamine pretreatment increased the NA sensitivity of the MA by a factor of three, whereas these procedures failed to influence the NA sensitivity of the MCA. A marked stereoselectivity was found in the MCA, as (-)-NA was more than 100 times more potent than (+)-NA as a contractile agent. The order of potency of a series of alpha-adrenoreceptor agonists was (-)-adrenaline greater than oxymetazoline greater than (+/-)-NA approximately (-)-phenylephrine greater than methoxamine in the MCA and (+/-)-NA greater than (-)-phenylephrine in the MA. Clonidine failed to elicit contraction in concentrations lower than 3 X 10(-4)M in both types of artery. Prazosin was between three and four orders of magnitude more potent than rauwolscine in inhibiting NA-induced contractions in the MCA and MA. The pA2 values for, respectively, prazosin and rauwolscine were 9.3 and 5.4 in the MCA and 9.7 and 6.8 in the MA. The slope of the Schild plot deviated significantly from unity only for rauwolscine in the MA (0.64). It is concluded that the contractile response to exogenous NA in the MCA and MA is mediated mainly by stimulation of alpha 1-adrenoreceptors, although a small contribution of postjunctional alpha 2-adrenoreceptors in the MA cannot be excluded. In contrast to the MCA, the BA appears to lack contraction-mediating alpha-adrenoreceptors, indicating regional differences in the alpha-adrenoreceptor distribution in the rat cerebrovascular bed.", 
    "34": "Domes are formed in large numbers by primary cultured monolayers of type II alveolar epithelial cells from rat lungs. These fluid-filled structures are formed by active transport of solute from medium to substratum, with water following passively. In the present study, we used dome-forming monolayers to study the regulation of alveolar epithelial transport processes by determining the effects on dome formation of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) analogues, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, neurotransmitters, and vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone, ADH). The cAMP analogues (dibutyryl cAMP and 8-bromo-cAMP) and phosphodiesterase inhibitors (theophylline, papaverine, and isobutylmethylxanthine) caused large increases in dome formation by 24 h. ADH and beta-adrenergic agonists (epinephrine, terbutaline, and isoproterenol) also caused significant increases in dome density. The beta-agonist response was completely eliminated in the presence of the beta-blocker propranolol. Dibutyryl guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate and acetylcholine (cholinergic agonist) had no effect on dome formation, whereas the alpha-adrenergic agonist methoxamine caused a small but significant decrease in dome formation. These findings suggest that the active solute flux resulting in dome formation by type II alveolar epithelial cell monolayers is increased by substances expected to elevate intracellular cAMP (or analogue) concentrations. An attractive speculation having major implications for lung fluid balance is that transepithelial fluxes can be modulated by endogenous, and perhaps exogenous, chemical agents in adult mammalian alveolar epithelium in vivo.", 
    "35": "An extensive, almost overwhelming number of publications attest to the importance of beta-blockers and emphasize their role in a variety of clinical disorders. Despite uncertainty regarding the precise mechanism by which beta-adrenergic blocking drugs lower blood pressure, it is well established that these agents are fairly effective when used alone and are highly effective when combined with diuretics and/or vasodilators. Despite remarkably comparable efficacy, the available beta-blockers possess a variety of properties that may influence the frequency and type of untoward reactions. An approach to individualized choice of beta-blockers is outlined. It must be emphasized that our approach is in large part based on theoretical considerations, and further studies are needed to clearly define the relative likelihood of unwanted effects with each available agent.", 
    "36": "The effects of prenalterol, a selective beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist with potent cardiac positive inotropic properties have been investigated on regional myocardial blood flow (RMBF) (microspheres) and contractile function (ultrasonic crystals) during partial circumflex coronary artery stenosis in 8 open-chest anaesthetized dogs. Prenalterol was investigated at two intravenous doses: 5 micrograms kg-1, which increased myocardial contractility (dP/dt max: +29%) more than heart rate (+12%, up to 150 beats min-1) and 20 micrograms kg-1 which induced almost similar increases in contractility (+35%) and heart rate (+31% up to 175 beats min-1). The induced modifications of regional flow and function were then compared to those produced in another series of 6 dogs by atrial pacing at 150 and 175 beats min-1 respectively. Prenalterol significantly increased RMBF and segment length (SL)-shortening in a dose-dependent manner in the nonischaemic zone. In the ischaemic zone, RMBF was maintained and SL-shortening increased with prenalterol, 5 micrograms kg-1 whereas both RMBF and contractile function were severely decreased with prenalterol, 20 micrograms kg-1. Atrial pacing had almost no effect on RMBF and SL-shortening in the nonischaemic zone. In the ischaemic zone, atrial pacing rate-dependently decreased both RMBF and SL-shortening. Thus, a significant increase in contractility, associated with little tachycardia (prenalterol, 5 micrograms kg-1), induces beneficial effects on RMBF and function in both the nonischaemic and ischaemic myocardium. In contrast, a strong tachycardia, whether accompanied by positive inotropic effects (prenalterol, 20 gig kg-') or not (atrial pacing at 175 beats min-1) induces deleterious effects on RMBF and cardiac function in the ischaemic myocardium.", 
    "37": "Experiments on rats have demonstrated the effect of neurotransmitter function on the activity of the surfactant system and functioning area of the lung (FAL). Excess transmitters gave rise to activation of the lung surfactant system and increase in the FAL, whereas the deficiency of transmitters lowered surfactant activity and the area of the air-blood barrier.", 
    "38": "Bisoprolol is a new beta-adrenoceptor antagonist which has shown beta-adrenoceptor selectivity in studies in isolated tissues. Bronchial and cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blockade were assessed in eight normal subjects before and after oral ingestion of placebo, bisoprolol 20 and 40 mg, metoprolol 200 mg and propranolol 80 mg in random order. Bronchial beta-adrenoceptor blockade was assessed as the displacement of the bronchodilator dose-response curve to inhaled isoprenaline after each beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug compared to placebo and expressed as the dose ratio. Bronchodilatation was measured as change in specific airway conductance (sGaw) in the body plethysmograph. Cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blockade was assessed as the percentage reduction in exercise heart rate during the fifth minute of exercise at 70% of the subject's maximum work rate. Bisoprolol 20 and 40 mg caused a 24 and 25% reduction in exercise heart rate respectively, compared to 26% with metoprolol 200 mg and 20% with propranolol 80 mg. The dose ratios for the airway dose-response curves for the four beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs were 1.04 and 3.4 for bisoprolol 20 and 40 mg, 1.4 for metoprolol 200 mg and 30 for propranolol 80 mg. Both doses of bisoprolol produced considerably less bronchial beta-adrenoceptor blockade than propranolol 80 mg despite causing a greater reduction in exercise heart rate. Bisoprolol 20 mg caused a similar amount of bronchial beta-adrenoceptor blockade and a similar reduction in exercise heart rate as metoprolol 200 mg, confirming that it is cardio-selective in man.", 
    "39": "We have devised a series of visual analogue scales (VAS) to measure the side-effects prevalent amongst hypertensive patients taking beta-adrenoceptor blockers, and we present the results of a pilot study. These show that the method is suitable for studying side-effects and suggest that patients on beta-adrenoceptor blockers experience a greater incidence of tiredness of the legs, (P = 0.001), cold digits (P = 0.005) and vivid dreaming (P = 0.01) when compared to hypertensive patients not taking beta-adrenoceptor blockers.", 
    "40": "In order to study the mode of action of beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists in essential tremor the efficacy of single oral doses of 2, 4 and 10 mg LI 32-468, a peripherally acting, selective beta-2 adrenoreceptor antagonist, was compared with a single oral dose of 120 mg propranolol in a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial. Both the lowest dose of LI and propranolol were shown to be equally superior to placebo in attenuating tremor magnitude. This finding supports the contention that the beneficial effect of beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists in essential tremor is mediated via peripheral beta-2 receptor mechanisms.", 
    "41": "Postvagotomy hypergastrinemia persists in the isolated perfused rat stomach, but its cause is unknown. The possible role of cholinergic nervous pathways was investigated in the isolated vascularly perfused rat stomach after vagotomy. Atropine and hexamethonium, but not propranolol, inhibited postvagotomy hypergastrinemia. A nervous mechanism involving acetylcholine was further suggested by the inhibitory action of methionine-enkephalin on gastrin release after vagal section. Methacholine, a muscarinic receptor agonist, only weakly stimulated gastrin release from vagotomized stomachs when compared with shamoperated controls, indicating that a cholinergic drive was already in place. Immunocytochemical studies of antral tissue following vagotomy indicated that numbers of gastrin-containing cells (G-cells) were not increased after vagotomy but exhibited reduced intensity of gastrin staining when compared with control stomachs. It was concluded that basal hypergastrinemia may result from increased stimulation of a normal G-cell population by a cholinergic mechanism at the ganglionic level.", 
    "42": "Systolic time intervals (STIs) were measured in recumbency at rest and in the sitting position at rest and during exercise, before and after a physical training program, in 28 patients with coronary heart disease. Fifteen patients were treated with a beta-blocking drug and 13 were not. After training, oxygen uptake at peak exercise increased similarly in both groups, by 41% and 37%, respectively, whereas heart rate at rest and during submaximal exercise decreased in both groups. Left ventricular (LV) ejection time (ET) adjusted for heart rate was not significantly affected by training. The rate-corrected preejection period (PEP) and the PEP/LVET ratio decreased after training. The changes in the STI after training were not related to the level of physical activity during testing and were similar in the patients treated with beta-blocking drugs and in those not so treated. The changes after training in STI at rest and at exercise in both treatment groups suggest that LV function improves during the training period and that beta-blockade does not alter this outcome.", 
    "43": "A comparison was made of the clinical manifestations and diagnostic criteria of coronary artery disease in black and nonblack patients in the cohort of participants in the Beta Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT). Although diagnostic criteria were uniform for all potential participants in the trial, examination of the baseline data indicates that black patients had a higher proportion of cardiomegaly and ECGs with left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T wave changes and a lower percentage of transmural myocardial infarction in comparison to nonblack patients. Baseline data also show that blacks, in comparison to nonblacks, had a higher percentage of variables shown to be characteristic of the high-risk group, including current smoking status, rapid heart rate, angina, high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, diuretic use, and vasodilator use. The Cox regression analysis confirmed the positive association of these risk descriptors with outcome for the overall study. Walker-Duncan multivariate regression analysis ascribed significance of these risk descriptors to nonblacks only. Blacks (n = 333) had placebo and treatment mortality rates of 15.9 and 11.7, compared to 9.8 and 7.2, respectively, for the overall study (n = 3837). Thus the reduction in mortality among blacks who received propranolol after a recent myocardial infarction was shown to be comparable to that of the other high-risk groups in the BHAT.", 
    "44": "The term \"ischemic cardiomyopathy\" was used initially to describe a clinical syndrome that was indistinguishable from primary congestive cardiomyopathy but due to severe, diffuse coronary artery disease. The term has been expanded to include the larger category of myocardial disease secondary to coronary artery disease. Using this expanded definition, we have discussed the varied clinical presentations of congestive ischemic cardiomyopathy and restrictive ischemic cardiomyopathy (stiff heart syndrome and right ventricular infarction), and how the effects of ischemia on left ventricular systolic and diastolic performance may cause these varied presentations. The prognosis of any ischemic cardiomyopathy is related primarily to the degree of ventricular dysfunction and the extent of coronary artery disease. Therapy is aimed at preventing or ameliorating myocardial ischemia and halting the progression of, or even reversing, the deterioration in myocardial function.", 
    "45": "The six currently available beta-adrenergic blocking agents have significant and clinically important differences in their potency, selectivity, partial agonist effect, lipid solubility, and cost. These differences account for many of the observed variations in drug action and dosage scheduling as well as for some of the side effects. Careful choices within this group may lead to more effective treatment.", 
    "46": "Various 1-[1-[2-[3-(alkylamino)-2-hydroxypropoxy]phenyl]vinyl]-1 H-azoles were synthesized and investigated for beta-adrenoceptor-blocking and antiarrhythmic activities. Although no compounds showed more potent beta-blocking effects than propranolol in the isolated guinea pig right atria, many compounds exhibited significant antiarrhythmic effects against aconitine or ischemic arrhythmia in mice or dogs. 1-[2,5-Dichloro-6-[1-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)-ethenyl] phenoxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-propanol hydrochloride (48) (711389-S) was selected as a candidate for clinical evaluation in man, since its antiarrhythmic effects were superior to those of quinidine, disopyramide, or propranolol. Asymmetric synthesis of (R)-(+)- and (S)-(-)-48 is described, and it is proven that there is no stereospecificity in the antiarrhythmic effect of 48.", 
    "47": "We have used the inhibition of binding of a potent beta antagonist, iodohydroxybenzylpindolol, to canine lung-plasma membrane beta-adrenergic receptors as a test for beta-blocking autoantibodies in the sera of 376 mildly and severely asthmatic children. This binding inhibition assay, coupled with a variant test in which the binding assay was performed on selected sera (binding values below 2 SD from the mean) before and after immunodepletion of the sera (removal of IgG and IgA), permitted the conclusion that about 5% of the juvenile asthmatic population studied produce beta-blocking autoantibodies.", 
    "48": "Although quinidine is known to have antiadrenergic effects in the cardiovascular system, the precise mechanism by which it exerts these effects is not well defined. We asked whether quinidine binds directly to adrenergic receptors. Radioligand-binding assays were used to identify alpha 1-adrenergic receptors [( 3H]prazosin-binding sites) on membranes prepared from rat heart and kidney, alpha 2-adrenergic receptor [( 3H]yohimbine-binding sites) on human platelets and rat kidney membranes, and beta-adrenergic receptors [( 125I]iodocyanopindolol-binding sites) on rat heart and kidney membranes. Although it did not effectively compete for binding to beta-adrenergic receptors, quinidine competed for binding to alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors and yielded equilibrium dissociation constants of 0.3-3 microM. Two other antiarrhythmic agents, lidocaine and procainamide, did not compete for binding to alpha-adrenergic receptors. Further experiments demonstrated that the interactions of quinidine with the cardiac alpha 1- and platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptors were competitive and reversible. We conclude that that antiadrenergic actions of quinidine can be explained by occupancy and competitive blockade of alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "49": "The effects of adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists on the contractile activity of cervical strips from early pregnant and nonpregnant women were studied. Noradrenaline and the alpha-adrenoceptor agonist, phenylephrine, had a stimulatory effect on smooth muscle activity. This response could be blocked totally by the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, phenoxybenzamine. Isoprenaline, known to be a beta-adrenoceptor agonist with some alpha-adrenoceptor activity, had stimulatory and inhibitory effects, whereas the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, terbutaline, exhibited a pure inhibitory action. The inhibitory effects of isoprenaline and terbutaline were totally blocked by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. In pregnant patients, the sensitivity to noradrenaline was significantly higher, and the inhibitory action of terbutaline was less pronounced, which indicated the predominance of alpha-receptor activity in the uterine cervix during pregnancy.", 
    "50": "beta-Adrenergic antagonists provide moderate symptomatic relief for most hyperthyroid patients, although these agents have no direct antithyroid effects. Propranolol administration results in modest declines in serum T3 concentrations in both hyperthyroid and normal subjects and also inhibits T4 to T3 conversion in various tissue preparations in vitro. Other beta-adrenergic antagonists have not been shown to consistently alter serum T3 concentrations in vivo or T3 production in vitro. To evaluate the ability of beta-adrenergic antagonists to inhibit T4-5'-deiodination, we measured T3 production from T4 in rat liver homogenates (10,000 X g supernatant) using 1 microM T4 in the presence of varying concentrations of the beta-adrenergic antagonists available in the United States. Each drug inhibited T3 production, and the dose-dependent responses were linear and parallel when plotted as percent inhibition vs. log dose concentration. The calculated drug concentrations required to produce 50% inhibition were: propranolol, 1.7 mM; pindolol, 6.7 mM; timolol, 11.5 mM; atenolol, 23.2 mM; metoprolol, 30.5 mM, and nadolol, 106.1 mM. The IC50 values were similar in the presence of 4 mM dithiothreitol. In separate studies, the ability of D- and L-propranolol to inhibit T3 production was compared with that of D,L-propranolol, the common form. Both D- and L-propranolol were as effective as the racemic mixture. The propranolol metabolites 4-hydroxypropranolol, 4-methylpropranolol, propranolol glycol, and N-desisopropyl propranolol were also effective inhibitors. Thus, beta-adrenergic antagonists inhibit T3 production in vitro. This inhibition is not related to beta-adrenergic antagonism per se, but is correlated with the lipid solubility of the drugs, which may explain the effects of propranolol on serum T3 in vivo.", 
    "51": "The effect of lesions of the locus coeruleus (LC) and drugs either blocking or stimulating noradrenergic (NE) receptors on dominance behavior in Wistar rats was studied. Rats with destroyed LC displayed submissive behavior when paired with sham-operated animals. Treatment of dominant animals with clonidine, prazosin and propranolol markedly reduced dominance whilst treatment of submissive rats with either yohimbine or salbutamol transformed the submissive (subordinate) animal to dominant type. The role of brain NE neurons in dominant behavior in water-competition paradigm is discussed.", 
    "52": "The effects of short term (1 h) as well as prolonged (16 h) activation of beta-adrenoceptors by isoprenaline on the functioning of the beta-adrenoceptor linked adenylate cyclase system of rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells in the contractile phenotype in primary culture was examined. Smooth muscle cells responded to 50 mumol/l isoprenaline with a rapid increase in intracellular cAMP. Continued exposure of these cells to this concentration of isoprenaline results in a rapid time dependent reduction in maximum beta-adrenoceptor responsiveness. In vitro analyses of adenylate cyclase activities, phosphodiesterase activity and 125I-iodocyanopindolol specific (beta-adrenoceptor) binding sites suggest that the decrease in the cells' ability to increase intracellular cAMP may be due to a reduction in beta-adrenoceptor binding sites. The loss in cell receptor responsiveness and membrane receptor concentration was only very slowly reversible. These results suggest that following prolonged exposure of vascular smooth muscle cells to beta-adrenoceptor agonists, beta-adrenoceptors are rapidly internalized and degraded. This mechanism may account for the haemodynamic tolerance observed to chronic therapy with beta-adrenoceptor agonists.", 
    "53": "The administration of a stable adenosine analogue, L-N6-phenylisopropyladenosine (L-PIA, 0.3 mg/kg i. p.), caused a decrease in the accumulation of L-DOPA in the rat hippocampus after blockade of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase by NSD 1015 (150 mg/kg). Conversely, the adenosine receptor antagonist theophylline (15 mg/kg) increased the L-DOPA accumulation. In slices from rat hippocampus L-PIA causes an inhibition of the stimulation-evoked release of [3H]-noradrenaline (NA). The magnitude of this effect was enhanced after 1 week treatment with theophylline (15 mg/kg/day). The number of beta-adrenoceptors in the rat hippocampus, measured by binding of [3H]-dihydroalprenolol was significantly reduced after theophylline treatment, and tended to be higher after L-PIA treatment. The results show that activation of adenosine receptors in vivo causes a decreased synthesis of NA in the rat hippocampus. The reason may be a reduced firing-rate of the NA-neurons. Theophylline, by contrast, enhanced the synthesis, possibly indicating a role for endogenous adenosine in the regulation of NA-turnover. Long-term treatment with these drugs caused adaptive changes in the presynaptic adenosine receptor activity and in the number of beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "54": "The interactions between prostacyclin (PGI2) and adrenergic, opiate, purinergic receptor agonists and antagonists were studied in isolated segments of guinea-pig ileum by recording the changes in isometric tension. The contractile response of these preparations to PGI2 was rapid and qualitatively similar to the effect of acetylcholine. Noradrenaline (30-300 nM) reduced the effect of PGI2 (20 nM) in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibitory action of noradrenaline on PGI2-induced contractions was prevented by the alpha-blocker phentolamine and unaffected by the beta-blocker D(--)INPEA. Morphine (10,50 nM) antagonized the response of the ileum to PGI2 and naloxone prevented this inhibition. Also N6-phenylisopropyladenosine (PIA) (10,50 nM) inhibited the effect of PGI2, which was restored when theophylline was added before PIA. The present results indicate that presynaptic alpha-adrenergic, opiate and purinergic receptor stimulation operates a negative control on the effect of PGI2 in guinea-pig ileum.", 
    "55": "The administration of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP, 100 mg/kg, i.p.) consistently increased hypothalamic cyclic AMP levels in rats treated 10 days earlier with the serotonin neurotoxin, 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT), to produce 5-HT receptor supersensitivity. However 5-HTP (100 mg/kg), failed to cause an increase in hypothalamic cyclic AMP in rats not pretreated with 5,7-DHT. The 5-HTP-induced increase in cyclic AMP was blocked by the decarboxylase inhibitor, benserazide (RO 4-4602, 800 mg/kg) and by the 5-HT antagonist metergoline (5 mg/kg). Other treatments that caused a significant elevation of hypothalamic cyclic AMP included: (a) L-Tryptophan plus the monoamine oxidase inhibitor, tranylcypromine, and (b) the serotonin agonist, 1-(m-trifluromethylphenyl)-1-piperazine. The 5-HT antagonist, methysergide, blocked the serotonin receptor mediated behavioral syndrome, but failed to prevent the increase in hypothalamic cyclic AMP. Moreover, the 5-HT agonist, 5-methoxy-N, N-dimethyltryptamine, (5-Me-DMT), induced a strong behavioral syndrome but failed to significantly increase hypothalamic cyclic AMP. These findings suggest that activation of 5-HT receptors somewhere in the brain causes an increase in hypothalamic cyclic AMP, but further studies will be needed to determine whether this is a direct result of activation of the 5-HT receptors in the hypothalamus.", 
    "56": "beta-Adrenoceptors of lung (75% beta 2) and heart (95% beta 1) of calf were labelled with 3H-(-)-propranolol. The stereoisomers of 10 ligands were used to inhibit the binding of 3H-(-)-propranolol to membrane particles. The affinity ratio of stereoisomers is consistently greater for beta 1-adrenoceptors than for beta 2-adrenoceptors, regardless of whether the ligands are agonists, partial agonists or antagonists. The beta 1-adrenoceptor appears to possess stricter steric requirements than the beta 2-adrenoceptor. This property may prove helpful in differentiating the beta-adrenoceptor subtypes during receptor solubilization and purification.", 
    "57": "The blocking and stimulant potencies of (-)-pindolol and (+)-pindolol were estimated on right atria and tracheae of guinea pig. Blocking affinities were estimated for beta-adrenoceptor subtypes by using several agonists. Binding affinities of (-)-pindolol and (+)-pindolol were also estimated for beta-adrenoceptors labelled with 3H-(-)-bupranolol in membranes of ventricular myocardium and lung of guinea pig. Both (-)-pindolol and (+)-pindolol caused tracheal relaxation with intrinsic activities of 0.3. The concentration-effect curve for (-)-pindolol exhibits a high-sensitivity and a low-sensitivity relaxant component; the curve for (+)-pindolol was nearly monophasic. The EC50's were (-log mol/l) 9.2 and 6.1 for (-)-pindolol and 7.6 for (+)-pindolol. Using subtype-selective blockers it was found that the relaxant effects of (+)-pindolol and those of the high-sensitivity component of (-)-pindolol are mediated through beta 2-adrenoceptors. The low-sensitivity component of relaxation of (-)-pindolol was antagonized by beta-blockers less than expected from their affinities for beta-adrenoceptors. Both (-)-pindolol and (+)-pindolol caused an increase of atrial beating rate with an intrinsic activity of 0.2. The concentration-effect curve of (-)-pindolol was biphasic; the curve of (+)-pindolol was monophasic. The EC50's were (-log mol/l) 9.1 and 7.0 for (-)-pindolol and 7.5 for (+)-pindolol. From the use of subtype-selective antagonists we conclude that the positive chronotropic effects of (+)-pindolol are mediated predominantly by beta 2-adrenoceptors. On the other hand, the high-sensitivity component of the positive chronotropic effects of (-)-pindolol appears to be mediated predominantly through beta 1-adrenoceptors, although beta 2-adrenoceptors may also participate. The low-sensitivity component of the positive chronotropic effects of (-)-pindolol is resistant to blockade by subtype-selective antagonists at concentrations causing at least 98% beta-adrenoceptor occupancy. Only high but non-depressant concentrations of non-selective (-)-bupranolol antagonized the low-sensitivity component of (-)-pindolol. (-)-Pindolol antagonized the effects of several agonists to similar extent in both trachea and right atrium. (+)-Pindolol was less potent as antagonist of the relaxant effects of (-)-noradrenaline on trachea than against those of (-)-adrenaline, (-)-isoprenaline and (+/-)-salbutamol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "58": "This study examined the effects of diet and treatment with noradrenergic receptor antagonists on weight gain and indices of Na+-K+-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity in the rat. When rats were fed a palatable cafeteria diet, their caloric consumption increased by about 80%, but they did not gain weight significantly. Ouabain binding and K+-p-nitrophenylphosphatase (NPPase) activity were increased in brown adipose tissue and soleus. These indices remained elevated after the rats were returned to a regular diet. When rats were fasted for 3 days, they lost weight, and the indices of Na+-K+-ATPase activity were markedly reduced in brown adipose tissue and soleus. After refeeding the fasted rats gained weight three times more rapidly than nonfasted rats with similar food intake. Indices of Na+-K+-ATPase activity remained as low as they had been when the rats were fasting. There was a consistent negative correlation between weight gain per calorie eaten and brown adipose tissue NPPase activity. Changes in Na+-K+-ATPase could therefore be involved in the effects of overfeeding and fasting on metabolic efficiency. Desmethylimipramine binding was increased by cafeteria diet and decreased by fasting, consistent with changes in sympathetic nervous system activity. Treatment with prazosin, an alpha 1-noradrenergic receptor antagonist, reduced Na+-K+-ATPase in either control or cafeteria diet-fed rats but did not alter the effect of cafeteria diet feeding. By contrast, treatment with propranolol, a beta-receptor antagonist, prevented the increase in Na+-K+-ATPase during cafeteria diet feeding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "59": "The precise importance of prostaglandin (PG) in the beta-adrenergic pathway to renin release is unresolved. Thus, we examined this question using renal cortical slices from Sprague-Dawley rats incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate mixture (KRB), KRB + isoproterenol (10(-5) M, ISO), or a solution containing KRB + ISO + either propranolol (PRO, 10(-5) M) or indomethacin (IN, 10(-5) M). Media samples were assayed for renin activity, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (the stable metabolite of PGI2), and PGE2. ISO only increased renin release 1.96-fold; modest increments in 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and PGE2 also occurred. The addition of PRO prevented these increases. In the next series of studies, ISO again increased renin, but the addition of IN failed to modify this increase in renin release. However, IN did prevent any increase in 6-keto-PGF1 alpha or PGE2. Meclofenemate (10(-5) M) provided results similar to those of IN. PGI2 was found to stimulate the release of renin in concentrations of 10(-7) M. The combination of submaximal stimulatory concentrations of PGI2 (10(-6) M, a 1.6-fold increment) and ISO (10(-6) M, a 1.7-fold increment) produced a synergistic increase in renin release (2.84-fold). These results demonstrate that renal prostaglandins do not function as essential mediators of the beta-adrenergic pathway to renin release. Rather, high concentrations of prostaglandins may increase the renin-releasing action of beta-agonists, thereby modulating the release of renin.", 
    "60": "Sixteen male subjects (20-31 yr) trained for 8 wk on cycle ergometers. Eight of the subjects were treated during the training period with the beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol (160 mg/day). During all pre-and posttraining tests, subjects were uninfluenced by the medication. Training-induced increases in VO2max and decreases in blood lactate and norepinephrine concentrations at submaximal exercise were not different between the beta-blockade and the placebo groups. The activities of the mitochondrial enzymes citrate synthase (CS), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), cytochrome c oxidase (Cyt-c-ox), and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HAD) in the quadriceps femoris muscle increased significantly (P less than 0.01) with training (beta-blockade group, +47, +33, +38, and 22%; placebo group, +75, 70, +87, and +63%, respectively). Cyt-c-ox and HAD increased significantly more in the placebo group than in the beta-blockade group, while a tendency to an increase was noted for SDH. Muscle capillary density increased similarly (+17-19%) with training in the two groups (P less than 0.01). In conclusion, subjects training under the influence of a therapeutic level of beta-adrenergic blockade show marked increases in both the respiratory capacity and the capillary supply of the engaged skeletal muscles. However, the increase in muscle mitochondrial enzymes may be less apparent than in the normal state.", 
    "61": "Young turkeys inbred for congestive cardiomyopathy (CCM) were treated with propranolol prior to the development of cardiac enlargement. One-day-old inbred CCM and commercial turkeys received 2 mg X kg-1 X day-1 of propranolol for 1 month and were compared with untreated age matched inbred CCM and commercial turkeys. Heart weight, body weight, and binding characteristics of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors, using (-)3H-dihydroalprenolol as a ligand, were determined at 10 and 28 days. Left ventricular shortening fraction was determined at 28 days and at 32 days, 4 days after propranolol was discontinued, in treated and untreated inbred CCM and commercial turkeys. Propranolol did not prevent the development of cardiac hypertrophy in inbred CCM turkeys at 28 days of age and did not effect body weight or heart weight in either inbred CCM or commercial turkeys at 10 or 28 days of age. In the inbred CCM turkeys, the maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) and the binding affinity (Kd) of beta-adrenergic receptors were not changed by propranolol treatment. In the propranolol-treated commercial turkeys, Bmax the of beta-receptors was increased at 28 days of age compared with untreated age matched controls, 382 vs 194 fmol X mg-1 (p less than 0.05). Untreated inbred CCM turkeys when compared with untreated age matched commercial turkeys show a significant reduction of binding affinity of beta-receptors at both 10 and 28 days of age, Kd = 10.4 vs 6.2 nmol X litre-1 at 10 days and 11.3 vs 5.2 nmol X litre-1 at 28 days (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "62": "Handled female Wistar rats were exposed to one of the following stress stimuli: restraint, electric foot shocks, passive avoidance situation, ether, or nembutal anesthesia followed by ip formalin or laparotomy. Trunk blood was collected 2-4 min after initiation of the stress stimulus for the determination of immunoreactive beta-endorphin (beta-ENDi), ACTH (ACTHi), and alpha-MSH (alpha-MSHi). All stressors evoked a rapid increase of circulating beta-ENDi to 0.75-2.10 ng/ml. All except passive avoidance situation also induced a rapid increase of plasma ACTHi to 0.45-0.70 ng/ml, whereas plasma alpha-MSHi increased after ether and restraint to 0.18-0.40 ng/ml but was not affected by formalin stress. To study the involvement of a beta-adrenoceptor mechanism in stress-induced peptide secretion, rats were treated with D-propranolol or L-propranolol 40 min before stress exposure. Propranolol did not prevent the increase of plasma ACTHi to any of the stressors studied. L-Propranolol but not its inactive D-isomer reduced (restraint, passive avoidance) or abolished (electric foot shocks) the increase in plasma beta-ENDi but did not affect the beta-ENDi response to other stressors (ether, formalin, laparotomy). Similarly, L-propranolol attenuated the alpha-MSHi response to restraint but not to ether stress. To discriminate between corticotroph or melanotroph origin of beta-ENDi released during stress, rats were treated with dexamethasone or were subjected to neurointermediate lobectomy (4 weeks). Neurointermediate lobectomy did not affect basal or stress-induced plasma ACTHi but resulted in undetectable alpha-MSHi levels. It largely prevented the beta-ENDi response to restraint stress (propranolol sensitive) but had little effect on the beta-ENDi response to formalin stress (propranolol insensitive). Conversely, dexamethasone prevented stress-induced ACTHi response without affecting plasma alpha-MSHi. The beta-ENDi response to restraint stress (propranolol sensitive) was not changed but the response to formalin stress (propranolol insensitive) was largely prevented by dexamethasone. These results show that the intermediate lobe is the main source of beta-ENDi secreted during exposure to stressors with a high emotional impact. Since intermediate lobe peptide secretion induced by such stimuli can be prevented by beta-adrenoceptor blockade, we speculate that stress-induced discharge of catecholamines, possibly from the adrenal medulla, is the trigger signal for peptide secretion from the melanotrophs during this type of stress.", 
    "63": "In a double-blind, randomized crossover study, the daily administration of 30 to 90 mg of nifedipine lowered blood pressure in a dose-related fashion in 14 patients already taking a beta receptor blocker and diuretic. The duration of the hypotensive response to 20 mg of nifedipine in capsule form, giving as a \"step-three\" drug to five of these patients, was six to eight hours. A survey of 122 patients with resistant hypertension treated long-term with nifedipine and a control group of 102 similar patients treated with hydralazine revealed that nifedipine at an average dose of 40 mg daily caused a fall in blood pressure similar to that achieved with hydralazine in a dose of 86 mg daily. The side effect profile of both drugs was also similar. Nifedipine may be a useful alternative to existing step-three antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "64": "A wide variety of drug treatments are available for the management of hypertension. Often, effective therapy is found only through a process of elimination. A more pathophysiologically oriented method of choosing therapy is based on classification of patients into those with low-, normal-, and high-renin hypertension. In the past, for example, diuretics were considered to be the most effective agents for the treatment of low-renin hypertension. Most cases of essential hypertension are characterized by increased vascular resistance. Calcium channel influx is a major determinant of the free intracellular calcium concentration that finally triggers the contractile process of the vascular smooth muscle cell and thereby determines arterial resistance. In man, free calcium concentration in platelets is closely related to the height of systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Vasodilatation produced by the intra-arterial infusion of a calcium channel blocker into the forearm circulation is significantly greater in hypertensive patients than in normotensive subjects, threefold that observed with sodium nitroprusside, and fourfold that found with prazosin. In hypertensive patients, these effects are correlated directly with plasma epinephrine--reflecting sympathoadrenal activity--and inversely with the activity and reactivity of the renin-angiotensin system. In several clinical studies, the decrease in blood pressure following the administration of calcium channel entry blockers was directly correlated to the patient's age and pretreatment blood pressure, and indirectly to the pretreatment plasma renin activity. The effects of these agents are apparently also comparable to the over-all responses achievable with beta blockers and diuretics. In the future, calcium entry blockers may replace diuretics as first-line therapy for older patients and those with low-renin hypertension.", 
    "65": "Management of patients with concomitant hypertension and angina pectoris mandates that the physician pay attention to the underlying pathophysiology. The heart, when exposed to years of hypertension, becomes \"remodeled.\" Overall mass is enlarged, the walls are thickened, and initial cavity volume remains normal or relatively small. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure rises in the setting of a hypertrophic noncompliant ventricle; coronary resistance and coronary perfusion pressure are increased; and coronary vascular reserve, even with widely patent coronary arteries, is decreased. Long-standing hypertension--a risk factor for coronary atherosclerosis--is often accompanied by epicardial coronary stenoses that aggravate these coronary abnormalities. In managing the patient with hypertension and angina pectoris, it is important to determine whether the angina occurs in the setting of hypertensive hypertrophic disease alone or coexists with coronary arterial stenoses. Also important to therapy is whether the ventricle is of normal size with good function or decompensated with dilatation and diminished function. The latter two anatomic considerations, namely, epicardial coronary patency and left ventricular cavity size, will influence the choice of an anti-ischemic regimen. For example, diuretic and nitrate therapy can be hazardous, and digitalis unnecessary, in the setting of a nondilated hypertrophic ventricle with hyperdynamic function. On the other hand, the combined use of beta blocking agents plus calcium antagonists is particularly effective in lowering blood pressure and in improving coronary blood flow. Finally, this combination has been shown to be rapidly effective and to have prolonged benefit in this setting. The choice of these latter agents is also affected by the underlying state of the ventricle. Calcium channel blocking agents without significant negative inotropic effect, such as nifedipine and nitrendipine, would be suitable in patients with decompensated ventricular function and dilated left ventricular cavities. Both of these drugs have been shown to increase cardiac output and contractility via a reflex effect and to have little or no direct negative inotropic effect. In contrast, verapamil has a direct negative inotropic effect. The final choice of agents must be tailored to the needs of the individual patient, and the physician also has to determine the role of specific agents in the natural history of hypertensive heart disease.", 
    "66": "Changes due to aging of the cardiovascular system play an important role in the development of hypertension and its complications in the elderly. As shown in recent experimental studies in rats, the arterial changes that normally take place resemble those resulting from hypertension. They may be preventable by maintenance of low blood pressures and may be secondary to prolonged hemodynamic effects on the artery wall. The major hemodynamic consequences of aging in man include an increase in total peripheral vascular resistance, which occurs as a result of both arterial and arteriolar disease. Other features with potentially important therapeutic implications in the elderly include an increased tendency for left ventricular dysfunction and cardiac arrhythmias, decreased baroreceptor sensitivity, and atherosclerosis-induced reduction of blood flow to vital organs. Older patients also tend to have a reduced fluid volume and an abnormal distribution and metabolism of drugs. These factors lead to greater sensitivity to potential side effects and, thus, greater difficulty in managing their hypertension. Diuretics, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers appear to be the most useful initial antihypertensive drugs in the elderly. The cardioprotective effects of beta blockers and the desirable hemodynamic action of calcium antagonists provide compelling justification for their use in many patients. Centrally acting sympatholytic drugs such as methyldopa, clonidine, and guanabenz are useful as second-step agents, usually in combination with a diuretic. In the presence of moderate to severe diastolic hypertension, hydralazine, captopril, and minoxidil may have value, but such potent agents should generally be avoided with isolated systolic hypertension. In elderly hypertensive patients with other complicating diseases, sufficient alternative treatment options are now available to allow tailoring of therapy to the special needs of each patient, thereby minimizing adverse reactions to therapy. However, relatively low doses of medications and conservative therapeutic objectives are usually necessary, particularly in patients with isolated systolic hypertension in whom the benefits of treatment are still to be determined.", 
    "67": "Psychosocial interviews with 2320 male survivors of acute myocardial infarction, participants in the beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial, permitted the definition of two variables strongly associated with an increased three-year mortality risk. With other important prognostic factors controlled for, the patients classified as being socially isolated and having a high degree of life stress had more than four times the risk of death of the men with low levels of both stress and isolation. An inverse association of education with mortality in this population reflected the gradient in the prevalence of the defined psychosocial characteristics. High levels of stress and social isolation were most prevalent among the least-educated men and least prevalent among the best-educated. The increase in risk associated with stress and social isolation applied both to total deaths and to sudden cardiac deaths and was noted among men with both high and low levels of ventricular ectopy during hospitalization for the acute infarction.", 
    "68": "Coronary heart disease mortality in New Zealand has declined by 20% in the 13 years since 1968. One possible explanation for this decline is lower case-fatality rates resulting from improvements in the management of myocardial infarction. This paper tests this hypothesis by examining trends in 1-year survival following a definite myocardial infarction for the population aged 35-69 in Auckland. The data were obtained from two methodologically identical population-based registers of myocardial infarction compiled in 1974 and 1981 in Auckland. In both periods the 1-year crude case-fatality rate was 30% and the pattern of survival over 1 year was similar. These data suggest that factors other than the improved care of myocardial infarction patients are responsible for the decline in coronary heart disease mortality rates in New Zealand.", 
    "69": "Increased supply of tryptophan to the liver, resulting from the lipolytic action of ethanol, is suggested to be responsible for the increased activity of liver tryptophan oxygenase after ingestion of a single large dose of ethanol. This hypothesis was tested using an antilipolytic drug, propranolol, prior to ethanol treatment. It was found that, while propranolol did inhibit the ethanol-induced increase in blood unesterified fatty acids and free tryptophan concentrations, it did not prevent the activation of tryptophan oxygenase by ethanol. In another experiment, where cycloheximide was used to block protein synthesis, it was found that increased protein synthesis rather than decreased protein degradation is probably responsible for the accumulation of liver tryptophan oxygenase after ethanol ingestion.", 
    "70": "Renin profiling stimulated research into the pathophysiology of essential hypertension and influenced the development of antihypertensive treatment strategies. Patients with a high renin value and usually younger age respond better to drugs that interfere with the renin-angiotensin system, that is, beta blockers or converting enzyme inhibitors. Patients with a low renin value and often older age respond better to calcium entry blockers or diuretics. Patients with normal renin levels exhibit mixed but, on average, equal responses to these types of drugs. A pathophysiology-oriented antihypertensive treatment strategy is proposed in which beta blockers or converting enzyme inhibitors are used as one and calcium entry blockers--in the place of diuretics when possible--as the other baseline drug, and this approach may provide a cardiac-protective effect.", 
    "71": "A saturable, stereospecific high affinity beta 2 adrenergic receptor was demonstrated on intact human peripheral blood lymphocytes using the ligand [125I]-iodocyanopindolol ([125I]ICYP). A method is described for parallel measurements of saturation binding isotherms and isoproterenol-cAMP responsiveness in split samples of intact lymphocytes isolated from 40 ml. of whole blood. A significant positive correlation between beta receptor density (Bmax) and the ratio of maximal isoproterenol-generated cAMP to basal levels was found in healthy subjects (r = 0.65, p less than 0.001). A significant positive correlation was found between age and the fold increase over basal cAMP levels induced by isoproterenol. Older females had a significantly higher fold increase in cAMP levels after isoproterenol than older males. These effects were largely accounted for by the lower basal levels of cAMP in older subjects. Beta receptor binding indices (Bmax and KD) did not differ between males and females, or change with aging. The effects of age and sex upon cAMP levels appear to be at least partly mediated by mechanisms independent of the beta receptor. The method, which describes a convenient assay for parallel measurement of beta receptor binding and cAMP levels in small blood samples, represents a useful model for studying human beta receptor function.", 
    "72": "The effects of altered thyroid function on the sensitivity of isoproterenol induced secretion of saliva and in the characteristics of adrenergic receptors from the rat submandibular gland were examined. Hyperthyroidism produced an increased sensitivity to beta-adrenergic stimulation of the gland, and this phenomenon was associated with an increase in the number of beta and alpha 1-adrenoceptors. On the other hand, surgical thyroidectomy produced a decrease sensitivity to isoproterenol stimulation of the submandibular gland and a diminished density of beta-adrenoceptors. In this case, no changes in alpha-adrenoceptors were observed. These results are discussed emphasizing the correlation between the functional control of saliva secretion and the adrenergic receptors in different thyroid states.", 
    "73": "Overall, the worldwide experience on enalapril to date is very encouraging. The drug produces good to excellent responses in 54 to 66 percent of patients with essential hypertension and is at least as effective as either diuretics or beta blockers. The effects of enalapril compared with those of diuretics confirm that patients more dependent upon the renin-angiotensin system respond better. When hydrochlorothiazide is administered concomitantly with enalapril, almost all patients respond, with good long-term maintenance. In patients with severe hypertension, Blocadren or Aldomet may be added in addition to hydrochlorothiazide and will produce additional benefit. Enalapril attenuates the adverse metabolic effects of hydrochlorothiazide, particularly hypokalemia. Overall, although the efficacy of enalapril and that of captopril are similar, enalapril is better tolerated and does not appear to be associated with any significant occurrence of captopril-type side effects, particularly the skin rash and loss of taste. As expected, enalapril and other converting inhibitors may be associated with azotemia in patients with bilateral renovascular hypertension.", 
    "74": "Ninety four patients with mild hypertension (average supine diastolic blood pressure (phase V) 95-110 mm Hg) were allocated at random to receive restriction of dietary sodium (maximum allowed 70 mmol(mEq)/24 h) or a normal diet. In addition, they received in random order 25 mg chlorthalidone, 200 mg metoprolol (slow release), and a fixed combination of these two drugs. Each drug treatment was given for four weeks and alternated with four weeks of placebo. Forty four patients were allocated to sodium restriction (group 1) and 50 to normal diet (group 2). The mean 24 hour urinary sodium excretion in group 1 was 74 (SD 31) mmol(mEq)/24 h, and in group 2 132 (51) mmol/24 h. Compared with the screening blood pressure the average decrement of the supine blood pressure in group 1 was 16.0/8.6 mm Hg with placebo, 21.7/11.5 mm Hg with the diuretic, 28.5/17.8 mm Hg with the beta blocker, and 28.9/18.4 mm Hg with the combined agent; in group 2 these values were 13.3/6.1, 20.3/9.7, 21.3/12.9, and 29.4/16.8 mm Hg, respectively. There was a sharp decrease of the average potassium concentration during chlorthalidone and combination treatment periods (average value 3.3 mmol(mEq)/1). These results suggest that moderate salt restriction used as sole treatment has a limited though demonstrable blood pressure lowering effect but that when it is used as an adjuvant to beta blocker treatment its value is greatly enhanced.", 
    "75": "Acute bilateral adrenal demedullation significantly reduced pressor responses in pithed spontaneously hypertensive rats. The subsequent infusion of adrenaline (50 ng/min i.v.) significantly enhanced neurogenic pressor responses without affecting those induced by noradrenaline. The adrenaline-induced enhancement of neurogenic pressor responses was unaffected by pretreatment with the beta 1-selective adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol (0.3 mg/kg i.v.), but was completely abolished by pretreatment with the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118551 (0.01 mg/kg i.v.). Pressor responses to noradrenaline remained unaltered.", 
    "76": "The present experiment was undertaken to determine the existence of alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors in the smooth muscle of the rabbit bladder dome, trigone and proximal urethra. In the dome pretreated with propranolol (10(-6) M), phenylephrine (10(-5) M-10(-3) M) and norepinephrine (10(-7) M-10(-5) M) caused only a small contraction but norepinephrine, only at high concentrations (10(-4) M-10(-3) M), produced a small relaxation. Clonidine, however, had no effect on the dome. In both trigone and urethra, phenylephrine, clonidine and norepinephrine caused dose-dependent contractions. The contractile response to phenylephrine or norepinephrine was significantly greater than that to clonidine in the trigone but no such difference was observed in the urethra. Prazosin (10(-8) M-10(-6) M, alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist) produced a rightward shift of the phenylephrine and clonidine dose-response curve in both the trigone and urethra. Yohimbine (10(-8) M-10(-6) M, alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist) inhibited the response to clonidine without significantly affecting the responses to phenylephrine. These studies indicated that alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors are present in both the trigone and proximal urethra. In the dome, only alpha 1-adrenoceptors are sparsely distributed."
