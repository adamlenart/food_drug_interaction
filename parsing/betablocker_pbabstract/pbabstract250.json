    "0": "The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV) in risk prediction after acute myocardial infarction (MI) and to evaluate the effect of beta-blocker treatment on the prognostic performance of heart rate and HRV.", 
    "1": "Three hundred sixty-six patients underwent 24-hour Holter recording 1 to 6 days after an MI. HRV was expressed as the standard deviation of all normal-to-normal intervals. Left ventricular systolic function was evaluated using the wall motion index. Half of the patients were taking a beta-blocker at the time of Holter recording. Mean follow-up was 44 months (median 34) after MI. By the end of follow-up, 82 patients had died. Mortality at 1 and 3 years was 12.5% and 22.6%, respectively. HRV, heart rate, wall motion index, number of ventricular premature beats per hour, and ventricular tachycardia were all significantly (P < 0.05) associated with mortality in univariate analysis, independent of beta-blocker therapy. In multivariate Cox analysis, only heart rate, wall motion index, number of ventricular premature beats per hour, and age had independent prognostic value (P < 0.001). In any model, including heart rate, HRV had no predictive value.", 
    "2": "The prognostic information of HRV is contained completely in heart rate, which carries prognostic information further than that of HRV. This result was independent of beta-blocker treatment.", 
    "3": "The cardioprotective effects of betaxolol were studied in a rat model with heart failure induced by autoimmune myocarditis. Twenty-eight days after immunization, Lewis rats were divided into four groups; 0.1 mg/kg betaxolol per day (group 0.1), 1.0 mg/kg betaxolol per day (group 1), 10 mg/kg betaxolol per day (group 10), and vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose, group V) (all groups, n = 13). After oral administration for 1 month, the heart weight, the mRNA expression of atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide in the left ventricle, the plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration, the mean blood pressure, the heart rate, the central venous pressure, the peak left ventricular pressure, the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and its first derivative +/-dP/dt, and the area of myocardial fibrosis were measured. Betaxolol reduced the heart rate, the levels of atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide mRNA expression and the atrial natriuretic peptide concentration [group N (normal rats), 367 +/- 4 beats/min, 100%, 100% and 78 +/- 7 pg/ml, respectively; group V, 391 +/- 9 beats/min, 761 +/- 68% versus group N, 317 +/- 42% versus group N and 4374 +/- 312 pg/ml, respectively; group 0.1, 387 +/- 10 beats/min, 621 +/- 78%, 288 +/- 41% and 2875 +/- 331 pg/ml, respectively; group 1, 323 +/- 9 beats/min, 442 +/- 84%, 148 +/- 12% and 884 +/- 51 pg/ml, respectively; and group 10, 312 +/- 8 beats/min, 97 +/- 18%, 92 + 9% and 453 +/- 53 pg/ml, respectively], and increased survival (group V, 62%; group 0.1, 69%; groups N, 1 and 10, 100%). Betaxolol did not significantly alter the heart weight, the hemodynamic parameters or the area of fibrosis. These observations suggest that betaxolol may improve the survival rate by reducing sudden death and changing the atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide mRNA expression in patients with heart failure.", 
    "4": "The purpose of the present study was to administer an acute dose of the dual dopamine norepinephrine reuptake blocker bupropion in freely moving rats and to monitor the extracellular neurotransmitter concentrations in the hippocampus via in vivo microdialysis and the peripheral hormonal concentrations via catheterization. A microdialysis probe was inserted in the hippocampus, and samples for serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine were collected every 20 min before and after the injection of 17 mg/kg of bupropion, for a total sampling time of 180 min. A catheter was placed in the vena femoralis of the second group of rats, and blood samples were collected before and after bupropion injection for quantification of growth hormone, prolactin, corticosterone, adrenocorticotropin hormone, and beta-endorphins. All neurotransmitter levels (dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin) significantly increased after bupropion injection. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in prolactin concentrations, whereas the other hormones showed no statistically significant variation. It can, therefore, be concluded that, although bupropion has dual reuptake proprieties, the observed effects both at the central and at the peripheral level seem to be ruled by the dopaminergic system.", 
    "5": "Nebivolol, in contrast to other selective beta1-adrenergic receptor antagonists like atenolol, improves endothelial function in patients with oxidative stress within vascular tissue. With the present studies we sought to determine whether beta receptor blockade with nebivolol may improve endothelial function in hyperlipidemia and whether this is attributable to reductions in vascular oxidative stress.", 
    "6": "Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits (WHHL) were treated with nebivolol (10 mg/kg per day for 8 weeks). New Zealand white rabbits (NZWR) served as controls. Nebivolol improved endothelial function, reduced vascular superoxide and vascular macrophage infiltration, and prevented NO synthase uncoupling in WHHL. Nebivolol treatment did not modify the expression of sGC or cGK-I but improved cGK-I activity (assessed by the phosphorylation state of the VAsodilator Stimulated Phosphoprotein at serine239, P-VASP). NAD(P)H oxidase activity in whole blood and isolated neutrophils was dose-dependently inhibited by nebivolol, whereas atenolol, metoprolol, and carvedilol were markedly less effective.", 
    "7": "Nebivolol therapy effectively prevents NO synthase III uncoupling and prevents activation of the neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase and infiltration of inflammatory cells. These novel antioxidative stress actions of this compound may explain partly the beneficial effects on endothelial function in patients with enhanced vascular oxidative stress.",

Little is known about the influence of different therapies for cardiac failure on the remodelling seen in infants with congenital cardiac disease.", 
    "10": "During follow-up of a prospective and randomized trial, we investigated therapeutic effects on neurohormonal activation, ventricular function, and myocardial gene expression. We compared the data from 8 infants with severe congestive heart failure due to left-to-right shunts, who received digoxin and diuretics alone, to 9 infants who received additional treatment with propranolol.", 
    "11": "In these infants, beta-adrenergic blockade significantly reduced highly elevated levels of renin, from 284 +/- 319 microU/ml compared to 1061 +/- 769 microU/ml. Systolic ventricular function was normal in both groups, but diastolic ventricular function was improved in those receiving propranolol, indicated by significantly lower left atrial pressures, lower end-diastolic pressures, and less pronounced ventricular hypertrophy, the latter estimated by lower ratios of myocardial wall to ventricular cavity areas on average of 42%. Further hemodynamic parameters showed no significant differences between the groups, except for the lower heart rate in infants treated with propranolol. In those treated with digoxin and diuretics, there was a significant downregulation of beta2-receptor and angiotensin-2 receptor genes, and up-regulation of endothelin A receptor and connective tissue growth factor genes, that were partially prevented by additional treatment with propranolol.",

Incidence is high in Asian people and rarely reported in caucasian people. We describe the case of a young caucasian male, with a TPP. Clinical symptoms of hypokaliemia are strong, when thyrotoxicosis symptoms appear only on blood tests. The clinical course is good with beta-blockers and antithyroid treatment. These treatments induce a total clinical and biological cure. In all the cases of hypokaliemic paralysis, even without symptom, an hyperthyro\u00efdia must be searched for.", 
    "14": "Zn(2+) (1-1,000 microM) applied to the apical side of polarized A6 epithelia inhibits Na(+) transport, as reflected in short-circuit current and conductance measurements. The Menten equilibrium constant for Zn(2+) inhibition was 45 microM. Varying the apical Na(+) concentration, we determined the equilibrium constant of the short-circuit current saturation (34.9 mM) and showed that Zn(2+) inhibition is non-competitive. A similar effect was observed in Xenopus oocytes expressing alphabetagammarENaC (alpha-, beta-, and gamma-subunits of the rat epithelial Na(+) channel) in the concentration range of 1-10 microM Zn(2+), while at 100 microM Zn(2+) exerted a stimulatory effect. The analysis of the voltage dependence of the steady-state conductance revealed that the inhibitory effect of Zn(2+) was due mainly to a direct pore block and not to a change in surface potential. The equivalent gating charge of ENaC, emerging from these data, was 0.79 elementary charges, and was not influenced by Zn(2+). The stimulatory effect of high Zn(2+) concentrations could be reproduced by intra-oocyte injection of Zn(2+) (approximately 10 microM), which had no direct effect on the amiloride-sensitive conductance, but switched the effect of extracellular Zn(2+) from inhibition to activation.", 
    "15": "(-)-Isoprenaline enhances cardiac contractility through beta-adrenoceptors. However, in cardiac tissue from transgenic mice with a 200-400-fold cardiac overexpression of the human beta(2)-adrenoceptor (TG4) we observed a pronounced cardiodepression at high (-)-isoprenaline concentrations. Here, we investigated the functional role of the coexisting beta(1)-, beta(2)-, and beta(3)-adrenoceptor subtypes in several regions of the TG4 heart, and in particular their contribution to the negative inotropic effect. In paced TG4 left atria, (-)-isoprenaline produced bell-shaped concentration-effect curves increasing (-logEC(50)M=9.0) and decreasing (-logIC(50)M=6.4) contractile force. These effects were unaffected by the beta(1)-selective CGP 20712A (300 nM). The beta(2)-selective inverse agonist ICI 118,551 (30-1,000 nM) antagonised in surmountable manner both the positive and negative inotropic effects of (-)-isoprenaline with similar concentration-dependence, consistent with an exclusive mediation through beta(2)-adrenoceptors. The beta(3)-adrenoceptor-selective agonist BRL37344 (1 nM-10 microM) failed to produce significant inotropic effects in TG4 left atria. Subsequently, we measured left atrial action potentials accompanying the inotropic changes induced by (-)-isoprenaline. Action potentials tended to have shorter duration in left atria from TG4 mice than from non-transgenic littermate mice. However, (-)-isoprenaline prolonged the duration of 30% repolarisation in atria from non-transgenic littermate but not from TG4 mice, while 90% repolarisation was abbreviated in both groups of atria. Negative inotropic effects of (-)-isoprenaline were also observed in right ventricular preparations. Pertussis toxin-treatment of the mice abolished the negative inotropic effects in left atria and reduced cardiodepression in right ventricle, indicating an involvement of beta(2)-adrenoceptor coupling to PTX-sensitive G-proteins. In additional experiments, designed to study the native murine beta(1)-adrenoceptor function, we used the physiological beta(1)-adrenoceptor agonist (-)-noradrenaline. In the presence of 600 nM ICI 118,551 we failed to find a functional role of the beta(1)-adrenoceptors in left atria, and detected only a marginal contribution to the positive chronotropic effect in right atria. We also investigated the effects of the non-conventional partial agonist (-)-CGP 12177 (0.2 nM-6 microM), which in wild-type mice causes tachycardia through beta(1)-adrenoceptors. In TG4 right atria, however, (-)-CGP 12177-evoked tachycardia was resistant to blockade by CGP 20712A but antagonised by ICI 118,551, consistent with mediation through human beta(2)-adrenoceptors. The results from TG4 mice suggest that the positive and negative inotropic effects of (-)-isoprenaline are mediated through human overexpressed beta(2)-adrenoceptors coupled to G(s) protein and G(i) protein, respectively. The (-)-isoprenaline-evoked shortening of the atrial action potential combined with reduced responses of L-type Ca(2+) current may contribute to the negative inotropic effects. The function of murine cardiac beta(1)-adrenoceptors is suppressed by overexpressed human beta(2)-adrenoceptors.",

    "19": "The mean age of the patients enrolled was 65 years, 33% were women, and 26% had diabetes. Large differences were observed in the clinical profile of patients admitted to different centers, especially relative the history of previous disease, prior coronary revascularization, and co-morbidity. Antiplatelet treatment was used in 93% of patients, heparin in 45%, beta-blockers in 42%, nitrates in 67%, and calcium antagonists in 46%. During hospitalization, exercise stress testing was performed in 37% of patients, coronary angiography in 32%, coronary angioplasty in 9%, and coronary surgery in 4%. Inter-hospital variability was minimal for the use of antiplatelet agents, wide for the use of heparin and beta-blockers, and huge for the use of revascularization procedures. Mortality and the incidence of death or myocardial infarction were 2.6% and 4.4% during hospitalization, and 4.6% and 8% at 3 months, with wide inter-hospital variability. These differences were not significant once adjusted for clinical characteristics and the treatment received at admission.", 
    "20": "Patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes represent an heterogeneous group with a high incidence of complications.

    "21": "Class III antiarrhythmic drugs, especially amiodarone (a broad-spectrum antiarrhythmic agent), have gained popularity for use in clinical practice in recent years. Other class III antiarrhythmic drugs include bretylium, dofetilide, ibutilide and sotalol. These agents are effective for the management of various types of cardiac arrhythmias both atrial and ventricular in origin. Class III antiarrhythmic drugs may interact with other drugs by two major processes: pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions. The pharmacodynamic interaction occurs when the pharmacological effects of the object drug are stimulated or inhibited by the precipitant drug. Pharmacokinetic interactions can result from the interference of drug absorption, metabolism and/or elimination of the object drug by the precipitant drug. Among the class III antiarrhythmic drugs, amiodarone has been reported to be involved in a significant number of drug interactions. It is mainly metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 and it is a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2C9, 2D6 and 3A4. In addition, amiodarone may interact with other drugs (such as digoxin) via the inhibition of the P-glycoprotein membrane transporter system, a recently described pharmacokinetic mechanism of drug interactions. Bretylium is not metabolised; it is excreted unchanged in the urine. Therefore the interactions between bretylium and other drugs (including other antiarrhythmic drugs) is primarily through the pharmacodynamic mechanism. Dofetilide is metabolised by CYP3A4 and excreted by the renal cation transport system. Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (such as erythromycin) and/or the renal transport system (such as triamterene) may interact with dofetilide. It appears that the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions between ibutilide and other drugs is low. This is because ibutilide is not metabolised by CYP3A4 or CYP2D6. However, ibutilide may significantly interact with other drugs by a pharmacodynamic mechanism. Sotalol is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. The potential for drug interactions due to hepatic enzyme induction or inhibition appears to be less likely. However, a number of drugs (such as digoxin) have been reported to interact with sotalol pharmacodynamically. If concurrent use of a class III antiarrhythmic agent and another drug cannot be avoided or no published studies for that particular drug interaction are available, caution should be exercised and close monitoring of the patient should be performed in order to avoid or minimise the risks associated with a possible adverse drug interaction.", 
    "22": "We investigated the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (temocapril) and an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (olmesartan) on changes in myocardial sympathetic nervous activity, fatty acid metabolism and myocardial blood flow using 131I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine, 125I-beta-methyl-iodophenyl pentadecanoic acid and 99mTc-tetrofosmin, respectively, in rats with isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent isoproterenol administration (3 mg/kg per day) for 1 week by osmotic mini-pump. The hearts were excised and analyzed for the uptake of meta-iodobenzylguanidine. Beta-methyl-iodophenyl pentadecanoic acid and tetrofosmin in 11 segments in four groups; sham group (saline), isoproterenol group (isoproterenol alone), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor group (isoproterenol and temocapril), and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker group (isoproterenol and olmesartan). Isoproterenol significantly increased the heart weight compared with the sham group, whereas it was significantly blunted in the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker groups. The ratio of the percent kilogram dose per gram of meta-iodobenzylguanidine to tetrofosmin, an index of myocardial sympathetic nervous activity, was significantly decreased in the isoproterenol group (0.18 +/- 0.01) compared with the sham group (0.41 +/- 0.03). Importantly, these changes were significantly improved in the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (0.28 +/- 0.01) and the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker groups (0.32 +/- 0.01). The ratio of the percent kilogram dose per gram of beta-methyl-iodophenyl pentadecanoic acid to tetrofosmin, an index of myocardial fatty acid metabolism, was significantly decreased in the isoproterenol group (1.30 +/- 0.03) compared with the sham group (1.60 +/- 0.10). In contrast, there were no significant differences in beta-methyl-iodophenyl pentadecanoic acid to tetrofosmin ratios between the sham and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor groups, or the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker group. Cardiac hypertrophy induced by chronic beta-adrenergic stimulation is accompanied by impairment of sympathetic nervous activity and fatty acid metabolism. These abnormalities are effectively prevented by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker.", 
    "23": "Upon agonist binding, beta-adrenergic receptors sequestrate from the cell surface plasma membrane to cytosol. In the present study, we examine the kinetics of sequestration of beta1-adrenergic receptor and beta3-adrenergic receptor subtypes by radioligand binding assays using whole cells ('whole cell binding assays'). We found that HEK293T cells, but not COS1 cells, were readily and uniformly detached from the culture dish upon exposure to ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Using this property of HEK293T cells, we conducted whole cell binding assays using a hydrophilic antagonist ([3H]CGP-12177) and HEK293T cells transiently overexpressing human beta1-adrenergic receptor or beta3-adrenergic receptor. The Bmax and Kd values were 5.96 +/- 0.97 pmol/mg protein and 1 +/- 0.23 nM for the beta1-adrenergic receptor, and were 1.84 +/- 0.13 pmol/mg protein and 44.7 +/- 2.5 nM for the beta3-adrenergic receptor, respectively. Isoproterenol treatment, but not 6-[3-(dimethylamino)propionyl]forskolin treatment, for 2 h resulted in a dose-dependent loss of the number of the cell surface beta1-adrenergic receptor. At 100 microM, 36.6 +/- 5.7% of the cell surface beta1-adrenergic receptor was lost. In contrast, the cell surface beta3-adrenergic receptor number remained unchanged with isoproterenol treatment. Thus, beta1-adrenergic receptor sequestrates upon agonist stimulation but the same agonist stimulation does not induce beta3-adrenergic receptor sequestration, as demonstrated by our whole cell binding assays.", 
    "24": "To examine the effect of the addition of a beta-blocker in the treatment of chronic heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy, we compared the change of left ventricular remodeling and the prognosis between patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and patients who had beta-blockers added to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Fifty-seven patients were treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in addition to combination therapy with furosemide, spironolactone and digoxin. In 60 patients, a beta-blocker was administered in addition to combination therapy with furosemide, spironolactone, digoxin and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Changes of left ventricular dimensions at end-diastole and end-systole, fractional shortening, cardiac events and death were examined during the follow-up periods. The mean follow-up periods were 4.9 +/- 4.1 years in the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor group and 3.9 +/- 2.5 years in the beta-blocker group, respectively. Baseline hemodynamic characteristics showed no significant differences between the two groups. After the treatment, the heart rate significantly decreased in both groups and the systolic blood pressure increased in the beta-blocker group. Both left ventricular dimensions at end-diastole and end-systole significantly decreased in both groups. Fractional shortening increased from 17.0 +/- 7.6 to 19.8 +/- 8.9% (p = 0.017) in the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor group and from 16.6 +/- 7.2 to 24.7 +/- 8.0% (p < 0.0001) in the beta-blocker group, respectively. Changes of left ventricular dimensions at end-diastole and at end-systole, and fractional shortening were all greater in the beta-blocker group than in the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor group. The event-free rate and the cumulative survival rate during the follow-up periods were markedly better in the beta-blocker group than in the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor group (p = 0.0019 and p = 0.0099, respectively). These results indicate that the suppression of left ventricular remodeling and the improvement of prognosis in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy are markedly stronger in the beta-blocker group than in the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor group. Thus, beta-blocker should be added to patients with dilated cardiomyopathy treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.", 
    "25": "Data from the completed \"Suppression of Atrial Fibrillation by DDD+ Overdrive Pacing with Inos2 CLS (closed-loop system) Pacemakers\" multicenter trial were retrospectively evaluated to examine the influence of concomitant antiarrhythmic drugs on the clinical success of conventional single site right atrial overdrive pacing compared with DDD pacing. The DDD+ overdrive algorithm provided > 90% atrial pacing at a rate slightly above the intrinsic atrial rate. Seventy-five patients with conventional pacing indications and paroxysmal, recurrent atrial tachyarrhythmia have completed the study. They were randomized to 6 months of DDD or DDD+ pacing, followed by mode crossover and an additional 6-month follow-up in the alternate mode. The incidence of atrial tachyarrhythmia during each period was compared using data on sustained (> 60 s) mode switch episodes stored in the pacemaker memory. A stable antiarrhythmic drug regimen was allowed during the study. beta-Adrenergic blockers and Class III antiarrhythmics, prescribed to 54.7% and 40.0% of patients respectively, were linked to minimal or no benefit of overdrive pacing compared with DDD pacing. In contrast, patients untreated with beta-adrenergic blockers or Class III drugs had a significant reduction in atrial tachyarrhythmia burden of > 5 hours/patient per week (P < 0.05) during overdrive. Changes with Class I and Class IV antiarrhythmic drugs, prescribed to 18.7% and 13.3% of patients, respectively, were insignificant. Our data indicate that clinical trials that prohibit the use of beta-adrenergic blockers may record more favorable outcomes with dynamic atrial overdrive algorithms versus conventional DDDR pacing, than studies allowing concomitant beta-adrenergic blockade.",

In the past 12-18 months, there have been several reported advances in our understanding of beta-blocker therapy for heart failure. Despite these advances, there remain several unanswered questions with regard to beta-blockers. These involve, firstly, clarifying the underlying mechanisms of action of beta-blockers; secondly, further analysing patients with systolic heart failure who are not well-studied in major clinical trials (e.g. the elderly); thirdly, investigating unexplored indications for beta-blockers in heart failure; and finally, directly examining the clinical relevance of pharmacological differences among agents. The impact of genetic polymorphisms on the response to beta-blocker therapy, as well as interaction of these agents with future heart failure therapies, requires extensive investigation.", 
    "31": "Although recent advances have been made in the treatment of heart failure, this disease continues to result in significant morbidity and mortality. Among the negative effects associated with progression of heart failure are decline in myocardial reserve, decreased exercise tolerance, decreased contractile function, and altered cardiac gene expression. Guidelines recommend neurohormonal antagonists for treatment and stress the importance of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and beta-blockade in reversing the cardiac remodeling process. beta-Blockade slows or reverses the adverse effects resulting from chronic adrenergic stimulation. Traditionally, beta-blockers were reserved for mild-to-moderate heart failure, based on evidence from large, randomized clinical trials showing their positive effects on myocardial function and clinical outcomes. More recently, clinical data reveal that the agents can be expanded to patients with severe heart failure and those with left ventricular systolic dysfunction after myocardial infarction. Individual beta-blocking agents vary in their pharmacology and dosing requirements. These variations may influence treatment decisions and affect clinical measurements of left ventricular function and ventricular remodeling.",

The BV pacing successfully prevented the multiple ICD shocks accompanied with an improvement in left ventricular systolic function and physical activity.", 
    "36": "We have studied 12 recreationally active men to measure their responses to exercise in the heat and relate these to measures of hypothalamic function explored with a buspirone [5-hydroxytryptamine 1A (5-HT(1A)) agonist, dopaminergic D(2) antagonist] neuroendocrine challenge, with and without pretreatment with pindolol (5-HT(1A) antagonist). Pindolol treatment allowed the serotonergic and non-serotonergic components of prolactin release to be distinguished. Subjects exercised at 73 (5)% maximal rate of oxygen uptake (VO(2max)) until volitional fatigue at 35 degrees C (relative humidity, 30%). On another two occasions they underwent a buspirone challenge [0.5 mg (kg body mass)(-1)], once with, and once without, pindolol [0.5 mg (kg body mass)(-1)] pretreatment and the circulating plasma concentrations of prolactin were measured for the next 2.5 h. Rectal temperature increased throughout exercise, whilst mean skin temperature remained constant. There was a wide inter-subject variation in prolactin response to the neuroendocrine challenges. The proportion of the prolactin response to buspirone attributable to a non-serotonergic component (most likely dopaminergic) correlated both with exercise duration (r=0.657, P=0.028), rectal temperature at fatigue (r=0.623, P=0.041) and the rate of temperature rise (r=-0.669, P=0.024). Our results suggest that high activity of the dopaminergic pathways in the hypothalamus is a predictor of exercise tolerance in the heat.",

We investigated the influence of Ang II on cell proliferation and synthesis of extracellular matrix (collagen I, III and fibronectin) in human renal fibroblasts derived from normal (TK 173 cell line) and fibrotic (TK 188 cell line) kidneys which possess both Ang II type l and type 2 (AT1 and AT2) receptors. Incubation of the cells with Ang II increased the cell proliferation and the synthesis of extracellular matrix significantly in both cell lines. However, proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis showed a greater increase in the cells derived from the fibrotic kidney. The Ang II mediated effect on cell proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis was diminished in the presence of the AT1 receptor blocker losartan in both cell lines. No inhibition was observed using the AT2 receptor blocker PD123319. Ang II induced cell proliferation could be completely inhibited by incubation with human TGF-beta1 antibody. Incubation with Ang II did not affect TGF beta 1 production but in untreated cells TGF-beta 1 content was higher in the cells derived from the fibrotic kidney. This might be the reason for the more sensitive reaction on exposure to Ang II.", 
    "38": "In light of the increasing prevalence, morbidity, and mortality of heart failure, effective preventative strategies are urgently needed. Risk factors for heart failure include coronary artery disease and other atherosclerotic vascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, renal insufficiency, obesity, and family history of cardiomyopathy. Essential strategies for prevention of heart failure are modification of risk factors for heart failure development; comprehensive hypertension, atherosclerosis, and diabetes treatment; and detection and treatment of asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. The B-type natriuretic peptide assay may aid in identifying asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction in patients with risk factors for heart failure. In patients with hypertension, atherosclerosis, and/or diabetes, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, beta-blocker, aspirin, and statin therapy can prevent progression to symptomatic heart failure. Avoidance of calcium channel-blockers as first-line antihypertensive therapy can also reduce the risk of heart failure. There remain substantial opportunities to improve implementation of therapies proven to prevent heart failure in the large number of patients at risk.", 
    "39": "BH3 (Bcl-2 homology 3)-only proteins of the Bcl-2 family activate Bax or Bak during apoptosis to promote the release of pro-death factors sequestered in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Previous results demonstrated that a synthetic BH3 peptide mimics the ability of the BH3-only protein Bid to promote Bax insertion and cytochrome c (cyt c) release from neural cell mitochondria. However, the BH3 peptide was deficient in promoting cyt c release from mitochondria without associated Bax, such as adult rat brain mitochondria. This study tested the hypothesis that the amphiphilic membrane-active cationic drugs dibucaine and propranolol block BH3 peptide-initiated cyt c efflux by preventing the integration of Bax into the mitochondrial outer membrane. BH3 peptide-initiated release of cyt c from GT1-7 neural cell mitochondria was inhibited by dibucaine and propranolol at concentrations of 100-300 microm. Recombinant Bax (100 nm) alone did not release cyt c from adult rat brain mitochondria; however, when BH3 peptide or caspase-8 cleaved Bid (cBid) was added, robust cyt c release was achieved that was inhibited completely by 200 microm dibucaine or propranolol. These drugs at similar concentrations also inhibited release of entrapped 10 kDa dextrans from protein-free liposomes treated with Bax and cBid. Contrary to the hypothesis that dibucaine and propranolol act by inhibiting the insertion of Bax into the mitochondrial outer membrane, membrane insertion of Bax was not inhibited in mitochondria or liposomes, indicating a mechanism of drug action downstream from this event. These results suggest that dibucaine and propranolol inhibit Bax-induced permeability changes through a direct interaction with the lipid membrane and present a novel target for the development of neuroprotective, antiapoptotic therapeutics.", 
    "40": "We describe a simple and selective method for analysing propranolol and a sensitive test for its control in urine. A flow-through fluorescence optosensor based on on-line immobilization in a non-ionic-exchanger (Amberlite XAD-7) solid support in a continuous flow was used in both cases. Determination was made in 5 mM H(2)PO(4)(-)/HPO(4)(2-) buffer solution at pH 6 at a working temperature of 20 degrees C. Fluorescence intensities were measured at lambda(ex/em) = 300/338 nm with a response time of 80 s, thus obtaining a linear concentration range of between 0 and 250.0 ng ml(-1) with a detection limit of 1.3 ng ml(-1), an analytical sensitivity of 6.0 ng ml(-1) and a standard deviation of 2.40% at a 150 ng ml(-1) concentration level for propranolol. We also propose a test to detect propranolol in urine with a linear concentration range between 0 and 100.0 ng ml(-1), a detection limit of 0.2 ng ml(-1), an analytical sensitivity of 1.0 ng ml(-1), and a standard deviation of 0.84% at a 75 ng ml(-1) concentration level. The effect of proteins presents in urine samples were evaluated. The two proposed methods were satisfactorily applied to commercial formulations and urine samples respectively.", 
    "41": "Electrophysiological mechanisms of the action of cardiocyclide, nibentan, and sotalol--antiarrhythmic agents of class III--was studied in dogs with experimental myocardial infarction induced by a two-step occlusion of the coronary artery. Cardiocyclide exhibited the properties typical of the class III antiarrhythmics by prolonging the ventricular repolarization and increasing the effective refractory periods in the atrium and ventricles. The degree of manifestation of these antiarrhythmic effects of cardiocyclide is independent of the induced heart rate, which is related to the ability of this drug to block the slow activation component (IKs) of the delayed rectified potassium current. Nibentan elongates the QT interval and increases the effective atrial and ventricular refractory periods, but the effect was dependent of the stimulation frequency. Sotalol, which also exhibited the properties of a class III antiarrhythmogen possessing beta-blocking activity, produced more pronounced inhibiting action upon the sinus node function and conduction (in comparison with the analogous effects of cardiocyclide). This is probably related to the ability of sotalol to block the cardiac adrenoreceptors. The effect of sotalol is also frequency-dependent, which is related to the blocking of rapid activating component (IKr) of) of the delayed rectified potassium current. On the background of isoproterenol infusion, cardiocyclide completely retained the electrophysiological and antiarrhythmic effects. The efficacy of nibentan and sotalol with respect to the repolarization and refractoriness significantly decrease under the conditions of sympathetic nervous system activation. The ability of sotalol to suppress the sinus node function and conduction on the background of isoproterenol infusion is retained.", 
    "42": "beta(1)-Adrenoceptor autoantibodies are present in about 30% of patients suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy. The apoptotic effects mediated by beta(1)-adrenoceptor antibodies remain to be studied. Monoclonal antibodies were raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the second extracellular loop of the human beta(1)-adrenoceptor in balb/C mouse, and were characterized by enzyme immunoassay. Purified immunoglobulin G from nonimmunized animals (controls) did not influence the rate of apoptosis. beta(1)-Adrenoceptor antibodies caused a dose-related increase in apoptotic cells: annexin test (dilution 1:2: 21+/-1.1% apoptotic cells vs. 4+/-0.4% apoptotic cells in controls; p<0.01); TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) test (dilution 1:2: 26+/-2% apoptotic cells vs. 10+/-2% apoptotic cells in controls; p<0.01). The effect of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor antibodies was blocked by the antigenic peptide and by the antagonist metoprolol (10 micromol/l). The apoptotic effect induced by isoproterenol was attenuated by the beta(1)-adrenoceptor antibody. After pre-incubation of cardiomyocytes with the protein kinase A inhibitor Rp-Adenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphothioate triethylamine (RpcAMPS), beta(1)-adrenoceptor antibody was not capable of inducing an increase of the rate of apoptosis. beta(1)-Adrenoceptor antibodies induced apoptosis in adult rat cardiomyocytes via the protein kinase A cascade.",

A number of patients in which Betoptic S didn't cause an ocular pressure compensation were given Xalatan. This association was a beneficial one. In those patients with open-angled glaucoma in terminal stage Betoptic S and Xalatan association was inefficient. In those patients which were not treated at all, visual capacity decreased to zero.",

    "50": "AFl recurrence on Amio, PPF or Sot is associated with the continued presence of an EG and fully excitable portion. These findings explain the persistent viability of the AFl circuit despite drug therapy in these patients.", 
    "51": "We previously reported that acute cold/restraint stress (ACRS) significantly inhibits host resistance to Listeria monocytogenes (LM) in BALB/c mice and that the sympathetic nervous system plays a major role in this inhibition. Here, we have further investigated the involvement of adrenergic receptor (ADR) subtypes. beta-ADR antagonist propranolol, but not alpha-ADR antagonist phentolamine significantly enhanced host resistance of ACRS mice. Pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-6, IL-1beta, and TNFalpha) and IFNgamma levels positively correlated with the LM levels in all groups of mice. Furthermore, beta1-ADR antagonist atenolol but not beta2-ADR antagonist ICI118,551 significantly decreased LM burden in ACRS mice. In addition, SCID mice on the same genetic background (BALB/c), which have no adaptive immune potential, were used to assess the immune responses targeted by ACRS. ACRS-induced suppression of host resistance was not observed in SCID mice, and propranolol pretreatment provided no further improvement of host resistance, indicating that ACRS mainly affects adaptive immunity, which is less critical in mice with greater innate than adaptive immunity. In summary, the data suggest that ACRS inhibition of host resistance to LM is mediated through beta1-ADR stimulation, which appears to directly or indirectly modify activation of T cells or subsequent T cell functions involved in adaptive immunity, thus inhibiting overall host resistance. Interestingly, with heightened innate immunity and the absence of adaptive immunity, as observed in the SCID mice, ACRS does not affect host resistance, which emphasizes the importance of innate immunity in defense against bacterial infection.",

Betaxolol increased the perfusion flow rate, significantly at the administrations of more than 50 microM concentrations and induced a dose-related, reversible increase in the amplitudes of both the a-wave and b-wave of ERG. These results suggest that the calcium-channel blocking mechanism of betaxolol has a beneficial influence on ocular blood flow and retinal electrical activity in response to light. As it is known that ERG is a good indicator of the functional integrity of the retina, this indicates that betaxolol could be an ideal drug for treating glaucoma in which ischemia is involved to some extent.", 
    "57": "The aim of this study was to asses the direct effect of ET-1 on spontaneous discharge rate of the pacemaker tissue in the presence of isoproterenol. The experiments were performed on pacemaker tissue of the isolated right auricle of the right heart atrium of a two-day-old rat. The spontaneous discharge rate of the pacemaker tissue was recorded on the ECG apparatus and analyzed by the computer. ET-1 alone did not significantly affect the discharge rate of the pacemaker tissue. Isoproterenol rapidly increased the discharge rate of the pacemaker tissue. ET-1 had negative chronotropic effect in the presence of isoproterenol. JKC-301, a blocker of ET(A) receptors, significantly reduced the negative chronotropic effect of ET-1 in the presence of isoproterenol, whereas IRL-1038, a blocker of ET(B) receptors, did not significantly affect the negative chronotropic effect of ET-1 in the presence of isoproterenol. In conlusion, the negative chronotropic effect of ET-1 in the presence of beta-adrenergic stimulation the pacemaker tissue of the right auricle of the right heart atrium of the two-day-old rat is mediated by ET(A) receptors.",

Children diagnosed with asthma were identified by a sensitive algorithm applied to the information stored in the computerized medical records between 1997 and 1998. Pediatricians then reviewed and validated the diagnosis. Specific information was obtained, after age stratification under 5 yrs and over 6 ys, from the medical records and by interview regarding their personal details and treatment of asthmatic patients. In all, 1,263 cases of asthma were identified (64% males) with a prevalence of 6.3% among males and 4% among females in under 5 year-olds, and 3.9% for males and 2.1% for females in over 6 year-olds. The prevalence of asthma diagnosed directly by the pediatrician was consequently higher among under 5 year-olds, in both genders, than among the older children. Contrary to the international guidelines, pediatricians prescribed more oral corticosteroids and nebulized short-acting beta-2 agonists for children under 5 ys olds than for over 6 year-olds (13.3% Vs 4.8% and 25% Vs 10.9%, respectively, p < 0.001). For the > or = 6 year-olds, the most commonly prescribed treatments were oral antihistamines (13.9% Vs 12.6%), inhaled corticosteroids via metered-dose inhaler (30.8% Vs 28.7%) and sodium cromoglycate (12.1% Vs 4.8%, p < 0.001).", 
    "59": "Bleeding from varices is a very serious complication in cirrhotic patients, with a mean mortality rate around 30 %. If the portal vein pressure is decreased by pharmacological therapy the varices will not bleed and progressively decrease in size. The portal hypertension in cirrhotic patients develops as a consequence of two mechanisms: the increase of portal inflow and the increase of intrahepatic resistance. The aim of our study was to find out if propranolol can prevent the bleeding from esophageal varices and if it acts by reducing the portal inflow due to splanchnic vasodilatation. The study was initiated in 53 patients with portal hypertension, of whom 14 were withdrawn because of adverse effects of propranolol. Abdominal ultrasonography and Doppler of portal vein system were performed in all subjects. The ultrasonographic parameters were measured before and after a 3-year treatment with propranolol. The patients also underwent endoscopy for evaluation of esophageal varices; the endoscopy was repeated at the end-point of treatment. We noted that propranolol reduced the portal blood inflow and the size of esophageal varices, and that the incidence of hemorrhages by variceal rupture was very low in these patients.", 
    "60": "Acebutolol (AC) is a chiral beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking agent, which has been shown to be clinically effective in hypertension. The plasma concentration-time profiles of AC exhibit two peaks following oral administration of racemate for both R- and S-enantiomers. In the present study, the absorption of AC after a single dose was studied as a function of gastric pH in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Furthermore, the effect of cimetidine (CIM) on pharmacokinetic parameters of AC and its metabolite diacetolol (DC) was evaluated. CIM (50 mg kg(-1)) was administered via jugular vein 30 min prior to AC administration to elevate the intragastric pH. AC (50 mg kg(-1)) was administered orally by gavage and serial blood samples were collected before and for 8h after AC administration. Plasma samples were assayed for AC and DC, pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated and compared with those of control. The concentration-time profiles and the pharmacokinetics of AC were unchanged after co-administration of CIM. The oral absorption of AC, as assessed by the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and the amount of unchanged drug recovered in the urine were not affected by CIM. The amount of metabolite recovered in the urine and the rate of absorption, however, were significantly altered. These are unlikely to be of clinically importance as we have found that the extent of absorption was not changed. We, therefore, concluded that intragastric elevation of pH has no effect either on generation of multiple peaking or on pharmacokinetic parameters of AC.", 
    "61": "Previously, we have demonstrated that plasma membranes from the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) recognize and adhere to host cells through parasite surface attachment molecules that have affinity for beta(1)-adrenergic receptors (beta(1)-ARs) on target organs. In this report we identify a parasite protein that not only interacts with beta(1)-ARs, but also displays beta-agonist-like activity. We demonstrate that a recombinant maltose binding protein fusion of Tc13 Tul (MBP-Tc13 Tul), a member of the T. cruzi antigen 13 family of surface antigen proteins, competes for binding sites with the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist [125I]-CYP on membranes purified both from CHO cells expressing human beta(1)-ARs and from rat atria. The competition is prevented by pre-treating MBP-Tc13 Tul with antibodies directed against the EPKSA repeat domain of Tc13 Tul, implicating this portion of the molecule in binding to the beta(1)-AR. Furthermore, MBP-Tc13 Tul activates rat myocardial beta(1)-ARs, resulting in synthesis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and an increase in cardiac contractility. These biological effects are selectively suppressed by the beta(1)-AR antagonist atenolol, by a synthetic peptide corresponding to the second extracellular loop of the human beta(1)-AR, and by the anti-EPKSA repeat antibodies. These results imply that the Tc13 Tul cell-surface antigen of T. cruzi plays a central role in misregulating the beta(1)-AR following parasite infection, and may be a causative factor of dysautonomic syndrome described in Chagas' disease.", 
    "62": "1,3-Dioxolane-based compounds (2-14) were synthesized, and the pharmacological profiles at alpha(1)-adrenoceptor subtypes were assessed by functional experiments in isolated rat vas deferens (alpha(1A)), spleen (alpha(1B)), and aorta (alpha(1D)). Compound 9, with a pA(2) of 7.53, 7.36, and 8.65 at alpha(1A), alpha(1B), and alpha(1D), respectively, is the most potent antagonist of the series, while compound 10 with a pA(2) of 8.37 at alpha(1D) subtype and selectivity ratios of 162 (alpha(1D)/alpha(1A)) and 324 (alpha(1D)/alpha(1B)) is the most selective. Binding assays in CHO cell membranes expressing human cloned alpha(1)-adrenoceptor subtypes confirm the pharmacological profiles derived from functional experiments, although the selectivity values are somewhat lower. Therefore, it is concluded that 1,3-dioxolane-based ligands are a new class of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists.", 
    "63": "The final results of the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) have shown that the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril was better than the beta blocker metoprolol or the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker amlodipine in slowing the rate of glomerular filtration rate decline in African American patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency. Of note, there was no difference between the 92 mm Hg or less (lower group) and the 102-107 mm Hg (usual) mean arterial pressure groups as regards the secondary clinical composite end point. The secondary clinical composite end point in this study comprised a threshold drop of at least 50% or 25 mL/min in glomerular filtration rate, death, or reaching end-stage renal disease. The final results from this study would suggest that reduction in blood pressure to levels below those currently advocated for cardiovascular risk reduction, although a clearly attainable goal in this population, does not provide readily identifiable benefits to African Americans with hypertensive nephrosclerosis. Importantly, this study provides the basis for the primary use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in an African American population with the characteristics of those studied in AASK. It remains to be determined if this represents a class effect for all angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "64": "Sympathetic nerves may play a role in vascular disorders of the eye. In the present study, we hypothesized that activation of beta3-adrenergic receptors on retinal endothelial cells would promote migration and proliferation of these cells, two markers of an angiogenic phenotype. We show, for the first time, expression of beta3-adrenergic receptors on cultured retinal endothelial cells. Activation of these receptors with BRL37344, a specific beta3-adrenergic receptor agonist, promoted migration that was blocked by inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), the mitogen activated protein kinase component MEK, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2 and 9. BRL37344 stimulated proliferation, which could be blocked by inhibitors of Src, PI3K, and MEK. These cells also express the beta1-adrenergic receptor with no beta2-adrenergic receptor expression observed. Stimulation of the beta1-adrenergic receptor with xamoterol, a specific partial agonist, did not promote proliferation or migration. These results support the hypothesis that beta3-adrenergic receptors play a role in proliferation and migration of cultured human retinal endothelial cells.", 
    "65": "Inducible-cAMP early repressor (ICER) is a potent inhibitor of CRE (cAMP-related element)-driven gene transcription. In the rat pineal gland, it has been proposed to be part of the mechanisms involved in the shutting down of the transcription of the gene coding for arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AA-NAT, the melatonin rhythm-generating enzyme). In this study, we report that ICER is expressed in the pineal gland of the photoperiodic rodent Syrian hamster although with some difference compared to the rat. In the Syrian hamster pineal, Icer mRNA levels, low at daytime, displayed a 20-fold increase during the night. Nighttime administration of a beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol, significantly reduced Icer mRNA levels although daytime administration of a beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, was unable to raise the low amount of Icer mRNA. These observations indicate that Icer mRNA expression is induced by the clock-driven norepinephrine release and further suggest that this stimulation is restricted to nighttime, as already observed for Aa-nat gene transcription. Furthermore, we found that the daily profile of Icer mRNA displayed photoperiodic variation with a lengthening of the nocturnal peak in short versus long photoperiod. These data indicate that ICER may be involved in both daily and seasonal regulation of melatonin synthesis in the Syrian hamster.", 
    "66": "Although men have a higher risk of atrial fibrillation compared with women, the absolute number of women with atrial fibrillation is greater. Congestive heart failure increases the risk of developing atrial fibrillation in women more than in men, and the prognosis for women with atrial fibrillation is worse than for men. The longer baseline corrected QT interval in women is well known. The mechanism is likely the result of increased circulating androgens, causing the QT interval to shorten in men after puberty. Female sex is associated with an increased risk of torsades de pointes in the setting of potassium antagonists. Class III antiarrhythmic drugs are frequently used for the treatment of atrial fibrillation in heart failure patients because of their neutral effect on mortality and their tolerance by patients with low ejection fractions. Although amiodarone and azimilide carry a low potential for producing torsades de pointes compared with sotalol and dofetilide, the prevalence of torsades de pointes in women is at least twice that in men for all these drugs. Careful monitoring of the QT interval and potassium level, as well as control of congestive heart failure, can help reduce the risk of proarrhythmia. Avoidance of polypharmacy with other potassium antagonists and unmonitored drug formulation changes are important in the management of all patients taking class III agents, but they are particularly crucial in women with additional risk factors for torsades de pointes.", 
    "67": "In managing atrial fibrillation (AF), the main therapeutic strategies include rate control, termination of the arrhythmia, and the prevention of recurrences and thromboembolic events. Safety and efficacy considerations are important in optimizing the choice of an antiarrhythmic drug for the treatment of AF. Recently approved antiarrhythmics, such as dofetilide, and promising investigational drugs, such as azimilide and dronedarone, may change the treatment landscape for AF. For medical conversion of recent-onset AF, class IC antiarrhythmic drugs, administered as an oral bolus, have been demonstrated to be the most efficacious pharmacologic conversion agents. Intravenous ibutilide and oral dofetilide both have efficacies superior to placebo in controlled trials for converting persistent AF. Comparative trials in paroxysmal AF have demonstrated that flecainide, propafenone, quinidine, and sotalol are equally effective in preventing recurrences of AF. Amiodarone has been demonstrated to be more efficacious than propafenone or sotalol in the Canadian Trial of Atrial Fibrillation. In persistent AF, twice-daily dofetilide has been shown to be as or more effective than low-dose sotalol given twice daily for the maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with AF. Trials have demonstrated that subjective adverse effects are less frequent with class IC drugs, sotalol, and dofetilide compared with such drugs as quinidine. In patients without structural heart disease, flecainide, propafenone, and D,L-sotalol are the initial drugs of choice, given their reasonable efficacy, low incidence of subjective side effects, and lack of significant end-organ toxicity. Treating AF in patients with left ventricular dysfunction can be difficult because of associated electrophysiologic derangements, potential proarrhythmic concerns, and negative inotropic effects of antiarrhythmics. Some data exist suggesting that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers can prevent AF either by preventing atrial dilation and stretch-induced arrhythmias or by blocking the renin-angiotensin system. In post-myocardial infarction patients, D,L-sotalol, dofetilide, and amiodarone-and in congestive heart failure patients, amiodarone and dofetilide-have demonstrated neutral effects on survival in controlled trials. In the Congestive Heart Failure Survival Trial of Antiarrhythmic Therapy (CHF-STAT), amiodarone lowered the frequency of AF development and improved left ventricular ejection fraction over time. In CHF-STAT, there was lower mortality in patients who converted from AF to sinus rhythm. Dofetilide decreased rehospitalization for congestive heart failure in the Danish Investigations of Arrhythmia and Mortality on Dofetilide (DIAMOND) trials. Neutral effects on survival and favorable hemodynamics have positioned amiodarone and dofetilide as the antiarrhythmics of choice in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. In post-myocardial infarction patients, sotalol is an additional agent to consider for treatment of AF in this setting.", 
    "68": "Pharmacologic clinical trials in heart failure (HF) have provided substantial advances in effective treatment of this condition, moving us from our focus on short-term symptom relief to an expectation of substantial improvement in long-term clinical outcomes for our patients. Based on an appreciation of the importance of neurohormonal activation in the pathophysiology of HF, clinical trials have demonstrated the value of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers in impeding the progression of HF and in reducing morbidity and mortality for patients with this condition. Clinical trials have further demonstrated the benefits of digoxin in improving symptoms and reducing hospitalization frequency, as well as in aldosterone blockade, at least in patients with severe symptoms. Given the ethical imperative to treat with ACE inhibitors, the angiotensin receptor antagonists have been difficult to study; nevertheless, their value is becoming increasingly clear, particularly for patients intolerant of ACE inhibitors. Trials with several classes of newer agents-cytokine antagonists, endothelin receptor blockers, and vasopeptidase inhibitors-have recently yielded disappointing results. Early results with vasopressin receptor antagonists provide some promise of long-term benefit. Clinical trials have provided significant treatment advances; ongoing and future trials will demonstrate the degree to which we can improve on what we have achieved to date with pharmacologic treatments.",

Our results were applied to in vitro and in vivo data taken from literature.", 
    "71": "We found that MDT depends on q when q < 1 and is infinite when q > 1 and that the classic expression of MDT = 1/k. where k is the dissolution rate constant, holds only in the special case of q = 1. For the case of perfect sink conditions, MDT was found to be proportional to dose. Using dissolution data from literature with q < 1, we found better estimates of MDT when dependency on dose/ solubility ratio was considered than with the classic approach. Prediction of dissolution limited absorption was achieved for some of the in vivo drug examples examined.",

Heart failure is the prevailing diagnosis for hospital admissions in the United States for people over 65 years of age. It has a great impact on the health care delivery system as a whole for both inpatient and outpatient treatment. A comprehensive understanding of this disease state is paramount for health care providers. This article describes the epidemiology, risk factors, pathophysiology, and current treatment modalities for left ventricular systolic dysfunction related to heart disease.",

    "75": "As compared to conventional CT scanners, multi-slice spiral CT (MSCT) has improved temporal and spatial resolution. Dedicated image reconstruction algorithms permit to create cross-sectional images with a temporal resolution of approximately 150-250 ms, and a slice thickness of 0.75-1.3 mm (see Figure 1). In addition, image reconstruction can be synchronized to the ECG. This permits to use MSCT for visualization of the coronary artery lumen and detection of stenosis (see Figures 2 and 3). Various post-processing techniques can be used to display the coronary arteries. A low heart rate has been identified as an important prerequisite to obtain a sufficiently high image quality, and most authors recommend routine use of beta blocker premedication. Comparisons of 4-slice MSCT to invasive angiography concerning the detection of hemodynamically relevant coronary artery stenoses have resulted in sensitivities ranging from 72-93% and specificities ranging from 84-98%. However, up to 32% of all coronary segments had to be excluded from evaluation due to impaired image quality, in most cases due to severe calcification or insufficient suppression of motion artifacts. Initial results obtained with 16-slice MSCT scanners, which provide somewhat higher temporal and--through decreased slice thickness--improved spatial resolution, show promise that diagnostic accuracy may be increased while the number of coronary artery segments with nondiagnostic image quality may be reduced as compared to the prior generation of 4-slice scanners. Further studies are necessary to identify patient subgroups which might benefit from MSCT \"noninvasive coronary angiography\" in a clinical setting.", 
    "76": "In cirrhotic patients under pharmacologic treatment for portal hypertension, a reduction in hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) of >or=20% of baseline or to <or=12 mm Hg markedly reduces the risk of variceal rebleeding. This study was aimed at evaluating whether these hemodynamic targets also prevent other complications of portal hypertension and improve long-term survival. One hundred five cirrhotic patients included in prospective trials for the prevention of variceal rebleeding were studied. Seventy-three of the patients had 2 separate HVPG measurements, at baseline and under pharmacologic therapy with propranolol +/- isosorbide mononitrate. Patients were followed for up to 8 years. Survival and risk of developing portal hypertension-related complications were compared between responders and nonresponders. Twenty-eight patients showed a reduction of HVPG >or=20% of baseline or to <or=12 mm Hg (responders), and 45 patients were nonresponders. Nonresponders had a significantly greater risk of developing variceal rebleeding (P =.013), ascites (P =.025), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (P =.003), hepatorenal syndrome (P =.026), and hepatic encephalopathy (P =.024) than responders. Eight-year cumulative probability of survival was significantly lower in nonresponders than in responders (52% vs. 95%, respectively, P =.003). At multivariate analysis, being a nonresponder was independently associated with the risk of developing rebleeding, ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and lower survival. In conclusion, in cirrhotic patients receiving pharmacologic treatment for prevention of variceal rebleeding, a decrease in HVPG >or=20% or to <or=12 mm Hg is associated with a marked reduction in the long-term risk of developing complications of portal hypertension and with improved survival.",

Among these channels, Kv1.5 and Kv4.2 genes showed significant circadian variations in their transcripts: approximately 2-fold increase of Kv1.5 mRNA from trough at Zeitgeber time (ZT) 6 to peak at ZT18 and a completely reverse pattern in Kv4.2 mRNA ( approximately 2-fold increase from trough at ZT18 to peak at ZT6). Actually, along with the variations in the immunoreactive proteins, the density of the transient outward and steady-state currents in isolated myocytes and the responses of atrial and ventricular refractoriness to 4-aminopyridine in isolated-perfused hearts showed differences between ZT6 and ZT18, a circadian pattern comparable to that of Kv1.5 and Kv4.2 gene expression. Reversal of light stimulation almost inverted these circadian rhythms, although pharmacological autonomic blockade only partially attenuated the rhythm of Kv1.5 but not of Kv4.2 transcripts.",

Measurements were made of LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, ejection fraction, LV mass, severity of mitral regurgitation (MR), peak transmitral velocities during early (E-wave) and late (A-wave) diastolic filling, and the myocardial performance index. At 6 months, CRT was associated with reduced end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (both P<0.001), reduced LV mass (P<0.01), increased ejection fraction (P<0.001), reduced MR (P<0.001), and improved myocardial performance index (P<0.001) compared with control. beta-Blocker treatment status did not influence the effect of CRT.

Microiontophoretic administration of non-selective beta-ARs agonist isoproterenol significantly decreased firing rate and responses to superior cerebellar peduncle stimulation in 82% of studied neurons in a dose-dependent manner. Similar changes were induced by ejection of selective beta1-ARs agonist dobutamine, while fenoterol (selective beta2-ARs agonist) increased or reduced firing rate in 32% and 19% of M1 neurons, respectively. Non-selective beta-ARs antagonist propranolol enhanced both the background and evoked activity in 84% of tested neurons. These data provided the functional evidence for beta-ARs-mediated inhibition (predominantly through beta1-subtype) of cerebellocortical input to M1.

    "88": "Direct liquid chromatographic separations of the enantiomers of metoprolol and bisoprolol have been developed, using (R)-1-naphthylglycine and 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid as chiral stationary phase (CSP). The separations were achieved in a normal phase system employing a mobile phase containing n-hexane, 1,2-dichloroethane and methanol. Column efficiency was strongly dependent on the composition of the mobile phase. The eluent contents of methanol and of 1,2-dichloroethane were optimized, and so was flow-rate and column temperature. Under the optimal conditions, linear responses for (R)-metoprolol and (S)-metoprolol are obtained in the range of 0.079-1.38 and 0.015-5.80 mg/ml, with detection limits of 0.008 and 0.002 mg/ml, respectively. As for bisoprolol, the linear ranges of (R)-isomer and (S)-isomer are 0.05-1.31 and 0.02-1.00 mg/ml with detection limits of 0.001 and 0.008 mg/ml, respectively.

    "89": "Because many episodes of ventricular fibrillation (VF) are believed to be triggered by ventricular tachycardia (VT), patients who present with VT or VF are usually grouped together in discussions of natural history and treatment. However, there are significant differences in the clinical profiles of these 2 patient groups, and some studies have suggested differences in their response to therapy. We examined arrhythmias occurring spontaneously in 449 patients assigned to implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy in the Antiarrhythmics Versus Implantable Defibrillators (AVID) trial to determine whether patients who receive an ICD after VT have arrhythmias during follow-up that are different from patients who present with VF. ICD printouts were analyzed both by a committee blinded to the patients' original presenting arrhythmia and by the local investigator. During 31 +/- 14 months of follow-up, 2,673 therapies were reported. Patients who were enrolled in the AVID trial after an episode of VT were more likely to have an episode of VT (73.5% vs 30.1%, p <0.001), and were less likely to have an episode of VF (18.3% vs 28.0%, p = 0.013) than patients enrolled after an episode of VF. Adjustment for differences in ejection fraction, previous infarction, and beta-blocker and antiarrhythmic therapy did not appreciably change the results. Ventricular arrhythmia recurrence during follow-up is different in patients who originally present with VT than in those who originally present with VF. These findings suggest there are important differences in the electrophysiologic characteristics of these 2 patient populations.", 
    "90": "The primary result of myocardial ischaemia is reduced oxygen consumption and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) formation in the mitochondria, and accelerated anaerobic glycolysis, lactate accumulation and cell acidosis. Classic pharmacotherapy for demand-induced ischaemia is aimed at restoring the balance between ATP synthesis and breakdown by increasing the oxygen delivery (i.e. with long acting nitrates or Ca2+ channel antagonist) or by decreasing cardiac power by reducing blood pressure and heart rate (i.e. with beta-blocker or Ca2+ channel antagonist). Animal studies show that fatty acids are the primary mitochondrial substrate during moderate severity myocardial ischaemia, and that they inhibit the oxidation of carbohydrate and drive the conversion of pyruvate to lactate. Drugs that partially inhibit myocardial fatty acid oxidation increase carbohydrate oxidation, which results in reduced lactate production and a higher cell pH during ischaemia. Trimetazidine (1-[2,3,4-trimethoxibenzyl]-piperazine) is the first and only registered drug in this class, and is available in over 90 countries world-wide. Trimetazidine selectively inhibits the fatty acid beta-oxidation enzyme 3-keto-acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (3-KAT), and is devoid of any direct haemodynamic effects. In double-blind placebo-controlled trials trimetazidine significantly improved symptom-limited exercise performance in stable angina patients when used either as monotherapy or in combination with beta-blockers or Ca2+ channel antagonists. Given available evidence, trimetazidine is an excellent alternative to classic haemodynamic agents, and is unique in its ability to reduce symptoms of angina when used in patients resistant to a haemodynamic treatment as vasodilators, beta-blockers or Ca2+ channel antagonists.",

However, it is reasonable to conclude that thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-II receptor blockers, and perhaps angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be the preferred first-line agents for treatment of hypertension in diabetes. beta-Blockers and calcium-channel blockers are more effective than placebo, but they may not be as effective as diuretics, angiotensin-II receptor blockers, or ACE inhibitors; however, study results are inconsistent in this regard.",

    "98": "Bufuralol (BF), a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, has a chiral center in its molecule, yielding the enantiomers 1'R-BF and 1'S-BF. beta-Adrenoceptor blocking potency is much higher in 1'S-BF than in 1'R-BF. One of the metabolic pathways of BF is 1\"-hydroxylation of an ethyl group attached at the aromatic 7-position forming a carbinol metabolite (1\"-hydroxybufuralol, 1\"-OH-BF), and further oxidation (or dehydrogenation) produces a ketone metabolite (1-oxobufuralol, 1\"-Oxo-BF). Both 1\"-OH-BF and 1\"-Oxo-BF are known to have beta-adrenoceptor blocking activities comparable to or higher than those of the parent drug. The 1\"-hydroxylation introduces another chiral center into the BF molecule and four 1\"-OH-BF diastereomers are formed from BF racemate in mammals, including humans, making elucidation of the metabolic profiles complicated. HPLC methods employing derivatization, reversed phase, or chiral columns have been developed to efficiently separate the four 1\"-OH-BF diastereomers formed from BF enantiomers or racemate. Accumulated in vitro experimental results revealed that 1'R-BF is a much more preferential substrate than 1'S-BR for BF 1\"-hydroxylation in human liver microsomes. Kinetic studies using recombinant human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes indicate that CYP2D6 serves as a major BF 1\"-hydroxylase and that CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 also contribute to BF 1\"-hydroxylation in human livers. This mini-review summarizes the knowledge reported so far on the pharmacology of BF and its metabolites and the profiles of BF metabolism, especially focusing on the stereoselectivity in the oxidation of BF mainly in human livers and recombinant CYP enzymes.", 
    "99": "The trans-cardiac conductance (TCC) method provides on-line left ventricular (LV) volume signals by determining the electrical conductance of blood in the LV by means of central venous and epithoracic electrodes. Conductive structures outside the LV blood pool cause a \"parallel conductance\" offset term (Vp) that can be determined by bolus injections of hypertonic saline in the pulmonary artery (Vp(saline)), which cause a transient increase in blood conductivity. This study in anesthetized sheep evaluates the accuracy of the saline calibration method and the variabilities of Vp between animals, between hemodynamic conditions and during the cardiac cycle. The conventional intra-cardiac conductance catheter method was used to obtain independent estimates of Vp by the zero-volume method (Vp(zero volume)). Mean baseline Vp(saline) and Vp(zerovolume) were 104 +/- 6 ml and 106 +/- 6 ml, respectively. Bland-Altman analysis showed a small nonsignificant bias (-2.5 ml) and narrow limits of agreement (4.6 ml). Vp was not significantly different between hemodynamic conditions (baseline, dobutamine, volume load, propranolol), but had a substantial interanimal variability (IAV) (38%). Average variations during the cardiac cycle were < 10% of mean Vp. We conclude that the saline method can be applied to determine Vp for TCC. IAV is substantial, so that Vp must be determined in each animal, but within-animal variability is relatively small.",

Factors related to left ventricular hypertrophy progression or regression in the extremely elderly population including role of antihypertensive therapy, are not well recognized. We conducted a structured retrospective chart review analysis of a cohort of 100 homebound elderly, predominately female African American subjects. All persons had at least two 2-D echocardiograms interpreted by the same cardiologist prior to the initiation of this study. Information was collected on demographics, functional status, comorbid conditions, use of medication, and progression or regression of left ventricle hypertrophy between baseline and follow-up echocardiogram. At baseline and follow-up echocardiogram, 47% (n = 47) and 56% had evidence of hypertrophy, respectively. There was no association between treatment with beta-blocker, calcium channel-blocker, or diuretic therapy, and left ventricular hypertrophy at follow-up echocardiogram. Only angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy was associated with the progression of left ventricular hypertrophy in all subjects. Logistic regression analysis based on all subjects revealed that risk of left ventricular hypertrophy on follow-up echocardiogram was lower with increasing age (OR 0.95, CI 0.904-0.997) and higher with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy (OR 3.27, CI 1.41-7.63). Among subjects with no evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy at baseline, only the presence of hypertension was associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (OR 4.4, CI 1.19-16.3).

Treadmill exercise testing in this patient increased the corrected QT interval (QTc) from 0.48 s to 0.54 s and reduced the amplitude of the T wave. Left cardiac sympathectomy did not affect the resting heart rate or QTc but it prevented exercise-induced T wave reduction and QTc prolongation.

    "108": "Ractopamine HCl is an beta-adrenergic receptor (betaAR) ligand that was recently approved for use in swine to enhance carcass leanness. The RR stereoisomer of ractopamine is the most active of the four stereoisomers exhibiting the highest affinity and signaling response. The RR isomer exhibits selective activation of the porcine beta2AR, which might limit the lipolytic response to ractopamine because the betaAR is the predominant subtype in swine adipocytes and may mediate most of the lipolytic response. Therefore, we determined the betaAR subtypes that mediate the lipolytic response to ractopamine in swine adipocytes. In order to confirm the predominant role of the beta1AR in porcine adipocytes, isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis was inhibited by increasing doses of subtype-selective antagonists. Inhibition curves were biphasic using beta1AR antagonists (CGP 20712A and bisoprolol) and curve analysis indicated that both beta1AR an beta2AR contributed to lipolysis with 50 to 60% of the response coming from the beta1AR. Inhibition with the beta2AR antagonist clenbuterol revealed only one class of betaAR that closely approximated the kinetics of the beta1AR. When the RR isomer of ractopamine was the lipolytic agent, similar results to isoproterenol were observed, except that the estimated contribution of the beta1AR was 38%. That beta2AR antagonists did not detect a contribution of the beta2AR to lipolysis may indicate that the beta1AR masked the response to the beta2AR. Dose titration with the RR isomer in the presence of a saturating concentration of beta1AR or beta2AR antagonists indicated that each subtype was present in sufficient quantities to stimulate lipolysis near maximally. Data indicate that both the beta1AR and beta2AR are functionally linked to lipolysis in swine adipocytes and that ractopamine activates each subtype. The RR isomer of ractopamine stimulated adenosine 3',5'-cyclic phosphate accumulation with equal efficacy to isoproterenol through the cloned porcine beta2AR, but was only 35% as efficacious through the cloned porcine beta1AR. These data confirm the beta2AR selectivity of the RR stereoisomer, but suggest the partial agonism through the beta1AR is sufficient to activate lipolysis through both subtypes in swine adipocytes.",

At 09.00 hours (presumed trough) on day 60, mean reductions from baseline in intraocular pressure were 6.32+/-2.87 and 5.67+/-3.30 mmHg for the alginate carteolol and standard groups, respectively. At 11.00 hours (presumed peak), mean reductions were 6.70+/-2.81 and 6.55+/-3.35 mmHg, respectively. At each evaluation time, the two unilateral t tests were highly significant (p<0.005), confirming the equivalence of both treatments. Conclusions were not modified taking into account sex and diastolic blood pressure. Safety- Slight decreases in heart rate and blood pressure means were observed in both groups at follow-up visits with no significant difference between groups. Subjective tolerance upon instillation was judged good or very good at day 60 by 100% of alginate patients and by 98.7% of standard patients. Transient discomfort (mainly stinging or burning sensation) was reported by approximately 4% - 6% of patients in each treatment group at each visit. A blurred vision sensation was reported by 2 out of 74 patients of the alginate group. Among the 17 reported adverse events, three were assessed as drug-related: one vertigo, one superficial punctate keratitis in the alginate group and one decrease in blood pressure in the standard group. No serious adverse events were reported.",

Health-system pharmacists analyzed medical and pharmacy claims data to identify hypertensive patients. Chart review was conducted on a random sample of these patients to validate a hypertension diagnosis and to obtain blood pressure (BP) control rates and prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and comorbid conditions. The interventions consisted of educating health care providers and recommending appropriate pharmacotherapy for compelling indications. Patient outcomes were compared with baseline hypertension data. After interventions were implemented, medical and pharmacy claims identified 30,721 hypertensive patients and chart reviews were performed on a random sample of 417 patients. Pharmacy claims revealed a total of 193,311 antihypertensive prescriptions. Approximately 47% of all hypertensive patients were managed with monotherapy, while 24% received dual therapy, and 11% were taking three or more antihypertensive medications per day. Of the patients on monotherapy, 93% received an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (27.3%), diuretic (26.6%), beta-blocker (23.4%), or calcium channel blocker (15.4%). The overall level of BP control significantly improved from 37.2% at baseline to 49.2% at follow-up (p = 0.0007). BP control in the follow-up evaluation was 22.2% in diabetic patients. For treatment of patients with comorbid disease states, provider practice patterns were evaluated at baseline and follow-up. Improving the quality of hypertension management increased BP control from 37.2% to 49.2%. Continued efforts to improve hypertension management, particularly in patients with concomitant diabetes and in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension, are needed.", 
    "134": "To evaluate the effects of left ventricular contractility on the changes of average image intensity (AII) of the myocardial integrated backscatter (IB) and cyclic variation in IB (CVIB), 7 adult mongrel dogs were studied. The magnitude of AII and CVIB were measured from myocardial IB carves before and after dobatamine or propranolol infusion. Dobutamine or propranolol did not affect the magnitude of AII (13.8 +/- 0.7 vs 14.7 +/- 0.5, P > 0.05 or 14.3 +/- 0.5 vs 14.2 +/- 0.4, P > 0.05). However, dobutamine produced a significant increase in the magnitude of CVIB (6.8 +/- 0.3 vs 9.5 +/- 0.6, P < 0.001) and propranolol induced significant decrease in the magnitude of CVIB (7.1 +/- 0.2 vs 5.2 +/- 0.3, P < 0.001). The changes of the magnitude of AII and CVIB in the myocardium have been demonstrated to reflect different myocardial physiological and pathological changes respectively. The alteration of contractility did not affect the magnitude of AII but induced significant change in CVIB. The increase of left ventricular contractility resulted in a significant rise of the magnitude of CVIB and the decrease of left ventricular contractility resulted in a significant fall of the magnitude of CVIB.",

    "139": "Ventricular dilatation shortens action potential duration and increases the defibrillation threshold, whereas sotalol prolongs action potential duration and may decrease the defibrillation threshold. Whether these action potential changes remain after defibrillation shocks, and how they relate to defibrillation success, is not known. In this study, eight monophasic action potentials were recorded simultaneously during electrical defibrillation (shock strength: 20%-200% of the defibrillation threshold) in 16 normal and acutely dilated isolated rabbit hearts at baseline and after addition of sotalol (2 x 10-5 M). Post-shock action potential duration (PS-APD) and dispersion of PS-APD [Disp(PS-APD)] of monophasic action potentials were analyzed after 322 defibrillation shocks at different repolarization levels and related to defibrillation success. Acute ventricular dilatation shortened PS-APD, whereas sotalol prolonged PS-APD. Successful defibrillation was associated with lower Disp(PS-APD) at all repolarization levels in the normal and dilated heart at baseline and with sotalol (mean difference: 33%-46%, all P < 0.005). Minimal PS-APD was longer (mean difference: 5%-11%), while maximal PS-APD was shorter (mean difference: 2%-16%) after successful defibrillation shocks than after failing defibrillation shocks. Therefore, sotalol prolongs action potential duration after defibrillation shocks. Synchronization of repolarization, caused by both prolongation of short PS-APD and shortening of long PS-APD, is associated with successful defibrillation in the normal, acutely dilated, and sotalol-treated heart.", 
    "140": "Excessive levels of catecholamines have long been known to be cardiotoxic, but less well known are their toxic effects on skeletal muscle. By using an antimyosin monoclonal antibody and quantitative methods to measure the extent of myocyte necrosis, and by employing modulators of adrenoceptors (ARs), including clenbuterol, bupranolol, propranolol, bisoprolol, atenolol, ICI-118551, phenoxybenzamine, prazosin, and yohimbine, the involvement of ARs in isoproterenol-induced myotoxicity was characterized. In the myocardium, the toxic effects were predominantly mediated via the beta(1)-ARs. In the soleus muscle, it was almost solely via the beta(2)-ARs. Myotoxicity was also observed in the myocardium when challenged with the beta(2)-AR agonist clenbuterol. This was found to be mediated via sympathetic presynaptic beta(2)-ARs, leading to enhanced release of norepinephrine. This effect was abolished by prior treatment with reserpine. The skeletal muscle was found to be more sensitive to the myotoxic effects than cardiac muscle at lower doses of beta-AR agonists. These experiments introduce a new way of assaying beta-AR antagonists by classifying them according to their ability to prevent catecholamine-induced myotoxicity. Further research along these lines may deepen understanding of which beta-blockers work best in heart failure therapy.", 
    "141": "Celiprolol is a selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist with antihypertensive actions, which causes renal vasodilation by increasing tissue nitric oxide (NO) levels. The authors tested whether celiprolol increases coronary blood flow (CBF) by increasing cardiac NO release in the ischemic heart in vivo. In open-chest dogs, coronary perfusion pressure of the left anterior descending coronary artery was reduced so that CBF decreased to 60% of control levels, and thereafter, coronary perfusion pressure was maintained constant. Ten minutes after the reduction of coronary perfusion pressure, we infused celiprolol into the left anterior descending coronary artery and measured fractional shortening and lactate extraction ratio as indices of regional myocardial contractility and metabolism. CBF significantly increased from 51.5 mL/100 g/min +/- 1.9 to 67.0 mL/100 g/min +/- 5.1 20 minutes after celiprolol infusion without changes in coronary perfusion pressure, while fractional shortening and lactate extraction ratio increased. Celiprolol also increased cardiac NO release. The L omega-nitroarginine methyl ester, the inhibitor of NO synthase, attenuated the increases in CBF, fractional shortening, lactate extraction ratio, and cardiac NO release due to celiprolol. ICI 118551, a beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, did not blunt the effects of celiprolol and a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol, increased neither CBF nor cardiac NO release, indicating that the effect of celiprolol is independent of beta-adrenoceptor blockade. It was concluded that celiprolol mediates coronary vasodilation and improves myocardial ischemia through NO-dependent mechanisms.", 
    "142": "Recent experimental studies in chronic kidney disease have suggested that sympathicolytic drugs, similar to angiotensin II antagonism, limit renal fibrosis independent of blood pressure control. Using the model of acute and normotensive anti-thy1 glomerulonephritis, we analysed the action of beta-adrenergic blockade (as compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition) on renal overexpression of the profibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta.", 
    "143": "One day after induction of anti-thy1 glomerulonephritis, rats were given increasing doses of the beta-blockers metoprolol or nebivolol (0.1-fold, one-fold, 10-fold and 20-fold of the known blood pressure dose) until day 6 and the 20-fold dose until day 12. Additional animals were treated with a high dose of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril. At the end of each experiment, blood pressure and heart rate were recorded, glomerular matrix expansion was scored histologically, and protein expression of TGF-beta(1), fibronectin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 was determined in the supernatant of cultured glomeruli.", 
    "144": "Metoprolol and nebivolol reduced heart rate in a dose-dependent manner. Blood pressure was normal in untreated animals and not significantly affected by either treatment. Compared with untreated nephritic rats, TGF-beta(1) overexpression was not significantly changed by metoprolol or nebivolol in any dose or treatment period. In contrast, TGF-beta(1) levels were significantly reduced by enalapril both 6 and 12 days after disease induction (-52 and -63%, respectively). The changes in glomerular matrix score, fibronectin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 production closely followed expression of TGF-beta(1).", 
    "145": "In a model of acute and normotensive glomerular fibrosis, beta-adrenergic antagonism does not reduce TGF-beta overexpression, suggesting that its pressure-independent antifibrotic action may be limited to chronic renal diseases. The beneficial effect of angiotensin II inhibition even on acute matrix expansion may be a relevant mechanism as to the explanation of its superiority in treating fibrotic renal diseases.", 
    "146": "Previous investigations have shown that the major cellobiohydrolase of Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Cel7D (CBH 58), can be used to separate the enantiomers of a number of drugs, including adrenergic beta blockers such as propranolol. The structural basis of this enantioselectivity is explored here. A 1.5 A X-ray structure of the catalytic domain of Cel7D in complex with (R)-propranolol showed the ligand bound at the active site in glucosyl-binding subsites -1/+1. The catalytic residue Glu207 makes a strong charge-charge interaction with the secondary amine of (R)-propranolol; this is supported by a second interaction of the amine with the nearby Asp209. The aromatic naphthyl group stacks onto the indole ring of Trp373 (normally the glucosyl-binding platform of subsite +1). Other factors also contribute to good complementarity between the ligand and the substrate-binding cleft of the enzyme. Comparison with the previous structure of a related cellulase, Cel7A from Trichoderma reesei, in complex with (S)-propranolol strongly suggests that these enzymes will bind the (S)-enantiomer in a very similar manner, distinct from their mode of binding to (R)-propranolol. Tighter binding of both enzymes to the (S)-enantiomer is largely explained by two additional hydrogen-bonding interactions with its hydroxyl group. The distinct preference for the (R)-enantiomer is probably a consequence of structural differences near the naphthyl group of the ligand.",
