However, beta-blockers are known to suppress electroencephalographic activities. This study was carried out to assess the effect of metoprolol on anesthetic depth indicators. We also compared the effect of metoprolol in reducing propofol requirements.", 
    "1": "Ninety healthy adult patients undergoing peripheral nerve injury repair were enrolled in three groups to receive either: a tablet containing clonidine 200 microg, a tablet containing metoprolol tartrate 100 mg, or a placebo; 1 h prior to surgery. Standard anesthesia technique was followed. The bispectral index was monitored to guide propofol infusion and was maintained between 40 and 60. The total duration of anesthesia and surgery, and the total propofol consumption, were noted.", 
    "2": "Demographic variables were comparable in all three groups. Significantly less propofol was consumed by patients in the clonidine and metoprolol groups in comparison to that in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Heart rate and mean blood pressure values differed significantly in the placebo group in comparison to the values in the other two groups.", 
    "3": "Our study showed that, like clonidine, metoprolol attenuated the hemodynamic response to intraoperative stimuli and also had a sparing effect on the propofol dose requirement.", 
    "4": "The purpose of this study was to prepare and evaluate layered matrix tablets of propranolol HCl containing HPMC and phytowax as matrix component using direct compression technique. Layering with this polymeric matrix could prolong the release of drug and shift the release pattern approach to zero order as described from the least square curve fitting. Increasing the amount of coating layer could apparently prolong the drug release. The longer lag time of drug release from one planar apparently when the amount of coating layer was increased. HPMC concentration and compression force did not affect the drug release from this three-layer tablet. The drug release from this three-layer tablet was influenced by hydrodynamic force. An increase in stirring rate was a corresponding increasing in the release rate. From photoimage and SEM, gel mass of HPMC was increased with time during dissolution and covered the core surface, therefore dissolved drug molecules were allowed to diffuse out from the core through the polymer network of gel layer containing the porous structure. This suggested that HPMC and phytowax could be fabricated into the layered matrix tablet exhibiting sustained drug release.", 
    "5": "Athletes attempt to improve performance with drugs that act on the beta-adrenergic system directly or indirectly. Of three beta-adrenoceptor (AR) subtypes, the beta(2)-AR is the main target in sport; they have bronchodilator and anabolic actions and enhance anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids. Although demonstrable in animal experiments and humans, there is little evidence that these properties can significantly improve performance in trained athletes. Their actions may also be compromised by receptor desensitization and by common, naturally occurring receptor mutations (polymorphisms) that can influence receptor signalling and desensitization properties in individuals. Indirectly acting agents affect release and reuptake of noradrenaline and adrenaline, thereby influencing all AR subtypes including the three beta-ARs. These agents can have potent psychostimulant effects that provide an illusion of better performance that does not usually translate into improvement in practice. Amphetamines and cocaine also have considerable potential for cardiac damage. beta-AR antagonists (beta-blockers) are used in sports that require steadiness and accuracy, such as archery and shooting, where their ability to reduce heart rate and muscle tremor may improve performance. They have a deleterious effect in endurance sports because they reduce physical performance and maximum exercise load. Recent studies have identified that many beta-AR antagonists not only block the actions of agonists but also activate other (mitogen-activated PK) signalling pathways influencing cell growth and fate. The concept that many compounds previously regarded as 'blockers' may express their own spectrum of pharmacological properties has potentially far-reaching consequences for the use of drugs both therapeutically and illicitly.", 
    "6": "Autonomic tone has been suggested to be a significant determinant of ventricular repolarization duration with both rate dependent and independent effects. Using the His bundle-paced dog, a model that eliminates the need for QT correction factors, we explored the rate-independent effects of sympathetic and parasympathetic blockade on ventricular repolarization shortening following an excitatory stimulus. Six male His bundle-paced beagle dogs were paced at 80 bpm and fitted with jackets, surface ECG electrodes, and radiotelemeters. Dogs were given propranolol, atropine methyl nitrate, or the appropriate control in a four-period crossover design. Doses were based on literature reviews and unpublished pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling to provide efficacious beta- and parasympathetic blockade throughout the data collection period. Data collection began at 11 am and concluded at 11 am the following day, with event stimuli provided by investigators entering the room at 5 pm and at 7 am the following morning. One minute of ECG data were sampled every 15 min and these means were averaged to generate hourly means for the 24 hour data collection period. Treatment with atropine attenuated RT interval shortening when compared with the vehicle group at both the 5 pm and 7 am stimulus. In contrast, propranolol was not associated with significant effects on RT interval duration at either time point. These results suggest that parasympathetic withdrawal is the primary factor responsible during both awake hours (5 pm) and in the transition from deep sleep to the awake state (7 am) in the facilitation of RT interval shortening following an excitatory stimulus. The attenuation of RT interval shortening following atropine treatment may be a direct effect, or an indirect effect requiring an excited state to become evident. The use of a model that eliminates the need to apply correction factors to repolarization indices helps to clarify the role of the autonomic nervous system on ventricular repolarization.", 
    "7": "In this study the integrity of the recently developed phospholipid vesicle-based permeability barrier in the presence of a variety of co-solvents and tensides has been investigated. Also included are studies of the influence of these additives on drug permeation and the effect of pH changes on the permeability of ionogenic drug compounds. Permeability experiments using the hydrophilic model compound calcein together with polysorbate 80 (Tween 80), polyoxyl 35 castor oil (Cremophor EL), macrogol lauryl ether (Brij 35), sorbitan monolaurate (Span 20), polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400), ethanol and dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) were performed to determine whether the barriers were affected by the presence of these additives in the donor compartment. It was found that the integrity of the phospholipid vesicle-based barriers did not seem to be influenced by Span 20 up to a concentration of 5mg/ml, PEG 400 up to a concentration of 40mg/ml and ethanol and DMSO up to a concentration of 20mg/ml, respectively. Brij 35, Tween 80 and Cremophor EL were however found to be incompatible with the model at all concentrations as the barriers became leaky. Appearance of phospholipid in the donor chamber in presence of these three tensides indicated that the loss of integrity was due to partial dissolution of the phospholipid vesicles from the barrier. The permeability of testosterone was not significantly improved by the presence of the different co-solvents, except for 40 mg/ml PEG 400 and 20 mg/ml DMSO where the permeability was increased. In the pH study the permeability of metoprolol and naproxen was shown to decrease with increasing degree of ionisation according to the pH partition hypothesis. This renders the permeability model suitable for using pH-shift as a factor to influence solubility of drugs as well as to predict segmental absorption in the gastrointestinal tract.", 
    "8": "Tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy has been gradually recognized worldwide. However, medications for the prevention remain not to be investigated in part because the precise mechanism is unclear. We sought to examine medications before the onset of tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy, and to prove the limitation of these medications for the prevention.", 
    "9": "This study consisted of 21 patients with tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy who received one or more medications for hypertension or suspected angina pectoris. Each patient was assessed with history, medications, coronary angiography and left ventriculography. All patients but 1 were female, and age ranged 41 to 87 years (73+/-11 years). Twelve patients received calcium channel blockers, 7 patients received nitrates, and one patient received beta blocker. Three patients received angiotensin coverting enzyme inhibitors, and 4 patients received angiotensin II receptor blockers. One patient died of serious pneumonia, but there was no patient who died of tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy itself. During the 3 year follow-up, one patient receiving angiotensin receptor blocker had the recurrence of tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy due to recurrent epileptic seizure.",

    "11": "This study was conducted to determine the effects of carvedilol adjunct to standard treatment on left ventricular function (LVF), estimated as ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS) on echocardiography, in children with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). A secondary end point was to characterize the antioxidant potential of carvedilol.", 
    "12": "Hospitalized children aged <or=16 years with clinically stable DCM and advanced congestive heart failure (HF) with modified New York Heart Association Classification for Children (NYHAC) functional classes II to IV and EF <40% were enrolled in this prospective, 12-month, 2-center, open-label study. Oral carvedilol was added to a standard regimen of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, a diuretic, and digoxin in a dose-escalation design. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and modified NYHAC were assessed before (baseline) and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months of adjunct carvedilol treatment. EF and FS were analyzed before and at 6 and 12 months of carvedilol treatment. At each study visit, tolerability was assessed in terms of adverse events (AEs), treatment emergent signs and symptoms, physical examination including vital sign measurement (BP, HR, and body temperature), and laboratory analysis. Antioxidative enzyme activity was evaluated by measuring erythrocyte copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and glutathione reductase (GR) activity at baseline and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months of adjunct carvedilol treatment. For assessment of antioxidative enzyme activity, a control group comprised 29 age-matched healthy children.", 
    "13": "Twenty-one children (12 boys, 9 girls; age range, 7 months to 16 years; 100% white) completed the study. Four patients discontinued carvedilol at the beginning of the study due to severe arrhythmia which required amiodarone therapy (2 patients), bradycardia and hypotension (1), and bronchospasm (1). Carvedilol (0.4 mg/kg/d in children <or=62.5 kg or 25 mg/d in children >62.5 kg) was associated with significant decreases from baseline in systolic BP (130 [4] vs 123 [3] mm Hg; P<0.05), diastolic BP (85 [4] vs 77 [4] mm Hg; P<0.05), and HR (81 [4] vs 65 [4] bpm; P<0.001) after the first month of addition to standard therapy. At 6 months, there were significant improvements from baseline in EF (37.2% [2.4%] vs 50.2% [2.3%]; P<0.001) and FS (18.37% [2.00%] vs 23.58% [0.90%]; P<0.001). Modified NYHAC class was significantly improved in 80% of children (2.9 vs 2.3; P<0.001) at 12 months. The highest dose of carvedilol (0.8 mg/kg/d in children <or=62.5 kg or 50 mg/d in children >62.5 kg) was well tolerated in all 21 children. No serious AEs that necessitated study drug discontinuation (tiredness, headache, vomiting) were observed. At baseline, mean (SE) erythrocyte SOD activity (2781 [116] vs 2406 [102] U/g Hb; P<0.05) and GR activity (5.3 [0.3] vs 3.0 [0.2] micromol nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate [NADPH]/min/g Hb; P<0.001) were significantly higher in children with DCM who received standard therapy compared with healthy controls.CAT activity (12.7[0.9] vs 18.5 [1.0]U/g Hb; P<0.001) was significantly lower, while GSH-Px was unchanged. At 6 and 12 months of therapy, carvedilol plus standard treatment was associated with significant decreases from baseline in SOD (2516 [126] and 2550 [118], respectively, vs 2781 [116] U/g Hb; both, P<0.001) and GR (4.7 [0.3] and 4.1 [0.2], respectively, vs 5.3 [0.2] micromol NADPH/min/g Hb; P<0.05 and P<0.001) and increased CAT (16.9 [1.0] and 16.4 [0.7], respectively, vs 12.7 [0.9] U/g Hb; both, P<0.001).", 
    "14": "These pediatric patients with DCM treated for 12 months with carvedilol (up to 0.8 mg/kg/d in children <or=62.5 kg or 50 mg/d in children >62.5 kg) were found to have significant improvements in LVF and symptoms of HF. Twelve months of carvedilol therapy was associated with antioxidant enzyme activities near those observed in healthy children.", 
    "15": "Heart failure (HF) may be produced by sustained beta-adrenoceptor stimulation by causing changes in the expression of endothelin-1 (ET-1), the leptin system, calcineurin and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) underlying cardiac dysfunction. The aim of this study was to verify whether isoprenaline (ISO)-induced HF is attributed to changes in the above molecular markers, and whether the dual ET-receptor antagonist CPU0213 could reverse the cardiac dysfunction caused by ISO treatment, focusing on these molecular markers. HF was induced in rats by administration of ISO (2 mgkg(-1) s.c.) for 10 days. CPU0213 (30 mgkg(-1) s.c.) and propranolol (4 mgkg(-1) s.c.) were administered on days 7-10. HF developed after 10 days' ISO administration and was manifest as impaired cardiac performance, increased heart weight index, oxidative stress, elevated serum enzymes, and disordered expression of the endothelin system, leptin system, calcineurin and SERCA2a. All these abnormalities were significantly reversed by CPU0213, and the effectiveness of this ET-receptor antagonist was comparable to that of propranolol. Thus, antagonism of ET receptors by CPU0213 normalizes these changes in molecular markers, alleviating HF.", 
    "16": "Increasing evidence indicates that beta-cell apoptosis and impaired secretory function were partly mediated by interleukin (IL)-1beta and/or high-glucose-induced beta-cell production of IL-1beta. However, the specific signal transduction pathways and molecular events involved in beta-cell dysfunction remain largely unresolved. In this study, we investigated whether Ca(2+) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation plays a role for IL-1beta action in rat islets. Exposure of rat islets for 4 days to 33.3 mM glucose and 140 ng/ml IL-1beta- induced beta-cell apoptosis and impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. By Western blotting with phosphospecific antibodies, glucose and IL-1beta were shown to activate ERK. Ca(2+) channel blocker nimodipine or ERK inhibitor PD98059 prevented glucose- and IL-1beta-induced ERK activation, beta-cell apoptosis, and impaired function. Furthermore, treatment with Ca(2+) ionophore ionomycin, or exposure to thapsigargin, an inhibitor of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase, all caused an amplification of IL-1beta-induced ERK activation in rat islet. On the other hand, a chelator of intracellular free Ca(2+) [bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl] (BAPTA/AM) and an inhibitor of calmodulin (W7) diminished IL-1beta-induced phosphorylation of ERK. Finally, islet release of IL-1beta in response to high glucose could be abrogated by nimodipine, mibefradil, or PD98059. Together, these data suggest that glucose- and IL-1beta-induced beta-cell secretory dysfunction and apoptosis are Ca(2+) influx and ERK dependent in rat islets.", 
    "17": "Progress in understanding the neurobiology of stimulant dependence has enabled researchers to identify medications whose pharmacological effects suggest that they might help patients initiate abstinence or avoid relapse. Several of these medications and a vaccine have shown encouraging results in controlled clinical trials with cocaine-dependent patients. The search for a medical treatment for methamphetamine dependence started more recently, due to the later emergence of this epidemic, but at least one candidate medication has shown promise in early clinical testing. Treatment approaches that combine efficacious medications and empirically proven behavioral interventions, such as voucher-based reinforcement therapy, will almost certainly produce the best results.", 
    "18": "Although angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) therapy reduces proteinuria and retards the progression of renal injury in patients with glomerulonephritis, whether these drugs actually ameliorate pathological damages in human glomerulonephritis has not been determined. Fifteen patients with biopsy-proven mild-to-moderate mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (10 with immunoglobulin A [IgA] nephropathy and 5 with non-IgA mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis) received ARB monotherapy. In these patients, repeated renal biopsy was performed after a mean of 28.1 months, and pathological changes (including the mesangial matrix expansion ratio and interstitial fibrosis expansion ratio) were quantitatively examined using an image analyzer. Clinical markers were also evaluated, including the serum creatinine, serum IgA, creatinine clearance (Ccr), 24-h urinary protein excretion, urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), and blood pressure. ARB therapy significantly reduced urinary protein excretion (0.68+/-0.63 to 0.20+/-0.32 g/day, p=0.016) and the blood pressure (systolic: 133.3+/-18.2 to 123.4+/-10.5 mmHg, p=0.041; diastolic: 79.4+/-11.9 to 72.0+/-8.2 mmHg, p=0.038). Although the global glomerular sclerosis ratio was unchanged (6.3+/-8.5% to 10.7+/-16.1%, p=0.33), the mesangial matrix expansion ratio (33.1+/-10.8% to 22.7+/-7.8%, p=0.001) and the interstitial fibrosis ratio (19.9+/-5.8% to 13.8+/-4.4%, p=0.034) were significantly reduced by ARB treatment. The levels of pathological improvement were similar between patients with IgA nephropathy and those with non-IgA mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis. The results of the present study strongly suggest that ARB monotherapy can significantly reverse pathological changes, including mesangial matrix expansion and interstitial fibrosis, in human glomerulonephritis.", 
    "19": "Responses of on-center starburst amacrine cells to steady light stimuli were recorded in the dark-adapted mouse retina. The response to spots of dim white light appear to show two components, an initial peak that correspond to the onset of the light stimulus and a series of oscillations that ride on top of the initial peak relaxation. The frequency of oscillations during light stimulation was three time higher than the frequency of spontaneous oscillations recorded in the dark. The light-evoked responses in starburst cells were exclusively dependent on the release of glutamate likely from presynaptic bipolar axon terminals and the binding of glutamate to AMPA/kainate receptors because they were blocked by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxalene-2,3-dione. The synaptic pathway responsible for the light responses was blocked by AP4, an agonist of metabotropic glutamate receptors that hyperpolarize on-center bipolar cells on activation. Light responses were inhibited by the calcium channel blockers cadmium ions and nifedipine, suggesting that the release of glutamate was calcium dependent. The oscillatory component of the response was specifically inhibited by blocking the glutamate transporter with d-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartic acid, suggesting that glutamate reuptake is necessary for the oscillatory release. GABAergic antagonists bicuculline, SR 95531, and picrotoxin increased the amplitude of the initial peak while they inhibit the frequency of oscillations. TTX had a similar effect. Strychnine, the blocker of glycine receptors did not affect the initial peak but strongly decreased the oscillations frequency. These inhibitory inputs onto the bipolar axon terminals shape and synchronize the oscillatory component.",

    "21": "Fifteen patients with coronary artery disease performed paired peak cardiopulmonary and submaximal exercise tests on a cycle ergometer with and without atenolol treatment. Thirty minutes following the submaximal tests, participants pedaled 10 minutes at a workload corresponding to that of the anaerobic threshold attained. Arterial oxygen was defined from echocardiography and venous oxygen content.", 
    "22": "At rest, stroke volume, heart rate, and cardiac output were lower (P < .05), whereas arteriovenous oxygen difference [(a - v)O2] was higher with the use of atenolol (P < .05). At peak exercise, heart rate, lactate, and systolic blood pressure were lower (P < .05), whereas (a - v)O2 was higher (P < .05) with the use of atenolol. At anaerobic threshold, stroke volume, heart rate, cardiac output, and systolic blood pressure were lower (P < .05), whereas (a - v)O2 was higher (P < .05) with the use of atenolol. Absolute VO2 and workload during maximal (P = .67 and P = .49, respectively) and submaximal (P = .13 and P = .44, respectively) exercises were similar between conditions.", 
    "23": "Results demonstrate that atenolol treatment in patients with coronary artery disease does not alter VO2 and workload at the anaerobic threshold and peak exercise because of an increase in oxygen extraction and stroke volume in the face of reduced heart rate. These findings indicate that with long-term beta-adrenergic receptor blockade, there is interplay between oxygen delivery and extraction, suggesting a link between cardiac hemodynamic responses and skeletal muscle metabolic adaptations.",

    "29": "Fifty newly diagnosed patients with hypertension, who were in the prehypertension category according to the Joint National Committee seventh report, were enrolled in this blind, randomized, prospective study. After baseline clinical assessment, patients were randomly assigned to 4 mg daily dose of perindopril (group I, n=27, 18 male, median age=35 years) or 100 mg daily dose of metoprolol succinate (group II, n=28, 16 male, median age=33 years) for 6 months.

In contrast, the posttreatment aortic stiffness indexes of both groups were significantly lower compared with those of pretreatment period. No statistical difference was found between pretreatment and posttreatment aortic elasticity parameters of both groups. Importantly, no statistically significant difference was found between the percentage change from baseline of metoprolol and perindopril groups regarding aortic elasticity parameters (aortic distensibility: 38.1 vs. 37.9%, respectively, P=0.86; aortic strain: 37.7 vs. 37.9%, respectively, P=0.44; stiffness index: -20.0 vs. -23.9%).",

    "32": "This report describes the normalization of left ventricular ejection fraction and resolution of signs and symptoms of chronic and severe heart failure in both male and female patients (mean age 54 years) treated with standard medical therapy. These observations were made in 11 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy treated in a single cardiology practice, who had evidence of myocardial \"viability\" (dysfunctional but noncontractile myocardium that has the potential for improvement in function) as assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, low-dose dobutamine echocardiography, or nuclear imaging. These patients were treated with standard available therapies including beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin, and potassium and non-potassium-sparing diuretics. The average ejection fraction at presentation was 17% +/- 9% which improved to 59% +/- 5%. All patients improved to New York Heart Association functional class I with available therapy. The majority of patients received micronutrient supplementation with coenzyme Q10, vitamin B1, and amino acids, which target the pathways of cardiac metabolism and may aid in the restoration of cardiac function. This case series demonstrates that normalization of cardiac function is possible with standard therapy and the importance of assessing myocardial viability in all patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. Given the unique metabolic needs of the failing heart, the role of micronutrients in combination with standard therapy warrants further investigation.",

    "34": "The effect of two varieties of grapefruit juice (white and ruby red) and its selected components (naringin, naringenin, and bergamottin) was investigated on the activity of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Talinolol, a nonmetabolized P-gp substrate, was used as a marker compound. The white grapefruit juice (GFJ) had a minor effect on talinolol pharmacokinetics, but the ruby red GFJ reduced the C max and the AUC (0-infinity) by 60% and 50% of the control, respectively. However, among the GFJ constituents tested, bergamottin (0.22 mg/kg) was the most potent component augmenting the C max and the AUC (0-infinity) of talinolol by 2.4- and 1.8-fold, respectively, if compared to the control group. The flavonoids naringenin (0.7 mg/kg) and naringin (2.4 and 9.4 mg/kg) had a similar effect increasing the talinolol C max and AUC (0-infinity) by 1.5- to 1.8-fold, respectively. In conclusion, the effect of GFJ on P-gp activity seems to depend on the variety, the concentration of compounds in the juice, and the composition of different ingredients.", 
    "35": "Perioperative beta blockade or the use of alpha2 agonists remains a contentious and controversial area of perioperative medicine. Although there is no question that the liberal use of beta blockers (or alpha2 agonists) to prevent or reduce overt signs of sympathetic overactivity, particularly at known periods of stress (e.g. induction, incision, emergence, etc) is an important and routine part of the management of high risk patients, there remains considerable controversy in the literature regarding the efficacy of either short or long-term regimens on cardiac morbidity or long-term outcomes, particularly in those patients not previously receiving medication for known coronary artery disease or hypertension. The role of strict heart rate control (and its safety with regards to hypotension and possibly congestive heart failure) versus intermittent fixed dosing of beta blockers is particularly contentious. We consider the latest literature on this topic and identify areas of agreement and contention and present the latest recommendations of the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Perioperative Guidelines Group.",

The rise in phospho-rpS6 intensity was localised to a subpopulation of beta cells with low insulin content. This activation of translational factors and the associated elevation of insulin synthesis were completely blocked by the calcium channel blocker verapamil and partially blocked by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor rapamycin, the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor Rp-8-Br-cAMPs and the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor U0126; a combination of inhibitors exhibited additive effects.",

At peak, echocardiographic signs of ischaemia occurred in 44%, and significant DLVOTO in 5% (13 patients). By multivariate analysis, it was found that independent predictors of significant DLVOTO at peak were chordal SAM at peak, smaller left ventricle at end-systole, higher systolic blood pressure at peak, younger age and increased septal wall thickness.

    "62": "Trace amine-associated receptors, a novel class of G-protein coupled receptors which respond to trace amines but not to classical biogenic amines, have been found to be expressed in heart. Therefore, we investigated the cardiac effects of the trace amines p-tyramine, beta-phenylethylamine, octopamine, and tryptamine. Isolated rat hearts were perfused in the presence of trace amines, monitoring the hemodynamic variables. In addition, radioligand binding experiments with [3H]-p-tyramine and [125I]-3-iodothyronamine were performed in rat ventricular tissue. Octopamine, beta-phenylethylamine, and tryptamine produced a dose-dependent negative inotropic effect as shown by reduced cardiac output (IC(50)=109 microM, 159 microM, and 242 microM, respectively). In the same preparation a similar effect was produced by thyronamine and 3-iodothyronamine, with IC(50)=94 microM and 27 microM, respectively. The negative inotropic effect of octopamine was confirmed in a papillary muscle preparation. All trace amines except tryptamine increased the heart rate, but this action could be attributed to their sympathomimetic properties, since it was abolished by propranolol. The negative inotropic effect of trace amines was significantly increased by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. Specific and saturable binding of [(3)H]-p-tyramine and [125I]-3-iodothyronamine was observed in ventricular tissue. While [3H]-p-tyramine was displaced by 3-iodothyronamine, [(125)I]-3-iodothyronamine was not displaced by p-tyramine. In conclusion, trace amines and thyronamines are negative inotropic agents. Their effect appears to be mediated by a subtype of trace amine-associated receptor which is characterized by the rank of potency: 3-iodothyronamine > thyronamine = octopamine = beta-phenylethylamine, while tryptamine and p-tyramine are significantly less active.", 
    "63": "Recent research has revealed that propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, causes extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade activation, nuclear translocation of phospho-ERK and increased transcriptional activity in cultured cell lines. Given the importance of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in the treatment of heart failure, we evaluated the capability of propranolol of promoting the ERK-dependent gene expression at the cardiomyocyte level. To this end, the gene expression of the early growth response factor 1 (Egr1), a well-recognized indicator of nuclear extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activation, was assessed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR in vivo as well as in vitro experiments. Propranolol, administered at the dose of 10 mg/kg/day in C57BL/6 mice, caused a approximately 19-fold increase of Egr1 mRNA expression in left ventricular myocardium along with a approximately 2.1-fold increase of Egr1 protein expression. Isoproterenol, a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor agonist, also increased Egr1 mRNA and protein expression but to a lesser degree. Remarkably, isoproterenol administration was associated with the development of cardiac hypertrophy, whereas propranolol-treated mice showed a completely normal cardiac morphology. The effect of propranolol on Egr1 mRNA expression was abrogated in mice lacking beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors indicating that propranolol increases Egr1 mRNA expression in a beta-adrenoceptor-dependent manner. The role of beta-adrenoceptors was further confirmed by showing that propranolol was able to increase Egr1 mRNA and protein levels in cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes. Collectively, these results indicate that propranolol promotes Egr1 gene expression in cardiomyocytes via beta-adrenoceptors with a mechanism which is independent of its ability to antagonize the effects of catecholamines. It is also suggested that cardiomyocyte growth and Egr1 gene overexpression are not obligate processes.", 
    "64": "Nebivolol is a racemic combination of d-nebivolol (+SRRR nebivolol) and l-nebivolol (-RSSS nebivolol) that differs chemically from other beta-blockers, with an absolutely symmetrical configuration developing from a central nitrogen atom. D-nebivolol and l-nebivolol divaricate pharmacologically and therapeutically, with a noticeably different profile from that of conventional beta-blockers; for instance, the selective blocking of beta(1)-adrenoceptors is determined almost exclusively by d-nebivolol. Both enantiomers act synergistically with respect to blood pressure reduction: the effect of nebivolol on heart rate is exclusively exerted by d-nebivolol, with these hypotensive effects enhanced by the addition of the l-enantiomer, which in itself does not influence systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Furthermore, this pronounced and lasting blood pressure reduction is roughly equal to the effect of conventional beta-blockers in high doses. In certain vascular districts, nebivolol stimulates endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, thereby increasing the availability of NO in the endothelium, smooth muscle, and platelets and, consequently, producing a sustained vasodilation, with decreases in peripheral resistance and blood pressure. These effects are not shared by other beta-adrenoceptor blockers used as references and mainly rely on the l-enantiomer. L-nebivolol also increases NO availability under conditions of oxidative stress by the inhibition of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) uncoupling, thereby reducing NO inactivation. Furthermore, neither nebivolol nor its enantiomers show any intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and undesirable beta-blocker effects, such as a decrease in cardiac output, which do not occur or are less pronounced with the combination of d-nebivolol and l-nebivolol. In conclusion, the independent pharmacologic and clinical effects of d-nebivolol and l-nebivolol act synergistically to produce a cardiovascular profile that differs noticeably from that of conventional beta-blockers.", 
    "65": "Certain migraines are labeled as refractory, but the entity lacks a well-accepted operational definition. This article summarizes the results of a survey sent to American Headache Society members to evaluate interest in a definition for RM and what were considered necessary criteria. Review of the literature, collaborative discussions and results of the survey contributed to the proposed definition for RM. We also comment on our considerations in formulating the criteria and any issues in making the criteria operational. For the proposed definition for RM and refractory chronic migraine, patients must meet the International Classification of Headache Disorders, Second Edition criteria for migraine or chronic migraine, respectively. Headaches need to cause significant interference with function or quality of life despite modification of triggers, lifestyle factors, and adequate trials of acute and preventive medicines with established efficacy. The definition requires that patients fail adequate trials of preventive medicines, alone or in combination, from at least 2 of 4 drug classes including: beta-blockers, anticonvulsants, tricyclics, and calcium channel blockers. Patients must also fail adequate trials of abortive medicines, including both a triptan and dihydroergotamine (DHE) intranasal or injectable formulation and either nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or combination analgesic, unless contraindicated. An adequate trial is defined as a period of time during which an appropriate dose of medication is administered, typically at least 2 months at optimal or maximum-tolerated dose, unless terminated early due to adverse effects. The definition also employs modifiers for the presence or absence of medication overuse, and with or without significant disability.",

Beta blockers, calcium antagonists, and neuromodulators are available for preventive migraine therapy. Nonpharmacologic treatment also plays an important role in migraine prevention. New medical care structures such as integrated headache care provide better support for patients with migraine, particularly those with chronic migraine.", 
    "67": "Presynaptic blockade of cutaneous vasoconstrictor nerves (VCN) abolishes the axon reflex (AR) during slow local heating (SLH) and reduces the vasodilator response. In a two-part study, forearm sites were instrumented with microdialysis fibers, local heaters, and laser-Doppler flow probes. Sites were locally heated from 33 to 40 degrees C over 70 min. In part 1, we tested whether this effect of VCN acted via nitric oxide synthase (NOS). In five subjects, treatments were as follows: 1) untreated; 2) bretylium, preventing neurotransmitter release; 3) N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) to inhibit NOS; and 4) combined bretylium + L-NAME. At treated sites, the AR was absent, and there was an attenuation of the ultimate vasodilation (P < 0.05), which was not different among those sites (P > 0.05). In part 2, we tested whether norepinephrine and/or neuropeptide Y is involved in the cutaneous vasodilator response to SLH. In seven subjects, treatments were as follows: 1) untreated; 2) propranolol and yohimbine to antagonize alpha- and beta-receptors; 3) BIBP-3226 to antagonize Y(1) receptors; and 4) combined propranolol + yohimbine + BIBP-3226. Treatment with propranolol + yohimbine or BIBP-3226 significantly increased the temperature at which AR occurred (n = 4) or abolished it (n = 3). The combination treatment consistently eliminated it. Importantly, ultimate vasodilation with SLH at the treated sites was significantly (P < 0.05) less than at the control. These data suggest that norepinephrine and neuropeptide Y are important in the initiation of the AR and for achieving a complete vasodilator response. Since VCN and NOS blockade in combination do not have an inhibition greater than either alone, these data suggest that VCN promote heat-induced vasodilation via a nitric oxide-dependent mechanism.",

    "72": "Desorption electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (DESI-MS/MS) and whole-body autoradiography (WBA) were used for chemical imaging of whole-body thin tissue sections of mice intravenously dosed with propranolol (7.5 mg/kg). DESI-MS/MS imaging utilized selected reaction monitoring detection performed on an AB/MDS SCIEX 4000 QTRAP mass spectrometer equipped with a prototype extended length particle discriminator interface. Propranolol images of the tissue sections using DESI-MS/MS were obtained at surface scan rates of 0.1, 0.5, 2, and 7 mm/s. Although signal decreased with increasing scan rate, useful whole-body images for propranolol were obtained from the tissues even at 7 mm/s, which required just 79 min of analysis time. Attempts to detect and image the distribution of the known propranolol metabolites were unsuccessful. Regions of the tissue sections showing the most radioactivity from WBA sections were excised and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with radiochemical detection to determine relative levels of propranolol and metabolites present. Comparison of the DESI-MS/MS signal for propranolol and the radioactivity attributed to propranolol from WBA sections indicated nominal agreement between the two techniques for the amount of propranolol in the brain, lung, and liver. Data from the kidney showed an unexplained disparity between the two techniques. The results of this study show the feasibility of using DESI-MS/MS to obtain useful chemical images of a drug in whole-body thin tissue sections following drug administration at a pharmacologically relevant level. Further optimization to improve sensitivity and enable detection of the drug metabolites will be among the requirements necessary to move DESI-MS/MS chemical imaging forward as a practical tool in drug discovery.", 
    "73": "The present study investigates the effects of ethanol and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) on the barrier function and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) release in differentiated Caco-2 cells. Epithelial barrier integrity was estimated by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), the transport of reference compounds and lactate dehydrogenase leakage, the PGE(2) release by enzyme immunoassay. Ethanol and H(2)O(2) decreased TEER and increased the transport of lucifer yellow without affecting that of propranolol and phenylalanine. Only the effects of ethanol were accompanied by PGE(2) production and were reversible without causing long-term cytotoxicity. The cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, NS-398, prevented the effect of ethanol on both PGE(2) release and TEER, while inhibition of both cyclooxygenase-2 and tyrosine kinase drastically compromised cell viability and TEER recovery. Hepatocyte growth factor, keratinocyte growth factor or insulin prevented the effect of ethanol on cell permeability, but not on PGE(2) release. Their combination prevented the effect of H(2)O(2). In conclusion, ethanol and H(2)O(2) increased paracellular permeability in differentiated Caco-2 cells without affecting transcellular and active transport. Cyclooxygenase-2 stimulated PGE(2) release mediated the reversible effect of ethanol on tight junctions and, meanwhile, contributed to cell survival. Growth factors, normally present in the intestine, exerted a selective protective effect toward paracellular permeability increase induced by irritants.",

    "125": "Reverse osmosis (RO) concentrate samples were obtained from a RO-membrane system that uses effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) as feed water for the production of drinking water. A number of different pharmaceuticals (e.g. antibiotics, contrast media, beta blockers) were found in the WWTP effluent as well as in the RO-concentrate. Overall, a concentration factor (feed:concentrate) of approximately 3-4 was measured. Beta blockers (acebutolol, atenolol, bisoprolol, celiprolol, metoprolol, propranolol, timolol) were found in the range of low ng/L to low microg/L. Because metoprolol and propranolol are classified as potentially toxic to aquatic organisms and all beta blocker molecules have moieties, which are reactive towards ozone (amine groups, activated aromatic rings), it was tested whether ozonation can be applied for their mitigation. Rate constants for the reaction of acebutolol, atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol with ozone and OH radicals were determined. At pH 7 acebutolol, atenolol and metoprolol react with ozone with an apparent second-order rate constant k(O)(3) of about 2,000 M(-1)s(-1), whereas propranolol reacts with approximately 10(5)M(-1)s(-1). The rate constants for the reaction of the selected compounds with OH radicals were determined to be 0.5-1.0 x 10(10)M(-1)s(-1). Experiments with RO concentrate showed that an ozone dose of only 5mg/L resulted in a quantitative removal of propranolol in 0.8s and 10mg O(3)/L oxidized 70% of metoprolol in only 1.2s. Tests with chlorinated and non-chlorinated WWTP effluent showed an increase of ozone stability but a decrease of hydroxyl radical exposure in the samples after chlorination. This may shift the oxidation processes towards direct ozone reactions and favor the degradation of compounds with high k(O)(3).",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of cardiac rehabilitative exercise training on prognostic variables derived from the exercise tolerance test and whether these changes had an effect on predicted cardiovascular and all-cause mortality using externally validated risk scores. Two hundred ten consecutive patients who completed a 12-week cardiac rehabilitation program were analyzed. Peak MET level, heart rate recovery, chronotropic index, Duke prognostic score, and Cleveland Clinic Foundation risk score obtained at program entry and exit were compared. All prognostic variables and risk score-derived predicted 5-year mortality rates improved significantly after cardiac rehabilitation. Exercise capacity increased by 32% (6.6 +/- 2.7 to 8.7 +/- 2.9 METS; p <0.0001), heart rate recovery increased by 20% (15 +/- 9 to 18 +/- 10 beats/min; p <0.0001), and chronotropic index increased by 11% (56 +/- 22% to 62 +/- 22%; p <0.0001).

These improvements remained significant in high-risk subgroups. When controlled for age, gender, diabetes, MET level achieved, ejection fraction, and beta-blocker use, changes remained significant (p <0.0001) for each outcome measure. In conclusion, exercise training in supervised cardiac rehabilitation programs significantly improved exercise capacity, measures of chronotropic dynamics, and prognostic risk scores.

    "129": "Cav2.2 channels play a critical role in pain signaling by controlling synaptic transmission between dorsal root ganglion neurons and dorsal horn neurons. The Cav2.2-selective peptide blocker ziconotide (Prialt, Elan Pharmaceuticals, Dublin, Ireland) has proven efficacious in pain relief, but has a poor therapeutic index and requires intrathecal administration. This has provided impetus for finding an orally active, state-dependent Cav2.2 inhibitor with an improved safety profile. Members of the Cav2 subfamily of calcium channels are the main contributors to central and peripheral synaptic transmission, but the pharmacological effects of blocking each subtype is not yet defined. Here we describe a high-throughput fluorescent assay using a fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR [Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA]) designed to quickly evaluate the state dependence and selectivity of inhibitors across the Cav2 subfamily. Stable cell lines expressing functional Cav2 channels (Ca(V)alpha, beta(3), and alpha(2)delta subunits) were co-transfected with an inward rectifier (Kir2.3) so that membrane potential, and therefore channel state, could be controlled by external potassium concentration. Following cell incubation in drug with varying concentrations of potassium, a high potassium trigger was added to elicit calcium influx through available, unblocked channels. State-dependent inhibitors that preferentially bind to channels in the open or inactivated state can be identified by their increased potency at higher potassium concentrations, where cells are depolarized and channels are biased towards these states. Although the Cav2 channel subtypes differ in their voltage dependence of inactivation, by adjusting pre-trigger potassium concentrations, the degree of steady-state inactivation can be more closely matched across Cav2 subtypes to assess molecular selectivity.", 
    "130": "The interaction of the amine containing beta-receptor blocking agent propranolol (Ppn) with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) vesicles was studied. Using a centrifugation assay, the protonated as well as unprotonated amount of the drug sorbed was verified, whereas the binding of the protonated Ppn was deduced from the surface charge density of the vesicles as calculated from electrophoretic mobility measurements. Assuming a 1:1 binding, a Langmuir model with only two parameters was found to be sufficient to fit all experimental data. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the estimated values of these parameters were reliable and independent from each other. These parameters were truly intrinsic, as electrostatic interactions were accounted for in the model. It was found that the pKa of Ppn shifted from 9.24, when dissolved in water, downward by 1.34 units upon sorption, indicating that the intrinsic partition coefficient of the unprotonated Ppn was about 22 times higher than that of the protonated analog. In addition, a significant increase in the affinity of both Ppn analogs with increasing salt concentration was found. Theoretical analysis revealed that the Langmuir sorption model may be considered as a partitioning model with decreasing partition coefficient as the sorbed amount increases. Thus, the Langmuir model provides a better fit than a simple partition model at conditions that induce a substantial amount of propranolol sorbed, such as high pH and high propranolol concentrations.", 
    "131": "Women with functional ovaries have a lower cardiovascular risk than men and postmenopausal women. However, oestrogen replacement therapy remains controversial. This study examined the effect of ovarian hormone deficiency and oestrogen replacement on ventricular myocyte contractile function and expression of beta-adrenoceptors (beta-ARs). Female Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to bilateral ovariectomy (OVX) or sham operation (Sham). A subgroup of OVX rats received oestrogen (E2) replacement (40 microg kg(-1) day(-1)) for 4 weeks. Cardiomyocyte shortening was evaluated in basal conditions and in the presence of isoprenaline (ISO). The expression of beta-ARs was assessed by Western blotting. The presence of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the coronary effluent was determined. Ovariectomy promoted body weight gain associated with reduced serum E2 and uterine weight, all of which were abolished by treatment with E2. Ovariectomy increased the amplitude of both basal and ISO-stimulated contractions, increased LDH release, upregulated beta1-AR expression and downregulated beta2-AR expression, all of which were restored by treatment with E2. A beta1-AR antagonist, CGP20712A, but not a beta2-AR antagonist, ICI118,551, significantly decreased the amplitude of ventricular myocyte shortening. Oestrogen decreased cardiomyocyte contraction and the expression of beta1-AR, and increased expression of beta2-AR, and all these effects were abolished by the E2 receptor antagonist, ICI182,780. These data suggest that oestrogen plays a cardioprotective role in female rat hearts subjected to ischaemia-reperfusion injury, and the effects of oestrogen are associated with decreased cardiomyocyte contraction and expression of beta1-AR, and increased expression of beta2-AR.", 
    "132": "Elevation of proinflammatory cytokines in the brain have potent effects on altering physiological, behavioral, and cognitive processes. The mechanism(s) by which brain cytokines are induced during a peripheral immune challenge remains unclear since microorganisms/cytokines do not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Recent studies indicate that central beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-ADRs) may mediate brain interleukin-1beta (IL-1) production. This has direct implications for the production of brain cytokines during a peripheral immune response since peripheral pathogens and cytokines rapidly stimulate brainstem catecholamine neurons via peripheral nerves and circumventricular pathways. Studies here examine the role of central beta-ADRs in regulating brain cytokine production following peripheral Escherichia coli (E. coli) challenge. Rats were centrally administered propranolol (beta-ADR antagonist) or vehicle followed by peripheral E. coli or saline and sacrificed 6h later for measurement of cytokines. Pre-treatment with propranolol completely blocked the induction of brain IL-1 following E. coli. Surprisingly, central propranolol also attenuated E. coli-induced peripheral cytokines. To examine whether the attenuated peripheral cytokine response following central propranolol administration was due leakage of propranolol into the general circulation and blockade of peripheral beta-blockade, nadolol (beta-ADR antagonist that does not cross the BBB) was administered peripherally prior to E. coli. Nadolol administration did not block central cytokine production following E. coli, but instead enhanced both peripheral and central proinflammatory cytokine production. Furthermore, central administration of isoproterenol (beta-ADR agonist) results in a time-dependent increase in brain IL-1 production. These data demonstrate central beta-ADRs may play a critical role to induce brain IL-1, while peripheral beta-ADRs inhibit cytokine response to bacterial challenge.",

Several cyclodextrins (CDs) and cyclodextrin derivatives were examined as chiral selectors applying complete filling technique (CFT) accompanied with the partial filling technique PFT of (SCX[n]) as achiral modifier. Only with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD) chiral separation could be achieved. The effect of the organic modifier on these chiral separations was examined. The results indicate that at pH 4.65, the use of HP-beta-CD (CFT) alone could not initiate chiral separations of both analytes and these chiral separations could be induced using HP-beta-CD (CFT) followed by SCX[n]/HP-beta-CD (PFT).", 
    "140": "Ventricular tachycardia in heart failure (HF) can initiate by nonreentrant mechanisms such as delayed afterdepolarizations. In an arrhythmogenic rabbit model of HF, we have shown that isoproterenol induces ventricular tachycardia in vivo and aftercontractions and transient inward currents in HF myocytes. To determine whether beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)-AR) stimulation contributes, we performed in vivo drug infusion, in vitro myocyte and biochemical studies. Intravenous zinterol (2.5 microg/kg) led to ventricular arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia up to 13 beats long in 4 of 6 HF rabbits (versus 0 of 5 controls, P<0.01), an effect blocked by beta(2)-AR antagonist ICI-118,551 (0.2 mg/kg). In field-stimulated myocytes (0.5 to 4 Hz, 37 degrees C), beta(2)-AR stimulation (1 micromol/L zinterol+300 nmol/L beta(1)-AR antagonist CGP-29712A) induced aftercontractions and Ca aftertransients in 88% of HF versus 0% of control myocytes (P<0.01). beta(2)-AR stimulation in HF (but not control) myocytes increased Ca transient amplitude (by 29%), sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca load (by 28%), the rate of [Ca](i) decline (by 28%; n=12, all P<0.05), and phospholamban phosphorylation at Ser16, but Ca current was unchanged. All of these effects in HF myocytes were blocked by ICI-118,551 (100 nmol/L). Although total beta-AR expression was reduced by 47% in HF rabbit left ventricle, beta(2)-AR number was unchanged, indicating more potent beta(2)-AR-dependent SR Ca uptake and arrhythmogenesis in HF. Human HF myocytes showed similar beta(2)-AR-induced aftercontractions, aftertransients, and enhanced Ca transient amplitude, SR Ca load and twitch [Ca](i) decline rate. Thus, beta(2)-AR stimulation is arrhythmogenic in HF, mediated by SR Ca overload-induced spontaneous SR Ca release and aftercontractions.",

Treatment for mild-to-moderate hypertension during pregnancy may not reduce maternal or fetal risk. Severe hypertension, on the other hand, should be treated to decrease maternal risk. Methyldopa and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists have been used most extensively. In acute severe hypertension, intravenous labetalol or oral nifedipine are reasonable choices.",

    "146": "It is estimated that 2.2 million people have glaucoma in the US and 67 million people worldwide. The majority of cases are associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and decreasing IOP eliminates or greatly reduces degeneration in most cases, including cases in which the IOP is in the normal range but optic neuropathy occurs. Timolol maleate has the longest record of safety and efficacy to lower IOP and is administered via eye drops one or more times per day. Unfortunately, compliance is poor across patient populations leading to degeneration. Patients typically see their ophthalmologist once every 3-4 months. If one could administer a long-acting treatment while in the doctor's office, one might overcome the compliance issue and effectively preserve sight. The critical step is to develop a formulation for timolol maleate that leads to sustained delivery for greater than 90 days and would permit a different treatment paradigm, namely subconjunctival administration once every 3-4 months. By using a 50 : 50 blend of PLGA 502H and PLA, this study was able to fabricate microspheres that delivered timolol maleate continually over 107 days, well within the time frame needed to make subconjunctival administration feasible and permit a new approach to treating glaucoma and diseases of the eye more broadly.",

Posttransplantation anemia was defined as mean hemoglobin <11 g/dl after 3 mo after transplantation. Data on demographics, pretransplantation dialysis, previous transplant history, pretransplantation hemoglobin, degree of HLA mismatch, and donor characteristics were collected. Some of the posttransplantation data that were collected in addition to the hemoglobin included delayed graft function; diabetes; hypertension; induction and maintenance of immunosuppressive regimen; posttransplantation infections; and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, statins, aspirin, and beta blockers.

A computed tomographic scan of the brain showed a right frontoparietal hematoma, and her blood pressure was 185/115 mm Hg. She was admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery, and an external drain was inserted to evacuate the hematoma. She was then referred to the Department of Clinical Sciences, where a search for possible secondary causes of hypertension was undertaken. Substantially elevated urinary levels of vanillylmandelic acid and metanephrines were found, and a pheochromocytoma was suspected. Abdominal computed tomographic scans revealed a large retroperitoneal mass (3.6 by 4 cm) and similar smaller lesions in the right adrenal gland, between the aorta and the vena cava, and in the left paraaortic area. Iodine I 123 metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy showed high uptake in those same areas, consistent with the diagnosis of multiple catecholamine-secreting paragangliomas. After adequate control of the patient's hypertension was achieved with an alpha1-adrenergic receptor blocker, a Ca2+ antagonist, and a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, the tumors were excised in the Department of Surgery. The histopathologic findings confirmed the diagnosis of multiple paragangliomas. The genetic analysis demonstrated an exon 4 mutation in codon 109 (CAA>TAA, Gln>Stop) of the SDHD gene.",

    "163": "The effects of adrenaline (A) and noradrenaline (NA) on vasopressin (VP) secretion were studied in 13-14-day cultures of isolated rat neurohypophyseal (NH) tissue. The VP contents of the supernatant media were determined by radioimmunoassay after a 1 or 2-h incubation. Significantly increased VP levels were detected in the tissue culture media following the administration of A (an alpha+beta(2)-receptor agonist), depending on the dose of A. The VP secretion elevation was totally blocked by the previous administration of phentolamine (an alpha(1)+alpha(2)-receptor antagonist) or corynanthine (an alpha(1)-receptor antagonist). Yohimbine (an alpha(2)-receptor antagonist) did not influence the VP secretion increase induced by A. After the administration of NA (a beta+alpha(1)-receptor agonist), a VP secretion elevation was again detected, but the degree of enhancement proved smaller than that of the VP secretion increase induced by A. Propranolol (a beta(1)+beta(2)-receptor antagonist) before NA administration prevented the VP secretion increase. Atenolol (a beta(1)-receptor antagonist) did not block the VP secretion elevation induced by NA. Corynanthine (an alpha(1)-receptor antagonist) treatment before NA administration reduced the NA-induced VP enhancement, because NA has an alpha(1)-receptor agonist character in addition to its main character (a beta-receptor agonist). Surprisingly, the administration of pindolol (a beta(1)+beta(2)-receptor antagonist) enhanced VP secretion. This contradictory effect can be explained in that pindolol not only acts as a blocker, but also exerts \"intrinsic sympathomimetic action\" and a strong adrenergic agonist effect. Pindolol before NA administration significantly increased the NA-induced VP elevation.", 
    "164": "Mainly the alpha(1)- and beta(2)-adrenergic receptors are involved in the A- or NA-induced increase of VP secretion in isolated NH tissue cultures. The results indicate that VP release is influenced directly by the adrenergic system, and the adrenergic control of VP secretion from the NH tissue in rats can occur at the level of the posterior pituitary.",

Until more long-term data are available, nonselective beta-blockers should be the first treatment option because of less severe side effects. EBL is an alternative when beta-blockers are contraindicated or not tolerated. Patient preference may also be considered. For prevention of rebleeding, nonselective beta-blockers (preferably in association with isosorbide-5-mononitrate) or EBL are both effective and good alternative treatments.

Mixed breed dogs (n=7) were anesthetized and their respiration was controlled. A 3.5-Fr micromanometer-tipped catheter was placed into the left ventricle. Dobutamine (5.0 or 10 microg/kg/min) or esmolol (100 or 500 microg/kg/min) was administered via the cephalic vein. The transmitral flow (TMF) and pulmonary venous flow (PVF) were recorded using transthoracic echocardiography from the apical long-axis view. The heart rate, systolic LV pressure, +dP/dt, and -dP/dt were significantly elevated by dobutamine, but significantly reduced by esmolol. Dobutamine significantly decreased tau, whereas esmolol significantly increased tau. The TMF-derived E and PVF-derived D wave velocities increased significantly with dobutamine, but decreased significantly with esmolol. A significant correlation was detected between the E and D wave velocities (r=0.92). Consequently, the E/D ratio was decreased significantly with dobutamine, and increased significantly with esmolol. Furthermore, the E/D ratio was significantly correlated with -dP/dt (r= -0.64) and tau (r=0.84). Our results suggest that the E/D ratio reflects LV relaxation, and may potentially provide further information on LV relaxation.",

RPE were estimated during the last minute of each workload. The zone of normality was established as the 95% confidence interval spanning the average line when RPE was regressed against MET. 51 women (66.6 +/- 9.3 yr.) with coronary artery disease completed a symptom-limited treadmill test. 31 of the women with coronary artery disease were taking beta blockers. RPE were compared to the RPE/MET relation of the zone. 57% of the women with coronary artery disease estimated RPE above the zone during the treadmill test. RPE responses above the zone of normality indicate an elevated perceptual strain for a given energy expenditure (i.e., MET). The zone of normality might be used as an aid in discriminating between normal and abnormal RPE responses during graded treadmill tests by women with coronary artery disease.", 
    "178": "The release of propranolol hydrochloride from matrix tablets with hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC K15M) or KollidonSR at different concentrations was investigated with a view to developing twice daily sustained release dosage form. A hydrophilic matrix-based tablet using different concentrations of HPMC K15M or KollidonSR was developed using direct compression technique to contain 80 mg of propranolol hydrochloride. The resulting matrix tablets prepared with HPMC K15M or KollidonSR fulfilled all the official requirements of tablet dosage forms. Formulations were evaluated for the release of propranolol hydrochloride over a period of 12 h in pH 6.8 phosphate buffer using USP type II dissolution apparatus. Propranolol hydrochloride and pure KollidonSR or HPMC K15M compatibility interactions was investigated by using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). FTIR spectroscopic and DSC studies revealed that there was no well defined chemical interaction between propranolol hydrochloride with KollidonSR or HPMC K15M. Tablets were exposed to 40 degrees C/75% of RH in open disc for stability. The in vitro drug release study revealed that HPMC K15 at a concentration of 40% of the dosage form weight was able to control the release of propranolol hydrochloride for 12 h, exhibit non-Fickian diffusion with first-order release kinetics where as at 40% KollidonSR same dosage forms show zero-order release kinetics. In conclusion, the in vitro release profile and the mathematical models indicate that release of propranolol hydrochloride can be effectively controlled from a single tablet using HPMC K15M or KollidonSR matrix system.",

    "183": "Disulfide bond exchange among cysteine residues in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains of beta3 was suggested to be involved in activation of alphaIIbbeta3. To investigate the role of specific beta3 cysteines in alphaIIbbeta3 expression and activation, we expressed in baby hamster kidney cells normal alphaIIb with normal beta3 or beta3 with single or double cysteine substitutions of nine disulfide bonds in EGF-3, EGF-4, and beta-tail domains and assessed alphaIIbbeta3 surface expression and activation state by flow cytometry using P2 or PAC-1 antibodies, respectively. Most mutants displayed reduced surface expression of alphaIIbbeta3. Disruptions of disulfide bonds in EGF-3 yielded constitutively active alphaIIbbeta3, implying that these bonds stabilize the inactive alphaIIbbeta3 conformer. Mutants of the Cys-567-Cys-581 bond in EGF-4 were inactive even after exposure to alphaIIbbeta3-activating antibodies, indicating that this bond is necessary for activating alphaIIbbeta3. Disrupting Cys-560-Cys-583 in the EGF-3/EGF-4 or Cys-608-Cys-655 in beta-tail domain resulted in alphaIIbbeta3 activation only when Cys-560 or Cys-655 of each pair was mutated but not when their partners (Cys-583, Cys-608) or both cysteines were mutated, suggesting that free sulfhydryls of Cys-583 and Cys-608 participate in alphaIIbbeta3 activation by a disulfide bond exchange-dependent mechanism. The free sulfhydryl blocker dithiobisnitrobenzoic acid inhibited 70% of anti-LIBS6 antibody-induced activation of wild-type alphaIIbbeta3 and had a smaller effect on mutants, implicating disulfide bond exchange-dependent and -independent mechanisms in alphaIIbbeta3 activation. These data suggest that different disulfide bonds in beta3 EGF and beta-tail domains play variable structural and regulatory roles in alphaIIbbeta3.",

Preoperative treatment options include oral beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, alpha2-adrenergic receptor antagonists, and in the case of hypertensive emergencies, the fast-acting parenteral agents sodium nitroprusside, the intravenous beta-adrenergic receptor blocker esmolol, and nicardipine. Therapeutic options during and after surgery include sodium nitroprusside, esmolol, and nicardipine, among others.", 
    "185": "Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 has been reported to cause endothelial cell apoptosis. However, conflicting data have also demonstrated that TGF-beta1 promotes endothelial cell survival. In this study, the effect of TGF-beta1 on apoptosis of cultured bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAEC) induced by multiple stimuli was investigated. TGF-beta1 protected against apoptosis of bovine PAEC induced by serum deprivation or the VEGF receptor inhibitor SU-5416, but not by UV light exposure or TNFalpha. Neither caspase-8 nor caspase-12 was activated by serum deprivation or the VEGF receptor blocker. However, blockade of VEGF receptors activated caspase-9, an effect that was abolished by TGF-beta1. Furthermore, serum deprivation and inhibition of VEGF receptors significantly decreased the protein level of Bcl-2, an effect that was also abrogated by TGF-beta1. In addition, the baseline level of Bcl-2 was enhanced by TGF-beta1 and reduced by inhibition of activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5), a TGF-beta1 type I receptor. Furthermore, inhibition of ALK5 caused apoptosis of bovine PAEC. These results suggest that TGF-beta1 signaling is critical for maintenance of bovine PAEC survival. Finally, the protective effects of TGF-beta1 on bovine PAEC apoptosis and Bcl-2 reduction were abolished by ALK5 inhibition, but not by inhibition of non-SMAD signaling pathways. Also, TGF-beta1 activated SMAD2 and SMAD1/5, an effect that was abolished by ALK5 inhibition. The results of this study suggest that TGF-beta1 protects against bovine PAEC apoptosis, possibly through ALK5-mediated Bcl-2 induction and subsequent inhibition of the mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Understanding the mechanism by which TGF-beta1 promotes endothelial cell survival may provide a better treatment for apoptosis-dependent vascular diseases, such as emphysema."
