    "0": "1 The effect of isoprenaline on diastolic blood pressure and heart rate was determined in anaesthetized male rats which had been housed individually for 6-8 weeks after weaning, and compared with its effect in group-housed litter-mate controls.2 Isoprenaline caused a significantly greater fall in diastolic pressure in isolated rats and a greater increase in heart rate.3 Low doses of noradrenaline (5-10 ng) caused vasodepressor responses in isolated, but not in group-housed rats.4 The pressor response to noradrenaline, which was smaller in isolated rats, was increased to the level of group-housed controls by (+/-)-propranolol.5 Prolonged isolation of rats may bring about an increase in sensitivity of beta-adrenoceptors to isoprenaline and noradrenaline.", 
    "1": "The effect of (+) IPNEA on various stimulant drugs was examined on isolated rat uterus. Addition of (+) IPNEA (1 times 10- minus 5 g/ml) to the organ bath, produced marked potentiation in the contractile responses of oxytocin and prostaglandins. Potentiation was less significant to 5-HT, vasopressin, angiotensin and bradykinin. (+) INPEA did not potentiate the responses of oxytocin on isolated rat mammary strip and the responses of prostaglandins on rat stomach (fundus) strip, guinea-pig tracheal chain and guinea-pig ileum. The significance of these findings has been discussed.", 
    "2": "1. Two symmetrical giant neurones located in the cerebral ganglion of Aplysia californica contain 4-6 p-mole 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and are able to synthesize it (Weinreich, McCaman, McCaman & Vaughn, 1973; Eisenstadt, Goldman, Kandel, Koike, Koester & Schwartz, 1973). Stimulation of each of these neurones evokes excitatory and inhibitory potentials in various cells of the ipsilateral buccal ganglion. In nine buccal neurones it evokes excitatory potentials, in other three, ;classical' inhibitory potentials and in one neurone an ;atypical' inhibitory potential.2. The connexion between the giant cerebral neurone and the cells receiving either an excitatory or a ;classical' inhibitory input from it are monosynaptic. TEA injection into the cerebral giant neurone, which prolongs the presynaptic spike, causes a gradual increase of both the excitatory and the inhibitory potentials. On the other hand, high Ca(2+) media, which block polysynaptic pathways, do not suppress these synaptic potentials.3. The iontophoretic application of 5-HT to the buccal neurones receiving excitatory input from the giant cerebral neurones evokes depolarizations showing the pharmacological properties of both A- and A'-responses to 5-HT (see preceding paper). Antagonists which block only the A-receptors (curare, 7-methyltryptamine, LSD 25) block partially the synaptic depolarizing potentials. Bufotenine, which blocks both the A- and A'-receptors, completely blocks the excitatory potentials. Thus, the post-synaptic membrane of these buccal neurones appears to be endowed with both A- and A'-receptors to 5-HT.4. The ;classical' inhibitory potentials elicited in three buccal neurones are hyperpolarizations which reverse at - 80 mV and are due to an increase in K(+)-conductance. The iontophoretic application of 5-HT to these post-synaptic neurones evokes hyperpolarizing B-responses which are also generated by an increase in K(+)-conductance. Antagonists which block the B-responses (bufotenine, methoxygramine) also block the inhibitory potentials.5. The ;atypical' inhibitory potential evoked in one buccal neurone consists in an hyperpolarization which increases in amplitude with cell hyperpolarization. Iontophoretic application of 5-HT to this buccal cell evokes an hyperpolarizing beta-response which also increases in amplitude with cell polarization and results from a decrease in both Na(+)- and K(+)- conductances. The monosynaptic character of the ;atypical' inhibitory potential is not yet fully proven.6. It can be concluded that the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic effects evoked in the buccal neurones by the stimulation of the 5-HT-containing-giant cerebral neurones are very likely mediated by 5-HT.", 
    "3": "1. Molluscan neurones have been found to show six different types of response (three excitatory and three inhibitory) to the iontophoretic application of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). The pharmacological properties of the receptors and the ionic mechanisms associated with these responses have been analysed.2. Four of the responses to 5-HT (named A, A', B and C) are consequent upon an increase in membrane conductance whereas the other two (named alpha and beta) are caused by a decrease in membrane conductance.3. The A-response to 5-HT consists of a ;fast' depolarization due to an increase mainly in Na(+)-conductance; the A'-response is a ;slow' depolarization also associated with a Na(+)-conductance increase. Receptors mediating the A- and A'-depolarizations have different pharmacological properties and may exist side by side on the same neurone.4. Both the B- and C-responses are inhibitory. The B-response is a ;slow' hyperpolarization due to an increase in K(+)-conductance, the C-response is a fast hyperpolarization associated with an increase in Cl(-)-conductance.5. The alpha-response to 5-HT is a depolarization which becomes reduced in amplitude with cell hyperpolarization and reverses at -75 mV; it is caused by a decrease in K(+)-conductance. The beta-response is an hyperpolarization which increases in amplitude with cell hyperpolarization and reverses at -20/-30 mV. It results from a decrease in conductance to both Na(+) and K(+) ions.6. The receptors involved in the 5-HT responses associated with a conductance increase may be recognized by the action of specific antagonists: 7-methyltryptamine blocks only the A-receptors, 5-methoxygramine only the B-receptors and neostigmine only the C-receptors. Curare blocks the A- and C-receptors and bufotenine, the A-, A'- and B-receptors. No specific antagonists have yet been found for the 5-HT responses caused by a conductance decrease.7. The significance of the multiplicity of receptors is discussed. Their functional significance at synapses is analysed in the following paper.", 
    "4": "Continuous 6-h infusions of the beta adrenergic blockers d,l-propranolol or oxprenolol significantly reduced plasma renin activity (PRA) and mean blood pressure in the resting rabbit and prevented the stimulatory effects of isoproterenol on renin release and heart rate. These actions were due to blockade of beta receptors, for the inactive isomer, d-propranolol, had no effect. Despite sustained high plasma concentrations of d,l-propranolol (0.2 mug/ml) in the unstimulated animal, PRA did not fall below 36% of control values, suggesting that basal renin secretion is maintained partly by factors other than beta adrenergic mechanisms.Prindolol, another beta blocker, also abolished the effects of isoproterenol on renin and on the heart, and reduced blood pressure in the resting animal. However, prindolol increased resting PRA and heart rate, and in animals already receiving d,l-propranolol, it raised PRA and heart rate without further altering blood pressure. This suggests that the effect on PRA of prindolol was due to its intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and not hypotension-mediated mechanisms. The observation that the blood pressure-lowering effect of prindolol was associated with a rise in PRA, while another beta antagonist, H 35/25, lowered PRA but had no effect on blood pressure, indicates that the hypotensive action of beta blockers is unrelated to their effects on renin release. In both unstimulated and isoproterenol-challenged animals, only blockers possessing beta-1 receptor affinity (d,l-propranolol, oxprenolol, prindolol, practolol, and metoprolol) affected heart rate, while effects on PRA were more prominent with agents possessing beta-2 activity (d,l-propranolol, oxprenolol, prindolol, and H 35/25). Thus, the changes in PRA caused by the beta adrenergic blockers appear to be dependent upon the summation of their direct effects, antagonistic or sympathomimetic, on beta-2 adrenergic receptors regulating renin release.", 
    "5": "Propranolol, practolol, and placebo were each given intravenously at weekly intervals to six normal subjects, and their effects on respiratory function tests and heart rates assessed. The reduction in the exercise heart rate after each of the two drugs was most comparable at six hours, indicating a similar degree of cardiac beta-blockade, when the plasma concentration ratio of practolol to propranolol was 28:1. The peak flow rate (PFR) was higher at all times during exercise than at rest. There were significant differences between the changes in resting and exercise PFR after placebo and the reductions after propranolol (except at 24 hours), but not after practolol-and the latter's influence on PFR seemed to be intermediate to that of propranolol and placebo. At six hours, when the cardiac beta-blocking activity of the two drugs was almost the same, there was a significant difference (P 0.025) between the reductions in exercise PFR associated with each drug.", 
    "6": "A total of 21 patients suffering from drug-induced rashes from practolol have been seen over the past two years. The clinical manifestations varied, with the morphological appearances of the rash resembling those of eczema, lupus erythematosus, lichen planus, and a highly characteristic toxic erythematous psoriasiform eruption. Persistent ocular damage was a feature in three cases."
