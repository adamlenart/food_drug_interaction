    "0": "A double blind trial of a single 40 mg dose of the beta adrenergic blocking agent propranolol in the treatment of essential tremor produced significant reduction of tremor in four of five patients, but this effect was transient and had considerably diminished within four hours. A month's double blind clinical trial of propranolol, in a dose of 30 mg three times a day, showed that the active drug gave statistically better results than placebo for the attenuation of tremor. The mode of action of propranolol in the reduction of essential tremor is probably a dual one, due both to blockage of peripheral beta receptors and to a central depressant effect.", 
    "1": "1. The ortho (M66,527) and para (M66,368) analogues of 1-t-butylamino-3-(methoxyphenoxy)-2-propanol and para substituted tertiary butylphenoxy-1-N-isopropylamine-3 propanol-2 oxalate acid (L8429) were tested in dogs for their beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity.2. M66,527, which contains a methoxy group in the ortho position of the benzene ring, was found to be comparable to propranolol in blocking cardiac and peripheral vascular responses to isoprenaline. Like propranolol, M66,527 was more potent on peripheral receptors.3. Transference of the methoxy group to the para position (M66,368) reduced the overall potency; however, this compound was found to be relatively cardioselective in that it was 2 to 3.6 times more active in blocking cardiac responses to isoprenaline.4. The cardioselective properties of the short chain para methoxy substituent were less than those reported for compounds with longer para substitutions (i.e. practolol, para oxprenolol and para alprenolol).5. L8429, with a tertiary butyl group in the para position, was a weak beta-adrenoceptor antagonist without cardioselective properties. A longer, less bulky n-butyl group may provide for a more potent and selective antagonist.6. The results support the view that the size and site of the substituent on the benzene ring may be of importance in determining the cardioselective potency of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists.", 
    "2": "1. Tachycardia and bronchodilatation were produced by intravenous dimethylphenylpiperazinium iodide (DMPP) in the spinal or pithed cat. Responses other than those involving beta-adrenoceptors were minimized by appropriate blocking agents.2. With intact adrenals, both the tachycardia and bronchodilatation with 10 mug/kg DMPP were equal to those with 1 mug/kg adrenaline.3. After adrenalectomy, tachycardia with 100 mug/kg DMPP was equal to that with 1.5 mug/kg adrenaline, but the bronchodilatation was equal to that with only 0.3 mug/kg. This difference may reflect the relative activity of the sympathetic supply to the organs.4. After adrenalectomy, propranolol was 3 times as effective against bronchodilatation due to DMPP as against tachycardia. Practolol was inactive against bronchodilatation.5. With intact adrenals, propranolol reduced both tachycardia and bronchodilatation due to DMPP equally. Propranolol also antagonized equally both effects of adrenaline in the pithed cat after adrenalectomy.6. In the spinal cat, propranolol caused bradycardia and bronchoconstriction that persisted after adrenalectomy or pithing. It was reduced by pempidine and guanethidine and is attributed to spontaneous adrenergic neuronal activity.7. The Appendix describes a device for cycle-by-cycle spirometry and correction for zero drift of a micromanometer, used in this study for the continuous recording of bronchial resistance.", 
    "3": "1. The effect of stimulation of hepatic alpha- and beta-sympathetic receptors on the membrane potential of liver cells was studied utilizing the isolated perfused dog liver. In this preparation, potentials are maintained close to their normal values (around -50 mV) for several hours.2. The administration of adrenaline (0.5 muM) caused an immediate depolarization, which reached 23 mV in 2 min. The potential gradually returned to base line levels in less than 20 min. A slight hyperpolarization often followed, despite a fall in the K content of the tissues. Similar results could be obtained with a lower concentration (0.1 muM) of adrenaline.3. Potential changes after adrenaline injection are not altered by prior inhibition of the Na pump by ouabain. The adrenaline induced depolarization may be attributed to an increase in P(Na) and the repolarization to a decrease in P(Na). An electrogenic mechanism does not seem to be involved.4. Administration of the beta-sympathomimetic agent isoprenaline (1 muM) is followed by hyperpolarization, the potential increasing from -45.7 +/- 1.5 to -55.0 +/- 2.7 mV. Isoprenaline also slows the potential drop produced by ouabain. The action of isoprenaline may be explained by a reduction in permeability to Na.5. Adrenaline also produces hyperpolarization in the presence of an alpha-blocking agent, phenoxybenzamine. In the presence of a beta-blocking agent, propranolol, it causes more prolonged depolarization.6. In the dog, the effect of alpha-stimulation appears to be a rapid increase in permeability to Na, producing depolarization and of Na for K exchange. Stimulation of beta-receptors results in a slower decrease in P(Na) and hyperpolarization. The combination of these two effects could explain the depolarization followed by repolarization produced by adrenaline.", 
    "4": "1. The temperatures of the liver and afferent aortic and portal blood were measured in 20 degrees C acclimated rats at different environmental temperatures (T(a)) between 20 and 37 degrees C. The heated-thermocouple technique was used to measure the metabolic heat production of the liver, its blood flow, and to correct the temperature difference between it and the reference junction for blood flow.2. The temperature of the liver was higher than that of the afferent blood. On raising T(a) from 20 to 30 degrees C the liver temperature fell and the temperature difference between the liver and the aortic blood was reduced despite the decrease in the thermal gradient between the liver and the exterior and a small reduction in hepatic blood flow. A further rise in T(a) to 37 degrees C led to an increase in the liver and blood temperatures. The same pattern was seen when the temperature differences were corrected for blood flow.3. Metabolic heat production in the liver decreased when T(a) was raised from 20 to 30 degrees C.4. In a 20 degrees C environment inhibition of non-shivering thermogenesis with propranolol HCl (10 mg/kg body wt. I.V.) led to a fall in the temperature of the liver and its metabolic heat production towards levels found in untreated rats at T(a) = 30 degrees C. Consequently, in treated rats the change in metabolic heat production on raising T(a) to 30 degrees C was less than in untreated ones.5. These results are interpreted as evidence for the participation of the liver in thermoregulatory non-shivering thermogenesis."
