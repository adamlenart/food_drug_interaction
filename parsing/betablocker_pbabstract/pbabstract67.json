Both are intravenous agents but have different effects on systemic hemodynamics, and may have differential effects on pulse-wave reflection and pulse-pressure amplification, with consequences for peripheral versus central blood pressures (BPs).", 
    "1": "We conducted a nonrandomized, open-label study of 8 patients treated with sodium nitroprusside (mean age (\u00b1SD), 44\u00b114 years; 6 males; diastolic/systolic BP, 225\u00b122/135\u00b18mm Hg) and 6 patients treated with intravenous labetalol (mean age, 39\u00b115 years; 4 males; systolic/diastolic BP, 232\u00b122/138\u00b117mm Hg) before and after treatment for malignant hypertension, aiming at a 25% reduction in mean arterial pressure. We measured peripheral pressures with an intra-arterial catheter in the radial artery and derived central pressures with a generalized transfer filter.", 
    "2": "Mean arterial pressure was similarly reduced with sodium nitroprusside and labetalol (by 27% and 30%, respectively; P = 0.76). There was a nonsignificantly greater reduction in peripheral systolic blood pressure (SBP) with labetalol than with sodium nitroprusside (29\u00b111% vs. 18\u00b17%, P = 0.08). The decline in peripheral diastolic blood pressure (DBP) with the two agents was comparable, whereas the reduction in peripheral pulse pressure was 8\u00b116% with SNP and 33\u00b117% with labetalol (P = 0.01). The decline in reflection magnitude was greater with SNP than with labetalol. There were no significant differences in the reduction of central BP with SNP and labetalol. The amplification of PP increased with SNP but did not change with labetalol.",

    "4": "BACKGROUND Acute beta-adrenergic blockade increases aortic-wave reflection in young women. However, it is not known whether this effect extends to postmenopausal women. We therefore examined the effect of systemic beta-adrenergic blockade on aortic wave reflection in 14 postmenopausal women with a mean age of 58\u00b12 years. METHODS Aortic pressure waveforms were synthesized noninvasively from high-fidelity radial pressure waveforms obtained through applanation tonometry before and during systemic beta-blockade with propranolol given in a bolus dose of 0.25mg/kg, followed by a continuous infusion at 0.004mg/kg/min. To further examine the effects of acute beta-blockade on aortic-wave reflection in postmenopausal women, we compared the changes in hemodynamics and indices of aortic-wave reflection with published data from a previous study with a protocol identical to that in the present study but which involved young women. RESULTS Acute beta-blockade increased the aortic augmentation index (AIx) in postmenopausal women (32\u00b12% vs. 35\u00b12%, P < 0.01). However, AIx adjusted for a heart rate of 75 bpm (AIx75) was unchanged (25\u00b12% vs. 24\u00b12%, P > 0.05). The changes in AIx, AIx75, and the amplitude of reflected waves (augmented aortic pressure) during beta-blockade were all substantially smaller in postmenopausal women than in their younger counterparts (P < 0.05). Conclusions As compared with those in our previously published study involving young women, indices of aortic-wave reflection were significantly less affected by acute systemic beta-adrenergic blockade in the postmenopausal women in the present study. Taken together, our data suggest that the negative effects (i.e. increased aortic wave reflection) of nonselective beta-adrenergic blockade are less pronounced in postmenopausal than in young women.", 
    "5": "Beta blockers provide both morbidity and mortality benefits for post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients. Despite this, beta blockers are still often underused or used at suboptimal dosages. This was a retrospective observational study with the objectives of estimating the proportion of post-MI patients who are receiving beta-blocker therapy in University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC), assessing the number of them receiving beta blockers at optimal dosages and determining the factors associated with beta-blocker prescribing post-MI. Of 315 patient case notes reviewed, 77.5% were prescribed beta blockers. However, dosages were optimized in only 39.3% of patients. Reasons for not optimizing the dosages were typically not due to the presence of contraindications to beta blockers. Elderly (> 65 years old), ejection fraction (EF) < 40%, a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or mild asthma, use of calcium channel blocker (CCB), digoxin or anti-asthmatic agents were all significantly associated with a reduced rate of beta-blocker prescribing post-MI. More effort should be placed in improving its use in specific patient populations. Initiatives to optimize the dosage of beta blockers to recommended dosages that matched those in clinical trials with proven mortality benefits will also need to be intensified.",

The five specific probe substrates include caffeine (1A2), metoprolol (2D6), dapsone (3A4), omeprazole (2C19) and chlorzoxazone (2E1). Automated pre-purification of plasma and enrichment of analytes were performed using a C18 on-line solid-phase extraction cartridge. After being eluted from the cartridge, the analytes and the internal standard antipyrine were separated on a C18 RP analytical column and analyzed by DAD. The method was validated to quantify the concentration ranges of 0.05-50.0 \u03bcg/ml for dapsone and omeprazole, 0.1-50.0 \u03bcg/ml for caffeine and 0.2-50.0 \u03bcg/ml for metoprolol and chlorzoxazone. The linearity (R(2)) for all analytes tested was exceeded 0.99. The intra-day precision ranged from 0.29 to 13% and the inter-day precision ranged from 5.0 to 15%, respectively. The intra-day and inter-day accuracy were between 86.7% and 113.6%. The extraction recoveries were in the range 82.8-109.9% for all the analytes and internal standard antipyrine. This method was successfully applied to evaluate the effects of TM208 on rat five CYP450 isoforms.",

Laboratory tests, which included serum tryptase assay, were normal. Histological analysis showed a normal epidermis with dilated superficial dermal capillaries and no inflammatory infiltrate or dermal elastosis.

Inhibition of muscular contraction induced by this treatment results in vasodilatation, accounting for the associated antihypertensive properties, and this could play a role in telangiectasia formation. The literature contains reports of cases of photo-distributed telangiectasia, suggesting that as well as vasodilatation, calcium inhibitors may in certain cases cause abnormal sensitivity of blood vessels to ultraviolet radiation. The absence of facial lesions rules out the hypothesis of photo-induced lesions in our patient.",

The coating was evaluated by examining the chiral separation of two analytes (thiopental, sotalol) with three cellulose derivatives (cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate phthalate, and cellulose acetate butyrate). Baseline separation of thiopental enantiomers was achieved by use of each polysaccharide coating (Rs: 7.0, 8.1, 7.1), while sotalol provided partial resolution (Rs: 0.7, 1.0, 0.9).

Isoflavene itself has potent anti-cancer activity while propranolol can enhance anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic properties of 5-fluorouracil and paclitaxel. The hybrids were produced via nucleophilic addition of substituted amine groups to a dioxiran intermediate, which was in turn generated from the Williamson-type reaction of isoflavene with (\u00b1)-epichlorohydrin. These analogues were tested in anti-cancer cell viability assays against SHEP neuroblastoma and MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma cell lines, and were found to exhibit potent anti-proliferative activities. These compounds also displayed anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative effects in HMEC-1 human microvascular endothelial cell lines. Notably, the most potent hybrid molecules synthesized in this work showed enhanced potency against cancer cell lines compared to either isoflavene or propranolol alone, while retaining significant selectivity for cancer cells over MRC-5 normal lung fibroblast cells.", 
    "17": "An isolated atrial preparation of the mouse is useful for analyzing the actions of drugs on the myocardium, autonomic neurons and endocardial endothelium. The aim of the present study was to examine the functions of intrinsic neurons of the atrium using a ganglionic stimulant, 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium (DMPP). DMPP (1-100 \u03bcM) caused a negative chronotropic action followed by a positive chronotropic action in spontaneously beating right atria and also caused biphasic inotropic actions consisting of initial inhibition followed by potentiation of electrical field stimulation (EFS)-induced contraction in the left atria. Inotropic actions in the left atria induced by DMPP were characterized using some autonomic drugs and M2 and/or M3 muscarinic receptor knockout (M2R-KO, M3R-KO and M2M3R-KO) mice. Atropine and hexamethonium decreased the initial negative inotropic actions of DMPP. In the atria from pertussis toxin-treated, M2R-KO and M2/M3R-KO mice, the negative inotropic actions were abolished. On the other hand, the following positive inotropic actions were decreased by hexamethonium, atropine and atenolol. In the atria from reserpine-treated mice, positive inotropic actions were also decreased. The positive inotropic action induced by DMPP was almost the same in M2R-KO mice but was reduced in both M3R-KO mice and M2/M3R-KO mice. In conclusion, DMPP caused biphasic inotropic/chronotropic actions in the mouse atrium through activation of intrinsic cholinergic and adrenergic neurons. M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors and \u03b21-adrenoceptor are thought to be involved in these actions.",

We compared the effects of nebivolol and atenolol, a first generation \u03b21-selective blocker, on left ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis, and function and microRNA expression in a rodent model of hypertension. Dahl salt-sensitive rats received either low-salt chow (control) or AIN-76A high-salt (8% NaCl) diet and randomized to vehicle (high-salt), nebivolol (20 mg/kg per day), or atenolol (50 mg/kg per day) for 8 weeks. High-salt induced left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis and decreased the expression of miR-27a, -29a, and -133a. Nebovolol attenuated deterioration of left ventricular systolic function, remodeling, and fibrosis more than atenolol, despite similar effects on heart rate and blood pressure. Nebivolol, but not atenolol, prevented the decrease in miR-27a and -29a induced by high-salt. Nebivolol and atenolol equally attenuated the decrease in miR-133a. In vitro overexpression of miR-27a,-29a, and -133a inhibited cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and reduced collagen expression. Both miR-27a and -29a target Sp1, and miR-133a targets Cdc42. Pharmacological inhibition of Sp1 and Cdc42 decreased myocardial fibrosis and hypertrophy. Our data support a differential microRNAs expression profile in salt-induced hypertension. Nebivolol substantially attenuated cardiac remodeling, hypertrophy, and fibrosis more than atenolol. These effects are related to attenuation of the hypertension-induced decrease in miR-27a and -29a (with a subsequent decrease in Sp1 expression) and miR-133a (with a subsequent decrease in Cdc42).",

The aim of this study was to investigate whether nebivolol has additional effects on \u03b2-adrenoceptor-mediated functional responses along with morphologic and molecular determinants of cardiac hypertrophy compared with those of metoprolol, a selective \u03b21-adrenoceptor blocker. Rats infused by isoprenaline (100 \u03bcg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1), 14 days) were randomized into three groups according to the treatment with metoprolol (30 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1)), nebivolol (10 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1)), or placebo for 13 days starting on day 1 after implantation of minipump.

    "41": "The diagnosis of stress cardiomyopathy is often made during coronary angiography. At this point hemodynamic parameters should be assessed; a right heart catheterization with measurement of cardiac output by Fick and thermodilution methods is helpful. Patients with acute neurologic pathology who develop left ventricular dysfunction (neurogenic stunned myocardium) may not be candidates for coronary angiography and in such cases real-time myocardial contrast echocardiography or nuclear perfusion scan can be used to exclude obstructive coronary disease. Hypotension and shock can be due to low output state or left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Low output state can be managed with diuretics and vasopressor support. Refractory shock and/or severe mitral regurgitation may require an intra-aortic balloon pump for temporary support. In patients with intraventricular gradient intravenous beta-blockers have been used safely. Hemodynamically unstable patients should be managed in a critical care unit and stable patients should be monitored on a telemetry unit as arrhythmias may occur. An echocardiogram should be performed to look for intraventricular gradient, mitral regurgitation, or left ventricular thrombus. If left ventricular thrombus is seen or suspected anticoagulation with warfarin or low molecular weight heparin is generally advised until recovery of myocardial function and resolution of thrombus occurs. In patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage the use of vasopressors to reduce cerebral vasospasm may worsen left ventricular outflow tract gradient. In hemodynamically stable patients, a beta-blocker or combined alpha/beta blocker should be initiated. Myocardial function generally recovers within days to weeks with supportive treatment in most patients. The use of a standard heart failure regimen including an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or aldosterone receptor antagonist, beta-blocker titrated to maximal dose, diuretics, and aspirin is common until complete recovery of myocardial function occurs. Chronic therapy with a beta-blocker may be advisable. The underlying diagnosis that precipitated stress cardiomyopathy such as critical illness, neurologic injury, or medication exposure should be identified and treated.",

Key considerations in the decision-making process included (1) concerns that an alternative thienopyridine, ticlopidine, might be unavailable for long-term outpatient use due to an ongoing national drug shortage, (2) the patient's concomitant use of metoprolol (cessation of \u03b2-blocker use is recommended for four days before attempted clopidogrel desensitization), and (3) recent reports of the safe use of prasugrel in three patients with a history of clopidogrel allergy. In the case described here, prasugrel administration was effective and did not result in adverse effects; however, the risk of cross-reactivity of clopidogrel and ticlopidine or prasugrel remains largely unknown. The case highlights the importance of careful consideration of a number of patient- and drug-specific factors in the selection of the most appropriate antiplatelet dual therapy for patients with a history of allergic reactions to clopidogrel.",

However, little is known about the role of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) activated by adrenergic signaling on cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. A cytoplasmic tyrosine residue in \u03b21-adrenoceptor is estimated to regulate Gs-protein binding affinity from crystal structure studies, but the signaling pathway leading to the phosphorylation of these residues is unknown. Here we show \u03b11-adrenergic signaling inhibits \u03b2-adrenergically activated Ca(2+) current, Ca(2+) transients and contractile force through phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in \u03b21-adrenoceptor by PTK. Our results indicate that inhibition of \u03b2-adrenoceptor-mediated Ca(2+) elevation by \u03b11-adrenoceptor-PTK signaling serves as an important regulatory feedback mechanism when the catecholamine level increases to protect cardiomyocytes from cytosolic Ca(2+) overload.",

LEMS analyses of single analytes as a function of concentration were linear over ~2.5 orders of magnitude for all four analytes and displayed no sign of saturation. Corresponding electrospray ionization (ESI) measurements displayed a nonmonotonic increase as saturation occurred at higher concentrations. In contrast to the LEMS experiments, the intensity ratios from control experiments using conventional ESI-MS deviated from expected values for the equimolar mixture measurements due to ion suppression of less surface active analytes, particularly in the analysis of the four-component mixture. In the analyses of two-component nonequimolar mixtures, both techniques were able to determine the concentration ratios after adjustment with response factors although conventional ESI-MS was subject to a greater degree of saturation and ion suppression at higher analyte concentrations.",

Cassette dosing method was used in the epithelium side of cornea in vitro to get the effect of penetrant, and the perfusate was collected in the side of endothelium. The protein in the sample was precipitated and discarded by high speed centrifugation before injection. An Agilent Zorbax Extend column (150 mm x 3 mm, 5 microm) was used at 30 degrees C. The mobile phase system contained acetonitrile and 0.03% (v/v) phosphoric acid aqueous solution and the percentage of acetonitrile changed between 3% and 20% (v/v) in a linear gradient elution. The samples were detected by an ultraviolet (UV) detector at 205 nm. The results showed that the eight derivatives of propranolol were completely separated and determined in 31 min. The correlation coefficients were above 0.9970 and good linear relationships were obtained in the range of 0.2 (0.1)-40.0 micromol/L. Under the optimized conditions, the recoveries of the derivatives were in the range of 91.12%-105.73%. The intra-day relative standard deviations (RSDs) were in the range of 1.00%-11.63%, and the inter-day RSDs were in the range of 1.18%-18.58%.

    "54": "Upon perception of a stimulus as stressful, the human brain reacts with the activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), to mobilize energy resources to better cope with the stressor. Since the perception of the stressor is the initial stimulus, a synchronicity between the subjective perception of stress and the physiological stress reactivity should be expected. However, according to a recent meta-analysis, these associations are weak and inconsistent. The goal of the current study was to investigate the interaction between the SNS, HPA and subjective stress perceptions, by introducing an experimental manipulation of this interaction. For this purpose, we combined the SNS inhibitor propranolol with the Trier Social Stress Test, and measured endocrinological and psychological responses to the stressor. Thirty healthy male participants were recruited and randomly assigned to either a propranolol (PROP; n\u200a=\u200a15) or placebo (PLC; n\u200a=\u200a15) group. All subjects were administered 80 mg of propranolol 60 minutes prior to exposure to psychosocial stress. Salivary cortisol and alpha amylase (sAA), heart rate, blood pressure and subjective stress responses were assessed throughout the study. We observed significantly reduced sAA levels and heart rate increases in the PROP group in response to stress, with no effects of the drug on systolic or diastolic blood pressure changes. In line with previous studies, a significant increase in cortisol was seen in response to the stress exposure. Importantly, the cortisol increase was significantly higher in the PROP group. A typical increase in subjective stress could be seen in both groups, with no significant group differences emerging. Complementing previous work, this study further demonstrates a significant interaction between the HPA and the SNS during acute stress. The HPA activity was found to be elevated in the presence of a suppressed SNS in reactivity to the TSST.",

In brown adipocytes, the increase in PGC-1\u03b1 expression induced by \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation is mediated by activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), which phosphorylates and activates the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) family member activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2), which binds to a cyclic AMP response element (CRE) in the PGC-1\u03b1 promoter and mediates the increase in PGC-1\u03b1 transcription. Phospho-CREB does not have this effect. Our results show that the reason for the lack of effect of \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation on PGC-1\u03b1 expression in muscle is that catecholamines do not activate p38 or increase ATF2 phosphorylation in muscle.", 
    "103": "Systemic anaphylaxis accompanies pulmonary vasoconstriction and bronchoconstriction, which may contribute to increased right heart afterload, and finally anaphylactic hypotension. However, the pulmonary response to anaphylaxis is not known in mice. We determined the pulmonary vascular and bronchial response to systemic anaphylaxis in anesthetized BALB/c mice. We also clarified the roles of \u03b2-adrenoceptors, nitric oxide, and cyclooxygenase metabolites in these responses. Anaphylaxis was induced by an intravenous injection of the ovalbumin antigen into open-chest artificially ventilated sensitized mice. Mean arterial pressure, systolic pulmonary arterial pressure, central venous pressure, airway pressure, and aortic blood flow were continuously measured. In sensitized control mice, mean arterial pressure, and aortic blood flow substantially decreased soon after the antigen injection, while systolic pulmonary arterial pressure and airway pressure did not increase. In contrast, in mice pretreated with either the \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551 (0.2 mg/kg; n = 6), or L-NAME (50 mg/kg; n = 6), but not with the \u03b2(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol (2 mg/kg; n = 6) or indomethacin (5 mg/kg; n = 6), systolic pulmonary arterial pressure increased by 7 mmHg at 1.5 min after antigen. In L-NAME pretreated mice, pulmonary hypertension was sustained over 30 min of the experimental period. Airway pressure did not significantly change after antigen in any mice studied. In conclusion, pulmonary response to systemic anaphylaxis does not increase the right heart afterload and, therefore, may not contribute to the initial decrease in venous return and anaphylactic hypotension in anesthetized mice. \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptor activation and nitric oxide, but not \u03b2(1)-adrenoceptor activation or cyclooxygenase metabolites, attenuate the antigen-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction.",

    "123": "Based on its lower Log P value relative to metoprolol, a marker for the low/high-permeability (P(eff)) class boundary, pseudoephedrine was provisionally classified as BCS low-permeability compound. On the other hand, following oral administration, pseudoephedrine fraction dose absorbed (F(abs)) and systemic bioavailability approaches 100%. This represents a challenge to the generally recognized P(eff)-F(abs) correlation. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the underlying mechanisms behind the confusion in pseudoephedrine's BCS classification. Pseudoephedrine's BCS solubility class was determined, and its physicochemical properties and intestinal permeability were thoroughly investigated, both in vitro and in vivo in rats, considering the complexity of the whole of the small intestine. Pseudoephedrine was found to be unequivocally a high-solubility compound. All of the permeability studies revealed similar phenomenon; at any given intestinal segment/pH, the permeability of metoprolol was higher than that of pseudoephedrine, however, as the intestinal region becomes progressively distal, and the pH gradually increases, pseudoephedrine's permeability rises above that of metoprolol in the former segment. This unique permeability pattern likely explains pseudoephedrine's complete absorption. In conclusion, pseudoephedrine is a BCS Class I compound; no discrepancy between P(eff) and F(abs) is involved in its absorption. Rather, it reflects the complexity behind P(eff) when considering the whole of the intestine. We propose to allow high-permeability classification to drugs with P(eff) that matches/exceeds the low/high class benchmark anywhere throughout the intestinal tract and not restricted necessarily to the jejunum.",

Left and right ventricular function was assessed with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and in-vivo myocardial calcium influx with manganese enhanced MRI. In the mdx mice at baseline there was reduced stroke volume, cardiac index, and end-diastolic volume with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. These abnormalities were no longer evident after treatment with beta-blockers. Right ventricular ejection fraction was reduced and right ventricular end-systolic volume increased in the mdx mice. With metoprolol there was an increase in right ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes. Left and right ventricular function was normal in the Sgcd-/- mice. Metroprolol had no significant effects on left and right ventricular function in these mice, though heart/body weight ratios increased after treatment. In-vivo myocardial calcium influx with MEMRI was significantly elevated in both models, though metoprolol had no significant effects on either. In conclusion, metoprolol treatment at an early stage in the development of cardiomyopathy has deleterious effects on right ventricular function in mdx mice and in both models no effect on increased in-vivo calcium influx. This suggests that clinical trials need to carefully monitor not just left ventricular function but also right ventricular function and other aspects of myocardial metabolism.", 
    "139": "The adsorption behaviour of three commonly used drugs, namely ketoprofen, hydrochlorothiazide and atenolol, from diluted aqueous solutions on beta zeolites with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (i.e. 25, 38 and 360) was investigated by changing the ionic strength and the pH, before and after thermal treatment of the adsorbents. The selective adsorption of drugs was confirmed by thermogravimetry and X-ray diffraction. The adsorption capacity of beta zeolites was strongly dependent on both the solution pH and the alumina content of the adsorbent. Such a remarkable difference was interpreted as a function of the interactions between drug molecules and zeolite surface functional groups. Atenolol was readily adsorbed on the less hydrophobic zeolite, under pH conditions in which electrostatic interactions were predominant. On the other hand, ketoprofen adsorption was mainly driven by hydrophobic interactions. For undissociated molecules the adsorption capability increased with the increase of hydrophobicity.",

Ten strips of non-pregnant human myometrium stimulated with 55\u00a0mm potassium chloride (KCl) were treated with three concentrations (30, 100 and 300\u00a0\u03bcm) of tramadol to test for any inhibitory effect of tramadol. The effects of concurrent administration of the \u00df adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (1\u00a0\u03bcm), the guanylyl cyclase and nitric oxide synthase inhibitor methylene blue (20\u00a0\u03bcm) and the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (100\u00a0\u03bcm) with tramadol were also studied. Tramadol caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of KCl-induced myometrial contractility, which was statistically significant at all three concentrations of tramadol used. Propranolol significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of 100\u00a0\u03bcm tramadol on KCl-induced myometrial contractility but not that of 300\u00a0\u03bcm tramadol. Neither methylene blue nor naloxone reversed the inhibitory effect of tramadol on KCl-induced myometrial contractility. These results suggest that tramadol inhibits KCl-induced contractility of isolated human myometrium. They also suggest that tramadol relaxes the myometrium due to stimulation of \u00df1 adrenoceptors.

To test whether this is because of regional differences in ER distribution or vasodilator activity, cephalic (carotid artery), thoracic (thoracic aorta and pulmonary artery), and abdominal arteries (abdominal aorta, mesenteric artery, and renal artery) from female Sprague-Dawley rats were prepared to measure contraction to phenylephrine and relaxation to acetylcholine (ACh) and the ER activators 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) (all ERs), 4,4',4\u2033-(4-propyl-[1H]-pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl)-tris-phenol (PPT) (ER\u03b1), diarylpropionitrile (DPN) (ER\u03b2), and (\u00b1)-1-[(3aR*,4S*,9bS*)-4-(6-bromo-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-3a,4,5,9b-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]quinolin-8-yl]-ethanone (G1) (GPR30). Phenylephrine caused contraction that was enhanced in endothelium-denuded aorta, supporting endothelial release of vasodilators. In cephalic and thoracic arteries, ACh relaxation was abolished by the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor N\u03c9-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), suggesting a role of NO. In mesenteric vessels, ACh-induced relaxation was partly inhibited by the L-NAME + cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin and blocked by the K+ channel blocker tetraethylammonium, suggesting a hyperpolarization pathway. E2 and PPT caused similar relaxation in all vessels. DPN and G1 caused smaller relaxation that was more prominent in abdominal vessels. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed variable ER\u03b1 messenger RNA expression and increased ER\u03b2 in carotid artery and GPR30 in abdominal arteries. Western blots revealed greater amounts of ER\u03b1, ER\u03b2, and GPR30 in abdominal arteries. In thoracic aorta, E2-, PPT-, and DPN-induced relaxation was blocked by L-NAME and was associated with increased nitrite/nitrate production, suggesting a role of NO. In abdominal vessels, E2-, PPT-, DPN-, and G1-induced relaxation persisted in L-NAME + indomethacin + tetraethylammonium-treated or endothelium-denuded arteries, suggesting direct effect on vascular smooth muscle. E2, PPT, DPN, and G1 caused greater relaxation of KCl-induced contraction in abdominal vessels, suggesting inhibitory effects on Ca2+ entry. Thus, E2 and ER\u03b1 stimulation produces similar relaxation of the cephalic, thoracic, and abdominal arteries. In the cephalic and thoracic arteries, particularly the thoracic aorta, E2-induced and ER\u03b1- and ER\u03b2-mediated vasodilation involves NO production. ER\u03b2- and GPR30-mediated relaxation is greater in the abdominal arteries and seems to involve hyperpolarization and inhibition of vascular smooth muscle Ca2+ entry. Specific ER agonists could produce vasodilation in specific vascular beds without affecting other vessels in the systemic circulation.",

The voltage and Ca(2+) sensitivity of BK channels were greater in CASMCs than in PASMCs. Targeted gene knockout of \u03b2(1)-subunits significantly reduced BK currents in CASMCs but had no effect in PASMCs.

    "212": "Twenty patients (36 \u00b1 10 years; 16 women) with IST were enrolled. All patients received metoprolol succinate 95 mg single dose during the first month of the study. After 4 weeks of treatment with metoprolol, ivabradine was administered as adjuvant therapy up to 7.5 mg twice daily. Holter monitoring and treadmill stress test were performed at baseline, after 4, and 8 weeks of the study, respectively.", 
    "213": "We observed significant and similar reduction in resting HR both for metoprolol and for combined therapy compared to the baseline. The mean HR during daily activity was significantly lower on ivabradine and metoprolol compared to monotherapy with \u03b2-blocker. The combined treatment yielded a significant increase in exercise capacity as assessed by treadmill stress test. After 4 weeks of combined therapy a significant reduction in IST-related symptoms, measured by means of the European Heart Rhythm Association score, was observed.",

    "215": "Chemotherapy with trastuzumab and anthracycline is associated with incident heart failure (HF) in patients with breast cancer. We hypothesized that continuous incidental use of \u03b2-blocker agents (BB) was protective against HF in patients without established structural heart disease who were receiving trastuzumab and anthracycline.",

Using a propensity score and a greedy 5 to 1 digit-matching algorithm, 106 of these patients on continuous BB during cancer treatment were matched with 212 patients from the same pool with similar characteristics but not on continuous BB. During a median follow-up of 3.2\u00b12.0 years, 32 incident HF admissions were identified in these 318 patients with breast cancer, whereas 28 cancer-related (noncardiac) deaths occurred before any incident HF. Cumulative incidence regression models and cause-specific hazards of new HF events were estimated from competing risk Cox models of time-dependent covariates. Although trastuzumab therapy showed significant association with incident HF, independent of anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity (hazard ratio, 9.0; 95% confidence interval, 3.0-27.0; P<0.0001), continuous use of BB was associated with lower risk of new HF events (hazard ratio, 0.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.1-0.5; P=0.003).", 
    "217": "Coincidental, continuous use of BB is associated with lower incidence of HF in patients with breast cancer and normal baseline ejection fraction in a competing risk framework, and after matching for demographics, clinical, and cancer-related treatment characteristics. Prospective randomized clinical trials to validate these findings are warranted.",

However, the involved molecular mechanisms are unclear. Here, we established a stable prostate cancer cell line overexpressing hCG\u03b2 and tested hCG\u03b2-triggered signaling pathways causing cell migration and invasion. ELISA showed that the hCG\u03b2 amount secreted into medium increased with culture time after the hCG\u03b2-transfected cells were incubated for 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 h. More, hCG\u03b2 standards promoted MAPK (ERK1/2) phosphorylation and increased MMP-2 expression and activity in both dose- and time-dependent manners in hCG\u03b2 non-transfected cells. In addition, hCG\u03b2 promoted ERK1/2 phosphorylation and increased MMP-2 expression and activity significantly in hCG\u03b2 transfected DU145 cells. Whereas ERK1/2 blocker PD98059 (25 \u00b5M) significantly downregulated phosphorylated ERK1/2 and MMP-2. Particularly, hCG\u03b2 promoted cell migration and invasion, yet the PD98059 diminished the hCG\u03b2-induced cell motility under those conditions. These results indicated that hCG\u03b2 induced cell motility via promoting ERK1/2 phosphorylation and MMP-2 upregulation in human prostate cancer DU145 cells.",

Irrespective of whether revascularisation is being undertaken, all patients with stable coronary disease require optimal medical therapy in order to reduce the risk of subsequent adverse cardiac events, particularly acute myocardial infarction. The role of medical management has been very actively investigated and reported, particularly because of the global disease burden and the associated high morbidity and mortality. In this review, the current available medical management for the treatment of coronary atherosclerosis is described together with the role and prospects of the newer classes of drugs that are coming into use, and future perspectives in this field.",

In this study, the association of BMI, BNP levels and mortality in patients hospitalized for heart failure with preserved LV systolic function (HFpLVF) was investigated.", 
    "229": "One hundred fifty consecutive patients (98% men) who were hospitalized with HFpLVF and had BNP levels measured on admission were analyzed. Patients were divided into categories of BMI: normal (BMI < 25 kg/m), overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m) and obese (BMI \u2265 30 kg/m). Relevant clinical and echocardiographic characteristics and all-cause mortality were obtained through chart review.",

Higher BMI predicted BNP levels of <100 pg/mL. Compared with patients with normal BMI, overweight and obese patients had a significantly lower risk of total mortality, even after adjusting for other clinical characteristics, including log-transformed BNP levels, atrial fibrillation, the use of beta-blockers at discharge, age, hemoglobin levels and the presence of pulmonary congestion on admission. Higher BNP levels also independently predicted mortality.", 
    "231": "An inverse relationship between BMI and BNP levels exists in patients hospitalized with HFpLVF. Higher BMI is associated with lower mortality, whereas higher BNP levels predict higher mortality in male patients with HFpLVF. These findings should be confirmed in a larger multicenter setting.",

We repeated recordings after 25 mg carvedilol, and after 0.04 mg/kg atropine. Autoregressive analysis quantified RRI-, BP-, and CBFV-spectral powers at 0.1 Hz and 0.2 Hz. We compared parameters at rest, during 0.1 Hz, or 0.2 Hz NS, with and without carvedilol or atropine (analysis of variance, post hoc testing; significance, P<0.05).",

TR is present in a significant proportion of the population and is especially prevalent in patients with advanced heart failure. Patients with TR have been demonstrated to have a decreased survival even with normal left heart function. TR can be a result of pathology that directly affects the valvular structure (i.e., Ebstein anomaly) or as a result of increased forward pressures (ie, pulmonary hypertension, left heart failure). Conservative management of patients with TR is primarily symptomatic relief. Definitive therapy involves surgical repair of the tricuspid valve. Furthermore, as more patients develop advanced heart failure, the management of TR in patients with left ventricular assist devices has become necessary because of the evidence of increased in-hospital morbidity and a trend toward decreased survival.",

The coated capillaries provided in capillary electrophoresis an excellent run-to-run repeatability, capillary-to-capillary and day-to-day reproducibility. The capillaries worked reliably over 1 month with EOF repeatability below 0.5%. The positively charged coated capillaries were successfully applied to the capillary electrophoretic separation of three standard proteins and five \u03b2-blockers with the separation efficiencies ranging from 132,000 to 303,000 plates/m, and from 82,000 to 189,000 plates/m, respectively.

The serendipitous discovery of the therapeutic efficacy of propranolol in the management of infantile hemangiomas has revolutionized the care and understanding of these lesions, and greatly improved the prognosis for a good cosmetic outcome. In addition, there has been an expansion of indications for treatment of hemangiomas, taking into account not only those hemangiomas that can cause airway compromise, amblyopia, and cardiac overload, but also those lesions that can lead to unsatisfactory cosmetic outcome or deformity after involution. Current concepts of pathogenesis of infantile hemangiomas, of segmental hemangiomas with systemic associations, of hepatic hemangiomas, and of the use of systemic and topical beta-blockers for the management of IH are all reviewed.", 
    "239": "The aim of the present study was to clarify the involvement of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or organic anion transporting polypeptide (Oatp) 1a5 in the pharmacokinetics of nadolol (NDL), a non-metabolized hydrophilic \u03b2-adrenoceptor blocker, in rats. Pretreatment with itraconazole (ICZ, P-gp inhibitor, 50 mg/kg) for 30 min before oral administration of NDL (10 mg/kg) significantly increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC\u2080\u208b\u221e)of NDL by 1.7-fold compared with control. Intragastric administration of dexamethasone (DEX, 8 mg/kg) for 4 consecutive days increased P-gp level in the intestine and the liver. In line with this, DEX pre-treatment decreased maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) of NDL by 28% of control. To inhibit the intestinal Oatp1a5, naringin (NRG, 0.145 mg/kg) was preadministered orally for 30 min before the oral administrations of NDL or celiprolol (CEL, 10 mg/kg, Oatp1a5 substrate). Although NRG markedly reduced C(max) and AUC\u2080\u208b\u221e of CEL by 60% and 65% of control, respectively, little difference was observed in the plasma concentration of NDL between NRG and control. These results suggest that P-gp is greatly involved in the pharmacokinetics of NDL, while the involvement of Oatp1a5 in the pharmacokinetics of NDL may be less than that of celiprolol in rats.", 
    "240": "Electroacupuncture (EA) is a novel therapy based on traditional acupuncture combined with modern eletrotherapy that is currently being investigated as a treatment for acute ischemic stroke. Here, we studied whether acute EA stimulation improves tissue and functional outcome following experimentally induced cerebral ischemia in mice. We hypothesized that endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-mediated perfusion augmentation was related to the beneficial effects of EA by interventions in acute ischemic injury. EA stimulation at Baihui (GV20) and Dazhui (GV14) increased cerebral perfusion in the cerebral cortex, which was suppressed in eNOS KO, but there was no mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) response. The increased perfusion elicited by EA were completely abolished by a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) blocker (atropine), but not a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blocker (propranolol), an \u03b1-adrenergic receptor blocker (phentolamine), or a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) blocker (mecamylamine). In addition, EA increased acetylcholine (ACh) release and mAChR M3 expression in the cerebral cortex. Acute EA stimulation after occlusion significantly reduced infarct volume by 34.5% when compared to a control group of mice at 24 h after 60 min-middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) (moderate ischemic injury), but not 90-min MCAO (severe ischemic injury). Furthermore, the impact of EA on moderate ischemic injury was totally abolished in eNOS KO. Consistent with a smaller infarct size, acute EA stimulation led to prominent improvement of neurological function and vestibule-motor function. Our results suggest that acute EA stimulation after moderate focal cerebral ischemia, but not severe ischemia improves tissue and functional recovery and ACh/eNOS-mediated perfusion augmentation might be related to these beneficial effects of EA by interventions in acute ischemic injury.",

Ninety cases were selected following certain inclusion and exclusion criteria. Result showed that the differences in duration, frequency and severity of attack were reduced in all groups but the differences among the groups were not significant (p>0.05). However, compared with amitriptyline and pizotifen, the propranolol group needed tablet paracetamol as abortive therapy less frequently which was statistically significant (p<0.05). All the drugs were well tolerated with minimum adverse effects.", 
    "242": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae induced stomatal closure in a dose-dependent manner on Vicia faba L. (cv. Daqingpi). Using pharmacological inhibitors in this study, we found that stomatal closure was completely inhibited by salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) and reduced glutathione (GSH), whereas slightly inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI), suggesting that H2O2 was mostly produced by cell wall peroxidases. The specific NO scavenger (cPTIO), NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) and sodium azide (NaN3; inhibitor of nitrate reductase) prevented yeast-induced stomatal closure, suggesting that NO in guard cells of V.\u00a0faba is derived from both NOS-like enzyme and nitrate reductase. Results of HgCl2 and \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (ME) treatment (as a functional inhibitor of water channels and its reversing agent, respectively) suggest that water channels are involved in yeast-induced stomatal movements. CoCl2 (the blocker of calcium channel), LaCl3 (Ca(2+) antagonist) and EGTA (Ca(2+) chelator) also impaired yeast-induced stomatal closure. Thus, it is concluded that H2O2, NO, water channels and Ca(2+) are involved in yeast-induced stomatal closure.", 
    "243": "Ephedrine (Eph) is one of alkaloids that has been isolated from the ancient herb ephedra (ma huang) and is used as the treatment of asthma, hypotension and fatigue. However, its molecular mechanism remains unknown. Thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) is a redox regulating protein, which has various biological activities, including regulating transcription factor DNA binding activity and neuroprotection. In this study, we found that Eph induced Trx-1 expression, which was inhibited by propranolol (\u03b2-adrenergic receptor inhibitor), but not by phenoxybenzamine (\u03b1-adrenergic receptor inhibitor) in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. Moreover, the increase of Trx-1 expression was inhibited by SQ22536 (adenylyl cyclase inhibitor) and H-89 (protein kinase A inhibitor). Interestingly, the effect of Eph on dopamine- and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein (DARPP-32) was similar to Trx-1. Thus, the relationship between Trx-1 and DARPP-32 was further studied. The DARPP-32 siRNA significantly reduced Trx-1 expression, but Trx-1 siRNA did not exchange DARPP-32. These results suggested that Eph induced the Trx-1 expression through \u03b2-adrenergic receptor/cyclic AMP/PKA/DARPP-32 signaling pathway. Furthermore, Eph induced PKA-mediated cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation. Down-regulation of DARPP-32 expression decreased phosphorylated CREB. In addition, Eph had a significant effect on the viability of the rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells through \u03b2-adrenergic receptors. Trx-1 may play an important role in the actions of Eph.",

These measures include type and timing of prophylactic antibiotics, maintenance of perioperative normothermia, appropriate hair removal, early discontinuation of urinary catheters, appropriate venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, and use of preoperative beta-blockers.", 
    "247": "As national quality measures are implemented across an increasing number of specialties, the expansions will likely affect plastic surgery. These measures are evidence based and validated across a diverse group of surgical specialties, resulting in improved measured outcomes. Plastic surgeons would benefit by actively providing leadership as these and similar measures are implemented."
