    "0": "The effects of glucagon injection on temperature regulation and some metabolic parameters were studied in the pigeon. Glucagon (100 microng/kg) always inhibited shivering and caused a fall in the oxygen consumption and body temperature of the unanesthetized pigeon at + 6 degrees C. At + 34 degrees C, the same dose of glucagon had no effect on these parameters. At 22 degrees C, glucagon produced an elevation in plasma free fatty acid (FFA) and blood glucose levels. The rise in FFA at 22 degrees C coincided with the suppression of shivering at 6 degrees C. The glucagon-mediated rise in plasma FFA, but not glucose level, was potentiated by cold ambient temperature. Adrenergic blocking agents given prior to glucagon did not abolish its effects. Phentolamine even prolonged the absence and accelerated the suppression of shivering. A dissociation in the mechanisms by which catecholamines and glucagon suppress shivering is suggested. Although mobilizing energy reserves, glucagon does not seem to be calorigenic in the pigeon at this dose. The interpretation of the changes in plasma FFA levels is discussed in relation to fuel consumption during shivering.", 
    "1": "Infusions of epinephrine or levarterenol bitartrate into a rabbit nerve-muscle preparation decreased the force of the evoked twitch of anterior tibial and gastrocnemius-soleus muscles. The adverse effect of the catecholamines was not directly on skeletal muscle. The alpha-receptor blocking drug phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride prevented the adverse effect of the catecholamines if it was given prior to catecholamine infusions and unmasked a weak augmentation of twitch tension. Taken with the finding of abnormal accumulation of catecholamine in human dystrophic muscles, the production of an experimental myopathy resembling human dystrophy by the monoamine oxidase inhibitor pargyline hydrochloride, and the finding of excessive levels of catecholamines in the tissues and urine of dystrophic animals, these experiments support the hypothesis that catecholamines could play a pathogenetic role in some dystrophic diseases of muscle.", 
    "2": "In many patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, it is difficult to prevent an excessive ventricular rate under stress, even with high levels of digoxin in the blood. The effect of adding beta-adrenergic blockade with practolol to digoxin on the heart rate at rest and during low-grade controlled exercise was investigated in 28 patients with chronic atrial fibrillation and in ten normal control subjects who were receiving maintenance dosages (0.25 to 0.75 mg) of digoxin. In atrial fibrillation, therapy with practolol decreased the mean heart rate at rest from 99.8 beats per minute to 77.5 beats per minute (23 percent reduction; P less than 0.01) and during mild exercise from 148.9 beats per minute to 105.4 beats per minute (29 percent) reduction (P less than 0.001). Fifteen patients had clinically significant heart failure; therapy with practolol did not worsen it. Reversible side effects were detected in two patients. When therapy with digoxin is not sufficient to control atrial fibrillation, the addition of a beta-adrenergic blocking agent is recommended as adjunctive treatment in selected patients.", 
    "3": "The effects of the ionophore X-537A on mechanical function and on ionic exchange were studied in the isolated, arterially perfused rabbit interventricular septum. X-537A produced an initial positive inotropic response which was, however, transient in this preparation and appeared to be dependent on an effect of the ionophore on catecholamines. The positive inotropy gave way to a progressive decline in force development which was unrelated to the action of catecholamines and was not accompanied by the development of contracture. Isotope uptake experiments revealed that coincident with this decline in force development there was a continuous net loss of tissue K+ and a net gain of Na+. X-537A (5 micronM) perfused for 20 minutes resulted in a net K+ loss of 50.2 +/- 4.6 mmol/kg dry weight and a net Na+ gain of 74.0 +/- 4.5 mmol/kg dry weight. Isotope washout experiments confirmed that the entire net loss of K+ could be accounted for by increased K+ efflux. X-537A did not alter Na+ efflux nor did it have any detectable effect on 45Ca exchange of the perfused septum in which the ability to detect net movements is at a level of approximately +/- 550 micron mol/kg dry weight. On removal of the ionophore the decline in force development ceased and reversed to near control levels and the progressive ionic changes ceased. However, despite the near total recovery of contractile function the Na+ and K+ levels remained at values little different from those reached at the termination of X-537A perfusion. In addition, after removal of the ionophore, we found that K+ exchange rate remained significantly less than control and, furthermore, a kinetic inhomogeneity of tissue K+ was observed. The results emphasize a dissociation between cellular Na+ and K+ content and function following the ionic perturbations induced by the ionophore.", 
    "4": "The acute hemodynamic effects of 50 mg. of the alpha- and beta-receptor blocking agent AH 5158, administered intravenously, on the systemic and pulmonary circulation were studied in 13 hypertensive patients at rest in the supine and erect positions, and during exercise, with right heart and brachial artery catheterization. AH 5158 induced a significant fall of systemic blooc pressures under all conditions, whereas the pulmonary systolic and mean pressures were lower at rest and unaltered during exercise. The left ventricular filling pressure largely remained unchanged. Blood pressure was lowered predominantly by a reduction in systemic vascular resistance together with a reduction in cardiac output. These effects were particularly pronounced in the erect position and during exercise. Cardiac output was lowered solely by the reduction of heart rate; stroke volume was unchanged or even increased. The arterial-mixed venous oxygen difference increased in the erect position and during exercise. The pattern of AH 5158-induced hemodynamic adaptation comprising a reduction of both vascular resistance and cardiac output, without evidence of significant negative inotropic action, offers a novel basis for treating hypertension with a single drug. Its pharmacological and hemodynamic profile suggests considerable potential in the treatment of hypertensive patients.", 
    "5": "The belligerence of 7 patients who had suffered an acute brain insult was effectively controlled by propranolol in doses of 60 to 320 mg per day. Of the 7 patients, 3 were treated in the acute stage after a stroke, a severe closed head injury, and a gunshot wound of the brain, respectively. A chronic postconcussion syndrome associated with chronic irritability was present in 2, and 2 were not chronically irritable but suffered from intermittent attacks of explosive rage in response to minor irritations. In all instances the belligerent behavior was controlled without inducing general sedation.", 
    "6": "Plasma thyroxine (T4), 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (T3) and 3,3',5'-triiodothyronine (rT3) were measured in 16 patients with Graves' disease. Patients were studied under the following conditions: first without any treatment, then, during beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol, and finally after euthyroidism had been attained by carbimazole. During propranolol T3/T4 ratio decreased, whereas T4 remained unchanged. After carbimazole T3/T4 ratio returned to its pretreatment value. rT3/T4 ratio showed opposite changes. These results suggest that peripheral conversion of T4 into T3 and rT3 in hyperthyroidism is, at least partly, dependent on the functional status of the beta-adrenergic system. Suppressed peripheral conversion of T4 into T3 during beta-adrenergic blocking agents may contribute to the beneficial effects of these drugs in thyrotoxicosis.", 
    "7": "Propranolol, in the presence of calcium, causes marked K efflux from human red blood cells (high K, low Na). The studies reported here indicate this effect of propranolol is specific for K and does not represent a nonspecific permeability increase for intracellular cations to leave the cell. Amphotericin-treated human RBC's (high Na, low K) and dog RBC's (high Na, low K) both gain K and increase in size when incubated in a K-medium containing propranolol and calcium. No effect was noted when cat RBC's (high Na, low K) were similarly treated. Propranolol, independent of added calcium, also inhibited the normally increased Na efflux observed when dog RBC's are suspended in K-medium. These species differences in response to propranolol thus may serve as a focus for elucidating the mechanism by which this drug alters normal membrane physiology. The unique drug effect on Na permeability of canine erythrocytes also may be a useful probe for the study of dog RBC volume regulation.", 
    "8": "The effects of 120 mg propranolol and 15 mg pindolol daily on positional tremor of 24 patients with benign essential tremor were analyzed with a double-blind crossover trial and electrical tremor recording. Compared with the placebo effect, tremor amplitude was smaller under propranolol and larger under pindolol, whereas the frequency did not change.", 
    "9": "1. The effects of glyceryl trinitrate on the coronary vasculature and on the contractility of the ventricular myocardium were investigated by the use of papillary muscle preparations of the dog, and that on the sino-atrial node activity by the use of sino-atrial node preparations of the dog. The papillary muscle preparation was cross-circulated through the anterior septal artery and the sino-atrial node preparation through the sinus node artery from a donor dog. The papillary muscles were driven at a rate of 120 beats/min. Drugs were injected close-arterially. 2. Glyceryl trinitrate, in doses of 0-03-100 microgram, produced dose-related increases in blood flow and developed tension. An increase in developed tension caused by 100 microgram of glyceryl trinitrate amounted to about 24% of the basal developed tension. Large doses of glyceryl trinitrate (100-300 microgram) produced a negative inotropic effect after a positive one in some preparations. 3. The positive inotropic effect of glyceryl trinitrate was not modified by propranolol, excluding a possible participation of an adrenergic mechanism. 4. Glyceryl trinitrate in large doses failed to modify the positive inotropic effect of calcium chloride. 5. Glyceryl trinitrate in a wide range of doses (0-03-100 microgram) had virtually no effect on sino-atrial node activity.", 
    "10": "Propanolol, minoxidil, and clofibrate, three different classes of pharmacological agents used clinically in various conditions related to atherosclerosis, were shown not to have any intrinsic potentiating effects on the development of atherosclerosis in stumptail macaques fed an atherogenic diet. We did obtain, however, some results that suggest that clofibrate and propranolol may exert some beneficial actions.", 
    "11": "The treatment of high blood pressure prevents death from congestive heart failure, hypertensive nephropathy, and encephalopathy, and strokes from cerebral arteriolar disease (lacunes, hemorrhage from microaneurysms). However, atherosclerosis, manifested as coronary artery disease is just as frequent a cause of death in well-controlled hypertensives as in poorly-controlled patients. Increasing evidence suggests that increased blood velocity, by causing turbulence and high shear rates at the endothelial surface of arteries, may be important in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Turbulence has been observed in cerebral berry aneurysms. In order to measure the effects of antihypertensive agents on blood velocity, a new method of analysing Doppler ultrasound velocity recordings has been developed. Studies in Rhesus monkeys show the following: In doses which reduce diastolic pressure by 13-28%, propranolol decreased mean blood velocity (MV) by 17%, clonidine decreased MV by 14%, while methyldopa increased MV 12%, and hydralazine increased MV by 52%. (p less than .00001). It is hypothesized that enlargement of berry aneurysms, the progression of cerebral atherosclerosis, and embolism from carotid lesions might all be decreased by the selection of antihypertensive agents which decrease blood velocity.", 
    "12": "1. The existence and functional significance of Na channels in pancreatic beta-cell membranes were investigated by studying the effects of the plant alkaloid veratridine on the temporal release of insulin from perfused isolated rat islets of Langerhans.2. 100 muM veratridine evoked a sustained threefold increase in insulin release which was almost completely inhibited by 3 muM tetrodotoxin (TTX). This action of TTX was rapidly reversible.3. The simultaneous presence of 100 muM propranolol, 100 muM phenoxy-benzamine and 10 muM atropine did not alter the magnitude of the response to 100 muM veratridine, indicating that the action of veratridine on the beta-cells was direct and was not mediated via the release of neurotrans-mitters from nerve endings within the islets.4. (45)Ca uptake by isolated islets in static incubation was increased almost threefold by 100 muM veratridine. This increase was completely inhibited by the simultaneous presence of 3 muM TTX.5. Replacement of Na(o) by choline caused a transient fourfold increase in insulin release which was associated with an increase in the uptake of (45)Ca from the extracellular space of similar magnitude. Subsequent exposure of islets to 100 muM veratridine still evoked some insulin release but this only achieved 32% of that secreted by islets exposed to veratridine in medium of normal [Na](o).6. The addition of 2.5 mM CoCl(2) to the medium caused a 62.5% inhibition of veratridine-mediated insulin release.7. In Ca-free medium supplemented with 1 mM EGTA, 100 muM veratridine evoked insulin release of equal magnitude and of similar temporal relationship to that obtained in the presence of normal [Ca](o).8. A twofold increase in insulin release that occurred in the 15 min period immediately following exposure to 1 mM ouabain was completely independent of [Ca](o). Subsequent ouabain-evoked release became increasingly dependent on [Ca](o).9. Tetrodotoxin (3 muM) inhibited the first phase of insulin release evoked by 16.7 mMd-glucose by 37% and the second phase by 20%.10. Both Na and Ca appear capable of entering through Na channels opened in the beta-cell membrane by veratridine. The increase in [Na](i), resulting from the veratridine mediated increase in P(Na+), causes depolarization of the beta-cell membrane with a consequent opening of voltage-sensitive, Co(2+)-blockable channels for additional Ca entry. An increase in [Na](i) also increases [Ca](i) by altering the equilibria of intracellular Ca-sequestering mechanisms. The small but significant reduction of glucose-mediated insulin release by TTX indicates that glucose has a rather weak action on the Na channel and a more pronounced effect on the voltage-dependent Co(2+)-blockable Ca channel.", 
    "13": "Guttae atenolol 4% (Tenormin), a pure beta1-blocking (i.e., cardioselective) drug, produced a median overall fall of 5-6 mmHg (range 3-2 to 13-2 mmHg) in the first tonometrised eyes of 7 patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension and 1 with closed-angle glaucoma (off any treatment for the whole of the day preceding each test day) after allowance for an 'effect' of guttae saline 0-9%, in a double-masked, cross-over trial. By a Wilcoxon matched pairs rank test this was significant at the P less than 0-05 level. The median overall fall of 3-5 mmHg (range 0-8 to 10-8 mmHg) in the second-tonometrised eyes of 7 patients (1 of the 8 contributed only 1 eye) was also significant (P less than 0-05). In 2 patients who had been treated with guttae atenolol 4% daily 3 X for 1 and 2 months there is evidence that, on replacing the atenolol 4% with saline 0-9%, a rise of pressure of around 3 mmHg occurred 2 and 3 and 5 days later, i.e., the drug still retained its effectivity (slightly reduced) after 1 and 2 months.", 
    "14": "The ocular hypotensive effect of single oral doses of (a) atenolol (50 mg), (b) acetazolamide (500 mg), (c) atenolol (50 mg) and acetazolamide (500 mg) in combination, and (d) vehicle (inert tablets) were compared in 8 patients with glaucoma. In this single-dose, double-masked trial the combination was observed as most effective in reducing ocular tension. Both the combination and atenolol performed markedly better than vehicle. That acetazolamide did not reduce ocular tension significantly more than vehicle is probably explained by relatively low initial ocular tensions. There was no evidence of interaction between atenolol and acetazolamide in this study. Acetazolamide probably remains the first-choice oral medication for glaucoma. It is cautiously suggested that beta-blocking drugs may have a future therapeutic role, but longer-term studies on larger numbers will be required to establish this.", 
    "15": "Placebo and topical atenolol (Tenormin), a selective beta1-adrenergic blocking substance with no intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane-stabilising properties, were tested in 16 patients with ocular hypertension in a double-blind cross-over trial. Three different concentrations of atenolol (1, 2, and 4%) were investigated. After a single instillation there was a statistically significant fall in mean intraocular pressure (IOP) with all the concentrations after one hour, with a maximum after two to three hours. The effect had passed off after seven hours. In multiple-dose studies with applications three times a day for seven days there was a statistically significant fall in the mean IOP on the first day of treatment (all three concentrations), which persisted throughout the week. In the single-dose study only a slight dose-dependence was observed. This could not be confirmed in the multiple-dose trial. Pupil size, corneal sensitivity, systemic blood pressure, and heart rate were unaffected. No side effects were noted. Thus topically applied atenolol lowers IOP in patients with ocular hypertension and may be clinically useful.", 
    "16": "The adverse reactions of antihypertensive agents are reviewed, including their clinical implications and suggested methods of preventing, detecting and managing them. The drugs discussed are: (1) diuretics--thiazides, furosemide, ethacrynic acid and spironolactone; (2) sympatholytics--reserpine, methyldopa, guanethidine, propranolol and clonidine; (3) vasodilators--hydralazine, prazosin and minoxidil. It is suggested that cooperative multi-disciplinary efforts should be undertaken to counteract the factors which contribute to improper use of antihypertensive agents.", 
    "17": "The antihypertensive effect of a new beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, l-bunolol, was evaluated in 11 hospitalized hypertensive patients of whom four belonged to the high-renin, five to the normal-renin, and two to the low-renin subgroup. There was a significant decrease in blood pressure in most patients, often to normal. Moreover, plasma renin levels were nearly always markedly suppressed, and this suppression preceded the fall in blood pressure. While most high and normal renin patients responded, the numbers of patients within each subgroup were too small to correlate the blood pressure responses with changes in renin levels. There was a significant induced decrease in aldosterone excretion, which usually paralleled the renin suppression. Pulse rate was also consistently reduced during treatment. No weight gain was observed, except in one patient who developed overt congestive cardiac failure. No other side effects were recorded. Ii is concluded that l-bunolol is another beta-blocking drug with significant antihypertensive action. It was found to be effective in cases that were resistant to propranolo. It is well tolerated and safe to use, provided that early evidence of fluid retention is sought for and treated immediately.", 
    "18": "The possibility of using pindolol on a once-a-day schedule was investigated in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. Eighteen patients whose blood pressure responded satisfactorily to thrice-daily administration has a similar response to the single daily dose (p greater than 0.05). The advantages of once-daily pindolol therapy as well as some of the biochemical changes produced by the drug are commented upon.", 
    "19": "Two patients with hemobilia are presented. The first patient, with alcoholic liver disease, had a percutaneous liver biopsy. Subsequently he developed jaundice, with an enlarged tender gallbladder, biliary colic, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Hemobilia was demonstrated by superselective hepatic angiography and bleeding was stopped by intraarterial infusion of epinephrine and propranolol. The second patient, with primary biliary cirrhosis at an advanced stage, had a percutaneous liver biopsy followed by gastrointestinal bleeding, severe abdominal pain, and finally death. In both cases hemobilia was suggested by gastroduodenoscopy.", 
    "20": "In acute tests set up on rats subject to investigations was the significance of alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors in the mechanism of the catecholamines influence on the natriuretic function of the rats' kidneys. Phentolamine did not obstruct the stimulating action of epinephrine on the tubular reabsorption of sodium, but perverted its inhibitory effect on the glomerular filtration. Inderal did not affect the glomerular action of epinephrine, but fully prevented its effect on reabsorption of sodium in the tubules of the kidney. When used in a dose failing to produce any significant changes in the systemic arterial pressure isopropylnorepinephrine increased glomerular filtration, but inhibited excretion of sodium, augmenting its tubular reabsorption. The resulting implication is that alpha-adrenoreceptors participate in the mechanism of the catecholamines regulation of the intrarenal hemodynamics, whereas beta-adrenoreceptors play the part of mediating their activating influence on the tubular transport of sodium.", 
    "21": "Sensitivity of the cardiovascular system of patients suffering from thyrotoxicosis to exogenous adrenaline was studied. In difference from healthy persons, a single injection of 1 ml of 0.1% adrenaline solution to patients with thyrotoxicosis of moderate severity caused a significant elevation of the arterial pressure, frequency of cardiac contractions, systolic and minute output, myocardiac inotropism indices. An increased inderal reactivity was noted in these patients. Thus, greater sensitivity to adrenergic actions and to beta-adrenoblock was observed in conditions of an excess of thyroid hormones. A coincident administration of adrenaline and inderal balanced the positive chronoinotropic effect of the former, but failed to prevent the hypertensive effect of adrenaline.", 
    "22": "The influence of haloperidol and propranolol on aggressiveness, motility exploration and general behavior, and the activity or level of adenylate cyclase, cyclic AMP, and protein kinase in the brain of mice treated with LSD was tested. Haloperidol evidently, and propranolol slightly less, inhibited the behavioral and biochemical changes induced by LSD. It is suggested that psychotomimetic effects of LSD depend on complex action of this compound on aminergic receptors in the central nervous system, and the antipsychotic effectiveness of haloperidol and propranolol is related to interaction of these drugs and LSD with the receptors for monoamines participating in the central neuromediation.", 
    "23": "The effect of chronic oral administration of propranolol (39--80 mg/Kg/day, for 21--27 days) on blood pressure, plasma renin concentration, and heart rate were studied in 2 types of renovascular hypertensive rats; one-kidney type with normal plasma renin and two-kidney type with high plasma renin. No significant change was observed in the blood pressure of either model during the administration of propranolol in spite of a significant reduction of heart rate. Plasma renin concentration showed a trend of suppression in two-kidney type rats, but this change was not significant. There was no suppression in one-kidney type rats. These results suggest that the beta-adrenergic system may not play a major role either in regulating plasma renin level or in maintaining the blood pressure in renovascular hypertensive rats.", 
    "24": "The enhancement of the brain acetyl cholinesterase (ACHE) activity in rats by the intraventricular injection of adrenaline or dibutiryl analogue cyclic adenosine-3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) was shown to be due to the enzyme inductive synthesis. ACHE induction manifests itself more in the subcortical white matter than in the cortex. The stimulating effect of adrenaline on the ACHE activity is suppressed under the beta-adrenoreceptor block, while the cAMP effect remains unchanged. On the contrary, the block of the alpha-adrenoreceptors stimulates the enzyme synthesis induction. The effects of adrenaline and cAMP are of the same direction and are realized through the beta-adrenoreceptors. The enhancement of ACHE activity during the block of the alpha-adrenoreceptors is accounted for by the elimination of their inhibitory influence on the beta-adrenoreceptors.", 
    "25": "Aldosterone, sodium, and potassium excretion in the urine of six newborns (5, 6, and 9 days), seven infants (2, 3, 4, and 6 months) and eight children (4, 5, 6, 12, and 15 years) was determined at 3-hour intervals during a 24-hour period via gas chromatography and/or flame photometry. The circadian rhythmn of aldosterone excretion could already be ascertained in the 5-day-old newborns. All babies and children examined showed a distinct increase in aldosterone excretion between 3 and 6 am or 6 and 9 am. On the overage, 41% of the total daily amount was excreted between 3 and 9 am. Excretion of sodium and potassium was very low for the newborns and infants. Only in small children and in school children did sodium excretion and the molecular relationship Na/k in urine have a statistically significant negative correlation with the excretion of aldosterone. After long-term prednisone therapy, the maximum amount of aldosterone was excreted in the afternoon. The findings after treatment with propranolol and administration of dexamethasone over a three-day period were similar.", 
    "26": "The activity of soluble protein kinase (ATP:protein phosphotransferase,EC 2.7.1.37) and pattern of nuclear protein phosphorylation was monitored in cultured rat pineal glands during the induction of serotonin N-acetyltransferase (acetyl-CoA:serotonin N-acetyltransferase;EC 2.3.1.5)by l-isoproterenol. A nuclear protein appears to be phosphorylated during the early stages of enzyme induction but is not phosphorylated at later stages of induction. This correlates well with the need for RNA synthesis associated with the induction process. The nuclear protein was also phosphorylated when the pineal glands were treated with dibutyryl 3':5'-cyclic AMP. The soluble protein kinase activity appeared to decline during mid-to-late stages of enzyme induction, but there was no concomitant increase in the particulate protein kinase activity.", 
    "27": "We studied the performance of ventricular muscle and cardiac function of hearts from rats conditioned by swimming (CH) and from sedentary rats (SH) in an isolated working heart apparatus modified to measure end-diastolic volume by dye dilution. Instantaneous aortic flow, left ventricular (LV) pressure and oxygen consumption were measured. Heart rate and mean aortic pressure were kept constant, and atrial filling pressure was varied from 5 to 20 cm H2O. Heart weights of SH and CH were equal and end-diastolic pressures and volumes were similar at all atrial pressures. However, ejection fraction, calculated circumferential fiber velocity, peak systolic pressure, peak aortic flow, cardiac output, and stroke work were all greater in CH than in SH, and the differences increased as atrial pressure was increased. Maximal negative dP/dt was greater in CH than SH at all preloads (P less than 0.001). Oxygen consumption of CH was increased in proportion to the increase in work. These results indicate that the improved pumping performance of CH is due to a change in ventricular muscle function. Faster relaxation is a prominent effect of physical training on the rat heart and may foster more complete filling at high heart rates.", 
    "28": "The place of pacemakers in the treatment of tachyarrhythmias has expanded far beyond the initial role in the brady-tachy syndrome, of providing a \"minimum guaranteed rate\" while medications suppress the tachycardia. Techniques have been developed for prevention, termination, and duplication of a patient's spontaneous tachycardia under safe catheterization laboratory conditions. Combined with accumulating information about the normal responses to electrophysiologic stresses, these techniques have led to a new dimension in arrhythmia control. Most tachycardias previously felt to be refractory can be controlled after serial electrophysiologic-pharmacologic testing, during which sequential pharmacologic and pacer regimens are tested until a combination is found which prevents induction of tachycardias, and/or a pace mode is found which reliably terminates the tachycardia. Use of such an approach reduces hospital admissions and referral for surgery, and eliminates prolonged hospitalization for assessment of therapy in patients with infrequent but potentially lethal spontaneous tachycardias.", 
    "29": "The antiarrhythmic action of the beta-blocking drug, acebutolol, was evaluated in patients with frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). In the 12 hours following administration of a single 300 mg oral dose, 8 of 10 patients showed a greater than 50% reduction in PVC frequency, and statistical analysis indicated that PVC reduction persisted for 10 hours after the single dose. Analysis of plasma concentrations of acebutolol and an acetyl metabolite indicated that after single oral doses of plasma concentrations of the metabolite exceed those of unchanged acebutolol. When patients were studied during periods of 300 mg doses every 8 hours, eight of 11 showed a 70% reduction in PVC frequency, and analysis showed that the therapeutic effect was present throughout the 24-hour monitoring period. Acebutolol slowed the heart rate and prolonged the PR interval without affecting the QT interval. Significant clinical or laboratory toxicity was not encountered. In the small group studied, acebutolol was found to be safe and effective for short-term administration to patients with frequent PVCs and possessed a relatively long duration of antiarrhythmic action.", 
    "30": "Secretion from the granular glands of Xenopus laevis skin was stimulated by alpha-adrenergic agonists, an effect which was blocked by alpha-adrenergic antagonists and inhibited by beta-adrenergic agonists, db-cAMP and diazoxide. The inhibition by isoprenaline and salbutamol, but not that by diazoxide, was blocked by a beta-adrenergic antagonist. It is concluded that the myoepithelial cells surrounding the secretory compartment of the granular glands bear alpha and beta adrenoceptors, and that the beta receptors comprise, or at least include beta2 receptors.", 
    "31": "Dobutamine (DOB) showed a dose dependent positive introphic effect on the right ventricular muscle of vagotomized Beagle dogs under pentobarbital anesthesia. Positve inotropic effects of other catecholamines (CA) decreased in the following order; isoproterenol (Iso, 115) greater than norepinephrine (NE, 15) greater than DOB (1) greater than dopamine (DA, 0.36). Brachiocephalic arterial flow was also increased by DOB with a positive inotropic effect in the right ventricular muscle. Though the positive inotropic effect of DOB was slightly decreased by pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine, such was almost completely antagonized by propranolol. Contractions of isolated cat papillary muscle driven by electrical stimulation (12 beats/min) were increased by CA in the following order; Iso (17) greater than NE (3) greater than epinephrine (2.5) greater than DOB (1) greater than DA (1 greater than). Activity of DOB to induce spontaneous contractions of papillary muscle was weakest among these CA. To determine the arrhythmogenic effect of these CA, coronary ligated Beagle dogs were employed, in which the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery was ligated. Arrhythmogenic activity of DOB was weaker than other CA employed both in early stages and 48 hr after coronary ligation. DOB shows good potential for treating acute cardiac insufficiency and cardiogenic shock, as effects on heart rate and blood pressure are weaker.", 
    "32": "Using the canine heart-lung preparation supported by a donor, effects of a new adrenergic beta-blocking agent, dl-1-(tert. butylamino)-3-[ (2-propinyloxy) phenoxy]-2-propanol hydrochloride (K\u00f6 1400), on cardiac function, myocardial metabolism, and coronary circulation were studied and compared with those of propranolol. Effects of this substance on the peripheral vascular bed were also studied in the perfused hindlimb preparation of the dog. K\u00f6 1400 produced a positive inotropic and chronotropic effect. Mechanical efficiency of the heart improved after K\u00f6 1400, while it lessened after propranolol. A decrease in the coronary flow was observed in association with a slight increase in myocardial O2 consumption, indicating that the substance exerted a direct constrictive effect on the coronary vasculature. As a beta-blocker, K\u00f6 1400 was found to be 2-3 times more effective than propranolol. The uptake of the free fatty acid (FFA) by the heart was increased by K\u00f6 1400 and the myocardial redox potential improved. In the perfused hindlimb preparation, intraarterial injection of K\u00f6 1400 resulted in a transient increase of the femoral blood flow for a decrease in the flow followed by a sustained decrease. With repeated administration a marked tachyphylaxis was observed.", 
    "33": "beta-Blocking actions of orally administered K\u00f6 1400 and tiprenolol, new beta-blocking agents, were studied in unanesthetized rats and dogs, using a fall of blood pressure and an increase in heart rate produced by isoproterenol as a measure of beta-receptor activation. Blood pressure was recorded from the aorta of the dog and the caudal artery of rat via indwelling catheter, and heart rate of the dog was recorded by a cardiotachometer triggered by R waves of the lead II electrocardiogram. Mean resting blood pressure was 116 mmHg in rats and 93 mmHg in dogs, and heart rate was 99 beats/min in dogs. Isoproterenol (0.5 microgram/kg) was injected via indwelling venous catheter. K\u00f6 1400, tiprenolol and propranolol inhibited the hypotension and tachycardia induced by isoproterenol at an oral dose level of 2 mg/kg or more. beta-blocking action in these preparations was found to be tiprenolol greater than K\u00f6 1400 greater than propranolol. Pharmacological half life of tiprenolol was longer than that of propranolol, whereas that of K\u00f6 1400 was shorter. No selectivity of beta-blocking actions was observed with all three beta-blockers. These findings are in agreement with the results obtained in isolated atrial and tracheal preparations of the guinea pig.", 
    "34": "The influence of some neuroleptic, adreno, sympatho- and cholinolytic substances on the development of experimental brain edema induced with nicotine was studied in tests conducted on rats. It was ascertained that marked antiedemic properties display drugs blocking the alpha-adrenoreceptors (phentolamine, dopegit), the neuroleptic chlorpromazine and central M-cholinolytics (benactizine). Weak action exert central H-cholinolytics (difacil trasentin) and the neuroleptic galoperidol. Sympatho- and beta-adrenolytics (guanethidine, alpha-methyltyrosine, obsidan), and also the neuroleptic triphthazine fail to prevent the development of an experimental brain edema. It is presumed that a brain edema induced with nicotine comes as a result of the catecholamines liberation and is also due to stimulation of alpha-adrenoreactive systems.", 
    "35": "The effect of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on the irreversible alpha-adrenoceptor blockade produced by phenoxybenzamine was studied in dogs. The pressor effects of adrenaline were revived after the inhibition by the alpha-receptor block by (+/-) propranolol, (-) INPEA, (+/-) MJ 1999 and (+/-) butoxamine. The enantiomers (+) propranolol and (+) INPEA were ineffective in this regard. (+/-) Practolol also did not revive the pressor effect of the amines. The alpha-receptor mediated effect of the amines, in the nictitating membrana-receptor blockade. It is concluded that (1) blockade of the peripheral (beta-2) receptors is essential for the revival of the pressor effects, (2) local anesthetic effect of the beta-antagonists is not involved. Further work using a series of doses of agonists and antagonists of alpha-and beta-receptors is indicated to clarify the nature of this drug-interaction.", 
    "36": "Chick cerebral beta-adrenoceptors have been characterised by measurement of cyclic AMP accumulation in brain slices and assessment of the specific binding of [3H]-propranolol to cerebral membranes. The binding of [3H]-propranolol was inhibited by beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists with affinities that correlated well with their ability to stimulate cyclic AMP formation or to antagonise the cyclic nucleotide accumulation induced by isoprenaline. The relative potencies of a number of drugs in several cerebral regions suggests that the receptors may be of the beta2 subtype. Regional distribution studies revealed the highest density of binding sites in the cerebellum and lowest in the optic lobes. However, the concentration of [3H]-propranolol that produced half-maximal specific binding was similar in all regions. Subcellular fractionation of cerebral hemisphere tissue demonstrated an enrichment of [3H]-propranolol binding sites in the synaptosomal and microsomal fractions. There are discrepancies between the topographical distribution of beta-adrenoceptor binding sites and the endogenous noradrenaline level in chick brain and between the number of binding sites and the intrinsic activity of beta-adrenoceptor mediated cyclic AMP formation.", 
    "37": "Using isolated, blood-perfused atrium preparation of the dogs, the effect of stretch on sinus rate was studied in 11 preparations. Stretching usually produced sinus acceleration in all 11 spontaneously beating atria. Within a range of 0--30 Gm, greater degrees of stretch produced greater degrees of sinus acceleration. During maintained stretch sinus rate slightly reduced but not to the control rate. On release from stretch sinus rate immediately returned to the control rate, and there was occasionally a slowing to rates lower than control in verapamil treated preparations. Atropine, adrenergic beta-receptor blocking agents, propranolol and carteolol, verapamil, and tetrodotoxin did not greatly modify responses to stretching.", 
    "38": "1. Intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) administered vasopressin (0.001-1.0 u) in dogs anaesthetized with chloralose produced adose-dependent increase in urine flow with a concomitant decrease in the levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) in jugular vein blood. 2. Higher doses of vasopressin (1.5-2.0 u, i.c.v) on the other hand had an antidiuretic effect and produced an increase in blood ADH level. 3. Pretreatment (i.c.v.) with a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist completely blocked the diuretic response of low doses of vasopressin (i.c.v.) but did not influence the antidiuretic response obtained with high doses. 4. Repeated administration of vasopressin (1.0 u, i.c.v.) induced tachyphylaxis; central catecholamine depletion with tetrabenazine significantly inhibited the vasopressin-induced diuretic response. 5. It is concluded that intracerebroventricular vasopressin-induced changes in ADH secretion are mediated through the release of catecholamines in the central nervous system.", 
    "39": "1 The effects of noradrenaline upon the cardiovascular system of the rat, anaesthetized with pentobarbitone, have been investigated.2 Noradrenaline produces a dose-dependent increase in mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) which is due entirely to an increase in cardiac output; total peripheral vascular resistance (TPR) remains unchanged.3 Following beta-adrenoceptor blockade the pressor response to infused noradrenaline is enhanced and is now due mainly to an increase in TPR; the increment in cardiac output is reduced.4 After alpha-adrenoceptor blockade the pressor response is greatly reduced; the residual increase in MABP is due solely to an increase in cardiac output.5 After ganglion blockade resting cardiac output and TPR both fall, resulting in a reduction in MABP. The pressor response to noradrenaline is enhanced and is now due to increases in both TPR and in cardiac output.6 The cardiovascular response of the anaesthetized rat to noradrenaline can be explained in terms of classical alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor stimulation by the amine; the unusual form of the response may be due to an effective predominance of beta-adrenoceptor-mediated effects in this species.7 It is suggested that the failure of exogenous noradrenaline to produce a rise in TPR results from a balance between the alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated increase and beta-adrenoceptor-mediated decrease in this variable. However, this proposed balance is lost if resting vasoconstrictor tone is reduced by ganglion blockade.", 
    "40": "1 The effects of intravenously infused phenylephrine and isoprenaline upon the cardiovascular system of the rat anaesthetized with pentobarbitone, have been investigated.2 Phenylephrine produces a dose-dependent rise in mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) that is due mainly to an increase in total peripheral vascular resistance (TPR), though at all doses tested cardiac output was invariably raised.3 The increase in cardiac output was due in each instance to an increase in stroke volume, heart rate being unchanged. This increase in cardiac output is probably brought about by effects of phenylephrine on the capacitance vessels rather than by an effect on the heart.4 Evidence is presented to show that the effects of phenylephrine are mediated largely by alpha-adrenoceptors, but that beta-adrenoceptors which affect TPR are also stimulated by the amine.5 Isoprenaline produces a dose-dependent fall in MABP that is due entirely to a fall in TPR since the cardiac output increases.6 Unlike phenylephrine, the increase in cardiac output obtained with isoprenaline was achieved by an increase in heart rate while stroke volume remained close to control values. It is contended that the augmented venous return required for the elevated cardiac output results in this case mainly from the isoprenaline-induced fall in TPR which enhances transfer of blood from arteries to the veins.7 Evidence is presented to show that the effects of isoprenaline are mediated mainly by beta-adrenoceptors.8 Under the present experimental conditions the adrenoceptor-mediated cardiovascular changes are little modified reflexly by the arterial baroreceptors.", 
    "41": "Adrenergic blockers for beta-receptors were studied for inhibition of mitochrondrial CoQ10-enzymes. These enzymes are indispensable for the bioenegetics of the myocardium. Propranolol is frequently used to treat hypertension; in some patients, it depresses myocardial function as an adverse reaction. This side effect may be related to the inhibition by propranolol of CoQ10-enzymes of the myocardium. Timolol showed negligible inhibition of the CoQ10-enzyme, NADH-oxidase. Metoprolol was less inhibitory than propranolol. Five alprenolols showed inhibition which approached that of propranolol. The 1-isomer of alprenolol showed weak inhibition of another CoQ10-enzyme, succinoxidase, but the other beta-blockers were essentially non-inhibitory to this enzyme. The drug of choice is timolol, based on negligible inhibition of these bioenergetic enzymes of the heart, which correlates with its pharmacologically low cardiac depressant effects.", 
    "42": "Unwanted effects of beta-receptor blocking agents can be divided into three categories: 1. Those arising specifically from the pharmacologic, i.e., beta-blocking action. 2. Side effects not directly (or not with certainty) related to beta-blockade. 3. Adverse and potentially specific reactions to individual beta-blocking agents. Category 1 covers the majority of adverse effects (heart failure, severe bradycardia and hypotension, arterial insufficiency, increased airways resistance, gastrointestinal symptoms, hypoglycemia). These can largely be avoided by proper selection and preparation of patients. Category 2 covers cutaneous reactions (rashes, alopecia, pruritus), purpura (thrombocytopenic and nonthrombocytopenic) etc. as well as side effects attributable to the central nervous system (antianxiety effects, nightmares etc.). In the third category the \"oculo-cutaneous syndrome\" associated with practolol is discussed.", 
    "43": "Patients who had received long-term therapy with practolol and other beta-adrenergic receptor blocking drugs were examined ophthalmologically. Tear lysozyme concentration and serum autoantibodies (antinuclear antibodies, DNA-binding antibodies and intercellular cement substance antibodies) were measured. It was found that beta-adrenergic receptor blocking drugs may have a pharmacological effect on the lachrymal glands, but this was not associated with dry eyes or adverse reaction. Practolol was found to be capable of reducing tear lysozyme concentrations to very low levels, and this was initially associated with high titres of ICC antibody. No other drug tested produced these effects.", 
    "44": "A new fluorescent beta-adrenergic blocker, 9-amino-acridin propranolol (9-AAP), was administered intravenously to albino rats. Fluorescent aggregates of 9-AAP binding sites were concentrated in the vascular poles of the glomeruli in association with the preglomerular afferent arterioles. 9-AAP fluorescence was reduced following pretreatment with (+/-)- and (-)-propranolol and was less affected in rats pretreated by the (+)-racemic isomer. 9-AAP binding sites were also observed on the lining epithelium of the renal collecting system. Our data suggest that 9-AAP may label beta-adrenergic receptors in rat kidney.", 
    "45": "In pithed rats pretreated with propranolol changes occurred in the slopes of dose--pressor response curves to i.v. phenylephrine and noradrenaline but not to LD 3098, a pure alpha-adrenoceptor stimulant. In dogs, cats, and spontaneously hypertensive rats pretreated with an alpha-adrenoceptor blocker, i.v. phenylephrine induced vasodilatory responses which were antagonised by propranolol. These results indicate that phenylephrine, in addition to its known beta1-agonistic properties, stimulates the vascular beta2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "46": "Propranolol markedly increased the norepinephrine-induced maximal force in circular smooth muscle of the rat portal, mesenteric, renal and, to a lesser extent, femoral veins without affecting aortic or mesenteric artery responses to norepinephrine. Furthermore, two other beta receptor antagonists, practolol and N-isopropylmethoxamine, specifically enhanced maximal venous responses to norepinephrine. Contractions to norepinephrine, but not to serotonin, were increased by propranolol only in veins, even after the vasodilator, papaverine. The ability of propranolol to enhance norepinephrine-induced contraction in these rat veins paralleled the effectiveness of isoproterenol to relax such tissues. In addition, beta receptor antagonists enhanced the response of veins to the field stimulated release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerves. These data support the conclusion that beta adrenergic stimulation modulates norepinephrine-induced constriction in certain rat veins but not in the aorta or mesenteric artery.", 
    "47": "Nadolol-14C, 2,3-cis-5-(3-[(1,1-dimethylethyl)amino]-2-hydroxypropoxy)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2,3-naphthalenediol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent, was administered orally and intravenously at 2-mg doses to patients with mild cases of essential hypertension. Terminal plasma half-times after oral and intravenous doses were an average of 12.2 and 9.8 hours, respectively. After oral doses, an average of 24.6 and 76.9 per cent of the dose was excreted in urine and feces, respectively, whereas, after intravenous doses, an average of 72.9 and 23.3 per cent of the dose was excreted by the same routes. Calculations of absorption, based on urinary excretion and on areas under the plasma concentration-versus-time curves, indicated that oral doses of nadolol-14C were absorbed to the extent of 33.6+/-2.4 per cent (+/- S.E.). The average overall volume of distribution after intravenous administration was 2.09+/-0.51 1./kg (+/- S.E.), and the average volume of the central compartment was 0.30+/-0.04 1./kg. Only unchanged nadolol-14C was excreted in the urine and feces of patients after either oral or intravenous administration of the drug.", 
    "48": "Dose-response curves for propranolol and oxprenolol were studied in healthy volunteers, with a standardized excercise test and percentage reduction in excercise heart rate (EHR) as the index of drug effect. The dose-response curves obtained were compared with similar curves previously reported for sotalol, practolol, and atenolol with identical experimental methods. Two distinct types of response were identified: in the first, shown by propranolol and sotalol, increasing doses of the beta adrenoceptor-blocking drug continued to produce increasing effects to the limits of the dose levels examined; with the second (oxprenolol and practolol), increasing the dose initially resulted in substantial increase in effect but subsequently larger doses produced almost no increase in effect. Consideration of the additional properties of these beta adrenoceptor-blocking drugs revealed that both practolol and oxprenolol have intrinsic sympathomimetric activity (ISA), whereas propranolol and sotalol do not. In addition, practolol is cardioselective. Further investigation of the possible influence of ISA or cardioselectivity on beta adrenoceptor-blocking activity was undertaken by studying the effects of combinations of drugs on EHR. Sotalol produced greater effect when given 2 hr after sotalol, oxprenolol, practolol, or atenolol. When oxprenolol was given after sotalol or oxprenolol, or practolol was given after sotalol or practolol, there was no further increase in percentage reduction in EHR. When atenolol was given, the combinations of sotalol and atenolol together with two doses either of sotalol or atenolol all induced increases and similar final percentage reductions in EHR. Thus atenolol induces effects like those of sotalol, which are quite different from those of oxprenolol or practolol. The presence or absence of ISA would appear to be the important difference between these two groups of drugs: ISA would, therefore, appear to be demonstrated in man by flattening of the dose-response curves with exercise.", 
    "49": "Mechanisms by which beta-blocking agents decrease blood pressure and suppress renin release are incompletely understood. We previously demonstrated that renin release by kidney slices may be increased by beta-adrenergic agonists, and the present communication contains our results on the effects of 15 beta-blocking agents and angiotensin II on isoproterenol-stimulated renin release. None of the beta-blocking compounds inhibited basal renin release. Each agent was evaluated at concentrations ranging from 10-8 to 10-5 m and three different dose-response curve patterns were observed: (1) Metoprolol, acebutolol, labetalol, and d-propranolol had no effect on isoproterenol-stimulated renin release at any concentration, whereas pindolol and bufuralol demonstrated minimal inhibition at 10-5 m only. (2) Isoproterenol stimulation was completely inhibited when dl- or l-propranolol, alprenolol, and sotalol were administered at doses ranging between 5 x 10-6 and 10-6 m; but greater concentration of these agents resulted in reappearance of the isoproterenol response. (3) Dose-related inhibition was observed with practolol, oxprenolol, timolol, nadolol, and atenolol at concentrations ranging from 10-8 to 10-5 m. Basal renin release was significantly (P is less than 0.01) inhibited by angiotensin II at 10-6 m, which also inhibited isoproterenol-stimulated renin release in a dose-related fashion. [Sar1, Ala8] angiotensin II had no direct effects on either basal or isoproterenol-stimulated renin release, but blocked the inhibitory action of angiotensin II on these parameters.", 
    "50": "There are three different effects of beta-blocking agents on isoproterenol-stimulated renin release which can only partially be explained by their presently ascribed pharmacological properties. (Beta 1- and beta2-agonists, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, membrane-stabilizing actions). Angiotensin II inhibition of renin release appears to be functionally related to adrenergic pathways.", 
    "51": "The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that the vasodilation produced by intra-arterial injection of thrombin to the hindlimb of a dog may be caused by the secondary release or production of some vasodilating substance. The vasodilator response to thrombin was compared with the vasodilator response to acetylcholine, isoproterenol, histamine and serotonin before and after blockade with atropine, propranolol, phenergan or methyl-D-lysergic acid butanolamide (UML-491), respectively. Though the appropriate blocking agent blocked the vasodilator response to the respective drug, the thrombin-induced vasodilation was not blocked. These data support the hypothesis that thrombin-induced vasodilation is a response to the thrombin moiety.", 
    "52": "The effects of various doses of ethanol (ETOH) on spontaneous locomotor activity (SLMA) in mice were measured using photocell activity chambers. Of the 4 i.p. doses injected, the 2 lowest doses (0.5 and 1.0 g/kg) stimulated SLMA, the next higher dose (2.0 g/kg) produced a biphasic effect of depression followed by stimulation, and the highest dose (4.0 g/kg) depressed SLMA. The mechanism of the biphasic effect of the 2.0 g/kg dose was studied in tests with central catecholamine antagonists at various doses 30 min before ETOH. Doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg of propranolol, a beta-receptor blocker, significantly antagonized the depressant effect of ETOH but had no influence on the stimulant effect. High doses (10 and 20 mg/kg) of phentolamine, an alpha-receptor blocker, significantly antagonized the stimulant phase of ETOH action but had no significant effect on the depressant phase. All doses (0.062-0.250 mg/kg) of spiroperidol, a dopaminergic blocking drug, significantly enhanced the SLMA depression produced by ETOH. These results indicate that the SLMA-depressant effect of ETOH may be mediated by central \"beta-type\" receptors, that the SLMA-stimulant effect of ETOH may be mediated by central \"alpha-type\" receptors, and that at least part of ETOH's action may be due to dopaminergic mechanisms.", 
    "53": "The posterior hypothalamus of cats anaesthetized with pentobarbital sodium was superfused and electrically stimulated with a push-pull cannula. Superfusion of the hypothalamus with (+/-)-, (-)-propranolol, sotalol, practolol or metoprolol caused a concentration-dependent inhibiton of the pressor response to hypothalamic stimulation. (+/-)-Propranolol and a procaine concentration equi-anaesthetic to the concentration of (+/-)- and (-)-propranolol were ineffective. Lower concentrations of propranolol and metoprolol were needed to inhibit the pressor response than of sotalol or practolol. Superfusion with practolol and tolazoline impaired the pressor response to a greater extent than did superfusion with each of the drugs alone. Hypothalamic superfusion with isoproterenol elicited a concentration-dependent enhancement of the rise of blood pressure during electrical stimulation of the hypothalamus. It is concluded that beta-adrenorecptors are present in the posterior hypothalamus and that they are involved in the pressor response elicited by electrical stimulation of the hypothalamus. Propranolol and metoprolol seemed to possess a higher affinity to the beta-receptors of the hypothalamus than sotalol or practolol.", 
    "54": "The role of Ca2+ ions in alpha-adrenergic activation of hepatic phosphorylase was studied using isolated rat liver parenchymal cells. The activation of glucose release and phosphorylase by the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine was impaired in cells in which calcium was depleted by ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) treatment and restored by calcium addition, whereas the effects of a glycogenolytically equivalent concentration of glucagon on these processes were unaffected. EGTA treatment also reduced basal glucose release and phosphorylase alpha activity, but did not alter the level of cAMP or the protein kinase activity ratio (-cAMP/+cAMP) or impair viability as determined by trypan blue exclusion, ATP levels, or gluconeogenic rates. The effect of EGTA on basal phosphorylase and glucose output was also rapidly reversed by Ca2+, but not by other ions. Phenylephrine potentiated the ability of low concentrations of calcium to reactivate phosphorylase in EGTA-treated cells. The divalent cation inophore A23187 rapidly increased phosphorylase alpha and glucose output without altering the cAMP level, the protein kinase activity ratio, and the levels of ATP, ADP, or AMP, The effects of the ionophore were abolished in EGTA-treated cells and restored by calcium addition. Phenylephrine rapidly stimulated 45Ca uptake and exchange in hepatocytes, but did not affect the cell content of 45Ca at late time points. A glycogenolytically equivalent concentration of glucagon did not affect these processes, whereas higher concentrations were as effective as phenylephrine. The effect of phenylephrine on 45Ca uptake was blocked by the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phenoxybenzamine, was unaffected by the beta blocker propranolol, and was not mimicked by isoproterenol. The following conclusions are drawn: (a) alpha-adrenergic activation of phosphorylase and glucose release in hepatocytes is more dependent on calcium than is glucagon activation of these processes; (b) variations in liver cell calcium can regulate phosphorylase alpha levels and glycogenolysis; (c) calcium fluxes across the plasma membrane are stimulated more by phenylephrine than by a glycogenolytically equivalent concentration of glucagon. It is proposed that alpha-adrenergic agonists activate phosphorylase by increasing the cytosolic concentration of Ca2+ ions, thus stimulating phosphorylase kinase.", 
    "55": "Blood flow in the caudate nucleus was measured by the thermoclearance technique in non-anesthetized rabbits, accompanied by recording of electrocorticogram, systemic blood pressure, and Pao2 and Paco2 (mass spectrometry). Isoprenaline increased caudate nucleus blood flow and reduced systemic blood pressure. The beta2-receptor agonist, terbutaline, on the other hand, had only peripheral effects. The caudate nucleus flow response was selectively blocked by the beta1-receptor antagonist, practolol, whereas propranolol inhibited all effects of both agonists. Isoprenaline dilated isolated pieces of the tributary artery (middle cerebral) tested in cats, the effect being inhibited not only by propranolol but also by practolol. The results offer further evidence for the view that the beta-receptors in the cerebral vascular bed are of the beta1-type.", 
    "56": "The effects of exogenous thyroid hormones (thyroxine and triiodothyronine) on beta-adrenergic receptors in the rat myocardium were investigated. The potent beta-adrenergic antagonist, (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol, was used to directly estimate the number and affinity of beta-adrenergic receptors in rat heart membranes from control and hyperthyroid rats. Cardiac membranes from hyperthyroid rats contained 196 +/- 7 fmol of (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol binding sites/mg of protein which was significantly (p less than 0.005) greater than the number of binding sites (89 +/- 5 fmol/mg of protein) present in control membranes. The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) for the interaction of receptors with dihydroalprenolol was the same (2 to 15 nM) in membranes from control and hyperthyroid rats. Similarly, there was no significant difference between the control and hyperthyroid membranes in the affinity of the beta-adrenergic receptor binding sites for the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. The results of this study demonstrate that thyroid hormones can regulate the number of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors. The increased numbers of receptors may be responsible, at least in part, for the enhanced catecholamine sensitivity of beta-adrenergic-coupled cardiac responses in the hyperthyroid state.", 
    "57": "The effects of propranolol on electrical and mechanical activity during tetanic stimulation of the diaphragm and leg muscles, and on the heart rate, were studied in the anaesthetized rabbit. Propranolol (from 0.5 mg/kg) reduced the EMG evoked in diaphragm by phrenic nerve stimulation (50/sec) and the EMG and force of contraction during periods of increased respiratory drive obtained by partial tracheal obstruction. The heart rate was lowered by 10-25%. In the indirectly or directly stimulated leg muscles, the drug induced high frequency inhibition of EMG and tetanic contractions (100/sec) without affecting twitch contractions. The inhibitory effect of propranolol on skeletal muscle was probably not caused by beta-adrenergic block, but by stabilization of the sarcolemma. The results suggest that the high frequency inhibitory effect might contribute to the fatigue and reduced work capacity frequently observed when high doses of propranolol are given to man and animals."
