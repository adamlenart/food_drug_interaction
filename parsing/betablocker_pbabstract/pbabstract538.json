Depressor phases were increased by phentolamine and indomethacin, and were inhibited by atropine and spasmolytin. The responses to angiotensin II seem to have a vector character, cholinergic system attenuating this response.", 
    "1": "This article reviews the evidence, obtained from studies employing the technique of intracerebral dialysis, to monitor changes in extracellular adrenaline in the hypothalamus, that adrenaline is released from nerve endings in the hypothalamus and has a functional role. Studies using [3H] adrenaline to determine the specificity of uptake mechanisms for adrenaline indicate that labelled adrenaline is also taken up by noradrenergic nerve endings. This supports the need to develop techniques to monitor changes in endogenous release of adrenaline. In this study, it has been shown that inhibition of phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase selectively decreases tissue levels in the hypothalamus and in vivo release of adrenaline, while monoamine oxidase inhibition and antagonism of alpha 2-adrenoceptors increases the release of both adrenaline and noradrenaline. The \"selective\" noradrenergic neurotoxin DSP4 caused an initial increase in the release of both catecholamines, followed by a marked decrease in their release. Stimulation of the adrenaline-containing neurones in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (C1 region) increased the release of adrenaline in the posterior hypothalamus, but not that of noradrenaline, while also increasing mean arterial blood pressure. Pharmacological evidence indicates that B2-adrenoceptors in the hypothalamus and the spinal cord are involved in the rise in mean arterial pressure, as the response is reduced by a selective B2-antagonist (ICI 118551). The rise in mean arterial blood pressure during C1 stimulation is enhanced by the alpha 2-antagonist idazoxan, supporting observations that alpha 2-adrenoceptors are involved in the pre-synaptic regulation of release of adrenaline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "2": "Beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists have been shown to alter theophylline pharmacokinetics. It was the purpose of this study to characterize further the effects that terbutaline and propranolol have on theophylline disposition. In nine healthy male volunteers, mean parameters for theophylline disposition did not change after four days of terbutaline (5 mg q8h). Theophylline clearance, however, did change within the subjects. Clearance increased in five subjects, decreased in three, and remained unchanged in one volunteer. Pretreatment with four days of terbutaline (5 mg q8h) and propranolol (60 mg q8h) significantly decreased mean theophylline clearance (60.1 +/- 12.9 vs 40.6 +/- 9.9 mL/min/1.73m2; P less than .01) increased half-life (8.37 +/- 1.77 vs 12.32 +/- 2.70 hours; P less than .05), and increased postinfusion theophylline concentration (13.5 +/- 2.7 vs 18.95 +/- 2.5 micrograms/mL; P less than .001). In five subjects theophylline clearance increased after terbutaline pretreatment (64.6 +/- 13.0 vs 75.0 +/- 13.9 mL/min/1.73m2). The percentage increase ranged from 3.9 to 28.5%. These subjects were restudied after receiving propranolol alone (60 mg q8h). Comparison between the propranolol and terbutaline study and the propranolol alone study indicated no mean change in clearance in these five subjects (41.8 +/- 12.7 vs 36.1 +/- 5.1 mL/min/1.73m2). Thus it appears that the changes observed in these five subjects after terbutaline pretreatment may have been random in occurrence as has been shown to occur with theophylline disposition and are not related to terbutaline pretreatment. It is concluded that beta-2 adrenergic stimulation does not alter theophylline pharmacokinetics, whereas nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonism profoundly affected theophylline disposition. This is an additional reason not to use propranolol in patients who receive theophylline.", 
    "3": "The short-term effect of the blockade of the beta-adrenergic receptors on serum lipoproteins and the plasma activities of the enzymes involved in the metabolism of the serum lipoproteins: lipoprotein lipase (LPL), hepatic lipase (HL) and lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) was evaluated in ten healthy normolipemic and normotensive subjects. In the first part of the study, the first three-day period of placebo was followed by another three-day period during which propranolol (120 mg/d) was given. In the second, third, and fourth part of the study, the same schedule was used but pindolol (15 mg/d), nadolol (160 mg/d), atenolol (100 mg/d) were given respectively instead of propranolol. The four drugs induced a significant blockade of the beta-adrenergic receptors as evaluated by the measurement of the double two-step test of Master (-45%). Despite similar blockade, the effect on serum lipid concentrations depended on the type of drug: propranolol induced an increase in triglycerides and apoprotein B-concentrations and a decrease in serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apoprotein AI-concentrations. Pindolol provoked only a slight decrease of serum HDL-C concentration. Nadolol and atenolol elicited a lowering of the same magnitude in HDL-C. Except for a possible slight increase in plasma LCAT activity on propranolol, there was no significant change in the plasma activities of LPL, HL, and LCAT during the blockade of the beta-adrenergic receptors with the drugs used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "4": "Bevantolol is a beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonist that has been shown to be as effective as other beta blockers for the treatment of angina pectoris and hypertension. Some interesting additional properties, such as the absence of the side effect of cold extremities, required investigation, and a great deal of new evidence has been accumulated during the last three years. This new data is consistent with the proposal put forward a couple of years ago that bevantolol interacts with alpha-adrenoceptors. All the available evidence, published and unpublished, has been reviewed and fits into a coherent pattern, here arranged into five sections. Chemistry: affinity for alpha-adrenoceptors. Animal experiments confirm both agonist and antagonist effects on alpha-receptors, in addition to antagonist activity at beta-1 receptors. In addition, bevantolol has electrophysiologic effects, including bradycardia by a direct action on the sinus node and a class 1 antiarrhythmic action. Investigations in humans have shown that although bevantolol has a short half-life, good control of hypertension can be achieved on once-a-day dosing.", 
    "5": "bevantolol has remarkably few side effects, does not cause cold extremities, and does not significantly affect glomerular filtration rate in patients with renal impairment. Evidence has been obtained in man for interaction with alpha-adrenoceptors in the brain; and in the peripheral circulation bevantolol does not, as do other beta blockers, increase peripheral vascular resistance, but reduces it. It is suggested that all the additional actions of bevantolol can be attributed to a partial agonist action on alpha-adrenoceptors.", 
    "6": "In a study to characterize the time characteristics and the influence of blockade of beta, cholinergic and opioid receptors on the chest pain induced by adenosine, this agent was given as a bolus into a peripheral vein of six healthy volunteers (4 men) 24-45 years of age. On the first day the maximum tolerable dose was determined in each case. On the second day three doses of adenosine (1/3, 2/3, and a full maximum tolerable dose) and three doses of placebo were given as single blind doses in randomized order. Thereafter metoprolol (10 mg to males, 8 mg to females), followed by 1 mg atropine and then 0.4 mg naloxone were given intravenously. After each agent the test procedure was repeated. Heart rate and atrio-ventricular blocks were recorded by electrocardiography and respiration by dynamic spirometry. One minute after each dose of adenosine, the chest pain was scored. The maximum tolerable dose of adenosine was 8.0-15.9 mg. All subjects experienced angina pectoris-like pain. Following injection, onset of respiratory stimulation, AV-block and chest pain occurred after 14 +/- 4.0, 19 +/- 5.4 and 21 +/- 6.4 s, the differences being highly significant. Maximal respiratory stimulation occurred after 18 +/- 4.6, not statistically different from the onset of AV-block which in its turn occurred earlier (P less than 0.005) than the time for maximal central chest pain, 29 +/- 7.8 seconds. Metoprolol induced a 20% slowing of heart rate. After atropine there was a 30% faster heart rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "7": "Nine male patients (mean age 65 yr) with chronic atrial fibrillation underwent maximal exercise testing during placebo, beta-adrenergic (celiprolol, 600 mg), or calcium (diltiazem, 30 or 60 mg four times daily) channel blockade. The results were analyzed to determine which factors most closely related to ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) during exercise. Heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), oxygen uptake (VO2), minute ventilation (VE), and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) were evaluated at rest, 3.0 mph/0% grade, the gas exchange anaerobic threshold (ATge), 80% of placebo maximal O2 uptake, and maximal exercise. Both beta-adrenergic and calcium channel blockade significantly reduced heart rate and systolic blood pressure relative to placebo; these effects were more profound during beta-adrenergic blockade and as exercise progressed. Correlation coefficients and estimates of slope were derived for changes in RPE during exercise vs. changes in HR, VO2, VE, and VCO2 during the three treatments (r = 0.76 to 0.92, P less than 0.001). Although RPE was significantly correlated with HR during placebo and diltiazem therapy (r = 0.45, P less than 0.01), this was not the case during beta-adrenergic blockade (r = 0.31, NS). Slope of the regression lines between RPE and VO2, VE, and VCO2 did not differ between the three treatments. Slope of the regression lines between RPE and HR differed only during calcium channel blockade. Because the presence of atrial fibrillation and beta-adrenergic blockade altered the associations between RPE, VO2, and HR, these results suggest that VE is more closely related to RPE than the other parameters.", 
    "8": "Neuroglycopenia induced by 2-deoxy-glucose is known to activate the autonomic nervous system and to stimulate glucagon secretion. In this study, the relative contribution of the various branches of the autonomic nervous system on the 2-deoxy-glucose-induced glucagon secretion was investigated in the mouse. An intravenous injection of 2-deoxy-glucose (500 mg/kg) was followed by a 5-fold increase in plasma levels of glucagon (P less than 0.001). This 2-deoxy-glucose-induced glucagon secretion was impaired by pre-treatment with either the muscarinic antagonist methylatropine (by 83%; P less than 0.001) or the nicotinic antagonist hexamethonium (by 90%; P less than 0.001). Further, also the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine inhibited the glucagon response to 2-deoxy-glucose (by 35%; P less than 0.01). In contrast, the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist L-propranolol did not affect the glucagon response to 2-deoxy-glucose. It is concluded that the main mechanism behind the increased plasma levels of glucagon following administration of 2-deoxy-glucose is cholinergic activation. However, intact alpha-adrenoceptors are a pre-requisite for the full effect of 2-deoxy-glucose. In contrast, beta-adrenoceptors seem to be of no importance and there seems to be no room for neuropeptides as mediators of the neuroglycopenia-induced glucagon secretion in the mouse.", 
    "9": "1 Cardiovascular and sympatho-adrenal responsiveness to mental stress (CWT; a colour word test), orthostatic testing (ORT) and a cold pressor test (CPT) were examined in three groups of hypertensive patients (n = 14-16) before and after 6 months treatment with metoprolol (243 +/- 26 mg daily), propranolol (149 +/- 16 mg daily) or hydrochlorothiazide (50 +/- 8 mg daily) in an open trial design. 2 Treatment reduced outpatient blood pressures in the three groups similarly (from approximately 155/102 to 135/90 mm Hg). During treatment resting blood pressures in the laboratory were clearly reduced by beta-adrenoceptor blockade but not by thiazide treatment. Metoprolol and propranolol caused similar reductions of basal heart rates and plasma glycerol levels, whereas only propranolol reduced cyclic AMP concentrations in plasma. 3 Before treatment CWT and CPT increased systolic and diastolic blood pressures by about 30%. Heart rate increased by about 30 beats min-1 during CWT and 10-15 beats min-1 during CPT and ORT. Small venous plasma adrenaline responses were evoked by all tests, whereas noradrenaline was elevated mainly by CPT and ORT. Dopamine levels did not change. 4 Heart rate responses to all stressors were markedly and similarly reduced, whereas blood pressure responses were essentially unchanged during metoprolol or propranolol treatment. In the thiazide group circulatory responses to CWT were slightly attenuated, whereas responses to ORT and CPT were unchanged. 5 The systolic blood pressure levels were reduced throughout the test session in all three groups, although less so in the hydrochlorothiazide group. Both beta-adrenoceptor antagonists clearly reduced diastolic blood pressure and heart rate levels at rest and during stress, whereas thiazide treatment caused no significant changes in these respects. 6 The rate pressure product, which increased by 80-100% in response to CWT before treatment, was more markedly reduced by beta-adrenoceptor blockade than by thiazide treatment both at rest and during stress. 7 Self ratings (visual analogue scales) of stress and irritation were increased by CWT in a similar fashion before and during treatment in all groups. beta-adrenoceptor blockade was associated with higher subjective ratings of tiredness at rest, but not after CWT. Performance in the CWT increased slightly more in the thiazide group. The physiological responses to CWT were not correlated to the subjective responses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "10": "The effects of propranolol, amethocaine (tetracaine), lignocaine (lidocaine), procaine and benzocaine on force of contraction and action potential parameters of guinea-pig left atria and papillary muscles have been investigated at pH 7.4 and 9. All the drugs decreased the force of contraction of both preparations. Their biological activities correlated with their lipid/buffer partition coefficients and with their ability to change the surface potential of liposomes. The sequence of activities is as follows: propranolol greater than amethocaine greater than lignocaine greater than benzocaine greater than procaine. Uncharged benzocaine had no effect on the liposome surface charge. Biological and physicochemical effects obtained at pH 9 were higher than those observed at pH 7.4. Action potential amplitude and Vmax were decreased by all the drugs except benzocaine. At pH 9, the action potential duration was generally shortened, except by amethocaine and procaine; both caused a prolongation of the action potential at 90% repolarization.", 
    "11": "Hypolaetin-8-glucoside (H-8-G) has been examined for its mode of action in several models of acute inflammation. Its anti-inflammatory activity in carrageenan-induced inflammation of the rat hind-paw is not affected either by adrenalectomy or by phentolamine given with propranolol. H-8-G and its aglycone, hypolaetin, did not antagonize the actions of histamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), bradykinin or prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on various smooth muscle preparations in-vitro, but protected erythrocytes from heat-induced lysis. The glycoside was more potent than troxerutin on capillary permeability increased by histamine and exerted inhibitory effects on protein exudation, leucocyte migration and beta-glucuronidase activity in the carrageenan air pouch, thereby showing some difference from indomethacin. These results are discussed in relation to the features of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and flavonoid anti-inflammatory actions.", 
    "12": "Antacids and adsorbents are commonly used preparations that are generally considered to be pharmacologically inert and free from adverse effects. They may, however, interact with a diverse range of primary drugs and the sequelae can be disadvantageous to the efficacy of the primary medication. Many such reports in the literature are based on animal experiments, or on single-dose studies in healthy subjects. Some reports are anecdotal and are unconfirmed; others are based solely on in vitro evidence. Potentially important interactions have been suggested for a relatively small group of drugs: tetracyclines, phenytoin, digoxin, chloroquine, cimetidine, quinidine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and beta-blocking agents. The evidence for these has been critically evaluated, as well as for antacid-anticoagulant and antacid-nitrofurantoin interactions that have been wrongly emphasized in the literature. The majority of literature reports on interactions with antacids have been overemphasized; only ferrous sulfate-, isoniazid-, and tetracycline-antacid interactions fall into a category I importance (scale I-III of descending importance). This category is for those interactions with good evidence of actual or potential importance in patients or in relevant studies on normal subjects.", 
    "13": "The hypothesis that beta-adrenoceptor agonism might explain a reported lack of competitive antagonism between alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists and agonists of the phenylethylamine class was tested in the electrically field stimulated ileum of the guinea-pig. The beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoprenaline, was used as the phenylethylamine and inhibition of 'twitch' response evoked by cholinergic stimulation was measured. In the presence of idazoxan (3 microM), to block inhibitory alpha 2-adrenoceptors, propranolol (0.1 to 5.0 microM) failed to act competitively toward isoprenaline. Isoprenaline responses totally resistant to inhibition by propranolol were obtained. As inhibitory alpha 1-adrenoceptors are absent from guinea-pig ileum, a recognition site distinct from the currently defined alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors is postulated. Agonism by phenylethylamine based agonists at this site may explain their inability to act competitively with alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists.", 
    "14": "The effect of labetalol on histamine-induced bronchoconstriction was studied in anaesthetized guinea-pigs. Unlike propranolol (1 mg kg-1), the same dose of labetalol did not enhance histamine-induced bronchoconstriction. To determine whether the absence of enhancement of the respiratory effects of histamine by labetalol was due to its alpha 1-blocking properties or to its partial agonist activity at beta 2-adrenoceptors, the effects of propranolol plus prazosin and of propranolol plus labetalol on histamine-induced bronchoconstriction were examined. In both cases, the bronchoconstrictor effects of histamine were enhanced to the same extent as with propranolol alone. These data support the hypothesis that the non impairment of respiratory mechanics by labetalol is not due to antagonism at alpha-adrenoceptors and may be mediated by its partial agonist activity at beta 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "15": "Recent studies have demonstrated the presence of physiologically active beta 2 receptors in the myocardium. We hypothesized that activation of cardiac beta 2 receptors by endogenously released epinephrine and norepinephrine during surgical stress would add to the positive chronotropic response mediated by beta 1 stimulation. Twenty patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting were studied. Ten patients received a beta 1-selective antagonist (atenolol, 6; metoprolol, 4) and ten patients received a nonselective beta 1 and beta 2 antagonist (propranolol) preoperatively. An isoproterenol dose-heart rate response test was performed. After stabilization, general anesthesia was induced followed by tracheal intubation and surgery. Hemodynamic data were recorded before induction, 1 min after induction, 5 min after intubation, 1 min before and after skin incision, 1 min before and after sternotomy. The ten patients on cardioselective beta-blocker drugs had significantly greater increases in heart rate during isoproterenol administration than did the non-cardioselectively blocked group of patients. Heart rate responses to tracheal intubation and surgical stress were not significantly different between the two groups at any point. We conclude that changes in heart rate during perioperative stress are primarily mediated through activation of beta 1 receptors in the myocardium and that patients on either cardioselective or noncardioselective beta-blockers have similar protection to adrenergic-mediated stressful hemodynamic events.", 
    "16": "To determine the protective effect of oxprenolol-induced beta-blockade on the compromised myocardium (critical constriction of the left anterior descending coronary artery) against the adverse effect of high concentrations of halothane, halothane dose-response curves were obtained in six dogs in each of three phases: preconstriction (control), critical constriction, and critical constriction with the addition of 0.3 mg/kg intravenous oxprenolol. The extent of depression of ventricular function was essentially the same in the three phases. However, at high halothane concentrations (2.0% inspired), the depression of systolic shortening in the compromised segment was significantly minimized after oxprenolol so that shortening was 10.2% +/- 1.8 instead of 6.5% +/- 1.4 (P less than 0.05); moreover the large increase in postsystolic shortening observed during critical constriction was abolished after oxprenolol. This suggests a protective effect of oxprenolol on regional myocardial function in the presence of critical constriction, possibly by an effect on myocardial metabolism or endocardial blood flow.", 
    "17": "The value of low-level exercise testing early after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in 207 patients taking beta-blocking drugs was evaluated in a multicenter study of prognosis after AMI. After stratifying patients according to the absence of significant rales upon admission or pulmonary congestion on the admitting chest x-ray, the results of the exercise test (ability to complete the 9-minute protocol) permitted a large cohort (108 patients, 52% of exercising patients) with no deaths from cardiac causes in the year after AMI to be identified. The results suggest that even in patients taking beta-blocking agents, low-level exercise testing together with clinical stratification has value in identifying a large group of patients with a good prognosis after AMI.", 
    "18": "Advantages and disadvantages of the various therapies for stable angina are considered with particular attention to quality of life. Advantages of coronary artery bypass surgery (CABS), apart from the question of survival, include less angina, less activity limitation, and less need for drugs than with medical treatment. However, data from the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) and others show that there is no difference between medical and surgical therapy in return to work and in need for subsequent hospitalization. In CABS patients, there is also predictable return of angina, substantial late vein graft occlusion, and possibly increased progression of native coronary artery disease in grafted vessels. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) has advantages similar to those of CABS, with very low initial mortality and major complication rates, minimal discomfort, very short disability period, and moderate cost. Its major disadvantages are a high short-term reocclusion rate and uncertain long-term outcome. Beta blockers provide good control of angina, have additional antihypertensive and antiarrhythmic effects, and may be beneficial in preventing sudden cardiac (arrhythmic) death and limiting myocardial infarct size, should these events supervene in the patient with angina. Disadvantages of beta blockers involve the occasional major side effects, including potential exacerbation of bronchospasm, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes, congestive heart failure and bradyarrhythmia, and frequent \"nuisance\" side effects. Calcium blockers control both exercise and rest angina and pose no problem in patients with bronchoconstriction, PVD, or diabetes. Disadvantages include need for frequent dosage, cost, and side effects. Long-acting nitrates have few major side effects and usually transient minor side effects, with little effect on quality of life.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "19": "The value of beta blockade after myocardial infarction is extremely well documented. Close to 50 randomized trials have been performed, involving about 40,000 patients with short- or long-term follow-up. Over 20,000 patients have been included in more than 20 placebo-controlled trials with a follow-up period of 3 months or more. In long-term follow-up studies, about 1 to 2 weeks to 1 year after myocardial infarction, mortality was reduced by 21% and reinfarction by 24% (about 20,000 patients in 24 trials). The trial medication was withdrawn in about 20% in both placebo and beta-blocker groups in the major trials. In addition to reduction of mortality and reinfarction rate, benefits have clearly been demonstrated on severity of chest pain, arrhythmias, and other thromboatherosclerotic complications, as well as on readmissions. Significantly more patients experienced congestive heart failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cold hands with beta-blocker treatment, whereas no clear-cut difference was found for atrioventricular block, bronchial constriction, and intermittent claudication. Some studies have reported more tiredness, depression, and gastrointestinal disturbances. In the Stockholm metoprolol trial, analyses on quality of life have been performed. In this trial, 3 years of metoprolol treatment after myocardial infarction resulted in a prolongation of both survival and time spent completely asymptomatic, as well as in an optimal functional state. Furthermore, less time was spent disabled after serious atherosclerotic complications. Long-term beta blockade after myocardial infarction reduces mortality and morbidity but causes adverse reactions in some patients. With proper selection of patients and type and dosage of beta blocker, survival without atherosclerotic complications and side effects can be prolonged.", 
    "20": "The long-term physical and psychologic well-being of patients who have sustained a myocardial infarction is dependent on skilled care during the first hours. Although the immediate preservation of life is the first priority, the relief of symptoms and anxiety and the protection of the myocardium are of short- and long-term importance not only to the quantity but also to the quality of life. Pain relief, particularly in the prehospital phase, is often inadequate. Fear, triggered by pain, may be aggravated by the environment; aggressive (and often unnecessary) measures and the inhuman use of technology may interfere with personal care. Intensive observation is essential for the control of dangerous arrhythmias; the early use of fibrinolytic agents and beta blockers limits the extent of myocardial damage and reduces mortality. The effectiveness of therapy for cardiac failure and shock is questionable. The value of invasive monitoring and of inotropic drugs is uncertain, although the relief of symptoms by diuretic agents and vasodilator drugs is not in doubt. Success in the management of myocardial infarction depends on a highly individualized approach.", 
    "21": "The conventional \"stepped-care\" approach to the treatment of hypertension deserves revision. Rational therapy considers a variety of factors to obtain maximum efficacy, safety, tolerability, compliance, and neutralization of neural tone for the prevention of sudden death. The patient's age, gender, race, behavior profile, hemodynamic and neurohumoral status (plasma renin activity, norepinephrine/epinephrine ratio), and quality of life will help determine the choice of antihypertensive agent. Concomitant risk factors (smoking, obesity, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia), the presence of sequelae (left ventricular hypertrophy and/or failure, renal failure), and the existence of other disorders (mitral valve prolapse, depression, anxiety) must also be considered when initiating treatment. In addition, the cost of ancillary expenses (laboratory tests, hospitalizations, and emergency room visits) must be weighed against the potential benefits of therapy. Beta blockers are effective, well tolerated, and versatile for the treatment of concomitant cardiovascular disorders and as behavior modifiers. Calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors also show promise and merit consideration as therapy for specific groups of hypertensive patients.", 
    "22": "The functional significance of conserved polar amino acids within the putative transmembrane region of the beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) was examined by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the hamster gene encoding beta AR and expression of the mutant genes in COS-7 cells. Although a substitution of aspartate at position 113 with an asparagine residue did not affect expression or processing of the protein, the resulting mutant beta AR did not show detectable binding toward the antagonist iodocyanopindolol. Replacement of the aspartate and asparagine residues at positions 79 and 318, respectively, had no effect on the affinity of the receptor toward antagonists but reduced the affinity of the receptor toward agonists by 1 order of magnitude. Furthermore, we observed that substitution of the proline at position 323 with a serine residue resulted in improper or incomplete processing of the beta AR, presumably reflecting a role for this residue in the folding of the receptor. Together with our previous results from deletion mutagenesis studies, these observations indicate that the ligand binding site involves the transmembrane region of the beta AR.", 
    "23": "Respiration in brown adipocytes can be increased by beta-adrenergic receptor agonists or by alpha 1-adrenergic receptor agonists (phenylephrine and norepinephrine). Previous studies have shown that beta receptor-stimulated respiration is inhibited by adenosine and that enzymatic removal of adenosine produced by fat cells under normal incubation conditions enhances the respiratory response to beta receptor activation. The present experiments were performed to determine the effect of adenosine on the respiratory response elicited by agonists of alpha 1 receptors. The alpha-adrenergic agonists phenylephrine and norepinephrine (in the presence of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol) stimulated respiration and the respiratory response to each agent was enhanced when endogenous adenosine was removed with adenosine deaminase. Addition of hydrolysis-resistant analogues of adenosine inhibited phenylephrine-stimulated respiration, and, since N6-phenylisopropyladenosine was more effective than was 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine, we conclude that an A1 receptor is involved. In contrast, the P site agonist 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine did not inhibit phenylephrine-stimulated respiration but did cause some inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated respiration. These results suggest that adenosine, acting via A1 receptors, modulates alpha 1-adrenergic effects on thermogenesis in brown fat cells, an action that is analogous to its inhibition of beta-adrenergic receptor-stimulated thermogenesis.", 
    "24": "Spontaneously beating heart myocytes were prepared from adult rat ventricular tissues to study the correlation between beta-adrenergic receptor-stimulated changes in contractile performance and protein phosphorylation in vitro. The plasma membrane of isolated myocardial cells was permeabilized by saponin in the presence of EGTA and Mg-ATP. The permeabilized myocytes, which formed a homogeneous cell population, retained the rod-cell morphology of heart cells in situ and showed spontaneous cyclic contractions. Their contractile activity in response to extracellularly added cAMP mimicked the effects caused by beta-adrenergic stimulation of the whole heart: both the frequency and longitudinal velocity of free contraction and relaxation of the cells increased. Similar increases were observed when beta-agonist, isoproterenol, and GTP were added to suspending medium. In addition, isoproterenol maximally enhanced the adenylate cyclase activity of the cells in the presence of GTP. Both of these effects of isoproterenol were completely blocked by the beta-antagonist propranolol. cAMP-mediated phosphorylation of proteins in the permeabilized myocytes was investigated under conditions in which the beating frequency increased. cAMP elevated the phosphorylation level of five proteins; three of them with apparent molecular masses of 24, 15, and 12 kDa were membrane proteins and the other two with apparent molecular masses of 150 and 28 kDa were myofibrillar proteins. The 24-kDa phosphoprotein dissociated into 12-kDa molecules when boiled in sodium dodecyl sulfate, suggesting that these proteins are oligomeric and monomeric forms of phospholamban. The phosphorylation of these five proteins was stimulated by isoproterenol. The effect of isoproterenol was enhanced by GTP but completely blocked by propranolol. The time course of their phosphorylation correlated well with that of the increase in the beating frequency of the cells; both were measured after the administration of isoproterenol and GTP. When propranolol was added after the start of the stimulation by isoproterenol, only phospholamban and the 15-kDa protein were rapidly dephosphorylated in close correlation with the decrease of the beating frequency. These results demonstrate for the first time that the permeabilized myocytes retain the functional beta-adrenergic receptor and cellular responses to beta-adrenergic stimulation. They also suggest that cAMP-mediated phosphorylation of proteins, possibly phospholamban and/or the 15-kDa protein, is involved in the increased contractile activity of permeabilized heart cells.", 
    "25": "The metabolic, autonomic and symptomatic effects of labetalol and metoprolol in comparison with placebo, were studied during insulin induced hypoglycaemia in 5 non-insulin dependent diabetics. Both drugs suppressed the expected increase in heart rate during hypoglycaemia, but did not affect awareness of hypoglycaemic symptoms. Neither drug produced a rise in blood pressure during hypoglycaemia nor delayed the recovery from insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. In both there was no inhibition of release of gluconeogenic substrates such as free fatty acids. The results indicate that both metoprolol, a selective beta-blocker, and labetalol, a combined alpha beta-blocker, do not impair awareness of hypoglycaemia nor alter the metabolic response to hypoglycaemia in diabetics.", 
    "26": "The effect of PGE2 on neurotransmission in the canine tracheal strip dissected free of epithelium was studied in the single sucrose gap and organ bath. PGE2 was a potent inhibitor of the initiation of excitatory junction potentials (ejps) by just submaximal nerve stimulation. In a concentration of 10(-9) or 10(-8) M PGE2 nearly or completely abolished them. Contractile responses to field stimulation in the sucrose gap at 27 degrees C or in muscle baths at 37 degrees C were also reduced or abolished by PGE2 in the same dose range; reductions were greater at low frequency. Responses to acetylcholine were also depressed but significantly less than to field stimulation. These are consistent with major presynaptic as well as some postsynaptic inhibitory actions of PGE2. No evidence was obtained that endogenous PGE2 affected excitatory junction potentials and contractions; i.e. they were stable for hours and unaffected by indomethacin 10(-6) and 10(-5) M under our conditions. Post-stimulus potentiation of ejps amplitude, maximum at 10 s, was observed and became more marked after the first ejp had been markedly reduced or abolished by PGE2. This potentiation was unaffected by indomethacin. It was suggested that a presynaptic process inhibited by PGE2 might participate in this potentiation. The canine trachea is a useful preparation when studied under the experimental condition used here for study of effects of products of arachidonate on neurotransmission.", 
    "27": "The safety and efficacy of step-one therapy with enalapril, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and metoprolol were compared in a double-blind, multicenter study involving 150 patients who had mild to moderate essential hypertension. After a four-week period of placebo run-in, therapy was initiated with twice-daily administration of either 5 mg of enalapril (N = 75) or 50 mg of metoprolol (N = 75). Patients who did not achieve a supine diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg after six weeks of enalapril (maximum dose = 40 mg/d) or metoprolol (maximum dose = 400 mg/d) had hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg/d added to their treatment regimen for an additional six weeks. Both treatments produced significant (P less than .001) mean reductions in supine and standing blood pressures after 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks of active therapy. Maximum reductions from baseline values of supine blood pressure in enalapril-treated (-25/-16 mm Hg) and metoprolol-treated (-21/-15 mm Hg) patients were observed after 12 weeks of single- or double-drug therapy. Approximately two-thirds of the patients responded to single-drug therapy; when hydrochlorothiazide was added, response rates increased to 88% of the patients treated with enalapril and 80% of the patients treated with metoprolol. Enalapril produced a consistently greater reduction in systolic blood pressure. Blacks had a significantly smaller mean blood pressure response to both enalapril and metoprolol than did nonblacks. Metoprolol patients had significant mean pulse rate reductions; enalapril patients had no significant change. Four enalapril-treated and six metoprolol-treated patients discontinued treatment because of side effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "28": "Ascorbic acid caused a calcium-dependent release of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) from the rat mediobasal hypothalamus in vitro. The ascorbate-induced release of LHRH was effectively blocked by the adrenergic alpha-receptor blocker phentolamine, but not by the beta-receptor blocker propranolol. The effect of ascorbate was also suppressed by the mu receptor selective opiate agonist sufentanil. These results suggest that the effects of ascorbic acid on the in vitro release of LHRH are mediated by endogenous norepinephrine. Moreover, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the release of LHRH in the rat is regulated by the hypothalamic noradrenergic system, which is in turn modulated in some, as yet undetermined, fashion by opioid peptides.", 
    "29": "The effects of acute beta 1-blockade on fetal cardiovascular reactions during asphyxia were evaluated in 11 exteriorized sheep fetuses. Gestational age was 110-142 days. Asphyxia was induced either by ventilating the mother with low oxygen gas mixture or by mechanical reduction of placental blood flow. During asphyxia all fetuses reacted to metoprolol injection with a decrease in heart rate, myocardial contractility, cardiac output and arterial blood pressure. Five experiments resulted in irreversible fetal cardiovascular collapse. Isoprenaline was given to the fetuses during hypoxia to test the ability to further increase heart rate and activate myocardial beta-adrenoceptors. In those experiments with fetal cardiovascular demise after metoprolol, the isoprenaline injection did not result in a significant tachycardia. The surviving fetuses could increase their heart rate as a sign of a capacity to further increase the sympatho-adrenergic drive.", 
    "30": "1. The characteristics of [3H]-dihydroalprenolol (DHA) binding were determined in atria from untreated chicks. [3H]-DHA binding to atrium homogenates was rapid (k1 = 8.52 X 10(8) l mol-1 min-1), reversible (k-1 = 0.47 min-1), saturable, and of high affinity (KD = 0.6-1.0 nmol/l). Isoprenaline competed for specific [3H]-DHA binding in a stereoselective manner; IC50 values (mumol/l) were: (-)isoprenaline 0.12, (+)isoprenaline 4.7. 2. The number of [3H]-DHA binding sites and catecholamine content of left and right atria were examined after injection of chicks with a single dose of 6-hydroxydopamine hydrobromide (100 mg/kg). There were transient increases in the number of [3H]-DHA binding sites in both the left and the right atrium after 6-OHDA treatment. These increases were quicker in onset and in offset in the right atrium than in the left atrium. [3H]-DHA binding was significantly increased in the left atrium at 5 and 7 days, and in the right atrium at 3 and 5 days after 6-OHDA injection. 3. Saturation binding isotherms indicated that the increase in [3H]-DHA binding was due to an increase in beta-adrenoceptor number with no change in affinity for [3H]-DHA. 4. Twenty four hours after 6-OHDA treatment there was a significant (80%) decrease in noradrenaline content of left and of right atria. 5. The decrease in noradrenaline content was reversible, noradrenaline levels returning to 55% of control in left atrium and to 71% of control in right atrium by 21 days after 6-OHDA treatment. These changes are consistent with reversible sympathetic denervation of the atria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "31": "In isolated right atria of guinea pigs, OPC-8212 produced a concentration-dependent decrease in spontaneous beating rate that had previously been elevated by isoproterenol or histamine in the presence of nadolol. OPC-8212 scarcely affected the baseline rate, however, OPC-8212 depressed the maximum increase in right atrial rate induced by isoproterenol or histamine in the presence of nadolol. These effects of OPC-8212 were discernible from the effects of its solvent sulfolane. We propose the term \"antitachycardiac\" to describe such effects of OPC-8212 to distinguish it from those of bradycardic agents. When the concentration-response curves of isoproterenol or histamine for positive chronotropy were normalized, these curves were shifted in a parallel way to the left with OPC-8212, indicating that OPC-8212 retains activity as a cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor. The virtual absence of the chronotropic effect of OPC-8212 on the baseline rate and the antitachycardiac effect are discussed in terms of the opposing effects in increasing the inward calcium current on one hand and in decreasing the outward potassium and the inward current activated by hyperpolarization on the other.", 
    "32": "Regional central nervous system and peripheral hemodynamic effects of the intrathecal (i.t.) administration of a substance P (SP) receptor antagonist, [D-Arg1, D-Pro2, D-Trp7,9, Leu11]-substance P ([D-Arg]-SP), were studied in anesthetized rats. It was found that [D-Arg]-SP (3.3 nmol i.t.) reduced mean arterial pressure and cardiac output due to a reduction in stroke volume. Total peripheral resistance was not altered. Whereas most vascular beds showed no alterations in vascular resistance, a renal vasoconstriction was noted. The hypotensive effect of [D-Arg]-SP was blocked by phentolamine (10 mg/kg i.v.) but not by propranolol (1 mg/kg i.v.). In the absence of changes in vascular arterial resistance due to [D-Arg]-SP, it appears that a change in venous return may contribute to the [D-Arg]-SP-induced reduction in stroke volume. These data provide evidence that a spinal cord SP system may tonically affect sympathetic neurons controlling venous, but not arterial, vasomotor tone. [D-Arg]-SP (i.t.) did not alter brain blood flow but significantly decreased blood flow in the thoracolumbar spinal cord 15 to 20 min after administration. The reduction in spinal cord flow did not appear to be responsible for the [D-Arg]-SP-induced hypotension because kainic acid (i.t.), an agent that interacts with glutamate receptors, produced similar pressor responses in the presence and absence of [D-Arg]-SP. In addition, whereas the pressor effect of low doses of a SP agonist [pGlu5, MePhe8, MeGly9]-substance P (5-11) were blocked by [D-Arg]-SP, a higher dose produced the typical pressor effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "33": "Two dihydropyridine compounds, Bay K8644 (a calcium entry activator) and nifedipine (a calcium entry blocker), were found to inhibit the binding of [3H]phenylisopropyladenosine ([3H]PIA) to A1 adenosine receptors in rat cerebral cortex membranes with comparable potencies (IC50 10-30 microM). Scatchard analyses indicated that both Bay K8644 and nifedipine inhibited the binding of [3H]PIA by increasing the KD but without significant effect on the Bmax. When tested at 100 microM, neither Bay K8644 nor nifedipine showed a significant effect on [3H]-p-aminoclonidine ([3H]PAC; alpha 2-adrenergic receptor), [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA; beta-adrenergic receptor), [3H]spiperone (dopamine receptor), and [3H]nitrobenzylthioinosine [( 3H]NBMPR; nucleoside transporter) binding. In the presence of 10 mM Mg2+, the ability of 2-chloroadenosine (2-Cl-Ad, an A1 adenosine receptor agonist) to displace [3H]PIA binding was increased. Conversely, the potencies of 1,3-diethyl-8-phenylxanthine (DPX; an A1 receptor antagonist), Bay K8644 and nifedipine in inhibiting [3H]PIA binding were unchanged. It is suggested that both Bay K8644 and nifedipine may act as antagonists of adenosine A1 receptors, in addition to their well-known effects on calcium channels.", 
    "34": "Calcium antagonists influence cardiovascular hemodynamics by 3 actions: peripheral arterial dilatation, coronary arterial dilatation and negative inotropic effect. The net hemodynamic effects vary depending on the relative strength of each action. Intravenous administration of the new compound nicardipine, a dihydropyridine derivative with calcium antagonist activity that is chemically related to nifedipine, induced a marked reduction of systemic vascular resistance in patients with and without beta blockade. This was accompanied by an increase in cardiac output and left ventricular ejection fraction. In addition, end-diastolic pressure, peak (+) dP/dt and dP/dt measured at a developed pressure of 40 mm Hg and normalized for this pressure remained unchanged. The time constant of isovolumetric pressure drop during the first 40 ms also decreased. Intravenous administration of nicardipine prevented a marked increase in end-diastolic pressure during exercise, and augmented left ventricular ejection fraction in chronic heart failure. At doses producing similar increases in coronary sinus blood flow, intracoronary administration of nicardipine, unlike nifedipine, has little effect on left ventricular contractility and end-diastolic pressure. Nicardipine is a powerful systemic vasodilator with minimal effects on myocardial inotropic state, even in patients with compromised left ventricular function and patients receiving beta blocker therapy.", 
    "35": "In the present study, the beta-receptor-blocker Celiprolol was tested for its antianginal effects during an observation period of 12 months; 29 patients, both male and female, with definite coronary heart diseases, were subjected to this study. In general Celiprolol was well accepted by the patients, the dosage being 200 mg every morning. Regarding intensity and frequency, the side effects were negligible. It was possible to lower the intensity and frequency of angina attacks considerably during the treatment with Celiprolol. Exercise examinations were carried out at prescribed intervals and showed an increase in pain free working capacity and a decrease in the hypoxic ST-depression on the ECG, also to a considerable extent. The indication for the use of Celiprolol in long-term treatment of coronary heart disease was impressingly confirmed.", 
    "36": "The effect of ethanol on the cardiovascular system (ECG, heart rate, blood pressure) was studied in anesthetized, nonstressed or stressed rats. In anesthetized rats, ethanol showed no effect on heart rate or ECG. In nonstressed rats, ethanol sedated the animals but increased heart rate significantly. This ethanol induced tachycardia seemed the result of a direct stimulation of the sympathetic nerves to the heart. Blood pressure was not significantly affected by ethanol in these nonstressed rats. In stressed rats, marked behavioral excitation and significant increases in heart rate and blood pressure were noted. Ethanol pretreatment calmed the animals considerably during restraint. Ethanol did reduce slightly the stress-induced tachycardia but markedly reduced or antagonized stress-induced blood pressure increases. No major changes in the ECG were noted during these studies with the exception of a few individual animals which showed pathologic ECG responses to ethanol. These data show that ethanol affects cardiovascular functions differently in anesthetized, nonstressed or stressed rats, and that ethanol can significantly reduce or antagonize stress-induced behavioral excitation, tachycardia and hypertension.", 
    "37": "Specific binding of [125I]-(-)-cyanopindolol to human tracheal smooth muscle membranes was saturable, stereo-selective and of high affinity (Kd = 5.3 +/- 0.9 pmol/l and RT = 78 +/- 7 fmol/g tissue). The beta 1-selective antagonists atenolol and LK 203-030 inhibited specific [125I]-(-)-cyanopindolol binding according to a one binding site model with low affinity in nearly all subjects, pointing to a homogeneous beta 2-adrenoceptor population. In one subject using LK 203-030 a small beta 1-adrenoceptor subpopulation could be demonstrated. The beta-mimetics isoprenaline, fenoterol, salbutamol and terbutaline recognized high and low affinity agonist binding sites. Isoprenaline's pKH- and pKL-values for the high and low affinity sites were 8.0 +/- 0.2 and 5.9 +/- 0.3 respectively. In functional experiments isoprenaline relaxed tracheal smooth muscle strips having intrinsic tone with a pD2-value of 6.63 +/- 0.19.", 
    "38": "The rate of glucose utilization in isolated pancreatic islets of the rat was inhibited by the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists clonidine and epinephrine. Yohimbine reversed the inhibition. alpha 1 or beta-adrenoceptor agonists had little or no effect on glucose utilization. Stimulation of muscarinic receptors by carbamylcholine reversed the effect of clonidine. Pertussis toxin blocked the effect of clonidine on glucose utilization, and potentiated the response to carbamylcholine. 8-Bromo-cAMP did not affect glucose utilization in the presence of clonidine. Thus, alpha 2-adrenoceptors negatively modulate glucose utilization, and the effect is mediated by an inhibitory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein, but not by cAMP.", 
    "39": "Effect of adrenergic activity on the adrenal steroidogenesis and the modulation by catecholamines of aldosterone release were studied in isolated rat adrenal cell suspensions. Isoproterenol, norepinephrine and epinephrine, but not dopamine, caused statistically significant increase in aldosterone release. Both prazosin (alpha 1 antagonist) and yohimbine (alpha 2 antagonist) suppressed the norepinephrine-induced aldosterone release in a dose dependent manner, respectively. Both atenolol (beta 1 antagonist) and ICI 118-551 (beta 2 antagonist) also blocked (-)-isoproterenol-induced aldosterone release in a dose dependent manner, respectively. Neither (-)-isoproterenol nor (+/-)-norepinephrine at concentrations of 10(-6) M potentiated aldosterone release stimulated by angiotensin II or ACTH. These results suggest that catecholamines stimulate aldosteroidogenesis, but it appears unlikely that aldosterone release induced by ACTH or angiotensin-II is modulated by adrenergic stimulation.", 
    "40": "The beta-adrenergic and adrenomedullary components of pressor responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation were studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY). The effects of electrical stimulation of the entire spinal cord of pithed rats pretreated with tubocurarine and atropine were studied on systolic blood pressure, heart rate and plasma cyclic AMP levels. The heart rate increase upon low frequency stimulation (1 Hz) and the blood pressure elevation upon stimulation at higher frequencies (3 and 5 Hz) were higher in SHR than in WKY whereas the increase in circulating cyclic AMP level was not different in the two strains. Pretreatment with propranolol (2.5 mg X kg-1) further enhanced the pressor responses in SHR but not in WKY, although it inhibited the heart rate acceleration and decreased the circulating level of cyclic AMP similarly in the two strains. After acute adrenalectomy, the elevations of blood pressure and circulating cyclic AMP levels were reduced to an identical level in SHR and WKY. These results show that the marked enhancement of the pressor response observed in SHR upon stimulation of the entire sympathetic outflow is mostly of adrenomedullary origin and includes a hypotensive component due to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation which is not present in WKY.", 
    "41": "A possible interaction between Cd2+ and Ca2+ as a component in Cd2+-induced insulin release was investigated in beta cells isolated from obese hyperglycemic mice. The glucose stimulated Cd2+ uptake was dependent on the concentration of sugar. This uptake was sigmoidal with a Km for glucose of about 5 mM and was suppressed by both 50 microM of the voltage-activated Ca2+ channel blocker D-600 and 12 mM Mg2+. In the presence of 8 mM glucose 5 microM Cd2+ evoked a prompt and sustained stimulatory response, corresponding to about 3-fold of the insulin release obtained in the absence of the ion. Whereas 5 microM Cd2+ was without effect on the glucose-stimulated 45Ca efflux in the presence of extracellular Ca2+, 40 microM inhibited it. At a concentration of 5 microM, Cd2+ had no effect on the resting membrane potential or the depolarization evoked by either glucose or K+. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+ there was only a modest stimulation of 45Ca efflux by 5 microM Cd2+. Studies of the ambient free Ca2+ concentration maintained by permeabilized cells also indicate that 5 microM Cd2+ do not mobilize intracellularly bound Ca2+ to any great extent. On the contrary, at this concentration, Cd2+ even suppressed inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-induced Ca2+ release. The present study suggests that Cd2+ stimulates insulin release by a direct mechanism which does not involve an increase in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration.", 
    "42": "Surgical thyroidectomy of adult rats resulted in a gradual decrease in beta-adrenergic receptor density on the cell surface of parotid and submandibular glands. The decrease in beta-adrenergic receptors was 29 and 50% by 2 and 4 weeks, respectively, for the parotid gland. In the submandibular gland, a decrease of 50% of the total beta-receptor density was evident after 2 weeks. After 4 weeks no further decrease in beta-adrenergic receptor was observed. Subsequent challenge of the salivary glands with chronic treatment of isoproterenol (beta-adrenergic receptor agonist) failed to induce proline-rich protein and glycoprotein biosynthesis in the submandibular gland 2 weeks after thyroidectomy, whereas the parotid gland showed induced proline-rich protein but not the glycoprotein synthesis. By 4 weeks the parotid gland did not show the induced synthesis of the glycoprotein or proline-rich proteins. The inability to induce protein synthesis was reflected by decreased cAMP accumulation in both glands after injection with isoproterenol. Partial reversal of these effects on protein synthesis and cAMP accumulation was obtained by triiodothyronine treatment of thyroidectomized rats.", 
    "43": "The effect of a series of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on cholesterol biosynthesis was studied in vitro in normal human skin fibroblasts. Some, but not all, of the drugs studied stimulated the incorporation of [2-14C]-acetate into cell sterols in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was unrelated to beta-blocking potency, selectivity for beta 1 or beta 2 adrenoceptors and partial agonistic activity of the drugs, thus ruling out a beta-receptor mediated mechanism. A positive, statistically significant correlation was found, however, between the drug lipophilicity and the stimulation of sterol biosynthesis. Propranolol, the most effective agent in increasing [2-14C]-acetate incorporation into cellular sterols, also enhanced the conversion of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMGCoA) into mevalonic acid, suggesting an interference of lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor antagonists with HMHCoA-reductase, the feed-back regulated rate limiting step of cholesterol biosynthesis.", 
    "44": "The acute effects of pirmenol on atrial fibrillation were investigated in 40 patients with paroxysm of atrial fibrillation. Patients were randomized to receive either pirmenol, 50 or 100 mg intravenously, or placebo. Patients with congestive heart failure or a history of sinus node disorder were excluded. Sinus rhythm was achieved in 12 of 20 patients in 2 to 16 minutes after pirmenol administration and in 3 of 20 patients in the control group within 1 hour. A nodal escape rhythm during sinus slowing was observed in 1 patient. No sinus arrest, atrioventricular conduction disturbance or hypotension appeared. Pirmenol has an antifibrillatory effect on the atria. Sinus rhythm is restored rapidly after intravenous administration. Treatment of atrial fibrillation of recent onset was well tolerated in patients accepted for the study.", 
    "45": "An improved high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) assay has been developed for the analysis of labetalol in human plasma. The method is based on the combined use of an automated sample processor, reversed-phase analysis on a microparticulate polymer-based HPLC column and fluorescence detection. The pH stability of the polymeric column packing material allowed the use of a mobile phase adjusted to pH 9.5, which was optimal for the fluorescence of labetalol. Assay validation was undertaken over the labetalol concentration range 2-100 ng/ml. Calibration curves were essentially linear, and the mean coefficient of variation was 5.3%. The assay has been used for the analysis of clinical samples in support of pharmacokinetic studies.", 
    "46": "Appearance of two isomers of inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) was observed when [3H]inositol prelabelled rat heart ventricles were stimulated for 10 and 30 s with noradrenaline. In contrast, inositol tetrakisphosphate (InsP4) could not be detected. However the existence of the inositol tris/tetrakisphosphate pathway was demonstrated by studying [3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-1,4,5-P3) metabolism in a soluble fraction of rat heart. There, [3H]Ins-1,4,5-P3 was phosphorylated to form [3H]Ins-1,3,4,5-P4. Raising [Ca2+] from 1 nM to 1 microM increased InsP3 kinase activity by 2-fold (EC50 for Ca2+ approx. 56 nM). This effect appeared to be due to an increase of the apparent Vmax of the enzyme while the apparent Km was unchanged.", 
    "47": "Adrenergic regulation of phosphoinositide breakdown in rat skeletal muscle was investigated in 30-min incubations with 10 mM LiCl. In rat hemidiaphragms, prelabelled with D-myo-[2-3H]inositol, addition of alpha-agonists (epinephrine, norepinephrine, phenylephrine) induced a 5-8-fold increase of [3H]inositol monophosphate accumulation. This could be prevented by inclusion of alpha-antagonists (phentolamine, prazosin). beta-Agonists and/or beta-antagonists had no effect. Similar experiments with isolated flexor digitorum brevis muscle fibers yielded confirmatory results. Functional integrity of beta-receptor mediated processes was suggested by the beta-agonist-induced increase of glucose 6-phosphate in hemidiaphragms and cAMP in fiber preparations. The results indicate that phosphoinositide breakdown in differentiated rat skeletal muscle is, at least in part, under alpha-adrenergic control.", 
    "48": "The adrenergic regulation of cyclic GMP in isolated pinealocytes was investigated. In this cell, norepinephrine stimulates cyclic GMP and cyclic AMP greater than 100-fold by activating both alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptors. beta-Adrenergic activation is a requisite event and is potentiated by alpha 1-adrenergic activation (Vanecek, J., Sugden, D., Weller, J. L., and Klein, D. C. (1985) Endocrinology 116, 2167-2173). The current study found that cholera toxin could substitute for beta-adrenergic agonists in stimulating pinealocyte cyclic GMP content, as has been found to be the case for cyclic AMP. Treatment with cholera toxin alone (1 microgram/ml for 90 min) had a small effect (2- to 4-fold increase) on cyclic GMP; addition of the alpha 1-adrenergic agonists, phenylephrine, cirazoline, or methoxamine to cholera toxin-treated cells rapidly (peak at 5 min) caused a further 30- to 300-fold increase. The alpha 1-adrenergic agonists had little effect by themselves at concentrations which potentiated the effects of cholera toxin. The potentiating effect of phenylephrine was inhibited nearly completely by an alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist, but not by either an alpha 2- or beta-adrenergic antagonist. The purified cholera toxin subunits A and B did not stimulate cyclic GMP either alone or in the presence of phenylephrine. Furthermore, the potentiating action of phenylephrine was observed following 90 min but not 20 min of cholera toxin pretreatment. these results suggest that the regulation of cyclic GMP levels in the pineal gland involves an Ns-like GTP-binding regulatory protein. This is of interest because it is the first indication that cyclic GMP is regulated by such a GTP-binding protein in nonretinal tissue. It remains to be determined whether the mechanisms involved in the transmembrane regulation of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP in any other tissue are similar.", 
    "49": "An automated high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) column-switching system is described for the analysis of medroxalol, a potential antihypertensive agent, in plasma. The HPLC system uses two six-port switching valves with a Corasil C18 short pre-column for an on-line sample clean-up and an SGE ODS analytical column for separation. Plasma samples were diluted with a phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing an internal standard and aliquots were injected directly on the HPLC system. The column-switching system was applicable to continuous analysis of hundreds of plasma samples since this technique provided very efficient on-line sample clean-up and regenerated the pre-column effectively. Results were in good agreement and the total analysis time was one third that of an alternative method.", 
    "50": "The effects of alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists on sulfobromophthalein (BSP) disposition in mice were studied. It was found that agents with both central and peripheral activities (clonidine, guanabenz, B-HT 920 and methyldopa) as well as peripherally acting alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists (para amino-clonidine and St 91) inhibited sulfobromophthalein disposition in the mouse, and also caused substantial hypothermia. The effects of these agonists were inhibited by yohimbine, a specific alpha 2-antagonist, except for those of para amino-clonidine where only partial reversal was achieved. The effects of clonidine on BSP disposition were also reversed by piperoxan but not by the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists, prazosin and phenoxybenzamine, nor by the beta-blocker, propranolol. These results suggest that, in mice, peripheral alpha 2-adrenoceptors are involved in the effects of the alpha-agonists on BSP disposition.", 
    "51": "Systemic and regional haemodynamic effects of UD-CG 212 CL (0.5-16 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1), the major metabolite of the vasodilator and cardiotonic drug pimobendan, were studied in anaesthetized pigs. The drug caused a dose-dependent decrease in left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic and arterial blood pressures while it increased systemic vascular conductance, heart rate and maxLVdP/dt. The decrease in LV end-diastolic pressure was observed at lower plasma concentrations than the increase in systemic vascular conductance. Cardiac output tended to decrease but statistical significance was achieved only with the highest concentration. These effects of UD-CG 212 CL were not altered by the blockade of beta-adrenoceptors with propranolol. The vasodilator action of UD-CG 212 CL was noticed in several organs but the effects were relatively more marked (in decreasing order of magnitude) in the adrenals, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, brain and LV epicardium. Since both arterial pressure and cardiac output decreased, the blood flow increased significantly only in the adrenals and decreased moderately in the spleen, LV endocardium and skeletal muscles. The effects of UD-CG 212 CL on the renal and skeletal muscle haemodynamics were different from those of pimobendan, which causes vasodilatation in the skeletal muscles but not in the kidneys. The results of this study show that, like the parent compound pimobendan, UD-CG 212 CL has independent cardiotonic and vasodilator actions; the latter being more pronounced on the venous side. However, the contribution of this metabolite to the overall pharmacological activity of pimobendan appears to be limited.", 
    "52": "The abilities of AY-28,925, labetalol and medroxalol to relax the PGF2 alpha-contracted isolated guinea-pig trachea have been investigated to compare their activities at beta 2-adrenoceptors. Maximum relaxation induced by AY-28,925 was significantly greater than that induced by either labetalol or medroxalol. This relaxation occurred in a concentration-dependent manner over a range of concentrations consistent with the previously determined affinity of AY-28,925 for beta-adrenoceptors. ICI-118,551 inhibited AY-28,925-induced relaxation in a concentration-dependent manner with a pA2 value similar to that determined for ICI-118,551 inhibition of the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol, but not the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist norepinephrine. The Schild plot slope for ICI-118,551 inhibition of AY-28,925 or salbutamol did not differ significantly from unity, while that for inhibition of isoproterenol (a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor agonist) did. It is concluded that AY-28,925 is a more efficacious relaxant of tracheal smooth muscle than either labetalol or medroxalol, and that this relaxant activity is the result of its greater intrinsic efficacy at the beta 2-adrenoceptor.", 
    "53": "The effect of procainamide (2.0-5.0 mM) and quinidine (0.2-1.0 mM) on the alpha 1 response evoked by adrenaline (3 X 10(-6) M) in smooth muscle cells of guinea-pig taenia caeci (22 degrees C) was studied in the presence of yohimbine (3 X 10(-6) M), propranolol (3 X 10(-6) M) or atropine (10(-6) M). The electrotonic potential elicited by the application of a constant current to the preparation was slightly increased (about 10%) by procainamide (5.0 mM) but not by quinidine (1.0 mM). The double-sucrose gap method was used for measurements. The alpha 1 response evoked by adrenaline in the absence of extracellular calcium (15 min) was represented by a transient hyperpolarization of the muscle cells, while the hyperpolarization elicited in the presence of calcium was sustained. The hyperpolarization is caused by enhancement of the potassium efflux assumed to be linked with mobilization of calcium form a cellular structure. Superfusion of the preparation with calcium-containing solution to replenish the calcium store in the presence of procainamide (10 min) before the alpha 1 response evoked in the absence of calcium and procainamide did not affect the transient hyperpolarization. Quinidine, however, suppressed the alpha 1 response when the same procedure was followed. Both the transient and the sustained hyperpolarization evoked in smooth muscle cells in the presence of procainamide (15 min) or quinidine in calcium-containing or in calcium-free solution, respectively, were inhibited. The alpha 1 response was reflected by a depolarization of the muscle cells after the potassium channels had been blocked with apamin (3 X 10(-7) M, 20 min).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "54": "To confirm our previous finding that the underlying mechanism for the development of physical dependence on alcohol and barbital are fundamentally different from each other, further studies on the effect of drugs that modify neurotransmission on the alcohol and barbital withdrawal signs were carried out in alcohol and barbital dependent mice. Phentolamine, propranolol and methysergide exacerbated the alcohol withdrawal signs but suppressed the barbital withdrawal signs indicating the qualitative difference of the underlying mechanism. Some quantitative differences were also found in the effect of clonidine, prazosin, yohimbine, muscimol and bicuculline. On the other hand, metoprolol, atropine and scopolamine did not affect the withdrawal signs developed in the alcohol and barbital dependent animals at the dose employed in the present experiment. These results indicate that the withdrawal signs that appear in alcohol and barbital dependent animals are the manifestation of functional abnormalities of the nervous system, and alcohol and barbital dependence rely on different mechanisms for their production.", 
    "55": "Propranolol (1) decreases hepatic blood flow and glucagon (2) exerts an opposite effect on hepatic circulation. The effects of these drugs on the pharmacokinetics of phenazone (3; antipyrine)-a compound with low coefficient of hepatic extraction, and sodium salicylate (4) that is highly extracted by liver, were studied on rabbits. It was shown that changes in the pharmacokinetics of 3 and 4 in the presence of 1 or 2, seemed to be interactions between these drugs in the haemodynamic phase.", 
    "56": "Thiazole derivatives with potential positive inotropic effect were synthesized. The highest activity (medium positive inotropic effect) was exhibited by ethyl 2-(2-hydroxyethylamino)-4-phenylthiazole-5-carboxylate (3b) of which several derivatives have been prepared. Among these derivatives only those which could presumably easily removed in the living organism to give 3b exhibited a medium positive inotropic effect (6, 8b). It was assumed that the effect of 3b had a beta-agonist character.", 
    "57": "The main form of rectal administration of medications is the suppository. The rapidity of release of the active principle in the rectal fluid depends mainly on the physicochemical properties of the vehicle. Absorption per se is influenced by the liposolubility as well as the ionization of the medication, and by the site of its release since only the middle and inferior hemorrhoidal veins avoid the hepatic crossing. For molecules subjected to a major 1st hepatic crossing (lidocaine, propranolol, ergotamine...), pharmacokinetic studies demonstrate that the rectal route enables to obtain a bioavailability which is markedly higher by oral route, and plasma concentrations at a therapeutic level. The use, still experimental, of rectal osmotic pumps, provides balanced plasma concentrations which remain stable during the entire duration of the application. Undesirable side effects related to the administration of drugs via the rectal route, are, most of the time, local ones. The vehicles seem to be responsible for diffuse ano-rectitis. Cases of rectal ulcerations with necrosis have been reported following the excessive use of suppositories containing dextro-propoxyphene or ergotamine.", 
    "58": "Binding of the catecholamine beta-adrenergic antagonist, l-alprenolol, by the IgGl anti-alprenolol monoclonal antibody 37A4 was examined using the radioligand 3H-dihydroalprenolol as an extrinsic signal and the increase in antibody fluorescence upon l-alprenolol binding as intrinsic signal. Equilibrium binding studies based on both signals indicated that the binding process was exothermic with a positive entropy change. The difference in the affinity constants obtained by radioligand binding studies and by fluorescence analysis could be ascribed to the higher affinity of the hydrogenated tritiated l-dihydroalprenolol compared to the unsaturated l-alprenolol. The association rate constants determined by both signals were 10(4)-10(5)/M/sec and showed a high activation enthalpy (8-10 kcal/mol), thus excluding a diffusion controlled reaction. At low temp (7 degrees C), the fluorescence stopped-flow studies showed non-linear pseudo first order kinetics, indicating the existence of a fast pre-equilibrium of low affinity, followed by a conformational change leading to the tight binding of the ligand. The dissociation rate constants determined using both signals were very similar. Thus, the differences in affinity between the hydrogenated and non-saturated l-alprenolol could be ascribed to the association rate constants. Affinity constants and thermodynamic parameters calculated from the kinetic data were in close agreement with those determined by equilibrium binding. The mechanisms of ligand binding are discussed in terms of the interactions of idiotypes and anti-idiotypes in the anti-catecholamine immune response.", 
    "59": "Feeding induced by 2-deoxyglucose was compared with feeding induced by food deprivation in terms of antagonism by anorectic drugs and of anatomical site of action. Glucoprivic feeding was completely blocked by microinjection of amphetamine, fenfluramine, and mazindol into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). Deprivation-induced feeding was not blocked by amphetamine, fenfluramine, or mazindol microinjected into the PVN. Neither the feeding induced by 2-deoxyglucose nor its reversal by amphetamine were blocked by pretreatment with the beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol. Amphetamine and fenfluramine blocked both glucoprivic- and deprivation-induced feeding when microinjected into the perifornical region of the lateral hypothalamus. These data suggest that food consumption induced by 2-deoxyglucose treatment can be antagonized by anorectic drugs acting at recognition sites present in several hypothalamic nuclei, while deprivation-induced feeding acts through different receptor mechanisms which may be specific to the perifornical region of the lateral hypothalamus.", 
    "60": "The pulmonary hypertension of a patient with portal vein thrombosis was not responsive to various vasodilator drugs. The high cardiac output permitted the use of atenolol. The pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) was lowered from 105/50 to 87/31 mmHg. The effect was sustained after 6 months of treatment: PAP 68/32 mmHg.", 
    "61": "The development of the febrile response to E. coli lipopolysaccharide (1.5 micrograms/kg, i.v.) in thyroid-deficient rabbits has been studied. Twenty-eight New Zealand White rabbits weighing 2.1-2.3 kg were used. Hypothyroidism was induced by treatment with propylthiouracil (100 or 200 mg/kg body wt./15 days). Thyroid-deficient animals showed a reduction in the febrile response to lipopolysaccharide, but the effect was significantly different (p less than 0.01) from the control only for rabbits treated with 200 mg/kg of propylthiouracil. Propranolol (2 mg/kg, i.p.) given 30 min before lipopolysaccharide also reduced (p less than 0.01) the fever response in control rabbits. The results of this experiment are consistent with the hypothesis that the reduction in the febrile response of thyroid-deficient rabbits is due to the reduced number of beta-adrenergic receptors, or to a change in the availability of neurotransmitter in thermogenically active tissues, such as brown fat.", 
    "62": "Contractile sensitivity and reactivity to alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor stimulation was studied in incubated rabbit pulmonary artery cylindrical segments of differing diameters. Distinct differences were noted between the responses of extra- and intra-pulmonary pulmonary arteries to norepinephrine and isoproterenol. The sensitivity to norepinephrine was largest in the intrapulmonary pulmonary arteries. Arterial reactivity to norepinephrine was greatest in the larger of the intrapulmonary vessel segments, diminishing considerably as the vessels became smaller. Cocaine did not cause substantial alterations in the response of any of the arterial segments to the alpha-agonist. Phentolamine, however, exerted its influence primarily in the smaller arterial segments. Vascular sensitivity to isoproterenol was least in the intrapulmonary pulmonary arteries. These smaller vessel segments, however, were more reactive to isoproterenol than were the extrapulmonary pulmonary arterial segments. Propranolol, at a concentration of 10(-8) M, was an effective antagonist of the beta-agonist; at a concentration of 10(-7) M, however, this antagonist was related to isoproterenol-induced arterial contraction, apparently by stimulation of alpha-receptor sites. The results of this study demonstrated a regional heterogeneity in the contractile response of the pulmonary artery to alpha- and beta-stimulation. The extrapulmonary arterial segments were found to be more sensitive to beta-stimulation than were the smaller, intrapulmonary, segments. The intrapulmonary arterial segments, on the other hand, were found to be more sensitive to alpha-stimulation than were the extrapulmonary segments.", 
    "63": "Electrical stimulation of the locus coeruleus in anesthetized rats evoked a biphasic pressor response consisting of an initial sharp rise in blood pressure at the onset of stimulation, followed by a second elevation after cessation of the stimulus. This response, which was accompanied by an increase in plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline levels, was stable and could be easily reproduced over time. Sympathectomy by administration of guanethidine selectively abolished the primary pressor response. beta-Adrenergic blockade by intravenous administration of sotalol enhanced the secondary pressor response without affecting the primary component. Adrenal demedullation performed 24-48 h before the experiments selectively prevented the secondary pressor component. In contrast, acute adrenalectomy carried out during the experiment to impair the adrenomedullary secretions eliminated the secondary pressor response to stimulation of the locus coeruleus only in sympathectomized or in sotalol-treated rats but not in intact rats in which the response persisted. The latter, however, could be abolished by the administration of either guanethidine or sotalol, and it disappeared following repeated stimulation of the locus coeruleus. The study demonstrates that similar poststimulatory pressor responses with different underlying mechanisms can be elicited on excitation of the locus coeruleus before and after acute adrenalectomy in the rat. The results also suggest that intraneuronal adrenaline may be involved in the response evoked in acutely adrenalectomized animals.", 
    "64": "Posterior pupillary synechiae affect a proportion of eyes subjected to iridectomy with or without drainage operation because (1) aqueous humour bypasses the pupil; (2) traumatic iridocyclitis occurs; (3) there is immobility of the iris in the iridectomy sector; (4) in eyes with angle closure glaucoma closer apposition of the iris to the anterior lens capsule increases the tendency; (5) pilocarpine aggravates (4) both in angle closure glaucoma and open angle glaucoma and produces a small immobile pupil facilitating pupillary membrane formation (occlusio pupillae). Pilocarpine should be avoided if possible as medical treatment at any time after a drainage operation. A beta blocker is the drug of choice. To eliminate posterior synechiae over a fair number of degrees of pupil (say 30 degrees) sector iridectomy can be done.", 
    "65": "Phaeochromocytoma can mimic many serious disease entities. This report describes a 43-year-old man who presented with pulmonary oedema due to a phaeochromocytoma. Predominantly adrenaline-secreting tumours seem to predispose to this complication. Labetalol, a combined alpha- and beta-receptor blocker, should be considered as the initial treatment in these cases and continued during surgery.", 
    "66": "A transient myasthenic syndrome confirmed by EMG after taking large doses of beta blocking agent is reported. Data on similar complications have not been found in the literature. Theories trying to explain the myasthenic, myopathic effect of the beta-blocking agents are reviewed. In the opinion of the authors the quinidine-like membrane stabilising effect played a role in their case, although the possibility of the direct effect of the drug on the neurotransmitters cannot be excluded either.", 
    "67": "A case of intravenous labetalol in the treatment of a resistant hypertensive emergency is reported. Although there have been several reports of the use of oral labetalol in resistant hypertension, no intravenous administration in hypertensive emergency resistant to other drugs has been reported to date. A 36-year-old black female with BP of 270/160 mm Hg with complaints greater than one month's duration of dizziness, severe headaches, blurred vision, shortness of breath, vomiting, palpitations, flushing, agitation, diarrhea, weakness, and weight loss, was treated successfully with intravenous labetalol after she failed to respond to other established parenteral antihypertensive drugs. The patient received labetalol 20 mg iv bolus, and then 20 mg every ten minutes until a cumulative dose of 200 mg was attained. Labetalol produced a prompt but smooth reduction in BP without any reflex tachycardia or other adverse effects. Intravenous labetalol may be safe and effective for the management of rapid BP control in hypertensive emergencies resistant to other parenteral antihypertensive agents.", 
    "68": "A 31-year-old female had recurring palpitations and black-outs for 13 years. Hyperthyroidism was diagnosed and electrocardiogram suggested ventricular preexcitation. Despite being treated for hyperthyroidism (which rendered the patient hypothyroid) and receiving propranolol for the arrhythmia, the palpitations persisted. Electrophysiologic testing identified the patient's arrhythmia, and demonstrated that it improved with intravenous propafenone, a new type 1C antiarrhythmic medication. After two days of oral propafenone, this initially good response was followed by episodes of Torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia with repeated cardiac arrest. Lidocaine and isoproterenol failed to control the rhythm, and the patient was stabilized by electrical cardioversions, atrial pacing and withdrawing the propafenone. Propafenone has been used to treat Torsade de pointes, but we show that it may also cause Torsade de pointes.", 
    "69": "Bradycardia/tachycardia syndrome (BTS) is notoriously refractory to drug therapy. Three patients with BTS unresponsive to digitalis or digitalis plus verapamil (ventricular response continued intermittently rapid despite prolonged pauses) were prescribed oral pindolol, a beta blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. The ventricular rate was well-controlled in all and no adverse effects were seen. Pindolol may be of value in selected patients with BTS.", 
    "70": "The effect of 2 weeks treatment with propranolol or metoprolol on skin blood flow (SBF) at rest was examined in 12 diabetic patients with essential hypertension in whom gross large vessel disease had been excluded. Neither drug significantly altered resting skin blood flow. However we cannot exclude an important difference between the two beta-adrenoceptor blockers because of the great variability of SBF within subjects. A larger study and/or more accurate methods of measuring SBF are needed to determine if beta 1-selective adrenoceptor antagonists differ from non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blockers with respect to skin blood flow.", 
    "71": "The objective of this study was to examine the effect of cigarette smoking on the activities of the three primary pathways governing propranolol metabolism in human subjects, i.e., glucuronidation, side-chain oxidation and ring oxidation. A single 80-mg dose of propranolol p.o. together with 40 muCi of 4-[3H]propranolol was given to six smoking and seven nonsmoking, young, white, male subjects and the oral clearance of propranolol and the partial clearances through these pathways were determined. The oral clearance of propranolol was increased by 77% (P less than .02) in smokers compared with nonsmokers. This apparent induction of propranolol metabolism was due to a 122% increase in side-chain oxidation (P less than .001) and a 55% increase in glucuronidation (P less than .01). There was no significant effect of smoking on aromatic ring oxidation. Smokers had a 30% greater renal clearance of total metabolites (P less than .05), due mainly to a 53% greater renal clearance of the acidic propranolol metabolite naphthoxylactic acid (P less than .001). These data show a selective effect of smoking on propranolol metabolism and suggest that side-chain oxidation and glucuronidation are mediated by isoenzymes inducible by aromatic hydrocarbons. The selective effect of smoking on the renal clearance of the major propranolol metabolite naphthoxylactic acid may be due to induction of a renal transport protein.", 
    "72": "The relationship between chronic oral dosage with a long-acting formulation of propranolol and plasma propranolol levels 22 to 23 hours later is described in 12 adult male patients with organic brain disease. Separately, the effects on plasma levels of thioridazine plus metabolites with concomitant rising dose long-acting propranolol administration were studied in five patients. Significant dose-related increases in levels of thioridazine and metabolites were found when long-acting propranolol was given. No changes in haloperidol levels were found in three patients studied in a similar protocol."
