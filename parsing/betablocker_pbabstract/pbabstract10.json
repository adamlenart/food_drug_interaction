The goal of this study was to evaluate accuracy of a novel model-based 3D tracking tool (eSie Volume Mechanics, Siemens Ultrasound, Mountain View, CA, USA) using sonomicrometry as an independent measure of cardiac deformation. Thirteen sheep were instrumented with microcrystals sutured to the epi- and endocardium of the inferolateral left ventricular wall to trace myocardial deformation along its three directional axes of motion. Paired acquisitions of RT3DE and sonomicrometry were made at baseline, during inotropic modulation and during myocardial ischemia. Accuracy of 3D strain measurements was quantified and expressed as level of agreement with sonomicrometry using linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis. Correlations between 3D strain analysis and sonomicrometry were good for longitudinal and circumferential strain components (r\u2009=\u20090.78 and r\u2009=\u20090.71) but poor for radial strain (r\u2009=\u20090.30). Accordingly, agreement (bias\u2009\u00b1\u20092SD) was -5\u2009\u00b1\u20096\u2009% for longitudinal, -5\u2009\u00b1\u20097\u2009% for circumferential, and 15\u2009\u00b1\u200919\u2009% for radial strain. Intra-observer variability was low for all components (intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) of respectively 0.89, 0.88 and 0.95) while inter-observer variability was higher, in particular for radial strain (ICC\u2009=\u20090.41). The present study shows that 3D strain analysis provided good estimates of circumferential and longitudinal strain, while estimates of radial strain were less accurate between observers.",

Treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (costing US$1000-US$7530 per DALY averted) and secondary prevention of IHD and stroke (costing US$1060-US$10,340 per DALY averted) become more efficient when delivered in integrated packages. At an annual willingness-to-pay (WTP) level of about US$3 million, a package consisting of aspirin, streptokinase, ACE-inhibitor and beta-blocker for AMI has the highest probability of being most cost-effective, whereas as WTP increases to\u00a0>\u00a0US$7 million, combination drug treatment to individuals having\u00a0>35\u00a0% absolute risk stands out as the most cost-effective strategy.

Hydrophobicity and molecular planarity played a major role in PCB sorption onto BC200 and BC700, respectively. The steric hindrance caused by non-planarity made the strong specific sorption sites on BC700 less accessible to nonplanar PCBs. In bi-solute systems for BC200, propranolol monomers at an initial concentration (Cinit) of 0.8mg/L inhibited the sorption of PCB4 by competing for sorption sites. Propranolol at Cinit larger than 1.2mg/L could form hemimicelle structures on the biochar surface, providing a favorable phase for PCB4 partitioning, thereby increasing Koc up to 1.15 times. For BC700, propranolol prohibited PCB4 sorption mainly by pore-blocking, with the log Koc being reduced from 4.92 to 3.94. This study informs the application of biochar in mixture-contaminated environment.",

Research on the pharmaceutical fate in soils is currently limited or missing. In this study, three pharmaceuticals (atenolol (ATE), carbamazepine (CAR), and metoprolol (MET)) were introduced to soils and exposed for 61 day under aerobic conditions. Thirteen different soils were used in the study to increase the understanding of pharmaceutical behaviour in the soil matrix. Ten metabolites were detected and tentatively identified. Some of them, such as atenolol acid (AAC), carbamazepine 10,11-epoxide (EPC), 10,11-dihydrocarbamazepine (DHC), trans-10,11-Dihydro-10,11-dihydroxy carbamazepine (RTC), and metoprolol acid (MAC), were consequently confirmed using commercial reference standards. It was concluded that the aerobic conditions of the experiment determined the pharmaceutical degradation pathway of studied compounds in the soils. The different amounts/rates and degradation of the transformation products can be attributed to differences in the soil properties. ATE degraded relatively quickly compared with CAR, whereas MET degradation in the soils was unclear. The persistence of CAR and its metabolites, in combination with low CAR sorption, enable the transportation of CAR and its metabolites within soils and into the ground water. Thus, CAR may cause adverse effects on the environment and humans.",

The differentiation between cardiac masses such as thrombi, vegetations, myxomas and other tumors is not always straightforward and an exact diagnosis is important because of its distinct treatment strategy. Transthoracic/esophageal echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance play an important role in establishing the diagnosis of cardiac masses. However, no current noninvasive diagnostic tool has the ability to absolutely diagnose cardiac masses; obtaining a pathological specimen by surgical resection of cardiac masses is the only reliable method to diagnose cardiac masses accurately.

The risk factors, morphology, location, and characteristics of the biatrial cardiac mass indicated a diagnosis of thrombi. However, our patient declined surgery. As a result, the nature of his cardiac masses was not specified by histology. Of note, his left atrial mass was completely regressed by long-term warfarin, leaving a residual right atrial mass. Thus, we affirmed the most probable diagnosis of cardiac thrombi. During the course of treatment, he had an episode of non-fatal ischemic stroke most probably because of a thromboembolism.",

    "41": "Catalysis of widely used chemical transformations in which the goal is to obtain the product as a pure enantiomer has become a major preoccupation of synthetic organic chemistry over the past three decades. A large number of chiral entities has been deployed to this end, many with considerable success, but one of the simplest and most effective catalytic systems to have emerged from this effort is that based on a chiral diamine, specifically trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane. While there have been attempts to improve upon this scaffold in asymmetric synthesis, few have gained the recognition needed to take their place alongside this classic diamine. The challenge is to design a scaffold that retains the assets of trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane while enhancing its intrinsic chirality and maximizing the scope of its applications. It occurred to us that cis-2,5-diaminobicyclo[2.2.2]octane could be such a scaffold. Synthesis of this diamine in enantiopure form was completed from benzoic acid, and the (1R,2R,4R,5R) enantiomer was used in all subsequent experiments in this laboratory. Condensation of the diamine with various salicyl aldehydes generated imine derivatives which proved to be excellent \"salen\" ligands for encapsulation of transition and other metals. In total, 12 salen-metal complexes were prepared from this ligand, many of which were crystalline and three of which, along with the ligand itself, yielded to X-ray crystallography. An advantage of this ligand is that it can be tuned sterically or electronically to confer specific catalytic properties on the salen-metal complex, and this feature was used in several applications of our salen-metal complexes in asymmetric synthesis. Thus, replacement of one of the tert-butyl groups in each benzenoid ring of the salen ligand by a methoxy substituent enhanced the catalytic efficiency of a cobalt(II)-salen complex used in asymmetric cyclopropanation of 1,1-disubstituted alkenes; the catalyst was employed in an improved synthesis of the cyclopropane-containing drug candidate Synosutine. Reduction of the pair of imine functions of the ligand to secondary amines permitted formation of a copper(I)-salen complex that catalyzed asymmetric Henry (\"nitroaldol\") condensation with excellent efficiency; this catalyst was applied in an economical synthesis of three drugs of the \"beta-blocker\" family including (S)-Propanolol. Chromium(II) and chromium(III) complexes were prepared from our bicyclooctane-salen ligand bearing a pair of tert-butyl groups in each benzenoid ring. These complexes were found to catalyze, respectively, enantioselective formation of homoallylic alcohols from Nozaki-Hiyama-Kishi allylation of aromatic aldehydes and dihydropyranones from hetero-Diels-Alder cycloaddition. Plausible reaction models emerging from knowledge of the absolute configuration of products from each of these reactions place the metal-coordinated substrate in a quadrant beneath the bicyclooctane scaffold so that one face of the substrate is blocked by an aryl ring of the salen ligand while the opposite face is left open to attack. The consistent and predictable stereochemical outcome from reactions catalyzed by salen-metal complexes derived from our diaminobicyclo[2.2.2]octane scaffold adds a valuable new dimension to asymmetric synthesis.",

    "48": "Women (62.4%) outnumbered men; patients were relatively young (mean age 50.1) and from the lowest socio-economic levels of the population. Nearly all (98.8%) presented with NYHA III-IV status, with correspondingly high mortality (23.3%). Echocardiography showed 73% dilated cardiomyopathy; 83% showed moderate to severe LV systolic dysfunction (mean EF 36.5 +/- 15%) and 17% preserved LV systolic function. The three principal etiologies were dilated cardiomyopathy (29%) hypertensive cardiomyopathy (27%) and peripartum cardiomyopathy (20%). Ischemic cardiomyopathy was rare (3.4%). At 27 months follow-up, 76.7% of the patients were alive and well. Among those who died, mean survival time was 113 days. Readmission carried a poor prognosis.", 
    "49": "This congestive heart failure study from Haiti shows an unusually high proportion of young women, primarily due to peripartum cardiomyopathy. Ischemic cardiomyopathy is rare, as in Africa. Further study is warranted to address the particular problem of the high frequency of peripartum cardiomyopathy in this population.", 
    "50": "Adherence to guideline-based therapy improves patient outcomes after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and hospital AMI volume is associated with reperfusion care, but the extent hospital AMI volume is associated with overall guideline adherence is unclear.", 
    "51": "We studied 486 hospitals treating 249,877 AMI patients in ACTION Registry-GWTG from January 1, 2007, to March 31, 2011. Hospital adherence to each American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association performance measure was compared between tertiles defined by hospital AMI volume: low (\u2264108 cases/y), middle (\u2265109 and \u2264227 cases/y), and high (\u2265228 cases/y). Multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, was used to examine the association between annual AMI volume and adherence to each measure. Similar modeling was used to evaluate the relationship between AMI volume and in-hospital mortality. Compared with high-volume hospitals, lower-volume hospitals were less likely to be academically affiliated, or to have cardiac surgery capabilities, electronic health records, or dedicated tobacco treatment services. Higher-volume hospitals had greater adherence to each performance measure, except aspirin use at arrival and reperfusion therapy. The greatest difference was in the rates of referral to cardiac rehabilitation (59%, 76%, and 83% in low-, middle-, and high-volume hospitals, respectively). After multivariable adjustment, higher AMI volume (up to 400 AMI patients/y) remained associated with higher-performance measure adherence. There was no association between AMI volume and in-hospital mortality after adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics.", 
    "52": "Higher hospital AMI volume was correlated with better adherence to process of care measures, but not in-hospital mortality.", 
    "53": "The benefits of secondary preventive drugs after coronary artery bypass grafting have been thoroughly established. However, the prescription rates of these drugs are low at discharge in China. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of continuous quality improvement with mobile-based interventions for clinicians on improving the guideline-adherence of secondary preventive drugs prescription.", 
    "54": "The quality MISSION-1 study is a cluster-randomized controlled trial. We enrolled 60 hospitals with a bypass surgery volume of more than 30 a year and randomly assigned them into the intervention group or the control group in a 1:1 ratio using minimized random grouping. The intervention group undertakes a series of mobile-based interventions, while the control group maintains a routine practice pattern. All sites consecutively register patients who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting and submit in-hospital data. We require supporting documents regarding prescription information at discharge to adjudicate the outcome measures. The estimated sample size of enrolled patients is 9,600. The primary outcome measure is the prescription rate of statins for eligible patients at discharge. The secondary outcome measures are \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and optimal medical therapy. MISSION-1 study is now recruiting patients.", 
    "55": "The MISSION-1 study has the potential to identify the effectiveness of interventions on improving secondary prevention adherence at discharge after bypass surgery in China and further disseminate findings to other settings to improve the quality of care.", 
    "56": "The study purpose was to evaluate preventive use of dorzolamide-timolol ophthalmic solution (Cosopt) during laparoscopic surgery with the patient in steep Trendelenburg (ST) position. Periorbital swelling, venous congestion, and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) may produce low ocular perfusion. Prompt IOP reduction is important because 30- to 40-minute episodes of acute IOP elevations can result in retinal ganglion cell dysfunction. Dorzolamide-timolol ophthalmic drops reduce IOP and may ameliorate this effect. A double-blind randomized experimental study was conducted to test the effect of dorzolamide-timolol on IOP elevation during laparoscopic surgeries in ST position. Patients were randomly assigned to receive dorzolamide-timolol treatment or balanced salt solution following anesthesia induction. The IOP levels were measured at baseline and 30-minutes intervals throughout surgery. The generalized estimating equations model was used to analyze treatment and time effects and treatment by time interactions. Ninety patients were recruited, with 46 receiving dorzolamide-timolol treatment and 44 receiving balanced salt solution. Statistical analysis revealed significant treatment and time effects and treatment-time interactions on IOP. Patients' IOP was significantly lower in the treatment group than controls (P < .05 to P < .001). Treatment effects were medium to strong. Prophylactic therapy with dorzolamide-timolol significantly reduced IOP of surgical patients during ST positioning.", 
    "57": "\u03b21-Adrenergic receptor (\u03b21-AR) stimulation modulates the antiarrhythmic activities of sodium channel blockers. The \u03b21-AR Gly389 variant shows a marked decrease in agonist-stimulated cyclic AMP production compared with that of the wild-type Arg389 in vitro. We investigated whether the Arg389Gly polymorphism affects the efficacy of flecainide, a typical sodium channel blocker, in patients with or without coadministration of \u03b2-blockers.", 
    "58": "The effects of the \u03b21-AR Arg389Gly polymorphism on the antiarrhythmic efficacy of flecainide were compared between with and without coadministered \u03b2-blockers in 159 patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmia. The antiarrhythmic efficacy of flecainide was assessed for at least 2 months by evaluating symptomatology, 12-lead ECGs, and Holter monitoring results.", 
    "59": "Genetic differences in the antiarrhythmic efficacy of flecainide were observed in patients with coadministration of \u03b2-blockers. Tachyarrhythmia was well controlled in 60% of Arg389-homozygotes, 30% of Gly389-heterozygotes, and 0% of Gly389-homozygotes (P=0.001). In contrast, no difference in the antiarrhythmic efficacy was observed among the three genotypes in the patients without coadministration of \u03b2-blockers (64, 70, and 60%, respectively). Heart rate in tachyarrhythmia in patients treated with flecainide was significantly higher in Gly389 carriers than in Arg389-homozygotes (P=0.013).", 
    "60": "The Gly389 polymorphism decreased the antiarrhythmic efficacy of flecainide when coadministered with \u03b2-blockers. The results indicate that the Arg389Gly polymorphism may play an important role in predicting the efficacy of flecainide in patients with coadministration of \u03b2-blockers.", 
    "61": "Acute myocardial infarction is one of the causal factors of society and economic losses of companionship. Success in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction raises questions on the effective rehabilitation of the first places. New methods, clinical guidelines and standards have been introduced into clinical practice. However, the effectiveness of rehabilitation in the Russian Federation lower than developed countries. The present study was aimed to improve rehabilitation care to patients after acute myocardial infarction. Analysis of the effectiveness of rehabilitation and pharmacoepidemiological studies was conducted on the basis of a medical spa facility in 2006 and 2009.", 
    "62": "Experts form and database were developed to achieve the objectives. Quantitative assessments were carried out on the basis of the developed quality indicators. We used pharmacoepidemiological and statistical methods in the study.", 
    "63": "Myocardial infarction was often combined with hypertension (73.8% and 61.9%) and chronic heart failure (87.6% and 85.8%). Patients had a high prevalence of risk factors: smoking (46.1% and 42.3%), overweight (53.8% and 67.2%), dyslipidemia (44.6% and 66.1%) in 2006 and 2009, respectively. Rehabilitation includes physical exercise, mineral baths, swimming pool. The average number of drugs of rehabilitation stage was 4,46\u00b10,12 and 4,11\u00b10,11. Beta-blockers are indicated for all patients after acute myocardial infarction, and they were prescribed in 86.1% and 90.1% of cases. Drugs affecting renin-angiotensin system were in second place frequency of prescribing. These drugs are prescribed in 67.6% and 41.7% patients. The frequency of prescribing of statins increased by 5.8 times from 2006 to 2009 and reached 81.32%.", 
    "64": "Rehabilitation and pharmacotherapy in patients after acute myocardial infarction corresponds to the principle evidence-based medicine. However, the list of use drugs was narrow, and the doses were lower than recommended by current clinical guidelines. These facts may indicate a deficiency of awareness of doctors around the characteristics of drug usage. Standards of health - resort treatment and rehabilitation of patients after myocardial infarction is limited and their revision is required based on existing clinical guidelines and evidence-based medicine.",

This study aimed at testing whether similar HRR with ivabradine vs. metoprolol differentially modulates cardiac energy substrate metabolism, a factor determinant for cardiac function, in a mouse model of dyslipidemia (hApoB(+/+);LDLR(-/-)). Following a longitudinal study design, we used 3- and 6-mo-old mice, untreated or treated for 3 mo with ivabradine or metoprolol. Cardiac function was evaluated in vivo and ex vivo in working hearts perfused with (13)C-labeled substrates to assess substrate fluxes through energy metabolic pathways. Compared with 3-mo-old, 6-mo-old dyslipidemic mice had similar cardiac hemodynamics in vivo but impaired (P < 0.001) contractile function (aortic flow: -45%; cardiac output: -34%; stroke volume: -35%) and glycolysis (-24%) ex vivo. Despite inducing a similar 10% HRR, ivabradine-treated hearts displayed significantly higher stroke volume values and glycolysis vs. their metoprolol-treated counterparts ex vivo, values for the ivabradine group being often not significantly different from 3-mo-old mice. Further analyses highlighted additional significant cardiac alterations with disease progression, namely in the total tissue level of proteins modified by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), whose formation is governed by glucose metabolism via the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, which showed a similar pattern with ivabradine vs. metoprolol treatment. Collectively, our results emphasize the implication of alterations in cardiac glucose metabolism and signaling linked to disease progression in our mouse model. Despite similar HRR, ivabradine, but not metoprolol, preserved cardiac function and glucose metabolism during disease progression.",

Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess risk factors for AKI. A comparison of incidence of AKI, hospital stay, and overall mortality in the 2 groups was performed using propensity score analysis.Of 1309 patients, 57 (4.4%) developed AKI based on Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria.

    "72": "A neuroprotective role of autophagy mediates the degradation of \u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The previous study showed cilostazol modulates autophagy by increasing beclin1, Atg5 and LC3-II expressions, and depletes intracellular A\u03b2 accumulation. This study elucidated the mechanisms through which cilostazol modulates the autophagic degradation of A\u03b2 in neurons. In N2a cells, cilostazol (10-30 \u03bcM), significantly increased the expression of P-AMPK\u03b1 (Thr 172) and downstream P-ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) (Ser 79) as did resveratrol (SIRT1 activator), or AICAR (AMPK activator), which were blocked by KT5720, compound C (AMPK inhibitor), or sirtinol. Furthermore, phosphorylated-mTOR (Ser 2448) and phosphorylated-P70S6K (Thr 389) expressions were suppressed, and LC3-II levels were elevated in association with decreased P62/Sqstm1 by cilostazol. Cilostazol increased cathepsin B activity and decreased p62/SQSTM 1, consequently decreased accumulation of A\u03b21-42 in the activated N2aSwe cells, and these results were blocked by sirtinol, compound C and bafilomycin A1 (autophagosome blocker), suggesting enhanced autophagosome formation by cilostazol. In SIRT1 gene-silenced N2a cells, cilostazol failed to increase the expressions of P-LKB1 (Ser 428) and P-AMPK\u03b1, which contrasted with its effect in negative control cells transfected with scrambled siRNA duplex. Further, N2a cells transfected with expression vectors encoding pcDNA SIRT1 showed increased P-AMPK\u03b1 expression, which mimicked the effect of cilostazol in N2a cells; suggesting cilostazol-stimulated expressions of P-LKB1 and P-AMPK\u03b1 were SIRT1-dependent. Unlike their effects in N2a cells, in HeLa cells, which lack LKB1, cilostazol and resveratrol did not elevate SIRT1 or P-AMPK\u03b1 expression, indicating cilostazol and resveratrol-stimulated expressions of SIRT1 and P-AMPK\u03b1 are LKB1-dependent. In conclusion, cilostazol upregulates autophagy by activating SIRT1-coupled P-LKB1/P-AMPK\u03b1 and inhibiting mTOR activation, thereby decreasing A\u03b2 accumulation.",

Preoperative electrocardiogram (ECG) showed first-degree atrioventricular block. The patient received no preoperative antiarrhythmic medication. During surgery, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) occurred unexpectedly with radial artery pulsation disappearing, indicating pulseless electric activity (PEA). After a five-second episode of PSVT, her sinus rhythm recovered spontaneously. However, the patient had repeated short duration of PSVT with PEA. Continuous infusion of ultra-short-acting \u03b2-blocker landiolol successfully terminated the PSVT, and sinus rhythm was restored. Postoperative ECG showed sinus rhythm.

The effects of racemate and two isomers of terbutaline were all assessed. \u03b22 adrenoceptors were stably overexpressed on HEK293 cells by lentiviral transduction method and chicken BKCa channels were transiently expressed on normal HEK293 cell line or HEK293 cells overexpressing \u03b22 receptors. Data showed that terbutaline significantly increased the single channel open probability of BKCa channel within 10min. The channel activating effects of terbutaline are stereoselective and mainly stay with the R-enantiomers. The opening probability of BKCa channel at 10min after drug application normalized to that just before drug application (Po10/Po0s) for R- and S-terbutaline were 7.85\u00b13.20 and 1.06\u00b10.45 respectively at 1\u03bcM concentration, corresponding to 28.37\u00b19.96 and 2.68\u00b11.09 at the higher concentration of 10\u03bcM. ICI 118551 blocked the effect of R- but not S-terbutaline (10\u03bcM), whereas atropine blocked the channel activating effects of S-terbutaline of higher concentration. In addition, the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol increased the BKCa channel activity in an atropine-sensitive manner as an positive control experiment, which indicate the involvement of M receptor in the channel activating effect of S-terbutaline.",

We previously found that the glucuronidation activity of racemic carvedilol in pooled human liver microsomes (HLM) was increased, R-selectively, in the presence of amiodarone. The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanisms for the enhancing effect of amiodarone on R- and S-carvedilol glucuronidation. We evaluated O-Glu formation of R- and S-carvedilol enantiomers in a reaction mixture of HLM including 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA). In the absence of amiodarone, glucuronidation activity of R- and S-carvedilol for 25\u2009min was 0.026, and 0.51\u2009pmol/min/mg protein, and that was increased by 6.15 and 1.60-fold in the presence of 50\u2009\u00b5M amiodarone, respectively. On the other hand, in the absence of BSA, or when BSA was replaced with human serum albumin, no enhancing effect of amiodarone on glucuronidation activity was observed, suggesting that BSA played a role in the mechanisms for the enhancement of glucuronidation activity. Unbound fraction of S-carvedilol in the reaction mixture was greater than that of R-carvedilol in the absence of amiodarone. Also, the addition of amiodarone caused a greater increase of unbound fraction of R-carvedilol than that of S-carvedilol. These results suggest that the altered protein binding by amiodarone is a key mechanism for R-selective stimulation of carvedilol glucuronidation.",

However, many patients are often unable to tolerate the doses of beta blocker or non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists required to achieve the desired symptom control. The selective pacemaker current inhibitor ivabradine was developed as a drug for the management of patients with angina pectoris, through its ability to reduce HR specifically. The available data suggest that ivabradine is a well-tolerated and effective anti-anginal agent and it is recommended as a second-line agent for relief of angina\u00a0in guidelines.

    "126": "In advanced heart failure (HF), chronic inotropic therapy with intravenous milrinone, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, is used as a bridge to advanced management that includes transplantation, ventricular assist device implantation, or palliation. This is especially true when repeated attempts to wean off inotropic support result in symptomatic hypotension, worsened symptoms, and/or progressive organ dysfunction. Unfortunately, patients in this clinical predicament are considered hemodynamically labile and may escape the benefits of guideline-directed HF therapy. In this scenario, chronic milrinone infusion may be beneficial as a bridge to introduction of evidence based HF therapy. However, this strategy is not well studied, and in general, chronic inotropic infusion is discouraged due to potential cardiotoxicity that accelerates disease progression and proarrhythmic effects that increase sudden death. Alternatively, chronic inotropic support with milrinone infusion is a unique opportunity in advanced HF. This review discusses evidence that long-term intravenous milrinone support may allow introduction of beta blocker (BB) therapy. When used together, milrinone does not attenuate the clinical benefits of BB therapy while BB mitigates cardiotoxic effects of milrinone. In addition, BB therapy decreases the risk of adverse arrhythmias associated with milrinone. We propose that advanced HF patients who are intolerant to BB therapy may benefit from a trial of intravenous milrinone as a bridge to BB initiation. The discussed clinical scenarios demonstrate that concomitant treatment with milrinone infusion and BB therapy does not adversely impact standard HF therapy and may improve left ventricular function and morbidity associated with advanced HF.",

Their behaviour in soil environment is largely controlled by sorption of different compounds in a soil solution onto soil constituents. Here we studied the sorption affinities of 4 pharmaceuticals (atenolol, trimethoprim, carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole) applied in solute mixtures to soils taken from different horizons of 3 soil types (Greyic Phaeozem on loess, Haplic Luvisol on loess and Haplic Cambisol on gneiss). In the case of the carbamazepine (neutral form) and sulfamethoxazole (partly negatively charged and neutral), sorption affinity of compounds decreased with soil depth, i.e. decreased with soil organic matter content. On the other hand, in the case of atenolol (positively charged) and trimethoprim (partly positively charged and neutral) compound sorption affinity was not depth dependent. Compound sorption affinities in the four-solute systems were compared with those experimentally assessed in topsoils, and were estimated using the pedotransfer rules proposed in our previous study for single-solute systems. While sorption affinities of trimethoprim and carbamazepine in topsoils decreased slightly, sorption affinity of sulfamethoxazole increased. Decreases in sorption of the two compounds could be attributed to their competition between each other and competition with atenolol. Differences between carbamazepine and atenolol behaviour in the one- and four-solute systems could also be explained by the slightly different soil properties in this and our previous study. A great increase of sulfamethoxazole sorption in the Greyic Phaeozem and Haplic Luvisol was observed, which was attributed to elimination of repulsion between negatively charged molecules and particle surfaces due to cation sorption (atenolol and trimethoprim) on soil particles. Thus, our results proved not only an antagonistic but also a synergic affect of differently charged organic molecules on their sorption to soil constituents.",

Therefore, we recommend initiating treatment at 0.5 mg/kg/day for 2 days, then 1 mg/kg/day for 1 month. If the hemangioma has not decreased in size by 1\u00a0month follow up, the dose is subsequently increased to 2 mg/kg/day.", 
    "148": "In the beating heart, cardiac myocytes (CMs) contract in a coordinated fashion, generating contractile wave fronts that propagate through the heart with each beat. Coordinating this wave front requires fast and robust signaling mechanisms between CMs. The primary signaling mechanism has long been identified as electrical: gap junctions conduct ions between CMs, triggering membrane depolarization, intracellular calcium release, and actomyosin contraction. In contrast, we propose here that, in the early embryonic heart tube, the signaling mechanism coordinating beats is mechanical rather than electrical. We present a simple biophysical model in which CMs are mechanically excitable inclusions embedded within the extracellular matrix (ECM), modeled as an elastic-fluid biphasic material. Our model predicts strong stiffness dependence in both the heartbeat velocity and strain in isolated hearts, as well as the strain for a hydrogel-cultured CM, in quantitative agreement with recent experiments. We challenge our model with experiments disrupting electrical conduction by perfusing intact adult and embryonic hearts with a gap junction blocker, \u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid (BGA). We find this treatment causes rapid failure in adult hearts but not embryonic hearts-consistent with our hypothesis. Last, our model predicts a minimum matrix stiffness necessary to propagate a mechanically coordinated wave front. The predicted value is in accord with our stiffness measurements at the onset of beating, suggesting that mechanical signaling may initiate the very first heartbeats.", 
    "149": "Catecholamine surge after traumatic injury may lead to dysautonomia with increased morbidity. Small retrospective studies have shown potential benefit of beta-blockers (BB) in trauma patients with and without traumatic brain injury (TBI). This study evaluates a large multiply injured cohort without TBI that received BB. Patients were identified from the trauma registry from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2011. Patients who received >1 dose of BB were compared to controls. Patients with TBI, length of stay (LOS) < 2 days, and prehospital BB were excluded. Outcomes were mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) LOS, and LOS. Stepwise multivariable regression was used to identify variables significantly associated with mortality. During the study period, 19,151 eligible patients were admitted. The mean age was 39 years. Most were male (74%) and most sustained blunt mechanism (75%). A total of 1854 (11%) patients received BB. BB patients had longer LOS (16 vs 6 days), ICU LOS (7 vs 1 days), and higher mortality (2.8 vs 0.5%) (all P < 0.001). Multivariable regression demonstrated no benefit to BB after adjusting for potential confounding characteristics [odds ratio (OR) 0.952; confidence interval (CI) 0.620-1.461]. In conclusion, in this largest study to date, patients receiving BB were older, more severely injured, and had a higher mortality. Unlike TBI patients, multivariable regression showed no benefit from BB in this population.",

Subjects were randomly assigned to bilateral treatments of latanoprostene bunod at 8 PM or timolol at 8 AM and 8 PM. The second laboratory recording occurred after the 4-week treatment. Subjects were crossed over to the comparator treatment for 4\u00a0weeks before the third laboratory recording.

Both treatments reduced diurnal sitting and supine IOP compared to baseline by 2.3-3.9\u00a0mm Hg (all P < .001) with no statistically significant difference between the 2 treatments.

Preliminary inhibition of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activity using ACE inhibitor enalapril (1 mg/kg, orally, 7 days) increases the sensitivity of rat kidney to drug, increasing its diuretic effect 2.33 times, natriuresis 2.49 times, and urine potassium excretion 1.80 times (p < 0.05). After the preliminary insertion of AT1 angiotensin receptor antagonist losartan (1 mg/kg, orally, 7 days), propranolol causes 1.8-fold increase in diuresis, 2.48-fold decrease in urine sodium, and 1.71-fold decrease in kaliuresis (p < 0.05). Preliminary administration of direct renin inhibitor aliskiren (4 mg/kg, orally, 7 days) is accompanied by 2.30-fold increase in the diuretic effect of propranolol, 2.56-fold increase in natriuresis, and 2.27-fold increase in urine potassium excretion (p < 0.05).

    "162": "Granules with release-sustaining properties were developed by twin screw hot melt granulation (HMG) using a combination of stearic acid (SA) and high molecular weight polyethylene oxide (PEO) as matrix for a highly water soluble model drug, metoprolol tartrate (MPT). Earlier studies demonstrated that mixing molten SA and PEO resulted in hydrogen bond formation between hydroxyl groups of fatty acid molecules and ether groups in PEO chains. These molecular interactions might be beneficial in order to elevate the sustained release effect of drugs from a SA/PEO matrix. This study aims to investigate the continuous twin screw melt granulation technique to study the impact of a SA/PEO matrix on the dissolution rate of a highly water soluble drug (MPT). Decreasing the SA/PEO ratio improved the release-sustaining properties of the matrix. The solid state of the granules was characterized using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and near infrared chemical imaging (NIR-CI) in order to understand the dissolution behavior. The results revealed a preferential interaction of the MPT molecules with stearic acid impeding the PEO to form hydrogen bonds with the stearic acid chains. However, this allowed the PEO chains to recrystallize inside the stearic acid matrix after granulation, hence, elevating the release-sustaining characteristics of the formulation.", 
    "163": "Blockage of \u03b21-adrenergic receptors is one of the most effective treatments in cardiovascular medicine. Esmolol was introduced some three decades ago as a short-acting \u03b21-selective antagonist. Landiolol is a more recent addition. Here we compared the two compounds for their selectivity for \u03b21-adrenergic receptors over \u03b22-adrenergic receptors, partial agonistic activity, signaling bias, and pharmacochaperoning action by using human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cell lines, which heterologously express each human receptor subtype. The affinity of landiolol for \u03b21-adrenergic receptors and \u03b22-adrenergic receptors was higher and lower than that of esmolol, respectively, resulting in an improved selectivity (216-fold versus 30-fold). The principal metabolite of landiolol (M1) was also \u03b21-selective, but its affinity was very low. Both landiolol and esmolol caused a very modest rise in cAMP levels but a robust increase in the phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinases 1 and 2, indicating that the two drugs exerted partial agonist activity with a signaling bias. If cells were incubated for \u226524 hours in the presence of \u22651 \u03bcM esmolol, the levels of \u03b21-adrenergic-but not of \u03b22-adrenergic-receptors increased. This effect was contingent on export of the \u03b21-receptor from endoplasmic reticulum and was not seen in the presence of landiolol. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that landiolol offers the advantage of: 1) improved selectivity and 2) the absence of pharmacochaperoning activity, which sensitizes cells to rebound effects upon drug discontinuation.",

The focus of the present work was on the chiral selectivity studies of the neutral derivatives, which are the synthesis intermediates of the sulfated products. The chiral recognition experiments proved that among the neutral compounds the HMA-\u03b2-CD shows remarkable enantioselectivity towards chiral guests in non-aqueous capillary electrophoresis, while HM-\u03b2-CD, HDA-\u03b2-CD and HDM-\u03b2-CD failed to resolve any of the 25 studied racemates under the applied experimental conditions. In order to get deeper insight into the molecular interactions between the studied single-isomer cyclodextrin and chiral fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin, gatifloxacin and lomefloxacin) and \u03b2-blockers (propranolol), (1)H and ROESY NMR experiments were performed.

A thin sweetener coating layer of saccharin was successfully included in the final dosage forms for palatability purposes using a casting knife. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and scanning white light interferometry analyses were conducted to study the effect of printing on the surface morphology and topography of the substrates. Differential scanning calorimetry and attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy were used to study the solid state properties and possible interactions between the drug and the excipients. The inkjet printing technique deposited precise and uniform escalating doses (0.08-3.16mg) of the active pharmaceutical ingredient onto the substrates (R(2)\u22650.9934). A disintegration test with clear end-point detection confirmed that all the substrates meet the requirements of the Ph. Eur. to disintegrate within 180s.

This cocktail was administered to wild type (WT, C57Bl/6) mice or mice deficient for CAR (CAR-/-) that were either fed ad libitum or fasted for 24 hours. Blood was sampled at predefined intervals and drug concentrations were measured as well as hepatic mRNA expression of homologous/orthologous P450 enzymes (Cyp1a2, Cyp2d22, Cyp3a11, Cyp2c37, Cyp2c38 and Cyp2c65).",

Fasting decreased the clearance of all drugs tested in both WT and CAR-/- mice. The absence of CAR was associated with an decrease in the clearance of omeprazole, metoprolol and midazolam in fed mice. The fasting-induced reduction in clearance of s-warfarin was greater in WT than in CAR-/-.

Although targeted therapy specifically inhibiting intracellular kinase signaling pathways has markedly changed the therapeutic landscape, side-effects and resistance of single agent targeted therapy often leads to termination of the treatment. The objective of the present study was to identify the antitumor property of the non-selective \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol for thyroid cancers. Human thyroid cancer cell lines 8505C, K1, BCPAP and BHP27 were used in the present study. Broad \u03b2-blocker propranolol and \u03b22-specific antagonist ICI118551, but not \u03b21-specific antagonist atenolol, inhibited the growth of 8505C and K1 cells. Propranolol treatment inhibited growth and induced apoptosis of 8505C cells in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo, which are closely associated with decreased expressions of cyclin\u00a0D1 and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2. Expression of hexokinase\u00a02 (HK2) and glucose transporter\u00a01 (GLUT1) also decreased following propranolol intervention. 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging of the 8505C xenografts validated shrinkage of the tumors in the propranolol-treated group when compared to the phosphate\u2011buffered saline treated group. Finally, we found that propranolol can amplify the cytotoxicity of vemurafenib and sensitize thyroid cancer cells to cytotoxic effect of vemurafenib. Our present results suggest that propranolol has potential activity against thyroid cancers and investigation of the combination with targeted molecular therapy for progressive thyroid cancers could be beneficial.",

Fasting blood glucose measurements and oral glucose tolerance tests were performed to evaluate the effect of agomelatine on glycemia, while metabolic parameters were monitored using metabolic cages. Potential effect of agomelatine on diabetes-induced mechanical and thermal allodynia was evaluated using dynamic plantar aesthesiometer and warm plate (38 \u00b0C) tests, respectively. Additionally, influence of agomelatine on hyperalgesia occurring in connection with diabetic neuropathy was examined using the Randall-Selitto (mechanical nociceptive stimulus), Hargreaves (thermal nociceptive stimulus), and cold plate (4 \u00b0C, thermal nociceptive stimulus) tests. Obtained data indicated that, in diabetic rats, agomelatine significantly improved hyperalgesia and allodynia responses, without no effect on hyperglycemia or the associated polydipsia, polyuria, and hyperphagia. Therapeutic potential of agomelatine on neuropathic pain was suppressed with \u03b1-methyl-para-tyrosine methyl ester (an inhibitor of catecholamine synthesis), phentolamine (a nonselective \u03b1-adrenoceptor antagonist), and propranolol (a nonselective \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist) administrations. However, p-chlorophenylalanine methyl ester (an inhibitor of serotonin synthesis) pretreatment could not be achieved to reverse these antihyperalgesic and antiallodynic effects. These results suggest that the curative effect of agomelatine on neuropathic pain is mediated through rising synaptic catecholamine levels as well as through interactions with both \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenoceptors. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show findings that indicate catecholaminergic system mediated antihyperalgesic and antiallodynic effects of agomelatine.",

Herein, we aim to reveal the roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in RPE dedifferentiation and seek for potential therapeutic targets. Based on the microarray data, miR-184 was sorted out as the most up-regulated signature along with the differentiation from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) to RPE cells, suggesting its potential promotive role in RPE differentiation. In vitro study indicated that miR-184 insufficiency suppressed RPE differentiation, typified by reduction of RPE markers, and promoted cell proliferation and migration. The role of miR-184 in maintaining regular RPE function was further proved in zebrafish studies. We also noticed that miR-184 expression was reduced in the macular RPE-choroid from a donor with RPE dysfunction compared to a healthy control. We next demonstrated that RAC-beta serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT2) was a direct target for miR-184. MiR-184 promoted RPE differentiation via suppression of AKT2/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. We also found that AKT2 was up-regulated in macular RPE-choroid of the donor with RPE dysfunction and dry AMD patients. Taken together, our findings suggest that miR-184 insufficiency is involved in the pathogenesis of dry AMD. MiR-184 promotes RPE differentiation via inhibiting the AKT2/mTOR signaling pathway. MiR-184 based supplementary therapeutics and mTOR blocker, like rapamycin, are prospective options for AMD treatment.",

Methods. Adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were orchidectomized fourteen days prior to receiving seven days treatment with testosterone propionate (125 \u00b5g/kg/day or 250 \u00b5g/kg/day) with or without flutamide (androgen receptor blocker) or finasteride (5\u03b1-reductase inhibitor). Following sacrifice, the kidneys were removed and were subjected for \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3-ENaC protein and mRNA expression analyses by Western blotting and Real-time PCR (qPCR) respectively. The distribution of \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3-ENaC proteins in kidneys were observed by immunofluorescence. Results. The \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3-ENaC proteins and mRNA levels in kidneys were enhanced in rats which received testosterone-only treatment. In these rats, \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3-ENaC proteins were distributed in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephrons. Co-treatment with flutamide or finasteride resulted in the levels of \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3-ENaC proteins and mRNAs in kidneys to decrease. In conclusions, increases in \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3-ENaC protein and mRNA levels in kidneys mainly in the distal tubules and collecting ducts under testosterone influence might lead to enhance Na(+) reabsorption which subsequently might cause an increase in blood pressure.",

The purpose of this paper is to review the current labeled and off-label uses of ivabradine, with a focus on clinical trial data.", 
    "233": "Congenital myasthenic syndromes (designated as CMS throughout this entry) are characterized by fatigable weakness of skeletal muscle (e.g., ocular, bulbar, limb muscles) with onset at or shortly after birth or in early childhood; rarely, symptoms may not manifest until later in childhood. Cardiac and smooth muscle are usually not involved. Severity and course of disease are highly variable, ranging from minor symptoms to progressive disabling weakness. In some subtypes of CMS, myasthenic symptoms may be mild, but sudden severe exacerbations of weakness or even sudden episodes of respiratory insufficiency may be precipitated by fever, infections, or excitement. Major findings of the neonatal-onset subtype include: respiratory insufficiency with sudden apnea and cyanosis; feeding difficulties; poor suck and cry; choking spells; eyelid ptosis; and facial, bulbar, and generalized weakness. Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita may also be present. Stridor in infancy may be an important clue to CMS. Later childhood-onset subtypes show abnormal muscle fatigability with difficulty in activities such as running or climbing stairs; motor milestones may be delayed; fluctuating eyelid ptosis and fixed or fluctuating extraocular muscle weakness are common presentations.", 
    "234": "The diagnosis of CMS is based on clinical findings, a decremental EMG response of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) on low-frequency (2-3 Hz) stimulation, a positive response to acetylcholinesterase (AchE) inhibitors, absence of anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and anti-MuSK antibodies in the serum, and lack of improvement of clinical symptoms with immunosuppressive therapy. Pathogenic variants in one of multiple genes encoding proteins expressed at the neuromuscular junction are currently known to be associated with subtypes of CMS. The most commonly associated genes include: CHAT, CHRNE, COLQ, DOK7, GFPT, and RAPSN.", 
    "235": "Treatment of manifestations: Most individuals with CMS benefit from AChE inhibitors and/or the potassium channel blocker 3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP); however, caution must be used in giving 3,4-DAP to young children and individuals with fast-channel CMS (FCCMS). Individuals with COLQ and DOK7 pathogenic variants usually do not respond to long-term treatment with AChE inhibitors. Some individuals with slow-channel CMS (SCCMS) are treated with quinidine, which has some major side effects and may be detrimental in individuals with AChR deficiency. Fluoxetine is reported to be beneficial for SCCMS. Ephedrine and albuterol have been beneficial in several individuals, especially as a therapeutic option for those with DOK7 or COLQ pathogenic variants. Prevention of primary manifestations: Prophylactic anticholinesterase therapy to prevent sudden respiratory insufficiency or apneic attacks provoked by fever or infections in those with pathogenic variants in CHAT or RAPSN. Parents of infants are advised to use apnea monitors and be trained in CPR. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Drugs known to affect neuromuscular transmission and exacerbate symptoms of myasthenia gravis (e.g., ciprofloxacin, chloroquine, procaine, lithium, phenytoin, beta-blockers, procainamide, quinidine). Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk asymptomatic family members, especially newborns or young children, who could benefit from early treatment to prevent sudden respiratory failure.", 
    "236": "Congenital myasthenic syndromes are inherited in an autosomal recessive or an autosomal dominant manner. In autosomal recessive CMS (AR-CMS), the parents of an affected child are obligate heterozygotes and therefore carry one pathogenic variant. Heterozygotes (carriers) are asymptomatic. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. In autosomal dominant CMS (AD-CMS), some individuals have an affected parent while others have a de novo pathogenic variant. The proportion of cases caused by de novo pathogenic variants is unknown. Each child of an individual with AD-CMS has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible if the pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member.", 
    "237": "An early IV beta blocker during primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been shown to reduce infarct size in ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI), although the underlying mechanism is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of early infusion of landiolol, the short-acting beta-1 adrenergic receptor blocker, on the reperfusion status in a STEMI.", 
    "238": "We conducted a prospective, single-group trial of landiolol during the primary PCI for a STEMI. Landiolol was started intravenously just before reperfusion. The reperfusion status and outcomes in 55 treated patients were compared with those in 60 historical controls treated without landiolol. The optimal reperfusion was assessed by an ST-segment resolution (STR), coronary flow, and myocardial brush grade (MBG) after reperfusion.", 
    "239": "Patients in the landiolol group achieved a higher rate of an STR (64% vs. 42%, p=0.023) and MBG 2/3 (64% vs. 45%, p=0.045), whereas coronary flow was comparable between the two groups. A multivariate analysis showed that landiolol use was an independent predictor of an STR (odds ratio 2.99, 95% confidence interval 1.25-7.16, p=0.014). The incidence of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (27% vs. 50%, p=0.014), hypotension (15% vs. 32%, p=0.046), and progression to Killip class grade III or IV (0% vs. 10%, p=0.028) were lower in the landiolol group.", 
    "240": "Early infusion of landiolol during the primary PCI was associated with optimal reperfusion and a lower incidence of adverse events in comparison with the control group.", 
    "241": "Many of the studies associating digoxin use with increased mortality were conducted before beta-blockers became a standard therapy for heart failure (HF) patients. Our goal was to determine the effect of beta-blockers on the prognosis of patients hospitalized for decompensated HF who receive digoxin therapy at discharge.", 
    "242": "We analyzed 2402 patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of decompensated HF during the prospective National Heart Failure Survey in Israel. Multivariate modeling was used to determine the effect of beta-blockers and digoxin on 1- and 10-year survival.", 
    "243": "Patients discharged on digoxin and beta-blockers (DIG+/BB+) had a lower 1-year mortality rate than those discharged on digoxin alone (DIG+/BB-), (31% vs. 44%; p<0.001). Digoxin administration was associated with an increase in adjusted 1-year (Hazard ratio [HR] 1.28; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.50) and 10-year mortality risk (HR 1.27; CI 1.16-1.42), whereas beta-blocker administration was associated with a decrease in adjusted 1-year (HR 0.76; CI 0.68-0.87) and 10-year mortality risk (HR 0.83; CI 0.77-0.89; all p<0.001). In comparison to a DIG-/BB+ group serving as a reference, multivariate adjusted HR for DIG+/BB+ and DIG+/BB- groups were 1.36 (CI 1.03-1.91; p<0.001) and 2.01 (CI 1.59-2.85; p<0.001) at 1-year, and 1.04 (CI 0.84-1.28; p>0.1) and 1.37 (CI 1.17-1.76; p<0.001) at 10years.", 
    "244": "In patients hospitalized with decompensated HF, digoxin administration at discharge is associated with increased 1- and 10-year mortality risk. However, the simultaneous use of beta-blockers and digoxin is associated with lower 1- and 10-year mortality risk when compared to use of digoxin alone.", 
    "245": "The potassium channel Kv 1.3 plays a vital part in the activation of T lymphocytes and is an attractive pharmacological target for autoimmune diseases. BmP02, a 28-residue peptide isolated from Chinese scorpion (Buthus martensi Karsch) venom, is a potent and selective Kv1.3 channel blocker. However, the mechanism through which BmP02 recognizes and inhibits the Kv1.3 channel is still unclear. In the present study, a complex molecular model of Kv1.3-BmP02 was developed by docking analysis and molecular dynamics simulations. From these simulations, it appears the large \u03b2-turn (residues 10-16) of BmP02 might be the binding interface with Kv 1.3. These results were confirmed by scanning alanine mutagenesis of BmP02, which identified His9, Lys11 and Lys13, which lie within BmP02's \u03b2-turn, as key residues for interacting with Kv1.3. Based on these results and molecular modeling, two negatively charged residues of Kv1.3, D421 and D422, located in turret region, were predicted to act as the binding site for BmP02. Mutation of these residues reduced sensitivity of Kv 1.3 to BmP02 inhibition, suggesting that electrostatic interactions play a crucial role in Kv1.3-BmP02 interaction. This study revealed the molecular basis of Kv 1.3 recognition by BmP02 venom, and provides a novel interaction model for Kv channel-specific blocker complex, which may help guide future drug-design for Kv1.3-related channelopathies.", 
    "246": "Inaccurate self-reported data on medication exposure lead to less reliable study findings. From 2013 to 2015, we assessed the validity of information on medication use collected via a mailed medication inventory among 223 Women's Health Initiative participants who were members of a health-care delivery system. Self-reported information on medication use was compared with pharmacy records for statins, calcium channel blockers, \u03b2-blockers, and bisphosphonates. We assessed sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV) for current medication use. We assessed agreement on duration of use (<2, 2, 3, 4, or \u22655 years) by means of the weighted \u03ba statistic. The mean age of participants was 77 years. Statins, \u03b2-blockers, and calcium channel blockers were each reported by over 15% of women, and bisphosphonates were reported by 4.5%. Compared with pharmacy records, the sensitivity, specificity, and PPV for self-reported use of statins, \u03b2-blockers, and calcium channel blockers were all 95% or greater. The sensitivity and PPV for bisphosphonate use were both 80% (95% confidence interval: 44, 97), and specificity was 99% (95% confidence interval: 97, 100). The \u03ba statistic for duration of use was 0.87 or greater for all 4 medication classes. Compared with pharmacy records, self-reported information on current medication use and duration of use collected via mailed medication inventory among older women had almost perfect agreement for use of statins, \u03b2-blockers, and calcium channel blockers.", 
    "247": "Roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa Linn.) calyces have demonstrated propitious cardioprotective effects in animal and clinical studies; however, little is known about its action on cardiac mechanical function. This study was undertaken to investigate direct action of roselle polyphenols (RP) on cardiac function in Langendorff-perfused rat hearts. We utilized RP extract which consists of 12 flavonoids and seven phenolic acids (as shown by HPLC profiling) and has a safe concentration range between 125 and 500\u00a0\u03bcg/ml in this study. Direct perfusion of RP in concentration-dependent manner lowered systolic function of the heart as shown by lowered LVDP and dP/dt max, suggesting a negative inotropic effect. RP also reduced heart rate (negative chronotropic action) while simultaneously increasing maximal velocity of relaxation (positive lusitropic action). Conversely, RP perfusion increased coronary pressure, an indicator for improvement in coronary blood flow. Inotropic responses elicited by pharmacological agonists for L-type Ca(2+) channel [(\u00b1)-Bay K 8644], ryanodine receptor (4-chloro-m-cresol), \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (isoproterenol) and SERCA blocker (thapsigargin) were all abolished by RP. In conclusion, RP elicits negative inotropic, negative chronotropic and positive lusitropic responses by possibly modulating calcium entry, release and reuptake in the heart. Our findings have shown the potential use of RP as a therapeutic agent to treat conditions like arrhythmia.", 
    "248": "Idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) are ventricular tachycardias (VTs) or premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) whose mechanisms are not related to myocardial scar. Idiopathic VAs occur most commonly without structural heart disease, but can occur with structural heart disease. Imaging tests, such as echocardiography, nuclear test, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, are helpful for excluding any association of an idiopathic VA occurrence with myocardial scar. Since catheter ablation emerged, the sites of idiopathic VA origins, commonly endocardial but sometimes epicardial, have been increasingly recognized. Idiopathic VAs usually originate from specific anatomical structures, and exhibit characteristic electrocardiograms based on their anatomical background. Idiopathic VAs are basically benign, but they require medical treatment or catheter ablation when idiopathic VAs are symptomatic, incessant, or produce left ventricular dysfunction. This review describes the up-to-date information on the prevalence of idiopathic VA origins relevant to the anatomy, and diagnosis, and treatment of idiopathic VAs.", 
    "249": "Beta-blockers have improved the prognosis of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy as they improve left ventricular (LV) systolic function and structure, which are crucial for myocardial recovery. However, to date, no accurate methods can predict the effectiveness of \u03b2-blocker therapy. Our goal was to evaluate whether peripheral endothelial function could be a useful predictor for \u03b2-blocker responses and related LV reverse remodeling (LVRR) in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC).", 
    "250": "Fifty-two IDC patients were recruited and underwent brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Beta-blockers were titrated to doses tolerable for each patient. LV function and structure were measured by echocardiography. A positive response to \u03b2-blockers was defined as an increase of \u226510% in LV ejection fraction (LVEF). LVRR was defined as an increase of \u226510% in LVEF and a decrease of \u226515% in LV end-systolic volume (LVESV).", 
    "251": "Baseline FMD was 8.4\u00b13.0% in IDC patients and significantly lower than healthy controls. At three-month follow-up, 54% of patients had a positive \u03b2-blocker response and 40% achieved LVRR. Patients with a positive response to \u03b2-blockers or with LVRR had significantly higher baseline FMD values than those without. FMD was the most significant predictor of changes in LVEF and LVESV. The sensitivity and specificity of baseline FMD to predict \u03b2-blocker responses was 64.3% and 83.3%, respectively, and to predict LVRR was 61.9% and 80.6%, respectively. Beta-blockers themselves did not influence FMD values.", 
    "252": "FMD could serve as an independent predictor for monitoring \u03b2-blocker therapy effectiveness in IDC patients."
