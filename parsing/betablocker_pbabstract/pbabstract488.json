The mechanism underlying the limited antiarrhythmic effects of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents against occlusion-induced arrhythmias in acutely prepared, pentobarbitone-anaesthetized rats has been investigated. 2. Atenolol, ICI 111,581 and propranolol were given at low, medium and high doses calculated to shift dose-response curves to exogenous agonists by factors of 10-30, 100-300 and 1000-3000, respectively. 3. Arrhythmias, blood pressure, heart rate, ECG changes and serum K+ were measured. 4. Antiarrhythmic activity was seen with beta-blocker treatment. This was minimal with atenolol (0.1, 1 and 10 mg kg-1) and only statistically significant with the highest dose of ICI 111,581 (5 mg kg-1), and propranolol (10 mg kg-1). 5. Treatment with beta-adrenoceptor blockers elevated serum potassium concentrations, as compared with saline controls, especially when measured at 30 min post-occlusion. 6. Only ICI 111,581 (5 mg kg-1) and propranolol (1 and 10 mg kg-1) prolonged P-R interval. 7. In order to evaluate possible mechanisms of antiarrhythmic action, attempts were made to correlate antiarrhythmic activity with beta-blockade, serum potassium concentrations, and/or with changes in the P-R interval of the ECG. 8. Reductions in arrhythmias did not correlate well with presumed beta-blockade. Better correlation was obtained with elevations of serum potassium concentration, and with prolongation of P-R interval (a presumed Class I antiarrhythmic action). 9. These results suggested that antiarrhythmic effects of adrenoceptor blocking agents in acutely-prepared anaesthetized rats, subjected to occlusion of a coronary artery, are unrelated to cardiac beta-blockade. The limited antiarrhythmic effects which were observed could be attributed to elevations in serum potassium concentration (due to peripheral beta-blockade) and/or possible Class I antiarrhythmic actions.", 
    "1": "1. Presynaptic beta-adrenoceptor activity was studied in rat isolated atria, previously loaded with [3H]-noradrenaline. The stimulation-induced release of 3H transmitter was measured in the presence of cocaine, and adrenaline was used as a facilitatory beta-adrenoceptor agonist. 2. Adrenaline (0.1 and 2 nM) increased, by about 50%, the evoked efflux of tritium. With phenoxybenzamine present, the same activity was shown with 10 nM adrenaline. 3. The beta 2-selective adrenoceptor blocking drugs: IPS 339 and ICI 118 551 caused a concentration-dependent decrease in the activity of adrenaline. Cardioselective beta-blocking drugs: acebutolol, beta-xolol, nebivolol and its isomers (R 67 138 and R 67 145) also reduced dose-dependently the agonistic action of adrenaline. The order of potency for nebivolol and its isomers was R 67 138 greater than nebivolol greater than R 67 145. The activity of pindolol was not concentration-dependent. The inhibitory effect of acebutolol was also observed in the presence of blockade of alpha-adrenoceptors. 4. The postsynaptic beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity of nebivolol and its isomers was studied in pithed rats. They reduced isoprenaline-induced tachycardia without altering hypotensive responses. The order of potency was: R 67 138 greater than nebivolol greater than R 67 145. 5. It is concluded that in rat isolated atria, presynaptic beta 2- and beta 1-adrenoceptors coexist and that facilitatory beta 1-adrenoceptors are stereospecific.", 
    "2": "The haemodynamic and hormonal effects of an elective change of antihypertensive therapy from a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug to a converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, were monitored in 12 hypertensive in-patients (WHO I). Blood pressure and heart rate were determined every 2-4 h using an automatic sphygmomanometer during an abrupt cessation of the previous beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug and commencement of treatment with enalapril 20 mg o.d. 12 h later. Mean blood pressure values at rest and during the hand grip test were lower when on enalapril, but heart rate was significantly higher, and three patients suffered from palpitations during the change. The change resulted in an improvement in cardiac function both at rest and during isometric work, as shown by echocardiography. A rapid decrease in plasma angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity and an increase in renin activity were also seen after the change, while plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) decreased towards normal values. The results suggest that an abrupt change from a chronic beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug to enalapril is safe, feasible and is likely to produce favourable haemodynamic and hormonal effects in hypertensive patients.", 
    "3": "Despite advances in the treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF), the mortality rate continues to be high. A large number of the deaths are sudden, presumably due to ventricular arrhythmias. Complex ventricular arrhythmias are recorded in as many as 80% of patients with CHF, with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia occurring in 40%. The latter appears to be an independent predictor of mortality. Chronic structural abnormalities responsible for CHF may be the basis for the capability of a ventricle to support life-threatening arrhythmias, which are triggered by premature ventricular contractions. The pathogenesis of arrhythmias is multifactorial. Electrolyte abnormalities, ischemia, catecholamines, inotropic and antiarrhythmic drugs may worsen arrhythmias and increase susceptibility of a ventricle to sustained arrhythmias. Beta-adrenergic blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have a beneficial effect. The role of various drugs in the pathogenesis and treatment of ventricular arrhythmias is discussed. The efficacy of antiarrhythmic therapy targeted to asymptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, in order to prevent sudden death, is controversial. Pharmacotherapy guided by electrophysiologic testing is the treatment of choice for patients who have manifest sustained ventricular tachycardia, but patients resuscitated from ventricular fibrillation may require automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator.", 
    "4": "The search for the basic mechanism(s) responsible for the progressive and frequently irreversible deterioration of left ventricular pump function in congestive heart failure has been quite extensive; nonetheless, no single explanation has been forthcoming. Indeed, given the complexity of this disease process, it is becoming increasingly unlikely that a single pathogenetic mechanism will ever be uncovered for congestive heart failure. This review will examine recent experimental and clinical evidence which suggests that excessive adrenergic stimulation of the heart is double-edged. That is, while increased adrenergic input to the heart may initially enable the failing myocardium to function adequately for a period of months to years, continued excessive adrenergic stimulation of the heart through both local neural and circulating catecholamines may lead to frank myopathic effects on the heart, with resultant worsening of left ventricular function and the development of intractable congestive heart failure. While we do not mean to suggest that excessive sympathetic stimulation of the heart is the only, or even the major mechanism responsible for the development of irreversible congestive heart failure, the data reviewed herein do suggest that adrenergic stimulation may play a primary role in the pathogenesis of congestive heart failure.", 
    "5": "We report the successful treatment with esmolol of intraoperative myocardial ischaemia associated with concurrent hypertension and tachycardia, in a patient with risk factors for coronary artery disease undergoing peripheral vascular surgery. The pathophysiology of myocardial ischaemia, and the therapeutic role of beta blocking drugs are briefly reviewed. Esmolol, a short-acting cardioselective beta blocking drug, was administered in a bolus of 1.5 mg.kg-1, and resulted in prompt resolution of the haemodynamic abnormalities, with concomitant restitution of the ST segments to isoelectric baseline. We conclude that bolus administration of esmolol is practical and can be effective for the treatment of intraoperative myocardial ischaemia.", 
    "6": "In a double-masked crossover study, the dose-response relationship for aqueous flow was determined for four concentrations of betaxolol hydrochloride and levobunolol hydrochloride in 19 normal subjects. One eye of each subject received every concentration of both drugs. Each concentration was administered once daily for 1 week. The fellow eye received a placebo. Aqueous flow was measured for several hours on the last day of administration of each concentration beginning immediately after drug administration. For levobunolol, the mean decrease in aqueous flow compared with baseline was 8% after 1 week's treatment with 0.017% levobunolol, 15% after treatment with 0.05%, 20% after treatment with 0.167%, and 32% after treatment with 0.5%. For betaxolol, the mean decrease in aqueous flow compared with baseline was 3% after 1 week's treatment with 0.017% betaxolol, 12% after treatment with 0.05%, 18% after treatment with 0.167%, and 17% after treatment with 0.5%. Levobunolol-treated eyes but not betaxolol-treated eyes showed a significant drug effect 1 week after discontinuing the drug therapy. The relative potency of the noncardioselective drug was greater than that of the beta 1-cardioselective drug, but the difference in potency was much less than would be expected solely based on their relative affinity for beta 2-receptors in other species and tissues.", 
    "7": "Three hundred fifty-three patients whose intraocular pressure was controlled with a timolol maleate ophthalmic solution were studied. Following a baseline period, half were switched (masked and randomized) to treatment with a betaxolol hydrochloride ophthalmic solution and were followed up for 12 weeks. Intraocular pressure, signs, and symptoms were recorded at weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12. Those patients switched to the betaxolol ophthalmic solution had a significant increase in both ocular side effects (burning/stinging and tearing) and intraocular pressure at weeks 4, 8, and 12 when compared with those patients who continued to receive timolol.", 
    "8": "The effects of adrenergic drugs on the release of immunoreactive angiotensin II (ANG II-ir) from brain cells in culture were examined. In neuronal cultures, basal release of Ang II-ir was 43.65 +/- 7.44 pg/5-min incubation period (n = 14 experiments; 52 individual determinations), and in astrocytic glial cultures, it was 21.76 +/- 5.7 pg (n = 8 experiments; 24 individual determinations) when cells were exposed to buffer alone. Incubation of neuronal cultures with the alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine (0.1-50 microM, 5 min) caused concentration-dependent increases in ANG II-ir release above basal levels. Analysis of the released material by high-pressure liquid chromatography revealed that authentic ANG II was present. No increase in the release of ANG II-ir was seen from glial cells. Experiments using neuronal cultures revealed that the yohimbine-induced release of ANG II-ir may be secondary to increased norepinephrine (NE) release. Incubation of neuronal cultures with NE (10 nM-50 microM) caused concentration-dependent increases in the release of ANG II-ir. This effect of NE was not inhibited by the alpha 1-adrenergic blocker prazosin. However, a weaker release of ANG II-ir from neuronal cultures was stimulated by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol at 100 microM. These data show that ANG II-ir can be released from neuronal but not glial cell cultures by adrenergic receptor-mediated mechanisms.", 
    "9": "In a prospective study, the addition of dipivefrin hydrochloride 0.1% twice daily to one eye of 32 patients with early primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, maintained on a bilateral beta 1-, beta 2-blocker twice daily, resulted in a significant decrease of mean intraocular pressure (IOP) from 22.7 +/- 3.9 to 20.2 +/- 3.4 mmHg at 1 week (P = 0.0001) and to 21.0 +/- 3.8 mmHg at 12 weeks (P less than 0.02) in the dipivefrin-treated eyes. On the other hand, no significant change was noted in the fellow eyes (from 21.7 +/- 4.1 to 21.6 +/- 4.0 mmHg at 1 week and to 21.3 +/- 4.2 mmHg at 12 weeks). The addition of dipivefrin resulted in an IOP reduction of 2 mmHg or more in 50% and 3 mmHg or more in 19% of the eyes throughout the 12-week therapy. The result of the current study provides a realistic guideline as to what to expect from the common practice of adding dipivefrin hydrochloride to a beta 1-, beta 2-blocker regimen.", 
    "10": "To determine the relation between QT duration and RR interval on the electrocardiogram, 2 studies were undertaken in 23 young healthy volunteers (mean age 24 years). In study 1, the electrocardiogram (paper speed at 50 mm/s, 800 measurements/subject) was recorded in 11 subjects (5 men, 6 women) at rest, during dynamic exercise and after rapid intravenous injections of isoproterenol (0.2 to 12.8 micrograms), before and after intravenous atropine (2 mg). In study 2, the QT-RR relation was studied at rest and during exercise in 12 subjects (6 men, 6 women) before and after oral propranolol (80 mg). The results confirmed a monoexponential individual relation of the QT and RR intervals during rest and exercise: QT = A-B.Exp (-k.RR). By pooling the RR-QT plots from the 11 subjects in study 1, we found that the measured QT interval = 425-676.Exp (-3.7.10(-3) RR. During isoproterenol-induced tachycardia, QT either did not change or increased and this may indicate an increase in temporal dispersion of ventricular repolarization. Atropine-induced tachycardia produced changes similar to those resulting from exercise testing. Propranolol did not change the QT-RR relation despite a lengthening in RR intervals. These results suggest that physiologic QT-RR adaptation is mainly under parasympathetic control.", 
    "11": "Congestive heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome characterized by circulatory and metabolic abnormalities. It has been apparent for more than 25 years that the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are markedly activated in the late stages of heart failure. These two systems interact to facilitate sympathetic drive and promote salt and water retention. Circumstantial evidence is now accumulating to indicate that excessive sympathetic drive and angiotensin II activity may contribute to the pathophysiology of heart failure. These observations suggest that a dual strategy of modulating sympathetic nervous system activity to the heart while blocking angiotensin II activity may provide a rational therapeutic approach to the treatment of heart failure. Xamoterol, a beta 1 partial agonist, may enhance myocardial contractile force in the steady state, while acting to inhibit excessive sympathetic drive during exercise or severe heart failure. The concomitant use of a converting-enzyme inhibitor would be expected to blunt the detrimental effects of excessive angiotensin II activity. Modulation of adrenergic drive coupled with inhibition of marked angiotensin II activity may be potentially more effective in the treatment of congestive heart failure than either strategy used alone.", 
    "12": "MAT is an uncommon arrhythmia most often seen in elderly patients with chronic pulmonary disease who are critically ill due to acute respiratory or cardiac decompensation. Its importance lies in the fact that it is commonly mistaken for AF, since both disorders are characterized by narrow ventricular complexes, irregular rates, and (depending on the ECG lead observed in MAT) by an apparent lack of P wave activity. This may lead to treatment with digoxin, a drug known to be ineffective in the therapy of MAT, with the potential for producing toxicity in patients who are predisposed. The incidence of MAT in hospitalized patients in various studies ranges from 0.13% to 0.40%. The mechanism of the arrhythmia is thought to be triggered activity arising from increased intracellular calcium stores that may be produced by hypokalemia, hypoxia, acidemia, and increased catecholamines, characteristics commonly found in patients with MAT. COPD, coronary artery disease, CHF, and infection (both pulmonary and nonpulmonary) are the most common clinical settings of MAT. Mortality is very high in all patients studied, ranging from 38% to 62%, and is due to their underlying disease processes and not to the arrhythmia. The need for intubation and mechanically assisted ventilation portends a particularly poor prognosis for survival. Treatment should initially consist of correction of the precipitating causes, as it is common for patients to convert to sinus rhythm both spontaneously and after these measures are taken.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "13": "There is little doubt that the \"stunned myocardium\" is amenable to therapeutic intervention, as a host of diverse pharmacologic agents have all been shown to improve short-term contractile function of viable, previously ischemic myocardium. However, few studies have addressed the question: Should the stunned myocardium be forced to contract? If the stunned myocardium is a protective mechanism, then acute recruitment could have later deleterious consequences on recovery of contractile function and high-energy phosphate stores. Conversely, acutely \"resting\" the heart (i.e. by beta-adrenergic blockade) could conceivably enhance or accelerate recovery of the stunned, postischemic tissue. We therefore sought to assess the immediate and longer-term effects of acute recruitment and acute beta-blockade on regional wall thickening (WT: using two-dimensional echocardiography) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content in the canine model of the stunned myocardium. Anesthetized open-chest dogs underwent 15 minutes of transient coronary artery occlusion. At 30 minutes following reperfusion, the dogs acutely received either: the ultrashort-acting beta-blocker esmolol, the afterload reducing and cardiostimulatory agent hydralazine, or saline. As anticipated, hydralazine enhanced contractile function of the stunned tissue in the short term: WT at 2 hours after treatment was 53.7 +/- 6.9% versus 7.1 +/- 6.5% in treated versus saline controls (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "14": "Surveys that evaluated antihypertensive drug-prescribing patterns were mailed to 150 family physicians and 150 primary care internists. The initial mailing was followed by a telephone follow-up and a second mailing. Forty-seven percent of family physicians and 41.9% of the internists who were still in practice returned the questionnaire. When asked about their choice of antihypertensive drug therapy for specific patients (based upon age, race, sex, and coexisting disease), the responses of the two specialties were similar. The only statistically significant difference was observed in the responses for a 58-year-old obese white woman with diabetes and renal impairment. In this example, the family physicians were more likely than internists to recommend an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or a beta-blocker (P = .036). This study demonstrates that the majority of physicians individualized initial therapy for hypertension to the specific patient rather than strictly following a stepped-care approach with diuretics or beta-blockers as initial therapy.", 
    "15": "The effectiveness and safety of once-daily administration of drugs in the treatment of moderate to severe hypertension was studied. Forty men taking diuretics were randomized to atenolol (A, n = 18), 50 mg/day, or betaxolol (B, n = 22), a new B1-blocker, 20 mg/day, if their SDAP was 105 to 125 mm Hg at baseline (weeks 2 to 4). At week 6, if SDAP was greater than 95 mm Hg, minoxidil (M), 5.5 mg/day, was added. The patients were seen every two weeks to week 16 (end of drug titration) and then every four weeks to week 32. The dosages were increased to 200 mg/day for A, 80 mg/day for B, and 20 mg/day for M as needed. Physical examinations, chest x-ray films, ECGs, echocardiograms, spirometric studies, 24-h ambulatory arterial pressures (AAP), and blood chemistry analyses were done at baseline and during treatment. A and B combined with a diuretic (furosemide, F) and M decreased the arterial pressures and heart rates equally well by both clinical and AAP measurements (p less than .001). The IVS was decreased (p less than .05), whereas LVIDd, RVIDd, and cardiothoracic ratios were increased by both A and B (p less than .05, p less than .01). No changes were noted in LVPW, LVM, EF, FS, spirometric values, or blood chemistry analyses. Common side effects were weight gain, edema, and hypertrichosis. Once-daily administration of A or B in combination with F and M were effective in the treatment of moderate to severe hypertension. Although effective, prolonged use of M may lead to volume overload and cardiomegaly. The significance of these latter findings is not yet known.", 
    "16": "Sympathetic vasoconstriction not mediated by alpha-adrenoceptors has been identified in vitro and in animals but not in humans. We evaluated the effect of alpha-adrenoceptor blockade on either endogenous vascular sympathetic activation (obtained through the application of a nonhypotensive lower-body negative pressure, -10 mm Hg for 5 minutes) or selective postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation by exogenous norepinephrine (0.005 micrograms/100 ml forearm tissue/min for 3 minutes) in the presence of beta-blockade by propranolol (10 micrograms/100 ml forearm tissue/min for 15 minutes). Drugs were infused into the brachial artery at systemically ineffective rates while continuously monitoring forearm blood flow (by venous plethysmography), intra-arterial mean arterial pressure, and heart rate in patients with essential hypertension. The irreversible antagonist phenoxybenzamine was used at a rate of 20 micrograms/100 ml forearm tissue/min for 1 hour, which antagonized the local responses to norepinephrine in a range of 0.005-0.05 micrograms/100 ml forearm tissue/min. During saline administration, either lower-body negative pressure or exogenous norepinephrine decreased forearm blood flow comparably. However, after phenoxybenzamine administration, forearm vasoconstriction to norepinephrine was abolished while a residual response to lower-body negative pressure remained in each patient. To exclude insufficient alpha-adrenoceptor blockade, the same experimental protocol was repeated by doubling phenoxybenzamine concentrations. No difference from the data obtained with the lower level of antagonist was found. Further studies were performed to confirm the sympathetic origin of the residual vasoconstriction. Bretylium tosylate, a neurotransmitter blocker, infused into the brachial artery (50 micrograms/100 ml forearm tissue/min for 90 minutes) abolished the effect of endogenous sympathetic activation but did not alter the effect of exogenous norepinephrine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "17": "We have recently reported that the tobacco-related nitrosamines N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN) and 4-(methyl-nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) stimulate cell proliferation in cell lines derived from human neuroendocrine carcinoma and adenocarcinoma (comprised of Clara cells) of the lung. In the neuroendocrine cell line, this effect was inhibited by antagonists of nicotinic cholinergic receptors which regulate the secretion of peptide hormones and cell proliferation of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells. No such inhibition was observed in the adenocarcinoma line. Clara cells reportedly do not have acetylcholine receptors and secretion of this cell type is regulated by beta-adrenergic receptors instead. In this experiment, we test the hypothesis that the latter types of receptors are involved in the regulation of cell growth of normal and nitrosamine-stimulated adenocarcinoma cells with features of Clara cells. Our data demonstrate a pronounced stimulation of cell growth by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, DEN and NNK, as well as a dose-dependent inhibition of such growth-stimulating effects by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. These findings suggest an important role of beta-adrenergic receptors in the regulation of cell proliferation in lung tumors comprised of this cell type.", 
    "18": "Two cell cultures, NEP2 and NEM2, isolated from human foetal brain have been maintained through several passages and found to express some properties of astrocytes. Both cell cultures contain adenylate cyclase stimulated by catecholamines with a potency order of isoprenaline greater than adrenaline greater than salbutamol much greater than noradrenaline, which is consistent with the presence of beta 2-adrenergic receptors. This study reports that the beta 2-adrenergic-selective antagonist ICI 118,551 is approximately 1,000 times more potent at inhibiting isoprenaline stimulation of cyclic AMP (cAMP) formation in both NEP2 and NEM2 than the beta 1-adrenergic-selective antagonist practolol. This observation confirms the presence of beta 2-adrenergic receptors in these cell cultures. The formation of cAMP in NEP2 is also stimulated by 5'-(N-ethylcarboxamido)adenosine (NECA) more potently than by either adenosine or N6-(L-phenylisopropyl)adenosine (L-PIA), which suggests that this foetal astrocyte expresses adenosine A2 receptors. Furthermore, L-PIA and NECA inhibit isoprenaline stimulation of cAMP formation, a result suggesting the presence of adenosine A1 receptors on NEP2. The presence of A1 receptors is confirmed by the observation that the A1-selective antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine reverses the inhibition of isoprenaline stimulation of cAMP formation by L-PIA and NECA. Additional evidence that NEP2 expresses adenosine receptors linked to the adenylate cyclase-inhibitory GTP-binding protein is provided by the finding that pretreatment of these cells with pertussis toxin reverses the adenosine inhibition of cAMP formation stimulated by either isoprenaline or forskolin.", 
    "19": "We assessed the response of the adrenergic receptor in pancreatic glucagon secretion to central nervous system stimulation. Injection of neostigmine (5 x 10(-8) mol) into the third cerebral ventricle in intact rats resulted in increased epinephrine and norepinephrine secretion associated with glucagon secretion. This glucagon secretion was still observed in bilateral adrenalectomized (ADX) rats, although its concentration was significantly lower than that in the intact rats. This glucagon rise was significantly inhibited by ip treatment of ganglionic blocker with hexamethonium. Intraperitoneal injection of alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist phentolamine (5 x 10(-7) mol), but not of beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol (1 x 10(-6) mol), reduced the hyperglucagonemic effect of a subsequent neostigmine injection in intact and ADX rats, although these antagonists did not influence epinephrine or norepinephrine secretion in intact rats. In addition, ip injection of the selective alpha 2-receptor antagonist yohimbine (5 x 10(-7) mol), but not of the selective alpha 1-receptor antagonist prazosin (1 x 10(-6) mol), inhibited the neostigmine-induced glucagon secretion in intact and ADX rats. From this evidence it is suggested that central nervous system-mediated glucagon release is enhanced by alpha 2-adrenoreceptor stimulation by either catecholamines or the autonomic nervous system.", 
    "20": "Preincubation of guinea-pig lung membranes with the beta-agonist isoprenaline or with the partial beta-agonist terbutaline, followed by repeated washing, causes a 35% decrease in the number of beta-adrenoceptors (R). This decrease corresponds to the tight binding of the agonist (H) to R as a result of the formation of a complex between H.R. and the stimulatory guanine nucleotide regulatory component (Ns). Tight binding of the agonist is dependent on the presence of magnesium ions and is reversed by GTP. However, the stability of the H.R.Ns-complex is limited even in the absence of GTP. Under these conditions, the complex is more stable when induced by isoprenaline than by terbutaline. When the alkylating reagent N-ethylmaleimide is included in the agonist preincubation step, tight binding of isoprenaline and terbutaline is increased to about 55% of the receptor population and is no longer dependent on the presence of magnesium ions. This value is in good agreement with the percentage of agonist high affinity sites, determined by isoprenaline/[3H]-dihydroalprenolol competition binding studies.", 
    "21": "The selectivity of binding of 125I-iodocyanopindolol (125I-ICYP) to beta 1-, beta 2-adrenergic and 5HT1B-serotonergic receptors were analysed using both the Scatchard and displacement methods. When the binding of 125I-ICYP to the rat brain membrane was examined by means of the displacement analysis with l-metoprolol, triphasic displacement curves were observed. Analyses carried out on the basis of the displacement of 125I-ICYP by beta-selective antagonists, alpha-adrenergic agonists and antagonists, and serotonergic agonists and antagonists indicated the correspondence of the super high, high- and low-affinity sites of 125I-ICYP binding to beta 2-, beta 1-adrenergic and 5HT1B-receptors, respectively. By contrast, the Scatchard analysis revealed the biphasic character of the 125I-ICYP binding and the complete inhibition of the binding to high- and low-affinity sites by l-metoprolol (30 microM) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, 10 microM), respectively, suggesting the correspondence of the high- and low-affinity sites to beta-adrenergic and 5HT1B-receptors. Thus, regarding the determination of the selectivity of binding of a radioligand, the displacement analysis is more informative than the Scatchard analysis. In the case of 125I-ICYP the separation of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors becomes feasible only with the displacement method.", 
    "22": "Pharmacological agents are widely used to probe the mechanism of action of TRH. A number of these drugs behave as local anesthetics at high concentrations. The effect of local anesthetics on the binding of [3H]Me-TRH to specific receptors was studied using the GH4C1 line of rat pituitary tumor cells. [3H]Me-TRH binding was inhibited by classical local anesthetics with the order of potency (IC50 values): dibucaine (0.37 mM) greater than tetracaine (1.2 mM) greater than lidocaine (3.3 mM) greater than procaine and benzocaine (greater than 10 mM). IC50 values for other drugs with local anesthetic properties that inhibited [3H]Me-TRH were: 100 microM trifluoperazine, 100 microM imipramine, 170 microM chlorpromazine, 300 microM verapamil, and 700 microM propranolol. Inhibition by tetracaine and verapamil increased as the pH was raised from 6 to 8.5, indicating that the free base form of the amine drugs was the inhibitory species, and the local anesthetic effect was greater at 37 C than at 24 C or 0 C. [3H]Me-TRH binding to receptors in isolated membranes was inhibited to the same extent as binding to receptors on intact cells. Local anesthetics were 3- to 20-fold less potent at inhibiting [3H]Me-TRH to digitonin-solubilized receptors than binding to intact cells. In contrast, the potency of chlordiazepoxide, a putative TRH antagonist, to inhibit [3H]Me-TRH binding was equal using cells and solubilized receptors (IC50 = 10 microM). Local anesthetics inhibited TRH-stimulated PRL release and also inhibited basal PRL secretion and secretion stimulated by two nonhormonal secretagogues, (Bu)2cAMP and a phorbol ester.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "23": "To study the relationship between the progesterone environment and beta-adrenoceptors in the myometrium, rats were treated with the antiprogestin RU 486 (10 mg per rat) at 08:30 h on day 21 of gestation. Under these conditions, more than 60% of animals delivered within 24 h after this treatment, while none of the control animals delivered within the same time period. beta-Adrenoceptors were identified using the radiolabeled antagonist (-)-[125I] iodocyanopindolol. The density (Bmax approximately 33-45 fmol/mg protein) and the affinity (KD approximately 0.105-0.106 nM) were not changed (during the late stages of gestation) in RU 486 treated rats compared with control rats. These results were correlated with the relaxation of longitudinal and circular strips of myometrium placed in high KC1 medium and exposed to beta-adrenoceptor agonists. The adrenoceptors implicated in the relaxation of myometrial strips were mainly of the beta 2-subtype. There was no difference in their affinity between control and RU 486 treated rats. Mean pA2 values were 8.46 for propranolol and 8.27 for ICI 118-551 against salbutamol. Altogether these results indicate in the rat that the blockade of the action of progesterone at its receptor site by RU 486 did not modify either the affinity or the sensitivity of beta 2-adrenoceptors in the myometrium, although it induced parturition.", 
    "24": "Effect of propranolol on activity of basal ATP-ase measured in presence of Mg2+ activator, on that of total ATP-ase determined in presence of Mg2+, Na+, K+ activators and on that of Na+,K+-activated ATP-ase calculated from the difference of the previous two ones has been studied. Propranolol has not considerably influenced basal ATP-ase activity in 10(-7)-10(-4) M concentrations, 30-50% inhibition has been found in 1 X 10(-3)-5 X 10(-3) M concentrations. Effect of propranolol on total ATP-ase activity has been found to be dependent on doses and inhibition has been greater than inhibition experienced in case of basal ATP-ase. Enzyme kinetic investigations have shown that in case of basal ATP-ase propranolol has only decreased affinity to substrate but has not influenced rate of enzyme reaction, in case of total ATP-ase the affinity to the substrate has not changed but the reaction rate has significantly decreased. Ineffective concentrations of propranolol have potentiated inhibition effect of Na+,K+-ATP-ase. The authors have supposed that the observed changes have been results of non-specific membrane effects of propranolol and composition of membrane lipids may also play an important role.", 
    "25": "It has been shown recently that catecholestrogens are produced by cultured porcine granulosa and thecal cells, and that they influence porcine granulosa cell steroidogenesis in a similar manner to estradiol-17 beta (E2). The present studies were performed to determine if catecholestrogens also play a role in the regulation of porcine thecal cell steroidogenesis and to compare their actions to those of E2. Thecal cells were obtained from prepubertal gilts and cultured in a serum-free medium for 48 h. Thecal cell androstenedione production under basal and luteinizing hormone (LH)-stimulated conditions was significantly inhibited by adding E2 or catecholestrogens to the culture medium. Treatment of basal and LH-stimulated cultures with increasing concentrations of E2 or catecholestrogens (0.1-10 micrograms/ml) caused a dose-and time-dependent inhibition of androstenedione production. The inhibitory effect of the catecholestrogens, but not of E2, was enhanced when the cultures contained the catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitor, U-0521. Studies to determine the mechanism(s) of action of the catecholestrogens showed that E2 and catecholestrogen actions are exerted at a site(s) distal to cyclic adenosine 3'5' monophosphate (cyclic AMP) generation, because neither agent affected the basal or LH-stimulated accumulation of extracellular cyclic AMP, while causing a significant inhibition of androstenedione production. E2 or catecholestrogen treatment also inhibited androstenedione production stimulated by prostaglandin E2 and dibutyryl cyclic AMP. In addition, both E2 and catecholestrogen treatment significantly decreased basal and LH-stimulated 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone production, while significantly increasing pregnenolone production. Progesterone production in the presence of E2 or catecholestrogens showed small but statistically insignificant increases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "26": "The interaction of 5 alpha-pregnane-3 alpha-ol-20-one (5 alpha 3 alpha P), a progesterone metabolite, with the GABAA receptor chloride channel complex was investigated at the pituitary level. In nanomolar concentrations this steroid potentiated the inhibitory effect of muscimol (a GABAA agonist) on prolactin release from rat pituitary cells in culture. In micromolar concentrations 5 alpha 3 alpha P had a direct inhibitory effect, similar to that of muscimol, with an IC50 value of 370 nM. This effect was antagonized by bicuculline, a GABAA antagonist, and by picrotoxin, a chloride ion channel blocker. Its reduced isomer, 5 alpha 3 beta P, and progesterone (Pg) were devoid of activity. Using [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS) as a ligand, we demonstrated, for the first time, specific barbiturate sites on pituitary membranes, similar to those of the central nervous system, with a Kd value of 25 nM and a Bmax value of 62 fmol/mg protein. 5 alpha 3 alpha P inhibited the binding of [35S]TBPS. In contrast, its 3 beta isomer was inactive. These data show that 5 alpha 3 alpha P enhanced the activity of the GABAA receptor complex at the pituitary level and suggest that its inhibitory effect on prolactin release might be mediated by the barbiturate site or by a closely related site.", 
    "27": "1. The effects of (+/-)-carteolol 10(-8) M to 10(-6) M, a non-selective beta-antagonist, applied cumulatively, on stimulation-evoked 3H-release at 1 Hz were studied in pulmonary arteries isolated from guinea-pigs. The guinea-pigs were subjected to either bilateral adrenalectomy, adrenalectomy followed by injections of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) and hydrocortisone, bilateral adrenodemedullation or a sham operation, and then loaded in vitro with [3H]-noradrenaline. 2. Carteolol inhibited 3H-output in arteries from sham-operated animals in a concentration-dependent manner. This inhibitory effect was not found in pulmonary arteries from animals subjected to adrenalectomy or adrenodemedullation. However, DOCA and hydrocortisone pretreatment, did not prevent the disappearance of the carteolol-induced inhibition of 3H-release. 3. Adrenalectomy and adrenodemedullation depleted or markedly reduced the endogenous contents of adrenaline in pulmonary arteries without altering the levels of dopamine and noradrenaline. 4. It is concluded that adrenaline, mainly derived from the adrenal medulla, acts as an endogenous agonist for tonically functioning prejunctional beta-adrenoceptors in guinea-pig pulmonary arteries, probably by being taken up and co-released with noradrenaline.", 
    "28": "In this pilot study, 9/9 patients with panic disorder experienced a lactate-induced panic attack as compared with 0/9 controls. Baseline measurements were significant for higher anxiety self-ratings, higher heart and respiratory rates, elevated potassium, and lower lymphocyte 3H-dihydroalprenolol (DHA) binding in the patient group. Spielberger State anxiety scores correlated with baseline mean heart rate, and Spielberger Trait anxiety scores with lymphocyte DHA binding. The lactate infusion was not found to differentially affect any physiological or biochemical measures in the two groups, though heart rate surges occurred in most patients. Intravenous propranolol reduced the panic to a negligible degree, whereas intravenous diazepam was quite effective. Neurobiological implications are discussed, and the contradictory biological findings in the lactate literature are reviewed.", 
    "29": "The binding of epinephrine to beta-adrenergic receptors is a rapid-on, rapid-off process, such that at any level of receptor occupancy (defined as the fraction of time a receptor is bound or, alternatively, the probability that any particular receptor is bound at any given instant) the entire population of available receptors has periods of occupancy that occur at high frequency. While in the bound state, the receptor acts as a mobile catalyst for the activation of adenylate cyclase. Two processes, then, could conceivably contribute to the access of epinephrine-bound receptors to cyclase and the extent of cyclase activation for a given concentration of epinephrine: 1) the rapid switching of epinephrine among receptors ensures that discontinuous distributed regions of the cell surface experience agonist activity and 2) the mobility of the receptors (and GTP-binding protein) in the cell membrane makes it possible for one receptor to activate numerous GTP-binding protein-adenylate cyclase complexes. In principle, either effect can lead to a wide separation between the binding and response curves (EC50 much less than Kd). It has so far been assumed that mobility is able to account completely for the separation. The extent of the contribution of the process of agonist binding and unbinding to adenylate cyclase activation has not been demonstrated or quantified. Here we examine the distinction between binding frequency and receptor mobility contributions to adenylate cyclase activation in epinephrine-stimulated S49 lymphoma cells for which there is a 200-fold separation between the EC50 and Kd at 37 degrees (EC50 = 10 nM, Kd = 2 microM). Experiments were designed to measure adenylate cyclase activation rates for a constant concentration of epinephrine-bound receptors but with variation of the absolute number of receptors involved in the activation. This was accomplished by blocking a portion of the receptor population with an antagonist (propranolol) that has a long occupancy half-life, while increasing the occupancy of the remaining receptors by compensating increases in epinephrine. With this protocol, a condition is approached in which receptor mobility alone is responsible for activation. This resulted in a 50% decrease in adenylate cyclase activity, compared with a control of 30 nM epinephrine. Thus, for epinephrine concentrations near the EC50, the switching of epinephrine among the receptor population is necessary for greater than 50% of the observed activity; it can be shown in conjunction that receptor mobility nonetheless accounts for the majority of the separation between the EC50 and the Kd.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "30": "We determined whether the beta-blockade disappearance rate would determine the degree of subsequent transient beta-adrenoceptor hyperresponsiveness after abrupt withdrawal of a beta-adrenoceptor drug. In a single-blind randomized study, 10 healthy men took a placebo for 1 week and then took nadolol one time a day (t1/2, 18 to 24 hours) or propranolol three times a day (t1/2, 4 to 6 hours) in doses that were increased weekly for 4 weeks to reach 240 mg per day. beta-Receptor responsiveness was assessed before and repeatedly after abrupt drug withdrawal by infusion of isoproterenol and epinephrine and by ergometer exercise. In the 13 days after drug discontinuation, peak beta-receptor sensitivity correlated (p less than 0.05) with the disappearance rate of beta-blockade as assessed by heart rate responses to isoproterenol (r = 0.68) and to submaximal exercise (r = 0.62) and by diastolic blood pressure responses to isoproterenol (r = 0.86) and epinephrine (r = 0.86). Plasma catecholamine levels and renin activity showed no overshoot. beta-Blockers with long plasma t1/2 values may prevent beta-blocker withdrawal syndromes by means of \"self-tapering.\"", 
    "31": "Following incubation with the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (ISO) and the alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), the number of beta-adrenergic receptors measured on human mononuclear leukocyte (MNL) membranes decreased. Pretreatment induced an approximately 40% loss of measurable receptors. The proportion of receptors lost was that which formed the ternary complex of agonist-receptor-Gs protein (H-R-Gs) and exhibited high affinity for agonists. In comparison studies, the loss of receptors was found to be similar to the proportion of receptors that form the high affinity state of the receptor (%RH) for agonist in agonist competition binding studies. Acute exposure to agonist induced a similar reduction in ISO/NEM \"sensitive\" receptors and the %RH. These experiments indicate that pretreatment of MNL membranes with ISO/NEM is a powerful tool with which to directly determine the percentage of receptors able to form an agonist high affinity state.", 
    "32": "To evaluate the short- and long-term effects of beta-adrenergic blockade (metoprolol) as well as the reaction to withdrawal and readministration of metoprolol in severe heart failure, 33 patients (25 men and eight women; mean age, 47.6 +/- 14.0 years) with dilated cardiomyopathy were studied by right and left heart catheterization, right ventricular biopsy, two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography, and external pulse recordings. Twenty-six of 33 patients survived more than 6 months, and 24 of the 26 patients improved their functional class (from mean 3.3 to 1.8, p less than 0.0001). These 24 patients were subjected to withdrawal of metoprolol until the number of symptoms increased and deterioration occurred as observed noninvasively (group 1, n = 16), whereas the eight patients did not deteriorate during a 12-month period (group 2). During long-term treatment with metoprolol, there was an increase in ejection fraction from 0.24 to 0.42 (p less than 0.0001), whereas there was a decrease in the left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic dimension (from 7.3 to 6.4 cm, p less than 0.0001), in the grade of mitral regurgitation (from 1.7 to 0.4, p less than 0.0001), and in the grade of tricuspid regurgitation (from 0.6 to 0.05, p less than 0.007). There was a decrease in pulmonary wedge pressure (from 23.8 to 10.7 mm Hg, p less than 0.0001), LV end-diastolic pressure (from 24.1 to 13.4 mm Hg, p less than 0.002), and systolic vascular resistance (from 1,782 to 1,499 dynes/sec/cm, p less than 0.04). There was an increase in systolic blood pressure (from 116 to 132 mm Hg, p less than 0.003), cardiac index (from 2.17 to 2.58 l/min/m2, p less than 0.005), and LV stroke work index (from 31 to 65 g.m/m2, p less than 0.0001). During withdrawal of metoprolol, the heart rate and left atrial dimension increased (p less than 0.0001), whereas ejection fraction decreased (p less than 0.0001). The 12 (of 16) patients in group 1 who survived the withdrawal period had metoprolol readministered, and subsequently, ejection fraction increased (from 0.23 to 0.33, p less than 0.002). Patients had a low number of ventricular beta-adrenergic receptors compared with healthy control subjects (30.3 +/- 2.9 vs. 97.4 +/- 8.7 fmol/mg protein, p less than 0.001), but long-term treatment with metoprolol caused a moderate up-regulation (from 30.3 +/- 2.9 to 49.0 +/- 7.1 fmol/mg protein, p less than 0.05), which may facilitate a more normal response to sympathetic stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "33": "The beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol stimulates immunoreactive atrial natriuretic peptide (IR-ANP) secretion by superfused rat atria in vitro. beta-Adrenergic agonists alter the cellular handling of calcium, which culminates in a rise in the systolic calcium concentration. This is achieved by increasing calcium influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels and by increasing the storage pool of calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). We therefore asked the question whether isoproterenol-stimulated IR-ANP secretion was dependent on the protein kinase A-induced rise in systolic calcium or was due to a direct effect of protein kinase A activation. Isolated rat left atria paced at 3 Hz were superfused in vitro. IR-ANP secretion was determined by radioimmunoassay of timed collections of the superfusate. Superfusion with 0.1 microM isoproterenol or 0.5 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP increased IR-ANP secretion twofold. Stimulated IR-ANP secretion was lowered to near baseline by lowering the buffer calcium concentration from 1.8 to 0.2 mM or by adding to the superfusate 10 microM nitrendipine (a calcium-channel blocker) or 1 microM ryanodine (an inhibitor of SR calcium release). Superfusion of nonbeating, electrically quiescent left atria with 0.1 microM isoproterenol failed to stimulate IR-ANP secretion. We conclude: 1) Isoproterenol-stimulated IR-ANP secretion is dependent on calcium influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels and on the release of calcium from the SR. 2) Enhanced calcium influx alone is not adequate to maintain isoproterenol-stimulated IR-ANP secretion. 3) The SR appears to be the primary source of calcium for isoproterenol-stimulated IR-ANP secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "34": "To demonstrate the presence of functional cardiac beta 2-adrenoceptors in man, we studied the responses to intracoronary injections of salbutamol in three groups of six patients. We injected salbutamol, a selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, into the right coronary artery to avoid peripheral vasodilator action and to stimulate the sinoatrial node directly. Salbutamol injections caused a sinus tachycardia. The same doses of salbutamol injected into the aortic root caused no change in heart rate, ruling out a systemic effect. The mean dose required to cause an increase in heart rate of 30 beats/min (IHR30) was 2.6 micrograms in the first group of six patients. In 12 other patients salbutamol was given after beta-blockade to confirm the beta 2-selectivity of the responses. Doses of practolol (beta 1-selective blockade) and of propranolol (beta 1- and beta 2-blockade) that had equal beta 1-blocking activity were used. In six patients who were given practolol, the mean IHR30 dose was 2.1 micrograms. In six patients who were given propranolol, the mean IHR30 dose was significantly greater at 64 micrograms (p less than 0.001, practolol vs. propranolol). This study demonstrates that direct cardiac beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation in man has a positive chronotropic effect.", 
    "35": "We have examined the catecholamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase in the retina of the white perch (Roccus americanus). Both dopamine and the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol stimulate cyclic AMP accumulation in this retina, but serotonin, an indoleamine, and phenylephrine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, had no effect. The stimulation of adenylate cyclase by isoproterenol is more potent and effective than that of dopamine. The effects of dopamine and isoproterenol are mediated via independent dopamine and beta-adrenergic receptors. Haloperidol, a dopamine antagonist, blocks the stimulatory effect of dopamine but not of isoproterenol. Conversely, propranolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, blocks the stimulatory effect of isoproterenol but not of dopamine. The effects of dopamine and isoproterenol are not additive. In fractions of purified horizontal cells we found evidence for dopamine receptors linked to adenylate cyclase but did not find evidence for the presence of cyclase coupled beta-adrenergic receptors. The cellular location of the beta-adrenergic receptors is unknown. Our findings demonstrate the existence of both beta-adrenergic and dopamine receptors coupled to adenylate cyclase in the white perch retina. However, we did not find either epinephrine or norepinephrine, endogenous ligands of the beta-receptor, to be present in retinal extracts subjected to HPLC.",

    "37": "Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone were consecutively measured during methimazole treatment in patients with hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease. ANP values of untreated hyperthyroid patients varied greatly from patient to patient, but decreased progressively with a decrease of serum thyroid hormone concentration during methimazole treatment. PRA was elevated in hyperthyroid patients but less aldosterone was secreted as evidenced by lower aldosterone/PRA ratio in these patients than in normal subjects and in hypertensive patients treated with thiazide. In addition, aldosterone/PRA ratio increased progressively with a decrease of ANP during methimazole treatment. The data indicated that ANP secretion was increased and ANP thus secreted depressed aldosterone secretion in hyperthyroid patients. Propranolol depressed pulse rate but failed to affect ANP secretion. It is suggested that thyroid hormone specifically acts on myocytes to stimulate ANP secretion but physiologic significance of such increased ANP secretion remains to be solved.",

    "39": "Treatment of rats with the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol results in cardiac hypertrophy, myocyte necrosis, and interstitial cell fibrosis. Our objectives in this study have been to examine whether hypertrophy and fibrosis occur in a compensatory and reparative response to myocyte loss or whether either process may be occurring independently of myocyte loss and thus be a reactive response to adrenergic hormone stimulation. We have examined this question by evaluating each of these responses in rats treated with different doses and forms of isoproterenol administration. Myocyte necrosis was evaluated using in vivo labeling with monoclonal antimyosin for identification of myocytes with permeable sarcolemma, which was indicative of irreversible injury. Myocardial fibrosis was evaluated by morphometric point counting of Gomori-stained tissue sections and by assessment of the stimulation of fibroblast proliferation by determination of increased levels of DNA synthesis. Stimulation of fibroblast DNA synthesis was determined from DNA specific radioactivities and radioautography after pulse labeling with [3H]thymidine. The evidence provided by this study suggests that the degree and timing of myocardial hypertrophy does not follow the course of myocyte loss and, thus, appears to be either a response to altered cardiac loading or a reactive response to beta-adrenergic hormone stimulation rather than a compensation for myocyte loss. Myocardial fibrosis, on the other hand, appears to be more closely related to myocyte necrosis with respect to collagen accumulation in the same areas of the heart, its dose-response relation to the amount of isoproterenol administered, and the timing of increased DNA synthesis, or fibroblast proliferation, after myocyte loss.", 
    "40": "We have compared the effectiveness of labetalol and nitroglycerin for the control of hemodynamic responses to laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in hypertensive patients. Twenty four patients with hypertension were randomly assigned to labetalol and nitroglycerin treatment groups, each consisting 12 patients. The labetalol group showed decrease of both systolic and diastolic pressure, minimum raise in heart rate (6.49%) and lowering of RPP (rate pressure product). Nitroglycerin group showed decrease of systolic pressure but diastolic pressure increased 5.76%, heart rate increased 32.27% and RPP increased 19.4%. The result showed that although both drugs blunted the hypertensive response to endotracheal intubation, intravenous labetalol seemed safer and more effective than nitroglycerin to attenuate the hypertensive response to laryngoscopy and intubation in hypertensive patients.", 
    "41": "Several manipulations that affect G protein/receptor coupling also alter the binding of [125I]iodocyanopindolol ([125I]ICYP) and [corrected] +/- cyanopindolol (+/- CYP) to rat brain 5-HT1B binding sites in radioligand binding assays. Inclusion of 5 mM MgSO4 in these assays results in a small but significant increase in the affinity of [125I]ICYP (from KD = 0.046 nM to KD = 0.037 nM). In contrast, 100 microM Gpp(NH)p, GTP, or GDP reduce [125I]ICYP affinity (KD = 0.056 nM with GTP) while ATP and GMP are less effective. +/- CYP affinity for 5-HT1B sites labeled by [3H]dihydroergotamine [( 3H]DE) also displays a small but significant reduction (from Ki = 1.4 nM to Ki = 3.5nM) by the inclusion of 100 microM GTP. Pre-treatment of the brain membranes with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) in concentrations known to inactivate many G proteins reduces 5-HT1B specific binding of [125I]ICYP. The NEM induced reduction in [125I]ICYP binding can be reversed by reconstitution with purified exogenous G proteins (Go and Gi), demonstrating directly that high affinity binding of [125I]ICYP to 5-HT1B sites is dependent on G proteins. The effects of Mg2+ ion, guanine nucleotides, NEM and G protein reconstitution on [125I]ICYP and +/- CYP binding are all hallmarks of agonist binding to G protein linked receptors. The effect of GTP, however, is quantitatively much less for the binding of these pindolol derivatives than for the binding of 5-HT, a presumed full agonist at 5-HT1B sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "42": "The controlled flux of calcium across the cell membrane is intimately linked to the release of insulin from pancreatic beta-cells, but the uncontrolled influx of calcium is a common final denominator of cell death. Because interleukin 1 has been shown to be cytotoxic to beta-cells in isolated rat islets of Langerhans and since interleukin 1 has a calcium ionophore effect on other cell types, this study was designed to test whether alterations of the calcium flux across the beta-cell membrane would influence the effects of interleukin 1 on isolated rat and mouse islets. Further, the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration was measured by the fura-2 method in rat islets during acute interleukin 1 exposure. Treatment with 10 mumol/l of verapamil (a potent blocker of the voltage-dependent calcium channel) tended to suppress the inhibitory effect of interleukin 1 on insulin release from rat islets, suggesting protection against cytotoxicity. Conversely, a stimulatory effect of interleukin 1 on mouse islets during 6 days of exposure to interleukin 1 was turned into inhibition by high extracellular calcium concentration. Interleukin 1 did not have any acute effect on cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration. In conclusion, interleukin 1 has no specific calcium ionophore effect on beta-cells, but alterations of the calcium flux across the beta-cell membrane influence the functional effects of interleukin 1, suggesting interference with cell function and toxicity, which would likely be accompanied by an uncontrolled influx of calcium.", 
    "43": "The mechanism of the blood pressure (BP)-lowering effect of neurotensin (NT) in the anesthetized, ganglion-blocked guinea pigs was further examined using animals in which the basal BP was artificially raised by an IV infusion of noradrenaline (NA) to overcome the BP-lowering effect of the anesthesia as well as of the ganglion blocker. The animals were also vagotomized and given atropine at the beginning of the experiments to prevent potential baroreceptor-mediated vagal reflexes and/or activation of muscarinic receptors by endogenous acetylcholine. Under these experimental conditions, the IV bolus injections of NT as well as of capsaicin (a reference drug) produced dose-dependent hypotensive effects and variable levels of tachycardia. Omitting the ganglion blocker from the animal drug regimen attenuated but did not abolish the BP-lowering effect of NT and of capsaicin. Neither the hypotensive nor the tachycardic effects of NT and of capsaicin in ganglion-blocked guinea pigs were affected by prior animal treatment with propranolol (a beta adrenoceptor blocker), antihistaminics (mepyramine, cimetidine) or indomethacin (a cyclooxygenase inhibitor). Morphine was found to slightly reduced the hypotensive effect of NT without altering its slight tachycardic effect. Both the hypotensive and tachycardic effects of NT and of capsaicin, in contrast to those elicited by substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), were inhibited in ganglion-blocked guinea pigs pretreated four days previously with capsaicin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Isoprenaline, epinephrine and the beta 2-selective clenbuterol cause a dose-dependent increase in alpha 2-APG serum concentration.

The duration of constriction was reduced after pretreatment by theophylline, 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine, bromo-cAMP, or bromo-cGMP, suggesting that the relaxation was related to an increase in cyclic nucleotide levels in the cell. Forskolin also reduced the duration of constriction, suggesting the involvement of cAMP. The duration of constriction was not affected by propranolol or isoprenaline, indicating no involvement of beta adrenoceptors. A scheme to explain these observations, in which alpha 1-adrenoceptor activation stimulates adenylate cyclase, leading to a rise in cAMP and an increased rate of intracellular calcium sequestration is proposed. The resulting fall in intracellular calcium leads to repolarization and relaxation.",

Multiple shocks of varying energies were applied through left and right ventricular epicardial patch electrodes to relate delivered energy to percent success in DF. The energies required for 50% success in DF (E) were estimated by logistic regression. DL or D sotalol was administered in a loading (4 mg/kg over 10 min) and maintenance (1.5 mg/kg/hr) infusion and the energy--success curve was again measured 30 minutes after drug administration. The effect of DL and D sotalol on E50 was compared to controls given saline. Both DL and D sotalol significantly lowered E50 by 16% +/- 14% (P less than 0.05) and 24.5% +/- 8.2% (P less than 0.05), respectively, in fentanyl anesthetized animals; this was accompanied by a 22% +/- 8% (P less than 0.05) and 16% +/- 5% (P less than 0.01) increase in ventricular effective refractory period (VERP), respectively. In pentobarbital anesthetized dogs, DL and D sotalol decreased E50 by 16% +/- 27% (P = ns) and 11% +/- 16% (P less than 0.05), respectively, and were associated with a 23% +/- 5% (P less than 0.01) and 12 +/- 4% (P less than 0.05) prolongation of VERP.

Initial standard 12-lead ECG revealed that her palpitation was caused by fascicular parasystole firing at the basic cycle length of 1.25-1.40 seconds, and that both sinus and parasystolic beats were associated with left anterior fascicular block and tachycardia-dependent RBBB. His-bundle electrocardiogram suggested that the parasystolic focus was located in the proximal portion of the anterior fascicle of the left bundle branch and that the site of tachycardia-dependent conduction block was located in the main right bundle branch. These findings suggest that diffuse pathological changes in the intraventricular conducting system were responsible for both the conduction block and automatic impulse formation in the present case.", 
    "49": "Dilevalol is a beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking drug derived from labetalol. Many beta blockers exert local anesthetic effects or alter repolarization in cardiac tissue. Because the cellular electrophysiologic effects of dilevalol have not been studied, we investigated the actions of dilevalol on canine cardiac tissues using standard microelectrode techniques. We also tested the beta-blocking actions of dilevalol in isolated Purkinje fibers. This was done by measuring the inhibition of the positive chronotropic response to 10(-6) M isoproterenol before and after treatment with the drug. Dilevalol at 10(-9) M produced slight beta blockade, whereas 10(-6) M produced maximal (approximately 90%) effects. In normal Purkinje fibers, dilevalol less than or equal to 10(-6) M did not change the dV/dtmax or action potential duration (APD). Dilevalol at 10(-5) M produced rate-dependent decreases of dV/dtmax, and decreased the plateau amplitude while prolonging total APD of the Purkinje fibers. In ventricular muscle cells, dilevalol greater than or equal to 10(-8) M increases APD, whereas less than or equal to 10(-5) M does not decrease dV/dtmax. Dilevalol less than or equal to 10(-6) M does not decrease automaticity in Purkinje fibers at either the high or the low level of membrane potential. In summary, dilevalol produces significant beta blockade in normal cardiac tissues. The dose-response curve for this action is comparable to that of propranolol. Dilevalol also prolongs APD in ventricular muscle cells. Dilevalol may reduce arrhythmias through either class II or class III effects.", 
    "50": "Isradipine (PN 200-110) is a new dihydropyridine calcium-entry blocker with powerful vasodilating properties. Therapeutic concentrations do not affect myocardial contractility. However, in vitro studies have demonstrated at higher concentrations negative chronotropic action with only minor dromotropic influence. For this reason we studied the effect of intravenous isradipine (0.3 microgram/kg/min during 30 min) on sinus node and atrioventricular (AV) nodal function in 25 patients. Nine of these patients had normal sinus node function (group I), nine patients were treated with a beta blocker (group II), and seven patients had a sick sinus syndrome (group III). Mean supine arterial blood pressure decreased in all groups; however, in group I not significantly. Spontaneous sinus cycle length decreased significantly in all groups. In none of the patients effective refractory periods of atrium or ventricle were depressed. QRS duration was not significantly affected in any of the groups. There was only a slight, but significant, prolongation of the QTc of maximal 4% (except in group III). We concluded that isradipine has no depressant effect on sinus and AV nodal function in humans, not even in the presence of beta blockade or impaired sinus node function.", 
    "51": "Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an essential component of the mitochondrial membrane and plays an important role in the maintenance of normal cardiac function. To evaluate the effects of ocular timolol on the cardiovascular system and determine the protective effect of CoQ10, 16 patients with glaucoma were studied using impedance cardiography. Following instillation of 1 mg timolol maleate in each eye, heart rate (HR) and stroke index (SI) decreased, and total peripheral resistance index (TPRI) increased significantly. Reexamination was performed after 6 weeks of 90 mg oral CoQ10. Despite decreases in HR, percent changes in HR were significantly less after CoQ10 at 120 min. Stroke index showed an initial increase which was not observed without CoQ10. These data suggest that CoQ10 delayed the appearance of inotropic blockade of timolol and hastened the disappearance of chronotropic blockade. Additional study of six normal volunteers with 6 weeks of oral CoQ10 showed a similar decrease of intraocular pressure after timolol instillation as compared to those without CoQ10. Thus, administration of oral CoQ10 in patients receiving ocular timolol may be useful in mitigating cardiovascular side effects without affecting intraocular pressure in the treatment of glaucoma.", 
    "52": "The effects of diprafenone, a new class Ic antiarrhythmic agent, on canine hemodynamics and cardiac membrane beta-receptor antagonist binding activity, were compared with those of propafenone and propranolol. Mongrel dogs (4-5/group) were anesthetized intravenously (i.v.) with pentobarbital sodium (35 mg/kg) and instrumented for measurement of aortic and coronary blood flows (AF, CBF), blood pressure (BP), and heart rate (HR). Isoproterenol (ISO) was administered as bolus injections before (0.01, 0.03, and 0.1 micrograms/kg, i.v.) and after (0.01-3 micrograms/kg, i.v.) infusions of diprafenone or propafenone (0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg) or propranolol (0.03, 0.1, and 0.3 mg/kg, i.v.). The ability of the antiarrhythmic agents to displace [3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) binding from isolated cardiac ventricular membranes in vitro was also evaluated. Each antiarrhythmic agent blocked the HR and BP responses to ISO in a competitive manner and decreased the specific binding of DHA to cardiac ventricular membranes. Propranolol was 2 to 7 times more potent as a beta-receptor blocking agent than diprafenone, which was 6 times more potent than propafenone. The equilibrium dissociation constants (Ki) for displacement of DHA by propranolol, diprafenone, and propafenone were 2.7, 14.3, and 252 nM, respectively, and have the same rank order of potency for in vivo inhibition of BP and HR responses to ISO. Diprafenone has significant beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity which may contribute to its efficacy as an antiarrhythmic agent and allow its use in treatment of arrhythmias refractory to therapy with class I and class II agents alone.", 
    "53": "To examine the role of adrenergic influences on genesis of ischemic and reperfusion arrhythmias, the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was cannulated and perfused by a shunt from the left carotid artery in 38 open-chest pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. Ischemia was produced by shunt occlusion and retrograde diversion of collateral flow from the LAD. The diverted blood was collected and returned to the animal by intravenous (i.v.) injection. The shunt was opened and the ischemic myocardium reperfused after 30 min of ischemia. Microsphere injections in six dogs during shunt occlusion and retrograde bleeding showed that blood flow to the ischemic zone was less than 1.5% of normal zone flow. The remaining 32 dogs were randomized into four treatment groups. Dogs (n = 8) were treated before shunt occlusion with either saline, nadolol (1 mg/kg), prazosin (0.2 mg/kg), or bilateral stellate transection. As compared with saline treatment, nadolol and stellate transection significantly reduced heart rate (HR), and prazosin significantly reduced mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) (p less than 0.05). However, none of the antiadrenergic interventions significantly reduced the number or frequency of ectopic beats during either the 1a or 1b phases of ischemia. None of the 32 dogs developed ventricular fibrillation (VF) during ischemia, but all dogs fibrillated within 30 s of reperfusion. The size of the ischemic zone ranged from 21 to 38% of the left ventricle, and there were no differences among the four treatment groups. The results suggest that when ischemia is severe, the adrenergic nervous system does not play a significant role in genesis of ischemic-induced ectopy or reperfusion-induced VF.", 
    "54": "This study assessed the cardiac electrophysiologic effects of DPI 201-106 (DPI), a novel orally absorbable positive inotropic agent, the administration of which has been associated with electrocardiographic (ECG) QT and T-wave changes. In the intact conscious dog, oral administration of both 8 and 16 mg/kg DPI produced marked sinus cycle length prolongation (8 mg/kg, + 11%; 16 mg/kg, + 9%) within 60 min of DPI administration (p less than 0.05 vs. baseline). DPI also tended to prolong right atrial refractory periods, and increase sinus node recovery time. In addition, DPI exhibited a negative dromotropic effect on the atrioventricular (AV) node, prolonging both AV node effective and functional refractory periods and tending to increase the minimum atrial paced cycle length at which AV conduction of 1:1 was maintained. DPI also significantly increased right ventricular effective refractory period (ERP) at both doses studied and increased ventricular functional refractory period (FRP) at the 16-mg/kg dose. Finally, although DPI administration was associated with QT interval prolongation, this effect was slight when corrected for sinus cycle length (SCL) (QTc, +3%). When administered concomitantly with propranolol and atropine or after surgical cardiac denervation, DPI-induced electrophysiologic changes were largely attenuated or abolished. Thus, findings in this study indicate that the apparent cardiac electrophysiologic effects of DPI are predominantly of neurally mediated origin in this animal model.", 
    "55": "Twenty-four patients with severe stable angina pectoris were included in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study to assess the efficacy of a controlled-release preparation of isosorbide-5-mononitrate (ISMN-CR) 60 mg once daily or twice daily as adjunctive treatment to a beta blocker. In bicycle ergometer exercise tests performed 4 h after study drug intake, total exercise time and time until 1-mm ST-depression increased significantly during both regimens as compared with placebo (p less than 0.05). However, only the 60-mg once-daily regimen was significantly better than placebo with regard to time until angina pectoris. The results indicate that ISMN-CR 60 mg once daily is effective as adjunctive to beta-blocker treatment, and nitrate tolerance appeared to develop during the twice-daily regimen. In 10 of the patients, the effect of additional sublingual nitroglycerin (NTG) was studied. Exercise time after NTG remained remarkably constant throughout all study periods. Exercise time was significantly prolonged after additional NTG and independent of the dose level of ISMN-CR. This indicates that cross-tolerance to NTG was not induced during sustained treatment with ISMN-CR.", 
    "56": "In order to monitor changes in cytosolic Ca2+ levels, brown-fat cells were incubated with the fluorescent Ca2+-indicator fura-2 and the fluorescence intensity ratio followed. The addition of norepinephrine led to a rapid and persistent increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ level, which was dose-dependent with a maximal effect at about 1 microM. The response was diminished in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and was inhibited more efficiently by phentolamine and prazosin than by propranolol or yohimbine, indicating alpha 1-adrenergic mediation. Accordingly, selective alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation also increased the cytosolic Ca2+ level. However, selective beta-adrenergic stimulation, as well as the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin, were also able to increase the cytosolic Ca2+ level in these cells to a certain extent. It was concluded that the major part of the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ was mediated, as in other cell types, via alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, but that Ca2+ levels were also positively modulated by a cAMP-mediated process. These observations are discussed in relation to known alpha 1/beta synergisms in brown adipose tissue.", 
    "57": "beta-Adrenoceptor binding sites were characterised and quantitated in post-mortem human brain with [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA) and [3H]CGP 12177. In cerebral cortex, isoprenaline and propranolol displaced both radioligands with uniform affinity. Practolol and CGP 20712A (selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonists) displaced with high affinity from a greater proportion of sites than ICI 118,551 and IPS 339 (selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonists). In cerebellum, propranolol displaced both radioligands with uniform affinity. ICI 118,551 displaced with high affinity from a greater proportion of sites than CGP 20712A. The density of total beta-adrenoceptors (defined with isoprenaline) and of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors (defined with CGP 20712A and ICI 118,551 respectively) was studied by saturation binding of both radioligands in 13 brain areas. beta-Adrenoceptor density was higher in caudate, putamen and nucleus accumbens (100-120 fmol/mg protein) than cortex (50-70 fmol/mg protein) and densities were lowest in hypothalamus and cerebellum (27-38 fmol/mg protein). The proportion of beta 1-adrenoceptors (as a % of total beta-adrenoceptors) was high in caudate (80%), putamen (80%) and cortex (60-70%) and lower in hippocampus (40%) and cerebellum (30%). Both radioligands labelled a very similar number of beta-adrenoceptors in all brain regions studied.", 
    "58": "Peptides corresponding to the known sequence of turkey erythrocyte beta 1-adrenergic receptor were synthesized and the effects on receptor-mediated cyclase activation were measured. Peptides corresponding to the first and second intracellular loops (T61-71 and T138-159) inhibited at micromolar concentrations the hormone-dependent cyclase activation in turkey erythrocyte membranes. In contrast, the peptide corresponding to the C-terminal part of the third intracellular loop (T284-295) increased the cyclase activity in a hormone-independent manner. Peptides T338-353 and T2-10 and a number of synthetic peptides unrelated to the beta-adrenoceptor had no effect.", 
    "59": "With the aid of the RIA method, the authors found that the stimulation of T-lymphocytes by means of PWM lectin is linked to the expressivity of HLA antigens of class II on their surface. A simultaneous addition of indomethacin, tetracycline, coreton, hydrocortisone and novozir was decreasing the expressivity of the Ia antigens and, at the same time inhibited the lymphocyte proliferation. The growth factor for T (IL-2) lymphocytes was increasing the expressivity of HLA-DR antigens in the cells even without a previous stimulation by mitogen. Glucan, serous thymic factor, natrium salicylicum, hippuric acid had no effect on the expressivity of the HLA antigens of class II.", 
    "60": "Quantitative methodology for the simultaneous high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) resolution and determination of the enantiomers of carvedilol, a new multiple-action antihypertensive agent exhibiting both vasodilator and beta-blocking activity, and its active metabolite, O-desmethylcarvedilol, in human plasma is described. The method involves reversed-phase solid-phase extraction of the analytes, followed by derivatization of the extract with the chiral reagent, 2,3,4,6,-tetra-O-acetyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl isothiocyanate and injection of the resultant diastereoisomers onto a reversed-phase HPLC column coupled to a fluorescence detector. Both pairs of diastereoisomers formed are completely resolved within 12 min (resolution for the respective pairs is 2.26 and 3.32) and the baseline is clean and free from extraneous peaks. The assay is linear over the range 0.6-80 ng/ml of human plasma with a lower limit of detection of approximately 100 pg on-column for each of the enantiomers. The method can be adapted for a number of structural analogues of carvedilol and is currently applied in support of preclinical and clinical studies of the drug.", 
    "61": "To examine the relationship between degree of treatment-induced blood pressure (BP) reduction and myocardial infarction, the experience of 1765 previously untreated, mild to moderate hypertensives (initial BP greater than or equal to 160 and/or greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg) in a systematic treatment program was reviewed. Over an average of 4.2 years, there were 39 morbid or fatal myocardial infarctions. Three types of fall in diastolic BP (final minus pretreatment) were defined: small (less than or equal to 6 mm Hg), moderate (7 to 17 mm Hg), and large (greater than or equal to 18 mm Hg). By Cox regression, an association was observed between myocardial infarctions and both a large and a small fall, relative to a moderate decline. Age and sex were independent risk factors. Body mass index, cholesterol level, electrocardiogram, race, prior cardiovascular disease, smoking status, initial and final revisit BP, total intreatment BP, and systolic BP were not. Since both a large and small reduction in diastolic BP were associated with a higher incidence of myocardial infarction (relative to a moderate fall), perhaps a moderate reduction in diastolic BP should be the goal of treatment for mild and moderate hypertensives.", 
    "62": "Several in vivo and in vitro studies have suggested that children suffering from cystic fibrosis (CF) might have a general defect of beta-adrenoceptors on the cell surface which might account for an unbalanced secretory process. In order to investigate if this view holds true, we determined the beta-adrenoceptor density and affinity on lymphocytes by means of radioligand studies using 125-iodo-cyano-pindolol (125-ICYP) in 20 children with CF. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) response was also investigated after specific beta-adrenoceptor stimulation with isoprenaline (IPN) and after direct stimulation of the adenylate cyclase with forskolin in lymphocytes. Children with CF and controls have identical numbers and affinities of beta-adrenoceptors on lymphocytes. The cyclic AMP response was identical in CF- and in age-matched control children regardless whether adenylate cyclase was stimulated directly or via beta-adrenoceptors. In conclusion, the data support the view that no general adrenoceptor or adenylate cyclase defect exists in CF. As several studies have found abnormal reactions to adrenergic stimuli in CF patients, we presume that there is a defect beyond the level of adrenergic receptors and cAMP which remains to be identified.", 
    "63": "Control of high blood pressure has failed to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic coronary heart disease (CHD). Hypercholesterolemia, which is common among hypertensive patients, cigarette smoking, and hypertension are the major risk factors for CHD. To minimize CHD risk, elevated blood pressure and atherogenic lipid levels should be lowered, but various antihypertensive agents appear to adversely affect lipid levels, actually precluding the CHD risk reduction expected from blood pressure control. Doxazosin, a once-daily, long-acting, alpha 1-adrenergic inhibitor, not only is effective therapy for essential hypertension but also has a favorable impact on lipids. During controlled studies of doxazosin's antihypertensive efficacy, the following blood lipid levels were measured: total cholesterol, total triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (including HDL2 and HDL3), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apoproteins (apos) AI and B. Results showed total cholesterol (-0.8 to -8.9 percent), total triglycerides (-5.0 to -17.4 percent), and LDL (-9.0 to -16.9 percent) were reduced. The positive prognostic indicators, HDL (+0.7 to +13.0 percent) and HDL:total cholesterol ratio (+3.1 to +26.3 percent), were increased. Apo B decreased, but apo AI remained unchanged. In these hypertension studies, doxazosin has favorably reduced two major CHD risk factors. As part of a new, long-term, controlled, multicenter trial, the prospective benefits of these risk factor reductions on CHD morbidity and mortality will be quantified for doxazosin and other antihypertensive agents.", 
    "64": "The imidazole ring is a common structural feature of some xenobiotics that inhibit cytochrome P-450-catalysed reactions. Histamine is a 4-substituted imidazole and a preliminary study has shown it to be an inhibitor of rat liver microsomal drug oxidation. This work has now been extended. Histamine appears to be a competitive inhibitor of the alpha-hydroxylation (HM) (Ki = 164 microM; IC50 at 20 microM = 308 microM) and O-demethylation (ODM) (Ki = 243 microns; IC50 at 20 microM = 400 microM) of metoprolol in rat liver microsomes. Of the metabolites of histamine only N-acetylhistamine showed comparable inhibitory potency to that of the parent compound. Histamine impaired the disappearance of lignocaine when incubated with rat liver microsomes. This was accompanied by a corresponding inhibition of 3-hydroxy-lignocaine appearance. Histamine produced a type II spectral interaction with rat liver microsomes (lambda max = 432 nm, lambda min = 408 nm; Ks = 0.11 mM). When histamine was incubated alone with rat liver microsomes no loss of substrate was observed. The oxidation of metoprolol by human liver microsomes was impaired by histamine (IC50 values for ODM appearance at 25 microM: liver HL1 greater than 10, HL3 = 3.8 and HL4 = 3.7 mM). In comparison, cimetidine had an IC50 value of 1.5 mM using microsomes from liver HL3. Addition of histamine impaired the elimination of metoprolol by the isolated perfused rat liver in a dose-dependent manner (P less than 0.001, one-way analysis of variance). These data demonstrate that histamine can enter hepatocytes, interact with cytochrome P-450 and inhibit some drug oxidation reactions. The physiological relevance of inhibition of drug metabolism by histamine remains to be determined.", 
    "65": "The binding of propranolol enantiomers to human alpha 1-acid glycoprotein was studied using high performance liquid chromatography in order to provide insight into binding models and to describe individual binding parameters of both enantiomers. The binding of (-)-propranolol was shown to be saturable with one major binding site (n = 0.81, k = 2.73 x 10(5)/M). The saturation process achieved its upper asymptotic value at drug/protein molar ratio of approximately 1. In the case of the opposite (+)-enantiomer the binding isotherm did not show evidence of saturation even at higher drug/protein molar ratios (up to 50). The individual binding parameters for (+)-enantiomer were n = 0.38, k = 3.4 x 10(6)/M and n'k' = 1.39 x 10(4)/M for the saturable and nonsaturable binding component, respectively. At drug/protein molar ratio 2 the circular dichroism measurements confirmed the existence of different binding models for individual propranolol enantiomers.", 
    "66": "On the basis of echocardiographic investigations changes were analysed of certain haemodynamic parameters in 40 patients aged 21-50 years, mean 44 years, with primary arterial hypertension in stage II according to WHO classification. All patients were randomly chosen to receive for 6-9 weeks propranolol 120-480 mg daily, mean dose 280 mg, or pindolol 10-35 mg daily, mean dose 22 mg daily. The changes developing during the treatment with both drugs in relation to the initial values included the mean arterial blood pressure, the heart rate, the index of cardiac output and the systolic left-ventricular tension. In the studied patients treated with propranolol the heart rate and the ejection volume were decreased more than during pindolol treatment. Propranolol increased evidently the total peripheral vascular resistance and decreased the ejection fraction and the mean velocity of shortening of the circumferential fibres. Pindolol decreased slightly the peripheral vascular resistance and increased the ejection fraction and the mean velocity of shortening of the circumferential fibres. Pindolol, in relation to propranolol, had a more favourable effect on haemodynamics in patients with primary hypertension.", 
    "67": "Several side effects of drugs observed in an office of a general practitioner are described. The cause of these side effects, their prevention and their treatment are discussed.", 
    "68": "Pharmacophore mapping of the ligand binding domain of the beta-adrenergic receptor has revealed specific molecular interactions which are important for agonist and antagonist binding to the receptor. Previous site-directed mutagenesis experiments have demonstrated that the binding of amine agonists and antagonists to the receptor involves an interaction between the amine group of the ligand and the carboxylate side chain of Asp113 in the third hydrophobic domain of the receptor (Strader, C. D., Sigal, I. S., Candelore, M. R., Rands, E., Hill, W. S., and Dixon, R. A. F. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 10267-10271). We have now identified 2 serine residues, at positions 204 and 207 in the fifth hydrophobic domain of the beta-adrenergic receptor, which are critical for agonist binding and activation of the receptor. These serine residues are conserved with G-protein-coupled receptors which bind catecholamine agonists, but not with receptors whose endogenous ligands do not have the catechol moiety. Removal of the hydroxyl side chain from either Ser204 or Ser207 by substitution of the serine residue with an alanine attenuates the activity of catecholamine agonists at the receptor. The effects of these mutations on agonist activity are mimicked selectively by the removal of the catechol hydroxyl moieties from the aromatic ring of the agonist. The data suggest that the interaction of catecholamine agonists with the beta-adrenergic receptor involves two hydrogen bonds, one between the hydroxyl side chain of Ser204 and the meta-hydroxyl group of the ligand and a second between the hydroxyl side chain of Ser207 and the para-hydroxyl group of the ligand.", 
    "69": "The case reports of a total of 9,670 patients admitted to a medical department were reviewed manually. From this material, all patients receiving treatment with beta-blockers alone, bendroflumethiazide alone or combinations of these were selected. In addition, a control group was selected. The patients should have received treatment for at least seven days and they should not be \"ill\". Patients receiving treatment with beta-blockers had higher S-K+ (4.2 mmol/l) and lower standard bicarbonate levels (23 mmol/l) than matched controls. Patients receiving treatment with bendroflumethiazide had low S-K+ (3.6 mmol/l) and high standard bicarbonate (26 mmol/l). Patients receiving treatment with both bendroflumethiazide and beta-blocker had low S-K+ (3.4 mmol/l) and the same standard bicarbonate as patients who received bendroflumethiazide alone. A more limited group chosen according to stricter criteria confirmed the above mentioned results. The investigation demonstrated that treatment with both beta-blocker and bendroflumethiazide caused deterioration of the hypokalaemia induced by bendroflumethiazide despite the higher S-K+ during beta-blockade. This may be due to renal excretion of potassium during beta-blockade.", 
    "70": "Fetal (E15-16) somatosensory cortex (n = 15) or cerebellum (n = 9) were placed into the somatosensory cortex (SmI) of adult rat hosts to study the relative importance of tissue origin versus host milieu on graft beta-adrenoceptor regulation. Autoradiographic studies of [125I]pindolol ([125I]pin) binding in the presence of 3 microM serotonin were performed as an index of beta-receptor binding in both intact hosts and those with ipsilateral locus coeruleus (LC) lesions and/or ipsilateral superior cervical ganglionectomy. [125I]pin binding within fetal grafts was highly variable with areas of highest specific binding in cortical grafts (Kd = 209 +/- 30 pM, Bmax = 106 +/- 7 (fmol/mg protein) being comparable to host cortex (Kd = 211 +/- 41 pM, Bmax = 111 +/- 9 fmol/mg protein). Average total binding in whole cortical grafts was 73% and in cerebellar grafts was 60% of that in comparable adult cortex. Host cortex had 66-73% and cerebellum had 4-8% beta 1-receptors while cortical grafts had 59% and cerebellar grafts had 43% beta 1-receptors as determined by competitive binding with ICI 89406 and 118551. Noradrenergic fibers derived from both the host LC and superior cervical ganglion grew into fetal cortical grafts. Binding to high affinity uptake sites ([3H]desmethylimipramine, [3H]DMI) on noradrenergic terminals in cerebellar grafts was 28% higher than that in cortical grafts; superior cervical ganglionectomy decreased [3H]DMI binding in cortical grafts by 37% but had no effect on cerebellar grafts. Neither ganglionectomy nor LC lesions affected total specific binding or binding to beta-receptor subtypes in the grafts or host cortex 3-6 months after removal. Therefore, anatomic site of origin appeared to be the predominant factor in determining the development of beta-adrenoceptors in fetal cortical tissue. In ectopically placed cerebellar grafts, beta-receptor subtypes did not develop comparably to host cerebellar receptors suggesting that host milieu may be of critical importance in receptor development in this tissue.", 
    "71": "The membrane bound acetylcholine receptor from Torpedo marmorata was photolabeled by the noncompetitive channel blocker ]3H]chlorpromazine under equilibrium conditions in the presence of the agonist carbamoylcholine. The radioactivity incorporated into the AChR subunits was reduced by addition of phencyclidine, a specific ligand for the high-affinity side for noncompetitive blockers. The alpha-subunit was purified and digested with trypsin and/or CNBr and the resulting fragments fractionated by HPLC. Sequence analysis resulted in the identification of Ser-248 as a major residue labeled by [3H]chlorpromazine in a phencyclidine-sensitive manner. This residue is located in the hydrophobic and putative transmembrane segment M2 of the alpha-subunit, a region homologous to that containing the chlorpromazine-labeled Ser-262 in the delta-chain [1] and Ser-254 and Leu-257 in the beta-chain [2]. Extended sequence analysis of the hydrophobic segment M1 further showed that no labeling-occurred in this region.", 
    "72": "The role of postsynaptic adrenoceptors in the spontaneous activity of isolated bovine mesenteric lymphatic vessels was characterized. Low concentrations of noradrenaline (less than 10(-6) M) increased the amplitude and the frequency of the spontaneous contractions whereas high concentrations (less than 10(-6) M) depressed the activity. beta-Adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol enhanced the stimulation by noradrenaline and suppressed the inhibition. alpha 1-Blockade by prazosin or alpha 2-blockade by idazoxan antagonized the stimulation by noradrenaline and potentiated the inhibition. Activation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors by methoxamine, or of alpha 2-adrenoceptors by clonidine, stimulated lymphatic activity. The increases in the amplitude and frequency of the spontaneous contractions produced by each agonist were competitively antagonized by prazosin and idazoxan, respectively. Our results confirm the presence of postjunctional beta-, alpha 1-and alpha 2-adrenoceptors in lymphatic vessels and show that each of these receptors plays an important role in the adrenergic regulation of the spontaneous activity, with beta-adrenoceptors mediating inhibition, and alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors mediating stimulation.", 
    "73": "The effects of moderate concentrations of ethanol (8-34 mM) on the electromechanical activity of airway smooth muscle cells of canine trachealis, stimulated by the spasmogen tetraethylammonium (TEA), are described for in vitro and cultured reaggregate preparations. Ethanol produced a concentration-dependent hyperpolarization, and suppression of action potentials in smooth muscle preparations, in vitro, whereas it was without effect in cultured airway smooth muscle cells. In the presence of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (1 microM), ethanol had no effect on in vitro preparations. Isoproterenol (0.1 microM) produced hyperpolarization and suppression of action potentials in airway smooth muscle of both preparations. These effects were not observed when propranolol was additionally present. This suggests that both in vitro, and cultured airway smooth muscle preparations maintained their beta-receptors, and that ethanol caused the release of endogenous catecholamine from adrenergic nerve endings which apparently remained intact in in vitro, but not in cultured airway smooth muscle preparations.", 
    "74": "In a randomised cross-over study, six patients with recurrent sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) were treated with 3 regimens--amiodarone, amiodarone plus metoprolol, and amiodarone plus xamoterol. All patients had poor left ventricular function and were resistant to multiple drugs. Xamoterol (a partial beta-agonist) was more effective than metoprolol as adjuvant therapy to amiodarone in the control of recurrent sustained ventricular arrhythmias and was not associated with any clinical deterioration of ventricular function. Xamoterol was also more effective than metoprolol for suppression of VT at programmed stimulation and as effective as metoprolol for suppression of VT on exercise. Exercise tolerance was significantly greater during treatment with xamoterol/amiodarone than during treatment with metoprolol/amiodarone or with amiodarone alone.", 
    "75": "This lecture illustrates the early stages in the planning and discovery of propranolol, an adrenaline beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, and cimetidine, a histamine H2-receptor antagonist--the first examples of clinically useful drugs from each of these classes. The significance of selective agonists, partial agonists, and syntopic antagonists and the importance of the bioassay and the use of molar models in the drug discovery process are discussed. For the future, an outline of potential developments in hormone-receptor concepts is offered leading to the conclusion that progress may depend on improvements in bioassays and related molar modeling.", 
    "76": "In 10 male hypertensives without therapy who were active in sports echocardiographic examinations at rest, during and after a dynamic exercise were performed 1 hour after oral administration of 100 mg of propranolol and 6 weeks after a daily administration of 3 X 25 mg of propranolol. For comparison the results of 51 normotensive males of the same age were at disposal. The effects of propranolol in the acute experiment and under a permanent therapy are demonstrated at the parameters heart rate, systolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, end-diastolic volume index, stroke-volume index, ejection fraction, frequence-normed mean circumferential speed of shortening of fibres and peripheral resistance. In consequence of the effective decrease of blood pressure at rest and on exertion and lacking negatively inotropic effects on the contractility and pumping function at rest and on exertion during a permanent therapy the application of the beta-blockers in the antihypertensive therapy of bodily active hypertensives is to be recommended. From the behavior of the peripheral resistance under a vermanent therapy is concluded that a combination with a pasodilator is not necessary.",

The concentrations of propranolol (PPL) and its metabolites were monitored by h.p.l.c. in serum of rats during the first 6 h after administering single doses (20 mg/kg) of PPL either orally or intravaginally (i.vg). 2. The results showed that PPL was quickly transferred to the systemic circulation from the rat vagina and the serum concentration profile as substantially altered by the route of administration. Serum concentrations of free PPL were significantly higher in i.vg-dosed animals than their oral dosed counterparts. 3. Inter-animal serum conc. variations of PPL and its metabolites in the i.vg-dosed rats were smaller than those of the orally treated females. 4. In comparison with the i.vg-dosed rats, the levels of PPL metabolites (propranolol glycol, naphthoxylactic acid, naphthoxyacetic acid) were greater by the oral route, though these differences were not statistically significant. 5. The serum elimination half-lives (t1/2)beta of PPL and its metabolites during the beta-phase were not significantly different in the two treatment groups. 6. Following i.vg application, both the AUC and the Cmax values of PPL were significantly greater than those of orally dosed females, while no statistically significant differences were found in the tmax values. 7. Comparison of the AUC values showed that relative bioavailability of PPL was approx. 36 times greater in i.vg-treated animals than those of the orally dosed rats.", 
    "78": "An attempt was made to modify postoperative ileus in rats by using different drugs (propranolol, phentolamine, neostigmine and mepivacaine). The election of these drugs was based on their effect on the extrinsic innervation of the digestive tract. No statistically appreciable acceleration of the intestinal transit was found in any case, but we observed on radiography that the injection of mepivacaine accelerated gastric emptying.", 
    "79": "Polymeric films containing salicylic acid or propranolol HCl were prepared by casting and drying a drug-containing, aqueous colloidal polymer dispersion (Eudragit NE 30D) as an alternative to films cast from organic polymer solutions. The drug was either dissolved (salicylic acid) or dissolved/dispersed (propranolol HCl) in the polymeric matrix. Incompatibilities (flocculation or coagulation) between salts of basic drugs and two ethylcellulose latexes were overcome by substituting the anionic surfactants with a nonionic surfactant (Pluronic P103). The drug release was studied as a function of drug loading, film thickness, amount of hydrophilic additive (hydroxypropyl methylcellulose), and storage humidity. The release of propranolol HCl (monolithic dispersion) was a combination of diffusion through the polymer and pores or channels; the extent of each release mechanism depended on the drug loading. On DSC thermograms, melting transitions were obtained with monolithic dispersions but not with monolithic solutions. The heat of fusion was linearly correlated to the amount of drug in the films. The amount of drug remaining in the film after the dissolution study was not detectable and corresponded to the drug dissolved in the polymer. The drug release increased with increased drug loading and increased amount of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose but was independent of film thickness and relatively insensitive to different storage humidities.", 
    "80": "We have examined the effects of ageing on the physiological function of the neuronal noradrenaline uptake system by comparing responses to cocaine in young adult (5 month) and aged (22 month) male Sprague-Dawley rats. In rat atria pre-incubated with [3H]-noradrenaline, cocaine (3-30 mumol/l) significantly augmented the 2 Hz stimulation-evoked release of noradrenaline in tissues from young but not from old rats. Cocaine (1 mg/kg) produced a greater increase of the pressor response to noradrenaline in young than in old pithed rats. Cocaine significantly increased the tachycardia to noradrenaline only in young pithed rats, but in old pithed rats the duration of the response to noradrenaline was significantly increased. It is concluded that ageing in the rat is associated with a decreased function of the neuronal noradrenaline uptake system, at least in the cardiovascular system.", 
    "81": "The effects of ketanserin on blood pressure and well-being were investigated in 188 patients, aged 41-82 years, with mild to moderate essential hypertension. At entry, 107 were untreated, 42 were taking the diuretic combination hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg/day) plus amiloride (5 mg/day) and another 39 were taking the beta-blocker atenolol (100 mg/day). A single-blind, 4-week placebo run-in period was followed by 12 weeks' oral ketanserin treatment at 20 or 40 mg twice a day. This regimen significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressures in each group. Response rates were greater in patients aged over 60 years. Compared with placebo, sleep disturbances, daytime fatigue and overall weakness decreased during ketanserin treatment (P less than 0.05 for all), but the incidence of dry mouth and stuffy nose increased. In patients older than 60 years there was a greater reduction of complaints than in younger patients. Ketanserin proved effective and well tolerated, improving peripheral circulatory symptomatology, particularly in older patients and those with a good blood pressure response.", 
    "82": "The effect of nicardipine hydrochloride, a calcium-channel blocking agent, was studied in 46 patients with stable angina in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, repeated cross-over protocol, using a 30 or 40 mg dose of nicardipine or placebo three times a day. Mean resting heart rate and blood pressure did not change significantly with 30 mg nicardipine; heart rate increased from 81 +/- 10 to 88 +/- 13 beats min-1, systolic blood pressure decreased from 129 +/- 18 to 119 +/- 16 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure from 81 +/- 12 to 74 +/- 11 mmHg (P less than 0.01 for all three variables) with a 40 mg dose. Using a treadmill exercise protocol, mean exercise duration increased from 5.4 +/- 1.8 to 6.0 +/- 1.8 min (P less than 0.01) with 30 mg nicardipine, and from 5.8 +/- 1.7 to 6.6 +/- 1.9 min (P less than 0.01) with 40 mg. Time to onset of angina increased from 4.6 +/- 1.9 to 5.2 +/- 1.7 min (P less than 0.05) with 30 mg and from 5.1 +/- 1.8 to 5.7 +/- 1.8 min (P = NS) with 40 mg. Mean anginal frequency and sublingual nitroglycerin consumption were low during the cross-over placebo period and did not change significantly during therapy with nicardipine. Non-cardiac side-effects were mild and required the withdrawal of only one patient from the study. However, during nicardipine therapy four patients had unstable angina and two developed a non-Q wave myocardial infarction. Of these patients, five were receiving a beta-adrenergic blocker that was discontinued prior to the study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "83": "CGRP-immunoreactive nerve fibers were histologically stained in the endocardium and perivascular layer of coronary vessels of canine hearts. To examine the physiological role of the CGRP in the heart function, effects of exogeneous CGRP on the hearts were studied using canine isolated, blood-perfused heart preparations. CGRP exerted dose-related potent vasodilator effects with a minimal increase in the developed tension of the papillary muscle, but slightly decreased the sinoatrial rate. The vasodilator effects were unaffected by the pretreatment of either atropine or propranolol. These specific functional effects on the coronary artery are well in accordance with the anatomical localization of CGRP. Taken together, CGRP seems to play an important role in the regulation of coronary vascular tone, while it has only a small functional role in inotropism and chronotropism in canine hearts.", 
    "84": "The action of isoprenaline, a purely beta-agonist, was investigated on frog atrial fibres under voltage clamp conditions; tonic tension was induced by long depolarizing pulses and the outward delayed current simultaneously developed. The cumulative dose-response curves showed that isoprenaline increased the peak of tonic tension in the concentration range 10(-8) to 3. 10(-6) mol.l-1, with a maximum effect for 10(-6) mol.l-1. The positive inotropic action of isoprenaline was associated with an increase in the rates of tension rise and of relaxation. Isoprenaline also increased the amplitude of the outward delayed current in a dose-dependent manner. The effects of isoprenaline (10(-6) mol.l-1) on tonic tension and outward delayed current were not observed in the presence of propranolol (10(-7) mol.l-1). Experiments carried out in low-sodium solution demonstrated that the action of isoprenaline on tonic tension can be explained by activation of Na-Ca exchange; the enhanced relaxation might result from the same process. These results suggested that the positive inotropic action of isoprenaline is mediated not only by the well-known increase in the slow inward current but also by activation of the Na-Ca exchange mechanism.", 
    "85": "Whether or not the suppressive effect of alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockers, phentolamine and propranolol, on the development of tolerance to morphine could be substituted for each other was investigated in mice. Daily co-administration of either one of the blockers with morphine suppressed the development of analgesic tolerance to morphine as far as the treatment was continued without affecting the analgesic effect per se; however, the suppressive effect was lost from the day of the substitution for the other blocker and tolerance developed as rapidly as in the control group treated with morphine alone. Co-administration of both blockers with morphine also maintained the analgesic effect on the 1st day for 10 days, but when the administration of either one or both blockers was eliminated from the 6th day, the development of tolerance was initiated. These results suggest that the mechanisms of alpha- and beta-blockers for the suppression of the development of analgesic tolerance to morphine are different from each other and that adrenergic blockers may produce a specific alteration in the mechanism for the development of tolerance to morphine.", 
    "86": "We investigated whether the effect of nisoldipine on liver blood flow depends on its route of administration. Ten healthy subjects took nisoldipine I.V. (infusion) and orally (without and with sotalol pretreatment). Pharmacokinetics of nisoldipine was assessed and liver blood flow (ICG clearance) was measured before dosing and at the end of the infusion or during absorption. During I.V. infusion the ICG plasma clearance increased by only 14%, whereas the increase was 60% during absorption of nisoldipine. Nisoldipine increases liver blood flow considerably only during the absorption phase. A positive correlation was found between the increase in liver blood flow during absorption and the systemic availability of nisoldipine, suggesting that the differences in liver blood flow response to nisoldipine substantially contribute to the variability in pharmacokinetics of the drug.", 
    "87": "The purpose of this study was to determine if propranolol (0.5 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg), administered intravenously (IV) at the height of the postburn hypermetabolic response, would decrease myocardial oxygen requirements, without adversely affecting overall oxygen delivery or total body oxygen consumption. To test this hypothesis, six nonseptic patients age 17 +/- 3 years with burns over 82% +/- 11% total body surface area were given propranolol with continuous hemodynamic monitoring. Propranolol was administered to these patients 20 +/- 15 days postburn. Two clinically derived indices of myocardial oxygen consumption, pressure-work index (PWI) and rate-pressure product (RPP), were used to estimate the energy expenditure of the working heart. Both PWI and RPP were significantly decreased from baseline after 0.5 mg/kg propranolol, 31% for PWI (P less than .001) and 30% for RPP (P less than .01). Similarly, a decrease from baseline was seen after 1.0 mg/kg propranolol, 32% for PWI (P less than .001) and 35% for RPP (P less than .01). Cardiac index (L/min/m2) demonstrated no significant change [7.4 +/- 1.1 (prepropranolol), 6.5 +/- 1.3 (after 0.5 mg/kg propranolol), and 6.8 +/- 1.0 (after 1.0 mg/kg propranolol)] and exceeded the upper limits of normal (hyperdynamic state) throughout the study. Oxygen delivery index (962 +/- 209 mL/min/m2) and oxygen consumption indices [(254 +/- 78 mL/min/m2 by Fick method and 236 +/- 78 mL/min/m2 by inspired and expired gases)] were elevated at baseline and unaffected by propranolol. The decrease in PWI and RPP was achieved mainly by propranolol's effect to lower both heart rate and BP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "88": "Propranolol, a non-selective beta blocker, was administered orally in therapeutic doses. The effects of a single dose (160 mg) and one week's treatment (80 mg twice a day) on platelet function were compared in healthy young subjects. There were no significant changes in circulating platelet aggregates, template bleeding time, platelet factor 3 availability and thromboxane beta 2 (TX beta 2) generation. Platelet aggregation responses as assessed by angle of slope and maximal percentage aggregation (all agonists) and lag phase (collagen) showed no changes of biological importance, although minor changes reaching significance were observed with some agonists. These findings suggest that propranolol does not significantly affect platelet function when taken at doses commonly encountered in clinical practice.", 
    "89": "1. Isolated rings of rat proximal urethra contracted in response to acetylcholine, noradrenaline, phenylephrine, tachykinins or field stimulation. In the presence of field stimulation-induced contractions, isoprenaline or CGRP produced an inhibitory effect on evoked contractions. 2. Electrical field stimulation produced frequency-related contractions which, when using trains of stimuli, consisted of a phasic and a tonic response. These contractions were abolished by tetrodotoxin (1 microM) but unaffected by hexamethonium (10 microM). 3. Atropine (3 microM) produced a partial inhibition of these nerve-mediated contractions, slightly more evident on the tonic than the phasic response. In the presence of atropine (3 microM), phentolamine (3 microM) or prazosin (1-10 nM) produced an almost complete inhibition of the response to field stimulation. 4. After bilateral removal of the pelvic ganglia, electrical field stimulation was still able to induce tetrodotoxin-sensitive contractions of the rat proximal urethra. However, the inhibitory effect of atropine was much reduced as compared to controls, while the phentolamine-sensitive portion of the response was increased. 5. DMPP (0.1 mM) a nicotinic receptor agonist, produced a contraction (phasic and tonic components) which was strongly inhibited by hexamethonium (10 microM), abolished by prazosin (1 microM) and reduced by tetrodotoxin (3 microM). 6. In urethral rings from diabetic rats (i.v. streptozotocin 7-9 weeks before) the contractile response to acetylcholine or noradrenaline as well as the response to field stimulation were unchanged as compared to controls. 7. Capsaicin (1 microM) produced an inhibitory effect on the nerve-mediated contractions of the rat proximal urethra. This response was abolished by pelvic ganglionectomy but was unaffected in streptozotocin-treated rats. 8. These findings provide functional evidence that both cholinergic and noradrenergic nerves mediate the contractions of the rat proximal urethra. In addition, capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves can produce certain local motor responses through release of endogenous neuropeptides. In vivo studies are needed to examine the interplay between these differents sets of motor nerves in the regulation of proximal urethra motility.", 
    "90": "In an attempt to define the metabolic abnormalities of the ischemic myocardium, the changes in high energy phosphates, inorganic phosphate and intracellular pH were serially and quantitatively evaluated in ischemic porcine hearts having no collateral circulation, using arterial pressure and respiration gated in vivo 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The protocol was also modified for propranolol pretreatment (0.6 mg/kg intravenously) to define its effect on the metabolism of ischemic myocardium. In the non-treated group, creatine phosphate was rapidly depleted by 10 minutes after ischemia; by 40 minutes, ATP and intracellular pH gradually decreased to 10 +/- 11% of control and to 5.90 +/- 0.26, respectively, and inorganic phosphate rose to 303 +/- 43% of control. In the propranolol treated group, the concentrations of creatine phosphate and ATP were higher, and those of inorganic phosphate and tissue pH were similar compared with controls during 40 minutes of ischemia. This suggests that the beneficial effect of propranolol on the ischemic myocardium is due to the preservation of ATP, an essential energy resource for numerous enzymatic reactions in viable myocardium.", 
    "91": "The ultrastructural effects of long-term propranolol administration on the catecholamine-containing (CC) cells of cervical sympathetic ganglia were studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats. After 2 months of propranolol administration, there were hydrops of mitochondria, together with swelling and vesiculation of Golgi complex and rough endoplasmic reticulum. Such swollen organelles seemed to coalesce with each other, resulting in transformation of major parts of the cytoplasm into large membrane bound saccules. In that group of animals, the number of CC vesicles showed a significant decrease (P less than 0.025) compared to the control. Moreover, such vesicles looked more electron dense, with decreased electron-lucent haloes compared to the control. Blood pressure recording via rat tail cuff showed a significant drop (P less than 0.0001) of the mean systolic blood pressure in the treated animals. One month after stopping propranolol administration, resorption of the cytoplasmic saccules occurred, but the cytoplasm looked lighter and lost its granular appearance. The mitochondria regained their normal shape, though they appeared fewer in number. The CC vesicles were significantly reduced in number (P less than 0.001) and were less electron dense compared to the control. The possible implications of these findings on the mechanism of action of propranolol as an antihypertensive agent are discussed.", 
    "92": "The sympathetic nervous system has been implicated in the regulation of glucose-induced thermogenesis in man. The present study was undertaken to examine the influence of a pharmacological beta blockade on the thermogenic response after ingestion of a mixed meal. Ten healthy male volunteers were examined on two occasions, once during intravenous administration of beta-blocking agent (Series 1) and once without (Series 2). Five subjects received propranolol and the other five atenolol. Two subjects were also studied on a third occasion after 1 week of other propranolol medication (Series 3). Continuous respiratory gas exchange measurements were carried out for 1 h in the basal state and then for 3 h postprandially. The subjects ingested a standardized test meal in liquid form. After the meal oxygen uptake and energy expenditure both rose markedly during the first hour and then reached a relatively stable plateau. The average increase in oxygen uptake above basal during the whole study period was 27.0 +/- 1.4 vs. 26.7 +/- 1.4% (NS) in Series 1 and 2, respectively. The corresponding values for energy expenditure were 28.6 +/- 1.4 vs. 28.6 +/- 1.6%. Also in absolute terms, the increments above basal did not differ between the two series. Moreover, the basal measurements and the response to the meal were no different in the subjects in Series 1 receiving the selective beta-1 antagonist and the non-selective blocker, respectively. In conclusion, the present findings indicate that in healthy man, beta-adrenergically mediated sympathetic nervous system activity does not significantly influence the magnitude of the thermogenic response to a mixed meal.", 
    "93": "Control of cardiovascular function during time-dependent pooling of blood in the upper and lower body was studied in intact dogs (n = 5) and in dogs in which hearts had been surgically denervated (n = 5). The animal was positioned horizontally on a platform mounted on the arm of a centrifuge; rotation of the platform at one of nine rates with a period ranging from 3.3 min to 4 s exposed the subject to a sinusoidally varying force (+/- 2 g) that periodically translocated blood from the chest to the lower quarters and back again. The resulting oscillatory changes in arterial blood pressure (BP), cardiac output, stroke volume, heart rate (HR), and peripheral resistance (PR) were analyzed using a fast Fourier transform. Normal dogs were superior to cardiac-denervated dogs in minimizing arterial BP fluctuations, especially in the midfrequency range (i.e., approximately 0.032 Hz); after pharmacological alpha-, beta-, and muscarinic-receptor blockade, the BP oscillations were similar in the two groups. The unblocked denervated dogs regulated BP poorly primarily because of their inability to 1) make appropriately timed changes in HR and 2) minimize inappropriate oscillations in SV. Both groups of dogs in the unblocked state showed large appropriately timed PR fluctuations at the lower frequencies, which minimized BP oscillations; these became less optimally timed as acceleration frequency increased, thereby potentiating the natural disposition for BP to oscillate at the acceleration frequency. Afferent information from cardiac receptors did not appear to be essential for controlling this aspect of vascular function.", 
    "94": "Segments of thoracic aorta (DTA), tail artery (TA), and mesenteric artery branches (MAB) were obtained from male Fischer 344 rats at ages of 1, 2, 6, 12, 24, and 30 mo and were used to determine the effects of aging on agonist-activated 86Rb (and 42K) efflux. At all three arterial sites, basal efflux decreased during development (1-6 mo), but no further changes were observed with aging (6-30 mo). The initial efflux response to 10 microM norepinephrine (NE) in the presence of 1 microM propranolol exhibited either no change (DTA) or an increase (TA and MAB) during development (1-6 mo), but all three sites showed a large decrease during aging (6-30 mo). Changes in the steady-state response to NE paralleled changes in the basal efflux at all ages and arterial sites. The initial efflux response to 75 mM K+-physiological salt solution (PSS) for the DTA in the presence of 1 microM phentolamine and 1 microM propranolol decreased during development followed by an increase during aging, whereas for the TA and MAB, there were no significant changes with age. The steady-state efflux response to K+ decreased during development at all three sites but was increased only for the DTA during aging. The steady-state efflux response to K+ was not altered for the TA and MAB during aging. Efflux responses using 42K were qualitatively similar, but rate constants were quantitatively larger than those with 86Rb at all three arterial sites and at all ages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
