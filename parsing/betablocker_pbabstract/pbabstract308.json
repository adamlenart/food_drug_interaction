    "0": "The appropriate management of persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI) still remains controversial. Some patients show a response to treatment with diazoxide or somatostatin, but a number of children require total or near-total pancreatectomy to control hyperinsulinism. Recent studies suggest a dysfunction in the adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel present in the plasma membrane of pancreatic beta-cells in PHHI. The closure of these channels initiating the depolarization of the beta-cell membrane and opening of calcium channels results in an increase in intracellular calcium which triggers insulin secretion. A calcium channel blocking agent has been shown to block this process and decrease insulin secretion of the nesidioblastotic beta-cells in vitro and to control the hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of the patient in vivo. To examine the efficacy of calcium channel blocker therapy, three patients with PHHI were treated with nifedipine. PHHI was diagnosed by inappropriately high insulin levels for low blood glucose levels at 8-10 days of age. Normoglycemia was maintained by a high dose of glucose infusion at a rate of 14-16 mg/kg/min. Therapy using diazoxide and/or somatostatin analogue failed to restore euglycemia in these three patients. The first patient underwent near-total pancreatectomy; however, hyperinsulinism recurred 30 days after surgery. All patients were started on short acting nifedipine at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day per os in four doses. To maintain blood glucose levels in normal ranges, the dose of nifedipine was progressively increased to 0.7-0.8 mg/kg/day. Glucose infusion rate to restore euglycemia decreased and was discontinued on the 4th to 10th day of nifedipine treatment. The patients, who have now been followed on nifedipine therapy for over 12 months, are normoglycemic with normal insulin levels. The growth and neuromotor development of the patients are unremarkable except for mild developmental delay of the patient who underwent near-total pancreatectomy. No side effects were encountered at the doses used. In conclusion, calcium channel blocking agents can be used with efficacy and safety in PHHI to control the hyperinsulinemia.", 
    "1": "Despite the availability of many newer antihypertensive agents, hypertensive patients remain at a higher risk of premature death than the general population. This persistence of elevated morbidity and mortality may be accounted for by the frequent failure to achieve adequate blood pressure reduction despite an extensive range of available antihypertensive agents. Such considerations have led to the reassessment of the potential role of fixed-dose combination agents. The antihypertensive efficacy may be enhanced when two classes of agents are combined. In addition, combination therapy enhances tolerability because one drug of fixed combination can antagonize some of the adverse effects of the second drug. Fixed-dose combination therapy simplifies the treatment regimen, preventing treatment failures that might result from missed doses.", 
    "2": "Blood pressure, as well as other biological parameters, shows a circadian rhythm with a morning increase following the nocturnal blood pressure fall. In a parallel way, and probably related, there is a characteristic morning concentration of cardiovascular events. The antihypertensive treatment should pursue normotension during the 24 hours of the day, by restrictive the morning blood pressure increase. Drug efficacy can be improved depending on the time of the day of drug dose. Chronotherapeutical effects of different drugs in blood pressure are discussed.", 
    "3": "Arterial hypertension is a cardinal precursor of congestive heart failure, and diastolic dysfunction is the most frequent mechanism for it. Systolic left ventricular dysfunction, although less frequent, has a worse prognosis. Most cases of systolic dysfunction in patients with hypertension is due to acute myocardial infarction, although other mechanisms can be involved. In some studies, non-ischemic hypertensive systolic dysfunction is the etiology of chronic heart failure in up to 10% of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Diastolic dysfunction and left ventricular hypertrophy are also associated with a higher risk of heart failure and systolic dysfunction. Given the poor prognosis of patients with congestive heart failure and dilated cardiomyopathy, it is fundamental to try to prevent the development of left ventricular dysfunction by means of a correct control of blood pressure, regression of left ventricular hypertrophy and prevention of coronary artery disease. When systolic dysfunction is established, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are the treatment of choice; diuretics and digoxin can be added in patients with overt congestive heart failure. Recent studies suggest that other drugs, such as carvedilol and losartan, can be beneficial, but current evidence is still scarce.", 
    "4": "Bacterial translocation appears to be an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of spontaneous infections in cirrhosis. Cirrhotic patients are commonly treated with beta-adrenoceptor blockers, but the impact of this treatment in the factors promoting bacterial translocation has not been investigated. This study was aimed at investigating in cirrhotic rats with ascites the effect of propranolol on intestinal bacterial load, transit, and permeability of the bowel and on the rate of bacterial translocation. Bacterial translocation to mesenteric lymph nodes and intestinal bacterial overgrowth, permeability (urinary excretion of (99m)Tc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid [(99m)Tc-DTPA]), and transit (geometric center ratio of (51)Cr) were assessed in 29 rats with carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) cirrhosis and 20 controls. These variables were then measured in 12 placebo- and in 13 propranolol-treated ascitic cirrhotic rats. Bacterial translocation was present in 48% of the cirrhotic rats and in none of the controls. Cirrhotic rats with intestinal bacterial overgrowth had a significantly higher rate of translocation and slower intestinal transit than those without it. Among the 15 rats with overgrowth and a (99m)Tc-DTPA excretion greater than 10%, 15 had translocation and 2 had bacterial peritonitis. Only 1 of the 14 rats with either intestinal overgrowth or a (99m)Tc-DTPA excretion greater than 10% presented translocation. Compared with the placebo group, propranolol-treated animals had significantly lower portal pressure, faster intestinal transit, and lower rates of bacterial overgrowth and translocation. In ascitic cirrhotic rats, bacterial translocation results from intestinal overgrowth and severe damage to gut permeability. In this setting, intestinal overgrowth is associated with intestinal hypomotility. Propranolol accelerates the intestinal transit, decreasing the rates of bacterial overgrowth and translocation.", 
    "5": "To determine whether there are gender-specific differences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of metoprolol enantiomers.", 
    "6": "Twenty normal volunteers (10 men and 10 women) received 100 mg oral metoprolol tartrate twice daily for a total of nine doses. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were studied after the last dose. Subjects also completed a control pharmacodynamic study; the order of drug and control studies was randomized. Measurements of heart rate and systolic blood pressure were obtained during peak submaximal bicycle exercise testing. (R)-Metoprolol and (S)-metoprolol concentrations were determined by stereospecific HPLC. The percentage difference in exercise heart rate and systolic blood pressure (metoprolol versus control), and (R)- and (S)-metoprolol plasma concentrations were comodeled.", 
    "7": "Men and women showed stereoselective pharmacokinetics; (S)-metoprolol concentrations were significantly greater than those for (R)-metoprolol for both groups. Women had greater drug exposure than men (higher maximum concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve). No differences were observed between genders with respect to elimination half-life. Females had a greater reduction in exercise heart rate and systolic blood pressure; however, the area under the effect curve was significantly greater for heart rate only. Pharmacodynamic data were best fitted by the Hill equation with the effect site in the central compartment. The fitted maximum effect and the concentration at one-half of the maximum effect for heart rate and systolic blood pressure did not differ between men and women (P > .20).", 
    "8": "Gender-related differences exist in the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol enantiomers, resulting in greater drug exposure in female subjects. However, concentration-effect relationships did not differ between men and women. Therefore the observed differences in drug effects were the result of gender-specific differences in metoprolol pharmacokinetics.", 
    "9": "The mouse \"Purkinje cell degeneration\" (pcd) is characterized by a primary loss of Purkinje cells, as well as by retrograde and secondary partial degeneration of cerebellar granule cells and inferior olivary neurons; this neurological mutant can be considered as an animal model of human degenerative ataxia. To determine the consequences of this cerebellar pathology on the noradrenergic system, noradrenaline transporters as well as alpha1-, alpha2- and beta-adrenergic receptors were evaluated by quantitative ligand binding autoradiography in adult control and pcd mice using, respectively, [3H]nisoxetine, [3H]prazosin, [3H]idazoxan and [3H]CGP12177. In cerebellar cortex and deep nuclei of pcd mutants, [3H]nisoxetine labelling of noradrenaline transporters was higher than in control mice. However, when binding densities were corrected by surface area, they remained unchanged in the cerebellar cortex but associated with 25% and 40% lower levels of labelling of alpha1 and beta receptors, as well as a very important increase (275%) of alpha2 receptors. In deep cerebellar nuclei, surface corrections did not reveal any changes either in transporter or in receptor densities. Higher densities of [3H]nisoxetine labelling were found in several regions related with the cerebellum, namely inferior olive, inferior colliculus, vestibular, reticular, pontine, raphe and red nuclei, as well as in primary motor and sensory cerebral cortex; they may reflect an increased noradrenergic innervation related to motor adjustments for the cerebellar dysfunction. Increased [3H]nisoxetine labelling was also measured in vegetative brainstem regions and in dorsal hypothalamus, implying altered autonomic functions and possible compensation in pcd mutants. Other changes found in extracerebellar regions affected by the mutation, such as thalamus and the olfactory system implicated both noradrenaline transporters and adrenergic receptors. In contrast to the important alterations of the noradrenergic system in cerebellar cortex, the lack of receptor changes in deep cerebellar nuclei suggests that local adaptations may be sufficient to minimize the consequence of the cerebellar atrophy on motor control. An intense labelling by [3H]idazoxan of the inner third of the molecular layer was a novel, albeit unexplained finding, and could represent a postsynaptic subset of alpha2-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "10": "The rectum possesses electric activity in the form of pacesetter and action potentials. In a recent study we suggested that the waves are not initiated by the extra-rectal autonomic innervation but might be triggered by a \"rectosigmoid pacemaker.\" It was postulated that the electric signals are transmitted in the rectal wall through either the muscle bundles or enteric nerve plexus. This hypothesis was studied.", 
    "11": "Under anesthesia the abdomens of 15 dogs were opened, and three electrodes were applied to the rectal serosa. Rectal electric activity and pressure were recorded. Rectal denervation was produced by bilateral pelvic ganglionectomy. The effect of adrenergic (phentolamine and propranolol) and cholinergic (atropine sulfate) blocking agents and a smooth-muscle relaxant (drotaverine) on the electromechanical activity of the denervated rectum was evaluated.", 
    "12": "After pelvic ganglionectomy rectal pressure decreased (P<0.05), and pacesetter and action potentials exhibited irregular rhythm and amplitude, a condition of \"rectoarrhythmia.\" The arrhythmic pattern showed no significant change (P>0.05) on administration of the adrenergic and cholinergic blocking agents. However, it was abolished when drotaverine was given.", 
    "13": "Electric waves in the rectal wall seem to be transmitted through the muscle bundles and not the enteric nerve plexus, a finding that might assist in developing an appropriate pharmacotherapy for rectal dysmotilities and defecation disorders.", 
    "14": "The aim of this study was to compare the cardio-respiratory differences between rowing ergometry and treadmill exercise in beta-blocked men participating in exercise rehabilitation soon after myocardial infarction (postMI).", 
    "15": "Eleven males all receiving beta-blockade medication were measured for oxygen consumption (VO2), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) at individualized submaximal exercise target heart rates (THR) during 6 min of exercise on each of a motorized treadmill and a rowing ergometer 2-6 wk (4.9 +/- 1.4) postMI.", 
    "16": "The mean THR of the group, predetermined from an exercise ECG stress test, was 107 +/- 16 beats x min(-1). No significant difference was found between rowing versus treadmill VO2 (19.4 +/- 3.2 vs 19.7 +/- 4.2 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1); P = 0.53) or RPE (12.6 +/- 1 vs 12.7 +/- 1; P = 0.72). RER was significantly greater (P = 0.02) during rowing (0.99 +/- 0.07) compared with treadmill exercise (0.94 +/- 0.07).", 
    "17": "Exercising at a specified submaximal THR during rowing versus treadmill exercise in beta-blocked men participating in very early cardiac rehabilitation represents the same VO2 and RPE. A significantly greater RER was, however, apparent during rowing compared with treadmill exercise; thus, agreement was shown with previous studies on healthy individuals where rowing ergometry was less metabolically efficient than treadmill exercise. The results suggest that establishing a THR from a standard treadmill stress test soon after MI is not only suitable for walking/treadmill exercise but also in setting exercise intensity for rowing ergometry.", 
    "18": "Esmolol is a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist with a relatively specific affinity for beta 1 adrenergic receptors. Its mechanism of action is therefore largely cardioselective and only high doses block beta 2 adrenergic receptors. The pharmacologic features of the drug give it rapid onset of beta-blocking action (distribution half-life = 2 minutes) and a short duration of action due to rapid clearance (clearance half-life = 9 minutes). The rapid metabolism of esmolol allows its beta-blocking activity to be lowered rapidly by changing the rate of infusion and obtaining rapid reversibility of effect in the minutes following interruption of the infusion. The esmolol dose is therefore manageable and individual adjustments can be made in function of a patient's clinical status. Such properties mean that esmolol is indicated for short-term treatment of hypertension and tachycardia during the perioperative period and in clinical situations that require easy unblocking of beta receptors. Hypertension and bradycardia are the most frequent complications associated with the administration of esmolol, such that blood pressure, heart rate and electrocardiographic data must be monitored.", 
    "19": "Hyperkalaemia is a frequent electrolyte disturbance connected with new knowledge and practical routine. It is developed by the disorders of the \"external balance\" (potassium [K] intake and output) as well as the \"internal balance\" (distribution of K in the extracellular and intracellular fluid compartments). Factors playing a role in it are: the upright posture, physical activity and hyperosmolality. In the hormonal regulation of K metabolism first of all beta adrenergic agents, insulin and aldosterone have significance; the first two mainly in the internal balance. Hyperkalaemia is occurring especially frequently in renal patients (in acute and chronic renal insufficiency, in dialyzed persons) in patients with diabetes, in adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease, in selective hypoaldosteronisms and in pseudohypoaldosteronisms) in renal tubular acidosis as well as in response to various drugs (ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists, beta blocking agents, potassium sparing diuretics, NSAID's, anticoagulants etc.). Interactions between illness and drugs as well as between drugs and hormones may have outstanding importance in the development of hyperkalaemia. Physical activity carried out in the upright posture in the presence of hyperosmolality (water restriction together with salt or/and glucose loading) developing in pharmacological hypoaldosteronism accompanied with insulin deficiency, may be especially dangerous with respect to hyperkalaemia. To avoid life-threatening hyperkalaemia it is necessary 1. to stop cardiotoxicity with calcium; 2. to enhance K uptake by the cells by bicarbonate, insulin and beta adrenergic agents; and 3. to remove abnormal quantities of K from the body by enemas and/or ion exchange resins. The quickest and best way of treatment of hyperkalaemia is haemodialysis.", 
    "20": "The aim of the study was to assess the incidence and clinical implications of increased plasma angiotensin II despite chronic ACE inhibitor therapy in patients with heart failure.", 
    "21": "The studied population consisted of 70 patients (mean age 59+/-9 years). Plasma renin activity and plasma concentration of aldosterone, norepinephrine, atrial natriuretic peptide, angiotensin II, tumour necrosis factor, interleukin-6 and interleukin-1B were assessed at 6 months of ACE inhibitor therapy. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 24+/-5% and the end-systolic and end-diastolic diameters were 59+/-9 and 71+/-8 mm, respectively. Despite chronic enalapril or captopril therapy, 35 patients (50%) had increased plasma angiotensin II (median 33 pg. ml(-1), range 17-84), while it was in the normal range in the remaining 35 patients (median 10 pg. ml(-1), range 5-15). Plasma renin activity (P=0.005), interleukin-6 (P=0.004), New York Heart Association functional class III-IV (P=0. 006), furosemide dose (P=0.01), lack of beta-blocker therapy (P=0. 04) and norepinephrine (P=0.04) were univariately associated with increased angiotensin II. Multivariate regression analysis identified the plasma renin activity (0.0004), norepinephrine (0.02) and interleukin-6 (0.03) as independent predictors of plasma angiotensin II. During follow-up (35+/-29 months), nine (12.8%) patients died and 13 had new heart failure episodes. Increased plasma angiotensin II, despite ACE inhibitor therapy, was a significant predictor of death or heart failure according to the Kaplan-Meier survival method by log rank test (P=0.002).",

    "23": "The present study was designed to determine whether the corneal penetration of test compounds is altered in aging. Experiments were carried out by means of passive transport under steady-state conditions using in vitro diffusion cells. Permeabilities of a variety of compounds with different physicochemical properties were measured in young (six weeks) and old (three to four years) intact and denuded (wounded) rabbit corneas. There was a marked difference in penetration of compounds between young and aged corneas. A significant decrease in permeability with age was observed. The degree of difference depended on the lipophilicity and molecular weight of the compound and the integrity of the epithelial cell layer. The difference was more pronounced for large hydrophilic than small lipophilic compounds in the intact corneas. The difference in permeabilities of test compounds between young and old denuded corneas was essentially the same (about 2-fold). These studies provide clues to the fundamental biochemical difference in young and old corneas and better enables the development of rationales for efficient drug and nutrient delivery across the cornea.", 
    "24": "Cations were adsorbed onto a poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) grafted poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membrane that served as a cation exchange membrane. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ionic strength of the adsorption medium on cation release from the PAA-PVDF membrane in the eye. Model cations, propranolol and timolol, were adsorbed onto the membranes in solutions with different ionic strengths (micron = 0.018 - 0.40) at pH 7.0. The circular drug-containing membranes were applied to both eyes of pigmented rabbits in the lower conjunctival sac. The membranes were well tolerated and well retained in the rabbit eye. Membranes containing either propranolol or timolol were removed from the eyes at preset time intervals, and the remaining drug content in the membranes was determined. The release rates of both propranolol and timolol decreased with increasing ionic strength of the adsorption medium. This was probably due to cationic exchange properties, as well as swelling properties of the membrane.", 
    "25": "We evaluated the retrobulbar response to a selective versus nonselective beta blocker in a subgroup of primary open-angle glaucoma patients (POAG) characterized by ocular vasospasm. Eleven patients who exhibited ocular vasospasm (i.e. a significant increase in ophthalmic artery blood flow velocity or a significant decrease in ophthalmic artery resistance index during hypercapnia) underwent medication washout for 4 weeks and were enrolled in a double-masked cross-over study (betaxolol versus timolol). Patients were evaluated for blood flow velocity of the retrobulbar vessels using color Doppler imaging, intraocular pressure, visual field sensitivity and contrast sensitivity at the beginning and end of each 4 week treatment period. Timolol treatment caused a significant reduction in IOP (p = .007), but no change in retrobulbar hemodynamics or visual function. After betaxolol treatment, resistance index fell significantly (p = .040) in the ophthalmic artery and increased significantly in both the central retinal (p = .003) and temporal posterior ciliary arteries (p = .030). Also following betaxolol treatment, contrast sensitivity improved significantly (p = .006), and a significant positive correlation was shown between change in contrast sensitivity and change in resistance index (r = .70; p = .015) of the ciliary arteries. POAG patients characterized by ocular vasospasm display a significant hemodynamic response to betaxolol, but not to timolol.",

    "34": "We report a method for the high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) chiral separation of racemic clenbuterol in human plasma. Human plasma was spiked with stock solutions of clenbuterol hydrochloride and practolol as the internal standard. Following a liquid-liquid extraction procedure with 10% (+/-)-2-butanol/isopropyl ether under alkaline conditions, the dried samples were reconstituted in methanol and chromatographed using a macrocyclic antibiotic chiral stationary phase (CSP) known as Chirobiotic T(trade mark) (teicoplanin). The mobile phase composition was methanol:acetonitrile (70:30, v/v), containing 0.3% (v/v) acetic acid and 0.2% (v/v) triethylamine. The resulting chromatogram achieved baseline separation for the clenbuterol enantiomers. Calibration curves (peak area ratio vs plasma concentration, n = 10) were constructed for the (-)-R-and (+)-S-clenbuterol enantiomers with a plasma concentration range of 0. 25-10 microM. The correlation coefficient (r) range was 0.99988-0. 99999 (mean = 0.99999). The lowest concentration measured was 0.25 microM. Inter- and intra-assay variation was determined for the lowest, medium and highest plasma concentration (0.25, 2 and 10 microM) by calculating the analytical recoveries with a range of 96-104%. The percentage recoveries for the clenbuterol enantiomers were 88.4-102% over the concentration range used. Detailed methodology is presented.", 
    "35": "Chronic administration of norepinephrine for 8 weeks has been shown to reduce neuronal norepinephrine uptake activity and increase interstitial norepinephrine concentration in the heart. To determine whether the changes could lead to myocardial beta-adrenoceptor down-regulation or beta-adrenergic subsensitivity, we measured left ventricular contractile responses to dobutamine, myocardial beta-adrenoceptor density, beta subtype distribution, competitive inhibition agonist binding, and adenylyl cyclase activity activation by isoproterenol, 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate, and forskolin in dogs after a norepinephrine or saline infusion for 8 weeks. We found that norepinephrine infusion reduced myocardial beta-adrenoceptor density, beta(1)-adrenoceptor subtype density, and high-affinity site for isoproterenol. Left ventricular contractile responses to dobutamine were reduced in the norepinephrine-infused animals. In addition, norepinephrine infusion decreased the basal adenylyl cyclase activity and the adenylyl cyclase responses to isoproterenol, 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate, and forskolin. The findings indicate that a decrease in cardiac norepinephrine uptake predisposes the heart to norepinephrine-induced myocardial beta-adrenoceptor down-regulation, and that norepinephrine, when present in a sufficient amount over a long period as it is in chronic heart failure, can reduce myocardial beta-adrenergic responsiveness by both homologous and heterologous desensitization.", 
    "36": "Before an antihypertensive drug is approved for use in clinical practice it must undergo rigorous clinical testing. Basic pharmacokinetic data are usually first obtained in healthy, normal individuals and thereafter in patients with renal or hepatic disease or in sub-groups such as the young or elderly. Acute dosing studies over a wide dosage range are then required prior to initiating longer-term studies. After one or more dosage levels have been selected and the appropriate dosing interval established, investigators may proceed with studies of four to twelve weeks duration, comparing the new drug with placebo or other standard therapies such as a thiazide diuretic or a beta-blocker. A key element in the evaluation process is the assessment of the drug",

A better understanding of scleral mechanical resistance could explain scleral thinness without any clinical scleritis.", 
    "38": "It is well known that thyrotoxicosis may elicit acute myocardial ischemia even in patients with angiographically normal coronary vessels. The involved mechanisms are not clearly defined although some hypothesis have been suggested. We report a case of a 54-year-old woman affected by Graves' disease with thyrotoxicosis which was referred to our Institute because of unstable angina. During hospitalization a two dimensional echocardiogram, performed during chest discomfort, showed left ventricular apical akinesis and impaired global systolic function. A subsequent coronary angiography revealed normal epicardial vessels. She was successfully treated with high-dose methimazole and propranolol and a repeat echocardiogram evaluation showed normalization of left ventricular systolic function. Six months later, because of the appearance of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, the patient underwent total thyroidectomy and a substitutive therapy with L-T4 (100 micrograms/die) was started. The authors review the possible mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia during thyrotoxicosis.", 
    "39": "A capillary zone electrophoresis method was developed for the enantioseparation of celiprolol enantiomers, using a sulfated beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) as a chiral selector. The use of a coated capillary was necessary to achieve stable and reproducible enantioseparations. A central composite design was applied to optimize the method and four parameters were selected for this study: the buffer pH, the buffer concentration, the sulfated beta-CD concentration and the temperature. Resolution between celiprolol enantiomers as well as analysis time and generated current were established as responses. For each response, a model was obtained by a second-degree mathematical expression. From the models, the most favorable conditions were determined by optimizing the resolution between celiprolol enantiomers and by setting the two other responses at threshold values. Response surfaces were also used to assess the robustness of the analytical method around the optimal region. Successful results were obtained with a 52 mM acetate buffer at pH 4.0 in the presence of 3.0 mM sulfated beta-CD at a temperature of 19.5 degrees C. Under these optimized conditions, baseline separation of the celiprolol enantiomers was achieved in less than 10 min. The method showed good validation data in terms of precision, accuracy and linearity, and was found to be suitable in determining celiprolol enantiomers in pharmaceutical preparations and in biological fluids.", 
    "40": "Eleven organic solvents were tested for their suitability in the use of capillary electrophoresis (CE). In all cases, 25 mM ammonium acetate and 1 M acetic acid were used as electrolytes. Three basic therapeutical agents, propranolol, carteolol and imipramine, were used as analytes. Four solvents (2-propanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, dichloromethane) were not suitable for use with CE under our conditions. Depending on the other solvents used, the analytes showed very different behavior. We observed that the epsilon/eta quotient alone is not sufficient for a characterization of the solvents. Further investigations with all the solvents as 1:1 mixtures with methanol were carried out. As a result some principal changes occurred compared to the pure solvents. Working with mixtures of different solvents proved to be advantageous because of the possibility to influence properties like high viscosity or low ionizing abilities by the addition of a suitable second solvent.", 
    "41": "GnRH acts via phospholipase C (PLC) activating G-protein coupled receptors to stimulate secretion of gonadotrophins from gonadotrophs. These cells are also regulated by gonadal steroids, which act centrally to influence GnRH secretion, and peripherally to modulate GnRH action. We have shown that oestradiol can stimulate proliferation and modulate GnRH-stimulated [(3)H]inositol phosphate ([(3)H]IP(x)) accumulation (used as a measure of PLC activity) in a gonadotroph-derived cell line (alphaT3-1). Here we show that when alphaT3-1 cells were incubated in medium with 2% foetal calf serum (FCS), [(3)H]thymidine incorporation was not stimulated by oestradiol but was reduced to <2% of control by the oestrogen antagonist, raloxifene. The inhibitory effect of 10 or 1000 nM raloxifene was reversed competitively by oestradiol. A similar pattern of effects was seen when effects of oestradiol and raloxifene on the proportion of cells in the S-phase of the cell cycle (as measured by flow cytometry of propidium iodide-labelled cells) and on oestrogen receptor activity (as measured by trans-activation of the oestrogen-response elements in the vitellogenin promoter) were quantified. In addition, RT-PCR revealed expression of alpha and beta (but not beta2) subtypes of oestrogen receptors. Thus, oestrogen is an essential mitogen for alphaT3-1 cells, its mitogenic effect is oestrogen receptor mediated and is associated with a marked alteration of cell cycle distribution, and the full extent of these effects are best revealed in the presence of raloxifene. Using this strategy, we found that cells cultured for 4 days with 10 nM raloxifene expressed GnRH receptors (K(d) for (125)I-buserelin 4.33 nM) and that their activation by GnRH caused a concentration-dependent increase in [(3)H]IP(x) (in cells labelled with [(3)H]inositol) and inositol 1,4,5 trisphophate (in unlabelled cells). Addition of 10 nM oestradiol (to overcome receptor blockade by raloxifene) reduced GnRH receptor number by 31% but increased maximal effects on [(3)H]IP(x) and Ins(1,4,5)P(3) approximately 4-fold. The effects of oestradiol on GnRH receptor number and signalling were not, however, mimicked by culture for 2 days in medium with 10% FCS and the S-phase blocker, thymidine (15 mM). This treatment increased the proportion of cells in the S-phase 2- to 3-fold but did not alter GnRH receptor number or signalling. Other treatments which altered cell cycle transition (hydroxyurea, colcemid, methotrexate) also failed to alter GnRH receptor number or signalling and no correlation was seen between GnRH receptor number or GnRH-stimulated [(3)H]IP(x) accumulation and the proportion of cells in the S-phase or G2/M-phases of the cell cycle. Thus, oestradiol has pronounced effects on GnRH signalling, proliferation and cell cycle distribution in alphaT3-1 cells, but these trophic effects do not underlie the modulation of GnRH signalling.", 
    "42": "The Oxygen Diffusion Barrier Hypothesis states that aging in the liver is associated with restricted oxygen uptake that explains the age-related impairment of phase I drug clearance observed in vivo with preservation of in vitro phase I enzyme activity and in vivo phase II drug clearance. Aging in the liver may be secondary to oxidative stress. Therefore we examined the effects of oxidative injury on oxygen uptake, and phase I and phase II drug metabolism in the liver. Oxidative stress was induced in the perfused rat liver with hydrogen peroxide. The intrinsic clearances of propranolol and morphine were used as markers of phase I and phase II activity, respectively. Oxidative injury was associated with a 14+/-99% (P=0.03) reduction in oxygen uptake. The decrease in the intrinsic clearance of propranolol was greater than that of morphine (57+/-14% vs 34+/-7% P<0.005). This result supports the concept of a restriction of oxygen supply constraining hepatic drug metabolism following oxidative stress. This has implications for aging and hepatic drug metabolism.",

    "54": "Heart failure is one of the commonest debilitating conditions of industrialized society, with mortality and morbidity comparable with that of the common neoplastic diseases. The role of antagonists of the adrenergic beta-receptor (beta-blockers) in heart failure has been the subject of debate for many years. Data from studies of the therapeutic use of beta-blockers in patients following acute myocardial infarction suggest that in this circumstance these agents confer at least as much benefit to patients with heart failure as they do to those without. Similarly retrospective analysis of a number of the studies of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in heart failure suggest a greater effect of the combination of beta-blocker with ACE inhibitor compared with ACE inhibitor alone. The results of recent prospective, placebo-controlled studies of the addition of beta-blocker to standard therapy in patients with chronic heart failure have confirmed a significant beneficial effect. beta-blocker therapy in these studies was well tolerated and in addition to improved mortality, beta-blocker therapy is associated with improved morbidity in terms of progressive heart failure and numbers of hospitalizations. Initiation of beta-blocker therapy in heart failure may be associated with deterioration of cardiac function in the short term. Treatment should be started at a low dose of beta-blocker with slow up-titration in a number of steps over several weeks. In spite of the established benefits of ACE inhibition in patients with heart failure, this treatment is under-utilized. Part of this shortfall is due to physicians' perceptions regarding potential unwanted effects of ACE inhibition. Perceptions regarding unwanted effects of beta-adrenoceptor blocker therapy are likely to be at least as great. While beta-blockade represents a welcome addition to the therapeutic armoury of physicians caring for patients with heart failure, initiation and stabilization of beta-adrenoceptor blocker therapy should be undertaken under specialist supervision.", 
    "55": "Kinins have the potential to modulate the sympathetic system. However, the kinin receptor subtypes and secondary mediators involved in vivo are not fully characterized. Earlier studies failed to show complete inhibition by B1- or B2-antagonists of bradykinin-induced catecholamine release, and were impeded by direct stimulatory actions of those substances. Such effects may arise from the involvement of histamine, the release of which is known to be stimulated by bradykinin and kinin-receptor antagonists. The present study was designed to evaluate the significance of B2-receptors and histamine in the bradykinin-induced enhancement of plasma catecholamines in pithed spontaneously hypertensive rats. The effects of bradykinin, the B2-receptor antagonist HOE 140, histamine and the H1-receptor antagonist mepyramine were tested. Administration of histamine dose-dependently increased catecholamine release whereby a marked preference for adrenaline over noradrenaline was seen. The H1-receptor antagonist mepyramine (0.3 mg/kg) prevented this effect. Bradykinin (7.2 microg/kg) enhanced plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline. In doses > or = 10 microg/kg, HOE 140 completely suppressed the bradykinin-induced increase in plasma noradrenaline, while a slight stimulation of adrenaline that even persisted after a high dose of HOE 140 (100 microg/kg), was only abolished by additional administration of mepyramine (0.3 mg/kg). The H1-receptor antagonist at this dose did not influence the effectivity of bradykinin. It is concluded that the bradykinin-induced enhancement of catecholamine release during electrical stimulation is completely (noradrenaline) or predominantly (adrenaline) mediated by B2-receptors. A minor stimulating effect of bradykinin on plasma adrenaline is provoked independently of B2-receptors via histamine acting on H1-receptors.",

Since it has been reported that ATP affects cells via P2-purinergic receptors, growth inhibitory effects of ATP and its derivatives on immortalized human fibroblasts were investigated in the present study in order to learn what type of receptors are involved in ATP cytotoxicity. The ATP derivatives used in this study were: ATP, ADP, beta, gamma-methyleneadenosine 5'-triphosphate (MeATP), 2' & 3'-o-(4-benzoylbenzoyl) adenosine, triethylammonium salt (BzATP), adenosine 5'-o-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATPgammaS), 2-methylthioadenosine 5'-triphosphate (2-MeSATP) and UTP. The extent of cytotoxicity induced by these drugs was found to be in the order of: ATP=ADP>ATPgammaS>MeATP=BzATP. On the other hand, neither 2-MeSATP nor UTP showed any cytotoxicity. These findings indicate that ATP may exert the cell growth inhibition by certain kinds of signal transduction via P2x or P2y purinergic receptors which affect intrinsic channels/pores of cell membrane and/or G protein activation. As a result, intracellular elevation in the concentrations of ions such as calcium and potassium, membrane depolarization, loss of endogenous ions/metabolites, and activation of inositol phospholipid-specific phospholipase C may occur. Actually, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, nifedipine, and an ATP-sensitive K+-channel blocker, glybenclamide, reduced the growth inhibitory effects of ATP on the cells to some extent. The growth inhibition caused by ATP was not due to apoptosis or induction of a cyclin/CDK kinase inhibitor, P21.", 
    "64": "Negative chronotropic effects of beta-adrenoceptor (betaAR) antagonists on right atria from reserpine-treated rats and mice were determined as a test of their inverse agonist activities. BetaAR antagonist ICI-118,551 and nonselective betaAR antagonists alprenolol, propranolol, and timolol produced negative chronotropic effects. In contrast, nonselective betaAR antagonists pindolol and nadolol as well as beta1AR-selective antagonists atenolol, acebutolol, and metoprolol did not cause a significant decrease in atrial rates. The neutral antagonist pindolol but not the inverse agonist alprenolol inhibited the negative chronotropic activities of ICI-118,551. Isoprenaline, salbutamol, and noradrenaline produced positive chronotropic effects; the chronotropic effects of isoprenaline and salbutamol but not of noradrenaline were antagonized by ICI-118,551.

    "65": "While acquiring data for the International Long QT Syndrome Registry, we noticed that a number of patients referred for long QT syndrome (LQTS) were affected by asthma. The effect of asthma comorbidity on clinical course of LQTS has not been studied. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of asthma in patients with LQTS, determine the influence of asthma comorbidity on outcome of LQTS patients, and to investigate the confounding effects of beta mimetics and beta blockers on the occurrence of cardiac events in asthmatic patients. The influence of asthma on risk of cardiac events (syncope, aborted cardiac arrest, or LQTS death) was evaluated after accounting for age, gender, QTc, and RR interval duration, beta-blocker and beta-mimetic use. Asthma was identified in 226 (5.2%) of 4,310 studied LQTS family members. Longer QTc duration was associated with higher incidence of asthma (p <0.001). Asthma was independently associated with significantly increased risk of cardiac events in affected LQTS patients (hazard ratio 1.32; p = 0.048) and in borderline-affected family members (hazard ratio 2.08; p = 0.004) after adjustment for QTc, RR interval, and gender. An increased risk of cardiac events in asthmatic patients observed before beta-blocker therapy was reduced after initiation of treatment with beta blockers. In conclusion, the occurrence of asthma in LQTS patients increases with QTc duration. Asthma comorbidity in LQTS patients is associated with an increased risk of cardiac events. The asthma-associated increase in the risk of LQTS-related cardiac events is diminished after initiation of beta-blocker therapy, suggesting a possible role of beta-receptor modulation underlying asthma-LQTS association.", 
    "66": "It is known that binding sites with endothelin(A) (ET)(A) and ET(B) receptor characteristics coexist in human heart but little is known about the receptors that mediate cardiostimulant effects of ET receptor agonists or their consequences. Functional studies were performed on isolated human cardiac tissues. The maximal positive inotropic effects of ET-1 were right atrium > left atrium = right ventricle. The rank order of potencies of agonists in right atrium was sarafotoxin S6c > ET-1 = ET-2 > or = ET-3. The ET(A) receptor-selective compounds BQ123 (10 microM) and A-127722 (1 microM) only slightly blocked (<0.5 log-unit shift) the effects of lower concentrations of ET-1, and the ET(B) receptor antagonist Ro46-8443 (10 microM) did not cause blockade. SB 209670 caused concentration-dependent rightward shifts of ET-1 and sarafotoxin S6c concentration-effect curves with Schild slopes not different from one and affinities (-logM K(B)) of 7.0 and 7.9, respectively. ET-1 caused arrhythmic contractions in right atrial trabeculae that were prevented by 10 microM SB 209670 but not 10 microM BQ123 or 1 microM A-127722, precluding ET(A) receptors. ET-1 caused a higher incidence of arrhythmic contractions in tissues taken from patients treated with beta-blockers before surgery than in tissues from non-beta blocker-treated patients. Sarafotoxin S6c produced arrhythmias that were prevented by SB 209670. The positive inotropic effects of ET-1 in human right atrial myocardium are mediated mostly by a non-ET(A), non-ET(B) receptor. Ventricular inotropic ET receptors differ from atrial inotropic ET receptors. ET-1 induced arrhythmic contractions in human atria do not appear to be mediated by an ET(A) receptor.", 
    "67": "The effect of W-7 [N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide hydrochloride] on Ca(2+) signaling in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells was investigated. W-7 (0.1-1 mM) induced a [Ca(2+)](i) increase, which comprised an initial increase and a plateau. Ca(2+) removal inhibited the Ca(2+) signals by 80%, suggesting that W-7 activated external Ca(2+) influx and internal Ca(2+) release. Pretreatment with the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (2 microM) and the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) pump inhibitor thapsigargin (1 microM) abolished the internal Ca(2+) release induced by 0.5 mM W-7; conversely, pretreatment with W-7 prevented thapsigargin and carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone from releasing internal Ca(2+). W-7 (0.2 mM) induced Mn(2+) quench of fura-2 fluorescence, which was inhibited by La(3+) (0.1 mM) by 80%. La(3+) (0.1 mM) partly inhibited 0.2 mM W-7-induced [Ca(2+)](i) increase. Addition of 5 mM Ca(2+) induced a significant [Ca(2+)](i) increase after pretreating with 0.2 to 1 mM W-7 in Ca(2+)-free medium for 5 min, suggesting that W-7 induced capacitative Ca(2+) entry. W-7 (0.5 mM) potentiated the capacitative Ca(2+) entry induced by 1 microM thapsigargin by 15%. Pretreatment with aristolochic acid (40 microM) to inhibit phospholipase A(2) reduced 0.5 mM W-7-induced internal Ca(2+) release and external Ca(2+) influx by 25 and 80%, respectively. Inhibition of phospholipase C with U73122 (2 microM) or inhibition of phospholipase D with propranolol (0.1 mM) had no effect on the internal Ca(2+) release induced by 0.5 mM W-7. It remains unclear whether W-7 induced [Ca(2+)](i) increases via inhibition of calmodulin. Three other calmodulin inhibitors (phenoxybenzamine, trifluoperazine, and fluphenazine-N-chloroethane) did not alter resting [Ca(2+)](i).", 
    "68": "beta-Adrenergic agonists are potent relaxing agents of airway smooth muscle; however, they are often incapable of fully reversing agonist-mediated contractions. The present study was designed to quantitate the relationship between beta-adrenoceptor binding, signal transduction, and relaxation in rabbit tracheal smooth muscle (TSM). TSM segments contracted with acetylcholine to 25 to 75% maximal contraction were relaxed with cumulative administration of isoproterenol (ISO). A beta-adrenergic receptor \"deficit\" was found, such that incomplete relaxation was achieved with full receptor occupancy. Binding studies with [(3)H]dihydroalprenolol demonstrated a beta-adrenoceptor density of 33.1 +/- 8.6 fmol/mg protein in control TSM. Paired studies were performed in TSM from rabbits treated with dexamethasone. Relative to control tissues, dexamethasone-treated TSM displayed twice as much relaxation and cAMP production in response to ISO and twice the beta-adrenoceptor density (82.2 +/- 12.3 fmol/mg protein). Dexamethasone did not affect G(i) function, as assessed by the degree of functional antagonism exerted by acetylcholine on ISO-induced relaxations, or beta-adrenoceptor-G(s) coupling, as reflected in high-affinity beta-agonist binding. Collectively, these results demonstrate that corticosteroid administration exerts parallel potentiating effects on beta-adrenoceptor expression and function in rabbit airway smooth muscle.",

Effective refractory periods (ERPs) were determined at 5 myocardial sites, and regional conduction velocity was determined in LAD-perfused and -nonperfused regions. Regional lidocaine infusion increased DER values by 84% (P=0.008) and slowed conduction velocity by 23% to 35% (P<0.01) but did not affect ERP. Conversely, regional low- and high-dose d-sotalol infusion did not alter DER values or conduction velocity but increased regional ERP by 14% to 17% (P<0.001). Regional lidocaine increased conduction velocity dispersion by 100% to 200% (P=0.01) but did not change ERP dispersion, whereas d-sotalol increased ERP dispersion by 140% (P<0.001) without affecting conduction velocity dispersion.

The affinity values (pKi) for (beta1,beta2-) and putative beta4-adrenoceptors, estimated from binding inhibition, were (-)-propranolol 8.4, 5.7; (-)-bupranolol 9.7, 5.8; (+/-)-cyanopindolol 10.0,7.4. 3. In left ventricular papillary muscle, in the presence of 30 microM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, (-)-CGP 12177 and (+/-)-cyanopindolol caused positive inotropic effects, (pEC50, (-)-CGP 12177, 7.6; (+/-)-cyanopindolol, 7.0) which were antagonized by (-)-bupranolol (pKB 6.7 - 7.0) and (-)-CGP 20712A (pKB 6.3 - 6.6).

(-)-CGP 12177 (1 microM) in the presence of 200 nM (-)-propranolol increased Ca2+ transient amplitude by 56% in atrial myocytes, but only caused a marginal increase in ventricular myocytes. In the presence of 1 microM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and 200 nM (-)-propranolol, 1 microM (-)-CGP 12177 caused a 73% increase in Ca2+ transient amplitude in ventricular myocytes. (-)-CGP 12177 elicited arrhythmic transients in some atrial and ventricular myocytes. 5. Probably by preventing cyclic AMP hydrolysis, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine facilitates the inotropic function of ventricular putative beta4-adrenoceptors, suggesting coupling to Gs protein-adenylyl cyclase. The receptor-mediated increases in contractile force are related to increases of Ca2+ in atrial and ventricular myocytes. The agreement of binding affinities of agonists with cardiostimulant potencies is consistent with mediation through putative beta4-adrenoceptors labelled with (-)-[3H]-CGP 12177.",

Consequently, it appears particularly suitable to study current based delivery systems like iontophoresis that deliver ions or highly polar molecules. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the adequacy of a skin microdialysis technique to characterize and quantify the dermatopharmacokinetics of iontophoretically delivered propranolol in the dermis of healthy human volunteers. Linear microdialysis probes were inserted in the subject's forearm skin and an iontophoresis device was installed above them. Constant current was applied for two periods of 1 h each separated by a 1-h interval. Dialysate samples were collected every 6 min for 4.4 h and analyzed by HPLC. Probes were always placed in the dermis as measured by ultrasonography. Propranolol was detectable in the dialysate. It was possible to build detailed concentration vs. midtime profiles that mirrored the current applied. Elimination rate from the dermis had first-order kinetics and was similar in all subjects. Quantification of the absorption process, indexed by lag-time and area under the concentration curve showed a high inter- and intrasubject variability that did not correlate with probe depth.", 
    "78": "The biosynthetic mta gene cluster responsible for myxothiazol formation from the fruiting body forming myxobacterium Stigmatella aurantiaca DW4/3-1 was sequenced and analyzed. Myxothiazol, an inhibitor of the electron transport via the bc(1)-complex of the respiratory chain, is biosynthesized by a unique combination of several polyketide synthases (PKS) and nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), which are activated by the 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase MtaA. Genomic replacement of a fragment of mtaB and insertion of a kanamycin resistance gene into mtaA both impaired myxothiazol synthesis. Genes mtaC and mtaD encode the enzymes for bis-thiazol(ine) formation and chain extension on one pure NRPS (MtaC) and on a unique combination of PKS and NRPS (MtaD). The genes mtaE and mtaF encode PKSs including peptide fragments with homology to methyltransferases. These methyltransferase modules are assumed to be necessary for the formation of the proposed methoxy- and beta-methoxy-acrylate intermediates of myxothiazol biosynthesis. The last gene of the cluster, mtaG, again resembles a NRPS and provides insight into the mechanism of the formation of the terminal amide of myxothiazol. The carbon backbone of an amino acid added to the myxothiazol-acid is assumed to be removed via an unprecedented module with homology to monooxygenases within MtaG.", 
    "79": "Carvedilol and lacidipine have been shown to exert cardioprotective effects in rat models of chronic hypertension. We investigated their effects in an acute model of pressure overload produced by suprarenal aortic constriction, in which enhanced myocardial production of endothelin-1 could play a crucial role. In the absence of drug treatment, after 1 week, aortic banding provoked an increase in carotid pressure associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (29%; P<0.01). These changes were accompanied by increased myocardial expression of preproendothelin-1 (2.5 times; P<0.05) and skeletal alpha-actin (3.6 times; P<0.05), but the expression of cardiac alpha-actin was not modified. Oral administration of carvedilol at a dose of 30 mg. kg(-1). d(-1) to rats with aortic banding normalized carotid pressure and left ventricular weight as well as preproendothelin-1 and skeletal alpha-actin gene expression. Carvedilol at a lower dose (7.5 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) and lacidipine 1 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) had only moderate and nonsignificant effects on carotid pressure but largely prevented left ventricular hypertrophy (P<0.01) and preproendothelin-1 overexpression (P<0.05). Labetalol (60 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) tended to exert similar effects but insignificantly. These results show that the antihypertrophic properties of carvedilol and lacidipine are partly independent of their antihypertensive effects and may be related to their ability to blunt myocardial preproendothelin-1 overexpression. Moreover, carvedilol at a dose of 7.5 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) did not prevent myocardial overexpression of skeletal alpha-actin, which suggests that, in this model, reexpression of a fetal gene can be activated by pressure overload independently of cardiac hypertrophy.", 
    "80": "Pulmonary surfactant, a mixture consisting of lipids and proteins and secreted by type II cells, functions to reduce the surface tension of the fluid lining of the lung, and thereby decreases the work of breathing. In mammals, surfactant secretion appears to be influenced primarily by the sympathetic nervous system and changes in ventilatory pattern. The parasympathetic nervous system is not believed to affect surfactant secretion in mammals. Very little is known about the factors that control surfactant secretion in nonmammalian vertebrates. Here, a new methodology for the isolation and culture of type II pneumocytes from the lizard Pogona vitticeps is presented. We examined the effects of the major autonomic neurotransmitters, epinephrine (Epi) and ACh, on total phospholipid (PL), disaturated PL (DSP), and cholesterol (Chol) secretion. At 37 degrees C, only Epi stimulated secretion of total PL and DSP from primary cultures of lizard type II cells, and secretion was blocked by the beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist propranolol. Neither of the agonists affected Chol secretion. At 18 degrees C, Epi and ACh both stimulated DSP and PL secretion but not Chol secretion. The secretion of surfactant Chol does not appear to be under autonomic control. It appears that the secretion of surfactant PL is predominantly controlled by the autonomic nervous system in lizards. The sympathetic nervous system may control surfactant secretion at high temperatures, whereas the parasympathetic nervous system may predominate at lower body temperatures, stimulating surfactant secretion without elevating metabolic rate.", 
    "81": "We have developed a simple isolated lung preparation for measurement of liquid and solute fluxes across mouse alveolar epithelium. Liquid instilled into air spaces was absorbed at the rate (J(w)) of 3.7 +/- 0.32 ml x h(-1) x g dry lung wt(-1) x J(w) was significantly depressed by ouabain (P < 0.001) and amiloride (P < 0.001). Omission of glucose from the instillate or addition of the Na(+)-glucose cotransport inhibitor phloridzin did not affect J(w). However, the low epithelial lining fluid glucose concentration (one-third that of plasma), the larger-than-mannitol permeability of methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside, and the presence of Na(+)-glucose cotransporter SGLT1 mRNA in mouse lung tissue suggest that there is a Na(+)-glucose cotransporter in the mouse alveolar-airway barrier. Isoproterenol stimulated J(w) (6.5 +/- 0.45 ml x h(-1) x g dry lung wt(-1); P < 0.001), and this effect was blocked by amiloride, benzamil, ouabain, and the specific beta(2)-adrenergic antagonist ICI-118551 but not by atenolol. Similar stimulation was obtained with terbutaline (6.4 +/- 0.46 ml x h(-1) x g dry lung wt(-1)). Na(+) unidirectional fluxes out of air spaces varied in agreement with J(w) changes. Thus alveolar liquid absorption in mice follows Na(+) transport via the amiloride-sensitive pathway, with little contribution from Na(+)-glucose cotransport, and is stimulated by beta(2)-adrenergic agonists.", 
    "82": "Chronic treatment with beta-receptor blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in heart failure can reduce mortality and improve left ventricular function, but the mechanisms involved in their beneficial action remain to be fully defined. Our hypothesis was that these agents prevent the derangement of cardiac energy metabolism. Rats were subjected to myocardial infarction (MI) or sham operation. Thereafter, animals were treated with bisoprolol, captopril, or remained untreated. Two months later, cardiac function was measured in the isolated heart by a left ventricular balloon (pressure-volume curves), and energy metabolism of residual intact myocardium was analyzed in terms of total and isoenzyme creatine kinase (CK) activity, steady-state levels (ATP, phosphocreatine), and turnover rates (CK reaction velocity) of high-energy phosphates (31P nuclear magnetic resonance) and total creatine content (HPLC). Bisoprolol and partially captopril prevented post-MI hypertrophy and partially prevented left ventricular contractile dysfunction. Residual intact failing myocardium in untreated, infarcted hearts showed a 25% decrease of the total, a 26% decrease of MM-, and a 37% decrease of the mitochondrial CK activity. Total creatine was reduced by 15%, phosphocreatine by 21%, and CK reaction velocity by 41%. Treatment with bisoprolol or captopril largely prevented all of these changes in infarcted hearts. Thus the favorable functional effects of beta-receptor blockers and ACE inhibitors post-MI are accompanied by substantial beneficial effects on cardiac energy metabolism.", 
    "83": "We previously reported that endothelin-1 (ET-1) activates p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells and consequently induces synthesis of interleukin-6. In the present study, we investigated the effect of ET-1 on the induction of heat shock protein 27 (HSP 27) in MC3T3-E1 cells. ET-1 time and dose dependently stimulated HSP 27 accumulation. ET-1 induced an increase in the levels of mRNA for HSP 27. Both staurosporine and calphostin C, inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC), suppressed the ET-1-induced HSP 27 accumulation. 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), a PKC activator, induced the HSP 27 accumulation and the expression of mRNA for HSP 27. The ET-1-stimulated HSP 27 accumulation was reduced in PKC-downregulated MC3T3-E1 cells. The HSP 27 accumulation by ET-1 was not suppressed by PD-98059, an inhibitor of the upstream kinase that activates p42/p44 MAP kinase. ET-1 or TPA induced the phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase. SB-203580, an inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, reduced the ET-1-stimulated HSP 27 accumulation. Calphostin C and U-73122, a phospholipase C inhibitor, suppressed the ET-1-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase. U-73122 and propranolol, a phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase inhibitor, reduced the ET-1-stimulated HSP 27 accumulation. SB-203580 suppressed the ET-1-stimulated increase in the mRNA levels for HSP 27. These results strongly suggest that ET-1 stimulates HSP 27 induction in osteoblasts and that p38 MAP kinase activation is involved in the HSP 27 induction.", 
    "84": "The effects of hypoxia/aglycemia on microvascular endothelial permeability were evaluated, and the second messenger systems and the cytoskeletal-junctional protein alterations in this response were also examined. Monolayers of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells on microcarrier beads were exposed to either thioglycolic acid (5 mM, an O(2) chelator), glucose-free medium, or both stresses together. Permeability measurements were performed over a 90-min time course. Although neither hypoxia alone nor aglycemia alone increased endothelial permeability significantly, the combination of both increased significantly as early as 15 min. Intracellular Ca(2+) measurements with fura 2-AM showed that hypoxia/aglycemia treatment increased Ca(2+) influx. To determine the second messengers involved in increased permeability, monolayers were incubated for 30 min with the cytosolic Ca(2+) scavenger 3,4, 5-trimethoxybenzoic acid 8-(diethylamino)octyl ester (TMB-8, 0.1 mM), a classical protein kinase C (PKC) blocker, G\u00f6-6976 (10 nM), a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) antagonist, KT-5823 (0.5 microM), or the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase inhibitor PD-98059 (20 microM). Hypoxia/aglycemia-mediated permeability changes were blocked by chelating cell Ca(2+), PKC blockade, PKG blockade, and by inhibiting p38 MAP kinase-1. Finally, changes in the binding of junctional proteins to the cytoskeleton under the same conditions were assessed. The concentrations of occludin and pan-reactive cadherin binding to the cytoskeleton were significantly decreased by only both stresses together. However, these effects were also blocked by pretreatment with TMB-8, G\u00f6-6976, KT-5823 (not in occludin), and PD-98059. These data suggest that hypoxia/aglycemia-mediated endothelial permeability may occur through PKC, PKG, MAP kinase, and Ca(2+) related to dissociation of cadherin-actin and occludin-actin junctional bonds.", 
    "85": "With the advent of several new topically active medications for glaucoma therapy, intraocular pressure (IOP) can be reduced to target levels in more patients before resorting to surgery. Some of these newer agents have a number of advantages over some of the older medications, several of which are seldom used now. The topically active carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are better tolerated than oral formulations, which are infrequently used despite their greater efficacy compared with the topical formulations. The alpha2-adrenergic agonists effectively reduce IOP with few systemic adverse effects. The prostaglandin analogues are even more effective and well tolerated when applied once daily without known systemic adverse effects. The variety of glaucoma medications forces the physician to be selective with various combinations before proceeding with surgery. This article critically reviews the literature pertaining to the newer glaucoma medications, thereby providing guidelines to make rational choices from among the available options.", 
    "86": "During hypoglycemia, hepatic glucose production increases and peripheral glucose utilization decreases. Systemic beta-adrenergic blockade during hypoglycemia increases peripheral glucose utilization. To explore the local effects of increased alpha- and beta-adrenergic activity on skeletal muscle glucose utilization, we measured arterial and venous plasma glucose concentrations, forearm blood flow (FBF), and forearm glucose uptake (FGU) during a hyperinsulinemic (40 mU/m2/min) stepped-hypoglycemic clamp with intrabrachial artery infusion of saline, phentolamine, propranolol, or combined phentolamine and propranolol. A control study was also performed with a euglycemic clamp and intraarterial saline. During hypoglycemia with saline and phentolamine, there were significant increases in FBF (130% +/- 38% and 180% +/- 35%, respectively) and FGU (120% +/- 51% and 230% +/- 150%, respectively). During hypoglycemia with propranolol and phentolamine + propranolol, FBF remained constant. FGU during hypoglycemia with propranolol was not different versus hypoglycemia with saline. No differences were found in these studies for forearm lactate output (FLO) or venous free fatty acid concentrations. These results demonstrate that local, as opposed to systemic, blockade during hypoglycemia does not alter peripheral glucose utilization.", 
    "87": "There are conflicting reports in the literature concerning the use of antimalarials in psoriatic patients with arthropathy or coexisting systemic lupus erythematosus. On the basis of a review of 18 publications in English, it was estimated that up to 18% of patients with psoriasis would develop an exacerbation of their disease following antimalarial therapy. In contrast to lithium and beta-blockers, antimalarials do not induce psoriasis de novo, but they only trigger already existing psoriasis, via a pharmacologic mechanism, probably due to an alteration of the activity of enzymes involved in the epidermal proliferation process. The chemical structure of the antimalarials is very similar to dansylputrescine, a potent transglutaminase (TGase) inhibitor. We suggested therefore that antimalarials trigger psoriasis through the modulation of the TGase activity. To verify this hypothesis, we examined the effect of hydroxychoroquine sulphate (HCQS) on cultured human skin and on TGase activity in vitro. Significant changes of epidermal morphology were seen in all explants cultured in the presence of HCQS. HCQS showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of TGase activity. We suggest that HCQS caused an initial break in the barrier function of the epidermis by inhibiting TGase activity; this was followed by a physiologic response of the epidermis aimed at barrier restoration. This rather non-specific stimulus to epidermal proliferation is probably sufficient to trigger psoriasis in predisposed individuals. Drug eruption is an age-old but timeless and fascinating subject. Of particular interest are those drug eruptions that may mimic idiopathic skin diseases. Apart from their obvious practical importance they are also of theoretical interest, because they provide an opportunity to investigate possible pathogenic mechanisms of the mimicked disease. In this paper, I would like to review briefly the characteristics of drug-induced psoriasis, and then propose a hypothesis concerning the pathogenesis of this phenomenon. In all, we found 258 reported cases of drug-induced psoriasis [1]. The drugs mainly involved are the antimalarials, lithium, beta blockers, and a large group of miscellaneous drugs. Three out of the four groups of drugs (lithium, beta blockers and miscellaneous drugs) can both induce or trigger psoriasis with almost equal frequency, namely they induce psoriasis de novo or they exacerbate an already existing psoriasis in 30-50% of the reported cases. Only one group of drugs, the antimalarials is an exception. In contrast to lithium and beta blockers, antimalarials do not induce psoriasis de novo, but only trigger already existing psoriasis. There are only three reported cases of psoriasis induced by antimalarials in patients who did not have the disease previously. Of these three patients, one had a seronegative arthritis and a family history of psoriasis, and, as stated by the author, there is evidence that the patient had pre-existing latent psoriasis. We believe that the other two cases may also have had latent psoriasis. That antimalarial drugs only trigger latent psoriasis and do not induce psoriasis de novo can be suspected from the fact that psoriasis cleared up completely after withdrawal of the drug in only 30% of patients on antimalarials, as compared with more than 60% of those receiving lithium and nearly 50% of those receiving beta blockers. This is probably also why the incubation period of the cases induced by antimalarial drugs is much shorter than that of lithium and beta blockers. Possibly, in triggered psoriasis (as in antimalarials) the drug only sets off with a chain of pathologic events previously programmed and ready to be set off, whereas in true drug-induced cases (as in some cases of lithium and betablockers) the drug is supposed to cause more profound changes and, therefore, more time is needed for these changes to occur.", 
    "88": "Nowhere across the spectrum of rheumatic and dermatological disease is the interaction of nature and nurture more relevant than in the connective tissue diseases such as SLE. While genetic and environmental factors are clearly involved in both the triggering of the disease and its expression, the interaction is complex with different combinations of factors contributing in different patients. For example, while genetic factors contribute substantially to susceptibility to lupus, this does not follow a simple Mendelian pattern of inheritance and mathematical models suggest that there may be varying contribution from at least four genes with differing inheritances. A variety of candidate genes and environmental factors have been highlighted in SLE but to dissect out the complexity of how these might interact requires the study of patient groups with a better defined clinical and serological phenotype. For example, studies of patients with subacute cutaneous lupus (SCLE) have shown associations with various genes in the MHC region (including HLA, complement and TNF) and suggest that the biological effect of inheriting an extended MHC region may be greater than its individual parts. One can now speculate on how interaction with an environmental factor such as UV light explains pathogenesis.",

Ten healthy male volunteers were given either a placebo or a single, standard oral dose of nadolol (80 milligrams). The upper lateral incisor teeth were anesthetized using lidocaine with or without epinephrine.",

These differences were both clinically and statistically significant (P = .007). Using lidocaine without epinephrine produced no clinically or statistically significant difference in duration of pulpal or soft-tissue anesthesia in the two groups of subjects. The authors noted no significant changes in blood pressure or pulse rate.",

However, when a vasoconstrictor is indicated for hemostasis, the local anesthetic should be administered slowly and in small amounts as pulse rate and blood pressure are being monitored. The patient should be informed that the duration of anesthesia might be prolonged.", 
    "98": "The present study investigated gender differences among adult patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (OHCM) and resting gradient. Using outflow gradients >10 mmHg and the presence of asymmetrical septal hypertrophy of the left ventricle as inclusion criteria, 122 patients were identified among patients referred for echocardiographic examinations between May 1990 and October 1996. Clinical, echocardiographical and follow-up data were compared between male and female patients. The female patients were significantly older than male patients (mean age +/-SD 66.7+/-10.5 vs 54.8+/-12.5 years). The female patients had a smaller interventricular septal wall thickness, less frequent systolic anterior movement of the mitral valve, more frequent association with hypertension, and less frequent association with ischemic heart disease (IHD) and giant T wave inversion. In this study population, adult female patients presented with OHCM 12 years later than males. Whether this represents female patients' reluctance to seek medical attention early, a different disease process that affects predominantly elderly females, or a gender-specific end organ response to aging, hypertension, IHD and other processes, or the protective effects of estrogen remains to be determined.",

    "123": "Angioplasty in acute coronary syndromes without ST elevation (angina + non Q wave infarction) is traditionally associated with an increased risk of major cardiac complications compared with angioplasty in stable angina. The recent development of instrumental techniques, in particular the introduction of stenting and pharmacological support for angioplasty have transformed the immediate prognosis in unstable angina. Consequently, angioplasty has become better tolerated and more easily recommended. Angioplasty cannot be considered without active medical therapy, including aspirin, betablockers, and non-fractionated or low molecular weight heparin, the use of the only inhibitor of GP IIb/IIIa receptors available in France, abciximab, remaining limited to the pharmacological environment of angioplasty in the absence of governmental authorization for its use in other indications. In high risk clinical situations, refractory angina, angina complicated by ventricular arrhythmias, left ventricular failure, mitral regurgitation, patients with a history of infarction or coronary bypass surgery, the indications of angioplasty and revascularization should be liberal as the prognosis of this patient group is improved. In situations of intermediate or low risk, there is no consensus about the best strategy, systematic or elective invasive procedures, that is to say guided by residual or recurrent myocardial ischaemia after initial stabilisation. However, the most recent trials, in particular FRISC II, seem to prove that systematic invasive procedures after stabilization by medical treatment, have a favourable influence on the prognosis compared with a conservative strategy. Other on-going trials may provide a definitive answer to this very controversial question.", 
    "124": "The effect of aging on the antiadrenergic actions of adenosine was studied in vitro and in vivo by using adult (6-month-old) and old (24-month-old) male Fischer 344 rats. In anesthetized animals, adenosine (0.01-0.1 micromol/kg), given as a rapid bolus into the right atrium, exerted a negative chronotropic effect manifested by a dose-dependent transient prolongation of sinus cycle length (SCL). This effect was similar in both age groups (n = 6, each; i.e., the percentage maximal prolongation of SCL (%deltaSCL) ranged from 12 +/- 2% to 63 +/-14% in the adult and from 20 +/- 7% to 57 +/- 15% in the old rats. In the presence of isoproterenol (0.2 microg/kg/min), the negative chronotropic action of adenosine was potentiated in the adult rats much more than in the old rats [i.e., %deltaSCL ranged from 60 +/- 28% to 183 +/- 48% vs. 40 +/- 12% to 70 +/- 13%, respectively (p < 0.05, adult vs. old)]. In the isolated perfused hearts, isoproterenol (1 microM for 1 min) exerted similar chronotropic and inotropic effects in adult (n = 9) and old hearts [n = 6; i.e., heart rate, left ventricular pressure (LVP), and LVdp/dt increased by 56 +/- 3%, 17 +/- 1%, and 37 +/- 2%, and 57 +/- 2%, 17 +/- 1%, and 35 +/- 3%, respectively, in the absence of, and by 27 +/- 2%, 7 +/- 1%, and 19 +/- 2% and 41 +/- 3%, 12 +/- 1%, and 25 +/-2% in the presence of adenosine (5 microM for 1 min)]. Adenosine administration after isoproterenol caused only an insignificant increase in coronary blood flow. Finally, the adenosine attenuation of either isoproterenol- or forskolin-induced production of 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) was significantly less in atrial membranes isolated from old versus adult rats (n = 6, each). It was concluded that in the old Fischer 344 rat hearts, the antiadrenergic action of adenosine is attenuated as compared with its action in adult rat hearts.", 
    "125": "Enhanced oxidant stress occurs under many pathophysiologic conditions (e.g., inflammation) and can be induced and mimicked by continuous nitrate therapy, eliciting increases in platelet activity, enhanced formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and impaired nitrate-induced vasorelaxation. Analysis was performed of effects of coinfusion of glycerol trinitrate (GTN) either with a carvedilol metabolite with antioxidant properties or with antioxidant vitamin C (Vit-C) on various hemodynamic parameters during enhanced oxidant stress associated with nitrate tolerance. Carvedilol metabolite (BM910228: 4.5 microg/kg/min) or Vit-C (55 microg/kg/min) was coadministered with GTN (1.5 microg/kg/min) for 5 days in chronically instrumented dogs. Changes in coronary diameters (CD) and other hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored, as well as changes in platelet function. At the beginning of GTN treatment, CD increased by 9.8 +/- 0.4% and progressively declined to basal control values within 3 days. However, with additional antioxidant protection either with BM910228 or with Vit-C, the GTN-induced increase in CD was maintained (8.6 +/- 0.4% or 10.5 +/- 0.6%) and remained elevated for the entire infusion period. The thrombin-stimulated intracellular Ca2+ concentrations of platelets remained nearly unchanged during Vit-C or BM910228 in contrast to the increase with GTN. The basal cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) contents of platelets after GTN coadministered with BM910228 or with Vit-C increased on day 1 to 233 or to 250% versus control and remained at that level. Additional in vitro tests with xanthine oxidase-induced oxidant stress resulted in a more or less pronounced scavenging of O2- radicals by BM920228, Vit-C, or superoxide dismutase (SOD). Coadministration of carvedilol metabolite BM910228 or of Vit-C along with GTN suppressed noxious effects of GTN-induced oxidant stress such as increased platelet activity and impaired nitrate-induced vasorelaxation.",

    "131": "Berberis aristata is an edible plant employed in South Asian traditional medicine; in particular, its fruit is used as a tonic remedy for liver and heart. In isolated cardiac tissues, Berberis aristata fruit extract exhibits a positive inotropic action. Activity-directed fractionation using organic solvents revealed that the cardiotonic activity is concentrated in the n-butanolic fraction (BF). The cardiac action of BF was investigated in spontaneously beating right atria and in electrically driven right ventricular strips and left atria obtained from reserpinized guinea pigs. The results show that this fraction produces a dose-dependent positive inotropic action with little effect on heart rate. To study its possible mode of action, guinea pig atria were pretreated with propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent. This treatment abolished the cardiotonic effect of isoprenaline, whereas the cardiotonic effect of BF remained unaltered, suggesting that this effect does not involve stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors. On the other hand, application of carbachol reverses only part of the BF-induced increase in ventricular force of contraction, indicating that besides a cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent mechanism, a cAMP-independent mechanism underlies the inotropic action of BF. This is in line with the observation that the dynamics of isometric twitch contractions are not significantly altered by BF. Investigations in skinned myocardial preparations showed that BF modulates the calcium-dependent interaction of actin and myosin, apparently by reducing the cooperativity of the calcium-dependent binding of myosin to actin, i.e., there is enhanced calcium activation at low to physiological intracellular calcium, and reduced calcium activation at high intracellular calcium concentrations as present, for example, in ischemic calcium overload. These data indicate that the edible plant, Berberis aristata, contains active principle(s) that cause(s) a selective inotropic effect, involving-in the form of the modulatory effect on actin myosin cooperativity-a novel mechanism of action. Further phytochemical and pharmacological studies may lead to isolation and structural identification of an attractive, new cardiotonic agent from Berberis aristata fruit.", 
    "132": "We report a patient with idiopathic oromandibular tremor resembling rabbit syndrome. The patient is a 36-year-old Japanese woman without any past and medical histories. On neurological examination, there was no abnormal finding except the oromandibular tremor. The tremor was confined to the jaw and perioral muscles. There was no extremity tremor. Laboratory findings were all normal, as well as her MRI and EEG. Surface EMG studies revealed that regular grouped discharges at a frequency of about 6 Hz appeared in the masseter, the orbicularis oris, and the digastric, and that the alternative contractions were found between the masseter and the digastric. Oral administration of tiapride was effective, but diazepam, trihexyphenydil, levodopa, and a beta-blocker were without effect. Although she had not taken neuroleptics, the appearance of the tremor was identical to the rabbit syndrome. The efficacy of the dopamine blockade may suggest that an abnormal basal ganglia function contributes to the pathophysiologic mechanism underlying this type of tremor.", 
    "133": "Chagas disease involves a cardiac impairment, being the first alterations of autonomic disorders which affect heart rate and blood pressure control. At this stage, diminished heart rate responses to atropine and propranolol are observed. Prior studies have shown that short term ganglioside treatment improves the responses to these agents, but there is no information about the long term effect of gangliosides and the evolution of antiGM1 titers. The effects of long term treatment with gangliosides on autonomic tests in patients with chagasic cardiodisautonomy and the evolution of antiGM1 titers were studied in 90 patients (57 men, 33 women, aged 25-60 years) with positive serology for Chagas disease and electrocardiogram showing sinusal bradycardia and incomplete right branch block, without cardiomegaly, with autonomic alterations by postural and Valsalva's tests. All patients were submitted to a test that consisted of intravenous injection of atropine 0.04 mg/kg followed 3 min later by intravenous injection of propranolol 0.2 mg/kg. During these tests heart rate and blood pressure were recorded continuously. Subsequently, 30 patients were treated with 100 mg/day of a mixture of gangliosides by intramuscular injection during 15 days in a row, followed by 40 mg/day during another 75 days. Another 30 patients received continuous treatment for 12 months. The remaining 30 patients were controls. The antiGM1 antibody circulating titers were determined before the treatment, at the third and 12th month. Seventy-four patients completed the study. Before treatment, the heart rate increased, though slightly, after the injection of atropine. After 3 months of ganglioside treatment a statistically significant increase in the response to atropine was recorded. In the controls at 12 months, the response to atropine remained increased without differences between the patients treated for 3 and 12 months. The control patients did not show any modification of the heart rate response during 12 months. Both ganglioside-treated groups showed an increase in the response to propranolol. The antiGM1 titer distribution was similar in both healthy subjects and chagasic patients. None of the patients had positive antiGM1 titers in basal conditions nor significant modifications after the ganglioside treatment. Chagasic cardioneuropathy was not associated in this study with high antiGM1 antibody titers. Chagasic patients showed a diminished heart rate response to atropine as well as to propranolol. Ganglioside treatment determined an increased heart rate response, particularly after atropine. Increased heart rate response was maintained until 1 year, without differences between the patients treated for 3 and 12 months. No changes in the antiGM1 titers were observed during the ganglioside treatment.", 
    "134": "Recent studies have revealed that activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) 1 and 2 by the stimulation of beta(3)-adrenoceptors played a critical role in cell survival in brown adipocytes. On the other hand, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 via beta(3)-adrenoceptors and its physiological and pathological significance in white adipocyte has remained uncertain despite the increasing significance of functioning white adipocytes. Accordingly, we here studied phosphorylation of ERK1/2 caused by the stimulation of beta(3)-adrenoceptors in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and the roles of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in lipolysis. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was induced by a selective beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonist, DL-4-[2'-\u00bf2-hydroxy-2-(3-chlorophenyl)ethylamino\u00bfpropyl] phenoxyacetic acid sodium salt sesquihydrate (BRL37344), in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by BRL37344 was sensitive to the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase inhibitor, N-[2-((p-bromocinnamyl)amino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (H89). To elucidate the roles of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in lipolysis, the effect of a selective inhibitor of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, 2'-amino-3'-methoxyflavone (PD98059), was examined. This inhibitor did not alter the lipolytic action caused by BRL37344, even at concentrations sufficient to block phosphorylation of ERK1/2, suggesting that ERK1/2 play no role in the lipolysis caused by BRL37344 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.",

On follow-up, recurrent symptoms caused by pacemaker malfunction were documented in 3 patients. Four patients died during the follow-up period: 2 adolescents stopped beta-blocker therapy, 1 patient died suddenly while treated with combined therapy, and 1 patient died of unrelated causes. In addition, 3 patients had resuscitated cardiac arrest while on combined therapy, and 1 patient had repeated, appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator discharges on follow-up.",

    "139": "Arrhythmic death can be reduced by antiarrhythmic drugs to a range of 24%. Electrophysiologic study by testing noninducibility of ventricular arrhythmia represents the classic method for evaluating the effectiveness of drug therapy. Several clinical studies have shown thaat sotalol suppresses VT induction and prevents arrhythmias recurrences at long term follow-up in 23% to 67% of patients. The efficacy of sotalol EP guided therapy in preventing VT/VF is not necessarily related to prevention of sudden death. In the ESVEM study the superiority of d,l-sotalol to other antiarrhythmic drugs was confirmed. The response to programmed ventricular stimulation was found to be strongly predictive for arrhythmia free state while the failure of sotalol therapy to suppress VT at the EP study was associated with an high recurrence rate (40%). However, EP study failes to predict freedom from sudden death. The beta-blocking activity of racemic sotalol may account for some of the observed survival benefit.Beta-blockers therapy reduces mortality in patients after myocardial infarction primarily by a reduction of sudden death. A reduction of death, worsening heart failure and life threatening ventricular arrhythmias was shown in a recent study on carvedilol. In the prospective study of Steinbeck the EP guided-therapy did not improve the overall outcome when compared to metoprolol. Suppression of inducible arrhythmias by antiarrhythmic drugs was associated with a better outcome. The effectiveness of defibrillator therapy in reducing overall mortality, has been uncertain since great clinical trials have been concluded. MADIT, AVID and CASH trials confirmed the superiority of ICD therapy over antiarrhythmic drugs therapy: ICD should be considered the first choice therapy in post-cardiac arrest patients. The ongoing BEST Trial will give us further responses about the interaction between EP study and metoprolol effect compared to ICD in patients post myocardial infarction also focusing on tolerability and compliance of the beta-blocking therapy in patients with low ejection fraction. In this study will be useful to optimize therapy in patients at high risk of sudden death.",

However, it remains unclear whether airway eosinophils enhance or reduce release of chemical mediators and/or action of the released mediators in the airways in vivo, because previous investigators have indicated that eosinophil-derived factors such as histaminase and arylsulfatase may alter the allergic reaction by metabolizing chemical mediators. Recently, we have developed a guinea pig model of propranolol-induced bronchoconstriction (PIB), which is mediated by lipid mediators such as thromboxane A2 (TxA2), cysteinyl leukotrienes (cLTs) and platelet activation factor (PAF).

In the present study, we investigated whether the autonomic nervous system is involved in the CGRP-induced heat production in urethane-anesthetized rats. Intraperitoneal administration of the ganglion blocker hexamethonium (20 mg/kg) or the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (5 mg/kg) suppressed the CGRP-induced increases in VO(2), HR, T(co), and T(IBAT). Pretreatment with the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine (5 mg/kg) partly attenuated the heat production response but did not affect the tachycardiac response. Bilateral sectioning of the nerves supplying the IBAT attenuated the CGRP-induced increase in T(IBAT) but not significantly that in VO(2) or T(co). In rats with adrenal demedullation, the effects of CGRP were similar to those in intact rats. These results suggest that the CGRP-induced heat production is mediated by the sympathetic nervous system and, at least in part, by the BAT through the alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors.",

    "154": "The rate of onset of the negative inotropic responses of guinea-pig isolated paced atria to the adenosine receptor agonist, N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine, was significantly slowed by the K(+) channel inhibitor, 4-aminopyridine (10 mM). The concentration-dependent inhibition of developed tension by N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine, however, was unaffected by 4-aminopyridine (10 mM). Thus, K(+) efflux only governs the speed of onset of the negative inotropic response and does not appear to be a major component in the negative inotropy produced by the adenosine A(1) receptor agonist. The P(1) purinoceptor antagonist, 8(p-sulfophenyl) theophylline (1 x 10(-5) M) significantly shifted the concentration-response curve for N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine to the right (concentration-ratio, 7.1+/-1.5). In the presence of 4-aminopyridine (10 mM), 8(p-sulfophenyl) theophylline caused a non-parallel rightwards shift of the curve. At the IC(35) there was no significant shift, whereas at the IC(75) there was a small significant displacement of the curve. The adenosine A(1)/A(3) receptor agonist, N(6)-2-(4-aminophenyl) ethyladenosine (APNEA) yielded a biphasic concentration-response curve which was significantly shifted to the right by 8(p-sulfophenyl) theophylline (1 x 10(-5 ) M). In the presence 4-aminopyridine, however, there was no shift of the APNEA concentration-response curve by 8(p-sulfophenyl)theophylline. These results show that when K(+) channels are blocked by 4-aminopyridine, the residual response is resistant to antagonism by the P(1) purinoceptor antagonist, 8(p-sulfophenyl)theophylline. This residual component may involve L-type Ca(2+) channels, the adenosine A(1) receptor being possibly coupled to the two transduction pathways for negative inotropism via the different components of the G protein (receptor-transducer promiscuity).",

It causes a concentration-dependent relaxation of rat aorta helical strips pre-contracted with 10(-6) M noradrenaline (NA; IC(50) 33 nM). It was equipotent to nitroglycerin (NTG; IC(50) 49 nM), but much more potent than isosorbide dinitrate (ISD; IC(50) 15,000 nM). 2. Oxyhaemoglobin (10 microM) shifted to the right the concentration-response curve for the relaxation induced by PF9404C (IC(50) 530 nM) or NTG (IC(50) 61 nM). 3. Either methylene blue (MB) or ODQ (1 microM each) largely prevented the vasorelaxing responses to increasing concentrations of PF9404C or NTG. 4. In rat aorta smooth muscle cells, PF9404C increased the formation of cyclic GMP from 3 pmol mg(-1) protein in basal conditions, to 53 pmol mg(-1) protein in 10 microM PF9404C. Neither metoprolol nor carvedilol enhanced cyclic GMP. 5. In the electrically driven guinea-pig left atrium, PF9404C blocked the inotropic effects of isoprenaline in a concentration-dependent manner. Its IC(50) (30 nM) was similar to that for S-propranolol (22.4 nM) and lower than the IC(50)s for metoprolol (120 nM) and atenolol (192 nM). The beta-adrenergic ligand (-)-[(3)H]-CGP12177 (0.2 nM) was displaced from its binding to rat brain membranes with K(i) of 7 nM, 17 nM, 170 nM and 1.2 microM respectively for PF9404C, S-(-)propranolol, metoprolol, and atenolol. 6. The data are consistent with the idea that the S-S diesteroisomer PF9404C, is a potent vasorelaxing agent, as well as a blocker of cardiac beta adrenergic receptors. The mechanism of its vasorelaxing effects involves the slow generation of NO. This molecule can, therefore, exhibit antihypertensive and cardioprotective actions through a double mechanism, NO donation and beta blockade.",

The values for clearance and volume of distribution at steady-state were 103+/-10 versus 90+/-6 ml min(-1) kg(-1) and 1.8+/-0.2 versus 1.6+/-0.2 l kg(-1) for the R- and S-isomer, respectively. In contrast, plasma protein binding showed a statistically significant difference with values of the free fraction of 5.7+/-0.5 and 11.4+/-0.6%. In addition the rate constant for transport to the effect compartment was also different with values of 0.027 versus 0.067 min(-1). 3. For both isomers the relationship between concentration and EEG effect was non-linear and successfully characterized on basis of the Hill equation. A statistically significant difference in the value of EC(50) of 328+/-11 versus 604+/-18 ng ml(-1) was observed for R- and S-tiagabine respectively. The values of the other pharmacodynamic parameters were identical. 4.

Although cysteinyl leukotrienes (cLTs) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) have been proposed to be involved in the pathophysiology of asthma, the role of these lipid mediators in propranolol-induced bronchoconstriction (PIB) has not been evaluated in asthmatics. This study was conducted to elucidate it. Nine patients with stable asthma, in whom a 20% or more decrease in FEV(1) occurred by inhalation of 20 mg/ml or less propranolol, participated in this study. A cLT antagonist, pranlukast (225 mg twice a day), a TXA2 antagonist, seratrodast (80 mg once a day), and placebo were orally given for 2 wk in a randomized and double-blinded manner. The provocative concentration of propranolol causing a 20% fall in FEV(1) (PC(20)) was determined on the last day of each 2-wk treatment. Pranlukast, but not seratrodast, tented to increase FEV(1) compared with placebo (2.14 +/- 0.29 versus 1.99 +/- 0.34 L, p = 0.0543). Pranlukast or seratrodast did not affect the PC(20) in comparison with placebo. We conclude that cLTs or TXA2 are not involved in PIB of asthmatics."
