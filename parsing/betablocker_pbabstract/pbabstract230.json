A postal questionnaire was sent to all Australian and New Zealand teaching hospitals to identify patterns of pre-operative cardiac risk evaluation and methods of peri-operative beta-blocker use. In all, 67 replies were evaluated (64% response rate). Specialist anaesthetists are present in the majority of pre-admission clinics (78%), with a designated peri-operative physician in 9%. Further cardiological referral was possible in almost all institutions (96%), and specific peri-operative physician referral in 54%. Waiting times for specialist consultation were < 7 days in the majority of cases. Whilst 79% of institutions used peri-operative beta-blockade, specific protocols were available in only 10%. In 60% of institutions, beta-blockers were administered to high-risk patients, and in 25% they were given to intermediate risk group patients. There was a wide range in the duration of pre- and postoperative beta-blocker administration. Whilst peri-operative risk assessment appears to be consistent, the pattern of beta-blockade, a known beneficial intervention, is variable. Reasons need to be identified, protocols developed and consistent administration targeted for further improvements to be made.", 
    "1": "With the use of normotensive laboratory Wistar strain rats, changes in heart rate induced by three newly synthesized potential ultrashort beta-blockers were tested. The animals were administered the tested substances intravenously in general anesthesia. In all animals, heart rate was measured at predetermined time intervals. All obtained values were converted into the per cents of the heart rate deviation and the results were statistically processed. Using F-test, variability of dispersion was determined, and using Student t-test, statistical significance of the particular change was determined. In all three substances tested, a statistically demonstrable short-time bradycardiac effect was observed. The most marked decrease took place in the first minute after intravenous administration. Substance 44Bu induced the significantly deepest decrease in heart rate (by 13.00%), which lasted longest. No statistically significant difference was found between the actions of substances 42Bu and 43Bu. In all three substances tested, marked changes in the ECG record were observed immediately after intravenous administration. PQ and QT intervals and QRS complex were prolonged, and marked S wave, elevation of the T wave, and a decrease in R wave occurred. The changes were accompanied by a change in the electric cardiac axis.",

Two different strategies were applied, one of which only uses a single reporter ligand and a more elaborated one which suppresses systemic disturbances by using a racemic mixture as reporter. The dissociation constants obtained by both alternatives were virtually identical and in good agreement with those previously reported.", 
    "4": "Once the need for drug therapy has been determined, the JNC-6 report provides three pathways for the choice of therapy: for uncomplicated patients, a diuretic or beta-blocker; for patients with diabetic nephropathy, isolated systolic hypertension, congestive heart failure or systolic dysfunction after myocardial infarction, specific drugs are compellingly indicated; for other conditions, certain drugs that provide favorable effects are recommended. Whatever drug is chosen, long-acting preparations that provide 24-h coverage with one daily dose are recommended.",

    "7": "In all, 33 patients entered this trial and 29 completed. The baseline trough intraocular pressure (IOP) was 23.3+/-2.4 and the diurnal curve IOP was 22.0+/-1.3 mmHg. For the brimonidine and timolol maleate treatment group, the trough IOP was 21.6+/-3.3 and the diurnal curve IOP was 19.8+/-2.1 mmHg, while the timolol and unoprostone treatment showed a trough IOP of 20.9+/-3.8 and a diurnal curve IOP of 19.3+/-2.4 mmHg. There was no significant difference between treatment groups at any time point for the diurnal curve, or in the reduction from baseline (P>0.05). Both treatments failed to statistically reduce the IOP from baseline at 1800 h. There was no difference between treatment groups regarding ocular and systemic unsolicited adverse events, but patients admitted to more dryness (P=0.02) and burning upon instillation (P<0.0001) with unoprostone by survey.",

Losartan caused a decrease in HVPG [from 15.6 (+/- 4.2) to 11.8 (+/- 3.5) mmHg (p 0.002)], without changes in portal blood flow and systemic hemodynamics. Changes in HVPG correlated with variations in portal resistance (r 0.88, p < 0.0001). Losartan induced a reduction in HVPG between 10 and 19% in 5/17 patients, and 20% or more in 8/17. Five out of eight patients who respond to losartan showed severe portal hypertension, with higher baseline HVPG (equal or greater than 16 mmHg).",

The present article reports a catecholaminergic polymorphic VT case of a 9-year-old girl, without any previous history of syncope, who has been found unconscious while playing and referred comatose to pediatric intensive care unit. The electrocardiogram pattern showed runs of bidirectional and polymorphic VT degenerating into ventricular fibrillation, without QT interval abnormalities. Various attempts of cardioversion, lidocaine, and magnesium sulfate intravenous infusions were only partially effective. Owing to catecholaminergic polymorphic VT highly suggesting electrocardiogram pattern, intravenous propranolol was administered, achieving immediate VT interruption. Long-term nadolol therapy effectively prevented further arrhythmias, with no relapses up to 10 months later; a good neurologic recovery was also obtained. Genetic evaluation revealed in this patient-but not in relatives-a mutation in ryanodine receptor gene on chromosome 1.", 
    "14": "The present study set out to investigate the pharmacological profile of the cardiovascular responses induced by the antimigraine agent, isometheptene, in pithed rats. For this purpose, intravenous (i.v.) administration of blocking doses of the antagonists prazosin (alpha1; 100 microg/kg), rauwolscine (alpha2; 300 microg/kg), the combination of prazosin (100 microg/kg) plus rauwolscine (300 microg/kg), propranolol (beta; 1000 microg/kg), ritanserin (5-HT2; 100 microg/kg) or equivalent volumes of saline (1 ml/kg) were used. Isometheptene (0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg, i.v.) produced dose-dependent increases in heart rate and diastolic blood pressure which were highly reproducible as they remained unaltered after saline. These tachycardic responses to isometheptene remained unaffected after prazosin, rauwolscine, ritanserin or the combination prazosin plus rauwolscine, but were abolished after propranolol. In contrast, the isometheptene-induced vasopressor responses were not significantly modified after the above doses of rauwolscine, ritanserin or propranolol, but were markedly blocked after prazosin or the combination of prazosin plus rauwolscine; the latter blockade did not significantly differ from that produced by prazosin alone. Interestingly, in rats pretreated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with reserpine (5 mg/kg; -24 h), isometheptene-induced tachycardic responses were abolished whereas the corresponding vasopressor responses were markedly attenuated and subsequently blocked by prazosin. It is concluded that isometheptene-induced tachycardic responses seem to involve only an indirect (tyramine-like action) mechanism mediated by beta-adrenoceptors, whilst the corresponding vasopressor responses are mediated by a predominantly indirect (tyramine-like action), as well as a minor direct (alpha1-adrenoceptors), sympathomimetic mechanism.", 
    "15": "Following treatment with beta blockers in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension, reduction of hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) to <12 mmHg or by >20% of baseline induces an extremely low risk of variceal bleeding. However, several factors such as compliance to therapy or alcohol abstinence may change the initial response after a long follow-up, and the effect of response on other complications of cirrhosis is less clear. The aim of this study was to assess the long-term maintenance of hemodynamic response and its influence on complications of cirrhosis.", 
    "16": "One hundred and thirty two cirrhotic patients received nadolol and isosorbide mononitrate to prevent variceal rebleeding. HVPG was measured at baseline, after 1 to 3 months under treatment and again 12 to 18 months later.", 
    "17": "Sixty four patients were responders. After a longer follow-up, earlier response did not change in 81% of cases. Changes of response were mainly related to modifications in medication dose or in alcohol intake. As compared with poor-responders, responders had a lower probability of developing ascites (P<0.001) and related conditions, a greater improvement of Child-Pugh score (P=0.03), and a lower likelihood of developing encephalopathy (P=0.001) and of requiring liver transplantation (P=0.002). Eleven responders and 22 poor-responders died (P=0.029).",

The combination of pindolol plus a SSRI produces increased synaptic 5-HT levels that are greater than those achieved with a SSRI alone. However, it is unclear whether this actually occurs in humans, and clinical studies of pindolol augmentation have produced inconsistent results. Since the release of cortisol and prolactin is under serotonergic control, we hypothesized that pindolol augmentation of synaptic 5-HT concentrations produced by an SSRI in humans should lead to enhanced SSRI-induced cortisol and prolactin responses.",

    "26": "Class IC and III antiarrhythmic drugs did not produce a significant QT interval prolongation. Only hydroquinidine administration caused a QT prolongation, which increased from 263 +/- 12 ms to 362 +/- 25 ms (calculated QT from 290 +/- 13 ms to 405 +/- 26 ms). Ventricular programmed stimulation showed prolongation of ventricular effective refractory period to > or =200 ms, and ventricular fibrillation was no longer induced.",

    "31": "Development of HF was comparable in BN and BNK rats. The AT(1)-ant reduced LVW and MCSA and the AT(2)-ant blocked these effects in BN rats, but the B(2)-ant did not. The AT(1)-ant reduced LVW and MCSA in BNK rats, and this effect was reversed by the AT(2)-ant. In BN rats, ICF was reduced and LVEF increased by AT(1)-ant, and both AT(2)-ant and B(2)-ant reversed these effects. In BNK rats, the AT(1)-ant failed to reduce ICF, and its therapeutic effect on LVEF was significantly blunted.", 
    "32": "In HF, the AT(2) receptor plays an important role in the therapeutic effects of AT(1)-ant, and this effect may be mediated partly through kinins; however, kinins appear to play a lesser role in the antihypertrophic effect of AT(1)-ant.",

The relative magnitude of these benefits did not vary as a function of the pretreatment SBP (all interaction: p > 0.10). However, because patients with the lowest SBP were at highest risk of an event, they experienced the greatest absolute benefit from treatment with carvedilol. The lower the pretreatment SBP, the more likely that patients would report an adverse event, be intolerant of high doses of the study drug, or require permanent withdrawal of treatment (p < 0.001 for all). However, these risks were primarily related to the severity of the underlying illness and not to treatment with carvedilol.", 
    "37": "The current study provides little support for concerns about using beta-blockers (particularly those with vasodilatory actions) in patients with severe CHF who have a low SBP.

There was a decrease in the use of treatments for which no survival advantage had been demonstrated in randomized trials, such as digitalis (49% to 35%, P <0.001), Vaughan-Williams class I antiarrhythmic agents (3.5% to 1.4%, P <0.001), and first-generation calcium antagonists (21.3% to 9.6%, P <0.001). The trends in drug therapy were associated with a 2.8% reduction in age-, sex-, and comorbidity-adjusted 1-year mortality and a 4.1% reduction in 1-year hospitalization rates. The observed trends in therapy over time explained 37% of the decrease in mortality and 30% of the decrease in rehospitalization rates. The treatment effect from beta-blockers was most pronounced, explaining 30% of the decrease in mortality and 10% of the decrease in rehospitalization rates.",

In this study the effects of nipradilol were compared with those of timolol maleate in dogs. Twelve clinically normal dogs (nine mongrels, two beagles, and one Akita) were used. We applied 0.25% nipradilol or 0.5% timolol maleate drops for a period of 28 days. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured before and after administration on the 2nd, 4th, 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th day. Blood pressure, pulse rate and coefficient of aqueous outflow (C-value) were also measured before and after administration on the 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th day. Both nipradilol and timolol maleate significantly lowered IOP from the 2nd day to the end of the study period. Nipradilol lowered IOP to an equivalent degree to timolol maleate. There was no significant change in blood pressure and pulse rate throughout the study period with administration of nipradilol. C-value showed a significant rise from the 14th day with administration of nipradilol, while it did not show any significant change during the study period with administration of timolol maleate. The reduction of IOP by nipradilol was similar to that by an existing beta-adrenergic antagonist, timolol maleate, but nipradilol was associated with fewer systemic side effects in dogs. Nipradilol appears to be a useful drug for treatment of glaucoma in dogs.",

The patients, aged 43, 19, 27, 26, and 56 years, had experienced syncopal attacks and were followed up for 3-17 years (average 9.4 years). Patients were treated with a beta-blocker alone (2) or combined with other drugs (3). The mutation in four patients was missense (A614V, T613, E130K) and its location was the pore region (3) or between the S1 transmembrane region and N-terminal (one). The fifth patient had an intragenic deletion (49 bp deletion) at HERG exon 4 (S1 transmembrane region and N-terminal), which was not identified as having any mutation. The patients manifested a notched T wave in at least one left precordial or limb lead (I, II or aVF). A low T wave amplitude was shown in at least one lead, and deeply inverted or biphasic waves in right precordial leads were also associated with these findings. The abnormal T wave finding in any of the 12 leads in our 5 LQT2 patients was shown to be widespread and was always found during the long-term follow up. The present cases suggest that notched T waves are useful for diagnosing female symptomatic LQT2 patients.",

Increasing dosage of 25 to 50 mg was later initiated according to the patients' condition. In 2 cases that failed to respond to conventional antiarrhythmic, esmolol was administered via intravenous injection (5-10 mg) to control malignant ventricular arrhythmia within approximately 30 min, followed by a 2-day course of intravenous infusion at the rate of 1 to 2 mg/min.",

    "49": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have proven to be a rich source of therapeutic targets; therefore, finding compounds that regulate these receptors is a critical goal in drug discovery. The Transfluor technology utilizes the redistribution of fluorescently labeled arrestins from the cytoplasm to agonist-occupied receptors at the plasma membrane to monitor quantitatively the activation or inactivation of GPCRs. Here, we show that the Transfluor technology can be quantitated on the INCell Analyzer system (INCAS) using the vasopressin V(2) receptor (V(2)R), which binds arrestin with high affinity, and the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR), which binds arrestin with low affinity. U2OS cells stably expressing an arrestin-green fluorescent protein conjugate and either the V(2)R or the beta(2)AR were plated in 96-well plastic plates and analyzed by the INCAS at a screening rate of 5 min per plate. Agonist dose-response and antagonist dose-inhibition curves revealed signal-to-background ratios of approximately 25:1 and 8:1 for the V(2)R and beta(2)AR, respectively. EC(50) values agreed closely with K(d) values reported in the literature for the different receptor agonists. In addition, small amounts of arrestin translocation induced by sub-EC(50) doses of agonist were distinguished from the background noise of untreated cells. Furthermore, differences in the magnitude of arrestin translocation distinguished partial agonists from full agonists, and Z' values for these ligands were >0.5. These data show that the Transfluor technology, combined with an automated image analysis system, provides a direct, robust, and universal assay for high throughput screening of known and orphan GPCRs.",

Significantly, more respondents followed the guidelines to screen and treat large varices to prevent initial variceal hemorrhage in 2000 than in 1997, 54% versus 18% (p < 0.005). Of the respondents who performed screening of EGDs, the majority treated large varices with beta-blocker therapy (93% in 1997 and 97% in 2000). All respondents used early endoscopy to treat variceal bleeding. Significantly, most of the respondents began pharmacologic therapy prior to endoscopy if active variceal hemorrhage was suspected (with most choosing octreotide) in 2000 than in 1997, 83% versus 56% (p < 0.005). The majority of the respondents pursued repeat endoscopic therapy after cessation of the initial variceal bleeding episode (96% in 1997 and 95% in 2000), and most performed surveillance EGD once the varices had been eradicated (72% in 1997 and 79% in 2000).",

    "54": "The presence of inadequately controlled hypertension in a diabetic patient with clinical signs of renal involvement portends a poor prognosis. Initial assessment should include ruling out factors which may exacerbate the hypertension and careful assessment of the stage of hypertension, renal function and amount of proteinuria. Intensive treatment requires finding a combination of medications which will reduce not only blood pressure but also proteinuria. It is suggested that treatment should be started with an ACE inhibitor or an AT1 receptor blocker often in a fixed combination with a low-dose thiazide diuretic. Calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers may be added if required as second or third-line agents. In patients not responding to this combination, the dosages of the ACE inhibitor or AT1 blocker should be titrated upwards in order to obtain the maximal therapeutic effect. However, if this is still insufficient, dual blockade of the RAS should be considered and even an aldosterone receptor blocker may need to be added to the therapeutic regimen. It should be remembered that such a patient requires close monitoring in order to be sure that he is compliant with respect to the prescribed treatment and that there are no side-effects such as hyperkalaemia.", 
    "55": "The study was aimed to examine the effects of different presentations of hyperlipidemia on the pharmacodynamics of lipophilic propranolol and hydrophilic atenolol. Thirty subjects were divided into four study groups: the normolipemic subjects, patients with hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia and patients with mixed form of hyperlipidemia. The drugs were administered orally at a single dose of 80 mg propranolol and 100 mg atenolol, using a cross-over study design. The plasma concentrations of propranolol and atenolol were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Heart rate as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure were evaluated in relation to the serum drug concentrations. In the light of the results obtained, the following conclusions were drawn: 1) hyperlipidemia affects pharmacodynamic properties of lipophilic propranolol and hydrophilic atenolol, 2) a modification of the drug dosage in hyperlipidemia is warranted.",

    "58": "Imipramine induced a dose-dependent decrease in glucose-stimulated insulin output (IC(50)=5.2 micromol/l). It also provoked a concentration-dependent reduction in (45)Ca outflow from islets perifused in the presence of 16.7 mmol/l glucose. Moreover, imipramine inhibited the increase in (45)Ca outflow mediated by K(+) depolarisation. Patch-clamp recordings further revealed that imipramine provoked a marked and reversible decrease of the inward Ca(2+) current. In single islet cells, imipramine counteracted the rise in [Ca(2+)](i) evoked by glucose or high K(+) concentrations.", 
    "59": "These data indicate that imipramine dose-dependently reduces the insulin secretory rate from rat pancreatic beta cells. Such an effect appears to be mediated by the inhibition of voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) channels with subsequent reduction in Ca(2+) entry. Thus, it is possible that some adverse effects of imipramine are related, at least in part, to its capacity to behave as a Ca(2+) entry blocker.", 
    "60": "Reductions in voltage-activated K+ (Kv) currents may underlie arrhythmias after myocardial infarction (MI). We investigated the role of beta-adrenergic signaling and the calcineurin/NFAT pathway in mediating the reductions in Kv currents observed after MI in mouse ventricular myocytes. Kv currents were produced by the summation of 3 distinct currents: I(to), I(Kslow1), and I(Kslow2). At 48 hours after MI, we found a 4-fold increase in NFAT activity, which coincided with a decrease in the amplitudes of I(to), I(Kslow1), and I(Kslow2). Consistent with this, mRNA and protein levels of Kv1.5, 2.1, 4.2, and 4.3, which underlie I(Kslow1), I(Kslow2), and I(to), were decreased after MI. Administration of the beta-blocker metoprolol prevented the activation of NFAT and the reductions in I(to), I(Kslow1), and I(Kslow2) after MI. Cyclosporine, an inhibitor of calcineurin, also prevented the reductions in these currents after MI. Importantly, Kv currents did not change after MI in ventricular myocytes from NFATc3 knockout mice. Conversely, chronic beta-adrenergic stimulation or expression of an activated NFATc3 decreased Kv currents to a similar extent as MI. Taken together, these data indicate that NFATc3 plays an essential role in the signaling pathway leading to reduced I(to), I(Kslow1), and I(Kslow2) after MI. We propose that increased beta-adrenergic signaling after MI activates calcineurin and NFATc3, which decreases I(to), I(Kslow1), and I(Kslow2) via a reduction in Kv1.5, Kv2.1, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3 expression.", 
    "61": "The relationship between myocardial G protein receptor kinase (GRK) expression and beta-adrenoceptor signalling in human left heart diseases has not been fully elucidated yet. In this study, we characterized and compared the GRK2-7 expression in patients with left ventricular volume overload disorders and dilated cardiomyopathic hearts, and evaluated the relationship of this expression with alterations in myocardial beta-adrenoceptor signalling in volume overload, in order to test the notion that GRK functional expression is influenced in a disease-specific and selective fashion. We established that GRK2, GRK3, and GRK5 are well expressed, while GRK4, GRK6, and GRK7 are only scarcely detectable in the healthy human heart. Compared to control hearts (n=8), GRK2 mRNA expression was elevated by 71% (P<0.005) in the left ventricle, 110% (P<0.05) in the right ventricle, 130% (P<0.05) in the left atrium, and 1300% (P<0.005) in the right atrium (RA) of the dilated cardiomyopathy hearts (n=6). In the volume overload group (n=10), it was increased by approximately 40% (P<0.05) in the left ventricle, 38% in the right ventricle, 81% (P<0.05) in the left atrium, and 850% (P<0.005) in the right atrium. On the other hand, GRK5 was significantly elevated only in the left ventricle by 68% (P<0.05) in the dilated cardiomyopathy hearts and by 48% (P<0.01) in volume overload patients, while in contrast, GRK3 remained unchanged in dilated cardiomyopathy, but was slightly elevated by 36% (P=0.05) in the right ventricle of the volume overload patients. The alterations in GRK expression were accompanied with a decrease in myocardial beta(1)-adrenoceptor mRNA in all four chambers, and these trends in gene expression were paralleled with those of their immunodetectable protein levels. Furthermore, these changes were in association with a decrease in downstream receptor-stimulated, adenylyl cyclase-mediated functional expression and an increase in ventricular protein kinase A activity. The results point to differences in which myocardial GRKs are regulated in cardiac disease, whereby changes in GRK2 expression may be related to the global effects of the disease on myocardial adrenoceptor function and those in GRK5 may be localized to the ventricles, depending on the nature of the myocardial load.",

We have investigated the relaxant and anti-inflammatory activities of NCX-950 (alpha'-[[(1,1-dimethylethy)amino]methyl]-4-hydroxy-1,3-benzenedimethanol nitrate) (a nitric oxide-releasing salbutamol) in human isolated bronchi and on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute airway inflammation in mice. NCX-950 (10(-8)-10(-5) M) elicited a relaxation of human isolated bronchi moderately higher than salbutamol, which was reduced by a beta-adrenergic blocking drug, propranolol, but not by an inhibitor of guanylate cyclase, ODQ (1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-] quinolaxin-1-one). The treatment of mice with NCX-950 (1, 10, and 100 microM aerosol) markedly inhibited the neutrophil influx induced by LPS aerosol in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, whereas salbutamol at equimolar doses elicited a moderate inhibition. Pretreatment of mice with NCX-950 (100 microM) also significantly reduced tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6 (IL-6), transforming growth factor-beta, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 release in BAL fluid, whereas salbutamol was ineffective. Propranolol, but not ODQ, suppressed the inhibitory activity of NCX-950 on neutrophil influx and IL-6 release in BAL fluids. A nitric oxide-releasing sildenafil NCX-911 [(5-[2-ethoxy-5-(4-methylpiperidinylsulfonyl)phenyl]-1-methyl-3-n-propyl-1,6-dihydro-7H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidin-7-one nitrate)], but not sildenafil (100 microM) also reduced the neutrophil influx following LPS exposure in mice. This study reported that NCX-950 elicits potent relaxant and anti-inflammatory activities compared with salbutamol, and these effects may be mainly due to the activation of the beta2-adrenoceptor rather than the cGMP pathway.",

    "79": "Antianginal drugs that exert their anti-ischaemic effects primarily by altering myocardial metabolism have recently attracted attention. They have the potential to relieve symptoms in patients with refractory angina who are already on \"optimal\" medical therapy and have disease that is not amenable to revascularisation, making these drugs an attractive addition to therapy, particularly for the elderly population. In some cases, they may even be used as first-line treatment. These drugs increase glucose metabolism at the expense of free-fatty-acid metabolism, enhancing oxygen efficiency during myocardial ischaemia. Whilst they have been demonstrated to reduce ischaemia in several clinical trials, their use remains limited. This review aims to draw attention to these \"metabolic\" antianginal drugs while surveying the evidence supporting their use and mode of action. Four metabolic antianginal drugs are reviewed: perhexiline, trimetazidine, ranolazine, and etomoxir. We also discuss the metabolic actions of glucose-insulin-potassium and beta-blockers and describe myocardial metabolism during normal and ischaemic conditions. The potential of these metabolic agents may extend beyond the treatment of ischaemia secondary to coronary artery disease. They offer significant promise for the treatment of symptoms occurring due to inoperable aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and chronic heart failure.",

This has been formulated by a multidisciplinary working group, set up by the Netherlands Heart Foundation and the Netherlands Society of Cardiology, in cooperation with the Dutch Institute for Healthcare Improvement. Heart failure is defined as: 'a complex of complaints and symptoms resulting from an inadequate pumping function of the heart'. Indications for heart failure are dyspnoea on exertion, reduced exertion tolerance and oedema. By using data from the medical history, case history, physical examination and simple additional tests (laboratory tests, ECG, chest X-ray photos) it is possible to demonstrate or exclude heart failure in clear-cut cases. Doppler ultrasonography should be performed in all patients where heart failure is suspected but cannot be clearly demonstrated. The initial treatment for patients with heart failure with reduced systolic LV function generally consists of the administration of a thiazide or loop diuretic together with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a beta-blocker, to which digoxin and/or spironolactone may be added. For very old patients extra attention should be given to the comorbidity and the medication and dosing scheme should be as simple as possible. The worse the cardiac function, the more the salt and fluid intake should be limited and the more strictly the weight should be monitored.",

Both E2 and nifedipine inhibit the increase in expression of these by Abeta. MPTP also increases expression of alpha(1C) and alpha(1D), but the increases were not influenced by E2 or nifedipine. These observations suggested that Abeta cytotoxicity in SK-N-SH cells may involve increased availability of calcium to cells, whereas MPTP induced cytotoxicity does not require extracellular Ca(2+). Both cytotoxic models were associated with increased expression of Ca(2+) channel alpha(1) subunits, and neuroprotection associated with inhibition of that increase. These studies reveal that nifedipine, in addition to its direct action of nifedipine on Ca(2+) channels, may also protect neurons from Abeta toxicity through the suppression of the channel protein overexpression. A new action of dihydropyridines (DHPs) may be considered in the regulation of calcium homeostasis.", 
    "112": "Consideration regarding human aging and sympathetic nervous system activity suggests that old age represents a hyperadrenergic state. With advancing age the sympathetically mediated stress on the body, specifically the cardiovascular system, may outweigh the benefits an intact sympathetic nervous system conveys for short-term survival. Beta blockers temper the effects of the sympathetic nervous system by slowing heart rate and decreasing blood pressure. Recently, beta blockers have been shown to improve outcome and survival following surgery and myocardial infarction, have beneficial effects in patients with heart failure, and may have an antiatherosclerotic effect. We propose that instituting beta receptor blockade pharmacotherapy at an early age will increase longevity by countering the adverse effects of sympathetically mediated stress.", 
    "113": "Human placental syncytiotrophoblast is the main barrier for materno-fetal exchange. Analysis of transplacental transport involves the study of ion channels in both the maternal-facing microvillous membrane (MVM) and the fetal-facing basal membrane (BM). Difficulties in having access to intact placenta with conventional electrophysiological methods favour alternative methodologies, such as isolation and reconstitution of membranes in artificial lipid systems. Pre-eclampsia is a major health problem of human pregnancy. The search for altered physiological processes in pre-eclamptic placentae requires the investigation of events at both the microvillous and basal surfaces. The aim of this study was to obtain reliable syncytiotrophoblast plasma membranes from human normal (N) and pre-eclamptic (PE) pregnancies. We describe a protocol which allows for the simultaneous isolation of MVM and BM. The purity of the membranes isolated was evaluated using enzymatic assays, binding studies, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Enrichment of alkaline phosphatase activity for MVM was 17 to 21-fold, with 13-16 per cent protein recovery, for both N and PE. Enrichment of adenylate cyclase activity for BM was 9-fold for N, and enrichment of dihydroalprenolol binding to beta-adrenergic receptors was 12-fold for N and 6-fold for PE, with 14 per cent protein recovery for both N and PE. Cross contamination was low and mitochondrial membrane contamination was negligible. We conclude that MVM and BM isolated from placentae of pre-eclamptic women are similar in enrichment and purity to those of healthy women, thus allowing their use in comparative electrophysiological studies.", 
    "114": "The efficacy of beta blockers in managing patients with post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was established based on randomized controlled trials predating the era of modern therapy in Western populations. We compared the effects of beta blockers on cardiovascular events with those of calcium antagonists in Japanese post-AMI patients on modern reperfusion therapy by performing a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-blind end point study. Five hundred forty-five patients were assigned to the beta-blocker group and 545 patients to the calcium antagonist group. The mean follow-up period was 455 days. There was no significant difference in the incidence of cardiovascular death (1.7% vs 1.1%), reinfarction (0.9% vs 1.3%), uncontrolled unstable angina (11.0% vs 10.6%), and nonfatal stroke (0.7% vs 0.2%) between the 2 groups. However, the incidences of heart failure and coronary spasm were significantly higher in the beta-blocker group than in the calcium antagonist group (4.2% vs 1.1%, p = 0.001; 1.2% vs 0.2%, p = 0.027, respectively). We conclude that the cardiovascular event rate is substantially lower in Japanese post-AMI patients receiving modern therapy than in those reported in the West, and that there are no significant differences in the cardiovascular event rate between the beta-blocker and calcium antagonist groups.", 
    "115": "A matrix-in-cylinder system for sustained drug delivery, consisting of a hot-melt extruded ethylcellulose (EC) pipe surrounding a drug containing HPMC-Gelucire 44/14 core, was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. In an aqueous medium, the HPMC-Gelucire core forms a gel plug, which releases the drug-through the open ends of the EC pipe--by means of erosion. The influence of hydrodynamic and mechanical stress and the effect of different 'physiologically relevant' dissolution media on the in vitro drug release were investigated. From these in vitro dissolution tests, it was concluded that the EC pipe has a protective effect on the drug containing HPMC-Gelucire core. It largely protects the core against hydrodynamics and mechanical stress. Furthermore, drug release from the matrix-in-cylinder system was only slightly affected by the composition of the dissolution medium. A randomised crossover in vivo study in dogs revealed that the matrix-in-cylinder system containing propranolol hydrochloride has an ideal sustained release profile with constant plasma levels maintained over 24 h. Moreover, administration of the matrix-in-cylinder system resulted in a 4-fold increase in propranolol bioavailability when compared with a commercial sustained release formulation (Inderal).", 
    "116": "A clinical case of non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with involvement of the right ventricle is reported. The patient was a 42-year-old male with symptoms suggesting an effort angina of recent onset. The diagnosis was established by echocardiography, which showed asymmetric hypertrophy of the interventricular septum (20 mm), hypertrophy of the right ventricular free wall, and severe hypertrophy of the septal papillary muscle of the tricuspid valve. The patient underwent a complete diagnostic evaluation, including exercise stress test, Holter monitoring, magnetic resonance, myocardial tomoscintigraphy and complete hemodynamic assessment. Medical treatment with atenolol 50 mg day was started; at 1-year follow-up the patient's clinical conditions are good, with decrease of anginal episodes. The literature review elicits the paucity of information about this condition, despite a frequent involvement of both ventricles in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. The case reported shows two atypical aspects: a) the involvement of the right ventricle in non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is anecdotal; b) this pattern of hypertrophy (right ventricular free wall/septal papillary muscle) has never been previously reported. Right ventricular involvement in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy must be carefully investigated, because it may be more frequent than conventionally deemed.",

Overall, 46% of patients received beta-blockers, but only 18% of these were ultimately prescribed the dosages achieved in the trials (mean maximum dosages achieved, 27 mg/d for carvedilol and 81 mg/d for metoprolol tartrate). Of those patients prescribed beta-blockers, 74% continued to receive them during follow-up. Blood pressure, heart rate, and failure symptomatology did not change appreciably before and after beta-blockers were prescribed, or during the upward titration of the dosage. Although our patients were prescribed lower dosages than those used in trials, Cox multivariate regression revealed that beta-blockers were associated with improved survival, even after adjusting for potential confounders including New York Heart Association class, year of prescription, and concomitant medication use (relative risk, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.50-0.81).",

Based on these factors, a risk score for development of diabetes was calculated for all non-diabetic patients, who were divided into tertiles. For each tertile of risk, captopril therapy was associated with a reduced risk of diabetes development compared with conventional diuretic and/or beta-blocker therapy.

    "147": "The release and physiological actions of secretin on pancreatic exocrine secretion and gastric secretion of acid and motility are regulated by neuro-hormonal control. The release of secretin by duodenal acidification is mediated by a secretin releasing peptide (SRP). The release and action of SRP are neurally mediated depending on vagal afferent pathway. SRP activity in acid perfusate of the duodenum was substantially decreased when rats were treated with tetradotoxin (TTX), perivagal application of capsaicin, a beta-adrenergic blocker, Met-enkephalin (MEK) or vagotomy. The release of secretin by SRP was abolished in rats treated with TTX, mucosal or perivagal application of capsaicin, MEK or vagotomy. Both release of secretin and pancreatic exocrine secretion (PES) elicited by duodenal acidification were also inhibited dose-dependently by Met-enkepahlin, 5-HT(2) antagonist, ketanserin and 5-HT(3) antagonist, ondansetron. Stimulation of PES and inhibition of gastric acid secretion and motility by secretin in a physiological dose are also dependent on the vagal afferent pathway as these effects of secretin are abolished by perivagal capsaicin treatment or vagotomy. In conscious rats, vagotomy, vagal ligation, or perivagal colchicine but not capsaicin treatment reduced the number of secretin binding sites in the forestomach suggesting another mode of neural regulation that affects gastric motility. Except in the rat, stimulation of PES by secretin in a physiological dose is profoundly inhibited by atropine indicating the importance of a cholinergic input. In isolated and perfused rat pancreas, electrical field stimulation potentiated secretin-stimulated PES that was suppressed by atropine and anti-GRP serum, suggesting the roles of intrapancreatic cholinergic and GRP-containing neurons. In rats, secretin-stimulated PES was inhibited by a NO synthase inhibitor suggesting mediation by NO. However, the neuropeptides and neurotransmitters involved in regulation of the release and action of secretin and their sites of action remain to be elucidated.", 
    "148": "Experiments were performed in neuronal (nNOS)- and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-deficient mice to study the role of nitric oxide (NO) in macula densa control of renin secretion in vivo and in the isolated, perfused mouse kidney. Acute and chronic administration of loop diuretics was used as a method to stimulate macula densa-mediated renin secretion. Increases in plasma renin concentration (PRC) in response to a 3-day infusion of bumetanide (50 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) or an acute injection of furosemide (50 mg/kg ip) were not markedly altered in nNOS-/- mice. Responses to furosemide were also maintained in eNOS-/- mice, but the administration of N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) markedly attenuated the PRC response to furosemide in these mice. In the isolated kidney preparation, bumetanide caused similar relative increases in renin secretion in kidneys of wild-type, nNOS-/-, and eNOS-/- mice. Bumetanide only marginally increased renin secretion in L-NAME-treated kidneys, but the bumetanide effect was normalized by S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine. Basal PRC was significantly reduced in male nNOS-/- mice compared with nNOS+/+ (189 +/- 28 vs. 355 +/- 57 ng ANG I.ml(-1).h(-1); P = 0.017). There was no significant difference in PRC between eNOS+/+ and eNOS-/- mice. Basal renin secretion rates in perfused kidneys isolated from nNOS-/- or eNOS-/- mice were markedly reduced compared with wild-type controls. Our data suggest that NO generated by macula densa nNOS does not play a specific mediator role in macula densa-dependent renin secretion. However, NO independent of its exact source permits the macula densa pathway of renin secretion to function normally.",

Currently over 5 million Americans suffer from the syndrome of heart failure with significant direct treatment costs estimated to be in excess of $22 billion per year. Unfortunately, assuming present demographic and medical trends continue, these bleak statistics are expected to worsen substantially over the next two decades. Epidemiologic studies have furthered our mechanistic understanding of heart failure pathophysiology by demonstrating that many patients with this syndrome have preserved systolic function by standard indices. In a positive turn, major advances have occurred in the treatment of heart failure based on the development of clinically effective pharmacologic antagonists of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems. These agents are capable of substantially reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with heart failure. However, the importance of enhanced physician and public awareness of heart failure remains critical in the future.", 
    "150": "The incidence of peripheral pulmonary adenocarcinoma has increased in recent years. Clara cell has been known as target for carcinogens and source of pulmonary tumors. One of the presumed roles of the bronchiolar Clara cell is the secretion of pulmonary surfactant into the bronchiolar lumen. To establish the secretory morphology of Clara cell, a well-defined secretory agonist, isoproterenol (500 mg/kg) and the antagonist, propranolol (20 mg/kg), were administered into five-week old mice. The secretory response was examined at 1 hour and 4 hours after injection. Ultrastructural morphometry was used to quantitate the secretory response by measuring area of apical cap of the Clara cells. Isoproterenol caused a significant increase in area of apical cap of Clara cells 1 and 4 hours after injection (p < 0.0001), while pretreatment with propranolol prevented this effect at 4 hours. Propranolol alone significantly decreased the area of Clara cells (p < 0.0001). Clara cells secretory granules disappeared 1 hour after propranolol plus isoproterenol administration, and the granules reappeared at 4 hours. The accelerated secretion of Clara cells by isoproterenol provides evidence of their secretory mechanism controlled by beta-adrenergic agonists. The study has confirmed the secretory role of Clara cells. The secretion is both apocrine and merocrine type.", 
    "151": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta adrenergic blockers, and nesiritide are pharmacologic agents for heart failure with both short- and long-term neurohormonal and hemodynamic effects. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta adrenergic blockers reduce morbidity and mortality in chronic heart failure. Higher doses may result in better outcomes than lower doses, but concern about hemodynamic tolerance is a major barrier to the initiation and up-titration of these agents. Nesiritide is a newer neurohormonal agent with proven efficacy and safety for use in decompensated heart failure, but appropriate patient selection has been challenging for clinicians. Like vasodilators, nesiritide may be underutilized in heart failure treatment. Impedance cardiography is a newer, noninvasive monitoring technology that can accurately measure hemodynamic parameters. Impedance cardiography is being used with increasing frequency by clinicians to guide therapy in patients with heart failure and has been proposed in heart failure treatment algorithms. Three case reports are presented to illustrate how hemodynamic data using impedance cardiography can be utilized in the initiation and titration of neurohormonal agents.", 
    "152": "Heart failure affects 3% of African Americans. The etiology of disease and prognosis for these patients differs substantially from those for non-African Americans. A history of hypertension is associated with development of heart failure more often in African Americans than in non-African Americans and it also appears that target organ involvement is more severe in African Americans with hypertension than in other patient subgroups. Reviewing the results from large-scale clinical end point studies suggests that optimal treatment for heart failure in African Americans may differ from that of their non-African American counterparts. More importantly, concomitant use of beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be as effective in African Americans as in non-African Americans. Utilizing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors alone may not represent ideal therapy. Of the drugs studied, especially among the beta blockers, carvedilol may be the most effective to use for this population.",

    "157": "The present study investigates the transduction pathway mediated by cadmium in isolated digestive gland cells of mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. The effects of cadmium treatment on a key glycolytic enzyme, pyruvate kinase (PK), and on Na(+)/H(+) exchanger activity were examined. Cadmium (50 micro mol l(-1)) caused a significant elevation of intracellular pH (pHi) and a rise (176%) of Na influx relative to control values. The amiloride analogue, EIPA (20 nmol l(-1)), a Na(+)/H(+) exchanger blocker, together with cadmium, significantly reduced the effect of treatment by cadmium alone on both Na(+) influx and pHi. In addition, PK activity was significantly increased after treatment with cadmium. PK activity was inhibited after treatment of cells with amiloride or EIPA together with cadmium. Moreover, phorbol-ester (PMA), a potent activator of protein kinase C (PKC), caused a significant rise in both pHi and PK activity, while staurosporine or calphostin C reversed both events. Adrenaline, isoprenaline and phenylephrine alone or together with cadmium also significantly increased the pHi and PK activity of isolated digestive gland cells. The latter effectors in combination with cadmium showed a synergistic effect on pHi and PK. These responses seem to be blocked by propranolol, metoprolol and prazosin. Our findings suggest a hormone-like effect of cadmium on digestive gland cells. The signal transduction pathway induced by cadmium involves the stimulation of PK, PKC and Na(+)/H(+) exchanger in isolated digestive gland cells of Mytilus galloprovincialis.",

We examined whether thyroid hormone-induced changes in uncoupling protein (UCP)-3 mRNA expression are related to directs effects of T3 or reflect secondary effects of the hormone through stimulation of renin-angiotensin or beta-adrenergic systems. Hyperthyroidism was produced by three injections of 100 microg T3/100 g body weight on alternate days with or without concomitant treatment with either captopril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor), propranolol (a beta-blocker) or clenbuterol (a beta2-agonist). The relative abundance of UCP-3 mRNA was measured in ventricular myocardium and skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius and soleus). T3 resulted in a significant increase in the relative abundance of UCP-3 in heart and skeletal muscle (p < 0.05), and the effect was not altered by captopril or propanolol; the inhibitors alone had no effect of UCP-3 mRNA content. There was no synergistic or additive effect of T3 and clenbuterol on UCP-3 mRNA expression in skeletal muscle. Increased UCP-3 mRNA levels were associated with increased UCP-3 protein expression in skeletal muscle. We conclude that the effect of T3 on UCP-3 expression in cardiac and skeletal muscle is not dependent on either angiotensin II or the beta-adrenergic system and probably reflects a direct action of the hormone on UCP-3 gene expression.", 
    "159": "In a companion paper, we describe the influence of the concentration and the nature of salts dissolved in the mobile phase (methanol:water, 40:60, v/v) on the adsorption behavior of propranolol (R'-NH2+ -R, Cl-) on XTerra-C18. The same experiments were repeated on a Symmetry-C18 column to compare the adsorption mechanisms of this ionic compound on these two very different RPLC systems. Frontal analysis (FA) measurements were first carried out to determine the best isotherm model accounting for the adsorption behavior of propranolol hydrochloride on Symmetry with a mobile phase without salt (and only 25% methanol to compensate for the low retention in the absence of salt). The adsorption data were best modeled by the bi-Moreau model. Large concentration band profiles of propranolol were recorded with mobile phases having increasing KCl concentrations (0, 0.002, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 M) and the best values of the isotherm coefficients were determined by the inverse method (IM) of chromatography. The general effect of a dissociated salt in the mobile phase was the same as the one observed earlier with XTerra-C18. Increasing the salt concentration increases the two saturation capacities of the adsorbent and the adsorption constant on the low-energy sites. The adsorption constant on the high-energy sites decreases and the adsorbate-adsorbate interactions tend to vanish with increasing salt concentration of the mobile phase. The saturation capacities decrease with increasing radius of the monovalent cation (Na+, K+, Cs+, etc.). Using sulfate as a bivalent anion (Na2SO4) affects markedly the adsorption equilibrium: the saturation capacities are drastically reduced, the high-energy sites nearly disappear while the adsorption constant and the adsorbate-adsorbate interactions on the low-energy sites increase strongly. The complexity of the thermodynamics in solution might explain the different influences of these salts on the adsorption behavior.", 
    "160": "A young patient presented with a cardiomegaly of unknown origin. The cardiologic examination revealed a severe eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy and a dilatation of the other heart cavities as well as a strongly impaired global systolic function. The patient was treated with an ACE inhibitor, a diuretic and with a beta-blocking agent. The dosages of which were adapted accordingly to the plasma concentration of N-terminal-pro-brain-natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). After five months of treatment, a decrease of the NT-proBNP level to nearly normal values along with a significant reduction of the heart dimensions and a substantial improvement of left ventricular function were found.", 
    "161": "The aortic root dilatation and its dissection are the most catastrophic events in pregnancy with Marfan syndrome as has been reported. It has been shown that prophylactic beta-adrenergic blocker is effective in reducing the aortic distensibility. However, its fetal toxicity should be considered. It includes hypoglycemia, neonatal apnea and bradycardia. Landiolol hydrochloride is a new beta-adrenergic blocker of which greatest advantages are its short duration of action, rapid clearance and high beta 1-selectivity. This drug has not been evaluated in its maternal and fetal effects on human pregnancy. We report a case of Marfan syndrome complicated with 49 mm annuloaortic ectasia. She received landiolol for the prevention of aggravated aortic root dilatation during cesarean section. After the administration of spinal anesthesia, she was treated with landiolol by continuous infusion at a rate of 0.003 to 0.005 mg.kg-1.min-1 until delivery of 1764 g infant with Apgar scores of 5 (1 min) and 8 (5 min). We could maintain maternal hemodynamics stable and good post cesarean uterus contraction. No severe adverse effects were observed in the infant. In conclusion, it is useful for maintaining the hemodynamics stable in a pregnant woman with Marfan syndrome and keep the infant safe from any adverse effects by infusing of landiolol.", 
    "162": "The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that inhibition of inflammation contributes to the protective effects of atenolol on the organ damage induced by sinoaortic denervation (SAD) in rats. SAD was performed in male Sprague-Dawley rats at the age of 10 weeks. Atenolol (20 mg/kg/d, po) was administered for 12 weeks beginning from 4 weeks after SAD. Organ damage evaluation and the determination of plasma TXB2, serum IL-1, TNF-alpha and tissue reactive oxygen species (ROS) were performed at 16 weeks after SAD. It was found that there existed obvious organ damage including increased cardiac and aortic collagen, and glomerular injury, in SAD rats. Plasma TXB2, serum TNF-alpha IL-1, and tissue ROS increased significantly after SAD. Long-term treatment with atenolol significantly prevented the organ damage with a decrease in left ventricular weight, cardiac and aortic collagen contents, and glomerular injury score in SAD rats. Plasma TXB2, serum IL-1, and tissue ROS were found to be significantly decreased by the long-term treatment with atenolol. Furthermore, it was found that the levels of inflammation-related factors were significantly related to all the organ-damage parameters studied in this experiment. These results suggest that inhibition of inflammation and oxygen stress contributes to the organ-protective effects of atenolol in SAD rats.", 
    "163": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease. We examined the effect of carvedilol, a cardiovascular drug, on basal and stimulated ACE production in human endothelial cells. Carvedilol (0.625-5 microM), in a concentration-dependent manner, inhibited basal and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, 0.5 nM) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 10 nM) induced ACE up-regulation. Carvedilol has non-selective beta-adrenoceptor and selective alpha1-adrenoceptor blocking activity, calcium channel blocking, and anti-oxidant activity. To study whether these activities were related to ACE down-regulation, endothelial cells were treated with metoprolol (1-10 microM), propranolol (1-10 microM), prazosin (1-5 microM), nicardipine (1-10 microM), probucol (1-100 microM), or ascorbic acid (1-100 microM). None of these compounds modified ACE. VEGF (0.5 nM) and PMA (10 nM) induced PKC phosphorylation, which was inhibited by co-treatment of cell cultures with carvedilol (5 microM). In conclusion, carvedilol inhibited basal and VEGF or PMA induced ACE up-regulation. Inhibition of PKC phosphorylation was probably involved in carvedilol action.", 
    "164": "Several randomized clinical trials have been designed to evaluate the usefulness of prophylactic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy. In 2 trials, CAT and AMIOVIRT, no survival benefit was reported for patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and prophylactic ICD therapy. The major limitation of both trials is the small sample size of 104 patients in CAT and 103 patients in AMIOVIRT. Another limitation of both trials is the lack of a run-in phase on optimized medical therapy. Since LV function may improve considerably on optimized medical therapy, LV function should be reevaluated 3 to 4 months after initiation of ACE inhibitors, ss-blockers and aldosterone antagonists before prophylactic ICD therapy is considered. Two additional trials, DEFINITE and SCD-HEFT, are still ongoing. Particularly SCD-HEFT will follow a sufficient number of patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy to give a more definitive answer with regard to the clinical usefulness of prophylactic ICDs in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Recently, the Marburg Cardiomyopathy study (MACAS) was finished. The results of MACAS strongly suggest that reduced LV ejection fraction is the most important arrhythmia risk predictor in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, whereas signal-averaged ECG, baroreflex sensitivity, heart rate variability and T wave alternans do not appear to be helpful for arrhythmia risk stratification. In addition, MACAS showed that total mortality in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and an ejection fraction <30% is only about 5% per year on optimized medical therapy after exclusion of patients with end stage heart failure and after exclusion of patients with sustained ventricular arrhythmias. Thus, any future study designed to demonstrate a mortality benefit by prophylactic ICD therapy with an 80% power in this patient population needs to enroll more than 1000 patients.", 
    "165": "In acute ischaemia, glucose-insulin-potassium administration reduces mortality and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists have favourable effects on the outcome of ischaemic heart disease. The present study was designed to investigate whether insulin (1.4x10(-7) M) and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol (10(-5) M), increase hypoxic vasodilation in correspondence with changes in glycolysis. Porcine coronary arteries, precontracted with 10(-5) M prostaglandin F(2alpha), were mounted in a pressure myograph and a microdialysis catheter was inserted in the tunica media. Hypoxic vasodilation, interstitial lactate/pyruvate ratio and interstitial glucose were measured at low (2 mM) and high (20 mM) glucose concentrations. Hypoxia (60 min) caused vasodilation and doubled the lactate/pyruvate ratio. Treatment with insulin quadrupled the lactate/pyruvate ratio during hypoxia, but did not change hypoxic vasodilation. Propranolol blocked isoprenaline-evoked vasodilation, but hypoxic increases in lactate/pyruvate ratio and vasodilation did not change. The combination of insulin and propranolol did not cause further changes compared with each drug added alone, although the combination increased vasoconstriction during reoxygenation. Interstitial glucose fell during hypoxia at an organ bath glucose concentration of 2 mM, and rose at a glucose concentration of 20 mM. Addition of insulin and propranolol alone or in combination had no effect on interstitial glucose concentration. Accordingly, arteries were found to contain only minute amounts of the glucose transporter isoform GLUT4. Our findings suggest that insulin increases arterial glycolysis, but treatment with insulin, propranolol, or both, is not associated with enhanced coronary vasodilation during hypoxia.", 
    "166": "Cost consequences of antihypertensive drug pricing were compared in the United States and Sweden. Because of price differences, US drug acquisition costs to prevent one cardiovascular event were 339%, 127%, and 22% higher using the most prescribed calcium channel blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and beta blocker, but 65% lower with hydrochlorothiazide. As thiazides are as effective as, but cheaper than, the alternatives, the costs of effective antihypertensive drug treatment may be pronouncedly reduced in both countries. This emphasizes not only the importance of drug pricing but also the cost-increasing influence of commercial marketing. More producer-independent and evidence-based drug information to prescribers is necessary.",

    "168": "Fifteen samples of autoantibodies against beta(1)-adrenoceptor positive sera of patients with hepatitis virus myocarditis were obtained and IgGs were purified by octanoic acid extraction. Binding of autoantibodies against beta(1)-adrenoceptor to guinea pig cardiac myocytes was examined by immunofluorescence. Using the patch clamp technique, the effects on the action potential and I(Ca-L) of guinea pig cardiac myocytes caused by autoantibodies against beta(1)-adrenoceptor in the absence and presence of metoprolol were investigated. Cell toxicity was examined by observing cell morphology and permeability of cardiac myocytes to trypan blue.", 
    "169": "The specific binding of autoantibodies against beta(1)-adrenoceptor to guinea pig cardiomyocytes was observed. Autoantibodies against beta(1)-adrenoceptor diluted at 1:80 prolonged APD(20), APD(50) and APD(90) by 39.2%, 29.1% and 15.2% respectively, and only by 7.2%, 5.3% and 4.1% correspondingly in the presence of 1 micromol/L metoprolol. Autoantibodies against beta(1)-adrenoceptor diluted at 1:80, 1:100 and 1:120 significantly increased the I(Ca-L) peak current amplitude at 0 mV by 55.87+/-4.39%, 46.33+/-5.01% and 29.29+/-4.97% in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, after blocking of beta(1)-adrenoceptors (1 micromol/L metoprolol), autoantibodies against beta(1)-adrenoceptor diluted at 1:80 induced a slight increase of I(Ca-L) peak amplitude only by 6.81+/-1.61%. A large number of cardiac myocytes exposed to high concentrations of autoantibodies against beta(1)-adrenoceptor (1:80 and 1:100) were turned into rounded cells highly permeable to trypan blue.",

    "171": "The clinical effects of treatment with beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) agonists and antagonists in heart failure vary with duration of therapy, as do the effects of beta-AR agonists in asthma. Therefore, we hypothesized that chronic effects of \"beta-blockers\" in asthma may differ from those observed acutely. We tested this hypothesis in an antigen (ovalbumin)-driven murine model of asthma. Airway resistance responses (Raw) to the muscarinic agonist methacholine were measured by using the forced oscillation technique. In comparison with nontreated asthmatic mice, we observed that: (i) The beta-AR antagonists nadolol or carvedilol, given as a single i.v. injection (acute treatment) 15 min before methacholine, increased methacholine-elicited peak Raw values by 33.7% and 67.7% (P < 0.05), respectively; when either drug was administered for 28 days (chronic treatment), the peak Raw values were decreased by 43% (P < 0.05) and 22.9% (P < 0.05), respectively. (ii) Chronic treatment with nadolol or carvedilol significantly increased beta-AR densities in lung membranes by 719% and 828%, respectively. (iii) Alprenolol, a beta-blocker with partial agonist properties at beta-ARs, behaved as a beta-AR agonist, and acutely reduced peak Raw value by 75.7% (P < 0.05); chronically, it did not alter Raw. (iv) Salbutamol, a beta-AR partial agonist, acutely decreased peak Raw by 41.1%; chronically, it did not alter Raw. (v) None of the beta-blockers produced significant changes in eosinophil number recovered in bronchoalveolar lavage. These results suggest that beta-AR agonists and beta-blockers with inverse agonist properties may exert reciprocating effects on cellular signaling dependent on duration of administration.", 
    "172": "We assessed the feasibility of home-based telecardiology for patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). Seventy-four CHF patients were enrolled into a programme of telephone follow-up and single-lead electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring. The patients transmitted their ECG data by fixed telephone line to a receiving station, where a nurse was available for an interactive teleconsultation. Patients were followed up for a mean (SD) of 307 (108) days; 1467 calls were analysed (213 ad hoc consultations and 1254 scheduled consultations). A total of 124 cardiovascular events were recorded. Modifications to therapy were suggested in response to 119 calls; hospital admissions were suggested for 13 patients, further investigations for 7 and a consultation with the patient's general practitioner for 13. No action was taken after 1330 calls. Twenty-two ECG abnormalities were recorded. In 63 patients receiving the beta-blocker carvedilol, the mean dosage increased from 36 to 42 mg. In the previous year there were 1.8 hospitalizations per patient, while in the follow-up period there were 0.2 hospitalizations per patient. Following up CHF patients using a nurse-led telecardiology programme seems to be feasible and useful.",

No further cases of white deposition have occurred after warning surgeons of the risk associated with certain topical therapy combinations. The risk of brown staining may be difficult to remove completely as it appears that environmental exposure to chemicals may cause deposition in addition to personal smoking habits and topical medications.",

    "181": "A new rapid and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method has been developed for the simultaneous identification and quantification in human plasma of the 13 most commonly prescribed beta-blockers and one active metabolite-atenolol, sotalol, diacetolol, carteolol, nadolol, pindolol, acebutolol, metoprolol, celiprolol, oxprenolol, labetalol, propranolol, tertatolol and betaxolol. It involves liquid-liquid extraction procedures followed by liquid chromatography coupled to photodiode-array UV detection with a fixed wavelength at 220 nm for quantification. Compounds were separated on a 5 microm Hypurity C(18) (ThermoHypersil) analytical column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, i.d.) using a gradient of acetonitrile-phosphate buffer pH 3.8 at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The total analysis time was 26 min per sample. Extraction recoveries were between 74 and 113% for the polar compounds and between 20 and 56% for the most apolar compounds. Calibration lines were linear in the range from 25 to 1000 ng/ml for all compounds excepted carteolol and nadolol (50-1000 ng/ml), all of them with coefficients of determination (r2 values) >/=0.994. Limits of detection (LODs) ranged from 5 to 10 ng/ml. Intra-assay and inter-assay precision and accuracy were studied at two concentration levels (100 and 500 ng/ml). The intra-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) for all compounds were </= 8.3% and all inter-assays CVs were below 12.6%. The intra-assay and inter-assay accuracies for all compounds were found to be within 91.4 and 105.6% at 100 ng/ml and within 94.1 and 107.4% at 500 ng/ml.

    "190": "A role for norepinephrine in learning and memory has been elusive and controversial. A longstanding hypothesis states that the adrenergic nervous system mediates enhanced memory consolidation of emotional events. We tested this hypothesis in several learning tasks using mutant mice conditionally lacking norepinephrine and epinephrine, as well as control mice and rats treated with adrenergic receptor agonists and antagonists. We find that adrenergic signaling is critical for the retrieval of intermediate-term contextual and spatial memories, but is not necessary for the retrieval or consolidation of emotional memories in general. The role of norepinephrine in retrieval requires signaling through the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor in the hippocampus. The results demonstrate that mechanisms of memory retrieval can vary over time and can be different from those required for acquisition or consolidation. These findings may be relevant to symptoms in several neuropsychiatric disorders as well as the treatment of cardiac failure with beta blockers.",

However, translating this information to clinical practice continues to be a challenge and requires a multi- disciplinary approach. A particular intraoperative anesthetic technique is unlikely to influence perioperative cardiac morbidity and mortality.

The existence of a hormonal control of osteoblast activity has been speculated for years by analogy to osteoclast biology. Through the search for such humoral signal(s) regulating bone formation, leptin has been identified as a powerful inhibitor of bone formation. Furthermore, by means of intracerebroventricular infusion of leptin, it has been shown that the effect of this adipocyte-derived hormone on bone is mediated via a brain relay, like all its other functions. Subsequent studies have led to the identification of hypothalamic neurons involved in leptin's antiosteogenic function. In addition, it has been shown that those neurons or neuronal pathways are distinct from neurons responsible for the regulation of energy metabolism. Finally, the peripheral mediator of leptin's antiosteogenic function has been identified as being the sympathetic nervous system. Catecholamine-deficient mice have a high bone mass and sympathomimetics administered to mice decreased bone formation and bone mass. Conversely, beta-blockers increased bone formation and bone mass and blunt the bone loss induced by ovariectomy."
