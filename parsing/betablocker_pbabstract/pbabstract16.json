Firstly, AntarisII Fourier-transform near infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy and Micro NIR1700 Spectrometer were used to collect spectral data of 66 batches of samples which come from four different manufacturers, then 44 samples of calibration set and 22 samples of validation set were acquired by random sampling. In order to build up a PLS-DA model, the first derivative with Savitzky-Golay 15 points smoothing (1d+SG15) and standard normal vitiate transformation (SNV) was selected as the pretreatment method and according to the variation between different samples and the characteristic absorption band, 6 468-7 104 cm(-1) and 6 468-7 156 cm(-1) were chosen as the modeling spectra region. The confusion matrix indicated that Metoprolol Tartrate tablets could be rapidly and effectively identified by two analytical models, which were established using the spectral data collected from two instruments. For these two models, both of the sensitivity and specificity were 100%. This study confirmed that it is feasible to carry out the manufacturer identification of Metoprolol Tartrate tablets by near infrared spectroscopy. Besides, the use of Micro NIR1700 Spectrometer, which is the minimum and portable near infrared spectrometer, provides valuable insights for fast on-site drug screening.",

    "5": "Relapse to drug use is often cited as the major obstacle in overcoming a drug addiction. Whereas relapse can occur for a myriad of reasons, it is well established that complex neuroadaptations that occur over the course of addiction are major factors. Cocaine, as a potent dopamine transporter blocker, specifically induces alterations in the dopaminergic as well as other monoaminergic neurotransmissions, which lead to cocaine abuse and dependence. Evidence also suggests that adaptations in the endogenous opioids play important roles in pathophysiology of cocaine addiction. Following this evidence, we investigated a combination medication, levo-tetrahydropalmatine (l-THP) and low dose naltrexone (LDN), targeting primarily dopaminergic and endogenous opioid systems as a cocaine-relapse-prevention treatment. In the present study Wistar rats were used to assess the effects ofl-THP and LDN on cocaine self-administration, drug-seeking behavior during cocaine reinstatement, spontaneous locomotion, and effects on the endogenous opioid system. We determined that the combination ofl-THP and LDN reduces drug-seeking behavior during reinstatement more potently thanl-THP alone. Additionally, the combination ofl-THP and LDN attenuates the sedative locomotor effect induced byl-THP. Furthermore, we revealed that treatment with the combination ofl-THP and LDN has an upregulatory effect on both plasma\u03b2-endorphin and hypothalamic POMC that was not observed inl-THP-treated groups. These results suggest that the combination ofl-THP and LDN has great potential as an effective and well-tolerated medication for cocaine relapse prevention.",

To that end, the presence of CBS and CSE in the jejunum epithelium was assessed by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting and the methylene blue assay. In addition, in vivo L-Cys (100 mg/kg, administered immediately after the glucose load) significantly increased blood glucose levels 30 min after the oral administration of glucose to mice. This effect of L-Cys was completely blocked by amino-oxyacetic acid (AOA; 50 mg/kg; administered at the same time as L-Cys) an inhibitor of CBS. Measurements of the short-circuit current (Isc) in the rat jejunum epithelium revealed that L-Cys (1 mmol/L; 6 min before the administration of L-alanine) enhances Na(+)-coupled L-alanine or glucose transport, and that this effect is inhibited by AOA (1 mmol/L;10 min before the administration of L-Cys), but not D,L-propargylglycine (PAG;1 mmol/L; 10 min before the administration of L-Cys), a CSE inhibitor. Notably, L-Cys-evoked enhancement of nutrient transport was alleviated by glibenclamide (Gli;0.1 mmol/L; 10 min before the administration of L-Cys), a K(+) channel blocker.

We report on 2 children who late in the course of their burn injury developed ischaemic necrosis of their entire intestine. Both were on propranolol, the administration of which was continued with even during the periods of septic shock which preceded their demise. We are of the opinion that endogenous catecholamine release during hypotensive and septic episodes in conjunction with \u03b2-adrenergic blockage from propranolol could lead to severe splanchnic vasoconstriction from unopposed \u03b1-adrenergic activity and hence critical circulation impairment to the bowel in the 2 children.",

Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) is a key protein that can participate in the repair and control process responses after I/R injury. Isoflurane is widely used in neurosurgery. Previous studies have shown that isoflurane preconditioning plays an important role in neuroprotection. However, the effects of isoflurane postconditioning on cerebral I/R injury have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we evaluated the protective effect of isoflurane postconditioning against cerebral I/R injury and investigated the role of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway and the downstream c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway in neuroprotective mechanism. In particular, the JNK signaling pathway emerges as a possible target for brain repair after stroke.",

Postconditioning by inhalation of isoflurane was performed at different concentrations (1.5%, 3.0%, and 4.5%) for 1h after ischemia at the starting time point of reperfusion. The protective effect was tested by neurological deficit scoring with 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride and propidium iodide (PI) staining. Apoptosis of CA1 cells in the hippocampus was detected by TUNEL method. Expression levels of TGF-\u03b21, Smad 2/3, p-Smad2/3, JNK, and p-JNK were determined by immunostaining and Western blot.", 
    "23": "Postconditioning by isoflurane at 1.5% and 3.0% concentrations significantly decreased the neurobehavioral deficit scores and infarct volume compared with the I/R group, but no significant difference in neurobehavioral deficit score was detected between the I/R and 4.5% isoflurane postconditioning groups. Additionally, 1.5% isoflurane postconditioning decreased the numbers of PI-positive cells at 24h after reperfusion compared with the I/R group. TGF-\u03b21 and p-Smad2/3 protein gradually increased after I/R injury, with the highest values observed in the 1.5% and 3% isoflurane postconditioning groups. For Smad2/3 protein expression, no differences existed among all groups. After inducing the TGF-\u03b2/SMAD3 signaling pathway specific blocker (LY2157299), the neurological deficit scores increased, infarct volumes enlarged, apoptosis increased, and PI-positive CA1 cells in the hippocampus also increased. The expression levels of TGF-\u03b21 and p-Smad2/3 proteins were downregulated. During the pre-injection of LY2157299, the expression levels of TGF-\u03b21 and p-Smad2/3 decreased significantly, but compared with the sham group, the expression level of p-JNK significantly increased. When the injection of LY2157299 was abolished, the expression of p-JNK significantly decreased. The expression levels of p-JNK and TGF-\u03b21 significantly decreased when LY2157299 and SP600125 were injected simultaneously. However, the protective effect mediated by SP600125 completely disappeared, and the role of LY2157299 became dominant.

Chemical enhancers have been used for several decades, but their roles in drug release from patches are poorly understood. In this work, the roles of chemical enhancers in bisoprolol tartrate (BSP-T) release from patches were probed in vitro and in vivo. More importantly, an innovative mechanism insight of chemical enhancers in drug release process was provided at molecular level. FT-IR spectroscopy and molecular modeling were employed to investigate the influence of chemical enhancers on drug-adhesive interaction. The results showed chemical enhancers like Span 80, which had a strong ability forming hydrogen bonds, could decrease drug-adhesive interaction leading to the release of drug from adhesive of patches. Thermal analysis was conducted to research the influence of chemical enhancers on the thermodynamic properties of patch system. It showed that chemical enhancers promoted the formation of free volume of adhesive, which facilitated drug release process. By contrast, the influence on the thermodynamic properties of BSP-T was less effective in influencing BSP-T release process. In conclusion, chemical enhancers played an important role in facilitating BSP-T release from the adhesive DURO-TAK\u00ae 87-2287 of patches by decreasing drug-adhesive interaction and promoting the formation of free volume of adhesive. This work may be an important step in understanding the important roles of chemical enhancers in drug release process.",

Here we analyzed the effect of pharmaceuticals on the photosynthesis of microalgae commonly found in freshwater-two species of Chlorophyceae and a member of the Eustigmatophyceae, via PAM fluorometry. As pharmaceuticals, three medicines often consumed in households were chosen: (i) fluoxetine, an antidepressant, (ii) propranolol, a \u03b2-blocker and (iii) ibuprofen, an anti-inflammatory and analgesic medicine. The EC50 for the quantum yield of photosystem II in phytoplankton acclimated to inorganic phosphorus (Pi)-replete and Pi-limited conditions was estimated. Acute toxicity experiments over a 5\u00a0h exposure revealed that Nannochloropsis limnetica was the least sensitive to pharmaceuticals in its photosynthetic yield out of all species tested. Although the estimation of sub-lethal effects can be vital in contrast to that of LC50s, the EC50 values in all species and for all medicines were orders of magnitude higher than concentrations found in polluted surface water. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was the most sensitive to fluoxetine (EC50 of 1.6\u00a0mg\u00a0L(-1)), and propranolol (EC50 of 3\u00a0mg\u00a0L(-1)). Acutodesmus obliquus was most sensitive to ibuprofen (EC50 of 288\u00a0mg\u00a0L(-1)). Additionally, the sensitivity to the pharmaceuticals changed under a Pi-limitation; the green algae became less sensitive to fluoxetine and propranolol.

Two small studies reported differing findings for the sensitivity of ultrasound and effectiveness of imaging modalities. Studies of steroids assessed different agents; treated children typically had improvement in lesion size. Steroid harms frequently included Cushingoid facies, irritability/mood changes, and growth retardation. Beta-blockers typically demonstrated significantly greater effects on reducing lesion size than did control or other active comparators. In network meta-analysis, oral propranolol had the largest mean estimate of expected clearance (95%; 95% Bayesian credible interval [BCI]: 88% to 99%) relative to oral corticosteroids (43%, 95% BCI: 21%\u201366%) and control (6%, 95% BCI: 1%\u201311%). Beta-blocker harms included hypotension, hypoglycemia, bradycardia, sleep disturbances, and cold extremities. Surgical intervention studies primarily addressed variations of pulse dye laser (PDL) to manage IH size. Most studies reported a higher success rate with longer-pulse PDL compared to observation, with differing magnitude of effect. Laser treatment harms included hypopigmentation and scarring. No studies explicitly evaluated treatments following failure of beta-blockers or corticosteroids. Literature addressing contextual questions suggested that referral indications include large size; segmental type; risk for complications including bleeding, ulceration, and pain; involvement of critical structures; risk factors for occult lesions (numerous cutaneous lesions, beard distribution); and potential for psychosocial concerns in some cases.

Corticosteroids demonstrated moderate effectiveness at reducing IH size/volume (moderate SOE for improvement in IH with oral steroids compared with observation/placebo; low SOE for intralesional steroids versus observation/placebo; moderate SOE for association with clinically important harms). Propranolol had high SOE for effects on reducing lesion size compared with observation/placebo. Clearance of IH was greater in propranolol arms compared with placebo/observation and active comparators in most studies. Meta-analysis indicated high mean rates of IH clearance with oral propranolol (95%, 95% BCI: 88%\u201399%) and moderate rates for steroids (43% to 58%, with wide BCI; moderate SOE for effects of propranolol compared with steroids). Beta-blockers and steroids also may cause clinically important harms (moderate SOE for association of oral propranolol with harms). Laser studies generally found PDL more effective than other lasers, but effects remain unclear (insufficient to low SOE for effects of laser types on IH clearance; moderate SOE for association of PDL with skin pigmentation changes; low SOE for association with pain).

Several randomized controlled trials have consistently demonstrated the efficacy of intraocular pressure lowering to slow or halt the measurable progression of the disease. Medical therapy, in places where it is easily accessible, is often the primary method to lower intraocular pressure. We review the medical options currently available and possible future options currently in development. The 5 contemporary classes of topical agents in use include prostaglandin analogs, beta blockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, alpha agonists, and cholinergics. In addition, several fixed combination agents are commercially available. Agents from each of these classes have unique mechanisms of action, adverse effects, and other characteristics that impact how they are used in clinical practice. Despite the plethora of medical options available, there are limitations to topical ophthalmic therapy such as the high rate of noncompliance and local and systemic adverse effects. Alternate and sustained drug delivery models, such as injectable agents and punctal plug delivery systems, may in the future alleviate some such concerns and lead to increased efficacy of treatment while minimizing adverse effects.",

Our objective was to understand the use of GDMT in outpatients with HFrEF in India. The Practice Innovation And Clinical Excellence (PINNACLE) India Quality Improvement Program (PIQIP) is a registry for cardiovascular quality improvement in India supported by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.

    "69": "Telmisartan, one unique angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, has been attracting attention due to its putative peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-\u03b3 or \u03b2/\u03b4 actions. Recently, telmisartan has been reported to exert neuroprotective effects in animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully clarified. Recently, accumulating evidence has shown that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress plays a crucial role in rotenone-induced neuronal apoptosis. Additionally, studies have revealed that inositol-requiring enzyme/endonuclease 1\u03b1 (IRE1\u03b1) is necessary and sufficient to trigger ER stress. In the present study, we aimed to determine whether ER stress-activated IRE1\u03b1-mediated apoptotic pathway is involved in the neuroprotection of telmisartan in the rotenone rats of PD and explore the possible involvement of PPAR-\u03b2/\u03b4 activation. The catalepsy tests were performed to test the catalepsy symptom. The dopamine content and \u03b1-synuclein expression were ascertained through high-performance liquid chromatography and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The expression of IRE1\u03b1, TNF receptor associated factor 2 (TRAF2), caspase-12 and PPAR-\u03b2/\u03b4 was detected by western blot. Neuronal apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL and immunohistochemistry. Our results show that telmisartan ameliorated the catalepsy symptom and attenuated dopamine depletion as well as \u03b1-synuclein accumulation. Moreover, telmisartan decreased ER stress-mediated neuronal apoptosis. Furthermore, telmisartan inhibited IRE1\u03b1-TRAF2-caspase-12 apoptotic signaling pathway. Additionally, telmisartan activated PPAR \u03b2/\u03b4, implying that PPAR-\u03b2/\u03b4 activation properties of telmisartan are possibly or partially involved in the neuroprotective effects. In conclusion, our findings suggest that suppressing ER stress-activated IRE1\u03b1-TRAF2-caspase-12 apoptotic pathway is involved in the neuroprotective effects of telmisartan in the rotenone rats of PD.",

    "100": "Wave intensity analysis provides detailed insights into factors influencing hemodynamics. However, wave intensity is not a conserved quantity, so it is sensitive to diameter variations and is not distributed among branches of a junction. Moreover, the fundamental relation between waves and hydraulic power is unclear. We, therefore, propose an alternative to wave intensity called \"wave power,\" calculated via incremental changes in pressure and flow (dPdQ) and a novel time-domain separation of hydraulic pressure power and kinetic power into forward and backward wave-related components (\u03a0P\u00b1and \u03a0Q\u00b1). Wave power has several useful properties:1) it is obtained directly from flow measurements, without requiring further calculation of velocity;2) it is a quasi-conserved quantity that may be used to study the relative distribution of waves at junctions; and3) it has the units of power (Watts). We also uncover a simple relationship between wave power and changes in \u03a0P\u00b1and show that wave reflection reduces transmitted power. Absolute values of \u03a0P\u00b1represent wave potential, a recently introduced concept that unifies steady and pulsatile aspects of hemodynamics. We show that wave potential represents the hydraulic energy potential stored in a compliant pressurized vessel, with spatial gradients producing waves that transfer this energy. These techniques and principles are verified numerically and also experimentally with pressure/flow measurements in all branches of a central bifurcation in sheep, under a wide range of hemodynamic conditions. The proposed \"wave power analysis,\" encompassing wave power, wave potential, and wave separation of hydraulic power provides a potent time-domain approach for analyzing hemodynamics.",

The activities of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 were measured using specific probe drugs. After pretreatment for 1 week with evodiamine or physiological saline (control group) by oral administration, probe drugs phenacetin (5.0 mg/kg; CYP1A2 activity), tolbutamide (1.0 mg/kg; CYP2C9 activity), omeprazole (10 mg/kg; CYP2C19 activity), metoprolol (20 mg/kg; CYP2D6 activity) and midazolam (10 mg/kg; CYP3A4 activity) were administered to rats by oral administration.

TCM is characterized by left- or biventricular apical ballooning with a clinical presentation, electrocardiographic abnormalities, and biomarker profils similar to those seen in acute myocardial infarction. Epidemiological studies have shown that TCM is more common in postmenopausal women; however exact figures are not available. The underlying aetiology is still largely undetermined. Elevated catecholamine levels, lack of estrogen, disturbed myocardial fatty acid metabolism and plaque rupture with spontaneous thrombolysis are potentially discussed mechanisms responsible for inducing a prolonged stunned myocardium. Strong emotional or physical stress is the most frequently described trigger in the literature. Therapy recommendations include appropriate antiplatelet treatment, \u03b2-blockers and ACE inhibitors.

    "131": "Type 2 diabetes is characterized by peripheral insulin resistance and pancreatic beta cell dysfunction. Elevated free fatty acids (FFAs) may impair beta cell function and mass (lipotoxicity). Altered calcium homeostasis may be involved in defective insulin release. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the major intracellular calcium store. Lipotoxicity induces ER stress and in parallel an ER calcium depletion through unknown ER calcium leak channels. The main purposes of this study is first to identify one of these channels and secondly, to check the opportunity to restore beta cells function (i.e., insulin secretion) after pharmacological inhibition of ER calcium store depletion. We investigated the functionality of translocon, an ER calcium leak channel and its involvement on FFAs-induced alterations in MIN6B1 cells and in human pancreatic islets. We evidenced that translocon acts as a functional ER calcium leak channel in human beta cells using anisomycin and puromycin (antibiotics), respectively blocker and opener of this channel. Puromycin induced a significant ER calcium release, inhibited by anisomycin pretreatment. Palmitate treatment was used as FFA model to induce a mild lipotoxic effect: ER calcium content was reduced, ER stress but not apoptosis were induced and glucose induced insulin secretion was decreased in our beta cells. Interestingly, translocon inhibition by chronic anisomycin treatment prevented dysfunctions induced by palmitate, avoiding reticular calcium depletion, ER stress and restoring insulin secretion. Our results provide for the first time compelling evidence that translocon actively participates to the palmitate-induced ER calcium leak and insulin secretion decrease in beta cells. Its inhibition reduces these lipotoxic effects. Taken together, our data indicate that TLC may be a new potential target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.",

Right atrial appendage (RAA) samples were collected from 45 patients who were receiving perioperative BB treatment, and underwent CABG surgery. The isolated RNA samples were used for microarray gene expression analysis, to identify probes that were expressed differently in patients with and without postoperative AF. Gene expression analysis was performed to identify probes that were expressed differently in patients with and without postoperative AF. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to determine how sets of genes might be systematically altered in patients with postoperative AF. Of the 45 patients studied, genomic DNA from 42 patients was used for target sequencing of 66 candidate genes potentially associated with AF, and 2,144 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified. We then performed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis to determine the correlation between SNPs identified in the genotyped patients, and RAA expression. Probes that met a false discovery rate<0.25 were selected for eQTL analysis. Of the 17,678 gene expression probes analyzed, 2 probes met our prespecified significance threshold of false discovery rate<0.25. The most significant probe corresponded to vesicular overexpressed in cancer - prosurvival protein 1 gene (VOPP1; 1.83 fold change; P=3.47\u00d710(-7)), and was up-regulated in patients with postoperative AF, whereas the second most significant probe, which corresponded to the LOC389286 gene (0.49 fold change; P=1.54\u00d710(-5)), was down-regulated in patients with postoperative AF. GSEA highlighted the role of VOPP1 in pathways with biologic relevance to myocardial homeostasis, and oxidative stress and redox modulation. Candidate gene eQTL showed a trans-acting association between variants of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 gene, previously linked to altered BB response, and high expression of VOPP1. In patients undergoing CABG surgery, RAA gene expression profiling, and pathway and eQTL analysis suggested that VOPP1 plays a novel etiological role in postoperative AF despite perioperative BB therapy.",

Contact lenses are ideally suited for controlled drug delivery to cornea, but incorporation of any drug loaded particulate system (formulation) affect the optical and physical property of contact lenses. The objective of the present work was to implant timolol maleate (TM) loaded ethyl cellulose nanoparticle-laden ring in hydrogel contact lenses that could provide controlled drug delivery at therapeutic rates without compromising critical lens properties. TM-implant lenses were developed, by dispersing TM encapsulated ethyl cellulose nanoparticles in acrylate hydrogel (fabricated as ring implant) and implanted the same in hydrogel contact lenses (sandwich system). The TM-ethyl cellulose nanoparticles were prepared by double emulsion method at different ratios of TM to ethyl cellulose. The X-ray diffraction studies revealed the transformation of TM to amorphous state. In vitro release kinetic data showed sustained drug release within the therapeutic window for 168h (NP 1:3 batch) with 150\u03bcg loading. Cytotoxicity and ocular irritation study demonstrated the safety of TM-implant contact lenses. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies in rabbit tear fluid showed significant increase in mean residence time (MRT) and area under curve (AUC), with TM-implant contact lenses in comparison to eye drop therapy. In vivo pharmacodynamic data in rabbit model showed sustained reduction in intra ocular pressure for 192h.

As the ionic liquid is covalently attached to graphene oxide sheets, it is made possible for it to participate in the dispersive micro SPE procedure. The limits of detection and limits of quantification of the proposed method were found to be in the range of 7-23ng/L and between 20 and 70ng/L, respectively. The linearity was satisfactory, with the determination coefficients to range from 0.9940 to 0.9998 while the within- and between-day relative standard deviation of the method ranged between 3.1 and 7.6% and from 4.0 to 8.5%, respectively. In order to test the applicability of the proposed method in real-life samples, the effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant as well as natural water samples from two rivers and a lake were collected and analyzed. After the analysis of samples, the effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plant was fortified with the analytes, at concentrations equal to 2 and 10 times the LOQs. Recoveries were calculated after subtracting the native (no-spike) concentrations of analytes, when needed. All the recoveries were in the range of 87-98%.

N(\u03c9) -nitro-l-arginine (l-NA; 10(-4) mol/L), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, and ODQ (10(-4) mol/L), a guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, increased the H2 S-induced relaxation. Zaprinast (5 \u00d7 10(-6) mol/L) and sildenafil (10(-6) mol/L), phosphodiesterase inhibitors, inhibited H2 S-induced relaxation. Adenylyl cyclase inhibitors N-ethylmaleimide (2.5 \u00d7 10(-5) mol/L) and SQ22536 (10(-4) mol/L) reduced relaxation to H2 S.

In the first experiment rats were intravenously pretreated with vehicle (V), atenolol 30 mg/kg (ATE, \u03b21-adrenergic antagonist), or butoxamine 25 mg/kg (BUT, \u03b22-adrenergic antagonist).

The groups were intravenously treated with saline (S), 240 \u00b5mol/kg Dp, AA, or At, 15 min after pretreatment with the antagonists or V and nine days after surgery. GE was determined 10 min later by measuring the percentage of gastric retention (%GR) of saline labeled with phenol red 10 min after gavage.

    "179": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are physiologically important transmembrane signalling proteins that trigger intracellular responses upon binding of extracellular ligands. Despite recent breakthroughs in GPCR crystallography, the details of ligand-induced signal transduction are not well understood owing to missing dynamical information. In principle, such information can be provided by NMR, but so far only limited data of functional relevance on few side-chain sites of eukaryotic GPCRs have been obtained. Here we show that receptor motions can be followed at virtually any backbone site in a thermostabilized mutant of the turkey \u03b21-adrenergic receptor (\u03b21AR). Labelling with [(15)N]valine in a eukaryotic expression system provides over twenty resolved resonances that report on structure and dynamics in six ligand complexes and the apo form. The response to the various ligands is heterogeneous in the vicinity of the binding pocket, but gets transformed into a homogeneous readout at the intracellular side of helix 5 (TM5), which correlates linearly with ligand efficacy for the G protein pathway. The effect of several pertinent, thermostabilizing point mutations was assessed by reverting them to the native sequence. Whereas the response to ligands remains largely unchanged, binding of the G protein mimetic nanobody NB80 and G protein activation are only observed when two conserved tyrosines (Y227 and Y343) are restored. Binding of NB80 leads to very strong spectral changes throughout the receptor, including the extracellular ligand entrance pocket. This indicates that even the fully thermostabilized receptor undergoes activating motions in TM5, but that the fully active state is only reached in presence of Y227 and Y343 by stabilization with a G protein-like partner. The combined analysis of chemical shift changes from the point mutations and ligand responses identifies crucial connections in the allosteric activation pathway, and presents a general experimental method to delineate signal transmission networks at high resolution in GPCRs.",

Using this knowledge, we propose a conceptual framework on the management of patients with POAF during various phases after cardiac surgery.", 
    "196": "Perioperative \u03b2-blockade is the cornerstone in preventing POAF after cardiac surgery. Results from randomized trials do not support routine use of colchicine or corticosteroids to prevent POAF. There is no study examining the impact of rate versus rhythm control on 'hard' clinical outcomes such as mortality or stroke in the cardiac surgical population. Furthermore, there is a paucity of research on the optimal timing and choice of oral anticoagulation among POAF cardiac surgical patients who are at risk for stroke.", 
    "197": "In spite of the plethora of therapies available to treat and prevent POAF in the cardiac surgical population, there is little data to address whether they can improve key clinical outcomes such as death or stroke. Guideline recommendations on rate/rhythm control and oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention in the cardiac surgical population are largely extrapolated from studies of nonsurgical atrial fibrillation patients. Further research is needed to address these key atrial fibrillation management issues specific to the cardiac surgical population.",

Judging from the crystal structures of the 2\u2009:\u20092 complexes of EGCg and cyclo(L-Pro-Gly), cyclo(D-Pro-Gly), the difference in the chemical shift resulted mainly from a magnetic anisotropic shielding effect by the ring current from the B ring of EGCg. Therefore, it was considered that chirality of cyclo(Pro-Gly) was recognized by EGCg in the D2O solution. Furthermore, in the (1)H-NMR spectrum of a solution containing an equimolecular amount of racemic propranolol ((R)- and (S)-propranolols) and EGCg in D2O, the (1)H-NMR signal for H2 of the naphthalene group was observed as two doublets, suggesting that the racemic propranolol formed diastereomers of complexes with EGCg; as a result, chirality of propranolol was recognized by EGCg in the D2O solution.",

However, the protective effect of the combination is not well understood. In the present study, we investigated whether latanoprost/timolol in combination has an additive or synergistic cytoprotective effect on neuro retinal cells (RGC-5). To investigate the protective effects of timolol/latanoprost in combination, cultured RGC-5 were treated with various concentrations of these two agents, singly or together, after which the cells were exposed to oxidative stress, serum deprivation, or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in vitro. Cells were also treated with an Akt inhibitor, LY294002, to examine the mechanism of the protective effect. Latanoprost, timolol, and the two in combination reduced cell death induced by oxidative stress, serum deprivation, or ER stress. The latanoprost/timolol combination reduced cell death to a greater extent than monotherapy with latanoprost or timolol on serum deprivation only, and LY294002 inhibited the protective effect of their combination. These findings suggest that timolol/latanoprost in combination have a protective effect against serum deprivation only by activation of Akt signaling. Furthermore, this combination has not only an ocular hypotensive effect but also a neuroprotective effect.",

To evaluate the effect of S1P and S1P receptor blockers (W146 and FTY720) on adipocyte differentiation, cultures were exposed to each receptor blocker for the first 4 days of the differentiation period. Differentiated cells were stained with Oil Red O, and the production of peroxisome proliferator activator gamma (PPAR\u03b3) and CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBP) \u03b1 and \u03b2 were determined by Western blot analysis.",

Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 through 5 mRNA expression was significantly increased during the 10 days of adipogenesis. Sphingosine-1-phosphate treatment increased the size and number of adipocytes, and increased the expression of adipogenic transcriptional regulators. Treatment with S1P1 receptor inhibitor (W146) for 4 days after induction of adipogenesis attenuated adipocyte differentiation. Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor blocker also decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in GO orbital fibroblasts and H2O2-stimulated HO-1 production in GO orbital fibroblasts.

Hospital Patient Discharge Data and State of California Birth Certificate Data were used. Severe maternal morbidity using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria based on International Classification of Diseases-9 codes was compared between groups.

    "213": "Context Isradipine is an effective calcium channel blocker used in the management of hypertension. It undergoes extensive first pass metabolism and has low oral bioavailability. Hence we attempted to develop isradipine-loaded invasomes. Objective The purpose of this work was to prepare and characterize invasomes carrier for isradipine, and to evaluate the optimized formulation obtained for pharmacodynamic study. Materials and methods Isradipine-loaded invasomes were prepared by conventional thin layer evaporation technique using Phospholipon\u00ae 90G, \u03b2-citronellene (terpene) and ethanol. Prepared formulations were characterized in terms of size, size distribution, morphology, entrapment efficiency, and antihypertensive activity. Results and discussion It was observed that prepared isradipine-loaded invasomes delivers ameliorated flux, reasonable entrapment efficiency, and more effectiveness for transdermal delivery. The optimized formulation presented the particle size of 194\u2009\u00b1\u200918\u2009nm, entrapment efficiency (88.46%), and attained mean transdermal flux of 22.80\u2009\u00b1\u20092.10\u2009\u03bcg/cm(2)/h through rat skin. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed an enhanced permeation of Rhodamine-Red-loaded isradipine invasomes to the deeper layers of the rat skin. During antihypertensive study, the treatment group showed a substantial and constant decrease in blood pressure, for up to 24\u2009h. The isradipine invasomes formulation was found to be effective, with a 20% reduction in blood pressure by virtue of better permeation through Wistar rat skin. Conclusion It was concluded that the developed isradipine invasomes accentuate the transdermal flux and the results obtained encouraged the use of the isradipine-loaded invasomes as the formulation for the potential management of hypertension.",

Antimuscarinics (e.g., solifenacin, fesoterodine) and \u03b23-adrenergic receptor agonists (mirabegron) are similarly efficacious; however, antimuscarinics may be associated with side effects that result in poor persistence and contribute to anticholinergic burden, particularly in those taking other medications with anticholinergic properties. With a mechanism of action distinct from antimuscarinics, mirabegron has a different tolerability profile and does not contribute to anticholinergic burden. The objective of this review was to compare and contrast the tolerability profiles of antimuscarinics and mirabegron in older patients to inform practice.",

Here, we studied whether counteracting this axis via stimulation of AT2 receptors is beneficial. Such stimulation occurs naturally during AT1-receptor blockade with losartan, but not during renin inhibition with aliskiren.",

Their phenotype includes cystic media degeneration, aortic regurgitation, left ventricular dilation, reduced ejection fraction, and fractional shortening. Although losartan and aliskiren reduced hemodynamic stress and increased renin similarly, only losartan increased survival. Propranolol had no effect. No drug rescued elastic fiber fragmentation in established aneurysms, although losartan did reduce aneurysm size. Losartan also increased ejection fraction, decreased LV diameter, and reduced cardiac pSmad2 signaling. None of these effects were seen with aliskiren or propranolol. Longitudinal micro-CT measurements, a novel method in which each mouse serves as its own control, revealed that losartan reduced LV growth more than aneurysm growth, presumably because the heart profits both from the local (cardiac) effects of losartan and its effects on aortic root remodeling.", 
    "220": "Losartan, but not aliskiren or propranolol, improved survival in fibulin-4 mice. This most likely relates to its capacity to improve structure and function of both aorta and heart. The absence of this effect during aliskiren treatment, despite a similar degree of blood pressure reduction and renin-angiotensin system blockade, suggests that it might be because of AT2-receptor stimulation.",

The purpose of the experiment was to evaluate clonidine as an adjuvant for propranolol on the quality and duration of cutaneous analgesia. A rat model of cutaneous trunci muscle reflex (CTMR) in response to local skin pinprick was employed to evaluate the cutaneous analgesic effect of propranolol combined with clonidine. The long-lasting local anesthetic bupivacaine was used as control. Cutaneous analgesia elicited by propranolol and bupivacaine was dose-dependent, and both propranolol (9.0\u03bcmol) and bupivacaine (1.8\u03bcmol) produced 100% nociceptive blockade. On an 50% effective dose (ED50) basis, the relative potency was bupivacaine [0.48 (0.42-0.55) \u03bcmol] greater than propranolol [2.27 (1.98-2.54) \u03bcmol] (p<0.01). Subcutaneous saline and clonidine (0.12\u03bcmol) did not produce cutaneous analgesia. The mixture of an ineffective-dose clonidine (0.12\u03bcmol) and a drug (propranolol or bupivacaine) at ED50 or ED95 increased the potency and extended the duration at producing cutaneous analgesia. The resulting data demonstrated that propranolol is less potent than bupivacaine as an infiltrative anesthetic. Clonidine as an adjuvant for propranolol or bupivacaine has a significant peripheral action in increasing the depth and duration of action on infiltrative cutaneous analgesia.",

    "230": "Hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a maladaptive response to chronic pressure overload and a strong independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Regression of LVH is associated with improved prognosis. Regression of LVH with antihypertensive therapy (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics) has been reported, although only after long-term treatment. Asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA), the most potent endogenous NO synthase inhibitor, is emerging as an important cardiovascular risk factor in patients with arterial hypertension and LVH, and dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) is the mechanism that most frequently leads to accumulation of ADMA (plasma ADMA is cleared in small part by renal excretion, although the bulk of ADMA is degraded by DDAH). Left ventricular mass is strongly modulated by the NO system. As an important inhibitor of the bioavailability of NO, ADMA is an underlying mechanism of LVH. Beta-blockers can induce regression of LVH and reduced plasma ADMA levels. Oxidative stress is increased in patients with LVH, and this in turn increases generation of ADMA. In a previous preclinical study of spontaneously hypertensive rats, we found that short-term treatment (48 h) with esmolol reverses early LVH, increases the bioavailability of NO, and improves antioxidant status in plasma. Therefore, we propose that the ADMA/DDAH/NO pathway could modulate early regression of LVH with esmolol.",

During pregnancy, hepatic decompensation could suffice and the development of hepatic failure and encephalopathy could occur. The incidence of obstetric complications is also increased with a high rate of pre-eclampsia, postpartum bleeding, preterm delivery and stillbirth. We report a case of a 27-year-old woman with autoimmune hepatitis and liver cirrhosis complicated by splenomegaly, oesophageal varices and severe thrombocytopaenia. During pregnancy, close clinical and analytical surveillance was performed. She was medicated with corticosteroids, azathioprine and propranolol. At the 25th week of gestation, an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed to control oesophageal varices. This patient had an uneventful pregnancy until 37 weeks. At 37th week of gestation, after spontaneous rupture of membranes, signs of acute fetal distress were observed, and an urgent caesarean was performed. Good neonatal and maternal outcomes were achieved."
