    "0": "The effect of propranolol on serum calcium was studied in 25 patients with thyrotoxicosis including 5 with hypercalcemia. In patients with hypercalcaemia iv propranolol significantly reduced serum calcium. Oral therapy 160 mg/day reduced calcium non-significantly from 2.72 +/- 0.09 (mean +/- SD) to 2.59 +/- 0.13 mmol/l, however on 320 mg/day the reduction (to 2.5 +/- 0.15 mmol/l) was significant. In normocalcaemic patients oral propranolol did not influence serum calcium. Both in hyper- and normocalcemic thyrotoxic patients propranolol increased (P less than 0.01) serum phosphate.", 
    "1": "The influence of the highly selective beta-1-adrenergic blocker Metoprolol on cardiovascular and metabolic side effects of the beta-mimetic Fenoterol, used for labour inhibition, was investigated in anesthetized mongrel dogs. In a dosage of 1.5 microgram/kg BW/min Metoprolol antagonized the positive inotropic and chronotropic cardiac effects of Fenoterol (0.06 microgram/kg BW/min) thus compensating the impaired energetic balance of the myocardium. As expected, there was no influence on the beta-mimetic mediated metabolic alterations. Taking into account its pharmacologic actions, the additional application of Metoprolol in labour inhibition with beta-mimetics seems to be advantageous. On account of the proven results a reduction of the more or less considerable missensations and a cardioprotective effect may be expected.", 
    "2": "1. Prizidilol (SKF 92657), a new antihypertensive drug with combined precapillary vasodilator and non-selective beta-adrenoceptor-blocking actions, was given to 24 patients with essential hypertension in a placebo-controlled, dose-titration study, Incremental doses from 200 to 800 mg were given once daily. Supine and standing blood pressure measured 24--27 h after drug intake was reduced during treatment with prizidilol (400--800 mg/day). Slight but significant decreases in heart rate were seen after moderate doses (mean: 447 mg once daily) of prizidilol. A more pronounced blood pressure reduction was noticed 2--7 h after drug administration. 2. Maximal blood pressure reduction coincided with peak plasma concentration of prizidilol, which was measured by a newly developed assay. 3. Plasma renin activity and 24 h urinary excretion of aldosterone and methoxycatecholamines were reduced after the highest doses (mean: 700 mg once daily) of prizidilol. 4. Prizidilol was well tolerated, although dizziness and tiredness were reported by four patients and oedema by two.", 
    "3": "1 The effects of propranolol in its long acting formulation, 160 mg long acting (LA) propranolol, were assessed in a double-blind, controlled study of 20 hyperthyroid patients. Further observations with the addition of carbimazole were also made. 2 LA propranolol effectively improved the clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism. 3 Plasma concentrations of total T4 and rT3 were increased, but total T3 did not fall significantly during LA propranolol treatment. 4 LA propranolol with carbimazole produced a greater reduction in the clinical indices of hyperthyroidism than carbimazole alone. 5 Total serum T4 and rT3 concentrations remained elevated with LA propranolol and carbimazole compared to carbimazole alone. 6 Carbimazole therapy for 2 weeks did not alter the mean plasma propranolol concentration. 7 We concluded that LA propranolol is effective in hyperthyroidism and its effects are similar to those reported by other workers with conventional propranolol. The clinical and biochemical effects of LA propranolol continue during concomitant carbimazole therapy.", 
    "4": "The influence of beta-adrenoceptor antagonism on the effects of a single experimental stress was investigated in 12 healthy volunteers, using a double-blind protocol. A single oral dose of 80 mg propranolol reduced the stress-induced increase in heart rate and systolic blood pressure to 49.9 per cent and 8.3 per cent respectively compared to 61.0 per cent and 17.4 per cent with placebo. The rise in diastolic blood pressure was small and unaffected by beta-adrenoceptor blockade. The rise in temperature of the skin of the trunk was significantly reduced by propranolol. The self-rating of anxiety, alertness and concentration by the subjects was unaffected by propranolol.", 
    "5": "Recent observations have been interpreted to suggest altered ventricular function during ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), apart from the effect of reduced preload. We constructed ventricular function curves in 14 anesthetized dogs as PEEP was varied under closed- and open-chest conditions. The systemic venous flow of the animal was diverted through an external circuit so that blood return to the right atrium could be varied stepwise from 1--4.5 l/min before and after 15 cmH2O PEEP was applied to the airway. Pressures adjacent to the heart were measured with thin fluid-filled water sensors to enable estimation of transmural pressure. Alterations in ventricular function were assessed by comparing tangential slopes as well as the atrial pressure differences separating the curves at high and low stroke volumes. Sensitivity of this method to cardiac depression was demonstrated by similar comparisons made before and after propranolol. Curves using transmural pressure on and off PEEP were statistically indistinguishable. We conclude that hemodynamic changes resulting from PEEP are attributable to the combined effects of reduced preload and raised juxtacardiac pressure, without ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "6": "1. With a double-blind cross-over protocol, 20 hypertensive captopril-treated patients were studied by adding in a variable sequence a placebo and propranolol (80 mg three times a day) to their captopril regimen (200 mg three times a day), during periods each lasting 1 month. During captopril--placebo treatment their diastolic blood pressure remained elevated between 90 and 114 mmHg. 2. The additional administration of propranolol produced a significant hypotensive effect, but no alterations of the plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone concentrations and of the urinary aldosterone excretion occurred. The present data indicate that in captopril-treated patients the hypotensive effect of propranolol is achieved independently of changes in the plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone concentration. 3. The additional administration of propranolol also produced an increase in the serum potassium levels in the absence of any change in plasma aldosterone concentration or in the urinary aldosterone excretion.", 
    "7": "Twenty-seven patients with hypertension and varying degrees of renal failure were studied before and during the administration of frusemide. In 15 patients studies were repeated following the addition of propranolol. Mean exchangeable sodium was increased before the introduction of frusemide or propranolol in patients with azotemia, possibly due in part to the administration of other antihypertensive drugs, and was reduced to normal during frusemide treatment increasing slightly but significantly following the addition of propranolol. Blood pressure fell significantly with frusemide but there was no further significant fall with propranolol. The relationship of change in blood pressure to change in exchangeable sodium with frusemide did not reach significance. There was no relationship between changes in blood pressure and changes in plasma renin activity with frusemide, suggesting that the blood pressure response to frusemide is not limited by the rise in renin. The fall in blood pressure following the addition of propranolol was proportional to the dose of the drug but inversely proportional to the change in renin suggesting that renin levels are to some extent determined by the blood pressure response to propranolol rather than themselves determining that response. Serum creatinine was significantly increased during treatment with frusemide probably due to a combination of the effects of sodium depletion and the natural progression of the underlying renal disease rather than to nephrotoxicity. The further slight increase in serum creatinine following the addition of propranolol is in keeping with the reported effect of this drug on renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate in patients without renal disease.", 
    "8": "The short and long-term antihypertensive action of timolol, a beta blocker, was assessed in 36 mild hypertensives in a 32-wk, double-blind, placebo-controlled study followed by an additional 96 wk of timolol in 17 responders. Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) declined during the first phase from 103 to 93 mm Hg and from 73 to 61 bpm (P less than 0.01) but there was long-term timolol subjects (DBP 89 mm Hg at 32 wk and 88 mm Hg at 96 wk [NS] and HR 62 and 65 bpm [NS]). Although stimulated plasma renin activity in the entire group decreased from 1.08 to 0.28 ng/ml/hr (P less than 0.001), blood pressure reduction did not correlate with this decline (r = 0.29) or with serum timolol level (r = 0.29). In 20 patients who underwent treadmill was not altered. Thus, timolol is effective in reducing mild high blood pressure during short-term therapy and in maintaining this effect over the long term in responsive subjects. It is therefore potentially useful in chronic essential hypertension.", 
    "9": "While the principles of drug management of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias have remained essentially unchanged, such treatment remains empirical in many patients. Recent advances in the understanding of electrophysiological mechanisms have not only rationalised treatment but dictated newer approaches to these and other arrhythmias.", 
    "10": "The measurements of the plasma concentrations of antiarrhythmic drugs is useful both for studying the pharmacokinetics and bio-availability of a drug, and for assessing the relationship between pharmacological activity and plasma levels in clinical practice so that dosages may be adapted to obtain optimal efficacity in each individual patient and to avoid side-effects caused by drugs with low therapeutic indices. Many methods are available, including spectrophotometry, spectrofluorometry, gas chromatography, liquid chromatography and immuno-enzymology. The practicability, sensitivity and specificity of these techniques are compared with respect to their objectives. Particular attention is paid to the principal antiarrhythmic agents with fairly well defined zones of efficacity: procainamide, quinidine, disopyramide, propranolol, lignocaine and mexiletine.", 
    "11": "GABA uptake and release mechanisms have been shown for neuronal as well as glial cells. To explore further neuronal versus glial components of the [3H]gamma-aminobutyric acid ([3H]GABA) release studies were performed with two different microdissected layers of the olfactory bulb of the rat: the olfactory nerve layer (ONL), consisting mainly of glial cells, and the external plexiform layer (EPL) with a high density of GABAergic dendritic terminals. In some experiments substantia nigra was used as a GABAergic axonal system and the trigeminal ganglia as a peripheral glial model. Spontaneous release of [3H]GABA was always lower in neuronal elements as compared with glial cells. A veratridine-evoked release was observed from the ONL but not from the trigeminal ganglia. Tetrodotoxin (TTX) abolished the veratridine-evoked release from the ONL, which also showed a partial inhibition when high magnesium concentrations were used in a Ca2+-free solution. beta-Alanine was strongly exchanged with [3H]GABA from the ONL of animals with the olfactory nerve lesioned and from animals with no lesion; but only a small heteroexchange was found from the external plexiform layer. The beta-alanine heteroexchange was able to deplete the releasable GABA store from the ONL of lesioned animals. In nonlesioned animals and the external plexiform layer, the veratridine-stimulated release of [3H]GABA was not significantly reduced after the beta-alanine heteroexchange. Stimulation of the [3H]GABA release by high concentrations of potassium elicited a higher release rate from axonal terminals than from dendrites or glia. Neurones and glia showed a similar inhibition of [3H]GABA release when a high magnesium concentration was added to a calcium-free solution. When D-600 was used as a calcium-flux blocker no inhibition of the release was observed in glial cells, whereas an almost complete blockage was found in both neuronal preparations (substantia nigra and EPL). These results provide further evidence for differential release mechanisms of GABA from CNS neurones and glial cells.", 
    "12": "1. The effects on glucose and lipid metabolism and on plasma catecholamines at rest and during exercise, of 4 weeks treatment with non-selective beta-blockade (pindolol, 15 mg daily) and with cardio-selective blockade (metoprolol, 200 mg, and acebutolol, 500 mg, respectively) were compared in different groups of hypertensive men (mean age 37 years) by single blind cross-over technique. All patients continued the treatment with either metoprolol or acebutolol for another 12--14 months. 2. All antagonists reduced blood pressures and exercise heart rates in a virtually identical manner. Whereas lipolysis was similarly inhibited by both selective beta 1-antagonists and non-selective beta 1-beta 2-blockers, glycogenolysis in the muscle was inhibited only by non-selective beta-receptor blockade. 3. The inhibition of glycogen breakdown resulted in exercise hypoglycaemia and in increases of plasma adrenaline and ACTH, which probably reflect counter-regulatory mechanisms. No major metabolic changes occurred after 12--14 months compared with 4 weeks of treatment.", 
    "13": "Propranolol, 20 mg, was given orally four times daily for 5 days and placebo four times daily for 5 days in a randomized, double-blind fashion to nine healthy subjects. At the beginning of the study and on the last day of each medication pulse rate, blood pressure, airways resistance, maximum expiratory flow versus volume (using air and using 80% helium and 20% oxygen), spirometry before and after inhaled isoproterenol, and ventilatory and occlusion pressure responses to rebreathing carbon dioxide were measured. Results were compared by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Propranolol was associated with decreases in pulse rate (P = 0.002), systolic blood pressure (P = 0.024), and diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.027). There were no differences in airway resistance or the change of expiratory flow with helium-oxygen. Propranolol did not alter the preisoproterenol spirometry values but did reduce the response to isoproterenol. There were decreases in ventilatory responses (P = 0.004) and occlusion pressure responses (P = 0.006) at an end-tidal carbon dioxide of 60 mm Hg. Propranolol's beta-adrenergic blockade suppresses central ventilatory response to carbon dioxide.", 
    "14": "Effects of trapidil, a non-nitrate type coronary vasodilator, nitroglycerin and dipyridamole on epicardial coronary diameter and total coronary resistance were studied in anesthetized open-chest dogs. The epicardial coronary diameter of the left circumflex coronary artery was measured by sonomicrometry and total coronary resistance was calculated by aortic pressure and coronary blood flow. Intravenous administration of Trapidil, as well as nitroglycerin, produced transient decreases in total coronary resistance followed by sustained dilation of the large coronary artery. Dipyridamole increased coronary blood flow by 2.7-fold, whereas diameter of the large coronary artery decreased along with the reduction of aortic pressure. The first peak of the biphasic increases in coronary blood flow and subsequent dilation of the large coronary artery appeared after an i.v. bolus administration of trapidil or nitroglycerin and remained even after beta adrenergic blockade. Intracoronary administration of either drug produced monophasic increases in coronary blood flow along with subsequent dilation of the large coronary artery. Thus, trapidil, like nitroglycerin, directly dilates the large and small coronary arteries.", 
    "15": "Eight asthmatic patients were investigated in a double-blind cross-over study after oral administration of 100 mg atenolol, 10 mg metoprolol and placebo. Four increasing doses of terbutaline (0.036-1.23 micrograms kg-1 min-1) were thereafter administered by intravenous infusion, starting 120 min after the tablet intake. The infusions were given for 6 min on each dose level with 30-min intervals. The study was finished by inhalation of six terbutaline puffs (1.5 mg). Both atenolol and metoprolol lowered resting heart rate and FEV1 significantly and produced a down- and rightward shift of the dose-response curves to infused terbutaline. No differences between effects of the two beta-blockers were shown in reduction of heart rate and FEV1, before and during the terbutaline treatments. Differences in cardioselectivity between atenolol and metoprolol could thus not be shown.", 
    "16": "The isolated rat heart with ligation of the left coronary artery was used to assess the role of the beta 1- adrenergic receptor-cyclic AMP mechanism in the genesis of vulnerability to ventricular fibrillation in early myocardial ischaemia. Coronary artery ligation was followed after 3 min by a reduction in ventricular fibrillation threshold which reached a minimum at 15 min. This was accompanied by reduction of ATP and phosphocreatine while cyclic AMP was significantly increased in ischaemic myocardium. The dl-, l- and d-isomers of propranolol attenuated the decrease in ventricular fibrillation threshold and the increase in ischaemic myocardial cyclic AMP, without altering the tissue depletion of ATP. Specific beta 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism with atenolol did not prevent either the increase of tissue cyclic AMP or the reduction in ventricular fibrillation threshold and high energy phosphates. These findings suggest that the mechanism whereby vulnerability to fibrillation is increased in very early myocardial ischaemia is linked to changes in cyclic AMP content of ischaemic myocardium and appears independent of depletion of myocardial high energy phosphates.", 
    "17": "We have investigated alterations in beta adrenergic receptor binding sites of rat reticulocytes occurring in animals rendered hypothyroid by thyroidectomy. Beta adrenergic receptor interactions were assessed by measuring the number of (-)[3H]-dihydroalprenolol binding sites and the ability of an agonist to compete for occupancy of the receptors. The number of receptors was significantly reduced in cells from the hypothyroid animals. In addition, there were significant agonist-specific alterations in binding. Using computer assisted curve fitting techniques, it was found that the ability of (-)isoproterenol to stabilize a high affinity guanine nucleotide sensitive \"coupled\" form of the receptor was impaired. Reticulocytes from hypothyroid animals have, in addition, a reduction in the concentration of the nucleotide regulatory protein as assessed by the number of 42,000 Mr substrates for cholera toxin catalyzed ADP ribosylation. These alterations are associated with reductions in catecholamine and NaF stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. Diminished coupling of beta adrenergic receptors with other regulatory components of the adenylate cyclase system represents a mechanism by which altered thyroid states modulate beta adrenergic receptor function and beta adrenergic responsiveness of tissues.", 
    "18": "1. Noise stimulation (100 dBA) for 10 min caused a significant increase in diastolic (7.0%, P less than 0.001) and mean arterial blood pressure (4.3%, P less than 0.01) in patients with essential hypertension. 2. The blood pressure response to noise was due to an increase in total peripheral resistance (4.8%, P less than 0.02); heart rate, stroke volume and cardiac output were unchanged. 3. beta 1-selective adrenoceptor blockade (metoprolol) did not change the haemodynamic reaction pattern induced by noise. 4. Noise exposure during non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blockade (propranolol) caused an accentuated blood pressure response with increments of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as a more pronounced rise in total peripheral resistance. 5. The haemodynamic changes induced by noise stimulation at 100 dBA totally disappeared after 5 min of quiet rest at 40 dBA.", 
    "19": "1. Seventeen male patients with essential hypertension were studied after 4 weeks of placebo and after 8 weeks of beta-adrenoceptor-blockade therapy with atenolol (100 mg/kg). 2. The influence of the following factors on left ventricular wall thickness and left ventricular mass index as determined by echocardiography was examined: patient's age, duration of hypertension, arterial pressure, blood pressure variability, supine heart rate, maximal exercise heart rate, left ventricular wall stress and 24 h urinary catecholamines. 3. Left ventricular mass index was related to systolic blood pressure (r = 0.54, P less than 0.05) and to extent of increase in heart rate with maximal exercise (r = 0.62, P less than 0.05). No significant correlation was present between mass index and other variables. 4. After atenolol therapy, left ventricular mass index decreased by 14 g/m2 (12%). Changes in mass were related to its initial value (r = 0.69, P less than 0.01) and to % change in wall stress (r = 0.64, P less than 0.05). Patients who had a decrease in mass index of 10% or greater had an initially lower diastolic pressure (P less than 0.001). Other factors did not appear to influence significantly the regression of hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy.", 
    "20": "Cultures of two myogenic cell lines, L6E9 and L8, were grown in the absence or presence of dexamethasone. Dexamethasone (1 microM) completely inhibited the formation of myotubes. Partial inhibition (20-40%) was obtained at a concentration as low as 1 nM. Dexamethasone also inhibited beta-adrenergic responsiveness, as noted by decreases in isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity and cAMP accumulation. These effects were both dose and time dependent. In the presence of dexamethasone, the number of beta-adrenergic receptors, as assessed by [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol binding, decreased coordinately with the decrease in cAMP. A high affinity, limited capacity cytosolic binding site for [3H]triamcinolone acetonide observed under control conditions (Kd = 0.7 nM; maximum binding, 2.7 pmol/mg protein) increased in number as a function of developmental state. These data indicate that glucocorticoids inhibit myogenesis and beta-adrenergic responsiveness in vitro.", 
    "21": "This study describes the use of central and diffuse airway deposition patterns of isoproterenol and radiotracer aerosol alone, and in the presence of centrally deposited propranolol and radiotracer aerosol, to investigate the distribution of beta 2 adrenoreceptors in six asthmatic patients. The central deposition technique was only partially successful. No definite beta 2 receptor distribution pattern could be interpreted from the airway function responses. It was noted that 3-10 micrograms of isoproterenol in the airways was able to produce 50 percent of the maximum possible flow rate response. Centrally deposited propranolol was an effective antagonist of isoproterenol.", 
    "22": "This review summarizes the available medical literature about plasma norepinephrine, which as been used as an indicator of sympathetic neural activity in clinical cardiology. Plasma norepinephrine levels are elevated myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure, and the norepinephrine concentration varies with severity of disease. Patients with ischemic heart disease at rest show essentially normal plasma norepinephrine, but no studies have assessed norepinephrine levels during spontaneously occurring typical angina pectoris. Plasma norepinephrine also is increased during hypertension occurring after coronary bypass surgery or repair of aortic coarctation. Propranolol increases plasma norepinephrine, and acute withdrawal of propranolol does not. Sodium restriction increases plasma norepinephrine in healthy persons, but no information is available about its effect on patients with congestive heart failure. Insufficient data are available to make strong inferences about sympathetic activity in cardiomyopathy, essential hypertension or pulmonary hypertension, and little or no information is available about plasma norepinephrine in ventricular fibrillation without myocardial infarction, the mitral valve prolapse syndrome, digoxin effect, syndromes associated with prolonged electrocardiographic Q-T interval and the hyperkinetic heart syndrome.", 
    "23": "In order to elucidate the sympathetic activity of the uninhibited neurogenic bladder, controlled cystometry before and during the influence of alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists was performed on patients with normal and uninhibited neurogenic bladder. Alpha-agonist increased the pathological findings in the cystometrogram of the uninhibited bladder with increase in intravesical pressure, decrease in capacity and increase in the amplitude of the uninhibited contraction, but had no effect whatsoever on the normal bladder. Alpha-antagonists improved the uninhibited bladder with decrease in intravesical pressure, increase in capacity and decrease in amplitude of the uninhibited contraction, and decrease in intravesical pressure in normal bladder. Beta 2-agonist improved the uninhibited bladder too, but was proved to be inactive on the normal bladder. Unselective beta- and selective beta 1-antagonists deteriorated the uninhibited bladder and had only minor effect on the normal bladder. The decreased capacity and forcible uninhibited detrusor contraction seem to be due to a reduction of inhibitory beta-adrenergic impulses as well as an increased contractile alpha-adrenergic action on the bladder wall in uninhibited neurogenic bladder.", 
    "24": "1 In the present investigation, noradrenaline-induced vascular contractions in isolated rat mesenteric arteries were studied in short and long-term experimental diabetic rats. The diabetic state was induced with streptozotocin (65 mg/kg, i.v.). 2 Long-term diabetic rats were hypertensive when compared to age-matched control rats. In contrast, short-term diabetic rats appeared to be hypotensive when compared to age-matched control rats. 3 Long-term diabetic mesenteric arteries were supersensitive to noradrenaline and developed more contractile force in response to noradrenaline when compared to age-matched control mesenteric arteries. beta-adrenoreceptor antagonism had no effect on the sensitivity of the mesenteric arteries (diabetic and control) for noradrenaline, however, there was an increase in the contractile force developed by these tissues in response to noradrenaline during beta-adrenoreceptor antagonism. 4 alpha-Adrenoreceptor antagonism produced a decrease in the sensitivity of both long-term diabetic and corresponding age-matched control mesenteric arteries. alpha-Adrenoreceptor antagonism had no effect on contractile force developed by long-term mesenteric arteries (diabetic and control) in response to noradrenaline. 5 The present data indicate that long-term experimental diabetes produces a supersensitivity of rat mesenteric arteries to noradrenaline. This phenomenon is dependent upon the duration of the diabetic state. Supersensitivity of the mesenteric arteries to noradrenaline may indicate an increased arterial vascular resistance which may contribute to the observed hypertension.", 
    "25": "1 The effects of several drugs upon the excitatory junction potential (e.j.p.) in the guinea-pig vas deferens have been investigated. 2 Amiodarone, a noradrenergic neurone blocker which also blocks both alpha and beta-adrenoreceptors, did not reduce the e.j.p. 3 The alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonists, azapetine, piperoxan and prazosin, only enhanced the e.j.p. irrespective of their relative potencies at alpha 1 and alpha 2-adrenoreceptors. 4 Sotalol, a beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist, was without effect upon the e.j.p. 5 Clonidine and lysergic acid diethylamide, alpha-adrenoreceptor agonists, produced a dose dependent inhibition of the e.j.p. without apparently affecting the frequency or size of spontaneous junction potentials. 6 The effects of clonidine were antagonized by piperoxan in a competitive reversible manner. 7 It is argued that these results confirm the presence of alpha-adrenoreceptors prejunctionally upon the sympathetic excitatory innervation of the vas deferens but that although an endogenous alpha-adrenoreceptor agonist is released by nerve stimulation either the transmitter that is responsible for the e.j.p. is not noradrenaline or that the postjunctional receptors responsible for the generation of the e.j.p. are not adrenoreceptors.", 
    "26": "1 Observations were made in five healthy subjects who exercised before and 2, 3, 6, 8 and 24 h after the oral administration on separate occasions of 160 mg oxprenolol, 160 mg slow release oxprenolol, 160 mg slow release oxprenolol with 0.25 mg cyclopenthiazide and placebo. Blood samples were obtained before and at 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h after drug administration and assayed for oxprenolol concentration. 2 The three formulations produced maximum reductions of 29% in the exercise tachycardia 3 to 6 h after drug administration. At 24 h the effects of the three preparations were not significantly different from placebo. 3 There were no significant differences in the plasma concentrations produced by the three formulations during the 24 h period. 4 These observations suggest that the slow release formulations of oxprenolol should be given twice daily to maintain cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blockade throughout a period of 24 h.", 
    "27": "1 The effects of two beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (propranolol and metoprolol), and of the beta-adrenoceptor agonist, terbutaline, on the plasma kinetics of antipyrine were studied in five normal subjects. In addition, the influence of propranolol on the clearance of antipyrine to three of its major metabolites was investigated. 2 At the same level of beta-adrenoceptor blockade, assessed by lowering of exercise tachycardia, propranolol decreased antipyrine clearance by 37.3 +/- 9.9 s.d. % (P less than 0.001) and metoprolol decreased it by 18.0 +/- 4.7 s.d. % (P less than 0.01). Terbutaline had no effect on antipyrine clearance. The volume of distribution of antipyrine was unchanged following treatment with all three drugs. 3 Only the metabolic clearance of antipyrine to its 3-hydroxymethyl product was impaired to a statistically significant degree by propranolol. However, four of the five subjects also showed impaired clearance to 4-hydroxyantipyrine and three of the five to norantipyrine after propranolol treatment. In four of the five subjects propranolol lowered the renal clearance of antipyrine. 4 Inhibition of the metabolism of antipyrine by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists may be related to their lipid-solubility and extent of metabolism and is independent of their effect on beta-adrenoreceptors.", 
    "28": "Betaadrenergics are the most important agents in the treatment of premature labour. Often they are used in combination with steroids which promote fetal lung maturation and prevent respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants. Because PG synthesis inhibitors also reduce uterine contractions they have been used as tocolytics whenever beta adrenergics alone fail. Several cases of pulmonary edema in otherwise healthy pregnant women have been reported following a combined tocolytic treatment with betaadrenergic drugs and PG synthesis inhibitors. The inhibited synthesis and function of renal PGs may be a very important factor contributing to those fatal events. Both, the ADH stimulating effect of beta adrenergics and the inhibition of the negative feed back mechanism of PGs on ADH action by blockade of PG synthesis potentiates renal water retention, thereby increasing the risk of water intoxication. Concerning the effects of maternal tocolytic treatment on the fetus or newborn, there is good evidence that PG inhibitors like aspirin or indomethacin can lead to closure of the ductus Botalli prior to birth and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. Severe cardiopulmonary adaption disturbances may be the consequence. Routine clinical use of PG synthesis inhibitors in combination with adrenergic stimulants cannot be recommended on the basis of available information.", 
    "29": "The presence and types of adrenergic receptors in sheep urethra were investigated in vitro by pharmacological stimulation and blockage of alfa and beta receptors with agonist and antagonist drugs. Both adrenergic receptors were identified. Alfa stimulation increased tonicity and strength of contractions. Relaxation was obtained by beta adrenergic stimuli. Beta receptors in the sheep urethra belong to beta-2 type.", 
    "30": "Abrupt discontinuation of propranolol in patients with coronary artery disease may lead to untoward ischemic events. The explanation for this clinical syndrome has been thought to be related to a physiological sympathetic rebound. To investigate a biochemical basis for this hypothesis we administered propranolol (5 mg/kg s.c.) twice daily to guinea-pigs for 2 weeks. Heart rates gradually declined during treatment and after cessation of the drug returned to control level without evidence of rebound. Left ventricular and right atrial norepinephrine levels were unchanged in the withdrawal period. Tyrosine hydroxylase activity was unchanged in the right atrium but had declined significantly in the left ventricle at 96 hr. Tyrosine hydroxylase activity was unchanged in the stellate ganglion and adrenal gland. Thus, we did not find any alterations in catecholamine metabolism compatible with a sympathetic rebound state.", 
    "31": "The aim of the present work was to study the mechanism of the mobilization of plasma lipids produced by histamine in the dog, in vivo. The increase of plasma lipids by histamine in vivo was suppressed by cimetidine, but not by diphenhydramine. Although, histamine increased the level of plasma adrenaline, adrenaline does not appear to contribute to the lipolysis stimulated by histamine, because propranolol and alprenolol, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, did not affect the lipolysis stimulated by histamine. From these data it is concluded that the increase of plasma lipids in vivo is not attributable to the release of adrenaline from adrenal glands by histamine, but is produced by the stimulation through H2-receptors in fat cells.", 
    "32": "We investigated the effect of beta-adrenoceptor stimulants on the canine tracheal ciliated cells. A mucosal specimen of the tracheal membranous cell was placed in a chamber containing Hanks' solution. Membrane potential was recorded by an intracellular microelectrode, and ciliary beating was measured by a photoelectrical technique. Isoproterenol and salbutamol in 10(-7) to 10(-4) M caused a concentration-dependent increase in both frequencies of ciliary beating and small electrical oscillatories were superimposed on the membrane potential. Theophylline also increased frequencies of both activities in doses of 10(-5) M and above. Onset of action of theophylline was later than that of isoproterenol or salbutamol. All the above drugs only slightly depolarized the membrane potential, in concentrations of 10(-4) M. Propranolol (10(-7)-10(-4) M) alone had little effect on ciliary beating and electrical activity. However, the effects of isoproterenol and salbutamol were effectively antagonized by propranolol (10(-5) M). Dibutyryl cyclic AMP (10(-7)-10(-4) M) caused concentration-dependent increases in ciliary beating and electrical activity. These results suggest that potent bronchodilators such as beta-stimulants and theophylline increase the activity of tracheal ciliated cells by stimulating the intracellular cyclic AMP system.", 
    "33": "The effect of non-selective beta-blockade with propranolol, beta 1-selective blockade with betaxolol and of saline on the plasma potassium response to insulin induced hypoglycaemia was examined in six healthy subjects. Although propranolol retarded the recovery from hypoglycaemia, the degree of hypokalaemia was significantly (p less than 0.01) less than with saline or betaxolol, which had similar effects. Adrenergic mechanisms may modulate potassium disposal through a beta 2 receptor.", 
    "34": "In the Beta-blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT) a number of strategies were implemented to increase the probability of informed voluntary consent among survivors of an acute myocardial infarction. To evaluate the subjects' comprehension of the study, a bioethicist conducted in-depth home interviews with a random sample of 64 participants from 11 geographic areas. The great majority of respondents proved to be well informed about the study design, its scientific logic, and possible risks of the experimental drug. However, five subjects (8% of the sample) appeared to believe they were involved in a therapeutic program rather than a research project. The analysis of predictor variables indicates that education, race, and age were associated with the degree of respondent awareness of fundamental aspects of the trial.", 
    "35": "The Beta Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT) is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo control clinical trial sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute designed to test the effectiveness of regular propranolol administration in reducing total mortality in patients who have survived a recent acute myocardial infarction. A number of other fatal and nonfatal response variables are also being monitored. Three thousand eight hundred thirty-seven patients, ages 30-69, are being followed at 31 clinical centers for a minimum of about 2 and a maximum of 4 years after the infarction. A number of design features of BHAT are discussed. These include maintenance of patient logs, guidelines for obtaining informed consent of patients, assessment of patient knowledge about BHAT, adjustment of study drug dose based on serum levels, and comparison of 1-hr and 24-hr ambulatory electrocardiogram readings.", 
    "36": "Noradrenaline (NA), adrenaline (ADR), isoprenaline (ISO) and dopamine (DA) were given through a chronically implanted cannula in the lateral cerebral ventricle of Mastomys natalensis. Low doses of NA (0.05-0.25 microgram) reduced rectal temperature while larger doses (0.35 microgram upwards) produced dose-dependent hyperthermia. The hypothermic effect was antagonised by alpha-adrenoceptor and the hyperthermia by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. alpha-Methyl noradrenaline produced less hyperthermia but it antagonised the hyperthermic effect of NA. Adrenaline (0.1-10 microgram) was ineffective per se but when given after tolazoline it produced hyperthermia and after propranolol it produced hypothermia. The dose-dependent hyperthermia with isoprenaline (0.1-10 microgram) was blocked by propranolol and MJ-1999. Dopamine (0.5-20 microgram) and its agonists apomorphine, amantadine and BS 9641 produced hyperthermia which was antagonised by haloperidol and pimozide but not by alpha- or beta adrenoceptor antagonists. Noradrenaline (1.0 microgram) produced hypothermia at ambient temperature of 10 degrees C and 16 degrees C. It had no effect at 20 degrees C which seems to be the thermoneutral zone for mastomys. The hyperthermic effect at 33 degrees C was less than at 24 degrees C. Dopamine (10 micrograms) response was attenuated at 33 degrees C and unaffected at other ambient temperatures. It is concluded that alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors and DA-receptors exist in the central thermoregulatory mechanism in mastomys. The alpha-receptors are concerned with lowering the body temperature whereas the beta-receptors and DA-receptors are involved in raising it.", 
    "37": "The use of beta-adrenoblockers in patients with acute myocardial infarction, accompanied by hypertension and hyperdynamia, leads to normalization of the arterial pressure, of parametres of haemo- and cardiodynamics, to a decrease of the degree of ischaemia of the damaged myocardium and to an increase of the heart work efficacy.", 
    "38": "3H-befunolol was administered intravenously to pigmented rabbits. Thirty minutes after the administration, the iris, ciliary body and retina were fixed, embedded and processed for light microscopic radioautography. Radioautographical silver grains were observed over the pigment granules of the iris, ciliary body, choroid and retina. From these results it is concluded that 3H-befunolol is incorporated into the pigment granules of these cells. The mechanism of incorporation is discussed.", 
    "39": "Systolic time interval (STI) measurements were made in 44 patients with coronary artery disease: 38 had regional left ventricular (LV) asynergy, and the remaining 6 had normal ventricular contraction patterns on left ventricular angiography. There was a significant correlation between both the preejection period (PEP) (r = 0.70) and the PEP/LVET (LV ejection time) ratio (r = 0.66), with the extent of regional ventricular dysfunction measured quantitatively on the left ventricular angiogram (P less than 0.001). A PEP/LVET ratio greater than 0.50 was associated with ventricular asynergy involving more than 40% of the LV circumference at end diastole. STI measurements also correlated with ejection fraction but not with ventricular end diastolic pressure nor with the number of obstructed coronary arteries.", 
    "40": "Rat pulmonary alveolar type II cells isolated by trypsinization and discontinuous density gradient ultracentrifugation were maintained in primary culture for 48 hours. The cultured type II cells responded to beta-adrenergic, but not cholinergic, agonists by an increase in the rate of synthesis and also secretion of 3H-phosphatidylcholine. The beta-adrenergic agonists, isoproterenol and terbutaline, 10 microM, caused a 1.7-fold increase in the rate of synthesis of 3H-phosphatidylcholine after a 4-hour incubation. At this time, there was also an increase in the cAMP content of the cultured cells. Terbutaline, 10 microM, caused a 4.9-fold increase in the rate of secretion of 3H-phosphatidylcholine after a 1-hour incubation. The beta-adrenergic effect on both synthesis and secretion by type II cells was blocked by propranolol. 8-Br-cAMP, 100 microM, but not 8-Br-cGMP, mimicked the beta-adrenergic effect on both synthesis and secretion of 3H-phosphatidylcholine. The increased rate of 3H-phosphatidylcholine induced by beta-adrenergic agonists was unaffected by colchicine. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that both synthesis and secretion of pulmonary surfactant are under adrenergic control operating through a beta-receptor and the adenylate cyclase system. These data also suggest that synthesis and secretion of pulmonary surfactant are independent processes. The possibility of other neural or hormonal mechanisms is not excluded.", 
    "41": "To understand the mechanism underlying bronchial hyperreactivity in the Basenji-Greyhound (BG) dog, the effects of propranolol (2 mg/kg) and hexamethonium (5 mg/kg) on base-line pulmonary mechanics and on the bronchial response to aerosol challenges of citric acid and methacholine were studied in five BG dogs. Both propranolol and hexamethonium increased base-line pulmonary resistance (RL) from 0.69 +/- 0.05 (means +/- SE) cmH2O.l-1.s to 1.67 +/- 0.10 (P less than 0.05) and 2.22 +/- 0.45 cmH2O.1-1.s (P less than 0.05) and decreased dynamic compliance (Cdyn) from 190 +/- 10 ml/cmH2O to 154 +/- 9 (P less than 0.05) and 140 +/- 9 (P less than 0.05) ml/cmH2O, respectively. Both propranolol and hexamethonium potentiated the pulmonary response to 10% citric acid given for 5 min (P less than 0.05). RL postchallenge was 4.4 +/- 0.23, 8.1 +/- 0.81, and 7.8 +/- 0.31 cmH2O.l-1.s, and Cdyn was 78 +/- 5, 58 +/- 6, and 51 +/- 3 ml/cmH2O in untreated, propranolol-pretreated, and hexamethonium-pretreated animals. In untreated BG dogs, methacholine (0.075 mg/ml) increased RL from 0.94 +/- 0.25 to 2.2 +/- 0.21 cmH2O.l-1.s (234%) and decreased Cdyn from 223 +/- 39 to 141 +/- 14 ml/cmH2O (63%). In the same animals pretreated with propranolol, methacholine (0.075 mg/ml) increased RL from 1.9 +/- 0.66 to 4.8 +/- 1.37 cmH2O.l-1.s (253%) and decreased Cdyn from 144 +/- 35 to 81 +/- 15 ml/cmH2O (56%). We conclude that propranolol produces airway constriction in BG dogs, as in asthmatic humans and that the effects of propranolol on airways in BG dogs are not due to parasympathetic or alpha-adrenergic predominance.", 
    "42": "1. BM 12.434 was compared with a known beta-adrenoceptor-blocking agent, metipranolol, and a combination of metipranolol and isosorbide-5-mononitrate in healthy volunteers. BM 12.434 and metipranolol were given in equi-effective beta-adrenoceptor-blocking doses (reduction of exercise-increased pulse--pressure product). 2. Responses of the cardiovascular system were determined by non-invasive methods. 3. BM 12.434 increased the peripheral resistance less than metipranolol. 4. After BM 12.434, in contrast to metipranolol, both arterial flow and the venous capacity showed significant increase. 5. The combination of isosorbide-5-mononitrate and metipranolol differed from metipranolol alone mainly by the effect on venous capacity, which showed a slight increase. 6. BM 12.434 is a beta-adrenoceptor-blocking agent whose additional actions on the veins and arteries are potentially useful for the treatment of both coronary heart disease and of arterial hypertension.", 
    "43": "1. The effect of treatment with a thiazide-like diuretic alone or combined with a beta-adrenoceptor blocker on serum lipoproteins was investigated in 35 patients with essential hypertension. 2. In group I (18 patients), serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was increased (P less than 0.001) during monotherapy with chlorthalidone (100 mg/day) but not during combined chlorthalidone--beta-blocker therapy. 3. This tendency was similar in subgroups studied with an inverse sequence of drug administration. In subgroup IA (11 men), a 22% increase (P less than 0.01) in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol after 6 weeks of chlorthalidone was reversed after use of a beta-blocker as well as chlorthalidone; in subgroup IB (five men, two post-menopausal women), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was increased by 41% (P less than 0.05) above placebo values 6 weeks after withdrawal of the beta-blocker from combination therapy. 4. In group II (18 men), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was increased by 13% (P less than 0.025) after 4 weeks of monotherapy with clopamide (5 mg/day) but restored to control levels 4 weeks after addition of pindolol (10 mg/day). 5. No significant changes occurred during any treatment phase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. 6. Certain beta-receptor blocking agents may prevent or reverse diuretic-induced increases in serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.", 
    "44": "1. After 10 years of beta-adrenoceptor blockade in five female patients with essential hypertension, the beta-adrenoceptor-blocking agent was withdrawn, and the women were then followed up for 1 year, with measurements of cardiac output and peripheral resistance. 2. Blood pressure remained low during the first year after withdrawal in spite of the fact that the heart rate increased within the first few days. 3. Cardiac output was found to increase during the first year after withdrawal, although total peripheral resistance was essentially unchanged. 4. The maintenance of low blood pressure after withdrawal of the antihypertensive drug might indicate a regression of structural changes in the resistance vessels during successful long-term antihypertensive treatment. 5. Minimal resistance in hands and calves did not increase during the year after withdrawal.", 
    "45": "Disturbances of the bladder-urethra function may lead either to frequency, urinary incontinence, or urinary retention. A survey is given on the drugs most frequently used in the treatment of lower urinary tract dysfunction. Special attention is drawn to the use of parasympatholytics in the treatment of hyperactive detrusor function (unstable bladder), sympathomimetics in the treatment of decreased urethral resistance, parasympathomimetics in the treatment of hypoactive detrusor function and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents in the treatment of increased urethral resistance.", 
    "46": "The synthesis of a series of (E)-1-amino-3-[2-(2-isoxazolylethenyl)phenoxyl-2-propanols is described. These compounds were found to have beta- and alpha-adrenergic blocking properties, as well as hypotensive and antihypertensive properties. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonism of all these compounds was more pronounced than their alpha-sympatholytic and hypotensive activity. 3a was 16 times more potent than labetalol in beta-adrenergic receptor blockade and was effective in lowering blood pressure in acute trials on spontaneously hypertensive rats at a dosage of 15 mg/kg. Structure-activity considerations showed that antihypertensive potency was more sensitive to structural variations than beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic activity. However, in general, those compounds having the most potent beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity also lowered blood pressure most effectively.", 
    "47": "The effect of acebutolol as an antihypertensive beta receptor-blocking drug was evaluated in 15 patients that remained hypertensive while on diuretics. Observations were made in a small randomized double-blind trial in which the drug was compared to placebo and subsequently during a single-blind phase when the drug was given to those who had not responded to placebo. The dose range for acebutolol was 200 to 600 mg twice daily. Pretreatment plasma renin activity (PRA) and the response to intravenous saralasin infusion were assessed as predictors of the antihypertensive effect of acebutolol. None of six patients receiving placebo had a response of goal blood pressure or below; six of nine receiving acebutolol did respond (P less than 0.01). Acebutolol treatment induced reduction in diastolic pressure, heart rate, and PRA pooled from both phases of the study. There were no significant correlations between acebutolol therapy. Our data indicate that acebutolol is effective in diuretic-resistant hypertensive patients and that indices of the renin-angiotensin system are not predictors of the therapeutic response.", 
    "48": "1 The actions of raubasine, yohimbine and corynanthine at pre- and postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors were studied in the rat vas deferens. 2 Low frequency electrical stimulation of the isolated vas deferens of the rat produced regular contractions that were inhibited by low concentrations of clonidine. This inhibition was presynaptic in origin and involved alpha-adrenoceptors. 3 Presynaptic alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist activity was assessed by studying the effect of increasing antagonist concentrations on cumulative clonidine dose-response curves on the stimulated vas deferens. 4 Postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist activity in the isolated vas deferens was assessed by comparing control cumulative noradrenaline dose-response curves in the absence and in the presence of increasing concentrations of antagonists. 5 The results indicate that raubasine and corynanthine preferentially block postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors. Yohimbine is more potent in blocking pre- than postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors. The ration of the pre/postsynaptic potency declines in the order yohimbine less than raubasine less than corynanthine.", 
    "49": "Throughout the last decade, multiple interventions have been shown to decrease myocardial ischemic injury and limit infarct size in animal models of acute myocardial infarction. Results of pilot studies have suggested that some of these interventions may also have beneficial effects in humans with evolving myocardial infarction. This review focuses on the rationale for limiting infarct size, efficacy of methods for estimating size of infarcts, and current clinical data on specific intervention therapy. No intervention has yet been proved sufficiently efficacious to warrant its routine clinical use. However, treatment with beta-adrenergic blockers, intravenous nitroglycerin, and hyaluronidase has been shown to affect one or more indexes of infarct size in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Large, randomized clinical trials of these and other promising interventions are underway and will provide data on whether infarct size can be limited in humans and whether residual cardiac function and patient prognosis can thereby be improved.", 
    "50": "Although patients with acute inferior myocardial infarction often manifest S-T segment depression in precordial electrocardiographic leads, the pathophysiologic abnormalities associated with this finding are poorly understood. To examine this problem, electrocardiographic findings on admission were compared with results of radionuclide cineangiography performed within 38 hours of the onset of symptoms in 25 patients with inferior infarction. Summation of S-T depression in leads V1 through V4 permitted the separation of patients into two groups: Group A (11 patients with 0.20 mV or less of S-T depression) and Group B (14 patients with 0.45 vM or more of S-T depression). The radionuclide cineangiogram revealed inferior wall dysfunction in all patients. Additional posterolateral dysfunction was seen in 13 patients, all in Group B. Patients in Group B had a relatively larger infarction (peak creatine kinase Units - 756 +2- 358 in Group A versus 1,566 +/- 983 units in Group B, p less than 0.01) and greater functional impairment (ejection fraction - 45 +/- 12 in Group A versus 33 +/- 12 in Group B, p less than 0.01). The relation between precordial S-T segment depression and posterolateral dysfunction appears to be largely independent of electrocardiographic evidence of \"true posterior infarction.\" Thus moderate or severe anterior precordial S-T depression in patients with acute inferior infarction is a sensitive and specific indicator of relatively extensive myocardial damage, primarily involving the posterolateral region.", 
    "51": "The effects of a nonselective (isoproterenol), a beta-1 selective (prenalterol) and a beta-2-selective (procaterol) agonist on beta adrenoceptor occupancy, adenylate cyclase activity and muscle contractions in the myocardium (beta-1) and soleus muscle (beta-2) of the reserpine-pretreated cat were investigated. Each compound fully inhibited the specific binding of [125I] iodohydroxybenzylpindolol in both tissues. Myocardial and soleus muscle adenylate cyclase were equipotently activated by isoproterenol. Prenalterol and procaterol induced no more than marginal elevations in myocardial enzyme activity and only the latter compound produced an increase in soleus muscle adenylate cyclase activity (77% of that produced by isoproterenol). Prenalterol increased myocardial contractility (82% of that of isoproterenol) in a monophasic concentration-dependent manner, as did isoproterenol, whereas procaterol induced a biphasic inotropic response. The high affinity effect (23% of isoproterenol) of procaterol was selectively blocked by IPS 339 (beta-2-selective) and the low affinity component (70% of isoproterenol) was blocked by pamatolol (beta-1-selective). Isoproterenol and procaterol decreased subtetanic soleus muscle contractions equally, whereas prenalterol was devoid of effect in skeletal muscle. From the interrelations between the concentration-effect curves for these drug-induced responses, it was estimated that under the conditions used in these assays a full agonist in the heart has a spare beta-1 adrenoceptor pool of 80 to 90%. A corresponding beta-2 adrenoceptor reserve of 30 to 50% was derived from data obtained in the soleus muscle. On the basis of the present data, prenalterol may be characterized as a nonselective beta adrenoceptor ligand with beta-1 adrenoceptor partial agonistic activity.", 
    "52": "Prenalterol, a beta-adrenergic agonist, was given to nine patients with angiographically proved coronary artery disease. Subjects were studied during chronic beta-adrenergic blockade. The adequacy of blockade was assessed by the exercise heart rate response and by plasma concentrations of blocking agents. After incremental doses of 2.5 mg, 5.0 mg and 7.5 mg of prenalterol, heart rate was increased by 20%, 24% and 38%, respectively, and left ventricular dP/dt max by 55%, 73% and 61%, respectively. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures did not change significantly; pulmonary artery wedge pressure fell from 10 +/- 0.5 mm Hg to 7.1 +/- 0.9 and 6.7 +/- 0.7 mm Hg after 2.5 mg and 5.0 mg, respectively (p less than 0.01 for both). The net inotropic response to prenalterol was assessed, independent of the chronotropic response, using incremental atrial pacing before and after drug infusion. At identical heart rates, left ventricular dP/dt max increased by 40%, 49% and 48% after 2.5 mg, 5.0 mg and 7.5 mg, respectively. Left ventricular cineangiography before and after infusion showed an increase in ejection fraction from 0.73 +/- 0.02 to 0.83 +/- 0.03 (p less than 0.001). Plasma prenalterol concentration estimations demonstrated a clear, dose-related inotropic response, the level of response in each patient being largely determined by the degree of beta-adrenergic blockade at the time of the study.", 
    "53": "The possibility of beta-adrenoreceptor hypersensitivity after abrupt withdrawal of long-term therapy (8-18 months) with the slow-release (SR) formulation of oxprenolol (160-320 mg/day) was assessed in six patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. The chronotropic dose 25 of isoproterenol (the dose that increases the resting heart rate by 25 beats/min), plasma concentration of catecholamines, triiodothyronin and thyroxin, plasma renin activity and aldosterone, hemoglobin, hematocrit and oxyhemoglobin dissociation were measured on the last day of oxprenolol SR intake and 1, 2, 3, 6 and 13 days after abrupt replacement by identical placebo tablets. The chronotropic dose 25 of isoproterenol (microgram/m2), which was greater than 25.6 in all patients on the last day of oxprenolol SR, fell to 4.83 +/- 2.03 on the second day and to 3.50 on the third day after its abrupt withdrawal and reached a minimal value on the thirteenth day (2.78 +/- 0.30). Throughout the study, plasma concentrations of catecholamines, triiodothyronin and thyroxin and oxyhemoglobin dissociation remained unchanged. Plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone, which were suppressed during oxprenolol administration, rose significantly during placebo, coinciding with a significant fall in hematocrit and hemoglobin. No major subjective symptoms were reported by the patients. Thus, hypersensitivity of beta-adrenoreceptor-mediated responses was not demonstrated after sudden withdrawal of oxprenolol SR.", 
    "54": "Attenuation of exercise-induced increases in heart rate and cardiac output by chronic beta-adrenergic blockade has been thought to compromise benefit of exercise training in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). To assess this important issue, 35 CAD patients were evaluated by a 3-month walk-jog-cycle training program: 14 patients received no beta blocker (group 1), 14 received propranolol, 30-80 mg/day (group 2), and seven patients received propranolol, 120-240 mg/day (group 3). The extent of CAD, resting heart rate before training blood pressure and VO2 max were similar (p = NS) in each group. The maximal exercise heart rate (mean +/- SD, 147 +/- 21 beats/min in group 1 vs 120 +/- 10 beats/min in group 2 and 115 +/- 12 beats/min in group 3 (both p less than 0.05 vs group 1). The VO2 max before training was 25 +/- 5.0 ml/kg/min in group 1 vs 23 +/- 3.2 ml/kg/min in group 2 and 26 +/- 2.8 ml/Kg/min in group 3 (all p = NS). Training consisted of three 1-hour periods per week at a heart rate of 70-85% of the maximal pretraining heart rate. In each group, VO2 increased (p less than 0.05) after training: group 1, 27%; group 2, 30%; group 3, 46%. The double product was unchanged after training (p = NS) in each group. These data indicate that substantial training effects may be achieved in CAD patients despite therapeutic doses of beta blockers and a reduced training HR. Thus, there appears to be no indication to reduce beta blockers in CAD patients engaged in cardiac rehabilitation.", 
    "55": "We have studied the effects of a beta-adrenergic agonist and antagonist on transmucosal transport in the human jejunum and ileum in vivo. Using a triple lumen perfusion technique we have demonstrated that intravenous isoproterenol significantly increased absorption of sodium, chloride, and water in both the jejunum and ileum, and of potassium in the ileum. Beta blockade with intravenous propranolol significantly reduced jejunal electrolyte absorption and induced ileal water and sodium secretion. Isoproterenol reduced pressure wave activity in 6 of 8 subjects while propranolol was without any consistent motor effect. These results support a role for the beta-adrenergic division of the autonomic nervous system in the control of intestinal transport in humans.", 
    "56": "The effects of adrenergic agonists on acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthesis were studied in isolated rat hepatocytes from mature rats (300 to 350 g). Norepinephrine and phenylephrine inactivate acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity and inhibit fatty acid synthesis. The effects of both norepinephrine and phenylephrine were blocked by the alpha-adrenergic receptor blockers, phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine, and unaffected by the beta-receptor blocker propranolol. This inactivation was not mimicked by the beta-agonist isoproterenol. The measurable increase in cyclic AMP levels caused by norepinephrine and phenylephrine was abolished by the alpha-antagonist phentolamine and diminished by the beta-antagonist propranolol. Calcium depletion potentiated the increase in cyclic AMP levels by phenylephrine but abolished the phenylephrine inactivation of the carboxylase. The inactivation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase by phenylephrine was correlated with an increase in the incorporation of [32P]phosphate into the enzyme. Thus, catecholamines and their agonists promote phosphorylation and inactivation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase through the alpha-adrenergic receptor, and the inactivation requires calcium."
