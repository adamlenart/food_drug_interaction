    "1": "The 12-month period before and after the introduction of the measures were retrospectively reviewed. One hundred and sixty patients were discharged from the CCU with the diagnosis of myocardial infarction confirmed by ECG and enzyme criteria. Eighty patients had STEMI and fulfilled criteria for thrombolytic therapy at the time of presentation to hospital. A full data set was available on 35/38 of patients in the 12 months prior to the measures (Year 1), and 39/42 in the 12 months subsequent (Year 2).", 
    "2": "Median DTD time fell from 80 to 22 min after institution of the measures. Median Pain-to-Drug time also fell from 270 to 140 min. Thrombolytic agent given in the ED rose from 3% in Year 1, to 72% in Year 2. IV beta-blocker administered in the ED rose from 12% to 79%, resulting in median time to receiving IV beta-blocker falling from 63 to 19 min. Elevated ST segments resolved by >/=70% in <2 h in 53% of Year 2 patients, compared with 23% of Year 1 patients. Combined major in-hospital adverse clinical events were reduced from 49% to 15%.",

    "5": "A total of 120 postmenopausal women, aged 51 to 55 years, with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure [DBP] >/=95 and </=105 mm Hg) were enrolled. After a 4-week placebo period they were randomized to treatment with valsartan 80 mg (n = 60) or atenolol 50 mg (n = 60) once daily for 16 weeks, according to a parallel arm design. After 4 weeks of treatment the nonresponder patients (DBP >90 mm Hg) were given a double dose of each drug. Patients were checked at the end of the placebo period and every 4 weeks thereafter. At each visit, sitting blood pressure (BP) was measured by mercury sphygmomanometer (Korotkoff I and V). At baseline and after 16 weeks of treatment, patients were given a questionnaire that comprised 10 self-evaluations of various aspects of sexual desire, orgasmic response, and coital activity. The questions were presented in the form of a visual analog scale.", 
    "6": "Both drugs significantly lowered BP without any difference between the two treatments. In the valsartan-treated women, the scores for three of the items related to libido significantly improved: sexual desire (+38%, P <.01), changes in behavior (+45%, P <.001), and sexual fantasies (+51%, P <.001) In contrast, in the atenolol-treated group the scores for the items \"sexual desire\" and \"sexual fantasies\" significantly worsened (-18%, P <.01 and -23%, P <.001, respectively).", 
    "7": "These results suggest that in postmenopausal, sexually active hypertensive women, valsartan treatment improved sexual function at least in some respects, whereas atenolol worsened it.

    "9": "Patients with mild to moderate primary hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy were randomized in a double-blind fashion to treatment with either the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist irbesartan (n = 48) or the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor blocker atenolol (n = 49) as monotherapy. A microarray-based minisequencing system was used to genotype 30 SNPs in seven genes in the RAAS. These polymorphisms were related to the antihypertensive response after 12 weeks treatment.", 
    "10": "The BP reductions were similar in the atenolol and the irbesartan groups. Presence of the angiotensinogen (AGT) -6A allele or the AGT 235T allele were both associated with the most pronounced systolic BP response to atenolol treatment (P =.001 when -6 AA+AG was compared with GG and P =.008 for presence of the 235T variant compared with 235 MM).", 
    "11": "We found that SNPs in the angiotensinogen gene were associated with the BP lowering response to atenolol. This study is limited by a relatively small sample size, and the results should therefore be viewed as preliminary. Despite this limitation, these results illustrate the potential of using SNP genotyping as a pharmacogenetic tool in antihypertensive treatment.",

Atypical presentations were more likely in the elderly, with shortness of breath as the most common presentation (20.8% vs 5.4%; p < 0.001). The elderly were more likely to have complications of cardiac failure (65.3% vs 25%; p < 0.001) and cardiogenic shock (8.9% vs 0.9%; p = 0.006). The elderly were less likely to receive thrombolytic therapy (35.8% vs 64.8%; p < 0.001) as they were more likely to have contraindications (34.5% vs 6.8%; p = 0.002). The elderly were also less likely to receive beta-blockers (21.8% vs 60.7%; p < 0.001). In-hospital mortality was higher in the elderly (20.8% vs 2.7%; p < 0.001).

General use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction or with HF significantly reduced morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to assess how the specialists from Cardiology Department and Gastroenterology Department think that heart failure should be managed, how they implement their knowledge and if it is consistent with the recommendation of European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and whether differences exists in practice between specialists. In the first phase the specialists, cardiologists and diabetologists, answered the questions about the management of different stages of HF. In second phase we analysed medical documentation of 345 patients aged between 38 and 98 years, hospitalised in Cardiology and Gastroenterology Departments from October 2000 to February 2002 by reason of coronary artery disease, hypertension and dilated cardiomyopathy. In the third phase we compared the knowledge of heart failure management from questionnaire and its implementation, the compliance with ESC recommendation and finally whether differences in clinical practice exist between cardiologist and diabetologists.", 
    "17": "ACE-I were prescribed in all NYHA classes of HF. In over 50% patients in II NYHA class to 94% in IV NYHA class in Cardiology Department. Differences between the Departments in prescribing of ACE-I were observed. Beta-blockers (BB) were used with the same frequency in all NYHA classes, more often in Cardiology Department. Frequency of the administration of digoxin, diuretics, aldosterone receptor blocker was increasing starting with II NYHA class. The highest compliance between declarations from questionnaire and clinical practice concerned the use of BB and ACE-I combination.", 
    "18": "Hypertension is the major cause of congestive cardiac failure all over the world. It is under diagnosed and achievement of optimal therapy is difficult and costly. Diastolic dysfunction is an early poor prognostic factor in hypertension and is a reversible condition. Early detection and treatment is necessary to avoid cardiac complications. The objective of this study was to assess the occurrence of diastolic dysfunction in hypertensive patients referred for echocardiograph assessment of left ventricular function in a secondary hospital. It was also designed to determine whether contributing factors such as age, gender, systolic and diastolic pressure, duration of hypertension, previous myocardial infarct or ischemic heart disease and choice of anti-hypertensive drugs influence the development of diastolic dysfunction in these hypertensive patients. The analysis of diastolic dysfunction was based on the E/A ratio using Doppler echocardiogram. All of the patients were recruited from the Echocardiography Unit, Department of Medicine, Seremban General Hospital. Fifty patients with history of hypertension were selected for the study. Out of These 22 patients (44%) were found to have diastolic dysfunction; 39.1% of male patients (9 out of 23) and 48.1% of female patients (13 out of 27). Other contributing factors of diastolic dysfunction were found in patients : (a) with more than 8 years history of hypertension (12%) (b) with history of preexisting IHD/AMI (20%), (c) stages II - III of systolic hypertension based on 6th Joint National Committee recommendation (73%) (d) on ACE-inhibitor (18%) and (e) on Beta-blocker (28%) In conclusion, the study had demonstrated that the duration of hypertension, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and age of patients are important prognostic indicators in predicting the development of diastolic dysfunction in hypertensive patients.",

However, dopamine transport is a complex process involving substrate binding, translocation, release as well as transporter reorientation. The present study examines only the substrate recognition step by assessment of the potency of various dopamine-related compounds in inhibiting the binding of the cocaine analog [3H]2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane ([3H]WIN 35,428) to human dopamine transporters expressed in HEK-293 cells. alpha-Methylation of the side chain, the presence of the amine, and the 2-carbon-length of the side chain were found to be important for binding affinity, whereas beta-hydroxylation of the side chain and methoxylation at the phenyl ring generated weaker compounds. In addition, the presence of both m- and p-OH at the phenyl ring bestowed an increase in potency but the presence of p-OH alone a decrease. N-alkylation (propylation or methylation) had little or an even slightly beneficial effect on affinity, whereas alpha-carbonylation and alpha-methanoylation reduced affinity. Amino naphthalene compounds with a fused benzenoid ring system retained some potency consonant with the extended (i.e. beta-rotameric) trans (=anti) form of the side chain in dopamine when interacting with the transporter. In a second series of experiments, the interaction between dopamine and structural variants was assessed by monitoring the capability of a compound to shift the dopamine inhibition curve to the right as expected for a competitive inhibitor acting at the same site. Appreciable deviation from competitive interaction was observed by removal of the amine from the side chain, by alpha-carbonylation, and by alpha-methanoylation. Two blocker-type compounds, semi-rigid variants of cocaine, also displayed significant deviation. A substrate-based compound, inhibiting cocaine analog binding without interfering with dopamine recognition, could be a cocaine antagonist allowing conformational changes to occur during dopamine uptake.",

Immature rat testes were pre-incubated for 30 min in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer and incubated for 60 min in the presence of [14C]methylaminoisobutyric acid with and without T3 or T4 (dose-response curve). Specific channel blockers or chelating agents were added at different concentrations during pre-incubation and incubation periods to study the basal amino acid accumulation and a selected concentration of each drug was chosen to analyze the influence on the stimulatory hormone action. All amino acid accumulation experiments were carried out in a Dubnoff metabolic incubator at 32 degrees C, pH 7.4 and gassed with O2:CO2 (95:5; v/v). Seminiferous tubules from immature Sertoli cell-enriched testes were used for the electrophysiology experiments. Intracellular recording of the Sertoli cells was carried out in a chamber perfused with KRb with/without T3, T4 or blockers and the membrane potential was monitored. We found that T3 and T4 stimulated alpha-[1-14C] methylaminoisobutyric acid accumulation in immature rat testes and induced a membrane hyperpolarization in Sertoli cells. The action of T3 on amino acid accumulation and on the hyperpolarizing effect was inhibited by the K(+)-ATP channel blocker tolbutamide as well as the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil. These results clearly demonstrate for the first time the existence of an ionic mechanism related to Ca2+ and K+ fluxes in the rapid, nongenomic action of T3.",

The aim of the present study was to test whether alpha(2)-adrenoreceptor-mediated vasoconstriction was more sensitive to metabolic inhibition than alpha(1)-vasoconstriction during dynamic knee-extensor exercise. We studied healthy volunteers using two protocols: (1) wide dose ranges of the alpha-adrenoreceptor agonists phenylephrine (PE, alpha(1) selective) and BHT-933 (BHT, alpha(2) selective) were administered intra-arterially at rest and during 27 W knee-extensor exercise (n= 13); (2) flow-adjusted doses of PE (0.3 microg kg(-1) l(-1)) and BHT (15 microg kg(-1) l(-1)) were administered at rest and during ramped exercise (7 W to 37 W; n= 10). Ultrasound Doppler and thermodilution techniques provided direct measurements of femoral blood flow (FBF). PE (0.8 microg kg(-1)) and BHT (40 microg kg(-1)) produced comparable maximal reductions in FBF at rest (-58 +/- 6 versus-64 +/- 4%). Despite increasing the doses, PE (1.6 microg kg(-1) min(-1)) and BHT (80 microg kg(-1) min(-1)) caused significantly smaller changes in FBF during 27 W exercise (-13 +/- 4 versus-3 +/- 5%). During ramped exercise, significant vasoconstriction at lower intensities (7 and 17 W) was seen following PE (-16 +/- 5 and -16 +/- 4%), but not BHT (-2 +/- 4 and -4 +/- 5%). At the highest intensity (37 W), FBF was not significantly changed by either drug. Collectively, these data demonstrate metabolic inhibition of alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction in large postural muscles of healthy humans. Both alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenoreceptor agonists produce comparable vasoconstriction in the resting leg, and dynamic thigh exercise attenuates alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-mediated vasoconstriction similarly. However, alpha(2)-mediated vasoconstriction appears more sensitive to metabolic inhibition, because alpha(2) is completely inhibited even at low workloads, whereas alpha(1) becomes progressively inhibited with increasing workloads.",

These combine to create an unstable re-entrant polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) which can cause patients to suffer symptoms progressing from syncope to ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. Typically, torsades has a twisting morphological presentation on rhythm strips due to the irregularity of its re-entry pattern. The arrhythmia is more common in women. Intravenous magnesium is the initial emergency treatment in torsades. The case history illustrates the progressive acquisition of risk factors for drug induced torsades in a patient treated with sotalol following cardioversion. Typical progressive rhythm strip, electrocardiograph (ECG), and QT & corrected QT interval (QTc) interval changes occurring with the arrhythmia are presented.", 
    "63": "Amiodarone and sotalol are commonly used for the maintenance of sinus rhythm, but the efficacy of these agents administered as high-dose infusions for rapid conversion of atrial fibrillation is unknown. Use in this context would facilitate drug initiation in patients in whom ongoing prophylactic therapy is indicated.", 
    "64": "We assessed the efficacy and safety of rapid high-dose intravenous infusions of amiodarone and sotalol for heart rate control and rapid reversion to sinus rhythm in patients who came to the emergency department with recent-onset symptomatic atrial fibrillation. Patients (n = 140) were randomized to receive 1.5mg/kg of sotalol infused in 10 minutes, 10mg/kg of amiodarone in 30 minutes, or 500 microg of digoxin in 20 minutes. Electrical cardioversion was attempted for patients not converting to sinus rhythm within 12 hours.", 
    "65": "The rapid infusion of sotalol or amiodarone resulted in more rapid rate control than digoxin. Each of the 3 trial strategies resulted in similar rates of pharmacological conversion to sinus rhythm (amiodarone, 51%; sotalol, 44%; digoxin, 50%; P = not significant). The overall rates of cardioversion after trial drug infusion and defibrillation were high for all groups (amiodarone, 94%; sotalol, 95%,; digoxin, 98%; P = not significant), but there was a trend toward a higher incidence of serious adverse reactions in the amiodarone group.", 
    "66": "The rapid infusion of sotalol or amiodarone in patients with symptomatic recent-onset atrial fibrillation results in rapid control of ventricular rate. Even with high-dose rapid infusions, all 3 agents are associated with a poor overall reversion rate within 12 hours. Almost all patients were returned to sinus rhythm with a combination of pharmacological therapy and electrical cardioversion.", 
    "67": "Carvedilol therapy during congestive heart failure demonstrated a good efficacy in mortality rate reduction and in improvement of left ventricular (LV) systolic performance. However, currently there is not any finding about the drug's effect on diastolic filling. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of beta-blocker treatment on LV diastolic function with an eco-pulsed Doppler ultrasound scanning examination at transmitral level in a group of patients who were affected by heart failure with a restrictive filling pattern.", 
    "68": "We studied 27 patients with idiopathic or ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with LV severe systolic disfunction (ejection fraction <35%). Fourteen patients were randomized to receive carvedilol treatment (carvedilol group), and 13 patients continued to receive standard therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and vasodilators (placebo group). All patients underwent an echo-Doppler ultrasound scanning examination at the beginning of the study and after 4 and 12 months of treatment.", 
    "69": "In the carvedilol group, we found a progressive improvement of Doppler ultrasound scanning parameters after 4 months, with a significant increase of A wave (P <.005), deceleration time (DT; P <.02) and isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT; P <.02). These improvements were confirmed after 1 year of follow-up, whereas patients in the placebo group did not shown any significant modifications. After 1 year, the differences in these groups were more significant for A wave (39 +/- 4 cm/sec carvedilol group vs 30 +/- 4 cm/sec placebo group; P <.0001), for E/A ratio (1.8 +/- 0.2 carvedilol group vs 2.6 +/- 0.5 placebo group; P <.0002), for DT 1(40 +/- 16 msec carvedilol group vs 112 +/- 13 msec placebo group; P <.001), and for IVRT (74 +/- 8 msec carvedilol group vs 57 +/- 7 mesc placebo group; P <.0002). These changes seem to happen before systolic and morphological modifications.", 
    "70": "Our results show that carvedilol therapy is a means of modifying parameters of diastolic filling favorably in patients with heart failure. These effects seem to be independent of those of systolic function. The improvement of systolic performance occurs after 1 year of treatment. The restrictive filling pattern, related to an unfavorable prognosis, changes toward pseudonormal or altered relaxation pattern during carvedilol therapy. Further investigations with a greater sample size will be necessary to confirm our findings.", 
    "71": "Beta-blockers have been shown incontrovertibly to improve morbidity and survival in patients with heart failure. However, there is limited information regarding their use in clinical practice settings, and reasonable utilization targets for quality improvement initiatives have not been established.", 
    "72": "We identified 500 consecutive patients with chronic heart failure seen at a specialized outpatient heart failure clinic from March 2001 to May 2001, and retrospectively extracted clinical and drug information from an electronic medical record.", 
    "73": "In this cross-sectional analysis, the rate of beta-blocker utilization was 69%. Seventy-five percent of patients had at least tried a beta-blocker. Among those with beta-blockers initiated, 16% experienced side effects that led to drug discontinuation (9.1%) or down-titration (6.9%) that was similar across all NYHA classes. A lower utilization rate of beta-blockers was observed in patients of advanced age and those with diabetes mellitus, concomitant antiarrhythmic therapy, and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (P <.05). Respiratory disease remained the most common reason for withholding beta-blocker therapy, especially with severe obstructive (rather than restrictive) physiology.", 
    "74": "It appears that about 70% of patients with chronic heart failure can be successfully treated with a beta-blocker in a specialized heart failure outpatient setting where physicians are committed to beta-blocker use in heart failure. It is possible that subgroups with lower utilization rates can be targeted for quality improvement initiatives.", 
    "75": "Desflurane has been shown to increase sympathetic activity and heart rate (HR) in a concentration-dependent manner. Nevertheless, desflurane, like all other volatile anaesthetics, increased HR in parallel to vagal inhibition in a previous study. Therefore, our hypothesis is that desflurane elicits tachycardia by vagal inhibition rather than by activation of the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "76": "Six dogs were studied awake and during desflurane anaesthesia (1 and 2 MAC) alone, after pretreatment with propranolol (2 mg kg(-1) followed by 1 mg kg(-1) h(-1)), or after pre-treatment with atropine (0.1 mg kg(-1) followed by 0.05 mg kg(-1) h(-1)). The effects on HR and HR variability were compared by an analysis of variance (P < 0.05). HR variability was analysed in the frequency domain as power in the high-(0.15-0.5 Hz, vagal activity) and low-frequency range (0.04-0.15 Hz, sympathetic and vagal activity).", 
    "77": "HR increased during 2 MAC of desflurane from about 60 (awake) to 118 +/- 2 beats min(-1) (mean +/- SEM) in controls and to 106 +/- 3 beats min(-1) in dogs pre-treated with propranolol. In contrast, pretreatment with atropine increased HR from 64 +/- 2 to 147 +/- 5 beats min(-1) (awake) and HR decreased to 120 +/- 5 beats min(-1) after adding desflurane. High-frequency power correlated inversely with HR (r2 = 0.95/0.93) during desflurane alone and in the presence of beta-adrenoceptor blockade, with no significant difference between regression lines. There was no correlation between these variables during atropine/desflurane.", 
    "78": "The increase in HR elicited by desflurane mainly results from vagal inhibition and not from sympathetic activation.", 
    "79": "A primary care practice in the West of Scotland used clinical governance funding to develop a heart disease prevention clinic to target patients with existing heart disease. The practice nurse enlisted the help of the practice pharmacist and the protocol for the clinic was subsequently developed with the involvement of both practitioners.", 
    "80": "The aim of this project was to identify and offer health screening and appropriate disease modifying treatment to patients of a primary care (or general medical) practice suffering from cardiovascular heart disease in a clinic run jointly by a practice nurse and pharmacist.", 
    "81": "Patients identified by the practice pharmacist were offered a full health screen. Their clinical parameters were assessed and appropriate disease modifying drug therapy and lifestyle advice was offered in a review clinic with the practice nurse and pharmacist.", 
    "82": "The practice pharmacist identified over 212 patients over a 30-month period. A majority demonstrated hypertension (91%) and angina (89%), while over half (57%) had suffered a heart attack. Statin therapy was modified in a large number of patients (47%) and the number of patients with satisfactory total cholesterol levels has increased from 30% to 57% (P < 0.001). Aspirin and beta-blocker therapy has been initiated in a significant number of patients (53% and 26% respectively). Twelve patients (6%) stopped smoking; however, many 42% continued to smoke. The general medical doctors (GPs) who demonstrated a change in their own practice readily accepted changes to therapy recommended by the practice nurse and pharmacist. The practice pharmacist offset the additional cost of drug spend on statin therapy by making savings in other therapeutic areas.", 
    "83": "A secondary heart disease clinic can benefit patients by optimising drug and lifestyle therapy. While the inclusion of a pharmacist confers clinical and economic benefits.", 
    "84": "Sixty two patients with essential hypertension stage II were divided into two groups. 32 patients of group 1 received combined therapy including a course of inhalations of gas hypoxic mixture containing 10% oxygen and conventional medication (ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, diuretics). 30 patients of group 2 (controls) were given medication alone. 24-h monitoring of arterial pressure (AP) and echocardiography suggested that high AP variability (APV) in hypertensive subjects leads to more significant changes in left ventricular and atrial structure and function typical for hypertensive heart. In high VAP, its night values are subnormal while daytime values are high in patients on combined medication and hypoxic therapy. The patients on standard medication had significantly low VAP at night while their daytime VAP tended to decrease. VAP positively correlated with hypertensive load. In high VAP hypoxic and drug therapies are less effective.", 
    "85": "Effects of doxasozine and atenolol on hemodynamics and myocardial ischemia were studied in 20 males (mean age 52.5 +/- 5.3 years) who had survived macrofocal myocardial infarction associated with arterial hypertension stage I-II. The treatment efficacy was assessed clinically, by functional and radionuclide tests. A new long-acting alpha 1-adrenoblocker doxasozine was given in a mean dose 4-8 mg/day. A course of this treatment lowered systolic arterial pressure by 8.3% and diastolic one by 8.1%. As all the patients developed sinus tachycardia on day 5-10 of doxasozine treatment, the patients received additionally beta 1-adrenoblocker atenolol (12.5-25 mg/day) which adequately controlled heart rate. The combined therapy reduced frequency and severity of angina by 34.7%, 24-h need in nitroglycerine by 37.9%, exercise tolerance--by 18.4% as well as improved myocardial perfusion. Patients with concomitant benign prostatic hyperplasia showed attenuation of disuric disorders. Side effects (vertigo, anxiety) occurred in 3 cases (15%), but were not severe enough to demand the treatment discontinuation.", 
    "86": "The Telmisartan Effectiveness on Left ventricular MAss Reduction (TELMAR) trial will assess the effect of the angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor blocker, telmisartan, on left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) compared with the b-blocker, metoprolol, at similar antihypertensive doses. The rationale is that antihypertensives reduce LVH, a cardiac adaptation to pressure overload, principally by pressure-related effects. Ang II plays a key role in pressure-independent mechanisms causing LVH, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors induce more pronounced LVH regression than some other antihypertensives. Blocking Ang II Type 1 receptors may be more effective than ACE inhibition in reducing LVH. TELMAR is a prospective, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group trial. A total of 140 patients (age 18 80 years) with uncontrolled essential hypertension (mean daytime systolic blood pressure [SBP] >140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] >90 mmHg and/or night-time SBP >120 mmHg or DBP >70 mmHg, measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring [ABPM]) and left ventricular mass index related to height (LVMI) >0.8 g/cm for females, >1.1 g/cm for males (defined by magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) will be randomised to once-daily telmisartan or metoprolol. The telmisartan dose will be 40 mg for the first two weeks, 80 mg for 5.5 months and 40 mg for the last two weeks. Metoprolol will be given at a dose of 47.5 mg for two weeks, 95 mg for 5.5 months and 47.5 mg for two weeks. Concomitant add-on medication with hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine will be allowed. The primary endpoint is the percentage change in LVMI at treatment end versus baseline, using MRI. Secondary variables include blood pressure changes and response rates assessed by ABPM and manual cuff sphygmomanometry, and end-systolic wall stress, systolic left ventricular function (LVF) and diastolic LVF determined by MRI. A separate study was performed prior to the main trial to define the normal range of MRI data in an age-matched population.", 
    "87": "PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND THERAPY: Left ventricular hypertrophy represents an important factor determining the prognosis of hypertensive patients. Hypertrophy as identified by electrocardiography (Table 1) or echocardiography (Table 2) characterizes patients with a significantly increased risk of mortality and arrhythmia. From the pathophysiological point of view this is based on hypertrophy of the media in resistance vessels, on interstitial fibrosis, on a reduced coronary flow reserve and on the occurrence of ischemia (Figure 1). The diastolic and (later) systolic function of the heart are disturbed (Figures 2 to 4). Antihypertensive therapy with beta blockers and diuretics leads to a reduction of left ventricular mass by 5-8%, with ACE-inhibitors and AT-blockers by 13% (Figure 5). Particularly ACE-inhibitors can effectively reverse of the above mentioned pathological processes. Regression of hypertrophy goes along with an improved prognosis and a reduction of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias (Figure 6). A symptomatic treatment of arrhythmias should always be accompanied by medical therapy aimed at regression of hypertrophy. Optimal therapy results in normalizes of blood pressure, leads to a regression of hypertrophy and induces cardiac reparation, which in turn improve left ventricular function, reduces microvascular ischemia stress and arrhythmias. These therapeutic desiderates are also pertinent for hypertensive heart disease in the prehypertrophic state, as in juvenile hypertension.", 
    "88": "The role of diuretics in the treatment of arterial hypertension remains a matter of controversy. On the basis of the results of recent studies and economic considerations a broader use of diuretics in the initial antihypertensive therapy has been proposed. The present review analyses two aspects of diuretics which are of interest in this debate. Thus, several studies demonstrate that diuretic therapy is associated with a greater incidence of new-onset diabetes as compared to calcium channel blockers, ACE-inhibitors and AT(1)-antagonists. The clinical relevance of this effect becomes clear when calculating the \"numbers needed to treat\" (NNT) on the basis of a long-term therapy over several decades. Based on the assumption of linear increases in the incidence of diabetes over time NNT then become remarkably small and in some studies number < 10. Another problem associated with diuretics is the low compliance and persistence with this type of drugs established in \"real life\" studies in which patients were not disciplined by the study design. These characteristics of diuretic therapy of hypertensive patients challenge the proposed medical and also economic benefit of diuretics as compared to more \"modern\" antihypertensive agents.", 
    "89": "Aspects of care such as efficacy, effectiveness and efficiency have to be taken into account prior to the implementation of any new antihypertensive medication into routine medical care.", 
    "90": "The efficacy of angiotensin (AT) II antagonists in lowering blood pressure was summarized in a meta-analysis including 43 trials and a total of 11,281 patients. The four AT II antagonist classes losartan, valsartan, irbesartan, and candesartan were studied and achieved a mean reduction in systolic blood pressure between 10.4 und 11.8 mmHg and in diastolic blood pressure between 8.2 und 8.9 mmHg. The effectiveness of AT II antagonist therapy in reducing clinical events such as stroke or end-stage renal disease in hypertension and associated conditions was shown in a number of large trials. Also, less adverse events were reported for AT II antagonist therapy compared to other antihypertensive medication such as beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. However, the number of trials is still comparatively small. Several ongoing trials will provide further insight into the effectiveness of AT II antagonist therapy.", 
    "91": "The efficiency of AT II antagonist therapy in being a cost-effective alternative for reducing clinical events in patients with hypertension requires further research. The combination of data from clinical trials with epidemiologic data about the natural history of the disease and factors such as patient compliance, side effects, acquisition costs or medication switch is needed to reflect costs in the \"real-world\" situation.", 
    "92": "Hypertension is the most important risk factor for stroke and vascular dementia. Antihypertensive treatment reduces stroke risk by 40%. Most probably, all antihypertensive drugs are equally effective with the exception of alpha blockers. One study showed superiority of an angiotensin (AT) II antagonist versus beta blocker in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. Blood pressure is increased in many patients with acute stroke. In this phase, sudden drops in blood pressure should be avoided. All guidelines concerning antihypertensive treatment in acute stroke are not based on evidence. For secondary prevention, the combination of an angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and diuretic reduced strokes by 28% after transient ischemic attack (TIA) or a first stroke. Whether this is a drug-specific effect or due to lowering blood pressure per se is investigated at the moment. Antihypertensive treatment can reduce the incidence of vascular dementia and cognitive impairment.", 
    "93": "The objective of this study was to analyse the relationship of polymorphisms of the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene with the changes in microalbuminuria during 3 years of antihypertensive treatment in a group of young adults with essential hypertension.", 
    "94": "Essential hypertensives, less than 50 years old, never previously treated with antihypertensive drugs and in the absence of diabetes mellitus were included. After the initial evaluation, patients were treated using only nonpharmacological measures (n=23), only beta-blockers (n=26), only angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) (n=57) or a combination of treatments (n=25). The office blood pressure, biochemical profile and urinary albumin excretion (UAE) were measured at the beginning and then yearly. The polymorphism A-6G of the AGT gene located in the promoter region was analysed.", 
    "95": "In total, 131 patients, 35 (27%) microalbuminurics, were included. Although no significant differences in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), fasting glucose and UAE were observed among genotypes at the initial examination, during the 3 years of antihypertensive treatment the slope values for the DBP, fasting glucose and UAE differed significantly despite no differences in the distribution of treatments being present. The subjects carrying the AA-6 genotype had the largest DBP decrease, but the lowest UAE reduction and the highest slope of glucose. Out of 35 initially microalbuminuric patients, 24 became normoalbuminuric and the lowest reduction rates were observed in subjects who carried the allele A-6. No interaction between the type of treatment and genotype was observed on the changes in UAE, BP or glucose values. In the subset of 57 patients treated with ACEi, the changes in UAE, BP and glucose had the same trend as was observed in the total population.", 
    "96": "Subjects carrying the AA genotype of the A-6G AGT gene polymorphism are resistant to a reduction of microalbuminuria. Whether this can be attributed to a predisposition to glucose metabolic disturbance or not needs to be confirmed in further studies.", 
    "97": "This review describes the latest developments in the clinical usage of class III antiarrhythmics. It also discusses some new studies providing insight into the mechanism of action of these drugs.", 
    "98": "New data suggest that amiodarone is one of the most effective drugs for management of ventricular as well as supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. As over the years we have learned to deal with the toxic side effects of this drug, the risk of bradyarrhythmias requiring placement of a pacemaker is becoming more significant. Sotalol was approved for treatment of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter (AF). It was also found to be effective in management of postoperative AF. Dofetilide has been approved for the conversion and maintenance of sinus rhythm in AF; its role in ventricular arrhythmias remains unclear. Data are emerging regarding clinical efficacy of azimilide and dronedarone.", 
    "99": "Management of arrhythmias in patients with structural heart disease remains a challenge. Class III antiarrhythmics are the mainstay of treatment in this group of patients.", 
    "100": "Controlled trials for secondary prevention of sudden death--Antiarrhythmics Versus Implantable Defibrillators (AVID), Canadian Implantable Defibrillator Study (CIDS), and Cardiac Arrest Study Hamburg (CASH)--have been published and subanalyses of them provide useful clinical information on the outcome during the follow-up of this population.", 
    "101": "Results from a meta-analysis showed a significant risk reduction (RR) of 25 to 27% of total mortality (P < 0.001) and 50 to 52% of arrhythmic death (P < 0.001). Compared with amiodarone, patients treated with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in AVID had a maximal benefit in survival when the ejection fraction (EF) was between 20 and 34%. In CIDS, the group of higher risk (older than 70 years, EF less than 3.5%, and New York Heart Association class III-IV) presented a 50% RR of mortality. It has been demonstrated that the imbalance in beta-blocker use cannot explain the better survival in the ICD patients. After 3 years the recurrence of arrhythmia was 64% in the ICD group of the AVID trial. Patients enrolled after an episode of ventricular tachycardia were more likely to have appropriate therapy during follow-up. Older age, lower blood pressure, history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes, congestive heart failure, and prior pacemaker were parameters used for high-risk stratification. Conversely, inducibility of ventricular tachyarrhythmias on electrophysiology did not predict death.", 
    "102": "Patients with ICD after ventricular tachyarrhythmias have a 28% RR in total mortality. Individuals with EF between 20 to 34% received the highest benefit with ICD therapy.", 
    "103": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are commonly prescribed for the management of hypertension. In addition, each of these drug classes has been shown to be effective in the treatment of congestive heart failure, proteinuric chronic kidney disease, and most recently the high-cardiac-risk profile patient. The individual success of each of these drug classes has fueled the theory that given together, the overall biologic effect of both would surpass that of either given alone. The foundation of this premise, although biologically plausible, has yet to be proven in a compelling enough fashion to support the everyday use of these two drug classes in combination. Additional clarifying studies are required to establish whether specific patient subsets exist that might benefit from such combination therapy.", 
    "104": "The effect of protein kinase C (PKC) activation on beta1-adrenergic receptor (beta1-AR) regulation of the cardiac L-type Ca2+ current (ICa,L) was studied using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. Treatment of guinea pig ventricular myocytes with phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) caused a significant decrease in ICa,L sensitivity to stimulation by submaximal beta1-AR activation using isoproterenol (Iso). This decrease in sensitivity was also associated with the ability of higher concentrations of Iso to directly inhibit the stimulatory response. PDBu treatment produced similar effects on H2 histamine receptor-mediated ICa,L responses. In the presence of PDBu, higher concentrations of Iso inhibited the histamine stimulated ICa,L, and this effect was blocked by a selective beta1-AR antagonist. Higher concentrations of histamine also inhibited the Iso stimulated ICa,L, and this effect was blocked by a selective H2 receptor antagonist. The effects of PDBu were blocked by the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I, and they were not mimicked by the inactive phorbol ester 4alpha-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate. The inhibitory effects of Iso and histamine were significantly reduced when Gi/o mediated responses were blocked with pertussis toxin. These results suggest that PKC promotes coupling of cardiac beta1-adrenergic and H2 histamine receptors to Gi/o mediated inhibitory responses.", 
    "105": "The hemodynamic response to ss-blockers alone or with nitrates is highly predictive of efficacy in prevention of variceal bleeding. Hemodynamic monitoring (HDM) requires catheterization of the hepatic vein and measurement of the hepatic venous pressure gradient, the difference between wedged and free hepatic venous pressure. The aim of this study was to compare HDM with no HDM in patients considered for primary pharmacoprophylaxis of esophageal variceal bleeding.", 
    "106": "A decision model was constructed to compare HDM with no HDM in cirrhotic patients with moderate to large esophageal varices. Patients intolerant to beta-blocker therapy would undergo endoscopic variceal ligation; those with an inadequate hemodynamic response (HDR) to beta-blocker therapy could have nitrates added before ligation was considered. Variceal bleeding was treated with ligation, with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) reserved for refractory bleeding. Probabilities of treatment responses as well as risks of bleeding and mortality were based on published literature. Only direct costs were considered during the 5-yr time horizon. Outcomes were cost in United States dollars, survival length in life-years, and proportions of patients who experienced variceal bleeding, TIPS insertion, and mortality from any cause.", 
    "107": "In the base case analysis, HDM was either cost-saving ($2,523 US dollars /life-year gained) or cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $5,200 US dollars/life-year saved) compared with no HDM, depending on whether nitrates were added to beta-blocker therapy. HDM reduced variceal bleeding by nearly 60% and had a small effect on all-cause mortality. In the sensitivity analysis, HDM was sensitive to the time horizon, as it was not cost-effective for a time horizon of <22 months and was not cost-saving before 49 months. The cost-effectiveness of HDM was not sensitive to reasonable variation in the probability of HDR to beta-blocker therapy, risk of bleeding, risk reduction with pharmacotherapy, or to the costs of HDM, bleeding, ligation, or TIPS. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that HDM was more effective and less costly 100% and 57% of the time, respectively.", 
    "108": "Compared with the current standard of no HDM, measuring the hemodynamic response of primary pharmacoprophylaxis substantially reduces the number of bleeding episodes and is cost-effective or cost-saving over a wide range of sensitivity analyses. A randomized trial of HDM is needed to verify its efficacy in clinical practice.", 
    "109": "Based on a series of clinical trials showing no difference in the effectiveness or tolerability of most major classes of antihypertensive medications, the Joint National Commission on High Blood Pressure Treatment recommends that physicians prescribe beta-blockers or diuretics as initial hypertensive therapy unless there are compelling indications for another type of medication. Nevertheless, many physicians continue to favor more expensive medications like angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium channel blockers as first line agents. The persistent use of these agents raises questions as to whether physicians perceive ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers to be better than beta-blockers and diuretics.", 
    "110": "We surveyed 1,200 primary care physicians in 1997, and another 500 primary care physicians in 2000, and asked them to estimate the relative effectiveness and side effects of 4 classes of medication in treating a hypothetical patient with uncomplicated hypertension: ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics. In addition, we asked them to indicate whether they ever provided free samples of hypertension medications to their patients.", 
    "111": "Perceptions of the relative effectiveness and side effects of the 4 classes of hypertension medications did not significantly change over the 3 years, nor did prescription recommendations. Physicians perceive that diuretics are less effective at lowering blood pressure than the other 3 classes (P <.001). They also perceive that beta-blockers are less tolerated than the other 3 classes (P <.001). In a multivariate model, perceptions of effectiveness and tolerability displayed significant associations with prescription preference independent of background variables. The only other variable to contribute significantly to the model was provision of free medication samples to patients.", 
    "112": "Despite numerous clinical trials showing no difference in the effectiveness or side-effect profiles of these 4 classes of drugs, most physicians believed that diuretics were less effective and beta-blockers were less tolerated than other medications. Moreover, their prescription practices were associated with their provision of free samples provided by pharmaceutical representatives, even after adjusting for other demographic characteristics. Efforts to increase physicians' prescribing of beta-blockers and diuretics may need to be directed at overcoming misunderstandings about the effectiveness and tolerability of these medicines.", 
    "113": "To study the awareness of the nature of the disease, compliance with treatment, and prevalence of systemic symptoms in a group of patients with chronic open angle glaucoma (COAG).", 
    "114": "A structured questionnaire was designed and given to 260 consecutive COAG patients attending a general ophthalmology clinic. Questions related to the increased risk of COAG amongst family members, screening of family members, nature of field defects, variation in IOP, topical treatment and availability of a free eye test for a COAG patient in the UK were asked. Compliance and systemic symptoms were also assessed.", 
    "115": "Forty-one per cent (107 of 260) of patients in the study group were aware of the increased risk of COAG in family members and 45.5% (118 of 260) of patient's family members had undergone screening for COAG. Seventy-three per cent (191 of 260) of the patients were aware of their own and their family members' entitlement to a free eye test. Seventy-seven per cent of patients claimed full compliance. Thirty per cent of patients were noted to have systemic symptoms.", 
    "116": "The awareness of the nature of COAG in this population was low and incidence of perceived drug related systemic symptoms very high. Both of these may contribute to poor compliance.", 
    "117": "Patients with coronary artery disease presenting for major noncardiac surgery may have indications for both peri-operative beta-blockade and haemodynamic optimisation. The combination of peri-operative cardiorespiratory failure and myocardial ischaemia has a grave prognosis. Recent investigations have shown that in patients with coronary artery disease, beta-blockade does not depress cardiac output as much as originally thought. There may, therefore, be a place for both peri-operative beta-blockade and haemodynamic optimisation. The indications for peri-operative beta-blockade and haemodynamic optimisation, the effect of acute beta-blockade on cardiac output in patients with coronary artery disease, and the interaction of peri-operative beta-blockade and haemodynamic optimisation are discussed.", 
    "118": "The present study was undertaken in order to further clarify putative role of the adrenergic innervation in the regulation of the intrathymic T-cell maturation. For this purpose adult male DA rats were subjected to either 4-day- or 16-day-long propranolol treatment (0.40 mg propranolol/100 g/day, s.c.) and the expression of CD4/8/TCRalphabeta on thymocytes, as well as thymocyte proliferative and apoptotic index, was assessed in these animals by flow cytometric analysis. Propranolol treatment, in spite of duration, increased both the thymocyte proliferative and apoptotic index (vs. respective vehicle-treated controls). In 4-day-treated animals the thymus cellularity and thymus weight remained unaltered, while in 16-day-treated rats the values of both of these parameters were reduced (since increase in the thymocyte apoptotic index overcame that in the proliferative index). The treatments of both durations affected the thymocyte phenotypic profile in a similar pattern, but the changes were more pronounced in rats exposed to the treatment of longer duration. The relative proportion of the least mature CD4-8- double negative (DN) TCRalphabeta- cells was increased, those of thymocytes at distinct differentiational stages on the transitional route to the CD4+8+ double positive (DP) TCRalphabetalow stage decreased (all subsets of TCRalphabeta- in both groups of rats, and those with low expression of TCRalphabeta in rats subjected to 16-day-long treatment) or unaltered (all subsets of TCRalphabetalow cells in 4-day-treated rats). Furthermore, the percentage of CD4+8+ DP TCRalphabetalow cells was significantly elevated, as well as those of the most mature CD4+8- TCRalphabetahigh and CD4-8+ TCRalphabetahigh cells (the increase in the percentage of former was much more conspicuous than that of the latter), while the relative proportion of their direct detectable precursors (CD4+8+ DP TCRalphabetahigh) was reduced. Thus, the present study: i) further supports notion of pharmacological manipulation of adrenergic action as an efficient means in modulation of the T-cell development, and hence T-cell-dependent immune response, and ii) provides more specific insight into T-cell maturation sequence point/s particularly sensitive to beta-adrenoceptor ligand action.", 
    "119": "The Carvedilol or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET; Lancet 2003; 362:7-13) found that in patients with heart failure, survival appears to be better with carvedilol than with immediate-release metoprolol tartrate. Whether the target doses used were equivalent (carvedilol 25 mg twice daily vs metoprolol tartrate 50 mg twice daily) has been debated, but the COMET trial shows that drugs in the same class do not necessarily have the same effects. Given the overwhelming evidence of the benefit of carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, and bisoprolol in patients with heart failure, we should all strive to increase the use of these drugs in appropriate doses.", 
    "120": "Dosages of beta-adrenergic blockers prescribed after myocardial infarction (MI) in a Veterans Affairs medical center were reviewed to determine if dosages were adjusted to target dosages used in clinical trials. The medical records of all patients with a discharge diagnosis of MI were reviewed. The target dosage, selected from major clinical trials, was atenolol 100 mg/day p.o., metoprolol tartrate 200 mg/day p.o., or propranolol 180-240 mg/day p.o. A systolic blood pressure of < or = 100 mm Hg and pulse rate of < or = 50 beats/min were defined as the clinical markers of the maximum tolerated beta-blocker dosage. A discharge diagnosis of MI was identified in 396 patients between January 1999 and December 2000, and 106 patients met the inclusion criteria. The patients had a mean +/- S.D. age of 66.3 +/- 10.7 years, 98% were men, and all received either atenolol or metoprolol. The mean +/- S.D. systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate on admission were 135 +/- 30 and 75 +/- 18 mm Hg and 80 +/- 20 beats/min, respectively. The mean +/- S.D. dosages for atenolol and metoprolol were 54 +/- 39 and 90 +/- 77 mg/day at the time of discharge, 54 +/- 38 and 95 +/- 81 mg/day at 6 months after discharge, and 53 +/- 40 and 82 +/- 80 mg/day at 12 months, respectively. Only 15% of the patients reached the target dosage, as defined in clinical trials, of a beta-blocker. No reason for maintaining the beta-blocker dosage was documented for 65% of the patients. Beta-blockers were prescribed frequently after MI but usually were not used at dosages that matched those in clinical trials.",

Herein, we report two episodes of anuria and acute pulmonary edema associated with losartan treatment in a hypertensive patient with preexisting severe renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney. After successful percutaneous renal balloon angioplasty procedure, urine flow was started immediately, despite 10 days of anuria. Blood pressure measurements were still at acceptable levels with a low dose Beta blocker, and serum creatinine levels were normal even after eight months. PTRA should be done in such patients, even with prolonged anuria. Physicians who recommend angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with RAS, especially in patients wih hypovolemia or a solitary kidney, should be careful about this complication.",

All patients were symptomatic, with syncope being the most common symptom. The average age when the first symptoms occurred was 17.9 +/- 15.6 (range, 0.5-62) years; 55.6% of them had the first symptoms before the age of 20. The most common triggers of the symptoms were physical exercise or emotional stress. The average corrected QT interval was 0.55 +/- 0.08 s. Using ECG criteria, there were 14 (25.9%) LQT1 patients, 28 (51.9%) LQT2, and 2 (3.7%) LQT3. Thirty (55.6%) patients were treated with Beta-blockers at the time of enrollment, with propranolol being the most commonly used drug, with an average daily dose of 57.5 +/- 39.1 mg. Four patients underwent left cardiac sympathectomy. After an average follow-up of 24.9 +/- 13.2 months, 3.1% (1/32) of patients with antiadrenergic therapy and 9.1% (2/22) without antiadrengergic therapy died of sudden cardiac death ( P < 0.05). We concluded that LQT2 might be the most common subtype in these patients. Antiadrenergic treatment was underused, raising the urgent need for educating both physicians and patients on the nature of the disease and its optimal antiadrenergic therapy.",

Target blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension are levels < or = 140/90 mmHg. In patients with essential hypertension and concomitant diabetes mellitus type 2, blood pressure should be lowered to < or = 130/80 mmHg. Diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enyzme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin I (AT(1)) antagonists may nowadays be regarded as drugs of first choice in the treatment of essential hypertension. The Joint National Committee in the USA recommends to start treatment with a thiazide diuretic. A Guidelines Committee of European Society of Hypertension-European Society of Cardiology considers the Endgroups of drugs mentioned above to be equally suitable for the initiation and maintenance of antihypertensive therapy. Both groups of experts agree that in the majority of patients with essential hypertension, a combination of two or more drugs is required to reach target blood pressure. Both groups of experts emphasize that the main benefits of antihypertensive therapy are due to decreasing blood pressure per se.",

Variables that described quality in Phase I were abstracted for Phase II and data describing the new variables of beta-blocker use and lipid management were collected. Data samples collected onsite by participating hospitals were used for rapid cycle improvement in Phase II.",

During Phase II, use of beta-blockers before, during, or after CABG increased from 65% to 76% of patients (P < 0.05). Appropriate lipid management, an aggregate variable, occurred in 91% of patients before and 91% after the educational intervention. However, there were improvements in 3 of 5 subcategories for lipid management (documenting a lipid disorder [52%-57%], initiating drug therapy [45%-53%], and dietary counseling [74%-91%]; P < 0.05).",

    "128": "The effects of pretreatment with cariporide on myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias in a rat model of ischemia/reperfusion were compared with those of nicorandil, propranolol, and nifedipine. Each drug was administered intravenously before coronary occlusion. Cariporide at 0.1, 0.3, and 1 mg/kg significantly reduced the infarct size (infarct mass/risk mass) from 28 +/- 4% (vehicle control value) to 9 +/- 3, 9 +/- 3, and 5 +/- 2%, respectively. Propranolol at 2.5 mg/kg also significantly reduced the infarct size to 11 +/- 1%. Neither nicorandil nor nifedipine was effective when given at 0.1 mg/kg. Cariporide dose dependently decreased the number of ischemia-induced ventricular premature beats (VPB), incidence and duration of ventricular tachycardia, and the number of reperfusion-induced VPB. Nicorandil was effective against only VPB after reperfusion, and propranolol reduced only postischemic arrhythmias, but nifedipine had no effect on either type of arrhythmia. In summary, cariporide reduced the infarct size and dose dependently suppressed arrhythmias induced by ischemia/reperfusion in rats. In contrast, in the present rat model, the doses of the other three drugs used in this study did not show comparable effects.", 
    "129": "The development of pharmacologic agents that directly inhibit the angiotensin II receptor (angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]) has provided clinicians with an alternative to the previously available angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) to downregulate the renin-angiotensin system. This review focuses on the available data that can guide the clinician to the use of these two classes of agents vis \u00e0 vis their ability to provide cardiovascular (CV) and renal protection. Although the CV protective effect of ACEI in high-risk populations is widely appreciated, whether such an effect is entirely BP independent can be questioned. Most head-to-head comparisons between ACEI and ARB have yielded comparable CV protective effects, with ARB being associated with fewer adverse effects. Likewise, several-but not all-studies have demonstrated a CV protective effect of ACEI when compared with other active agents in patients with type 2 diabetes. One study demonstrated a similar protection with ARB when compared with a beta blocker. In terms of renal protection, there are ample data to support a role for both ACEI and ARB to prevent the progression from microalbuminuria to overt albuminuria in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. However, when progression of renal disease is used as an end point, protection has been demonstrated with ACEI only for type 1 but not type 2 diabetes. In this latter group, only ARB have been shown to slow progression to ESRD.",

    "132": "Respiratory exchange and [1-(13)C]palmitate were used to trace lipid oxidation and FFA turnover in 8 healthy, young men for 90 min before and 240 min after ingestion of placebo, caffeine (10 mg/kg), or caffeine during beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "133": "During fasting conditions, there were few differences in measured variables between the 3 tests. During steady state conditions (last hour of the test) after ingestion of caffeine, lipid turnover increased 2-fold (P < 0.005), and the mean (+/-SEM) thermic effect was 13.3 +/- 2.2% (P < 0.001), both of which were greater than after ingestion of placebo or caffeine during beta-adrenoceptor blockade. After ingestion of caffeine, oxidative FFA disposal increased 44% (236 +/- 21 to 340 +/- 16 micro mol/min), whereas nonoxidative FFA disposal increased 2.3-fold (455 +/- 66 to 1054 +/- 242 micro mol/min; P < 0.01). In postabsorptive conditions, 34% of lipids were oxidized and 66% were recycled. Caffeine ingestion increased energy expenditure 13% and doubled the turnover of lipids, of which 24% were oxidized and 76% were recycled. beta-Adrenoceptor blockade decreased, but did not inhibit, these variables.",

The effect of caffeine on lipid mobilization in resting conditions can be interpreted in 2 ways: lipid mobilization alone is insufficient to drive lipid oxidation, or large increments in lipid turnover result in small increments in lipid oxidation.", 
    "135": "Carvedilol, a new beta-blocker with antioxidant properties, has been shown to be cardioprotective in experimental models of myocardial damage. We investigated whether carvedilol protects against experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) because of its suppression of inflammatory cytokines and its antioxidant properties. We orally administered a vehicle, various doses of carvedilol, racemic carvedilol [R(+)-carvedilol, an enantiomer of carvedilol without beta-blocking activity], metoprolol, or propranolol to rats with EAM induced by porcine myosin for 3 wk. Echocardiographic study showed that the three beta-blockers, except R(+)-carvedilol, suppressed left ventricular fractional shortening and decreased heart rates to the same extent. Carvedilol and R(+)-carvedilol, but not metoprolol or propranolol, markedly reduced the severity of myocarditis at the two different doses and suppressed thickening of the left ventricular posterior wall in rats with EAM. Only carvedilol suppressed myocardial mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines and IL-1beta protein expression in myocarditis. In addition, carvedilol and R(+)-carvedilol decreased myocardial protein carbonyl contents and myocardial thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance products in rats with EAM. The in vitro study showed that carvedilol and R(+)-carvedilol suppressed IL-1beta production in LPS-stimulated U937 cells and that carvedilol and R(+)-carvedilol, but not metoprolol or propranolol, suppressed thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance products in myocardial membrane challenged by oxidative stress. It was also confirmed that probucol, an antioxidant, ameliorated EAM in vivo. Carvedilol protects against acute EAM in rats, and the superior cardioprotective effect of carvedilol compared with metoprolol and propranolol may be due to suppression of inflammatory cytokines associated with the antioxidant properties in addition to the hemodynamic modifications.", 
    "136": "The synthesis of four novel analogues of metoprolol, a well-known beta1-blocker used to reduce arterial blood pressure, is described. The preparation of (2S,2'S)-7, (2R,2'S)-7, (2R,2'R)-8, and (2S,2'R)-8 was based on the reaction of racemic 2-[4-(2'-methoxyethyl)-phenoxymethyl]-oxirane (4) with (R)- or (S)-2-amino-1-butanol. Salient characteristics of analogues 7 and 8 relative to metoprolol are the incorporation of an additional stereogenic center, as well as a methyl group and a hydroxyl function on the nitrogen-containing chain. These novel derivatives present significant hypotensive and bradycardiac activity, although no blocking action toward beta1 and beta2 adrenergic receptor.", 
    "137": "The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of the inhaled budesonide, sustained-release theophylline and montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, in patients with mild persistent asthma. In this single-center, randomized, parallel-group study that not designed blindly and placebo-controlled manner, 74 patients with mild persistent asthma were treated with either inhaled budesonide 400 microg once daily, oral montelukast 10 mg once daily, or sustained-release theophylline 400 mg once daily for 3 months. In all three treatment groups, improvements were attained in overall asthma control. Asthma symptom scores and supplemental beta2-agonist use were quite the same in all three treatment groups (P>0.05). Although inhaled budesonide group resulted in significantly greater improvements compared with the other two groups in the lung functions (P<0.05), the changes in FEV1 and PEF are within the baseline variability and there was no statistically significant difference among the groups when analyzed by treatment month (P>0.05). Exacerbations of asthma were experienced by 16% of the patients in the montekulast group, by 12.5% of the patients in the theophylline group, and by none of the patients in the budesonide group. The adverse event in each of the three groups was 12%, 16% and 16.7%, respectively. It is concluded that the most important clinical parameters do not point that one of the treatments is more effective than others. Treatment with inhaled corticosteroid is preferred, but sustained-release theophylline and leukotriene antagonists are alternative controller medications in mild persistent asthma.", 
    "138": "We analyzed the expression of connexin(Cx)43 in proliferating and differentiating C(2)C(12) cells and in myoblasts obtained from newborn mice. Cx43 was present in both cell types and under both conditions. The functional role of gap junctional communication (GJC) during terminal differentiation was evaluated in C(2)C(12) myoblasts in the presence or absence of the gap junction blocker 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid (beta-GA). Differentiation was temporally analyzed through myogenin expression, activity of creatine kinase (CK), and yield of multinucleated cells. In cells treated with beta-GA, the CK activity and myotube formation were reversibly blocked. While in control cultures positive myogenin expression was seen in cell clusters, in beta-GA treated cultures the myogenin immunoreactivity was detected in few, preferentially sparse cells. The role of Cx43 during terminal differentiation was evaluated in cultures of myoblasts obtained from Cx43(Cre-ER(T)/fl) transgenic mice. Inducible deletion of Cx43 was obtained upon activation of Cre-ER(T) via 4-OH-tamoxifen applications. Cx43 deletion led to a drastic decrease in myogenin expression at 24 h of differentiation as compared to myoblasts from control mice. Our results indicate that Cx43-containing gap junctions are required for normal skeletal muscle terminal differentiation. These channels might provide a pathway for the intercellular transfer of signals involved in myogenesis.", 
    "139": "Osteocytes embedded in the matrix of bone are mechanosensory cells that translate strain into signals and regulate bone remodeling. Our previous studies using osteocyte-like MLO-Y4 cells have shown that fluid flow shear stress (FFSS) increases connexin (Cx) 43 protein expression, prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) release, and intercellular coupling, and PGE(2) is an essential mediator between FFSS and gap junctions. However, the role of Cx43 in the release of PGE(2) in response to FFSS is unknown. Here, the FFSS-loaded MLO-Y4 cells with no or few intercellular channels released significantly more PGE(2) per cell than those cells at higher densities. Antisense Cx43 oligonucleotides and 18 beta-glycyrrhetinic acid, a specific gap junction and hemichannel blocker, significantly reduced PGE(2) release by FFSS at all cell densities tested, especially cells at the lowest density without gap junctions. FFSS, fluid flow-conditioned medium, and PGE(2) increased the activity of dye uptake. Moreover, FFSS induced Cx43 to migrate to the surface of the cell; this surface expressed Cx43 developed resistance to Triton-X-100 solublization. Our results suggest that hemichannels formed by Cx43, instead of intercellular channels, are likely to play a predominant role in the release of intracellular PGE(2) in response to FFSS.",

Women (n = 593) were compared with men (n = 2,115). Mean follow-up period was two years.", 
    "143": "Significant differences in baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics were found. Women were younger, more likely to be black, had a higher prevalence of nonischemic etiology, higher right and left ventricular ejection fraction, higher heart rate, greater cardiothoracic ratio, higher prevalence of left bundle branch block, lower prevalence of atrial fibrillation, and lower plasma norepinephrine level. Ischemic etiology and measures of severity of HF were found to be predictors of prognosis in women and men. However, differences in the predictive values of various variables were noted; most notably, coronary artery disease and LVEF appear to be stronger predictors of prognosis in women. In the nonischemic patients, women had a significantly better survival rate compared with men.",

    "145": "Carvedilol and metoprolol are beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists that decrease mortality in heart failure. It is not clear whether the ancillary properties, which carvedilol has but metoprolol does not have, contribute to the beneficial effect. The Carvedilol Or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET) compared metoprolol tartrate (mean daily dose 85 mg) and carvedilol (41.8 mg) in patients with heart failure. All-cause mortality was less in the carvedilol than the metoprolol group, indicating that at these doses, carvedilol has a mortality benefit over metoprolol. However, the beta(1)-adrenoceptor blocking activity of metoprolol tartrate (assessed by a decrease in heart rate) was slightly less than with carvedilol in COMET and less than that observed in previous mortality studies with metoprolol, suggesting that the use of metoprolol tartrate was not optimal in COMET.", 
    "146": "Heart failure (HF) still has a discouraging prognosis. Therapeutic strategies aim to reduce mortality as well as slow the progression of the disease, improve symptoms and reduce the frequency of hospital admission. Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a hallmark of several cardiocirculatory diseases, including HF. Drugs for evidence-based therapy of HF are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), beta-blockers and aldosterone antagonists. A promising alternative is a more complete action on the RAAS through selective blockade of the angiotensin type 1 (AT(1)) receptors, taking into account not only physiopathological issues but also pharmacological, experimental and clinical data. The effect of valsartan, an orally-active, selective antagonist of AT(1) receptors, on the outcome in patients with chronic and symptomatic HF was evaluated in a large-scale, international, placebo-controlled clinical study, the Valsartan in Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT). In this study, overall mortality was similar in the valsartan and placebo groups (19.7 and 19.4%, respectively). However, valsartan, in addition to recommended therapy of HF including an ACEI, significantly reduced the combined end point of mortality and morbidity, with a significant reduction in the risk of hospitalisation, paralleled by improvements in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, signs and symptoms and quality of life. Valsartan also improved left ventricular anatomy and function and significantly reduced neurohormonal activation. These results were confirmed and extended by the CHARM trial, where the benefits of candesartan were proved not only in all 7599 patients with HF, but also in the 2548 given an ACEI, the 2028 not given an ACEI and in the 3023 patients with an ejection fraction of > 40%. In conclusion, the first choice for HF remains an ACEI with a beta-blocker, but two new options are emerging. In patients intolerant to ACEI, the combination of valsartan or candesartan with a beta-blocker is proposed, whereas an ACEI with either valsartan or candesartan can be considered in patients intolerant to or with contraindications to beta-blockers.", 
    "147": "In hypertensive diabetic patients, reducing blood pressure is among the best evaluated and most effective interventions for lowering mortality and morbidity. First line antihypertensive agents are: chlorthalidone or other thiazide-type diuretics, beta-blockers and ACE-inhibitors. In type 2 diabetic patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, the ARB Cosaar has been proven to be effective. To achieve an effective blood pressure reduction, a combination of different antihypertensive agents is necessary for most patients. Specially structured patient education programmes are another effective means of achieving this goal.",

The low-dose perindopril/indapamide (PER/IND) combination (2 mg and 0.625 mg, respectively) daily resulted in a significantly better blood pressure control and systolic blood pressure decrease. In addition, the low-dose PER/IND combination showed superior efficacy/safety criteria than the sequential strategy of atenolol (50 mg) then losartan (50 mg) then amlodipine (5 mg), and the step-by-step strategy of valsartan (40 mg then 80 mg then 80 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg).",

    "150": "Sustained ventricular tachycardia was induced by programmed stimulation in dogs 4 days after left anterior coronary artery occlusion and reentrant circuits in the epicardial border zone (EBZ) mapped. The effects of the beta receptor-blocking drug, esmolol, the potassium channel-blocking drug d-sotalol, which lacks beta receptor-blocking effects, and the combination of the two drugs on the reentrant circuits that cause tachycardia were determined. Esmolol did not alter the ability to induce tachycardia. Small changes in the location or extent of lines of block in reentrant circuits accounted for small decreases or increases in tachycardia cycle lengths. d-Sotalol prolonged the lines of block in reentrant circuits, slowed propagation around the circuits, and prolonged tachycardia cycle length, but it did not stop tachycardia or prevent the induction of tachycardia. The combination of esmolol and d-sotalol prevented the initiation of sustained tachycardia. The stimulated premature impulse either blocked before reentering or traversed the circuit several times prior to blocking in a region of fractionated electrograms. The addition of esmolol to d-sotalol abolished the reverse use-dependent effects of d-sotalol alone on effective refractory period (ERP) and significantly prolonged ERP in the area of the reentrant circuit.",

    "152": "A significant increase in solubility and dissolution rate of nitrendipine, a slightly soluble calcium channel blocker, was achieved by inclusion complexation with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD). The inclusion complex was prepared by solvent evaporation method and characterized by phase solubility method, x-ray diffractometry, infrared spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. The solubility of nitrendipine increased linearly as a function of HP-beta-CD concentration, resulting in AL-type phase solubility diagram which revealed a formation of inclusion complex in a molar ratio of 1:1, with the apparent association constant of 108.3M(-1). The in vitro dissolution rate of nitrendipine in pH 7.4 phosphate buffer was in the order of inclusion complex, physical mixture, and nitrendipine powder. These three different forms of nitrendipine were administered orally to rats with a dose of 10 mg/kg equivalent to nitrendipine. The AUC of inclusion complex was significantly larger than that of nitrendipine powder. Tmax of inclusion complex was significantly shorter and Cmax was significantly higher than those of nitrendipine powder. Cmax of physical mixture was higher than that of nitrendipine powder. Tmax of physical mixture, however, remained the same. The results indicated that the bioavailability of nitrendipine could be improved markedly by inclusion complexation, possibly due to an increased dissolution rate.", 
    "153": "Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) has been implicated in tumor cell invasion and metastasis. We reported previously that transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 induces a dose- and time-dependent up-regulation of uPA mRNA and protein in highly invasive human ovarian cancer cell line HRA, leading to invasion. To further elucidate the mechanism of the invasive effect of TGF-beta1, we investigated which signaling pathway transduced by TGF-beta1 is responsible for this effect. Here, we show that 1) nontoxic concentrations of TGF-beta1 activated Src kinase; 2) TGF-beta1 rapidly phosphorylates ERK1/2 and Akt, but not p38; 3) pharmacological Src inhibitor PP2 or antisense (AS) c-Src oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) treatment reduced TGF-beta1-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt by 85-90% compared with controls; 4) pharmacological inhibition of MAPK by PD98059 abrogated TGF-beta1-mediated Akt stimulation, whereas TGF-beta1-induced ERK1/2 stimulation was not inhibited by PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or AS-PI3K ODN transfection; 5) up-regulation of uPA mRNA in response to TGF-beta1 was almost totally blocked by PP2 and PD98059 and partially ( approximately 55%) by LY294002; 6) TGF-beta1-induced uPA mRNA up-regulation was inhibited by treatment with AS ODNs to c-Src or PI3K by 90 or 60%, respectively, compared with control ODN treatment; and 7) blockade of the release of the transcription factor NF-kappaB by pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate reduced the TGF-beta1-induced activation of the uPA gene by approximately 65%. In addition, curcumin, a blocker of the transcriptional factor AP-1, partially (35%) canceled this effect. Taken together, these data support a role for TGF-beta1 activation of two distinct pathways (Src-MAPK-PI3K-NF-kappaB-dependent and Src-MAPK-AP-1-dependent) for TGF-beta1-dependent uPA up-regulation and promotion of invasion.",

We randomly assigned patients to bisoprolol 1.25 mg (n=28) or control (n=24) groups. The drug progressively increased to a maximum dose of 5 mg per day. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) was performed in all patients of the bisoprolol and control groups before and after 3 months from the beginning of the study.", 
    "156": "We found a significant increase in exercise duration, maximal O2 uptake (pik VO2), the O2 uptake at the anaerobic threshold (VO2-AT) and O2-pulse (pik VO2/HR), and improved functional capacity (p<0.001). Bisoprolol produced significant reduction in heart rate at rest (p=0.01) and during maximal exercise (p=0.041). In the control group no significant changes were observed.", 
    "157": "The addition of bisoprolol to the standart therapy in patients with mild to moderate heart failure is well tolerated and improves functional capacity.",

    "160": "One hundred ninety-three patients (68 diabetics, 125 non-diabetics) with chronic heart failure were assessed by radionuclide ventriculography, cardiopulmonary exercise testing and right heart catheterization before and after 12 months of maintenance carvedilol treatment (mean dose, 40+/-19 mg daily). Diabetic patients were older and with a lower peak VO2, compared with non-diabetics. Long-term carvedilol administration was associated with an improvement in left ventricular function, clinical symptoms, resting and exercise hemodynamic parameters compared to baseline, with no significant difference between the diabetic and the non-diabetic patients. The incidence of adverse effects was also similar between the two groups. Diabetics had higher all-cause mortality with a similar mortality and hospitalization rate, compared to non-diabetics during 33+/-20 months of follow-up.",

    "163": "Myocardial infarction (MI) was induced in male rats by ligation of the left coronary artery. Three different groups of rats were studied, MI rats treated with metoprolol (n=17), MI rats treated with saline (n=14) and sham-operated rats (n=12). The treatment with metoprolol 1 mg/kg/h was initiated in the third week post-infarct for a period of 6 weeks. All rats were investigated non-invasively with volume-selective 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy and echocardiography for evaluation of left ventricular (LV) energy metabolism, morphology and function. Plasma concentration of IL-1beta and IL-6 and density of beta-adrenergic receptors were analyzed.", 
    "164": "Metoprolol attenuated the increase in LV dimensions and volumes. Treatment with metoprolol had no effect on PCr/ATP and LV function. Plasma level of IL-1beta was higher and IL-6 was lower in the metoprolol group. Density of beta-adrenergic receptors was similar in all three groups.", 
    "165": "Selective beta1-blockade in rats with chronic CHF attenuates post-infarct structural remodelling, without concomitant improvement in myocardial energy metabolism and function. Improvements in myocardial energy metabolism and function do not precede and are not a prerequisite for an anti-remodelling effect of beta1-blockade in the setting of chronic CHF.", 
    "166": "Heart failure is associated with increased sympathetic nervous stimulation that results in down-regulation of myocardial beta-1 receptors. The failing heart might depend more on beta-2 receptors for positive inotropic support than the normal heart. Suppression of both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors by a non-selective beta-blocker, such as carvedilol, is likely to eliminate the failing heart's much needed inotropic support, resulting in an exacerbation of symptoms. Use of a beta-1 selective blocker, such as metoprolol, on the other hand, is likely to be well tolerated. Unlike carvedilol, the use of metoprolol is associated with up-regulation of beta-1 receptors. The clinical significance of the pharmacodynamic differences between these two beta-blockers in terms of their short-term hemodynamic and long-term beneficial effects is not clearly understood. However, in clinical trials, both carvedilol and metoprolol improved left ventricular function, heart failure symptoms and survival. Both drugs are well tolerated as well. Aging itself is associated with elevated myocardial and serum norepinephrine levels, which is associated with down-regulation of beta-1 receptors. In this article, we reviewed the literature to examine the clinical implications of this dual (age- and heart failure-related) sympathetic stimulation and beta-1 receptor down-regulation on selection of beta-blockers in older adults with heart failure.", 
    "167": "Hainantoxin-I is a novel peptide toxin, purified from the venom of the Chinese bird spider Selenocosmia hainana (=Ornithoctonus hainana). It includes 33 amino acid residues with a disulfide linkage of I-IV, II-V and III-VI, assigned by partial reduction and sequence analysis. Under two-electrode voltage-clamp conditions, hainantoxin-I can block rNa(v)1.2/beta(1) and the insect sodium channel para/tipE expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes with IC(50) values of 68+/-6 microM and 4.3+/-0.3 microM respectively. The three-dimensional solution structure of hainantoxin-I belongs to the inhibitor cystine knot structural family determined by two-dimensional (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. Structural comparison of hainantoxin-I with those of other toxins suggests that the combination of the charged residues and a vicinal hydrophobic patch should be responsible for ligand binding. This is the first report of an insect sodium channel blocker from spider venom and it provides useful information for the structure-function relationship studies of insect sodium channels.", 
    "168": "Seventy-nine African-American participants in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) pilot study were genotyped for the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism and had spectral power of their high-frequency (HF) heart rate variability (HRV) determined by fast-Fourier transformation. HF HRV was highest in II, intermediate in ID, and lowest in DD (II vs DD, p <0.043) genotypes, thus making an association of the ACE I/D DD genotype with decreased HF HRV that is consistent with the hypothesis that the DD genotype confers susceptibility to increased cardiovascular risk. The urban African-American population we studied had a particularly high cardiovascular risk, and these findings suggest that ACE I/D genotypes may modify that risk.", 
    "169": "Fear potentiation of the acoustic startle response (FPS) by aversive conditioned stimuli does not emerge in rats until Postnatal Day (P)23 (see P. S. Hunt & B. A. Campbell, 1997). However, the present study found that when presented with an unconditioned fear-eliciting stimulus, rats younger than P23 display FPS. Specifically, high illumination levels were found to enhance startle amplitudes in rats aged 18 and 25 days, but not 14 days. Furthermore, the light-enhanced startle observed in P18 rats was prevented by a systemic injection of the noradrenergic beta-receptor antagonist propranolol. These data suggest that conditioned and unconditioned FPS have different ontogenetic trajectories, and thereby provide support for the idea that learned and unlearned fear are subserved by dissociable neural systems.", 
    "170": "A previous study showed that intra-CAl infusion of the beta-adrenergic antagonist DL-propranolol interfered with consolidation of memory for contextual fear conditioning (J.-Z. Ji, X.-M. Wang, & B.-M. Li, 2003). The present study investigated the effect of similarly administered DL-propranolol on consolidation of spatial memory for the water maze. DL-propranolol infused 5 min, but not 6 hr, posttraining caused a deficit in 48-hr memory for the spatial water maze task, whereas similarly administered D-propranolol, which has an equipotent \"local-anesthetic\" activity but significantly lower beta-blocking activity, induced no amnesia. However, DL-propranolol administered 5 min posttraining did not impair 48-hr memory for the cued water maze task. Thus, beta-adrenoceptor in area CA1 is involved in regulating consolidation of spatial memory for the water maze.", 
    "171": "The capacity of noradrenaline (NA) and its end metabolite 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) to modulate the chemotaxis of lymphocytes from a primary immunocompetent organ (thymus) and a secondary one (spleen) was investigated over a range of concentrations from 10(-12) M to 10(-5) M. Lymphocyte chemotaxis was evaluated in a Boyden chamber. The results indicated that 10(-5) M of NA inhibits the chemotaxis of lymphocytes from both the immunocompetent organs studied, and that this effect is blocked by either propranolol (10(-6) M) or phentolamine (10(-5) M). Similarly, 10(-5) M of MHPG induced a decrease in the chemotaxis capacity of the lymphocytes. In conclusion, high physiological concentrations of NA and its end metabolite modulate the mobility of lymphocytes, and the participation of both alpha and beta adrenoreceptors is necessary, showing a new aspect of neuroimmune interactions.",

    "173": "We performed a nested case-control study to assess the association between the risk of prostate cancer and the use of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor captopril, and other antihypertensive drugs. We used data from the General Practice Research Database in UK.", 
    "174": "We found an incidence rate of prostate cancer of 1.61 per 1,000 person-years among male patients aged 50-79 years old. Patients with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia and/or prostatism carried a two-fold greater risk of prostate cancer than those without such antecedents. None of the other studied co-morbidities were associated with prostate cancer. We found that users of captopril had a relative risk of 0.7 (95% CI: 0.4-1.2) to develope prostate cancer. None of the other studied individual ACE-inhibitors shared a similar effect with the one observed for captopril.", 
    "175": "No clear association was apparent between the use of antihypertensive drugs and prostate cancer. However, specific focus on users of captopril showed a lower risk of subsequent prostate cancer. Further research is needed to explore this association.", 
    "176": "To elucidate the mechanisms of antinociception mediated by the descending noradrenergic pathway in the spinal cord, the effects of noradrenaline (NA) on noxious synaptic responses of substantia gelatinosa (SG) neurones, and postsynaptic actions of NA were investigated in rats using an in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Under urethane anaesthesia, the rat was fixed in a stereotaxic apparatus after the lumbar spinal cord was exposed. In the current-clamp mode, pinch stimuli applied to the ipsilateral hindlimb elicited a barrage of EPSPs, some of which initiated an action potential. Perfusion with NA onto the surface of the spinal cord hyperpolarized the membrane (5.0-9.5 mV) and suppressed the action potentials. In the voltage-clamp mode (V(H), -70 mV), the application of NA produced an outward current that was blocked by Cs(+) and GDP-beta-S added to the pipette solution and reduced the amplitude of EPSCs evoked by noxious stimuli. Under the blockade of postsynaptic actions of NA, a reduction of the evoked and spontaneous EPSCs of SG neurones was still observed, thus suggesting both pre- and postsynaptic actions of NA. The NA-induced outward currents showed a clear dose dependency (EC(50), 20 microM), and the reversal potential was -88 mV. The outward current was mimicked by an alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine, and suppressed by an alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine, but not by alpha(1)- and beta-antagonists. These findings suggest that NA acts on presynaptic sites to reduce noxious stimuli-induced EPSCs, and on postsynaptic SG neurones to induce an outward current by G-protein-mediated activation of K(+) channels through alpha(2)-adrenoceptors, thereby producing an antinociceptive effect.", 
    "177": "Beta-adrenergic blockade was used to determine whether the exercise training-induced adaptations of immune response to viral infection were mediated by catecholamines in young and old mice. Young (2 mo) and older (16 mo) male BALB/c mice were randomly assigned to an exercise or control group, and half of the mice in each group received the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist nadolol. After 8 wk of moderate exercise training, mice were challenged with herpes simplex virus (HSV) 24 h postexercise. The results showed that exercise treatment increased anti-HSV IgM antibody, enhanced IL-10, and altered the kinetics of IFN-gamma and IL-2 production in young and old mice. Unique to older mice, exercise decreased mitogen-induced proliferation, increased splenocytes, and tended to decrease memory cells (CD44(hi+)). In contrast, exercise increased mitogen-induced proliferation but decreased the number of splenic lymphocyte and CD4+ cells in young mice. beta-Adrenergic blockade blunted the exercise-induced changes in anti-HSV IgM, IL-2, IFNgamma, and mitogen-induced proliferation in old but not young mice. The findings suggest that some of the immunomodulatory effects of chronic exercise are mediated via beta-adrenergic receptors and that the role of beta-adrenergic receptors is age dependent.", 
    "178": "Previously, we identified a novel neuron-specific protein (PAHX-AP1) that binds to Refsum disease gene product (PAHX), and we developed transgenic (TG) mice that overexpress heart-targeted PAHX-AP1. These mice have atrial tachycardia and increased susceptibility to aconitine-induced arrhythmia. This study was undertaken to elucidate the possible changes in ion channels underlying the susceptibility to arrhythmia in these mice. RT-PCR analyses revealed that the cardiac expression of adrenergic beta(1)-receptor (ADRB1) was markedly lower, whereas voltage-gated potassium channel expression (Kv2.1) was higher in PAHX-AP1 TG mice compared with non-TG mice. However, the expression of voltage-sensitive sodium and calcium channels, and muscarinic receptor was not significantly different. Propranolol pretreatment, a non-specific beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, blocked aconitine-induced arrhythmia in non-TG mice, but not in PAHX-AP1 TG mice. Our results indicate that, in the PAHX-AP1 TG heart, the modulation of voltage-gated potassium channel and ADRB1 expression seem to be important in the electrophysiological changes associated with altered ion channel functions, but ADRB1 is not involved in the greater susceptibility to aconitine-induced arrhythmia.", 
    "179": "Frequency of therapeutic beta-blocker use in elderly mountaineers is unknown. Therefore, the aim of this field study was to measure the regular beta-blocker intake in elderly persons visiting moderate altitudes. In a subset of mountaineers on beta-blockers, exercise response at two different altitude levels was compared to matched controls. The observed frequency of beta-blocked persons among the interviewed elderly mountaineers (age >35) was 7%, mainly (65%) due to hypertension. In subjects taking beta-blockers, arterial oxygen saturation (84 +/- 6% vs. 90 +/- 3%, p < 0.05) was decreased and heart rate (120 +/- 17 bpm vs. 112 +/- 14 bpm, p = 0.01), rate pressure product (22,192 +/- 6459 vs. 17,576 +/- 4010, p < 0.05), and ratings of perceived exertion (14 +/- 3 vs. 12 +/- 3, p < 0.05) were increased during a submaximal step test at 2311 m compared to 1480 m. Mountaineers without beta-blocker intake showed no changes. Although the epidemiological data have to be interpreted with caution because of the small sample size and the limitation to a single geographical site, a large number of beta-blocked persons visiting high altitudes was observed. If confirmed in further studies, the increased heart work and exertion could indicate a reduced exercise tolerance of people taking beta-blockers during acute high altitude exposure.",

The specification on pharmacokinetic properties of the drug is shown. Outcomes of two studies (BCAPS and ELVA) devoted to influence of metoprolol on progression of atherosclerosis in patients with the risk factors are explained. The outcomes of these trials have confirmed, that the long-term therapy with metoprolol is one of the factors retentive atherosclerosis progression and allow more precisely to judge about mechanisms of positive influence of metoprolol therapy on the prognosis of the patients with cardiovascular diseases.",

    "182": "Patients (n=47) with postinfarction cardiosclerosis, angina, and decreased tolerance to physical exertion were divided into 2 groups. Patients of group 1 had functional class II angina and NYHA class I-II heart failure, patients of group 2 had functional class II-III angina and severe heart failure. Mildronate (0.75-1.0 g/day) was used as monotherapy in group 1 and in combination with atenolol (25-50 mg/day) in group 2. Duration of therapy was 3 weeks.", 
    "183": "The use of mildronate was associated with marked antiischemic effect. Combined administration of mildronate and atenolol resulted in additional antiischemic effect without impairment of hemodynamics in patients with severe heart failure. Course use of mildronate was well tolerated. Adverse effects were registered in 4,2% of cases.", 
    "184": "Drinking lots of water is commonly espoused in weight loss regimens and is regarded as healthy; however, few systematic studies address this notion. In 14 healthy, normal-weight subjects (seven men and seven women), we assessed the effect of drinking 500 ml of water on energy expenditure and substrate oxidation rates by using whole-room indirect calorimetry. The effect of water drinking on adipose tissue metabolism was assessed with the microdialysis technique. Drinking 500 ml of water increased metabolic rate by 30%. The increase occurred within 10 min and reached a maximum after 30-40 min. The total thermogenic response was about 100 kJ. About 40% of the thermogenic effect originated from warming the water from 22 to 37 C. In men, lipids mainly fueled the increase in metabolic rate. In contrast, in women carbohydrates were mainly used as the energy source. The increase in energy expenditure with water was diminished with systemic beta-adrenoreceptor blockade. Thus, drinking 2 liters of water per day would augment energy expenditure by approximately 400 kJ. Therefore, the thermogenic effect of water should be considered when estimating energy expenditure, particularly during weight loss programs.",

This study investigated patients admitted to the coronary care unit with acute myocardial infarction. Demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded, as well as the management, clinical course and survival after 28 days and one year.", 
    "187": "From May 15 to December 15 2000 we included in the registry 6,221 patients from the 58 hospitals that complied with the quality control requirements (71.6% of all participating hospitals). Acute mortality was 9.6%; 28-day and one-year mortality were 11.4% and 16.5%, respectively. Of the patients with ST elevation-myocardial infarction of less than 12 hours' duration, 71.6% were reperfused and 89.3% received fibrinolysis with a median door-to-needle time of 48 minutes. Ejection fraction was measured in 81% of the patients, and 43% were tested for inducible ischemia. About nine-tenths (91%) of the patients were discharged on least one antiplatelet drug, 56% on a beta blocker, 45% on an ACE inhibitor, and 45% on a lipid-lowering agent, with a coefficient of variation between hospitals greater than 25% for the last three drugs.", 
    "188": "The percentage of patients with ST elevation treated with reperfusion should increase, as it probably will thanks to the increasing use of primary angioplasty. The door-to-needle time was longer than the recommended interval. In-hospital risk stratification was good but nonsystematic for the evaluation of ejection fraction, and unsatisfactory for inducible ischemia testing. At discharge the percentages of patients receiving beta blockers, ACE inhibitors and statins were not optimal, and there were wide variations in prescribing practices between hospitals.", 
    "189": "In previous studies, the relaxant and anticholinergic (functional antagonism), histamine(H1) inhibitory, and xanthine-like activity effect of Carum copticum have been demonstrated on guinea pig tracheal chains. To investigate the effective component(s) of this plant, responsible for the observed bronchodilatory effect, fractionation of the essential oil from Carum copticum was carried out and the relaxant effects of different fractions were examined in this study. The bronchodilatory effect of different fractions of essential oil from Carum copticum and theophylline in comparison with ethanol was examined by their relaxant effects on precontracted tracheal chains of guinea pig by 60 mM KCl (group 1) and 10 microM methacholine in two different conditions including: non-incubated tissues (group 2) and incubated tissues with 1 microM propranolol and 1 microM chlorpheniramine (group 3). In addition the relaxant effect of carvacrol was also examined on precontracted tracheal chains of guinea pig by 10 microM methacholine (group 4), (for each group, n = 5). In group 1 experiments, only theophylline and fraction 2 showed significant relaxant effect compared to that of ethanol. Fraction 2 and 3 of essential oil from carum copticum showed potent and volume (concentration) dependent relaxant effects comparable to that of theophylline in groups 2 and 3 experiments. The relaxant effects of different volumes of these two fractions were significantly higher than that of ethanol (p < 0.05 to p < 0.002 ). The volumes of fraction 1 showed relatively small relaxant effects in groups 2 and 3 experiments which were not significantly different from that of ethanol. However, the relaxant effect of different volumes of fractions 2 and 3 obtained in group 2 experiments were not significantly different from those of group 3 experiments. The volumes of fraction 4 did not show any relaxant effects. In addition volumes of carvacrol also showed comparable relaxant effect with those of fraction 2 and theophylline which was significantly greater than that of ethanol. These results indicate that the relaxant effect of essential oil from carum copticum is mainly due to its fraction 2 which is presumably carvacrol and to lesser extent due to fraction 3, and their relaxant effects are not due to anticholinergic or beta-adrenegic stimulatory effects.", 
    "190": "This study examined the effect of combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade on glucose kinetics during intense exercise. Six endurance-trained men exercised for 20 minutes at approximately 78% of their peak oxygen consumption (Vo(2)) following ingestion of a placebo (CON) or combined alpha- (prazosin hydrochloride) and beta- (timolol maleate) adrenoceptor antagonists (BLK). Plasma glucose increased during exercise in CON (0 minutes: 5.5 +/- 0.1; 20 minutes: 6.5 +/- 0.3 mmol. L(-1), P <.05). In BLK, the exercise-induced increase in plasma glucose was abolished (0 minutes: 5.7 +/- 0.3; 20 minutes: 5.7 +/- 0.1 mmol. L(-1)). Glucose kinetics were measured using a primed, continuous infusion of [6,6-(2)H] glucose. Glucose production was not different between trials; on average these values were 25.3 +/- 3.9 and 30.9 +/- 4.4 micromol. kg(-1). min(-1) in CON and BLK, respectively. Glucose uptake during exercise was greater (P <.05) in BLK (30.6 +/- 4.6 micromol. kg(-1). min(-1)) compared with CON (18.4 +/- 2.5 micromol. kg(-1). min(-1)). In BLK, plasma insulin and catecholamines were higher (P <.05), while plasma glucagon was unchanged from CON. Free fatty acids (FFA) and glycerol were lower (P <.05) in BLK. These findings demonstrate that adrenergic blockade during intense exercise results in a blunted plasma glucose response that is due to enhanced glucose uptake, with no significant change in glucose production."
