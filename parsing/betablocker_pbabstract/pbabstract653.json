In doses that caused a transient, 2-to 3-fold elevation of the cAMP level, theophylline and adrenaline elicited about 2.5-fold elevation of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2-5A synthetase) activity. This increase could be prevented by actinomycin D. This suggests that the elevation of the enzyme activity in the cells was due to a transcription-dependent induction process. Theophylline and adrenaline treatment of the cell cultures also led to a 2-to 3-fold fall of the activity of the phosphodiesterase of 2',5'-oligoadenylate (2'-phosphodiesterase). This effect of adrenaline was prevented by propanolol but not by actinomycin D. In the case of adrenaline, the fall of 2'-phosphodiesterase activity was accompanied by at least 5-fold increase in the enzyme activity which did not occur if actinomycin D was present in the culture. Similarities and differences between these effects and those induced by interferon are discussed. It is concluded that cAMP is an important regulator of the enzyme system of the 2',5'-oligoadenylate metabolism. 2',5'-Oligoadenylate, in turn, was found to act on the activity of phosphodiesterase of cyclic AMP. The cAMP phosphodiesterase activity in the NIH 3T3 cell lysates was activated 2- to 2.5-fold at physiological concentrations (10(-9) to 10(-7) M) of both the phosphorylated form of oligoisoadenylate, ppp(5'A2'p)n5'A2'OH, and the dephosphorylated form, HO(5'A2'p)25'A2'OH. The phosphorylated form of oligoisoadenylate also activated partially purified preparations of cAMP phosphodiesterase. The data obtained in this study allow us to consider cAMP and 2',5'-oligoadenylate as the key metabolites that may be used in the cells to form a complex, interconnected, multifunctional circuit that involves the interferon enzyme system and the system of cyclic AMP metabolism and governs essential cell functions, as regulation of RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, cell growth and differentiation.", 
    "1": "In a randomized double-blind cross-over study the effects of antihypertensive pharmacotherapy were compared with those of homeopathic treatment in 10 patients with essential hypertension. The conclusions are: 1. The blood pressure lowering effect under pharmacotherapy is clearly superior to that under homeotherapy, where it was negligible and statistically not significant. 2. As far as improvement of subjective complaints of the patients is concerned there was no superiority of pharmacotherapy over homeopathic treatment. 3. The cross-over design appears less suitable than, perhaps, a design with parallel treatment groups because of the long duration of such a study and the observed carry-over effect.", 
    "2": "Subcutaneously administered terbutaline (7 micrograms/kg Bricanyl) induced typical changes in carbohydrate and fat metabolism and cardiovascular effects in ten healthy volunteers. A significant inhibition of changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and plasma glycerol, FFA, lactate and potassium levels was seen after pretreatment with 0.1 mg/kg propranolol (Dociton) or 0.2 mg/kg metoprolol (Beloc). Intravenous metoprolol showed weaker beta-blocking activity than propranolol, but proved to be more effective in its action on systolic blood pressure.", 
    "3": "In vitro binding experiments were done to study the effects of adenosine receptor agonists on induction of [3H]clonidine binding sites in rat vasa deferentia by reserpine. In the presence of 1 microM adenosine and 2-chloroadenosine, respectively, the specific binding of [3H]clonidine to vas deferens homogenates of reserpine-treated rats increased 38 and 42% over the control value. The increase in binding sites induced by adenosine was inhibited by the adenosine receptor antagonist theophylline. No effect of 1 microM 2-chloroadenosine on the beta-adrenoceptor or alpha 1-adrenoceptor was detected. The results imply a direct interaction between alpha 2-adrenoceptor and adenosine receptor and suggest that stimulated adenosine receptors unmasked [3H]clonidine binding sites in membranes of rat vas deferens.", 
    "4": "The antiarrhythmic effect of disopyramide retard (DR) in a dose of 2 X 300 mg/day, propranolol retard (PR) in one of 1 X 160 mg/day and placebo was compared in a randomized crossover study in patients with ventricular premature beats (VPB). 10 patients with VPB (Lown classes II-V) were given the drugs as follows: placebo I for 3 days. DR or PR for 7 days, placebo II for 5 days and PR or DR for 7 days. During every phase Holter ECG was registered over a period of 24 hours. Under DR 6 patients showed a favourable qualitative effect improving by at least one Lown class, while under PR only one patient did so. Under DR an over 80% reduction of VPB occurred in 6 patients and under PR in one patient. In all patients with any reduction of VPB this reduction was 79% under DR and 57% under PR. These results suggest that the antiarrhythmic effect of disopyramide in slow release preparations is comparable with that of disopyramide in standard capsule formulation given in the usual and more complicated regime with four divided doses. In the above mentioned (and still recommended) dose PR has no antiarrhythmic effect.", 
    "5": "Spinal rats and rats with an intact neuraxis given the dopamine (DA) agonist R-apomorphine (0.31-1.75 mumol/kg) in the lumbar subarachnoid space by intrathecal injection were tested 5 and 10 min later for spinal analgesia (increased tail-flick response latency). Apomorphine produced analgesia in spinal rats but not in rats with an intact neuraxis. However, pretreatment of intact rats with the serotonergic (5-HT) receptor antagonist methysergide, the noradrenergic (NA) receptor antagonist phentolamine or the two antagonists together led to a dose-dependent analgesia following apomorphine. Intact rats pretreated with the monoamine depleting drug reserpine, the 5-HT synthesis inhibitor p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) or the NA synthesis inhibitor FLA 63 also showed analgesia to apomorphine. On the other hand, pretreatment with the catecholamine depleting agent alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (AMPT), the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker propranolol or the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone failed to produce DA analgesia. The present findings suggest that both 5-HT and NA descending fiber systems exert tonic inhibitory effects on spinal DA nociceptive processes.", 
    "6": "The effects of propylthiouracil (PTU) treatment on alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic receptors in neonatal and adult rat myocardium were examined with the alpha 1-selective antagonist [3H]prazosin and beta-antagonist (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol ((-)-[3H]DHA). Pre and postnatal PTU treatment (congenital hypothyroid state) decreased ventricular size and protein content at 15 and at 28 days (P less than 0.01). Similarly PTU treatment after maturation (acquired hypothyroid state) is associated with decreased ventricular size and protein content (P less than 0.01). PTU treatment did not alter ventricular DNA content at any age examined as compared to euthyroid controls. Specific [3H]prazosin binding to ventricular membrane increased with advancing postnatal age in both congenital hypothyroid pups and controls, reaching peak receptor density at 15 days of postnatal age (106 +/- 8 vs. 151 +/- 7 fmol X mg-1 protein). The density at 15 and 28 days was however significantly lower in hypothyroid pups (P less than 0.01, P less than 0.02). The effect of congenital hypothyroidism on (-)-[3H]DHA binding was more marked which significantly decreased from the first postnatal day. Acquired hypothyroidism is also associated with a decreased density of alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic receptors in rat myocardium. We conclude that alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic receptors are modulated by thyroid hormone in developmental as well as mature stages of the rat.", 
    "7": "The beta-blocking potencies (pA2 values) and cumulative dose responses of the direct effects of dl-propranolol, practolol, acebutolol and sotalol have been characterised in respect of the mechanical performance of isolated cat papillary muscle preparations. pA2 values calculated from antagonism of each of the drugs to the inotropic effect of isoprenaline at 29 degrees C were: dl-propranolol 8.3, practolol 5.6, acebutolol 7.5 and sotalol 4.8. The responses in reserpinized muscles were similar to those in non-reserpinized preparations. dl-Propranolol at concentrations of 10(-5) and 10(-4) M depressed peak developed force (DF) and rate of force development (+dF/dt) by 20% and 60% respectively, with similar but smaller changes in maximum unloaded shortening velocity ('Vmax'). Practolol and sotalol increased DF and +dF/dt by less than 10% at 10(-5) M and by 10-20% at 10(-4) M, with similar but smaller changes in Vmax. Sotalol induced prolonged biphasic contractions at 10(-4) M. Acebutolol had no effect on DF, +dF/dt, or Vmax. Time to peak force and half isometric relaxation time were not altered by any drug. Practolol and acebutolol, generally considered to have partial agonist activity, exerted this to a negligible degree in respect of inotropic effect at less than or equal to 10(-5) M.", 
    "8": "Propranolol pretreatment (0.1 mg X kg-1) significantly increased the lengthening induced by diltiazem (0.15 mg X kg-1 + 0.01 mg X kg-1 X min-1, 20 min) of the A-H interval of His bundle potential recordings in the dog. In the presence of propranolol, diltiazem also significantly increased the atrioventricular effective refractory period. The results suggest the possible occurrence of AV blocks as a result of the use of a diltiazem-beta blocker combination in clinical practice.", 
    "9": "Selective beta 1-blocking drugs without bronchoconstrictor effect are desirable in patients with bronchial asthma and systemic hypertension or tachycardia. Therefore, 15 patients with bronchial asthma were given a single dose of 100 mg celiprolol (and 5 of them 300 mg) and airway obstruction (Raw, FEV1), pulse rate and blood pressure were documented for 3 hours. After 2 hours an additional infusion of aminophylline and after 3 hours an additional inhalation of fenoterol were given. Within 120 minutes after the intake of celiprolol no statistical changes in the measured data (Raw, FEV1, blood pressure and pulse rate) were found. The same was true after the infusion of aminophylline. Reversibility of airway obstruction by fenoterol was better after celiprolol plus aminophylline than without this premedication (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that the beta 1-antagonist celiprolol does not induce relevant airway obstruction in patients with bronchial asthma, and that an additional infusion of aminophylline enhances the bronchodilatory effect of the beta 2-agonist fenoterol (p less than 0.05).", 
    "10": "The corpus striatum has a high density of beta-adrenergic receptors though it appears to contain low levels of beta-hydroxylated catecholamines. In an attempt to determine whether these receptors normally receive an endogenous input, the densities of beta 1 and beta 2-adrenergic receptors in rat caudate have been measured following adrenalectomy and after various pharmacological manipulations. Chronic administration of either pargyline, an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase activity, or desmethylimipramine, an inhibitor of norepinephrine uptake, resulted in a 20-25% decrease in the density of beta 1-adrenergic receptors while either adrenalectomy or the chronic administration of the non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol resulted in small but significant increases in the density of beta 1-receptors. These treatments did not lead to significant changes in the density of beta 2-receptors. It thus appears that the density of beta 1-receptors in the caudate is normally affected by changing levels of endogenous catecholamines.", 
    "11": "Postdecapitation convulsions (PDC) were quantified by recording the number of movements of the trunk of decapitated rats with an Animex motility meter. PDC were inhibited by alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking agents, phenoxybenzamine and prazosin, but unaffected by alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists, yohimbine and piperoxan, or a beta-adrenoceptor blocker, propranolol. Chronic administration of antidepressant drugs: amitriptyline, imipramine and zimelidine augmented the PDC. Preliminary experiments with [3H]prazosin binding suggest that the increased PDC response is related to an increase in alpha 1-adrenoceptor binding, most likely owing to an increase in receptor density.", 
    "12": "Plasma kininogen levels were significantly reduced in normal human blood, but not in cell-free human plasma, following 10 min in vitro exposure to, in order of decreasing effectiveness, 6 microM adrenaline, noradrenaline or isopropyl-noradrenaline. Phenoxybenzamine (0.1 mM), an alpha-receptor blocking drug, and 0.5 mM aspirin, an inhibitor of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis, inhibited the action of adrenaline, whereas 0.1 mM propranolol, a beta-receptor blocker, and 0.5 mM indomethacin, another inhibitor of the formation of PG, failed to do so. The results suggest that catecholamines are able to activate cell-mediated activation of the kallikrein system in human blood and that this process can be inhibited by aspirin.", 
    "13": "Changes in position of the upper front tooth in response to sectioning and subsequent electrical stimulation of the cervical sympathetic nerves were studied in 25 anesthetized rabbits. The position was continuously recorded by an ultrasonic transit time technique. Sectioning of the nerves was found to induce an average tooth extrusion of about 7 microns. Sympathetic nerve stimulation for periods of 20-30 s caused intrusion of the tooth, with about 70% of maximum occurring at 2 Hz stimulations. The intrusive response was reduced by phentolamine. Neither atropine nor propranolol affected the stimulation response, but the latter drug led to marked extrusion of the tooth. In conclusion, the position of the rabbit's front tooth was found to be highly sensitive to alterations in sympathetic nerve activity to the vasculature of the tooth-supporting tissues.", 
    "14": "180 eyes of 97 patients with primary open angle glaucoma and IOP greater than 22 mm were treated for more than 3 years with timolol-maleate. 130 eyes had glaucoma simplex, and 50 eyes had glaucoma capsulare. With timolol maleate as the only medication after 3 years, the IOP was controlled in 33% of the glaucoma simplex group, and in 8% of the glaucoma capsulare group. No serious local or systemic side-effects were observed.", 
    "15": "The ocular hypotensive action of timolol used alone and in combination with other antiglaucoma drugs was studied in 33 patients with glaucoma, 19 glaucoma suspects and 12 patients with ocular hypertension in a treatment period of 4 years. During the 2nd-4th year the mean IOP increased 8-10% (P less than 0.05) in both glaucoma patients and patients with ocular hypertension or suspected glaucoma. The success rate on timolol alone (a persistent IOP less than 20 mmHg) was 43.6% in patients with manifest glaucoma. In 18% of the patients an aggravation of pre-existing visual field lesion or new visual lesions developed. Nine patients (14%) - 3 on timolol alone and 6 on additional treatment regime - had to be operated due to definite insufficiency of pressure reduction.", 
    "16": "Splenic weight, an index of changes in vascular capacity, was used to assess the effects of xylazine hydrochloride in anesthetized dogs. Intravenous xylazine (0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg/kg) produced dose-dependent decreases in vascular capacity as assessed by decreases in splenic weight which were significant (P less than 0.05) at the 1 mg/kg dose. Phenoxybenzamine, an alpha-adrenergic receptor blocking drug, prevented the splenic contractile response to xylazine. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor blocking drug, did not alter the splenic contractile response to xylazine. Intravenous xylazine (0.1 and 1 mg/kg) produced significant (P less than 0.05) decreases in heart rate, splenic arterial flow, and systolic, mean, and diastolic blood pressures. Central venous pressure increased significantly (P less than 0.05) in dogs given the 1 mg/kg dose.", 
    "17": "The bioequivalence of two different tablets and a solution, each containing 10 mg propranolol hydrochloride was studied in twelve healthy volunteers. Single oral doses of each preparation were administered at intervals of one week. Samples of blood for propranolol radioimmunoassay were taken up to 8 h after dosing. The plasma propranolol concentration at 0.5 h was significantly higher for the solution than for the two tablet formulations which did not differ significantly from each other at any sampling point. The area under the curve was similar for all three preparations. The study demonstrated that the three different preparations of propranolol were bioequivalent.", 
    "18": "The effects of propranolol on lipid metabolism were studied in rats. Male Sprague Dawley rats at 5 weeks of age were used. Rats were given 5-10 mg/kg/day of propranolol subcutaneously or 10 mg/kg/day orally for 8 weeks. Serum non-esterified fatty acids and triglyceride were lowered in the oral treatment with propranolol but not changed in the subcutaneous one. Total serum cholesterol tended to decrease at the early weeks of treatment and increased at later weeks of treatment as compared with the control group. alpha-Lipoprotein was higher and beta-lipoprotein was lower in propranolol-treated groups than that in the control group. Serum lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase activity and high density lipoprotein were higher in propranolol-treated groups at 1st and 8th week of treatment. Total cholesterol in the liver decreased at the 8th week of treatment, but triglyceride in the liver did not change. These results suggest that propranolol inhibits the hormone sensitive lipase activity through adenyl cyclase at the early weeks of treatment, but this effect is reduced by homeostasis at the later weeks of treatment. There were some differences in serum lipids and enzyme activities between the oral and subcutaneous treatments. This would be related to the first pass effect of propranolol.", 
    "19": "In order to characterize the adrenergic control of the pancreatic A cell the effect on glucagon secretion of three sympathomimetic substances - epinephrine, isoproterenol and phenylephrine - and two adrenergic blocking agents - propranolol and phentolamine - were tested separately in the basal state and during glucagon hypersecretion induced by arginine infusion or glucopenia, using the isolated perfused rat pancreas. Epinephrine and isoproterenol infusion caused a prompt and sustained glucagon release in the basal state and potentiated glucagon response to metabolic stimuli. Insulin secretion was suppressed by epinephrine and slightly stimulated by isoproterenol. The stimulatory effect on glucagon secretion observed during phenylephrine infusion was abolished by concomitant propranolol infusion and potentiated by phentolamine. Insulin secretion was markedly depressed by phenylephrine: this effect was reserved by concomitant phentolamine infusion, while no effect was observed by concomitant propranolol infusion. Propranolol caused a suppression of both glucagon and insulin secretion, while phentolamine slightly enhanced glucagon and insulin production. In conclusion, beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation markedly increased pancreatic glucagon secretion and slightly enhanced pancreatic beta-cell activity; conversely, alpha-adrenergic agents markedly depressed insulin secretion while scarcely influencing glucagon production.", 
    "20": "Intracranial pressure measurements and ventricular volume pressure response curves were made during induced hypotension with labetalol, a combined alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, in dogs without (group I) and with (group II) intracranial hypertension. The administration of 600 mg labetalol resulted in a percentage decrease of mean systemic arterial blood pressure (MAP) of 27% (+/- 10%) in group I, and 32% (+/- 9%) in group II from control values without changes in intracranial pressure and the ventricular volume pressure response curve. Larger decreases in MAP were not possible, even with a dose 3 times that clinically recommended. Labetalol may be a safe hypotensive agent to supplement neurolept analgesia, but it is not the drug of choice to induce deliberate hypotension.", 
    "21": "The 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) receptor blocker, methysergide (10 mg/kg), was found to potentiate the behavioural effects of beta-phenylethylamine (PEA) (at doses between 20 and 60 mg/kg) on food reinforced schedule-maintained behaviour in two separate experiments involving a fixed interval 2 min schedule and a fixed ratio 20 schedule. Potentiation caused a parallel shift to the left in the log dose response curve for suppression of responding induced by phenylethylamine, and was observed in both male and female rats. These data contrast with recent reports indicating that inhibition of functioning of 5HT systems blocks the effects of phenylethylamine in inducing the \"Serotonin behavioural syndrome\" (Sloviter et al., 1980a: Dourish, 1981). However, the potentiation reported here is compatible with frequent reports indicating that behavioural effects of amphetamine (alpha-methyl-PEA) can be potentiated by reduction in 5HT functioning and are thus compatible with the hypothesis that phenylethylamine is a potential \"endogenous amphetamine\".", 
    "22": "A series of 4-aroyl-1,3-dihydro-2H-imidazol-2-ones was synthesized and evaluated for pharmacological activity in the anesthetized dog. Most members of this series produced dose-related increases in cardiac contractile force as well as relatively minor increases in heart rate and decreases in systemic arterial blood pressure that were not blocked by propranolol. In general, 4-methoxy or 4-methylthiobenzoyl substitution afforded compounds of greatest inotropic potency. 1,3-Dihydro-4-(4-methoxybenzoyl)-5-methyl-2H-imidazol-one (6) was shown to produce a dose-related positive inotropic effect and reverse the depressant effect of pentobarbital on cardiac pump function in the dog heart-lung preparation. The cardiotonic activity of this series may have important utility in the treatment of congestive heart failure. 1,3-Dihydro-4-[4-(methylthio)benzoyl]-5-methyl-2H-imidazol-2-one (17) was chosen for human studies and is currently undergoing clinical trials.", 
    "23": "To assess the contribution of the autonomic nervous system to heart rate recovery following exertion, heart rate was observed after peak treadmill exercise in six men following parasympathetic blockade (PB) with atropine sulfate (0.03 mg/kg), sympathetic blockade (SB) with propranolol hydrochloride (0.20 mg/kg), double blockade (DB) with both drugs, and no drugs (ND). Least-squares analysis of each subject's heart rate (HR) as an exponential function of recovery time (t) was computed for each treatment giving an equation of the form HR = aebt. HRs at rest, peak exercise, and 10 min of recovery, the coefficients a and b, and the least-squares correlation coefficient (r) were compared among treatments by nonparametric analysis of variance and rank-sum multiple comparisons. HR recovered in an exponential manner after dynamic exercise in each subject with each of the treatment modes (P less than 0.01 for each r, mean across all treatments r = 0.94). Coefficients a and b differed the most between PB and SB. At the cessation of exercise the decreases in venous return and the systemic need for cardiac output are accompanied by an exponential HR decline. The exponential character of the cardiodeceleration seen after peak exercise appears to be an intrinsic property of the circulation because it occurred under each experimental condition.", 
    "24": "1 The effect of chlorpromazine, metyrapone, imipramine and SKF 525-A on the hepatic first pass elimination of propranolol has been studied in the pithed rat. 2 The effect of chlorpromazine, metyrapone, imipramine and SKF 525-A on the inhibition caused by propranolol of an elicited electrically induced tachycardia has also been studied. 3 The hepatic first pass elimination of propranolol was reduced following pretreatment with chlorpromazine, imipramine and SKF 525-A but was not affected by pretreatment with metyrapone. 4 Chlorpromazine, imipramine and SKF 525-A all resulted in an increased propranolol blood concentration after hepatic portal vein administration which was associated with decreased formation of metabolites and an enhanced inhibition of an electrically induced tachycardia.", 
    "25": "Acute experiments were made on cats to study the general and local cerebral blood flow, the cerebrovascular tone and systemic hemodynamics during acute myocardial ischemia. Occlusion of the coronary artery resulted in the reduction of the blood flow in the carotid artery and brain cortex, decreased arterial pressure, and the cardiac output. Short-term vasodilatation was replaced by prolonged vasoconstriction which increased during myocardial ischemia. The blockade of beta-adrenoreceptors with propranolol reduced vasoconstriction. The blockade of alpha-adrenoreceptors removed or distorted vasoconstriction of the brain and hind limb vessels. The mechanisms by which brain circulatory disorders occur are discussed.", 
    "26": "Metoprolol, a cardioselective beta-blocker, was used in two asthmatic, thyrotoxic patients in preparation for thyroidectomy. Adequate reduction in resting heart rate was achieved in both individuals without inducing clinically significant airway obstruction. Beta-1-blockade can be selectively employed in this clinical setting, but patients should be hospitalized and closely monitored for adverse effects on pulmonary function. Metoprolol therapy in patients with reversible airway obstruction is discussed with reference to recent studies on relative cardioselectivity.", 
    "27": "Integrated, reflex, cardiovascular regulation in unanesthetized (tranquilized), chronically-instrumented dogs was studied using sinusoidal whole-body spinal-axis acceleration (+/- 2 Gz) at frequencies below 0.25 Hz. The participation of neurally mediated cardiac and vascular control mechanisms was examined by comparing the responses of the same animal in a normal (reflexive) state and ina pharmacologically blockaded (nonreflexive) state. Integrated neural mechanisms were found to be the most effective in minimizing acceleration-induced, arterial pressure disturbances for frequencies below 0.012 Hz; became progressively out of phase with the disturbances between 0.012 and 0.052 Hz, resulting in decreased effectiveness; and failed to significantly participate in the regulatory process for frequencies between 0.052 and 0.25 Hz, where \"protection\" was provided by the hydraulic and intrinsic biomechanical characteristics of the circulatory system. An analysis of the relative contribution of peripheral vascular and cardiac mechanisms indicated that 1) neurally mediated, systemic vascular responses were largest for frequency; 2) heart rate oscillations were large for frequencies below 0.052 Hz (corner frequency) and then decreased rapidly with increasing frequency; and 3) neurally mediated stroke volume oscillations were the largest for the lowest frequencies and decreased with increasing frequency.", 
    "28": "Blood flow (Q) and O2 uptake (Vo2) were measured in the intact autoperfused left hindlimb (less paw) of anesthetized paralyzed dogs ventilated at constant rate with either room air (normoxia) or 9.1% O2 in N2 (hypoxia) for 20-min periods. One group of 10 dogs was given 3.0 mg/kg phenoxybenzamine (alpha-block) and was subjected to the sequence of normoxia, hypoxia, normoxia. The sequence was repeated after 1.0 mg/kg propranolol (beta-block). A second group of 10 was treated the same but was not given adrenergic blockers (no block). A third group of 10 was made hypoxic only once after the sciatic and femoral nerves to the prepared limb were severed (denervated). Decreased O2 availability during hypoxia limited both total and limb V02 in all cases. Limb Q did not change, but vascular resistance increased in the no-block group with onset of hypoxia and a brisk transient hyperemia occurred with reoxygenation. After both alpha- and beta-block no change occurred in limb resistance with reoxygenation. A similar result was obtained in the denervated limb. These results indicated that the transient hyperemia following hypoxia was the result of altered states of neurally mediated vascular tone, mostly sympathetic, and was not due to local metabolic vasodilation or altered blood levels of catecholamines during a 20-min period of hypoxia.", 
    "29": "The effect of dl-propranolol (1.0 mg/kg/day i.p.) on heart rate and blood pressure in young and old normo- and hypertensive rats was studied before and after bilateral sympathectomy of the superior cervical ganglia. Denervation alone produced no significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate in the normo- or hypertensive rat of either age. Thirty-five consecutive days of propranolol treatment significantly lowered blood pressure in the older established spontaneous hypertensive rat and prevented the increases from occurring in the younger, developing hypertensive rat. Blood pressure was not modified in the normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rat by propranolol. Denervation of the superior cervical ganglia at the beginning of the propranolol treatment or midway through the protocol abolished the antihypertensive effects in the young and old spontaneous hypertensive rat. A close temporal association of denervation with the loss of the antihypertensive effect was demonstrated. Although propranolol administration continued after denervation, the antihypertensive effects of the drug did not reappear.", 
    "30": "Seven drugs were tested for their antiarrhythmic effects on ventricular arrhythmias 24 and 48 hr after two-stage coronary ligation in conscious beagles. Venous blood samples were drawn for plasma drug assays. Minimum effective plasma concentrations of drugs were calculated from derived concentration-time curves. Effective drugs and their minimum effective concentrations for the suppression of arrhythmias 24 and 48 hr after coronary ligation were: disopyramide, 4.2 and 2.3 micrograms/ml; procainamide, 26.4 and 27.0 micrograms/ml; phenytoin, 8.4 and 6.4 micrograms/ml; and a new beta-blocker, N-696, 7.6 and 8.7 micrograms/ml. The concentrations of disopyramide and phenytoin were almost the same as those reported for human antiarrhythmic concentrations, but those of procainamide were higher than those reported for man. Lidocaine, verapamil and a new beta-blocker, OPC-1427, were ineffective. Membrane-stabilizing effects seem to be important in suppressing the canine two-stage coronary ligation arrhythmia.", 
    "31": "One hundred sixty-nine normal men received varying propranolol dosage regimens and placebo. Dose level and frequency were compared with plasma propranolol levels and beta blockade, as assessed by reduction of exercise tachycardia. Propranolol levels above 20 ng/ml induced significant beta blockade. An average daily propranolol dose slightly in excess of 160 mg led to a minimum plasma level above 20 ng/ml. Approximately 50% of subjects achieved 20 bpm or greater decrease in exercise tachycardia with 160 mg per day. The degree of beta blockade at the daily minimum propranolol level was related to dose and not dose frequency. The relation of propranolol dose and plasma levels to beta blockade in normal subjects appears to reflect observations in large clinical trials.", 
    "32": "Timolol, like propranolol, is a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocker, but it is much less lipid soluble and is formulated as a single enantiomer rather than a racemic mixture. We examined the effects of such differences on bioavailability, systemic clearance, and pharmacologic response. Ten healthy subjects received placebo, 0.2 mg/kg IV propranolol, 3.2 mg/kg oral propranolol, 0.025 mg/kg IV timolol, and 0.4 mg/kg oral timolol in double-blind, randomized crossover fashion. Plasma concentrations of total drug were monitored up to 8 hr, while responses to submaximal exercise were measured at 0, 2, and 6 hr. Timolol had greater bioavailability (F = 0.61 +/- 0.06(SEM) and 0.32 +/- 0.04) and lower systemic clearance (463 +/- 74 ml kg-1 hr-1 and 1040 +/- 120 ml kg-1 hr-1) than propranolol. Half-lifes were of the same order (2.7 and 2.9 hr). There was a marginal correlation between areas under the intravenous and oral plasma concentration-time curves for timolol (r = 0.66, P = 0.054), but none for propranolol (r = 0.48, P NS). There were also correlations of the response (percent reduction in heart rate) to oral and intravenous timolol at 2 hr (r = 0.72, P less than 0.05) and 6 hr (r = 0.84, P less than 0.01) hr, but none between responses to oral and intravenous propranolol. Finally, the response to oral timolol was related to the area under its plasma concentration-time curve, whereas that to propranolol was not. We conclude that the physicochemical properties of timolol lead to greater bioavailability. Pharmacologic response to an oral dose of timolol, unlike that to propranolol, can be predicted from the response to an intravenous dose and reflects its plasma concentration.", 
    "33": "Twenty-eight patients with mild essential hypertension were treated with placebo for six weeks and then with active medication for a further 32 weeks. Twelve patients were well-controlled with 160-320 mg/day of slow release oxprenolol alone, 12 required oxprenolol and chlorthalidone, and four also required hydrallazine. beta-adrenergic blockade reduced the basal level of plasma free fatty acid (FFA) by 41%. A sub-maximal exercise test reduced the level of FFA by 34% during placebo treatment. The same exercise test during beta-blockade reduced the already lowered basal FFA level by a further 45%. Only female subjects experienced exercise-induced leg fatigue during beta-blockade. They always had higher FFA levels than males, but the relative changes in FFA concentration were similar in both sexes. Exercise testing induced a 52 mmHg rise in systolic blood pressure, but this was reduced to only 14 mmHg during treatment. Patients controlled on oxprenolol alone showed no significant change in plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels. Those patients ultimately requiring combination drug therapy experienced a statistically significant rise in plasma triglycerides and a significant fall in high density lipoprotein cholesterol. The biological importance of these changes is uncertain.", 
    "34": "Swimming rats for up to 2 h in water at 34 +/- 1 degree C increased the rate of breathing by 60% and tidal volume by 200-300%. In each case we infused 20 muCi X kg-1 [methyl-3H]choline chloride, via a caudal vein, 3 h prior to the end of swimming. Maximum specific activity of tissue phospholipid (PL) and alveolar PL (PLalv) occurred in 1 and 12 h, respectively. Total PLalv, specific activity of PLalv and the percentage of total PL released (%A/T) increased within 10 min of start of swimming and were sustained for at least 2 h of swimming [PLalv in mg X g dry lung-1: 5 s swim, 7.3 +/- 0.96 (mean +/- SD; n = 15 rats); 1-h swim, 10.1 +/- 1.1 (n = 23 rats)]. After a 1-h swim, PLalv returned to control within 4 h. Pretreatment with propranolol hydrochloride (10 mg X kg-1) (P), atropine methyl nitrate (3 mg X kg-1) (A), indomethacin (15 mg X kg-1), and cyproheptadine (1 mg X kg-1) did not alter the increase in PLalv with swimming, however, both P and A reduced the increase in specific activity of PLalv and %A/T. We suggest that the exercise releases surfactant from two pools: a readily released pool that responds to direct distortion of the alveolar type II cell and a pool that is under sympathetic nervous control.", 
    "35": "The duration of the hyperthyroidism associated with lymphocytic thyroiditis (LT) with spontaneously resolving hyperthyroidism (SRH) was serially monitored in groups of patients who were not given any treatment (control subjects) or treated with propylthiouracil and/or propranolol hydrochloride and prednisone. The length of time for the thyroxine tests from diagnosis to the normal range was 57 +/- 17, 45 +/- 13, and 15 +/- 7 days (mean +/- SD) indicating a dramatic response to prednisone therapy but none to propylthiouracil and/or propranolol therapy. Five patients were found who had seven episodes of SRH while receiving thyroid hormone suppression therapy after having verified chronic LT (two patients) and LT-SRH (three patients). This indicates that thyroid suppression with thyroid hormone may be ineffective in preventing this disease. Two patients were treated by subtotal thyroidectomy because of recurrent or prolonged episodes of SRH. From this experience, the therapeutic alternatives available to the clinician are reviewed.", 
    "36": "Rolling mouse Nagoya (RMN), an ataxia mutant mouse, is adequate to checking up the efficacy of drugs on the ataxic movement disorders. The effects of some drugs on the ataxia of RMN were investigated by open field study. The drugs administered to RMN were as follows: TRH, FLA-63, DL-threo-DOPS, phenoxybenzamine and propranolol. Ataxic gait of RMN were remarkably improved by TRH, but remained unchanged by other drugs. The pretreatments with FLA-63, DOPS and phenoxybenzamine were not influenced to the antiataxic effects of TRH, while the pretreatment with propranolol increased the antiataxic effect of TRH in RMN. These results suggest that mechanism of the improvement of ataxic gait by TRH may not be sufficiently explained through only changing norepinephrine metabolism.", 
    "37": "The effect of beta-adrenergic stimulation on fetal cardiovascular function during hypoxemia was studied in six lamb fetuses with gestational ages of 119 to 140 days. In chronic preparations, we determined fetal heart rate, umbilical blood flow (by electromagnetic flowmeter), PO2, PCO2, and pH and calculated fetal cardiac output and organ blood flows (using 15 mu nuclide-labeled microspheres). Observations were made during control periods and periods of hypoxemia, beta-adrenergic blockade by propranolol, and hypoxemia superimposed upon the beta-adrenergic blockade. Beta blockade effected a decrease in fetal heart rate both at rest and with hypoxemic stress. Propranolol produced a fall in cardiac output with hypoxemia, but the meaning of this in regard to beta-adrenergic effects is unclear. Beta blockade did not alter fetal arterial pressure or general blood flow distribution. However, we observed a decrease in umbilical blood flow in response to propranolol under both normoxic and hypoxemic conditions.", 
    "38": "Six patients with hyperthyroxinemia (five men and one woman) were evaluated for possible hyperthyroidism. All were taking large daily doses of propranolol--480 +/- 155 (+/- SE) mg--for treatment of angina pectoris. The patients had no clinical evidence of hyperthyroidism, although three had small goiters. Further evaluation of the patients revealed elevated serum free thyroxine levels and/or free thyroxine index, low-normal serum triiodothyronine levels, and elevated serum reverse triiodothyronine levels in all six. The thyroid-stimulating hormone response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone was normal in two patients, subnormal in three patients, and absent in one patient. One patient was restudied while receiving low-dose propranolol (80 mg a day), with normalization of all thyroid functional parameters. The data suggest that the abnormalities seen in patients taking high doses of propranolol were due to drug-induced blockade of iodothyronine deiodination. Signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism are lacking in patients taking large doses of propranolol. If such a patient is discovered to have an elevated serum thyroxine level, a more complete evaluation of thyroid function is necessary before the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis can be made. The thyrotropin-releasing hormone test may be of particular value in this circumstance.", 
    "39": "TRH stimulation of prolactin release from GH3 cells is associated with loss of cellular Ca2+. Chlortetracycline (CTC), a fluorescent probe of Ca2+ in biological membranes, was previously employed to monitor indirectly changes in membrane Ca2+ in GH3 cells. Tetracaine, propranolol and trifluoperazine, agents that are known to displace Ca2+ from biological membranes, were utilized to demonstrate more rigorously that TRH affects cellular membrane Ca2+ in GH3 cells. Tetracaine (1 mM), propranolol (1 mM), and trifluoperazine (0.03 mM) inhibited basal and TRH-stimulated prolactin release, decreased cellular 45Ca2+ content and decreased cell-associated CTC fluorescence. Most importantly, these agents abolished the decrease in CTC fluorescence induced by TRH. These data suggest that tetracaine, propranolol and trifluoperazine displace membrane Ca2+ in intact GH3 cells and offer further evidence that TRH acts to mobilize cellular Ca2+ from a membrane-bound pool(s) during stimulation of GH3 cells.", 
    "40": "Combinations of antiarrhythmic drugs are frequently used to treat refractory ventricular tachycardia (VT), but few scientific data support this practice. We examined the efficacy and electrophysiology of 110 antiarrhythmic drug combination trials at electrophysiologic study in 74 patients with recurrent ventricular tachycardia. Lidocaine was combined with quinidine in 33 trials, procainamide in 22 and encainide in 20. Propranolol was combined with quinidine in 17 trials, procainamide in 12 and encainide in six. All individual drugs tested (except propranolol, which was usually not tested individually) had failed at electrophysiologic study or clinically in the presence of usually accepted plasma concentrations. Lidocaine in combination with quinidine was effective in 3% of the trials, with procanamide in 5% and with encainide in none of the trials. Propranolol in combination with quinidine was effective in 18% of the trials, with procainamide in 17% and with encainide in none of the trials. The electrophysiologic effects of the tested drug combinations were dominated by the individual effects of the type 1 antiarrhythmic agents. We conclude that the tested antiarrhythmic drug combinations are infrequently effective in preventing VT induction at electrophysiologic study when each agent has failed individually. The addition of lidocaine or propranolol to quinidine, procainamide or encainide does not produce significant synergistic or new effects on the electrophysiologic variables analyzed.", 
    "41": "The authors report the case of an term infant weighing 2,860 kgs, who presented with failure to thrive during the two first months of life. Clinical features suggested the diagnosis of leprechaunism. After a review of the literature, the authors conclude that the diagnosis of this rare condition is essentially a clinical one, as there are no specific laboratory tests.", 
    "42": "Our previously described HPLC method for the simultaneous analysis of several antiarrhythmic drugs and metabolites in serum [Clin. Biochem. 14. 113-118 (1981)] was correlated with an enzyme immunoassay technique (EMIT) for quinidine, procainamide, N-acetyl procainamide, and disopyramide. Correlation coefficients in each case was greater than 0.95. Our method compared favorably with a fluorescent procedure for the quantitation of propranolol in plasma. Interference studies with 34 drugs indicated that the measurements of quinidine and monodealkyldisopyramide were affected by quinine and lidocaine, respectively. Carbamazepine and glutethimide interfered with propranolol, but additional clean-up extractions removed these interferences.", 
    "43": "1 Chronic propranolol treatment has been previously shown to lower the plasma concentrations of LH and prolactin in normal male volunteers. 2 The effect of 2 weeks treatment with propranolol (80 mg twice daily) on the plasma concentrations of LH and prolactin has now been investigated in five post menopausal hypertensive women. 3 There was no significant effect of propranolol treatment on the basal plasma concentrations of either hormone. Both hormones showed significant increases in plasma concentration following GnRH stimulation and these increases were also unaffected by propranolol treatment.", 
    "44": "On topical application to rabbit eyes, the diacetate ester of nadolol was more easily absorbed into ocular tissue than nadolol and was enzymatically hydrolyzed to nadolol within the eye. In a 24-hour clinical study, the ocular hypotensive activities of 0.5% diacetyl nadolol, 2% diacetyl nadolol, 2% nadolol, and 0.5% timolol maleate in subjects with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were compared. Both concentrations of diacetyl nadolol significantly reduced intraocular pressure during the first six hours. Two percent diacetyl nadolol was as effective as 0.5% timolol maleate during the first eight hours. During the remainder of the testing period, timolol showed greater IOP control. Two percent diacetyl nadolol and 2% nadolol showed similar ocular hypotensive effects both in magnitude and duration in this short-term study.", 
    "45": "The effectiveness of cold exposure on the secretion of insulin and glucagon were examined using five adult sheep. Endocrine responses were studied in a warm environment and after cold exposure (0 C) from 4-19 days. Compared to levels at room temperature, basal plasma glucose levels were elevated during cold exposure, but basal levels of plasma insulin and glucagon were unchanged. Cold exposure significantly decreased the early insulin response to a primed iv infusion of glucose. Plasma glucose and glucagon levels during glucose infusion were unaffected by cold exposure. The decrease in plasma glucose after iv insulin injection (0.2 U/kg BW) was greater during cold exposure than at room temperature. Butyrate injection (0.625 mmol/kg, iv) resulted in a significantly lower secretion of both insulin and glucagon in the cold than in the warm environment. The glucagon response to arginine infusion (0.5 g/kg over 30 min, iv) was elevated by cold exposure, whereas the insulin response to arginine tended to be reduced. Propranolol infusion (20 micrograms/kg . min, iv) caused a slight inhibition of insulin secretion in the cold environment, but did not affect glucagon levels in either the cold or warm environment. Phentolamine infusion (20 micrograms/kg . min, iv) inhibited glucagon secretion, particularly in the cold environment, and caused a markedly greater stimulation of insulin secretion in the cold. It is concluded that cold exposure insufficient to cause hypothermia decreases insulin secretion in response to a variety of stimuli. Effects of cold on glucagon secretion depend upon the stimulating agent used.", 
    "46": "Our purpose was to describe changes in potassium disposition with antirenin antihypertensives during dynamic physical activity in normal subjects receiving methyldopa and propranolol. Before the study, 2 hr after dosing and coincident with immediate preexercise on treadmill (at graded increases of exercise), and 2 hr after exercise, blood was sampled for determination of potassium, renin, aldosterone, and catecholamine levels. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured. The results demonstrate no greater increase in potassium after single or multiple doses of methyldopa than after placebo. After the first dose of propranolol there was a greater rise in potassium over that with placebo, but it was not observed after multiple doses, which may be related to the low doses. There were minor, but significant, changes in norepinephrine, renin, and systolic pressure with multiple-dose methyldopa and in renin, heart rate, and systolic and diastolic pressure with propranolol. Overall, the adrenergic responses to exercise win methyldopa and propranolol were biochemically altered rather than functionally impaired. The latter is related to dose and the underlying age and state of health of our subjects. Methyldopa (or clonidine) may be useful in patients with hypertension who exercise and are predisposed to pertubations in potassium disposition.", 
    "47": "Human pancreatic polypeptide (HPP) increases after insulin-induced hypoglycemia. To determine whether adrenergic mechanisms contribute to this increase in normal man, six subjects were studied on two occasions: once after insulin alone and once after insulin plus simultaneous alpha (phentolamine)- and beta (propranolol)-adrenergic blockade. Despite comparable hypoglycemia (51 +/- 4 vs. 49 +/- 4 mg/dl), the increase in HPP did not differ in the presence or absence of adrenergic blockade (721 +/- 215 vs. 736 +/- 193 pg/ml, respectively). These findings suggest that HPP secretion during hypoglycemia is not dependent on adrenergic mechanisms.", 
    "48": "1 Propranolol (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) but not metoprolol (0.2 mg/kg i.v.) pretreatment increased the spontaneous motility triggered by progressive filling of rat urinary bladder without a concomitant effect on bladder capacity, except at high filling volumes. Compared to controls, the spontaneous motility of urinary bladder in propranolol pretreated rats displayed a higher frequency, indicating the existence of a tonic sympathetic inhibition. 2 beta-adrenoreceptor stimulation by isoprenaline (0.1-10 microgram/kg i.v.) or terbutaline (0.1-1 mg/kg i.v.) in vivo produced a dose dependent inhibition of bladder spontaneous motility which was antagonized by propranolol (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) but not by metoprolol (0.2 mg/kg i.v.). Propranolol (0.2 mg/kg i.v.) pretreatment did not antagonize the inhibition of bladder motility produced by intravenous papaverine (0.5 mg/kg). 3 Propranolol (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) significantly antagonized the isoprenaline-induced tachycardia (beta 1 mediated) and fall in diastolic blood pressure (beta 2 mediated) while metoprolol (0.2 mg/kg i.v.) antagonism was confined to beta 1 mediated responses. 4 Isoprenaline (0.25-1.5 microM) inhibited in a concentration dependent manner field stimulation induced contractions of rat detrusor muscle strips as did tetrodotoxin (0.5 microM). Hexamethonium (50 microM) had no inhibitory effect. 5 Our in vivo findings support the view that beta 2-adrenoreceptors are responsible for modulating bladder motility mainly by suppressing the onset of spontaneous contractions.", 
    "49": "We undertook studies to determine whether secretagogue action on the exocrine pancreas and parotid is accompanied by phosphorylation of proteins in intact cells. For this purpose, rat pancreatic, and parotid lobules were preincubated with 32Pi for 45 min at 37 degrees C, washed, and then incubated at 37 degrees C in the presence or absence of secretagogues that effect discharge through different second messengers. Among a variety of polypeptides exhibiting enhanced phosphorylation in pancreatic lobules upon a 30-s incubation in the presence of the secretagogues carbamylcholine, cholecystokinin octapeptide, or secretin, one species with an Mr of 29,000 was especially notable for three reasons: (a) its enhanced level of phosphorylation was dependent on the dose of secretagogue used and was still apparent after incubation for 30 min at 37 degrees C; (b) an analogous phosphorylated polypeptide was observed in isoproterenol-stimulated parotid lobules; and (c) in both tissues its selective dephosphorylation was observed upon termination of stimulation by administration of atropine to carbamylcholine-stimulated pancreatic lobules and propranolol to isoproterenol-stimulated parotid lobules. These results suggest that the phosphorylation of one protein with an Mr of 29,000 is closely correlated both temporally and in a dose-dependent fashion with secretagogue action in both the exocrine pancreas and parotid.", 
    "50": "The effect of adrenaline, noradrenaline, isoproterenol and dibutyryl cyclic AMP on the rate of sterol synthesis was studied in freshly isolated human mononuclear cells. Incubation of cells in a medium containing lipid depleted serum led to a two-fold rise in the rate of sterol synthesis from [14C]acetate. Adrenaline, nor-adrenaline and isoproterenol added in a concentration of 2 X 10(-5) mol/l at zero-time resulted in an inhibition of 30% of this increase in sterol synthesis after 4 h, but had no effect when the hormones were given at 4 h. This indicates that the catecholamines require some time to exert their inhibitory action on sterol synthesis. The action of catecholamines on the incorporation of [14C]acetate into sterols could be mimicked by dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Propranolol added in increasing concentrations to the incubation medium diminished or totally prevented the inhibitory effect of adrenaline, noradrenaline and isoproterenol on sterol synthesis. The results indicate that cholesterol synthesis in extrahepatic human cells, regulated predominantly by low density lipoprotein derived from plasma, is under additional control of catecholamines which may act via cyclic AMP.", 
    "51": "Beta adrenergic receptors from membrane fragments of pigmented sheep eyes were studied and characterised by ligand binding techniques after the removal of melanin. In a representative experiment the beta max (total number of beta receptors) was 394.9 fmol/mg protein. The receptor affinity (Ka) was 440 pM. The potency series of drugs to displace 125I-HYP from the receptors was timolol = (-) propranolol greater than (+) propranolol greater than salbutamol greater than practolol. beta 1 Receptors were not detected in the ciliary processes. beta 2 Receptors were the prominent adrenergic receptors present. The theory as to how beta blockers work in glaucoma, their site of action, and the potential role of beta 2 blockers for use in intraocular pressure control is discussed.", 
    "52": "Prolactin possesses positive inotropic actions in isolated heart preparations although the mechanism of this influence is not understood. Our study was designed to investigate the mechanism of this effect on the rat heart. Prolactin (50 ng/ml) produced a time-dependent increase (60%) in contractile force that reached maximum after 30 min and remained steady for a further 30 min. A similar time-dependent phenomenon was seen with 200 ng/ml prolactin although the maximum inotropic effect was reduced. Indomethacin (30 micrograms/ml) significantly reduced the inotropic effect of both prolactin concentrations although the effect of the hormone was not related to the release of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, the prostacyclin metabolite. Propranolol (1-20 micrograms/ml) significantly reduced the positive inotropic effect of prolactin. Prolactin however had no influence on myocardial adenylate cyclase activity. Hearts that were removed from animals pretreated with 1.25 or 2.50 mg/kg reserpine did not respond to prolactin administration. It is suggested that the inotropic influence of prolactin is mediated by endogenous catecholamine liberation.", 
    "53": "The purpose of this study was to elucidate the type of adrenoceptor that mediates the effect of adrenergic stimuli on prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in the isolated rabbit heart and to determine the relationship of the released PGs to the mechanical changes elicited by catecholamines and stimulation of the cardiac sympathetic nerves. The output of 6-keto PGF1 alpha, PGE2 and PGF2 alpha was increased by electrical stimulation of the sympathetic nerves, norepinephrine, isoproterenol, dobutamine and angiotensin II, but not by phenylephrine or isoetharine. Propranolol or atenolol, but not phentolamine or butoxamine, blocked the output of PGs elicited by adrenergic stimuli. Indomethacin prevented the increase in PG formation caused by all stimuli. Moreover, the adrenergically induced release of PGs was not related to changes in heart rate, systolic tension or vascular tone elicited by the adrenergic stimuli. These data indicate that the adrenergically induced release of PGs in the isolated rabbit heart is due to the activation of beta-1 adrenoceptors and is independent of the mechanical effects produced by the adrenergic stimuli.", 
    "54": "The specific binding of IgG2a or IgG2b subclass monoclonal anti-sheep erythrocyte antibodies to P388D1 cell surface Fc gamma 2aR3 or Fc gamma 2bR, respectively, triggered the synthesis of adenosine-3'5'-monophosphate (cAMP) to an approximately same extent by the mechanisms that are apparently unique for each type of Fc gamma Rs. Fc gamma 2aR appeared to trigger directly, upon binding of IgG2a antibodies, the adenylate cyclase system without requiring the participation of guanine nucleotide-binding (G/F) regulatory protein, because the Fc gamma 2aR-triggered cAMP synthesis, which reached maximum within 30 min, was not significantly affected by an uncoupler, Mn++ or by addition of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) analog, 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p). In contrast, Fc gamma 2bR appeared to stimulate indirectly the G/F regulatory requiring-adenylate cyclase system by generating prostaglandins, since the cAMP synthesis, which required 90 min to reach plateau after binding of IgG2b to Fc gamma 2bR, was totally suppressed by phospholipase A2 inhibitor (p-bromophenacylbromide) or cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor (indomethacin), partially suppressed by Mn++, and slightly increased by Gpp(NH)p. Furthermore, the inhibition of phagocytic process by cytochalasin D increased cAMP synthesis mediated by Fc gamma 2aR (about 70% at 2 micrograms/ml), but did not affect Fc gamma 2bR-mediated cAMP synthesis. In addition, our data suggested that both Fc gamma 2aR- and Fc gamma 2bR-mediated cAMP synthesis are independent from beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated stimulation of the adenylate cyclase system, since either beta-agonist (isoproterenol) or beta-antagonist (propranolol) did not affect significantly the levels of cAMP produced in response to EA-stimulation.", 
    "55": "The influence of cimetidine (1000 mg daily, one day oral pretreatment) and ranitidine (300 mg daily by mouth, 1 and 6 days pretreatment) on steady-state propranolol (160 mg sustained-release capsule, once daily) plasma levels (Psss) and dynamic beta-blocker effects was assessed by bicycle ergometer exercise and isoproterenol sensitivity test in five normal subjects. During the 3 hr of the dynamic tests Psss were elevated from 25% to 67% by cimetidine, whereas Pss was unchanged by ranitidine. The estimated hepatic blood flow (EHBF) as calculated from indocyanine green (ICG) plasma clearance was only slightly reduced by 15 +/- 23% (mean +/- SD, n = 4) after one oral dose of 150 mg ranitidine and showed substantial intersubject variability. Dynamic parameters, like propranolol-induced heart rate and blood pressure changes under physical exercise or during the isoproterenol sensitivity test, were not influenced by ranitidine or cimetidine. Since our study was performed on normal subjects with relatively low propranolol doses these results do not rule out the risk of severe reinforcement of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking effects if propranolol and cimetidine are taken together by patients.", 
    "56": "The ability of N-acylethanolamines (pharmacologically active lipid metabolites which accumulate in canine myocardium during experimentally induced infarctions) to alter Ca2+ fluxes in a biological membrane system was studied using sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle. The effects of two N-acylethanolamines, the N-oleyl and N-lauryl derivatives, were compared to those of the lipophilic drugs, dibucaine and propranolol. The rate and extent of Ca2+ sequestration, Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase activity and retention time of Ca2+ by the vesicles were all stimulated at low concentrations of the four compounds studied and inhibited at higher concentrations. The stoichiometry between Ca2+-pumping rates and ATPase activity was partially \"uncoupled\" indicating that both the calcium pump and the membrane permeability were affected by the drugs. However, although all four compounds exhibited the same qualitative behavior, the effects of the two N-acylethanolamines were more pronounced than dibucaine and propranolol and occurred at much lower concentrations. These results suggest that the N-acylethanolamines may have important physiological effects in the myocardium and, at least at lower concentrations, stimulate myocardial contractility by increasing the rate of calcium flux across the sarcoplasmic reticulum.", 
    "57": "Diphenylhydantoin and diphenyl-thio-hydantoin inhibited the spontaneous motility of rat uterus in a dose-dependent manner. On molar basis diphenyl-thio-hydantoin was found to be 2.7 times as potent as diphenylhydantoin. The stimulant effects of acetylcholine, oxytocin, adenosine triphosphate, prostaglandins I2 and E2 were reduced by both hydantoins. Furthermore, hydantoins potentiated the inhibitory effects of sympathomimetic amines, theophylline, nitroglycerin and dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate. The uterine inhibitory actions of adrenaline, isoprenaline and phenylephrine were antagonized by propranolol but not by phentolamine. However, adrenergic blocking agents were ineffective against hydantoins indicating that their effects were not mediated through adrenergic receptors. Ouabain and sodium fluoride caused stimulation of uterine motility. Pre-treatment with ouabain did not block the inhibitory effect of hydantoins, while, sodium fluoride antagonized the inhibitory effects of hydantoins. Furthermore, even increasing the diphenylhydantoin concentration 10 times did not produce any relaxation in the presence of sodium fluoride. The results are discussed in relation to the effect of hydantoins on sodium pump and on membrane permeability.", 
    "58": "Suppression of platelet function is thought to be a mechanism of propranolol's beneficial action in angina pectoris. To study the effects of propranolol on platelets, we measured plasma beta thromboglobulin and plasma thromboxane B2 (TXB2, stable metabolite of TXA2) levels by radioimmunoassay as indexes of platelet alpha-granule and TXA2 release, respectively. Platelet TXA2 generation in vitro in response to arachidonate and thrombin was also quantitated. Twenty-nine patients with coronary disease -- 15 not taking propranolol (group A) and 14 taking propranolol (group B) -- and 15 normal subjects were studied. Plasma beta-thromboglobulin levels were increased in group A and B patients (mean 63 +/- 8 and 96 +/- 14 ng/ml, respectively) compared with normal subjects (mean 46 +/- 6 ng/ml). Plasma TXB2 levels were similar in group A and B patients and in normal subjects (mean 148 +/- 41, 149 +/- 36 and 216 +/- 39 pg/ml). Arachidonate-induced platelet TXA2 generation was significantly higher in group A patients than in normal subjects (725 +/- 393 vs 82 +/- 25 pg TXB2/10(8) platelets, p less than 0.001). In contrast, platelets from group B patients had very low TXA2 generation (mean 21 +/- 18 pg) compared with platelets from group A patients or normal subjects (p less than 0.001). Similar results were obtained using thrombin. These data show that propranolol therapy does not affect platelet-released beta thromboglobulin or TXA2 at rest, but significantly reduces the capability of platelets to generate TXA2 in vitro. Reduction in platelet TXA2 generation may be an important mechanism of action of propranolol in patients with coronary artery disease."
