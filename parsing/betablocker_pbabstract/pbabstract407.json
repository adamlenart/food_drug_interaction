A sex bias in considering revascularization in men and women with coronary heart disease has been reported. The influence of gender on treatment given to patients with an acute myocardial infarction has not been investigated. From 1989 to 1991 there were 1515 patients with acute myocardial infarction admitted to the coronary care unit at Ostra Hospital; 67% were men. Pharmacological treatment limiting infarct size was given to 60% of all women and to 67% of all men; p < 0.05. In addition, coronary angiography during the hospital stay was performed in 0.2% of all women vs 1.9% of all men; p < 0.05. The prevalence of diabetes, age, symptoms or prehospital delay cannot explain these findings. While a sex bias in referring patients for revascularization has been reported, this report also describes a possible sex bias in the pharmacological treatment of acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "1": "Nifedipine and atenolol are first choice drugs in the treatment of arterial hypertension and angina pectoris. In both these pathologies the administration of nifedipine and atenolol in free or fixed combinations has proved extremely efficacious in patients who were not adequately controlled by either drug in monotherapy. A fixed combination of intestinal slow-release nifedipine and atenolol (Niften) was recently developed and has already undergone several comparative and double-blind clinical trials for the treatment of arterial hypertension and angina pectoris. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of atenolol and nifedipine are not altered when these drugs are administered in fixed or free combination. It has been shown that the nifedipine-atenolol combination causes anti-hypertensive and anti-anginous effects at doses which are lower, for either of its two components, in comparison to the doses required to achieve the same effects using monotherapy. In arterial hypertension a clinically striking anti-hypertensive effect on systolic and diastolic levels is maintained for 24 hours after a single administration of slow-release nifedipine 20 mg+atenolol 50 mg. In angina pectoris, this dose must be administered every 12 hours to ensure a constant and prolonged effect of the calcium antagonist component. The association of nifedipine and atenolol does not induce notable depressive effects on myocardial contractility, except in patients with severely compromised basal resting contractile function.", 
    "2": "1. The study was carried out in adult patients having normal cardiovascular reflexes and no brain stem lesions. They were exposed to ambient temperature of 72-74 degrees F. Injections of agonists and antagonists of receptors were made into the lateral cerebral ventricles of these patients through diagnostic burr hole in the skull. 2. Noradrenaline, adrenaline and dopamine evoked hypotension and bradycardia. While the core temperature was reduced by nor-adrenaline and adrenaline, dopamine evoked hyperthermia. Isoprenaline elicited hypertension, tachycardia and hyperthermia. Opposite cardiovascular and thermal effects were observed with blockade of alpha 1-, beta-and dopamine receptors with prazosin, propranolol and haloperidol respectively. 3. Injection of 5-hydroxytryptamine resulted in hypertension, tachycardia and hyperthermia but hypotension, bradycardia and hypothermia were seen with methysergide. 4. Similarly, carbachol injection caused initial excitatory followed by inhibitory cardiovascular responses. These were associated with hypothermia. On the contrary atropine per se elicited hypertension, tachycardia and hyperthermia. 5. Thus, alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptors, dopaminergic, serotonergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors are present in human brain which appear to modulate cardiovascular activity and core temperature.", 
    "3": "GABAergic mechanisms have been implicated in the bilateral olfactory bulbectomy (OBX) animal model of depression, where GABAB receptor binding sites have been shown to decrease markedly at specific time points after OBX. However, as no detailed time course of events has been determined, the present study investigated the effects of OBX on high-affinity GABAA, GABAB, beta-adrenergic, and benzodiazepine receptor binding parameters in membrane preparations from rat brain regions at weekly intervals (1-4 weeks) after OBX. Persistent significant increases (40-60%) in Bmax values of high affinity GABAA receptors were observed in the frontal cortex throughout the period investigated following OBX. Bmax values in the hippocampus increased significantly after 1 week (53%) but were not statistically significant thereafter. No changes in GABAA binding parameters were observed in the hypothalamus or cerebellum. Conversely, GABAB receptor densities were significantly decreased in the frontal cortex after 1 (-38%) and 2 (-41%) weeks and moderately decreased 3 and 4 weeks (-27 and -23%, respectively) after OBX, while in the cerebellum they were significantly increased after 1 week (96%) and returned to sham-operated levels by 3 weeks. No changes in GABAB receptor binding parameters were observed in the hippocampus or hypothalamus. Binding parameters for benzodiazepine receptor binding sites or beta-adrenoceptors were not modified throughout the time course. GABAergic transmission, reflected by changes in GABAA and GABAB receptor density in the frontal cortex, may be altered in OBX rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "4": "The effects of various beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists on nicotine-induced tail-tremor were investigated in rats. Atenolol (5 and 10 mg/kg, IP), arotinolol (5 and 10 mg/kg, IP), and carteolol (5 and 10 mg/kg, IP), hydrophilic beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, did not affect the tail-tremor induced by nicotine given at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg SC. However, propranolol (5-20 mg/kg, IP) and pindolol (5-20 mg/kg, IP), nonselective and lipophilic beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, did suppress the tail-tremor dose dependently. In contrast, metoprolol (5-20 mg/kg, IP), lipophilic and beta 1-selective adrenergic receptor antagonists, did not show such an effect. These results suggest that nicotine-induced tail-tremors may be mediated through central beta 2-adrenergic receptors as an appearance and developmental mechanism.", 
    "5": "The effects of desipramine, tranylcypromine, and phenelzine on beta-adrenoceptor subtype binding were measured in rat cerebral cortex and cerebellum. The drugs were administered to male Sprague Dawley rats for 28 d sc via 2ML4 Alzet osmotic minipumps (desipramine HCl 10, tranylcypromine HCl 1, phenelzine sulfate 5, 10 mg kg-1/d). Binding of [3H]CGP 12177 was measured to determine total beta-adrenoceptor density in each brain region. The relative densities of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors were directly calculated from competition analysis using ICI 89406 to displace [3H]CGP 12177. beta 1-Adrenoceptor density was decreased in cortical tissue following each antidepressant treatment, but no effects on beta 2-adrenoceptor density were evident. With cerebellar tissue, despite a higher density of beta 2-adrenoceptors in this area, no effects of antidepressants on beta 2-adrenoceptor density were evident. The present data confirm and extend previous reports of beta 1- but not beta 2-adrenoceptor downregulation in brain following chronic antidepressant drug treatment.", 
    "6": "The polymorphic ventricular tachycardia torsade de pointes can occur in the congenital long QT syndromes or as a consequence of therapy with QT-prolonging drugs. The latter can include not only antiarrhythmic drugs such as quinidine, but also a number of drugs which are not usually considered to have major cardiovascular effects: these include nonsedating antihistamines, such as terfenadine; antibiotics such as erythromycin; and neuroleptics such as thioridazine. The electrocardiographic hallmark of both the congenital and acquired forms of the long QT syndrome is marked QT(U) lability, particularly as a function of heart rate. The underlying mechanism is thought to be triggered activity arising as a consequence of early afterdepolarizations. An understanding of the basic mechanism has led to an understanding of the effective forms of therapy, which include maneuvers to include the heart rate (pacing, isoproterenol) as well as maneuvers which may not necessarily alter the QT interval but may prevent the arrhythmia (magnesium, beta blockers). Intensive study of the clinical features and basic mechanisms underlying torsade de pointes has led to the definition of a new mechanism for cardiac arrhythmias; understanding such mechanisms may ultimately lead to the development of safer antiarrhythmic therapy.", 
    "7": "Carvedilol, a lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with vasodilating activities, is characterized by a high as well as stereoselective metabolic clearance and distribution volume. Tissue distribution of carvedilol enantiomers and their conjugates were determined under steady-state conditions in rats (p.o., 10 mg/kg, repetitive dosage; n = 5) and after single i.v. administration in control rats and rats with surgical portacaval shunt (pcs) (10 mg/kg; n = 3 each group). In addition, in vitro plasma protein binding was evaluated. The plasma protein binding of carvedilol in rats is > 98% for total plasma (tp) and > 96% for rat serum albumin (rsa) solution (4%), with enantioselectivity ratios of 1.53 (tp) and 1.27 (rsa). Significantly higher unbound fractions were observed in pcs rats, in part due to reduced protein concentrations. In contrast to plasma, where a preponderance of the R-enantiomer with an S/R ratio of 0.6 was found, S-carvedilol was predominant in all tissues (heart, liver, kidneys, lung, spleen, muscle, and adipose tissue), with S/R ratios of 1.3-1.4 in most of these tissues and 2.3 in liver. This preferential tissue partitioning of S-carvedilol was in accordance with its higher unbound fraction in plasma. Carvedilol accumulated predominantly in the highly perfused and/or eliminating organs liver, kidneys, and lung (tissue/plasma ratios; lung: S 76, R 34; liver: S 21, R 5; kidney: S 8, R 3). A similarly enantioselective distribution into the heart of control as well as pcs rats was observed, where the S-enantiomer concentrations exceeded the plasma concentrations 7-fold.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "8": "Although beta-agonists remain an important aspect of the treatment of asthma, their role has recently been questioned. Salmeterol has recently been developed as a beta-agonist with prolonged bronchodilator action. Using lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence, we have shown that salmeterol inhibits this aspect of phagocyte function in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner. However, salmeterol differs from classical beta 2-agonists in that at concentrations between 10(-5) and 10(-3) mol/L, its effects on phagocytes cannot be completely reversed by washing the cells or by propranolol. The effects on phagocytes may not therefore be explicable on the basis of beta-adrenergic mechanisms alone.", 
    "9": "The importance of the cholinergic innervation of the neocortex in cognitive functions has been shown in a number of clinical and animal studies. Until recently, attempts to study the mode of action of acetylcholine in the neocortex have concentrated on muscarinic effects, whereas cholinergic actions mediated by nicotinic receptors have been difficult to demonstrate. The present work was undertaken to study the mechanism of action of nicotinic agents on cortical neurons and compare it to muscarinic effects by means of intracellular recordings in a slice preparation. The study was performed in the prelimbic area of the rat prefrontal cortex, a cortical region particularly involved in cognitive processes. Recordings were made from pyramidal cells located in layers II/III and synaptic potentials were evoked by stimulation of superficial cortical layers. Iontophoretic applications of nicotinic agonists (nicotine, dimethylphenylpiperazinium, cytisine) increased the amplitude of the monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potential mediated by non-N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors in 14% (22/159) of cells. This effect was abolished by the selective nicotinic blocker, neuronal bungarotoxin (IC50 = 0.6-0.7 microM) and by dihydro-beta-erythroidine (IC50 = 20-30 microM), whereas hexamethonium, mecamylamine, curare and alpha-bungarotoxin were ineffective. The nicotinic agonists did not change resting membrane potential, input resistance or current-voltage relationship. They also did not affect the depolarizations produced by glutamate applied by iontophoresis in the somatic or dendritic area. In contrast, the muscarinic agonists (muscarine, acetyl-beta-methylcholine) decreased the amplitude of the excitatory postsynaptic potential in 100% of the neurons tested. Atropine was more effective (IC50 = 0.08 microM) than pirenzepine (IC50 = 2 microM) to antagonize the muscarinic action. These effects were observed in the absence of any direct postsynaptic change in membrane potential or input resistance, provided that the site of the iontophoretic application was more than 100 microM distant from the soma. The muscarinic agonists did not influence the actions of iontophoretically applied glutamate. These results suggest that nicotinic and muscarinic agonists modulate excitatory synaptic transmission mediated at dendritic sites by non-N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors, possibly through a presynaptic action. Thus ascending cholinergic systems may take part in information processing in the prefrontal cortex through the control of ongoing excitation to pyramidal cells.", 
    "10": "Coupling of the previously characterized beta1- and beta2-like adrenoceptors in the sea pansy Renilla koellikeri with adenylate cyclase was examined in membrane preparations from this cnidarian. Adenylate cyclase activity was stimulated by several guanine nucleotides, such as GTP, Gpp(NH)p and GTPgammaS. Fluoride ions and cholera toxin greatly enhanced the enzyme activity, whereas forskolin had no effect on basal or isoproterenol-induced stimulation of the enzyme. The stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity by several beta-adrenergic agonists in different parts of the animal reflected a positive coupling with the beta2- and beta1-like adrenoceptors in autozooid and peduncle tissues, respectively. In addition, isoproterenol-induced stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity was dependent on guanine nucleotides, suggesting coupling mediated by a G protein. The pharmacological profile of various antagonists on isoproterenol-sensitive adenylate cyclase in autozooid and peduncle tissues matched that of previous radioligand binding studies. Isoproterenol-induced stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity in rachidial tissues was partially inhibited by trifluoperazine of (+/-)CGP12177 and was completely blocked in the presence of both antagonists. This suggests that coupling of the enzyme occurs with beta1- and beta2-like adrenoceptors, both being present in the rachis. Serotonin and dopamine were also found to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity. Their stimulatory effect was additive to isoproterenol-induced activation, suggesting the presence of dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors in the tissues of the sea pansy. Along with the data presented previously on beta-adrenergic binding, this study suggests that elements of receptor-dependent G protein signal transduction originated early in invertebrate evolution.", 
    "11": "The objective of this study was to determine the influence of drug lipophilicity on extent of systemic absorption and relative contributions of the nasal and conjunctival mucosae to systemic absorption following topical solution instillation in the pigmented rabbit. Relatively hydrophilic atenolol, moderately lipophilic timolol and levobunolol, and lipophilic betaxolol were chosen as model drugs. Twenty-five microliters of a 15 mM drug solution in isotonic pH 7.4 buffer was instilled in each eye, with or without nasolacrimal occlusion, and plasma drug concentration was monitored using reversed phase HPLC. An equivalent amount of all four beta adrenergic antagonists was instilled directly into the nasolacrimal duct to assess the nasal contribution to systemic drug absorption following topical solution instillation. The systemic bioavailability ranged from 61% for atenolol to 100% for timolol. At least 50% of the systemically absorbed drug reached the bloodstream from the nasal mucosa; the nasal contribution was 83% for atenolol and 55-74% for the other three drugs. Occluding the nasolacrimal duct for 5 min reduced the extent of systemic absorption of timolol and levobunolol but did not do so for atenolol and betaxolol. Additional prolongation of solution retention in the conjunctival sac brought about further reduction for only atenolol (480-min prolongation) and timolol (120-min prolongation). Taken together, the above findings suggest that the systemic bioavailability of topically applied ophthalmic drugs would be modest for drugs at the extremes of lipophilicity and that the contribution of the nasal pathway to systemically absorbed drug diminishes with increasing drug lipophilicity.", 
    "12": "The magnitude and biological relevance in vivo of the beta-blocking properties, observed in vitro, of propafenone remains controversial. We studied the effects of propafenone on the heart rate response to graded stimulation of the right stellate ganglion in 13 anaesthetized, vagotomized cats. The decentralized ganglion was stimulated (3 ms, 10 to 15 V) for periods of 45 s at frequencies from 1 to 14 Hz. The effects of sympathetic stimulation on heart rate were evaluated by the relationship between stimulation frequency and changes in heart rate from control. The relationship was significantly displaced downward and to the right by propafenone (4 mg.kg-1, n = 7), indicating a blunted response to sympathetic stimulation. This effect was lost at the highest frequencies. The frequency range at which propafenone was effective is the same as that elicited in cardiac sympathetic nerves by acute myocardial ischaemia. With propranolol (0.5 mg.kg-1 n = 4), the effects on the heart rate response were similar but of greater magnitude. Another sodium channel blocker (flecainide, 4 mg.kg-1 n = 2) was administered, and no changes were observed in the heart rate response. Thus, propafenone has significant beta-blocking effects, which would be of clinical relevance during the reflex sympathetic activation consequent to myocardial ischaemia.", 
    "13": "Epidemiologic surveys have shown increased morbidity and mortality for asthma, especially in the elderly population. Although the majority of patients with asthma have their onset of disease as children or young adults, new-onset asthma may occur at any age, even in the eighth and ninth decades. When asthma begins at an advanced age, symptoms are typical of young adults, but medication requirements to maintain normalcy are often high.", 
    "14": "Effects of i.v. administration of N- and M-cholinergic blocking agents ganglerone and atropine and alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking agents phentolamine and obsidan (propranolol) on reaction of desynchronisation of EEG and on autonomic reactions (arterial blood pressure, heart and respiratory rates) evoked by low- and high frequency stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus were studied in hens. It was shown that atropine induces a pharmacological dissociation of ascending and descending influences of the hypothalamus by blocking the desynchronizing mechanisms of the upward discharge of the hypothalamus without any apparent changes of autonomic reactions. It was found that the effects of adrenoblocking agents are diametrically opposite to that of atropine in regard to the EEG component, as well as the autonomic components of hypothalamically induced activation reaction. Peculiarities of evolutionary development of neurochemical structures of ascending and descending systems of the hypothalamus are discussed.", 
    "15": "Experiments were performed to investigate the presence and nature of beta-adrenoceptors in blood vessels supplying the posterior capsule of the rabbit knee joint. Electrical stimulation of the posterior articular nerve (PAN) and close intra-arterial injection of adrenaline produced vasoconstriction which reversed to vasodilatation with administration of the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phenoxybenzamine. In almost all animals close intra-arterial injection of the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline resulted in vasodilatation. Injection of the more selective beta-agonists dobutamine, salbutamol and terbutaline also produced vasodilatation with a rank potency order of isoprenaline > dobutamine > salbutamol > or = terbutaline. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol abolished the dilator responses to adrenaline and isoprenaline, and significantly reduced the dilator responses to PAN stimulation in phenoxybenzamine-treated animals. Nerve-mediated vasodilatation was also reduced by the substance P antagonist D-Pro4 D-Trp7,9,10 SP4-11, suggesting that substance P contributes to this dilatation. Dobutamine, a selective beta 1-agonist, produced vasodilatation which was abolished by administration of the selective beta 1-antagonist atenolol. Isoprenaline-induced vasodilatation was substantially reduced by atenolol. The dilator response to isoprenaline appeared to be unaffected by the selective beta 2-antagonist ICI118551, but the weak dilator responses to the selective beta 2-agonists salbutamol and terbutaline were significantly reduced by this antagonist. The results of this study suggest that beta-adrenoceptors appear to be involved in the sympathetic regulation of rabbit knee joint blood flow, and that this is predominantly mediated via beta 1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "16": "The role of nitric oxide in the gut in response to sympathetic nerve stimulation has not been examined.

    "18": "The predominant response to HGNS was an elevation of the resting tone in the IAS. The other responses of infrequent nature were a decrease in the IASP and a biphasic response (an initial increase followed by a decrease in the IASP). beta-Adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol had no significant effect on the increase in the IASP by HGNS but almost abolished the decrease in the IASP caused by HGNS and unmasked the excitatory responses. The IAS responses to HGNS were frequency dependent and abolished by guanethidine (adrenergic blocker). L-NNA caused significant and stereoselective suppression of all IAS responses to HGNS. The suppressed HGNS responses were completely reversed by the NO precursor L-arginine stereoselectively. The NO synthase inhibitor and guanethidine had no effect on the increase in IASP by phenylephrine.",

    "20": "L. donovani promastigotes (MHOM/ET/67/HA3) transport adenosine by a route that is sensitive to inhibition by a nonspecific channel blocker, propranolol. At the logarithmic and stationary phases of growth, the transport of 1 microM-3H-adenosine was significantly inhibited (40-50%) by 100 microM-propranolol. In contrast, a strain of Leishmania donovani promastigotes clonally selected to grow in defined medium was only slightly (approximately 10%) inhibited at the logarithmic but not at the stationary phase. These results suggest that the differences in expression of adenosine in the parasites previously reported, may be related to uptake by a channel-like pathway in the promastigotes.", 
    "21": "1. Effects of histamine (HIS) and cimetidine (CIM) on the spontaneous action potentials and ionic currents in rabbit sino-atrial node cells were investigated. 2. HIS accelerated the sinus rate at 10 mumol/l, and shortened the action potential duration (APD) at 100 mumol/l, significantly. The positive effects were blocked by CIM (100 mumol/l), but not by diphenhydramine (DPH, 1 mumol/l). HIS (100 mumol/l) elicited a dysrhythmia in 4 out of 10 preparations. Addition of acetylcholine (ACh) (1 mumol/l) depressed the HIS-induced effects, but dysrhythmia occurred in 5 of 10 preparations. 3. CIM (100 mumol/l) caused a negative chronotropic effect. The APD was prolonged, and the Vmax was decreased. Addition of pindolol (0.1 mumol/l) potentiated the depressions. CIM (3 mmol/l) caused a sinus arrest in 3 out of 7 preparations. 4. In voltage-clamp experiments, HIS (100 mumol/l) enhanced the slow inward current (Isi). The delayed rectifying K+ current (IK) and hyperpolarization-activated inward current (Ih) were also increased. The enhancement was inhibited by CIM (100 mumol/l), but not by DPH (1 mumol/l). CIM (100 mumol/l) alone depressed Isi, IK and Ih. Pindolol (0.1 mumol/l) potentiated the CIM-induced depressions significantly. 5. These results suggest that HIS and CIM would modulate the ionic currents mediated through H2-receptors, and that HIS possesses arrhythmogenic action (probably by cAMP accumulation), which is potentiated by ACh.", 
    "22": "Chronic therapy with the beta 1-selective adrenoceptor partial agonist xamoterol is not associated with the tolerance observed with other beta-adrenoceptor agonists. A possible explanation is that xamoterol therapy does not desensitise human cardiac beta-adrenoceptors in vivo. beta-Adrenoceptor density and adenylate cyclase activities were determined in right atrial appendages obtained from 40 patients randomised in a double-blind fashion to receive either xamoterol or atenolol for at least 5 weeks before coronary artery bypass surgery. There was no significant difference in total or subtype beta-adrenoceptor densities, but basal and isoproterenol stimulated adenylate cyclase activity were significantly greater in the atenolol-treated group, as was the intrinsic activity of the beta 2-adrenoceptor partial agonist procaterol, suggesting that chronic therapy with xamoterol does not downregulate human cardiac beta-adrenoceptors in vivo. Coupling of beta-adrenoceptors to adenylate cyclase, predominantly mediated by the beta 2 subtype, is enhanced, however, after therapy with atenolol relative to therapy with xamoterol.", 
    "23": "Inotropic effects of histamine have been studied extensively in many species, but data on porcine myocardium, often used as a model for human heart, are not available. We investigated inotropic effects of histamine on atrial and ventricular trabeculae obtained from porcine hearts. For comparison, we also evaluated the effects of histamine on human myocardium. Histamine caused concentration-dependent increases in contractile force in porcine and human atrial tissue [at 1 x 10(-3) M: 267 +/- 70 and 317 +/- 81 mg, or 133 +/- 17 and 85 +/- 12% of the response to 1 x 10(-5) M norepinephrine (NE), respectively], as well as in porcine and human ventricular tissue (at 1 x 10(-3) M: 592 +/- 148 and 773 +/- 203 mg, or 68 +/- 13 and 122 +/- 61% of response to 1 x 10(-5) M NE, respectively). Cimetidine, but not mepyramine, antagonized the contractile effects of histamine in porcine and human atrial tissue and in human ventricular tissue. In contrast, the histamine-induced positive inotropic effect in porcine ventricular tissue was antagonized by mepyramine but not by cimetidine. Propranolol failed to block the inotropic effect of histamine in all four tissues. These results indicate that, as with human atrial trabeculae, the positive inotropic effect on porcine atrial trabeculae is mediated by H2 receptors. In contrast to human ventricular trabeculae, however, the positive inotropic effect on porcine ventricular trabeculae appears to be mediated by H1 receptors.", 
    "24": "Stimulation of myocardial alpha 1-adrenoceptors mediates changes in potassium fluxes across the sarcolemma. We studied the effect of alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation (5 x 10(-5) M phenylephrine with addition of 10(-6) M timolol) on potassium efflux by use of 86Rb+ efflux from isolated rat hearts perfused in a nonrecirculation system. The hearts were loaded with 86Rb+, followed by washout during which they were exposed to alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation with or without addition of the Na+/K(+)-ATPase inhibitor ouabain (10(-5) M). 86Rb+ content in perfusate fractions during the washout period and in the hearts at the end of experiments was measured; 86Rb+ efflux rates were determined as the ratio between the radioactivity of the perfusate fractions and the corresponding radioactivity contents of the hearts. alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation evoked a gradual increase in 86Rb+ efflux amounting to 30% of reference value after 20 min. With addition of ouabain, the alpha 1-adrenergic increase in 86Rb+ efflux developed faster and reached a maximum of approximately 40% of basal after approximately 10 min. The effects both with and without addition of ouabain were prevented by the alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocker prazosin (10(-6) M). Results indicate that increased potassium efflux is a part of alpha 1-adrenergic heart effects.", 
    "25": "The major indications for beta receptor blockers include, in addition to arterial hypertension, various clinical manifestations of coronary heart disease. Used as antihypertensive agents, beta receptor blockers bring about regression of myocardial hypertrophy and an improvement in diastolic ventricular function. Anti-anginal effects are utilized in the treatment of symptomatic and asymptomatic myocardial ischemia, as well as for secondary prophylaxis after acute myocardial infarction. A detailed knowledge of the subtypes of adrenoceptors--in particular beta-1 receptors in the case of the heart--led to the development of largely organ-specific antagonists. In contrast to nonspecific beta blockers, beta-1 selective substances, for example, atenolol, have only a mild, clinically non-relevant, effect on glucose and lipid metabolism.",

In vivo, they both dose dependently blocked the flat-body posture and corticosterone secretion provoked by an action of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, S 14671 (1-[2-(2-thenoyl-amino)ethyl]-4-[1-(7- methoxynaphtyl)]piperazine), at postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. Alone, they exerted little effect. The firing rate of dorsal raphe neurones, which bear inhibitory 5-HT1A autoreceptors, was reduced by S 14671 whereas it was not affected by WAY 100,135 and was increased by (-)-tertatolol. Both WAY 100,135 and (-)-tertatolol blocked the ability of S 14671 to inhibit raphe firing.

It can be concluded that a) chronic administration of metipranolol to nine patients in usual doses did not change either Bmax or Kd of BAR in the samples of right ventricle, and b) twelve hours interval between last dose of metipranolol and removal of tissue samples is sufficiently long to enable normalization of possible changes in the sensitivity of BAR. This finding is supported by the pot-operative course and the response to dopamine which did not differ in patients treated and untreated with metipranolol in the preoperative period. Thus, our results suggest that there is no apprehension of chronic application of beta-blockers in patients with tetralogy of Fallot which would negatively influence the response to dopamine during the operation and in the postoperative period.", 
    "37": "The kinetic mechanism for the reduction of acetohexamide catalyzed by carbonyl reductase from rabbit kidney was investigated. The initial velocity and product inhibition studies indicated that the enzymatic reaction follows an ordered Bi Bi mechanism, in which NADPH binds to the enzyme first and NADP leaves last. This kinetic mechanism was confirmed on the basis of the dead-end inhibition by Cibacron Blue and the binding of NADPH and NADP to the free enzyme. However, whether or not coenzyme-induced isomerization is involved in the enzymatic reaction remains to be clarified. In kinetic studies of inhibition of the enzyme by therapeutically active drugs, indomethacin and befunolol were found to be noncompetitive and competitive inhibitors, respectively, with respect to acetohexamide.", 
    "38": "Glucose-induced insulin secretion, 24-h urinary C-peptide (CPR) and euglycemic clamp were examined in five patients with hyperthyroid Graves' disease before and 2 weeks after treatment with arotinolol (20 mg/day, p.o.). Plasma glucose and insulin responses to oral administration of 75 g glucose were not changed by arotinolol treatment. 24-h urinary CPR and basal posthepatic insulin delivery rate (BPIDR) as an indicator of insulin secretion were significantly suppressed by arotinolol. Glucose infusion rate (GIR) as an indicator of insulin sensitivity and glucose clearance rate (GCR) were not influenced by arotinolol therapy. Insulin clearance rate (ICR) was significantly suppressed by arotinolol. These findings suggest that arotinolol inhibits insulin secretion by decreasing ICR but does not attenuate insulin release induced by glucose in hyperthyroid patients, and that insulin sensitivity and GCR are not affected by arotinolol.", 
    "39": "Although atrial stretch is the accepted stimulus for atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), in vivo studies suggest a stretch-independent, neurally induced ANF release mechanism. Thus the hypothesis that cardiac nerves can stimulate ANF secretion was tested in the Langendorff-perfused, paced rat heart. Venom from the scorpion Centruroides sculpturatus was used to activate neuronal sodium channels, veratridine was added to activate sodium channels (predominantly in myocytes), and electrical stimulation was applied to the right atrial appendage. The efficacy of nerve stimulation was verified by measurements of increased neuropeptide Y in the effluent. ANF levels in the effluent increased by 120% over baseline with 0.5 microM scorpion venom and by 88% with 0.5 microM veratridine (P < 0.01). Cardiac mechanics did not explain the large, concentration-dependent ANF response to the scorpion venom, since changes in the left ventricular developed pressure were small, opposite to those induced by veratridine, and unaffected by sympathectomy or adrenergic receptor blockade. Prior chemical sympathectomy and adrenergic receptor blockade almost abolished the ANF response to scorpion venom but hardly affected the ANF response to veratridine. Addition of 1 microM tetrodotoxin abolished all ANF responses. Electrical stimulation of the atrial appendage increased the ANF secretion by 60.2% (P < 0.02), in conjunction with neuropeptide Y, whereas control stimulations were ineffective. These studies unequivocally demonstrate that stimulation of cardiac sympathetic nerves potently stimulates ANF secretion.", 
    "40": "Purified Gs is a substrate for ADP-ribosylation catalyzed by cholera toxin (CTx). In S49 cyc- membranes complemented with in vitro translated Gs alpha, the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol enhanced the ADP-ribosylation rate. This effect was maximal if all guanyl nucleotides were suppressed but was blocked by the beta-adrenergic antagonist alprenolol. Enhancement was partially diminished if addition of GDP followed that of isoproterenol. When added in the absence of agonist, the GTP analogues guanosine 5'-O-(gamma-thiotriphosphate) and guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imido)triphosphate potentiated CTx-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gs alpha consistent with their activating ADP-ribosylation factors. However, this effect was lessened when the same nucleotides were tested in the presence of agonist. Taken altogether, these results indicate that like Gt and Gi, Gs is an optimal substrate for CTx when coupled to an agonist-activated receptor and depleted of nucleotide. Therefore, coupling to the receptor and subsequent departure of the GDP turn out to be the common features underlying the sensitivity of all GTP-binding proteins to CTx-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation.", 
    "41": "Microdialysis was used to characterize the effect of serotonergic input on cholinergic interneurons in the nucleus accumbens (NAC) of freely moving rats. Local infusion of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) or the serotonin reuptake blocker fluoxetine significantly decreased extracellular acetylcholine (ACh) in the NAC. This decrease in ACh was blocked by the 5-HT1 (and beta-adrenergic) antagonist propranolol. To test suggests that 5-HT inhibits ACh interneurons via one of the 5-HT1 receptor types. The 5HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT given systemically again decreased extracellular levels of ACh, and the effect was dose-dependent. The 5-HT1A effect was probably exerted in the NAC, because local infusion of 8-OH-DPAT mimicked systemic injections. These microdialysis results are similar to in vitro studies which suggest an inhibitory impact of 5-HT on ACh release in basal ganglia slices and homogenates. The decrease in extracellular ACh as measured in vivo is apparently mediated, at least in part, through a 5-HT1A receptor in the accumbens. Given the role of the NAC in behavior reinforcement, this 5-HT-ACh interaction may be involved in serotonergic treatment of depression.", 
    "42": "Sotalol is a unique antiarrhythmic drug that combines beta-blocking effects with actions to prolong action potential duration. The net effect is a drug that is efficacious in the management of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Although sotalol has effects on both heart rate and QT interval, these effects do not help predict the antiarrhythmic efficacy of the agent. Changes in QT dispersion may, however, prove to be relevant to both the antiarrhythmic effects and the arrhythmogenic effects of sotalol. Thus, although sotalol may occasionally cause torsades de pointes, this complication may be predictable and clinically controllable. Sotalol is well tolerated, and it may be used, with caution, in some patients with impaired myocardial contractile performance, despite its beta-blocking action. Sotalol has an important indication for the management of ventricular tachyarrhythmias.", 
    "43": "Although synthesized as a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking compound, sotalol has emerged as the prototype of the so-called class III antiarrhythmic compounds. It delays cardiac repolarization by inhibiting the delayed rectifier potassium current, having a lesser effect on the inward rectifying potassium current with little or no effect on the inward calcium or sodium currents. This property of prolonging repolarization with an accompanying increase in the effective refractory period is not due to blockade of the beta-adrenergic receptors. The major electrophysiologic profile of sotalol constitutes the summed effects of beta blockade and prolonged repolarization. Sotalol exerts a potent antifibrillatory action modulated by its antiadrenergic effects. It suppresses premature ventricular contractions and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia while preventing inducible ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation in patients with advanced structural heart disease. The compound is therefore likely to exert a broad spectrum of antiarrhythmic actions in ventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "44": "Antiarrhythmic drugs are frequently administered to patients receiving implanted cardioverter defibrillators. Some of these drugs may decrease the efficacy of defibrillation shocks from the defibrillator. Sotalol, a drug with beta-blocking and class III antiarrhythmic properties, lowers defibrillation energy requirements in experimental animals and may do so in humans. Oral sotalol 171 +/- 58 mg was administered before and after device implantation in 25 patients receiving implanted defibrillators. During sotalol therapy, the lowest energy required for successful defibrillation was 5.9 +/- 3.4 J (range 2-15J). In a concurrent nonrandomized comparison group of 23 patients, including 18 treated with amiodarone, the lowest successful energy was 16 +/- 10 J (p < 0.01). In 5 sotalol patients, ventricular fibrillation (VF) could not be induced at all (1 patient) or more than 2 or 3 times (4 patients) despite repeated 60 Hz stimulation. The induced VF had a pronounced tendency to terminate spontaneously, with the termination occurring at up to 23 seconds after the offset of 60 Hz stimulation. The cycle length of the VF was 236 +/- 34 msec, significantly greater than in patients not given drug therapy (191 +/- 21 msec, p < 0.01). In 10 patients, but none of the controls, intracardiac electrograms during surface electrocardiographic VF were regular, monoform, and without low-amplitude diastolic activity. In addition, monophasic action potentials during apparent VF showed maintenance of distinct and normal morphology. The ventricular effective refractory period increased after sotalol (249.4 +/- 19 to 278.4 +/- 24 msec; p < 0.03) and the maximum heart rate response to exercise was limited to 120 +/- 28 beats/min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "45": "Reduced vagal activity has been demonstrated to be associated with an increased risk of sudden death. Assessing the heart rate variability as a measure of the autonomic control of the heart has been established as a useful tool for the risk stratification of patients after myocardial infarction. In the current study, heart rate variability assessed by time- and frequency-domain measures was determined from Holter recordings before and during treatment with sotalol in 28 patients with chronic ventricular arrhythmias. The heart rate variability at baseline was independent of the presence or absence of spontaneous arrhythmias and of left ventricular function. Therapy with sotalol produced a significant improvement over control values in indices of parasympathetic tone (root mean square of the difference in successive RR intervals, proportion of adjacent RR intervals different by > 50 msec, high-frequency power spectrum). This improvement was not related to drug-induced changes in the mean heart rate or the suppression of ventricular ectopic activity. These effects on heart rate variability may contribute significantly to the overall efficacy profile of sotalol.", 
    "46": "The safety and efficacy of oral sotalol were evaluated in 481 patients with drug-refractory sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT) in an open-label multicenter study. After drug-free baseline evaluations, therapy was initiated at 80 mg every 12 hours, with upward dose titrations of 160 mg/day being allowed at intervals of 72 hours to a maximum dose of 480 mg every 12 hours. Efficacy determinations were made by either programmed electrical stimulation (PES) or Holter monitoring responses. Of the 481 patients enrolled, 473 underwent acute-phase titration. Of the 269 patients assessable by PES, 94 (34.9%) exhibited complete response (suppression of inducible VT), with an additional 67 patients (24.9%) exhibiting partial response. Of the 109 patients assessable by Holter monitoring, 43 (39.4%) exhibited a complete response. There were no significant differences between responders and nonresponders with regard to left ventricular ejection fraction. Although response rates tended to improve as the sotalol dose was increased to 640 mg/day, efficacy was most commonly achieved at a sotalol dose of 320 mg/day. Sotalol was discontinued because of adverse effects in 42 (8.9%) of the acute-phase patients. The most common adverse effect was proarrhythmia, which was observed in 23 patients (4.9%). Proarrhythmia took the form of torsades de pointes in 12 patients and an increase in VT episodes in 11. In 3 acute-phase patients (0.6%), sotalol was discontinued because of the emergence of congestive heart failure. A total of 286 patients entered the long-term phase. Life-table estimates of the proportion of patients who remained free of recurrence of arrhythmia at 12, 18, and 27 months were 0.76, 0.72, and 0.66, respectively. There were no significant differences in time to recurrence of arrhythmia as related to PES response, Holter monitor response, baseline left ventricular ejection fraction, or history of congestive heart failure. Among the 70 patients (24.5%) in whom there was recurrence of arrhythmia, sudden death occurred in 17 and sustained VT in 41. Sotalol was discontinued owing to presumed adverse effects in 21 (7.3%) of the long-term patients, including 8 with proarrhythmia; proarrhythmia consisted of torsades de pointes in 3 patients and increased episodes of VT in 5. These findings suggest that sotalol is an effective drug for the long-term treatment of patients with drug-refractory sustained VT. Proarrhythmia was observed in only 6.4% of the study population and tended to occur during the acute titration phase. The need to discontinue therapy because of congestive heart failure was uncommon.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "47": "Two trial designs have been used in evaluating sotalol in patients with sustained tachyarrhythmias: open-label dose escalation and randomized comparison with reference agents. At least 7 open-label studies (n = 16-65) have been reported from single centers in patients in whom trials of numerous other antiarrhythmic agents were unsuccessful. At the doses used, usually 320-640 mg/day, plasma concentrations were in the range associated with both beta blockade and class III antiarrhythmic activity (2-3 micrograms/mL). These concentrations produced electrophysiologic changes that were consistent across studies: 10-16% increase in right ventricular effective refractory period (ERP), 4-8% increase in corrected QT interval (QTc), and 17-30% increase in sinus cycle length (corresponding to a 15-23% decrease in heart rate). In these open-label trials, sotalol suppressed inducible ventricular tachyarrhythmias in 20-72% of patients; the higher degrees of efficacy were reported when induction protocols were confined to double extrastimuli. Side effects leading to discontinuation of sotalol in patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation include fatigue (4.0%), marked bradycardia (3.0%), torsades de pointes (3.0%), and heart failure or pulmonary edema (1.0%). A multicenter randomized trial compared intravenous sotalol with intravenous procainamide in a double-blind prospective fashion. Sotalol suppressed ventricular tachyarrhythmias inducible with triple extrastimuli in 15 (30%) of 50 patients, whereas procainamide was effective in 10 (20%) of 50. In this and other series, responsiveness to sotalol was prospectively identified by a particularly fast tachycardia at baseline (e.g., cycle length of < 270 msec), but not by the extent of changes in global indices of repolarization (QTc, ERP).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "48": "The safety of sotalol was evaluated in 3,257 patients treated for cardiac arrhythmias in double-blind and open-label clinical trials that support United States registration of the drug. In this composite population, 80% of patients had structural heart disease and 42% had life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, i.e., ventricular tachycardia (VT) or fibrillation (VF). Proarrhythmia was reported in 141 patients (4.3%). Of these, 78 (2.4%) had torsades de pointes and 26 (0.8%) had sustained VT or VF. The overall incidence was higher in patients treated for sustained VT or VF (6.5%). In these patients, serious proarrhythmia was predominantly torsades de pointes (4.1%) and was more prevalent in patients with congestive heart failure and low ejection fraction. Torsades de pointes was observed early in the course of treatment, and its occurrence was related to dose. The overall mortality in patients treated with sotalol was 4.3% (139 patients); in patients with life-threatening arrhythmias, cardiac mortality was 4.8%. In only 27 patients (0.8%) was the death thought to be potentially drug-related. The deaths were not related to dose. Data from a previously reported placebo-controlled postmyocardial infarction trial indicated no significant difference in mortality between sotalol and placebo. Heart failure was reported in 3.3% of patients and was most prevalent in those with a previous history of congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, or structural heart disease. The occurrence of heart failure was unrelated to dose or time on drug; in more than half of the patients, sotalol treatment was continued. On average, there was no decrease in ejection fraction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "49": "We explored the central hemodynamic responses to oral sotalol during dose titration in patients with ventricular arrhythmias who underwent programmed ventricular stimulation. Twelve patients were included in the study, 9 with a history of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias (6 postmyocardial infarction and 3 with cardiomyopathy) and 3 with a history of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia postmyocardial infarction. Left ventricular ejection fractions were < 45% in 10 patients, and < 35% in 5; the mean ejection fraction was 37% (range 20-51%). Sotalol prevented the induction of ventricular tachycardia in each of 3 patients with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and in 6 of 9 with sustained ventricular tachycardia at baseline study. At peak action (2 hours) after sotalol loading (mean dose, 167 mg orally twice daily), the hemodynamic effects included bradycardia, decreased cardiac index, increased left ventricular filling pressure and systemic vascular resistance, and no change in stroke volume or stroke work index. One patient was not continued on sotalol, owing to an excessive increase in the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, despite the lack of symptomatic heart failure. Congestive heart failure in association with marked bradycardia developed in another patient, who had suppression of inducible ventricular tachycardia after sotalol loading; this patient was managed with a reduction in the dose of sotalol and a regimen of digoxin and furosemide, and has been well compensated and without a recurrence of sustained ventricular tachycardia for more than 4 years. Ventricular tachycardia has been controlled with sotalol, without hemodynamic deterioration, in 6 of these patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "50": "Sotalol is a competitive beta adrenoceptor antagonist devoid of membrane-stabilizing activity and intrinsic sympathomimetic activity that has no preferential actions on beta 1 or beta 2 responses. No other tested receptor systems are affected by sotalol. In addition to having class II (beta blockade) effects, sotalol also has class III antiarrhythmic activity. It increases the action potential duration (APD) and prolongs atrial and ventricular repolarization. The effect on APD is independent of beta blockade; the same effect is seen with similar concentrations of the d stereoisomer of sotalol, which does not have beta-blocking activity. Sotalol prolongs the rate-corrected QT interval and ventricular and atrial refractoriness without affecting atrial, His-Purkinje, or ventricular conduction velocity. Atrioventricular nodal conduction is decreased, largely because of beta blockade. Sotalol increases the fibrillation threshold and decreases the defibrillation threshold. Sotalol is an effective antiarrhythmic in various animal models of arrhythmia (e.g., chloroform, hydrocarbon-catecholamine, ouabain, and coronary ligation). In addition, it reduces the severity and frequency of arrhythmias induced by programmed electrical simulation. By comparison, metoprolol is ineffective and d-sotalol is as effective as the racemate in this model, indicating that this effect is independent of beta blockade. Sotalol causes concentration-dependent increases in the contractility of isolated ventricular tissue that is not blocked by previous beta or alpha blockade or catecholamine depletion. The positive inotropic effect may be related to inhibition of time-dependent K+ current responsible for the increase in APD. Like propranolol, sotalol decreases contractile force, heart rate, arterial blood pressure, left ventricular dP/dt, and cardiac output in intact animals due to blockade of circulating catecholamines. Sotalol consistently reduces the heart rate to a greater degree than propranolol and causes significantly less cardiac suppression than propranolol at a given heart rate.", 
    "51": "Sotalol is an antiarrhythmic agent with combined class II and III properties. It is nearly completely absorbed after oral administration and undergoes essentially no first-pass hepatic metabolism. As a result, its absolute bioavailability is 90-100%. Peak plasma concentrations are reached 2-4 hours after an oral dose. Administering sotalol with food reduces its bioavailability by approximately 20%. A 2-compartment model adequately describes the decline of sotalol plasma concentrations after intravenous or oral administration. The drug has an apparent volume of distribution of 1.2-2.4 liters/kg. Results of animal studies indicate that sotalol distributes into a number of tissues, including those of the heart, liver, and kidney, but it is hydrophilic and thus penetrates the central nervous system poorly. Sotalol does not bind to plasma proteins. No significant biotransformation of sotalol takes place in humans. Sotalol is primarily eliminated by renal excretion, with approximately 80-90% of a dose being excreted unchanged in the urine; a small amount is excreted unchanged in the feces. In subjects with normal renal function, total body clearance of sotalol averages 150 mL/min and the terminal elimination half-life is 10-20 hours. Long-term administration of sotalol does not alter its kinetics, and plasma concentrations following single or multiple doses are proportional to the dose. Sotalol is a racemic mixture of the d- and l-stereoisomers. d,l-Sotalol is excreted in the urine equally as d- and l-sotalol, and there is no evidence of racemization. The clearance of sotalol is reduced and its elimination half-life is prolonged in patients with renal insufficiency; as a result, dosage adjustment is necessary.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "52": "Because adenosine has an antiadrenergic action in the heart, young (3-4 mo) and aged (18-20 mo) adult Sprague-Dawley and Fischer 344 rat hearts were perfused to determine whether interstitial adenosine plays a role in the reduced metabolic and mechanical responsiveness of the aged heart to beta-adrenergic stimulation. Interstitial adenosine was approximately twofold greater in aged hearts compared with young adult hearts, and 10(-8) M isoproterenol (ISO) further increased these levels. ISO increased myocardial adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate content, glycogen phosphorylase activity, and cardiac contractility by 83, 150, and 130%, respectively, in young hearts but only increased these variables by 45, 74, and 61%, respectively, in aged hearts. Sulfophenyl-theophylline prevented the reduced ISO-induced responsiveness of the above variables in aged hearts. Exogenously administered adenosine deaminase eliminated the reduced ISO-induced contractile responsiveness in aged hearts. The apparent activities of 5'-nucleotidase and adenosine deaminase were not significantly different in ventricular samples from young and aged hearts. These results suggest that the elevated interstitial level of adenosine exerts a greater antiadrenergic effect in the aged heart, rendering it less responsive to beta-adrenergic stimulation. The increased interstitial level of adenosine in the aged heart does not appear to be due to a difference in the activities of either 5'-nucleotidase or adenosine deaminase.",

The order of potency of antagonists against sumatriptan resembles the order reported for the human saphenous vein 5-HT1D-like receptor. No significant additional antagonism by cyanopindolol (1 microM) or rauwolscine (1 microM) against platelet-induced contractile responses was observed. Ergotamine caused potent contractile responses (pD2: 8.4 +/- 0.3, Emax: 19.4 +/- 2.4 mN). It is concluded that although 5-HT2 receptors predominantly mediate 5-HT-induced contractions, the 5-HT1-like receptor seems to play a role in coronary vasospasm caused by low concentrations of 5-HT.", 
    "75": "Recent studies have suggested that certain organic cations, such as pindolol and the diastereomers, quinine and quinidine, may be stereoselectively secreted by the kidney in humans. The goal of this study was to determine if the enantiomers of pindolol, verapamil, and disopyramide and the diastereomers, quinine and quinidine, interact stereoselectively with the organic cation transporter in the brush border membrane of the opossum kidney cell line. All organic cations tested inhibited the uptake of tetraethylammonium (TEA). The IC50 values (mean +/- SD) were as follows: quinine (17 +/- 2 microM). quinidine (51 +/- 13 microM), S-(-)-pindolol (23 +/- 4 microM), R-(+)-pindolol (30 +/- 4 microM), S-(-)-verapamil (0.4 +/- 0.04 microM), R-(+)-verapamil (7 +/- 2 microM), R-(-)-disopyramide (27 +/- 4 microM), and S-(+)-disopyramide (66 +/- 12 microM). Each individual organic cation pair showed significant stereoselective differences in their IC50 values, with quinine, S-(-)-pindolol, S-(-)-verapamil, and R-(-)-disopyramide being the more potent species. Both enantiomers of pindolol, quinine, and quinidine appear to exhibit simple competitive inhibition of TEA uptake based upon a derived slope similar to 1.0, using a sigmoidal inhibition model. The enantiomers of verapamil and disopyramide exhibited a slope of much less than 1.0, suggesting a more complex interaction of these organic cations with the TEA transporter. Our results suggest that organic cations stereoselectively interact with the organic cation transporter in the brush border membrane of OK cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "76": "Previous studies have shown that the absorption rate of a lipophilic, but not hydrophilic, agent is faster after the night dosage than after the morning dosage in nocturnal rodents. The present study examines whether such a difference in chronopharmacokinetic profiles between lipophilic and hydrophilic agents also exists in humans. Propranolol (20 mg), a lipophilic beta-blocker, or atenolol (50 mg), a hydrophilic beta-blocker, was given orally to 13 hypertensive patients at 9:00 AM (day trial) or 9:00 PM (night trial) by a crossover design. Plasma concentrations of propranolol and its metabolites, 4-hydroxypropranolol and naphthoxylactic acid, and atenolol were determined just before and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours after treatment. Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of propranolol in the day trial were significantly greater than those in the night trial. Time to maximum plasma concentration (tmax) was significantly shorter in the day trial. No significant difference was observed in the elimination half-life between the two trials. There were similar administration time-dependent changes in the Cmax for 4-hydroxypropranolol and naphthoxylactic acid. On the other hand, although the Cmax of atenolol was greater and its tmax was shorter in the day trial, the differences did not reach significance. These results suggest that propranolol, but not atenolol is absorbed more rapidly after the morning dosage than after the night dosage. Based on these findings, the authors speculate that the absorption rate of a lipophilic, but not hydrophilic, agent is faster after the morning dosage than after the night dosage in humans.", 
    "77": "1. Nitrendipine 3 mg kg-1 was administered alone and in combination with atenolol 50 mg mg-1 day for 21 days to male normotensive Wistar rats and to spontaneously hypertensive Japanese Okamoto rats. Blood pressure was monitored daily. 2. Systolic blood pressure was decreased in normotensive Wistars and SHRs by nitrendipine alone and in combination. In both cases the decrease was greater in the hypertensive animal. There was no evidence of the combination having an additive hypotensive effect. 3. Following treatment, the response to exogenous noradrenaline (NA) and periarterial nerve stimulation (PNS) was measured in the in situ blood perfused mesentery. 4. Treatment with nitrendipine and the combination reduced the response to exogenous noradrenaline; with both, the reduction was greater in the hypertensive animal. The combination produced a larger reduction in response than nitrendipine alone. 5. Treatment with nitrendipine alone reduced the response to PNS in both normotensive and hypertensive animals, although this effect was greater in the SHR. 6. Combination treatment failed to change the response to electrical stimulation in the SHR, while in the normotensive rat it resulted in a large increase in response to higher frequency (16 and 35 Hz) stimulation. 7. As nitrendipine given alone reduced the response to PNS, and as we have previously shown a similar effect with atenolol given alone (Draper, Kingsbury, Redfern & Todd, 1992), the effect of the combination of nitrendipine and atenolol on responses to PNS is apparently influenced by some interaction between the two drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "78": "Acute mild exercise accelerates transit of material through the gastrointestinal tract via mechanisms that remain entirely unknown. Because exercise increases peripheral sympathetic drive, and can increase circulating opioids, in this study we examined the role that naloxone and propranolol-dependent pathways play in accelerating orocecal transit in exercise. Transit was determined in 11 subjects by H2 detection after ingestion of 0.36 g/kg lactulose in a 240 kcal, 250 ml liquid meal; the exercise was mild walking at 5.6 km/hr. Under naloxone treatment (0.4 mg intravenous bolus followed by infusion at 40 micrograms/kg/hr) transit acceleration in mild exercise was apparent: transit time (mean +/- SE) was 87 +/- 7 min at rest, 63 +/- 5 min in exercise (p < 0.05), a result identical to that seen in previous studies not involving drugs. In contrast, propranolol treatment (160 mg/day) accelerated the resting transit rate to equal the rate during exercise (65 +/- 6 vs. 60 +/- 4 min; p = NS). Under both conditions, exercise elevated oxygen consumption and heart rate, although propranolol predictably produced relative bradycardia at rest and exercise. These results suggest that mild exercise accelerates upper gut transit via an opiate-independent effect that, for gut propulsive motility, yields results similar to beta-adrenergic blockade.", 
    "79": "Cathodal DC shocks (150-J) were administered via the His bundle to 20 closed-chest dogs, and in a further three dogs 25-J cathodal shocks were given via the left ventricular endocardium. In 18 dogs, including three that underwent left ventricular ablation, Holter electrocardiograms were recorded from 1 to 7 days after ablation, and 4 weeks after ablation. There were frequent episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) from the first few hours after ablation to 4 days after ablation in all dogs, but both the rate and the coupling interval of VT were variable. In five conscious dogs stimulated 1 day after ablation, it was difficult to induce and terminate VT repeatedly. There was a direct relationship between the paced cycle length and the interval of the last paced beat to the initiating VT beat in three out of four dogs. In the fourth dog there was an inverse relationship. There was no transient entrainment with ventricular burst pacing during VT in any of the four dogs tested. The effects of lidocaine (2-3 mg.kg-1), verapamil (0.2-0.4 mg.kg-1), and propranolol (0.2 mg.kg-1) on VT were tested within 2 days of ablation in 10 conscious dogs. In general, both lidocaine and verapamil terminated VT, and propranolol slowed VT. In conclusion, VT soon after ablation possibly results from triggered activity, although abnormal automaticity cannot be ruled out.", 
    "80": "1. The possible involvement of alpha 1-adrenoceptors in the inotropic and electrophysiological responses to endogenous noradrenaline released by tyramine was examined in rabbit papillary muscles. 2. A concentration-dependent positive inotropic effect was produced by tyramine. This effect of tyramine was not observed in muscles from rabbits pretreated with reserpine. 3. The positive inotropic effect of tyramine was greatly inhibited by propranolol, but not altered by prazosin. However, when beta-adrenoceptors were blocked by pretreatment with propranolol, tyramine still produced a positive inotropic effect, an effect which was antagonized by prazosin. 4. Tyramine caused a decrease in action potential duration (APD) and an increase in action potential amplitude in a concentration-dependent manner. Isoprenaline also produced the same electrophysiological effects. These electrophysiological effects of both agents were inhibited by propranolol. 5. When beta-adrenoceptors were blocked by propranolol, the observed prazosin-sensitive positive inotropic effect of tyramine was not accompanied by any change in APD. In contrast, APD was markedly prolonged by alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation with phenylephrine in the presence of propranolol, in association with the positive inotropic effect. 6. It is concluded that in rabbit papillary muscles, endogenous noradrenaline causes a positive inotropic effect predominantly mediated by beta-adrenoceptors, but can still evoke a positive inotropic effect through alpha 1-adrenoceptors when beta-adrenoceptor stimulation is eliminated. This suggests that the alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated positive intropic mechanism(s) may be masked by simultaneous activation of beta-adrenoceptors. In addition, this study indicates that APD prolongation is not involved in the alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated inotropic responses to endogenous noradrenaline.", 
    "81": "Human adipocytes are responsive to both alpha- (antilipolytic) and beta-(lipolytic) actions of catecholamine agonists. These effects are mediated by G proteins which interact with adenylcyclase beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoreceptor (AR) subtypes are identified in human adipose tissue. The existence of a third beta-adrenergic (beta 3) receptor has been recently proposed. The beta 3-AR has been reported to mediate catecholamine-induced cAMP accumulation and to be more responsive in this regard than either the beta 1- or the beta 2-AR. To examine the possibility that a beta 3-AR plays a significant role in the control of catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis in human adipose tissue, we used a sensitive in vitro measure of lipolysis. Abdominal and gluteal sc adipose tissue samples from 14 adults were incubated with isoproterenol, a nonspecific beta-AR agonist which activates adenylyl cyclase via all three beta-AR subtypes, in the presence of varying concentrations of a beta-AR antagonist, alprenolol, which blocks the beta 1- and beta 2-AR, but not the beta 3-AR. In tissue from both abdominal and gluteal sites, alprenolol (10(-3) M) completely abolished the lipolytic response to isoproterenol (10(-6) M). Alprenolol (10(-3) M) alone reduced basal lipolysis by 10.2 +/- 2.2% (SEM) in abdominal tissue (P < 0.01), and 7.1 +/- 2.7% in gluteal tissue (P < 0.05). In the presence of alprenolol (10(-3) M), isoproterenol (10(-6) M) had no demonstrable lipolytic effect. The probability of incorrect acceptance of the null hypothesis that isoproterenol had no effect on lipolysis in alprenolol-blocked tissue is P beta < 0.05 for both depots. As an additional control, pooled inguinal adipose tissue from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats was incubated with the same concentrations of alprenolol. Rat adipose tissue has been previously shown to express the beta 3-adrenoreceptor and lipolysis was increased in rat adipose tissue in the presence of alprenolol 10(-4) M and 10(-5) M. We conclude that beta 3-ARs, if present in human adipocyte plasma membranes, do not significantly affect rates of lipolysis.", 
    "82": "To clarify changes in beta-adrenergic receptor (BAR) density in spontaneously occurring acute asthma, BAR binding studies were performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes in eight asthmatic and ten normal subjects. Spirometry also was performed. Maximum binding capacity (Bmax) of BAR in acute asthma was significantly lower by 44.2 percent compared with that in stable asthma; FEV1/FVC ratio decreased by 23.9 percent. The Bmax for acute asthma also was significantly lower than that in normal subjects. The Bmax of BAR in all subjects was significantly correlated with FEV1/FVC ratio and percent FEV1. The percentage decrease in the FEV1/FVC ratio and FEV1 from the stable to acute state for each asthmatic subject did not correlate with corresponding percentage decrease in Bmax. These data demonstrate that BAR density of lymphocytes decreases substantially in acute asthma and, simultaneously, suggest that some factors other than the BAR mechanism contribute to the airway obstruction during acute asthma.", 
    "83": "This in vitro study evaluated the extent of the absorption and metabolism of propranolol in human skin from four sources. Between 10.4 +/- 3.1 and 36.6 +/- 2.6% of the applied dose was absorbed; however, only a small portion (between 4.1 +/- 0.9 and 16.1 +/- 1.3%) of the dose permeated through the skin. Naphthoxyacetic acid formed during percutaneous absorption was located in the skin supernate. 4'-Hydroxypropranol was formed during percutaneous absorption and by skin microsomes. In addition, the microsomes biotransformed propranolol to norpropranolol. The retention of some of the absorbed drug and metabolites in the skin could explain the low plasma concentration and irritation observed following topical application of propranolol.", 
    "84": "The aim of this study was to explore the direct action of noradrenaline and dopamine on progesterone and estradiol secretion of human granulosa cells cultured in serum-free medium. Progesterone and estradiol production was measured in the presence and absence of noradrenaline, dopamine or propranolol using radioimmunoassays; statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance and Newman-Keul's multiple range test. Twenty-six women aged 31 +/- 3 years undergoing in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer for infertility treatment at University Women's Hospital, University of T\u00fcbingen, Germany, took part in this study. Noradrenaline significantly inhibited progesterone production by human granulosa cells in a dose-related manner at a concentration of 10(-4)-10(-6) mol/l. Dopamine significantly stimulated estradiol secretion by granulosa cells in an inverse dose-related manner. Both effects were blocked by propranolol. The results suggest that catecholaminergic actions switch over the steroid production of human granulosa cells cultured in serum-free medium from progesterone to estradiol.", 
    "85": "Although calcium antagonists form a mainstay of therapy in patients with angina pectoris, the currently available agents have significant limitations. Nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil are all high-clearance agents with significant hepatic extraction and rapid clearance, leading to limited and short-lived bioavailability necessitating frequent daily administration. In contrast, amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, has a long half-life of 35-50 h (compared with 3 to 4 h elimination half-life of diltiazem, verapamil, and nifedipine). After oral doses, the relative bioavailability of amlodipine is high (64%) and absorption is smooth, with peak plasma levels being achieved 6-12 h postdose. Bioavailability is not affected by the consumption of food. In common with other dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, amlodipine is eliminated mainly by metabolism. None of the metabolites of amlodipine has significant calcium antagonist effects in humans. In contrast to verapamil or diltiazem, amlodipine has no effect on sinus or atrioventricular node and little or no effect on the resting heart rate. Amlodipine does not have any appreciable negative inotropic effect with the relevant clinical dose. Other clinical studies have shown amlodipine to be effective when used once-daily in chronic stable angina and vasospastic angina. Comparative studies indicate that the antianginal efficacy of amlodipine is comparable to the beta blocker nadolol and the benzothiazepine calcium antagonist diltiazem. Amlodipine has also been found to provide improved antianginal effects when combined to treatment with beta blockers and/or long-acting nitrates. Treatment with amlodipine either as monotherapy or combined with other antianginal therapy for up to 26 weeks shows that efficacy is maintained, with no evidence of tolerance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "86": "The ryanodine (R)-induced loss of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ and the abilities of the SR to accumulate Ca2+ and participate in contractile activation after R were studied in rat ventricular myocytes. Indo 1 fluorescence (IF) indexed cytosolic Ca2+, and caffeine assayed SR Ca2+. Before R, there was a negative staircase, and the SR accumulated Ca2+ at rest. During stimulation (0.5 Hz), R decreased IF and contraction, converting the negative staircase to positive. When R was pulsed onto resting cells, IF increased and cells shortened, subsequently behaving as if stimulated in R. After R, there was no caffeine-releasable Ca2+ at rest, and little accumulated during 0.5-Hz stimulation. At high rates, caffeine-releasable Ca2+ and diastolic IF increased. In isoproterenol and R, IF transients and contractions recovered at 0.5 Hz with a marked positive staircase and little diastolic IF increase. Within 10 beats, SR Ca2+ accumulated to pre-R levels. R eliminated the positive inotropic effect of paired-pulse stimulation, but isoproterenol temporarily restored it. Twitch contractions in thapsigargin, an SR Ca2+ pump blocker, and isoproterenol were slow compared with control or R + isoproterenol. R leaks SR Ca2+ into the cytosol. SR Ca2+ can be repleted in R by high-rate stimulation or by low-rate stimulation with a beta-adrenergic agonist. SR Ca2+ release in R can be temporarily restored if Ca2+ influx and SR Ca2+ pumping are increased enough to overcome the SR Ca2+ leak.", 
    "87": "To assess the relationship between aging and autonomic regulation of sinus node function, 56 subjects of various ages (range 14-75 years, mean 43 +/- 19 years) without sinus node disease were studied. Heart rate, corrected sinus node recovery time and sinoatrial conduction time were measured before (basic) and after (intrinsic) pharmacologic autonomic blockade (propranolol + atropine i.v.). Percent chronotropies of the above parameters were calculated by a modified Jordan's method. Basic heart rate and basic corrected sinus node recovery time did not vary with age (r = -0.15, r = 0.08, respectively), while basic sinoatrial conduction time tended to increase with age (r = 0.32, p < 0.05). Intrinsic heart rate decreased (r = -0.76, p < 0.001), and intrinsic corrected sinus node recovery time and intrinsic sinoatrial conduction time both increased with age (r = 0.55, p < 0.001; r = 0.56, p < 0.001, respectively). The younger the subject, the more negative the percent chronotropies of the above parameters were, and the percent chronotropies correlated positively with age (r = 0.68, p < 0.001; r = 0.52, p < 0.001 and r = 0.34, p < 0.05, respectively). In conclusion, intrinsic sinus node functions deteriorated with age. Furthermore, parasympathetic tone on the sinus node functions decreased with age, which may compensate for age-related deterioration of intrinsic sinus node function.",

However, the observation of transient and severe hyperkalemia occurring within 3 to 5 hours of CyA ingestion in several organ transplant patients led us to postulate that it might also cause a potassium efflux from the intracellular to the extracellular fluid space. We tested this hypothesis by studying 22 nondiabetic, renal transplant patients with stable renal function (serum creatine < 2.25 mg/dL) who were treated with CyA (CyA group; n = 14) or imuran and prednisone (STD group; n = 8).

    "95": "Lactic acidosis decreases left ventricular contractility, but whether bicarbonate increases left ventricular contractility during lactic acidosis in vivo is controversial. Therefore, we measured hemodynamics and left ventricular mechanics before and after bicarbonate administration during L-lactic acid infusion in 15 anesthetized pigs. The pigs were beta-blocked and atrially paced to minimize indirect effects of acidosis on contractility. We measured mean arterial pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, thermodilution cardiac output, left ventricular pressure (Miller catheter), and left ventricular volume (three orthogonal pairs of ultrasonic crystals). Left ventricular contractility was assessed primarily using the slope (Emax) of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship. While PCO2 was kept constant, 0.2 M L-lactic acid was infused, which reduced arterial pH to 7.05 +/- 0.06. Animals were then randomized to receive either 1 M NaHCO3 (n = 8), which increased pH to 7.45 +/- 0.11, or an equivalent amount of 1 M NaCl (n = 7). Bicarbonate decreased mean arterial pressure (105 +/- 20 to 95 +/- 39 mm Hg, p < 0.05) but did not increase cardiac output. These effects were not significantly different from the effects of saline. Bicarbonate did not significantly increase Emax (4.2 +/- 0.8 to 4.9 +/- 0.8 mm Hg/ml) and was indistinguishable from saline (5.0 +/- 0.7 to 5.2 +/- 0.7 mm Hg/ml).

    "101": "The prognostic significance of ST segment depression in patients with their first acute myocardial infarction was investigated in 1444 patients with an acute myocardial infarction, who were randomly assigned to the placebo arm of the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT). Patients were divided retrospectively into three groups based on the presence or absence of > or = 1 mm ST segment depression in two contiguous leads of a 12-lead electrocardiogram obtained during the first few days after admission and at the time of randomization, which occurred at 9.7 +/- 3.3 days after the index myocardial infarction. Group 1 included 392 patients with no ST segment depression, group 2 comprised 713 patients with transient ST segment depression in the first few days after admission or at the time of randomization, and group 3 included 339 patients with persistent ST segment depression in the first few days after admission and at the time of randomization. At a median follow-up of 26 months, the mortality rate was 4.9% in group 1, 7.6% in group 2, and 13.6% in group 3. When Cox regression was used to adjust for baseline differences in other variables, the differences between the three groups continued to be highly significant (p = 0.005; 95% confidence intervals [0.6 and 1.4]).

Stimulation of the cavernous nerve elicited an erectile response measured by intracavernous pressure and separated into latency phase, tumescence (corresponding to corpora cavernosa filling), full erection (ICPE: intravenous pressure during full erection) and detumescence (corpora cavernosa emptying). A close dependence of the corpora cavernosa filling rate, ICPE and corpora cavernosa emptying rate on arterial blood pressure was demonstrated. Ganglionic blockade by mecamylamine decreased ICPE. Chemical sympathectomy by 6-hydroxydopamine improved the entire erectile response. Phentolamine (alpha-adrenoreceptor blocking agent) and propranolol (beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agent) increased the latency phase. Phentolamine increased the corpora cavernosa filling rate and the ICPE, while propranolol decreased them. These results demonstrate that a sympathetic inhibition decreases the erectile response to stimulation and that this inhibition is due not only to norepinephrine, but possibly to a nonadrenergic noncholinergic transmitter, colocalized with norepinephrine.",

When the glucose level is increased, [Ca2+]i first increases and then starts to oscillate with a synchronous pattern through the islet. The synchrony is maintained even during nonrhythmic oscillatory patterns. In the presence of tolbutamide, [Ca2+]i increases in all the islet regions, suggesting that the calcium signal is derived mainly from the beta-cell population. These results demonstrate that the islets behave as a functional syncytium in response to stimulatory glucose levels, canceling out heterogeneities at the single cell level.", 
    "109": "Typical neuroleptics (e.g. haloperidol) can induce catalepsy in rodents. Selective 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) receptor antagonists reduce neuroleptic-induced catalepsy (NIC), suggesting that this subtype of serotonin receptor plays a role in the modulation of nigrostriatal dopaminergic transmission. The present study was designed to evaluate the participation of other 5-HT receptor subtypes in NIC. Adult albino mice (both sexes, 26-35 g) were used. Catalepsy was induced with haloperidol (H; 1.5 mg/kg, ip) and measured at 30-min intervals by means of a bar test. Cyanopindolol (a 5-HT1B receptor antagonist), ICI 169,369 (a 5-HT1C/2 receptor antagonist) and granisetron (a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist) were used. Buspirone, a 5-HT1A partial antagonist, cisapride, a 5-HT3/5-HT4 ligand and clomipramine, a 5-HT neuronal uptake blocker, were also employed. These drugs were injected ip, 20 min before H, with each animal (9-10 per group) used only once. Cyanopindolol (0.3 mg/kg) or ICI 169,369 (5 mg/kg) did not significantly affect NIC (375 +/- 39 and 378 +/- 34 s vs 372 +/- 44 s for controls, at 2 h after H). Buspirone (1 mg/kg) reduced, while pretreatments with either granisetron (0.5 mg/kg), cisapride (5 mg/kg) or clomipramine (5 mg/kg) potentiated the cataleptic effect of H (107 +/- 19, 576 +/- 52, 815 +/- 76 and 800 +/- 97 s vs 374 +/- 40 s in the control group, at 2 h after H).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "110": "The purpose of the present investigations was to examine the neurochemical mechanisms of modulatory effect of pentagastrin (PG) on escape reaction elicited by the threshold electrical stimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) in rabbits. PG administration (35 mcg/kg intraventricularly) was found to transform escape into feeding. This phenomenon was shown to begin at 20 min and to last to 150 min after PG injection. The animals were treated with various antagonists to some classic neurotransmitters of the central nervous system. Kalipsol (0.25, 0.5 mg/kg intravenously) and ketanserin (0.1 mg/kg intravenously) were found to restore feeding into escape. GABA-ergic antagonist baclofen (0.25, 0.5 mg/kg) was demonstrated to shorten to about 30 min the time of feeding after PG administration. Both inderal-beta-adreno-blocker (0.25, 0.5, 1.0 mg/kg) and M-choline antagonist atropine (0.25, 0.5 mg/kg) were found to be ineffective in escape restoration in response to VMH stimulation. The experimental results suggest the important role of N-cholinergic and serotoninergic brain structures in PG transformation of escape elicited from the VMH into feeding.", 
    "111": "In vitro percutaneous absorption of atenolol was done in order to assess its feasibility for transdermal development across mouse and guinea pig skins using Keshary-Chien type of diffusion cell. Values of diffusion rate (J) and permeability coefficient (Kp) across guinea pig skin were lowered as compared to those in mouse skin. When the concentration of drug in donor compartment was increased a decrease in Kp and increase in J value were observed with both the skins. Under the same conditions, values of J and Kp were lowered for dorsal skin compared to abdominal skin both for mouse and guinea pig. The results suggest that atenolol can be pursued further for transdermal system development.", 
    "112": "Postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation is a well documented phenomenon after cataract surgery. Many pharmacological agents have been used to prevent this complication. We conducted a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of topical betaxolol and timolol on postoperative IOP after extracapsular cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation. One hundred and twenty patients were randomly divided into three groups. At the end of the operation, the patients were given one drop of 0.5% betaxolol, 0.5% timolol or placebo solution into the lower cul-de-sac of the operated eye. IOP was measured preoperatively and five and twenty-four h postoperatively. There was a significant rise in IOP in the placebo and betaxolol groups but not in the timolol group five h postoperatively. IOP was significantly higher in all groups twenty-four h after the operation than preoperatively. Betaxolol did not have any significant effect on the postoperative IOP, but timolol was effective in preventing the early IOP rise. The differences in the antagonist effects of these drugs and the possible role of beta 2-receptors in mediating the aqueous humour flow are discussed.", 
    "113": "In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, the possible anti-ischemic effect of metoprolol during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was tested. Electrocardiograms, hemodynamics, and metabolism were studied in 27 patients with a stenosis in the left anterior descending coronary artery. Measurements took place before angioplasty, after each of four 1-minute occlusions and 15 minutes after the last balloon deflation. Patients were randomly given placebo or metoprolol (15 mg as a bolus intravenously, followed by an infusion of 0.04 mg/kg/hr). At the end of the procedure, the rate-pressure product had decreased by 15% (NS) and 23% (p = 0.001) in the placebo and metoprolol groups, respectively, mainly due to similar decreases in heart rate. Metoprolol tended to lower chest pain and reduce precordial ST-segment elevation due to angioplasty, but the effects were not statistically significant. Lactate, hypoxanthine, and urate release immediately after deflation was similar in both groups. Metoprolol reduced arterial plasma hypoxanthine throughout the procedure by about 30% (p < or = 0.02 vs. placebo). Thus, intravenous infusion of metoprolol did not significantly attenuate chest pain and ST-segment elevation, and failed to decrease cardiac lactate and oxypurine release. It did, however, reduce arterial hypoxanthine concentrations during angioplasty, possibly indicating that the beta-blocker inhibits extracardiac ATP catabolism.", 
    "114": "We characterized changes in the vagal chronotropic response during 3-min trains of vagal stimulation at 3, 5, and 8 Hz in anesthetized, chemically sympathectomized (6-hydroxydopamine) newborn canines (< 15 d of age). In response to vagal stimulation, the sinus cycle length gradually increased (within 30 s) to a maximum value that was dependent upon the stimulation frequency (p < 0.001). The chronotropic response then attenuated over the remainder of the vagal train. However, unlike in adult dogs, the degree of attenuation of the vagal chronotropic response (fade) was also highly dependent upon the frequency of vagal stimulation in the range 3-8 Hz (p < 0.002). We then compared the maximum change in sinus cycle length and fade in a group of neonates while stimulating the vagus at 3 Hz before and after the administration of physostigmine (0.2 mg/kg i.v.). Physostigmine resulted in a significant increase not only in the maximum percent change in sinus cycle length but in the magnitude of attenuation of the vagal response as well. Therefore, unlike the adult, in the newborn the magnitude of both the vagal response and fade are dependent upon concentrations of acetylcholine released in response to modest levels of vagal stimulation (< or = 8 Hz). This may be the result of differences between the newborn and the adult in the prestreceptor mechanisms of fade or in the susceptibility of the muscarinic receptor to desensitization by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.", 
    "115": "We used transscleral Neodymium:YAG laser cyclophotocoagulation (TSYLCC) to treat 47 patients (47 eyes) with end-stage, refractory, or absolute glaucoma. The mean pretreatment intraocular pressure (IOP), 40.5 +/- 10.8 mm Hg, decreased a mean of 13 +/- 8 months following treatment to 15.6 +/- 10.6 mm Hg, a statistically significant change (P < .05). Our overall rate of success (final IOP < or = 25 mm Hg, with or without medications) was 79% (37 eyes). Early complications included pain (11 eyes) and inflammation (13 eyes); late complications included hypotony (7 eyes), high IOP (5 eyes), and decreased visual acuity (4 eyes). TSYLCC seems to be a safe, effective, and convenient outpatient procedure.", 
    "116": "Substance P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA), neurokinin B (NKB), [Sar9, Met (O2)11]-SP (SMSP), senktide, [beta Ala8]-NKA(4-10) and neuropeptide gamma (NP gamma) all stimulate secretory responses in rat descending colon mucosa under voltage clamp conditions. Secretory responses (measured as short circuit current under voltage clamp conditions) were transient and those evoked by SP, SMSP, NKA and senktide were significantly reduced by pretreating tissues with the chloride channel blocker, diphenylamine carboxylate (DPC). Concentration-response curves showed varying degrees of sensitivity to tetrodotoxin (TTX). Senktide-induced secretion was virtually abolished by TTX, while NP gamma and [beta Ala8]-NKA(4-10) were not significantly altered. Rightward shifts of concentration-response curves were observed for SMSP, NKA and SP in TTX treated preparations compared with controls. NKA response curves in the presence of TTX were further inhibited by MEN10,207 and CP-96,345. GR71251, GR82334 and CP-96,345 all inhibited SMSP secretory responses with pA2 values of 5.8, 6.5 and 6.9 respectively. In conclusion three types of neurokinin receptor exist in preparations of rat colon mucosa and their relative location within neuronal and epithelial surfaces are discussed.", 
    "117": "The kinetics and mechanism of sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) formation induced by isoprenaline were studied in rat parotid acinar cells. DAG accumulation induced by 100 microM isoprenaline reached its maximum at 1 min, rapidly decreased (about 50%) at 5 min and then remained constant for 30 min. DAG accumulation 1 min after isoprenaline treatment was dose-dependent. Either propranolol or phentolamine inhibited isoprenaline-stimulated DAG accumulation in a dose-dependent manner. Addition of a vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, forskolin, or dibutyryl cyclic AMP had no effect on DAG accumulation. Isoprenaline did not cause the release of [3H]choline or [3H]ethanolamine metabolites into the medium. Based on the kinetics of DAG formation and [32P]phosphoinositide breakdown, we conclude that isoprenaline-induced DAG formation was mainly related to the hydrolysis of [32P]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate ([32P]PIP2). These results suggest that the effect of isoprenaline on DAG formation is mediated by alpha 1-adrenoceptor activation, that it is not related to the increase in cyclic AMP, and that it is closely related to PIP2 hydrolysis.", 
    "118": "Paeoniflorin, a major constituent of peony root, has been demonstrated to attenuate the radial maze performance deficit produced by scopolamine. In the present study, to investigate the possible involvement of beta-adrenergic systems in the paeoniflorin antagonism of the scopolamine deficit, the effects of two beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, propranolol and atenolol, on the paeoniflorin effect were examined in male Wistar rats. Paeoniflorin (1 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly attenuated the scopolamine HBr (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced deficit in the choice accuracy in radial maze performance without changing the running time prolonged by scopolamine. Neither D,L-propranolol HCl, a lipophilic beta-antagonist, at 3 mg/kg, i.p. nor atenolol, a hydrophilic beta 1-antagonist that is known to hardly ever cross the blood-brain barrier, at 1 mg/kg, i.p. impaired maze performance by itself or aggravated the scopolamine-induced deficit in radial maze performance. Both antagonists, however, completely blocked the antagonizing effect of paeoniflorin on the scopolamine deficit. These data suggest that the beta-adrenergic systems, especially peripheral beta 1-adrenergic systems, are involved in the antagonizing effect of paeoniflorin on the scopolamine deficit in radial maze performance in rats.", 
    "119": "This paper reports on a randomized double-blind crossover study to compare the effects of daily treatment with 100 mg conventional metoprolol (M100), 50 or 100 mg slow-release metoprolol CR (CR50, CR100) and placebo on the response to treadmill walking exercise in 12 healthy volunteers. Twenty minutes of exercise was undertaken at 1.5 h post-dose (Ex1) and again at 4 h (Ex2). During Ex1 all metoprolol preparations caused a reduction in the exercise-induced increase in heart rate when compared to placebo (P < 0.001). The exercise-induced increase in plasma glycerol, an indicator of lipolysis, was diminished by all metoprolol preparations but to a greater extent by M100 (P < 0.05). Rises in plasma ammonia were used to assess the net degradation of energy-rich adenine nucleotides by skeletal muscle during exercise. When compared to placebo, a significant elevation in plasma ammonia was seen only during exercise with M100 (P < 0.05). The perceived exertion at the end of exercise was also greatest on conventional metoprolol. The differences between the effects of conventional and CR formulations of metoprolol were less when exercise was repeated 4 h post dosing. We conclude that metoprolol CR may offer advantages over the conventional preparation, in subjects regularly engaging in exercise, by reducing the metabolic stress imposed upon skeletal muscle.", 
    "120": "Nitric oxide released by a calcium dependent constitutive NO synthase in endocardial endothelial cells exerts characteristic effects on myocardial contraction. Interleukin 1 beta (IL-1) induces the expression of a different calcium independent NO synthase in several tissues. Activity of the latter enzyme has recently been identified in cardiac myocytes but its functional effects are unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of IL-1 on contraction of isolated ferret papillary muscle preparations.", 
    "121": "Electrically stimulated preparations were studied in the presence of acebutolol (1 microM), indomethacin (10 microM), and polymyxin (10 micrograms.ml-1). After a 3 h equilibration period, IL-1 (10 ng.ml-1) was added and contractile behaviour monitored over the next 3 h. The following groups were studied: (1) no IL-1; (2) IL-1 alone; (3) IL-1 in the presence of dexamethasone (3 microM); (4) IL-1 in the presence of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA, 50 microM); (5) IL-1 in the presence of L-NMMA (50 microM) and L-arginine (500 microM). Cyclic GMP content was measured by radioimmunoassay in all preparations.", 
    "122": "No significant contractile changes were noted in group 1. In group 2, IL-1 raised myocardial cyclic GMP and induced a progressive abbreviation of isometric twitch, starting 30 min after addition, with a small decrease in peak isometric tension but no change in rate of tension development. These effects were similar to those previously documented for endocardial endothelial NO but were not inhibited by endocardial endothelial denudation. IL-1 effects were inhibited in groups 3 and 4, and partially restored in group 5.", 
    "123": "IL-1 activates a dexamethasone sensitive myocardial L-arginine-NO pathway which raises myocardial cyclic GMP and induces marked twitch abbreviation. These effects could potentially lead to cardiac depression by limiting systolic ejection, and may be relevant in conditions where IL-1 levels are increased.", 
    "124": "The 0-8 h urinary distributions of the metabolic ratios of debrisoquine (10 mg) and metoprolol (100 mg) were measured in 102 healthy, unrelated, black Zambian medical students. There was a statistically significant correlation (rs = 0.60, p < 0.001; n = 88) between the debrisoquine/4-hydroxydebrisoquine (D/HD) and metoprolol/alpha-hydroxymetoprolol (M/HM) ratios. Bimodality in the distribution of the log10D/HD ratio was not evident from visual inspection and following kernel density analysis of the data, although two subjects (ratios 20, 22) would be classified as phenotypic poor metabolizers (PMs) based on the antimode used for Caucasian populations. The distribution of the log10M/HM ratio was skewed and on the basis of kernel density analysis, bimodal. It was clear from visual inspection of the data that the very high M/HM value (> or = 302) of one individual had a profound influence on the population M/HM ratio distribution. No HM was detected in the urine of this subject but he was not one of the two PMs of debrisoquine (D/HD ratio 1.54). H117/04, the major metabolite of metoprolol was also not detected in this sample. Since H117/04 was shown to be present in all samples from previous population studies, the possibility that this subject did not comply with the protocol could not be excluded. All other subjects had M/HM ratios < or = 12.5. These findings suggest that there is a dissociation in the control of debrisoquine and metoprolol oxidation in Zambians as has been observed previously in Nigerians. Furthermore, clear evidence that the metabolism of these drugs exhibits genetic polymorphism in Zambians was not obtained.", 
    "125": "The question as to whether or not topical medication with beta blockers causes a decrease in tear production remains unanswered. Earlier studies using filter-paper strip tests have yielded contradictory results. In the present study, computerized objective fluorophotometry was used to assess the effect of topical medication with 0.5% timolol (b.i.d.; OU) on tear volume and tear production in 24 consecutive patients with bilateral primary open-angle glaucoma. Tear-film fluorophotometry was performed before treatment as well as at 7 days, 14 days, and 4-7 months after the onset of treatment. The results showed that by 7 days after the initiation of timolol treatment, both tear volume (-29%, P < 0.01) and tear secretion (-36%, P < 0.01) had decreased significantly. However, at both 14 days and 4-7 months after the onset of treatment, none of the values differed significantly from those obtained before treatment. Thus, topical antiglaucomatous treatment with 0.5% timolol eye drops leads to a transient decrease in tear production. This effect, however, lasts no longer than 14 days after the beginning of treatment.", 
    "126": "In the past decade several randomized trials have shown a beneficial effect of propranolol in cirrhotic patients. The effect of propranolol has been attributed to a reduction in portal vein pressure. So far the monitoring of portal vein hemodynamics following propranolol administration has been achieved mainly by hepatic vein catheterization. We studied the effect of propranolol on portal vein hemodynamics noninvasively in five healthy volunteers using duplex sonography and indocyanine green clearance. Measured by duplex sonography, blood flow was reduced by 28.6% in the portal vein (P < 0.05) and by 8.7% in the hepatic artery (NS) 60 min after oral administration of 80 mg propranolol. During this time total hepatic blood flow, measured by indocyanine green clearance, was reduced by 19.5% (P < 0.05). We conclude that both methods are useful for the study of portal vein hemodynamics during propranolol therapy, duplex sonography being more easily practicable.", 
    "127": "In 10 subjects, laser Doppler flowmetry was used to study whether cholinergic or beta-adrenergic pathways are involved in the control of tooth pulp blood flow (PBF) in response to isometric hand grip and the cold pressor test. We also examined if differences exist between the regulation of blood flow in the tooth pulp and the nearby gingiva (GBF). Isometric hand grip (35% of maximum force, 2 min) and the subsequent ischaemia (2 min) induced a brief rise in PBF and a more long-lasting rise in GBF. Atropine increased heart rate about by 40% and changed the pulpal response to a fall in flow, without altering gingival flow. Propranolol, causing a 20% reduction in heart rate, had no effect on either flow during the actual test, but induced a rise in GBF after the ischaemic period. The cold pressor test (2 min at 0.5 degrees C) resulted in a reduction in PBF and GBF, unaffected by the blocking drugs. With atropine, however, PBF increased immediately after this test. The relative changes in arterial pressure and heart rate were unaffected by the drugs. Our study has demonstrated the existence of cholinergic nervous vasodilation in vessels serving the tooth pulp. Non-adrenergic non-cholinergic mechanisms probably contribute to the evoked rise in GBF during exercise. Beta-adrenoceptors are involved in the control of GBF immediately after isometric exercise. While the two tests under control conditions evoked mostly parallel changes in PBF and GBF, the use of blocking agents showed that blood flow is controlled by different mechanisms in the two adjacent vascular beds.", 
    "128": "The acute effects of thiopentone on plasma glucose concentration and regulation in humans have not been well described. We therefore examined the effect of a single dose (6 mg/kg) of thiopentone on plasma glucose, insulin, glucagon, adrenaline and noradrenaline in 16 healthy women undergoing elective abdominal surgery. To assess involvement of the neuroendocrine system in the response to thiopentone, half of the patients received labetalol prior to induction of anaesthesia. Thiopentone injection resulted in a 50% increase in plasma glucose levels (P < 0.001) in both labetalol-treated and non-treated patients 90 s following its administration. This was associated neither with significant increases in plasma glucagon, adrenaline and noradrenaline nor with a decline in plasma insulin. We conclude that acute hyperglycaemia following thiopentone is most likely the consequence of a non-adrenergically-mediated increase in hepatic glucose release.", 
    "129": "In the adult, glucocorticoids have been shown to upregulate beta-adrenergic control of adenylate cyclase by a variety of mechanisms; glucocorticoids are also thought to play a role in development of cardiac adrenergic function. In the current study, pregnant rats were given 0.2 mg/kg of dexamethasone on gestational days 17, 18, and 19 and the effects on the development of cardiac beta-receptors and their linkage to the stimulatory G-protein, Gs, were examined at 4 days postpartum. beta-Receptor numbers and affinity were unaffected by dexamethasone exposure, nor was there any change in the ability of the GTP analog, Gpp(NH)p, to shift the affinity state of the receptor. Addition of Gpp(NH)p to cardiac membranes enhanced basal and isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, but the total response to isoproterenol, with or without Gpp(NH)p, represented a very small fraction of total enzymatic activity. Quantitative analysis of Gs indicated no changes attributable to dexamethasone treatment. Although prenatal dexamethasone has been shown to increase adenylate cyclase reactivity to beta-adrenergic input, the effect appears to be at the level of the catalytic subunit of adenylate cyclase, rather than at receptor or G-protein stages.", 
    "130": "Placebo has only a slight effect on ambulatory blood pressure (ABP). Some authors have suggested that the use of a placebo is not necessary in a study on the drugs effect on ABP. We demonstrate that even if placebo effect is small, the use of a placebo group is still necessary. Effects of one daily dose of 50 mg atenolol + 20 mg slow-released nifedipine (AN) were investigated. Patients with office DBP 90-110 mmHg received, in a double-blind protocol, either AN (group AN, n = 31) or a placebo (group P, n = 26). Ambulatory BP (ABP) and HR were measured (Spacelabs or Diasys systems) for 24 h before and one month after treatment. The 2 groups were comparable before treatment. After 1 month under treatment, ABP was significantly lower in the AN group, compared to the P group, and this over the whole day (p = 0.03 to p < 0.0001). The effect was the most important between 10-17 h (p < 0.0001). HR was significantly lower in the AN group during daytime (6-22 h), but not during the night (22-6 h). Over the whole group, placebo effect was not significant. However, ABP did decrease under placebo in subjects with high initial pressure. As a result, an analysis without data from the placebo group led to an overestimation of the effects of the drug."
