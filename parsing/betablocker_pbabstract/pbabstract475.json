This article investigates the reasons for this decline and concludes that most of the decline in CHD has been the result of life-style changes, particularly reduction in serum cholesterol and cigarette smoking. The CHD Policy Model is used to compare the effect of a targeted versus a population-wide program of cholesterol reduction. On the basis of these projections, population-wide interventions are considered an important part of cholesterol reduction programs. The article also assesses the cost-effectiveness of selected cardiac interventions, for example, screening exercise tolerance tests, coronary care units, thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction, and beta-blockers in patients after myocardial infarction. Cost-effectiveness analysis is seen to be crucial as medical costs escalate and the population at risk from CHD increases.", 
    "1": "To study the physiologic role of human myocardial beta-2 adrenoceptors, the beta adrenoceptor subtype(s) involved in the effects of catecholamines in vitro on the force of contraction and in vivo on heart rate were characterized. In vitro on both isolated electrically driven right and left atrial and left papillary muscle preparations, isoprenaline and adrenaline caused positive inotropic effects via beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptor stimulation. In the atria both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptor stimulation increased contractile force to a maximum; in left papillary muscle, however, only beta-1 adrenoceptor stimulation maximally increased contractile force, whereas beta-2 adrenoceptor stimulation caused only submaximal increases. Noradrenaline, on the other hand, caused a positive inotropic effect nearly exclusively via atrial and ventricular beta-1 adrenoceptor stimulation. In vivo in 10 healthy volunteers isoprenaline-induced tachycardia was antagonized with equal potency by the beta-2 adrenoceptor-selective antagonist ICI 118,551 and the beta-1 adrenoceptor-selective antagonist bisoprolol indicating that it is mediated by cardiac beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptor stimulation to about the same degree. In contrast, exercise-induced tachycardia (that is mediated mainly by noradrenaline released from the neurons) was antagonized only by bisoprolol but not by ICI 118,551. It is concluded that in humans under normal physiologic conditions contractility and/or heart rate is regulated only by cardiac beta-1 adrenoceptors. In situations of stress, however, when large amounts of adrenaline are released from the adrenal medulla, stimulation of cardiac beta-2 adrenoceptors could contribute to additional increases in contractility, heart rate, or both.", 
    "2": "To explore the involvement of 5-hydroxytryptamine-1A (5-HT1A) receptors in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation, various doses of ipsapirone (IPS), a centrally acting pyrimidinylpiperazine with considerable affinity and selectivity for 5-HT1A recognition sites, were administered to normal subjects. IPS dose-dependently increased plasma ACTH concentrations from -78 +/- 63 to 614 +/- 250 pmol.min/L (P less than 0.01) and plasma cortisol concentrations from -10.8 +/- 2.9 x 10(3) to 21.3 +/- 8.2 x 10(3) nmol.min/L (P less than 0.01) at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg in six men. The nonselective 5-HT receptor antagonist metergoline which acts at both 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptors partially blocked the HPA response to IPS in six women and three men. The mean maximal integrated ACTH response decreased from 746 +/- 297 to 40 +/- 146 pmol/min.L (P less than 0.05), and the increase in cortisol was attenuated from 22.9 +/- 9.9 x 10(3) to 11.9 +/- 6.3 x 10(3) nmol.min/L (P less than 0.05). The nonselective beta-adrenergic and selective 5-HT1A/1B receptor antagonist (+/-)pindolol was without effect on basal HPA activity, but completely antagonized the IPS-induced plasma ACTH and cortisol responses. The mean maximal integrated ACTH response decreased to 8.0 +/- 78 pmol.min/L (P less than 0.05), and the cortisol response was reduced to -2.3 +/- 6.5 x 10(3) nmol.min/L (P less than 0.05). The selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist betaxolol did not significantly alter the IPS-induced HPA response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "3": "We measured articular blood flow by standard microsphere techniques in normal adult dogs at rest and during treadmill exercise. All animals but one underwent beta-adrenergic blockade as part of another experimental protocol. Expressed in microliter/min/g +/- SEM, baseline flow values to articular tissues were: knee synovium 26 +/- 4, femoral condyle 130 +/- 21, tibial plateau 182 +/- 29, articular fat pad 9 +/- 2, knee ligaments 17 +/- 3, menisci 34 +/- 6, wrist synovium 19 +/- 4, distal radius 65 +/- 13, and lunate bone 59 +/- 13. Blood flow increased with exercise in all soft tissues of both the knee (stifle joint) and the wrist (radiocarpal joint). Geometric mean exercise/rest flow ratios ranged from a low of 1.44 (p less than 0.05) in the menisci of the knee to a high of 7.25 (p less than 0.001) in the synovium of the wrist. In contrast, blood flow did not rise in juxtaarticular bones and fell significantly in femoral condyles (mean flow ration 0.71, p less than 0.005). These findings indicate that articular soft tissues derive increased perfusion from the redistribution of blood flow that accompanies short-term exercise. In contrast, flow to juxtaarticular bone does not increase under these conditions.", 
    "4": "The somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptor regulating 5-HT neuronal activity is currently poorly defined pharmacologically because there are no specific antagonists, but also because potent and stereoselective agonists are scarce. Moreover, there have been few, if any, attempts to specifically investigate structure-activity relationships for agonists acting at this site. Employing brain microdialysis techniques, we have examined the effects of the enantiomers of cis-8-hydroxy-1-methyl-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (ALK-3; 0.01-0.3 mg/kg s.c.), its trans-1-methyl analogue (ALK-4; 0.3 mg/kg s.c.) and the pure enantiomers of the parent compound--8-OH-DPAT (0.3 mg/kg s.c.)--in an attempt to address stereochemical agonist structure-activity requirements of 5-HT release-controlling 5-HT1A autoreceptors in brain. The cis-1-methylated 8-OH-DPAT analogue (+)ALK-3 was comparable to the parent compound in reducing the 5-HT output from rat ventral hippocampus. In comparison, both (-)ALK-3 and the racemic trans-diastereomer to ALK-3, ALK-4, were inactive, while the two stereoisomers of 8-OH-DPAT strongly reduced 5-HT release. Pretreatment with (-)pindolol (8 mg/kg s.c.), which has high affinity for 5-HT1A radioligand binding sites, blocked the reduction of hippocampal 5-HT release induced by a submaximally effective dose of (+)ALK-3. The direct intrahippocampal administration of (+)ALK-3 (10 microM) via the perfusion medium did not affect 5-HT output. In summary, the data indicate that (+)ALK-3, like 8-OH-DPAT, is a very potent 5-HT receptor agonist which inhibits terminal 5-HT release in rat hippocampus, probably via activation of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "5": "This study addresses the question of whether tocopherol mobilization during exercise could be explained by a lipolysis effect. Nine healthy male subjects were submitted to dynamic exercise of graded intensity (45, 60, 75% VO2max) on a cycle ergometer after ingestion of either a placebo or 40 mg propranolol as beta-blocker. Plasma tocopherol concentration increased toward a peak value reached during or at the end of exercise. The magnitude of this increase did not differ in the two experimental conditions while plasma free fatty acids concentration was lowered under beta-adrenergic blockade by propranolol. From these results, we conclude that tocopherol mobilization during dynamic exercise does not depend on lipolysis.", 
    "6": "1. In the present study we have examined whether neuropeptide Y (NPY) interferes with non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic nerve-mediated contractions and relaxations in the guinea-pig airways. In these experiments we have used ring preparations of bronchi and trachea, incubated in the presence of atropine, propranolol and indomethacin (each 1 microM). 2. The contractile response to electrical stimulation of non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic nerve fibres was suppressed by NPY and NPY 13-36 in a concentration-dependent manner, these agents having similar inhibitory potencies. NPY caused a more complete inhibition than the C terminal fragment. 3. NPY affected neither the basal tension nor the substance P-evoked contraction in the bronchi and trachea and did not interfere with nerve-mediated, non-adrenergic relaxation in the trachea. 4. On the basis of these results, it is suggested that NPY may act on the terminals of sensory neurones in the airways to prevent antidromic, excitatory neurotransmission by inhibiting transmitter release.", 
    "7": "beta-Adrenoceptor binding of cardioselective drugs to intact ventricular myocytes was performed using [3H]CGP-12177, a hydrophilic non-beta 1/beta 2-selective antagonist radioligand. The beta-adrenoceptor density on the intact cardiomyocytes was about 2 x 10(5) molecules/cell. The beta 1-selective antagonists H-I 42 BS and HX-CH 44 BS competed for [3H]CGP-12177 binding sites on the ventricular myocytes in an essentially monophasic manner with Ki = 72.6 nM and Ki = 76.7 nM, respectively. This is in contrast to the results of binding data from heart membranes, where these beta 1-antagonists bind in a biphasic manner with about 30% of an additional low affinity site, presumably corresponding to the beta 2-adrenoceptor. The beta 1-selective antagonist bisoprolol revealed two binding sites at the heart membranes and at the myocytes as well with Ki(1) = 34.2 and 20.0 nM and Ki(2) = 3,014 and 918 nM, respectively. Our results suggest that viable adult rat ventricular myocytes may contain two beta 1-adrenoceptor binding sites exhibiting different affinities for bisoprolol, whereas beta 2-adrenergic receptors are completely absent.", 
    "8": "In the isolated rat heart, reperfusion-induced arrhythmias were exacerbated by isoproterenol (0.01-1.0 microM). The proarrhythmic action of isoproterenol was primarily the result of a beta 1-receptor-mediated tachycardia rather than via a free radical-mediated process, since it was prevented competitively by the beta 1-receptor antagonist metoprolol, but not by the free radical scavengers mannitol, superoxide dismutase, and catalase. If heart rate was maintained by electrical pacing, the protective action of metoprolol against the isoproterenol-induced arrhythmias was lost. At high concentrations (5 and 50 microM), metoprolol alone produced a bradycardia that was probably not related to beta 1 blockade, and this resulted in some nonspecific antiarrhythmic activity. The data provide evidence that, in this model, heart rate during ischaemia is an important determinant of reperfusion-induced arrhythmias, and that free radical formation from the oxidation of high levels of exogenous isoproterenol present at the time of reperfusion does not contribute in a major way to the detrimental action of isoproterenol.", 
    "9": "To evaluate the effect of propranolol on diastolic time (DT) during uninterrupted upright exercise, 11 men with normal coronary arteries receiving oral propranolol and 10 men with coronary artery disease (CAD) were studied by ear densitography. The DT-heart rate (HR) regression equation during exercise obtained from persons without CAD receiving propranolol was DT = e(6.923-0.014 X HR), which was not statistically different compared to that of normal volunteers with no medication. All 10 men with CAD had ischemic electrocardiographic responses at peak exercise with no medication but had no signs of ischemia during exercise after receiving oral propranolol therapy. Although propranolol caused no significant difference in the DT-HR relation in patients with CAD at 1-min exercise, a significant difference in the DT-HR relation was observed after propranolol therapy at peak exercise. In addition to negative chronotropic action (leftward shift along the DT-HR curve), prevention of disproportionate DT shortening at peak exercise (upward shift of the DT-HR curve) with propranolol through its beneficial action on myocardial ischemia tends to increase myocardial perfusion in patients who, when off propranolol, had ischemic response to exercise.", 
    "10": "Metoprolol is considered to be a class II antiarrhythmic agent that is highly specific for cardiac beta-1 adrenergic receptors, yet long-term administration can produce prolongation of the rate-corrected Q-T interval in humans. Action potentials and sodium (INa), \"L\"-type calcium (ICa) and transient outward (Ito) or inward rectifying potassium (IKl) currents were recorded from isolated cat ventricular myocytes using the whole-cell-patch technique to determine if metoprolol can directly affect cellular electrophysiological activity. External and pipette solutions, holding potentials and voltage-clamp protocols appropriate to isolate and examine INa, IKl, Ito and ICa were used. Metoprolol reversibly decreased both the duration and voltage of the action potential plateau but had no effect on upstroke velocity, the repolarization rate during phase 3 or the resting potential. Confirming previous reports suggesting that metoprolol appears to have little or no local anesthetic activity, INa was not affected by metoprolol at concentrations up to 100 microM during voltage-clamp pulses applied at less than 1 Hz when holding potential was negative to -110 mV. However, when trains of pulses to -10 mV from a holding potential of -110 mV were applied at 1 to 5 Hz, use-dependent inhibition of INa occurred, suggesting that 100 microM metoprolol may interact with inactivated Na channels to inhibit INa. Metoprolol (10 and 100 microM) also caused a concentration-dependent decrease in peak inward IKl elicited in response to hyperpolarizing from -40 mV to potentials negative to the IKl reversal potential. In addition, during strong hyperpolarizations (i.e., less than or equal to -150 mV) an inward (i.e., downward) droop in current was observed during the inactivation phase approximately 20 to 30 msec after pulse onset. Metoprolol (10 microM) also reduced peak Ito and ICa without altering the time courses of inactivation of either current or the level of the steady-state outward current elicited positive to -40 mV; steady-state ICa, on the other hand, was reduced. The sensitivity to block by metoprolol was: IKl greater than ICa greater than or equal to Ito greater than INa.", 
    "11": "As many as 10% of middle-aged men in the United States may have asymptomatic but active coronary artery disease. Additional patients have silent disease after a myocardial infarction or a combination of silent ischemia and angina. Silent and painful episodes have similar hemodynamic and electrical properties, and antianginal medications appear to have global anti-ischemic effects.", 
    "12": "Single calcium-channel currents were recorded from membrane patches of cultured beta-cells dissociated from human islets of Langerhans. In the absence of exogenous glucose, low frequency spontaneous calcium-channel openings of small amplitude (-0.34 +/- 0.02 pA at 0 mV pipet potential) were observed in all membrane patches examined (25 mM Ca2+ in the patch pipet). The frequency of channel openings was rather insensitive to the membrane potential across the patch (range from ca 0 to 60 mV pipet potential; chord conductance 4.9 +/- 0.2 pS). Addition of glucose induced a dose-dependent increase in the frequency of openings of the Ca2(+)-channel (from now on referred to as the CaG-channel). A few minutes after the addition of glucose (greater than or equal to 11 mM), bursts of action potentials were often observed which were elicited only if Ca2+ was present in the solution bathing the beta-cells. Application of glucose in the presence of mannoheptulose (11 mM), a blocker of the hexokinase controlling the first stage of glycolysis, had no effect and the activity of the CaG-channel remained at its resting level. The readily permeant mitochondrial substrate 2-keto-isocaproate (KIC, 10 mM) was as effective as glucose in eliciting action potentials from cells forming part of cell aggregates. The activity of the CaG-channel was significantly increased by KIC (11 mM). Although spike and Ca2(+)-channel activity were markedly stimulated by glucose or KIC in all cells examined, regular bursts of action potentials were seen only if the patch was formed on beta-cells which were part of a cell aggregate. Mannoheptulose (11 mM) prevented the activation of the CaG-channel by glucose (11 mM) but not by KIC (11 mM). Once activated, the CaG-channel remained active even after excision of the patch. We propose that the physiological control of this Ca2(+)-channel is mediated by one or more products of glucose metabolism.", 
    "13": "The authors assessed the oxidative phenotype type debrisochin/spartein in 97 healthy volunteers aged 23 to 56 years (45 men and 52 women). After metoprolol administration which served as a model substance, in doses of 100 mg p. o. at night, the authors collected urine during 8 hours. In the urine specimens they assessed by gas chromatography with detection of the electron capture (fig. 1) the metabolic ratio of metoprolol/alpha-hydroxymetoprolol (M/HM). The distribution of logM/HM on the frequency histogram was bimodal and made it possible to divide the group into extensive and poor metabolizers (fig. 2). The authors detected 6 poor metabolizers which corresponds to the results in the white population. The authors discuss the clinical impact of oxidative polymorphism in the treatment with metoprolol, diltiazem, quinidine and other drugs.", 
    "14": "Two methods, one based on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the other on gas chromatography (GC), were developed for the quantification of the partial adrenergic receptor antagonist cicloprolol. In the GC method, samples are cleaned up by back-extraction, then derivatized with heptafluorobutyric anhydride and separated on a capillary cross-linked methylsilicone column. This GC method is time-consuming but, with electron-capture detection, cicloprolol can be quantified at levels down to 1 ng/ml. The HPLC method, using a reversed ODS stationary phase and fluorimetric detection, is less sensitive (5 ng/ml) but, with a single-step extraction, is faster and simpler. The determination of cicloprolol in human blood samples by the two methods gave comparable results. Routine monitoring of cicloprolol can be done easily with the HPLC method, whereas the time-consuming GC method may be reserved for pharmacokinetic studies where late-sampled tubes, with low concentrations, must be analysed.", 
    "15": "Moricizine is well absorbed after oral administration and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. The drug has a large apparent volume of distribution (approximately 4 liters/kg), exhibits extensive plasma protein binding (approximately 95%) and produces at least 30 metabolites. Indirect evidence indicates that some of those metabolites may be pharmacologically active. The elimination half-life of moricizine is 2 to 6 hours, but its duration of antiarrhythmic action is much longer suggesting active metabolites. Moricizine induces its own metabolism with no change in pharmacologic effect. It also induces the metabolism of theophylline and specific pathways of antipyrine. Cimetidine reduces metabolism of moricizine but does not alter its pharmacologic effects. This observation provides further support for the hypothesis that the metabolites of moricizine contribute to the pharmacologic actions during therapy and indicate that plasma level monitoring is not likely to be of value. There are no known clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions between moricizine and digoxin, warfarin or propranolol. Excessive prolongation of the PR interval has been seen in some patients receiving both digoxin and moricizine, probably due to additive electrophysiologic effects of the 2 drugs.", 
    "16": "Comparative trials of a new drug with standard antiarrhythmic agents are important for establishing relative efficacy and tolerance. For moricizine, such trials have included comparisons with propranolol, disopyramide and quinidine. Furthermore, the Cardiac Arrhythmia Pilot Study compared moricizine in postinfarction patients with encainide and flecainide. These trials show moricizine to be superior in efficacy to a beta blocker (propranolol) and disopyramide and equivalent to quinidine. Although the class IC drugs (encainide and flecainide) showed somewhat greater efficacy in the Cardiac Arrhythmic Pilot Study, they are now known to increase the risk of mortality in postinfarction patients. Moricizine was also shown to be well tolerated in these trials and associated with fewer discontinuations than propranolol, disopyramide and quinidine. Thus, moricizine is a promising new agent when profiled against other drugs frequently used for therapy of chronic ventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "17": "The role of alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta-adrenoceptors in vasoconstrictor responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation was investigated in perfused proximal segments of rat tail artery by using selective blocking drugs. Prazosin (1 nM) markedly reduced the responses but idazoxan (100 nM) did not, and propranolol (1 microM) significantly enhanced them, indicating that the vasoconstriction was due to activation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors and that it was partly counteracted by a vasodilator component due to activation of beta-adrenoceptors. In the presence of propranolol, idazoxan or reduction of the concentration of Ca2+ in the perfusing solution from 2.5 to 0.63 mM significantly reduced responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation, indicating that a component of the vasoconstrictor response was due to activation of alpha 2-adrenoceptors. Forskolin, which increases cyclic AMP levels independently of beta-adrenoceptors, reduced responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation to a greater extent in the presence than in the absence of propranolol and this effect was additive with that of prazosin but not idazoxan. It is concluded that activation of beta-adrenoceptors inhibits the component of responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation due to activation of alpha 2-adrenoceptors because of an inhibitory effect of cyclic AMP on Ca2+ channels linked to alpha 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "18": "Intermittent electrical stimulation of sympathetic nerves entering the interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) in rats increased the rate of glyceride glycerol synthesis in BAT but the fatty acid synthesis did not change. Simultaneous administration of phenoxybenzamine and propranolol paradoxically increased the fatty acid synthesis in response to the nerve stimulation whereas the glyceride glycerol synthesis was inhibited. Propranolol alone was also effective in mimicking the effects of adrenergic blockade, but guanethidine selectively eliminated the lipogenic response to the nerve stimulation. These results indicate that synthesis of glyceride glycerol induced by sympathetic nerve stimulation is largely due to beta-adrenergic action of noradrenaline, whereas synthesis of fatty acids may be mediated by non-adrenergic transmission of the sympathetic nerves.", 
    "19": "Total outflow facility was determined in cynomolgus monkeys by two-level constant pressure perfusion. Topical epinephrine increased facility by 30% to 35% three to four hours after dosing, whether given as a single 600-micrograms dose or as twice daily 600-micrograms doses for three days. A single 5.5-micrograms intracameral dose of epinephrine or norepinephrine increased facility by 65% to 70% three to four hours after dosing. A single 180-micrograms topical dose of timolol or betaxolol had no effect on facility three to four hours later. Timolol pretreatment prevented the facility-increasing effect of both topical epinephrine and intracameral norepinephrine, but betaxolol pretreatment prevented neither. These findings indicate that no cumulative facility-increasing effect of epinephrine, beyond the acute (three hour) facility-increasing effect, develops within three days; there may be a facility-decreasing effect of large topical epinephrine doses on the vascular structures external to the trabecular meshwork; there is no, or only subthreshold, facility-affecting ambient beta-adrenergic tone in the meshwork; and the facility-increasing effect of both epinephrine and norepinephrine is mediated by beta 2-adrenergic receptors in the trabecular endothelium.",

    "27": "Studies in myopathic hamsters have described an increase in calcium antagonist binding sites, which is presumably associated with an increase in the number of calcium channels. Such an abnormality might predispose the heart to further myocardial damage from calcium overload. We tested the hypothesis that calcium antagonist binding sites are increased in human idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy by examining [3H]PN 200-110 and [3H]nitrendipine binding in membranes prepared from nonfailing controls and severely failing ventricles with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Despite the fact that beta receptor density was decreased by 50% in failing hearts (iodocyanopindolol Bmax 84.4 +/- 8.9 fmol/mg protein in nonfailing hearts vs 42.9 +/- 3.2 fmol/mg in failing hearts, P less than 0.01), dihydropyridine calcium antagonist binding sites were not reduced significantly by heart failure. Maximum binding of [3H]PN 200-110 was 92.9 +/- 19.4 fmol/mg protein in membranes derived from failing ventricles, and 93.5 +/- 17.4 fmol/mg in membranes derived from nonfailing ventricles (P = NS); values for [3H]nitrendipine maximum binding were similar to those for [3H]PN 200-110 and also were not reduced significantly in failing ventricles. Additionally, the dissociation constants (KD) for [3H]nitrendipine and [3H]PN 200-110 were not significantly different in failing and nonfailing heart. We conclude that dihydropyridine calcium antagonist binding sites are not altered significantly in the failing human left ventricle with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.", 
    "28": "Brachial artery flow patterns were studied in 10 hyperthyroid and 10 normal subjects. Mean blood velocity and flow were evaluated by pulsed Doppler, and peak systolic acceleration was calculated by computer-assisted digitization of the instantaneous velocity curve. Compared to control subjects, hyperthyroid patients had higher velocity and flow (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.02) and higher peak systolic acceleration (p less than 0.01). In hyperthyroid patients, measurements were repeated after (1) mechanical exclusion of the hand from brachial circulation, (2) short-term beta-blocker treatment and (3) inducement of the euthyroid state. Exclusion of the hand reduced velocity and flow (p less than 0.001) but did not change peak systolic acceleration. Beta blockade induced disparate changes of velocity and flow but reduced peak systolic acceleration (p less than 0.05). In the euthyroid state, decreased blood velocity (p less than 0.01), flow (p less than 0.02) and acceleration (p less than 0.02) were observed. A hyperkinetic arterial circulation consisting of an increase in both velocity and acceleration is thus observable in hyperthyroidism. Hand exclusion showed that velocity seems to be influenced by peripheral factors while beta blockade suggests that acceleration is dependent of beta 1 adrenoceptors. Comparison between euthyroidism and hyperthyroidism indicates that both mean blood velocity and peak systolic acceleration are influenced by thyroid hormones.", 
    "29": "We studied the role of the noradrenergic system in the seizures of epileptic El mice. To this end, the anticonvulsant activity of adrenergic drugs was tested with a scoring method, and the binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol, [3H]prazosin and [3H]yohimbine was evaluated in whole brains and various brain regions from stimulated and unstimulated El mice, and their maternal ddy mice. The seizures of El mice were inhibited by noradrenaline, phenylephrine, oxymetazoline, clonidine and yohimbine in a dose-dependent manner. These preventive effects of alpha-adrenoceptor agonists were antagonized by pretreatment with alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists. The preventive effect of yohimbine was reversed by pretreatment with clonidine or alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, although the latter drug did not affect the anticonvulsant effect of clonidine. The binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol was the same in the three groups of mice. More [3H]prazosin was bound in the cerebellum and striatum, and there were more [3H]yohimbine binding sites in the whole brain, cerebral cortex, hippocampus and brainstem of stimulated and unstimulated El mice than in the same areas of ddy mice. These findings suggest that up-regulated alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors are involved in the inhibition of the seizures of El mice.", 
    "30": "The present study examined the actions of the putative 5-HT1A antagonist BMY 7378 on central pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT1A function in the rat in vivo. Unlike the direct acting 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-pro-pylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), BMY 7378 (0.25-5 mg/kg s.c.) did not induce the full postsynaptically mediated 5-HT behavioural syndrome (forepaw treading, head weaving, flat body posture hindlimb abduction). Indeed, the maximal 5-HT behavioural syndrome scores of BMY 7378 were about 10% of those for 8-OH-DPAT. Following pretreatment, however, BMY 7378 dose dependently (0.25-5 mg/kg s.c.) reduced to undetectable levels forepaw treading and head weaving induced by 8-OH-DPAT (0.75 mg/kg s.c.). BMY 7378 also inhibited stereotypy and locomotor activity induced by 0.5 mg/kg apomorphine although this effect was only statistically significant at the highest dose tested (5 mg/kg). In contrast to its apparent 5-HT1A antagonist properties in the behavioural experiments, BMY 7378 caused a marked and dose-dependent (0.01-1.0 mg/kg s.c.) decrease of 5-HT release in ventral hippocampus of the anaesthetized rat as detected by brain microdialysis. This effect of BMY 7378 had a similar onset and duration of action but with slightly reduced efficacy compared to that previously described for 8-OH-DPAT. As with 8-OH-DPAT, the inhibitory effect of BMY 7378 on 5-HT release was attenuated by pretreatment with the 5-HT1 receptor/beta-adrenoceptor antagonist pindolol (8 mg/kg s.c.) but not its counterpart propranolol (20 mg/kg s.c.). Pretreatment with a combination of the beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonists metoprolol (4 mg/kg s.c.) and ICI 118 551 (4 mg/kg s.c.), respectively, did not alter the 5-HT response to BMY 7378. From these data we conclude that BMY 7378 is a mixed agonist/antagonist at central 5-HT1A receptors.",

Norepinephrine (10(-4) M) caused a 123 +/- 11% increase in the cyclic AMP concentration in the cortical slices, which was greater than the increase (89 +/- 7% increase) caused by isoproterenol (10(-4) M) alone. However, the cyclic AMP response to norepinephrine was completely inhibited by propranolol (10(-4) M), a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. Yohimbine (10(-7)-10(-5) M), an alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, intensified the cyclic AMP response to norepinephrine by 30%, whereas, clonidine, an alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, decreased the response. Treatment with reserpine (3.0 mg/kg) reduced the density of [3H]p-aminoclonidine binding sites (Bmax, 93.8 +/- 18.4 fmol/mg protein) compared to the density in non-treated rats (154.4 +/- 33.5 fmol/mg protein). The potentiating effect of yohimbine and the inhibitory effect of clonidine on the cyclic AMP response to norepinephrine were also reduced. These results suggest that alpha 2-adrenoceptors regulate the accumulation of cyclic AMP in the rat cerebral cortex in an inhibitory fashion. The results also suggest that the accumulation is mediated through beta-adrenoceptors and that this response is intensified by alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation.", 
    "32": "Ligustrazine potently inhibits hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. This effect can be mimicked by the sulphonylurea tolbutamide, a blocker of ATP-sensitive K+ channels. Here we demonstrate that ligustrazine is a specific blocker of ATP-sensitive K+ channels in mouse pancreatic beta cells. This suggests that ligustrazine may act in the pulmonary circulation by blocking ATP-sensitive K+ channels.", 
    "33": "The first attempts at treating heart failure with beta-blockers were made almost 15 years ago. A few studies, some of them controlled and randomized, suggest that beta-blockers may improve the patients' comfort, their physical capabilities, their haemodynamic values or even their life expectancy. However, the results published are conflicting. The mechanism of the beneficial effects of beta of beta-blockers is controverted, the most widely accepted hypotheses being that they protect against the toxic effect of catecholamines, act as antiarrhythmics and prevent the down regulation of beta-adrenoceptors. Numerous questions concerning the exact indications of these drugs, the nature and dosage of the beta-blocker to be used, the possible combinations with other therapies and the responses to be expected remain to be answered. When available, the results of multicentre trials currently in progress will be of assistance to determine the role of beta-blockers in the overall management of heart failure.", 
    "34": "Immunocytochemistry using antisera directed against dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) was used to determine the organization of the noradrenergic (NE) input to the hamster's superior colliculus (SC). Immunocytochemistry for DBH was combined with retrograde transport of fluorogold (FG) to determine the sources of NE input to SC. Microiontophoretic techniques were used together with extracellular single unit recording and receptive field mapping techniques to determine the manner in which NE influenced the responses of individual SC neurons. The hamster's SC contained numerous DBH-positive fibers but no immunopositive cells. These fibers formed a plexus that was most dense in the lower stratum griseum superficiale (SGS). The density of DBH-positive fibers was very low in the stratum opticum (SO) and increased in density in the stratum griseum intermediale (SGI) and the other deep layers. When FG injections into the SC were combined with immunocytochemical detection of DBH, double-labeled cells were observed in the contralateral locus ceruleus. DBH-positive neurons were observed in several other portions of the mesencephalon and pons, but none of these were labelled with FG. The effects of NE iontophoresis were assessed for a total of 135 SC neurons. In 74% (N = 100), NE reduced spontaneous and/or stimulus evoked activity. In 3% (N = 4 cells), NE increased activity, and in 23% (N = 31 cells) it had no effect. These percentages were essentially the same for superficial layer visual cells and somatosensory neurons in the deep laminae. The effect of NE iontophoresis upon signal to noise ratios was assessed for 46 visual and 56 somatosensory neurons. For 54% (N = 25) of the visual cells and 16% (N = 9) of the somatosensory cells, NE iontophoresis decreased signal to noise ratios. For 13% (N = 6) of the visual cells and 21% (N = 12) of the somatosensory cells, NE iontophoresis increased signal to noise ratios. The effects of NE on the responsivity of SC neurons were antagonized by propranolol (86% of the 21 cells tested), sotalol (67% of the six cells tested), and atenolol (effective in the single cell tested). All these agents are beta-adrenergic antagonists. The single alpha-adrenergic antagonist that we evaluated, corynanthine, potentiated the effects of NE on the responsivity of the two SC neurons that we tested.", 
    "35": "The effects of labetalol and carvedilol and local cutaneous microvascular perfusion and calculated local cutaneous microvascular resistance were investigated in anesthetized rats at submaximal doses that produced equivalent reductions in blood pressure and heart rate. Labetalol decreased cutaneous perfusion (-25 +/- 3%) without significantly affecting cutaneous vascular resistance (-6 +/- 3%). In marked contrast, carvedilol dramatically increased cutaneous perfusion (+64 +/- 9%) and significantly reduced cutaneous vascular resistance (-57 +/- 3%). These results suggest that carvedilol and labetalol possess differences in the mechanisms by which they produce vasodilation in vivo.", 
    "36": "We have examined some of the binding characteristics and the autoradiographic distribution of binding sites for Na125I (I-Na) in airway tissue from the guinea-pig, monkey, pig, rat, mouse and from man. Basal I-Na (100 pM) binding levels were extremely low. However, in the presence of ascorbic acid (10 microM) or dithiothreitol (10 microM), I-Na binding was markedly increased in guinea-pig trachea, with lesser increases detected in monkey and rat trachea and in monkey and human bronchus. In guinea-pig trachea, ascorbic acid-induced I-Na binding was not saturable within the concentration range 100-620 pM and could not be reduced by washout. Autoradiography revealed that in central airways, I-Na binding was localized at or near the interface of the airway epithelium and submucosa in small clusters, apparently involving one or two cells per focus. The physiological significance of these binding sites is yet to be established, although they may be involved in intracellular iodine storage.", 
    "37": "Laminae of the rat intestinal submucosa were examined autoradiographically for gamma-[3H]aminobutyric acid ([3H]GABA) high-affinity uptake sites. In the presence of 10(-3) M beta-alanine, to prevent high-affinity uptake and localization of radiolabelled GABA by glia. [3H]GABA was accumulated into elements of Henle's or Schabadasch's plexus, and vascular nerves. Densely labelled fibres in the nerve plexus could be followed through the ganglia and interconnecting fasciculi, and often formed a dense neuropil in the ganglia. Cell soma were never labelled. Densely labelled fibres of the nerve plexus were sometimes found to be contiguous with fibres coursing with the blood vessels. All labelling could be prevented by the neural specific high-affinity uptake blocker, L-diaminobutyric acid (L-DABA; 10(-3) M).", 
    "38": "Stereoisomers of bioactive products, particularly drugs and pesticides, usually differ greatly in their biological properties. Usually only one of the enantiomers, the eutomer, is largely responsible for the therapeutic action. The distomer, the \"isomeric ballast\", must be considered an impurity which often contributes to, or is even the main cause of, the undesired actions of the racemate. A fundamental requirement is to \"reduce the xenobiotic load\" to the feasible minimum. This implies \"avoiding isomeric ballast\". The implications of the use of racemic products are largely ignored in scientific publications and in the marketing of drugs and pesticides. The problem is illustrated by the results of pharmacological investigations into the racemic drugs labetalol and medroxalol.", 
    "39": "The enantiomers of metoprolol were determined in plasma samples after direct resolution on a silica bonded alpha 1-acid glycoprotein column. Metoprolol was extracted from plasma into a diethyl ether-dichloromethane mixture and after back extraction to dilute phosphoric acid and adjustment of pH the sample was injected on a Chiral-AGP column for separation of R- and S-metoprolol. It was possible to measure down to 2 nmol per litre plasma with a relative standard deviation of less than 15% by use of gradient elution and fluorescence detection. The analytical method was employed to study the pharmacokinetics of the metoprolol enantiomers after administration of the racemate to humans.", 
    "40": "Transplantation should be performed to improve the quality and duration of life in patients with end-stage cardiac disease. Symptoms, left ventricular ejection fraction, previous and present medications, and an exercise tolerance test serve as basic screening information to identify potential transplant candidates. Patients need to have a psychological, financial, and behavioral profile that will allow them to withstand the rigors of the entire transplantation process, and have no other medical problems that would jeopardize their survival following transplant surgery. Maintenance of the patient's status while awaiting a cardiac donor begins with patient education and a search into the causes of underlying ventricular dysfunction. Medications subsequently used include diuretic agents, vasodilators, digitalis, anticoagulants, antiarrhythmics, and possibly beta-blocker therapy. When standard measures fail, potent inotropes and even mechanical assist devices are sometimes necessary. Future donor heart allocations will require more rigid criteria for the selection of cardiac transplant candidates.", 
    "41": "We report on the distress associated with physical symptoms in 761 male hypertensive patients enrolled in a clinical trial of the effects of captopril, methyldopa or propranolol on quality of life. Educational level at entry into the trial showed a negative association with a series of physical symptom distress items among patients not previously treated with antihypertensive medications but no association with symptoms among the previously treated. Over the 24 weeks of therapy captopril as monotherapy was associated with no change from baseline in distress in all symptoms examined. In contrast, distress increased in the methyldopa treated patients for dry mouth and blurred vision. Propranolol treated patients had increased \"trouble getting breath,\" bradycardia, shortness of breath or wheezing, and blurred vision. Between group comparisons revealed significant differences favorably comparing captopril to both methyldopa and propranolol in regard to fatigue, and blurred vision, as well as to methyldopa alone for dry mouth and \"feeling worn out.\" There were significant differences as well between captopril and propranolol with patients on propranolol worsening in bradycardia. Other comparisons of patients on propranolol and methyldopa monotherapy showed propranolol patients worsening in bradycardia and loss of taste, but methyldopa patients reported more dry mouth and feeling worn out than those on propranolol. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide to therapy worsened total physical symptom distress scores for methyldopa and propranolol patients. This study confirms the value of methods which assess the degree of distress associated with symptoms commonly reported by hypertensive patients receiving antihypertensive medications. This approach can be useful in establishing a treatment regimen least likely to cause distress and can be of value in preserving quality of life, preventing noncompliance, and withdrawal from treatment.", 
    "42": "We examined Na efflux, as an indicator of electrolyte (or water) secretion from isolated feline tracheal submucosal glands. After incubation with 22NaCl-containing KRB solution (pH 7.4) at 37 degrees C, the 22Na-loaded glands were transferred to a superfusion apparatus in which perfusate was continuously pumped to the glands at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min and sampled at 18-s intervals for 10-15 min. After 5 min of perfusion, a pharmacological or electrical field stimulation (FS) was given to the isolated glands. The instantaneous rate constant was calculated by measuring the radioactivity (counts/min) of each effluent sample. The mean rate constant of the base-line 22Na efflux was 0.21 min-1, which fell significantly to 0.03 min-1 after treatment with ouabain. Both methacholine and phenylephrine significantly accelerated the 22Na efflux to 3.6-fold and 1.8 times base-line efflux, respectively. FS produced a significant increase in the rate constant, and the increase was abolished by pretreatment with ouabain or tetrodotoxin. Further, atropine or phentolamine significantly suppressed the FS-evoked increase in the rate constant to 76 and 84%, respectively, of the maximal response evoked by FS alone. These results indicate that Na efflux from feline tracheal submucosal glands, which is dependent on ouabain-sensitive Na-K-ATPase activity in the secretory cells, is stimulated by both cholinergic and alpha-adrenergic agonists.", 
    "43": "We assessed the efficacy of long-acting nifedipine as monotherapy in 52 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension in a randomized, controlled crossover study. Good blood pressure control was achieved in 34 of 40 patients (85%) receiving nifedipine (mean daily dose, 52 mg in 2 divided doses) compared with 23 of 40 patients (58%) receiving metoprolol (mean daily dose, 155 mg in 2 divided doses). After treatment for 4 weeks, the mean blood pressures with nifedipine (149.7 +/- 16.6/88.7 +/- 11.1 mm of mercury) and metoprolol administration (163.9 +/- 23.3/94.2 +/- 10.2 mm of mercury) were significantly lower than with placebo (176.7 +/- 17.3/100.9 +/- 7.1 mm of mercury) (P less than .05). The mean systolic pressure during nifedipine treatment was 14.2 mm of mercury lower (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.9 to 24.5 mm of mercury) and mean diastolic pressure 5.5 mm of mercury (95% CI, 0.3 to 10.7 mm of mercury) lower than with metoprolol therapy. Both drugs were reasonably well tolerated, and intolerance requiring withdrawal was encountered in 3 of 45 (7%) patients receiving nifedipine, compared with 1 of 45 (2%) of those taking metoprolol and placebo, respectively. Adverse effects of nifedipine, most of which were transient, included palpitations, headache, facial flushing, and ankle edema. Long-acting nifedipine is a promising agent when given alone for mild to moderate hypertension and can be safely administered in clinical practice.", 
    "44": "In a prospective randomized single-masked study lasting 6 months, 39 eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma showing a long-term drift with 0.5% timolol were put on a \"timolol holiday\" lasting 30 or 60 days. Twenty-three of them were enrolled with dipivefrin 0.1% twice daily during the holiday. When timolol therapy was restored, the dipivefrin-treated group showed a more pronounced decrease of intraocular pressure (IOP) (8.2 +/- 1.5), whereas the IOP decrease in the nondipivefrin-treated group was lower (3.9 +/- 1.2) and of shorter duration (less than 60 days). Among the dipivefrin-treated group, the response to timolol was more prolonged in the eyes treated for 60 days: the IOP of these eyes was less than 23 mmHg throughout the follow-up.", 
    "45": "The effect of propranolol on mortality and reinfarction after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in cigarette smokers and nonsmokers was studied in the Beta Blocker Heart Attack Trial. Cigarette smokers (n = 2,332) were 5 years younger than nonsmokers and had a lower incidence of diabetes mellitus, systemic hypertension, previous AMI and cardiomegaly. Among cigarette smokers, the placebo group had a higher total mortality rate than the propranolol group (11.0 vs 7.4%, p less than 0.0008) and more sudden cardiac deaths (7.1 vs 4.6%, p less than 0.009). In nonsmokers the placebo group had a mortality (7.9 vs 7.1%, p greater than 0.64) similar to the propranolol group. After baseline adjustment, cigarette smokers were estimated to have 1.6 times the risk of dying as compared to nonsmokers (p less than 0.0007). Adjusting for baseline differences, both treatment with propranolol and nonsmoking were predictors of survival. No detectable nonsmoking/propranolol interaction could be identified. In survivors of AMI a beneficial effect of propranolol is observed for cigarette smokers. Nevertheless, cigarette smoking continues to be a risk factor for mortality after AMI even for those receiving propranolol.", 
    "46": "In a 24-week randomized multicentre single-blind study, including mild to moderate hypertensives free from other diseases, the effect on blood lipids of captopril (n = 51) was studied and compared with that of metoprolol (n = 53). In order to keep the diastolic pressure less than 95 mm Hg, bendroflumethiazide was added to the medication for 11 patients in the captopril group and 11 patients in the metoprolol group. Neither captopril nor metoprolol altered total cholesterol significantly. Captopril as monotherapy increased HDL-cholesterol by 6.2% (P less than 0.01) and decreased triglycerides by 10.6% (P less than 0.05). Metoprolol as monotherapy decreased HDL-cholesterol by 5.6% (P less than 0.01) and increased triglycerides by 10.3% (P less than 0.05). When bendroflumethiazide was added the favourable effect of captopril on the blood lipids disappeared while the undesirable effect of metoprolol became more pronounced.", 
    "47": "Recently, it has been suggested that the peripheral vagal nerve might participate in the bronchoconstriction locally in addition to the concept of \"vagal reflex\". We investigated the contribution of the vagal nerve on the modulation of airway responses to histamine (8 micrograms/kg, iv) in anesthetized and mechanically ventilated guinea-pigs. Airway responses were assessed by measurement of pulmonary resistance (RL). To determine whether the vagal nerve mediates excitatory effects by \"vagal reflex\" in guinea-pigs, we investigated the effects of vagotomy or hexamethonium (2 mg/kg, iv). Increase in RL induced by histamine was significantly enhanced after the vagotomy or the treatment of hexamethonium. Histamine-induced bronchoconstriction was also enhanced by the vagotomy in the animals after the administration of propranolol (1 mg/kg, iv). To determine whether the peripheral vagal nerve may play any role in the vagotomized animals, we investigated the effect of atropine (1 mg/kg, iv). Atropine reduced histamine-induced bronchoconstriction significantly in the vagotomized guinea-pigs or in the animals treated with hexamethonium. We conclude that the vagal nerve mainly exerts on inhibitory role through the central nervous system, and that the peripheral vagal nerve distal to ganglion plays an excitatory effects by releasing acetylcholine from the terminals in histamine-induced bronchoconstriction in guinea-pigs.", 
    "48": "The effect of propranolol was assessed against myoclonus induced by picrotoxin (a known GABA antagonist) in a dose of 3 mg/kg and allylglycine (the inhibitor of GABA synthesis and release) in a dose of 150 mg/kg. A dose-dependent (0.5-2 mg/kg) protective effect was found against both models. Pretreatment of rats with a GABA-reducing dose (100 mg/kg, nonmyoclonic) of allylglycine produced no change in the effect of propranolol against picrotoxin-induced myoclonus. Propranolol thus inhibited myoclonic responses when both the receptor activity and the functional pool of GABA were impaired, suggesting that it produces as antimyoclonic action without the involvement of GABA. However, the drug seems to show a synergistic action with GABA-ergic agents, as greater protection was observed in rats treated concurrently with propranolol and amino-oxyacetic acid, an inhibitor of GABA degradation.", 
    "49": "The authors studied the effect of anaprilin monotherapy (dose: 160-200 mg/daily for 10 months) on the level of atherogenic apolipoproteins (apo A, apo B) and fractions of plasma cholesterol in 34 patients with ischemic heart disease, stable exertion angina pectoris (class 2-3). It was established that changes in the plasma lipid and apoprotein spectrum result in an increase of apo B, decrease of apo 1, increase of apo B/apo A1, decrease of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLCS) and a different dynamics of HDLCS/apo A1. The established changes in the lipid metabolism are of atherogenic character.", 
    "50": "Propranolol (1; Obsidan) relaxes in vitro stripes of smooth muscles of non-pregnant rat's uterus in a concentration dependent manner. In contrast, on uterine muscle stripes of pregnant rats 1 causes small contractions. In an combination of 1 and fenoterol (2; Partusisten) (20:1) 1 prevents the relaxing effect of 2, reported to be an inhibitor of uterine muscle activity. This antagonism is most distinct on stripes of pregnant rat's uterus.", 
    "51": "Myometria of pregnant and nonpregnant Myotis lucifugus were studied in vitro by using electrical field stimulation as well as autonomic agonists and antagonists to determine whether functional responses corresponded with structural evidence showing abundant adrenergic and sparse cholinergic innervation, which uniquely does not disappear during pregnancy. Field stimulation (70 V, 0.6 ms, 5.0-s pulse train, 2.5 - 60 Hz) of myometria from nonpregnant (hibernating) bats produced graded responses consisting of an initial alpha-adrenergic contraction and a subsequent beta-adrenergic relaxation phase. Responses were sensitive to both the nerve poison tetrodotoxin and the adrenergic antagonist guanethidine, demonstrating that they resulted from stimulation of intrinsic adrenergic nerves. Field stimulation responses were unaffected by atropine indicating that there was no functional cholinergic innervation, even though carbachol-induced contraction showed that muscarinic receptors were present. In contrast, functional innervation of cervical tissue was cholinergic and nonadrenergic-non-cholinergic, but not adrenergic. At the beginning of active gestation, some myometrial preparations exhibited little of no response to field stimulation. However, as uterine size increased, the biphasic response to field stimulation was enhanced, particularly the inhibitory (beta-adrenergic) phase. Moreover, the contractile phases, though reduced, was not abolished by alpha-adrenergic antagonists. The residual contractile response was also tetrodotoxin-resistant, suggesting that the myometrium was sensitive to direct electrical stimulation. Near the end of pregnancy, myometrial tissue became nonresponsive to both field stimulation and autonomic agonists, suggesting an absence of available receptor sites on muscle cells.", 
    "52": "The effect on intraocular pressure of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 or 4.0% D-timolol and 0.25 or 0.5% L-timolol was determined in healthy volunteers after a single topical application. A dose-response relationship for D-timolol could be established. The effect on a diurnal pressure curve and on aqueous humour production was about twice as large with 0.25% L-timolol as with 4.0% D-timolol.", 
    "53": "Diabetic nephropathy is the dominant cause of hypertension in insulin-dependent diabetics, and long-term rigid antihypertensive treatment inhibits the progression of nephropathy, probably even when there is renal insufficiency. In our clinical study 14 insulin-dependent diabetics with diabetic nephropathy and renal failure (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] 0.39 +/- 0.12 ml/sec) underwent rigid blood pressure treatment. Antihypertensive therapy included furosemide, propranolol, dihydralazine and nifedipine. The whole group showed a lowering in mean blood pressures from 150.1 +/- 2.3/91.3 +/- 1.4 mm Hg to 139.8 +/- 3.1/86.5 +/- 2.0 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). During the observation period the mean decline in glomerular filtration rate decreased from -0.022 +/- 0.003 ml/sec per month to -0.010 +/- 0.007 ml/sec per month. In 10 out of 14 patients with very advanced nephropathy the further decline of GFR halted markedly. Thus, vigorous blood pressure control is able to postpone endstage renal disease even in advanced diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "54": "A novel method to differentiate basic vehicle models for topically applied drugs is proposed. In this method, the rate of drug release as a function of time, obtained by using a flow-through cell, is plotted on both semilogarithmic and logarithmic scales. In the Solution Case, where all of the drug is dissolved in the vehicle, the profiles become linear on the semilogarithmic scale. However, in the Suspension Case, where the initial drug amount per vehicle volume is greater than the solubility of the drug and the vehicle contains finely dispersed drug, the profiles are linear on the logarithmic scale with a slope of -0.5. They abruptly depart from this pattern upon depletion of the suspended phase. The different attributes of the profiles for the drug release rate-time curves in these two cases can be visualized more clearly when vehicle thickness and drug concentration are varied. The theoretical principles are illustrated in profiles for the drug release-rate time plots of therapeutic patches containing the beta blocker timolol. This was formulated at different concentrations in an acryl copolymer with varied thickness. The release profiles were best fitted to the Solution Case treatment of the data.", 
    "55": "Unilateral abnormalities in the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and visual evoked potentials (VEPs) during the visual aura of classic migraine have been reported. On the other hand, there are only few observations suggesting unilateral abnormality of neural function during the headache-free period. An experiment is described in which the symmetries of steady state VEPs (SVEPs) are compared in healthy subjects and classic migraineurs in the headache-free interval. In the patients an increased number of strong short-lasting interhemispheric asymmetries was found. In the serial recordings performed, pathologic recordings were obtained intermittently, usually with complete normalisation in the following session. The incidence of abnormalities was relatively independent of the interval between the recording and attack, except for the next few hours. The findings may be related to instability of occipital cortical function in classic migraine.", 
    "56": "The steady state pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of metoprolol controlled release tablets 100 mg CR/ZOK, was compared with those of metoprolol conventional tablets 100 mg (CT) and atenolol 50 mg (ATL) in ten healthy Oriental men. The study was of double-blind, cross-over placebo controlled design. The three study drugs and placebo were given in a random order once daily for 4 consecutive days with 1-week wash-out between each period. Treadmill exercise tests were performed and blood samples were obtained at fixed intervals after the fourth dose of each treatment. There was less fluctuation in the plasma level-time profile after CR/ZOK than CT and ATL. Plasma concentrations were significantly higher on CR/ZOK than CT at 24 hours after dosing. The relative bioavailability of CR/ZOK to CT was 69.0%. CR/ZOK achieved relatively more uniform beta-blocking effect over the dose interval. Compared to CT and ATL, the peak effect after CR/ZOK was less pronounced and the beta-blockade after 24 hours more effective.", 
    "57": "The plasma concentration-time profile and hemodynamic effects of metoprolol after the administration of metoprolol CR/ZOK, a multiple-unit controlled release formulation and a conventional slow release formulation, metoprolol Durules (Astra, AB H\u00e4ssle, M\u00f6lndal, Sweden) once daily, were investigated in 12 healthy men. Data were collected over one 24-hour dose interval at steady state after 5 days of treatment. The study was randomized, three-way, crossover double-blind comparison of metoprolol CR/ZOK 200 mg, metoprolol Durules 200 mg and placebo. The reduction in exercise heart rate compared with placebo treatment was used as a measure of beta 1-blockade. The metoprolol plasma concentration-time profile during treatment with metoprolol CR/ZOK was smooth and uniform, showing a more constant release profile than that obtained with metoprolol Durules. This was demonstrated by the significantly longer time period during which the plasma concentration exceeded 75% of the maximum concentration (T75), for metoprolol CR/ZOK compared with metoprolol Durules (P less than .01). The Fluctuation Index of plasma metoprolol concentration was significantly smaller for metoprolol CR/ZOK than for metoprolol Durules (P less than .001). The pharmacokinetic differences between the formulations also produced differences in the time profiles of exercise heart rate. The percentage fluctuation in exercise heart rate over the dose interval tended to be smaller for metoprolol CR/ZOK. At the start and the end of the dosing interval, the CR/ZOK formulation was significantly more effective (P less than .01). These results indicate that Metoprolol CR/ZOK has a more sustained time profile of beta 1-blockade at steady state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "58": "In this steady state, cross-over study, the bioavailability and beta 1-blocking effects of metoprolol CR/ZOK 50 mg, conventional metoprolol 50 mg tablets and placebo were evaluated in 12 healthy male subjects (mean age 25 years) after once daily treatment in 5 days. The drugs were administered in a randomized order. The beta 1-blocking effect was defined as percent reduction from baseline in exercise heart rate. The plasma concentration-time profile following metoprolol CR/ZOK 50 mg administration was more even compared to conventional metoprolol tablets, with significantly lower Cmax (mean: 71 vs 221 nmol/L) and significantly higher Cmin (mean: 39 vs 6 nmol/L) for the CR/ZOK formulation. This difference in plasma concentrations was also well reflected by a significantly lower fluctuation index for metoprolol CR/ZOK 50 mg compared with the conventional 50 mg tablet (mean: 69 vs 529%). There was, however, no difference in systemic bioavailability between the two metoprolol formulations (90% confidence limits: 86-106%). The beta 1-blockade was also more even after metoprolol CR/ZOK 50 mg compared to conventional tablets with a significantly lower Emax (mean: 14 vs 19%) and higher Emin (mean: 9 vs 0%) for CR/ZOK. The total effect over a dosage interval, defined as area under the effect curve, was significantly higher for metoprolol CR/ZOK compared to conventional tablets (90% confidence limits: 123-213%). In conclusion, once daily administration of metoprolol CR/ZOK 50 mg to young healthy subjects resulted in smooth plasma concentration and produced a significant beta 1-blocking effect for 24 hours.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "59": "Four studies of identical design, each on 18 young healthy subjects, were undertaken to study the pharmacokinetics and beta 1-receptor blockade at steady state after a once daily dose (od) of 100, 200, 300 and 400 mg of metoprolol CR/ZOK (a new controlled release preparation) in comparison with 100 mg dosages (od, bid, tid and qid, respectively) of conventional metoprolol tablets (CT). All studies were of randomized three-way crossover design with 7-day double-blind treatment periods separated by 7-day single-blind washout periods. A number of predose plasma concentrations and assessments of beta 1-blockade were made during the study and a full pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study was performed on day 7. The maximal plasma concentration, Cmax, was significantly lower after metoprolol CR/ZOK compared to CT after all doses--the most pronounced difference being observed after the 100 mg dose when both preparations were given once daily (145 nmol/L vs 606 nmol/L) and the least difference after the 400 mg dose when metoprolol CT was given every 6 hours (837 nmol/L vs 1111 nmol/L). The maximal plasma concentration occurred later after metoprolol CR/ZOK than CT in all studies (median 2.5-4.1 hours vs 1.0-1.2 hours). The trough plasma concentration, Cmin, was significantly higher after 100 mg metoprolol CR/ZOK compared to CT dosed once daily; CminS were comparable between the two preparations in the 200 mg and 300 mg studies and lower after metoprolol CR/ZOK in the 400 mg study (278 nmol/L vs 469 nmol/L). In all four studies the AUCs were significantly lower after metoprolol CR/ZOK compared to CT with the mean relative bioavailability being approximately similar (73-84%). All metoprolol treatments produced a statistically significant beta 1-blockade (measured as percent reduction of exercise induced tachycardia) throughout the whole day compared to placebo except in the 100 mg study where the effect of once daily CT did not differ from placebo during the last 6 hours. Consequently, a significantly higher beta 1-blockade was observed after metoprolol CR/ZOK compared to CT in this latter period. The maximum beta 1-blockade (Emax) after CR/ZOK 100 mg was significantly lower than after CT 100 mg once daily (12.6% vs 23.3%) but when CT was given in divided doses from 200 to 400 mg daily, Emax did not differ between the two formulations. Once daily administration of 100 mg of both products resulted in a significantly higher beta 1-blockade 24 hours after dosing with CR/ZOK compared to CT, but when CT was taken in divided doses this difference between the treatments was less pronounced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "60": "Recent primary and secondary preventive trials have shown that long-term metoprolol therapy reduces the risk of acute cardiovascular complications. To test whether part of this beneficial long-term effect may be due to effects on the fibrinolytic system, three pilot studies were performed; two in healthy individuals, and one in patients with mild hypertension or uncomplicated atrial fibrillation. The effect of metoprolol CR/ZOK (controlled release) 100-200 mg daily, on plasminogen activator inhibitor activity (PAI-1) in plasma was measured. In addition serum triglycerides and orosomucoid were analyzed. All the individuals were included in double-blind placebo controlled cross-over trials with treatment periods ranging from 4 days to 3 weeks. During metoprolol therapy PAI-1 values were reduced, while orosomucoid and triglyceride levels were unchanged. A linear inverse correlation was found between fibrinolysis and PAI-1 activity in plasma, indicating that PAI-1 activity serves as an indicator of fibrinolysis. PAI-1 activity and triglycerides were significantly correlated during placebo and metoprolol therapy. In conclusion, our results in these pilot studies suggest that metoprolol enhances fibrinolytic activity as seen by reduced PAI-1 activity. These results should be further confirmed and put into relation of clinical effects of the therapy.", 
    "61": "12 healthy women with a mean age of 60 years (range 50-70 years) were treated with 50 mg atenolol or 100 mg metoprolol CR/ZOK or placebo for 1 week in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over study. Laboratory measurements of the cardiovascular responses to exercise were made 2-4 hours after and again 24 hours after the last tablet. Blood pressure and heart rate at rest were reduced equally by the two beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. The reductions in blood pressure and heart rate during graded exercise and then during prolonged steady treadmill exercise 3-4 hours after the tablet were greater for atenolol than metoprolol CR/ZOK. The reductions in cardiac output showed a similar pattern. Lactate concentrations and ratings of perceived exertion tended to be highest on metoprolol CR/ZOK, but these differences were inconsistent. We conclude that despite the changes in the cardiovascular system in these 50-70 year-old women, exercise tolerance was not greatly affected by beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "62": "The steady state pharmacokinetics of propranolol was examined in 48 Saudi Arabian patients chronically treated with oral doses [mean (SEM) = 85.8 (5) mg] of this drug. The mean (SEM) of the steady state concentration (Css) per mg/kg daily dose was 21.8 (3.1) ng.ml-1/mg.kg-1. A 6-fold variability in Css was observed between patients treated with 40 mg every 8 hours and 14-fold between patients treated with 40 mg twice daily. The frequency distribution of the apparent oral clearance (TCLor) of propranolol was bimodal with 88% of the patients showing TCLor of 18 to 372 l.hr-1 while the remainder had TCLor of 471 to 749 l.hr-1. The mean (SEM) of the TCLor per kg body weight for all 48 patients was 3.16 (0.38) l.hr-1.kg-1. Both Css and TCLor obtained for Saudi Arabian patients are not significantly different from those reported for subjects from Western populations. While Css increased proportionally (P less than .001) with dosing, a near-significant (P less than .06), inverse, linear relationship was found between age and TCLor. No significant effect of sex, body weight, or disease state (i.e., heart diseases, hypertension, depression, migraine) on Css or TCLor was detected.", 
    "63": "The extent to which the end-systolic volume (ESV) \"follows\" the end-diastolic volume (EDV) when the latter changes in response to various perturbations is a major determinant of the cardiac ejection fraction (EF) and has not been studied in humans. We measured EDV, ESV, and EF, determined by gated blood pool scans, during a change in posture from the supine to the upright seated position and during graded upright bicycle exercise. The experimental group consisted of 119 healthy individuals (79 males and 40 females) ranging in age from 21 to 81 yr and in physical-conditioning status (75-225 W maximum work load); rigorous screening excluded cardiac disease. Multiple regression analysis showed that the change in ESV (delta ESV) during a postural shift or during graded exercise was highly statistically correlated with the change in EDV (delta EDV) that occurred (r2 ranged from 0.34 to 0.49, correlation is positive) regardless of age, sex, or exercise work load. The correlation of delta ESV with delta EDV observed in this large sample, heterogeneous with respect to age, sex, and physical fitness, was also present in additional 31 subjects who exercised during beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol 0.15 mg/kg). The delta EF with posture change and exercise in all subjects under all conditions was highly and inversely correlated with the delta ESV (r2 ranged from 0.38 to 0.81). Thus the delta ESV during the circulatory adaptive response to orthostatic and exercise stresses in humans is related to the delta EDV, and this relationship modulates the delta EF in response to these stresses.", 
    "64": "Pharmacokinetic parameters of oral labetalol were studied in eight women with pregnancy-induced hypertension in the third trimester of pregnancy. Labetalol exhibited rapid absorption; peak serum concentrations of 881 +/- 219 ng/ml occurred at 20 minutes after labetalol ingestion. The terminal elimination half-life (mean, 1.7 +/- 0.27 hours) was found to be shorter than that reported for normotensive volunteers or nonpregnant hypertensive patients (mean, 6 to 8 hours). A mean apparent oral elimination clearance of 21.8 ml/min/kg compared favorably with that seen in other pregnant and nonpregnant populations. Food delayed the time to peak serum concentration to approximately 60 minutes. Labetalol was detected in fetal cord samples and amniotic fluid samples at concentrations approximately 50% and 16% that of simultaneous maternal vein samples, respectively.", 
    "65": "The effect of chronic beta adrenergic blockade on potassium homeostasis during moderate intensity exercise (40% of VO2 max) was examined in seven end-stage renal patients who were being maintained on chronic dialysis treatment. Subjects participated in three study protocols: 1) exercise alone, 2) exercise plus propranolol (a nonselective beta-1, beta-2 antagonist), and 3) exercise plus metoprolol (a specific beta-1 antagonist). The basal potassium concentration was similar in all three studies and averaged 4.95 +/- 0.12 mEq/liter. During Study 1 (exercise alone), plasma potassium rose by 0.26 +/- 0.09 mEq/liter. During exercise with propranolol, plasma K concentration rose significantly higher (delta plasma K = 0.44 +/- 0.26 mEq/liter; P less than 0.05 vs. exercise alone). In contrast, the rise in plasma K during exercise with metoprolol (delta plasma K = 0.20 +/- 0.08 mEq/liter) was similar to that observed with exercise alone. Differences in potassium homeostasis between metoprolol and propranolol could not be explained by differences in hemodynamic parameters, levels of potassium regulatory hormones, or acid base status. Thus, the higher rise in potassium concentration during exercise with propranolol could only be explained by adrenergic blockade at the beta-2 receptor site. These results support the concept that adrenergic control of extrarenal potassium homeostasis in dialysis patients is mediated at the beta-2 receptor. Since a deterioration in potassium homeostasis during exercise is observed with beta-2, but not beta-1 blockade, selective beta-1 adrenergic blocking agents may be safer in dialysis patients.", 
    "66": "This study investigated whether oral doses of isosorbide-5-mononitrate, a preferential venous dilator that decreases portal pressure, could enhance the effects of propranolol on portal hypertension. Taking part in the study were 28 patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Twenty patients (group 1) had hemodynamic measurements in baseline conditions after beta-blockade by intravenous administration of propranolol and after receiving oral doses of isosorbide-5-mononitrate. The remaining eight patients (group 2) were given oral isosorbide-5-mononitrate while receiving chronic propranolol therapy. In group 1, propranolol significantly reduced portal pressure (estimated as the gradient between wedged and free hepatic venous pressures) from 21.5 +/- 3.9 to 18.6 +/- 4.2 mm Hg (-13.7%, p less than 0.001), azygos blood flow (-38%, p less than 0.001), hepatic blood flow (-12.8%, p less than 0.05), cardiac output (-24.5%, p less than 0.001) and heart rate (-18.4%, p less than 0.001) without significant changes in mean arterial pressure. Addition of oral isosorbide-5-mononitrate caused a further and marked fall in portal pressure (to 15.7 +/- 3.1 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), without additional changes in azygos blood flow but with significant additional reductions in hepatic blood flow (-15.5%, p less than 0.05), cardiac output (-11.5%, p less than 0.001) and mean arterial pressure (-22%, p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "68": "Ten healthy volunteers were treated for 4 days with 160 mg propranolol HCl and placebo in random order. At the end of each treatment salivary antipyrine kinetics and the plasma kinetics and urinary excretion of paracetamol and its major metabolites were measured following a 1500 mg oral dose. Propranolol prolonged the half-life of antipyrine by 11 +/- 5% (mean +/- s.e. mean) and lowered its clearance by 14 +/- 3% (P less than 0.05). Propranolol increased the half-life of paracetamol by 25 +/- 12% (P less than 0.05) and lowered its clearance by 14 +/- 3% (P less than 0.05). Propranolol decreased the partial clearance of paracetamol to its cysteine and mercapturate derivatives by 16 +/- 3% (P less than 0.05) and 32 +/- 7% (P less than 0.05), respectively. The partial clearance to the glucuronide conjugate was decreased by 27 +/- 6% (P less than 0.05), whereas that to sulphate was not changed significantly. Propranolol inhibits paracetamol metabolism predominantly through inhibition of the oxidation and glucuronidation pathways.", 
    "69": "The direct membrane effect of propranolol was studied in vitro on washed platelet preparations. Propranolol has been reported to inhibit platelet aggregation by mechanisms unrelated to its beta-blocking activity. In the present study, the drug was found to enhance 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate binding to platelet membrane by increasing the number of binding sites. Steady-state anisotropy was studied by labeling the platelets with the hydrophobic fluorescent probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene. Propranolol was observed to decrease the equivalent microviscosity of the membrane. When the infinitely slow decaying component of fluorescence anisotropy (r infinity), which is proportional to the square of lipid order parameter, was calculated from the anisotropy data, a decrease in these parameters was also indicated. A higher fusion activation energy for viscosity in the propranolol-treated platelets reflected a lesser degree of order of the hydrocarbon chains in the lipid bilayer.", 
    "70": "Pressor effects of noncardioselective beta-blockers have been demonstrated in situations of increased sympathetic activity; however, data are limited and the clinical significance of this finding is in doubt. The present study was performed to supply data about the effect of noncardioselective beta-blockers on the stress of acute hospitalization. Of 2,989 patients acutely admitted to a 50-bed unit of general internal medicine in a 647-bed teaching hospital, 234 had used beta-blockers without intrinsic sympathicomimetic activity (ISA) for at least six weeks because of mild hypertension; 199 were evaluable, 56 using nonselective, 143 using selective beta-blockers. The authors found a marked pressor effect of noncardioselective beta-blockers as compared with selective (mean arterial pressure 125 versus 102 mm Hg, p less than 0.001). In the patients who could continue their outpatient medication this effect could be attributed to an overall increase of total peripheral resistance and disappeared within five days of admission. In the patients admitted because of unstable angina pectoris (nonselective n = 15, selective n = 48) myocardial oxygen demand as estimated by the double product (systolic blood pressure heart rate) was significantly higher in the nonselective group (12.926 versus 9.581 mmHg.beats/min, p less than 0.01). The present study supports the need for more controlled data to determine the ultimate place of noncardioselective beta-blockers in situations of increased sympathetic activity.", 
    "71": "Studies of the pathobiologic consequences of high blood pressure in childhood, as well as those following blood pressure levels into young adulthood, indicate that early intervention in the natural history of essential hypertension is warranted. In an exploratory study of the concept, 95 children out of 1604 (aged 8 to 18 years), who persistently scored higher than the 90th percentile for blood pressure over a 4-month period, considering the race, sex, and height of the children, were studied. Five series of replicate measurements with 30 total observations were obtained. Children with evidence of secondary hypertension were excluded. The study children were randomly divided into treatment (n = 48) and high-comparison (n = 47) groups. Treatment consisted of low-dose combined drug therapy (propranolol and chlorthalidone) with an educational program directed towards hypertension and dietary and exercise modification. Monthly follow-up was continued for 30 months. Significant systolic (-3.59 mm Hg) and diastolic (-1.73 mm Hg) changes were noted up to 30 months (p less than 0.05) with minimal side effects. Furthermore, analyses suggested that the blood pressure change, at least in the first month, was mostly attributable to drug therapy. Moreover, the mechanism of blood pressure change appeared to be race-specific, with whites having pulse rate changes and blacks having significant weight changes, which were associated with blood pressure change. This trial shows further research is warranted to determine optimum approaches for early treatment of essential hypertension to prevent future hypertensive disease.", 
    "72": "Although the precise cause of essential hypertension is not known, empiric treatment is indicated to reduce cardiovascular risks. Several pharmacologic classes of a antihypertensive drugs are available to reduce blood pressure, but they do so by different hemodynamic mechanisms. The physiologic therapeutic goal in patients with hypertension is to normalize the systemic vascular resistance without inducing major alterations in the cardiac output. In this study we compared the antihypertensive and hemodynamic actions of nicardipine, a calcium antagonist, with propranolol, a beta-blocking drug. Both drugs were effective in the treatment of hypertension. However, while propranolol therapy decreased the resting and exercise left ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac output, cardiac function was well preserved during nicardipine therapy. It is concluded that both nicardipine and propranolol exert similar antihypertensive actions but that they cause dissimilar hemodynamic consequences in patients with uncomplicated hypertension.", 
    "73": "The effects of the slow calcium channel blocker nicardipine on the synchrony of left ventricular filling were examined in eight patients with angina pectoris. Left ventriculography was performed at baseline (after pretreatment with propranolol to minimize reflex changes) and was repeated after the intravenous administration of 2.5 mg nicardipine. Regional peak filling rate and time to peak filling rate were determined in eight ventricular segments before and after nicardipine. At baseline, the time from the R wave to the regional peak filling rate was 380-680 msec, and there were a large number of segments with depressed peak filling rate (p less than 0.001, vs. distribution of regional peak filling rate in normal subjects using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), indicating both asynchrony of filling (p less than 0.001, vs. distribution of time to peak filling rate in normal subjects) and nonhomogeneity of diastolic distensibility. Nicardipine administration significantly reduced the distribution of the time to peak filling rate (p less than 0.001) and increased regional peak filling rate (p less than 0.001) in a large subset of segments. Segments with normal values of peak filling rate at baseline, however, frequently did not improve or even decreased their peak filling rate. The changes in global left ventricular filling rate after drug administration also correlated with the number of segments improved after nicardipine. It is concluded that intravenous nicardipine improves the synchrony of diastolic filling in patients with angina pectoris.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Oxidative metabolism was assessed by a debrisoquine oral test in every patient. Eleven patients with stable ventricular premature beats (VPBs) greater than or equal to 300/hr and Lown class greater than or equal to 3 completed the study. The main results emphasized a certain discrepancy between the clinical effect of the acute intravenous infusion (efficacy in 5 out of 11 patients) and of the acute oral test and chronic therapy (efficacy in 11/11), with a time lag of the ECG changes during the acute intravenous infusion. The minimal effective concentrations were lower after acute oral administration compared with chronic treatment both for propafenone (200 +/- 189 ng/ml vs. 492 +/- 530 ng/ml; p less than 0.05) and for 5-hydroxy-propafenone (82 +/- 40 ng/ml vs. 149 +/- 80 ng/ml; p less than 0.02). A linear correlation was demonstrated between drug/metabolite ratios of propafenone and debrisoquine, either after acute oral (r = 0.91) or after chronic administration (r = 0.84).

    "75": "Twenty-three patients with severe hypertension and impaired renal function were included in an open study of the efficacy and tolerance of felodipine treatment over 6 months. All patients were previously treated with a diuretic, a beta blocker, and a vasodilator, and eight of them also received an ACE inhibitor. At the start of felodipine treatment the previously used vasodilator was withdrawn. In nine patients the concomitant antihypertensive treatment was reduced during the study. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR), as 51Cr EDTA clearance, was determined before and at the end of the study. The blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded at all clinical visits in the morning 12 hours after the evening dose of felodipine and 2 hours after the morning dose. Plasma concentrations of felodipine were measured at every visit before the morning dose and 2 hours after dose. The BP was reduced after felodipine was substituted for the previously used vasodilator. A significant additional anti-hypertensive effect was recorded 2 hours after the dose and amounted to -37 +/- 22/-15 +/- 12 mmHg (p = 0.0001/p = 0.0002) at 6 months. The effect measured 12 hours after the dose was less pronounced and was -11 +/- 28/-6 +/- 10 mmHg (p = 0.15/p = 0.03). Mean GFR was unchanged during the study, 38 +/- 19 versus 38 +/- 19 ml/min (n = 16).

After 4 day therapy with 800 mg of quinidine, 10% potassium chloride and 75 mg of hydroxyzine performed electrocardioversion restored the sinus rhythm 90/min, but unfortunately supraventricular tachycardia returned 4 hours later. Thyroid hormones examination revealed isolated increase of serum T3 level to 3.0 ng/ml (normal value range 0.8-1, 6 ng/ml). Ultrasound examination showed mild parenchymatous goitre. Authors diagnosed a rare type of thyrotoxicosis-triiodothyronine toxicosis+, which was only manifested by long-lasting supraventricular tachycardia without clinical state impairment. Thiamazole-40 mg/day (60 mg from the 28th day of therapy), propranolol-160 mg/day as well as sedatives, 10% KCl and vitamins C and B6 were started to be given.

    "77": "The antihypertensive effects and tolerability of a once-daily, fixed combination of atenolol 50 mg and nifedipine retard 20 mg ('Nif-Ten') were monitored in a 12-month open study in 30 elderly hypertensive patients, whose blood pressure was inadequately controlled after four weeks treatment with atenolol 50 mg once daily. Sitting (and standing) blood pressure and heart rate one to four hours after dosing were recorded at entry (191/95 mmHg) and at the end of the run-in period (186/93 mmHg). After one month's therapy with the fixed combination the mean sitting blood pressure fell to 169/89 mm Hg and was maintained at this level for the entire 12-month period of observation. During the study four patients complained of side effects on fixed combination therapy with one patient withdrawn due to flushes and hot sweats. One other patient suffered flushes and hot sweats and two patients complained of mild dizziness. There were no demonstrable effects of fixed combination therapy upon the biochemical parameters measured. We conclude that the fixed combination of atenolol plus nifedipine retard was well tolerated over a 12-month period in the group of elderly hypertensive patients studied. The combination appears to exert a greater antihypertensive effect than the beta-blocker monotherapy with no evidence of tachyphylaxis, although these findings require confirmation in a controlled trial.", 
    "78": "We report the results of a randomized, double-blind, parallel group multicentre study in 120 patients with moderate to severe hypertension, comparing two different types of antihypertensive treatment: a) the standard 'triple therapy' with hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol and hydralazine, and b) the combination of an ACE inhibitor, enalapril with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and methyldopa. The two regimens caused similar degrees of blood pressure reductions. The only significant difference between the two groups was heart rate due to the bradycardiac effect of propranolol in the group treated with the standard 'triple therapy'. Only 3.4% of patients receiving the regimen of enalapril, HCTZ and methyldopa were withdrawn from the study for adverse reactions, against 10% of patients on HCTZ, propranolol and hydralazine. Four cases of hypokalaemia in the enalapril group and 19 in the propranolol group were reported: so enalapril seemed to ameliorate the hypokalaemic effect of HCTZ. The overall analysis of the study results shows that the treatment based on enalapril, HCTZ and methyldopa is as efficient and better tolerated than the established regimen of HCTZ, propranolol and hydralazine.", 
    "79": "Dilevalol, the RR-stereoisomer of labetalol, is a non-cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with substantial partial beta 2-agonist and negligible alpha 1-blocking activity. Reduction in blood pressure during dilevalol administration is associated with peripheral vasodilatation, and heart rate remains essentially unchanged. Following oral administration, dilevalol is completely absorbed. Once-daily administration is possible, due to a long elimination half-life. Large well-controlled trials reveal that dilevalol is equivalent in antihypertensive efficacy to metoprolol, the ACE inhibitors captopril and enalapril, and the calcium antagonist nifedipine. Smaller noncomparative and comparative trials demonstrate the blood pressure-lowering effects of dilevalol and suggest an efficacy at least equivalent to that of the 'pure' beta-blockers atenolol and propranolol and the alpha 1-blockers urapidil and doxazosin. Dilevalol appears to be well tolerated, the most frequent adverse effects being dizziness, headache and diarrhoea in only about 7% of patients each. Unlike alpha 1-blockers and labetalol, dilevalol is not commonly associated with orthostatic hypotension. Thus, data suggest that dilevalol, with its distinctive pharmacological profile, is likely to be a useful addition to the options currently available for treating patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.", 
    "80": "Two treatment strategies were compared in 155 women with pregnancy-induced hypertension who were also given comprehensive non-pharmacological care. The mean gestation at entry was 28 weeks. As long as the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) remained below 106 mmHg, oxprenolol, or oxprenolol plus dihydralazine, were given to the early treatment group, and matching placebos to the control group. Open antihypertensive treatment was provided for patients whose DBP rose above 105 mmHg. Proteinuria occurred in seven women in each group. In the early treatment group, 13 of the 78 women were delivered by caesarean section; the corresponding numbers in the control group were 27 of 76 (17 vs 36%, 95% confidence interval (CI) of difference: 5-33%); the sections included seven and 16 in the early treatment and control groups, respectively, for severe hypertension and/or fetal distress. There were five perinatal deaths, two in the early treatment group and three in the control group. Early treatment did not influence gestational age at birth or birthweight. Respiratory distress syndrome occurred in four infants in the early treated group and in 10 in the control group; 14 infants in the former group and 26 in the latter were in hospital for more than 10 days (18 vs 35%; 95% CI of difference 4-32%). These results indicate that early antihypertensive treatment with oxprenolol is safe for the fetus and newborn in pregnancy-induced hypertension, but has no advantage over non-pharmacological care in terms of fetal growth. However, it may prevent acute hypertension in late pregnancy and associated fetal distress, and thus reduce the number of caesarean sections.", 
    "81": "Extensive research and clinical usage of metoprolol have shown the compound to be safe and well tolerated if the contraindications are taken into consideration. However, as with other beta-blockers, unwanted effects may occur during treatment. Although usually mild, these side effects may be of considerable clinical importance, especially since once initiated, therapy is often life-long. Results of previous studies have indicated that some of these symptoms are associated with high plasma concentrations of the drug. Theoretically, side effects may thus be reduced by administration of metoprolol in a controlled-release formulation (CR/ZOK) which yields relatively low plasma concentrations over approximately 24 hours. Using clinically relevant doses, metoprolol CR/ZOK affects beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated functions (e.g., broncho-dilatation in asthmatics) less than tablets do. In addition, less leg fatigue during exercise has been reported. The clinical studies published so far indicate that metoprolol CR/ZOK is as well tolerated as or better tolerated than, conventional metoprolol tablets. Furthermore, metoprolol CR/ZOK is tolerated equally or better than atenolol in terms of CNS-related symptoms.",

The trial was a 4-week randomized double-blind study preceded by a placebo run-in period. Blood pressure (BP) was recorded 24 hours after intake of last dose. In subpopulations, 24-hour ambulatory BP was recorded and exercise tests performed. Subjective symptoms were evaluated with a previously documented questionnaire (MSE-profile) which has been shown to be sensitive in detecting CNS-related symptoms caused by beta blockers. The MSE-profile includes three dimensions: Contentment, Vitality and Sleep. The results showed that there were no significant differences between the groups in BP reduction either at 24 hours or over the entire 24-hour dose interval. Furthermore, the degree of beta 1-blockade (reduction in exercise-induced tachycardia) 24 hours after last dose did not differ between the groups. There were no significant differences regarding subjective symptoms (Contentment, Vitality, Sleep) between the two treatment groups. An a posteriori power analysis showed that the power to detect a true difference was of an acceptable magnitude. In conclusion, there was no difference in CNS-related symptoms between metoprolol and atenolol at therapeutically comparable dosages indicating that the degree of lipophilicity may be of minor importance for the occurrence of such symptoms.", 
    "83": "In a double-blind study with parallel groups, the clinical bioequivalence of the antihypertensive effect of metoprolol CR/ZOK (controlled release formulation) 50 mg and atenolol 50 mg in ordinary tablets given once daily for uncomplicated hypertension was investigated. Clinical bioequivalence was defined as difference in blood pressure reduction less than 8 mmHg. The study involved 195 patients, 98 on metoprolol CR/ZOK and 97 on atenolol. All patients were taken off antihypertensive therapy during a 2-week placebo run-in period. Thereafter the patients were randomly allocated to metoprolol CR/ZOK 50 mg or atenolol 50 mg for 4 weeks. In patients with a diastolic blood pressure remaining above 90 mmHg, the dose was increased to 100 mg daily of the respective drug. After 4 weeks treatment with 50 mg of the two therapies, blood pressure and heart rate was significantly reduced in both treatment groups. At this dose, clinical bioequivalence was found regarding both blood pressure and heart rate reductions. After 8 weeks of therapy (100 mg doses given to 31 in the metoprolol group and 43 in the atenolol group), clinical bioequivalence according to stated definition was found for blood pressures and heart rate reductions, although the reductions of systolic and diastolic blood pressures at rest as well as diastolic blood pressure during exercise were significantly greater in the metoprolol group. In an evaluation of the responder rate after the 8 weeks of treatment, 89% of the patients in the metoprolol CR/ZOK group and 74% in the atenolol group (P less than .05) had a diastolic blood pressure reduction to 90 mmHg or less.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "84": "In two separate but similarly designed placebo-controlled studies, the efficacy of metoprolol CR/ZOK 50 mg once daily was evaluated in 64 patients (mean age 53 years) with mild hypertension (Study I) and in 34 elderly patients (mean age 68 years) with mild to moderate hypertension (Study II). Both studies were of randomized, double-blind, parallel-group design, the entry criteria for diastolic blood pressure being greater than or equal to 90 less than 105 mm Hg in Study I and greater than or equal to 95 less than 110 mm Hg in Study II. Study I: The impact of metoprolol CR/ZOK 50 mg once daily for 4 weeks compared with placebo 24 hours post dosing was to produce a significant reduction in supine (P = .0001), and standing (P less than .0001) systolic blood pressures and the standing diastolic pressure (P = .035). The supine diastolic pressure was lower after metoprolol CR/ZOK but not significantly so. Study II: Metoprolol CR/ZOK 50 mg daily given to elderly hypertensives when compared with placebo 24 hours post dosing produced a significant fall in supine (P = .022) and standing (P = .022) diastolic pressure. Systolic pressure and heart rate were not significantly reduced. One patient in Study II had a nonfatal myocardial infarct whilst receiving placebo. There were no other serious adverse effects in either study and no patients were withdrawn from the trial because of drug related unwanted events. The studies indicate that 50 mg metoprolol CR/ZOK may be an effective antihypertensive agent which may prove useful in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, particularly in the elderly.", 
    "85": "In a randomized double-blind multicenter study in 100 hypertensive patients, the effect of once daily (od) dosing with a new controlled release (CR/ZOK) formulation of metoprolol was compared with that of twice daily (bid) dosing with metoprolol conventional tablets. Eligible patients had a resting seated diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg and less than 110 mm Hg at the end of a 6-week open placebo run-in. The active treatment phase lasted 8 weeks. The starting dose was 100 mg od in the CR/ZOK group (N = 53) and 50 mg bid in the tablet group (N = 47). The dose was increased to 200 mg od and 100 mg bid, respectively, in nonresponders (DBP greater than 95 mm Hg) at the end of the first 4-week period. Approximately 40% of both groups received concomitant diuretic therapy throughout the study. The SBP, DBP and HR were reduced compared to baseline in both treatment groups after 4 and 8 weeks. After 4 weeks, 85% of the CR/ZOK group and 74% of the tablet group had DBP less than 95 mm Hg. After another 4 weeks, the corresponding figures were 93% and 93%. There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups in the decrease in either SBP, DBP or HR, nor was there any difference in the percentage of responders. Both treatments were equally well tolerated. In conclusion, the antihypertensive effect of once daily dosing (100-200 mg) with the new CR/ZOK formulation of metoprolol is as effective as that of twice daily dosing (50-100 mg) with conventional metoprolol tablets."
