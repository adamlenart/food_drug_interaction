    "0": "We present the central haemodynamic data obtained during halothane/nitrous oxide anaesthesia in a patient under antihypertensive treatment with propranolol who underwent surgery for intracranial aneurysms in sodium nitroprusside-induced hypotension. Cardiac output remained unchanged when hypotension was induced. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased. There was a slight increase in heart rate, as well as a minor decrease in stroke volume. Systemic vascular resistance decreased, but pulmonary vascular resistance remained unchanged. The response observed is discussed.", 
    "1": "Interaction of insulin with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists was studied in conscious rabbits. Propranolol and metoprolol did not modify the peak of insulin hypoglycaemia but delayed its recovery. Practolol, sotalol and 1-INPEA enhanced the peak effect and delayed the recovery of insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. H 35/25 and d-INPEA did not modify insulin hypoglycaemia. The beta-blockers did not produce significant hypoglycaemia per se. Since sotalol, 1-INPEA (specific beta-adrenoceptor antagonists devoid of local anaesthetic activity); practolol and metoprolol (selective cardiac beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonists) enhanced hypoglycaemic action of insulin and H 35/25 (a selective beta-2 adrenoceptor antagonist) failed to affect it, it seems that selective beta-adrenoceptor blockade (similar to cardiac beta-1 adrenoceptors) mediates enhancement of insulin hypoglycaemia. Caution should, therefore, be exercised in administering beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and insulin together. A reduction in the dose of insulin may be necessary.", 
    "2": "1. During acute injection of alpha-methyldopa there is a reduction in the blood pressure within a period of a few hours and a modest reduction in the cardiac output, sometimes due to a modest decrease in heart rate. Frequently the total peripheral resistance is decreased. In contrast, acute injection of beta-blockers induces a marked decrease in heart rate and cardiac output, a compensatory increase in the total peripheral resistance and no decrease in the blood pressure. 2. During long-term use alpha-methyldopa frequently reduces the total peripheral resistance and the reduction in cardiac output is usually modest, at rest as well as during exercise. The beta-blockers reduce the blood pressure, but induce a marked decrease in cardiac output and heart rate. The total peripheral resistance is little affected compared to the pre-treatment level.", 
    "3": "1. Two main physiopathological approaches to the treatment of hypertension are discussed, the first based on renin profiling and the second on haemodynamic measurements. 2. Reduction in plasma renin activity does not appear to be a clinically important mechanism in the hypotensive effect of beta-adrenergic blockers and of alpha-methyldopa. In particular, alpha-methyldopa has been found equally effective as a hypotensive agent both in normal renin and in low renin hypertensive patients. 3. Diuretics are certainly possessed of a renin-stimulating action, but in most patients this action does not obscure the hypotensive effect of these drugs. 4. Responders and non-responders to the hypotensive activity of beta-adrenergic blockers do not differ among them in their control haemodynamics.", 
    "4": "Development of autonomic nervous control of basal heart rate was studied in unanesthetized fetal lambs (93 days to term) and newborn lambs (2--29 days), using atropine and/or propranolol blockade. Fetal lambs showed a progressive increase in parasympathetic restraint of heart rate; vagal influence in the newborn lamb was similar to the term fetus. Sympathetic stimulation of fetal heart rate declined toward term, possibly due to the strongly increasing parasympathetic influence. Sympathetic influence in the newborn was similar to the early-gestation fetus. Intrinsic heart rate was about 185 beats/min throughout the fetal and newborn life span studied. Thus changes in basal heart rate resulted from a different balance of the sympathetic and parasympathetic components of the autonomic nervous outflow.", 
    "5": "The haemodynamic effects of massive doses of hydrocortisone (80-320 mg.kg-1), methylprednisolone (4-32 mg.kg-1), betamethasone (1.6-12.8 mg.kg-1) and aldosterone (0.1-0.8 mg.kg-1) and the interaction with phenoxybenzamine and propranolol have been studied during controlled haemorrhagic shock in the anaesthetized dog. Hydrocortisone was the only steroid which showed any significant vasodilating ability when given alone. The alpha-receptor blocking agent phenoxybenzamine distinctly decreased the total peripheral resistance. The effect of the phenoxybenzamine was increased in combination with hydrocortisone or methylprednisolone, especially if the steroid was given as the first drug. The vasodilation found was efficiently abolished by the beta-receptor blocking agent propranolol. The ability of hydrocortisone or methylprednisolone to potentiate phenoxybenzamine was not shared by betamethasone or aldosterone. Thus, the haemodynamic effect of the steroid does not seem to be correlated to either a glucocorticoid nor a mineralocorticoid effect. It is suggested that the steroid effect studied is related to the ability of hydrocortisone or methylprednisolone to block the extra neuronal amine uptake which decreases the rate of elimination of the sympathetic transmitter from the vicinity of the adrenergic receptor of the vascular smooth muscle.", 
    "6": "Haemorrhagic shock was induced in anaesthetized dogs by bleeding them into a blood reservoir system. By adjusting the blood level of the reservoir at a certain distance over the heart level the mean arterial blood pressure was kept at 6.7 kPa (50 mmHg). As has been found earlier, massive doses of hydrocortisone (80-560 mg.kg-1 body weight) caused a dose-dependent decrease in the total peripheral resistance. The degree of vasodilation distinctly increased during concomitant alpha-receptor blockade induced by phenoxybenzamine. The beta-receptor blocking drug propranolol efficiently inhibited the vasodilation caused by hydrocortisone and phenoxybenzamine. The findings fit with the hypothesis that massive doses of hydrocortisone induce an increased stimulation of the adrenergic beta2-receptors of the vascular smooth muscles.", 
    "7": "Vasoconstrictory responses to noradrenaline (NA) or high potassium chloride (130 mM) usually show a biphasic behaviour: an initial peak is followed by a lower steady state level. The influence of three beta-sympatholytic agents (propranolol, pindolol, practolol) and a \"Ca-antagonist\" (verapamil) on this particular behaviour of KCl-induced vasoconstrictions was compared with responses to NA. Studies were performed on the intact vascular bed of an isolated intestinal preparation of the rat. 1. Increases in the concentration of propranolol and pindolol from 10(-10) to 10(-6) M attenuated the vascular responses to high KCl. Practolol, however, distinctly enhanced the KCl-responses. NA (1.3 microgram/ml)-elicited vasoconstriction was found to be influenced in a similar manner by the beta-receptor antagonists used, though lower concentrations of pindolol had an enhancing, higher concentrations a reducing effect on the constrictory responses to NA. 2. The extent to which the biphasic response adjusted to the steady state level was concentration-dependently increased KCl-responses and significantly decreased to a monophasic response to NA, in the presence of the beta-sympatholytic agents. 3. By using a quotient of deltaPs (steady-state phase) to deltaPi (initial vasoconstriction) and by comparing the effect of the three beta-sympatholytic agents with that of verapamil on this quotient showed a concentration-dependent decrease in presence of the beta-sympatholytic as well as of the Ca-antagonistic agents. These myotropic actions, i.e. negative influences on the mechanism of vascular smooth muscle activation ranged in the following sequence: Verapamil greater than propranolol greater than pindolol greater than practolol. 4. The mechanism underlying the biphasic responses to high potassium chloride are concluded to be basically different from the NA-responses because they are inversely affected by beta-sympatholytic agents. The steady-state response to KCl was found to be very sensitive to non-specific pharmacological actions of beta-sympatholytic substances. The myotropic action of the beta-receptor antagonists is compared with that of the Ca-antagonist verapamil and the role of calcium in the mechanism of activation of vascular smooth muscle is discussed.", 
    "8": "Fifty-six experiments were performed in rabbits anesthetized by urethane or sodium pentobarbital. Baroreceptor (aortic nerve) and post-ganglionic sympathetic (renal nerve) activities were recorded, and peripheral resistances were determined after infusion of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents (propranolol, pindolol, timolol). A progressive vasodilation was observed after the onset of infusion of the 3 drugs; at the same time arterial pressure decreased, but aortic flow did not vary significantly. Baroreceptor activity was enhanced, whereas efferent renal nerve activity was decreased.", 
    "9": "The changes in plasma renin activity (PRA) during short-term salt depletion (and peroral furosemide on the first day) and after bolus injection of propranolol were compared to the change during long-term treatment with diuretic and with propranolol in 19 patients with benign primary hypertension. A highly significant correlation was found between PRA on short-term and long-term salt depletion (r=0.02). A highly significant correlation was likewise found between initial PRA and decrement of PRA after bolus injection of or long-term treatment with propranolol. Only a weak inverse correlation was found between PRA reached during short-term salt depletion or long-term diuretic treatment and the fall in diastolic BP during long-term treatment (r=0.60). No significant correlation was found between decrease in PRA on propranolol (bolus/long-term) and diastolic BP reduction. It is concluded that the short-term PRA response to salt depletion and propranolol in the individual patient gives a good prediction of the PRA level on long-term diuretic or propranolol treatment, but is of no value in predicting the BP reduction during treatment.", 
    "10": "The content of cyclic nucleotides (cAMP, cGMP) and Mg2+, Zn2+,Na+ and K+ was determined in human erythrocytes and after beta-adrenergic blockade in healthy individuals. The figures for cAMP and cGMP were 4.20 and 3.36 nmoles/ l intracellular volume, respectively. Only slight effects on the cyclic nucleotide content as well as on cation content were seen upon beta-blockade in the erythrocytes. It is concluded that the single determination of red cell cAMP is not a sufficient indicator of beta-adrenergic blockade. The determination of cAMP in combination with cGMP, Zn2+ and Na+ might reflect a beta-adrenergic blockade.", 
    "11": "Acute toxicity studies in labetalol were performed using mice, rats and rabbits, An oral administration of labetalol produced an increase in salivary secretion due to local irritation. Death followed convulsions by large doses of labetalol. Pathological examinations suggested that the cause of death by labetalol was circulatory disturbances due to the damage of heart muscles and a subsequent respiratory paralysis. Parenteral LD50 showed almost the same values among mice (50 mg/kg iv, 117 mg/kg ip), rats (66 mg/kg iv, 115 mg/kg ip) and rabbits (43 mg/kg iv). However, species difference was seen in oral LD50 values which were enormously large as compared with iv LD50 values.", 
    "12": "A randomized, double-blind study was carried out in 24 patients with stable angina pectoris to compare the efficacy of nadolol, a new beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, and propranolol. After a period on placebo, 14 patients received nadolol once daily and 10 patients propranolol 4-times daily over a 10-week dose-ranging period followed by a maintenance period of 4 weeks. Optimal daily dosage for nadolol was 100 mg, and 112 mg for propranolol. Parameters used for evaluation of therapeutic effects included the number of anginal attacks, number of nitroglycerine tablets needed, time before onset of chest pain during exercise test, exercise time, and overall clinical impression of response. The results indicated that nadolol given once daily was equally as effective as propranolol 4-times daily in treating angina pectoris.", 
    "13": "A preliminary, single-blind, dose-ranging study was carried out in 30 patients with essential hypertension to assess the efficacy of nadolol, a new beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent without intrinsic sympathomimetic action and with an extremely long plasma half-life. After a 2-week period on placebo, patients were treated for 14 weeks with daily doses of 40 mg nadolol (20 mg twice daily). Dosage was increased every second week up to a maximum of 560 mg daily or until the patient was stabilized at an effective normotensive dose level. The results showed that at the end of the trial period there was a significant reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (approximately 34/21 mmHg) at an average daily dose of 110 mg nadolol. Apart from a tendency to bradycardia, explained by the drug's lack of sympathomimetic action, no other side-effects attributable to treatment were reported and no patient complained of sleep disturbance.", 
    "14": "The adrenergic beta-receptor blocking drug, alprenolol, was given together with atropine to 15 patients during neurolept analgesia (NLA) in order to prevent adrenaline-induced cardiac arrhythmias. Four patients operated on without adrenergic beta-receptor blockade formed the control group. Three of them developed tachyarrhythmias, ventricular tachycardia, multifocal ventricular extrasystoles and supraventricular tachycardia. All these arrhythmias were terminated by the adrenergic beta-receptor blocking drug, propranolol. The fourth patient developed a temporary sinus tachycardia which did not require any treatment. The adrenergic beta-receptor blockade induced a slight increase in pulse rate with almost no change in arterial blood pressure. The incidence of arrhythmias due to adrenaline infiltration was much less in this group. There was one supraventricular tachycardia and scattered ventricular extrasystoles in two other patients. NLA alone does not protect the heart against adrenaline-induced arrhythmias. It does, however, seem to be compatible with an adrenergic beta-receptor blockade, which in turn provides partial protection against adrenaline-induced arrhythmias. The occasionally developing arrhythmias can then be terminated with specific adrenergic beta blockers.", 
    "15": "Adrenergic beta-receptor blocking agents, alprenolol, propranolol and practolol were given as a prophylactic measure to patients undergoing middle-ear microsurgery where adrenaline was deliberately infiltrated during halothane-N2O/O2 anaesthesia. These three beta blockers did not differ in their action on heart rate, arterial blood pressure, right ventricular pressure, CVP or peripheral pulse wave in equipotent doses, which were 0.04 mg/kg for alprenolol and propranolol and 0.4 mg/kg for practolol in this study. Atropine caused a highly significant increase in heart rate in the spontaneously ventilating group and maintained blood pressure at higher levels, although the latter difference was not significant. Alprenolol and propranolol offered partial protection for over 40 min against adrenaline-induced arrhythmias. Occasionally occuring tachyarrhythmias were easily terminated with a further dose of a beta blocker. The effective half-life of practolol was less than 15 min and doses up to 0.4 mg/kg were unable to prevent arrhythmias during adrenaline challenge.", 
    "16": "The present study was undertaken to compare the antihypertensive effects of beta-blocking agents and to clarify the relations between antihypertensive effects and beta-blocking actions. In this study, blood pressure was measured by a direct cannulation of the abdominal aorta. Subcutaneous administration of carteolol and pindolol caused a significant fall in mean blood pressure in both normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats, whereas propranolol produced a rise in blood pressure. Maximum fall in blood pressure was observed 3 approximately 7 hr after the administration of carteolol and pindolol. In order to determine the beta-blocking action, changes in heart rate and blood pressure in response to isoproterenol (3 microgram/kg i.v.) were observed during the experiment. beta-Blocking action was found as early as 1 hr after subcutaneous administration. Carteolol showed the most effective blocking action throughout the experiment. Although beta-blocking agents lowered the blood pressure in this experiment, there was no apparent parallel between antihypertensive effects and beta-blocking action on the cardiac function.", 
    "17": "The report describes the hypotensive and antihypertensive activity of the compound N-(trans-3-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-naphtyl)-N'-(3-oxo-3-phenylpropyl) piperazine dihydrochloride (P11). The work is made on normotensive cats and rats as well as on spontaneous and experimental (metacorticoid) hypertension. The studies were carried out under the conditions of acute and chronic experiment as the arteria pressure was recorded by blood and bloodless method. The compound P11 show a manifested hypotensive activity with favourable duration and therapeutic width. Its antihypertensive activity is revealed in rats with spontaneous and metacorticoid hypertension both after single and chronic applciation of the compound. The influence on the blood pressure weakens after reserpinization of the animals. The compound possesses slight ganglion-blocking action and manifested alpha and beta adreno-blocking activity: diminishes noradrenaline, adrenaline and isoprenaline responses on the arterial pressure and heart activity in anesthetised cats and rats, shifts to the right the cumulative dose-response curve of noradrenaline on vas deferens of a rat, ect. The hypotensive and antihypertensive effect of the compound P11 is discussed on the basis of its alpha and beta adrenoblocking action and its specific sedative effect.", 
    "18": "1. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonists atenolol, metoprolol, acebutolol, practolol, propranolol and pindolol have been tested for their ability to reduce isoprenaline-induced bronchodilation and tachycardia in the anaesthetized dog. 2. Atenolol, metoprolol, acebutolol and practolol all possessed a similar degree of cardioselectivity in this animal model.", 
    "19": "In experiments at cardiovascular system level, acebutolol was found to possess beta-adrenolytic activity of cardioselective type associated with intrinsic beta-adrenergic, antiarrhythmic and anti-hypertensive activity. It was well tolerated systemically.", 
    "20": "In basis of our experimental researches bunitrolol presented: a) beta-adrenolytic activity prevailingly at cardiac level (superior to propranolol and practolol) in respect to vascular, tracheal, bronchial, uterus, intestinal and metabolic level; b) beta-adrenergic intrinsic activity; c) local anesthetic activity; d) chinidino-like activity; e) antiarrhythmic activity; f) hypotensive activity with interferences at the level of vasomotor centres, of the barosensitive zones, of the renin secretion and of the purinergic periphery.", 
    "21": "Minoxidil has been administered to 16 patients with severe hypertension and renal failure. In every patient the indication for minoxidil treatment was resistance to conventional drugs. The final dose of minoxidil was 2.5--30 mg (average 20) and it was combined with a beta-blocking agent and a diuretic (or dialysis). The therapy was given for 1--27 months (average 12). The average supine BP fell from 200/130 to 164/96 mmHg and the upright BP from 200/120 to 152/90 mmHg. No hypotensive reactions occurred. In most patients the progression of hypertensive organ changes was arrested. No major vascular complications have occurred during the 16 years of treatment. Prickling of the skin and hirsutism were common side-effects. The other side-effects observed were oedema in five patients and development of latent diabetes in three. In four patients minoxidil treatment was discontinued for following reasons: successful reconstruction of the renal artery after stenosis, renal transplantation, severe oedema and hirsutism. The risk of hirsutism is a contraindication to prolonged minoxidil administration in most femal patients. Minoxidil is especially indicated in uncontrolled renal hypertension.", 
    "22": "The properties of digitonin-solubilized beta-adrenergic receptors from frog erythrocyte membranes were studied by gel exclusion chromatography on AcA 34 Ultragel. beta-Adrenergic receptor binding activity in these membranes can be identified by both an agonist ligand, [(3)H]hydroxybenzylisoproterenol, and the antagonist ligands, [(3)H]dihydroalprenolol and (125)I-labeled hydroxybenzylpindolol. Occupancy of the beta-adrenergic receptors with the [(3)H]hydroxybenzylisoproterenol agonist prior to their solubilization from the membrane leads to an increase in apparent receptor size. Alterations in the molecular size of the receptor cannot be mimicked by occupancy of the binding site with the antagonist ligands. Exposure of frog erythrocyte membranes to [(3)H]hydroxybenzylisoproterenol agonist in the presence of 10 muM Gpp(NH)(p), a guanyl nucleotide analog that exerts multiple regulatory effects on the catecholamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing); EC 4.6.1.1] system, results in the elution of the [(3)H]hydroxybenzylisoproterenol radioligand in both the region characteristic of the agonist-receptor complex and the region characteristic of the antagonist-receptor complex. The precise molecular interactions responsible for the agonist-induced increase in apparent beta-adrenergic receptor size are still unresolved. However, the low concentrations of agonist that are capable of altering apparent receptor size and the sensitivity of this effect to guanyl nucleotides suggest that these phenomena may be intimately involved in eliciting the physiological effects of beta-adrenergic catecholamines at the molecular level.", 
    "23": "S49 mouse lymphoma cell mutants, each with a specific defect in its ability to generate or respond to cyclic AMP, have been isolated. Analysis of the properties of these cells has begun to provide information on complex and significant biologic problems related to the cyclic AMP system.", 
    "24": "Drug interactions with antihypertensive drugs can be either beneficial or hazardous. The hazardous interactions are relatively infrequent but must be shown so they can be avoided. Those of most importance involve interaction with guanethidine-type agents and tricyclic antidepressants, amphetamine-type anorexiants or phenolpropanolamine-type common cold remedies; combined use of potassium retaining diuretics with potassium supplements; and incautious use of diuretics with cardiac glycosides. The beneficial interactions are the basis for modern antihypertensive therapy and can be of major help if logically applied to therapeutic problems.", 
    "25": "The influence of central cholinolytics and adrenoblocking drugs on the hemolysis of rat erythrocytes in the hypoosmotic buffer was studied in vitro. At pH 7.4 in a concentration of 10(-4) M central cholinolytics ethyl-dipracil, diphacil, pediphen, tropacin, and beta-adrenoblocking agent propranolol protected the erythrocytes from hemolysis most intensively. The central M-cholinlytics amizyl, glypin, and alpha-adrenoblocking agents purroxan, sympatholytin, phentolamin were less active. The antihemolytic effect of drugs reached the maximum in the course of 30 minutes, and was maintained for several hours. The protection of erythrocytes from hemolysis by drugs containing tertiary nitrogen was greater. Prevention of the hypoosmotic hemolysis pointed to the stabilization of the erythrocyte membrane by the preparations examined. In the mechanism of action of the central N-cholinolytics and beta-adrenoblocking drugs it is necessary to consider the possibility of stabilization of the membrane formations containing no synaptic contacts.", 
    "26": "Addition of propranolol to the agarose phase of a plaque-forming cell (PFC) assay for rheumatoid factor (RF) caused reduction in the number of plaques seen. This reduction in rheumatoid factor plaque-forming cell (RF PFC) did not depend upon an effect at the beta-adrenergic receptor, since d- and 1-propranolol reduced equally well. Furthermore, in a series of polycyclic compounds with varying beta-receptor blocking capabilities there was no agreement between plaque reduction and blocking. When propranolol was tested in the agarose in an anti-sheep erythrocyte (SRC) plaque assay (anti-SRC PFC), it had no inhibitory effect, but it was capable of inhibiting the generation of new anti-SRC PFC in an in vitro culture. Propranolol is thought to exert these effects through its membrane stabilizing (anesthetic) properties.", 
    "27": "Threo- and erythro-2-(alpha-hydroxybenzyl)-3,3-dimethylaziridines (1a and 1b) and threo-2-[alpha-hydroxy(2-naphthyl)methyl]- and 2-[alpha-hydroxy(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)]-3,3-dimethylaziridines (1d and 1c) have been prepared as conformationally restricted analogues of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents like dichloroisoproterenol (DCI) and pronethalol. The aziridine analogues 1 except possibly 1c are competitive antagonists of isoproterenol-induced response on a guinea pig tracheal chain preparation and the order of potency is 1d greater than 1a greater than or equal to 1b greater than propranolol greater than 1c. Unlike propranolol, these compounds have no effect on the isoproterenol-induced response on guinea pig auricles and no significant local anesthetic and antiarrhythmic activity. The aziridine analogues 1 represent the first of a new class of selective beta2-adrenoceptor blocking agents.", 
    "28": "The synthesis of several 3-alkylamino-2-hydroxypropyl heteroaryl ethers (13-15, 17, and 18) is described. These compounds were prepared by the alkylamination of the corresponding glycidyl ethers (6-8, 10, and 11), which in turn were obtained from the requisite heteroaryl halides and the sodium salt of glycidol. The above basic ethers exhibited beta-blocking activity, but the potency of the tested compounds was considerably less than that of propanolol. Only 3-tert-butylamino-2-hydroxyl-1-(1,2,4-thiadiazol-5-yl) propyl ether (13) showed some selective myocardial beta-blocking activity.", 
    "29": "To determine the pharmacological significance of reported differences between species in l-bunolol metabolism, oral and intravenous beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity against an isoproterenol-induced tachycardia was compared in dogs, rats, and humans. Propranolol was similarly studied in rats and dogs. Species differences in intravenous potency were minimal for both compounds in contrast to oral dose studies. Oral to intravenous ratios of doses causing a comparable degree of beta-adrenoceptor blockade after l-bunolol were: rat, 212; dog 4; and human, 5. For propranolol, the oral to intravenous dose ratios were 210 and 32 for the rat and dog, respectively. These pharmacological findings show major differences in the rat compared to dogs and humans and may be explained in part by differences in the urinary excretion patterns of l-bunolol in the various species.", 
    "30": "We studied the effect of a single dose of atenolol 4% eye drops on 21 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma during a double-blind clinical trial. We monitored intraocular pressure (IOP), blood pressure, and pulse rate. At three and six h after medication, the average reduction of IOP was 7.3 and 4.1 mm Hg, respectively, compared to the baseline readings without medication. The reduction of IOP at four h after medication was 6.3 mm Hg compared to the pretreatment value. This corresponds to an average change from the pretreatment value of 22%. Blood pressure and pulse rate did not change significantly. We observed no subjective or objective ocular side effects. The duration of the effect of a single dose of atenolol 4% eye drops is approximately six h. Atenolol 4% eye drops may become a useful agent in the medical treatment of glaucoma if a long-term effect and no ocular side effects (especially a local anesthetic effect) can be proven.", 
    "31": "Labetalol, a new antihypertensive drug which combines alpha- and beta-blocking properties, was used in an open clinical trial in a mixed group of 47 adult patients with mainly essential hypertension, many of whom had been poorly controlled on other drugs. Labetalol lowered lying and standing blood pressures significantly when given alone or when combined with other antihypertensive drugs and it was generally well tolerated. It is easy to use, and in some severe cases has been dramatically effective. Mean daily dose was 767 mg. A postural hypotensive effect was seen especially in patients taking concomitant diuretics but was not troublesome. Labetalol reduced heart rate in patients who were not on previous or concomitant beta-blocker therapy. Side effects were few and did not cause major problems. A transiently or persistently weakly positive ANF was noted in nine patients; the significance of this is uncertain at this stage and needs further assessment. Raynaud's phenomenon, which had complicated previous beta-blocker therapy in some patients, improved with labetalol.", 
    "32": "The decrease of sympathetic activity by the beta-blocking drug, as demonstrated by the decreased electric activity of the splanchnic nerve and by the decreased urinary catecholamine reponse to tilt as well as by the decreased levels of plasma dopamine beta-hydroxylase exists not only in hypertension with elevated PRA but also in hypertension with normal or low PRA. In these latter cases the antihypertensive effect is better explained by the decrease in the sympathetic nervous system activity than by the decrease of PRA. This effect seems to be indirect and probably, as suggested by Lewis, as a result of damping sensory input to the central nervous system from the heart, whose capacity to respond to exercice and stress is blunted by beta-adreno-receptor blockade.", 
    "33": "Six patients who had surgical treatment for sclerosing peritonitis caused by practolol now have a respiratory disorder characterised by dyspnoea, extensive fibrotic pleural thickening, and lesions in the lung parenchyma. Respiratory disease appears to be a further feature of the practolol syndrome.", 
    "34": "The effects of acute intravenous injection of acebutolol 25 mg on the EEG were investigated in 5 normal subjects. On-line EEG analysis was carried out by a special purpose mini-computer using normalised slope descriptors (hjorth parameters). No significant changes were found apart from those due to drowsiness in 2 subjects, although minute to minute ECG frequency was significantly lowered (p = 0.031). The EEG, which is considered to be a sensitive tool, failed to show any conclusive evidence of any central action of the drug. The effects of beta-adrenergic blockers on the CNS are not yet fully understood.", 
    "35": "The effects of acute introduction and withdrawal of 2 new beta-adrenergic blockers, acebutolol and metoprolol, on sleep in normal subjects were investigated. Both the subjective effects of the drug and EEG sleep variables were determined during a baseline period with placebo and in relation to the drug. The results showed that neither drug had a significant effect on sleep pattern in normal subjects. However, a transient effect on certain sleep parameters was seen on the first night of drug administration, with complete return to baseline, on the following night without any evidence of rebound. Possible mechanisms to explain the central actions of beta-adrenergic blockers are briefly discussed.", 
    "36": "Air temperature differences between the internal and external nars (Ti-e), a qualitative measure of nasal blood flow, and the rate and ionic content of the mucous secretion of the lateral nasal gland, were determined in conscious, chronically instrumented dogs at both 25 degrees C and 42 degrees C environmental temperature, before and after administration of epinephrine, propanolol, phenoxybenzamine, acetylcholine and atropine. B. At 25 degrees C, epinephrine increased Ti-e. This was unaffected by propranolol, but returned to control values with phenoxybenzamine. Acetylcholine and atropine had no effect. At 42 degrees C, acetylcholine increased Ti-e; this was not reversed with atropine. Epinephrine caused a slight decrease in Ti-e at 42 degrees C. C. acetylcholine reduced mucous flow at 25 degrees C; atropine further decreased the flow. Changes in ionic content of the mucous suggest that cholinergic mechanisms affect pressure in the excretory duct of the gland. Epinephrine decreased the mucous flow at 42 degrees C; this was reversed with propranolol. D. It was concluded that nasal blood flow and lateral nasal gland mucous flow both possess sympathetic tone at 25 degrees C, the former being alpha-adrenergic, the latter beta-adrenergic. This tone appears important in reducing heat and water loss under normal conditions, and its reduction at high temperatures allows maximum efficiency of nasal cooling. The role of the parasympathetic system in respiratory heat and water exchange in the dog appears somewhat equivocal.", 
    "37": "More recent investigations on the duration of effect and plasma half-life of propranolol suggest a simplification of dosage for the beta-blocker in the treatment of hypertension. A field trial with Dociton 80 twice daily as initial therapy was carried out in over 2000 patients with essential hypertension with relatively few side effects and confirmed the distinctly longer-persisting effect of the beta-blocker on longterm application. Including the marginal values, the response rate in this collective was relatively high at 73%."
