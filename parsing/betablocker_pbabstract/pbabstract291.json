A new index, the instant centre frequency (ICF) has been proposed as a global index of the instantaneous relationship between sympathetic and vagal modulation. The aim of this study was to assess ICF, RR intervals, and heart rate variability measures as indices of sympathovagal balance during a pharmacological blockade of the autonomic nervous system in normotensive rats. RR intervals and arterial blood pressure of 10 conscious Wistar rats equipped with telemetry probes, were evaluated before, during, and after injection of: (1) saline (100 microl kg(-1) i.v.); (2) phentolamine (5 mg kg(-1) i.v.); (3) atropine methyl nitrate (0.5 mg kg(-1) i.v.); and (4) atenolol (1 mg kg(-1) i.v.). RR interval series were analysed by the smoothed pseudo-Wigner-Ville distribution. A general linearised model was used to evaluate the parameters. ICF was calculated in the same way as the peak power frequency by use of the first moment of instant spectrum. We calculated the ICF of the whole spectrum (ICF(T)), ICF in high frequency (ICF(H)) and ICF in low frequency (ICF(L)). The RR intervals and ICF indexes varied similarly and presented the lowest coefficient of variation among animals exposed to the same autonomic conditions. ICF(T)-ICF(L) and ICF(H)-ICF(T) were strongly correlated with normalised HF and normalised LF. In normotensive rats, RR intervals and ICF indices may reliably capture the effects of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system on the sinus node.", 
    "1": "The tacky and deformable properties of a wax-like drug-fatty acid salt, propranolol oleate (POA), make particle size reduction and separation challenging. The aim of this study was to investigate the use of POA as binder in a melt granulation procedure to improve processing properties. POA is a suitable candidate for binder phase in melt granulation with a melting temperature of 50-56 degrees C. Small batches (ca 30 g) were manufactured using a high shear mixer with lactose monohydrate as the substrate phase. Optimum uniformity of drug content and minimum friability were found at 10% w/w POA binder concentration. POA melt granules exhibited a >10-fold increase in the rate of in vitro dissolution at pH 7.4 with 0.2% w/v sodium lauryl sulphate compared with raw POA. The increased drug surface area in granular form was thought to be responsible for the change in dissolution behaviour. This study has demonstrated that melt granulation using POA as binder is a viable process which leads to beneficial changes in dissolution behaviour for the lipophilic drug-fatty acid salt.",

The progressive understanding of the electrophysiological consequences of these mutations opens unforeseen possibilities for genotype-phenotype correlation studies. Preliminary observations suggested that the conditions (\"triggers\") associated with cardiac events may in large part be gene specific.", 
    "3": "We identified 670 LQTS patients of known genotype (LQT1, n=371; LQT2, n=234; LQT3, n=65) who had symptoms (syncope, cardiac arrest, sudden death) and examined whether 3 specific triggers (exercise, emotion, and sleep/rest without arousal) differed according to genotype. LQT1 patients experienced the majority of their events (62%) during exercise, and only 3% occurred during rest/sleep. These percentages were almost reversed among LQT2 and LQT3 patients, who were less likely to have events during exercise (13%) and more likely to have events during rest/sleep (29% and 39%). Lethal and nonlethal events followed the same pattern. Corrected QT interval did not differ among LQT1, LQT2, and LQT3 patients (498, 497, and 506 ms, respectively). The percent of patients who were free of recurrence with ss-blocker therapy was higher and the death rate was lower among LQT1 patients (81% and 4%, respectively) than among LQT2 (59% and 4%, respectively) and LQT3 (50% and 17%, respectively) patients.",

Mean ethanol level was 0.116+/-0.133 SD (range 0-0.482). Mean Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 7.9+/-4.0 SD. Cranial computed tomography (CT) hemorrhagic findings included 9 subdural/epidural hematomas, 6 cortex hemorrhages, and 2 multi-hemorrhages. Eleven patients received surgical intervention: 9 patients received a craniotomy, and 2 a ventricular catheter. The 2-minute time interval around intubation was used to assess each drug's efficacy. The mean difference change between groups for heart rate was 4.0 beats/min (95% CI = -17.7 to 9.7 beats/min), for systolic blood pressure was 1.3 mm Hg (95% CI = -27.8 to 30.4 mm Hg), and for diastolic blood pressure was 2.6 mm Hg (95% CI = -27.1 to 21.9 mm Hg).

    "13": "Ventricular septal (150-200 microm) arteries were isolated from the hearts of six-week-old CD-1 mice and mounted on a pressure myograph. Equilibration of the vessels at 70 mm Hg for 60 min resulted in the development of spontaneous myogenic tone. Maximum tone observed in these vessels greatly exceeded that previously reported in septal arteries from rats. Inhibition of endothelin ET(A) and endothelin ET(B) receptors with bosentan (1 and 10 microM) reduced basal tone. Endothelin release required intact endothelial cells. The alpha(1)-adrenceptor selective agonists phenylephrine and methoxamine did not cause change in coronary tone, while the alpha(2)-adrenceptor selective agonists 6-allyl-2-amino5,6,7, 8-tetrahydro-4H-thiazolo-[4,5-d]azepin-dihydrochloride (BHT 920) and clonidine produced vasodilatation. Noradrenaline (1 nM-10 microM) induced a concentration-dependent vasodilatation, which was inhibited by concurrent treatment with yohimbine (10 microM) and propranolol (20 microM). Vasodilatation due to BHT 920 was abolished with vessel denudation, indicating the endothelial location of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors. Acetylcholine (1 nM-10 microM) caused an endothelium dependent vasodilatation; inhibition of nitric oxide synthase with N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester attenuated this response. The endothelium-dependent vasodilators bradykinin and substance P produced no vasomotor effect in mouse coronary arteries. Differences between human and murine responses may impact on the relevance of the mouse coronary artery for use as a potential model of human coronary vessel diseases.", 
    "14": "We have previously documented the importance of the sympathetic nervous system in acclimatizing to high altitude in men. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the extent to which alpha-adrenergic blockade affects the sympathoadrenal responses to exercise during acute high-altitude exposure in women. Twelve eumenorrheic women (24.7 +/- 1.3 yr, 70.6 +/- 2.6 kg) were studied at sea level and on day 2 of high-altitude exposure (4,300-m hypobaric chamber) in either their follicular or luteal phase. Subjects performed two graded-exercise tests at sea level (on separate days) on a bicycle ergometer after 3 days of taking either a placebo or an alpha-blocker (3 mg/day prazosin). Subjects also performed two similar exercise tests while at altitude. Effectiveness of blockade was determined by phenylephrine challenge. At sea level, plasma norepinephrine levels during exercise were 48% greater when subjects were alpha-blocked compared with their placebo trial. This difference was only 25% when subjects were studied at altitude. Plasma norepinephrine values were significantly elevated at altitude compared with sea level but to a greater extent for the placebo ( upward arrow 59%) vs. blocked ( upward arrow 35%) trial. A more dramatic effect of both altitude ( upward arrow 104% placebo vs. 95% blocked) and blockade ( upward arrow 50% sea level vs. 44% altitude) was observed for plasma epinephrine levels during exercise. No phase differences were observed across any condition studied. It was concluded that alpha-adrenergic blockade 1) resulted in a compensatory sympathoadrenal response during exercise at sea level and altitude, and 2) this effect was more pronounced for plasma epinephrine.", 
    "15": "The effect of denopamine, a selective beta(1)-adrenergic agonist, on alveolar fluid clearance was determined in both ex vivo rat and guinea pig lungs. Alveolar fluid clearance was measured by the progressive increase in the concentration of Evans blue-labeled albumin over 1 h at 37 degrees C. Denopamine (10(-6) to 10(-3) M) increased alveolar fluid clearance in a dose-dependent manner in ex vivo rat lungs. Denopamine also stimulated alveolar fluid clearance in guinea pig lungs. Atenolol, a selective beta(1)-adrenergic antagonist, and amiloride, a sodium channel inhibitor, inhibited denopamine-stimulated alveolar fluid clearance. The potency of denopamine was similar to that of similar doses of isoproterenol or terbutaline. Short-term hypoxia (100% nitrogen for 1-2 h) did not alter the stimulatory effect of denopamine. Denopamine (10(-4), 10(-3) M) increased intracellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate levels in cultured rat alveolar type II cells. In summary, denopamine, a selective beta(1)-adrenergic agonist, stimulates alveolar fluid clearance in both ex vivo rat and guinea pig lungs.", 
    "16": "It has previously been reported that the beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, betaxolol, can protect retinal neurones from ischaemia when applied topically. It has further been shown that betaxolol can reduce influx of both sodium or calcium into neurones through interaction at neurotoxin site 2 of the sodium channel and the L-type calcium channel, respectively. The present study sought to further investigate the neuroprotective mode of action of betaxolol in the rat retina. Rats were treated topically with L-betaxolol for 10, 5 and 1 min before ischaemia, induced by raising the intraocular pressure above systolic blood pressure for 45 min. This was followed by reperfusion of 3 or 5 days where L-betaxolol was applied topically twice daily. Ischaemia plus reperfusion caused both a loss of immunoreactivity for choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) and a marked reduction of the b-wave of the electroretinogram (ERG). Treatment, as described, with topical L-betaxolol, completely blunted the effects upon ChAT immunoreactivity and caused a significant reversal of the ERG changes. Furthermore, other rats treated topically with commercially available racemic betaxolol (Betoptic Solution, 0.5%) for 6 hr had raised levels of mRNA for brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) but not for basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in their retinas. The combined data provide further evidence that betaxolol can blunt the effects of ischaemia to the rat retina when applied topically just before the insult. Furthermore, the finding that retinal levels of BDNF mRNA are raised following topical betaxolol treatment shows that not only can this drug reach the retina but that it can also induce changes in expression of factors which are known, themselves, to provide neuroprotection to retinal neurones.",

Ultrasonographic assessments of intima-media thickness, lumen diameter and plaques in the carotid and femoral arteries were evaluated in a subgroup of 558 patients (182 females) with a mean age of 60 +/-7 years, and related to the risk of cardiovascular death (n = 18) or non-fatal myocardial infarction (n = 26), or revascularization (n = 70) during follow-up (median 3.0 years). Univariate Cox regression analyses showed that carotid intima-media thickness and plaques were related to the risk of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction. Femoral intima-media thickness was related to cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction, as well as to revascularization, whereas femoral plaques were only related to the latter. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, previous cardiovascular disease and lipid status, carotid intima-media thickness failed to predict any cardiovascular event, whereas carotid plaques tended (P = 0.056) to predict the risk of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction. Femoral intima-media thickness (P < 0.01) and plaques (P < 0.05) were also related to the risk of revascularization after adjustments.", 
    "19": "Carotid and femoral vascular changes were differently related to cardiovascular events. Carotid intima-media thickness was a weak predictor of events, whereas femoral intima-media thickness predicted revascularization. Plaques in the carotid artery were related to cardiovascular death or non-fatal myocardial infarction, whereas plaques in the femoral artery were related to revascularization. Evaluations of plaques provided better prediction than assessments of intima-media thickness in patients with stable angina.",

Three formulations (one experimental vehicle based on TSP and two reference commercial eye drops) containing 5 mg/ml timolol base equivalents were administered to the eyes of pigmented rabbits. Drug concentrations in tear fluid, cornea, iris-ciliary body, aqueous humor and plasma were determined, as well as intraocular pressure. The polymer under investigation, in spite of a comparatively low viscosity, produced high timolol concentrations in the ocular tissues and a low systemic absorption. The performances of the TSP vehicle were comparable to those of a reference \"in situ\" gelling formulation (Timoptic XE). The results point to TSP as a potentially useful adjuvant for ophthalmic delivery systems.",

In the present study, the influences of the anti-migraine preparations metoprolol, propranolol, metoclopramide, acetylsalicylic acid, dihydro-ergotamine and sumatriptan on monocyte chemotaxis were examined in vitro. First, mononuclear cells were isolated by centrifugation from venous blood samples obtained from 10 healthy male volunteers. Chemotaxis was determined using a microchemotaxis chamber. While metoprolol, metoclopramide, dihydroergotamine and sumatriptan did not influence monocyte chemotaxis, high doses of propranolol and acetylsalicylic acid caused a significant (p < or = 0.001) inhibition of this important cellular function. Therefore, it is quite possible that both drugs produce adverse immunological effects in vivo in cases of high dosage or obstruction of elimination.",

    "31": "We investigated alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated positive chronotropic action in children using a pharmacological autonomic function test. Under cardiac vagal and sympathetic blockade, chronotropic responses to intravenous infusion of an alpha-agonist, phenylephrine, were determined in 129 patients with suspected autonomic dysfunction. Heart rate changes to phenylephrine infusion (0.4 microg/kg/min) for 5 minutes ranged from -2 to 50 beats/min (mean +/- SD, 13.8 +/- 9.7 beats/min). alpha-Adrenoceptor-mediated chronotropic (APC) action more than 5 beats/min was observed in 88 (68%) subjects. APC was negatively correlated with age. Multivariate analysis showed that APC was correlated negatively with beta-sympathetic tone and positively correlated with intrinsic heart rate. These results suggest that the alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated chronotropic action is a developmental phenomenon and may play an important role in controlling heart rate in response to cardiac sympathetic activation.",

All 73 patients with a positive HUT test received Atenolol therapy (50 mg daily). Only 35 of these 73 patients took Atenolol regularly and had a repeat HUT test. After atenolol therapy, persistent positive responses were observed in 19 cases (19/35 = 54%) and negative responses were noted in 16 cases (16/35 = 46%). The mean dosage of isoproterenol needed to provoke a positive HUT test in 19 patients who had received Atenolol therapy and had a positive repeat HUT test was 2.3 +/- 1.2 microg/min at baseline and 3.5 +/- 0.9 microg/min for post-Atenolol therapy (p < 0.001). Sixteen patients with a negative repeat HUT test were treated continuously with Atenolol and followed for a mean period of 13 +/- 11 months (range, 1-34 months). All 16 patients were free of syncope or pre-syncope during the period of follow up.

Hypertensive patients were assigned to monotherapy with one of five different antihypertensive drugs for 6 months, and the change of plasma levels of beta-TG was reexamined after the completion of the monotherapy. The plasma beta-TG increased in hypertensive patients compared with levels in normotensive control subjects. Monotherapy with each drug resulted in sufficient blood pressure control in all hypertensive patients. The plasma beta-TG decreased significantly after monotherapy with an alpha-blocker or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI). The plasma beta-TG increased with the use of a diuretic but did not change with the use of a beta-blocker or calcium antagonist. The platelet activation observed in patients with essential hypertension is reversed by monotherapy with an alpha-blocker or an ACEI. It is possible that these drugs reduce the development of hypertensive vascular complications due to suppression of platelet activation in patients with essential hypertension.",

Enalapril significantly reduced urinary albumin excretion in microalbuminuric patients, whereas nicardipine did not. Urinary beta2-microglobulin excretion was significantly increased during nicardipine treatment. However, both drugs significantly reduced plasma ET-1 as compared with pretreatment levels, close to that in healthy control (2.9 +/- 0.3 pg/ml in control, 4.8 +/- 0.3 pg/ml before treatment, 3.2 +/- 0.3 pg/ml during nicardipine vs before treatment p<0.05, 2.9 +/- 0.4 pg/ml during enalapril vs before treatment p<0.01).

    "40": "High-field 1H-NMR methodology for enantiomeric composition determination of the chiral drug propranolol utilizing a chiral solvating agent is reported. Optimal experimental conditions for the resolution of enantiomers were determined by studying the interaction of substrate concentration, chiral solvating agent concentration and temperature. The success of the method is based on the selection of a chiral solvating agent that has the following two characteristics. First, it possesses functional groups that are complimentary to those of the chiral substrate for significant interaction to occur. Second, it has a group of diamagnetic anisotropy near its stereogenic center for translating spatial environments of solute nuclei into different magnetic environments that are measurable by NMR spectroscopy. Optical purities were determined on the basis of the intensities of the methyl proton resonances. The analysis of synthetic enantiomeric mixtures of propranolol by the proposed NMR method resulted in assay values, which agreed closely with the known quantities of each enantiomer in the mixtures tested. The mean +/- SD recovery values for the (R)-(+)-enantiomer was 100.0+/-0.6% of added antipode (n = 7).",

Rats were subjected to banding of the abdominal aorta and then treated with either propranolol (10 mg/kg daily), verapamil (5 mg/kg daily) or vehicle for 8 weeks after the surgery. Depression of the left ventricular function in the hypertrophied heart was associated with decreases in myofibrillar and myosin Ca2+ ATPase activities as well as Ca2+-pump and Ca2+-release activities of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The level of alpha-myosin heavy chain (alpha-MHC) mRNA was decreased while that of beta-MHC mRNA was increased in the pressure-overloaded heart. The level of SR Ca2+-pump ATPase (SERCA2) mRNA and protein content for SERCA2 were decreased in the pressure overloaded heart. Treatment of the hypertrophied animals with propranolol or verapamil resulted in preservation of the left ventricular function and prevention of the subcellular alterations. Shift in the alpha- and beta-MHC mRNA levels and changes in the expression in SERCA2 mRNA level and protein content were also attenuated by these treatments. The results suggest that blockade of beta-adrenoceptors or voltage-dependent calcium channels normalizes the cardiac gene expression, prevents subcellular remodeling and thus attenuates heart dysfunction in rats with cardiac hypertrophy. Furthermore, both cardiac beta-adrenoceptors and L-type Ca2+-channels may be involved in the genesis of cardiac hypertrophy due to pressure overload.", 
    "43": "The effect of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) on neurohormonal activation in patients with congestive heart failure has been the subject of study in numerous small clinical trials. Short term therapy with beta-blockers is associated with a variable acute neurohormonal response which may be determined by the pharmacology of the agent under study and the baseline characteristics of the patient population. Long term therapy with beta-blockers devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (partial agonist activity) is associated with evidence of decreased plasma markers of activation of the sympathetic nervous system, the renin-angiotensin system, and endothelin-1. Beta1-selective and nonselective beta-blockers appear to be associated with evidence of decreased neurohormonal activation, with differential effects on beta-adrenoceptor density. Agents with partial agonist activity appear to differ from pure antagonists, with some studies reporting evidence of increased neurohormonal activation. The mechanisms by which beta-blockers reduce neurohormonal activation and the clinical relevance of changes in adrenergic function to their use in the treatment of heart failure require further investigation.", 
    "44": "Changes to the binding properties of cortical N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) and beta-adrenergic receptors have both been reported as potential indicators of antidepressant activity. In the present investigation we examined the effects of the noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, reboxetine, the serotonin reuptake inhibitor, sertraline, alone and in combination on the binding properties of cortical NMDA receptors and cortical beta1-adrenoceptors following 14 days of treatment in the olfactory bulbectomized rat model of depression. A decrease in the potency of glycine to displace the strychnine insensitive glycine antagonist [3H] 5,7 dichlorokynurenic acid (5,7 DCKA) was observed in cortical homogenates of OB rats when compared to sham-operated controls. Similarly, treatment with the combination of reboxetine and sertraline for 14 days produced a decrease in the potency of glycine when compared to vehicle treated controls. By contrast neither olfactory bulbectomy or drug treatment significantly altered basal or glycine enhanced binding of the non-competitive NMDA antagonist [3H] MK-801 in cortical homogenates. Reboxetine alone, and in combination with sertraline, down-regulated [3H]-CGP 12177 (a selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist) binding in both OB and sham-operated animals. The lack of a bulbectomy effect in the [3H] CGP-12177 binding assay, and the fact that olfactory bulbectomy and antidepressant treatments produce a similar change to the potency of glycine at the NMDA receptor, suggests that these tests do not provide a neurochemical marker for either the behavioral hyperactivity deficit or antidepressant response in the model.", 
    "45": "The primary aim of this research was to evaluate the effect of acute norepinephrine (NE) infusion on the exercise oxygen utilization in heart failure patients as compared with healthy adults.", 
    "46": "Eleven healthy adults and 10 patients with NYHA class II-III heart failure (ejection fraction <40%) who were not on beta-blocker therapy underwent steady state exercise under placebo or NE infusion conditions, followed by maximal ramp exercise testing. Oxygen utilization, hemodynamic responses, and serum lactate NE levels were evaluated.", 
    "47": "The hemodynamic effects of NE were evident in both groups with statistically significant increases in blood pressure and concomitant decreases in heart rates. Lactate levels were higher in heart failure subjects under all conditions and steady state exercise increased levels by 24% (P = 0.04). NE infusion increased lactate levels by a nonsignificant 24% (P = 0.19). NE infusion tended to increase oxygen consumption (VO2) at the end of steady state exercise in CHF subjects (4% change; P = 0.06). Compared with healthy adults, NE infusion significantly impaired (increased) the gross VO2/W relationship in heart failure subjects (P = 0.037). There was also a modest trend for a worsening (decrease) in net efficiency after NE infusion in CHF subjects. There were no significant adverse effects of low-dose NE infusion in either group.", 
    "48": "We conclude that 1) acute low-dose NE infusion impairs the oxygen utilization in stable heart failure patients but not in healthy adults. This may help to explain the exercise intolerance that accompanies congestive heart failure. 2) Acute infusion of low-dose NE infusion is safe and well tolerated in both healthy adults and compensated heart failure patients.", 
    "49": "Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), for the templates free base racemic propranolol and the L-enantiomer of phenylalanine anilide (L-PA), were investigated as stationary phases in supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC). Large retention differences were observed on the propranolol MIP for both the template molecule and the structural analogue metoprolol compared to that observed on the corresponding blank polymer. Mobile phase composition and solute concentration were found to affect this retention behaviour. The phenylalanine anilide MIP (L-PA MIP) was found to be enantioselective in SFC with stronger retention observed for the template enantiomer. Throughout the study, characteristic imprinting peak shapes for the stronger retained template molecule were observed for both MIPs examined. After a number of days under supercritical fluid conditions, the performance of the photochemically initiated L-PA MIP was found to significantly deteriorate whereas the thermally initiated propranolol MIP revealed only small changes in its separation performance after a long term of operation. The separation behaviour of these two MIPs in SFC was compared with results obtained on the same columns in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) both before and after their application in SFC.", 
    "50": "The purposes of this study were to determine whether the serum of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) can induce apoptosis of endothelial cells and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Moreover, the effect of the beta-blocker carvedilol was investigated.", 
    "51": "Congestive heart failure is associated with impaired endothelial function in the peripheral systemic vasculature and with systemic release of inflammatory cytokines. Pro-inflammatory cytokines have been shown to induce endothelial cell apoptosis in vitro. Therefore, we hypothesized that CHF is associated with enhanced apoptosis of endothelial cells.", 
    "52": "Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were exposed to the serum of patients with CHF (n = 15) or healthy volunteers (n = 11), and apoptosis was determined by fluorescence staining of the nuclei and demonstration of deoxyribonucleic acid laddering. Moreover, apoptotic membrane particles were detected in plasma samples of patients with CHF.", 
    "53": "The serum of patients with CHF revealed a significantly enhanced pro-apoptotic activity as compared with age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers (p < 0.001). Furthermore, patients with CHF revealed significantly elevated plasma concentrations of apoptotic membrane particles. Apoptosis of endothelial cells correlated with elevated tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (r = 0.585, p = 0.002) and soluble TNF receptor serum levels (r = 0.517, p = 0.007). Carvedilol completely suppressed the increase in apoptosis induced by the serum of patients with CHF. Moreover, carvedilol dose-dependently inhibited TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis. The antiapoptotic activity of carvedilol was mediated by reduced activation of the caspase cascade through inhibition of mitochondrial cytochrome c release. The suppression of apoptosis by carvedilol was due to its antioxidative rather than beta-blocking effects, as the analogue BM91.0228, which has no beta-blocking activity, exerted similar effects.", 
    "54": "These findings indicate that endothelial cell apoptosis may play a role in the pathophysiology of heart failure. Inhibition of endothelial cell apoptosis by carvedilol may contribute to the beneficial effects of carvedilol in patients with heart failure.", 
    "55": "The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of beta1-blockade on left ventricular (LV) size and function for patients with chronic heart failure.", 
    "56": "Large-scale trials have shown that a marked decrease in mortality can be obtained by treatment of chronic heart failure with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. Possible mechanisms behind this effect remain yet to be fully elucidated, and previous studies have presented insignificant results regarding suspected LV antiremodeling effects.", 
    "57": "In this randomized, placebo-controlled and double-blind substudy to the Metoprolol CR/XL Randomized Intervention Trial in Heart Failure (MERIT-HF), 41 patients were examined with magnetic resonance imaging three times in a six-month period, assessing LV dimensions and function.", 
    "58": "Decreases in both LV end-diastolic volume index (150 ml/m2 at baseline to 126 ml/m2 after six months, p = 0.007) and LV end-systolic volume index (107 ml/m2 to 81 ml/m2, p = 0.001) were found, whereas LV ejection fraction increased in the metoprolol CR/XL group (29% to 37%, p = 0.005). No significant changes were seen in the placebo group regarding these variables. Left ventricular stroke volume index remained unchanged, whereas LV mass index decreased in both groups (175 g/m2 to 160 g/m2 in the placebo group [p = 0.005] and 179 g/m2 to 164 g/m2 in the metoprolol CR/XL group [p = 0.011).", 
    "59": "This study is the first randomized study to demonstrate that the beta1-blocker metoprolol CR/XL has antiremodeling effects on the LV in patients with chronic heart failure and consequently provides an explanation for the highly significant decrease in mortality from worsening heart failure found in the MERIT-HF trial.", 
    "60": "Recent studies have shown that beta blocker therapy improves survival and reduces hospitalizations in patients who have chronic heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction, the majority of whom are under the management of primary care physicians. Appropriate patient selection is essential to the successful initiation of beta blocker therapy. Candidates should be stable in New York Heart Association functional class II or III. Patients with severe heart failure, especially inotrope-dependent and hospitalized patients, and those with hypotension, bradycardia or higher than first-degree heart block are not considered appropriate candidates for beta blocker therapy. Optimal diuresis is essential for maximal tolerability. Beta blockers should be started at the lowest dose, with the dose increased every two to four weeks until the target dose or highest tolerated dose is reached. Close monitoring allows for the detection and appropriate management of side effects, such as hypotension, bradycardia and increased congestion. The treatment goal is long-term improvement of prognosis, rather than immediate improvement of symptoms.",

A study of the relationship between the structure and enzymatic hydrolysis of the homologous series of oxprenolol esters was made.", 
    "62": "Stability of series of O-acyl esters of oxprenolol prepared as potential pro-drugs, is investigated over the pH range 0.4-10 at 37 degrees C. Maximum stability of all esters occurred at pH 3-4. The most stable derivative was found to be pivaloyl ester. The relationship between Charton Steric parameters (v) and the catalytic rate constant of hydrolysis is investigated.",

    "64": "A prescribing survey of antihypertensive combination regimens among patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension was conducted in 7 out of a total of 18 health centers in Bahrain. The relevant data for our study was collected using cards designed for chronically ill patients.", 
    "65": "A total of 2414 hypertensive patients (62.9%), of a 3838 study population, were on monotherapy, whereas 1414 (37.1%) were on antihypertensive combination therapy. Among those who were treated with drug combinations, 85.1% (n = 1212) received two-drug, 14.2% (n = 202) received three-drug and four- and five-drug regimens were used by 0.6% and 0.07%, respectively. Prescription analysis revealed that 17 different two- and three-antihypertensive drug combinations were prescribed for each category. The four major two-drug regimens were ranked in the following order: a beta-blocker with a diuretic (40.4%) used more frequently in females than in males (p < 0.0001), a beta-blocker with a calcium channel blocker (19.7%), a beta-blocker with an ACE inhibitor (12.8%) and a diuretic with an ACE inhibitor (7.3%) - used more frequently in males than in females (p = 0.001, 0.01, and 0.028, respectively). The most frequently prescribed three-drug regimens were diuretic and a beta-blocker plus either an ACE inhibitor (30.7%) or a calcium channel blocker (22.3%), beta-blocker plus an ACE inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker (16.3%), and a diuretic plus an ACE inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker (11.4%). There was no gender-related difference among triple-drug regimens. There was a trend towards using high doses of the beta-blocker atenolol, ACE inhibitors and methyldopa.", 
    "66": "The prescribing patterns of some practising physicians were analyzed in terms of conformity with guidelines of combination of drugs and dosages. The use of antihypertensive combination therapy and the doses of individual drugs in combination regimens seem to be partly non-compliant with guidelines issued by WHO recommendations; this is illustrated by excessive prescription of some irrational combinations, as well as limited prescription of some rational combinations. In addition, a tendency to use high doses of certain classes of antihypertensive combinations was observed.", 
    "67": "Influences of isoflurane and esmolol on endotracheal intubation induced sympathetic changes could be different. The effect of isoflurane and its combination with esmolol on catecholamine, blood pressure and pulse during endotracheal intubation were investigated.", 
    "68": "Thirty patients were anesthetized with 3.0% isoflurane and tracheal intubation was carried out at the 5th min following the exposure to isoflurane. Half of them received intravenous saline and the other half received esmolol 2 mg/kg at the 4th min. Cardiovascular parameters were recorded and venous blood samples were taken for measurement of catecholamines every min.", 
    "69": "One min after administration of isoflurane, there was increase of heart rate (P < 0.05), while at the same time the epinephrine level fell (P < 0.05) and norepinephrine level remained unaltered. Both catecholamines raised after intubation (P < 0.05). The sympathetic responses to and the beta-antagonistic effect of esmolol on intubation were not significantly changed in the presence of isoflurane.", 
    "70": "Isoflurane increased heart rate while paradoxically decreased epinephrine. Norepinephrine was more specifically related to endotracheal intubation, for its serum level had little change before the event. Based on catecholamine findings, the mechanism of isoflurane effect on the sympathetic system is probably different from that of endotracheal intubation.", 
    "71": "During pregnancy a number of rhythm disturbances can occur in both the mother and fetus; these may range from benign ectopy to life-threatening arrhythmias. With a clear understanding of the maternal hemodynamic changes associated with pregnancy, and the appropriate antiarrhythmic therapies available, almost all such cases can be treated successfully. Although no drug is completely safe, most are well tolerated and can be given with relatively low risk. Drug therapy should be avoided during the first trimester of pregnancy if possible and drugs with the longest record of safety should be used as first-line therapy. Conservative therapies should be used when appropriate. Several drug options exist for most maternal and fetal arrhythmias.", 
    "72": "Although acute stress has been reported to suppress natural killer cell activity (NKA) and host resistance to metastasis, it is unclear whether the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) has a role in these effects. The current study in Fischer 344 rats assessed the involvement of adrenal catecholamines and beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors in mediating these deleterious effects of swim stress. In addition to assessing the number and activity of NK cells following swim stress, we used a tumor model based on the MADB106 mammary adenocarcinoma line: this syngeneic tumor metastasizes only to the lungs, and its lung tumor retention (LTR) and metastatic colonization are highly sensitive to NKA. The findings indicate that stress increased both LTR, assessed 24 h after inoculation, and the number of lung metastases, counted 3 weeks later. These effects were attenuated or completely abolished by the ganglionic blocker chlorisondamine (3 mg/kg i.p.), by adrenal demedullation, by a selective beta-adrenergic antagonist (nadolol, 0.4 mg/kg), and additively by a selective beta(1)- (atenolol, 1-6 mg/kg) and a selective beta(2)-antagonist (either butoxamine 4-32 mg/kg or ICI-118,551 0.3-8 mg/kg). Stress also suppressed NKA, and adrenal demedullation prevented this suppression. Administration of adrenaline (0.1-1 mg/kg) or of a beta-adrenergic agonist (metaproterenol, 0.8 mg/kg), in physiologically relevant doses, suppressed NKA in a dose-dependent manner, and increased LTR to levels characteristic of swim stress. Taken together, these findings suggest that acute stress, by releasing catecholamines from the adrenal glands and activating beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors, suppresses NKA and consequently compromises resistance to NK-sensitive metastasis.",

The average IOP readings before and 1 month after the change were compared.", 
    "75": "The mean baseline IOP in the entire study population was 19.4 +/- 4.2 mm Hg in the study eyes and 16.9 +/- 4.2 mm Hg in the control eyes. Four weeks after the medication change, the mean IOP was 17.3 +/- 3.9 mm Hg in the study eyes (P <.001) and 16.1 +/- 4.1 mm Hg in the control eyes (P =.02). The difference between the mean IOP change of 2.1 mm Hg in the study eyes and 0.8 mm Hg in the control eyes was found to be statistically significant (P =.01).", 
    "76": "These findings suggest that the fixed combination dorzolamide-timolol therapy achieves additional lowering of the intraocular pressure compared with the concomitant administration of a beta-blocker and dorzolamide.", 
    "77": "We evaluated the anterior segment surface reaction findings between timolol hemihydrate and timolol maleate. The only known difference between these preparations is the maleate salt.",

Subjects were left untreated for 1 week and then switched to the opposite medication for the second study period.",

Also, mean punctate corneal staining for timolol maleate was increased from baseline (22.6) to hour 0 (31.7; P =.033) and showed borderline significance to hour 1 (33.4; P =.058), and for timolol hemihydrate there was a borderline significant elevation from baseline (24.2) to hour 1 (29.8; P =.060). When treatment groups were compared, there was a greater change in corneal staining with timolol maleate than timolol hemihydrate from baseline to hour 0 (P =.020) and greater staining with timolol maleate than timolol hemihydrate at hour 0 (P =.032). Nasal conjunctiva showed increased mean staining with timolol maleate from baseline (23.6, P =.035) to hour 0 (29.5, P =.035) and to hour 1 (31.9 P =.038) but not with timolol hemihydrate. There were increased symptoms of ocular dryness from baseline to hour 0 with timolol maleate (P =.012) but not with timolol hemihydrate.", 
    "80": "The study suggests that timolol maleate potentially may have more of an irritant effect than timolol hemihydrate on the corneal and nasal conjunctival epithelium.", 
    "81": "Norepinephrine (NE)-induced desensitization of the adrenergic receptor pathway may mimic the effects of hypoxia on cardiac adrenoceptors. The mechanisms involved in this desensitization were evaluated in male Wistar rats kept in a hypobaric chamber (380 Torr) and in rats infused with NE (0.3 mg. kg(-1). h(-1)) for 21 days. Because NE treatment resulted in left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, whereas hypoxia resulted in right (RV) hypertrophy, the selective hypertrophic response of hypoxia and NE was also evaluated. In hypoxia, alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors (AR) density increased by 35%, only in the LV. In NE, alpha(1)-AR density decreased by 43% in the RV. Both hypoxia and NE decreased beta-AR density. No difference was found in receptor apparent affinity. Stimulated maximal activity of adenylate cyclase decreased in both ventricles with hypoxia (LV, 41%; RV, 36%) but only in LV with NE infusion (42%). The functional activities of G(i) and G(s) proteins in cardiac membranes were assessed by incubation with pertussis toxin (PT) and cholera toxin (CT). PT had an important effect in abolishing the decrease in isoproterenol-induced stimulation of adenylate cyclase in hypoxia; however, pretreatment of the NE ventricle cells with PT failed to restore this stimulation. Although CT attenuates the basal activity of adenylate cyclase in the RV and the isoproterenol-stimulated activity in the LV, pretreatment of NE or hypoxic cardiac membranes with CT has a less clear effect on the adenylate cyclase pathway. The present study has demonstrated that 1) NE does not mimic the effects of hypoxia at the cellular level, i.e., hypoxia has specific effects on cardiac adrenergic signaling, and 2) changes in alpha- and beta-adrenergic pathways are chamber specific and may depend on the type of stimulation (hypoxia or adrenergic).", 
    "82": "A new nonsulfonylurea oral hypoglycemic agent, JTT-608, has been reported to stimulate insulin release at elevated, but not low, glucose concentrations and consequently not to induce hypoglycemia in rats. Accordingly, this drug is potentially a safer antidiabetic agent than sulfonylureas. To explore the mechanisms underlying this glucose-dependent insulinotropism, the present study investigated the effects of JTT-608 on cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and protein kinase A (PKA) activity in rat islet beta-cells by microfluorometry using, respectively, fura-2 and a fluorescence PKA substrate, DR II. In the presence of glucose at normal and elevated concentrations (5.0-16.7 mM) JTT-608 (30-1000 microM) concentration dependently increased [Ca(2+)](i) in up to 88% of single beta-cells, whereas at lower glucose concentrations (2.8 and 4.2 mM) it had little effect. The [Ca(2+)](i) responses were inhibited under Ca(2+)-free conditions and by nitrendipine, an L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker. JTT-608 rapidly activated PKA and a PKA inhibitor, H89, inhibited [Ca(2+)](i) responses to JTT-608. JTT-608 also stimulated insulin release from rat islets in a glucose- and Ca(2+)-dependent manner. The glucose-unresponsive beta-cells, which failed to respond to 8.3 mM glucose with increases in [Ca(2+)](i), were frequently recruited to [Ca(2+)](i) increases by JTT-608. JTT-608 also induced oscillations of [Ca(2+)](i). Glucagon-like peptide-1(7-36)amide (GLP-1), pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), and acetylcholine (ACh) enhanced the action of JTT-608 on [Ca(2+)](i). In conclusion, JTT-608 evokes PKA-mediated Ca(2+) influx and Ca(2+) signaling in rat islet beta-cells in a glucose-regulated manner, which may account for its glucose-dependent insulinotropism. JTT-608 and neurohormones may cooperatively activate islet beta-cells under physiological conditions.", 
    "83": "Acute lung injury is frequently associated with sepsis or blood loss and is characterized by a proinflammatory response and infiltration of activated neutrophils into the lungs. Hemorrhage or endotoxemia result in activation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and NF-kappa B in lung neutrophils as well as increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha and macrophage-inflammatory peptide-2, by these cells. Activation of the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) pathway occurs in stress responses and is involved in CREB activation. In the present experiments, hemorrhage or endotoxemia produced increased activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)1/2 and ERK2 (p42), but not of ERK1 (p44), in lung neutrophils. ERK1, ERK2, and MEK1/2 were not activated in peripheral blood neutrophils after hemorrhage or endotoxemia. Inhibition of xanthine oxidase led to further increase in the activation of MEK1/2 and ERK2 in lung neutrophils after hemorrhage, but not after endotoxemia. Alpha-adrenergic blockade before hemorrhage resulted in increased activation in lung neutrophils of MEK1/2, ERK1, ERK2, and CREB, but decreased activation of NF-kappa B. In contrast, alpha-adrenergic blockade before endotoxemia was associated with decreased activation of MEK1/2, ERK2, and CREB, but increased activation of NF-kappa B. Beta-adrenergic blockade before hemorrhage did not alter MEK1/2 or ERK1 activation in lung neutrophils, but decreased activation of ERK2 and CREB, while increasing activation of NF-kappa B. Beta-adrenergic inhibition before endotoxemia did not affect activation of MEK1/2, ERK1, ERK2, CREB, or NF-kappa B. These data indicate that the pathways leading to lung neutrophil activation after hemorrhage are different from those induced by endotoxemia.", 
    "84": "Mechanisms underlying the negative inotropic response to alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation in adult mouse ventricular myocardium were studied. In isolated ventricular tissue, phenylephrine (PE), in the presence of propranolol, decreased contractile force by approximately 40% of basal value. The negative inotropic response was similarly observed under low extracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](o)) conditions but was significantly smaller under high-[Ca(2+)](o) conditions and was not observed under low-[Na(+)](o) conditions. The negative inotropic response was not affected by nicardipine, ryanodine, ouabain, or dimethylamiloride (DMA), inhibitors of L-type Ca(2+) channel, Ca(2+) release channel, Na(+)-K(+) pump, or Na(+)/H(+) exchanger, respectively. KB-R7943, an inhibitor of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger, suppressed the negative inotropic response mediated by PE. PE reduced the magnitude of postrest contractions. PE caused a decrease in duration of the late plateau phase of action potential and a slight increase in resting membrane potential; time courses of these effects were similar to that of the negative inotropic effect. In whole cell voltage-clamped myocytes, PE increased the L-type Ca(2+) and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger currents but had no effect on the inwardly rectifying K(+), transient outward K(+), or Na(+)-K(+)-pump currents. These results suggest that the sustained negative inotropic response to alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation of adult mouse ventricular myocardium is mediated by enhancement of Ca(2+) efflux through the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger.", 
    "85": "Medical therapy reduces myocardial infarction and death in patients with stable coronary heart disease (CHD). In contrast, there is little evidence available to evaluate the impact of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on hard endpoints in such patients. Four randomized, controlled trials have compared PCI with medical therapy. These studies have demonstrated that PCI results in an improvement in angina and exercise tolerance compared with medical therapy, but they also suggest that medical therapy may be preferable to PCI with respect to the risk of cardiac events. Interpretation of these studies has been limited by small sample size, exclusion of high-risk subjects, no or reduced use of stents, lack of a cost- effectiveness evaluation, and absence of risk factor intervention (except for Atorvastatin versus Revascularization Treatment, which used aggressive low-density lipoprotein lowering with atorvastatin in the medical group only). The Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation (COURAGE) trial will permit better definition of the role of PCI in the treatment of stable or recently stabilized patients with CHD.",

    "89": "Case patients had a much higher intake of medications than control patients, respectively, 5.1 and 2. 8 medications per patient (P < 0.0001). Multivariate paired analysis showed an association between aphthous ulcers and two classes of drugs: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (P < 0.001) and beta-blockers (P = 0.002). Smoking could have a protective effect against aphthous ulcers (P < 0.001).", 
    "90": "Previous case reports and the results of this study suggest a real link between beta-blockers and aphthous ulcers. Our study did not confirm a role of other drugs but a few interesting case reports with positive reintroduction have to be considered.

    "91": "Human CYP3A4, the major human, intestinal, drug metabolizing cytochrome P450, has been introduced into three mammalian cell lines (Caco-2, MDCK and LLC-PK1) suitable for making drug permeability measurements. The levels and stability of expression were analyzed by enzyme assays (testosterone 6beta-hydroxylase and nifedipine oxidase). Long term, stable CYP3A4 expression/cell growth rate was obtained in MDCK cells. In the LLC-PK1 system, shorter term, stable expression was achieved. However, in Caco-2 cells, derivatives with better properties than those previously reported could not be obtained. The highest level of CYP3A4 catalytic activity was obtained in LLC-PK1 cells. In this system, CYP3A4 activity levels appeared comparable to median level human intestinal microsomes. Metabolite formation and inhibition kinetics were examined in cell monolayers. Nifedipine was found to be extensively metabolized (19%) during passage across cell monolayers. In general, affinity related parameters (apparent Km and apparent Ki) were 1.5- to three-fold higher under conditions of flux through the monolayers relative to steady-state conditions. These systems should be useful for examining the role of intestinal CYP3A4 in first-pass metabolism and drug-drug interactions.",

In addition, the hydrogen bond donor patterns (type I and type II) relevant for substrate recognition by P-glycoprotein were determined from the energy-minimized three-dimensional structure of these compounds. A linear relation between the air-water partition coefficient, K(aw), and the inverse of the Michaelis-Menten constant, K(m), was observed such that K(m) x K(aw) approximately = 1. The maximal velocity, V(max), was shown to decrease with the number and strength of electron donor (hydrogen bond acceptor) groups in recognition patterns. If two substrates are applied simultaneously to P-glycoprotein the compound with the higher potential to form hydrogen bonds generally acts as an inhibitor. We conclude that partitioning into the lipid membrane is the rate-limiting step for the interaction of a substrate with P-glycoprotein and that dissociation of the P-glycoprotein-substrate complex is determined by the number and strength of the hydrogen bonds formed between the substrate and the transporter.", 
    "93": "beta-Adrenoceptors of the beta1 and beta2 subtypes classically mediate the effects of catecholamines on the contractility of cardiac muscle and the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Since the molecular characterization of the beta3-adrenoceptor in 1989, most studies of this adrenoceptor subtype have focused on its control of lipolysis in adipose tissues. However, more recent studies have investigated the involvement of beta3-adrenoceptors in the physiological control of cardiac and vascular contractility. In this article, the pharmacological and molecular evidence that supports the functional role of beta3-adrenoceptors in cardiovasculartissues of various species, including humans, will be discussed. These data might provide new insights into our understanding of the abnormal responsiveness of the cardiovascular system to catecholamines in heart failure and its treatment with beta3-adrenoceptor antagonists.", 
    "94": "The effect of acupuncture-like stimulation of various areas (cheek, forepaw, upper arm, chest, back, lower leg, hindpaw, perineum) on cortical cerebral blood flow (CBF) was examined in anesthetized rats. An acupuncture needle (diameter, 340 microm) was inserted into the skin and underlying muscles at a depth of about 5 mm and twisted to the right and left once a second for 1 min. CBF of the cortex was measured using a laser Doppler flowmeter. Stimulation of the cheek, forepaw, upper arm and hindpaw produced significant increases in CBF, but stimulation of the chest, back, lower leg and perineum did not produce significant responses. Stimulation of the cheek, forepaw, and hindpaw produced an increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP), while stimulation of the back produced a decrease in MAP. Stimulation of the upper arm, chest, lower leg and perineum did not produce a significant MAP response. After spinal transection at the 1st to 2nd thoracic level, the blood pressure response to stimulation of the cheek and forepaw was suppressed, whereas an increase in CBF still took place. The increase in CBF induced by forepaw stimulation was abolished by severance of the somatic nerves at the brachial plexus. Forepaw stimulation enhanced the activity of the radial, ulnar and median nerves. Furthermore, in the present study, passing of an electric current through acupuncture needles showed that excitation of group III (Adelta) and group IV (C) afferent fibers in the somatic nerve was capable of producing an increase in CBF, whereas excitation of group I (Aalpha) and group II (Abeta) fibers was ineffective. The increase in CBF induced by forepaw stimulation was almost abolished by intravenous administration of muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic blocking agents (atropine 5 mg/kg and mecamylamine 20 mg/kg), and by bilateral lesions in the nucleus basalis of Meynert. Acupuncture-like stimulation of a forepaw increased acetylcholine release in the cerebral cortex. We concluded that the increase in CBF, independent of systemic blood pressure, elicited by acupuncture stimulation is a reflex response in which the afferent nerve pathway is composed of somatic group III and IV afferent nerves, and efferent nerve pathway includes intrinsic cholinergic vasodilators originating in the nucleus basalis of Meynert.", 
    "95": "We studied whether the beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol (ISO), regulates Na,K-ATPase in alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) via a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signaling related kinase (ERK) dependent pathway. ISO increased ERK activity in AEC by 10 min via a beta-adrenergic receptor, protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent mechanism. Activation of the MAPK pathway by ISO, resulted in increased Na,K-ATPase beta1 and alpha1 subunit protein abundance in whole cell lysates, which resulted in functional Na, K-ATPases at the basolateral membranes. ISO did not change the alpha1 or beta1 mRNA steady state levels, but rapamycin, the inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, also blocked the ISO-mediated increase in Na,K-ATPase total protein abundance, suggesting a posttranscriptional regulation. We conclude that ISO, regulates the Na,K-ATPase in AEC via PKA, ERK and rapamycin-sensitive mechanisms.", 
    "96": "The effect of the thiazolidinediones (TZDs) darglitazone and troglitazone on beta3-adrenergic receptor (AR) expression was studied in cultured cell lines representing several tissues. After 24 h of exposing HIB-1B brown adipocytes to 30 micromol/l darglitazone or 20 micromol/l troglitazone, beta3-AR mRNA levels were reduced by 75%. This effect was significant within 1 h of exposure to a maximal dose of these drugs, with the full effect obtained within 10 h. The darglitazone ID50 was approximately 10 nmol/l, similar to the Kd of TZDs binding to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma). These drugs also decreased beta3-AR mRNA in 3T3-F442A white adipocytes, but not in SK-N-MC cells, which lack PPAR-gamma2. A luciferase reporter gene containing 1.4 kb of 5' flanking sequence of the mouse beta3-AR was transiently transfected, with or without PPAR-gamma2, in SK-N-MC cells. The vigorous expression of luciferase driven by the beta3-AR gene sequence was inhibited by TZDs in a PPAR-gamma2-dependent manner. The half-lives of gamma3-AR precursor RNA and mRNA were short, approximately 40 and approximately 100 min, respectively, and remained unaffected by TZD treatment. Exposure of HIB-1B cells to 30 micromol/l darglitazone was associated with reduced beta3-AR mRNA levels, as well as decreased response of uncoupling protein 1 to norepinephrine + propranolol (a beta1 beta2-AR antagonist) or the specific beta3-AR agonist CL 316, 243. Both the beta3-AR mRNA level and response to these stimuli fully recovered by 24 h of removing the drug, indicating that the beta3-AR protein and its coupling to adenylyl cyclase rapidly followed the changes in mRNA. Thus, TZDs can rapidly reduce beta3-AR expression at the transcriptional level, acting through PPAR-gamma2. The rapid turnover and responses of beta3-AR to perturbations, along with numerous other factors reported to regulate its expression, suggest a tight control of beta3-AR and function. Lastly, leptin being the only other known gene suppressed by TZDs, the present studies support a concerted lipogenic effect of these drugs.", 
    "97": "Hyperadrenergic states of various etiologies can contribute to tachycardias. Systemic beta-adrenergic blockade suppresses sinus tachycardia but may adversely affect arterial blood pressure and contractility, because the drug gains access to myocardial cells as well as to the sinoatrial node. We examined whether intrapericardial beta-adrenergic blockade with esmolol could suppress tachycardia without reducing contractility as a result of limited drug diffusion, which would be sufficient to penetrate the superficial sinoatrial node but not the deeper myocardial layers. In five anesthetized pigs, we provoked a reflex heart rate increase of 50 beats/min with hemorrhage. The rapidly acting beta-adrenergic blocking agent esmolol (1 mg/kg) was administered intrapericardially using a new percutaneous transatrial access method and a catheter system that can be rapidly and safely introduced. Esmolol equivalently suppressed hemorrhage-induced sinus tachycardia when administered intrapericardially (from 192 to 158 beats/min at 5 min, p < 0.05) or intravenously (from 177 to 151 beats/min at 1 min, p < 0.05). The antitachycardic effect of intrapericardial esmolol was prolonged compared with intravenous esmolol (10 min vs. 3 min, p < 0.05). Intrapericardial esmolol did not affect blood pressure or left ventricular dP/dt max, an index of contractility, whereas intravenous esmolol decreased blood pressure at 1 min for 2 min (p < 0.05) and simultaneously decreased left ventricular dP/dt max at 1 min for < 2 min (p < 0.05). Intrapericardial esmolol suppresses adrenergically induced sinus tachycardia without decreasing contractility or blood pressure. The transatrial approach for intrapericardial delivery of certain 1-adrenergic blocking agents could be employed to control tachycardias in emergency care and surgical settings in patients with impaired cardiac contractility and propensity to hypotension.",

    "102": "Cellobiohydrolase Cel7A (previously called CBH 1), the major cellulase produced by the mould fungus Trichoderma reesei, has been successfully exploited as a chiral selector for separation of stereo-isomers of some important pharmaceutical compounds, e.g. adrenergic beta-blockers. Previous investigations, including experiments with catalytically deficient mutants of Cel7A, point unanimously to the active site as being responsible for discrimination of enantiomers. In this work the structural basis for enantioselectivity of basic drugs by Cel7A has been studied by X-ray crystallography. The catalytic domain of Cel7A was co-crystallised with the (S)-enantiomer of a common beta-blocker, propranolol, at pH 7, and the structure of the complex was determined and refined at 1. 9 A resolution. Indeed, (S)-propranolol binds at the active site, in glucosyl-binding subsites -1/+1. The catalytic residues Glu212 and Glu217 make tight salt links with the secondary amino group of (S)-propranolol. The oxygen atom attached to the chiral centre of (S)-propranolol forms hydrogen bonds to the nucleophile Glu212 O(epsilon1) and to Gln175 N(epsilon2), whereas the aromatic naphthyl moiety stacks with the indole ring of Trp376 in site +1. The bidentate charge interaction with the catalytic glutamate residues is apparently crucial, since no enantioselectivity has been obtained with the catalytically deficient mutants E212Q and E217Q. Activity inhibition experiments with wild-type Cel7A were performed in conditions close to those used for crystallisation. Competitive inhibition constants for (R)- and (S)-propranolol were determined at 220 microM and 44 microM, respectively, corresponding to binding free energies of 20 kJ/mol and 24 kJ/mol, respectively. The K(i) value for (R)-propranolol was 57-fold lower than the highest concentration, 12.5 mM, used in co-crystallisation experiments. Still several attempts to obtain a complex with the (R)-enantiomer have failed. By using cellobiose as a selective competing ligand, the retention of the enantiomers of propranolol on the chiral stationary phase (CSP) based on Cel7A mutant D214N were resolved into enantioselective and non- selective binding. The enantioselective binding was weaker for both enantiomers on D214N-CSP than on wild-type-CSP.", 
    "103": "The goals of heart failure therapy have shifted from purely hemodynamic manipulation to a combination of hemodynamic and neurohumoral modulation. Vasodilators with neurohumoral modulatory properties [such as ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and third generation beta-blockers] have become the cornerstone of chronic heart failure therapy. These newer agents have proven to improve morbidity and mortality in adults with chronic heart failure. Pure vasodilators still have a place in the treatment of acute decompensated heart failure and in patients who are intolerant to ACEi or beta-blocker therapy. In decompensated heart failure management, improvement of cardiac output is of paramount importance and restoration of normal hemodynamics takes priority over modulation of cardiac maladaptation. Under these circumstances agents that improve contractility and modify cardiac preload and afterload are used. In the intensive care unit setting inodilators offer the advantage of an added positive inotropic effect. NO donors play an important role when close titration of blood pressure is also needed. It is the purpose of this manuscript to address principles and current practice regarding the use of vasodilators in pediatric heart failure. ACE inhibitors and third generation beta-blockers due to their importance in today's therapeutic approach to heart failure are the focus of more detailed articles in this issue of Progress in Pediatric Cardiology.", 
    "104": "Important new studies relevant to the field of heart failure reported at the annual congress of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), held in Amsterdam in August 2000, are reviewed. The IMPROVEMENT of Heart Failure survey investigated the knowledge and perceptions of over 1300 primary care physicians from 14 ESC member nations and the actual practice in over 11000 of their patients. Guidelines and clinical practice were compared. The survey suggested, in this large sample, that the quality of care was higher than previous smaller surveys have suggested but have also identified important deficiencies in knowledge and management that should be rectified. The COPERNICUS study demonstrated that carvedilol was remarkably well tolerated even in patients with very severe heart failure and that treatment was associated with a substantial reduction in mortality even among patients that would conventionally not be considered, by many, for beta-blocker therapy. The MUSTIC trial suggested that cardiac resynchronisation using biventricular pacing improved patients symptomatically whether or not the patient was in atrial fibrillation. Morbidity and mortality studies of cardiac resynchronisation are now underway. The ASPECT-II and APRICOT-II studies investigated the role of warfarin, aspirin and their combination for the long-term management of myocardial infarction. One interpretation of the data from these studies is that the combination of aspirin and warfarin is about as effective as warfarin alone but with a much higher incidence of side effects. Warfarin alone appeared superior to aspirin alone. In summary, the annual congress of the ESC provided important new information for clinical practice and, to date, was, by far, the most important cardiology congress in the world this year.",

The role of purinoceptors in the coronary microcirculation in vivo was also investigated. In open chest dogs, coronary arterioles were observed using a microscope with a floating objective. In Protocol 1, AP4A (1, 10, 100 and 1,000 micromol/L) was superfused onto the heart surface before and during the superfusion of 10 micromol/L of 8-phenyltheophylline (8-PT), a P1 purinoceptor blocker. In Protocol 2, AP4A (0.1, 1, 10, and 100 nmol x kg(-1) x min(-1)) was infused into the left anterior descending coronary artery before and during the superfusion of 10 micromol/L of 8-PT. In addition to 8-PT, 30 micromol/L of pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl 2',4'-disulphonic acid (PPADS), a P2X purinoceptor blocker in Protocol 3, or 300 micromol/L of N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine (LNNA) in Protocol 4, was continuously superfused, and 4 doses of AP4A were cumulatively superfused as in Protocol 1. In Protocol 5, 10 micromol/L of alpha,beta-methylene ATP, an agonist of P2X purinoceptors, was superfused for 60 min. Superfused AP4A dilated arterioles in a dose-dependent manner. The magnitude of dilatation was greater in smaller arterioles (small vessel < or = 150 microm: 24.5+/-2.2% vs large vessel > 150 microm: 10.6+/-1.5% at a dose of 1,000 micromol/L, p<0.001). On the other hand, intraluminally applied AP4A also dilated arterioles, but no size dependency was shown. In the presence of 8-PT, vasodilatory responses to superfused and intraluminally applied AP4A were attenuated and the lower doses of AP4A constricted arterioles. This vasoconstrictor effect was not affected by PPADS. The vasodilatory effect of the higher doses of AP4A was almost abolished in the presence of LNNA. Alpha,beta-methylene ATP had no effect on coronary microvascular diameters. AP4A has bidirectional effects on coronary arterial microvessels: vasodilatory effects mediated by P1 purinoceptors and NO, which might be mediated by P2Y purinoceptors, and a vasoconstrictor effect, which is not mediated by P2X purinoceptors.", 
    "120": "Heart rate (HR) response during exercise in patients with ischemic heart disease was evaluated, and the appropriateness of Karvonen's method for determining rehabilitation exercise target HR was investigated. The study group comprised 24 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and 37 patients who had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) was performed with a cycle ergometer and changes in HR (deltaHR)/changes in work rate (deltaWR) and interval changes of the coefficient of Karvonen's formula were evaluated. In the AMI group and the CABG group, deltaHR/deltaWR were significantly lower than those of age-matched control subjects (p<0.01). Karvonen's coefficients ranged from 0.37 to 0.54 when calculated from actual peak HR and 0.21 to 0.32 calculated from the predicted peak HR. An impaired HR response was found in patients with AMI and those who had had CABG up to 6 months previously. Because the Karvonen's coefficient values, which ranged from 0.6 to 0.8, were elevated for these patients, and considering the data from the CPX, increased exercise is recommended for such cases.", 
    "121": "The present study was undertaken to examine sympathetic-parasympathetic interactions in the regulation of salivary gland function, with special reference to the possible role of the sympathetic cotransmitter neuropeptide Y (NPY). In dogs anaesthetised with pentobarbitone, electrical stimulation of the parasympathetic nerve to the submandibular gland evoked an increase in glandular blood flow and salivary secretion. Sympathetic nerve stimulation evoked a significant prolonged attenuation of vasodilator and secretory responses to subsequent parasympathetic stimulation. This attenuation was not significantly altered by alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Systemic administration of the sympathetic cotransmitter, NPY, mimicked the effect of the sympathetic stimulation by significantly attenuating vasodilatation and salivary secretion. The NPY Y1 receptor agonist, [Leu31, Pro34]NPY and the specific NPY Y2 receptor agonist N-acetyl[Leu28, Leu31]NPY 24-36 both significantly attenuated the vasodilatation and salivary secretion evoked by stimulation of the parasympathetic nerve. The NPY Y1 receptor antagonist, GR231118 significantly antagonised the attenuation of vasodilatation caused by both sympathetic stimulation and the NPY Y1 receptor agonist. GR231118 also inhibited the pressor response of NPY. Intra-arterial injection of methacholine and stimulation of the parasympathetic nerve both caused local vasodilatation in the gland which was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with sympathetic stimulation or the NPY Y1 agonist. The NPY Y2-specific agonist did not attenuate methacholine-induced vasodilatation but did attenuate vasodilatation evoked by parasympathetic stimulation. The results indicate that NPY as a sympathetic cotransmitter may have a role in the regulation of vascular secretory function of salivary glands.", 
    "122": "Polymeric films containing propranolol hydrochloride (PPN) were formulated and evaluated with a view to select a suitable formulation for the development of transdermal drug delivery systems. Films containing different ratios of ethyl cellulose (EC), poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP), and PPN were prepared by mercury substrate method. In vitro drug release and skin permeation studies were conducted using paddle over disk and modified Franz diffusion cell, respectively. The drug release profiles from the polymeric film indicated that the drug content in the film decreased at an apparent first-order rate, whereas the quantity of drug release was proportional to the square root of time. The release rate of PPN increased linearly with increasing drug concentration and PVP fraction in the film, but was found to be independent of film thickness. The increase in release rate may be due to leaching of hydrophilic fraction of the film former, which resulted in the formation of pores. It was also observed that the release of drug from the films followed the diffusion-controlled model at low drug concentration. A burst effect was observed initially, however, at high drug loading level, which may be due to rapid dissolution of the surface drug followed by the diffusion of the drug through the polymer network in the film. The in vitro skin permeation profiles displayed increased flux values with increase of initial drug concentration in the film, and also with the PVP content. From this study, it is concluded that the films composed of EC/PVP/PPN, 9:1:3, 8:2:2, and 8:2:3, should be selected for the development of transdermal drug delivery systems using a suitable adhesive layer and backing membrane for potential therapeutic applications.", 
    "123": "Adenosine has cardioprotective effects against ischemia, and newborn hearts show high resistance to ischemia. The effects of purinoceptor stimulation by adenosine and ATP on the L-type Ca2+ current (ICa) were examined in atrial cells from neonate and adult rabbits. ICa was measured by the membrane-perforated patch method. Adenosine inhibited the isoproterenol-stimulated ICa more potently in neonate cells than in adult cells. The high sensitivity of neonate myocytes to adenosine was accompanied not only by an increased maximum response but also by a lower IC50 concentration. ATP also inhibited isoproterenol-stimulated ICa. The effect of ATP on neonate cells was stronger than that on adult cells at high concentrations (greater than or = 100 microM). The effect of adenosine was antagonized by an A1 adenosine receptor antagonist, 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX). DPCPX or an ecto-5'-nucleosidase inhibitor (alpha,beta-methylene-ADP) blocked most (approximately 60%) of the effect of ATP (30 microM), and co-addition of DPCPX and suramin (P2 receptor blocker) abolished the effect of ATP. Suramin alone did not reduce the effect of ATP significantly in neonate cells. Both the effects of adenosine and ATP were eliminated by pre-treatment with pertussis toxin or by superfusion with forskolin plus 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). Inhibitors of the nitric oxide-cyclic GMP pathway did not affect the adenosine inhibition of ICa. In summary, neonatal myocardial cells are highly sensitive to adenosine A1 receptor stimulation. ATP stimulates both the adenosine A1 and P2 receptors. Adenosine A1 receptor stimulation, as a result of hydrolysis of ATP, predominantly mediates the effect of ATP, and the role of P2 receptors in the ATP inhibition of ICa is relatively small in neonate cells. The high sensitivity to adenosine may contribute to the ischemic tolerance of newborn hearts.", 
    "124": "Endothelial dysfunction and effectiveness of treatment of calcium antagonists are suggestive of coronary artery spasm as an underlying disorder in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The aim of this study is to determine whether or not the epicardial coronary artery spasm can induce severe cardiac dysfunction like DCM. Thirty-four consecutive patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries and diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis whose causes had been unknown underwent acetylcholine provocation test and left ventricular biopsy. Eight patients were excluded according to the clinical and laboratory data and biopsy findings suggesting myocarditis or other systemic diseases. According to the results of the acetylcholine provocation test, 17 patients were finally diagnosed as having DCM, and nine patients (35% of the study patients), who had acetylcholine-induced diffuse and multivessel coronary spasm, were diagnosed as having DCM-like vasospastic angina pectoris (VSA). Clinical and cardiac catheterization data including hemodynamics and biopsy findings were similar between the two groups except that left ventricular end-systolic volume was significantly greater in DCM than in DCM-like VSA. After the acetylcholine provocation test, DCM patients received both a beta blocker and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and DCM-like VSA patients received antianginal drugs. In echocardiographic findings at predischarge and those after 6-month drug treatment, both DCM-lke VSA and DCM showed significant reduction in end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters and significant increase in fractional shortening and ejection fraction, whereas changes in ejection fraction and fractional shortening were significantly greater in DCM-like VSA than those in DCM. Epicardial coronary artery spasm can induce diffuse and severe left ventricular dysfunction like DCM in VSA. Although antianginal drugs markedly improve left ventricular function of these patients, only the acetylcholine provocation test can identify DCM-like VSA.", 
    "125": "The role of adrenergic stimulation in the regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in rat pinealocytes was investigated by measuring phosphorylated MAPK using Western blot analysis and a MAPK enzymatic assay. Stimulation with the endogenous neurotransmitter, norepinephrine (NE; a mixed alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonist), concentration dependently increased the phosphorylation of both p44 and p42 isoforms of MAPK. This effect of NE was blocked by PD98059 and U0126 (two inhibitors of MEK). Treatment with prazosin or propranolol significantly reduced the effect of NE on MAPK phosphorylation, suggesting the involvement of both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors. Investigation into the intracellular mechanisms of NE action revealed that the increase in MAPK phosphorylation was blocked by KT5823 (a protein kinase G inhibitor), but was enhanced by H89 (a protein kinase A inhibitor). Calphostin C (a protein kinase C inhibitor) and KN93 (a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase inhibitor) also attenuated NE-mediated MAPK activation, but to a lesser degree. Furthermore, inhibition of MAPK phosphorylation by (Bu)2cAMP was effective in reducing MAPK activation by (Bu)2cGMP, an active phorbol ester or ionomycin. These results indicate that the effect of NE on MAPK phosphorylation represents mainly the integration of two signaling mechanisms, protein kinase A and protein kinase G, each having an opposite effect on MAPK phosphorylation.", 
    "126": "To investigate the molecular mechanism(s) of action of catecholamines on the expression of the angiotensinogen (ANG) gene in kidney proximal tubular cells, we used opossum kidney (OK) cells with a fusion gene containing the 5'-flanking regulatory sequence of the rat ANG gene fused with a human growth hormone (hGH) gene as a reporter, pOGH (rANG N-1498/+18), permanently integrated into their genomes. The level of expression of the ANG-GH fusion gene was quantified by the amount of immunoreactive-hGH (IR-hGH) secreted into the medium. The addition of norepinephrine (NE), isoproterenol (a beta1/beta2-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonist) and iodoclonidine (an alpha2-AR agonist) stimulated the expression of the ANG-GH fusion gene in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the addition of epinephrine and phenylephrine (alpha1-AR agonist) had no effect. The stimulatory effect of NE was blocked by the presence of propranolol (beta-AR blocker), atenolol (beta1-AR blocker), yohimbine (alpha2-AR blocker), Rp-cAMP (an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase AI & AII) and staurosporine (an inhibitor of protein kinase C), but was not blocked by ICI 118, 551 (beta2-AR blocker) and prazosin (alpha1-AR blocker). The addition of a combination of isoproterenol and iodoclonidine or a combination of 8-Bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP) and phorbol 12-myristate (PMA) synergistically stimulated the expression of the ANG-GH fusion gene as compared to the addition of isoproterenol, iodoclonidine, 8-Br-cAMP or PMA alone. Furthermore, the addition of NE, 8-Br-cAMP or PMA stimulated the expression of pOGH (rANG N-806/-779/-53/+18), a fusion gene containing the putative cAMP responsive element (CRE, ANG N-806/-779) upstream of the ANG promoter (ANG N-53/+18) in OK cells, but had no effect on the expression of fusion genes containing the mutant of the CRE. Gel mobility shift assays revealed that the ANG-CRE binds with the DNA-binding domain (bZIP254-327) of the cAMP-responsive binding protein (CREB). The binding of the labeled ANG-CRE to CREB (bZIP254-327) was displaced by unlabeled ANG-CRE and the CRE of the somatostatin gene but not by the mutants of the ANG-CRE. Finally, NE stimulated the phosphorylation of CREB in OK cells. These studies demonstrate that the molecular mechanism(s) of NE action on the expression of the ANG gene in OK cells may be mediated via both the PKA and PKC signalling pathways and via the phosphorylation of CREB. The phosphorylated CREB then interacts with the CRE in the 5'-flanking region of the ANG gene and subsequently stimulates the gene expression.", 
    "127": "The goal was to assess whether salmeterol, a potent and long-acting beta-2-adrenergic agonist used in the treatment of asthma, also has non-beta-2-adrenergic effects on the stimulation or inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity. Salmeterol (100 nM) maximally stimulated cAMP accumulation in enzyme dispersed bovine trachealis cells and this was entirely inhibited by propranolol, as expected for beta-adrenergic stimulation. However, the same concentration of salmeterol also antagonized carbachol inhibition of cAMP accumulation and altered binding of carbachol to muscarinic receptors. These effects of salmeterol were sensitive to washing of the cells and this was not consistent with a beta-2-adrenergic mechanism. The findings suggested that the maximal, beta-2-adrenergic stimulation of cAMP accumulation by salmeterol was accompanied by a non-beta-2-adrenergic interaction of salmeterol with muscarinic receptors that attenuated muscarinic inhibition of adenylyl cyclase.",

Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the cost-effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy would always be less than $11,000 per QALY gained, even under unfavorable assumptions, and may even be cost saving.

Age, weight, number of palliative operations, plasma renin activities and pulmonary to systemic flow ratios (3.5 vs. 3.5) were not significantly different prior to Captopril or Propranolol therapy.

In the present study, the NR8383 rat alveolar macrophage cell line was used to further investigate the priming effect of H(2)O(2). Using nitroblue tetrazolium, which formed an insoluble formazan when reduced by superoxide, modulation of the respiratory burst was visualized in a cell population exposed to a concentration gradient of H(2)O(2) before stimulation. This model system illustrates how H(2)O(2) may constitute a signaling molecule for a feed-forward regulation of the respiratory burst during inflammation. n-Butanol, which allows consumption of phosphatidic acid by the transphosphatidylation reaction, and propanolol, which inhibits phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase, were used to investigate the possible involvement of phospholipase D in this phenomenon. These two agents were found to inhibit the basal adenosine diphosphate-stimulated respiratory burst. Inhibition of the H(2)O(2)-enhanced respiratory burst was equally or slightly less effective when expressed as percentage of controls. Furthermore, phospholipase D was not activated by H(2)O(2) concentrations that enhance superoxide production. Thus, phospholipase D does not mediate the enhancement of the respiratory burst by H(2)O(2), although it may be activated by high concentrations of this hydroperoxide.",

A qualitative study among 12 family physicians was conducted with a combination of written case simulations, semi-structured interviews and statements on attitudes of physicians towards antihypertensive drug choice. Among the male hypertensive cases the most frequently prescribed drugs were beta-blockers, whereas among the female hypertensive cases diuretics were more often prescribed. Physician characteristics associated with a preferred prescribing of beta-blockers to hypertensive men and diuretics to hypertensive women were: older age (no residency in family medicine), the believe that beta-blockers are more effective in men with regard to lowering blood pressure and that diuretics are more effective in women, a non-evidence based attitude and a sex-related attitude towards the choice of beta-blockers and diuretics in general, and in particular towards the prescribing of beta-blockers to hypertensive men because men have a higher absolute risk of coronary heart disease than women. An additional explanation for these findings may be the higher prevalence of ankle oedema among women. Patient characteristics associated with more prescribing of beta-blockers to hypertensive men and diuretics to hypertensive women were: current employment and a \"high-risk\" profile in terms of blood pressure level and additional cardiovascular risk factors. Although, most considerations underlying a preferred prescribing of beta-blockers to hypertensive men and diuretics to hypertensive women were not evidence-based, the actual choice of antihypertensive drug (diuretic or beta-blocker) was evidence-based. These considerations may also play a role in the sex difference in the choice of calcium antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and require further investigation.",

    "141": "We determined the three-dimensional structure of omega-conotoxin TxVII, a 26-residue peptide that is an L-type calcium channel blocker, by (1)H NMR in aqueous solution. Twenty converged structures of this peptide were obtained on the basis of 411 distance constraints obtained from nuclear Overhauser effect connectivities, 20 torsion angle constraints, and 21 constraints associated with hydrogen bonds and disulfide bonds. The root-mean-square deviations about the averaged coordinates of the backbone atoms (N, C(alpha), C, and O) and all heavy atoms were 0.50 +/- 0.09 A and 0.99 +/- 0.13 A, respectively. The structure of omega-conotoxin TxVII is composed of a triple-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet and four turns. The three disulfide bonds in omega-conotoxin TxVII form the classical cystine knot motif of toxic or inhibitory polypeptides. The overall folding of omega-conotoxin TxVII is similar to those of the N-type calcium channel blockers, omega-conotoxin GVIA and MVIIA, despite the low amino acid sequence homology among them. omega-Conotoxin TxVII exposes many hydrophobic residues to a certain surface area. In contrast, omega-conotoxin GVIA and MVIIA expose basic residues in the same way as omega-conotoxin TxVII. The channel binding site of omega-conotoxin TxVII is different from those of omega-conotoxin GVIA and MVIIA, although the overall folding of these three peptides is similar. The gathered hydrophobic residues of omega-conotoxin TxVII probably interact with the hydrophobic cluster of the alpha(1) subunit of the L-type calcium channel, which consists of 13 residues located in segments 5 and 6 in domain III and in segment 6 in domain IV.", 
    "142": "Survival improvement by beta-blocker treatment in patients with chronic heart failure appears to be related to the intermediate-term changes in left ventricular function. The therapeutic potential of beta blockade might be increased by early identification of patients in whom left ventricular function would deteriorate. We aimed at predicting the intermediate-term effect of bisoprolol on left ventricular systolic and diastolic function in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Twenty-five patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure treated with bisoprolol were investigated. As a background, tailored therapy with digitalis, diuretics and vasodilators was given. Prediction of the 6-month (intermediate-term) effect of bisoprolol was investigated, using baseline values and short-term (1-month) changes of simple, noninvasive parameters obtained at rest and during maximal exercise. Multivariate analysis resulted in reliable predictions, there was close correlation between the observed and predicted changes of left atrial filling pressure (R = 0.87) and left ventricular ejection fraction (R = 0.74). The baseline value of left ventricular ejection fraction, short-term changes of the pulse amplitude and the double product proved independent predictors of intermediate-term changes of left ventricular ejection fraction. The baseline value of mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, heart rate, and increase in heart rate during maximal exercise were predictors of the intermediate-term changes in mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. In dilated cardiomyopathy, the intermediate-term effects of bisoprolol on left ventricular ejection fraction and mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure can be predicted reliably by simple noninvasive variables in the early treatment phase.",

Forty-eight patients with stable angina pectoris were investigated (doubleblind, randomized, parallel grouped) comparing the hemodynamic, antiischemic, metabolic and neurohumoral effects of tedisamil 100 mg b.i.d. and atenolol 50 mg b.i.d. after a single dose and over 6 days of treatment. Tedisamil and atenolol produced a decrease in heart rate both at rest [day 1:-13.6 versus - 15.4 bpm; day 6: - 14.8 versus - 22.2 bpm, resp.; p > 0.05] and exercise [day 1: - 9.1 versus - 18.3 bpm; p = 0.001; day 6: - 12.0 versus - 24.8 bpm, resp.; p = 0.001], while anginal threshold increased.

Right atrial pressure changed during exercise only: it decreased with tedisamil (-1.7 mmHg) and increased with atenolol (+ 3.7 mmHg) (p < .001). Mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressures decreased both at rest (- 0.5 mmHg) and exercise (- 6.9 mmHg) in the tedisamil group but tended to increase with atenolol on day 6 of treatment [rest: + 1.7; exercise: + 3.7 mmHg) (p = 0.03). Arterial pressure decreased under atenolol treatment only. Exercise-induced plasma norepinephrine levels were reduced by tedisamil (- 93 pg/ml) but elevated by atenolol (+ 172 pg/ml) (p = 0.001). As compared to atenolol, tedisamil produced a prolongation of QTc interval [+ 31 versus 8 ms] at initial values of 0.408 +/- 0.018 s with PQ and QRS remaining unaltered. In patients with stable angina, tedisamil (100 mg b.i.d.) as compared to atenolol (50 mg b.i.d.) generated similar hemodynamic, neurohumoral and antiischemic effects. The antiischemic efficacy of tedisamil, as measured by ST segment depression and angina threshold, was comparable to that of atenolol.",

The data are consistent with the previous observation that the maximal stimulation of PKA by cyclic AMP is reduced without a change in the EC(50) value. The blunted beta adrenoceptor-mediated PKA response in fibroblasts from patients with major depression is reflected in a significant reduction in the isoproterenol-stimulated phosphorylation of the nuclear transcription factor CREB. Both, the isoproterenol-mediated phosphorylation of nuclear CREB and the activation of the stably transfected luciferase reporter gene, pAD neo2-C12-BGL, were inhibited by the beta(2) adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118551, thus indicating that the gene activating action of isoproterenol in human fibroblasts is mediated via the beta(2) adrenoceptor cascade. The low EC(50) value of 1 nM isoproterenol for activation of gene expression in stably transfected human fibroblasts appears to be a reflection of the amplification mechanism occurring via the beta adrenoceptor-cyclic AMP-PKA-CREB transduction cascade.",

The ATP-activated Ca(2+) change was biphasic, with a fast release from intracellular stores and a delayed influx across the plasma membrane. A prolonged exposure to ATP was toxic to dendritic cells that swelled, lost typical dendrites, became phase lucent, detached from the substrate, and eventually died. These changes were highly suggestive of expression of the cytotoxic receptor P2X(7), as confirmed by ability of dendritic cells to become permeant to membrane impermeant dyes such as Lucifer yellow or ethidium bromide. The P2X(7) receptor ligand 2',3'-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP was a better agonist then ATP for Ca(2+) increase and plasma membrane depolarization. Oxidized ATP, a covalent blocker of P2X receptors, and the selective P2X(7) antagonist KN-62 inhibited both permeabilization and Ca(2+) changes induced by ATP. The following purinoceptors were expressed by immature and mature dendritic cells: P2Y(1), P2Y(2), P2Y(5), P2Y(11) and P2X(1), P2X(4), P2X(7). Finally, stimulation of LPS-matured cells with ATP triggered release of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha. Purinoceptors may provide a new avenue to modulation of dendritic cells function.",

Extracellular ATP induced an increase in [Ca2+]i in VGCs in a dose-dependent manner. ATP induced an increase in [Ca2+]i even in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (1 mM Ethylene Glycol-bis (beta-aminoethyl Ether) N,N,N',N'-Tetraacetic Acid (EGTA)), thus suggesting that ATP induces Ca2+ release from the intracellular stores. The P2-receptor antagonists suramin and reactive blue 2 inhibited the ATP-induced [Ca2+]i increase in a dose-dependent manner. The P1-receptor agonist adenosine did not induce any changes in [Ca2+]i. These results suggest that VGCs may possess a P2-purinergic receptor but not a P1-purinergic receptor. La3+, a receptor-mediated calcium channel blocker, inhibited the ATP-induced [Ca2+]i increase but, in contrast, nifedipine, a L-type calcium channel blocker, did not. These results suggest that ATP induces both a Ca2+ -release from the intracellular stores and a Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space through La3+ -sensitive and nifedipine-insensitive Ca2+ channels in VGCs. Our results also suggest that extracellular ATP may act as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator of the vestibular peripheral system in the guinea pig.",

Although a single injection of 350 microl of saline (equivalent to approx. 70 ml in humans, 1 ml/kg of body weight) did not have an effect on the leukocyte counts in long-term intravenously cannulated, freely behaving rats, a single injection of 750 microl of saline (equivalent to approx. 150 ml in humans, 2.1 ml/kg) induced rapid leukocytosis of 160% within 1 minute followed by a gradual increase up to 180% after 1 hour. Measurement of serum norepinephrine concentration revealed a significant increase in rats of the hypervolemic group, compared with those of the low volume group. Pretreatment with either the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist nadolol or the selective alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine prevented both leukocyte peaks in the high volume group, suggesting a combined receptor activation. This critical dependence of leukocyte counts on changes in blood volume should be taken into consideration in experiments with laboratory animals (the quantity of volume applications can falsify results of experiments)."
