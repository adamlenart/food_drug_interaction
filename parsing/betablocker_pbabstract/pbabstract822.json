    "0": "Administration of lithium chloride (40 mg/kg i.p.) led to a significant increase in 24 h water intake of rats. Prior administration of propranolol and haloperidol blocked the effect of lithium while atropine failed to show such an effect. The dipsogenic effect of lithium is probably exerted through beta-adrenergic and dopaminergic pathways.", 
    "1": "When rat fat cells were incubated with ACTH, epinephrine, or theophylline for 2 to 10 min, cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase (3':5'-cyclic-AMP 5'-nucleotidohydrolase, E.C. 3.1.4.17) activity (K(m) about 0.39 muM) in the 100,000 x g sediment fraction of homogenates was increased 35 to 50%. The effects of epinephrine and ACTH were concentration dependent and maximal increases were produced with concentrations similar to those that maximally stimulate lipolysis. Theophylline (0.5 mM) similarly increased phosphodiesterase activity but did not enhance the effects of maximally effective concentrations of the hormones. The changes in phosphodiesterase activity following addition of ACTH or theophylline paralleled changes in cell cyclic AMP content; both reached a maximum within 5 min and then declined, approaching basal levels after 20 or 30 min. The increased phosphodiesterase activity in cells incubated for 5 min with epinephrine reverted to basal levels within 2.5 min after the addition of propranolol. Our data are consistent with the view that there is a component of the fat-cell phosphodiesterase, perhaps localized in the plasma membrane, whose activity can be acutely modified by the concentration of its substrate, cyclic AMP. As previously reported (J. Biol. Chem.248, 7164-7170, 1973), exposure of fat cells to insulin increases the activity of a low K(m) phosphodiesterase also localized in the 100,000 x g sediment fraction of fat cell homogenates. In the presence of insulin, however, phosphodiesterase remained elevated for at least 40 min and there was no significant change in fat-cell cyclic AMP content. When phosphodiesterase activity was elevated and cyclic AMP content maintained at a high level by incubation of cells with ACTH plus theophylline, insulin produced a further increase in enzyme activity. Whether or not insulin and ACTH (or epinephrine or theophylline) affect the same phosphodiesterase, there seems little doubt that the underlying mechanisms are different.", 
    "2": "1 Haemodynamic changes have been studied in cats after the chronic oral administration of oxyfedrine (14 mg/kg for 3-4 weeks) or of placebo (lactose). The initial part of the study was carried out under double-blind conditions. The arterial blood pressure was between 19 mmHg (diastolic) and 27 mmHg (systolic) higher in the oxyfedrine treated animals, but there were no differences between the two groups with regard to cardiac output, left ventricular dP/dt max, heart rate or systolic ejection time.2 In cats similarly treated with propranolol (4 mg/kg) there was a slight (12%), but significant, reduction in cardiac output.3 Isoprenaline dose-response curves were shifted to the right in the cats administered oxyfedrine as well as in those administered propranolol. The degree of shift was five-fold (positive chronotropic response) and 20-fold (decrease in diastolic blood pressure) in the oxyfedrine group and 10- and 80-fold, respectively, in the propranolol group.4 In contrast to the partial blockade of the effects of isoprenaline, the haemodynamic response to oxyfedrine was largely unaltered, both in the cats pretreated with propranolol and in those pretreated with oxyfedrine. The pressor response to noradrenaline was potentiated in the cats pretreated with oxyfedrine.5 These results provide an explanation for the anti-anginal action of oxyfedrine. Some degree of beta-adrenoceptor blockade is achieved without a reduction in cardiac output or left ventricular dP/dt max. The relevance of these findings to the haemodynamic situation in angina is discussed.", 
    "3": "1 Drugs which release or modify the response to catecholamines were examined for their effect on the permeability of the mouse peritoneal vascular bed to circulating plasma albumin, labelled with Evans blue.2 Phenoxybenzamine, phentolamine, piperoxane, yohimbine or cocaine reduced the extravasation of Evans blue into the peritoneum, an effect which was antagonized by beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs. The inhibitory effect of desipramine on the extravasation of Evans blue was less completely antagonized by beta-adrenoceptor blockade.3 Inhibition of catecholamine biosynthesis, ganglion blockade or adrenergic neurone blockade antagonized the reduction in dye extravasation by alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agents and cocaine, but had no significant effect on the response to desipramine. The inhibitory effects of alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agents on dye extravasation were not prevented by bilateral adrenalectomy.4 Mice subjected to the procedure for estimation of vascular permeability excreted increased amounts of adrenaline and noradrenaline. Pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine, piperoxane or cocaine further increased catecholamine excretion, but desipramine caused only a small increase in catecholamine excretion which did not correlate with its effect on dye extravasation.5 It is suggested that phenoxybenzamine, phentolamine, piperoxane and cocaine reduce vascular permeability in the mouse peritoneum by releasing and/or potentiating the effects of endogenous catecholamines on beta-adrenoceptors. Endogenous catecholamines do not appear to be involved in the anti-inflammatory activity of desipramine.", 
    "4": "1 The effects of tolamolol on haemodynamics and myocardial contractility were investigated in two groups of six patients undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterization.2 The intravenous administration of tolamolol (0.15 mg/kg) produced a significant fall in heart rate from a control value (87 +/- 7 to 62 +/- 3 beats/min) 5 min after administration and a concomitant fall in cardiac output from 4.7 +/- 0.9 to 3.5 +/- 0.8 litres/minute. There was no significant change in systemic blood pressure, pulmonary artery blood pressure or stroke volume.3 There was no change in left ventricular end diastolic pressure after tolamolol. There was a fall in the maximum rate of rise of the left ventricular pressure (LV dp/dt(max)) and the derived index of the left ventricular contractile state (V(max)).4 These results suggest that tolamolol has a predominantly negative chronotropic but also a lesser negative inotropic action on the heart.", 
    "5": "1. The effects of dopamine on isolated rabbit superior cervical ganglion were investigated with intracellular recording techniques.2. Dopamine (10(-5)-10(-3)M) depressed the amplitude of the excitatory post-synaptic potential (e.p.s.p.) and blocked impulse transmission.3. Dopamine (10(-4)M) induced a slight (2-5 mV) post-synaptic hyperpolarization without altering membrane conductance.4. The post-synaptic membrane sensitivity to acetylcholine (ACh) applied iontophoretically was not affected by dopamine.5. Dopamine decreased the frequency of miniature excitatory post-synaptic potentials (m.e.p.s.p.s) in a high K(+) solution, with no change in the amplitude of m.e.p.s.p.s.6. Dopamine reduced the quantal content of the e.p.s.p. in a low Ca(2+) and high Mg(2+) solution, but had no effect on the quantal size.7. The ganglionic blocking effect of dopamine was antagonized by phenoxybenzamine, but not by propranolol.8. The results show that the ganglionic depressant effect of dopamine is exerted primarily through an alpha-adrenoceptive site at the presynaptic nerve terminal.", 
    "6": "The influence of autonomic neurohormones on the immunologic release of beta-glucuronidase (EC 3.2.1.31) from, and the cyclic nucleotide levels in, human neutrophils was determined. Interaction of neutrophils with rheumatoid arthritic, serum-treated zymosan particles in a neutral balanced salt solution at 37 degrees resulted in the extracellular discharge of beta-glucuronidase without any loss of cell viability, as indicated by the failure of incubated cells to take up eosin Y or to release cytoplasmic lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27). Epinephrine reduced the release of beta-glucuronidase from neutrophils in the presence of zymosan during 2-30 min of incubation and elicited a concomitant elevation of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate levels. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, but not phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist, blocked both actions of epinephrine. Acetylcholine stimulated the release of beta-glucuronidase, but not lactate dehydrogenase, and provoked a concomitant elevation of guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate levels. Atropine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, but not hexamethonium, a ganglionic blocker, inhibited both actions of acetylcholine. Interaction of neutrophils and zymosan particles resulted in an elevation of guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate levels within 2 min. These data suggest that intracellular guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate may be involved in mediating the immunologic release of lysosomal enzymes from human neutrophils whereas adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate may inhibit enzyme release. Moreover, autonomic neurohormones appear to be capable of modulating lysosomal enzyme release by virtue of their capacity to elevate neutrophil cyclic nucleotide levels.", 
    "7": "Treatment of hypertension with beta-blocking agents in three patients with moderately severe chronic renal failure was followed by rapid deterioration of renal function. In two of the patients the need for maintenance haemodialysis was accelerated but renal function in the third reverted to pretreatment levels after the drug was stopped. These findings suggest that until more is known about the effects of beta-blocking drugs they should not be given to patients with moderately severe renal failure.", 
    "8": "A total of 12 chronically anxious psychiatric outpatients were treated with racemic propranolol (Inderal), diazepam (Valium), and placebo for one week each, using a balanced cross-over experimental design. Six patients had predominantly somatic anxiety, complaining mostly of bodily symptoms, and six had mainly psychic anxiety, complaining primarily of psychological symptoms. Clinical ratings of anxiety were made by patient and psychiatrist after each treatment. Though diazepam was in general more effective than propranolol or placebo in relieving anxiety, propranolol was more effective than placebo in patients with somatic anxiety but not in those with psychic anxiety. We suggest that propranolol should be reserved for patients whose anxiety symptoms are mainly somatic.", 
    "9": "Release of melanophore stimulating hormone (MSH) from the vertebrate pars intermedia is under inhibitory control by the hypothalamus. Removal of the rat pituitary or the neurointermediate lobe of the frog (Rana pipiens) to in vitro incubation medium results in rapid uninhibited release of MSH. This secretion is inhibited by norepinephrine, epinephrine, phenylephrine, and dopamine, and the inhibition is antagonized by alpha-adrenergic receptor blocking agents. Isoproterenol stimulation of MSH secretion from isolated glands is blocked by pro-pranolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist. These results implicate dopaminergic or classical alpha-adrenergic receptors (or both) in inhibition of MSH release by catecholamines, and implicate beta-adrenergic receptors in stimulation of MSH release by the bioamines.", 
    "10": "1. In conscious dogs exercising on a treadmill variations in arterial blood pressure and heart rate which were correlated with bursts of panting were observed. The blood pressure variations reflected similar variations in the total peripheral vascular resistance.2. During exercise a change in respiration from slow breathing to panting was followed by a systemic vasodilatation and fall in blood pressure, but a rise in heart rate. Analysis of the time course of these effects demonstrated that the heart rate increase occurred later than the blood pressure fall.3. The correlation between panting and blood pressure changes was not abolished by either of the receptor-blocking drugs atropine sulphate or propranolol, nor by either of the following surgical procedures: acute bilateral cervical vagotomy, and denervation of the carotid sinus baroreceptors and carotid body chemoreceptors.4. The vasodilatation which followed a burst of panting appeared to be due to a decrease in adrenergic vasoconstrictor sympathetic nerve activity, and not to a change in the chemical composition of the arterial blood.5. It is concluded that the vascular changes are not reflex responses to stimulation of peripheral receptors by the bursts of panting. Instead, it is suggested that both the bursts of panting and associated falls in blood pressure are parallel effects resulting from activation at a suprabulbar level of the central nervous system. It is also concluded that the variations in heart rate are mediated by the baroreceptor reflex mechanism, activated by the changes in mean blood pressure."
