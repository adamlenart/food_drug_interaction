While propranolol completely blocked the effect of beta-agonists, the effect of etiocholanolone was little, and that of spleen extract was not affected by this beta-blocker.", 
    "1": "Aortic flow and arterial pressure were observed in conscious rats by means of an electromagnetic flowmeter probe implanted around the ascending aorta and an arterial cannula inserted into the abdominal aorta through a femoral artery. When the rat was transposed to a new box from its usual one, heart rate, cardiac output and peak flow acceleration were increased but arterial pressure remained unchanged. Total peripheral resistance was decreased. This response complex of the cardiovascular system to change of habitat was designated as \"transposition response.\" After beta adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol, transposition no longer increased heart rate, cardiac output or peak flow acceleration but markedly increased arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance. The response was essentially unchanged by atropinization or adrenalectomy. Besides cardiac excitation and adrenergic vasoconstriction, the response includes a beta adrenergic vasodilatation, which is at least in part mediated by transmitters released at the sympathetic nerve endings and presumably equivalent to the cholinergic vasodilatation in the cat and dog.", 
    "2": "The antihypertensive activity and tolerability of oxprenolol 80 mg plus chlorthalidone 10 mg in fixed combination were evaluated in 15 hypertensive patients aged more than 60 years (group 1) and, comparatively, in 11 hypertensive patients aged below 60 years (group 2), all with a lying B.P. value greater than 160/100 mmHg at the end of a two weeks placebo wash-out. Lying and standing systolic and diastolic B.P. decreased (P less than 0.001) (lying position: group 1, from 181.0/103.0 to 159.6/87.5 mmHg; group 2, from 173.6/105.4 to 143.3/86.1 mmHg); decrements in group 1 were minor than those in group 2. A diastolic blood pressure normalization was achieved in 12/15 patients of group 1 and in 10/11 of group 2. Side-effects were rare and of mild severity. Results obtained show that the fixed combination oxprenolol 80 mg plus chlorthalidone 10 mg can be safely administered also in the elderly hypertensive patients, without risk of cardiovascular complications, allowing satisfactory blood pressure control, with a simple dosage schedule, thus improving patient compliance to the therapy.", 
    "3": "Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is rarely associated with significant coronary artery stenosis. Differential diagnosis may be difficult because of similar symptoms; therefore we suggest coronary arteriography in all patients above 30 years of age having HOCM and angina associated. Obviously, in case the clinical diagnosis is coronary artery occlusive disease, left ventriculography is mandatory to rule out HOCM. Four medical treatment beta-blocking agents are the drugs of choice associated, if needed, with coronary dilators, avoiding nitrates. In case surgical treatment is selected, complete correction of all lesions is indicated.", 
    "4": "The adrenergic beta-receptor blockers: Propranolol, Alprenolol, Oxprenolol, Pindolol, Practolol, and Talinolol, inhibit the calorigenic action of adrenaline in experiments on rats. These findings doe not permit any quantitative comparison, because the beta blockers show considerable differences in their inherent action on the basic metabolism. THe cardioselective beta-blockers, Practolol and Talinolol, are without effect, while Propanolol increases, and Alprenolol, Oxprenolol and Pindolol lower the basic metabolism. The intrinsic activity of these compounds increases with the decrease of their hydrophobicity.", 
    "5": "Gastric intubation of female Sprague-Dawley rats (80--150 g) with one large dose (5 g/kg) of ethanol doubled both hepatic oxygen uptake and ethanol metabolism within 2.5 hr in the perfused rat liver (Swift Increase in Alcohol Metabolism--SIAM). Hepatic oxygen uptake could also be elevated by direct infusion of epinephrine and glucagon into the perfused liver. Alcohol treatment produced significant increases in circulating epinephrine, norepinephrine and glucose but did not effect levels of plasma immunoreactive insulin. Administration of alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking agents, adrenalectomy and hypophysectomy prevented the increase in oxygen uptake due to ethanol treatment. These data suggest that catecholamines and possibly other hormones play an important role in the mechanism of the Swift Increase in Alcohol Metabolism (SIAM).", 
    "6": "The beta-sympathomimetic effect of prenalterol was investigated on the electrically driven left atrium as well as on the tracheal chain of the guinea pig. 1. On the atrium driven at 2 Hz prenalterol caused a positive inotropic effect with a pD2-value of 7.0 +/- 0.08 (N = 4). Compared to isoprenaline (1.0) its intrinsic activity amounted to 0.3. 2. On the tracheal chain prenalterol caused very little relaxation. Its intrinsic activity was virtually negligible when compared with those of fenoterol (1.0) or noradrenaline (1.0); it amounted to 0.07 only. 3. On the atrium the positive inotropic effect of prenalterol vanished after 1 hour of incubation. At this time the concentration-response curve for isoprenaline was shifted dose-dependently to the right. The pD2-value for isoprenaline was significantly diminished (P less than 0.001) by prenalterol, 10(-6)M, from 8.36 to 7.14. 4. Likewise, on the trachea prenalterol caused a pronounced, dose-dependent shift of the concentration-response curves for fenoterol as well as for noradrenaline to the right. 5. The results presented here show that on beta-adrenoceptors of the guinea pig prenalterol is acting like a partial agonist in the left atrium, but as full antagonist in the trachea.", 
    "7": "In a number of hyperthyroid patients the serum gastrin level exceeds the normal range. Administration of beta-blocking agents results in a decrease of the hypergastrinaemia. The fall in the serum gastrin levels is unrelated to the effect of beta-blocking agents on peripheral thyroxine metabolism, but is associated with a decline of the plasma cAMP levels. It is suggested that, though beta adrenergic sensitivity is one of the factors of hypergastrinaemia in hyperthyroidism, other factors may be involved in its production, too.", 
    "8": "We have recently described the affinity chromatography purification of the turkey erythrocyte beta-adrenergic receptor. The minute amounts obtained initially precluded extensive biochemical characterization. To improve the yield of the receptor, the erythrocyte membranes have been prepared by a new method. This procedure resulted in a 10-fold higher receptor density in comparison with the membrane preparation used previously. The new membranes also contained a catecholamine-sensitive guanine triphosphatase and an adenylate cyclase sensitive to Gpp(NH)p and l-epinephrine. Solubilization by a double digitonin extraction resulted in a preparation containing 4-6 pmoles of 3H-dihydroalprenolol binding sites per mg of membrane protein. A single step of affinity chromatography on alprenolol-sepharose of the soluble digitonin extract resulted in an additional 1,000-fold purification of the receptor. The overall purification factor was 20,000 relative to the binding activity of the crude membrane preparations. Electrophoresis is SDS-polyacrylamide of iodinated purified beta-receptors revealed, after autoradiography, the presence of four major components. Three of these, corresponding to molecular weights of 170,000, 33,000, and 30,000, respectively, were not affected by reduction with beta-mercaptoethanol and were not observed when the digitonin extracts were loaded on the affinity gel in the presence of an excess of l-propranolol. A fourth 52,000-dalton component (60,000 daltons after reduction with beta-mercaptoethanol) remained apparent even when affinity purification was prevented by addition of l-propranolol. Our results suggest that the beta-adrenergic receptor is composed of at least three subunits that interact by noncovalent bonds.", 
    "9": "The alpha-adrenolytic activity of BE 2254 was investigated in in vitro as well as in vivo assays. On the isolated rat anococcygeus muscle, 2-[beta-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethyl-amino-methyl]tetralone(1) (BE 2254) shows a high affinity for postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors (pA2 = 8.9), in contrast to its much weaker potency (pA2 = 6.7) in inhibiting clonidine on the electrically driven rat vas deferens, thus suggesting a relative preference for postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors. BE 2254 effects on other catecholamine receptors are either negligible or not detectable. The hypotensive action of BE 2254 is shown to be solely due to alpha-blockade. All alpha-adrenolytic actions studied were of competitive nature.", 
    "10": "Two fixed ratio combination tablets, 10 mg pindolol combined with 5 mg clopamide and 100 mg metoprolol combined with 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide, were compared at two dose levels in a double-blind crossover trial in 10 previously untreated hypertensive patients. No significant difference was observed between resting blood pressure on the two combinations at either dose level. Exercise systolic pressure was lower after the pindolol/clopamide combination at low dose (p less than 0.05). The incidence of side-effects in this trial was high but proper comparison of the two products could not be made because of the small number of patients. It is suggested that combination products should be used only after patients have failed to respond adequately to a single agent.", 
    "11": "Antihypertensive effects of three beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, acebutolol, propranolol, and practolol were studied for 11 weeks. Spontaneously (SHR); one-clip, two-kidney (CLIP); and deoxycorticosterone and salt (DOC) hypertensive rats were used. The drugs were given orally, 100 mg/kg per day, 5 days per week before development of hypertension. Propranolol inhibited blood pressure (BP) increase significantly in SHR. Acebutolol and practolol also lowered BP in SHR. Three drugs did not affect BP in CLIP, but an apparent inhibition was seen when the results were analyzed including the cases of which BP stayed below 150 mmHg. Either of three drugs did not show antihypertensive effects in DOC. Acebutolol rather increased BP more rapidly. Practolol also increased BP slightly more rapidly. Cerebral stroke was seen in DOC. The incidences of the stroke in the groups given the solvent, acebutolol, propranolol, and practolol were 3/6, 4/7, 2/6, and 3/6, respectively. Acebutolol seemed to cause stroke earlier with the more rapid BP elevation. Acebutolol, propranolol, and practolol decreased incidence of the vascular disease in CLIP. Propranolol also decreased it in DOC. Plasma renin activity was suppressed by these drugs in SHR and CLIP. The mechanisms of antihypertensive effects of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs are unknown. The present study denies those due to inhibition of cardiac function, or renin release from the kidney. A better experimental model is necessary to study this. The possibility that acebutolol and other beta-blockers might accelerate BP elevation and incidence of stroke must be reexamined.", 
    "12": "(-)-Pindolol, one of the most potent beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, was radioiodinated using chloramine-T oxidation of carrier-free Na 125I and separated from unreacted pindolol to yield 2200 Ci/mmole (-)-[125I]-iodopindolol ((-)-[125I]-IPin). Mass and ultraviolet spectra confirmed that the iodination occurred on the indole ring, presumably at the 3 position. The binding of radiolabeled (-)-[125I]-IPin to beta-adrenergic receptors has been studied using intact C6 rat astrocytoma cells (2B subclone) grown in monolayer cultures. Binding of (-)-[125I]-IPin was saturable with time and concentration. Using 13 pM (-)-[125I]-IPin, binding equilibrium was reached in 90 min at 21-22 degrees C. The reverse rate constant was 0.026 min-1 at 21 degrees C. Specific binding (expressed as 1 microM (-)-propranolol displaceable counts) of (-)-[125I]-IPin was 95% of total binding. Scatchard analysis of (-)-[125I]-IPin binding revealed approximately 4300 receptors/cell and a dissociation constant of 30 pM. This was in excellent agreement with the kinetically determined dissociation constant of 35 pM. Displacement by propranolol and isoproterenol showed that (-)-[125I]-IPin binding sites were pharmacologically and stereospecifically selective. These results indicate that (-)-[125I]-IPin, a pure (-)-stereoisomer, high specific activity radioligand, selectively binds to beta-adrenergic receptors in whole cells with a high percentage of specific binding and should therefore be useful in the study and measurement of cellular beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "13": "Parotid slices respond to norepinephrine with a rapid but transient accumulation of cyclic AMP. Continued exposure of the slices to norepinephrine results in a loss of responsiveness to subsequent application of norepinephrine (refractoriness or desensitization). Refractoriness could not be overcome by exposing the slices to a supra-maximum concentration of norepinephrine. The suppressed response was clearly seen at 15 min after the first exposure to norepinephrine, but about 60 min were required for reaching complete suppression. The refractoriness also depended on the concentration of agonists, and their order of potency correlated well with their agonistic activity. The induction of desensitization was beta- agonist specific, and was blocked by beta-adrenergic blocking agents such as atenolol and alprenolol. The recovery from desensitization was observed by removing norepinephrine from the medium. The recovery was not evident until 15 min after washing the slices, but was nearly complete after 1 hr. Although parallel changes were observed between the initial increase in cyclic AMP level and the degree of desensitization by norepinephrine, the induction of desensitization does not seem to be mediated by cyclic AMP. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon does not appear to involve the activation of phosphodiesterase, the formation of an inhibitory substance in the medium or an increase in the rate of excretion of cyclic AMP. Changes in the ATP level by norepinephrine did not always correlate with the degree of refractoriness. No significant changes in the amount of [3H]-dihydroalprenolol binding were found in the membrane fraction prepared from the slices incubated with norepinephrine. These results suggest that the induction of desensitization may be mediated by modulating the coupling process between the receptor and adenylate cyclase.", 
    "14": "Study of 192 cases of hypertensive patients, 89 of whom were treated by diet, general advice and correction of risk factors for an average period of 8 months. The group of patients treated beta blockers consisted of 103 subjects, 28 of whom received Propranolol, 29 Oxyprenolol, 20 Atenolol and 26 Practolol. The prevalence of Raynaud's phenomenon was markedly greater in the patients treated with beta blockers, in comparison with the group not receiving any drugs. The highest incidence of vasomotor problems was seen in the group of subjects treated with Propranolol, with 57% of patients having a Raynaud-type paroxysmal acrosyndrome. In more than half of the cases attributed to Propranolol, the clinical picture of Raynaud's syndrome was severe. Discussion of the mode of action of beta blockers on the microcirculation.", 
    "15": "34 patients have been controlled after beta-blocking therapy, for a mean period of 5 years. Symptoms and evolution: syncope disappeared, angoy passed from 47% to 23%, dyspnea from 65% to 47%, dizziness from 70% to 54%, weakness from 30% to 37%. A systolic murmur was present in 75% of the cases. Two patients died by heart failure. Phonocardiogram: the systolic murmur was unchanged, like the carotid pulse. Paradoxical splitting of the 2 degrees sound was more frequent, atrial sound unimodified, isometric contraction shortened (60%) and the Q-1 degree sound interval prolonged (90%). Electrocardiogram: 1 degree A/V block appeared in 24% of the cases, complete A/V block in 9%, atrial fibrillation in 3%. Left atrial enlargement was more frequent; left ventricular hypertrophy unchanged. Heart catheterization (10 cases, after a mean period of 5.5 years): left ventricular pressure gradient passed from 80% to 90%; a low cardiac index from 20% to 30%; telediastolic pressure of left ventricle was unmmodified in 10% of cases, more elevated in 50%, less elevated in 40%. Chest X ray: cardiac size was unchanged in 65% of cases, enlarged in 32%; smaller in 3%. In conclusion, symptoms improved in most of the patients; no case of sudden death was observed. Some data however show that the evolution of the myocardiopathy goes on to congestive heart failure and arise doubts on the real usefullness of beta-blocking drugs in the disease.",

The pharmacokinetics were studied during dosing and in the washout period. The pharmacokinetic characteristics were unchanged after repeated doses, T/2 16-22 h, Vd 7.7-8.8 l/kg; clearance 0.28-0.33 l/h/kg.", 
    "17": "The synthesis and comparative pharmacological studies concerning structure-activity relationship of new benzothiazole, benzisothiazole, benzoxazole, and benisoxazole derivatives with beta-sympatholytic activity are reported. Most of the 4-benzisothiazole derivatives studied strongly act on cardiac beta 1-receptors in rats in situ (2.6-8.3 times propranolol). On the other hand derivatives of 4-benzisoxazole and 5-benzisothiazole are less potent. A strong decrease in activity was observed going from the benzisothiazoles and benzisoxazoles to the isomeric benzthiazoles and benzoxazoles. The active substances also block vascular beta 2-receptors. In the most cases they have little intrinsic adrenergic activity. The observed tendency concerning beta 1-selectivity in rats could not be confirmed in cats. The most potent 4-benzisothiazole derivatives in rats show also - beside some minor differences - very good beta-sympatholytic activity in cats after i.v. as well as after i.d. administration. Similar to the results in rats and cats the 4-(2-hydroxy-3-isopropylamino-propoxy)-1,2-benzisothiazole (LU 24329) was found to possess a high activity in conscious dogs by oral or i.v. application. Both in dogs (i.v.) and in isolated perfused guinea pig hearts LU 24329 is eleven times more active than propranolol in blocking beta 1-receptors. A negative inotropic effect as an expression of non-specific membrane-stabilizing action of LU 24329 is also demonstrated in guinea pig hearts. The effective concentration is 4650 times higher than that effective on beta 1-adrenoceptors. The active compounds have a moderate acute toxicity. The LD50 values in mice after i.p. administration are ranging from 55-174% of the propranolol toxicity.", 
    "18": "Left ventricular filling was studied by echocardiography and cineangiography in 37 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with obstruction before and during long-term oral beta blockade (166 +/- 61 mg propranolol for 15.6 +/- 21 months on average) in order to determine the mechanism of symptomatic improvement in these patients. This study confirmed that clinical improvement is related to a great degree to the improvement in the parameters of left ventricular filling. In addition, two groups of patients may be identified: the \"reactors\", that is to say the patients who remained or became asymptomatic, characterised by a significant improvement in the indices of left ventricular filling (maximum filling velocity p < 0.01, duration of rapid filling p < 0.05, left ventricular compliance--volumic kGaasch p < 0.001, parietal ks Mirsky p < 0.01). The \"non-reactors\" were characterised by very poor indices of left ventricular filling. These abnormalities are principally related to severe and irreversible changes in left ventricular and mitral valve morphology.", 
    "19": "Alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade does not affect ventilation during exercise in man. Med. Sci. Sports Exercise, Vol. 12, No. 5, pp. 375-379, 1980. Combined alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade was used to study the role of the exercise induced stimulation of the adrenergic system on exercise hyperpnea. Twelve subjects performed an uninterrupted graded exercise test until exhaustion, before and during treatment with the alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocker labetalol. In the control study, plasma noradrenaline rose on the average 4.3 times during maximal exercise and plasma adrenaline 2.7 times, with similar data during labetalol. Labetalol did not affect oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide output, respiratory exchange ratio, pulmonary ventilation, nor the ventilatory equivalents for O2 and for CO2 at rest recumbent, at rest sitting, and during submaximal and maximal exercise, nor did it affect the anaerobic threshold. These findings do not substantiate a role for the adrenergic system in exercise hyperpnea in the conditions of the present study.", 
    "20": "The authors have morphometrically studied the differentiation of the myocardium in dynamic phases of the embryonic and postnatal development in chickens and Syrian Hamsters. Moreover, they investigated the action of the beta-adrenalytic substances Practolol and Trimepranol on ultrastructure of the cardiac muscle in adult animals. The volume of mitochondria in myocardial cells in 6-day old chicken embryos amounts to 5.65% of the total cell volume, in 12-day old embryos 14.35%, in 18-day old embryos 19.60%, in 1-day old chickens 23.24% which is nearly as much as in adult animals. The volume of myofibrils in 6-day old embryos is about 3.2%, in 12-day old embryos about 7.4%, in 18-day old embryos about 16.4% and in 1-day old chickens about 21.2%. The differences between individual groups are statistically significant. The dynamics of differentiation of the myocardium in Syrian Hamsters was studied in 5 phases, namely in 14-day old embryos and in postnatal phases on the 2nd, 5th, 14th and 21st days after birth. Most cells in 14-day old embryos are rather immature. Participation of the volume of mitochondria, myofibrils, equipment of mitochondria with cristae etc. considerably increase in postnatal phases. These findings suggest that the heart of mammals is rather immature at birth and will differentiate mainly in the postnatal developmental phases. Many morphometric findings, as regards the action of beta-adrenalytic drugs on the ultrastructure of the myocardium in adult rabbits, point to the fact that application of these substances will give rise to degenerative alterations in approximately 10% of myocardial cells. Theoretical explantation of these mechanisms is being discussed.", 
    "21": "In a randomized double-blind study of seven healthy subjects an intravenous injection of metoprolol and propranolol did not change the submaximal gastric acid response to pentagastrin. The inhibition of pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion by balloon distension of the antrum was unchanged by a preceding intravenous injection of metoprolol or propranolol. The plasma level of pancreatic polypeptide in peripheral venous blood showed a significant rise during antral distension. This rise was unaltered by a preceding injection of metoprolol and slightly depressed by propranolol. We conclude that the inhibitory effect of antral distension on gastric acid secretion in healthy subjects is not mediated by beta 1 or beta 2-adrenergic mechanisms. The reflex release of pancreatic polypeptide by antral distension may possibly involve a weak beta 2-adrenergic component.", 
    "22": "The effect of beta-adrenoreceptor blockade by propranolol and practolol on basal secretion and on submaximally histamine-stimulated gastric acid secretion was studied in conscious non-vagotomized and in vagotomized gastric fistula dogs. Neither propranolol (0.5 mg/kg) nor practolol (1.0 mg/kg), both intravenously, had a significant influence on basal or histamine-stimulated gastric acid secretion in non-vagotomized and vagotomized dogs. It is concluded that beta-adrenergic blockade has no influence on basal or histamine-stimulated gastric acid secretion in dogs. Furthermore, no differences were found between the non-vagotomized and the vagotomized stomach.", 
    "23": "The beta-adrenergic blocking potency of 56 1-substituted ureidophenoxy-3-amino-2-propanols has been analysed in terms of the linear Free-Wilson model.

The preliminary indication given by the Free-Wilson analysis has been confirmed by a quantitative regression analysis, carried out in the frame of the \"mixed approach\" method.", 
    "24": "The interaction between drug and receptor evokes a series of reactions resulting in a physiological response. A recognition site, an amplifier system and an effector system are involved in the mediation of effect. A brief review is given of the historical development of the adrenoceptor concept, of the classification of adrenoceptors, and of the consequences of stimulation and blockade of these receptors by drugs.", 
    "25": "Rats were trained by daily running exercises for 7 weeks. In addition, one group of rats was trained under the influence of propranolol, while another group received daily injections of propranolol only. None of the treatments used had influence on the activities of myocardial enzymes: 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA - dehydrogenase (HADH), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), and citrate synthase (CS) which were assayed for estimating oxidative capacity, or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) which was used as a measure of anaerobic capacity. Training without propranolol resulted in elevated activities of the oxidative enzymes in M. extensor digitorum and in M. soleus. The corresponding changes in the rat group trained with propranolol always were much smaller, despite an equal amount of training. Only the trend for lowered activity of LDH was observable in skeletal muscle of the rat groups trained both with and without propranolol. Long-term beta-blockade alone did not induce enzymatic changes. It is concluded that a functioning sympathetic nervous system is necessary for the adaptive responses of muscular metabolism to training. Blockade of the sympathetic influence during exercise periods also hampers the training-induced responses.", 
    "26": "An open study was carried out in 20 hypertensive patients, who had inadequate blood pressure control with beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs and diuretics, to investigate the effects of adding prazosin to their existing treatment regimen. Patients received a mean daily dose of prazosin of 8.7 +/- 4.4 mg over a period of 12 weeks. The results showed that there was a significant reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the resting position. Only a few side-effects were reported and these occurred during the first 4 weeks whilst prazosin dosage was being adjusted. Weight increase, however, was noted in all but 4 of the patients. It is suggested that this may have been due partly to fluid retention, even though the majority were receiving diuretics, or possibly to changed carbohydrate-insulin metabolism.", 
    "27": "In two groups of patients with well-defined obstructive lung disease - a group of bronchitics according to WHO criteria and a group of patients with extrinsic allergic asthma - the effect of carazolol, a so-called non-cardioselective beta-blocking drug, was investigated. Pindolol was used to compare the results with a second blocking drug. Carazolol increased bronchial resistance in the bronchitic group but not in the asthmatic group; with the exception of 1 patient in whom carazolol induced a status asthmaticus. The effect of the drug on bronchial resistance depends only in part upon the drug itself, but was influenced much more by the characteristics of the patients. We therefore conclude that the quality of beta 1-receptorspecificity was, at least in part, a result of the qualities of the patients. The designation of a drug as beta 1-specific should therefore be used very cautiously. Serious side-effects on the bronchial system in particular persons are also possible from drugs shown to be safe in some groups of patients.", 
    "28": "The fall in blood pressure after the induction of beta-blockade occurs approximately 3 hours after the fall in cardiac output, heart rate and plasma renin activity has occurred. None of the known pharmacological actions of these agents can directly account for the fall in pressure. Further work is required to determine whether the fall in cardiac output is essential or whether these agents affect renal handling of sodium. Studies are also needed of baroceptor function as blood pressure falls.", 
    "29": "Chronic beta-blockade with the cardioselective blockers practolol and atenolol had no attenuating effect on blood-pressure increases provoked by cold pressor test or by plasma expansion. Reports in the literature of an exaggerated cold pressor test reaction under propanolol therapy could be confirmed with practolol and atenolol. This may be regarded as an advantage of cardioselective blockade. The increase of the cardiac output after plasma expansion is enhanced during cardioselective beta-blockade. This could result from a reduced action of cardioselective blockers on the capacitance vessels. Concerning the mechanisms of antihypertensive action of beta blocking agents our findings do not support the cardiac output hypothesis. Before and during beta blocking therapy baroreflex sensitivy was not significantly different. So the baroreflex theory can't be strengthened neither.", 
    "30": "The antihypertensive action of chronic beta-blockade, with simultaneous reduction of beta-receptor activity at the medullary, cardiac and renal levels, is complex. An integrated explanation is offered by stressing the importance of the whole-body balance between sodium and noradrenaline. Evidence was provided in an eleven week lasting study in patients with essential hypertension, where chronic beta-blockade was performed by increasing doses of Pindolol (10--20 mg/die). While urinary sodium and noradrenaline showed only small changes, the correlation between blood pressure and the sodium/noradrenaline quotient reversed significantly. The altered correlation is interpreted as the common result of the different hypotensive actions of chronic beta-blockade, with special regard to the renal component. Thus, pressure normalisation in essential hypertension during chronic beta-blockade is achieved by an adjustment of the imbalance between whole-body sodium and whole-body noradrenaline.", 
    "31": "Altered pharmacokinetics of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs in renal insufficiency are described in the light of available data in the literature and current knowledge based on recent investigations with a variety of commonly used drugs. Reduced excretion and retention of the active drug is not the only abnormality that may occur in renal insufficiency. Alterations in drug absorption, protein binding, volume of distribution, biotransformation and accumulation of pharmacologically active metabolite are important factors to consider--all may play an important role in determining altered pharmacologic or toxicologic response to a drug. Our own observations on altered disposition kinetics of the three beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs practolol, sotalol and acebutolol in patients with renal insufficiency are also included in this paper.", 
    "32": "Since beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs exhibit a long duration of action \"despite\" an elimination half-life of usually between 2 and 6 hours, it has been postulated that no direct correlation could exist between the time course of plasma levels and that of pharmacodynamic effects. Results of a study are reported in which 20 mg pindolol were administered orally to 8 healthy volunteers. Exercise tests were carried out and pindolol levels determined at various times for up to 24 hours after drug administration. A linear fall of the pharmacological effect (reduction of exercise-induced tachycardia) and an exponential fall of pindolol plasma levels were observed, indicating a linear relationship between the reduction of exercise-induced tachycardia and the logarithm of plasma concentration.", 
    "33": "In aged people a differentiation has to be made between \"arteriosklerotic hypertension\" due to increased stiffness of the aorta and true hypertension in older patients. The therapy of hypertension in older patients principally is the same as in younger individuals; however, blood pressure should be lowered slowly with the respect to concomitant diseases of the kidney, coronary arteriosclerosis and heart failure. Usually, in older patients there long-standing hypertension with increased peripheral resistance and low cardiac output. Therefore, a diuretic or vasodilating agent may be the drug of first choice. Betablockers are not generally contraindicated, but given with caution. The same is true for ganglionblocking agents. In a large number of cases salt restriction and general measures will lead to a suitable blood pressure control.",

The potency and the efficacy of these derivatives depend on the substituents. By the introduction of the arylamino-ethyl residue into the nitrogen atom, beta-adrenergic locking agents with marked agonistic activity are obtained.", 
    "35": "Methoxamine and phenylephrine (PE), postsynaptic alpha adrenergic agonists stimulated the accumulation of cyclic AMP in spinal cord tissue slices. Naphazoline, oxymetazoline and clonidine, previously shown to have greater efficacy at presynaptic alpha receptors did not alter accumulation and, in fact, blocked the PE response. The PE-stimulation was completely inhibited by postsynaptic alpha antagonists, incompletely by agents which bl ock presynaptic alpha receptors, and slightly by the beta blocker propranolol. Pe-stimulated accumulation was potentiated by phosphodiesterase inhibition (RO 20-1724). In contrast to previous reports on the requirement of the copresence of adenosine for alpha receptor stimulated accumulation of cyclic AMP in neuronal tissue, the PE-stimulation in spinal cord slices was unchanged by adenosine receptor blockade (theophylline), hydrolysis of endogenous adenosine (adenosine deaminase), inhibition of adenosine deaminase (EHNA) or blockade of adenosine uptake (dipyridamole). Added adenosine increased basal accumulation and produced a marked potentiation of the PE response. From this data it is evident that, in spinal cord tissue slices, there occurs a postsynaptic alpha adrenergic receptor linked to cyclic AMP accumulation which does not require the presence of other neurohumoral agents for activation.", 
    "36": "When isolated rat liver cells were incubated in the presence of epinephrine and dopamine at concentrations ranging from 0.2 ug to 2.0 ug per ml, glycogenoloysis was maximally stimulated within 15 min. The combined addition to incubation medium showed that somatostatin did not inhibit the stimulated glycogenolysis induced by epinephrine and dopamine. On the other hand, the combined addition to the incubation medium showed that propranolol inhibited the stimulated glycogenolysis induced by epinephrine, while propranolol did not inhibit the stimulated glycogenolysis induced by vasoactive intestinal peptide. These results suggest that the receptor site for vasoactive intestinal peptide may be different from that of epinephrine.", 
    "37": "The relative extent of myocardial infarction produced by occlusion of the left anterior descendens coronary artery in anesthetized dogs was determined under control conditions or following treatment (4 h after ligation) with propranolol (1 mg/kg), bevantolol (3 mg/kg) or N-dimethyl propranolol (10 mg/kg). Doses of drugs were selected to provide similar reductions in heart rate, aortic blood pressure and contractility. Infarct size was estimated indirectly from levels of plasma creatine phosphokinase and measured histochemically by nitroblue tetrazolium stain. A significant ( p < 0.001) correlation between methods was found. Propranolol and bevantolol (beta adrenergic antagonists) produced a significant (p < 0.05) reduction (approximately 50% decrease) in infarct size, measured at 8 h following induction of ischemia, while N-dimemthyl propranolol (no beta antagonist activity) produced no effect. While all three agents produced similar hemodynamic actions and thereby reduced primary determinants of myocardial oxygen demand, only the beta blockers were able to afford protection of ischemic myocardium.", 
    "38": "Neuroleptic drugs have several acute and chronic actions on biochemical mechanisms of brain: (a) Acutely they block the action of catecholamines on the adrenergic receptor-adenylate cyclase complex, thereby preventing the catecholamine-induced rise in cyclic AMP. (b) With long-term treatment they appear to produce a compensatory induction of these adrenergic receptors. (c) Neuroleptics also bind to an endogenous calcium-dependent protein, termed calmodulin, whichis found in high concentrations in the CNS. This binding is relatively specific for clinically-effective neuroleptics of diverse chemical structure. (d) The binding of neuroleptics to calmodulin can explain several of their biochemical actions and suggests that some of the pharmacological and clinical effects of neuroleptics may also be explained by this same common mechanism.", 
    "39": "beta-Adrenergic mimetics and blockers, as well as a local anesthetic (xylocaine) were infused into the vertebral artery of paralyzed and artificially ventilated cats. The effects of the drugs on the central control of ventilation was assessed by measuring the changes in phrenic nerve activity. beta-Mimetics [isoprenaline (1 and 2), metroprolol (1), oxprenolol (1 and 2)] decreased the phrenic nerve activity. beta 2-Mimetics (Salbutamol) and blockers (Butoxamine, H 35/35) had no clear effects. The mode of action of the beta-blockers is most probably not by their local anesthetic properties. It is concluded that beta-adrenergic mechanisms in the brain stem stimulate the ventilatory control system. The receptors are most probably beta 1-receptors.", 
    "40": "1. A survey is given of the various aspects of centrally acting hypotensive drugs. The majority of centrally acting hypotensive agents act by way of central alpha-adrenoceptors, probably located in the pontomedullary region of the brain. These central receptors are stimulated by clonidine, guanfacine and various related compounds, and also by alpha-methylnoradrenaline, generated in vivo upon biotransformation of alpha-methyldopa within the brain. The stimulation of the alpha-adrenoceptors induces a decrease in peripheral sympathetic tone and thus a fall in arterial blood pressure and bradycardia. 2. The possibility that presynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors in the brain are involved in the central hypotensive action of clonidine, guanfacine and related compounds is discussed. Also, the possible involvement of central histaminergic and cholinergic receptors in central hypotensive effects is reviewed. 3. Various experimental compounds with a central hypotensive effect different from that of clonidine and related drugs are mentioned. 4. Finally, it is pointed out that the hypotensive effects of various beta-sympatholytic drugs and of prazosin are probably not of central origin.", 
    "41": "After application of ethanol (1.5 mg/g i.v.) to mice, the content of glycogen of the liver and the brain decreased. The alterated content of the metabolites of the glucose break-down points to an augmentation of the glycolysis in the liver and a diminution of the glycolysis in the brain. By pretreatment with the beta-sympatholytic agent 1-isopropylamino-3-(3-tolyloxy)-2-propanol (toliprolol, Doberol) (50 microgram/g s.c.), the ethanol-induced break-down of glycogen was partially blocked in the liver and completely abolished in the brain. In contrast, mainly synergistic effects of ethanol and toliprolol on the glycolysis of the liver and the brain were found. From the results it is concluded that the ethanol-induced break-down of glycogen is mediated, at least in part, by catecholamines whereas the alteration of the glycolysis by ethanol is brought about by some different mechanism.", 
    "42": "When tested on the isolated sympathetic ganglion of the rat and frog, beta adrenergic blocking agents were found to inhibit synaptic transmission. This effect can be attributed, in some cases, to the aspecific membrane-stabilizing effect of the drugs, and in other instances to a specific ganglionic blocking property of the agents tested. Beta blockers proved to be more potent ganglioplegics than hexamethonium, their effect was in turn surpassed by pempidine and d-tubocurarine. In some cases the duration of the transmission block induced by beta blockers was longer than that of the reference compounds. On basis of the obtained results, it might not be excluded that the antihypertensive effect of beta adrenergic blocking agents involves a ganglionic component.", 
    "43": "The electrophysiological properties of Tobanum (a new beta receptor blocking drug) were studied in 14 patients by the aid of His electrography and programmable electrical stimulation of the heart. On the effect of Tobanum (0,9 mg by slow i.v. injection), three characteristic changes could be detected: 1. The impulse conduction in AV node slowed down markedly. 2. The heart frequency decreased. 3. The effective refractory period of the atrium significantly increased. Tobanum seems to be a very effective antiarrhythmic drug for the treatment of supraventricular tachycardias.", 
    "44": "The acute and chronic circulatory effects of a new beta adrenergic blocking drug, dl-1-(2,5-dichlorophenoxy)-3-tertiary-butylamino-2-propanol hydrochloride, GYKI-41099, have been assessed in patients with hyperkinetic circulation/or mild hypertension. The acute effects of GYKI-41099 2.5, 5 and 10 mg have been compared with those of propranolol 10, 20 and 40 mg using a cross-over design in 18 patients with elevated cardiac index. Each dose of both drugs produced a significant reduction in sitting and exercise heart rate. The potency of GYKI-41099 compared with propranolol proved to be 3:1. 13 patients with hyperkinetic circulation on GYKI-41099 5-15 mg daily for 2 months exhibited a significant reduction in resting heart rate and cardiac index. In 13 patients with mild hypertension the drug exerted marked antihypertensive effect. Side effects were minimal and short-lived."
