A 25-year-old male was anesthetized with propofol-fentanyl under jugular venous bulb oxygen saturation (SjO2) monitoring. Just after the total removal of AVM, SjO2 and blood pressure increased suddenly and brain swelling occurred. On the diagnosis of hyperemia of the brain, hyperventilation and controlled hypotension with nicardipine, diltiazem and sodium nitroprusside were started, but they were not effective. Thereafter, we injected a beta-blocker (propranolol, 0.2 mg) intravenously, resulting in the decrease in blood pressure and the disappearance of the brain swelling. SjO2 monitoring supports the safe management of postresection hyperemia, and beta-blocker can be useful against hyperemic complications during and after AVM surgery.",

The suggested complex therapy of the ischemic variation improves both the microcirculation in the optic nerve disk (OND) by administering different-effect drugs in long courses and the systemic hemodynamics (practitioners of needed skills are involved). The use of local antihypertensive drug to reduce the intraocular pressure to an individual tolerable value is important in the treatment of patients with tension-ischemic glaucoma.

Human plasma was spiked with stock solution of arotinolol enantiomers and labetalol as the internal standard. The assay involved the use of liquid-liquid extraction procedure with ethyl ether under alkaline condition for human plasma sample prior to HPLC analysis. Recoveries for S-(+)- and R-(-)-arotinolol enantiomers were in the range 93-103% at 200-1400 ng/mL level. Intra-day and inter-day precision calculated as %RSD was in the ranges 1.3-3.4 and 1.9-4.5% for both enantiomers, respectively. Intra-day and inter-day accuracies calculated as percentage error were in the ranges 1.2-3.5 and 1.5-6.2% for both enantiomers, respectively. Linear calibration curves in the concentration range 100-1500 ng/mL for each enantiomer showed a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.9998.

Furthermore, although patients with CHF derive considerable benefit from beta-blockers, these agents are thought by many physicians to be contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus. Most published studies on beta-blockers in CHF have been unable to reach definitive conclusions about the mortality benefits of these agents in patients with diabetes mellitus.

Regional wall motion score index (WMSI) was calculated as the sum of the scores in each segment divided by the total number of segments visualized. WMSI was compared with change in LVEF after 3 months of therapy as determined by gated radionuclide scan. Change in WMSI correlated inversely with change in LVEF after 3 months of bucindolol (r=-0.72, P<0.0001) and was the most significant multivariate predictor of change in LVEF (P=0.0002). Patients with contractile reserve had demographics similar to those of patients without contractile reserve, including RVEF, LVEF, systolic blood pressure, and CHF duration. However, patients without contractile reserve had higher baseline plasma norepinephrine levels (687+/-333 versus 420+/-246 pg/mL, P<0.05) and greater decrease in plasma norepinephrine in response to bucindolol (-249+/-171 versus -35+/-277 pg/mL, P<0.05).", 
    "22": "This study suggests a direct relationship between contractile reserve and improvement in LVEF with beta-blocker therapy in patients with advanced CHF.

    "23": "The aim of this work was to demonstrate an alteration of the anterior hypothalamic catecholaminergic system in aortic coarctated (ACo) rats by the perfusion of beta-adrenergic antagonist and the microinfusion of beta-adrenergic agonist. Wistar urethane-chloralose anesthetized rats were used. The carotid artery was cannulated for blood pressure recording and changes in blood pressure were measured. A concentric microdialysis probe was inserted in the anterior hypothalamus. Metoprolol (a beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist) perfusion (6 microg ml(-1)) reduced the mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the ACo rats but not in sham operated (SO) animals. The anterior hypothalamic infusion of non-specific beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol induced a dose-dependent decrease of blood pressure in both experimental groups, but the depressor response was significantly lower in ACo rats. The pretreatment with atenolol, a selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, increased the depressor effect of isoproterenol in ACo rats, but not in SO rats. On the other hand, the hypotensive action of isoproterenol was significantly diminished after the administration of non-specific beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol in SO and ACo rats. The anterior hypothalamic infusion of clenbuterol, a selective beta(2)-adrenergic agonist, induced a dose-dependent decrease of blood pressure in both experimental groups. The depressor response to clenbuterol (1 nmol) was significantly lower in ACo rats than in SO rats. In summary, this study provides the evidence that there is a beta(1)-adrenergic compromise in anaesthetized ACo rats and this compromise may be involved in the maintenance of hypertension. On the other hand, this study also suggests the existence of pressor beta(1)-adrenoceptors in the anterior hypothalamic area of ACo rats but not in SO rats. We also found a diminished depressor beta(2)-adrenergic activity in ACo rats.", 
    "24": "We showed that norepinephrine (NE) hampers IL-12 and stimulates IL-10 production via adrenoceptors (ARs) in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) influencing their Th priming ability. Others have shown that Langerhans cells (LC) express mRNA for beta1-, beta2- and alpha1(A)-(ARs) and that catecholamines may inhibit the antigen-presenting capability via beta2-ARs. Here, we show that also BMDC express mRNA for beta1-, beta2-, alpha2(A)- and alpha2(C)-ARs. Inhibition of IL-12 is mediated by both beta2- and alpha2(A)-ARs, while stimulation of IL-10 by beta2-ARs only. In addition, LC migration, the contact hypersensitivity response (CHS) and production of IFN-gamma and IL-2 in draining lymph node cells is increased in mice treated topically with the beta2-AR antagonist ICI 118,551 during FITC sensitization. Activation of beta2-ARs in BMDC before adoptive transfer could reduce both migration and CHS response to FITC. Finally, preincubation of BMDC with LPS in presence of the specific beta2-AR agonist salbutamol impaired their chemotactic response to CCL19 and CCL21 and this effect was neutralized by anti-IL-10 mAb. We suggest that the physiological activation of beta2-ARs in DC (LC) results in stimulation of IL-10 which in turn restrains DC (LC) migration influencing antigen presentation and the consequent CHS response.", 
    "25": "The role of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins such as multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs) is critical in drug resistance in cancer cells and in plant detoxification processes. Due to broad substrate spectra, specific modulators of these proteins are still lacking. Sulfonylureas such as glibenclamide are used to treat non-insulin-dependent diabetes since they bind to the sulfonylurea receptor. Glibenclamide also inhibits the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, p-glycoprotein in animals and guard cell ion channels in plants. To investigate whether this compound is a more general blocker of ABC transporters the sensitivity of ABC-type transport processes across the vacuolar membrane of plants and yeast towards glibenclamide was evaluated. Glibenclamide inhibits the ATP-dependent uptake of beta-estradiol 17-(beta-D-glucuronide), lucifer yellow CH, and (2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6-)carboxyfluorescein. Transport of glutathione conjugates into plant but not into yeast vacuoles was drastically reduced by glibenclamide. Thus, irrespective of the homologies between plant, yeast and animal MRP transporters, specific features of plant vacuolar MRPs with regard to sensitivity towards sulfonylureas exist. Glibenclamide could be a useful tool to trap anionic fluorescent indicator dyes in the cytosol.", 
    "26": "It has been suggested that an extensive contractile reserve identified recognised by means of dobutamine stress echocardiography may predict a better prognosis in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction at rest. However, the clinical use of dobutamine stress echocardiography may be limited in patients with chronic heart failure by the substantial proportion of such patients treated with beta-blockers, since the inotropic response to adrenergic stimulation is known to be attenuated in patients receiving beta-adrenoceptor blockers. Enoximone is a positive inotropic agent that inhibits cyclic adenosine monophosphate-specific phosphosdiesterase. We therefore tested the hypothesis that enoximone may be an alternative to dobutamine in evaluating left ventricular contractile reserve in patients with systolic dysfunction on chronic beta-blocker therapy.",

Regional peak systolic velocities were evaluated by means of tissue Doppler imaging in four basal and four medium level segments. In the noBB group, they increased more with dobutamine than with enoximone in three of the eight segments; no significant differences were found in the BB group. Dobutamine induced non-sustained ventricular tachycardia in three patients and supraventricular tachycardia in one, whereas enoximone did not induce any repetitive arrhythmias.",

    "30": "The influence of emotion on human memory is associated with two contradictory effects in the form of either emotion-induced enhancements or decrements in memory. In a series of experiments involving single word presentation, we show that enhanced memory for emotional words is strongly coupled to decrements in memory for items preceding the emotional stimulus, an effect that is more pronounced in women. These memory effects would appear to depend on a common neurobiological substrate, in that enhancements and decrements are reversed by propranolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, and abolished by selective bilateral amygdala damage. Thus, our findings suggest that amygdala-dependent beta-adrenergic modulation of episodic encoding has costs as well as benefits.", 
    "31": "Biologically adhesive delivery systems offer important advantages over conventional drug-delivery systems. In this paper, microspheres intended as a sustained release carrier for oral or nasal administration have been prepared by associating a known bioadhesive polymer, poly(acrylic acid), in gelatin microspheres. A model drug oxprenolol hydrochloride was chosen. It was found that some of the formulation variables can influence the characteristics of the beads in a controlled manner. The internal structure of the microspheres studied by X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis and optical microscopy showed the absence of drug crystals in microspheres and a lowering in the glass transition temperature. The dynamic swelling of the beads obeyed the square root of time and a shift from the diffusional to the relaxational process dependent on the content of poly(acrylic acid) in gelatin microspheres was observed. As expected, drug release from gelatin/poly(acrylic acid) microspheres was influenced by the poly(acrylic acid) content in beads, by the particle size of microspheres and by the pH of the medium. The mechanism of release was analysed by applying the empirical exponential equation and by calculation of the approximate contribution of the diffusional and relaxational mechanisms to the anomalous release process by fitting the data to the coupled Fickian/Case II equation. In vitro and in vivo experiments in rats showed good adhesive characteristics of the gelatin/poly(acrylic acid) microspheres, which were greater if the poly(acrylic acid) content was greater. A significant retardation in gastric and intestinal emptying time of the beads was observed. This was also suggested by the bioavailability of the model drug after intragastric and intranasal administration of the microspheres. The pharmacokinetic parameters after microsphere administration were more appropriate to a slow release drug-delivery system. The work suggests the potential of this pharmaceutical delivery system as an alternative controlled-release dosage form, either for oral or nasal administration.",

    "33": "We reviewed the number of new, refill, and total prescriptions of all antiarrhythmic agents in the United States from April 2000-December 2001 to assess use of dofetilide and Betapace AF in the drug market. Both were prescribed very infrequently throughout the study period. In addition, the infrequent reported use of these drugs for patients with atrial fibrillation and flutter indicated poor acceptance of these agents by prescribing physicians. We speculated that the restricted distribution and required educational program for dofetilide, as well as the availability of generic sotalol products, may have discouraged physicians from prescribing both dofetilide and Betapace AE CONCLUSION: A common goal for both the dofetilide risk-management program and the creation of a sotalol product indicated solely for atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter was to provide safer treatment for patients with these arrhythmias. Unfortunately, limited penetration of dofetilide and Betapace AF into the U.S. market suggests that drugs without a risk-management program or detailed dosing guidelines were more likely than dofetilide or Betapace AF to be selected for treatment of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.",

Cerebral and metabolic causes of syncope's were excluded and the patient was diagnosed to have sick sinus syndrome. After implantation of the cardiac pacemaker the treatment with sotalol was started. After introducing the antiarrhythmic drug the frequency of syncopes increased dramatically and blood pressure rose unusually (up to 250/140 mm Hg). Subsequently phaeochromocytoma was suspected. Laboratory data as well as computed tomography confirmed the diagnosis of left adrenal tumour. After successful surgery the blood pressure normalized and the patient recovered uneventfully.

The avoidance of high peak plasma concentrations with metoprolol succinate is associated with lesser degree of adverse effects and may improve patients compliance.

If the cutoff level for urinary TGFBeta1 excretion was 250 pg/min, the 4-year positive predictive value (PPV) with respect to the development of chronic allograft nephropathy was 83% and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 78% (sensitivity [sen.], 71%; specificity [sp.], 88%). If the cutoff level for PRA at 60 min after ACE-I was 4.0 ng/ml per h, the 4-year PPV was 71% and NPV was 75% (sen., 70%; sp., 75%).

Interestingly, the percentage of HLA-DR-positive cells was not significantly increased upon treatment with unpreserved betablocker. However, the percentage of IL-6- and IL-8-positive cells as well as IL-6 and IL-8 expression levels was significantly higher in patients than in controls, regardless of the treatment type and the presence of preservative. A significant positive correlation was found between HLA-DR and cytoplasmic IL-6 expression, between HLA-DR and cytoplasmic IL-8 as well as between IL-6 and IL-8 cytoplasmic expressions.", 
    "55": "The present study confirms that there is an increased expression of HLA-DR in treated glaucoma patients compared to controls and demonstrates that antiglaucoma treatments lead to increased IL-6 and IL-8 expressions. It also indicates that benzalkonium-preserved eyedrops and preserved multitherapy may induce stronger inflammatory responses than do unpreserved eyedrops, although further studies are needed to determine the respective inflammatory role of preservative and therapeutic molecules. In this study, flow cytometry was used to detect the intracellular pro-inflammatory cytokines in conjunctival cells obtained by impression cytology.

    "59": "Acute variceal hemorrhage is the most lethal complication of cirrhosis. The reported mortality rate from a first episode of variceal hemorrhage is 17% to 57%. Management of varices can be categorized into three phases: 1) prevention of initial bleeding, 2) management of acute bleeding, and 3) prevention of rebleeding. Modalities for treatment include pharmacologic, endoscopic, and shunt therapy. For the prevention of first variceal hemorrhage, cirrhotic patients should undergo endoscopy to identify patients with large varices. Priority for screening for varices should be given to patients with low platelet count, splenomegaly, and advanced cirrhosis. Once large varices are identified, patients should be started on beta-blocker therapy, which reduces the risk of bleeding by 50%. If pharmacologic therapy is not tolerated or contraindicated, endoscopic band ligation should be performed, and surveillance of varices should be performed every 6 months thereafter. Shunt procedures are not indicated due to their higher rates of complications compared with medical therapy. For the management of acute variceal hemorrhage, patients should be started on prophylactic intravenous antibiotics and intravenous octreotide. Endoscopy should be performed to diagnose and treat variceal hemorrhage. Band ligation appears to be as effective as sclerotherapy, but with less complications. If hemostasis is not achieved, balloon tamponade can be used as a bridge to definitive therapy, which in this case would be a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). If TIPS is unavailable, a surgical shunt is indicated. Once an episode of acute bleeding has been controlled, variceal eradication is best accomplished with repeat band ligation every 10 to 14 days until varices are obliterated. Prevention of recurrent bleeding can be achieved with beta-blocker therapy. The addition of isosorbide mononitrate further reduces recurrent bleeding. This combination pharmacologic therapy has been shown to be superior to sclerotherapy and may be superior to band ligation. However, side effects of combination pharmacologic therapy may limit its effectiveness. Band ligation is preferred to sclerotherapy when considering endoscopic therapy due to less complications and lower cost. Surgical shunts should be used for prevention of rebleeding in patients who do not tolerate or are noncompliant with medical therapy and who have relatively preserved liver function. TIPS should be reserved for patients who have poor liver function and who have failed medical therapy.",

CIBIS-II, COPERNICUS, and MERIT-HF have shown that beta-blocker treatment with bisoprolol, carvedilol, and metoprolol XL, respectively, reduce mortality in advanced heart failure patients, whereas BEST found a statistically nonsignificant trend toward reduced mortality with bucindolol. We conducted a post hoc analysis to determine whether the response to beta-blockade in BEST could be related to differences in the clinical and demographic characteristics of the study populations. We generated a sample from BEST to resemble the patient cohorts studied in CIBIS-II and MERIT-HF to find out whether the response to beta-blocker therapy was similar to that reported in the other trials. These findings are further compared with COPERNICUS, which entered patients with more severe heart failure.",

Results were compared with those of conventional coronary angiography performed previously. MDCT provided clear visualization of coronary artery aneurysms, with coronary calcifications but which had not yet progressed to stenotic lesions.

Despite resolution in most of these patients by 1 year, approximately 30% of the SVT will recur. We performed a retrospective review of all patients <1 year of age with SVT between January 1984 and December 2000. Recurrence was defined as documented SVT at >1 year of age. Patients were divided into: (1) a first line (FL) group (controlled with digoxin and/or propranolol) and (2) a second line (SL) group (requiring additional antiarrhythmics). The groups were divided based on the presence of preexcitation. The FL group included 116 patients, 20 of whom (17%) had Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. The SL group included 34 patients, 21 of whom (62%) had WPW (p <0.001). Recurrence of SVT occurred in 32 patients (28%) in the FL group and in 23 patients (68%) in the SL group (p <0.001). SVT recurred in 36 of 41 patients (88%) with WPW compared with 19 of 109 patients (17%) without WPW syndrome (p <0.001). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the presence of WPW syndrome was associated with a 29-fold higher odds of SVT recurrence (p <0.001), and that patients with WPW syndrome were more likely to require additional antiarrhythmic therapy (p <0.001). Thus, patients with WPW syndrome who had SVT at <1 year of age have 29-fold higher odds of recurrence at >1 year of age versus those patients with preexcitation. These patients are also more likely to require additional antiarrhythmic therapy to control SVT. Furthermore, children with WPW syndrome who are refractory to treatment with digoxin and/or propranolol are at increased risk of SVT recurrence.",

Significant changes in inflammatory cytokines/chemokines (IL-1beta, TNFalpha, IL-1ra, IL-6, and MIP-1beta, MCP-1) were observed following each manipulation, but qualitative and quantitative differences were seen. Interestingly, only physical stress was associated with measured increases in serum corticosterone levels, and with independent evidence (using in vitro immune allostimulation) for a generalized immunosuppression secondary to the experimental manipulation. Our data suggest that altered cytokine production following sleep perturbation occurs by a different mechanism from that (HPA axis) commonly attributed to stress per se.",

Patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma from 21 to 85 years of age were enrolled in this study. Each of them should have intraocular pressure (IOP) of 20 mmHg or more in the study eye after they completed the wash-out period. The patients enrolled were randomly assigned to either combination (0.5% timolol/2.0% MK-507 b.i.d. and placebo b.i.d.) or concomitant (0.5% timolol b.i.d. and 2.0% MK-507 b.i.d.) treatment. During the study, no systemic or topical medication affecting IOP other than test drugs were allowed. A total of 20 randomized patients were included in the intention-to-treat population for analysis of data. The ten were assigned to the combination treatment and others were assigned to the concomitant treatment. There was no statistically significant difference between the two study treatments in terms of gender distribution, average age, and average IOP at the trough and the peak before starting the test medications. Mean reduction of the IOP from baseline to the final visit at the trough was 5.04 mmHg in the combination treatment and was 2.73 mmHg in the concomitant treatment. Mean reduction of the IOP at the peak was 2.19 mmHg in the combination treatment and was 2.53 mmHg in the concomitant treatment. There were no statistically significant differences in the above analyses between the two treatments. Safety evaluation was carried out, and number of adverse events in each treatment group did not differ substantially. Ocular signs and symptoms were evaluated in each visit, and all of the between-treatment values were not different significantly, either. Laboratory tests were performed, and showed no significant differences between pre- and post-treatment periods. None of these was found to be clinically serious, either. We concluded that the 0.5% timolol/2.0% MK-507 combination b.i.d. is equivalent in the efficacy of lowering IOP as well as safety compared to the concomitant administration of 0.5% timolol b.i.d. and 2.0% MK-507 b.i.d. in patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma.",

Under a lighting regimen with 12h of darkness, there was a two- to four-fold increase in phosphorylated levels of MAPK kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) and p42/44(MAPK) 2h after onset of darkness, an increase that was sustained for 8h. The increases in phosphorylated levels of MEK1/2 and p42/44(MAPK) occurred without increases in MEK1/2 and p42/44(MAPK) proteins. When rats were treated with propranolol 1h before onset of darkness or subjected to continuous light exposure during the dark phase, the nocturnal increase in MEK1/2 and p42/44(MAPK) phosphorylation was reduced. Acute light exposure during darkness caused a decline in MEK1/2 and p42/44(MAPK) phosphorylation within 30 min of light exposure. These results indicate the presence of a diurnal difference in MEK1/2 and p42/44(MAPK) phosphorylation in the rat pineal gland that is under adrenergic control.", 
    "91": "The incidence of congestive heart failure in the US population is increasing as more women and men survive with chronic hypertensive and atherosclerotic heart disease. Almost half the patients in the US with heart failure are women. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cigarette smoking are all more potent risk factors for the development of heart failure in women than in men. Important differences in presentation and mortality explain gender differences in the clinical course of heart failure. Overall mortality is lower for women than for men with symptomatic heart failure. Some but not all of this difference can be explained by a lower rate of ischemic heart disease. Standard treatments for congestive heart failure, including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers, have been shown to be equally efficacious in men and in women. Preliminary data on angiotensin II receptor blockers suggests equivalent benefit with further trial data awaited. Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a form of heart failure unique to women, occurring in the last stages of pregnancy or within 5 months after delivery. Approximately half of affected women regain normal ventricular function but for those who do not, the risk of recurrent symptomatic heart failure and mortality during subsequent pregnancies is high.",

After a 4-week wash-out period on placebo, they were randomized to receive atenolol 50 mg or losartan 50 mg for 24 weeks according to a parallel arm design. At the end of the placebo period and of each active treatment period, BP was measured (by mercury sphygmomanometer, Korotkoff I and V) and cognitive function was evaluated through three different tests (word list memory, word list recall and word list fluency). Both atenolol and losartan were equally effective in reducing SBP (-22.1 and -23.1 mmHg, respectively, P< 0.01 vs baseline) and DBP (-10.3 and -11.2 mmHg, respectively, P< 0.01 vs baseline). Atenolol treatment did not induce significant changes in any test score, whereas losartan significantly increased the score of both the word list memory (+2.2, P<0.05 vs baseline) and the word list recall test (+2.1, P<0.05 vs baseline). The comparison between losartan and atenolol was significant (P<0.05) for both memory tests.

Twenty-seven male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: nephrectomized group, nephrectomized losartan-treated group and nephrectomized atenolol-treated group.

Angiotensin receptor antagonist losartan (180 mg/L) or beta-blocking agent atenolol (750 mg/L) was added to the drinking water and treatment was started on the first day after the operation. Systolic blood pressure and 24 hour protein excretion was measured every week. Nephrectomized rats had higher proteinuria and systolic blood pressure than the treated rats. Rats were killed 4 weeks after surgery. Early stage renal disease was characterized by glomerular hypertrophy and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The morphological study revealed that ultrastructural changes in the atenolol-treated group were smaller than those in the nephrectomized and losartan-treated groups. Glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickness was significantly increased in losartan-treated (206.8 nm) and atenolol-treated (198.8 nm) rats compared to nephrectomized (169.2 nm) rats. The podocytes demonstrated hypertrophy and foot process effacement, especially in nephrectomized group. In conclusion, our results show that firstly, treatment with losartan and atenolol significantly increased GBM thickening and secondly, treatment with atenolol reduced ultrastructural changes in the podocytes.", 
    "103": "Although certain roles of the sympathetic nervous system have been suggested as possible mechanisms of life-threatening arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, the dynamic electrophysiological response to sympathetic activation remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the dynamic response of action potential duration (APD) to sudden sympathetic stimulation (SYM) using monophasic action potential (MAP) recording. In 10 anesthetized cats, MAPs were continuously recorded from the right ventricular endocardium under constant pacing. The dynamic response of the APD to SYM (3 Hz) were examined before and after the administration of propranolol (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) (n=5) or phentolamine (1.0 mg/kg i.v.) (n=5). In response to SYM, the APD was transiently prolonged by 5.5+/-3.2 ms at 7.0+/-1.3 s, and monotonically shortened toward a steady-state level (-14.5+/-6.9 ms). Propranolol almost abolished both the transient prolongation (6.6+/-4.5 to 0.2+/-0.4 ms, p<0.05) and the steady-state shortening (-13.7+/-3.6 to -1.1+/-2.4 ms, p<0.005), whereas phentolamine did not have a significant effect on the response of APD to SYM. These findings might partly account for the propensity of ventricular arrhythmias to occur immediately after sudden sympathetic activation.", 
    "104": "The aim of this study was to evaluate whether beta-blocker therapy can be safely administered to and improve cardiac function of elderly patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Echocardiography and measurement of the concentrations of natriuretic peptides were carried out in 67 patients with DCM before and after 6 months of beta-blocker therapy: 20 patients >/=65 years of age (older group); 47 <65 years of age (younger group). In all patients, beta-blocker was safely administered and well tolerated. There was no significant difference in the dose of beta-blocker between 2 groups. A reduction in the left ventricular dimensions and an associated increase in ejection fraction occurred in both treatment groups. The beta-blocker treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the concentrations of natriuretic peptides in both groups. In conclusion, beta-blocker therapy is well-tolerated and has similar effects on cardiac function in older and younger patients with DCM.", 
    "105": "The purpose of this study was to test a hypothesis that T-wave alternans (TWA) is improved in association with an improvement in cardiac sympathetic nervous system and systolic function by oral beta-blocker therapy in patients with non-ischemic heart disease (NIHD). TWA testing, (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging and echocardiography were performed at the baseline and 3 months after beta-blocker therapy in 26 patients with NIHD and positive TWA. The alternans voltage (V(alt)), the heart-to mediastinal-ratio on the early (e-H/M) and delayed (d-H/M) images, the washout rate (WR), the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and the calculated rate of change by beta-blocker therapy in each parameter (ie, deltaV(alt), deltae-H/M, deltad-H/M, deltaWR and deltaLVEF) were measured. After therapy, TWA turned negative in 8 patients (group A) and remained positive in 18 (group B); V(alt) was significantly decreased in group B (p<0.001). In group A, e-H/M, d-H/M and LVEF were significantly increased (e-H/M: p<0.05, d-H/M and LVEF: p<0.01), as were e-H/M and LVEF in group B (p<0.05). There were significant correlations between deltaV(alt) and deltae-H/M (r=-0.61, p<0.01), deltad-H/M (r=-0.82, p<0.0001), deltaWR (r=0.60, p<0.01) and deltaLVEF (r=-0.70, p<0.01). In patients with NIHD, the TWA is improved in association with the improvement in cardiac sympathetic nervous system abnormalities and left ventricular systolic dysfunction by beta-blocker therapy.", 
    "106": "Non-noxious cooling stimuli were delivered to the shaved back of urethane-chloralose-anaesthetized, artificially ventilated rats using a plastic bag containing water at 24-40 degrees C. Cooling of the skin by 2-6 degrees C increased the rate of whole body oxygen consumption (.V(O(2)) and triggered electromyographic (EMG) activity recorded from the neck or femoral muscles. The cooling-induced (.V(O(2)) responses did not depend on core (colonic) temperature and followed skin temperature in a graded manner. Pretreatment with the beta-blocker propranolol (10 mg kg(-1), i.v.) greatly attenuated the (.V(O(2)) response but did not affect the EMG response. On the other hand, pretreatment with the muscle relaxant pancuronium bromide (2 mg kg(-1), i.v.) affected the (.V(O(2)) response very slightly but completely abolished the EMG activity. Accordingly, the cooling stimulus activated mainly non-shivering thermogenesis. Next, the contribution of the cerebral cortex to the cooling-induced thermogenesis was examined. Power spectral analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG) showed that the cooling stimulus largely inhibited delta (0.5-3 Hz) waves, enhanced theta (3-8 Hz) waves, and slightly increased frequencies higher than 8 Hz. Pinching the hindpaw elicited changes in EEG similar to those elicited by skin cooling but did not increase the (.V(O(2)). Therefore, there was no relationship between changes in the EEG and the magnitude of thermogenesis. Finally, skin cooling increased the (.V(O(2)) of decorticated rats but did not increase that of decerebrated rats. The results suggest that the subcortical forebrain structure, but not cortical activation, is indispensable for non-shivering thermogenesis elicited by cooling stimulation of the skin.", 
    "107": "Locally released cytokines contribute to beta-cell dysfunction and apoptosis in type 1 diabetes. In vitro exposure of insulin-producing INS-1E cells to the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta + interferon (IFN)-gamma leads to a significant increase in apoptosis. To characterize the genetic networks implicated in beta-cell dysfunction and apoptosis and its dependence on nitric oxide (NO) production, we performed a time-course microarray analysis of cytokine-induced genes in insulin-producing INS-1E cells. INS-1E cells were exposed in duplicate to IL-1beta + IFN-gamma for six different time points (1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h) with or without the inducible NO synthase (iNOS) blocker N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMA). The microarray analysis identified 698 genes as cytokine modified (>or=2.5-fold change compared with control) in at least one time point. Based on their temporal pattern of variation, the cytokine-regulated genes were classified into 15 clusters by the k-means method. These genes were further classified into 14 different groups according to their putative function. Changes in the expression of genes related to metabolism, signal transduction, and transcription factors at all time points studied indicate beta-cell attempts to adapt to the effects of continuous cytokine exposure. Notably, several apoptosis-related genes were modified at early time points (2-4 h) preceding iNOS expression. On the other hand, 46% of the genes modified by cytokines after 8-24 h were NO dependent, indicating the important role of this radical for the late effects of cytokines. The present results increase by more than twofold the number of known cytokine-modified genes in insulin-producing cells and yield comprehensive information on the role of NO for these modifications in gene expression. These data provide novel and detailed insights into the gene networks activated in beta-cells facing a prolonged immune assault.", 
    "108": "While disease management has been described as an important strategy for the care of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) in the managed care setting, little is known about the impact of this approach on overall health-related quality of life. In this study the Short Form 36 (SF-36) was administered to all patients entering CHF disease management at the time of program entry and at 1 year following entry. Scores on the eight subscales and the two composite scales were calculated and compared before and after. Patients were enrolled from a mixed-model health maintenance organization (HMO) with 34,740 Medicare + Choice enrollees residing in 38 counties in central and northeastern Pennsylvania. Two hundred sixty-eight continuously enrolled patients in an HMO-sponsored CHF disease state management program with completed baseline and follow-up SF-36 surveys were sampled. All patients entered into disease management received primary care based, nurse-directed education about CHF self-management including instruction on etiology of CHF, the importance of medication compliance, home care services if indicated, monitoring weight gain, increased understanding of the warning signs of worsening CHF, and coaching on strategies to contact a physician in a timely manner when CHF worsens. Nurses also facilitated for CHF guidelines among primary care physicians, including the need to obtain a baseline assessment of cardiac function, prescribe angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta blockers when appropriate, and initiated appropriate specialist referral. Compared with enrollees who did not complete a pair of SF-36 surveys, the 268 respondents were younger and had a significantly higher rate of cardiac imaging as well as use of ACE inhibitors and beta blocker medications. Analysis of the SF-36 data revealed that three of the eight (Role Physical, General Health Perceptions, and Role Emotional) subscales increased in a statistically significant manner, as did the Mental Health Composite Score. No statistically significant declines in SF-36 scores were observed. Despite limitations to our study, we found disease management for patients with CHF can be associated with significant improvements in quality of life as measured by the SF-36. Compared with nonrespondents, respondents had a higher prevalence of cardiac imaging, ACE inhibitor use, and beta blocker medication use. Our findings are also limited by a lack of a control group with the possibility that the improvements we observed were unrelated to the disease management intervention. However, our findings and success with the use of this tool indicate the SF-36 can be an important part of the ongoing assessment of patients in a disease management program for CHF.", 
    "109": "The status of phospholamban (PLB) phosphorylation in the ischemia-reperfused hearts remains controversial. Although a decrease in the phosphorylation of both PLB residues (Ser16, PKA site, and Thr17, CaMKII site) was previously reported, experiments from our laboratory failed to detect this decrease. In an attempt to elucidate the cause for this discrepancy, experiments were performed in Langendorff-perfused rat hearts with two main goals: (1) To determine whether keeping pacing during ischemia, a protocol followed in other ischemia-reperfusion models, decreases the phosphorylation of PLB residues, below pre-ischemic values; (2) To investigate whether a maximal beta-adrenergic challenge allows to detect a decrease in the ability of PLB to be phosphorylated in ischemia-reperfused hearts. Hearts were submitted to a global ischemia/reperfusion protocol (20/30 min) with (P) or without (NP) pacing during ischemia, and phosphorylation of PLB residues was assessed by immunodetection. The recovery of contractility upon reperfusion was lower in P vs. NP hearts. Ser16 of PLB, was phosphorylated at the end of ischemia in NP hearts. This increase appeared earlier in P hearts and was significantly diminished by catecholamine depletion and beta-blockade. Thr17 site was phosphorylated at the beginning of ischemia and the onset of reperfusion. The ischemia-induced phosphorylation of Thr17 was higher and more sustained in P vs. NP hearts, and inhibited by the calcium channel blocker, nifedipine, whereas the reperfusion-induced increase in Thr17 phosphorylation was similar in P and NP hearts and was significantly diminished by the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger inhibitor KB-R7943. Phosphorylation of PLB residues did not decrease below basal levels at any time during ischemia and reperfusion. However, the phosphorylation, inotropic and lusitropic response to beta-adrenergic stimulation was significantly decreased both in P and NP hearts.",

    "111": "The study population consisted of 14 healthy volunteers. To obtain pretreatment baseline values, we determined the radius of the tear meniscus (RTM) by meniscometry; the noninvasive breakup time (NIBUT) of the precorneal tear film with a tear specular microscope; and corneal fluorescein uptake with a fluorophotometer. Levobunolol hydrochloride (0.5%) or timolol maleate solution (0.5%) was instilled twice daily for 4 weeks into 1 eye; the contralateral eye was treated with the other topical drug twice daily for the same period. At the end of the study period, the same tests were performed, and the pre- and posttreatment results were compared.", 
    "112": "Timolol solution did, and levobunolol did not, significantly reduce NIBUT from the baseline values. RTM was significantly decreased by treatment with either timolol or levobunolol solution. Corneal fluorescein uptake was not significantly changed, although it was higher after treatment with both topical drugs.", 
    "113": "Four-week treatment with timolol solution resulted in significant instability of the precorneal tear film. Both timolol and levobunolol solution significantly decreased tear volume on the ocular surface. These results indicate that levobunolol solution applied twice daily has equal effects on the tear volume and corneal epithelial barrier function as does timolol solution applied twice daily and that it affects precorneal tear film stability less than timolol solution.", 
    "114": "The effects of ivabradine, a novel heart rate-reducing agent that inhibits the cardiac pacemaker current If, were compared with those of the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol, in a model of exercise-induced regional myocardial ischemia in pigs. Five Yucatan micropigs were chronically instrumented to measure hemodynamics, regional myocardial contractility, and local electrograms, and a fixed stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery was induced using a clip. Each animal underwent three experiments on different days, each consisting of two treadmill exercise sessions, 4 hours apart. Ivabradine 5 mg/kg, propranolol 5 mg/kg, or vehicle was administered orally 3 hours before the second exercise session. Exercises before treatment and after vehicle produced reproducible hemodynamic changes and regional myocardial ischemia in the area perfused by the stenosed coronary artery, indicated by ST segment shift and regional contractile dysfunction. Ivabradine and propranolol were equipotent in reducing heart rate at rest and limiting tachycardia during exercise. Ivabradine, unlike propranolol, did not reduce left ventricular contractility at rest or during exercise, and did not increase atrio-ventricular conduction time. Both compounds reduced the exercise-induced ST segment shift in the ischemic region by approximately 80%, but ivabradine preserved systolic shortening to a significantly greater degree than propranolol (P < 0.05).", 
    "115": "Antinociceptive effects of various neuroleptics in animal acute pain-models have been described, mediated trough different pathways including the opioid system. In this study, we assessed the antinociceptive effects of the atypical neuroleptic drug amisulpride, which acts as a selective blocker of dopamine D2 and D3 receptors. Furthermore, at low doses amisulpride has a selective preference for presynaptic dopamine autoreceptors, while at high doses it manifests a preferential action at post-synaptic dopamine receptors. We found amisulpride to be a potent antinociceptor agent in the mouse tail-flick assay, with an ED50 of 36.6 mg/kg. This effect was antagonized by naloxone (P<0.05), indicating an involvement of opioid mechanisms as mediators of the antinociceptive effect of amisulpride. Beta-funaltrexamine (mu1- and mu2-opioid receptor antagonist), naloxonazine (selective mu1-opioid receptor antagonist), naltrindole (selective delta-opioid receptor antagonist), Nor-binaltorphamine (kappa1-opioid receptor antagonist) reversed amisulpride antinociception at the same dose that they antagonized morphine's antinociceptive effect (all P<0.005). We found that the sensitivity of amisulpride-induced antinociception is mediated through selective involvement of all three opioid receptor subtypes. Based on previous studies with risperidone, clozapine and olanzapine we tend to attribute this global interaction with the opioid system to amisulpride's action at the dopamine D2 receptor sites.", 
    "116": "The pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6 have been shown to be upregulated in the myocardium after injury and after adrenergic receptor stimulation. Together with other cytokines, such as the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, the pro-inflammatory cytokines have been implicated in the initiation of tissue repair and wound healing after myocardial infarction (MI). In the present study, the effect of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol (2 mg/kg x h s.c. by miniosmotic pumps) on cardiac cytokine expression and on wound healing was analyzed in rats from 6-72 h after MI. IL-1beta and IL-6 gene expression strongly increased in the infarcted myocardium 6 h after MI and peaked after 12 h, while TGF-beta, progressively increased from 12 h onwards. Also, TGF-beta2 increased after 12 h, peaked after 24 h and declined thereafter, while TGF-beta, was only elevated after 72 h. Treatment with propranolol had a negative chronotropic effect throughout the observation period of 72 h. It attenuated the initial elevation in LVEDP and increased cardiac output ultimately. Furthermore, propranolol attenuated IL-1beta mRNA expression, but had not effect on the other cytokines. Moreover, MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity was markedly attenuated by propranolol indicating a delayed resorption of the necrotic tissue and, possibly, collagen turnover. Replacement by scar tissue, however, was not affected as indicated by normal collagen expression.", 
    "117": "Eighteen month old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-rats) showed myocardial dysfunction and autoantibodies directed against the beta1-adrenoceptor similarly as known in human dilated cardiomyopathy or Chagas' disease. The agonist-like antibodies were able to activate the beta1-adrenoceptor mediated signal transduction cascade in cultured rat cardiomyocytes and induced a long-lasting stimulatory effect resulting in a harmful adrenergic overdrive. The antibodies recognized an epitope of the second extracellular loop of the beta1-adrenoceptor identical to that epitope identified in Chagas' disease. In conclusion, our assumption is supported that old SHR-rat are an useful animal model for investigating the role of anti-beta1-adrenoceptor antibodies in the induction of human cardiomyopathy.",

The rapid progression of the disease due to neurohormonal activation can be blunted by use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and beta blockers (BB) with a major impact on morbidity and mortality. Besides CCF, they are also useful in asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) and in prevention of heart failure in high risk patients without LVD. Both ACEI and BB are highly underutilised therapy in CCF and there is an urgent necessity to spread message among the medical fraternity for their enhanced use.",

    "136": "It is well established that the beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2-AR) exhibits a robust ligand-independent activity, whereas this property is considerably weaker in the closely related beta1-AR subtype. To identify the potential domain(s) of beta2-AR responsible for the spontaneous receptor activation, we created three chimeras in which the third intracellular loop (beta1/beta2-Li3) or the carboxyl terminus (beta1/beta2-CT) or both domains (beta1/beta2-Li3CT) of beta1-AR are replaced by the corresponding parts of the beta2-AR. Using adenoviral gene transfer, we individually expressed these beta1/beta2-AR chimeras in mouse cardiomyocytes lacking both native beta1-AR and beta2-AR (beta1/beta2 double knockout), and examined their possible spontaneous activities. Overexpression of these beta1/beta2-AR chimeras markedly elevated basal cAMP accumulation and myocyte contractility in the absence of agonist stimulation compared with those infected by a control adenovirus expressing beta-galactosidase or an adenovirus expressing wild type beta1-AR. These effects were fully reversed by a beta2-AR inverse agonist, (+/-)-1-[2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1H-inden-4-yl)oxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-butanol (ICI 118,551; 5 x 10-7 M), regardless of inhibition of Gi with pertussis toxin, but not by a panel of beta1-AR antagonists, including [2-(3-carbamoyl-4-hydroxyphenoxy)-ethylamino]-3-[4-(1-methyl-4-trifluormethyl-2-imidazolyl)-phenoxy]-2-propanolmethanesulfonate (CGP20712A), betaxolol, bisoprolol, and metoprolol. Furthermore, we have shown that the C-terminal postsynaptic density 95/disc-large/ZO-1 (PDZ) motif of beta1-AR is not responsible for the lack of beta1-AR spontaneous activation, although it has been known that the beta1-AR PDZ motif prevents the receptor from undergoing agonist-induced trafficking and Gi coupling in cardiomyocytes. Taken together, the present results indicate that both the third intracellular loop and the C terminus are involved in beta2-AR spontaneous activation and that either domain seems to be sufficient to confer the receptor spontaneous activity.",

    "145": "A simple spectrophotometric method has been developed for the determination of propranolol hydrochloride in pure as well as in dosage forms. The method is based on the oxidative coupling reaction with 3-methylbenzothiazoline-2-one hydrazone. A mixture of an acidic solution of the chromogenic agent and the drug upon treatment with ceric ammonium sulfate produces an orange color peaking at 496 nm. The absorbance-calibration plot was linear over the range 1-10 microg/ml with minimum detectability (S/N=2) of 0.1 microg/ml (3.38x10(-7) M). The molar absorbitivity was 3.195x10(3) l/M/cm with correlation coefficient (n=10) of 0.9999. The different experimental parameters affecting the development and stability of the color were carefully studied and optimized. The proposed method was applied successfully to the determination of propranolol in its dosage forms. A proposal of the reaction pathway was presented.", 
    "146": "The mechanisms of the beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation induced by dopamine in guinea pig taenia caecum were examined. The relaxant response to dopamine was unaffected by propranolol (10(-8)-10(-5) M) or phentolamine (10(-8)-10(-5) M). Atenolol (3 x 10(-7)-3 x 10(-4) M), butoxamine (10(-7)-10(-4) M), prazosin (10(-8)-10(-5) M), yohimbine (10(-8)-10(-5) M), SCH 23390 (10(-8)-10(-5) M) and haloperidol (10(-8)-10(-5) M) had no effect on the potency of dopamine. The response to dopamine was antagonized in a concentration-dependent manner by bupranolol (3 x 10(-6)-3 x 10(-5) M), and Schild plot of the data revealed the pA2 value of 5.55 and the slope of the regression line was 1.13. These results suggest that the relaxant response to dopamine in the guinea pig taenia caecum is mainly mediated by the beta3-adrenoceptors.",

    "148": "Portal hypertension was induced in all rats by partial portal vein ligation, and after the operation all rats were caged for a 10-week period. Then, animals were divided into three groups and for two weeks medical treatment were administered to the individual groups as follows: Control group, saline 0.5 mL/day, intraperitoneally. Octreotide group, octreotide 100 micrograms/kg/12 hours, subcutaneously. Propranolol group, propranolol 20 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneally. In order to assess the portal hypertensive colopathy, criteria such as mean diameters of dilated vessels in colonic mucosa, and the existence of mucosal edema, capillary ectasia, hyperemia and hemorrhage, inflammation were used.",

    "151": "Knowledge of the sympathetic system is a basic element in the understanding of numerous physiological and physiopathological phenomena. In the two last decades, new pharmacological, biochemical and molecular tools have changed our approach to the roles of beta-adrenoceptors in the cardiovascular system. In the heart, the positive inotropic effect of predominant beta 1-adrenoceptor stimulation is classically recognised. Several studies reveal a significant physiological relevance of the beta 2-adrenoceptor which could activate different signalling pathways in addition to that of cAMP. Moreover, the detection of a third beta-adrenoceptor subtype, beta 3, in human heart, responsible for a negative inotropic effect through a NO signalling pathway, has changed the classically admitted paradigm on the regulation of heart function by the beta-adrenergic system. The identification of atypical beta-adrenoceptors, based on pharmacological tools, led to the discovery of \"putative\" beta 4-adrenoceptors, which constituted a low affinity state of the beta 1-adrenoceptors. In vessels, all beta-adrenoceptors subtypes, beta 1, beta 2 and beta 3, mediated a vasodilation, but the signalling pathway involved in this effect was variable according to their localization (endothelial or smooth muscle cells), the species and the vascular bed. beta-adrenoceptors are involved in several cardiovascular disease and could constitute a determinant therapeutic target. The efficiency of some beta-blockers used in the treatment of heart failure could result from action on beta 3-adrenoceptors. Moreover, a mutation of the beta-adrenoceptor subtype suggested a role in hypertension and diabetes mellitus.", 
    "152": "Propranolol is a lipophilic nonselective beta blocker mainly eliminated via the liver. The specific architectural arrangement of the mammalian lung favors the filtration of so-called pneumophilic drugs out of the blood and retention within the tissue, as shown in particular for amphetamine, amiodarone, imipramine, chlorpromazine, propranolol and local anesthetics. In the current study we tested in vitro the susceptibility of freshly isolated rat type II pneumocytes (RTII), rat alveolar macrophages (RAM), human alveolar macrophages (HAM) and A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cell line (A549) to propranolol (0.001-1 mM). Cytotoxicity was evaluated by changes in membrane integrity (lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] assay) and mitochondrial metabolic activity (reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, MTT) after 3-h and 20-h incubation with propranolol. In all tested lung cells, propranolol caused concentration-dependent decreases of MTT reduction and LDH retention in the fraction of attached cells, which was associated with an increase of LDH activity in the medium and in the fraction of non-attached cells. After 3-h incubation, the reduction of MTT was significantly decreased compared with control at > or = 1 x 10(-4) M in HAM, at > or = 5 x 10(-4) M in A549 and significantly decreased of LDH retention in the fraction of attached cells in HAM and in A549 at > or = 5 x 10(-4) M. After 20-h incubation the reduction of MTT was significantly decreased compared with control at > or = 1 x 10(-6) M in RAM, at > or = 5 x 10(-5) M in RTII and HAM and > or = 5 x 10(-4) M in A549. Propranolol caused a significant decrease of LDH retention in the fraction of attached cells (> or = 5 x 10(-5) M, RAM and RTII; > or = 5 x 10(-4) M, HAM and A549). The cytotoxic effect of propranolol in HAM and A549 was more pronounced after prolongation of incubation time (from 3 h to 20 h). These results showed that rat and human lung cells were sensitive to propranolol concentration < or = 1 mM in vitro. We suppose that the damaging action of propranolol on the lungs might be mediated by physicochemical properties of moiety and its pulmonary metabolites.", 
    "153": "Elderly patients with unstable angina pectoris/non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction should be hospitalized. Precipitating factors should be identified and corrected. Electrocardiogram monitoring is important. Aspirin should be given as soon as possible and continued indefinitely. Clopidogrel should given for up to 9 months in patients in whom an early noninterventional approach is planned or in whom a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is planned. Clopidogrel should be withheld for 5-7 days in patients in whom elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABGS) is planned. A platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor should also be given in addition to aspirin, clopidogrel, and heparin in patients in whom cardiac catheterization and PCI are planned. Patients whose symptoms are not fully relieved with three 0.4-mg sublingual nitroglycerin tablets or spray taken 5 minutes apart and the initiation of an intravenous beta blocker should be treated with continuous intravenous nitroglycerin. Beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be given and continued indefinitely. The benefit of long-acting nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers is limited to symptom control. Intra-aortic balloon pump counterpulsation should be used for severe ischemia that is continuing or occurs frequently despite intensive medical therapy or for hemodynamic instability. Statins should be used if the serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is >or=100 mg/dl and continued indefinitely. Enoxaparin is preferable to intravenous unfractionated heparin in the absence of renal failure and unless CABGS is planned within 24 hours. Thrombolysis is not beneficial. High-risk patients should have an early invasive strategy with CABGS or PCI performed depending on the coronary artery anatomy, left ventricular function, presence or absence of diabetes, and findings on noninvasive testing. Following hospital discharge, patients should have intensive risk factor modification with cessation of smoking, maintenance of blood pressure below 135/85 mmHg, indefinite use of statins if needed to maintain the serum LDL cholesterol <100 mg/dl, intensive control of diabetes, maintenance of optimal weight, and daily exercise. Patients should be treated indefinitely with aspirin, beta blockers, and ACE inhibitors and with clopidogrel for up to 9 months. Nitrates should be given for ischemic symptoms. Hormonal therapy should not be given to postmenopausal women.", 
    "154": "Neurotensin (NT) stimulates Ca2+ release and Ca2+ influx in many cells. Its contractile effects in smooth muscle are inhibited by removal of Ca2+ and by Ca2+ channel blockers (CCBs). To better understand NT signaling in prostate cancer PC3 cells, blockers of voltage-gated and store-operated Ca2+ channels (VGCC and SOCC) were tested for effects on NT-binding and signaling. Eight chemical types of agents, including VGCC-blocker nifedipine and SOCC-blocker SKF-96365 (1-[beta-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-propoxy]-4-methoxyphenyl]-1H-imidazole), enhanced cellular NT binding up to 3-fold, while inhibiting (by congruent with 70%) NT-induced inositol phosphate (IP) formation. The ability to enhance NT binding correlated with the ability to inhibit NT-induced IP formation, and both effects were relatively specific for NT. Although cellular binding for beta2-adrenergic, V1a-vasopressin, and epidermal growth factor receptors was not enhanced by these drugs, bombesin receptor binding was increased approximately equal to 19% and bombesin-induced IP formation was inhibited approximately equal to 15%. One difference was that the effect on NT binding was Ca2+-independent, whereas the effect on IP formation was Ca2+-dependent (in part). The Ca2+-dependent part of the IP response seemed to involve SOCC-mediated Ca2+ influx to activate phospholipase C (PLC)delta, while the Ca2+-independent part probably involved PLCbeta. Photoaffinity labeling of the NT receptor NTR1 was enhanced in CCB-treated cells. NTR1 affinity was increased but NTR1 number and internalization were unchanged. Since CCBs did not alter NT binding to isolated cell membranes, the effects in live cells were indirect. These results suggest that CCBs exert two effects: 1) they inhibit NT-induced IP formation, perhaps by preventing Ca2+ influx-dependent activation of PLCdelta; and 2) they enhance NTR1 affinity by an unexplained Ca2+-independent mechanism.", 
    "155": "Postoperative immunosuppression is partly ascribed to anesthesia and has been suggested to compromise patients' resistance to infection and tumor metastasis. We compared the effects of various anesthetics on natural killer (NK) cell activity and on resistance to experimental metastasis, and studied mediating mechanisms and prophylactic measures. Fischer 344 rats served as controls or were anesthetized for 1 h with ketamine, thiopental, halothane, or propofol. Anesthetized rats were either maintained in normothermia or left to spontaneously reach 33 degrees C-35 degrees C. Rats were then injected IV with MADB106 tumor cells, and 24 h later lung tumor retention was assessed, or 3 wk later, lung metastases were counted. Additionally, the number and activity of circulating NK cells were assessed after anesthesia. All anesthetics, except propofol, significantly reduced NK activity and increased MADB106 lung tumor retention or lung metastases. Hypothermia had no significant effects. Ketamine increased metastasis most potently, and this effect was markedly reduced in rats pretreated with a beta-adrenergic antagonist (nadolol) or with chronic small doses of an immunostimulator (polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic acid). Overall, the marked variation in the NK-suppressive effects of anesthetics seems to underlie their differential promotion of MADB106 metastasis. Prophylactic measures may include perioperative immunostimulation and the use of beta-blockers.", 
    "156": "This study in a rat model of pulmonary metastasis demonstrates that some anesthetics, but not others, increase susceptibility to tumor metastasis, apparently by suppressing natural killer cell activity. Ketamine was most deleterious, and its effects were prevented by peripheral blockade of beta-adrenoceptors combined with low levels of immunostimulation.", 
    "157": "During the performance of dissolution tests with immediate and controlled-release talinolol tablets it was detected that the type of the buffer used as dissolution medium had a strong influence on the solubility and the dissolution behavior of the drug. It was proven that talinolol appeared in different crystal structures with strongly differing solubilities when pure water, acetate, or phosphate buffers were employed as dissolution media. The resulting crystal structures were characterized by means of light microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and X-ray powder diffraction. All methods were adjuvant to detect changes in talinolol crystal structures. The different solubility and dissolution properties of the talinolol salts or modifications may be viewed as a source for its incomplete and variable bioavailability. Furthermore, the food effect, described in the literature, that leads to a decrease in talinolol absorption, could be due to changes in the composition of gastrointestinal fluids leading to different talinolol crystal structures. Furthermore, it was detected that the addition of sodium chloride increases talinolol solubility and accelerates its dissolution from controlled-release tablets at concentrations between 0% and 1.25%, while an addition of sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) as surfactant only had a solubility-improving effect at concentrations > 0.75%. At lower concentrations SDS decreased the solubility of talinolol and notably decelerated its release from controlled-release tablets.",

In 23-year-old woman 4 hours post ingestion cardiorespiratory arrest was stated. Resuscitation procedures were ineffective, she died. Acebutol concentration in postmortem blood was 24.1 mg/l and nifedipine-1.8 mg/l. The second one (19-year-old) was treated successfully, only mild cardiac disturbances were observed. Acebutol concentration in blood was 1.8 mg/l, nifedipine was not stated.", 
    "160": "In contrast to vascular muscles, the contribution of a hypotensive peptide adrenomedullin (AM) to the regulation of visceral smooth muscles is obscure. The content, synthesis, and effects of AM on the muscular tone in rat ileum were explored. It was found that there was immunoreactive AM (301 pg/mg of protein) and AM mRNA expression (162 fg/pg actin mRNA) in the ileum and that AM evoked relaxation in ileal strips (Ki = 0.85 nM) precontracted with serotonin. Antagonists of both AM (AM(22-52)) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP(8-37)) receptors did not affect this AM-induced relaxation, whereas it was suppressed by a selective blocker of beta3-adrenoreceptor (SR 59230A). The AM-induced relaxation was accompanied by a production of cAMP. Antagonists of protein kinases A (KT 5720 and H-7) and an inhibitor of the ATP-dependent K(+)-channels (glibenclamide) attenuated the effect of AM. We suggest that AM is a local regulator of the ileal tone, with an inhibitory action on muscle contraction. AM may activate the beta3-adrenoceptors, resulting in protein kinase A activation, which in turn opens the ATP-dependent K(+)-channels.", 
    "161": "Propafenone is an antiarrhythmic agent with recognized cardiac myocyte repolarizing K+ current inhibitory effects. It has two known electropharmacologically active metabolites, 5-hydroxy- and N-depropylpropafenone, whose K+ current inhibitory effects are less thoroughly elucidated than those of the parent compound. This study characterizes and directly compares the pharmacologic interaction of all three compounds with two key repolarizing K+ currents, the rapidly activating delayed rectifier IKr and the transient outward current Ito, using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique in isolated rabbit ventricular myocytes. All three agents potently inhibited IKr with IC50 values of 0.80 +/-0.14, 1.88 +/-0.21, and 5.78 +/-1.24 microM for propafenone, 5-hydroxypropafenone, and N-depropylpropafenone, respectively, based on reduction of peak tail current amplitude following repolarization from +50 mV to -30 mV. IKr inhibition was concentration- and weakly voltage-dependent, with a time course from channel activation that was well described by a single exponential model and consistent with open channel block. Propafenone and its 5-hydroxy and N-depropyl metabolites also blocked Ito with IC50 values of 7.27 +/-0.53, 40.29 +/-7.55, and 44.26 +/-5.73 microM, respectively, at +50 mV. No significant drug effects were observed with respect to Ito voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation or time course of recovery from inactivation. The preferential interaction of propafenone and its metabolites with IKr relative to Ito in ventricular myocytes sheds new light on the anti- and proarrhythmic activity of propafenone in vivo.", 
    "162": "The antioxidant properties of 4-HO-propranolol (4HOP), a major metabolite of propranolol, were studied and compared with that of propranolol and vitamin E (Trolox). When isolated hepatic microsomal membranes were peroxidized by an iron-catalyzed.OH-generating system [dihydroxyfumarate +Fe (III)], 4HOP potently and concentration-dependently inhibited lipid peroxidation; the IC50 value was 1.1 microM, whereas those for Trolox and propranolol were 4.3 and 168 microM, respectively. When isolated human low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was oxidized by 7.5 microM Cu(II) for 9 h, 4HOP at 3 microM delayed the lag phase significantly by 108 min, which was comparable with that of probucol (98-min delay) but was far greater than that provided by propranolol (6 min) or Trolox (47 min). At 1 microM 4HOP, the delay was 45 min. When confluent cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells were exposed to the Fe-catalyzed oxy-radical system, acute loss of glutathione occurred (55% decrease in 50 min). Pretreatment of the cells with 0.067 to 6.7 microM 4HOP for 30 min provided increasing degrees of protection against the glutathione loss; the EC50 value was 1.2 microM, whereas those for Trolox and propranolol were 7.9 and 49 microM, respectively. The loss of cell survival due to the radical stress was also effectively preserved by 4HOP. In separate experiments, when the endothelial glutathione was oxidatively depleted by a peroxynitrite-generating system (3-morpholinosydnonimine), 4HOP also provided potent protective activities. In conclusion, 4HOP is 4- to 8-fold more potent than vitamin E and >100-fold more active than propranolol as a \"chain-breaking\" antiperoxidatant against membrane and LDL oxidation and can provide superior endothelial cytoprotective efficacy against oxygen- or nitrogen-derived oxidant-mediated cell injury. Being a major metabolite in human and with its plasma level approaching that of propranolol, 4-HO-propranolol may contribute, in part, to the cardiovascular therapeutic benefits of propranolol.", 
    "163": "Chronopharmaceutical capsules, ethylcellulose-coated to prevent water ingress, exhibited clearly different release characteristics when coated by organic or aqueous processes. Organic-coated capsules produced a delayed pulse release, whereas aqueous-coated capsules exhibited less delayed and more erratic release behaviour. Nuclear magnetic resonance microscopy was used to elucidate the internal mechanisms underlying this behaviour by studying the routes of internal water transport and the timescale and sequence of events leading to the pulse. Images showed that the seal between the shell and the tablet plug is a key route of water penetration in these dosage forms. There is evidence for a more efficient seal in the organic-coated capsule, and although some hydration of the contents was evident, erosion of the tablet plug is most probably the controlling factor in timed release. The premature failure of the aqueous-coated capsule appears to be a result of rapid influx of water between plug and capsule with hydration of the low substituted hydroxypropylcellulose expulsion agent. As a result of this, the tablet plug remains intact, but appears unable to be ejected. The resulting significant pressure build-up causes premature release by distortion and splitting of the capsule shell. These events may be aided by a weakening of the aqueous-coated gelatin shell by hydration from the inside, and at the mouth of the capsule where previous electron microscope studies have shown incomplete coating of the inside by the aqueous process."
