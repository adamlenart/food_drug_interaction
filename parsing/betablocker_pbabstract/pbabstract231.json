Among AF patients, there was no difference in mortality between AZ patients and placebo patients (p = 0.82). Fewer AZ patients developed AF than placebo patients (p = 0.04). More AZ patients than placebo patients converted to sinus rhythm, but this difference did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.076).

Initial treatment included a beta-adrenergic blocker (beta-blocker) alone in 24%, a calcium channel blocker alone in 17%, digoxin alone in 16%, a beta-blocker and digoxin in 14%, or a calcium channel blocker and digoxin in 14% of patients. Overall rate control was achieved in 70% of patients given beta-blockers as the first drug (with or without digoxin), 54% with calcium channel blockers (with or without digoxin), and 58% with digoxin alone. Adequate overall rate control was achieved in 58% of patients with the first drug or combination.

    "10": "The identification of radicals trapped in irradiated drugs can be very intricate. A multi-frequency electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) study is proposed to resolve this problem. The Q-band (ca. 34 GHz) comparison with X-band (ca. 9 GHz) did not show significant differences for the four beta-blockers studied (atenolol, esmolol, nadolol and propranolol). The use of a higher frequency (285 GHz) was required. It enabled us to determine the g-tensor values of the radicals present in atenolol and esmolol, respectively, g1 = 2.0086, g2 = 2.0059 and g3 = 2.0021 and g1 = 2.0066, g2 = 2.0044 and g3 = 2.0021. The latter was assigned as a phenoxyl radical, which can not be the case for the former. Therefore, radicals produced in esmolol may result from a more complex mechanism than the abstraction followed by the diffusion of an H atom inside the solid. In addition, two molecules as similar as atenolol and esmolol hydrochloride do not contain the same radicals after irradiation. These two conclusions drawn from the EPR results on beta-blockers show clearly the importance of continuing the investigations on radiolytic mechanisms in solid-state drugs.", 
    "11": "Cardiac rehabilitation is accepted as an important component in the management of heart disease. Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic disease frequently associated to ischemic heart disease and both disease require continuing medical care, aggressive treatment of other risk factors, educational programs for self management of disease to prevent acute complication. The scientific community should offer standard of care for management of diabetic patients with coronary artery disease, and should design new strategies to promote prevention in this high risk patients. The need to define characteristics and peculiar problems of diabetics patients with ischemic heart disease encouraged the Board of the Italian Group of Cardiac Rehabilitation and Prevention (GICR) to set up a working group composed of cardiologists and diabetologists chosen on the basis of their proven specific experience. The document is subdivided in six parts. In the first section is described the cardiovascular risks in patients with diabetes and the importance of post-prandial hyperglycemia and glycemic variability. We analyse also the difference in prevalence of ischemic heart disease in Italian diabetic patients compared with other countries. In the second section we described clinical presentation of ischemic heart disease in diabetic patients such as acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina, and the revascularization procedures (balloon angioplasty and coronary bypass surgery). We analysed the differences between the procedures and the evidence-based results. In patients with myocardial infarction we analysed the evidence-based therapy and specific advantages of aspirin, beta-blockers and ace-inhibitor in diabetic patients. In this section we also posed particular attention to the clinical course of patients who underwent bypass grafting and to the impact of diabetes on short and long-term results and on main intervention-related complications including deep infections, mediastinitis, neurological problems, renal failure. In the third section we evaluated the factors responsible of atherosclerosis progression and their treatment, and we underlined that cardiac rehabilitation is less effective for patients with diabetes mellitus. Suggestions proposed in this paper about risk factors are in line with the recommendations of standards guidelines of American Diabetics Association. In patients with concomitant diabetes and ischemic heart disease we suggest blood pressure <130/80, LDL-cholesterol <100 mg/dl, triglycerides <150 mg/dl and daily physical activity. In the fourth section we analysed therapeutic regimens and management of diabetes. We posed particular attention on insulin therapy in acute phase of myocardial infarction and in recent coronary bypass grafting, and chronic use of oral antidiabetic drugs or insulin. In the fifth section we provided some recommendations on the organization of educational programs and physical activity in these patients. In the last section we provided some information on diagnosis of coronary artery disease in diabetes, aim of screening and in which patients is need to perform diagnostic tests. We described the available diagnostic tests with the differences in each method.", 
    "12": "To verify the hypothesis that the non-conventional partial agonist (-)-CGP12177 binds at two beta(1)-adrenoceptor sites, human beta(1)-adrenoceptors, expressed in CHO cells, were labelled with (-)-[(3)H]-CGP12177. We compared the binding affinity and antagonist potency of 12 clinically used beta-blockers against the cyclic AMP-enhancing effects of (-)-isoprenaline and (-)-CGP12177.(-)-[(3)H]-CGP12177 bound to a high affinity site (H; K(H)=0.47 nM) and low affinity site (L); K(L)=235 nM). (-)-[(3)H]-CGP12177 dissociated from the beta(1)-adrenoceptors with a fast component (k(off)=0.45 min(-1)), consistent with the L-site, and a slow component (k(off)=0.017-0.033 min(-1)), consistent with the H-site. (-)-Isoprenaline and (-)-CGP12177 caused 96-fold and 12-fold maximal increases in cyclic AMP levels with -logEC(50)M of 8.2 and 7.6. (-)-CGP12177 antagonised the effects of (-)-isoprenaline with a pK(B) of 9.9. The beta-blockers antagonised the effects of (-)-isoprenaline more than the effects of (-)-CGP12177 with potency ratios: (-)-atenolol 1,000, (+/-)-metropolol 676, (-)-pindolol 631, (-)-timolol 589, (+/-)-carvedilol 204, (+/-)-oxprenolol 138, (+/-)-sotalol 132, (-)-propranolol 120, (+/-)-bisoprolol 95, (+/-)-alprenolol 81, (+/-)-nadolol 68 and (-)-bupranolol 56. In intact cells the binding constants of beta-blockers, estimated from competition with 3-5 nM (-)-[(3)H]-CGP12177 (binding to the H-site), correlated with the corresponding affinities estimated from antagonism of the (-)-isoprenaline effects. We conclude that (-)-[(3)H]-CGP12177 binds at two sites in the recombinant beta(1)-adrenoceptor. (-)-CGP12177 is an antagonist of catecholamine effects through the H-site and a non-conventional partial agonist through the L-site. beta-blockers are more potent antagonists through the H-site than the L-site.", 
    "13": "Patients who have sustained a myocardial infarction as well as patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary bypass surgery have atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. They will need aggressive secondary prophylaxis, including modification of lifestyle risk factors. Most of these patients should be treated with statins. As clinical events often are manifestations of thrombotic complications, this patient group should be treated with platelet inhibition, anticoagulation, or both. After a myocardial infarction patients should be considered for anticoagulant treatment, for acetylsalicylic acid, or both. After coronary revascularisation acetylsalicylic acid should be considered primarily. If acetylsalicylic acid is contraindicated, clopidogrel is an alternative. After coronary stenting acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel should be prescribed combined, for up to one year afterwards. If indicated, anticoagulant treatment can be added to platelet inhibition. After bypass surgery, anticoagulation is equally effective as acetylsalicylic acid against graft occlusion and can be given alone if indicated. International Normalized Ratio can be aimed at 3.0 when anticoagulation is given alone, at 2.0-2.5 when combined with platelet inhibition. After a myocardial infarction patients should be given a beta-blocker if this is not strongly contraindicated and they also should be considered for ACE inhibitor treatment. These patients also seem to profit from a moderate supplement of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.",

The chromatographic properties of this column were tested with a wide range of structurally diverse racemic compounds and drugs under reverse phases. Separation mechanisms involved are also discussed.", 
    "15": "Blood cell flux (BCF) in ventral pelvic skin capillaries was measured in conscious unrestrained Bufo bufo, using a laser Doppler flowcytometer. Hydrated toads responded to water contact with a small but significant increase in BCF. Dehydration alone did not change the BCF in seat patch skin before water contact. However, water contact by dehydrated toads elicited a rapid 600% increase in BCF. The BCF and water uptake of dehydrated toads rehydrating in water declined over 2 h but remained significantly above the low, constant values measured in hydrated toads. Arginine vasotocin injection in hydrated toads did not change skin BCF, but water uptake increased, and urine production decreased. Injection of the beta -adrenergic agonist isoproterenol increased BCF in hydrated toads by 900% and also increased the rate of water uptake. These increases corresponded in magnitude and duration to the response to water contact observed in dehydrated toads. Injection of dehydrated toads with the beta -adrenergic antagonist propranolol significantly reduced both BCF and water uptake. These results are consistent with an autonomic reflex mediated by skin water potential receptors that regulate blood perfusion of ventral pelvic skin.", 
    "16": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality. Plasma catecholamines are linked to the pathogenesis of hypertension. Pharmacological intervention, including treatment with beta-blockers, reduces cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. In the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study, the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan significantly reduced cardiovascular end points compared to the beta-blocker atenolol. Thus, for the first time, one drug was shown to be superior to another in hypertension. The present substudy examined the effects of atenolol vs losartan treatment on plasma catecholamines at rest and during hyperinsulinaemia in a cohort of 86 LIFE patients. Plasma adrenaline increased significantly from placebo treatment at baseline to year 1 of treatment (P<0.0001), and also during hyperinsulinaemia (P<0.0001). Plasma noradrenaline did not change significantly from placebo treatment at baseline to year 1, but increased significantly during hyperinsulinaemia both at baseline and at year 1 (P<0.0001 for both). There were no differences in plasma catecholamines or the relative changes between the two treatment arms at any stage. In a subset of 42 patients examined also at years 2 and 3, these findings were confirmed during long-term treatment. Thus, losartan had an effect on plasma catecholamines comparable to that with the beta-blocker atenolol in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy at rest and during hyperinsulinaemia. We find it unlikely that a difference in sympathetic activity explains the outcome benefits of losartan over atenolol in the LIFE study.", 
    "17": "The electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely used for detection of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). However, whether changes in ECG LVH during antihypertensive therapy predict changes in LV mass remains unclear. Baseline and year-1 ECGs and echocardiograms were assessed in 584 hypertensive patients with ECG LVH by Sokolow-Lyon or Cornell voltage-duration product criteria at entry into the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) echocardiographic substudy. A >/=25% decrease in Cornell product defined regression of ECG LVH; a <25% decrease defined no significant regression; and an increase defined progression of ECG LVH. Regression of echocardiographic LVH was defined by a >/=20% reduction in LV mass. After 1 year of therapy, 155 patients (27%) had regression of ECG LVH, 286 (49%) had no significant change, and 143 (25%) had progression of ECG LVH. Compared with patients with progression of ECG LVH, patients with no significant decrease and patients with regression of ECG LVH had stepwise greater absolute decreases in LV mass (-16+/-33 vs -29+/-37 vs -32+/-41 g, P<0.001), greater percent reductions in LV mass (-5.7+/-14.6 vs -11.3+/-13.6 vs -12.3+/-15.6%, P<0.001), and were more likely to decrease LV mass by >/=20% (11.2 vs 24.8 vs 36.1%, P<0.001), even after adjusting for possible effects of baseline and change in systolic and diastolic pressures. Compared with progression of ECG LVH, regression of the Cornell product ECG LVH is associated with greater reduction in LV mass and a greater likelihood of regression of anatomic LVH.", 
    "18": "In 1983, carvedilol [1-[carbazolyl-(4)-oxy]-3-[(2-methoxyphenoxyethyl)amino]-2-propanol] was designed and developed as a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with vasodilating activity for efficacious and safe treatment of hypertension and coronary artery disease. Carvedilol belongs to the 'third generation' of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and shows selectivity for the beta1- rather than beta2-adrenoceptor. Carvedilol is also an alpha1-blocking agents, with around 2- to 3-fold more selectivity for beta1- than alpha1-adrenoceptors. This degree of alpha1-blockade is responsible for the moderate vasodilator properties of carvedilol, being different from other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. In addition, carvedilol is a potent antioxidant, with a 10-fold greater activity than vitamin E. Some carvedilol metabolites found in human plasma also exhibit antioxidative activity approximately 50- to 100-fold greater than carvedilol and other antioxidants. These unique properties of carvedilol, i.e. adrenergic (beta1, beta2 and alpha1) blockade and antioxidative activity, may be important in preventing progressive deterioration of left ventricular dysfunction and chronic heart failure. Recently, carvedilol has been demonstrated to reverse multidrug resistance (MDR) to anticancer drugs in tumor cells in vitro and its reversal effects were comparable with verapamil, which has been used in the first clinical trial for the reversal of MDR. This review introduces the reversal activity and usefulness against MDR, as well as an overview of the pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties, of carvedilol.", 
    "19": "This study examined the intestinal transport of five harman alkaloids using the Caco-2 cell monolayer as a model of the human intestinal mucosa. Transport parameters, permeability coefficients and percent transports, were calculated and compared under identical conditions with atenolol. Permeability coefficients were also compared with the reported values for model compounds like mannitol, propranolol and glucose. Sodium fluorescein was used as the marker for paracellular leakage. These alkaloids, in the concentration range of 250-500 microM, demonstrated substantial transport across the monolayer with moderate to high efflux rates and permeability coefficients. The transport was linear with time and was concentration dependent.",

    "21": "One hundred and six patients with mild-to-moderate congestive heart failure treated in 26 Japanese institutes were randomly assigned to the combination therapy or monotherapy. Changes in physical activity (New York Heart Association functional classes, Specific Activity Scale (SAS)), concentrations of neurohumoral factors (plasma renin activity, angiotensin II, aldosterone, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)), and cardiac function for 6 months were compared between the 2 groups. It was found that the combination therapy, which was administered at doses standard in Japan, increased the SAS score (4.5 +/- 1.5 to 4.9 +/- 1.5, p<0.05) and decreased the plasma BNP concentration (183 +/- 163 to 135 +/- 118 pg/ml, p<0.05). In contrast, there were no changes in SAS score (4.5 +/- 1.4 to 4.6 +/- 1.4, NS) or BNP concentration (156 +/- 157 to 151 +/- 185 pg/ml, NS) in the patients receiving monotherapy.",

    "23": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinical arrhythmia and one of the most important factors for ischemic stroke. In general, AF is treated with \"channel-blocking drugs\" to restore sinus rhythm and warfarin is recommended in the majority of patients to prevent atrial thrombus formation and thromboembolic events. In the recent years, a tremendous amount has been learned about the pathophysiology and molecular biology of AF. Thus, pharmacologic interference with specific signal transduction pathways with \"non-channel-blocking drugs\" appears promising as a novel antiarrhythmic approach to maintain sinus rhythm and to prevent atrial clot formation. Therefore, this review will highlight some novel \"nonchannel drug targets\" for AF therapy.", 
    "24": "Chronic cyclosporin (CsA) administration has been shown to result in the replacement of epithelial cells in the kidney with fibrous tissue. These changes are kidney-specific, as they do not occur in any other organ.", 
    "25": "Cyclosporin exposure increases c-fos and c-jun mRNA in the rat kidney but not in the liver. Furthermore, chronic CsA exposure causes a further increase in c-fos and c-jun mRNA and increases the renal expression of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) mRNA. These changes precede the development of fibrosis. The combined insult of ischaemia and CsA resulted in synergistic increases in c-fos, suggesting that CsA recruited a pathway for c-fos activation different from ischaemia. The calcium channel blocker, verapamil, blocked CsA-induced expression of c-fos and c-jun mRNA, and reduced the amount of TGF-beta expression.", 
    "26": "These data are consistent with the notion that CsA induces protooncogenes, which may be, at least partially, responsible for long-term CsA nephrotoxicity.", 
    "27": "Extinction of classically conditioned fear, like its acquisition, is active learning, but little is known about its molecular mechanisms. We recently reported that temporal massing of conditional stimulus (CS) presentations improves extinction memory acquisition, and suggested that temporal spacing was less effective because individual CS exposures trigger two opposing processes: (1) fear extinction, which is favored by CS massing, and (2) fear incubation (increase), which is favored by spacing. We here report the effects of manipulating the adrenergic system during massed or spaced CS presentations in fear-conditioned mice. We administered yohimbine (5 mg/kg), an alpha(2)-receptor antagonist, or propranolol (10 mg/kg), a beta-receptor antagonist, systemically prior to CS presentation sessions and recorded both short- and long-term changes in conditional freezing. Yohimbine treatment facilitated extinction of both cue and context fear with massed protocols. When given before spaced CS presentations, propranolol led to a persistent incubation of cue fear, whereas yohimbine led to persistent extinction, compared with vehicle-treated animals, which showed no change in fear. These results suggest that norepinephrine positively modulates the formation of fear extinction memories in mice. They also provide clear evidence that spaced CS presentations trigger both fear-reducing (extinction) and fear-increasing (incubation) mechanisms.",

All the patients exercised 3 days per week for 5 to 9 months. Attendance exceeded 70%. The training effect was independently evaluated by the change in rate-pressure product at a 5-metabolic equivalent (MET) workload (RPP5), and the change in estimated peak METs (METPK) during treadmill testing. Baseline variables were examined to identify predictors of change in RPP5 and METPK separately using multiple linear regression.",

    "39": "This study was performed to test the hypothesis that activation of protein kinase C (PKC) is a mechanism underlying the acidic pH-induced contraction (APIC) in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) aorta. Changing pH of the bathing solution from 7.4 to 6.5 induced a marked contraction of SHR aorta. PKC inhibitors, GF109203X and calphostin C markedly inhibited the APIC selectively, without having a marked effect on the KCl-induced contraction. Inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, U0126 and PD98059 mildly but significantly attenuated the APIC. However, at the similar concentrations both U0126 and PD98059 inhibited the KCl-induced contraction in a manner similar to that observed in APIC. D-609, an inhibitor of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) markedly inhibited the APIC and the extent of inhibition by this compound was similar to that shown by PKC inhibitors. Whereas, U-73122 and propranolol, inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC and phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, respectively, had no affect on the APIC. A tyrosine kinase inhibitor, tyrphostin 23 and GF109203X inhibited the APIC in an additive manner, and together they abolished the contractile response. From all these results, it is suggested that a significant component of the contraction observed in response to acidosis in SHR aorta is dependent upon the activation of PKC that seems to be the downstream event of the activation of PC-PLC. Furthermore, PKC- and tyrosine kinase-dependent pathways underlying the APIC are independent of each other.", 
    "40": "Achievement of recommended levels of blood pressure as prescribed by guidelines (i.e., systolic blood pressure of < 130 mmHg in people with nephropathy secondary to type 2 diabetes) generally requires three or more different antihypertensive agents that have complementary modes of action. This systolic goal blood pressure, recommended by generally all international guideline committees, was derived from largely observational studies demonstrating a greater reduction of cardiovascular risk and preservation of kidney function at these levels. Commonly used antihypertensive combinations include angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, which have compelling indications for use in people with kidney disease and/or diabetes, combined with a diuretic, generally a thiazide-type agent. If additional therapy is required, either a beta-blocker or a calcium antagonist may be added to this antihypertensive \"cocktail.\" Beta-blockers are particularly effective in people with a high sympathetic drive (i.e., high pulse rates) to lower blood pressure and reduce cardiovascular risk. Moreover, in recent studies, their benefits on kidney function, both by reducing macroalbuminuria and slowing the decline of kidney function, make them good agents to add in the appropriate clinical setting. With all these potential benefits of achieving blood pressure goals, it is unfortunate that only 11% of people being treated for hypertension with diabetic kidney disease achieve the blood pressure goal of < 130 mmHg, likely contributing to the climbing incidence of people starting dialysis. Physicians need to work harder and educate patients on the importance of achieving these lower blood pressure guidelines.",

    "45": "Alpha-2 adrenoceptors are important in baroreflex regulation. We tested the impact of alpha-2 adrenoceptors on heart rate variability (HRV) and spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) in conscious mice with telemetry (TA11PA-C20). Baseline beat-to-beat measurements (2 hours between 8:00 am to 12:00 pm) were compared with measurements after intraperitoneal alpha-2 adrenoceptor blockade (yohimbine 2 mg/kg) and alpha-2 adrenoceptor stimulation (clonidine 1, 10, and 50 mg/kg). Blood pressure (BP) was 128+/-6/87+/-6 mm Hg and heart rate (HR) was 548+/-18 bpm at baseline. BRS, calculated with the cross-spectral method, was 1.2+/-0.1 ms/mm Hg at baseline. BP increased 20+/-2/13+/-2 mm Hg with yohimbine. HR increased by 158+/-23 bpm. BRS did not change. BP decreased 16+/-7/5+/-4 mm Hg with 1 mg/kg of clonidine and did not change with a higher dose. HR decreased with clonidine (176+/-28, 351+/-21, 310+/-29 bpm during 1, 10, and 50 mg/kg of clonidine, P<0.01). HRV (total power=4629+/-465, 7002+/-440, and 6452+/-341 ms2 during 1, 10, and 50 mg/kg of clonidine, P<0.01) and BRS were profoundly increased with clonidine (14+/-1, 13+/-1, and 10+/-1 ms/mm Hg, P<0.01). The effects of clonidine were abolished with atropine (2 mg/kg plus 50 mg/kg of clonidine) but not with metoprolol (4 mg/kg plus 50 mg/kg of clonidine). These data suggest that alpha-2 adrenoceptors exert a regulatory influence on autonomic cardiovascular control and baroreflex function. The effect of clonidine on baroreflex HR regulation is mediated by the parasympathetic nervous system. These murine data fit well with recent human observations regarding parasympathetic activation via alpha-2 adrenoceptors.", 
    "46": "Vipera lebetina is one of the most venomous snakes on the Iran plateau. Serious clinical problems such as edema, hemorrhage and tissue necrosis are observed in humans following V. lebetina envenomating. However, little information on the pharmacological properties of the venom is available. To determine haemodynamic actions of the venom of V. lebetina, the changes in the mean arterial blood pressure of anaesthetised rats following the administration of the venom were recorded. Venom (1 mg/kg, i.v.) produced rapid cardiovascular collapse, while 0.3 mg/kg (i.v.) caused only a small transient decrease in mean arterial blood pressure. Effects of the venom on perfusion pressure in the isolated rat mesenteric bed, and on contractions of the isolated rat right atrium and the isolated guinea-pig ileum, were also studied. Exposure of the isolated rat right atrium to venom (0.1-1 mg/ml) caused a transient increase followed by a sustained reduction in the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous contractions. The transient positive inotropic and chronotropic effects were abolished when the preparation was preincubated with propranolol, but not with tolazoline. N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester pretreatment attenuated the vascular hyporeactivity to phenylephrine induced by the venom in the isolated rat mesenteric vascular bed. This suggests that nitric oxide (NO) or NO-like compounds may be present in the venom and involved in its hypotensive effect. The venom (0.3-1 mg/ml) caused concentration-dependant blockade of isolated guinea-pig ileum contractions induced by electrical field stimulation, acetylcholine or KCl. This inhibitory effect of the venom was significantly reduced by prior incubation of the venom with manoalide (1 microM) indicating involvement of a phospholipase A(2) component. Further, investigation is required to identify specific toxins responsible for the above pharmacological effects.", 
    "47": "Beta blockers improve left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction but patient responses are heterogenous. We investigated the role of contractile reserve (CR) in predicting beta-blocker response in ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Resting and low-dose dobutamine echocardiograms were recorded in 32 patients with heart failure (LV ejection fraction <or=35%), 18 with ischemic cardiomyopathy (IC), and 14 with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC). A segment was defined as CR positive (CR+) or negative (CR-) based on response to dobutamine. Patients were then classified as CR+ or CR- based on number of improved segments (IC group) or ejection fraction improvement (IDC group) in response to dobutamine. During follow-up (2, 6, and 14 months after beta-blocker initiation), response was measured by the percent of segments showing improved contractility from baseline, ejection fraction, and wall motion score index. In the IC group, the percent of improved segments was greater at 2 and 6 months in CR+ versus CR- (70% vs 15% and 39% vs 17%, p <0.05), whereas it was greater at all periods in the patients with IDC (36% vs 9% at 2 months, 50% vs 19% at 6 months, and 63% vs 42% at 14 months, p <0.05). Findings for ejection fraction and wall motion score index were similar. Therefore, time course and magnitude of improvement in LV function in patients with heart failure receiving beta blockers are related to CR status. CR predicts a greater early response in IC, whereas it predicts a greater response at all time periods in IDC. However, even patients without CR showed improvement in LV function at 14 months.",

Synthetic BmBKTx1 was prepared by using solid-phase peptide synthesis. Two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy techniques were used to determine the solution structure of BmBKTx1. The results show that the BmBKTx1 forms a typical cysteine-stabilized alpha/beta scaffold adopted by most short-chain scorpion toxins. The structure of BmBKTx1 consists of a two-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet (residues 20-29) and an alpha-helix (residues 5-15).

According to the status of renal mineralocorticoid receptors, simultaneous blocking of both neural and humoral pathological stimuli incoming to the kidney after the nerve injury to a higher extent inhibited cytochemical changes in the organ as compared to blocking the neural transmission alone. We propose that both the central neural transmission and humoral mechanisms control the activity of the molecular structures responsible for aldosterone reception in renal tubular cells.", 
    "62": "We examined the contribution of large-conductance, Ca(2+)-sensitive K+ (MaxiK) channel to beta2-adrenoceptor-activated relaxation to isoprenaline in guinea-pig tracheal smooth muscle focusing on the role for cAMP in the coupling between beta2-adrenoceptor and MaxiK channel. Isoprenaline-elicited relaxation was confirmed to be mediated through beta2-type of adrenoceptor since the response was antagonized in a competitive fashion by a beta2-selective adrenoceptor antagonist butoxamine with a pA2 value of 6.56. Isoprenaline-induced relaxation was significantly potentiated by a selective inhibitor of cyclic AMP-specific phosphodiesterase, Ro-20-1724 (0.1-1 microM). cAMP-dependent mediation of MaxiK channel in the relaxant response to isoprenaline was evidenced since the potentiated response to isoprenaline by the presence of Ro-20-1724 (1 microM) was inhibited by the channel selective blocker, iberiotoxin (IbTx, 100 nM). This concept was supported by the finding that the relaxation to a membrane permeable cAMP analogue, 8-bromo-cAMP (1 mM), was susceptible to the inhibition by IbTx. On the other hand, isoprenaline-induced relaxation was not practically diminished by an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor SQ 22,536 (100 microM). However, isoprenaline-induced relaxation in the presence of SQ 22,536 was suppressed by IbTx. Characteristics of isoprenaline-induced relaxant response, i.e., impervious to SQ 22,536 but susceptible to IbTx, were practically mimicked by cholera toxin (CTX, 5 microg/ml), an activator of adenylyl cyclase coupled-heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein Gs. These findings indicate that in guinea-pig tracheal smooth muscle: 1) MaxiK channel substantially mediates beta2-adrenoceptor-activated relaxation; 2) both cAMP-dependent and -independent mechanisms underlie the functional coupling between beta2-adrenoceptor and MaxiK channel to induce muscle relaxation; and 3) direct regulation of MaxiK channel by Gs operates in cAMP-independent coupling between beta2-adrenoceptor and this ion channel.",

Atrial trabecules were cut from right rabbit atrium. Each preparation consisted of cardiomyocytes and sino-atrial node cells. Preparations were stimulated with square pulses of direct current at a voltage of 20V, rate of 2 Hz and 1 ms duration. Propranolol and its analogue were applied at gradded concentration 10(-2) M, 10(-3) M, 10(-4) M, 10(-5) M, 10(-6) M and 10(-7) M. Mechanical (force of contraction, time of contraction and relaxation) and bioelectrical (amplitude and duration of action potentials) activities were examined. Bioelectrical activity of preparations was recorded using intracellular microelectrodes. LD(50) for new analogue was determined.

    "64": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) has been proposed to function as a paracrine signaling molecule in islets of Langerhans. We have shown that rat beta-cells release GABA by Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis of synaptic-like microvesicles. Here we demonstrate that GABA thus released can diffuse over sufficient distances within the islet interstitium to activate GABA(A) receptors in neighboring cells. Confocal immunocytochemistry revealed the presence of GABA(A) receptors in glucagon-secreting alpha-cells but not in beta- and delta-cells. RT-PCR analysis detected transcripts of alpha(1) and alpha(4) as well as beta(1-3) GABA(A) receptor subunits in purified alpha-cells but not in beta-cells. In whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings, exogenous application of GABA activated Cl(-) currents in alpha-cells. The GABA(A) receptor antagonist SR95531 was used to investigate the effects of endogenous GABA (released from beta-cells) on pancreatic islet hormone secretion. The antagonist increased glucagon secretion at 1 mmol/l glucose twofold and completely abolished the inhibitory action of 20 mmol/l glucose on glucagon release. Basal and glucose-stimulated secretion of insulin and somatostatin were unaffected by SR95531. The L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker isradipine evoked a paradoxical stimulation of glucagon secretion. This effect was not observed in the presence of SR95531, and we therefore conclude that isradipine stimulates glucagon secretion by inhibition of GABA release.",

DL-threo-beta-Benzyloxyaspartate (DL-TBOA) is a potent blocker of all subtypes of the excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs). We characterized novel L-TBOA analogs possessing a substituent on their respective benzene rings. The analogs significantly inhibited labeled glutamate uptake, the most potent of which was (2S,3S)-3-[3-[4-(trifluoromethyl)benzoylamino]benzyloxy]aspartate (TFB-TBOA). In an uptake assay using cells transiently expressing EAATs, the IC(50) values of TFB-TBOA for EAAT1, EAAT2, and EAAT3 were 22, 17, and 300 nM, respectively. TFB-TBOA was significantly more potent at inhibiting EAAT1 and EAAT2 compared with L-TBOA (IC(50) values for EAAT1-3 were 33, 6.2, and 15 microM, respectively). Electrophysiological analyses revealed that TBOA analogs block the transport-associated currents in all five EAAT subtypes and also block leak currents in EAAT5. The rank order of the analogs for potencies at inhibiting substrate-induced currents was identical to that observed in the uptake assay. However, the kinetics of TFBTBOA differed from the kinetics of L-TBOA, probably because of the strong binding affinity. Notably, TFB-TBOA did not affect other representative neurotransmitter transporters or receptors, including ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, indicating that it is highly selective for EAATs. Moreover, intracerebroventricular administration of the TBOA analogs induced severe convulsive behaviors in mice, probably because of the accumulation of glutamate. Taken together, these findings indicate that novel TBOA analogs, especially TFB-TBOA, should serve as useful tools for elucidating the physiological roles of the glutamate transporters.", 
    "81": "Many clinically used drugs are G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) antagonists and are given long-term to prevent receptor activation by endogenous agonists. Most GPCR antagonists are considered to have little agonist efficacy of their own. However, many beta antagonists do stimulate very small beta(2) adrenoceptor-mediated cAMP responses, but these responses become substantial at the level of cAMP response element (CRE)-gene transcription. Here, we compared the temporal characteristics of these beta(2) adrenoceptor-mediated cAMP and CRE-gene transcription responses with ligands of differing agonist efficacy. Within a minute, full agonists (e.g., isoprenaline) stimulated large increases in intracellular and exported cAMP. Very weak partial agonists (e.g., alprenolol) did not increase intracellular cAMP (only stimulating a small export). However, all agonists (regardless of efficacy) stimulated an increase in CRE-gene transcription after a 2-h incubation. An initial 30-min continual stimulation was required to initiate the process of CRE-gene transcription for all ligands. Longer agonist incubations resulted in larger gene transcription responses in a proportional manner for both weak and full agonists alike, and this was despite the lack of intracellular cAMP detection for the weaker ligands. Thus, the major initiator for CRE-gene transcription was not cAMP concentration or total quantity generated but a sustained turnover of intracellular cAMP and hence sustained stimulation of CREB phosphorylation. Thus, long-acting agonists and long-term treatments with very weak partial agonists (including many drugs classified previously as antagonists based on traditional second-messenger assays, e.g., several clinically used \"beta-blockers\") may cause more substantial gene transcription than previously believed.",

Absolute LV mass change after 12 months of antihypertensive treatment was greater in men than in women (-30 vs -24 g, P=0.01). However, after adjusting for baseline LV mass and randomized study treatment, LV mass reduction was greater in women than in men (-33 vs -23 g, P=0.001). LV mass regression was greater in women, by 8.0+/-2.8 g, after adjusting for baseline LV mass and randomized study treatment.

Pancreatic K(ATP) channels are composed of two subunits, a pore-forming inwardly rectifying K(+) channel (Kir6.2) subunit and a regulatory subunit (the sulfonylurea receptor of subtype 1 (SUR1)) in a (SUR1/Kir6.2)(4) stoichiometry. The aim of the present study was to characterize the interaction of green-fluorescent 3-[3-(4,4 difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-S-indacen-3-yl)propanamido] glibenclamide (Bodipy-glibenclamide) with pancreatic beta-cell K(ATP) channels using patch-clamp and fluorescence microscopy techniques. Bodipy-glibenclamide inhibited K(ATP) currents from the clonal insulinoma cell line RINm5F half-maximally at a concentration of 0.6nM. Using laser-scanning confocal microscopy Bodipy-glibenclamide was shown to induce a diffuse fluorescence across the RINm5F cell, but only about 17% of total Bodipy-glibenclamide-induced fluorescence intensity in RINm5F cells was due to specific binding to SUR1. Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, it could be demonstrated that the fluorescence label contributes to the protein binding and, therefore, possibly also to the non-specific binding of Bodipy-glibenclamide observed in RINm5F cells. Specific binding of Bodipy-glibenclamide to SUR1 in RINm5F cells might be localized to different intracellular structures (nuclear envelope, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi compartment, insulin secretory granules) as well as to the plasma membrane. In conclusion, Bodipy-glibenclamide is a high-affinity blocker of pancreatic beta-cell K(ATP) currents and can be used for visualizing SUR1 in intact pancreatic beta-cells, although non-specific binding must be taken into account in confocal microscopy experiments on intact beta-cells.",

The term diabetic cardiomyopathy refers to a relation between diabetes mellitus and heart disease, but it probably isn't a separate morphology unit. In treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus general rules apply to heart failure management. The effect of ACE inhibitors was in majority of studies stronger in diabetics than in non-diabetics, the effect of beta blockers was comparable or smaller.

In addition, diphenyleneiodonium chloride, an inhibitor of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activation, attenuated the proapoptotic effect of morphine. Antitransforming growth factor-beta (anti-TGF-beta) antibody and propranolol (an inhibitor of the phospholipase D pathway) inhibited morphine-induced superoxide generation as well as apoptosis. N'-Tetraacetic acid tetra (acetoxymethyl) ester, a calcium-chelating agent, inhibited morphine-induced apoptosis, whereas thapsigargin (a calcium agonist) stimulated macrophage apoptosis under basal as well as morphine-stimulated states. These studies suggest that morphine-induced macrophage apoptosis is mediated through downstream signaling involving TGF-beta and NO production. Moreover, there is NADPH oxidation activation involving phospholipase D and Ca(2+), leading to the generation of superoxide. In in vivo studies, administration of N-acetyl cysteine and preinduction of heme oxygenase activity and epoetin alpha prevented morphine-induced peritoneal macrophage apoptosis, thus further confirming the role of oxidative stress in morphine-induced macrophage apoptosis.",

    "102": "Diabetes may develop in nondiabetic hypertensive subjects during treatment, but the long-term cardiovascular implications of this phenomenon are not clear. We determined the prognostic value of new diabetes in hypertensive subjects. In a long-term cohort study, 795 initially untreated hypertensive subjects, 6.5% of whom with type 2 diabetes, underwent diagnostic procedures including 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring and electrocardiography (ECG). Procedures were repeated after a median of 3.1 years in the absence of cardiovascular events. Follow-up duration was 1 to 16 years (median 6.0). New diabetes occurred in 5.8% of subjects initially without diabetes. Antihypertensive treatment included a diuretic in 53.5% of these subjects, versus 30.4% of those in whom diabetes did not develop (P=0.002). Plasma glucose at entry (P=0.0001) and diuretic treatment on follow-up (P=0.004) were independent predictors of new diabetes. Subsequent to the follow-up visit, a first cardiovascular event occurred in 63 subjects. Event rate in nondiabetic subjects at both visits, new diabetes, and diabetes at entry were 0.97, 3.90, and 4.70x100 person-years, respectively (P=0.0001). After adjustment for several confounders, including 24-hour ambulatory BP, the relative risk of events was 2.92 (95% CI: 1.33 to 6.41; P=0.007) in the group with new diabetes and 3.57 (95% CI: 1.65 to 7.73; P=0.001) in the group with previous diabetes, when compared with the group persistently free of diabetes. In treated hypertensive subjects, occurrence of new diabetes portends a risk for subsequent cardiovascular disease that is not dissimilar from that of previously known diabetes.", 
    "103": "We observed earlier that central alpha-2 adrenoceptor stimulation in mice greatly augments parasympathetic tone. To test the effects in humans, we assessed autonomic vasomotor tone and baroreflex regulation in 9 normal young adults on 2 occasions, once with and once without clonidine. We determined heart rate (HR), beat-by-beat blood pressure (BP), and muscle sympathetic nerve activity. HR variability was analyzed in the time and frequency domain. Pharmacological baroreflex slopes were determined using incremental phenylephrine and nitroprusside infusions. Clonidine lowered resting BP (122+/-4/73+/-3 versus 100+/-7/55+/-3 mm Hg, P<0.01), muscle sympathetic nerve activity (18+/-3 versus 4+/-2 bursts/min, P<0.01), and HR (62+/-3 versus 56+/-3 bpm, P<0.05). The baroreflex heart rate curve was reset to much lower HR values and showed no saturation at low HR. HR variability profoundly increased during clonidine plus phenylephrine (total power: 3224+/-843 versus 8943+/-2329 ms2, P<0.05). High-frequency power was 1451+/-520 at baseline and 6720+/-2475 ms2 during baroreceptor loading (P<0.05). The low-frequency/high-frequency ratio decreased (1.94+/-0.41 versus 0.69+/-0.10, P<0.05). In contrast, clonidine reduced resting sympathetic vasomotor tone and shifted the operating point of the sympathetic baroreflex to a flat part of the sympathetic baroreflex curve. The shift decreased the ability of the baroreflex to withdraw sympathetic vasomotor tone during baroreflex loading. These baroreflex changes were associated with a moderate increase in phenylephrine responsiveness. We conclude that alpha-2 adrenoceptor stimulation has a differential effect on baroreflex HR and vasomotor regulation. alpha-2 Adrenoceptor stimulation greatly augments baroreflex-mediated bradycardia, most likely by parasympathetic activation.", 
    "104": "1. Substitution of arginine by glycine at position 389, a frequent beta(1)-adrenoceptor polymorphism, reduces adenylyl cyclase stimulation by (-)-isoprenaline. beta(1)-Adrenoceptors mediate the effects of catecholamines and nonconventional partial agonists ((-)-CGP12177) through different sites. We investigated the influence of the 389 polymorphism on beta blocker affinity, as well as on the responses to (-)-isoprenaline and the nonconventional partial agonist (-)-CGP12177 on cyclic AMP levels in CHO cells expressing recombinant Arg389-beta(1)-adrenoceptors (101 fmol mg(-1) protein) or Gly389-beta(1)-adrenoceptors (94 fmol mg(-1)). 2. The affinity of beta-blockers and partial agonists, estimated from competition binding with (-)-[(125)I]-cyanopindolol, was not different for Arg389-beta(1)-adrenoceptors and Gly389-beta(1)-adrenoceptors. 3. The maximum cAMP increases by (-)-isoprenaline and (-)-CGP12177 at Gly389-beta(1)-adrenoceptors were reduced by 97 and 46%, but the potencies enhanced 2 and 0.5 log units, respectively, compared to Arg389-beta(1)-adrenoceptors. The intrinsic activity of (-)-CGP12177 with respect to the (-)-isoprenaline was 0.057 at Arg389-beta(1)-adrenoceptors and 1.05 at Gly389-beta(1)-adrenoceptors. 4. We confirm in intact CHO cells that responses to (-)-isoprenaline are markedly reduced at Gly389-beta(1)-adrenoceptors compared to Arg389-beta(1)-adrenoceptors. However, the 389 polymorphism reduces considerably less the agonist responses to (-)-CGP12177, indicating that coupling to G(s) protein is different for beta(1)-adrenoceptors activated by catecholamines than for receptors activated by nonconventional partial agonists. The affinity of beta-blockers is conserved across the Arg389Gly polymorphism.",

In this study, we examined the effects of low-toxicity compounds with previously described spermicidal activity (mainly against mammalian sperm) on motility and fertilizing ability of sea lamprey spermatozoa. Nonoxynol-9, benzalkonium chloride, zinc acetate, cupric chloride, cysteamine, tannic acid and propranolol were able to inhibit both sperm motility and fertilizing ability. Effective concentrations of these spermicides ranged from 0.15 to 1%. Therefore, they can be potentially used in further study directed at in vivo sterilization of male sea lampreys.",

The NK activity was measured by (51)chromium release assay. Central sympathectomy with intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of 6-OHDA reduced significantly the elevation of plasma corticosterone level, the expression of Fos in hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus and in locus coeruleus, as well as the suppression of NK activity induced by cold stress at 4 degrees C for 4 h. Peripheral sympathectomy with intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 6-OHDA and blockade of beta-adrenergic receptor with i.p. injection of propranolol also reversed the cold stress-induced suppression of NK cytotoxicity, but without significant effect on Fos expression in brain. The results suggest that the activation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis induced by cold stress might be mediated, at least partially, by central noradrenergic system, and that the cold stress-induced suppression of NK cytotoxicity might be mediated by the activation of peripheral sympathetic nerve.",

    "116": "Glaucoma is a chronic optic neuropathy in which retinal ganglion cells die over a number of years. The initiation of the disease and its progression may involve an ischaemic-like insult to the ganglion cell axons caused by an alteration in the quality of blood flow. Thus, to effectively treat glaucoma it may be necessary to counteract the ischaemic-like insult to the region of the optic nerve head. Studies on the isolated optic nerve suggest that substances that reduce the influx of sodium would be particularly effective neuroprotectants. Significantly, of the presently used antiglaucoma substances, only beta-blockers can reduce sodium influx into cells. Moreover, they also reduce the influx of calcium and this would be expected to benefit the survival of insulted neurones. Betaxolol is the most effective antiglaucoma drug at reducing sodium/calcium influx. Our electroretinographic data indicated that topical application of levobetaxolol to rats attenuated the effects of ischaemia/reperfusion injury. Timolol was also effective but to a lesser extent. Based on these data we conclude that beta-blockers may be able to blunt ganglion cell death in glaucoma, and that levobetaxolol may be a more effective neuroprotectant than timolol because of its greater capacity to block sodium and calcium influx.",

These patients underwent cardiac 123I-MIBG imaging 1 day before and 7 days after they had undergone EUTS. The heart/mediastinum (H/M) ratio and the washout rate were calculated for both early and late phases, and single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) imaging of the early phase was performed. Excessive perspiration from the palms disappeared immediately after EUTS in all patients, and they showed no symptoms of a circulatory condition following the procedure. On the 123I-MIBG imaging studies, the early H/M ratio before EUTS was 2.35 +/- 0.26 and postoperatively it was 2.29 +/- 0.23. The delayed H/M ratio before EUTS was 2.59 +/- 0.3 and after the procedure it was 2.66 +/- 0.27. There was no significant difference between the H/M ratio before and after EUTS. The washout rate after EUTS (14.27 +/- 4.71%) was significantly lower than that measured before EUTS (18.36 +/- 5.13%: p < 0.01).

    "122": "It was previously shown that carvedilol, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist with antioxidant properties, was able to inhibit the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). In the present work, the hypothesis was that the negative impact of carvedilol on the MPT was specifically the result of its antioxidant effect. For the current investigation, we used three different MPT inducers. MPT-associated events were tested to study the protective effect of both carvedilol and cyclosporin-A, the known MPT inhibitor. Carvedilol inhibited mitochondrial swelling with calcium plus phosphate and with calcium plus t-butylhydroperoxide, but not with calcium plus carboxyatractyloside. Carvedilol inhibited the oxidation of thiol groups with calcium plus phosphate (p < 0.01) and with calcium plus t-butylhydroperoxide (p < 0.05), but not with calcium plus carboxyatractyloside--in opposition to the full protection afforded by cyclosporin-A when using calcium and carboxyatractyloside. Our results showed that carvedilol was effective only when the MPT was triggered by a primary oxidative process. This finding implies that the antioxidant properties of carvedilol are crucial for the observed effects and reinforces the advantageous use of carvedilol in cardiac pathologies associated with enhanced cellular oxidative stress.", 
    "123": "Dehydroepiandrosterone has been implicated in vascular disease and its associated insulin resistance and hypertension, though little is known about its vascular effects. We have recently shown in prepubertal anaesthetized pigs that intravenous infusion of dehydroepiandrosterone caused coronary vasoconstriction through the inhibition of a vasodilatory beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated effect related to the release of nitric oxide. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of dehydroepiandrosterone on mesenteric, renal and iliac vascular beds. In prepubertal pigs of both sexes anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone, changes in superior mesenteric, left renal and left external iliac blood flow caused by intravenous infusion of dehydroepiandrosterone were assessed using electromagnetic flowmeters. Changes in heart rate and arterial blood pressure were prevented by atrial pacing and by connecting the arterial system to a pressurized reservoir containing Ringer solution. In 22 pigs, infusion of 1 mg h(-1) of dehydroepiandrosterone decreased mesenteric, renal and iliac blood flow. In a further 10 pigs, dose-response curves were obtained by graded increases in the infused dose of hormone between 0.03 and 4 mg h(-1). The mechanisms of the above response were studied in the 22 pigs by repeating the experiment after haemodynamic variables had returned to the control values observed before infusion. Blockade of alpha-adrenoceptors with intravenous phentolamine (five pigs) did not affect the dehydroepiandrosterone-induced mesenteric, renal and iliac vasoconstriction. This response was abolished by blockade of beta(2)-adrenoceptors with intravenous butoxamine (five pigs) and by blockade of mesenteric, renal and iliac nitric oxide synthase with intra-arterial administration of N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (seven pigs), even after reversing the increase in local vascular resistance caused by the two blocking agents with intravenous infusion of papaverine. In five pigs, the increase in measured blood flow caused by intravenous infusion of isoproterenol (isoprenaline) was significantly reduced by infusion of dehydroepiandrosterone. The present study showed that intravenous infusion of dehydroepiandrosterone primarily caused mesenteric, renal and iliac vasoconstriction. The mechanisms of this response were shown to be due to the inhibition of a vasodilatory beta(2)-adrenergic receptor-mediated effect, which possibly involved the release of nitric oxide.", 
    "124": "In humans, lipid mobilization is considered to depend mainly on sympathetic nervous system activation and catecholamine action. A contribution of ANP was hypothesized because we have previously shown that atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a lipolytic agent on isolated human fat cells. Control of lipid-mobilizing mechanisms was investigated using in situ microdialysis in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT) in healthy young men during two successive exercise bouts performed at 35% and 60% peak oxygen consumption (VO2max) after placebo or acute oral tertatolol (nonselective beta-antagonist) treatment. In placebo-treated subjects, infusion of propranolol in the probe (100 micromol/l) only partially reduced (40%) the increment in extracellular glycerol concentration (EGC) promoted by exercise. Moreover, oral beta-adrenergic receptor blockade did not prevent exercise-induced lipid mobilization in SCAT while exerting fat cell beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. Exercise-induced increase in plasma ANP was potently amplified by oral tertatolol. A positive correlation was found between EGC and plasma ANP levels but also between extracellular cGMP (i.e., index of ANP-mediated lipolysis) and EGC. Thus, we demonstrate that exercise-induced lipid mobilization resistant to local propranolol and lipid-mobilizing action observed under oral beta-blockade is related to the action of ANP. Oral beta-adrenergic receptor blockade, which potentiates exercise-induced ANP release by the heart, may contribute to lipid mobilization in SCAT. The potential relevance of an ANP-related lipid-mobilizing pathway is discussed.",

While 90% of patients were in NYHA III-IV class at admission to hospital, only 2% of patients were in class IV at hospital discharge. The proportion of smokers was greater in men than in women (68% vs. 12%). Atrial fibrillation was present in 35% of patients. During hospitalization, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were used by 77%, diuretics by 95%, digitalis by 76%, nitrate by 85%, beta-blockers by 3%, aspirin by 86%, anticoagulants by 44%, Ca antagonist by 10%, positive inotropic agents by 42%; and antiarrhythmic agents by 15% of patients.",

The present study sought to characterize the relative roles of the endothelium-derived relaxing factors (nitric oxide, endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor [EDHF], and prostaglandins) in the cyclosporine-induced impairment of renovascular responsiveness to acetylcholine receptor or beta-adrenoceptor activation. Changes evoked by cyclosporine in the responses to either vasorelaxant were evaluated in phenylephrine-preconstricted isolated perfused rat kidneys in the absence and presence of N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME, nitric oxide synthase inhibitor), tetraethylammonium (K(+) channel blocker), or diclophenac (cyclooxygenase inhibitor). Acetylcholine (0.03-2 nmol) vasodilations were significantly inhibited by prior treatment with l-NAME, tetraethylammonium, or diclophenac, suggesting a role for nitric oxide, EDHF, and prostaglandins in acetylcholine vasodilations. Isoprenaline (0.125-4 micromol) vasodilations were inhibited by l-NAME and tetraethylammonium versus no effect for diclophenac. Cyclosporine (1-4 microM) produced a concentration-related inhibition of vasodilations relaxations produced by either vasodilator. Cyclosporine-induced inhibition of acetylcholine vasodilations was attenuated in tissues pretreated with l-NAME or tetraethylammonium but not diclophenac, implicating nitric oxide and EDHF in cyclosporine-acetylcholine interaction. On the other hand, the inhibition of isoprenaline vasodilations by cyclosporine was virtually abolished by l-NAME. In cyclosporine-treated kidneys, exposure to l-arginine, the substrate of nitric oxide synthesis, fully restored isoprenaline vasodilations to control levels and significantly increased acetylcholine vasodilations. It is concluded that the identity and relative contributions of endothelial factors to renal vasodilatory responses as well as to the inhibition of these responses by cyclosporine largely depend on the vasodilator stimulus.", 
    "130": "Trace amines are biological compounds that are still awaiting identification of their role in neuronal function. Using intracellular electrophysiological recordings, we investigated the depressant action of two trace amines (beta-phenylethylamine and tyramine) on the firing activity of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area. This inhibition was due to a membrane hyperpolarisation that was blocked by the D2 dopamine receptor antagonist sulpiride and was not potentiated by the dopamine-uptake blocker, cocaine. Inhibition of the dopamine transporter did not mediate the effects of trace amines, because unlike cocaine, trace amines did not potentiate the inhibitory responses to exogenously applied dopamine. The inhibitory actions of beta-phenylethylamine and tyramine were present in reserpine-treated animals but were abolished when the dopamine-synthesis inhibitor carbidopa was applied. Our data suggest that trace amines cause an indirect activation of dopamine autoreceptors, by an increased efflux of newly synthesised dopamine. The inhibition of dopaminergic activity by trace amines may relate to their involvement in neuronal processes linked to drug addiction, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactive disorders and Parkinson's disease.", 
    "131": "In many phase III clinical trials, it is desirable to separately assess the treatment effect on two or more primary endpoints. Consider the MERIT-HF study, where two endpoints of primary interest were time to death and the earliest of time to first hospitalization or death (The International Steering Committee on Behalf of the MERIT-HF Study Group, 1997, American Journal of Cardiology 80[9B], 54J-58J). It is possible that treatment has no effect on death but a beneficial effect on first hospitalization time, or it has a detrimental effect on death but no effect on hospitalization. A good clinical trial design should permit early stopping as soon as the treatment effect on both endpoints becomes clear. Previous work in this area has not resolved how to stop the study early when one or more endpoints have no treatment effect or how to assess and control the many possible error rates for concluding wrong hypotheses. In this article, we develop a general methodology for group sequential clinical trials with multiple primary endpoints. This method uses a global alpha-spending function to control the overall type I error and a multiple decision rule to control error rates for concluding wrong alternative hypotheses. The method is demonstrated with two simulated examples based on the MERIT-HF study.",

The main purposes of this study were to reconstruct a complete human organotypic cornea equivalent, consisting of all three different cell types (epithelial, stromal, and endothelial); to test the barrier function of this bio-engineered human cornea using three different model drugs (pilocarpine hydrochloride (PHCl), befunolol hydrochloride (BHCl), and hydrocortisone (HC)); and to determine its usefulness as an in vitro model for prediction of ocular drug absorption into the human eye.", 
    "133": "A multilayer tissue construct was created step by step in Transwell cell culture insert using SV-40 immortalised human endothelial and epithelial cells and native stromal cells (fibroblasts). Morphology was characterised by light microscopy using routine H&E staining. Scanning electron microscopy was used to evaluate ultrastructural features. Ocular permeation of drugs across the human cornea construct was tested using modified Franz cells and compared with data obtained from excised porcine cornea and previously described porcine cornea constructs.", 
    "134": "and conclusion: The cornea construct exhibited typical corneal structures such as a monolayer of hexagonally shaped endothelial cells and a multilayered epithelium consisting of seven to nine cell layers with flat superficial cells. The formation of microplicae and microvilli was also confirmed. The human cornea construct showed similar permeation behaviour for all substances compared with excised porcine cornea. However, permeability (permeation coefficients K(p)) of the human cornea equivalent (PHCl 13.4*10(-6) (SD 3.01*10(-6)); BHCl 9.88*10(-6) (SD 1.79*10(-6)); HC 5.41*10(-6) (SD 0.40*10(-6)) cm/s) was about 1.6-1.8 fold higher than excised porcine cornea. Compared with data from the porcine cornea construct the cultivated human equivalent showed a decreased permeability. The reconstructed human cornea could be appropriate to predict drug absorption into the human eye.", 
    "135": "Bilateral microinjections of GABA (300 mM, 100 nl) or the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol (100 microM, 100 nl) into the preoptic area (POA) of the hypothalamus increased the rate of whole body O(2) consumption (VO(2)) and the body core (colonic) temperature of urethane-chloralose-anesthetized, artificially ventilated rats. The most sensitive site was the dorsomedial POA at the level of the anterior commissure. The GABA-induced thermogenesis was accompanied by a tachycardic response and electromyographic (EMG) activity recorded from the femoral or neck muscles. Pretreatment with muscle relaxants (1 mg/kg pancuronium bromide + 4 mg/kg vecuronium bromide i.v.) prevented GABA-induced EMG activity but had no significant effect on GABA-induced thermogenesis. However, pretreatment with the beta-adrenoceptor propranolol (5 mg/kg i.v.) greatly attenuated the GABA-induced increase in VO(2) and tachycardic responses. Accordingly, the GABA-induced increase in VO(2) reflected mainly nonshivering thermogenesis. On the other hand, cooling of the shaved back of the rat by contact with a plastic bag containing 28 degrees C water also elicited thermogenic, tachycardic, and EMG responses. Bilateral microinjections of the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline (500 microM, 100 nl), but not the vehicle saline, into the POA blocked these skin cooling-induced responses. These results suggest that GABA and GABA(A) receptors in the POA mediate cold information arising from the skin for eliciting cold-induced thermogenesis.", 
    "136": "In the sea urchin embryo, the oral-aboral axis is specified after fertilization by mechanisms that are largely unknown. We report that early sea urchin embryos express Nodal and Antivin in the presumptive oral ectoderm and demonstrate that these genes control formation of the oral-aboral axis. Overexpression of nodal converted the whole ectoderm into oral ectoderm and induced ectopic expression of the orally expressed genes goosecoid, brachyury, BMP2/4, and antivin. Conversely, when the function of Nodal was blocked, by injection of an antisense Morpholino oligonucleotide or by injection of antivin mRNA, neither the oral nor the aboral ectoderm were specified. Injection of nodal mRNA into Nodal-deficient embryos induced an oral-aboral axis in a largely non-cell-autonomous manner. These observations suggest that the mechanisms responsible for patterning the oral-aboral axis of the sea urchin embryo may share similarities with mechanisms that pattern the dorsoventral axis of other deuterostomes.", 
    "137": "Repolarization heterogeneity has been shown to constitute a substrate for malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Noninvasive measurement of abnormal repolarization through assessment of QT interval dispersion from the resting standard 12-lead ECG initially had shown promise in assessing arrhythmia risk but was challenged recently. The relative T wave residuum (TWR) has been proposed recently to reflect regional repolarization dispersion more accurately. We analyzed the role played by the dipolar and nondipolar components in determining TWR.", 
    "138": "Singular value decomposition was applied to the repolarization signals obtained from isolated rabbit hearts using a 5 x 8 array multielectrode recording system during premature beats (N = 11) and after d-sotalol (N = 9) exposure. Both the dipolar and nondipolar components of the T wave increased significantly during premature stimulation and after d-sotalol exposure. The relative TWR decreased significantly during premature stimulation but did not change after d-sotalol. Changes in the dipolar and nondipolar components of the second half of the T wave were significantly greater than those corresponding to the first half during premature stimulation, and a significant correlation was observed between the nondipolar components of the second half of the T wave and the T(peak-end) interval.", 
    "139": "Conditions exist during which both the dipolar and nondipolar components can change simultaneously. Under these conditions, the relative TWR may not reflect regional heterogeneity of repolarization with accuracy. The nondipolar components of the second half of the T wave can be linked to assessment of the transmural dispersion of repolarization.", 
    "140": "Arterial stiffness is recognized as an important determinant of outcome in the hypertensive population. Although pulse pressure is an indirect index more recently relatively simple non-invasive techniques to measure pulse wave velocity, particularly in the aorta and arterial wave analysis have been developed and applied to clinical trials. There are clear differences in the effects of antihypertensive drugs on these parameters and stiffness is becoming a therapeutic target in its own right.", 
    "141": "Postoperative atrial fibrillation after heart surgery is frequent and may increase the length of hospital stay and costs of postoperative care of patients after heat surgery. Pharmacological and pacing interventions were evaluated in the large number of relatively small trials with often contradictory results. Conventional beta-blockers, sotalol, amiodarone and pacing were shown to be equally effective in the prevention of postoperative atrial fibrillation. Amiodarone and bi-atrial pacing were also effective in decreasing the length of hospital stay.", 
    "142": "Levosimendan (LS) is a new calcium sensitizer that exerts positive inotropic effects without increasing intracellular cAMP or Ca2+ at therapeutic doses and therefore may avoid major limitations of beta-adrenergic agents. LS also causes arteriolar and venous dilation by opening potassium channels on vascular smooth muscle cells. In addition, LS does not increase myocardial oxygen demand and may exert anti-stunning effects. LS itself has a short elimination half life but has shown to have active metabolites with elimination half lives up to 80 hours. Three hemodynamic studies show that at recommended doses LS increases cardiac output by 8-30% and reduces pulmonary capillary wedge pressure by 11-28% in heart failure patients. Systemic vascular resistance falls significantly and blood pressure tends to decline. The hemodynamic effects are not attenuated by concomitant beta-blocker medication. Two large randomized studies on patients with chronic and acute congestive heart failure found a decrease in mortality with LS. In the LIDO trial there was a 52.9% survival benefit at day 31 when compared with patients receiving dobutamine. In the RUSSLAN trial, the survival benefit approached 40% at day 14 after start of treatment compared to placebo. Experience in the ICU setting is limited but LS therapy in postoperative low output failure and cardiogenic shock seems to be feasible and LS is a promising agent in the inotropic armamentarium. LS has a favourable side effect profile and is approved for 24-hour use in congestive heart failure. It may cause hypotension due to vasodilation, and this effect may be aggravated by inadequate preload conditions. Further morbidity and mortality studies are required to confirm the encouraging data from the LIDO and RUSSLAN trial but already the existing data support LS as the inotropic agent of choice in patients with worsening heart failure and a systolic arterial blood pressure beyond 90 mmHg.", 
    "143": "Pharmacologic management of chronic heart failure rests on appropriate volume management followed by neurohormonal antagonism. Despite the rationale for neurohormonal antagonists, their use remains low. Definitive studies establish that neurohormonal antagonists are effective across the spectrum of disease, from the early Stage A patient at risk of developing structural heart disease and symptomatic heart failure to the Stage D patient with symptoms at rest. Although many investigators and clinicians seem focused on the next new scientific breakthrough, published studies delineate strategies that will reduce death and disability for those at risk and those with symptomatic chronic heart failure. In essence, the broad use of neurohormonal antagonists, consistent with the reports of large-scale trials that have been reported, will markedly reduce the risk of disease progression and death. Overall prognosis however remains poor. We review the data from these trials to encourage clinicians to use these proven neurohormonal antagonists in optimizing therapeutic strategy.", 
    "144": "The Losartan Intervention for Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study was designed to compare losartan- vs atenolol-based antihypertensive treatment on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a population of 9193 hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). In LIFE, the losartan-based treatment further reduced the primary composite end point (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) by 13% (risk reduction (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77-0.98, P=0.021). The further reduction in stroke with losartan (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63-0.89, P=0.001) was the major contributing factor to the reduction in the primary end point. Our objective was to project the reduction in stroke observed with a losartan- vs an atenolol-based antihypertensive treatment regimen in the LIFE study to the European Union (EU) population. The number of stroke events averted was estimated by identifying the number of persons in the EU expected to meet the LIFE inclusion criteria, and multiplying this figure by the cumulative incidence risk difference in stroke from LIFE at 5.5 years. The age- and gender-specific prevalence of hypertension, electrocardiographically (ECG)-diagnosed LVH among those with hypertension (inclusion criteria), and heart failure among those with LVH and hypertension (exclusion criteria) were applied to the EU census estimates. We conservatively projected that an estimated 7.8 million individuals aged 55-80 years in the EU are affected by hypertension and ECG-diagnosed LVH. Use of a losartan-based antihypertensive treatment in this population is projected to prevent approximately 125 000 first strokes over a 5.5-year period. A population-wide prevention strategy of using losartan in patients with LVH and hypertension has the potential to have a major public health impact by reducing the morbidity and mortality of stroke in the EU.",

    "146": "One hundred patients with permanent atrial fibrillation and heart rate at rest above 80 bpm were divided into 9 treatment groups. High-resolution orthogonal Frank lead ECG was recorded before and after allocated treatment. Analysis included construction of ff-waves periodograms, histograms of RR interval, cardiointervalograms and application of autocorrelation function.", 
    "147": "It was demonstrated that frequency and form (structure) of ventricular rhythm was determined not only by the state of AV conduction but also by value of basic period of ff-waves. The mechanisms of ventricular rate deceleration by investigated drugs were not identical. beta-blockers and verapamil directly slowed AV conduction without changing parameters of ff-waves and differed from each other only in action on parameters of concealed conduction in AV node. Action of digoxin in patients with ff-waves period equal to or exceeding 0,15 s was biphasic. During phase I shortening of ff-wave period (by 0.025+/-0.012 s) occurred. This was associated with increase of their concealed conduction through AV node. The latter phenomenon represented independent mechanism of ventricular rhythm deceleration. During phase II of digoxin action direct inhibition of AV conduction took place. Amiodarone and d,l-sotalol increased basic ff-waves period. This facilitated their conduction through AV node. Greater heart rate slowing effect of d,l-sotalol was attributed to its ability to augment concealed conduction. Due to their antiarrhythmic qualities amiodarone and d,l-sotalol slowed heart rate in patients with peak RR duration in the region of 0.28-0.46 s. These patients often had bi- and tri-modal structure of interval RR histogram. Changes of ventricular rhythm structure during use of various drugs were different. Action of digoxin was most whilst that of beta-blockers least favorable.",

    "153": "Diabetes is a strong and independent risk factor for the development of heart failure, and once heart failure occurs, patients with diabetes have a much poorer prognosis than do those without diabetes. This difference has been explained by the existence of a distinct diabetic cardiomyopathy characterized by morphologic and structural changes to the myocardium and coronary vasculature. Despite diabetic cardiomyopathy, the pharmacologic treatment of heart failure in diabetic patients is similar to that in patients without diabetes, and in general, the clinical response of diabetic patients to drug therapies for heart failure is similar, if not superior, to that of nondiabetic patients. Subgroup analyses from large clinical studies have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors not only reduce mortality in diabetic patients with heart failure, but also reduce the incidence of heart failure in at-risk diabetic patients. B-Blockers remain underused in the diabetic population despite overwhelming evidence of their efficacy in treating heart failure in patients with diabetes.", 
    "154": "In the present study, in vitro concentration-related effect of catecholamines, dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and epinephrine (E) was observed on phagocytic activity of splenic macrophages to understand the impact of sympatho-adrenal-medullary (SAM) activation on innate immunity in wall lizard Hemidactylus flaviviridis under stress condition. Restraint stress for 1 h resulted in marked suppression of macrophage phagocytosis, suggesting that supra-physiological level of catecholamines in response to SAM activation under stress suppressed phagocytosis. This interpretation was reinforced since all the catecholamines considerably reduced phagocytosis at high concentrations ranging from 10(-7) to 10(-5)M. On the contrary, DA, NE, and E at low concentrations considerably stimulated phagocytosis, which increased with the decrease of concentrations ranging from 10(-11) to 10(-15)M. Further, effect of NE and E was blocked by beta-adrenergic blocker suggesting the beta-adrenoceptor-dependent regulating mechanism of NE and E. DA acts through both beta-adrenoceptor-dependent and D1/D2 class receptor-dependent mechanism, since beta-adrenergic blocker could partially block the DA effect. beta-Adrenoceptor-linked adenylate cyclase-mediated cAMP action in modulation of phagocytic activity was evident as 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine suppressed phagocytosis. Further, to delineate the mode of dual effect of catecholamines through beta-adrenergic receptors, in vitro concentration-related effect of cAMP was investigated on macrophage phagocytosis. cAMP depending on concentration had opposite effect on phagocytosis, and its stimulatory effect at low concentrations was reversed by actinomycin D and cycloheximide, whereas these transcription and translation inhibitors, respectively, failed to alter the inhibitory effect of cAMP at high concentrations. This suggests the concentration-related two different pathways of catecholamine action, classical non-genomic at high concentration while genomic pathway at low concentration.",

Overall, the risk of the primary composite end point (cardiovascular death, stroke, myocardial infarction) was reduced by 13% (p = 0.021) with losartan, with similar blood pressure (BP) reduction in both treatment groups. There was a suggestion of interaction between ethnic background and treatment (p = 0.057).",

    "158": "A significant interaction existed between the dichotomized groups (black/non-black) and treatment (p = 0.005); a test for qualitative interaction was also significant (p = 0.016). The hazard ratio (losartan relative to atenolol) for the primary end point favored atenolol in black patients (1.666 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.043 to 2.661]; p = 0.033) and favored losartan in non-blacks (0.829 [95% CI 0.733 to 0.938]; p = 0.003). In black patients, BP reduction was similar in both groups, and regression of electrocardiographic-LVH was greater with losartan.", 
    "159": "Results of the subanalysis are sufficient to generate the hypothesis that black patients with hypertension and LVH might not respond as favorably to losartan-based treatment as non-black patients with respect to cardiovascular outcomes, and do not support a recommendation for losartan as a first-line treatment for this purpose. The subanalysis is limited by the relatively small number of events.", 
    "160": "The common use and wide availability of beta-adrenergic blocking agents make them frequent ingestants for small children. Yet, there are no clear guidelines in the literature to direct the care of the toddler with the history of ingesting 1-2 tablets. With 40 years of extensive clinical experience, not one documented case of death or serious cardiovascular morbidity as a direct result of a beta-blocker exposure is to be found in an English language review for children under 6 years of age. As with children on chronic beta-blocker therapy, several cases of symptomatic hypoglycemia associated with a single acute propranolol exposure suggest a vulnerability to this complication. Though the risk to the toddler exposed to 1-2 tablets appears to be extremely small, several factors mitigate the actual risk to the child and the need for triage to a health care facility.", 
    "161": "Beta-blockers are widely used to prevent the lethal cardiac events associated with the long QT syndrome (LQTS), especially in KCNQ1-related LQTS (LQT1) patients. Some LQT1 patients, however, are refractory to this therapy.", 
    "162": "Eighteen symptomatic LQTS patients (12 families) were genetically diagnosed as having heterozygous KCNQ1 variants and received beta-blocker therapy. Cardiac events recurred in 4 members (3 families) despite continued therapy during mean follow-up of 70 months. Three of these patients (2 families) had the same mutation [A341V (KCNQ1)]; and the other had R243H (KCNQ1). The latter patient took aprindine, which seemed to be responsible for the event. By functional assay using a heterologous mammalian expression system, we found that A341V (KCNQ1) is a loss-of-function type mutation (not dominant negative). Further genetic screening revealed that one A341V (KCNQ1) family cosegregated with S706C (KCNH2) and another with G144S (KCNJ2). Functional assay of the S706C (KCNH2) mutation was found to reduce the current density of expressed heterozygous KCNH2 channels with a positive shift (+8 mV) of the activation curve. Action potential simulation study was conducted based on the KYOTO model to estimate the influence of additional gene modifiers. In both models mimicking LQT1 plus 2 and LQT1 plus 7, the incidence of early afterdepolarization was increased compared with the LQT1 model under the setting of beta-adrenergic stimulation.",

    "164": "Lipid-mobilising factor (LMF) is produced by cachexia-inducing tumours and is involved in the degradation of adipose tissue, with increased oxidation of the released fatty acids through an induction of uncoupling protein (UCP) expression. Since UCP-2 is thought to be involved in the detoxification of free radicals if LMF induced UCP-2 expression in tumour cells, it might attenuate free radical toxicity. As a model system we have used MAC13 tumour cells, which do not produce LMF. Addition of LMF caused a concentration-dependent increase in UCP-2 expression, as determined by immunoblotting. This effect was attenuated by the beta3 antagonist SR59230A, suggesting that it was mediated through a beta3 adrenoreceptor. Co-incubation of LMF with MAC13 cells reduced the growth-inhibitory effects of bleomycin, paraquat and hydrogen peroxide, known to be free radical generators, but not chlorambucil, an alkylating agent. There was no effect of LMF alone on cellular proliferation. These results indicate that LMF antagonises the antiproliferative effect of agents working through a free radical mechanism, and may partly explain the unresponsiveness to the chemotherapy of cachexia-inducing tumours.", 
    "165": "In traditional medicine Gossypium barbadense L. is used against hypertension. Looking for a scientific basis for this use, the blood-pressure-lowering effect of the decoction of the leaves was confirmed. Fraction II (frII) of the crude extract of G. barbadense showed a dose-dependent hypotensive effect in anaesthetized rats. In hexamethonium-treated rats, the blood-pressure-lowering effect of frII was almost abolished. A small decrease of the blood-pressure-lowering effect was followed by an increase in the blood pressure. Phentolamine antagonized the increase in blood pressure in hexamethoniumtreated rats. High doses of atropine (4 mg/rat) suppressed both depressor and heart effects. In-vitro experiments revealed that atropine did not antagonize the contraction of the ileum of the rat. Tripelennamine in a concentration of 100 microg could not influence the contraction either, whereas 300 microg did. In the guinea-pig ileum 10 microg tripelennamine did not reduce the contraction significantly. In the mechanism of action of frII, acetylcholine receptors could be involved, but not histaminergic or adrenergic receptors. Although it is still not known which compound(s) in G. barbadense is (are) the active substance(s), the results obtained may explain the use of this plant in traditional medicine in Suriname.", 
    "166": "Beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists in the treatment of chronic heart failure The incidence of chronic heart failure is high in the developed countries (1-4/1000 per year). Treatment of chronic heart failure is a therapeutic challenge. A great improvement in mortality and morbidity of heart failure patients was achieved by the introduction of beta-adrenoceptor blockers in the treatment of chronic heart failure. However only 39% of heart failure patients are treated with a beta-adrenoceptor blocker in Europe. This review outlines pathophysiology of the beta-adrenergic system during human heart failure and its alterations induced by beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Based on the results of large clinical trials, experimental-pharmacological properties of beta-adrenoceptor blockers as well as the main aspects of its clinical use are discussed."
