Norepinephrine (NE) caused marked release of glycerol from fat cells but did not activate HSL as estimated using triolein or cholesteryloleate as substrate. Propranolol, a beta-blocker, inhibited NE-induced lipolysis in fat cells without a concomitant reduction in HSL activity. The antilipolytic action of insulin on NE-induced lipolysis could not be explained by a decrease in HSL activity. Neither ACTH-induced lipolysis in fat cells nor its inhibition by insulin was accompanied by matching fluctuations in HSL activity. These results indicate that neither NE and ACTH-induced lipolysis in fat cells, nor the antilipolytic actions of propranolol and insulin, involve fluctuations in HSL activity.",

    "13": "Medical myths occur for many different reasons. A common thread is that they all make some pathophysiologic sense. A good example is the concern about using oral cobalamin when treating pernicious anemia. The difficulty in absorbing vitamin B12 when intrinsic factor is not available does not make oral replacement impossible; the dose just needs to be higher. Pathophysiologic concerns have also been a key reason why physicians have avoided using beta-blockers in patients with diabetes. They fear that beta-blockers will block adrenergic symptoms, and patients will not know when they are hypoglycemic. In studies addressing this issue, there appears to be no real problem with increased severe episodes of hypoglycemia in patients on beta-blockers or increased hypoglycemic unawareness. Several studies commented on the unanticipated symptom of increased sweating associated with hypoglycemia in diabetic patients who are taking beta-blockers. Another important concept behind some medical myths is the overreliance on case reports or authoritative text. The concern about depression associated with beta-blocker use grew out of one widely referenced case report. Subsequent studies have not shown convincing evidence for a strong association with beta-blocker use and depression. The strong position taken against narcotic use in Cope's Early Diagnosis of the Acute Abdomen is probably the reason for the perpetuation of the myth of avoiding narcotics for pain relief in patients with undiagnosed acute abdominal conditions. The only two studies addressing this issue showed no problems with diagnosis caused by providing narcotic pain relief. Newer therapies usually undergo closer scrutiny before being accepted, often including placebo-controlled trials to show the efficacy of a medication. Such might not be the case with newer technologies. It is harder to evaluate the benefit of a new technology in the face of noncomparable previous technologies. Catheterization of the right side of the heart (Swan-Ganz catheter) was a technology that became widely used before any outcome studies became available. Multiple reports in the last decade have shown increased mortality and increased utilization of resources in patients who received catheterization of the right side of the heart. Most new drug therapies require randomized data to show effects before widespread use and acceptance occur. Older therapies that have been widely accepted for a long time might not have had controlled trial data behind recommendations for their use, and once practice patterns become widespread, it is hard to change. It is always good to ask the question, \"Will this help my patient live better or longer?\" when prescribing a therapy. These myths underscore the importance and utility of outcome-based research to help guide physicians in their practices.", 
    "14": "This article is a review of chronic compensated congestive heart failure (CHF), with special reference to its clinical features and pathophysiology and recent advances in pharmacotherapy, including beta-blockers, loop diuretics, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Clinical problems related to elderly patients and multifaceted aspects of multidisciplinary approaches of medical care to these particular patients are also discussed with special emphasis on the aspect of improved quality of life associated with reduced mortality. Concepts of CHF have greatly changed over the past decades with regard to its pathophysiology, natural progression, mechanisms, causes of death, arrhythmias and treatment goals. Although the current most frequent aetiologies of CHF include coronary heart disease and dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertension has been revisited in a different way, and has been considered of pivotal importance in most recent trends and possibly in future perspectives. Nowadays, however, with the results of improved survival, alleviation of symptoms, improvement in functional capacity and prevention of associated complications including even left ventricular remodelling through various appropriate pharmacotherapies, patients with CHF are used to being physically and psychosocially more active than ever before. Thus, improvement of patients' quality of life and reduction of mortality have become of prime importance in achieving treatment goals. Another emerging aspect of CHF is aging itself, and special features in the medical care of elderly patients with CHF always have to be taken into consideration in reduction of hospital readmission along with improvement of morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in the treatment of CHF, it remains a common disease with a poor prognosis. Therefore, this review focuses on what we should be trying to achieve in reaching goals to reduce repeated hospital readmission and mortality, and increase social activity and quality of life, especially in elderly patients with CHF. In these clinical settings, educational strategies for patients and their family members should be emphasised. Multidisciplinary interventions by nurses and possibly other contributions from a widely available social support system might be effective in preventing repeated hospital readmissions of elderly patients with CHF. In this regard, special precautions have to be paid in the management of elderly patients to achieve effective treatment goals, and any treatment strategy has to be appropriately determined through a comprehensive assessment of patient clinical profiles. Multidisciplinary approaches to these problems have to be effectively utilised to improve patients' quality of life, while possibly reducing medical expenses.", 
    "15": "1. Effects of arachidonic acid, prostaglandins, retinol, retinoic acid and cholecalciferol on xenobiotic oxidations catalysed by 12 recombinant human cytochrome P450 (P450 or CYP) enzymes and by human liver microsomes have been investigated. 2. Arachidonic acid (50 microM) significantly inhibited CYP1A1- and 1A2-dependent 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylations, CYP2C8-dependent taxol 6alpha-hydroxylation and CYP2C19-dependent R-warfarin 7-hydroxylation. This chemical also inhibited slightly the xenobiotic oxidations catalysed by CYP1B1, 2B6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4 in recombinant enzyme systems. 3. Retinol, retinoic acid and cholecalciferol were strong inhibitors for xenobiotic oxidations catalysed by recombinant CYP1A1, 2C8 and 2C19. 4. Dixon plots of inhibitions of CYP1A1-, 1A2-, 2C8- and 2C19-dependent xenobiotic oxidations by arachidonic acid, of CYP1A1-, 2B6- and 2C19-dependent activities by retinol, and of CYP1A1- and 2C19-dependent activities by cholecalciferol indicated that these chemicals inhibit P450 activities mainly through a competitive mechanism. 5. In human liver microsomes, arachidonic acid inhibited CYP1A2-dependent theophylline hydroxylation, CYP2C8-dependent taxol 6alpha-hydroxylation and CYP2C19-dependent omeprazole 5-hydroxylation. Taxol 6alpha-hydroxylation was also inhibited by retinol and retinoic acid, and omeprazole 5-hydroxylation was inhibited by retinol in human liver microsomes. 6. These results suggest that xenobiotic oxidations by P450 enzymes are affected by endobiotic chemicals and that the endobiotic-xenobiotic interactions as well as drug-drug interactions may be of great importance when understanding the basis for pharmacological and toxicological actions of a number of xenobiotic chemicals.", 
    "16": "Dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice has been recognized as a model for human ulcerative colitis. Using this model, we carried out a study on the preventive effect of Icatibant, a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist previously called HOE 140, on the development of colitis. Subcutaneous administration of Icatibant (0.3 or 1.5 mg/kg) significantly suppressed shortening of the large intestine and worsening of the general health. Oral administration of Icatibant (50 mg/kg) significantly suppressed shortening of the large intestine, the onset of diarrhea, and worsening of the general health. In addition, the oral treatment significantly inhibited the development of colitis that was observed histopathologically. These results indicate a role of BK in the development of dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice, and suggest that BK could be important in human ulcerative colitis.", 
    "17": "The effects of ranolazine (CAS 95635-55-5, KEG-1295), a novel antianginal drug, on the ST-segment changes induced by coronary ligation, epinephrine, and vasopressin were examined following oral or intraduodenal administration. In anesthetized dogs, intraduodenal administration of KEG-1295 (10, 30, or 50 mg/kg) or atenolol (10 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the ST-T wave elevation induced by 2-min coronary ligation imposed during electrical heart pacing (200 beats/min). This antianginal effect of KEG-1295 persisted for 3 h without any changes in hemodynamic parameters, while that of atenolol was accompanied by more or less maintained decreases in diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and the maximum first derivative of left ventricular pressure. In anesthetized rats, oral administration of KEG-1295 (10, 30, or 50 mg/kg) attenuated the ST-T wave elevation induced by epinephrine (0.3 microgram/kg i.v.) in a dose-dependent manner, although KEG-1295 (10 or 30 mg/kg p.o.) failed to attenuate the ST-segment depression induced by vasopressin (0.2 IU/kg i.v.). These findings suggest that, taken orally, KEG-1295 may exert potent protective effects against angina pectoris, except that caused by vasospasm. Further, KEG-1295 may be categorized as a new type of antianginal agent, without any primary hemodynamic effects.", 
    "18": "In vitro studies of ciliary activity require specimens of healthy epithelium in relatively large quantities. Since human material is difficult to obtain, fresh chicken trachea samples have frequently been used in function experiments. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether several substances had comparable effects on the ciliary beat frequency (CBF) of chicken trachea and cryopreserved human respiratory epithelium obtained from the sphenoidal sinus. For this study, we used two topical anaesthetics: cocaine (3% and 7%) and lidocaine (2%). These anaesthetic substances were adjusted to pH 6 and pH 7. We also used two decongestants, namely xylometazoline 0.1% and oxymetazoline 0.1%, and the beta-blocking agent propranolol. Topical anaesthetics appeared to be more ciliostatic in solutions with pH 7 compared to pH 6. Complete ciliostatic effects were reversible, with the exception of the ciliostasis induced by propranolol. The effects of these substances on the CBF of fresh chicken trachea and cryopreserved human tissue did not differ significantly. These experiments show that chicken trachea constitutes a valid substitute for human material in studying ciliary activity in vitro. Moreover, the experiments provide evidence in support of the assumption that cryopreservation has no effect on ciliary reactivity as expressed by the CBF.", 
    "19": "The pharmacologic characterization of FR172516, a new combined calcium channel-blocking and beta-adrenoceptor-blocking agent, was studied and compared with amlodipine in receptor-binding assay and in vivo studies. In the binding assay, Ki values of FR172516 for calcium channel and beta-receptor were 29.3 nM and 44.1 nM, respectively. In the in vivo studies with pithed rats, FR172516 shifted the dose-response curves of isoproterenol in heart rate to the right, suggesting that this compound has a antiadrenoceptor effect in vivo. The hypotensive effect of FR172516, which could be mainly attributed to its calcium channel-blocking action, was compared with that of amlodipine in normotensive Wistar rats (NTRs), spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), and renal hypertensive dogs (RHDs). FR172516 showed more potent hypotensive action than amlodipine when administered intravenously to NTRs, and apparent bradycardia was seen only with FR172516. In SHRs, FR172516 showed a long-lasting hypotensive action and dose-dependently decreased heart rate, whereas amlodipine scarcely affected heart rate. In RHDs, oral administration of FR172516 once daily for 5 days decreased blood pressure without reflex tachycardia or an increase of plasma renin activity. On the other hand, amlodipine, in the dose at which hypotensive effects equipotent to those of FR172516 were observed, produced apparent reflex tachycardia and concomitant increase of plasma renin. These results indicate that FR172516 has a potent long-lasting antihypertensive effect without activating sympathetic tone by calcium channel-blocking and beta-adrenoceptor-blocking actions.", 
    "20": "The aim of this study was to compare the effects of long-term monotherapy with four different beta-blockers on plasma lipids in hypercholesterolemic hypertensive patients. We studied 152 subjects with essential hypertension [diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >90 mm Hg], total cholesterol (TC) >240 and <330 mg/dl, and triglycerides (TGs) <300 mg/dl. After a 4-week washout period with placebo, patients were randomized to receive propranolol, 160 mg/day (n = 37), atenolol, 100 mg/day (n = 38), bisoprolol, 10 mg/day (n = 39), or celiprolol, 400 mg/day (n = 38), for 18 months. No cholesterol-reducing drug was allowed. Blood samples for evaluation of TC, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), and TGs were taken before and after the placebo period and subsequently every 6 months. No beta-blocker worsened TC or LDL-C. Nonselective propranolol caused the most pronounced changes in HDL-C and TGs. Beta1-Selective atenolol produced the same qualitative effects, but to a lesser extent. The more beta1-selective bisoprolol did not affect HDL-C and TGs. Celiprolol significantly improved the lipid profile by significantly decreasing TC, LDL-C, and TGs, and increasing HDL-C. These findings suggest that in hypercholesterolemic hypertensive patients, (a) beta1-selective beta-blockers are likely to adversely affect plasma lipids to a lesser extent than nonselective ones; and (b) celiprolol is able to improve the lipid pattern, which could be because of its peculiar ancillary properties.",

    "22": "Although revitalizing dead or severely injured myocardial cells is still beyond the reach of modern treatment, the ability to change the loading conditions and the contractile state of the heart has enabled practitioners to reverse deleterious compensatory mechanisms in patients with CHF. Several new and improved medicines have made this strategy possible. Early and determined surgical treatment of patients with CHF has enabled cure of some previously debilitating or fatal defects. The combined use of surgery and interventional catheterization has allowed many patients to profit from the benefits not available from either modality alone. In the future, cellular, subcellular, and gene therapy may make the treatment of patients with CHF simple and even prevent CHD.", 
    "23": "1. The thermogenic activity of the serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor sibutramine (BTS 54524; Reductil) was investigated by measuring oxygen consumption (VO2) in rats treated with sibutramine or its two pharmacologically-active metabolites. 2. Sibutramine caused a dose-dependent rise in VO2, with a dose of 10 mg kg(-1) of sibutramine or its metabolites producing increases of up to 30% that were sustained for at least 6 h, and accompanied by significant increases (0.5-1.0 degrees C) in body temperature. 3. Based on the accumulation in vivo of radiolabelled 2-deoxy-[3H]-glucose, sibutramine had little or no effect on glucose utilization in most tissues, but caused an 18 fold increase in brown adipose tissue (BAT). 4. Combined high, non-selective doses (20 mg kg(-1)) of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, atenolol and ICI 118551, inhibited completely the VO2 response to sibutramine, but the response was unaffected by low, beta1-adrenoceptor-selective (atenolol) or beta2-adrenoceptor-selective (ICI 118551) doses (1 mg kg(-1)). 5. The ganglionic blocking agent, chlorisondamine (15 mg kg(-1)), inhibited completely the VO2 response to the metabolites of sibutramine, but had no effect on the thermogenic response to the beta3-adrenoceptor-selective agonist BRL 35135. 6. Similar thermogenic responses were produced by simultaneous injection of nisoxetine and fluoxetine at doses (30 mg kg(-1)) that had no effect on VO2 when injected individually. 7. It is concluded that stimulation of thermogenesis by sibutramine requires central reuptake inhibition of both serotonin and noradrenaline, resulting in increased efferent sympathetic activation of BAT thermogenesis via beta3-adrenoceptor, and that this contributes to the compound's activity as an anti-obesity agent.", 
    "24": "1. This study was undertaken to evaluate in vivo the influence of amiodarone on the effects of triiodothyronine (T3) in brown adipose tissue (BAT) which are independent of thyroid hormone synthesis and of the conversion of thyroxine (T4) to T3. Thyroidectomized rats were given a replacement dose of T3 (0.5 mg kg(-1) p.o. daily for 3 days) with or without amiodarone (50 mg kg(-1) p.o. daily for 1 week). 2. As assessed by RT-PCR, treatment of thyroidectomized rats with T3 caused a 2 fold decrease in beta3-adrenoceptor (beta3-AR) mRNA levels and a 2 fold increase in beta1-AR mRNA levels. 3. Binding studies using [3H]-CGP 12177 as a ligand showed that treatment of thyoidectomized rats with T3 resulted in a 70% decrease in beta3-AR number and in an 80% increase in beta1-AR in BAT membranes. 4. T3-treatment abolished the increase in BAT adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity induced by CGP12177 in thyroidectomized rats. It also decreased the amount of Gi protein (ADP-ribosylation) by 30%. 5. At variance with the literature on the heart, amiodarone administration did not inhibit the positive effect of T3 on beta1-AR expression in BAT in thyroidectomized rats. However, it antagonized the effect of T3 on beta3-AR number, but not on AC activity or on Gi expression. 6. These results indicate that the effects of thyroid hormones on the responsiveness of BAT to catecholamines involves both receptor and post-receptor mechanisms, they also suggest that interaction between amiodarone and thyroid hormones is highly tissue-specific and depends on the beta-AR subtype.", 
    "25": "NADPH-cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase (CPR) is essential for the catalytic activity of cytochrome P-450 (P-450). On a molar basis, the amount of P-450 exceeds that of CPR in human liver. In this study, we investigated whether drug-drug interactions can occur as a result of competition between P-450 isozymes for this ancillary protein. For this purpose, combinations of P-450 isozymes were coexpressed together with P-450 reductase in Escherichia coli. We show that testosterone inhibited the CYP2D6-mediated bufuralol 1'-hydroxylase activity in bacterial membranes containing both CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 but not in membranes containing CYP2D6 alone. Conversely, bufuralol inhibited the CYP3A4-mediated testosterone 6beta-hydroxylase activity in bacterial membranes containing both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 but not in membranes containing only CYP3A4. In each case, inhibition was seen even at a P-450 to P-450 reductase ratio of 1.9:1, which is more favorable than the ratio of 4 reported for human liver. The physiological significance of this mechanism was demonstrated by the observation that testosterone inhibited several prototypical P-450 enzyme activities, such as bufuralol 1'-hydroxylase, coumarin 7-hydroxylase, and 7-ethoxyresorufin O-dealkylase, in human liver microsomes, but not if tested against a panel of bacterial membranes containing the human P-450 isozymes that mainly catalyze these reactions.", 
    "26": "The effect of beta blockade on heart rate in patients with either idiopathic or ischemic cardiomyopathy was studied. It was found that beta blockade reduced the early morning increase in heart rate to a greater extent in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy than in those with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy.", 
    "27": "We and others have previously shown that carvedilol improves left ventricular (LV) function and symptoms in chronic heart failure. This improvement in LV function has also been shown to be associated with an improvement in survival. This study evaluates the effect of carvedilol on LV mass, geometry, and degree of mitral regurgitation (MR). In 59 patients with symptomatic heart failure and LV ejection fraction <0.35, previously randomized to either treatment with carvedilol or placebo, we evaluated LV mass, geometry, and degree of MR over the time period of carvedilol treatment. LV mass decreased as early as 4 months into the treatment protocol and continued to decrease over a period of 1 year. LV geometry, defined by the length/diameter ratio, and severity of MR also improved with 4 months of therapy. Thus, compared with placebo treatment, carvedilol decreases LV mass while improving cardiac geometry and decreasing MR in patients with chronic heart failure. These changes occur in association with an improvement in LV systolic function. This process begins by 4 months of treatment and continues for 12 months.",

Myocardial oxygen extraction decreased (p = 0.012) in correlation with use of the short-acting beta-blocker, esmolol (r = -0.71). Apart from a decrease in mean arterial blood pressure (p = 0.002), there were no significant hemodynamic changes during the operation. The overall postoperative troponin T and creatine kinase-MB mass changes remained nonsignificant during the first two postoperative days. One patient had a myocardial infarction, diagnosed by electrocardiography, on the second postoperative day, but otherwise there were no major complications.",

    "33": "Pharmacological management data of acute myocardial infarction survivors were collected and divided into three categories: drugs which patients received before hospitalization, during the hospitalization, and at hospital discharge. Data regarding medical history, complications during hospitalization, MI extent (Q wave or non-Q wave), infarct location and diagnostic and revascularization procedures were also recorded. This study is based on the 850 patients who met the diagnostic criteria for initial acute MI in the period examined. Among 850 patients with myocardial infarction enrolled 408 (48%) received thrombolytic therapy. The median time interval from symptom onset to initiation of thrombolytic therapy was 196 min. The most commonly used thrombolytic agent was streptokinase (93%). Thrombolytic recipients were younger, and presented sooner after onset of symptoms. Among patients receiving thrombolytic therapy, concomitant pharmacotherapy included aspirin (95%), intravenous heparin (93%), intravenous nitroglycerin (91%), oral beta-blockers (44%), calcium channel antagonists (13%), and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (41%). The lipid lowering therapy was only used in 4% of all patients, and was given to 18% of patients with hyperlipidemia.", 
    "34": "Current usage rates of thrombolytic therapy in Turkey are lower than expected, but when compared with previous reports it increased. Although adjunctive treatment with intravenous heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin is usually used, beta-blockers appear to be underused and calcium channel blockers appear to be overused. The lipid reducing therapies were infrequently prescribed.", 
    "35": "In this study, the effect of celiprolol (beta-1-antagonist with beta-2-agonistic activity) on hemodynamic and electrocardiographic parameters of patients with congestive heart failure due to ischemic (iCMP) and non-ischemic (niCMP) origin should be evaluated. Sixteen patients were included into the study, nine with iCMP, seven with niCMP. All patients were investigated by radionuclide ventriculography (99mTc), right heart floating catheterization, and late potential analysis and measurement of heart rate variability. All patients received 200 mg celiprolol after a 3-day period of 100 mg celiprolol/day. All patients showed, after a follow-up period of 3 months, a significant improvement of the left ventricular ejection fraction. The changes of hemodynamic parameters were more pronounced in patients with niCMP. Heart rate did not decrease in patients with niCMP. A 3-month therapy with celiprolol as an additional therapy to a preexisting heart failure therapy leads to a significant improvement of the ejection fraction in patients with congestive heart failure. Patients with niCMP seemed to profit more from this additional beta-blocking therapy.", 
    "36": "Calcium antagonists continue to have a place in the treatment of hypertension, despite recent concerns regarding their safety and long-term capacity to alter the natural history of cardiovascular disease. Results of a well-designed cohort study concerning a very elderly population suggested that administration of shorft-acting nifedipine is linked to an increase in mortality, particularly when a high dose is administered and when the initiaol blood pressure is below 160/90 mmHg. The risk of using short-acting verapamil, however, was no greater than that of beta-blockade. These differences can be attributed at least in part to the low catecholamine profile of verapamil and to the marked rapid adrenergic activation with short-acting nifedipine. Current evidence sujggests that less catecholamine activation occurs during the chronic use of long-acting dihydropyridine agents. Two recent studies have shown that the combination of verapamil and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor reduces numbers of cardiovascular disease events among postinfarct patients with heart failure, and that the dihydropyridine nitrendipine reduces poor outcome measures, such as stroke incidence, in treating systolic hypertension in the elderly. In my view, apparent hazards such as the precipitation of myocardial infarction and cancer are discounted by the available evidence. While we await further major trials concerning outcomes, general safety can be related to a preference for administering those long-acting agents that do not stimulate and may even inhibit adrenergic responses, and the avoidance of possible adverse effects through the use of combination therapies, such as verapamil plus an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or nifedipine plus a beta-blocker.", 
    "37": "The aims of this study were to examine whether pindolol, a serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT])-1A receptor antagonist, and mianserin, a 5-HT2A/C and alpha2-adrenoceptor (alpha2-AR) antagonist, may augment the clinical efficacy of fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, and shorten the latency of onset of antidepressive activity in the treatment of major and treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Ten days after admission to the hospital, 31 major depressed patients were randomly assigned using a double-blind, controlled design to receive fluoxetine 20 mg daily, fluoxetine 20 mg daily plus pindolol 7.5 mg daily, or fluoxetine 20 mg plus mianserin 30 mg daily for 5 weeks. The 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) score was the primary outcome measure. Analysis of efficacy was conducted according to the intent-to-treat analysis principle considering the change from baseline to endpoint. It was found that fluoxetine plus pindolol and fluoxetine plus mianserin were significantly more effective than fluoxetine alone. Using an outcome measure of 50% reduction in the HAM-D, a 60% response rate was found in patients treated with either fluoxetine plus pindolol or fluoxetine plus mianserin compared with a 9% response rate in patients treated with fluoxetine alone. The HAM-D score 1 week after starting fluoxetine plus mianserin decreased more than 4 points and was significantly greater than that obtained by fluoxetine alone. The results suggest that pindolol and mianserin augment the efficacy of fluoxetine in the treatment of TRD and that mianserin, but not pindolol, may significantly shorten the latency of onset of antidepressive action when combined with fluoxetine.", 
    "38": "The effects of l-amphetamine on the spontaneous firing of central neurons of African snails (Achatina fulica Ferussac) were studied electrophysiologically. The effects of dopamine, noradrenaline, d-amphetamine, and methamphetamine on the central neurons also were tested. The l- and d-amphetamines (0.3 mM) elicited bursting firing of action potentials in the RP4 neuron of the snail, whereas dopamine (0.3 mM), noradrenaline (NE, 0.3 mM), and methamphetamine (2 mM) did not. The bursting firing of action potentials elicited by l-amphetamine was decreased if potassium-free solution, sodium-free solution, or solution containing oubain (0.1 mM), a sodium pump inhibitor, was perfused. The results suggested that l-amphetamine did, and methamphetamine did not, elicit a sodium-dependent bursting firing of action potentials of the neuron.", 
    "39": "EGIS-7229 is a novel antiarrhythmic candidate having multiple mechanisms of action with class III predominance. In this study, the effects of EGIS-7229 and sotalol on action potential duration (APD) and incidence of early afterdepolarizations (EADs) were studied and compared in rabbit papillary muscle by using conventional microelectrode techniques. In control bathing solution, both drugs increased APD in a concentration-dependent manner; however, the prolongation of APD was greater with sotalol than with EGIS-7229 when the same drug concentrations were compared. EAD developed in 3 of the 11 preparations (27%) bathed with a solution containing 3.6 mmol/l CsCl + 2 mmol/l KCl within the first 120 min of superfusion. The addition of 100 micromol/l sotalol to this superfusate increased the incidence of EAD to 83% (10 from 12), whereas the addition of the same concentration of EGIS-7229 prevented the development of EAD in all of the 9 preparations studied. These differences in incidence of EAD are likely attributable to differences in drug-induced increases of APD-50 in the presence of CsCl. Prolongation of APD-90 showed less correlation with incidence of EAD than changes in APD-50. On the basis of these in vitro results, high concentrations of EGIS-7229 cannot be expected to be torsadogenic in vivo--in contrast with sotalol--presumably owing to the combined class III + IV activity of the compound.", 
    "40": "Quantification of myocardial beta-adrenoceptor density (Bmax) is of interest in cardiac diseases in which altered function of the sympathetic nervous system is thought to play a pathophysiological role. PET provides an unrivaled means of taking regional measurements of cardiac microcirculatory function, tissue metabolism and autonomic nervous system activity. Measurements in small regional areas may be biased because of increased noise levels. This study examined the parametric polar map approach for the regional quantification of Bmax.", 
    "41": "Dynamic PET with parametric polar map imaging was performed in 10 healthy volunteers and 4 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy using (S)-[11C]-(4-(3-tertiarybutylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)-benzidimaz ole-2)-on hydrochloride (CGP)-12177 and a double-injection protocol. Time-activity curves were corrected for partial volume, spill-over and wall motion effects. The mean Bmax of the left ventricle was calculated in two ways. First, the average time-activity curve of all segments, having the highest achievable signal-to-noise ratio, was used to calculate Bmax(mTAC) (the myocardial beta-adrenoceptor density of the left ventricle calculated using the average time-activity curve). The bias in Bmax(mTAC) introduced by noise is minimal. Second, an estimate of whole-heart receptor density was calculated using the polar map method by averaging the values of Bmax obtained for 576 individual segments. In these calculations, three different filters (3 x 5, 3 x 9 and 3 x 13 segments) were used to smooth the time-activity curves before calculating Bmax. Mean values of whole-left-ventricular receptor density obtained by averaging regional values using the different filters (Bmax(PMF1/2/3)) were compared with Bmax(mTAC) to assess bias introduced by the polar map approach. Segments with a calculated Bmax outside the range 0.1-50 pmol/g were considered unreliable and were excluded from the analysis.", 
    "42": "The differences between the two methods of calculating Bmax were small (7.8%, 4.8% and 3.2%, with the three filters, respectively). Reliable results were obtained in >95% of the segments and in 9 volunteers and all 4 patients.",

    "44": "Amygdaloid kindled seizures in the rat induce an abrupt elevation of blood pressure accompanied by a significant decrease in heart rate. The autonomic pharmacology of this response was examined in unanesthetized kindled rats. Muscarinic receptor blockade with atropine (1 mg/kg, intravenous (i.v.)) abolished the seizure-induced bradycardia. The seizure-induced hypertension was unaffected by beta-adrenergic blockade with timolol (1 mg/kg, i.v.), but was reduced by phentolamine (5 mg/kg, subcutaneous (s.c.)), an alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist. A chemical sympathectomy was induced with 6-hydroxydopamine (100 mg/kg, i.v.), an agent that does not cross the blood-brain barrier. This eliminated the pressor response but did not completely block the seizure-induced bradycardia. The effectiveness of 6-hydroxydopamine was tested with tyramine (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.) an agent that releases endogenous catecholamines. These results indicate amygdaloid kindled seizures activate both branches of the autonomic nervous system. The bradycardia was mediated by the parasympathetic system; the pressor response was caused by an increase in peripheral resistance due to alpha-adrenergic receptor activation. More important, these findings show that kindling is a useful seizure model for future studies on the effect of seizures on cardiovascular function and possible mechanisms of seizure-related sudden unexplained death.",

    "46": "We studied patients with moderate to severe heart failure, who were enrolled in an international survival study, and compared patterns of drug use between the nine countries that each included >50 patients in the study. The results were analysed to determine whether observed differences between countries could be explained by differences in the patients recruited. 1825 patients were studied (range 81-427 per country). By trial protocol, most patients were treated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (92%) and all with diuretics, but the proportion of patients taking high doses of these drugs was markedly different between countries. Large differences were also observed in the use of digoxin (overall 64%, 39% in the U.K. to 87% in Germany) and antiarrhythmics (overall 25%, with the highest use 44% in France). The use of beta-blockers and calcium antagonists was low (overall 6% and 8%, respectively), but also different between countries. Anticoagulants (overall 43%) were used in many patients in the Netherlands and Switzerland (around 70%), while antiplatelets (overall use 30%) were most often prescribed in Denmark (51%).", 
    "47": "Large differences in drug use and dosing for patients with advanced heart failure are observed between (European) countries. None of these differences could be explained by differences in patient characteristics, and whether they are related to factors such as tradition, economic circumstances and national guidelines, etc. is unknown.",

In contrast, beta-blocker and diuretic use has decreased. It has been suggested that pharmaceutical marketing has influenced these prescribing patterns. No objective analysis of advertising for antihypertensive therapies exists, however.", 
    "49": "We reviewed the January, April, July, and October issues of the New England Journal of Medicine from 1985 to 1996 (210 issues). The intensity of drug promotion was measured as the proportion of advertising pages used to promote a given medication. Statistical analyses used the chi2 test for trend. Advertising for CCBs increased from 4.6% of advertising pages in 1985 to 26.9% in 1996, while advertising for beta-blockers (12.4% in 1985 to 0% in 1996) and diuretics (4.2% to 0%) decreased (all P<0.0001). A nonsignificant increase was observed in advertising for ACE inhibitors (3.5% to 4.3%, P=0.17). Although the total number of drug advertising pages per issue decreased from 60 pages in 1985 to 42 pages in 1996 (P<0.001), the number of pages devoted to calcium channel blocker advertisements nearly quadrupled.", 
    "50": "Increasing promotion of CCBs has mirrored trends in physician prescribing. An association between advertising and prescribing patterns could explain why CCBs have supplanted better-substantiated therapies for hypertension.", 
    "51": "Airway mucociliary transport (MCT), which continuously removes inhaled particles and cellular debris from deep in the lung, is impaired in a number of diseases such as bronchitis and asthma. In order to determine the effects of candidate drugs on MCT function in the airway, a new in situ method to measure MCT function was established. MCT function is represented by the distance a gelatin solution containing Evans blue as a marker moves after injection into the trachea. The basal rate of dye transport in non-treated guinea-pigs was 4.4+/-0.2 mm/min. The beta2-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol (2, 6, 10, 20 mg/kg, po), dose-dependently accelerated the basal MCT rate. However, its effect was completely inhibited by pretreatment with the non-selective beta -adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol (1 mg/kg, iv). MCT function in guinea-pigs was significantly attenuated to 2.6+/-0.3 mm/min by SO2 gas exposure. Salbutamol failed to prevent MCT dysfunction in SO2-exposed animals at doses previously shown to accelerate basal MCT rate. This simple method is useful for estimating MCT function in several airway disease models and for examining new drugs designed to improve MCT function in airway diseases.", 
    "52": "The racemic mixture propranolol (RS-(+/-)-, and the S-(-)- and R-(+)-) isomers of propranolol have been shown to induce bronchial hyperresponsiveness in the guinea-pig unrelated to beta-adrenoreceptor occupancy, that is attenuated by vagal section and mediated via the generation of 5-lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid. We have investigated the role of sensory nerves in propranolol-induced bronchial hyperresponsiveness in guinea-pigs. Airways responsiveness to acetylcholine, bradykinin and bombesin was determined before and 10 min after intravenous infusion with RS-(+/-)-, S-(-)- and R-(+)-propranolol (1 mg/kg) in vehicle and capsaicin-treated guinea-pigs. Propranolol (1 mg/kg, iv) significantly augmented the bronchoconstrictor response to acetylcholine, bradykinin and bombesin (P<0.001), an effect that was observed for RS-(+/-)-, S-(-)- and R-(+)-propranolol. In capsaicin-treated animals, the increased airways responsiveness to acetylcholine following intravenous infusion of S-(-)-propranolol was significantly inhibited. Capsaicin treatment tended to reduce the increase in airways responsiveness to bradykinin following infusion with R-(+)-propranolol, but was only significant for the highest dose used. Similarly, capsaicin treatment had no effect on the ability of RS-(+/-)-, S-(-)- and R-(+)-propranolol to enhance the bronchoconstrictor response to bombesin. Our results suggest that propranolol-induced bronchial hyperresponsiveness to certain spasmogens is in part mediated by the action of capsaicin-sensitive nerves.", 
    "53": "Medication classes historically used in the management of glaucoma include beta blockers, miotics, sympathomimetics and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Because topically applied medications are more site specific, they are preferred in the treatment of glaucoma. Compared with oral medications, topical agents are associated with a decreased incidence of systemic side effects. With topical administration, conjunctival and localized skin allergic reactions are relatively common, whereas severe reactions, including death, are rare. Recently introduced topical agents for glaucoma therapy include dorzolamide and brinzolamide, the first topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors; brimonidine and apraclonidine, more ocular-specific alpha agonists; and latanoprost, a prostaglandin analog, which is a new class of glaucoma medication. Latanoprost has the unique side effect of increasing iris pigmentation. Like their predecessors, the newer agents lower intraocular pressure by a statistically significant degree. Preservation of visual field, the more substantial patient-oriented end point, continues to be studied.", 
    "54": "Imidazolines are regarded as a pharmacological group of insulin secretagogues with one uniform mechanism of action, namely closure of ATP-dependent K+ channels (K(ATP) channels) and, in consequence, depolarization of the plasma membrane, Ca2+ influx and stimulation of secretion. This assumption was investigated by measuring insulin secretion from perifused pancreatic islets in response to three imidazoline compounds and comparing the characteristics of secretion with changes in membrane potential and cytosolic Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+]i of single beta-cells. Phentolamine (32 microM) stimulated insulin secretion from perifused mouse islets in the presence of stimulatory (10 mM and 30 mM) and substimulatory (5 mM) glucose concentrations and even in the absence of glucose. Idazoxan in concentrations up to 500 microM was virtually ineffective in the presence of 5 mM glucose. At 10 mM glucose, there was a moderate but significant increase of secretion by idazoxan, 20 microM being nearly as effective as 100 microM. The effect of phentolamine was of slow onset and irreversible in the time frame of the experiments, while the effect of idazoxan was of fast onset and reversible. Alinidine also stimulated secretion in the presence of 10 mM glucose with fast and reversible kinetics, but in contrast to idazoxan, 100 microM was clearly more effective than 20 microM. These heterogeneous characteristics of secretion were reflected by changes of [Ca2+]i: the increase of [Ca2+]i by phentolamine was slow and only partially reversible, whereas idazoxan led to a smaller, but faster and reversible response. The increase of [Ca2+]i by phentolamine and idazoxan was abolished by the Ca2+ channel blocker D 600. Surprisingly, all three compounds depolarized the beta-cell plasma membrane from a resting potential of -71 mV to about -36 mV. Again, the effect of phentolamine was slow and that of idazoxan and alinidine fast. Thus, the characteristics of phentolamine-induced secretion appear to be attributable to the consequences of K(ATP) channel closure. It is unclear, however, why all three test compounds achieved the same degree of depolarization in spite of their known different efficiency to close K(ATP) channels. Apparently, there are additional mechanisms involved in the action of idazoxan and alinidine, which may contribute to the obvious differences in the characteristics of secretion.",

    "56": "Twelve men with AF (65+/-8 years) participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of betaxolol (20 mg daily). Patients underwent maximal exercise testing with ventilatory gas exchange analysis, and a separate, submaximal test (50% of maximum) during which cardiac output was measured by a CO2 rebreathing technique.", 
    "57": "After betaxolol therapy, heart rate was reduced both at rest (92+/-27 vs 62+/-12 beats/min; p < 0.001) and at peak exercise (173+/-22 vs 116+/-24 beats/min; p < 0.001). Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2) was reduced by 19% after betaxolol (21.8+/-5.3 with placebo vs 17.6+/-5.1 mL/kg/min with betaxolol; p < 0.05), with similar reductions observed for maximal exercise time, minute ventilation, and CO2 production. VO2 was reduced by a similar extent (19%) at the ventilatory threshold. Submaximal cardiac output was reduced by 15% during betaxolol therapy (12.9+/-2.3 vs 10.9+/-1.3 L/min; p < 0.05), and stroke volume was higher (88.0+/-21 vs 105.6+/-19 mL/beat; p < 0.05).", 
    "58": "Betaxolol therapy in patients with AF effectively controlled the ventricular rate at rest and during exercise, but also caused considerable reductions in maximal VO2 and cardiac output during exercise.

With association of oral verapamil and betablockers (nadolol) the patient remained asymptomatic without recurrence of ventricular tachycardia over a follow-up of 1 year. In case of failure of monotherapy with verapamil or betablockers alone, an association of both can be effective and safe also in pediatric age. Radiofrequency catheter ablation should be reserved, especially in pediatric age, only to patients with impaired ventricular function who are not responsive to medical therapy.", 
    "60": "Ocular hemodynamics is followed u p in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma after local application of 1% pilocarpine and 0.5% timolol maleate for 30 days. Forty-two patients (48 eyes) aged 47-82 years with initial, well-developed, and far-advanced condition were followed up. Diastolic, m ean dynamic pressure in the orbital artery, and perfusion pressure were measured. A significant decrease of diastolic pressure in the orbital artery, more expressed during the first ten days was observed in all patients. Later this value increased till the end of follow-up, but did not reach the initial level. Hence, patients with visual field loss are characterized by a higher local vascular tone and are less liable to its decrease after the above local hypotensive therapy.", 
    "61": "In this study, we investigated the mechanism of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) transport of bunitrolol (BTL), as a model of beta-blocker, in vivo and in vitro. In order to define the contribution of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) to the active efflux of BTL from brain to blood, we examined the in vivo brain distribution of BTL in mdr1a(-/-) mice with a disrupted mdr1a gene. After intravenous administration of BTL to mdr1a(-/-) mice, the brain concentration and Kp value of BTL were significantly increased as compared with those in mdr1a(+/+) mice. Next, the contribution of the mdr1a P-gp to in vitro uptake of BTL was compared in LV500 cells and L cells (mouse mdr1a-expressing cells and host cells, respectively). The intracellular accumulations of [3H]vinblastine and BTL by LV500 cells were lower than those by L cells, but were significantly increased by verapamil, a P-gp inhibitor. Furthermore, the BTL uptake by KB-VJ300 cells, which express human P-gp, was also significantly lower than that by KB host cells, and was increased by verapamil. The steady-state uptake of BTL by LLC-GA5-COL300 cells, expressing human P-gp, was significantly increased in the presence of 20 microM cyclosporin A (another P-gp inhibitor), which had no effect in the LLC-PK1 host cells. On the other hand, the steady-state intracellular accumulation of BTL by MBEC4 cells, which express mdr1b P-gp instead of mdr1a P-gp, was not significantly changed in the presence of verapamil. This finding suggested that BTL is not a good substrate for mdr1b P-gp. In conclusion, our results suggest that BTL is transported from brain to blood by mdr1a P-gp in mice and by MDR1 in humans, and this presumably accounts for the low brain distribution of BTL.", 
    "62": "The effect of endogenous catecholamines on pancreatic secretion was analyzed with nisoxetine, a specific norepinephrine uptake blocker, and specific adrenoceptor antagonists in anesthetized acute fistula rats. Nisoxetine was administered alone or with alpha-1 (prazosin), alpha-2 (idazoxan or yohimbine), or beta (propranolol) adrenoceptor antagonists. Pancreatic secretion was measured in basal conditions or after stimulation by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG), electrical vagal stimulation, or acetylcholine. (a) Basal. Nisoxetine alone had no effect. Associated with idazoxan or yohimbine, nisoxetine produced a dose-related stimulation (p < 0.01) of water and electrolyte without changing protein output. Addition of propranolol abolished this stimulation. (b) 2DG. Nisoxetine inhibited 2DG-induced secretion (p < 0.01). Idazoxan or yohimbine suppressed the nisoxetine inhibition of water and electrolyte output (p < 0.01) but had no effect on protein output, which was restored only by adding a mixture of idazoxan, prazosin, and propranolol. (c) Electrical stimulation. Nisoxetine did not modify water and electrolyte but inhibited protein response by 75%. Adding idazoxan to nisoxetine significantly increased (p < 0.01) water and bicarbonate response and partly restored protein response. Water and bicarbonate response was restored by propranolol, whereas protein response was only restored by adding a mixture of idazoxan, prazosin, and propranolol. (d) Nisoxetine did not modify pancreatic response to acetylcholine. In conclusion, endogenous norepinephrine affects the response to vagally mediated effects through several subtypes of adrenoceptors, without changing basal or acetylcholine stimulated secretion.",

    "67": "This study introduces new neural network based methods for the assessment of the dynamics of the heart rate variability (HRV) signal. The heart rate regulation is assessed as a dynamical system operating in chaotic regimes. Radial-basis function (RBF) networks are applied as a tool for learning and predicting the HRV dynamics. HRV signals are analyzed from normal subjects before and after pharmacological autonomic nervous system (ANS) blockade and from diabetic patients with dysfunctional ANS. The heart rate of normal subjects presents notable predictability. The prediction error is minimized, in fewer degrees of freedom, in the case of diabetic patients. However, for the case of pharmacological ANS blockade, although correlation dimension approaches indicate significant reduction in complexity, the RBF networks fail to reconstruct adequately the underlying dynamics. The transient attributes of the HRV dynamics under the pharmacological disturbance is elucidated as the explanation for the prediction inability.", 
    "68": "The purpose of the present study is to determine the effect of chronic electroconvulsive shock (ECS) on the expression of beta-adrenergic receptors in rat brain by Western blot using mAb beta CO2, a monoclonal antibody against beta-adrenergic receptors. Rats in ECS treated groups received maximal ECS (70 mA, 0.5 second, 60 Hz) through ear-clip electrodes for 12 consecutive days. The experiment was carried out in 14 discrete regions of brain. Chronic ECS reduced the expression of beta-adrenergic receptors in frontal cortex, temporal cortex, parietooccipital cortex, hippocampus and limbic forebrain, but not in other areas of brain. The regional specificity and the magnitude of the reduction of receptor expression are well correlated with those of the reduction of receptor ligand binding, which was determined using [3H]dihydroalprenolol. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate that chronic ECS decreases the expression of receptor protein in specific regions of rat brain.", 
    "69": "Gellan gum beads of propranolol hydrochloride, a hydrophilic model drug, were prepared by solubilising the drug in a dispersion of gellan gum and then dropping the dispersion into calcium chloride solution. The droplets formed gelled beads instantaneously by ionotropic gelation. Major formulation and process variables which might influence the preparation of the beads and the drug release from gellan gum beads were studied. Very high entrapment efficiencies were obtained (92%) after modifying the pH of both the gellan gum dispersion and the calcium chloride solution. The beads could be stored for 3 weeks in a wet or dried state without modification of the drug release. Oven-dried beads released the drug somewhat more slowly than the wet or freeze-dried beads. The drug release from oven-dried beads was slightly affected by the pH of the dissolution medium. Gellan gum could be a useful carrier for the encapsulation of fragile drugs and provides new opportunities in the field of bioencapsulation.",

In the present study, effects of the ionic strengths of adsorption medium and dissolution medium on drug adsorption onto and release from a acrylic acid grafted poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PAA-PVDF) were studied. Despite their porosity, PAA-PVDF membranes act reasonable well as cation exchange membranes. It was observed, that ionic strength of adsorption medium, degree of grafting and concentration of propranolol-HCl in adsorption medium affect propranolol-HCl adsorption onto the membrane. The fluxes of smaller molecules (MW < 500) across the membrane decreased with ionic strength of buffer solution, whereas the fluxes of the large molecules (FITC-dextran, MW 4400) increased with ionic strength. Release rate of adsorbed propranolol-HCl from the membrane into phosphate buffer was greatly affected by ionic strength of adsorption medium. These results can be explained by a cation exchange process between membrane and cations present in the buffer solution and swelling behavior of the grafted PAA chains.", 
    "71": "While the analysis of in vitro dissolution-in vivo absorption relationships from oral solid dosage forms provides biopharmaceutical insight and regulatory benefit, no well developed method exists to predict dissolution-absorption relationships a priori to human studies. The objective was to develop an integrated dissolution/Caco-2 system to predict dissolution-absorption relationships, and hence the contributions of dissolution and intestinal permeation to overall drug absorption for fast and slow formulations of piroxicam, metoprolol, and ranitidine. Dissolution studies were conducted on fast and slow dissolving immediate-release formulations of piroxicam, metoprolol tartrate, and ranitidine HCl. Dissolution samples were treated with concentrated buffers to render them suitable (i.e., isotonic and neutral pH) for Caco-2 monolayer permeation studies. The dissolution/Caco-2 system yielded a predicted dissolution-absorption relationship for each formulation which matched the observed relationship from clinical studies. The dissolution/Caco-2 system's prediction of dissolution or permeation rate-limited absorption also agreed with the clinical results. For example, the dissolution/Caco-2 system successfully predicted the slow piroxicam formulation to be dissolution rate-limited, and the fast piroxicam formulation to be permeation rate-limited. Moreover, the system predicted this change from dissolution rate-limited absorption for slow piroxicam to permeation rate-limited absorption for fast piroxicam, in spite of piroxicam's high permeability and low solubility. The dissolution/Caco-2 system may prove to be a valuable tool in formulation development. Broader evaluation of such a system is warranted.",

    "73": "A large body of evidence suggests that persistently high heart rate may be associated with a significant increase in sudden death, myocardial infarction and total mortality. Such deleterious effects may be mediated via neurohumoral activation. Conversely, interventions, such as beta-blockers, that consistently reduce heart rate may reduce sudden death and prolong survival, especially in patients who survive myocardial infarction. Thus, the deleterious effect of antianginal compounds, which may increase heart rate, is especially important in chronic myocardial syndromes as well as in chronic stable angina. In this setting, the evidence is consistent with the belief that antianginal agents that increase heart rate significantly, irrespective of their other properties, may also increase the incidence of myocardial infarction or death, in contrast to agents that induce little or no tachycardic effect or those that produce frankly bradycardic responses. Data discussed in this paper indicate that long acting calcium channel blockers of the dihydropyridine type do not increase heart rate significantly. Their slower onset and offset of action may reflect a lack of neurohumoral activation, recently confirmed in the case of nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS). Data from the Nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system Circadian Antiischemic Program (N-CAP) study, summarized herein, confirmed that the GITS formulation produces a minimal increase in heart rate over a period of 24 h. When the compound was given alone or with a beta-blocker, it was highly effective in suppressing symptomatic and asymptomatic episodes of myocardial ischemia in patients with chronic stable angina. These findings have important implications for the treatment of ischemia in patients with chronic stable angina.",

The B2 receptor antagonist, Hoe 140 (D-Arg0-[ Hyp3, Thi5, D-Tic7, Oic8]-BK) at 10(-7) M, significantly shifted to the right the IP3 response curves to BK giving apparent pKB values of 8.56, 9.79 and 8.84 for hB2-CHO, rB2-CHO and INT407 cells, respectively. 4. In human isolated umbilical vein, Hoe 140, D-Arg0-[Hyp3, D-Phe7, Leu8]-BK and NPC 567 had a lower potency in functional assays (pKB 8.18, 5.77 and 5.60, respectively) than expected from their affinity in binding studies (pKi 10.52, 8.64 and 8.27, respectively). 5. FR173657 behaved as a high affinity ligand with pKi values of 8.59 and 9.81 and potent competitive antagonist with pKB values of 7.80 and 8.17 in HUV and RU, respectively. FR173657 bound with a similar affinity the cloned and native bradykinin B2 receptor in human (pKi of 8.66 and 8.59, respectively) and in rat (pKi 9.67 and 9.81, respectively). 6. In conclusion, we suggest that the binding buffer composition has to be taken into account when screening new compounds and that inter-species differences should be considered when setting up animal models with the aim of developing bradykinin B2 receptor antagonists as therapeutic agents.", 
    "75": "The objective of this analysis was to determine whether changes in baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) within 35 hypertensive patients (25 M, 10 F, mean age 47 years) treated with beta-blockade as monotherapy relate to reductions in ambulatory blood pressure (BP) or its variability. BP was recorded intra-arterially directly from the brachial artery before and during submaximal exercise. BRS was determined by the phenylephrine injection technique. MAP and its variability were determined for the awake period of 24-h BP monitoring. Subjects were randomised to one of atenolol, metoprolol, pindolol, or propranolol, and restudied after a mean of 5 months. Beta-blockade increased BRS in 24 patients and decreased BRS in 11. BRS increased from 6.53+/-4.94 to 9.40+/-8.62 ms/mm Hg (mean +/- s.d.) (P<0.01). Waking ambulatory MAP decreased from 125.8+/-15.8 to 106.4+/-16.2 mm Hg (P<0.0001), but its variability did not change. Higher BRS after chronic beta-blockade was associated with a decrease in waking ambulatory MAP (r = -0.55, P<0.001), but not with its variability (r = -0.08). Beta-blockade attenuated the pressor response to exercise, but there was a positive relationship between the effect of beta-blockade on BRS, and on the rise in systolic BP during bicycling (r = 0.63; P<0.001). Any dampening effect of beta-blockade on BP variability at rest in hypertensive patients with the greatest increase in BRS may be offset by increased pressor responses to physical activity such as exercise. Consequently, BP variability is unaffected, even though reductions in ambulatory BP during chronic beta-blockade are inversely related to changes in BRS. BP responses to beta-blockade may be a function of the action of this class of drugs on BRS. However, there is considerable variation, between subjects, in their effect on BRS. This may have implications for other conditions, such as dilated cardiomyopathy, or following myocardial infarction, in which improvement in BRS is one mechanism by which beta-adrenoceptor blockade could improve survival.", 
    "76": "Agonist-activated beta2-adrenoceptors rapidly internalize and then recycle to the cell surface, however chronic agonist eventually causes receptor downregulation. To characterize beta2-adrenoceptor trafficking kinetics and intracellular sorting during downregulation, human embryonic kidney cells expressing epitope-tagged receptors were examined by radioligand binding with (+/-)-[3H]4-(3-tertiarybutylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)-benzimidazole- 2-on hydrochloride ([3H]CGP12177) and immunofluorescence microscopy. The first-order receptor recycling rate constant declined after 18 h of agonist compared with 15 min (0.05 min(-1) vs. 0.12 min(-1)), thus increasing the intracellular transit time (20.0 min vs. 8.3 min). There was also a reduction in the rate of receptor endocytosis and a decline in the total number of receptors. Although the intracellular receptor fraction did not increase between 15 min and 18 h of agonist, some receptors moved irreversibly into a protease-containing compartment while retaining radioligand binding activity. Our results indicate that beta2-adrenoceptor downregulation is associated principally with an increased intracellular transit time during recycling. This could promote the diversion of receptors into protease-containing compartments, where there is an irreversible commitment to downregulation prior to loss of radioligand binding activity.", 
    "77": "Acquired long QT syndrome develops as a result of pharmacological interventions that prolong action potential duration. Excessive action potential prolongation may lead to torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. To study this arrhythmia, in vivo models have been developed, but are difficult to interpret due to the complex nature of the intact metabolic, nervous and humoral systems. To more clearly examine the propensity of various Class III agents to elicit torsades de pointe, an in vitro model of spontaneous torsades de pointe was used in isolated perfused rabbit hearts. Male New Zealand white rabbits were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital, and hearts isolated and perfused in a Langendorff apparatus. Electrocardiogram and epicardial monophasic action potentials were continuously recorded, and methoxamine (30 nM) and acetylcholine (0.3 microM) were given throughout the experiment. After 10 min of methoxamine and acetylcholine perfusion, Class III agents, dofetilide (0.1 to 0.7 microM), E-4031 (0.1 to 0.5 microM), D-sotalol (10 to 30 microM), or clofilium (0.1 to 0.3 microM), were given. All agents, except D-sotalol, induced torsades de pointe in 100% of hearts tested. D-Sotalol (30 microM) elicited a low incidence of torsades de pointe (25%). This could be explained by the limited prolongation of action potential duration with D-sotalol as compared to other Class III agents under these conditions. Dofetilide, a selective Class III agent, alone did not induce torsades de pointe. Nadolol (3 microM), a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, increased the propensity of dofetilide to elicit torsades de pointe. In conclusion, increases in action potential duration (i.e., using Class III agents) in combination with a low heart rate (muscarinic receptor stimulation) and increases in intracellular Ca2+ (alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation) are needed to develop torsades de pointe in this model. Modulating these systems may provide us with new insights into preventing the initiation or maintenance of this arrhythmia.", 
    "78": "Our objective in this study was summing up of results of clinical studies on effectiveness of a selective alpha-adrenoblocker doxazosine in the pharmacotherapy of reflex and spastic disorders of outflow of urine. Doxazosine (\"Cardura\", Pfizer Inc.) was prescribed per os once per day in the morning after meal in a dose of 2-4 mg. The drug can be used not only as a hypotensive agent but also in conservative treatment of patients with prostate hyperplasia. It was found to be very effective in attempts to bring the disordered outflow of urine back to normal in patients presenting with calculi in the lower third of ureters as well as those with prior prostata resection; in affections of and injuries to the brain and spinal cord.", 
    "79": "In the present study the effects of beta-adrenergic antagonist and alpha-adrenergic agonist drugs on rabbit corneas were evaluated in vivo by using transmission electron microscopy. Twenty-four New Zealand albino rabbits were divided into six groups according to the drug applied. The rabbits to which only balanced salt solution (BSS) or BSS and benzalkonium chloride (BAC) were applied were taken as the control groups. The other four groups consisted of the rabbits to which Timoptic 0.5%, Betagan 0.5%, Betoptic 0.5% and Iopidine 1% were applied, respectively. All of drugs were instilled topically twice daily for 6 weeks. In the BSS group, all layers of the cornea were ultrastructurally normal. In the BSS and BAC group slight epithelial and endothelial changes were found. However, in the other groups, loss of microvilli, increase in glycogen particles, nuclear indentation, widening of the intercellular spaces and cytoplasmic vacuolization in epithelium were observed. No significant abnormality was found in the basal lamina, stroma and Descemet's membrane. Slight ultrastructural changes were noted in the endothelium such as vacuolization due to dilatation of the endoplasmic reticulum cisternae and focal cytoplasmic lytic areas. The results of this study indicate that various ultrastructural changes occur in groups treated with antiglaucomatous drug and that topical treatment with timolol and apraclonidine for 6 weeks is more toxic to the rabbit cornea than levobunolol and betaxolol.", 
    "80": "The pineal gland is innervated by pinealopetal peptidergic fibers originating in the hypothalamic nuclei which release arginine vasopressin (AVP) and arginine vasotocin (AVT) from their endings. Since the mechanism of AVT action on the pineal signal transduction and melatonin synthesis has not been determined so far, we examined the effect of AVT on the phosphoinositide signalling system and the N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in the rat pineal gland. The effect of AVP 4-9 fragment and AVP analogue desmopressin was also tested. The phosphoinositide signalling system was studied by measuring 32P labelling of phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) and phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) which reflects PI cycle activation. AVT (10(-5) and 10(-4) M) induced a significant increase in 32P labelling of PI, PIP and PIP2. The AVT mediated activation of the PI signal cascade was supressed by the vasopressin V1 receptor antagonist. The desmopressin and AVP 4-9 fragment were without the effect on PI signalling. To assess the AVT role in the melatonin synthesis we studied the daily pattern of the pineal NAT activity in rats treated by AVT (10 microg/100 g b.w). AVT application in the dark period of the day significantly increased nocturnal NAT activity. It can be summarized that AVT activates PI signalling system and potentiates NAT activity in the rat pineal gland.", 
    "81": "Intracerebroventricular injections of capsaicin at 100-500 nmol elicited dose-dependent decreases in urine outflow volume in anesthetized, hydrated rats. The capsaicin (500 nmol)-induced antidiuresis was inhibited by pretreatment with CP96345 (30 nmol, a neurokinin-1-receptor antagonist), but not by that with phenoxybenzamine (20 nmol, an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist), timolol (100 nmol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist) or atropine (300 nmol, a muscarinic antagonist) into the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON). Intravenous injections of d(CH2)5-D-Tyr(Et)VAVP (50 microg/kg, a vasopressin-receptor antagonist) completely blocked the antidiuresis. In intra-SON microdialysis experiments, acetylcholine concentration in the perfusate of the capsaicin-injected rats was not different from that of the vehicle-injected rats. These findings suggested that capsaicin stimulated substance P release in the SON and caused the antidiuresis as a result of the increased release of vasopressin into the circulation from the neurohypophysis mediated through neurokinin-1 receptors in the SON.", 
    "82": "Effects of long-term treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor on decreased function of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-containing vasodilator nerves (CGRP nerves) in mesenteric resistance artery were investigated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Eight-week-old SHR were treated for 7 weeks with 0.1% captopril, 0.01% temocapril, 0.05% pindolol or 0.005% hydralazine in drinking water. Long-term treatment with each drug significantly lowered mean blood pressure of SHR. In isolated and perfused mesenteric vascular beds with active tone, periarterial nerve stimulation (PNS) (0.5 to 8 Hz) produced frequency-dependent vasodilations, which were abolished by CGRP(8-37) (CGRP-receptor antagonist) and significantly smaller in SHR than in normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats. Treatment of SHR with captopril and temocapril but not with pindolol and hydralazine resulted in significantly greater PNS-induced vasodilation than in non-treated SHR, but ACE-inhibitor treatment did not affect vasodilation induced by exogenous CGRP. In captopril-treated SHR preparations, PNS evoked significantly larger CGRP-like immunoreactive release than in non-treated SHR. In non-treated 15-week-old SHR preparations, direct perfusion of captopril or temocapril (0.1 microM and 1 microM) did not modify frequency-dependent vasodilation in response to PNS. These results suggest that long-term ACE inhibitor treatment prevents or restores CGRP nerve function reduction in SHR.", 
    "83": "Medication inventory is more reliable than self-report in assessing prescription drug use in elderly populations. It is not known how strongly medication inventory reflects actual medication use as measured by serum drug levels. In the Cardiovascular Health Study, medication data were collected annually by study interviewers from medication containers brought to the clinic visit. At the fourth clinic visit, venipuncture was performed under 12-hour fasting conditions. Participants were told to take medications as usual. Based on medication inventory results, we randomly selected 55 users and 55 non-users of four cardiovascular drugs: aspirin, propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide, and digoxin. All 110 blood samples for each of the four drugs were analyzed; cut points were based on detectable levels given laboratory limitations. Kappa statistics (K) tested degree of agreement between medication inventory findings and serum detection. Assays were completed on 400 samples (91%). Agreement for aspirin (n=102) was poor: K=0.16 (95% CI: 0.0-0.32). Agreement for propranolol (n = 98) was fair: K=0.43 (95% CI: 0.27-0.59). Agreement for hydrochlorothiazide (n=100) was good: K=0.62 (95% CI: 0.53-0.91). Agreement for digoxin (n=100) was excellent: K=0.94 (95% CI: 0.74-1.0). For four all drugs, lack of agreement was confined primarily to participants who reported use but did not have detectable levels. Excluding aspirin users, only one non-user (0.7%) had drug detected in serum. The medication inventory is a reasonably sensitive and a fairly reliable method for ascertaining non-aspirin cardiovascular drug use in the elderly even though this method may overestimate use as assessed by serum level.",

The benefit of beta blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) in CAD still remains a matter of debate, and their effect on HRV has not yet been investigated. Therefore, we measured HRV, systolic blood pressure variability (BPV) and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) under propranolol (PROP, without ISA, 160 mg q.d.), pindolol (PIN, with potent ISA, 15 mg q.d.) and placebo (PLA, q.d.) in 30 healthy subjects, aged 21-39 years, during controlled frequency breathing (0.30 Hz) in supine and tilt positions. PROP increased HRV in the high-frequency (0.15-0.40 Hz) band (PROP 7.4 +/- 1.0; PLA 6.9 +/- 1.4; PIN 6.8 +/- 1.0 ln MI2; P = 0.003), decreased BPV in the low-frequency band (at 0.1 Hz, Mayer waves) (PROP 0.6 +/- 0.7; PLA 1.3 +/- 1.1; PIN 1.2 +/- 1.2 ln mmHg2; P = 0.001) and enhanced BRS (PROP 14.6 +/- 9.5; PLA 8.0 +/- 6.8; PIN 8.7 +/- 6.8 ms mmHg-1; P = 0.001) in the supine position. After passive tilt, PROP decreased HRV in the low-frequency band (PROP 6.1 +/- 0.9; PLA 6.5 +/- 1.1; PIN 6.9 +/- 0.7 ln MI2; P < 0.001) and decreased Mayer waves (PROP 1.8 +/- 0.8; PLA 2.4 +/- 1.0; PIN 2.7 +/- 0.8 ln mm Hg2; P < 0.001).

Our results prove that beta-adrenergic blockade with potent ISA does not increase HRV, has no beneficial effect on autonomic balance and even exaggerates sympathetic responses to passive tilt.",

    "100": "1. The mechanism by which sympathetic transmitters increase the firing rate of pacemaker cells was explored in isolated cells from the sinus venosus of the cane toad Bufo marinus. Intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured with indo-1 and membrane potential and currents were recorded with the nystatin perforated-patch technique. 2. Adrenaline or isoprenaline (2 microM) increased the transient rise in [Ca2+]i and increased the firing rate; these effects were blocked by propranolol (2 microM). 3. To determine whether the changes in [Ca2+]i might influence the firing rate we studied agents which affect either the loading or the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Rapid application of caffeine (10 mM) to spontaneously firing cells caused a large Ca2+ release from the SR and the cells were then quiescent for 24 s. In the presence of beta-adrenergic stimulation the caffeine-induced [Ca2+]i was 14 % larger but the period of quiescence after application was reduced to 12 s. 4. Ryanodine, at either low (1 microM) or high (> 10 microM) concentration, stopped firing. However, when the SR store content of Ca2+ was tested with caffeine, at low ryanodine concentration the SR Ca2+ store was empty whereas at the high concentration the SR store was still loaded with Ca2+. beta-Adrenergic stimulation was not able to restore firing at the low concentration of ryanodine but did restore firing at the high ryanodine concentration. 5. An SR Ca2+ pump blocker, 2, 5-di(tert-butyl)-1,4-hydroquinone (TBQ) which depletes the SR store of Ca2+, also rapidly and reversibly stopped spontaneous firing. 6. The relation between the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i transient and firing rate established in the presence of ryanodine was similar when firing was restored by beta-stimulation. 7. In both spontaneously firing and voltage-clamped cells, depleting the SR store with either ryanodine or TBQ suggested that about half of the Ca2+ which contributes to the calcium transient is released from the SR. 8. These results show that the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i transient is an important factor in the firing rate of toad pacemaker cells and consequently agents which modify SR Ca2+ release influence firing rate. The effects of beta-stimulation on firing rate seem to be largely mediated by changes in amplitude of the [Ca2+]i transient.", 
    "101": "There are complex interactions between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system inputs to the sinus node. The concept of \"sympathovagal balance\" reflects the autonomic state resulting from the sympathetic and parasympathetic influences. Despite widespread usage of a variety of heart rate (HR) variability parameters as indexes of sympathovagal balance, no index has been validated as a measure of sympathovagal balance. This study evaluated the utility of HR, HR variability, and a new parameter termed the vagal-sympathetic effect (VSE) as indexes of sympathovagal balance. The ideal parameter had to satisfy the following criteria: 1) the index should vary similarly among subjects in response to different autonomic conditions; 2) the variability in the index among subjects exposed to the same autonomic conditions should be small; and 3) the response of the index to various autonomic conditions should reflect the underlying changes in physiological state and have a meaningful interpretation. Volunteers [8 men, 6 women; mean age 28.5 +/- 4.8 (SD) yr] were evaluated for the effects of sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulation and blockade on HR and HR variability. VSE was defined as the ratio of the R-R interval to the intrinsic R-R interval. VSE and R-R interval consistently changed in the expected directions with parasympathetic and sympathetic stimulation and blockade. A general linearized model was used to evaluate the response of each parameter. VSE and R-R interval had r2 values of 0.847 and 0.852, respectively. Natural logarithm of the low-frequency power had an r2 value of 0.781 with lower r2 values for all the other HR variability parameters. The coefficient of variation was also lowest for each condition tested for the VSE and the R-R interval. VSE and R-R interval best satisfy the criteria for the ideal index of sympathovagal balance. Because it is impractical under most conditions to measure the VSE as the index of sympathovagal balance, the most suitable index is the R-R interval.",

    "113": "Contraction and relaxation of airway smooth muscles is mediated, in part, by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and dysfunction of these receptors has been implicated in asthma. Phosphorylation of GPCRs, by G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK), is an important mechanism involved in the dampening of GPCR signaling. To determine whether this mechanism might play a role in airway smooth muscle physiology, we examined the airway pressure time index and heart rate (HR) responses to intravenous administration of the cholinergic agonist methacholine (MCh) in genetically altered mice lacking one copy of GRK2 (GRK2 +/-), homozygous GRK3 knockout (GRK3 -/-), and wild-type littermates. (GRK2 -/- mice die in utero.) GRK3 -/- mice demonstrated a significant enhancement in the airway response to 100 and 250 microgram/kg doses of MCh compared with wild-type and GRK2 +/- mice. GRK3 -/- mice also displayed an enhanced sensitivity of the airway smooth muscle response to MCh. In addition, GRK3 -/- mice displayed an altered HR recovery from MCh-induced bradycardia. Although direct stimulation of cardiac muscarinic receptors measured as vagal stimulation-induced bradycardia was similar in GRK3 -/- and wild-type mice, the baroreflex increase in HR associated with sodium nitroprusside-induced hypotension was significantly greater in GRK3 -/- than wild-type mice. Therefore, these data demonstrate that in the mouse, GRK3 may be involved in modulating the cholinergic response of airway smooth muscle and in regulating the chronotropic component of the baroreceptor reflex.",

In contrast, diamide reduced the affinity of human platelet serotonin2A-receptors for antagonists, but did not consistently induce nH values above unity for the inhibition of antagonist binding by serotonin. These results suggest that cooperative interactions reported for cardiac muscarinic receptors may also occur for beta1-adrenergic receptors in the rat brain.", 
    "115": "Pindolol has been reported to hasten the antidepressant action of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in open-label and placebo-controlled trials. Pilot studies also suggested that pindolol could augment the antidepressant response in unresponsive patients. We investigated whether the addition of pindolol can induce a rapid response in treatment-resistant patients.", 
    "116": "After a single-blind lead-in placebo phase of 5 days to exclude placebo responders, 80 outpatients with major depression who did not respond to a minimum of 6 weeks of treatment with clomipramine hydrochloride, 150 mg/d; fluoxetine hydrochloride, 40 mg/d; fluvoxamine maleate, 200 mg/d; or paroxetine hydrochloride, 40 mg/d, were randomly assigned to additionally receive placebo (3 times daily) or pindolol (2.5 mg 3 times daily) for 10 days. The median number of ineffective treatments in the current episode was 2 (range, 1-4). Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and Montgomery-Asberg Scale for Depression scores were used as primary measures of efficacy.", 
    "117": "At end point, the Hamilton and Montgomery-Asberg scores and change from baseline in Hamilton score were not significantly different in patients taking placebo or pindolol. The response rate was equal in both groups (12.5%). No differences in the clinical outcome were found when the various pretreatment subgroups were considered.

    "119": "Prevention of variceal bleeding, a major cause of morbidity and mortality, is an important goal in the management of patients with portal hypertension (PHT). Although propranolol has been found useful in preventing the first episode of variceal bleeding (primary prophylaxis) in cirrhotic PHT, it has limitations which include side effects, contraindications, non-compliance and failure in some patients. Endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) has not been used for primary prophylaxis.", 
    "120": "Thirty cirrhotic patients with PHT, grade III to IV oesophageal varices, hepatic venous pressure gradient > or = 12 mmHg and no prior history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding were randomized to receive propranolol (to reduce their pulse rate by 25% from baseline, n = 15) and EVL (weekly to fortnightly until variceal eradication, n = 15). The two groups were comparable. All the patients in EVL group had variceal eradication during 3.8 +/- 2.2 sessions.", 
    "121": "There was no major complication or interval bleeding. During a follow-up period of 17.6 +/- 4.7 months, varices recurred in three, two of which bled (successfully treated by EVL). In contrast, during this period of follow up one patient in the propranolol group had variceal bleeding (P=NS). Side effects of propranolol included symptomatic bradycardia requiring reduction of dose in one of 15 patients.", 
    "122": "Although sample size in this study is small, it seems that EVL may be a good option for primary prophylaxis for variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhotic PHT; further studies on a larger number of patients and longer follow up are required.", 
    "123": "A number of important questions surrounding the treatment of systolic congestive heart failure have been answered by randomised clinical trials completed within the past 2 years. In particular, these studies have established that high-dose angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition is more beneficial than low dose therapy, and that angiotensin II receptor antagonists are an acceptable alternative in patients unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors. Digoxin has been shown to be the only inotropic agent not associated with increased mortality, while amiodarone exerts a modest survival benefit in arrhythmiaprone patients. Beta-blockers appear to be beneficial for selected patients although their precise role remains to be defined by ongoing studies.", 
    "124": "Pre-clinical and clinical studies suggest that chronic sympathetic activation in congestive heart failure (CHF) is a maladaptive response which accelerates the progressive worsening of the disease. Consequently, therapeutic interventions which inhibit sympathetic nerve function are likely to favorably alter the natural course of the disease. Indeed, recent clinical studies have shown that treatment with carvedilol, a beta-blocker, reduces mortality and the risk of death and hospitalization. The therapeutic value of beta-blockers, however, may be limited by their propensity to cause acute hemodynamic deterioration which results from abrupt withdrawal of sympathetic support. Thus, although the introduction of beta-blockers represents an important advance in the treatment of CHF, a better tolerated means of modulating the sympathetic nervous system would be highly desirable. An alternative strategy for directly modulating sympathetic nerve function is to inhibit the biosynthesis of norepinephrine (NE) via inhibition of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH), the enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of dopamine (DA) to NE in sympathetic nerves. This approach may have the following three merits over beta-blockade. First, this class of drugs would be expected to produce gradual modulation, as opposed to abrupt blockade, of sympathetic nerve function and, consequently, would not be associated with acute hemodynamic worsening thereby obviating the need for dose-titration. Second, from a theoretical standpoint, DBH inhibitors, at low doses, would preferentially inhibit NE release in the heart since the storage pool of NE in this organ is selectively depleted in CHF. Lastly, inhibition of DBH would augment the levels of DA which, via agonism of dopamine receptors, could have beneficial effects on renal function. Nepicastat is a novel, selective and potent (IC50 = 9 nM) inhibitor of DBH. Preclinical studies have shown that nepicastal produces gradual modulation of catecholamine levels (reduction in NE and elevation of DA and DA/NE ratio) in cardiovascular tissues and plasma, attenuates sympathetically-mediated cardiovascular responses and also has salutary effects on renal function. In a canine heart failure model, normalization of transmyocardial norepinephrine balance with nepicastat retards the process of ventricular dilation and prevents progressive worsening of cardiac function. Early short-term clinical studies in CHF patients have shown that nepicastat is well tolerated and produces significant and dose-dependent increases in plasma DA/NE concentrations.", 
    "125": "A Comprehensive review of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies on antiarrhythmic agents is presented. From the discussion point of view, the antiarrhythmic agents have been put into two broad classes: specific and nonspecific. While the main members of the former class can be beta-adrenergic blocking agents (beta-blockers), any chemical that can act directly on the myocardial cell membrane, producing a cardiodepressant effect via changes in basic electrophysiological properties of the membrane, such as automaticity, excitability, conductivity, and refractoriness, has been put in the latter class. QSARs exhibit that the biological actions of a variety of drugs belonging to any class depend primarily on the lipophilic haracter of the molecule or substituents. Thus, the hydrophobic interaction is found to play a dominant role in the action of antiarrhythmic agents. In certain cases, the QSARs also exhibit the role of electronic parameters, suggesting that certain receptors may have electronic site also, permitting the drugs to involve in some electronic interactions, too.", 
    "126": "In the present research, controlled-release propranolol hydrochloride tablets were prepared for twice-daily administration, allowing more uniform plasmatic levels of the drug. Pharmaceutical formulations were prepared with hydrophobic Eudragit RSPO. The physical properties of the tablets were determined. Dissolution tests were performed in capsules containing the raw material using the following dissolution media: (A) distilled water, (B) simulated gastric juice without enzymes, and (C) simulated enteric juice without enzymes. A dissolution test was also performed for simulated samples (tablets) using distilled water as the dissolution medium.", 
    "127": "The effects of different concentrations of various polysorbates on the release rate of atenolol from film-coated tablets were evaluated. The release profile of atenolol showed that increasing the concentration of polysorbate resulted in an increase in the release rate of atenolol. The type of polysorbate had less effect on the release rate of atenolol. This study revealed that the release kinetic of atenolol from these film-coated tablets was a function of polysorbate concentration. Correlation coefficients of kinetic models could not solely determine the suitability of the models; the sum of the least square of differences also should be calculated when different kinetic models have similar correlation coefficients.", 
    "128": "Previous studies, by this group and others, have shown that vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) stimulates aldosterone secretion, and that the actions of VIP on aldosterone secretion by the rat adrenal cortex are blocked by beta adrenergic antagonists, suggesting that VIP may act by the local release of catecholamines. The present studies were designed to test this hypothesis further, by measuring catecholamine release by adrenal capsular tissue in response to VIP stimulation. Using intact capsular tissue it was found that VIP caused a dose-dependent increase in aldosterone secretion, with a concomitant increase in both adrenaline and noradrenaline release. The effects of VIP on aldosterone secretion were inhibited by atenolol, a beta1 adrenergic antagonist, but not by ICI-118,551, a beta2 adrenergic antagonist. Binding studies were carried out to investigate VIP receptors. It was found that adrenal zona glomerulosa tissue from control rats contained specific VIP binding sites (Bmax 853+/-101 fmol/mg protein; Kd 2.26+/-0.45 nmol/l). VIP binding was not displaced by ACTH, angiotensin II or by either of the beta adrenergic antagonists. The response to VIP in adrenals obtained from rats fed a low sodium diet was also investigated. Previous studies have found that adrenals from animals on a low sodium diet exhibit increased responsiveness to VIP. Specific VIP binding sites were identified, although the concentration or affinity of binding sites in the low sodium group was not significantly different from the controls. In the low sodium group VIP was found to increase catecholamine release to the same extent as in the control group, however, in contrast to the control group, the adrenal response to VIP was not altered by adrenergic antagonists in the low sodium group. These data provide strong support for the hypothesis that VIP acts by the local release of catecholamines in adrenal zona glomerulosa tissue in normal animals. It does not appear that VIP acts through the same mechanism in animals maintained on a low sodium diet. The mechanism by which VIP stimulates aldosterone in this group remains to be determined.", 
    "129": "Anti-obesity effects of calcium antagonists such as benidipine and nifedipine have been described in rodent obesity models, but the mode of action of the calcium antagonists as anti-obesity agents has not been established.", 
    "130": "To examine whether the anti-obesity effects of calcium antagonists (here benidipine) could be ascribed to a direct stimulation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis.", 
    "131": "Examination of the ability of benidipine to induce thermogenesis (increased rate of oxygen consumption) in isolated brown-fat cells from rats, mice and hamsters--and in intact cold-acclimated rats.", 
    "132": "Benidipine itself, or in combination with any dose of noradrenaline (NA), was totally unable to induce or augment thermogenesis in isolated brown-fat cells of any species tested. However, it markedly induced thermogenesis in intact animals (approx 60% increase over resting metabolic rate). This effect could be fully inhibited by propranolol.", 
    "133": "Benidipine is itself without thermogenic effect. The thermogenic response in-vivo (and thus presumably the anti-obesity effect) is probably secondary to a previously described general side-effect of calcium antagonists: a release of NA from sympathetic nerves, here most likely directly from nerves in the BAT. The anti-obesity effect of benedipine is thus probably not due to its calcium channel blocking effect.", 
    "134": "It is probable that the anti-obesity effects of calcium antagonists reported in several models of genetically obese rodents (MSG-obese and agouti mice, SHHF/Mcc-fa(cp) and JCR:LA-corpulent rats) are mediated via an indirect stimulation of BAT. To what extent calcium antagonists may induce similar effects in a clinical situation, is currently unknown.", 
    "135": "1. The in vitro activity of four aryl propanolamines was compared to two prototypic beta3 receptor agonists, CGP 12177 and CL316243 at the human beta3 receptor, the rat beta3 receptor in the stomach fundus and receptors mediating atrial tachycardia. 2. L-739,574 was the most potent (EC50 = 9 nM) and selective agonist at the human beta3 receptor with high maximal response (74% of the maximal response to isoproterenol). 3. A phenol-biaryl ether analogue possessed modest affinity for the human beta3 receptor (EC50 = 246 nM), but was highly efficacious with a maximal response 82% of the maximal response to isoproterenol. The other derivatives were intermediate in potency with low maximal responses. 4. These agonists at the human beta3 receptor did not activate the rat beta3 receptor in the rat stomach fundus. In fact, the aryl propanolamines (10(-6) M) inhibited CL316243-induced activation of the rat beta3 receptor. Thus, agonist activity at the human beta3 receptor translated into antagonist activity at the rat beta3 receptor. 5. L739,574 and the phenol biaryl ether increased heart rate via beta1 receptors. 6. Although CGP12177 produced atrial tachycardia, neither the indole sulphonamide nor biphenyl biaryl ether did, although both had high affinity for the human beta3 receptor. Thus, the atrial tachycardic receptor was not identical to the human beta3 receptor. 7. These studies (a) characterized four aryl propanolamines with high affinity at the human beta3 receptor, (b) found that they were antagonists at the rat beta3 receptor, an observation with profound implications for in vivo rat data, and (c) established that the rodent atrial non-beta1, beta2 or beta3 tachycardic receptor was also unrelated to the human beta3 receptor.", 
    "136": "Bleeding oesophageal varices are a frequent and sometimes fatal complication of portal hypertension. Prompt resuscitation and arrest of haemorrhage are the immediate short term priorities. Vasoactive therapy to reduce portal pressure is administered on presentation. Early endoscopy is necessary to make a definitive diagnosis and initiate appropriate therapy; usually emergency sclerotherapy or banding. After the acute bleeding episode, follow-up therapy is instituted either to obliterate the varices by sclerotherapy or banding, or to chronically lower portal pressure and hence reduce the risk of bleeding pharmacologically; a combination of both strategies may be also used. Active surveillance of those at risk of developing varices is advocated. Long term beta-blocker therapy has been demonstrated to be effective in both the primary prevention of variceal haemorrhage and the prevention of rebleeding in those who have already bled. Despite a multitude of therapeutic regimes and ongoing clinical trials, mortality from this condition remains disappointingly high.", 
    "137": "Among beta-blockers, including atenolol, metaproterenol, pindolol and propranolol, only pindolol strongly inhibited lipid peroxidation induced by xanthine oxidase-hypoxanthine in the presence of adenosine-5'-phosphate-Fe3+. In the reaction system, superoxide predominantly reduced iron because superoxide dismutase strongly prevented the iron reduction. However, pindolol had no effect on the superoxide-dependent iron reduction. Adding superoxide dismutase immediately stopped the lipid peroxidation, indicating that superoxide is closely connected with forming the initiator of xanthine oxidase-hypoxanthine-induced lipid peroxidation. On the other hand, pindolol also inhibited lipid peroxidation, whereas it did not react with superoxide, indicating that it inhibited xanthine oxidase-hypoxanthine-induced lipid peroxidation by an independent mechanism of superoxide. Pindolol sharply scavenged 2,2'-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) radical cations, but the ability of pindolol to scavenge peroxyl radicals of 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane)-dihydrochloride and 2,2'-diphenyl-p-picrylhydrazyl radicals was low. In addition, pindolol did not scavenge hydroxyl radicals at physiologically significant concentrations. These results suggest that the ability of pindolol to inhibit lipid peroxidation was due to scavenging carbon-centered radicals rather than peroxyl radicals.", 
    "138": "The effects on plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and renin activity of the two long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, lisinopril and enalapril, alone and in combination with propranolol were studied. In an open, randomised, cross-over design 12 healthy volunteers received orally enalapril 20 mg alone, enalapril 20 mg in combination with propranolol 80 mg, lisinopril 20 mg alone, and lisinopril 20 mg in combination with propranolol 80 mg. Plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and plasma renin activity were measured for 24 h after each treatment period. Lisinopril and enalapril reduced plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity substantially and equally at six hr (-70%, P<0.05) and 12 hr (-65%, P<0.05), irrespective of combination with propranolol. At 24 hr plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme activity remained significantly suppressed only after lisinopril (-60%, P<0.05). Plasma renin activity increased almost ten times after ingestion of both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, but the effect lasted significantly longer after lisinopril than after enalapril. Beta-Adrenergic blockade blunted the effect on the increase in plasma renin activity induced by both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Our results show that the effect of lisinopril on plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and plasma renin activity lasted longer than that of enalapril. beta-Adrenergic blockade suppressed the effect on elevated plasma renin activity, but did not influence the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme activity.", 
    "139": "Carvedilol is a non-selective beta-blocker, and the only one, in recent clinical trials, to have shown a clear reduction in mortality. It is suggested that, compared with other beta-blockers, carvedilol has additional advantageous effects in heart failure, and should be considered as part of the routine treatment of heart failure.", 
    "140": "The antihypertensive treatment with a single agent is not useful for the arterial pressure control in a significant number of patients. In such cases, combined treatment or drug substitution are recommended (sequential or substitutive monotherapy). In the last years, the fixed dose combinations in one single pharmaceutical preparation have proliferated. These associations must fulfill a number of conditions in order to be considered rational, as for instance the compatibility of its pharmacokinetic features, properly dosing, the absence of new secondary effects and the high efficiency showed in most of patients. The advantages of these combinations are the comfort and easiness of the therapeutic schema, antihypertensive action strengthening, less secondary effects when dose is reduced, and perhaps a synergism in the protection of target organs. The most popular combinations are: potassium sparing diuretic plus thiazide, diuretic plus beta block, diuretic plus ACEI, or calcium antagonist plus ACEI.", 
    "141": "Nebivolol was compared in a dose of 5 mg once daily with enalapril 10 mg once daily over 7 months in a double-blind randomised trial in essential hypertension. The two drugs had very similar sustained effects in lowering both systolic and diastolic pressures; neither had an orthostatic component. Both drugs were well-tolerated. No haematological, biochemical, or urinary abnormalities were seen.", 
    "142": "Mechanisms of relaxation induced by nerve stimulation were examined in isolated porcine iris sphincter muscle in reference to norepinephrine, nitric oxide (NO) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and the functional interaction of inhibitory and excitatory nerves. Changes in isometric tension were recorded in strips of the sphincter pupillae, which were stimulated by transmurally applied electrical pulses. The presence of neurons containing acetylcholinesterase and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) was determined histochemically. Transmural electrical stimulation (0.5-20 Hz) produced a frequency-related contraction, which was reversed to a relaxation by atropine in prostaglandin F2alpha-contracted strips. The relaxant response was abolished by timolol and suppressed by metoprolol, a beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist, but was not influenced by butoxamine, a beta2-receptor antagonist. Norepinephrine-induced relaxations were also attenuated only by timolol and metoprolol. Treatment with NG-nitro-L-arginine, a NO synthase inhibitor, and [D-p-Cl-Phe6,Leu17]VIP, a VIP receptor antagonist, did not inhibit the neurogenic relaxation. Contractions induced by nerve stimulation were potentiated by timolol and physostigmine but not by the NO synthase inhibitor. In the sphincter muscle, cholinesterase- and TH-positive nerve fibers and bundles were histologically detected. It is concluded that porcine iris sphincter is innervated by cholinergic excitatory and adrenergic inhibitory nerves. The neurogenic relaxation is associated solely with activation of beta1 adrenoceptors by norepinephrine but is not mediated by NO or VIP.", 
    "143": "Compelling evidence from clinical trials confirms the benefits of secondary prevention for patients with known coronary disease. Preventive therapies initiated after myocardial infarction can extend overall survival, reduce subsequent myocardial infarction, decrease the need for revascularization, and improve quality of life. All patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease should be considered for lipid lowering therapy, antiplatelet agents, beta-blockers, and control of hypertension. Long-term therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should be continued in patients with systolic dysfunction. Hormone replacement therapy has not been shown to benefit postmenopausal women when initiated after myocardial infarction. Smoking cessation, weight control, exercise, and appropriate diet represent important behavioral modifications."
