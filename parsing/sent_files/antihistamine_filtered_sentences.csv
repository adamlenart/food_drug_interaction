117,"16193648 | mollusks | Intracellular dialysis and fixed membrane potential techniques were used to study the extracellular influence of antiarrhythmic drugs--brazidole (a new derivative of 2-mercaptobenzimidazole), amiodarone, sotalol, and hydroxyzine (a tranquilizer) in concentrations 1, 10, 100 and 1000 microM--on the slow potassium ionic transmembrane current in isolated neurons of Lymnnaea stagnalis mollusks."
118,27756601 | osthol | FXF is a third-generation antihistamine drug and osthole is assumed a natural antihistamine alternative.
119,27756601 | osthol | All results confirm our hypothesis that osthole is a natural histamine antagonist and therefore can be beneficially used in antihistamine treatment of conditions such as allergies.
120,26048308 | osthol | FXF is a third-generation antihistamine drug and osthole is assumed a natural antihistamine alternative.
121,"26048308 | osthol | Our study results confirm that FXF, osthole and histamine exert no cytotoxic effect on PBMCs and that IL-6, IL-10 and TNF- cytokine secretion following osthole cell stimulation was similar to that by FXF stimulation.This confirms our hypothesis that osthole is a natural histamine antagonist, and can therefore be beneficially applied in antihistamine treatment."
122,"14087615 | soy bean | Purified preparations of the esterase derived from the first component of complement (C'1 esterase) increased vascular permeability in guinea pig skin, an effect inhibited by triprolidine, an antihistaminic agent, but not by soy bean trypsin inhibitor."
123,1364164 | n-butanol | A flavonoid fraction (fraction B) obtained by partitioning the juice between n-butanol and water contained the substance responsible for the antihistamine activity.
