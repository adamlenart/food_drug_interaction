[u'casein', u'whey']in this study, we examined the separated caseins and whey proteins of goat milk for the presence of ACEI inhibitory peptides.
[u'casein', u'whey']digestion of isolated whey proteins and caseins of goat milk by gastric pepsin generated soluble hydrolysates exhibiting significant inhibition of ACEI compared to weak inhibition by undigested proteins.

[u'casein', u'whey']the peptides from whey and caseins exert significant ACEI inhibitory activities comparable to that of captopril, an antihypertensive drug, exhibiting ic50 values of 4.45unkunkm and 4.27unkunkm, respectively.
[u'casein', u'whey']the results introduce, for the first time, new potent ACEI-inhibitory peptides that can be released by gastric pepsin of goat milk whey and caseins and thus may pave the way for their candidacy as anti-hypertensive bioactive peptides and prevention of associated disorders.
