[u'casein', u'whey']In this study, we examined the separated caseins and whey proteins of goat milk for the presence of ACE inhibitory peptides.
[u'casein', u'whey']Digestion of isolated whey proteins and caseins of goat milk by gastric pepsin generated soluble hydrolysates exhibiting significant inhibition of ACE compared to weak inhibition by undigested proteins.
[u'casein', u'whey']The late-eluting fraction (F4) of either whey or caseins exhibited greater ACE inhibition.
[u'casein', u'whey']The peptides from whey and caseins exert significant ACE inhibitory activities comparable to that of captopril, an antihypertensive drug, exhibiting IC50 values of 4.45unkunkM and 4.27unkunkM, respectively.
[u'casein', u'whey']The results introduce, for the first time, new potent ACE-inhibitory peptides that can be released by gastric pepsin of goat milk whey and caseins and thus may pave the way for their candidacy as anti-hypertensive bioactive peptides and prevention of associated disorders.
[u'tea']We investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition by (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCg), a major tea catechin.
[u'whey']Compared to hydrolysates from whey protein, where the inhibitory effect can almost exclusively be attributed to Ile-Trp, the ACE inhibition by plant protein hydrolysates is caused by a variety of peptides, in particular tyrosine-containing peptides.
[u'salt']These findings suggest a therapeutic potential for mas and/or AT2 receptor activation and ACE inhibition in restoring endothelial function impaired by elevated dietary salt intake or other pathological conditions.
[u'pasta']Control pasta had the lowest ACEI activity or TEAC (22.01unkunkunk0.76unk% or 14.14unkunkunk1.28unkunkmol Trolox/g, respectively).
[u'pasta']Higher activity remained in pasta with PLH than VUH after extrusion, and higher the level of addition, higher the ACEI was.
[u'pasta']Pasta had practically the same ACEI activity after cooking, thus active compounds were not lost by temperature or lixiviation.

[u'whey']All whey fractions had antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activities.
[u'cheese', u'cheese', u'whey', u'whey']The 10-5 kDa whey fraction of Ranchero cheese had the highest Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (0.62 unk 0.00 mM), and the 3-1 kDa Panela and Fresco cheese whey fractions showed the highest ACE-inhibitory activity (0.57 unk 0.02 and 0.59 unk 0.04 unkg/mL 50%-inhibitory concentration values, respectively).
[u'cheese']The occurrence of 8 bovine casein-derived peptides (VPP, IPP, RYLGY, RYLG, AYFYPEL, AYFYPE, LHLPLP, and HLPLP) reported as angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors (ACE-I) was investigated in the 3-kDa ultrafiltered water-soluble extract (WSE) of Parmigiano Reggiano (PR) cheese samples by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry via an electrospray ionization source.
[u'cheese']For the first time, these results demonstrated that the ACE-I peptides HLPLP and LHLPLP present in the in vitro digestates of PR cheese are partially absorbed through an in vitro model of human intestinal epithelium.
[u'lentils']The effect of elicitation on the protein profile and antioxidant and angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activities of sprouted lentils was also evaluated.

[u'common bean', u'bean']The results support the hypothesis that peptides present in the non-digestible fraction of common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) may exert their physiological benefits independent of their antioxidant capacity, by ACE inhibition through interaction with its catalytic cavity.
[u'soy milk', u'yogurt']Here, we evaluated the fermentation characteristics (pH, titratable acidity, free amino nitrogen, and viable bacterial counts), ACE-inhibitory activity, and contents of Val-Pro-Pro (VPP) and Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP) peptides of stored yogurt (4unkC for 28 d) fermented by L. helveticus isolate H9 (initially inoculated at 4 concentrations), from cow, mare, and soy milks.

[u'gelatin']Liposomes containing ACE-inhibitory peptides were incorporated in fish gelatin without detriment to the rheological properties and thermal stability of the resulting cold-induced gel.
[u'gelatin']The ACE-inhibitory activity of the peptide fraction, which was not affected by the encapsulation process, conferred the bioactive potential to the nanoliposome-containing gelatin gel.
[u'shrimp']Antioxidant and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides were extracted and isolated from two different types of Thai traditional fermented shrimp pastes, Kapi Ta Dam (Kp-B6) and Kapi Ta Deang (Kp-R6).

[u'salt']However, the Work Group feels that some additional advice could help clinicians in daily practice: (i) individualization of treatment should be taken into account, especially (cardiovascular) co-morbidities, age, gender and race; (ii) side-effects, such as postural dizziness should be monitored closely, particularly in elderly, diabetics and patients with arterial stiffness; (iii) the importance of salt restriction should not be neglected; (iv) although angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARBs) remain a cornerstone in the management of hypertension, and especially cardiovascular protection, in some particular situations such as in advanced CKD and in patients without proteinuria, their role is less well defined; (v) as most CKD patients need more than one antihypertensive drug to achieve blood pressure control, the specific (renal) (dis)advantages of other classes than ACE-I or ARB should be taken into account.

[u'ginger', u'ginger']However, white ginger inhibited ACE better in a high cholesterol diet fed to rats than red ginger.
[u'salt']ACE inhibition was measured using two synthetic substrates, (N-[3-(2-furyl) acryloyl]-Phe-Gly-Gly (FAPGG) and N-hippuryl-His-Leu hydrate salt (HHL)), and a natural one, angiotensin-I.

[u'casein', u'whey']The putative effects of milk and dairy products are possibly mediated through their mineral content of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and vitamin D. These dairy substances exercise their blood pressure-lowering effect either directly on the arterial wall by these minerals or indirectly through blockade of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by the amino acids contained in the casein and whey of milk.

[u'ginger', u'ginger']However, red ginger extract (EC50=27.5 unkg/mL) had a significantly (P<.05) higher inhibitory effect on ACE than white ginger extract (EC50=87.0 unkg/mL).
[u'ginger']This suggests that the possible mechanism through which ginger exerts its antihypertensive properties may be through inhibition of ACE activity and prevention of lipid peroxidation in the heart.
[u'ginger', u'ginger']Furthermore, red ginger showed stronger inhibition of ACE than white ginger.

[u'whey']This was investigated for the high ACE inhibitory activity present in peas and whey in vitro gastrointestinal digests.
[u'whey', u'whey']This augmented effect of dairy products versus supplemental calcium has been localized, in part, to the whey fraction of dairy and is likely due to additional bioactive compounds, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in dairy, as well as the rich concentration of branched chain amino acids, which act synergistically with calcium to attenuate adiposity; however, these compounds do not fully account for the observed effects, as whey has significantly greater bioactivity than found in these compounds.

[u'casein']Casein kinase 2 (CK2) but not protein kinase C phosphorylated MYH9 in vitro, CK2 coprecipitated with MYH9 from endothelial cells and the phosphorylation of MYH9 in intact cells paralleled the phosphorylation of ACE on Ser1270 by CK2.
[u'sauce', u'blue mussel']The angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity of fermented blue mussel sauce (FBMS) was investigated.
[u'salt']Strategies to limit protein excretion include the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and appropriate salt intake limitation.
[u'rice']In this study, the effect of process conditions on the ACE inhibitory activity of rice dregs hydrolyzed with a trypsin was investigated systematically using response surface methodology.
[u'rice']It was shown that the ACE inhibitory activity of rice dregs hydrolysates could be controlled by regulation of five process conditions.
[u'salt']With treatment associating salt restriction, diuretics and angiotensin-converting-enzyme- inhibitors, the evolution was good: the thrombi disappeared at the first month for the left ventricular thrombi and after 45 days for the rignt ventricular thrombi.
[u'mung bean', u'rice', u'bean']Furthermore, Alcalase hydrolysates of mung bean and rice protein isolates were assessed for ACE inhibitory activity by this method.
[u'pulses']The following immunosuppressive drugs have been used with varying success: cyclosporine, intravenous methyl prednisone pulses alone or combined with or followed by alkylating agents, plasma-exchange, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.
[u'salt']Two clinical groups have demonstrated that salt restriction has a larger and more consistently beneficial impact on the blood pressure of hypertensives when they concurrently are treated with ACE inhibitors - evidently because the physiological impact of the associated rise in renin is blunted.
[u'cheese', u'cheese']Two experimental batches of Manchego cheese elaborated with selected bacterial strains with the aim of improve the organoleptic characteristics demonstrated also a good performance in the formation of peptides with ACE-inhibitory activity during cheese ripening.
[u'wax gourd']The aims of this study were to investigate the abilities of antioxidation and inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity of wax gourd pulp, core, seed, and peel prepared by different extraction methods.
[u'whey']A sample of WE80BG derived from whey proteins showed the strongest anti-hypertensive activity (-21.2 +/- 16.9 mm Hg) with a medium level of ACE inhibitory activity (53.6%), and it was subjected to hydrophobic and gel filtration chromatography.
[u'whey']By means of an ACE inhibitory peptide database, containing about 500 reported sequences and their IC(50) values, the different proteins in pea and whey were quantitatively evaluated as precursors for ACE inhibitory peptides.
[u'whey']The major whey protein beta-lactoglobulin obtained the highest in silico scores, which corresponded with the fact that degradation of this protein in vitro only occurred from the simulated small intestine phase on and resulted in a 10-fold increase in the ACE inhibitory activity.
[u'whey', u'whey']Whey protein obtained total in silico scores of about 124 ml/mg, compared to 46 ml/mg for pea protein, indicating that whey protein would be a richer source of ACE inhibitory peptides than pea protein.
[u'whey']Although beta-lactoglobulin is only partially digested, a higher ACE inhibitory activity was indeed found in the whey (IC(50) = 0.048 mg/ml) compared to the pea digest (IC(50) = 0.076 mg/ml).
[u'sugar']Blood sugar and blood pressure control can reduce microvascular (retinopathy and nephropathy) complications; eye examinations with timely follow-up and photocoagulation can prevent vision loss; foot care can decrease serious foot disease and amputations; control of blood pressure and lipids as well as aspirin use can prevent or diminish cardiovascular disease events; angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can reduce nephropathy and cardiovascular disease; and influenza and pneumococcal vaccines can reduce hospitalizations, respiratory conditions, and death.
[u'spinach']Pepsin and pepsin-pancreatin digests of spinach leaf protein have potent angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibitory properties with IC(50) values of 56 and 120 microg/mL, respectively.
[u'sunflower']Sunflower protein isolates and the proteases pepsin and pancreatin were used for the production of protein hydrolysates that inhibit angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE).
[u'sunflower']These results show that sunflower seed proteins are a potential source of ACE inhibitory peptides when hydrolyzed with pepsin and pancreatin.
[u'salt']We compared the effects of 4 weeks treatment of the vasopeptidase inhibitor omapatrilat and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril on the degree of fibrosis and the concentration of VIP in the heart in salt sensitive hypertension induced by treatment with L-nitro-omega-methylarginine (L-NAME).
[u'spread']Both ACEI and BB are highly underutilised therapy in CCF and there is an urgent necessity to spread message among the medical fraternity for their enhanced use.
[u'wheat']Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptide was isolated from wheat gliadin hydrolysate prepared with acid protease.
[u'whey']An analytical method based on on-line liquid chromatography-biochemical detection (LC-BCD) coupled to electrospray mass spectrometry was developed for the detection and identification of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in complex mixtures, such as hydrolyzed whey proteins.
[u'spinach']Four new inhibitory peptides for angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), that is, MRWRD, MRW, LRIPVA, and IAYKPAG, were isolated from the pepsin-pancreatin digest of spinach Rubisco with the use of HPLC.
[u'whey']In this study, the conditions of in vitro gastrointestinal digestion leading to the formation and degradation of ACE inhibitory peptides were investigated for pea and whey protein.
[u'whey']In batch experiments, the digestion simulating the physiological conditions sufficed to achieve the highest ACE inhibitory activity, with IC(50) values of 0.076 mg/mL for pea and 0.048 mg/mL for whey protein.
[u'whey']These results show that ACE inhibitory activity of pea and whey hydrolysates can be controlled by the conditions of in vitro gastrointestinal digestion.
[u'tea']Green tea extract (EFLA85942) is able to induce specifically the neutral endopeptidase (NEP) activity and to inhibit the proliferation of SK-N-SH cells; the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity is not influenced under the same conditions.
[u'tea', u'tea']The treatment of the cells with arabinosylcytosine and green tea extract results in a strong enhancement of cellular NEP activity whereas cellular ACE activity was not changed significantly, indicating a green tea extract-specific regulation of NEP expression.
[u'pectin', u'pectin']Solutions of 100 mL of 1% commercial pectin each with a different degree of esterification (DE), DE94, DE65, and DE25, were reacted with 100 mL of 2 M alkaline hydroxylamine (pH 12.0) at room temperature for 4 or 18 h. These pectin hydroxamic acids (PHAs; DE94T4, DE94T18, DE65T4, and DE25T4) were used to test the inhibitory activities against semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).
[u'buffalo']Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine alpha(S1)-casein (alpha(S1)-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and beta-CN f58-76; ovine alpha(S1)-CN f1-6 and alpha(S2)-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine beta-CN f58-65 and alpha(S2)-CN f182-187; buffalo beta-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human beta-CN.
[u'whey']Of the samples assayed, it was infant formulae whey that produces the greatest ACE inhibition.
[u'cheese']These results strongly suggest that digestive enzymes diminished the ACE inhibition by the peptides present in Emmental cheese WSE, while the digestion of peptides of high molecular weight would generate new ACE inhibitory peptides.
[u'whey']Pea and whey protein were fermented by Lactobacillus helveticus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae in monoculture and in combination at 28 and 37 degrees C in order to release angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides.
[u'whey']After fermentation, the ACE inhibitory activity (%) increased by 18 to 30% for all treatments, except for the fermentations of whey protein with Saccharomyces cerevisiae at 28 degrees C, where no significant change was observed.
[u'whey']The whey digests tended to have lower (50%) inhibitory concentrations (IC50; 0.14 to 0.07 mg/ml), hence, higher ACE inhibitory activity, than the pea digests (0.23 to 0.11 mg/ml).
[u'whey']The nonfermented whey protein digest showed the highest ACE inhibitory activity of all.
[u'salt']Commercial ACE could be adsorbed only by EAH-coupled GSH gels and eluted off the gels by increasing salt concentrations.
[u'eggs']Both ACE inhibitors reduced the size of the batch of eggs laid by females in a dose-dependent manner, with no observable effects on the behaviour of the adult insect.
[u'wakame']Wakame (Undaria pinnatifida) was hydrolyzed using 17 kinds of proteases and the inhibitory activity of the hydrolysates for ACE was measured.
[u'wakame']The angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antihypertensive activities of wakame hydrolysates have been investigated in several studies.
[u'wakame']The hydrolysates derived from wakame by protease S 'Amano' have a powerful ACE-inhibitory activity (IC(50) = 86 microg protein/ml) and were effective in spite of their slight bitterness as 'physiologically functional food' with antihypertensive activity.
[u'gelatin', u'alaska pollock']Angiotensin I that converts the enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptide, Gly-Pro-Leu, previously purified and identified from the Alaskan pollack skin gelatin hydrolysate, were synthesized.
[u'salt']Several therapeutic measures (that is, adequate blood pressure control, early introduction of ACEI/ARA, dietary protein restriction, low salt diets, weight loss in overweight patients, addition of a diuretic, increasing ACEI/ARA dose titrated against proteinuria levels, combined therapy ACEI plus ARA, addition of drugs with antiproteinuric effect such as non-dihydropiridine calcium channel blockers or NSAIDs) may increase the proteinuria reduction induced by ACEI and ARA.
[u'wakame']Seven kinds of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides were isolated from the hydrolysates of wakame (Undaria pinnatifida) by Protease S "Amano" (from Bacillus stearothermophilus) by using three-step high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a reverse-phase column.
[u'casein']The commercial bovine serum albumin and casein (bovine milk) showed less ACE inhibitory activity.
[u'salt']Furthermore, CsA blunted the increase of renocortical COX-2 expression in response to low salt intake or a combination of low-salt diet with the ACE inhibitor ramipril (10 mg/kg per day), which strongly stimulates renocortical COX-2 expression.
[u'salt']Moreover, our data suggest that the stimulation of the renin system by low salt and by ACE inhibitors is not essentially mediated by COX-2 activity.
[u'salt']Blood pressure was manipulated with aggressive antihypertensive treatment combining low dietary salt and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril.
[u'tartary buckwheat']The latent production of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors from tartary buckwheat (BW) was investigated, and the peptides responsible for ACE inhibition characterized.
[u'salt']However, beta-adrenoreceptor activity or renal nerve activity appears to be required for the full stimulation of nNOS expression by low salt intake or combined with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.
[u'whey']Furthermore, pea and whey protein hydrolysates obtained by digestion with trypsin showed ACE inhibitory activity in the ACE inhibition assay.
[u'salt']The hypotensive effect of calcium channel blockers is less dependent on salt intake than other drugs, such as ACE inhibitors or diuretics.
[u'shrimp']Sardine autolysate and cod head hydrolysate powder (50 microg) were able to inhibit near 30% of ACE activity, whereas 50 microg of shrimp hydrolysate allows the inhibition of 57% of ACE activity.
[u'salt']In healthy subjects on a high salt diet, the hyperglycemic state produced significant increases in renal plasma flow (RPF) in response to administration of the ACE inhibitor captopril.
[u'casein', u'whey']Numerous casein and whey protein-derived angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides/hydrolysates have been identified.
[u'mustard']Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors had no significant effect on cardiopulmonary exercise function in 14 patients who had undergone a Mustard operation for transposition of the great arteries.
[u'salt']These results indicate that high salt intake increases blood pressure, ACE expression and activity in the hypothalamus and pons of Dahl S rats without a parallel increase in angiotensin II levels.
[u'salt']Effects of high salt intake on ACE mRNA and activity appear to be secondary to activation of brain 'ouabain'.
[u'salt']Dahl S rats showed small but significant increases in ACE mRNA in the hypothalamus on regular salt diet.
[u'salt']In Dahl S rats on high salt diet for 2 or 5 weeks ACE mRNA levels significantly increased in both hypothalamus and pons, compared with Dahl R rats on either diet or Dahl S rats on regular diet.
[u'salt', u'salt']After 5 weeks of high salt diet, ACE mRNA levels in the hypothalamus in Dahl S rats were almost three-fold higher and in the pons two-fold higher than in Dahl R rats on either diet or Dahl S on regular salt diet.
[u'salt', u'salt']High salt diet also increased ACE activity of the hypothalamus and pons in Dahl S but not Dahl R. Consistent with this increased ACE activity, central responses to angiotensin I were clearly enhanced and to bradykinin markedly diminished in Dahl S on high salt intake.
[u'salt']Fab fragments prevented the increases in blood pressure, ACE mRNA and activity in the hypothalamus and pons by high salt intake in Dahl S rats.
[u'salt']In protocol I, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) mRNA and activity and angiotensin I and II levels were assessed in the hypothalamus and pons of Dahl salt-sensitive (Dahl S) and salt-resistant (Dahl R) rats on regular (120 micromol Na+ per g) or high (1370 micromol Na+ per g) salt diet from 4-6 weeks or 4-9 weeks of age.
[u'salt']In protocol II, ACE mRNA and activity were assessed in the hypothalamus and pons in Dahl S on regular or high salt treated with intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.)
[u'salt']Fab fragments blocking brain 'ouabain' or gamma-globulins, and in Dahl R on high or regular salt ACE mRNA was assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay and angiotensin I and II by radioimmunoassay after high-performance liquid chromatography.
[u'salt']Therapy of acute exacerbations of congestive heart failure associated with obesity cardiomyopathy consists of dietary salt restriction, inspired oxygen, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or, if left ventricular systolic dysfunction is present, hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate.
[u'salt']For this purpose, studied were the effects of blocking macula densa salt transport by the loop diuretic bumetanide (100 microM) on renal perfusate flow and on renin secretion in isolated perfused rats, in which renocortical COX-2 expression was prestimulated in vivo by treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril, with low-salt diet, or with a combination of both.
[u'salt']This large multicenter study, tested the antihypertensive effects of isradipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker and enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, in salt-sensitive hypertensive patients under low and high salt intake diets.
[u'salt']To elucidate the relationship between the renin-angiotensin system and ET-1 in hypertensive heart failure, we evaluated the effects of long-term treatment with imidapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on preproET-1, endothelin A receptor (ETAR), and ACE mRNA expression in the left ventricle and evaluated these in relation to myocardial remodeling in the failing heart of Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) hypertensive rats fed a high salt diet.
[u'salt']The rationale for delaying ACE inhibitor therapy is due in part to a perceived unique pathobiology in hypertensive African Americans: an excess prevalence of salt sensitivity, hypervolemia, and low plasma renin activity (PRA).
[u'wheat']We report here the antihypertensive effect of wheat germ (WG) hydrolysate and its dominant peptide, Ile-Val-Tyr (IVY), with potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity.
[u'salt']Higher daily doses, dietary salt restriction, and concomitant diuretic or ACE inhibitor administration amplify the antihypertensive effect of ARBs.
[u'salt']The in vitro and in vivo inhibitory potency of omapatrilat and the specific ACE inhibitor fosinopril toward the 2 active sites of ACE (called N- and C-domains) was investigated with the use of 3 substrates: angiotensin I, which is equally cleaved by the 2 ACE domains; hippuryl-histidyl-leucine, specific synthetic substrate of the C-domain in high- salt conditions; and a newly synthesized specific substrate of the N-domain designed by acetylating the lysine residue of AcSDKP.
[u'salt']During a 3-year period, patients received nonpharmacological treatment consisting of moderate salt restriction and a low-calorie diet they were obese, with or without a regimen of antihypertensive drugs based on beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors.
[u'salt']These data suggest that clinical, genetic, or environmental factors (such as salt intake and medications) that alter ACE activity and Ang II production would be expected to impact on clotting and fibrinolytic mechanisms.
[u'whey']Whey protein digests gave a 50% inhibition (IC50) of ACE activity at concentration ranges within 345-1733 micrograms/ml.
[u'wheat']Reported is the preparation of wheat germ (WG) hydrolyzate with potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity, and the characterization of peptides responsible for ACE inhibition.
[u'salt']In the present study, we tested for endosomal ANG I, ANG II, angiotensin type 1A receptor (AT(1A)), and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity and determined whether these levels are regulated by salt intake.
[u'corn']We investigated the relationship between angiotensin II formation and the development of atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta of monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) fed a high-cholesterol (4% cholesterol and 6% corn oil) diet for 6 months, and studied the effects of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, trandolapril (10 mg kg-1 per day, p.o.
[u'salt', u'salt']We report two cases of hyperkalaemia related to the use of the salt substitute 'Lo Salt' in hypertensive patients on treatment with ACE inhibitors.
[u'salt']Without vigilance the contribution of the salt substitute to hyperkalaemia would have been overlooked and an ACE inhibitor erroneously withdrawn.
[u'whey', u'whey']Studies with gastric and pancreatic proteinase digests of whey proteins indicate that enzyme specificity rather than extent of hydrolysis dictates the ACE inhibitory potency of whey hydrolysates.
[u'salt']We have previously shown that in renal cortex, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression is localized to the macula densa and surrounding cortical thick ascending limb and increases in high-renin states, such as salt restriction and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.
[u'salt']In humans, renin inhibition led to a larger increase in renal plasma flow in healthy human volunteers studied on a low salt diet to activate the renin system than did ACE inhibitors.
[u'whey']Whey protein was digested with one of seven kinds of proteases at 37 degrees C (trypsin, proteinase K, actinase E, thermolysin, or papain) or at 25 degrees C (pepsin or chymotrypsin) for 24 h. The digested samples were assayed for the inhibitory activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme and for changes in the systolic blood pressure caused in spontaneously hypertensive rats after gastric intubation.
[u'salt']However, it is controversial as to whether kinins oppose the hypertensinogenic effect of deoxycorticosterone acetate plus salt (DOCA-salt) or aortic coarctation and whether they mediate both chronic antihypertensive and cardiac antihypertrophic effects of ACEi in hypertension.
[u'salt']In contrast, the renal vasodilatory responses to ACE inhibition in dogs on low salt intake were markedly dependent on the activation of BK B2 receptors.
[u'salt', u'salt', u'salt']Thus, the mean morning PAI-1 antigen concentration was significantly higher during low salt intake than during either high salt intake or low salt intake and concomitant ACE inhibition (22.7+/-4.6 versus 16.
[u'salt']It has been suggested that combined inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) may lower blood pressure more effectively than either treatment alone, independent of the degree of salt and volume status or the activity of the renin-angiotensin system.
[u'salt']Moreover, diazonium salt of sulfanilic acid (DASA), a membrane-impermeable ACE inhibitor, inhibited ACE activity in intact cells and in cell lysates at the same extent, thus implying that intracellular ACE is inactive.
[u'salt']We compared the antihypertensive effect of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril 5 or 20 mg BID) or a calcium channel antagonist (isradipine 5 or 10 mg BID) during alternating periods of high and low salt intake.
[u'salt']1 In spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) we examined over a 4-week period the influence of control low sodium diet, common salt-enriched diet (sodium chloride 6% of the dry weight of the chow) and a novel mineral salt-enriched diet (potassium-, magnesium-, and l-lysine-enriched mineral salt added at a 75% higher level of 10.5% to produce the same sodium chloride concentration of 6%) on the cardiovascular effects produced by a low-dose combination of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril (0.25 mg kg(-1) day(-1) in the food) and a calcium channel blocker felodipine (0.4 mg kg(-1) day(-1) subcutaneously via an osmotic minipump).
[u'salt']Experimentally it can be shown that inhibiting ACE but preventing the fall in systemic blood pressure by salt loading abolishes renoprotection.
[u'salt', u'salt']Our findings indicate that: (1) NIDDM with hypertension is associated with reduced RPF when dietary salt intake is high, (2) reduced Ang II formation is the dominant mechanism of ACEI-induced renal vasodilation in hypertensives with NIDDM; and (3) the sustained renal hemodynamic responses to ACE inhibition despite high-salt balance, and the increased PRA suggest an autonomous renin-angiotensin system suppressed subnormally by a high salt diet in patients with NIDDM despite greater volume expansion.
[u'buffalo']HieACE, a soluble 70 kDa protein related to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has recently been identified, characterized and cloned from the adult buffalo fly (Haematobia irritans exigua).
[u'salt']We evaluated the role of the renin-angiotensin system in S.R-Ren and S rats fed a 0.05% salt diet by examining differences between strains in (1) expression of renin in three tissue types, (2) the blood-pressure response to blockade of both angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin II receptors, and (3) pressure natriuresis.
[u'salt']Measurements were obtained during absence of treatment (control), treatment with dietary salt restriction plus an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (2.5 mg of lisinopril, PO, daily) and treatment with an inhibitor of nitric oxide production (0.1% L-NAME in the drinking water).
[u'salt']Moreover, reduction in salt intake has a permissive action on the antiproteinuric responses of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.
[u'salt']For this purpose, uninephrectomized rats received DOCA and high salt diet, and when hypertension was installed, they were treated for 5 weeks with either a long-acting calcium antagonist, mibefradil (30 mg/kg/day), an ACE inhibitor, enalapril (3 mg/kg/day), or a mixed ETA and ETB endothelin receptor antagonist, bosentan (100 mg/kg/day).
[u'spread']Earlier and more wide spread use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in Nigerian and Black Africans with chronic heart failure is now clearly indicated.
[u'squid']Autolysis of squid liver and mantle muscle homogenates, and blends of both, each yielded inhibitory activity toward the angiotensin I-converting enzyme.
[u'salt']Human plasma renin concentration increased in response to both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with captopril and isoproterenol and decreased after a high salt diet.
[u'salt']Uninephrectomized rats received DOCA, a high salt diet, and when hypertension was installed, they were treated for 6 weeks with either a long-acting calcium antagonist, mibefradil (30 mg/kg day-1), an ACE inhibitor, enalapril (3 mg/kg day-1), or a mixed ETA-ETB endothelin receptor antagonist, bosentan (100 mg/kg day-1).
[u'salt']We examined the renal protective effect of the combined therapy with calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) against hypertensive renal injury in 5/6 nephrectomized spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) with salt loading, comparing with monotherapy of each drug.
[u'salt']This study was designed to ascertain whether salt sensitivity of BP is a determinant of BP and renal vascular responsiveness to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition.
[u'salt']The magnitude of the BP and renal vascular response to ACE inhibition was not influenced by the sensitivity of BP to salt intake.
[u'salt']In a multivariate analysis neither body mass index nor age influenced the BP response to ACE inhibition or the relationships between salt intake and a BP response to ACE inhibition.
[u'salt']We conclude that the factors that influence sensitivity of BP to salt intake do not influence the systemic or renal hemodynamic response to ACE inhibition.
[u'casein']Pulmonary and plasma ACE activity were determined in rats of different ages, following in utero exposure to 18 (control) or 9% (deficient) casein diets.
[u'casein']No maternal diet induced changes in pulmonary ACE were noted, but at 4 and 13 weeks of age, plasma ACE activity was increased by 34 and 134%, respectively in 9% casein exposed rats relative to controls (P < 0.001).
[u'salt']We compared the response of the oral angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor antagonist (ARA) UP 269-6 with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) enalapril 20 mg or placebo, during salt depletion in normal men.
[u'salt']The aim of this study was to determine the participation of endogenous bradykinin (BK) in the antihypertensive effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), perindoprilat, in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) on different salt diets.
[u'salt']These harmful effects of salt were blocked by the thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide but not by the ACEI enalapril.
[u'sake', u'sake']Nine peptides to inhibit angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) were isolated from sake and sake lees.
[u'salt']This assertion depends partly on an experiment that suppressed salt appetite using an intravenous infusion of a dose of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (captopril, 2.5 mg/h) that supposedly blocked both central and peripheral enzyme (17).
[u'sugar']Sugar modifications of ACE were analyzed by testing its sensitivity to specific glycosidases.
[u'salt']In contrast, chronic salt loading or inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme by perindopril significantly increased binding not only to the cortical sites but also to the sites in the inner stripe of the outer medulla.
[u'sugar']Protein restriction, tight control of blood sugar and blood pressure, and specific therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown independently to reduce microalbuminuria and preserve renal function in these patients.
[u'salt']For example, DOCA treatment led to increased ACE activity in the heart and the kidney only if the rats were maintained on a high salt intake.
[u'salt']Increased dietary intake of regular salt (sodium chloride) interferes markedly with the therapeutic effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.
[u'salt']To evaluate whether ACE inhibitors and vasodilators have different effects on salt sensitivity of BP in humans, we compared the effect of the ACE inhibitor cilazapril and the vasodilator dihydralazine on the renal function curve in a randomized prospective single blind cross-over study.
[u'salt']The results document that BP reduction after acute ACE inhibition is a function of salt intake, i.e.
[u'salt']When PMN were coincubated with PMA (10 ng/ml) for 4 h in Earle's salt solution, endothelial ACE activity was decreased by 87%.
[u'sauce', u'soy sauce']The inhibitory activity of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) detected in soy sauce was fractionated into two major fractions of high molecular weight (Hw) and low molecular weight (Lw) by gel filtration chromatography on Bio-gel P-2 after treating with ethanol.
[u'garlic', u'garlic']Furthermore, a moderate angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibiting action of wild garlic was found in vitro as well as in vivo that could contribute to the cardioprotective and blood pressure lowering action of wild garlic.
[u'salt']Blockade of ANG II synthesis in the brain and periphery with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril eliminated the thirst and salt appetite.
[u'salt']Calcium antagonists are more likely to be effective first-line therapy than ACE inhibitors in patients with a high salt intake, in patients with Raynaud's disease, when angina pectoris is present, and in Black patients.
[u'salt']ACE inhibitors are preferred for combination with diuretic agents, and in the presence of congestive heart failure or low salt intake.
[u'salt']These results suggest that lipids may be important in the development of both glomerular disease and hypertension in Dahl S rats and that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition may not affect the course of renal disease in a setting of high salt intake.
[u'sugar']Therapy with ACE inhibitors under long-term treatment (up to 12 months) reduced diastolic blood pressure (-25%) and, both for type I and II diabetics, fasting blood sugar (-14%) and HbA1 (-9%).
[u'sugar']The outcome of this meta-analysis shows that the treatment of diabetic patients with ACE inhibitors not only effectively reduces high blood pressure but also reduces microalbuminuria/proteinuria and, in addition, exhibits an anti-hyperglycemic effect by improving blood sugar levels.
[u'salt']The need-free salt intake of the female rat is not modified by treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril or by the aldosterone receptor antagonist RU-28318.
[u'salt']Single doses of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor quinapril were administered to salt replete normotensive men to investigate pharmacokinetics and dose responses.
[u'garlic', u'garlic']Extracts of wild garlic (Allium ursinum) and garlic (A. sativum) with defined chemical compositions were investigated for their in vitro inhibitory potential on 5-lipoxygenase (LO), cyclooxygenase (CO), thrombocyte aggregation (TA), and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE).
[u'salt']Rational combinations include an ACE inhibitor or a beta-blocker together with moderate salt restriction or a thiazide diuretic or a calcium antagonist.
[u'salt']Effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and calcium channel blockers (CaB) on renal blood flow (RBF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and autoregulation (AR) of RBF were studied on the uninephrectomized spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) under the conditions of high (H) and low (L) salt loading.
[u'salt']The hypotensive effect of ramipril was prevented by a high salt diet, which did not alter the degree of renal angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition.
[u'salt', u'salt', u'salt']To investigate the mechanisms by which small changes in plasma levels of atrial natriuretic hormone (ANH) affect aldosterone, 10 normal young men were infused for 2 h with 0.6 pmol/kg.min human [Ser,Tyr28]ANH under 3 study conditions: 1) high salt diet (H), 2) low salt diet (L), and 3) low salt diet plus pretreatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (LE).
[u'salt']To dissociate the effects on the development of diabetic renal injury of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition per se, and a reduction in systemic blood pressure, we have studied the effects of chronic ramapril treatment in streptozotocin diabetic spontaneously hypertensive rats, with modulation of the hypotensive effect by a high salt diet.

[u'salt', u'salt']It has been reported that calcium antagonists lower blood pressure more effectively in salt replete hypertensive patients with a low plasma renin activity (PRA), whereas angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are more effective in salt depleted patients with a high level of PRA.
[u'salt']In a fourway double-blind placebo controlled study, the effects of cilazapril, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on renal function and the responses to intravenous frusemide were studied in a group of twelve salt depleted male volunteers.
[u'salt']The effects of salt restriction and the ACE inhibitor enalapril were compared in a model of chronic myocardial infarction in the rat.
[u'salt']Total exchangeable sodium was measured by an isotopic dilution technique to quantitate the effects of the low salt diet and ACE inhibitor on body sodium and extracellular fluid.
[u'salt', u'salt', u'salt']The interaction of salt with hypertension-induced left ventricular hypertrophy and its reversal by inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme were studied in salt sensitive and salt resistant Dahl rats.
[u'salt']The effects of cicletanine were compared with those of three other antihypertensive drugs: prazosin, a highly selective alpha 1 antagonist, captopril an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and indapamide a diuretic antihypertensive agent, on young stroke-prone SHR rats with high salt diet; furthermore, vascular reactivity to cicletanine was studied on isolated rat aorta.
[u'salt']The interactions of blood pressure, salt intake and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition were investigated in the Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) and salt-resistant (DR) strains of rats.
[u'salt']Regression of an increased left ventricular mass by ACE inhibition seemed to be impaired by a high salt intake, even when blood pressure was lowered.
[u'salt']The interaction of blood pressure, salt intake and the inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme activity with cardiac hypertrophy were examined in the Dahl rat model.
[u'pulses', u'salt']The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors is characterized by some particularly favorable features: ACE inhibitors attenuate the fall in serum potassium and the rise in plasma uric acid induced by diuretics, they do not cause any salt retention nor orthostatic hypotension, they do not raise pulse rate when they reduce blood pressure, and they certainly do not reduce the perfusion rate of the brain, the heart or the kidneys.
[u'salt']The three angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors cilazapril, perindopril and CGS 14824A were administered for 8 days to, respectively, 6, 5 and 5 normotensive healthy volunteers maintained on an unrestricted salt intake.
[u'persimmon']We have studied the inhibitory effects of four flavonoids isolated from the leaves of the persimmon on angiotensin-converting enzyme activity.
[u'salt']A change in the salt balance can thus cause major differences in the responses of the peripheral circulation to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition.
[u'salt', u'salt', u'salt', u'salt']Tissue and plasma ACE from Sprague Dawley rats was studied over a wide range of sodium intakes (low salt, 0.026 +/- 0.012 mmol/24 h; normal salt, 0.58 +/- 0.09 mmol/24 h; and high salt, 10.4 +/- 1.3 mmol/24 h) and during high salt and DOCA treatment.
[u'salt']The blood pressure, heart rate and humoral responses to single intravenous doses of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril were evaluated in 5 volunteers on a free salt intake.
[u'salt', u'salt']To establish if physiological manipulations of the renin-angiotensin system modulates tissue angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), rats were fed low, normal, or high salt diets, or high salt and DOCA, for 3 weeks, and then plasma and tissue ACE levels were determined by radioinhibitor binding studies.
[u'salt']Binding studies of rat ACE using [125I]MK351A showed that manipulation of salt status did not influence rat tissue ACE.
[u'salt']The blood pressure effect of 8-day angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition was studied in normotensive healthy volunteers maintained on an unrestricted salt intake.
[u'salt']The response to ACEI is affected by blood pressure, degree of activation of the RAS, salt balance and degree of possible renal failure.
[u'salt']In subjects with a normal salt intake, the contribution of the renin-angiotensin system in maintaining blood pressure levels can be evaluated using angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.
[u'rainbow trout']Angiotensin-converting enzyme activity (ACE) was assayed in homogenized rainbow trout tissues and plasma.
[u'salt']They are particularly useful when combined with diuretics or salt restriction as not only do they have additive hypotensive effects but angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors prevent the secondary hyperaldosteronism and hypokalemia associated with diuretic administration.
[u'salt', u'salt']Systolic blood pressure responses to enalapril maleate (MK 421, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI] and hydrochlorothiazide (HTZ) were studied in conscious Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) and salt-resistant (DR) rats maintained on a high salt (8.0% NaCl) and a normal salt (0.4% NaCl) diet.
[u'salt']We also show that this exaggerated salt appetite is reduced by chronic central treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, while that of the normotensive controls is unaffected.
[u'salt']The effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on regional blood flow was studied in a total of 21 normotensive Wistar rats fed on either low or high salt diet.
