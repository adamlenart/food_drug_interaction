[u'cream']However, these treatments are usually suboptimally efficacious or have deterring side effects.Patients at an outpatient community center with a diagnosis of a chronic anal fissure were prescribed either topical 2% (nunk=unk19) or 4% (nunk=unk18) diazepam cream between January 2013 and February 2015.
[u'cream']We retrospectively analyzed their responses to treatment.All 19 patients using 2% diazepam cream experienced a positive response in pain, whereas 47.4% experienced a complete response, with a numerical rating scale (NRS) score of 0 (0-10).

[u'rape']Flunitrazepam is well known as a rape drug.
[u'horse', u'horse']Our results showed temazepam was the major diazepam metabolite produced from microsomal reactions in horse liver, but horses produced drastically less p-hydroxydiazepam as compared with rats.
[u'dripping']The patients received intramuscular injection (IMI) of 2 mg lorazepam once or twice during the first 2 h. If intramuscular lorazepam failed, intravenous dripping (IVD) of 10 mg diazepam in 500 mL normal saline every 8 h for 1 day was prescribed.

[u'grapefruit']To search an appropriate evaluation methodology for the intestinal first-pass metabolism of new drug candidates, grapefruit juice (GFJ)- and vehicle (tap water)-pretreated mice or rats were orally administered midazolam (MDZ) or triazolam (TRZ), and blood levels of the parent compounds and their metabolites were measured by liquid chromatography/MS/MS.
[u'fruits', u'fruits', u'fruit juice', u'fruit juice']In phase 1; in Group I the patients were given midazolam (0.5mg.kg(-1)) in 5 mL fruit juice, and the ones in control group (Group II) were given only fruit juice.

[u'pomegranate']In this small Japanese adult volunteer population receiving single subtherapeutic doses of midazolam, 2 weeks' consumption of pomegranate juice did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetic profile of midazolam compared with that of the control.
[u'raccoon']The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of alprazolam on the stress that Korean raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides koreensis) may experience while caught in a live trap by measuring their serum cortisol response.
[u'sugar']The conformation of the diazepam ring was not the sole key player influencing binding affinities, and the sugar moiety can in some cases increase the binding activity, possibly by participating in the binding event.
[u'apple', u'apple']Neither the genotype nor the apple juice showed significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam except for a marginally significant decrease in Cmax after administration with apple juice.

[u'agar']No detectable dissolution of medazepam tablets or of clorazepate capsules occurred when the drug was covered with agar jelly.
[u'agar']Dissolution of prazepam tablets covered with agar jelly was only about 10% at the end of the test.
[u'honey']This clinical trial was conducted to determine the effect of repeated honey administration on human CYP3A enzyme activity using midazolam as a marker substance.
[u'honey', u'honey']To determine intestinal and hepatic CYP3A activity, oral (4 mg) and intravenous (2 mg) midazolam was administered in a semi-simultaneous way before honey administration, after the last honey administration, and 1 and 6 days thereafter.
[u'grapefruit']With the exception of 1 study (single dose, double-strength grapefruit juice), the 2- and 3-timepoint LSS models did not accurately predict midazolam AUC during conditions of CYP3A inhibition and induction/activation.
[u'grapefruit']Plasma midazolam concentrations from 106 healthy adults from 6 published studies were obtained where oral midazolam was co-administered alone or with ketoconazole, double-strength grapefruit juice, Ginkgo biloba extract, pleconaril, or rifampin.
[u'fig', u'fruits']The objective of the present study was to prepare mucoadhesive in situ nasal gels with mucilage isolated from fig fruits (Ficus carica, family: Moraceae) containing midazolam hydrochloride.
[u'pheasant', u'turkey', u'quail']The models were validated with midazolam plasma and tissue residue data in the turkey, pheasant and quail.
[u'alcoholic beverages', u'beverages']In this work, a multipumping flow system (MPFS) coupled to a photodegradation unit was developed, for the first time, for the determination of diazepam (a benzodiazepine) in spiked alcoholic beverages by fluorimetry.
[u'alcoholic beverages', u'beverages', u'gin']Five commercial alcoholic beverages (Eristoff, Smirnoff, Bacardi, Dry Gin and Brazilian Cachaunka 51) spiked with diazepam were analyzed by the proposed methodology, and the results revealed good agreement with those obtained through a HPLC comparison procedure.
[u'honey', u'honey', u'honey']Group M received 0.5 mg x kg(-1) midazolam in 5 ml of honey, group MK received 0.25 mg x kg(-1) midazolam mixed with 1 mg x kg(-1) ketamine in 5-ml honey and group P received 5-ml honey alone, orally.
[u'rape']The term means substances helping comitting a rape such as GHB (gamma hydroxybutyric acid), ketamine, flunitrazepam and other benzodiazepines derivatives, MDMA ("ecstasy"), marihuana, amphetamine.
[u'pulses']Some specific risk factors for falls such as prolonged use of benzodiazepines and heart rate higher than 80 pulses per minute were more frequent in the hospital setting (24.2% PC vs 15.6% HO, p=0.0354) and (12.9% PC vs 3.2% HO, p=0.0006), respectively.
[u'dock']A major unanswered question, however, relates to how positive allosteric modulators dock in the 1,4-benzodiazepine (BZD) recognition site.
[u'snail']In the present study, the X-ray structure of an acetylcholine binding protein from the snail Lymnea stagnalis and the results from site-directed affinity-labeling studies were used as the basis for modeling of the BZD binding pocket at the alpha(1)/gamma(2) subunit interface.
[u'casein']The use of enzymatic membrane reactors has led to the identification of several bioactive peptides, such as--kappa-caseinomacropeptide, which induces CCK (cholecystokinin) secretion and thus regulates food intake and lipid assimilation,--alpha(S1) CN (91-100), a compound with benzodiazepine activity,-- kappaCN (106-116), which has anti-thrombotic activity by inhibiting blood platelet binding to fibrinogen, and--alpha(S) and beta casein phosphopeptides, which are thought to increase iron and calcium absorption.
[u'squirrel']Multiple doses of nonselective BZs (triazolam, alprazolam, diazepam, and chlordiazepoxide) and alpha1 subunit-preferring agonists (zolpidem and zaleplon) were administered to adult male squirrel monkeys (N = 4-6), and experimenters rated the monkey's ability to balance on a horizontal pole ("ataxic-like effects"), as well as the degree of resistance to hind-limb flexion ("myorelaxant-like effects").
[u'syrup']The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of injection midazolam administered by oral route mixed in paracetamol syrup as a premedication in children undergoing surgery.
[u'syrup', u'syrup']60 children undergoing elective hernia repair under general anaesthesia were randomized into two groups: the study group (group A) was given oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg (mixed in paracetamol syrup) and the control group (group B) was given just the paracetamol syrup before bringing them inside the operating theater.
[u'syrup']It was concluded that injection midazolam mixed in syrup paracetamol administered orally is a convenient and efficient method of premedicating children undergoing general anaesthesia.
[u'wheat', u'potato', u'potato']Naturally occurring benzodiazepines have been identified in regular food such as wheat and potato, but there is still no evidence that potato extracts can affect CNS responses in vivo.
[u'potato', u'potato', u'potato']The low content of diazepam (0.04 +/- 0.01 mg/kg) determined by HPLC and mass spectrometry in the potato extracts could not sustain the anticonvulsant activity of potato juice in vivo; therefore we hypothesized that potato juice might contain GABA (A) receptor GABA-site active compounds.
[u'syrup']Group M received midazolam 0.5 mg/kg in acetaminophen syrup and intranasal placebo.
[u'grapefruit', u'pomegranate']In the laboratory; the pH values of 2.5 ml midazolam (15 mg x 3 ml(-1)) and the mixtures of Pepsi Cola, 10% sodium citrate, fresh pomegranate juice, and fresh grapefruit juice in equal volumes were measured.
[u'grapefruit', u'pomegranate']Pepsi Cola (Group I), 10% sodium citrate (Group II), pomegranate juice (Group III), and grapefruit juice (Group IV) which were added to 0.75 mg x kg(-1) midazolam in equal volumes, and (Group V) 0.75 mg x kg(-1) midazolam given orally to children.
[u'spread']Using in vitro autoradiography, benzodiazepine (BDZ) and mu opioid receptor binding was evaluated 1 week (early phase of epileptogenesis) and 3 months (chronic phase) after SE in 27 brain structures involved in seizure generation and spread (amygdala, hippocampus, basal ganglia and thalamic nuclei).
[u'beverages']A rapid CZE method was developed for the simultaneous determination of nine benzodiazepines in spiked beverages (nitrazepam oxazepam, alprazolam, flunitrazepam, temazepam, diazepam, 7-aminoflunitrazepam, 7-aminonitrazepam and 7-aminoclonazepam).
[u'beverages']The validated method was successfully applied to beverages that had been spiked with benzodiazepines at concentrations simulating prescription tablets.
[u'squirrel']Cannabinoid agonists do not have anxiolytic-like effects in behavioral procedures commonly used to characterize benzodiazepines and other drugs in squirrel monkeys.
[u'beverages']Overall the method provides a rapid and simple analysis for the presence of nitrated benzodiazepines in beverages and other similar preparations.
[u'eggs']When the diazepam was administered to hornet's being the age of 48 hours, it exerted no change, that is, the eggs developed normally and comb building was the same as in the control group.
[u'ginger']Patients received oral diazepam 10mg with either oral placebo (group I) or 0.5g of ginger (group II) as premedication 1 hour prior to surgery.
[u'syrup']Participants were randomized to receive a placebo or midazolam syrup (0.5 mg/kg) before the examination.
[u'ginkgo nuts']The patient was diagnosed as having ginkgo nut intoxication, and diazepam and pyridoxal phosphate were administered intravenously.
[u'salt', u'beer']Gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) sodium salt, ketamine hydrochloride, temazepam, flunitrazepam and diazepam were dissolved (Tween added to benzodiazepine solutions) as separate stock solutions and added to 330 ml samples of cola (Pepsi Max), beer (Stella Artois), 'alcopop' (Bacardi Breezer) and placebo (distilled water).
[u'squirrel']Adult male squirrel monkeys (N=4-6), maintained under free-feeding conditions, were administered with intramuscular injections of the nonselective benzodiazepines diazepam and alprazolam, the alpha1GABAA-preferring compounds zolpidem and zaleplon, or the alpha5GABAA-preferring agonist QH-ii-066 before daily 10-min periods when sucrose pellets were available.
[u'lemon']The anti-stress effect of lemon oil was significantly blocked by pre-treatment with frumazenil, benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, or apomorphine, a nonselective DA receptor agonist.
[u'grapefruit']Effects of acute and extended exposure to grapefruit juice (trials 2 and 3) were similar, and produced augmentation in benzodiazepine agonist effects measured by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test and electroencephalographic beta amplitude.
[u'thistle']Unlike those observed for rifampin and clarithromycin, midazolam pharmacokinetics was unaffected by milk thistle or black cohosh.
[u'fruits', u'fruit juice']Therefore, the inhibitory effects of readily available commercial fruit juices on midazolam 1'-hydroxylase activity, a marker of CYP3A, were evaluated in pooled human liver microsomes.
[u'fruits', u'grapefruit', u'fruit juice']The results suggest that, like grapefruit juice, commercial fruit juices also have the potential to inhibit CYP3A-catalzyed midazolam 1'-hydroxylation.
[u'grapefruit']By use of a CYP3A modulation protocol, subjects received oral or intravenous alfentanil and midazolam after pretreatment with rifampin (INN, rifampicin) (CYP3A induction), troleandomycin (CYP3A inhibition), grapefruit juice (intestinal CYP3A inhibition), or nothing (control).
[u'soft drink']The male assailant added flunitrazepam (1 mg) to the female's soft drink, and had sexual intercourse with her while her consciousness was impaired.
[u'syrup']Fifty-five children (2-6 years of age) were randomized to receive orally either a lollipop containing 50 mg of ketamine (the group K; n = 27) or syrup containing 0.5 mg.kg(-1) of midazolam (the group M; n = 28) before minor surgery.
[u'salt']The results indicate the midazolam significantly increased the total number of licks recorded across all salt concentrations, but that it had no effect on the number of bouts of licking.
[u'salt']In addition, midazolam diminished the intrabout rate of licking across all salt concentrations.
[u'salt']These results confirm that benzodiazepines can exert a specific pattern of effects on the microstructure of licking for salt solutions.
[u'salt']They are discussed in terms of the oropharyngeal stimulation controlling intake and the palatability or "liking" hypothesis for the effects of benzodiazepines on taste stimuli, and indicate that the hypothesis is applicable to salt solution ingestive behaviour.
[u'soft drink']In four increasingly comprehensive multivariate models, increased body mass index (BMI), carbonated soft drink consumption, snoring and daytime sleepiness (Epworth sleepiness scale score), insomnia, hypertension, asthma, and usage of benzodiazepines were strong predictors of heartburn during sleep.
[u'sesame']Mice were given 21 days treatment with diazepam (15 mg/kg, s.c. in sesame oil) followed by withdrawal (single withdrawal) or three blocks of 7 days treatment interspersed with 3-day periods to allow washout of drug (repeated withdrawal).
[u'syrup']Alternatively, oral midazolam syrup is well accepted by some animals and provides a mild sedative and calming effect, which may decrease stress associated with the induction of anesthesia via darting, pole syringes, etc.
[u'syrup', u'syrup', u'strawberry']The children in experimental group received 0.5-mg/kg-body weight midazolam mixed in strawberry syrup via the oral-transmucosal route and those in control group were given the same syrup diluted with normal saline.
[u'angelica']The effects of angelica essential oil in three assays predictive of anxiolytic activity in male mice were studied, with diazepam as a positive anxiolytic control.
[u'beer']Diazepam significantly increased beer consumption, and produced a marginally significant increase in reported desire for alcohol.
[u'biscuit', u'cream']An analytical procedure was developed for the detection and quantitation of diazepam in cream biscuits, which were used to commit crime.
[u'biscuit']The limit of detection for diazepam in the biscuit samples was estimated as 600 ng/mL.
[u'biscuit']The diazepam detected per piece of biscuit was found to be in the range of 0.27-0.45 mg.
[u'biscuit']Pure diazepam was added to biscuit samples at 3 levels (100 and 500 microg/g, and 1 mg/g), and the recoveries were found to be 95%.
[u'arepa', u'biscuit']The relative standard deviations of the diazepam level in the biscuit samples were estimated to be 0.4% for retention time and 1.02% for peak area in intraday analysis, whereas the corresponding values were and 0.61 and 2.34% in interday analysis.
[u'agar']Cell growth of these cell lines in soft agar indicated that high levels of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor-binding were associated with increased colony size, indicative of their ability to establish anchorage independent cell proliferation.
[u'sugar']The release of diazepam and sugar carrier was determined to study the mechanisms governing dissolution behaviour.
[u'sugar']Dissolution of 80% of the lipophilic drug within 20 min was found when diazepam and sugar dissolution profiles coincided.
[u'sugar']The sugar carrier and diazepam dissolved at the same rate, which was constant in time and fast.
[u'sugar']For relatively fast dissolving carriers like sucrose or trehalose with high drug loads, release profiles of diazepam and sugar did not coincide: diazepam dissolved much more slowly than the sugars.
[u'fruits']Thus, the inhibitory effects of tropical fruits on midazolam 1'-hydroxylase activity of CYP3A in human liver microsomes were evaluated.
[u'fruits', u'star fruit', u'fruit juice']The addition of a star fruit juice (5.0%, v/v) resulted in the almost complete inhibition of midazolam 1'-hydroxylase activity (residual activity of 0.1%).
[u'alcoholic beverages', u'beverages']A simple, rapid and reliable reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the separation and determination of psycotropic substances viz., alprazolam, chloral hydrate and diazepam in traditional alcoholic beverages, such as toddy, has been developed.
[u'gelatin']This has been due to a sustained reduction in prescriptions for high toxicity drugs and more recently a major reduction in temazepam deaths that coincided with the withdrawal of gelatin capsule formulations.
[u'cream', u'cream']The combination of ketamine and topical placebo cream was compared with the combination of midazolam and topical lidocaine-prilocaine cream (EMLA) in 13 children with leukaemia undergoing bone marrow punctures.
[u'citrus', u'fruits']The capacities of citrus fruits to inhibit midazolam 1'-hydroxylase activity of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) expressed in human liver microsomes were evaluated.
[u'fruits', u'fruit juice']The addition of a banpeiyu juice (5.0%, v/v) resulted in the inhibition of midazolam 1'-hydroxylase activity to about 20% of control without a fruit juice.
[u'turkey']Intravenous diazepam or midazolam are used by the majority of endoscopists in the United States, though it is not common practice in Turkey where this study was conducted.
[u'grapefruit']Healthy volunteer subjects (N = 25) received a single 6-mg oral dose of the CYP3A substrate midazolam in the control condition without exposure to grapefruit juice.
[u'grapefruit']Two days later, midazolam was administered 2 hours after 300 mL of regular-strength grapefruit juice.
[u'grapefruit']Subjects were then randomly assigned to 3 different groups, receiving a third midazolam challenge at 26, 50, or 74 hours after exposure to grapefruit juice.
[u'grapefruit', u'arepa']The area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) for midazolam increased by a factor of 1.65 (ratio compared with control) when midazolam was given 2 hours after grapefruit juice.
[u'grapefruit']The midazolam elimination half-life did not change significantly from the control value at any time after grapefruit juice exposure.
[u'squirrel']When barbiturates have been tested in animals trained to discriminate the intravenous benzodiazepine (Bz) anesthetic midazolam, squirrel monkeys and pigeons did not reliably generalize to barbiturates but rats did.
[u'garlic']Probe substrates dextromethorphan (CYP2D6) and alprazolam (CYP3A4) were administered orally at baseline and again after treatment with garlic extract (3 x 600 mg twice daily) for 14 days.
[u'garlic']Urinary dextromethorphan/dextrorphan ratios and alprazolam plasma concentrations were determined by HPLC at baseline and after garlic extract treatment.
[u'syrup']This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated midazolam syrup for reducing discomfort from intravenous placement in children 9 months to 6 years.
[u'squirrel']AWD 131-138 [1-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-morpholino-imidazolin-2-one], a new low-affinity partial benzodiazepine receptor agonist with potent anticonvulsant and anxiolytic properties in rodent models, was studied in squirrel monkeys trained to discriminate intramuscular (i.m.)
[u'chewing gum']chewing gum; Group 5--a 4% articain solution and metamizol e/n plus diazepam administered transbuccally; Group 6--the same technique after a preliminary administration of lydocain; Group 7--clonidine, administered transbuccally, was added.
[u'syrup', u'fruits', u'fruit juice']The bitter taste of midazolam is more acceptable to children when the drug is mixed with fruit juice or syrup.
[u'syrup', u'syrup']The commercially available oral syrup was compared with a mixture of the IV midazolam preparation in Syrpalta syrup at an equivalent concentration of 2 mg/mL.
[u'syrup']We conclude that IV midazolam mixed in Syrpalta syrup yields more reliable sedation and correspondingly higher plasma levels than an equivalent dose of the commercially formulated and marketed preparation.
[u'squirrel']Together, these results indicate that 5-HT1A receptor agonists disrupt learning in squirrel monkeys by producing rate-decreasing and error-increasing effects in a manner comparable with the nonserotonergic benzodiazepine triazolam.
[u'apple', u'apple', u'butter']Nine healthy male volunteers took a single oral 20-mg dose of quazepam under the following conditions: (1) after fasting overnight for at least 12 hours, (2) 30 minutes after consuming a low-fat meal (two slices of bread and 200 ml of apple juice), or (3) 30 minutes after consuming high-fat meal (two slices of bread with 30 gm of butter and 200 ml of apple juice).
[u'squirrel']The discriminative stimulus effects of zolpidem in squirrel monkeys trained at doses greater than or equal to 3.0 mg/kg differ from those of conventional benzodiazepines (BZs), but the extent to which these effects reflect the selectivity of zolpidem for GABA(A)/alpha(1) receptors is not known.
[u'squirrel']GABAA/alpha1 receptor mechanisms appear to play a key role in the ataxic effects of benzodiazepine agonists in squirrel monkeys, similar to recent results with transgenic mice.
[u'squirrel']In contrast to the findings of these recent studies, GABAA mechanisms other than or in addition to those mediated at the alpha1 subunit may play a more important role in the sedative/hypnotic effects of benzodiazepines in squirrel monkeys.
[u'squirrel']Squirrel monkeys were tested with the GABAA/alpha1-preferring agonist zolpidem and the nonselective benzodiazepine agonist triazolam alone and in combination with the GABAA/alpha1-preferring antagonist beta-CCt and the nonselective benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil.
[u'pulses']For responses elicited by brief pulses of 20 microM GABA, both the AAS and the BZ site compounds significantly increased the peak current amplitudes and total charge transfer, although 17alpha-MeT was an appreciably weaker agonist than either diazepam or zolpidem at alpha(1)beta(3)gamma(2L) receptors.
[u'grapefruit']Accordingly, the effect of grapefruit juice on the AUC of midazolam and the metabolite alpha-hydroxymidazolam was studied in patients with cirrhosis of the liver.
[u'grapefruit']Grapefruit juice increased the AUC of midazolam by 106% (16, 197%) (mean (95% confidence interval)) and the AUC of the metabolite alpha-hydroxymidazolam decreased to 25% (12, 37%) (P<0.05 for both).
[u'grapefruit']A marked interaction between oral midazolam and grapefruit juice was found and the data are consistent with a reduced first-pass metabolism of midazolam.
[u'syrup']Benzodiazepines were significantly more likely to have contributed to deaths from methadone toxicity among maintenance patients and people taking methadone tablets for pain relief than deaths involving diverted methadone syrup and deaths to which methadone did not contribute (OR 4.8, 95% 1.7 to 14.4).
[u'carob']The amount of the substances able to selectively bind the central benzodiazepine receptor recovered from carob pods and leaves was respectively 12.17 and 18.7 ng diazepam equivalent/g.
[u'carob', u'carob']The presence of substances with central benzodiazepine activity in carob extracts seems of great importance in view of the possibility to use carob extract as potential natural products with anxiolytic-sedative effects.
[u'syrup', u'syrup']Eighty children (ASA grade 1 or 2, aged 3-9 years) who presented for tonsillectomy were randomly allocated to receive either 2.5 ml OTF (15-20 microg.kg(-1)) in a lollipop format and 0.5 ml.kg(-1) placebo syrup, or midazolam syrup (0.5 mg.kg(-1)) and a placebo lollipop (2.5 ml).
[u'ginseng']Symptoms disappeared rapidly with low doses of neuroleptics and benzodiazepines after ginseng suppression.
[u'syrup', u'syrup']Because the commercially available midazolam syrup and the midazolam-fruit juice blends for oral administration have a pH of 2.8 to 3, these results suggest that the absorption from the blends or syrup may be significantly improved by slightly increasing the pH.
[u'grapefruit']Bergamottin, a furanocoumarin isolated from grapefruit juice, was investigated for the ability to increase diazepam bioavailability and for its effect on cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes in the beagle dog liver and intestine.
[u'syrup']Eligible study patients were enrolled into one of three study arms: Arm I (midazolam/metabolite pharmacokinetic evaluation after oral administration of a syrup formulation), Arm II (the absolute bioavailability of midazolam syrup), and Arm III (midazolam and metabolite pharmacokinetics after IV administration).
[u'syrup']Oral midazolam syrup is effective for producing sedation and anxiolysis at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg, with minimal effects on respiration and oxygen saturation even when administered at doses as large as 1.0 mg/kg (maximum, 20 mg) as the sole sedating medication to healthy children in a supervised clinical setting.
[u'syrup']Commercially prepared oral midazolam syrup is effective in producing sedation and anxiolysis in doses as small as 0.25 mg/kg; there is a slightly faster onset with increasing the dose to 1.0 mg/kg.
[u'squirrel']self-administration of the short-acting benzodiazepine midazolam was evaluated in squirrel monkeys.
[u'squirrel']The rates and fixed-ratio patterns of responding maintained by self-administration of midazolam in the present study were comparable to the rates and patterns of responding maintained in squirrel monkeys by self-administration of other drugs of abuse, including cocaine, amphetamine, nicotine and tetrahydrocannabinol, under similar experimental conditions.
[u'coffee', u'pasta']Prevalence of substance use during the past year was estimated as follows: alcohol drinking (regular use-3.8%); coffee drinking (regular use-44.7%); cigarette smoking (regular use-0.2%); regular use of analgesics 21.1%; regular use of benzodiazepines 1.8%; use of narcotics (ever use-0.7%).
[u'squirrel']To examine the behavioral effects of the benzodiazepine-site, GABA(A) agonists zolpidem, zaleplon, and midazolam in the presence of two antagonists, flumazenil and beta-carboline-3-carboxylate-t-butyl ester (beta-CCt) in squirrel monkeys.
[u'sugar']Present study was aimed to investigate the effect of diazepam and buspirone on the blood sugar levels in rabbits.
[u'salt']The effect of trihydroxy (sodium cholate and sodium glycocholate) and dihydroxy (sodium deoxycholate and sodium glycodeoxycholate) bile salt micelles on the spectrophotometric properties and on the solubility of nitrazepam in aqueous solution, at 25.0 degrees C and at ionic strength 0.1 M in sodium chloride, has been assessed.
[u'syrup', u'syrup', u'strawberry']The medicated group received 0.2 mg x kg(-1) of injectable midazolam mixed with an equal volume of strawberry syrup and the placebo group received plain syrup 0.08 ml x kg(-1).
[u'syrup', u'strawberry']Oral midazolam in thick strawberry syrup, administered in small aliquots via the oral transmucosal route was well accepted and proved to be an effective premedicant in infants and preschool children.
[u'agar']chlorpromazine, quinidine, diazepam and phenobarbital on attapulgite and Cross-linked Agar Beads Entrapped Attapulgite(CAA) was determined in this study.
[u'sesame', u'sesame']Mice received chronic diazepam (15mg/kg/day, s.c. in sesame oil), or sesame oil vehicle, for three periods of 7 days, interspersed with 3-day withdrawal periods.
[u'horse']A method for the detection of diazepam in horse hair samples by low resolution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was developed.
[u'squirrel']In squirrel monkeys trained to discriminate a high dose of zolpidem (> or =3.0 mg/kg) from saline, zolpidem and another GABA(A)/alpha1 receptor-preferring agonist, zaleplon, substituted dose-dependently for zolpidem, whereas the non-selective agonists diazepam and triazolam were did not substitute at any dose tested.
[u'grapefruit']Grapefruit juice altered neither the plasma concentrations of alprazolam at any time points, any pharmacokinetic parameters, nor the majority of psychomotor function parameters in subjects.
[u'grapefruit']In study 2, 11 patients with anxiety disorders receiving alprazolam (0.8-2.4 mg/day) ingested grapefruit juice (600 ml/day) for 7 days.
[u'grapefruit']Grapefruit juice altered neither the steady-state plasma concentration of alprazolam nor the clinical status in patients.
[u'grapefruit']The present study shows that grapefruit juice is unlikely to affect pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of alprazolam due to its high bioavailability.
[u'spread', u'arepa']The SPD group had distinctive associated factors: more sites of pain, spread of pain beyond area of original injury, and substantially more opiate and benzodiazepine use.
[u'horseradish']These samples were analyzed by an ELISA that was developed using an antibody raised to flunitrazepam and a drug-enzyme conjugate prepared by attaching 7-aminoflunitrazepam to horseradish peroxidase.
[u'syrup']Pediatric patients (n = 85, ages 6 months through 15 years) underwent invasive procedures and were randomized to a single oral dose of midazolam syrup (0.25, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/kg).
[u'syrup']Patient taste acceptability of midazolam syrup was evaluated at the time of oral administration.
[u'strawberry']Strawberry flavored sweet lollipop containing midazolam (5 mg) and atropine (0.25 mg) was evaluated for the premedication of pediatric patients as judged by sedative and anti-anxious effects and gastric fluid volume and acidity.
[u'ginseng']Wistar male rats pretreated with anti-stress agents like, Panax ginseng (Pg) and diazepam (Diaz) were stressed by restraining for 1 h and 5-HT content of brain and hypothalamus as well as plasma corticosterone were measured spectrophotoflurometrically.
[u'sesame'])-precipitated withdrawal from chronic treatment with diazepam (DZP, 15 mg/kg, s.c. in sesame oil for 21 days) resulted in a decreased seizure threshold to the convulsant, pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), infused into the tail vein; withdrawal from 21-day chronic diazepam treatment, interspersed with two periods of drug withdrawal, resulted in a greater decrease in convulsant threshold.
[u'potato']Using on-line HPLC-electrospray-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) in the "selected reaction monitoring" (SRM) mode, delorazepam and temazepam were found in amounts of about 100 to 200 ng/g cell tissue of Artemisia dracunculus, whereas sterile potato herb contained temazepam and diazepam ranging approximately from 70 to 450 ng/g cell tissue.
[u'cream', u'cream']One hundred children between 10 and 15 kg of body weight scheduled for day-case adenoidectomy were randomly assigned to one of four groups: groups DG and DS received diclofenac 12.5 mg and diazepam 0.5 mg/kg rectally, EMLA cream at the venepuncture site, and placebo orally; groups KG and KS received ketamine 6.0 mg/kg orally, placebo cream at the puncture site, and placebo rectally; additionally, groups DG and KG received glycopyrrolate 5 microg/kg, and groups DS and KS received placebo intravenously.
[u'spread']The contralateral cortical after-discharge duration in the dipotassium clorazepate-treated group was significantly shorter than the after-discharge duration in the amygdala in the first seven stimulations, whereas it was significantly shorter only in the first three stimulations in the control group, indicating that dipotassium clorazepate suppressed the spread of seizure activity from focus to contralateral cortex.
[u'eggs']We used 420 viable embryonated eggs of the commercial Hubbard broiler line treated through the chorioallantoid membrane on the 11th day of incubation: falsely manipulated (Sham group), with 40% propyleneglycol (PG) in simple Ringer solution (Vehicle group), and treated with diazepam (DZ), 8 mg/kg (DZ group).
[u'apple']Ninety-nine patients were randomized to receive 7.5 mg of oral midazolam solution mixed with apple juice or placebo (apple juice), 20 min before sigmoidoscopy.
[u'chocolate']Neither progesterone nor alprazolam decreased chocolate or sweets craving.
[u'squirrel']The present studies compared the effects of the benzodiazepines midazolam, flumazenil, bretazenil, Ro 41-7812, and Ro 42-8773 and the beta-carboline, beta-carboline-3-carboxylate-t-butyl ester (beta-CCt) under two different types of schedule-controlled responding in squirrel monkeys.
[u'grapefruit']Only two benzodiazepines (midazolam and triazolam) were studied in the conditions of grapefruit juice association.
[u'salt', u'sugar']The solubility of lorazepam could be enhanced substantially in different bile salts and also in sugar ether, whereas the solubility in Pluronic F68 (Pl.F68) was of lower order.
[u'horse']Diazepam is extensively metabolized in the horse to nordiazepam, temazepam, and oxazepam.
[u'grape', u'syrup']Injectable midazolam was mixed with a thick grape syrup and placed under the tongue; the patient was asked to hold it as long as possible before swallowing.
[u'fruits', u'beverages']A methodology was developed for the detection and quantitation of diazepam in non-alcoholic carbonated beverages and fruit drinks which are adulterated for criminal motives.
[u'syrup']Alprazolam 1 mg/mL, chloroquine phosphate 15 mg/mL, cisapride 1 mg/mL, enalapril maleate 1 mg/mL, and hydralazine hydrochloride 4 mg/mL were each prepared in a 1:1 mixture of Ora-Sweet and Ora-Plus (Paddock Laboratories), a 1:1 mixture of Ora-Sweet SF and Ora-Plus, and cherry syrup and placed in 120-mL amber clear polyethylene terephthalate bottles.
[u'grapefruit']The mean AUC(0-24) of diazepam was increased 3.2-fold (P < 0.001) and Cmax was increased 1.5-fold (P < 0.05) by the grapefruit juice.
[u'grapefruit']Grapefruit juice postponed the tmax of diazepam from 1.50 h to 2.06 h (P < 0.01).
[u'squirrel']Intravenous sarmazenil challenge given at several fixed intervals following the termination of repeated treatment with a markedly sedative dose of diazepam in squirrel monkeys was effective in precipitating withdrawal signs, but had no comparable effects in vehicle-treated controls.
[u'coffee']Cigarette smoking, coffee and alcohol use were investigated prospectively in 37 high-dose benzodiazepine (BZD) regular users (HDRU), 87 low-dose BZD regular users (LDRU), 50 low-dose BZD occasional users (LDOU) and in 37 non-BZD users (control subjects).
[u'coffee']The findings suggest that BZD should be prescribed with caution in individuals who are heavy smokers or are consuming large amounts of coffee and alcohol.
[u'spread']We speculate that the ALS originates in the midline structures, spreading bilaterally and synchronously to the "dysfunctional" cortex; the sustained discharges were a manifestation of associated reticular lesions, and we believe that intravenous diazepam suppressed the spread of ALS to the "dysfunctional cortex," leading to the appearance of the suppression-burst pattern.
[u'rape']In addition to adhering to standard rape protocols, a urine specimen should be analyzed for flunitrazepam metabolites using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.
[u'syrup']Midazolam was diluted in orange-flavored syrup to yield concentrations of 0.35, 0.64, and 1.03 mg/ml and then stored at room temperature.
[u'angelica']Phellopterin, a naturally occurring furanocoumarin found in the roots of Angelica dahurica, inhibits [3H]diazepam and ethyl 8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5-a][1,4] benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate ([3H]Ro 15-1788) binding to the benzodiazepine site of the rat brain gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor in vitro with IC50 values of 400 and 680 nM, respectively.
[u'syrup']To obtain more information about anecdotal reports of injection of methadone syrup and benzodiazepine drugs among injecting drug users, interviews were conducted with 32 subjects as part of a larger study into drug use patterns of clients in methadone maintenance treatment.
[u'quail']To evaluate the sedative properties of 3 dosages of the benzodiazepine tranquilizer midazolam as a means of chemical restraint in quail (Colinus virginianus) and to evaluate the ability of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil to reverse the sedative effects of midazolam.
[u'syrup']Acetazolamide 25 mg/mL, allopurinol 20 mg/mL, azathioprine 50 mg/mL, clonazepam 0.1 mg/mL, and flucytosine 10 mg/mL were prepared in 1:1 mixture of Ora-Sweet and Ora-Plus (Paddock Laboratories), a 1:1 mixture of Ora-Sweet SF and Ora-Plus (Paddock Laboratories), and cherry syrup and placed in polyethylene terephthalate bottles.
[u'gelatin']The solidification of polyethylene glycols (PEG 1500, PEG 2000, PEG 4000, PEG 6000), gelucire 44/14 or their dispersions containing triamterene or temazepam were studied to assess the feasibility of using these dispersions to liquid-fill hard gelatin capsules.
[u'quail']We have previously found that quail selectively bred to exhibit long (LTI) or short (STI) tonic immobility responses to manual restraint differed with respect to the affinity of binding at the diazepam-sensitive benzodiazepine binding site.
[u'syrup']Residual sedative effects (hangover) were examined in four groups of 20 healthy volunteers, receiving either tablets containing valerian and hops or syrup containing valerian only or flunitrazepam or placebo; furthermore, immediate sedative effects of the two plant preparations have been examined in comparison with placebo (three groups of twelve healthy volunteers).
[u'grapefruit']The grapefruit juice used did have any particular interaction with oral doses of 10 mg midazolam and 0.25 mg triazolam in healthy young subjects.
[u'grapefruit']Since grapefruit juice (Gra) inhibits hepatic P450 (CYP3A4), we studied its potential to enhance the effects of midazolam (Mid) and triazolam (Trz), which are metabolized by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme.
[u'syrup']Seventy-seven children for minor surgery of less than 90 minutes in duration were divided into two groups; one group received midazolam syrup and the other received bromazepam suppository.
[u'syrup']In children under 4 years of age, the sedative effect during the induction was obtained by administering midazolam syrup before the surgery.
[u'syrup']It is indicated that midazolam syrup is superior to the bromazepam suppository in children under 4 years of age.
[u'squirrel']In addition, L-365,260 (1.0-50.0 mg/kg), CI-988 (0.1-10.0 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.1-1.0 mg/kg) were assessed in a squirrel monkey conflict procedure.
[u'spread']In the in vitro experiments concentrations of 10(-5) M, diazepam inhibited a well cell spread and a lower amount of actin after 15 min of incubation was also revealed.
[u'grapefruit']Pretreatment with grapefruit juice is associated with increased bioavailability and changes in the pharmacodynamics of midazolam that may be clinically important, particularly in patients with other causes for increased midazolam bioavailability such as advanced age, cirrhosis of the liver, and administration of other inhibitors of cytochrome P450.
[u'ginger', u'ginger']Patients received oral placebo, ginger BP 0.5g or ginger BP 1.0g, all with oral diazepam premedication, one hour prior to surgery.
[u'cream']A single application of Diazepam in SME cream to mice skin provides pronounced transdermal drug delivery and prolonged protective activity up to 6 hours.
[u'squirrel']The lowest dose of alprazolam, diazepam, flunitrazepam and oxazepam consistently to induce loss of righting reflex in squirrel monkeys or vehicle was orally administered to monkeys on 18 consecutive days: 2 mg/kg alprazolam (n = 4), 30 mg/kg diazepam (n = 4), 1 mg/kg flunitrazepam (n = 4), 280 mg/kg oxazepam (n = 5), or vehicle (n = 4).
[u'pulses', u'pulses', u'pulses']In SRA women, alprazolam restored visible LH pulses in all women and increased the mean LH pulse frequency (P < 0.02) and pulse amplitude (P < 0.05).
[u'atlantic salmon']In order to obtain a basis for future investigations concerning the possible interactions between melatonin, GABA and benzodiazepines in the central nervous system of a teleost fish, the Atlantic salmon, we have studied the expression of immunoreactivity with a monoclonal antibody against the GABAA-receptor beta 2/beta 3-subunits (bd-17) in the salmon brain.
[u'grapefruit']The data suggest that the flavonoids found in grapefruit juice may influence the kinetics of midazolam and quinidine in man.
[u'rainbow trout']The effect of benzodiazepines (BZP) on melatonin release was investigated in the pineal gland of the rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, maintained under in vitro perifusion culture conditions.
[u'squirrel']The short-acting benzodiazepine triazolam has been shown to cause phase-dependent phase shifts of the circadian activity rhythms of squirrel monkeys maintained in constant light.
[u'syrup', u'syrup']Using high-pressure liquid chromatography, we assayed midazolam concentrations over time when mixed at two different concentrations (2.5 mg/mL and 3.0 mg/mL) in a sucrose-based syrup (Simple Syrup, NF).
[u'salt']A23187, a calcium ionophore, partially recovered the basal tone which had been reduced by diazepam in normal physiologic salt solution (PSS).
[u'salt']The interactions of chlorpromazine, clomipramine, maprotiline and viloxazine hydrochlorides, and of clorazepate dipotassium salt and diazepam with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and Stedim 6 infusion bags were studied.
[u'salt', u'salt']Since BZR agonists appear to enhance positive hedonic reactions to taste stimuli selectively, it was hypothesized that bretazenil (and a second BZR partial agonist Ro 17-1812) would selectively enhance intake of a preferred 0.9% salt solution, but not necessarily reduce the relative aversion to a more concentrated 1.8% salt solution, in these choice tests.
[u'gelatin']The stability of midazolam hydrochloride in flavored gelatin was evaluated after storage at 4 degrees C for 14 days and at -20 degrees C for 28 days.
[u'gelatin']A flavored liquid gelatin mixture was prepared and mixed with midazolam hydrochloride injection in final concentrations of midazolam 1 and 2 mg/mL.
[u'gelatin', u'gelatin', u'gelatin']Gelatin cups containing 5 and 15 mg of midazolam were prepared by measuring appropriate volumes of the gelatin stock solutions and were stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C or in a freezer at -20 degrees C. Immediately after preparation and at 7 and 14 days, three refrigerated and three frozen gelatin samples of each midazolam concentration were visually inspected, tested for pH, and assayed for midazolam concentration by high-performance liquid chromatography.
[u'gelatin', u'gelatin']The frozen gelatin samples were also evaluated at 21 and 28 days; three whole and three partial gelatin samples were assayed for midazolam content to determine the uniformity of drug distribution within each sample.
[u'gelatin']The midazolam content of the gelatin in the cups was uniform.
[u'gelatin', u'gelatin']An extemporaneously compounded preparation of midazolam hydrochloride in flavored gelatin was stable when stored for 14 days at 4 degrees C and for 28 days at -20 degrees C. Distribution of midazolam hydrochloride in the gelatin was uniform.
[u'squirrel']The interactions between alcohol, benzodiazepines and aggression were examined in similar ethopharmacological studies in squirrel monkeys and in rats in confrontations with conspecifics.
[u'squirrel']Ethopharmacological studies on the behavior of socially housed rats and squirrel monkeys were conducted to explore the role of the benzodiazepine GABAA-coupled ionophore receptor complex in aggressive and social interactions.
[u'squirrel']Benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) antagonists, ZK 93426 (1-10 mg/kg) and flumazenil (3-10 mg/kg), the partial agonist, ZK 91296 (1-10 mg/kg) and the partial inverse agonists Ro 15-4513 (0.3-10 mg/kg), were administered to (1) squirrel monkeys prior to 1 h focal observations within established social groups or to (2) resident male rats before confrontations with a naive male intruder in their home cage for 5 min.
[u'spread']When compared to the EEG recorded before each of the three drugs was administered, naloxone tended to enhance the increase in the power of the intermediate alpha EEG (9.4-10.4 Hz), while diazepam tended to spread the increase to the slow (7.4-9.4 Hz) alpha EEG, and flumazenil was without much effect on the overall EEG pattern.
[u'squirrel']Consistent with its characterization as a partial agonist, Ro 19-8022 antagonized the motor impairment induced by the full agonists diazepam or meclonazepam measured in horizontal wire and rotarod tests in rodents, and reduced flunitrazepam-induced effects in squirrel monkeys, with an efficacy comparable to that of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil.
[u'salt']The results make it possible for the hospital pharmacist to prepare dipotassium chlorazepate salt and midazolam admixtures up to 3 days before administration, provided the former are stocked in a refrigerator and the latter are prepared in dextrose isotonic solutions.
[u'syrup']A 2.5-mg/mL solution of injectable midazolam in syrup was stable for 56 days at 7, 20, or 40 degrees C.
[u'quail']Quantitative receptor autoradiography was used to study the neuroanatomical distribution and effects of gonadal hormones on [3H] flunitrazepam binding in the male Japanese quail brain.
[u'quail']In gonadally intact quail brains, [3H] flunitrazepam displayed a heterogeneous distribution, with elevated levels in the posterior brain regions such as the stratum griseum et fibrosum superficiale and stratum griseum centrale of the optic tectum.
[u'gelatin']An open, randomized, cross-over study involving 24 healthy volunteers, shows that a novel formulation of temazepam (temazepam Gelthix, TG) in soft gelatin capsules designed to resist i.v.
[u'ginseng', u'ginseng']Pilot studies indicated that single-dose administration of ginseng had little to no acute behavioural effects, hence the two varieties of ginseng were administered orally at two dose levels twice daily for 5 days, while diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.)
[u'ginseng']The effects induced by white and red ginseng (50 mg/kg x 5 days) were comparable to those induced by diazepam (1 mg/kg).
[u'syrup']Deep sedation can be administered enterally using oral ketamine, 6-8 mg/kg, combined with glycopyrrolate mixed in simple syrup and preceded by a dose of an oral benzodiazepine and sodium citrate.
[u'pulses']Inhibition of the Na+ current by diazepam increased use-dependently over 9 depolarizing pulses repeated at high frequency (200 Hz), whereas use-dependent effects of the other compounds developed less rapidly.
[u'ymer']Recombinant GABAA (gamma-aminobutyrate-Type A) receptors that are sensitive to benzodiazepine receptor ligands can be generated by coexpression of alpha-, beta-, and gamma 2-subunit cDNAs (Pritchett, D. B., Sontheimer, H., Shivers, B. D., Ymer S., Kettenmann, H., Schofield, P. R., and Seeburg, P. H. (1989) Nature 338, 582-585; Pritchett, D. B., Lunkddens, H., and Seeburg, P. H. (1989) Science 245, 1389-1392; Malherbe, P., Sigel, E., Baur, R., Perssohn, E., Richards, J. G., and Mohler, H. (1990) J. Neurosci.
[u'gelatin']The effect of temazepam as a hypnotic was assessed with two different formulations, the solution-filled soft gelatin capsule and the more recently introduced elixir.
[u'cottonseed']We studied the effects of psychosocial stress (S) and diazepam (D) on plasma lipids, adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), and corticosterone (B) levels of cockerels fed an atherogenic diet (AD) consisting of 2% cholesterol plus 5% cottonseed oil added to plain mash (PM).
[u'apple', u'apple']In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 124 children, ages 1-10 yr, received midazolam, 0.25, 0.50, or 0.75 mg.kg-1 po, and atropine, 0.03 mg.kg-1 po, mixed with apple juice, or a placebo (containing the midazolam vehicle, atropine, and apple juice).
[u'squirrel']In the present study we examined the effects of the benzodiazepine midazolam and a series of 5-HT1A agonists on punished responding of squirrel monkeys.
[u'gelatin']Each was randomly assigned to receive either placebo, 7.5, 15, or 30 mg temazepam hard gelatin capsules (Restoril) administered double-blind 30 min before bedtime on their first night in the sleep laboratory.
[u'salt']Diazepam and ipsapirone dose-dependently released drinking suppressed by either salt concentration in W rats, but caused little or no effect in M rats.
[u'horseradish']A novel enzymatic ligand binding assay for biotin and its benzodiazepine conjugate is based on their binding to horseradish peroxidase-avidin conjugate (A-P) followed by the uptake of biotin-unsaturated A-P onto polystyrene beads coated with biotin-BSA.
[u'whey']The extent of binding of diazepam and tenoxicam in the milk of various species was independent of the whey protein concentration.
[u'casein']In human milk the fraction of bromazepam, clonazepam, diazepam, and flunitrazepam bound to casein was higher than that bound to any other of the milk proteins tested.
[u'casein']The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil showed the lowest overall binding in milk and in casein solution.
[u'squirrel']Alprazolam was studied for its effects on schedule-controlled behavior of squirrel monkeys.
[u'coffee', u'coffee']A study of the prediction of cancer and coronary heart disease on the basis of coffee consumption and personality shows that in cancer-prone probands (diagnosed on the basis of a personality inventory) coffee consumption was related to low incidence of cancer and high incidence of coronary heart disease, while diazepam showed the opposite trend.
[u'coffee']In coronary heart disease-prone probands coffee drinking was also linked with low incidence of cancer and high incidence of coronary heart disease, with diazepam again showing the opposite trend.
[u'coffee']In a personality type not prone to either disease, neither coffee consumption nor diazepam was linked with death from cancer or coronary heart disease.
[u'coffee']It is suggested that personality interacts in a predictable way with coffee and diazepam to determine in part the likelihood of death from cancer or coronary heart disease.
[u'tea']The presence of benzodiazepine (BZD)-like molecules as well as of other substances with affinity for the brain BZD-receptors was explored in eight non-flowering plants known to contain biflavonoids, three flowering plants used as sedatives in folkloric medicine and one plant extensively used in Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil and Paraguay as a tea substitute.
[u'gelatin']Fourteen patients received oral premedication of temazepam in soft gelatin capsules before minor surgery.
[u'squirrel']The beta-carboline FG 7142 was studied alone and in combination with Ro 15-1788, CGS 8216 and lorazepam in squirrel monkeys trained to respond under a fixed-interval (FI) schedule of food presentation.
[u'deer']In both populations of deer mice the peppermint-induced analgesia was blocked by naloxone and insensitive to the benzodiazepine manipulations.
[u'wheat', u'potato']Aqueous acid extracts of wheat grains and potato exhibit after HPLC separation a series of compounds that are able to inhibit the binding of benzodiazepines to benzodiazepine receptors of rat brain membranes.
[u'wheat']In wheat one of the inhibiting compounds was shown to be identical to diazepam by means of HPLC characterization and gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry.
[u'wheat', u'potato']In wheat and potato germination increases total inhibiting activity of the whole plant extracts as well as the content of the benzodiazepines approximately by factor five.
[u'fishes']Tryptic degradation led to a common peptide of 40K in all species investigated, a finding indicating that the benzodiazepine binding proteins are structurally homologous in higher bony fishes and tetrapods.
[u'squirrel']Behavioral effects of the benzodiazepine agonist quazepam were compared with those of lorazepam in squirrel monkeys responding under a fixed-interval schedule of food presentation with a superimposed fixed-ratio schedule of response-produced shock.
[u'wheat', u'potato']Aqueous acid extracts of wheat grains and of potato tuber were found to contain a series of compounds displaying a high affinity to the central type benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) in mammalian brain.
[u'wheat', u'potato']In wheat grains diazepam, N-desmethyldiazepam, delorazepam, deschloro-diazepam, delormetazepam, lormetazepam and isodiazepam were identified, while potato tuber contained diazepam, N-desmethyldiazepam, delorazepam, lorazepam and delormetazepam.
[u'squirrel']The effects of oral administration of two doses of ethanol (0.75 and 1.5 g/kg) and a single dose of diazepam (2.5 mg/kg) on electrophysiological responses to an event related potential (ERP) paradigm were investigated in the squirrel monkey Saimiri Sciureus.
[u'syrup']Six infants with a history of wheezing were given temazepam syrup as sedation, to allow lung function tests to be performed.
[u'squirrel']The results suggest that CGS 8216 has benzodiazepine inverse agonist effects on schedule-controlled behavior of squirrel monkeys.
[u'fishes']In these species, the respective affinities of the compounds were remarkably similar, suggesting that the binding sites for benzodiazepines are conserved in higher bony fishes and tetrapods.
[u'salt']The effects of daily oral administration of imipramine (IM) hydrochloride (50 mg/kg) and/or oxazepam (OZ, 20 mg/kg) or diazepam (DZ, 5 mg/kg) in a 1% aqueous solution of carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt (CMC) on the activities of drug metabolizing enzyme systems and steady state plasma levels of IM, desmethylimipramine (DIM), DZ, desmethyl-diazepam (DDZ) and OZ were investigated in rats during a 15-day period.
[u'gelatin', u'gelatin']A reversed-phase, high-performance liquid chromatographic assay method is described for temazepam hard gelatin and soft gelatin capsule analysis.

[u'squirrel']The effects of oral administration of 3 doses of ethanol (0.75, 1.0 and 1.5 g/kg) and single doses of morphine (2.5 mg/kg) and diazepam (2.5 mg/kg) on spectral components of the EEG were investigated in the squirrel monkey Saimiri sciureus.
[u'squirrel']Behavioral effects of the beta-carboline derivatives ZK 93423 (6-benzyloxy-4-methoxymethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester) and ZK 91296 (5-benzyloxy-4-methoxymethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester) were compared with those of lorazepam and suriclone in squirrel monkeys.
[u'squirrel']Although many beta-carboline derivatives have been found to act as "inverse agonists" at benzodiazepine recognition sites, the present results show that ZK 93423 and ZK 91296 have clear benzodiazepine-like (agonist) effects on schedule-controlled behavior in squirrel monkeys.

[u'gelatin']Temazepam given in a soft gelatin capsule to patients in the supine position had a reasonably fast gastrointestinal absorption, but its blood-lumbar cerebrospinal fluid penetration rate appeared to be quite slow.
[u'salt']The effects of daily oral administration of imipramine hydrochloride (5-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenz-[b,f]azepine monohydrochloride; 50 mg/kg) and/or diazepam (7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-5-phenyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one ; 5 mg/kg) in a 1% aqueous solution of carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt (CMC) on the body weight, organ weights, and activities of various enzymes, including drug metabolizing enzyme systems were investigated in rats during a 15-day period.
[u'chocolate']Chronic (5 days) administration of chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) to dominant animals, as judged in a previous competition for chocolate, led to a fall in success, whether the animals had been previously housed together for 1, 2 or 6 months.
[u'salt']Psychotropic substances of different action were used for the analysis: nootropes as anti-amnestic--pyracetam (400 mg/kg), kleregil (100 mg/kg), centrofenoxin (50 mg/kg) and watersoluble salt of 3-oxypiridin derivative (3-OP) (50 mg/kg) and tranquilizer of bensodiazepine series phenazepam (1 mg/kg) as antistress and antiphobic.
[u'squirrel']The effects of zopiclone, CL 218,872 and diazepam were compared in squirrel monkeys trained to respond under a fixed-interval (FI) schedule of food presentation.

[u'squirrel']Ro 15-1788 completely reversed effects of diazepam on the righting response of pigeons and squirrel monkeys but was ineffective against comparable effects produced by pentobarbital.
[u'gelatin']A single dose of temazepam 10 mg, as a solution in soft gelatin capsules, was given to 10 fasting geriatric in-patients (mean age 83 years) in a stable clinical condition.
[u'gelatin']Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the soft gelatin capsule and tablet form of temazepam were compared.
[u'gelatin', u'gelatin']In a single blind study, six healthy volunteers, in the supine position, took either a tablet of temazepam 20 mg or a soft gelatin capsule of temazepam 20 mg. Sixty gynaecological in-patients received either a tablet or a soft gelatin capsule of temazepam 20 mg the night before surgery as premedication.
[u'squirrel']The behavioral effects of the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 were studied in squirrel monkeys after acute injections of benzodiazepines.

[u'crayfish']On the stretch-induced discharge activity of the isolated crayfish sensory neuron flurazepam (less than or equal to 3 X 10(-4) M) and Ro 15-1788 (less than or equal to 10(-3) M) produced reversible concentration-dependent excitation, but oxazepam only produced depression (less than or equal to 5 X 10(-4) M).
[u'gelatin']The bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and effects on performance of lormetazepam (1 mg) have been compared using soft gelatin capsule and tablet formulations.
[u'gelatin']Lormetazepam was more rapidly absorbed from the soft gelatin capsule (tmax = 1.0 +/- 0.2 h) than from the tablet (tmax = 2.4 +/- 0.4 h), and the plasma concentration-time curve for the capsule was shifted to the left.
[u'salt']Treatment of these conditions using benzodiazepines may require due consideration of the possible stimulant effect of these drugs on salt appetite.
[u'crayfish']Oxazepam produced a significant reversible monophasic concentration-dependent (50-500 mumol/l) depression of stretch-induced discharge frequency of the isolated crayfish sensory neuron.
[u'salt']The least controversial anti-edema therapeutic measures include relative fluid and salt restriction, mannitol if called for, neuroplegia, in particular with diazepam and Gamma-OH, and assisted ventilation.
[u'cabbage']Cabbage and brussels sprouts induced a 17% decrease in mean plasma AUC and a 19% increase in mean metabolic clearance rate for oxazepam, but there was no change in mean plasma t1/2 for this drug, nor was there a change in ratio in plasma of oxazepam glucuronide to oxazepam.

[u'squid']External application of 0.05-1.0 mM flurazepam was found to partially block both sodium and potassium currents in voltage-clamped squid giant axons.
[u'alcoholic beverages', u'beverages']During weaning of ambulatory alcoholic subjects by gradual withdrawal of alcoholic beverages, bromazepam proved useful in reducing the anxiety load.
[u'salt']Substitution of buffered salt perfusate in both maternal and fetal circuits for a perfusate with plasma proteins did not alter diazepam transfer significantly.
[u'squirrel']In conscious, unrestrained squirrel monkeys and cats, quazepam produced sedation with less ataxia and less evidence of CNS stimulant action than flurazepam.
[u'squirrel']In neurological and behavioral studies in mice, rats, dogs and squirrel monkeys, the imidazobenzodiazepinone Ro 15-1788 acted as a potent benzodiazepine antagonist.
[u'tea', u'coffee']These results are consistent with reports that particular substances contained in coffee and tea and in cigarette smoke stimulate the synthesis of hepatic enzymes which metabolize both the benzodiazepines here studied and the substances which have stimulated enzyme synthesis.
[u'squirrel']Hypothermia was produced by IM administration of diazepam (0.125-0.5 mg/kg) to squirrel monkeys of various ages (2-16 years) in a thermoneutral (23 +/- 0.5 degrees C) environment with animals over eight years of age having slightly greater responses.
[u'eggs']Increasing doses of diazepam were associated with increasing numbers of degenerated eggs and decreasing rates of fertilization when compared to results in control animals.
[u'squirrel']The magnitude of the anticonflict effect of midazolam is smaller than that of diazepam in rats and squirrel monkeys, probably because a more pronounced sedative component interferes with the increase of punished responses.
[u'whisky']The effects of temazepam 20 mg and temazepam 20 mg plus whisky 100 ml on sleep and performance were investigated in 5 healthy volunteers in comparison with placebo.
[u'squirrel']The effects of morphine, diazepam and chlorpromazine were examined on the discrimination of electric shock in squirrel monkeys.
[u'snail']The new psychotropic drug phenazepam inhibits the impulse activity of the neurons which compose visceral ganglia of the garden snail (Helix aspersa) and suppresses stimulating postsynaptic potentials arising in application of acetylcholine to the membrane of isolated neurons.
[u'gelatin']1 Healthy volunteers received single doses of temazepam 30 mg in conventional gelatin capsules, suppositories or in solution.
[u'gelatin']Seventy insomniac patients, previously unresponsive to conventional hypnotic dosage, were treated for seven nights with temazepam in 20 mg soft gelatin capsules (Euhypnos Forte).
[u'gelatin']In an open evaluation, soft gelatin capsules containing 20 mg temazepam (Euhypnos Forte) were administrated in doses of 40--60 mg to 134 patients from twenty-two general practices.
[u'squirrel']Ethanol, pentobarbital, and chlordiazepoxide were administered to squirrel monkeys responding under a multiple schedule comprised of two fixed-ratio 100-response schedules (FR 100).
[u'squirrel']Dose-response profiles were determined for chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam in a squirrel monkey punishment (conflict) procedure.
[u'gelatin', u'syrup']The sleep-inducing properties and tolerance of temazepam formulated in solution in soft gelatine capsules were compared with chlormethiazole syrup in two groups of geriatric in-patients.
[u'gelatin']Plasma levels of temazepam were determined in healthy subjects after single oral administration of soft and hard gelatin capsules, and after 7 consecutive night-time doses in soft capsules.
[u'squirrel']The effects of pentobarbital and diazepam were compared in a series of tests in squirrel monkeys; the effects of phenobarbital and flurazepam were compared in a second series.
[u'spread']Effects of clonazepam, nitrazepam and diazepam on penicillin induced primary, spread and reactive epileptoform discharges were investigated in gallamine immobilized cats.
[u'spread']shortened the duration of primary epileptoform discharges and prolonged the interictal interval in the cortical, amygdaloid and intralaminal thalamic epileptogenesis induced by a high concentration of penicillin G. When a low concentration of penicillin G was injected into the cortex, amygdala and intralaminal thalamus, benzodiazepines abolished the spread of primary epileptoform discharges and the reactive discharges, but did not suppress completely the primary epileptogenic discharges and the contralateral reflective activity.
[u'spread']It is concluded that the anticonvulsive effect of benzodiazepines may be due to the blackades of neuronal pathways which spread the seizure discharges from the site of origin (focus) to the effector organ, and the elevation of convulsive thresholds.
[u'chocolate', u'syrup', u'syrup']In one suspension, consisting of eight triturated tablets, 4.0 ml ethanol, 24.0 ml propylene glycol, 20.0 ml Syrup, USP, and 32.0 ml chocolate syrup, 90% of the diazepam was dissolved.
[u'gelatin', u'gelatin']Temazepam was orally administered at doses of 15, 20 or 30 mg in hard gelatin capsules or 20 mg in soft gelatin capsules.
