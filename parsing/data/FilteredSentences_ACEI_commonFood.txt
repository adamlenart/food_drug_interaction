[u'casein', u'whey']In this study, we examined the separated caseins and whey proteins of goat milk for the presence of ACE inhibitory peptides.
[u'casein', u'whey']Digestion of isolated whey proteins and caseins of goat milk by gastric pepsin generated soluble hydrolysates exhibiting significant inhibition of ACE compared to weak inhibition by undigested proteins.
[u'casein', u'whey']The late-eluting fraction (F4) of either whey or caseins exhibited greater ACE inhibition.
[u'casein', u'whey']The peptides from whey and caseins exert significant ACE inhibitory activities comparable to that of captopril, an antihypertensive drug, exhibiting IC50 values of 4.45unkunkM and 4.27unkunkM, respectively.
[u'casein', u'whey']The results introduce, for the first time, new potent ACE-inhibitory peptides that can be released by gastric pepsin of goat milk whey and caseins and thus may pave the way for their candidacy as anti-hypertensive bioactive peptides and prevention of associated disorders.

[u'whey']Compared to hydrolysates from whey protein, where the inhibitory effect can almost exclusively be attributed to Ile-Trp, the ACE inhibition by plant protein hydrolysates is caused by a variety of peptides, in particular tyrosine-containing peptides.
[u'date']The annual rate of adverse events related to ACE inhibitors (ie, the number of reported cases of adverse events per 1000 patients receiving an ACE inhibitor) was calculated from data captured on the date the events were first reported for the 5 years before and 5 years after the revocation of the PA constraint.
[u'salt']These findings suggest a therapeutic potential for mas and/or AT2 receptor activation and ACE inhibition in restoring endothelial function impaired by elevated dietary salt intake or other pathological conditions.
[u'pasta']Control pasta had the lowest ACEI activity or TEAC (22.01unkunkunk0.76unk% or 14.14unkunkunk1.28unkunkmol Trolox/g, respectively).
[u'pasta']Higher activity remained in pasta with PLH than VUH after extrusion, and higher the level of addition, higher the ACEI was.
[u'pasta']Pasta had practically the same ACEI activity after cooking, thus active compounds were not lost by temperature or lixiviation.

[u'casein']The ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant capacities of milk casein increased during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion.
[u'casein', u'casein']Casein haplotype significantly influenced the antioxidative and ACE-inhibitory capacities of digested casein.
[u'casein', u'casein', u'casein', u'casein']In particular, BB-A(2)A(1)-AA casein and BB-A(1)A(1)-AA casein showed the highest ACE-inhibitory capacity, BB-A(2)A(2)-AA casein showed the highest antioxidant capacity, whereas BB-A(2)A(2)-BB casein showed the lowest biological capacity.

The generated hydrolysate was subjected to molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) filtration, following which the non-ultrafiltered hydrolysate (NUFH), and the generated 3 kDa and 10 kDa MWCO filtrates were assessed for their in vitro ACE-I inhibitory activities.
[u'barley']The 3 kDa filtrate (1 mg/ml), that demonstrated highest ACE-I inhibitory activity of 70.37%, was characterised in terms of its peptidic composition using mass spectrometry and 1882 peptides derived from 61 barley proteins were identified, amongst which 15 peptides were selected for chemical synthesis based on their predicted ACE-I inhibitory properties.

[u'cheese', u'cheese', u'whey', u'whey']The 10-5 kDa whey fraction of Ranchero cheese had the highest Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (0.62 unk 0.00 mM), and the 3-1 kDa Panela and Fresco cheese whey fractions showed the highest ACE-inhibitory activity (0.57 unk 0.02 and 0.59 unk 0.04 unkg/mL 50%-inhibitory concentration values, respectively).
[u'cheese']The occurrence of 8 bovine casein-derived peptides (VPP, IPP, RYLGY, RYLG, AYFYPEL, AYFYPE, LHLPLP, and HLPLP) reported as angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors (ACE-I) was investigated in the 3-kDa ultrafiltered water-soluble extract (WSE) of Parmigiano Reggiano (PR) cheese samples by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry via an electrospray ionization source.

[u'fruits']These results suggest that the crude extract from Acanthopanax sessiliflorus fruits and the isolated seco-triterpenoids from the crude extract enhance the blood flow effect by decreasing ACE activity.
[u'vinegar']Vinegar and acetic acid could decrease serum renin and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activities, angiotensin II and aldosterone concentrations in SHRs.
[u'whey']Whey protein hydrolysate and isoleucine-tryptophan powerfully inhibit plasma ACE resulting in antihypertensive effects.

[u'soy milk']We previously demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) could be inhibited by soy milk that had been fermented with the Lactobacillus plantarum strain TWK10, suggesting great potential for the development of antihypertensive products.
[u'soy milk', u'water']In this work, the bioactive ACE inhibitors in TWK10-fermented soy milk water extracts were isolated, and a combination of uracil and glycerol (CUG) was identified as one of the ACE inhibitors.

[u'rice']Rice bran proteins were fractioned into albumin, globulin, prolamin and glutelin, which were subjected to hydrolysis by four protease preparations, namely Alcalase, Neutrase, Flavourzyme and Protamax, and the inhibitory activities of the hydrolysates against unk-amylase, unk-glucosidase and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), were monitored over a hydrolysis period of 240 min.
[u'date']At the date of discharge, the tendency to prescribe b-blockers (p < 0.05), ACEI (p < 0.001), and statins (p < 0.001) was also declining.

[u'common bean', u'bean']The results support the hypothesis that peptides present in the non-digestible fraction of common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) may exert their physiological benefits independent of their antioxidant capacity, by ACE inhibition through interaction with its catalytic cavity.
[u'soy milk', u'yogurt']Here, we evaluated the fermentation characteristics (pH, titratable acidity, free amino nitrogen, and viable bacterial counts), ACE-inhibitory activity, and contents of Val-Pro-Pro (VPP) and Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP) peptides of stored yogurt (4unkC for 28 d) fermented by L. helveticus isolate H9 (initially inoculated at 4 concentrations), from cow, mare, and soy milks.

[u'bean', u'bean']IC50 values for ACE were not significantly different among all bean hydrolysates (range 0.20 to 0.34 mg protein/mL), except for Red bean that presented higher IC50 values.
[u'whey']Bovine whey protein hydrolysates, obtained employing the enzyme extracts of A. minus flowers, displayed inhibitory angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and antioxidant activities.
[u'whey']The results obtained in this study demonstrate the viability of using proteases from A. minus to increase the antioxidant and inhibitory ACE capacity of whey proteins.

[u'casein', u'whey']The putative effects of milk and dairy products are possibly mediated through their mineral content of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and vitamin D. These dairy substances exercise their blood pressure-lowering effect either directly on the arterial wall by these minerals or indirectly through blockade of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by the amino acids contained in the casein and whey of milk.

[u'whey']A sample of WE80BG derived from whey proteins showed the strongest anti-hypertensive activity (-21.2 +/- 16.9 mm Hg) with a medium level of ACE inhibitory activity (53.6%), and it was subjected to hydrophobic and gel filtration chromatography.
[u'whey']By means of an ACE inhibitory peptide database, containing about 500 reported sequences and their IC(50) values, the different proteins in pea and whey were quantitatively evaluated as precursors for ACE inhibitory peptides.
[u'whey']The major whey protein beta-lactoglobulin obtained the highest in silico scores, which corresponded with the fact that degradation of this protein in vitro only occurred from the simulated small intestine phase on and resulted in a 10-fold increase in the ACE inhibitory activity.
[u'whey', u'whey']Whey protein obtained total in silico scores of about 124 ml/mg, compared to 46 ml/mg for pea protein, indicating that whey protein would be a richer source of ACE inhibitory peptides than pea protein.
[u'whey']Although beta-lactoglobulin is only partially digested, a higher ACE inhibitory activity was indeed found in the whey (IC(50) = 0.048 mg/ml) compared to the pea digest (IC(50) = 0.076 mg/ml).
[u'water']The maximum ACE inhibitory activity (IC50: 0.31 mg) was obtained when the fruiting body of T. giganteum was extracted with distilled water at 30 degrees C for 3 h. After the purification of ACE inhibitory peptides with ultrafiltration, Sephadex G-25 column chromatography, and reverse-phase HPLC, an active fraction with an IC50 of 0.04 mg and a yield of 0.3% was obtained.
[u'date']With few exceptions, studies to date have not fully evaluated the associations between posttransplant anemia (PTA) and medications commonly used in KTR, particularly immunosuppressant drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB).
[u'water', u'wakame']We examined the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity and antihypertensive effect of the hot water extract of wakame, Undaria pinnatifida.
[u'sugar']Blood sugar and blood pressure control can reduce microvascular (retinopathy and nephropathy) complications; eye examinations with timely follow-up and photocoagulation can prevent vision loss; foot care can decrease serious foot disease and amputations; control of blood pressure and lipids as well as aspirin use can prevent or diminish cardiovascular disease events; angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can reduce nephropathy and cardiovascular disease; and influenza and pneumococcal vaccines can reduce hospitalizations, respiratory conditions, and death.
[u'rabbit']A protocol to follow the processing of angiotensin I into angiotensin II by rabbit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and its inhibition by a novel natural antagonist, the leech osmoregulator factor (LORF) using capillary zonal electrophoresis is described.
[u'rabbit']We demonstrated that LORF (IPEPYVWD), a neuropeptide previously found in leech brain, is able to inhibit rabbit ACE with an IC(50) of 19.8 micro m. Interestingly, its cleavage product, IPEP exhibits an IC(50) of 11.5 micro m. A competition assay using p-benzoylglycylglycylglycine and insect ACE established that LORF and IPEP fragments are natural inhibitors for invertebrate ACE.
[u'spinach']Pepsin and pepsin-pancreatin digests of spinach leaf protein have potent angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibitory properties with IC(50) values of 56 and 120 microg/mL, respectively.
[u'water']A&A, ACEI or the same amount of water was administered by gavage beginning 24 hours before UUO preparation and continued through ten days after UUO.
[u'water']Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) with captopril has been shown to increase water intake and urine output in rats, but the mechanism is unknown.
[u'water']We conclude that ACEI with captopril induces primary polydipsia despite impaired production of the dipsogen ANG II and that this primary increase in water intake is likely the cause of the decreased protein abundance of inner medullary AQP2.
[u'sunflower']Sunflower protein isolates and the proteases pepsin and pancreatin were used for the production of protein hydrolysates that inhibit angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE).
[u'sunflower']These results show that sunflower seed proteins are a potential source of ACE inhibitory peptides when hydrolyzed with pepsin and pancreatin.
[u'rabbit']To assess the effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (ACEI) perindopril on prolonged endothelial cell dysfunction in a rabbit endotoxic model.
[u'water']The ingestion of 0.3 M NaCl and water was induced by subcutaneous injections of the diuretic furosemide (FURO, 10 mg/kg) and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (CAP, 5 mg/kg), and extracellular concentrations of 5-HT and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were measured using intracerebral microdialysis techniques.
[u'salt']We compared the effects of 4 weeks treatment of the vasopeptidase inhibitor omapatrilat and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril on the degree of fibrosis and the concentration of VIP in the heart in salt sensitive hypertension induced by treatment with L-nitro-omega-methylarginine (L-NAME).
[u'spread']Both ACEI and BB are highly underutilised therapy in CCF and there is an urgent necessity to spread message among the medical fraternity for their enhanced use.
[u'wheat']Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptide was isolated from wheat gliadin hydrolysate prepared with acid protease.
[u'whey']An analytical method based on on-line liquid chromatography-biochemical detection (LC-BCD) coupled to electrospray mass spectrometry was developed for the detection and identification of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in complex mixtures, such as hydrolyzed whey proteins.
[u'spinach']Four new inhibitory peptides for angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), that is, MRWRD, MRW, LRIPVA, and IAYKPAG, were isolated from the pepsin-pancreatin digest of spinach Rubisco with the use of HPLC.
[u'water']The experiment was carried out under the low water activity condition, using tosylate chloride activating side-chain hydroxyl group of Sepharose CL-4B agarose to form a high active group which could react with the free amino-group of ACE to link the enzyme with agarose.
[u'whey']In this study, the conditions of in vitro gastrointestinal digestion leading to the formation and degradation of ACE inhibitory peptides were investigated for pea and whey protein.
[u'whey']In batch experiments, the digestion simulating the physiological conditions sufficed to achieve the highest ACE inhibitory activity, with IC(50) values of 0.076 mg/mL for pea and 0.048 mg/mL for whey protein.
[u'whey']These results show that ACE inhibitory activity of pea and whey hydrolysates can be controlled by the conditions of in vitro gastrointestinal digestion.
[u'tea']Green tea extract (EFLA85942) is able to induce specifically the neutral endopeptidase (NEP) activity and to inhibit the proliferation of SK-N-SH cells; the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity is not influenced under the same conditions.
[u'tea', u'tea']The treatment of the cells with arabinosylcytosine and green tea extract results in a strong enhancement of cellular NEP activity whereas cellular ACE activity was not changed significantly, indicating a green tea extract-specific regulation of NEP expression.
[u'pectin', u'pectin']Solutions of 100 mL of 1% commercial pectin each with a different degree of esterification (DE), DE94, DE65, and DE25, were reacted with 100 mL of 2 M alkaline hydroxylamine (pH 12.0) at room temperature for 4 or 18 h. These pectin hydroxamic acids (PHAs; DE94T4, DE94T18, DE65T4, and DE25T4) were used to test the inhibitory activities against semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).
[u'buffalo']Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine alpha(S1)-casein (alpha(S1)-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and beta-CN f58-76; ovine alpha(S1)-CN f1-6 and alpha(S2)-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine beta-CN f58-65 and alpha(S2)-CN f182-187; buffalo beta-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human beta-CN.
[u'whey']Of the samples assayed, it was infant formulae whey that produces the greatest ACE inhibition.
[u'water']To investigate whether an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (losartan) could mitigate age-associated changes in kidney mitochondria, male Wistar rats (14 mo old) received during 8 mo water containing either enalapril (10 mg/kg/day) (Enal), or losartan (30 mg/kg/day) (Los), or no additions (Old).
[u'cheese']These results strongly suggest that digestive enzymes diminished the ACE inhibition by the peptides present in Emmental cheese WSE, while the digestion of peptides of high molecular weight would generate new ACE inhibitory peptides.
[u'water']We studied interstitial changes in rats before and after release of UUO and examined the effect of ACEI with 200mg/L of enalapril (E) in the drinking water on these changes.
[u'shortening']Percent shortening and -dL/dt of isolated adjacent myocytes were improved with both ACEI (7.9 +/- 0.3%, -131 +/- 6 microm/sec, P <.05) and CT (7.7 +/- 0.3%, -144 +/- 8 microm/sec, P <.05) compared with no therapy (6.4 +/- 0.4%, -104 +/- 7 microm/sec), as was both +dL/dt and TR 70%.
[u'shortening']Fractional shortening increased from 17.0 +/- 7.6 to 19.8 +/- 8.9% (p = 0.017) in the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor group and from 16.6 +/- 7.2 to 24.7 +/- 8.0% (p < 0.0001) in the beta-blocker group, respectively.
[u'shortening']Changes of left ventricular dimensions at end-diastole and at end-systole, and fractional shortening were all greater in the beta-blocker group than in the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor group.
[u'water']Lisinopril in drinking water (20, 50, or 200 mg/L) was administered to 10-week-old male Wistar Bonn/Kobori (WBN/Kob) rats for 10 weeks and then the inflammatory parameters, fibrosis, serum and pancreatic ACE activity, and expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) messenger RNA (mRNA) as well as positive immunostaining for alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) were assessed.
[u'water']Furthermore, blockade of ANG II production by an intravenous infusion of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril attenuated the hypotension-induced water intake similarly in rats fed standard and high-salt diet.
[u'whey']Pea and whey protein were fermented by Lactobacillus helveticus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae in monoculture and in combination at 28 and 37 degrees C in order to release angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides.
[u'whey']After fermentation, the ACE inhibitory activity (%) increased by 18 to 30% for all treatments, except for the fermentations of whey protein with Saccharomyces cerevisiae at 28 degrees C, where no significant change was observed.
[u'whey']The whey digests tended to have lower (50%) inhibitory concentrations (IC50; 0.14 to 0.07 mg/ml), hence, higher ACE inhibitory activity, than the pea digests (0.23 to 0.11 mg/ml).
[u'whey']The nonfermented whey protein digest showed the highest ACE inhibitory activity of all.
[u'salt']Commercial ACE could be adsorbed only by EAH-coupled GSH gels and eluted off the gels by increasing salt concentrations.
[u'water']SHR received, from the age of 4 wk, one of the two ACEI (lisinopril or zofenopril, 10 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) or for comparison, the selective AT(1) antagonist (losartan, 20 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) in their drinking water for a period of 4, 12, and 20 wk.
[u'eggs']Both ACE inhibitors reduced the size of the batch of eggs laid by females in a dose-dependent manner, with no observable effects on the behaviour of the adult insect.
[u'wakame']Wakame (Undaria pinnatifida) was hydrolyzed using 17 kinds of proteases and the inhibitory activity of the hydrolysates for ACE was measured.
[u'wakame']The angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antihypertensive activities of wakame hydrolysates have been investigated in several studies.
[u'wakame']The hydrolysates derived from wakame by protease S 'Amano' have a powerful ACE-inhibitory activity (IC(50) = 86 microg protein/ml) and were effective in spite of their slight bitterness as 'physiologically functional food' with antihypertensive activity.
[u'cocktail']As sperm membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme and neutral metalloendopeptidase are mainly involved in Bk hydrolysis, an effective cocktail of enzyme inhibitors promoting the sperm motility consists of phosphoramidon and lisinopril (both at 10-7 m).
[u'water']To investigate the effects of angiotensin II on endothelin and its receptors in the kidney, mice were subjected to UUO and treated with or without enalapril, an orally active angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, in their drinking water (100 mg/l).
[u'water', u'water']The ingestion of 0.3 M NaCl and water was induced by treatment with the diuretic furosemide (10 mg/kg of body weight)+the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (5 mg/kg) injected subcutaneously 1 h before the access of rats to water and 0.3 M NaCl.
[u'gelatin', u'alaska pollock']Angiotensin I that converts the enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptide, Gly-Pro-Leu, previously purified and identified from the Alaskan pollack skin gelatin hydrolysate, were synthesized.
[u'shortening']In 11 patients with chronic heart failure treated with an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker, who have had severe left ventricular dysfunction or high plasma level of natriuretic peptides, left ventricular dimension, and fractional shortening, plasma atrial and brain natriuretic peptide (ANP and BNP) levels were determined before and 3 months after the change of treatment.
[u'salt']Several therapeutic measures (that is, adequate blood pressure control, early introduction of ACEI/ARA, dietary protein restriction, low salt diets, weight loss in overweight patients, addition of a diuretic, increasing ACEI/ARA dose titrated against proteinuria levels, combined therapy ACEI plus ARA, addition of drugs with antiproteinuric effect such as non-dihydropiridine calcium channel blockers or NSAIDs) may increase the proteinuria reduction induced by ACEI and ARA.
[u'wakame']Seven kinds of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides were isolated from the hydrolysates of wakame (Undaria pinnatifida) by Protease S "Amano" (from Bacillus stearothermophilus) by using three-step high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a reverse-phase column.
[u'casein']The commercial bovine serum albumin and casein (bovine milk) showed less ACE inhibitory activity.
[u'salt']Furthermore, CsA blunted the increase of renocortical COX-2 expression in response to low salt intake or a combination of low-salt diet with the ACE inhibitor ramipril (10 mg/kg per day), which strongly stimulates renocortical COX-2 expression.
[u'salt']Moreover, our data suggest that the stimulation of the renin system by low salt and by ACE inhibitors is not essentially mediated by COX-2 activity.
[u'water']Vasopeptidase inhibitors (VPIs), by simultaneously inhibiting ACE and NEP, reduce vasocontriction and enhance vasodilation; thus, they improve local blood flow, and improve sodium and water excretion.
[u'rabbit']We investigated the effects of a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, pravastatin, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, temocaprilat, and an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist, CV-11974, on myocardial metabolism during ischemia in isolated rabbit hearts using phosphorus 31-nuclear magnetic resonance (31P-NMR) imaging.
[u'water']Acetazolamide (Ace) is a putative inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase (CA), an enzyme that catalyzes the equilibration of carbon dioxide and carbonic acid and plays a key role in HCO(3)(-) and water reabsorption and acid secretion.
[u'water']The present findings suggest that the reduction of rat sperm motility and count by Ace can be attributed to its capacity to downregulate AQP1 water channel gene expression.
[u'water']We investigated the effects of water extracts of danshen on the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activities, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and hormone levels in the plasma of 2K1C rats.
[u'water']Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are commonly administered when hypertension is present to decrease plasma concentrations of angiotensin II and aldosterone, which cause vasoconstriction and sodium and water retention, respectively.
[u'salt']Blood pressure was manipulated with aggressive antihypertensive treatment combining low dietary salt and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril.
[u'date']The available data to date indicate that ACE inhibitors, methyldopa, beta-blockers with high protein binding, and some calcium channel blockers all appear to be safe treatments of hypertension in a nursing mother.
[u'water']In CHF, blockade of vasopressin V(1a) and V(2) receptors was associated with increased water excretion, and the combination of conivaptan with ACE inhibition was the only treatment to reduce blood pressure, natriuretic peptide and pulmonary congestion.
[u'tartary buckwheat']The latent production of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors from tartary buckwheat (BW) was investigated, and the peptides responsible for ACE inhibition characterized.
[u'salt']However, beta-adrenoreceptor activity or renal nerve activity appears to be required for the full stimulation of nNOS expression by low salt intake or combined with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.
[u'rabbit']By this spectrophotometric method, ACE inhibition is measured using the substrate furanacryloyl-Phe-Gly-Gly and as ACE source rabbit lung acetone extract.
[u'whey']Furthermore, pea and whey protein hydrolysates obtained by digestion with trypsin showed ACE inhibitory activity in the ACE inhibition assay.
[u'date']Although ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers may differ theoretically in their renal effects, published information to date has not shown such a difference.
[u'water']Diabetes was induced in 16 rats by administrating streptozocin; 8 of the diabetic rats were allocated at random to receive the ACE inhibitor perindopril (2 mg/l) in their drinking water and 8 age and weight matched rats served as controls.
[u'salt']The hypotensive effect of calcium channel blockers is less dependent on salt intake than other drugs, such as ACE inhibitors or diuretics.
[u'shrimp']Sardine autolysate and cod head hydrolysate powder (50 microg) were able to inhibit near 30% of ACE activity, whereas 50 microg of shrimp hydrolysate allows the inhibition of 57% of ACE activity.
[u'rabbit']The rabbit jugular vein (rbJV) was used as a bioassay system to validate some early and new hypothetical interactions between the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and the B2 receptor, which may be influenced by ACE inhibitors (ACE-I).
[u'rabbit']Enzymatic degradation studies performed in vitro and in vivo revealed that BK and R556 are readily degraded by rabbit ACE whereas [Phe8psi(CH2-NH)Arg9]-BK (R379) is totally resistant.
[u'shortening']We found that (1) compared with C57 mice, eNOS-/- mice that underwent sham surgery had significantly increased systolic blood pressure (P<0.05) and increased LV mass both initially and at 1 to 3 months, although cardiac function and histological findings did not differ between strains; (2) the development of HF and myocardial remodeling were similar after MI in both strains; and (3) ACEi improved cardiac function and remodeling in C57 mice, as evidenced by increased LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and LV shortening fraction (LVSF) and decreased diastolic LV dimension, mass, myocyte cross-sectional area, and interstitial collagen fraction, but these benefits were absent or diminished in eNOS-/- mice (for C57 versus eNOS-/-: increase in LVEF after ACEi, 14.2 +/- 2% versus -4.9 +/- 2.5%, respectively [P<0.001]; increase in LVSF, 8.6 +/- 2.1% versus -7.2 +/- 2.8%, respectively [P<0.01]; and decrease in LV mass, -16.6 +/- 15 versus 73 +/- 23 mm(3), respectively [P<0.01]).
[u'rabbit']In this study, the inhibition time courses of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity after intravenous administration of enalaprilat encapsulated in intact erythrocytes was evaluated and compared with free drug, in a rabbit model.
[u'rabbit']We here examined the effect of the combination of an ACE inhibitor, temocaprilat, an AT1 receptor antagonist, CV-11974 and/or a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, L-NAME, on the myocardial metabolism and contraction during ischemia and reperfusion by using phosphorus 31-nuclear magnetic resonance (31P-NMR) in Langendorff rabbit hearts.
[u'rabbit', u'rabbit']The B(2)-agonists BK, D-Arg-[Hyp(3)]-BK, [Hyp,(3) Tyr(Me)(8)]-BK, [DeltaPhe(5)]-BK, [D-NMF(7)]-BK, and [Phe(8)psi(CH(2)-NH)Arg(9)]-BK were tested for degradation by purified rabbit ACE and for their potency in contracting the endothelium-denuded rabbit jugular vein in the absence and presence of ramiprilat.
[u'salt']In healthy subjects on a high salt diet, the hyperglycemic state produced significant increases in renal plasma flow (RPF) in response to administration of the ACE inhibitor captopril.

[u'water']Male Wistar rats underwent transient aortic perfusion with porcine pancreatic elastase, followed by treatment with one of three ACE inhibitors (captopril [CP], lisinopril [LP], or enalapril [EP]), an angiotensin (AT)1 receptor antagonist (losartan [LOS]), or water alone (9 rats in each group).
[u'casein', u'whey']Numerous casein and whey protein-derived angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides/hydrolysates have been identified.
[u'mustard']Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors had no significant effect on cardiopulmonary exercise function in 14 patients who had undergone a Mustard operation for transposition of the great arteries.
[u'date']No convincing evidence has been published to date to support the use of fish oil, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or tonsillectomy for the treatment of children with IgAN or HSPN.
[u'salt']These results indicate that high salt intake increases blood pressure, ACE expression and activity in the hypothalamus and pons of Dahl S rats without a parallel increase in angiotensin II levels.
[u'salt']Effects of high salt intake on ACE mRNA and activity appear to be secondary to activation of brain 'ouabain'.
[u'salt']Dahl S rats showed small but significant increases in ACE mRNA in the hypothalamus on regular salt diet.
[u'salt']In Dahl S rats on high salt diet for 2 or 5 weeks ACE mRNA levels significantly increased in both hypothalamus and pons, compared with Dahl R rats on either diet or Dahl S rats on regular diet.
[u'salt', u'salt']After 5 weeks of high salt diet, ACE mRNA levels in the hypothalamus in Dahl S rats were almost three-fold higher and in the pons two-fold higher than in Dahl R rats on either diet or Dahl S on regular salt diet.
[u'salt', u'salt']High salt diet also increased ACE activity of the hypothalamus and pons in Dahl S but not Dahl R. Consistent with this increased ACE activity, central responses to angiotensin I were clearly enhanced and to bradykinin markedly diminished in Dahl S on high salt intake.
[u'salt']Fab fragments prevented the increases in blood pressure, ACE mRNA and activity in the hypothalamus and pons by high salt intake in Dahl S rats.
[u'salt']In protocol I, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) mRNA and activity and angiotensin I and II levels were assessed in the hypothalamus and pons of Dahl salt-sensitive (Dahl S) and salt-resistant (Dahl R) rats on regular (120 micromol Na+ per g) or high (1370 micromol Na+ per g) salt diet from 4-6 weeks or 4-9 weeks of age.
[u'salt']In protocol II, ACE mRNA and activity were assessed in the hypothalamus and pons in Dahl S on regular or high salt treated with intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.)
[u'salt']Fab fragments blocking brain 'ouabain' or gamma-globulins, and in Dahl R on high or regular salt ACE mRNA was assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay and angiotensin I and II by radioimmunoassay after high-performance liquid chromatography.
[u'salt']Therapy of acute exacerbations of congestive heart failure associated with obesity cardiomyopathy consists of dietary salt restriction, inspired oxygen, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or, if left ventricular systolic dysfunction is present, hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate.
[u'water']Furthermore, the basis of current therapies in these disorders is discussed, including beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, aldosterone antagonists, and diuretics in CHF and cirrhosis, as well as new approaches to treatment of water retention with vasopressin V(2) receptor antagonists.
[u'salt']For this purpose, studied were the effects of blocking macula densa salt transport by the loop diuretic bumetanide (100 microM) on renal perfusate flow and on renin secretion in isolated perfused rats, in which renocortical COX-2 expression was prestimulated in vivo by treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril, with low-salt diet, or with a combination of both.
[u'water']To clarify the relative importance of the presence of the thiol group in the molecule versus angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory properties in the antithrombotic action of captopril, rats were treated with captopril (5 mg/kg twice daily; CAP), epicaptopril (stereoisomer of captopril devoid of ACE-inhibitory properties; 5 mg/kg twice daily; EPI), N-acetylcysteine (3.75 mg/kg twice daily; ACC), enalapril (3 mg/kg once daily; ENA), or distilled water (VEH) for 10 days, per os.
[u'salt']This large multicenter study, tested the antihypertensive effects of isradipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker and enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, in salt-sensitive hypertensive patients under low and high salt intake diets.
[u'salt']To elucidate the relationship between the renin-angiotensin system and ET-1 in hypertensive heart failure, we evaluated the effects of long-term treatment with imidapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on preproET-1, endothelin A receptor (ETAR), and ACE mRNA expression in the left ventricle and evaluated these in relation to myocardial remodeling in the failing heart of Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) hypertensive rats fed a high salt diet.
[u'shortening']ACE inhibition blunted the negative effect of BK on myocyte velocity of shortening by over 60% (P <.05).
[u'salt']The rationale for delaying ACE inhibitor therapy is due in part to a perceived unique pathobiology in hypertensive African Americans: an excess prevalence of salt sensitivity, hypervolemia, and low plasma renin activity (PRA).
[u'rabbit']The effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, temocaprilat and/or angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist, CV-11974 on myocardial metabolism and contraction during ischemia and reperfusion was examined by phosphorus 31-nuclear magnetic resonance (31P-NMR) in Langendorff rabbit hearts.
[u'wheat']We report here the antihypertensive effect of wheat germ (WG) hydrolysate and its dominant peptide, Ile-Val-Tyr (IVY), with potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity.
[u'salt']Higher daily doses, dietary salt restriction, and concomitant diuretic or ACE inhibitor administration amplify the antihypertensive effect of ARBs.
[u'water']In this trial the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor were quantified in sheep on restricted water intake.
[u'water', u'water']Comparing the phase of water restriction only with that of water restriction plus ACE inhibition, significant increases were observed during the latter phase in urine volume, sodium and potassium excretion via the urine, sodium concentration in the plasma and osmolar clearance.
[u'rabbit']The results indicate that renin inhibition in the rabbit with a high circulating AngII level is more effective in lowering BP than ACE inhibition.
[u'salt']The in vitro and in vivo inhibitory potency of omapatrilat and the specific ACE inhibitor fosinopril toward the 2 active sites of ACE (called N- and C-domains) was investigated with the use of 3 substrates: angiotensin I, which is equally cleaved by the 2 ACE domains; hippuryl-histidyl-leucine, specific synthetic substrate of the C-domain in high- salt conditions; and a newly synthesized specific substrate of the N-domain designed by acetylating the lysine residue of AcSDKP.
[u'salt']During a 3-year period, patients received nonpharmacological treatment consisting of moderate salt restriction and a low-calorie diet they were obese, with or without a regimen of antihypertensive drugs based on beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors.
[u'shortening']Oral activity, achieved by shortening the original peptide structures, transformed the probes into therapeutic agents, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.
[u'rabbit']The effect of an endothelin (ET) A/ETB receptor antagonist, TAK-044, and/or an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, temocaprilat, on myocardial metabolism and contraction during ischemia and reperfusion was examined by phosphorus 31-nuclear magnetic resonance (31P-NMR) in Langendorff rabbit hearts.
[u'salt']These data suggest that clinical, genetic, or environmental factors (such as salt intake and medications) that alter ACE activity and Ang II production would be expected to impact on clotting and fibrinolytic mechanisms.
[u'whey']Whey protein digests gave a 50% inhibition (IC50) of ACE activity at concentration ranges within 345-1733 micrograms/ml.
[u'water']This study determined whether chronic treatment with S21402 produced different effects on sodium and water excretion, hormonal parameters, and cardiovascular structure compared with selective inhibition of ACE and NEP in a rat model of myocardial infarction-induced congestive heart failure (CHF).
[u'rabbit']It had an estimated molecular weight of 180 000 and was recognized by the anti-ACE antibody for the rabbit testicular ACE in immunoblots.
[u'water']Myocardial blood flow was analyzed in ischemic and nonischemic regions of 10 symptomatic patients with coronary artery disease using repetitive [15O] water positron emission tomography at rest and during maximal dobutamine stress before and after ACE inhibition with quinaprilat 10 mg i.v.
[u'water']Therefore, submaximal ACE inhibition enhanced sodium excretion mainly by increasing RBF and GFR, whereas submaximal AT1 receptor blockade decreased tubular sodium and water reabsorption.
[u'wheat']Reported is the preparation of wheat germ (WG) hydrolyzate with potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity, and the characterization of peptides responsible for ACE inhibition.
[u'salt']In the present study, we tested for endosomal ANG I, ANG II, angiotensin type 1A receptor (AT(1A)), and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity and determined whether these levels are regulated by salt intake.
[u'shortening', u'shortening']We assessed the prevalence and predictors of patients with IDC that showed marked reverse remodeling (a decrease in LV end-diastolic dimension > or = 5 mm to a final LV end-diastolic dimension < or = 55 mm and an increase in percent LV fractional shortening > or = 5% to a final percent fractional shortening of > or = 25% and a decrease in LV mass > or = 10%) after 2 years of intensive therapy with ACE inhibitors and/or beta blockers.
[u'water']In the third series of novel experiments, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril was given in drinking water for 7 days (0.3 mg. kg(-1) x day(-1)), either alone (n=6) or combined with an intravenous infusion of A-779 (24 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1) for 7 days, n=8).
[u'rabbit']Uptake of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril by rabbit small intestinal brush border membrane vesicles was examined.
[u'rabbit']The inhibitory effects of five angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on the uptake of an aminocephalosporin antibiotic, cefroxadine, by rabbit small intestinal brush-border membrane vesicles were examined in the presence of an inward H+ gradient.
[u'corn']We investigated the relationship between angiotensin II formation and the development of atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta of monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) fed a high-cholesterol (4% cholesterol and 6% corn oil) diet for 6 months, and studied the effects of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, trandolapril (10 mg kg-1 per day, p.o.
[u'salt', u'salt']We report two cases of hyperkalaemia related to the use of the salt substitute 'Lo Salt' in hypertensive patients on treatment with ACE inhibitors.
[u'salt']Without vigilance the contribution of the salt substitute to hyperkalaemia would have been overlooked and an ACE inhibitor erroneously withdrawn.
[u'whey', u'whey']Studies with gastric and pancreatic proteinase digests of whey proteins indicate that enzyme specificity rather than extent of hydrolysis dictates the ACE inhibitory potency of whey hydrolysates.
[u'date']This review aims to give an overview of the research to date assessing the impact of the ACE polymorphism in Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM).
[u'salt']We have previously shown that in renal cortex, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression is localized to the macula densa and surrounding cortical thick ascending limb and increases in high-renin states, such as salt restriction and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.
[u'rabbit']To shed light on mechanisms of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) upregulation, we used a rabbit endothelial cell model to characterize intracellular pathways of beta-adrenergic stimulation.
[u'water']ACE inhibition was obtained with captopril (100 mg/kg/24 h in the drinking water of the breeders) because this compound crosses the placental barrier.
[u'rabbit']ACE inhibition with quinaprilat promotes angiogenesis in a rabbit model of hindlimb ischemia.
[u'salt']In humans, renin inhibition led to a larger increase in renal plasma flow in healthy human volunteers studied on a low salt diet to activate the renin system than did ACE inhibitors.
[u'water']The ACE blocker was dissolved in the drinking water and supplied to 24 and 32 week old SHRSP ad libitum for 5 weeks.
[u'water', u'salt']Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are indicated to counteract the vasoconstriction and salt and water retention associated with activation of the RAS.
[u'whey']Whey protein was digested with one of seven kinds of proteases at 37 degrees C (trypsin, proteinase K, actinase E, thermolysin, or papain) or at 25 degrees C (pepsin or chymotrypsin) for 24 h. The digested samples were assayed for the inhibitory activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme and for changes in the systolic blood pressure caused in spontaneously hypertensive rats after gastric intubation.
[u'water']An angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (fosinopril, 10 mg/kg per day) was added in drinking water and the angiotensin II subtype 1 receptor antagonist losartan (3.5 microg/kg per min) was co-infused via the minipump.
[u'salt']However, it is controversial as to whether kinins oppose the hypertensinogenic effect of deoxycorticosterone acetate plus salt (DOCA-salt) or aortic coarctation and whether they mediate both chronic antihypertensive and cardiac antihypertrophic effects of ACEi in hypertension.
[u'salt']In contrast, the renal vasodilatory responses to ACE inhibition in dogs on low salt intake were markedly dependent on the activation of BK B2 receptors.
[u'rabbit']Moreover, these new B1 antagonists were found to be resistant to in vitro degradation by purified angiotensin-converting enzyme from rabbit lung.
[u'rabbit']The findings indicate that suppression of the renin-angiotensin system by AT1 receptor blockade in a genetically hypercholesterolemic rabbit model causes comparable inhibition of aortic atherosclerosis as that achieved by ACE inhibition, and that a mild reduction of blood pressure induced by both classes of agents may contribute to their antiatherosclerotic action in this model.
[u'shortening']Myocyte shortening velocity increased with ACEI or combination treatment (36.9+/-0.7 v 42.3+/-0.8 microm/s, respectively, P < .05).
[u'water']Rats with and without autoimmune Heymann nephritis were treated with a NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME (50 mg/100 ml) and/or an ACE inhibitor captopril (20 mg/100 ml) in drinking water for 12 weeks.
[u'salt', u'salt', u'salt']Thus, the mean morning PAI-1 antigen concentration was significantly higher during low salt intake than during either high salt intake or low salt intake and concomitant ACE inhibition (22.7+/-4.6 versus 16.
[u'rabbit']Studies were performed in rabbit renal brush border membrane vesicles in which the uptake of [14C]glycylsarcosine (GlySar), at low substrate concentrations, was examined in the absence and presence of quinapril (and other ACE inhibitors).
[u'water']The intake of 0.3 M NaCl and water was induced by combined administration of the diuretic, furosemide (FURO), and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril (CAP).
[u'salt']It has been suggested that combined inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) may lower blood pressure more effectively than either treatment alone, independent of the degree of salt and volume status or the activity of the renin-angiotensin system.
[u'rabbit']In a rabbit model of atherosclerosis, we evaluated the effect of the ACE inhibitor quinapril on different parameters implicated in the pathogenesis of the plaque, such as the presence of chemokines (interleukin-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), collagen I, and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation (PDGF-B).
[u'water', u'salt', u'salt']The ACE inhibitor restores the renal-adrenal response to salt loading, whereas the calcium antagonist possesses intrinsic natriuretic properties through poorly described mechanisms of inhibiting renal tubular salt and water reabsorption.
[u'water']The physiological state associated with water and sodium ingestion was produced by the concurrent subcutaneous administration of the diuretic furosemide (10 mg/kg) and a low dose of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (5 mg/kg; Furo/Cap treatment).
[u'rabbit']A biochemical study was performed in order to analyse the effect of the NO-donors, SIN-1 and diethylamine/NO (DEA/NO), and of an aqueous solution of nitric oxide on the ACE activity in plasma from 3-month old male Sprague-Dawley rats and on ACE purified from rabbit lung.
[u'salt']Moreover, diazonium salt of sulfanilic acid (DASA), a membrane-impermeable ACE inhibitor, inhibited ACE activity in intact cells and in cell lysates at the same extent, thus implying that intracellular ACE is inactive.
[u'salt']We compared the antihypertensive effect of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril 5 or 20 mg BID) or a calcium channel antagonist (isradipine 5 or 10 mg BID) during alternating periods of high and low salt intake.
[u'water']In a group of animals given the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (Enal; 100 mg/L) in their drinking water for 4 wk, beginning 1 wk before BEA injection, creatinine clearance improved significantly (BEA 0.33 versus Enal + BEA 0.52 ml/min per 100 g body wt, P = 0.01) and albumin excretion fell to zero.
[u'rabbit']Species- and/or age-related differences in the kinin-metabolism could explain these results, suggesting that in the newborn rabbit other kininases than ACE are mainly responsible for the degradation of bradykinin.
[u'water']angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalaprilat in 10 critically ill patients, being ventilated with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), on sodium and water excretion was investigated.
[u'salt']1 In spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) we examined over a 4-week period the influence of control low sodium diet, common salt-enriched diet (sodium chloride 6% of the dry weight of the chow) and a novel mineral salt-enriched diet (potassium-, magnesium-, and l-lysine-enriched mineral salt added at a 75% higher level of 10.5% to produce the same sodium chloride concentration of 6%) on the cardiovascular effects produced by a low-dose combination of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril (0.25 mg kg(-1) day(-1) in the food) and a calcium channel blocker felodipine (0.4 mg kg(-1) day(-1) subcutaneously via an osmotic minipump).
[u'rabbit']The relative importance of ACE in the cardiac metabolism of BK was species related: dog (68.4 +/- 3.2%) = human (72.2 +/- 2.0%) > rabbit (47.7 +/- 5.0%) = rat (45.3 +/- 3.9%).
[u'rabbit']ACE participation in the metabolism of des-Arg9-BK was as follows: rabbit (57.0 +/- 4.0%) > dog (39.9 +/- 8.8%) = human (25.4 +/- 5.5%) = rat (36.0 +/- 7.0%).
[u'water']Very high ACE activity was found in ovary of water frog (Rana esculenta) compared with other frog tissues, and this activity was inhibited by the typical ACE inhibitors, captopril and lisinopril.
[u'water']Maximum TGF responses were 8.9 +/- 1.0 and 17.5 +/- 1.5 mmHg in 11- and 26-week-old rats that had been treated with the ACE-i lisinopril in the drinking water started when the animals were 7 weeks of age.
[u'shortening']Multiple regression analysis was performed to select independent variables associated with SDNN from the following 14 variables: age, sex, body mass index before hemodialysis, presence of ischemic heart disease, diabetic nephropathy as primary renal disease, smoking, duration of hemodialysis, mean blood pressure before hemodialysis, left ventricular mass index and fraction shortening in echocardiography, use of beta blockers, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, hematocrit, and blood urea nitrogen.
[u'salt']Experimentally it can be shown that inhibiting ACE but preventing the fall in systemic blood pressure by salt loading abolishes renoprotection.
[u'water']Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition attenuates the effects of atrial natriuretic factor on renal sodium and water handling; however, it is not known whether this effect is mediated by the accompanied decrease in blood pressure or by suppression of the renin-angiotensin system.
[u'water']of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril and 6 were given water with 30 mg./kg.
[u'rabbit']Two series of analogues of the tetrapeptide NAcSDKP, an inhibitor of hematopoietic stem cell proliferation, were prepared, and their enzymatic stability toward rabbit lung angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was evaluated as well as their capacity to inhibit NAcSDKP hydrolysis by this enzyme.
[u'rabbit']We compared the IC50 values of this compound with those of several chymotrypsin-like serine proteinases (bovine alpha-chymotrypsin, recombinant human chymase and human neutrophil cathepsin G) and a metallo proteinase, rabbit angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE).
[u'rabbit']However, rabbit ACE was not inhibited by this compound (IC50 > 1 x 10(-4) M).
[u'salt', u'salt']Our findings indicate that: (1) NIDDM with hypertension is associated with reduced RPF when dietary salt intake is high, (2) reduced Ang II formation is the dominant mechanism of ACEI-induced renal vasodilation in hypertensives with NIDDM; and (3) the sustained renal hemodynamic responses to ACE inhibition despite high-salt balance, and the increased PRA suggest an autonomous renin-angiotensin system suppressed subnormally by a high salt diet in patients with NIDDM despite greater volume expansion.
[u'rabbit']We have investigated whether this is a specific effect of the ACE inhibitor class of compounds in isolated endothelium-denuded segments of the rabbit jugular vein where bradykinin elicits a constrictor response which is exclusively mediated by activation of the B2 receptor.
[u'rabbit']Ramiprilat did not alter the binding of [3H]-bradykinin to a membrane fraction prepared from endothelium-denuded rabbit jugular veins or to cultured fibroblasts, and there was no ACE inhibitor-sensitive, bradykinin-induced cleavage of the B2 receptor in cultured endothelial cells.
[u'shortening']Myocyte shortening velocity increased with ACEI or combination treatment compared with rapid pacing only (36.9+/-0.7 and 42.3+/-0.8 microm/s, respectively, P<.05).
[u'water']In these rats, PD 155080 reduced BP during 5 treatment days, and this antihypertensive effect was not altered by coadministration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril in the drinking water (508 micromol/L [250 mg/L]).
[u'rabbit']We investigated the possible effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor cilazapril and angiotensin II antagonist saralasin on ovulation, ovarian steroidogenesis and ascites formation in the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in the rabbit model.
[u'water']Young (approximately 1 month old) male normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (n=26) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (n=38) were randomized into three groups treated via drinking water for approximately 2 years with, respectively, placebo, low doses, or high doses of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril (10 microg x kg[-1] x d[-1], non-blood pressure-lowering dose, or 1 mg x kg[-1] x d[-1], blood pressure-lowering dose).
[u'buffalo']HieACE, a soluble 70 kDa protein related to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has recently been identified, characterized and cloned from the adult buffalo fly (Haematobia irritans exigua).
[u'rabbit']Effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, captopril, enalapril maleate and quinapril, on the uptake of aminocephalosporin antibiotic, cefroxadine, by rabbit small intestinal brush border membrane vesicles were examined.
[u'water']An angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor was administered in the drinking water for 6 weeks (spirapril 5 mg/kg bw).
[u'date']Although not yet fully published, these results provide the most convincing evidence to date for an effect of an ACE inhibitor in retinopathy.
[u'shortening', u'shortening']Nine pediatric symptomatic patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus with elevated pulmonary arterial pressure (MPA pressure) and ejection fraction (EF); and with fractional shortening, (FS) mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (MVCfc) and left ventricular peak systolic wall stress (PS) were prospectively evaluated using 2-dimensional and M-mode serial echocardiography and Doppler cardiography after administration of an ACE inhibitor (Inhibace 0.025 mg/kg/D orally) for 12 weeks.
[u'shortening']We report the effects of acute and chronic (8 weeks) treatment with the ACE inhibitor perindopril (Per, 2-->4 mg daily) or placebo (P) in a double-blind parallel group study of 24 diuretic treated patients (17M; 67 +/- 8 years, 80 +/- 17 kg) with ischaemic cardiomyopathy (fractional shortening, 19 +/- 5%; radionuclide ejection fraction, 31 +/- 3%).
[u'salt']We evaluated the role of the renin-angiotensin system in S.R-Ren and S rats fed a 0.05% salt diet by examining differences between strains in (1) expression of renin in three tissue types, (2) the blood-pressure response to blockade of both angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin II receptors, and (3) pressure natriuresis.
[u'water', u'water']Rats were treated for 1 week with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril (1 mg/kg) via the drinking water, whereas the controls were given water alone.
[u'shortening']However, systolic performance, as assessed by midwall fractional fibre shortening, was significantly improved by ACE inhibitors only.
[u'salt']Measurements were obtained during absence of treatment (control), treatment with dietary salt restriction plus an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (2.5 mg of lisinopril, PO, daily) and treatment with an inhibitor of nitric oxide production (0.1% L-NAME in the drinking water).
[u'rabbit']In vitro, moexiprilat was a potent inhibitor of ACE in guinea pig serum as well as on purified ACE from rabbit lung with IC50 values of 2.6 and 4.9 nmol/l, respectively.
[u'water']In hooded Wistar rats, over 5 days of training in a water maze neither the ACE inhibitor, ceranapril 5 and 50 micrograms/kg/day, nor the ACE inhibitor, ramipril 2 and 10 mg/kg/day, altered the increase in path length produced by administration of scopolamine 0.75 mg/kg/day.
[u'water']When captopril, an ACE inhibitor, was administered intravenously after and during EXP 3174, an additional increase in renal blood flow, by +8%, with no change in glomerular filtration rate was seen which led to an additional decrease in filtration fraction by -5%; additional increases were observed in water and urea but not in sodium and potassium excretion rates.
[u'shortening']To study the cellular mechanism of the effects of long-term ACE inhibition on the modification of the transition to failure in pressure-overload hypertrophy, we measured simultaneous intracellular Ca2+ transients and myocyte shortening in isolated left ventricular myocytes from fosinopril-treated aortic-banded rats (n = 9), untreated aortic-banded rats (n = 9), and normal age-matched control rats (n = 10).
[u'rabbit']We investigated a putative local angiotensin II (AngII) system in the rabbit retina by examining AngII contents in the retina, vitreous humor, and choroid by radioimmunoassays and AngII synthesis in the retina and choroid by detection of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) mRNA.
[u'salt']Moreover, reduction in salt intake has a permissive action on the antiproteinuric responses of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.
[u'rabbit']We also incubated the compounds with purified angiotensin-converting enzyme from rabbit lung to test their resistance to degradation.
[u'shortening', u'shortening', u'shortening']With an ACE inhibitor: in group A, left ventricular dimensions fell at end diastole (P < 0.05) and end systole (P < 0.01) but fractional shortening did not change; long axis total excursion (P < 0.01) and peak rate of shortening (P < 0.05) both increased; IVRT increased (P < 0.001) with the appearance of markedly incoordinate wall motion, minor axis lengthening, and long axis shortening (P < 0.001 for both); A wave amplitude also consistently increased (P < 0.001); finally, transmitral E wave velocity fell and A wave velocity increased.
[u'cocktail']Risk factors for development of ARF despite cocktail administration included the presence of diabetes mellitus and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy.
[u'water']In male Sprague Dawley rats with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and hypertension induced by aortic constriction (AC) and subsequent myocardial infarction (MI) by occlusion of the left coronary artery the effects of ACE inhibition with ramipril (RA 1 mg/kg/day via the drinking water during 6 weeks) on survival as well as cardiac function and metabolism were investigated.
[u'rabbit']In conclusion, our data provide evidence for a greater influence of ACE in rabbit basilar artery than in peripheral vessels.
[u'salt']For this purpose, uninephrectomized rats received DOCA and high salt diet, and when hypertension was installed, they were treated for 5 weeks with either a long-acting calcium antagonist, mibefradil (30 mg/kg/day), an ACE inhibitor, enalapril (3 mg/kg/day), or a mixed ETA and ETB endothelin receptor antagonist, bosentan (100 mg/kg/day).
[u'spread']Earlier and more wide spread use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in Nigerian and Black Africans with chronic heart failure is now clearly indicated.
[u'squid']Autolysis of squid liver and mantle muscle homogenates, and blends of both, each yielded inhibitory activity toward the angiotensin I-converting enzyme.
[u'water', u'salt']To study tissue-specific regulation of the expression of the AT1 receptor in the rat, we altered activity of the renin-angiotensin system by feeding rats a low (0.07% NaCl), normal (0.3% NaCl), or high (7.5% NaCl) salt chow for 14 days; infusing Ang II (200 ng/kg per minute IP) or vehicle for 7 days; and administering an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril, 100 mg/dL in the drinking water) or vehicle for 7 days.
[u'salt']Human plasma renin concentration increased in response to both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with captopril and isoproterenol and decreased after a high salt diet.
[u'water']BACKGROUND: In congestive heart failure with water retention, subtraction of body fluid by ultrafiltration causes greater diuresis and clinical improvement in patients who are angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibited, suggesting an influence of ACE inhibitors on fluid metabolism.
[u'rabbit']Using in vitro transfected cell culture systems, we previously demonstrated that the rabbit testicular isozyme of ACE (ACET), which shares extensive homology with ACEP, is first synthesized as a plasma membrane-anchored ectoprotein and then secreted to the culture medium by cleavage removal of its COOH-terminal membrane-anchored tail.
[u'rabbit']We have now investigated whether this is an effect of the ACE inhibitor class of compounds by studying the bradykinin-induced vasoconstriction in isolated segments of the rabbit jugular vein.
[u'rabbit']These findings demonstrate that ACE inhibitors selectively potentiate the B2 receptor-mediated constrictor response to bradykinin in the rabbit jugular vein, possibly by increasing the affinity of the B2 receptor.
[u'salt']Uninephrectomized rats received DOCA, a high salt diet, and when hypertension was installed, they were treated for 6 weeks with either a long-acting calcium antagonist, mibefradil (30 mg/kg day-1), an ACE inhibitor, enalapril (3 mg/kg day-1), or a mixed ETA-ETB endothelin receptor antagonist, bosentan (100 mg/kg day-1).
[u'salt']We examined the renal protective effect of the combined therapy with calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) against hypertensive renal injury in 5/6 nephrectomized spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) with salt loading, comparing with monotherapy of each drug.
[u'water']Theoretically, administering of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors can enhance sodium and water retention in cirrhotic patients with ascites.
[u'water']Results in this study demonstrate that inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme alone may not improve sodium and water retention in cirrhotic patients with ascites.
[u'date']Thus, the trial results to date do not suggest that nitrates are ineffective for remodeling, but rather that ACE inhibitors can confer added benefit.
[u'water']This study investigated the effects of bilateral injections of serotonergic receptor agonist and antagonist into the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN) on the ingestion of water and 0.3 M NaCl induced by intracerebroventricular angiotensin II (ANG II) or by combined subcutaneous injections of the diuretic furosemide (Furo) and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (Cap).
[u'rabbit']Because recent data suggest that NO may modulate some features of endothelial cells and because endothelial cells are involved in the control of intimal hyperplasia, we investigated the role of NO synthesis in the effect of an ACE inhibitor, perindopril, on neoendothelial dysfunction and intimal hyperplasia in a rabbit model of unilateral iliac balloon injury.
[u'rabbit']Perturbed angular correlation of gamma-rays (PAC) spectroscopy has been used to investigate the angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) of rabbit lung.
[u'shortening']However, ACE inhibition does not enhance ventricular segmental shortening acutely despite improved microvascular endothelial function and augmented postischemic coronary blood flow in this model of ischemia-reperfusion.
[u'salt']This study was designed to ascertain whether salt sensitivity of BP is a determinant of BP and renal vascular responsiveness to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition.
[u'salt']The magnitude of the BP and renal vascular response to ACE inhibition was not influenced by the sensitivity of BP to salt intake.
[u'salt']In a multivariate analysis neither body mass index nor age influenced the BP response to ACE inhibition or the relationships between salt intake and a BP response to ACE inhibition.
[u'salt']We conclude that the factors that influence sensitivity of BP to salt intake do not influence the systemic or renal hemodynamic response to ACE inhibition.
[u'cocktail']A cocktail of bestatin or leuhistin (inhibitors of aminopeptidases), phosphoramidon, and captopril (an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme) protected Met-enkephalin from degradation (recovery > 95%) in caudate-putamen.
[u'rabbit']In vitro, moexiprilat exhibited a higher inhibitory potency than enalaprilat against both plasma ACE and purified ACE from rabbit lung.
[u'water']In conclusion, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition can prevent the otherwise obligatory Na and water retention and systemic MABP increase during a 20% reduction in renal perfusion pressure.
[u'rabbit']We investigated the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors on acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the presence of nitroglycerin tolerance in rings of rabbit thoracic aorta mounted in tissue baths and precontracted with 10(-6) M norepinephrine.
[u'rabbit']The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether use of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril, would prevent the occurrence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in the rabbit model.
[u'rabbit']ACE inhibition resulted in a 40% decrease in the incidence of OHSS in the rabbit model.
[u'casein']Pulmonary and plasma ACE activity were determined in rats of different ages, following in utero exposure to 18 (control) or 9% (deficient) casein diets.
[u'casein']No maternal diet induced changes in pulmonary ACE were noted, but at 4 and 13 weeks of age, plasma ACE activity was increased by 34 and 134%, respectively in 9% casein exposed rats relative to controls (P < 0.001).
[u'water', u'water']Half of the animals of each group drunk plain water while the other half was provided water enriched with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (ENA) at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day.
[u'rabbit']The distribution of angiotensin converting enzyme was examined in the rabbit brain by in vitro autoradiography with the specific radiolabelled inhibitor 125I-351A.
[u'rabbit']Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is more widely distributed in rabbit brain that in rat, human and Macaca fascicularis, and the results suggest ACE has a very general role in the metabolism of neuropeptides.
[u'water']Five-week-old Bio14.6 cardiomyopathic hamsters were treated with the ACE inhibitor captopril (20 mg/kg per day) or the aldosterone antagonist K-canrenoate (20 mg/kg per day) in drinking water for 20 weeks, and the collagen concentration and type I/III ratio at 25 weeks were compared with those in 25-week-old untreated Bio14.6 and normal F1b hamsters.
[u'water']The angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) perindopril (2 mg/kg body weight), the peripheral vasodilator dihydralazine (DHL) (25 mg/kg body weight) or distilled water was given daily from birth to day 14 to neonatal rats.
[u'salt']We compared the response of the oral angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor antagonist (ARA) UP 269-6 with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) enalapril 20 mg or placebo, during salt depletion in normal men.
[u'rabbit']The data suggest that the antiatherosclerotic action of ACE inhibitors in the WHHL rabbit may not be related directly to arterial enzyme inhibition.
[u'rabbit', u'salt']Rabbits were treated with either angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or a low salt diet to modulate endogenous Ang II levels.
[u'water', u'salt']The history of the treatment of heart failure may be divided into three stages, the consequences of different conceptions of the physiopathology of the disease, with diuretics to counteract salt and water retention, vasodilators to improve conditions of cardiac load, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors to limit the effect of neurotumoral and sympathetic activation.
[u'water']We investigated the effects of ramipril, an angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on water intake by male Holtzman rats (250-300 g) with cannulae implanted into the lateral ventricle.
[u'water']Simultaneous administration of the diuretic furosemide (10 mg/kg) and a low dose of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (5 mg/kg) results in short-latency thirst and sodium appetite (i.e., the rapid ingestion of water and NaCl solution).
[u'rabbit']We have identified angiotensin-converting enzyme, neutral endopeptidase-24.11, and aminopeptidase M in a purified glycoprotein fraction of rabbit skeletal muscle membranes.
[u'water', u'water']In all three diet groups, subgroups were formed drinking either tap water or water containing either the ACE inhibitor enalapril (Ena) or the calcium antagonist diltiazem (Dil), or both (Ena + Dil).
[u'salt']The aim of this study was to determine the participation of endogenous bradykinin (BK) in the antihypertensive effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), perindoprilat, in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) on different salt diets.
[u'salt']These harmful effects of salt were blocked by the thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide but not by the ACEI enalapril.
[u'water']To evaluate the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on renal aging, enalapril was administered in the drinking water to three groups of CF1 mice at doses of 20 mg/L (Group A), 10 mg/L (Group B), and 5 mg/L (Group C).
[u'sake', u'sake']Nine peptides to inhibit angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) were isolated from sake and sake lees.
[u'water']Low and high doses of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown either to enhance or suppress, respectively, the water intake of rats induced by acute administration of isoproterenol.
[u'water']The data are discussed in terms of access of ACE inhibitors to the brain, and interactions with structures involved in Ang-related water intake.
[u'salt']This assertion depends partly on an experiment that suppressed salt appetite using an intravenous infusion of a dose of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (captopril, 2.5 mg/h) that supposedly blocked both central and peripheral enzyme (17).
[u'shortening']Enalapril increased LV fractional shortening (FS%) (13.3 +/- 5.6 to 15.4 +/- 5.8, p < 0.05) and decreased the systolic time interval index (0.58 +/- 0.14 to 0.48 +/- 0.15, p < 0.05) concurrent with a significant decrease in angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and in aldosterone, angiotensin-II, and norepinephrine concentrations after 6 weeks.
[u'water']We examined the dose-related effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on circulating and tissue levels of angiotensin and bradykinin peptides by administering perindopril or lisinopril to rats in drinking water for 7 days.
[u'water']Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may act by normalizing electrolyte and water balance, improving vascular endothelial function, and reversing structural changes in peripheral vessels.
[u'water', u'salt']Diuretic resistance was defined as: failure to lose weight and/or inappropriate urinary sodium excretion (50 mmol 24 h-1) despite bed rest for a period of 2-3 days, salt and water restriction, orally and intravenously administered furosemide in a dose of 250 mg day-1, digoxin, and when possible an ACE inhibitor.
[u'water']Separate groups of PAN rats with similar degree of glomerulosclerosis, assessed at 16 weeks after PAN by renal biopsy, were then treated as follows: ACEI [50 mg/liter drinking water (DW), or 200 mg/liter DW], Ang IIRA (20 mg/liter DW, or 80 mg/liter DW) or no treatment, starting after renal biopsy.
[u'sugar']Sugar modifications of ACE were analyzed by testing its sensitivity to specific glycosidases.
[u'salt']In contrast, chronic salt loading or inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme by perindopril significantly increased binding not only to the cortical sites but also to the sites in the inner stripe of the outer medulla.
[u'sugar']Protein restriction, tight control of blood sugar and blood pressure, and specific therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown independently to reduce microalbuminuria and preserve renal function in these patients.
[u'water']Simultaneous administration of the diuretic furosemide (10 mg/kg sc) and a low dose of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (5 mg/kg sc) reduced mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and increased ingestion of water and 0.3 M NaCl within 2 h. Administration of either agent alone did not reduce MAP or cause significant fluid intakes.
[u'salt']For example, DOCA treatment led to increased ACE activity in the heart and the kidney only if the rats were maintained on a high salt intake.
[u'salt']Increased dietary intake of regular salt (sodium chloride) interferes markedly with the therapeutic effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.
[u'rabbit']Mouse epithelial cells transfected with rabbit testicular ACE cDNA, synthesize, glycosylate, and secrete ACE by cleavage processing of its membrane-anchoring carboxyl-terminal region.
[u'date']To summarize, it has been confirmed to date that systemic antihypertensive therapy slows the progression of renal failure of any etiology, and there is initial proof that ACE inhibitors are superior to other antihypertensive agents in this respect.
[u'water']It is suggested that by inhibiting kininase II, ACE inhibitors extend the duration of action of bradykinin and thereby unmask a potent inhibition of alcohol intake mediated by kinins--an effect that is dissociable from the accompanying stimulation of water intake.
[u'salt']To evaluate whether ACE inhibitors and vasodilators have different effects on salt sensitivity of BP in humans, we compared the effect of the ACE inhibitor cilazapril and the vasodilator dihydralazine on the renal function curve in a randomized prospective single blind cross-over study.
[u'salt']The results document that BP reduction after acute ACE inhibition is a function of salt intake, i.e.
[u'rabbit']We directly tested this hypothesis by substituting Tyr-236 with Phe and Lys-154 with Glu in rabbit testicular ACE (ACET) using site-directed mutagenesis of the corresponding cDNA.
[u'rabbit']Western blot analysis of BBECs, tracheal and bronchial mucosal strips utilizing a cross-reacting rabbit anti-mouse ACE antibody, showed a faint 175 kDa band and additional strong 52 kDa and 47 kDa band.
[u'rabbit']In this study, captopril (an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor; ACEI) and MPG, and the non-sulfhydryl compound enalaprilat (also an ACEI) were tested for their ability to protect the isolated perfused rabbit heart against complement-induced injury.
[u'water']Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition reduced the blood pressure of WKY and SHR, and augmented their intake of water and output of urine.
[u'rabbit']It was reported recently that N-1-(R,S)carboxy-3-phenylpropyl-Ala-Ala-Phe-p-carboxyanilide (CPP-A-A-F-pAB), an inhibitor of endopeptidase 3.4.24.15 (E-24.15), also inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) from rabbit lung.
[u'rabbit']We examined the mechanisms whereby phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-activated rabbit peritoneal neutrophils [polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN)] altered endothelial-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity in cultured bovine pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (EC).
[u'salt']When PMN were coincubated with PMA (10 ng/ml) for 4 h in Earle's salt solution, endothelial ACE activity was decreased by 87%.
[u'water']Six control and twenty-five streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were divided into 4 group: Group I consisted of non-diabetic control rats administered a 40% protein diet (n = 6); Group II, diabetic rats administered a 40% protein diet (n = 8); Group III, diabetic rats treated with a 10% protein diet (n = 8), and Group IV, diabetic rats treated together with a 10% protein diet and ad lib, drinking water containing 0.75 mg/l of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) (n = 9).
[u'water']Chronic peripheral treatments with low doses of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, enhance daily intakes of dilute ethanol solutions in rats as they do the intakes of water and saline solutions.
[u'water', u'arepa']The effect of lisinopril, a potent inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), injected into the medial preoptic area (MPOA) on water intake was investigated in male Holtzman rats (200-250 g).
[u'rabbit']To examine the possibility that guinea pig ACE has a superior catalytic efficiency, we purified it to apparent homogeneity and compared it to highly purified forms of ACE from human seminal plasma, rat lungs and rabbit lungs.
[u'rabbit']Second order rate constants (kcat/Km) for guinea pig, human and rabbit forms of ACE on reaction with benzoyl-Phe-Ala-Pro were identical (1.6E-09 M-1 min-1).
[u'sauce', u'soy sauce']The inhibitory activity of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) detected in soy sauce was fractionated into two major fractions of high molecular weight (Hw) and low molecular weight (Lw) by gel filtration chromatography on Bio-gel P-2 after treating with ethanol.
[u'water', u'water']Separate groups of rats were then administered the angiotensin receptor antagonists, A-81988 or losartan (DuP 753), the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, or vehicle (tap water) in their drinking water for 4 weeks.
[u'garlic', u'garlic']Furthermore, a moderate angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibiting action of wild garlic was found in vitro as well as in vivo that could contribute to the cardioprotective and blood pressure lowering action of wild garlic.
[u'water']However, the rate of increase in sodium and water balance was significantly less in the ACEI group.
[u'date']A postmarketing surveillance study in 2273 Canadian office practices provided the largest body of clinical experience to date with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril in the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension.
[u'rabbit']Idrapril, the prototype of a new class of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, competitively inhibited, with nanomolar apparent Ki, the hydrolysis of hippuryl-glycyl-glycine by rabbit lung ACE.
[u'salt']Blockade of ANG II synthesis in the brain and periphery with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril eliminated the thirst and salt appetite.
[u'rabbit', u'coconut']This study investigates the endothelial preservation properties of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, by assessing its ability to restore endothelium-dependent responsiveness in blood vessels from rabbits fed an atherogenic diet (0.25% cholesterol; 3% coconut oil; 12 weeks).
[u'rabbit']Cephradine uptake was inhibited by phenylpropionylproline, a proline derivative, and enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, which do not have an alpha-amino group, as well as dipeptides, tripeptides, and amino-beta-lactam antibiotics in both rat and rabbit vesicles.
[u'salt']Calcium antagonists are more likely to be effective first-line therapy than ACE inhibitors in patients with a high salt intake, in patients with Raynaud's disease, when angina pectoris is present, and in Black patients.
[u'salt']ACE inhibitors are preferred for combination with diuretic agents, and in the presence of congestive heart failure or low salt intake.
[u'water', u'salt']Hence, ACEI cause a decrease in both PR and CO, the latter by preventing salt and water retention by aldosterone, thereby reducing plasma volume and venous return.
[u'rabbit']Idrapril strongly inhibited rat and human plasma ACE and rabbit lung ACE (IC50: 7-12 nM) as well as the pressor response induced by angiotensin I in anesthetized rats (ED50: 63 nmol/kg i.v.).
[u'rabbit']The contractions were blocked by saralasin 10(-6) M, but not by captopril or enalaprilate 10(-5) M. In contrast, contractions produced by AtI in rabbit mesenteric arteries were practically abolished by the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.
[u'water']We conclude that chronic angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition and angiotension II receptor antagonism improved hemodynamic conditions, diminished water retention, reversed cardiac hypertrophy, and restored plasma and tissue ANF to more "normal" levels in rats with moderate high-output heart failure.
[u'water']By inhibiting this potent vasoconstrictor and suppressing its degradation of the powerful vasodilator bradykinin, and by promoting sodium and water excretion, ACE inhibitors contribute to the restoration of normal ventricular function.
[u'salt']These results suggest that lipids may be important in the development of both glomerular disease and hypertension in Dahl S rats and that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition may not affect the course of renal disease in a setting of high salt intake.
[u'sugar']Therapy with ACE inhibitors under long-term treatment (up to 12 months) reduced diastolic blood pressure (-25%) and, both for type I and II diabetics, fasting blood sugar (-14%) and HbA1 (-9%).
[u'sugar']The outcome of this meta-analysis shows that the treatment of diabetic patients with ACE inhibitors not only effectively reduces high blood pressure but also reduces microalbuminuria/proteinuria and, in addition, exhibits an anti-hyperglycemic effect by improving blood sugar levels.
[u'salt']The need-free salt intake of the female rat is not modified by treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril or by the aldosterone receptor antagonist RU-28318.
[u'water']The following experimental drug regimens were used in the rat model of subtotal nephrectomy (sNPX): so-called triple therapy [TRX; a combination of reserpine 5 mg/liter drinking water (DW), hydralazine 80 mg/liter DW and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/liter DW], or ACEI (either captopril, CPL, 600 mg/liter DW, enalapril, ENL, 400 mg/liter DW or lisinopril, LSL, 200 mg/liter DW), or a novel Ang II receptor antagonist (Ang IIR, L-158,809, 20 mg/liter DW).
[u'salt']Single doses of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor quinapril were administered to salt replete normotensive men to investigate pharmacokinetics and dose responses.
[u'rabbit']We conclude that both the SH-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril and the non-SH-containing ramiprilat, as well as iloprost, a stable analog of prostacyclin, can protect rabbit aortic endothelium against damage due to oxygen free radicals.
[u'water', u'water']Three-month-old SHRSPs received untreated drinking water or drinking water containing cilazapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, or hydralazine and hydrochlorothiazide.
[u'water']Expected pharmacologic effects of an ACE inhibitor were observed at all doses and included increased urine output, increased water consumption, decreased serum aldosterone (65 or 25% of control at 10 or 400 mg/kg, respectively, on day 28), increased plasma renin activity (PRA, up to two- to threefold higher than controls at day 28), and hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus.
[u'rabbit']Alignment of ACE sequences from bovine, human, mouse, and rabbit reveals that during evolution both domains have been highly conserved.
[u'rabbit']Lisinopril is a potent competitive inhibitor of purified rabbit lung ACE (dissociation t1/2 = 105 min).
[u'rabbit']Thus, rapid as well as slowly reversible components of inhibition of ACE inhibitor binding can be demonstrated in the perfused rabbit lung.
[u'water']Cows that were normally hydrated or deprived of water were given intravenous or intracerebroventricular (icv) infusions of angiotensin I converting-enzyme inhibitors (CEI) or angiotensin II antagonists.
[u'water']The excretions of urinary sodium, potassium, magnesium, urate, and water after dosing with diuretics or the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril are reported, as well as the results of other recent studies.
[u'garlic', u'garlic']Extracts of wild garlic (Allium ursinum) and garlic (A. sativum) with defined chemical compositions were investigated for their in vitro inhibitory potential on 5-lipoxygenase (LO), cyclooxygenase (CO), thrombocyte aggregation (TA), and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE).
[u'water', u'garlic', u'garlic']In the ACE test the water extract of the leaves of wild garlic containing glutamyl-peptides showed the highest inhibitory activity followed by that of the garlic leaf and the bulbs of both drugs.
[u'rabbit']We have investigated the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on intracellular Ca2+ levels in human cultured endothelial cells and on endothelial autacoid formation in endothelium-intact bovine coronary arteries and in isolated perfused rabbit and rat hearts.
[u'rabbit']Although these findings suggest that endothelium-derived bradykinin is not involved in the control of resting vascular tone in the coronary microcirculation of the rabbit and the rat, there appears to be significant ACE activity to modulate bradykinin-induced endothelial autacoid formation.
[u'rabbit']In the isolated rabbit thoracic aorta the ACE inhibitor ramiprilat attenuated bradykinin degradation by enzymes localized on vascular endothelial cells as well as on vascular smooth muscle cells by 26% and 32%, respectively.
[u'rabbit']In ischemia-reperfusion rabbit hearts, no significant influence of the ACE inhibitors, captopril and ramiprilat, were observed.
[u'rabbit']Species differences may be responsible for the beneficial role of ACE inhibitors in the limitation of infarct size in the dog hearts, possessing collateral flow, that are not seen in the rabbit heart with poor collateral flow.
[u'water']A kinin induced increase in collecting duct PG synthesis may account for the water diuresis seen clinically with ACE inhibitors.
[u'salt']Rational combinations include an ACE inhibitor or a beta-blocker together with moderate salt restriction or a thiazide diuretic or a calcium antagonist.
[u'salt']Effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and calcium channel blockers (CaB) on renal blood flow (RBF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and autoregulation (AR) of RBF were studied on the uninephrectomized spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) under the conditions of high (H) and low (L) salt loading.
[u'water']Captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme, given at a dose of 100 mg/kg ip, significantly decreased water intake in water-deprived rats but not in thermally dehydrated rats.
[u'rabbit']The effects of captopril and of other angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (zofenopril, fosenopril and enalaprilic acid) were tested on the isolated rabbit heart and aorta.
[u'rabbit']Bimane peptides containing nitrated amino acid (1a, b) were shown to be useful fluorogenic substrates for the assay of angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) from rabbit lung, similar to bimane substrate containing tryptophan (3) previously reported.
[u'rabbit']The enzyme was more active on tri- and tetrapeptides than angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) from rabbit lung.

[u'rabbit']Delapril effectively inhibits rabbit lung ACE activity and lowers blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.
[u'salt']The hypotensive effect of ramipril was prevented by a high salt diet, which did not alter the degree of renal angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition.
[u'rabbit']The effects of specific renin inhibitors, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, indomethacin, and prostaglandin I2 analogue on the release of angiotensins from isolated and Krebs-Ringer-perfused rabbit mesenteric arteries were examined.
[u'date']Although to date no prospective study has examined the ability of ACE inhibitors to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertension, several features of these drugs suggest that this may be the case as several effects of ACE inhibitors in hypertension are potentially nephroprotective and cardioprotective.
[u'water']Since angiotensin II (AII) is a powerful elicitor of drinking behavior, we investigated the influence of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, on the amount of water consumed by the STR/N mouse.
[u'rabbit']The peptidase and esterase activities of rabbit pulmonary angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) are rapidly abolished on reaction with 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (Dnp-F).
[u'rabbit']Inactivation of rabbit lung angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (Dnp-F) has been shown to be due primarily to the modification of a tyrosine residue [Bunknning, P., Kleeman, S.G., & Riordan, J.F.
[u'rabbit']Rabbit testicular ACE is also inactivated by Dnp-F.
[u'date']Nevertheless, renin inhibitors reported to date have limited oral bioavailability and short duration of action, and improvements in both will be necessary for them to compete effectively with ACE inhibitors.
[u'rabbit']Potency for inhibiting purified rabbit lung ANG I-converting enzyme (ACE) using a tripeptide substrate with an ANG I-like (hippurylhistidylleucine, HHL) or a BK-like (hippurylphenylalanylarginine, HPA) cleavable dipeptide was determined.
[u'salt', u'salt', u'salt']To investigate the mechanisms by which small changes in plasma levels of atrial natriuretic hormone (ANH) affect aldosterone, 10 normal young men were infused for 2 h with 0.6 pmol/kg.min human [Ser,Tyr28]ANH under 3 study conditions: 1) high salt diet (H), 2) low salt diet (L), and 3) low salt diet plus pretreatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (LE).
[u'salt']To dissociate the effects on the development of diabetic renal injury of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition per se, and a reduction in systemic blood pressure, we have studied the effects of chronic ramapril treatment in streptozotocin diabetic spontaneously hypertensive rats, with modulation of the hypotensive effect by a high salt diet.
[u'water']The hypotensive effects of three different angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (captopril, enalapril, and lisinopril) and two angiotensin II (AII) analogues ([Sar1Ile5Ala8]AII and [Sar1Ile5Thr8]AII) were compared in conscious, freely-moving Brattleboro rats after 14 h of water deprivation.
[u'water', u'rabbit']To determine whether chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition induces a decrease in proximal tubular angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, urine and blood samples were collected in conscious New Zealand rabbits before and after 16 days administration in drinking water of low doses of captopril (2.6 +/- 0.6 mg 24 h-1 kg-1), high doses of captopril (7.6 +/- 0.9 mg 24 h-1 kg-1) or no captopril (controls).
[u'water']The present data suggest that brain ACE is more involved in compound 48/80-induced water intake than peripheral systemic ACE.

[u'casein']Bovine milk casein hydrolysate inhibited the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity.
[u'salt']The acute effects of intravenous frusemide (30 mg) on prostaglandin dependent renal haemodynamics, urinary prostaglandin excretion, urinary dopamine excretion and electrolyte excretion were studied in six salt replete healthy volunteers with and without pretreatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ramipril (5 mg) and compared with the effects of ramipril alone in order to clarify the role of the renin-angiotensin system in these responses.
[u'rabbit']The aim of this study was to investigate the tissue distribution of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the pregnant rabbit and its fetus and to assess the effect of Perindopril (PIL) a new ACE inhibitor on maternal and fetal tissue ACE activity.
[u'potato']Mr 140,000 hydrolase activity was inhibited by captopril as reported for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), while that of Mr 70,000 hydrolase activity was inhibited by potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor.
[u'water']These experiments tested whether angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) located within the subfornical organ (SFO) participates in the generation of water intake during peripheral ACE blockade with captopril (CAP).
[u'date']Studies to date indicate that ACE inhibitors exert their beneficial effect by lowering glomerular capillary pressure and that not all patients will benefit from therapy with regard to proteinuria or amelioration of disease progression.
[u'rabbit']SCH 39370 (N-[N-[1-(S)-carboxyl-3-phenylpropyl]-(S)-phenyl-alanyl]-(S)-isoserin e) is a potent and specific inhibitor of neutral metalloendopeptidase (NEP) from rabbit kidney (IC50 = 11.2 +/- 1.9 nM) and is devoid of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory activity at 1 microM.
[u'rabbit']Responses (45Ca++ and contraction) elicited by norepinephrine or by KCl were unaltered by these agents at concentrations of up to 10(-4) M. In addition, they exerted no direct effect on the activity of rabbit angiotensin converting enzyme and rat renin.
[u'salt', u'salt']Renal and hemodynamic effects of diet alone and of single oral doses of the nonsulphydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, benazepril (10 mg), were investigated in eight healthy volunteers under stable conditions of high salt intake (300 mmol NaCl/day) and low salt intake (10 mmol NaCl/day), in a double blind, placebo controlled study.
[u'salt', u'salt']Because of the relative insolubilities of both zofenopril calcium and SQ 26,333, zofenopril potassium salt and SQ 26,703, the arginine salt of the active ACE (angiotensin I converting enzyme) inhibitory moiety of zofenopril, were employed in many of the following studies.
[u'rabbit']In vitro, SQ 26,703 was more potent than captopril as an inhibitor of rabbit lung ACE (IC50 = 8 vs. 23 nM).
[u'rabbit']Tuna AI inhibited rabbit lung ACE non-competitively with Ki values of 1.7 and 5.7 microM with substrates, hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine and angiotensin I, respectively.
[u'water']Animals were randomized to receive either the ACE inhibitor ramipril, 1 mg/L in drinking water (n = 7), or no treatment (n = 7) and were studied for 6 months.
[u'water', u'salt']Short term angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition may induce a transient salt and water retention in patients with hypertension or heart failure.
[u'date']Studies to date using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring techniques suggest that once-daily administration of certain ACE inhibitors is capable of providing this long-term control of blood pressure.
[u'cocktail']Before the infusion, rats were pretreated with vehicle, enalaprilat (an ACE inhibitor), or a cocktail of kininase inhibitors containing 1) enalaprilat, 2) DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethyl-thiopropanoic acid (MGTA), a carboxypeptidase N inhibitor, 3) phosphoramidon, a neutral endopeptidase 24.11 inhibitor, and 4) bestatin, an aminopeptidase B inhibitor.
[u'salt', u'salt']It has been reported that calcium antagonists lower blood pressure more effectively in salt replete hypertensive patients with a low plasma renin activity (PRA), whereas angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are more effective in salt depleted patients with a high level of PRA.
[u'water']In the controls, angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibition by enalapril significantly reduced the urinary output of sodium and water after ANP infusion.
[u'rabbit']Inhibition of rabbit lung angiotensin I-converting enzyme was studied with two inhibitors that combined tricyclic mimics of a substrate C-terminal dipeptide recognition unit with a 4-phenylbutanoic acid fragment.
[u'rabbit']Cilazaprilat has an IC50 of 1.9 nM as an inhibitor of rabbit lung ACE in vitro making it one of the most potent ACE inhibitors currently available.
[u'rabbit']Angiotensin converting enzyme activity was determined in rat lung, heart, aorta, and kidney (cortex and medulla) and in rabbit kidney (cortex, medulla, tubules, and glomeruli).
[u'salt']In a fourway double-blind placebo controlled study, the effects of cilazapril, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on renal function and the responses to intravenous frusemide were studied in a group of twelve salt depleted male volunteers.
[u'rabbit', u'squirrel']Its IC50 values for renin activity in human, squirrel monkey, marmoset, dog, hog, rabbit and rat plasma were 3.3, 6.6, 2.4, 42, 110, 86 and 3500 nM, respectively, and 26 microM for cathepsin D. Pepsin and angiotensin converting enzyme were hardly inhibited at 10(-4) M. BW-175 showed an oral bioavailability of 2.8% at 10 mg/kg and 9.7% at 30 mg/kg in rats.
[u'rabbit']Representatives of this class produce 50% inhibition of purified rabbit lung ACE at concentrations less than 8 nmol/l.
[u'salt']The effects of salt restriction and the ACE inhibitor enalapril were compared in a model of chronic myocardial infarction in the rat.

[u'salt']The effects of cicletanine were compared with those of three other antihypertensive drugs: prazosin, a highly selective alpha 1 antagonist, captopril an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and indapamide a diuretic antihypertensive agent, on young stroke-prone SHR rats with high salt diet; furthermore, vascular reactivity to cicletanine was studied on isolated rat aorta.
[u'salt']The interactions of blood pressure, salt intake and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition were investigated in the Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) and salt-resistant (DR) strains of rats.
[u'salt']Regression of an increased left ventricular mass by ACE inhibition seemed to be impaired by a high salt intake, even when blood pressure was lowered.
[u'rabbit']CV-5975, (R)-3-[(S)-1-carboxy-5-(4-piperidyl)pentyl]amino-4-oxo- 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,5-benzothiazepine-5-acetic acid, was found to inhibit rabbit lung angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity with an IC50 of 3.1 x 10(-9) M and a Ki of 2.6 x 10(-9) M, inhibit the angiotensin I (A-I)-induced contraction of the guinea pig ileum with an IC50 of 1.3 x 10(-8) M, and augment the bradykinin (BK)-induced contraction of the ileum with an AC50 of 9.2 x 10(-10) M. The activity of CV-5975 was comparable to or slightly more potent than that of enalaprilat.
[u'rabbit']Its active form, CS-622 diacid, was slightly more potent than enalaprilat in inhibiting ACE isolated from rabbit lung.
[u'salt']The interaction of blood pressure, salt intake and the inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme activity with cardiac hypertrophy were examined in the Dahl rat model.
[u'water']While a number of circulating peptides are believed to modulate food intake, it is not known if ACE plays a role in the control of feeding behaviour and therefore in this study we have examined the effect of the potent, specific ACE antagonists captopril (SQ 14225) and enalapril (MK421) on food and water intake following food deprivation and 2-deoxyglucose treatment in the rat.
[u'pulses', u'salt']The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors is characterized by some particularly favorable features: ACE inhibitors attenuate the fall in serum potassium and the rise in plasma uric acid induced by diuretics, they do not cause any salt retention nor orthostatic hypotension, they do not raise pulse rate when they reduce blood pressure, and they certainly do not reduce the perfusion rate of the brain, the heart or the kidneys.
[u'water']This angiotensin II-induced intake of water was markedly inhibited by [Sar1, Ile8]-angiotensin II, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, but not by captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, previously administered through the same cannula.

[u'salt', u'salt', u'salt', u'salt']Tissue and plasma ACE from Sprague Dawley rats was studied over a wide range of sodium intakes (low salt, 0.026 +/- 0.012 mmol/24 h; normal salt, 0.58 +/- 0.09 mmol/24 h; and high salt, 10.4 +/- 1.3 mmol/24 h) and during high salt and DOCA treatment.
