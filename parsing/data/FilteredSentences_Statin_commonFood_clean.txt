[u'rice']18 samples of red yeast rice powder and 18 samples of lovastatin were collected.
[u'rice']: Purpose: Red yeast rice (RYR) supplementation has become a popular alternative to statin therapy in treating hypercholesterolemia.
[u'rice']We examined whether FDA's manufacturing standards led to standard concentrations of the statin monacolin K in red yeast rice supplements.
[u'rice']Red yeast rice contains a fungus (Monascus purpureus), which was utilized in the original production of lovastatin (MEVACOR, Merck & Co, Whitehouse Station, NJ), the first marketed pharmaceutical statin, and is chemically identical to such product.
[u'oyster mushroom', u'rice', u'mushrooms']Matrix effect-free UHPLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the determination of cholesterol-lowering lovastatin in food samples represented by Pu-erh tea, oyster mushroom, and red yeast rice.
[u'rice']Suitability of the resulting MISPE-UHPLC-MS/MS procedure for real sample analysis was verified by the determination of lovastatin in one dietary supplement based on the red yeast rice with a given amount of the target analyte.
[u'gelatin']Analysis of spectra of fluvastatin (Flu), gelatin (Gel), and Flu with Gel complex using a Fourier transform-infrared spectrometer indicates that Flu was bound to Gel through a bond involving the carboxyl and amino groups.
[u'oat']We examined the economic impact of daily intake of unk3 g of oat unk-glucan in primary prevention of CHD in patients receiving statins or no pharmacologic treatment.
[u'oat', u'oat']A decision model was developed to compare costs and outcomes associated with lowering cholesterol levels with no pharmacologic treatment and normal diet, no pharmacologic treatment plus unk3 g/d of oat unk-glucan, and statin therapy plus unk3 g/d of oat unk-glucan.
[u'salt', u'oat']Apolipoprotein-E-deficient mice were fed for 24unkweeks either high-fat/cholesterol diet alone (control, HFC) or high-fat/cholesterol in conjunction with one of three dietary interventions, as follows: plant sterol ester (PSE), oat unk-glucan (OBG) and bile salt hydrolase-active Lactobacillus reuteri APC 2587 (BSH), or the drug atorvastatin (STAT).
[u'salt']Veterans within the Salt Lake City Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center initiating statin therapy from October 2008 to December 2011 were randomized in a pragmatic design to receive either an educational mailer or usual care.
[u'citrus']Herein, we investigated the chemopreventive effects of nobiletin (NBT, a citrus polymethoxyflavone) and atorvastatin (ATST, a lipid-lowering drug) in colon cancer cells/macrophages and an azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colon carcinogenesis rat model.
[u'bean']The ovariectomized groups were administered orally daily with (1) lovastatin 11 mg/kg/day alone; (2) tocotrienol derived from annatto bean (annatto tocotrienol) 60 mg/kg/day alone; (3) lovastatin 11 mg/kg/day, and annatto tocotrienol 60 mg/kg/day.
[u'spread']Patients were randomized into four groups for a 6-week treatment: the control (CT) group remained on the same statin therapy, the ezetimibe (EZ) group received 10unkmg/day of ezetimibe, the plant sterol (PS) group received spread enriched with 2unkg of plant sterols, and the ezetimibe+PS (EZ+PS) group received 10unkmg/day EZ +2unkg PS.
[u'casein']Atorvastatin treatment increased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in casein injection mice.
[u'casein']Moreover, atorvastatin treatment exacerbated hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis, as well as increased hepatic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde in casein injection mice.
[u'olive']Herein, we evaluated the effect of lovastatin and orlistat on polyp development and ER expression in ApcMin/+ mice, in order to confirm previous data obtained with unkunk3-PUFAs and olive oil.
[u'rice']Then, the following lipid-lowering treatments were added in order to improve the ezetimibe low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering efficacy, based on clinical judgment: fenofibrate 145unkmg, rosuvastatin 5unkmg 1 tablet/week, rosuvastatin 5unkmg 2 tablets/week, red yeast rice (standardized in monacolin K 3unkmg) + berberine 500unkmg, berberine 500unkmg b.i.d., phytosterols 900unkmgunk+unkpsyllium fiber 3.5unkg b.i.d.
[u'gelatin']The present study was performed to determine whether simvastatin improves bone regeneration when combined with calcium silicate/gypsum and gelatin (CS-GEL).
[u'rice']A number of small trials show that red yeast rice and simvastatin produce similar lipid-lowering effects.
[u'rice']Overall, red yeast rice and simvastatin did not show any statistically significant difference in any of the outcomes examined.
[u'rice']However, the comparative effectiveness of red yeast rice and simvastatin for the management of dyslipidaemia is unknown.
[u'rice']This review assesses the efficacy and safety of red yeast rice versus simvastatin in dyslipidaemia.
[u'crustaceans']Importantly, chronic simvastatin exposure disrupts crustacean reproduction and development at environmentally relevant concentrations.
[u'wheat']Lovastatin treatment also inhibited the antioxidative capability of wheat seedlings, and tasg1 was more sensitive to lovastatin than WT, as indicated by the MDA content, protein carbonylation, and antioxidant enzyme activity.
[u'olive']Aim of this review is to summarize current evidences supporting the role of nutrients rich in polyphenols, such as olive oil and cocoa, and of some drugs, such as statins as antiplatelet agents interfering with the Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH) Oxidase signaling.
[u'cream']During this study, it was observed that when both emulgel and cream formulations were compared; the emulgels enhanced the delivery of pravastatin more than the creams.
[u'grapefruit', u'pomegranate']The herbal reaction toward different types of statins is varied so that grapefruit or pomegranate was interacted with only some types of statins, but not with all statin types.
[u'fruits', u'grapefruit', u'fruit juice']In humans, major interactions were observed between grapefruit juice and statins that are substrates of P-glycoprotein/CYP3A, but other fruit juices also affect the bioavailability of statins that are not metabolised by CYP.
[u'tea']Uptake of the typical substrates metformin for OCTs and MATEs and bromosulphophthalein (BSP) and atorvastatin for OATPs was measured in the absence and presence of a commercially available green tea and EGCG.
[u'tea']Green tea also inhibited OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated atorvastatin net uptake with IC50 values of 1.9% (v/v) and 1.0% (v/v), respectively.
[u'salt']Statin users had lower blood pressure and reduced salt sensitivity of blood pressure (both P<0.001).
[u'flaxseed', u'flaxseed', u'flaxseed']Cardiac patients (nunk=unk34) between 44 and 80 years old, requiring statin therapy to regulate blood cholesterol levels, were randomly assigned to one of four groups for a 6 week trial: 1) placebo; 2) ezetimibe therapy; 3) a supplement of flaxseed oil (containing 1.0unkg ALA in 2.0unkg of flaxseed oil); or 4) ezetimibe and flaxseed oil supplementation.
[u'olive']Total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels were found to be increased in cholesterol-fed rats, and both doses of olive leaf extract and atorvastatin significantly decreased those levels.
[u'grapefruit']A daily glass of grapefruit juice increases blood levels of simvastatin and lovastatin by about 260% if taken at the same time (about 90% if taken 12 hours apart), and atorvastatin by about 80% (whenever taken).
[u'grapefruit']When simvastatin or lovastatin are taken at the same time as grapefruit juice, the estimated reduction in LDL cholesterol is 48%, and in heart disease is 70%.
[u'grapefruit']The increased rhabdomyolysis risk from grapefruit juice consumption due to the increased effective statin dose is minimal compared with the greater effect in preventing heart disease.
[u'salt']A convergent C1 + C6 route allowed for the assembly of the pitavastatin C7 side chain via a Wittig reaction between phosphonium salt 2 and the enantiomerically pure C6-formyl side chain 3.
[u'gelatin']Simvastatin (ST) was incorporated into the micelles of gelatin grafted with L-lactic acid oligomers (LAo) to allow water-solubilization.
[u'chickpea']A total of 24 female adult Wistar rats were divided into four groups that is, Group I - Control; Group II - Ovariectomized (OVX) rats; Group III - OVX + germinated chickpea sprouts (20% in diet) and Group IV OVX + atorvastatin (1.2 mg/kg b.wt, p.o.).
[u'chickpea']The changes were mild in chickpea group with no improvement in statin group.
[u'spirit']The hypolipidemic effect of statins is realized by inhibition of synthesis of local pool of cholesterol spirit in endoplasmic net of hepatocytes.
[u'spirit', u'spirit', u'spirit']The sequence of effect of statins is as follows: blocking of synthesis in hepatocytes and decreasing of content of unesterified cholesterol spirit in blood plasma; activation of hydrolysis of triglycerides in palmitic and oleic lipoproteins of very low density; formation of ligand lipoproteins of very low density and their absorption by cells by force of apoB-100 endocytosis; decreasing in blood of content of polyenoic fatty acids, equimolar esterified by cholesterol spirit, polyethers of cholesterol spirit and decreasing of level of cholesterol spirit-lipoproteins of very low density.
[u'coconut']To assess these effects, 15-week-old stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSPs) were divided into four groups (n = 6, each): alpha-tocopherol (AT), lovastatin (LoV), alpha-tocopherol + lovastatin (AT + LoV), and control (C).We administered 120 IU of alpha-tocopherol diluted in 0.1 ml of coconut oil,whereas the dose of lovastatin was administered at a ratio of 1 mg/kg of rat body weight.
[u'cinnamon']Cinnamon and statin were held.
[u'cinnamon']A combination of cinnamon supplement and statin can cause hepatitis, and it should be discouraged.
[u'spirit', u'spirit']The effect of statins occur in several stages: 1) inhibition in hepatocytes of synthesis of functionally specific pool of spirit cholesterol, polar mono-layer of lipoproteins of very low density; 2) activation of hydrolysis of triglycerides in lipoproteins of very low density, formation of apoE/B-100-ligand and absorption of lipoproteins of very low density by insulin-depended cells; 3) decreasing of content of and spirit cholesterol-lipoproteins of very low density in blood plasma; 4) activation of hydrolysis of triglycerides in lipoproteins of low density, formation of apoB-100-ligand and absorption of lipoproteins of low density by insulin-independent cells; 5) decreasing of level of and increasing of content of lipoproteins of high density.
[u'spirit']During first weeks of effect of statins occurs decreasing of concentration of triglycerides and unesterified spirit cholesterol-lipoproteins of very low density in blood plasma.
[u'grapefruit', u'pomegranate']This study evaluated the effect of pomegranate juice on the disposition of simvastatin, a CYP3A4 substrate, and simvastatin acid, its active metabolite, compared with grapefruit juice in healthy subjects.
[u'grapefruit', u'pomegranate']A single oral pharmacokinetic study of 40unkmg simvastatin was conducted as a three-way crossover (control, pomegranate, and grapefruit juices) in 12 healthy male subjects.
[u'grapefruit', u'pomegranate']In the period of grapefruit juice, the mean C max and AUCinf of simvastatin [the geometric mean ratio (90unk% CI) 15.6 (11.6-21.0) and 9.1 (6.0-13.7)] were increased significantly when compared with the control period, whereas they were not significantly different in the period of pomegranate juice [C max and AUCinf 1.20 (0.89-1.62) and 1.29 (0.85-1.94)].
[u'grapefruit', u'pomegranate']The mean C max and AUCinf of simvastatin acid were increased significantly after intake of grapefruit juice, but not pomegranate juice.
[u'pomegranate']These results suggest that pomegranate juice affects little on the disposition of simvastatin in humans.
[u'pomegranate']We developed a diagnostic assay based upon color transformations of polydiacetylene, a unique conjugated polymer, upon interactions with blood plasma obtained from healthy individuals, hypercholesterolemic patients, hypercholesterolemic patients treated with statin, and hypercholesterolemic patients treated with statin together with pomegranate extracts.
[u'rice']In patients with known coronary artery disease and dyslipidemia (secondary prevention), therapy with red-yeast rice extract containing naturally-occurring lovastatin is associated with a 30% reduction in coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality and a 60% reduction in myocardial infarction (MI), similar to the effect of statin medications.
[u'spirulina']Inhibition of NADPH oxidase with phycocyanobilin from spirulina, as well as high-dose statin therapy, may have potential for prevention and control of SVD, and high-potassium diets merit study in this regard.
[u'gelatin']In this study, we prepared double-layer vascular patches from Thai silk fibroin/gelatin with gelatin hydrogel incorporating simvastatin-micelles (SM) for sustained release of simvastatin to recruit circulation EPCs.
[u'gelatin']Gelatin hydrogel incorporating SM at 100unkunkM of simvastatin (GSM100) could enhance in vitro EPC activities of adhesion and proliferation.
[u'ginger']Therefore, 10-dehydrogingerdione (DHGD), a novel CETP inhibitor isolated from ginger rhizomes, was selected as a natural product in the present study to illustrate its effect on haemostatic impairment associated with hyperlipidemia as compared to a currently used hypocholesterolemic agent, atorvastatin (ATOR).
[u'sugar', u'cream']Here we characterized the relation of SFRP4 to glucose and triglyceride metabolism and outcomes in patients with stable coronary artery disease on statin treatment in the prospective Homburg Cream & Sugar Study (NCT00628524).
[u'tea']Available data about interactions between green tea and cardiovascular drugs in humans, updated in this review, are limited so far to warfarin, simvastatin and nadolol, and suggest that the average effects are mild to modest.
[u'dripping']To study the effect of compound Danshen dripping pills and atorvastatin on restenosis after abdominal aorta angioplasty in rabbits.
[u'fenugreek']To determine the hypolipidemic effect of fenugreek (Methi) seeds and its comparison with atorvastatin on experimentally induced hyperlipidemia in rabbits.
[u'salt']This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared the effects of three oral regimens administered for 7unkdays, i.e., placebo; aspirin (325unkmg twice daily) and simvastatin (40unkmg twice daily); aspirin, simvastatin, and the sodium salt of R- unk-lipoic acid (NaRLA, 600unkmg three times daily) on markers of HO-1 activation (i.e., plasma HO-1 protein concentration and venous monocyte HO-1 protein activity) in 18 healthy subjects (14 females).
[u'margarine']The simvastatin (80 mg per day) increased content of margarine, tricosanoic and hexacosanoic fatty acids by decrease of level of palmitic fatty acid.
[u'coconut']To enhance the solubility of Atorvastatin and to design the suitable solid self-microemulsifying drug delivery systems (S-SMEDDS) Materials and methods: The clear and transparent self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) were formulated using coconut oil and isopropyl myristate as lipid phases; Tween 80 as surfactant; PEG 400 and glycerin as co-surfactant at 2:1, 3:1, 1:2 and 1:3 ratio.
[u'spread']Rather than preventing occurrence, statins might reduce growth and metastatic spread of melanomas and ultimately improve survival.
[u'banana', u'wheat', u'wheat', u'corn']Seven indigenously isolated fungal strains (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus terreus, Penicillium citrinum, Penicillium notatum, Pleurotus ostreatus and Trichoderma viradae) were tested for their potential to produce cholesterol lowering drug lovastatin by using different agro-industrial wastes (Corn cobs, corn stover, banana stalk, wheat straw, wheat bran, bagasse) in submerged as well as solid state fermentation.
[u'sugar']This led the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to change their labelling requirements for statins to include a warning about the possibility of increased blood sugar and HbA1c levels and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to issue guidance on a small increased risk of T2D with the statin class.
[u'liquor', u'corn']5 % glucose as carbon source, 1.5 % corn steep liquor as nitrogen source, initial pH value of 6, 120 h of incubation period, and 28 unkC of incubation temperature were found as best parameters for higher lovastatin production in shake flasks.
[u'cabbage']The effects of red cabbage were compared to simvastatin (30 mg/kg body weight) treated rats.
[u'pomegranate']To analyze pomegranate extract (POMx) effects on serum and on human HMDM atherogenicity in simvastatin - treated hypercholesterolemic patients.
[u'olive', u'olive']To study, in intact male transgenic mice, the effects of three diets based on olive oil and olive oil diet supplemented with lovastatin and orlistat on hepatic lipogenic enzymes expression, considered markers of cell proliferation.
[u'olive', u'olive', u'olive', u'olive', u'olive', u'olive']Forty Apc(Min/+) mice were randomly divided into 4 groups and fed for 10 wk: olive oil (OO) group, n = 10 animals received a diet with olive oil 12%; olive oil plus lovastatin (LOVA) group, n = 10 animals received the same diet with olive oil supplemented with lovastatin 5 mg/kg; olive oil plus orlistat (OR) group, n = 10 animals fed the diet with olive oil supplemented with orlistat 50 mg/kg and SD group, n = 10 animals fed a standard diet.
[u'pomegranate']Furthermore, the addition of pomegranate juice (or punicalagin, but not beta sitosterol) to simvastatin significantly increased the statin ability to protect the cells from oxidative stress.
[u'pomegranate']The use of statins in combination with pomegranate juice in hypercholesterolemic patients, may allow for the use of lower dosages of statin in order to prevent statin deleterious side effects.
[u'olive']The Mediterranean-style diet, with a focus on vegetables, fruit, fish, whole grains, and olive oil, has proven to reduce cardiovascular events to a degree greater than low-fat diets and equal to or greater than the benefit observed in statin trials.
[u'oyster mushroom', u'mushrooms']Statistical experimental designs were used to optimize lovastatin production by culinary-medicinal oyster mushroom Pleurotus ostreatus OBCC 1031 under submerged fermentation.
[u'salt']HUVECs were stimulated with HGF, statins and farnesylpyrophosphat ammonium salt (FPP) or geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate (GGPP), respectively.
[u'rice']Red yeast rice is an ancient Chinese food product that contains monacolins, chemical substances that are similar to statins in their mechanisms of action and lipid lowering properties.
[u'gelatin']Western blotting and gelatin zymography were used to investigate the expressions and activities of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 in VSMCs in culture medium when induced with homocysteine for 24, 48, and 72 h. Transwell chambers were employed to test the migratory ability of VSMCs when incubated with homocysteine for 48 h. Different concentrations of rosuvastatin (10(-9)-10(-5) mol/L) were added when VSMCs were induced with 1000 unkmol/L homocysteine.
[u'coffee']This study examined nine dichotomous variables including: exercise, history of vasectomy, smoking history, alcohol use, finasteride use, statin use, aspirin use, coffee use, and vitamin use.
[u'rice']This study aimed to determine the lipid-lowering effects of phytosterol tablets and lifestyle change (LC) on top of red yeast rice (RYR) therapy in patients with a history of statin refusal or statin-associated myalgias.
[u'tea']Effects of green tea extract (GTE) on the activity of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and pharmacokinetics of simvastatin (SIM) were investigated in rats.
[u'rice']In this paper, experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that lovastatin secreted by Aspergillus terreus in fermented rice straw extracts (FRSE) can inhibit growth and CH4 production in Methanobrevibacter smithii (a test methanogen).
[u'rice']Experimental confirmation that CH4 production is inhibited by lovastatin in A. terreus-fermented rice straw paves the way for its evaluation as a feed additive for mitigating CH4 production in ruminants.
[u'soy bean', u'bean', u'corn']Male ddY mice aged 7 weeks underwent either a sham operation or orchidectomy (ORX) and were divided into five groups: a sham-operated group fed a control diet (Sham) based on AIN-93G formulation with corn oil instead of soy bean oil, an ORX group fed the control diet (ORX), a group fed the control diet containing 0.5% hesperidin (ORXunk+unkH), a group fed the control diet containing 0.7% unk-glucosylhesperidin (ORXunk+unkunkG), and a group fed the control diet containing 0.013% simvastatin (ORXunk+unkSt).
[u'tea']This paper reports the results of an extensive survey on the levels of lovastatin in Pu-erh tea samples.
[u'tea', u'agar']The microbial source of lovastatin was assessed by testing the ability of fungi with higher isolation frequency in the Pu-erh tea samples to produce lovastatin on Czapek yeast extract agar (CYA).
[u'tea', u'tea']Lovastatin was not detected in any of the raw Pu-erh tea samples without storage but was found in almost all the ripe Pu-erh tea samples, with lovastatin contents ranging from 20.61 ng/gdw to 226.38 ng/gdw.
[u'tea', u'tea']After five years' storage, the lovastatin levels increased obviously in ripe Pu-erh tea samples and 55% of raw Pu-erh tea samples from 2007 were found to contain lovastatin with concentrations ranging between 28.41 ng/gdw and 228.61 ng/gdw.
[u'tea']With increasing storage time, lovastatin concentration in ripe Pu-erh tea, and the occurrence and concentration of lovastatin for raw Pu-erh tea increased significantly.
[u'rice']The primary objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that solid state fermentation (SSF) of agro-biomass (using rice straw as model); besides, breaking down its lignocellulose content to improve its nutritive values also produces lovastatin which could be used to suppress methanogenesis in the rumen ecosystem.
[u'rice']Fermented rice straw (FRS) containing lovastatin after fermentation with Aspergillus terreus was used as substrate for growth study of rumen microorganisms using in vitro gas production method.
[u'red rice', u'rice']Lovastatin is a main component of Monascus purpureus fermented red rice contributing to the lipid-lowering effect.

[u'pomegranate']To assess the anti-atherogenic effects on macrophage cholesterol biosynthesis rate, and on cellular oxidative stress by the combination of simvastatin with a potent polyphenolic antioxidant (punicalagin), or with a phytosterol (unk-sitosterol), or with pomegranate juice (POM, that contains both of them).
[u'pomegranate']The combination of simvastatin with potent antioxidant and phytosterol (such as present in pomegranate) could lead to attenuation of macrophage foam cell formation and atherogenesis.
[u'rice', u'oil palm']Ability of two strains of Aspergillus terreus (ATCC 74135 and ATCC 20542) for production of lovastatin in solid state fermentation (SSF) using rice straw (RS) and oil palm frond (OPF) was investigated.
[u'agar']Synergistic antifungal effects were tested by simultaneously adding a sub inhibitory concentration (SIC) of statin (atorvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin or simvastatin) plus a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of azole (clotrimazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole or miconazole) to yeast-embedded YNB agar plates, and a positive result corresponded to a yeast growth inhibition halo higher than that produced by the MIC of the azole alone.
[u'salt']The present study reports the solid-state properties of Fluvastatin sodium salt crystallized from different solvents for comparison with crystalline forms of the commercially available raw material and United States Pharmacopeia (USP) reference standard.
[u'pie']Adult subjects were randomized to receive identical risk/benefit information regarding taking statins that was presented on an iPad (Apple Corp, Cupertino, Calif) in 1 of 4 different animated formats: text/numbers, pie chart, bar graph, and pictograph.
[u'salt']The aim of the present study was to combine vibrational spectroscopy and chemometrics for investigating excipient-induced disproportionation of the calcium salt of atorvastatin into the corresponding free acid form in environments relevant to manufacturing and storage of solid dosage formulations.
[u'salt', u'cold cut']A tougher approach from Government to mandating limits on salt in processed foods and reducing excessive statin prices, and a shift away from lifestyle counselling to more efficient absolute risk-based prescription of preventive drugs, could cut health care costs while improving population health.
[u'salt']Similar effects were seen with lovastatin, but not pravastatin or the sodium salt of simvastatin.
[u'sugar']Intensive statin therapy is more effective and safe compared to intensive control of blood sugar or blood pressure in patients with diabetes.
[u'salt']Atorvastatin exerts beneficial effects on renal function, injury, and salt sensitivity in rats with a reduced renal mass on an NNaD.
[u'spread']Discontinuation of statin therapy in cancer patients was associated with regionalised and distant disease spread at diagnosis (p<0.001), older age (p=0.006), upper gastrointestinal organs and liver cancer (aHR 2.95, 95% CI 1.92 to 4.53) and cancer of the lung, bronchus and trachea (aHR 1.99, 95% CI 1.32 to 3.00) and poorer survival.
[u'rainbow trout']Juvenile rainbow trout were exposed to two atorvastatin acid and atorvastatin lactone concentrations for 7 days (nominal concentrations 200 ng L(-1) and 10 unkg L(-1)).
[u'rainbow trout']The pattern of differentially expressed genes in rainbow trout gills differ from responses previously observed in mammalian tissues following statin exposure.
[u'spread']Lipophilic statins reduce the migration and colony formation of PC-3 cells in human BMS by inhibiting GGPP production, reducing the formation and the spread of metastatic prostate colonies.

[u'salt']The physicochemical characteristics and permeation profiles were investigated using pravastatin sodium-bile salt physical mixtures and solid dispersions.
[u'rice']The total statin concentrations of five red yeast rice supplements were between 1.5 and 25.2 mg per specified daily dose.
[u'rice']A dose-dependent inhibition of the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme activity by the red yeast rice products was demonstrated.
[u'rice']The assay can be applied for the determination of statin content for the regulatory control of red yeast rice products.
[u'rice']This article aims to develop a sensitive nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) method to determine the total statin content of red yeast rice products.
[u'rice']The search results indicated that the most widely used strategies are (1) alternative statin dosing, (2) co-enzyme Q10 supplementation, (3) vitamin D supplementation, (4) conversion to red yeast rice (RYR) therapy, and (5) conversion to a different statin.
[u'gelatin']To avoid low-efficacy/frequent side effects of high-dose statin treatment, we utilized biodegradable gelatin hydrogel as a drug delivery system of statin for fracture healing.
[u'gelatin']Simvastatin locally applied with gelatin hydrogel to fracture sites at a dose similar to that used in clinical settings successfully induced fracture union in a rat unhealing bone fracture model via its effect on both angiogenesis and osteogenesis.
[u'sugar']Comparing the two groups, the improvements in fasting blood sugar and serum insulin levels were significantly better in the biguanide group (p = 0.04 for both parameters); whereas the improvements in serum total cholesterol (p < 0.001), low density lipoprotein (p < 0.001), CRP (p < 0.001) and acne status (p = 0.04) were significantly superior in the statin receivers.
[u'rice']When statins cannot be tolerated at all, red yeast rice can be used if proper formulations of the product are obtained.
[u'gelatin']Several factors (CMC concentration, glutaraldehyde concentration, simvastatin loading, and gelatin microsphere processing conditions) were investigated for their effects on drug release.
[u'gelatin']Clodronate release was not affected by CMC concentration, with complete delivery within 12 hr, and simvastatin release could be modulated by cross-linking of the gelatin microspheres, loading, and washing conditions.
[u'grapefruit']Calcium channel blockers and HMG-coA-reductase inhibitors mostly accounted for drugs at risk of interaction in grapefruit consumers.
[u'honey', u'sugar']Various experimental and clinical studies have evaluated different modalities for the treatment of topical wounds, such as sugar, antibiotics, honey and phytotherapies; also statins have diverse pleiotropic effects that have been suggested to be useful to improve wound healing.
[u'atlantic cod']Primary hepatocyte cultures of three marine fish species (plaice, long rough dab, Atlantic cod) were established and exposed for 24 h to copper (20-2500 mg Lunkunk) and statins (1-200 mg Lunkunk).
[u'flatfish']Flatfish hepatocytes were more susceptible to copper and statin exposure than hepatocytes from cod.
[u'casein']The animals were divided into five groups (n = 9): 1) standard (STD): fed on casein as protein source; 2) hypercholesterolemic (HC): STD plus 1% cholesterol and 0.5% cholic acid; 3) HC+11S: hypercholesterolemic + glycinin (300 mg/kg/day); 4) HC+ROS: hypercholesterolemic + rosuvastatin (10 mg/kg/day); 5) HC+11S+ROS: HC diet, the 11S protein and the drug in the doses given in (3) and (4).
[u'rice']While most current methods to analyze red yeast rice are based on HPLC separation with a photo-diode array detector and/or a mass spectrometry detector, which takes 20-40min analysis time per sample, we developed a method to do fast screening of the active compound lovastatin by direct infusion into a mass spectrometer.
[u'rice']The method also seems to be effective in measuring the lovastatin in red yeast rice semi-quantitatively.
[u'salt']Population-wide interventions for salt reduction are very cost-effective such as only ARS$ 151 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) saved in Argentina, whereas statin therapy to lower high cholesterol was $ 70,994 per DALY saved.
[u'fruits']This result is stronger than 60.0% of the 25 systematic reviews analyzed (similar to consumption of fruits and vegetables for cardiovascular events and stronger than statin therapy).
[u'sugar']Policosanol is a dietary supplement derived from sugar cane that is widely used as a statin alternative in Latin America.
[u'salt']Four groups of rats were treated for 6 wk in metabolic cages with their diets: normal salt (NS); HS, NS plus atorvastatin and HS plus atorvastatin.
[u'salt']Atorvastatin corrected all, suggesting that the nitric oxide-oxidative stress balance plays a significant role in the earlier stages of salt induced kidney damage.
[u'grapefruit']To determine whether customary exposure to grapefruit juice (GFJ) alters serum concentrations, effectiveness, and potential adverse effects of atorvastatin in patients requiring the medication.
[u'grapefruit']The purpose of this study is to examine the contributions of organic anion transporting polypeptide (Oatp) and/or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) to grapefruit juice (GFJ) interaction with two statins, pravastatin and pitavastatin, which undergo negligible metabolism in rats.
[u'grapefruit']Pitavastatin undergoes minimal metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and, therefore, has a low propensity for drug-drug interactions with drugs metabolized by CYP enzymes or the CYP3A4 substrate grapefruit juice.
[u'rice', u'wheat', u'wheat', u'wheat']In solid state fermentation (SSF), of the agro wastes from five crops (bran of wheat and rice, husks of red gram and soybean, and green gram straw), wheat bran showed maximum lovastatin production (12.5 mg/g of dry substrate) at pH 7.1 and a temperature of 30 +/- 2 degrees C. Development of a lovastatin production process based on wheat bran as a substrate in SSF is economically attractive as it is a cheap and readily available raw material in agriculture-based countries.
[u'margarine']Although recommended intake levels of the enriched margarines were not reached by all persons, these data show that under customary conditions of use phytosterols/phytostanols are effective in lowering cholesterol levels in both statin users and non-users.
[u'margarine']Cholesterol-lowering effects of the phytosterols/phytostanols were similar in statin users and statin non-users and increased with increasing intake of enriched margarine (no intake, 0; low intake, -0unk017 (95 % CI -0unk16, 0unk13) mmol/l; medium intake, -0unk089 (95 % CI -0unk22, 0unk038) mmol/l; high intake, -0unk32 (95 % CI -0unk50, -0unk14) mmol/l).
[u'oat']The present study aimed to investigate the effects of separate and simultaneous dietary intake of atorvastatin (ATO) and the soluble fiber oat bran on serum and hepatic lipid levels and the degree of atherosclerosis.
[u'oat']In conclusion, the efficacy of oat bran and atorvastatin to lower lipid levels and atherosclerosis is reduced after simultaneous intake.
[u'grapefruit']The major drug classes that have been reported to present interactions with grapefruit juice are antiallergics, antibiotics, antimalaria drugs, anxiolytics, calcium channel blockers, HIV protease inhibitors, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors; the degree of pharmacokinetic interaction varies among the compounds of the same class.
[u'garlic']Groups 4, 5, 6, and 7 received 1, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.75% fresh garlic w/w in feed, respectively in addition to the high-fat and high-cholesterol diet and administered with atorvastatin orally for 12 weeks at the rate of 10, 5, 7.5, and 2.5 mg/kg b.wt., respectively.
[u'garlic', u'garlic']The interaction studies on kidney indicated that high dose of atorvastatin + garlic has negative safety profile when compared with groups having low dose of statin and high dose of garlic.
[u'quail']Statin use, quail ingestion, infection by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and hypothyroidism, though rare, are risk factors for the development of rhabdomyolysis.
[u'salt']We examined the effects of simvastatin on cardiac fibrosis and apoptosis in AM heterozygous knockout (AM(+/-)) mice treated with angiotensin (Ang) II and high salt loading.
[u'salt']The choline salt of fenofibric acid (choline fibrate) is indicated for the treatment of mixed dyslipidemia, either as a single treatment or in combination with statin therapy.
[u'rice']The most promising role for red yeast rice is as an alternative lipid-lowering therapy for patients who refuse to take statins because of philosophical reasons or patients who are unable to tolerate statin therapy due to statin-associated myalgias.
[u'salt', u'salt']Two interventions were cost-saving: lowering salt intake in the population through reducing salt in bread and multidrug therapy targeted to persons with an absolute risk above 20% in 10 years; three interventions had very acceptable ICERs: drug therapy for high blood pressure in hypertensive patients not yet undergoing treatment (I$ 2,908 per DALY saved), mass media campaign to promote tobacco cessation amongst smokers (I$ 3,186 per DALY saved), and lowering cholesterol with statin drug therapy (I$ 14,432 per DALY saved); and one intervention was not found to be cost-effective: tobacco cessation with bupropion (I$ 59,433 per DALY saved)
[u'garlic', u'arepa']Ingestion of garlic extract had no effect on drug and metabolite AUCs following a single dose of simvastatin or pravastatin, although the average area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) of saquinavir decreased to 85% (95% CI, 66-109%), and changes in intestinal P-glycoprotein expression negatively correlated with this change.
[u'margarine']These results imply that persons who combine enriched margarines with statins may neglect taking their drug according to the prescription.
[u'margarine']Among 4848 subjects, 522 used statins only and 60 combined these drugs with phytosterol/-stanol-enriched margarine.
[u'margarine']Overall statin discontinuation rates were not significantly different between the users and non-users of enriched margarine, but more combination users discontinued statin therapy within 12 months in the subgroup of starters (HR(adj) : 2.52 [95%CI: 1.06-6.00]).
[u'margarine']This study aimed to examine the influence of the use of margarines enriched with phytosterols/-stanols on adherence to statin therapy.
[u'gelatin']In a cartilage degradation model, the effects of several statins were assessed by measuring proteoglycan degradation and collagen degradation, while collagenolytic and gelatinolytic activity in culture supernatants were determined by collagen bioassay and gelatin zymography.
[u'ginger']After induction of hypercholesterolaemia by feeding rats with high cholesterol diet, the remaining rats were divided into five groups: group 1, hypercholesterolaemic control group (hypercholesterolaemic rats group); groups 2, 3 and 4, rats were given aqueous infusion of ginger (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg, respectively) orally; and group 5, rats were given atorvastatin (0.18 mg/kg) orally as a reference antihypercholesterolaemic drug.
[u'ginger']The blood was obtained from all groups of rats after being lightly anaesthetized with ether and the following lipid profile [serum total cholesterol (TC), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL-C and triglyceride levels] was measured at zero time and 2 and 4 weeks after ginger and atorvastatin treatment, and the risk ratio (TC/HDL-cholesterol) was assessed.
[u'millet']Germinated finger millet yielded higher total statin production of 5.2 g/kg dry wt with pravastatin and lovastatin content of 4.9 and 0.37 g/kg dry wt respectively than other substrates which range from 1.04-4.41 g/kg.
[u'red rice', u'rice']Since at least some red rice preparations contain about 5 to 10 mg of lovastatin in the daily dose recommended on the package, these preparations may lower blood cholesterol levels, and exhibit similar drawbacks and interactions as the statin drugs.
[u'rainbow trout']The aim of the present study was to quantify the cytotoxic effects of acid and lactone forms of two statins, atorvastatin and simvastatin, as well as selected metabolites (ortho- and para-hydroxy atorvastatin acid, ortho-hydroxy atorvastatin lactone, simvastatin hydroxyl carboxylic acid, and 3''hydroxy simvastatin lactone) to hepatocytes from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).
[u'ginger']This study investigated the combined effect of ginger extract (GE) and atorvastatin on lipid profile and on atorvastatin-induced hepatic injury.
[u'ginger']The results indicate that the ability of ginger to lower serum cholesterol and to decrease aminotransferases, MDA and NO is clinically important, because its chronic administration will neither lead to side-effects nor to hepatic changes as occurs with high atorvastatin doses.
[u'agar']The potential antibiotic effect of lovastatin was tested on blood agar plates.
[u'pectin', u'oat']Consumption of pectin or oat bran together with Lovastatin reduces absorption of the drug, while alcohol intake does not appear to affect the efficacy and safety of Fluvastatin treatment.
[u'grapefruit']Grapefruit juice components inhibit cytochrome P-4503A4, reducing the presystemic metabolism of drugs such as Simvastatin, Lovastatin and Atorvastatin.
[u'olive', u'sunflower']Preliminary study suggests that olive oil can increase the hypolipaemiant effect of Simvastatin with respect sunflower oil.
[u'rice']Red yeast rice supplements have effects similar to those of statin medications and are better tolerated in some patients.
[u'rice', u'rice']Based on this case and a review of current literature, in addition to therapeutic lifestyle change, red yeast rice may be a useful alternative treatment for primary hyperlipidemia in patients with low cardiac risk and who refuse to take any lipid-lowering prescription medication or who maybe be statin intolerant.However, primary care physicians must be aware of the potential side effects of taking red yeast rice.
[u'rice']The present trial evaluated the tolerability of red yeast rice versus pravastatin in patients unable to tolerate other statins because of myalgia.
[u'rice']A total of 43 adults with dyslipidemia and a history of statin discontinuation because of myalgia were randomly assigned to red yeast rice 2,400 mg twice daily or pravastatin 20 mg twice daily for 12 weeks.
[u'rice']The incidence of withdrawal from medication owing to myalgia was 5% (1 of 21) in the red yeast rice group and 9% (2 of 22) in the pravastatin group (p = 0.99).
[u'rice']The low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level decreased 30% in the red yeast rice group and 27% in the pravastatin group.
[u'rice']In conclusion, red yeast rice was tolerated as well as pravastatin and achieved a comparable reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in a population previously intolerant to statins.
[u'gelatin', u'gelatin', u'gelatin']Simvastatin was water-solubilized by gelatin grafted with L-lactic acid oligomer and mixed with gelatin, followed by chemical crosslinking to obtain gelatin hydrogels incorporating simvastatin water-solubilized.
[u'lime']Currently, statins are in lime light due to their pleiotropic effects.
[u'salt']The canalicular efflux of rosuvastatin was measured in the presence of inhibitors: Ko 134, mitoxanthrone, novobiocin for breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp); verapamil for multidrug resistance protein (Mdr1); benzbromarone, sulfasalazine, probenecid for multidrug resistance associated protein (Mrp 2); and cyclosporine A, glibenclamide, troglitazone for bile salt export pump (Bsep).
[u'gelatin']Meanwhile, levels of plasma total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and oxidized (ox)LDL in the rosuvastatin group were decreased as well as MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in aortic arch with gelatin zymography and the production of MMP-2 in the aortic sinus through immunohistochemical methods.
[u'opossum']Gentamicin accumulated within cultured proximal tubule derived opossum kidney (OK) cells and led to dose- and time-dependent cell death which was inhibited by non-toxic doses of simvastatin (IC(50) 1.3 microM), rosuvastatin (IC(50) 16.3 microM) and pravastatin (IC(50) 38.8 microM).
[u'pectin']Familial hypercholesterolemic (FH) swine received the same amount of basal diet (control) in addition to pectin (30 g/day), polyphenols (20 g/day), phytosterols (6 g/day), and all possible combinations in contrast to lovastatin (3 mg/kg of body weight).
[u'pectin', u'pectin', u'pectin']During the 5-8-week treatment period serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol was reduced maximally 22%, 19%, 20%, 17%, 18%, and 17% by polyphenols, phytosterols, pectin + polyphenols, pectin + phytosterols, polyphenols + phytosterols, and pectin + polyphenols + phytosterols, respectively, compared to control (8%) and lovastatin (40%).
[u'olive', u'sunflower']Data suggest that although Simvastatin is a very effective hypolipemic drug, olive oil-diets in preference to sunflower oil-diets must be consumed in patients with high cardiovascular risk.
[u'rice']Red yeast rice and therapeutic lifestyle change decrease LDL cholesterol level without increasing CPK or pain levels and may be a treatment option for dyslipidemic patients who cannot tolerate statin therapy.
[u'rice']To evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of red yeast rice and therapeutic lifestyle change to treat dyslipidemia in patients who cannot tolerate statin therapy.
[u'margarine']To this end, hypercholesterolemic individuals, aged 43-69 y, receiving stable statin treatment were randomly assigned to an 85-wk supplementation with margarines enriched with plant sterol esters (2.5 g/d), plant stanol esters (2.5 g/d), or placebo.
[u'yogurt']After a 3-wk run-in period in which individuals consumed placebo yogurt drinks and placebo capsules, participants were randomly divided into 4 groups: placebo (n = 9), simvastatin + placebo drink (n = 10), placebo + stanol drink (n = 9), and simvastatin + stanol drink (n = 8).
[u'rice']Our results showed that both fluvastatin and Monascus purpureus Went rice were well-tolerated with no significant side effects.
[u'rice']After one year we observed that serum cholesterol was significantly lower in statin and Monascus purpureus Went rice groups compared to the control group.
[u'rice']We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of Monascus purpureus Went rice vs. fluvastatin therapy in the management of nephrotic dyslipidemia.
[u'tea', u'chives']This study provides clinicians with information on some chemoprevention agents that have been considered to reduce prostate cancer risks, including 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors; statins (a class of compounds used to reduce cholesterol); NSAIDs; selenium; vitamins E and D; lycopene; allium vegetables (garlic, scallions, onions, chives, and leeks); soy/isoflavones; and green tea polyphenols.
[u'grapefruit']Since data concerning the toxicity and pharmacokinetics of concomitant repeated administration of grapefruit juice (GFJ) and simvastatin are lacking, we performed a chronic study in rats over a 4-week period using two different strengths (regular [RS] and double strength [DS]) of GFJ and two different doses of simvastatin (20 and 80 mg/kg, respectively).
[u'tea']Age, hour of blood withdrawal, body mass index, pack-years of smoking, NT-proBNP, systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, persistent cough/phlegm and statin use were significantly and independently associated with IL-6 after adjustment for city, recurrent MI, baseline alcohol intake, current active smoking, tea consumption and extreme anger or stress.
[u'salt', u'salt']We have previously developed an Escherichia coli based whole-cell biocatalytic platform towards the synthesis of simvastatin sodium salt (SS) starting from the precursor monacolin J sodium salt (MJSS).
[u'gelatin']Simvastatin was applied locally during the osteotomy phase with a gelatin sponge carrier and systemically during the distraction osteogenesis period by oral gavage.
[u'salt']ABT-335 is the choline salt of fenofibric acid under clinical development as a combination therapy with rosuvastatin for the management of dyslipidemia.
[u'tea']As HMG-CoA reductase activity also can be decreased by enzyme phosphorylation by AMP kinase, the phosphorylation state of HMG-CoA reductase and AMP kinase, which is activated by phosphorylation, was determined in lysates from cells treated with tea extracts.
[u'tea', u'tea']Both extracts increased AMP-kinase phosphorylation and HMG-CoA reductase phosphorylation by 2.5- to 4-fold, but with different time courses: maximal phosphorylation with green tea was evident within 30 min of treatment, whereas with black tea phosphorylation was slower to develop, with maximal phosphorylation occurring > or =3 hours after treatment.
[u'tea']These results suggest that both green and black tea decrease cholesterol synthesis in whole cells by directly inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and by promoting its inactivation by AMP kinase.
[u'margarine']Consumption of plant sterol- or stanol-enriched margarines by statin users results in an additional LDL-cholesterol reduction of approximately 10 %, which may be larger than the average decrease of 3-7 % achieved by doubling the statin dose.
[u'eggs', u'eggs']The total number of morphologically dead eggs found in culture of worms exposed to 2 microg/ml or 4 microg/ml concentrations of lovastatin was significantly higher than the number of viable eggs.
[u'eggs', u'eggs']Using the probe Hoescht 33258 it was observed that 70% of the eggs considered morphologically viable in the treated groups (against 16% in the control group) were labeled, indicating that the majority of the viable eggs had membrane permeability increased due to lovastatin action.
[u'tea']The present study investigated the possible synergistic inhibitory effect of a novel combination of polyphenon E (PPE, a standardized green tea polyphenol preparation) and atorvastatin (trade name Lipitor) in a mouse tumorigenesis model and in human lung cancer H1299 and H460 cell lines.
[u'grapefruit']Weak or moderately potent CYP3A inhibitors such as verapamil, diltiazem and grapefruit juice can be used cautiously with low doses of simvastatin or lovastatin, but their concomitant use needs medical supervision.
[u'salt']Atorvastatin combined with removal of high salt normalized SBP and proteinuria.
[u'rice']The first group comprised 20 cases and were given M. purpureus Went rice in a dose of 600 mg twice/day for 1 month then once daily, the second group comprised 30 cases were given fluvastatin in a daily dose of 20 mg.
[u'rice']We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of Monascus purpureus Went rice vs. fluvastatin therapy in the management of nephrotic dyslipidemia.
[u'rice']We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of Monascus purpureus Went rice versus fluvastatin therapy in the management of nephrotic dyslipidemia.
[u'coffee']We asked whether caffeinated coffee (CC) blunts the infarct size (IS)-limiting effects of atorvastatin (ATV).
[u'rice']Our results showed that both fluvastatin and M. purpureus Went rice were well-tolerated with no evidence of significant side effects, including on neuromuscular function.
[u'rice']Both M. purpureus Went rice and fluvastatin significantly reduced cholesterol after six months and one year, respectively.
[u'gelatin']Gelatin zymography revealed decreased activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in aneurysmal walls by simvastatin treatment.
[u'rainbow trout']In order to establish whether statin drugs could affect an aquatic species, we initially characterized in the rainbow trout the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase or HMGCoAR which is the mammalian target of statin drugs.
[u'shrimp']This study investigated lethal effects (i.e., survival) and sublethal effects (glutathione, GSH; lipid peroxidation, LPx; cholesterol, CHL; and acetylcholinesterase, AChE) of the antihyperlipidemic drug simvastatin on larval and adult grass shrimp (Palaemonetes pugio).
[u'agar']The results of a combined agar dilution-Epsilometer test as well as a disk diffusion assay showed that neither statin had any effect on the in vitro activities of itraconazole, voriconazole, or amphotericin B against Aspergillus spp.
[u'tea']Recently, statin has been identified in Pu-erh tea extract.
[u'tea', u'tea']Interestingly, the statin content of fresh tea leaves fermented with strain R9 or Y11 after 180 days was much higher (4- and 8-fold, respectively) than that of the 25-year-old Pu-erh tea (513 ng/g) as measured by the HPLC method.
[u'salt']N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME, 10 mg/kg), chelerythrine (5 mg/kg) or 5-hydroxydecanoic acid sodium salt (5-HD, 5 mg/kg) was intravenously administered 10 min before pravastatin injection.
[u'salt']Our aims were to evaluate the effects of polymorphisms in the hepatic drug uptake transporter organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1, SLCO1B1) and efflux transporters multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2, ABCC2), bile salt export pump (BSEP, ABCB11), and breast cancer-related protein (BCRP, ABCG2) on single-dose pravastatin pharmacokinetics in healthy European- and African-American participants.
[u'gelatin', u'gelatin']The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of local simvastatin application on bone defect healing and compare the amount of new bone produced by simvastatin gelatin sponge graft with that produced by a gelatin sponge graft and with natural healing.
[u'gelatin']In conclusion, the simvastatin gelatin sponge enhanced bone defect healing in the mandible of rats.
[u'olive']A total of 45 hyperlipidaemic patients on stable statin therapy with persistent elevation of plasma triglycerides (averaging 2.2 mmol/L) were randomised to take 4 g/day (n = 15) or 8 g/day (n = 15) of tuna oil or olive oil (placebo, n = 15) for 6 months.
[u'opossum']To investigate the role of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition of Rac1 and oxidative stress we used the opossum kidney PTC.
[u'salt']Quantum mechanical calculations of the pravastatin molecule are also presented for the first time, obtaining a molecular structure similar to the experimental structure existing within the crystal lattice of the tert-octylamonium salt of pravastatin.
[u'tea']This study was conducted to investigate the hypocholesterolemic effect of simvastatin (30 mg/kg BW) and antioxidant effect of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10, 15 mg/kg BW) or green tea (5%) on erythrocyte Na leak, platelet aggregation and TBARS production in hypercholesterolemic rats treated with statin.
[u'tea']Food efficiency ratio (FER, ADG/ADFI) was decreased in statin group and increased in green tea group, and the difference between these two groups was significant (p<0.05).
[u'tea']Plasma triglyceride was decreased in statin group and increased in groups of CoQ10 and green tea, and the difference between groups of statin and green tea was significant (p<0.05).
[u'tea']Liver total cholesterol was not different between the control and statin group, but was significantly decreased in the group with green tea compared with other groups (p<0.05).
[u'tea', u'tea']Liver triglyceride was decreased in groups of statin and green tea compared with the control, and the difference between groups of the control and green tea was significant (p<0.05).
[u'tea']Intracellular Na of group with green tea was significantly higher than the control or statin group (p<0.05).
[u'tea']TBARS production in platelet rich plasma was significantly decreased in the groups with CoQ10 and green tea compared with the control and statin groups (p<0.05).
[u'tea']TBARS of liver was significantly decreased in the group with green tea compared with the statin group (p<0.05).
[u'garlic']The subjects were randomly assigned to 3 parallel treatment groups: garlic powder (2.1 g/d), atorvastatin (40 mg/d), or placebo.
[u'grapefruit']Many additional drugs such as diltiazem, verapamil, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and cyclosporine, as well as dietary supplements such as St. John's wort and grapefruit juice, interact with statins and are modulators of both CYP3A4 and P-gp.
[u'citrus', u'fruits']We investigated the effect of naringin, a flavonoid available commonly in citrus fruits, which was also a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, in UMR 106 osteoblastic cell line in vitro.
[u'grapefruit', u'pomegranate', u'pomegranate']In conclusion, because both grapefruit and pomegranate juice are known to inhibit intestinal cytochrome P450 3A4, this report suggests that pomegranate juice may increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis during rosuvastatin treatment, despite the fact that rosuvastatin is not known to be metabolized by hepatic P450 3A4.
[u'agar']About 100 compactin-resistant strains were isolated from the Basal agar containing 7% (w/v) mannitol as a carbon source, in which two bacteria, Pseudomocardia autotrophica BCRC 12444 and Streptomyces griseolus BCRC 13677, capable of converting compactin to pravastatin with the yield of 20 and 32% (w/w), respectively, were found.
[u'salt']Increased urinary excretion of 8-iso-prostagaldin F2alpha and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and renal superoxide overproduction and decreased reduced glutathione in the renal parenchyma were ameliorated with pravastatin in Dahl S rats fed a high salt diet.
[u'flaxseed']There were no significant differences in absolute change in BMI nor in percentage change in TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, TC/HDL-C ratio between flaxseed and statin groups.
[u'garlic']A pilot study evaluating coronary artery calcification and the effect of garlic therapy in a group of patients who were also on statin therapy suggested incremental benefits.
[u'margarine']Forty-one subjects on stable statin treatment - who already have increased serum plant sterol and stanol concentrations - first received for 4 weeks a control margarine.
[u'garlic']The purpose of this study was to examine the antiosteoporosis effects of garlic oil in an ovariectomized (Ovx) rat model of osteoporosis and to compare its efficacy with lovastatin (a synthetic hypocholesterolemic drug) and 17beta-estradiol (a potent antiosteoporotic agent).
[u'garlic']Supplementation of these animals with either garlic oil or lovastatin or 17beta-estradiol, in addition to their hypocholesterolemic effect, could counterbalance all these changes.
[u'garlic', u'garlic']The results emphasize that, like 17beta-estradiol, the hypocholesterolemic compounds garlic oil and lovastatin are also effective in suppressing bone loss owing to estrogen deficiency and their efficacy in the order of lower to higher is garlic < lovastatin < 17beta-estradiol.
[u'rice']Chinese red yeast rice (CRYR) is a supplement containing lovastatin (monacolin K), eight other monacolins, pigments, tannins, and other phytochemicals.
[u'tea']Lovastatin was the only statin found in Pu-Erh tea and the highest content of it was found under ethyl acetate extraction.
[u'quail']A quail chorioallantoic membrane assay showed that high concentration (1 micromol/L) of pitavastatin reduced fibroblast growth factor-2-induced angiogenesis, whereas low concentration (0.3 micromol/L) tended to increase angiogenesis.
[u'salt']Adult Sprague Dawley rats kept on a low salt diet (0.05% sodium) were treated daily for 4 weeks with vehicle (olive oil, 1 ml/kg), CsA (15 mg/kg) or both CsA and pravastatin (20 mg/kg in drinking water).
[u'sugar']Evaluation of cost-efficiency indicates that intensive blood sugar control as well as intensive antihypertensive treatment and application of statins are all cost-effective in primary prevention of diabetics.
[u'grapefruit']To compare the effects of grapefruit juice (GFJ) on the pharmacokinetics of pitavastatin and atorvastatin.
[u'margarine']In subjects with high-absorption sterol markers, dietary cholesterol absorption inhibition (eg, with plant stanol and sterol ester margarine) needs to be combined with a statin to achieve effective serum cholesterol reduction.
[u'soy milk', u'almond', u'barley', u'eggplant', u'okra']Thirty-four hyperlipidemic participants underwent all three 1-mo treatments in random order as outpatients: a very-low-saturated-fat diet (control diet), the same diet plus 20 mg lovastatin (statin diet), and a diet high in plant sterols (1.0 g/1000 kcal), soy-protein foods (including soy milks and soy burgers, 21.4 g/1000 kcal), almonds (14 g/1000 kcal), and viscous fibers from oats, barley, psyllium, and the vegetables okra and eggplant (10 g/1000 kcal) (portfolio diets).
[u'wheat']Decreased plasma concentration of simvastatin or lovastatin was observed after co-administration with St. John's wort and wheat bran, respectively.
[u'spread']We, therefore, posit that long-term statin therapy protects individuals from AD by reducing the neuronal spread of HSV-1 via lipid raft domain pathways.
[u'spread']Although the mechanism by which statins reduce AD risk is unknown, they reduce the amount of cholesterol in the plasma membrane and, thus, may decrease the availability of lipid raft pathways to spread HSV-1 within the brain.
[u'agar']The strain was shown to be highly sensitive to lovastatin when its MIC was determined by the agar diffusion method and under submerged conditions that was considered possible to use the strain as a test culture in screening of new natural compounds with hypolipidemic action and to study its specificity.
[u'opossum']Five different statins inhibited the uptake of FITC-labeled albumin by the proximal tubule-derived opossum kidney cell line in a dose-dependent manner and in the absence of cytotoxicity.
[u'grapefruit']Many of the interactions of statins lie in their metabolism through cytochrome P-450 (except for pravastatin), thus making them candidates for interaction with certain foodstuffs or compounds contained in them, such as in the case of grapefruit juice.
[u'wheat']Changes in the intracellular cholesterol content are known to influence the intracellular vesicle distribution and are most likely responsible for cetaben-induced Golgi alterations, as depletion of cellular cholesterol by starvation or lovastatin and/or cyclodextrin treatment resulted in a similar redistribution of Golgi-derived wheat germ agglutinin vesicles.
[u'opossum']The effect of lovastatin on cytoskeleton morphology of opossum kidney cells (OK cells) was determined by staining with fluorescent isothiocyanate (FITC)-phalloidin followed by examination using confocal microscopy.
[u'salt']Atorvastatin combined with removal of high salt normalized aortic eNOS activity, SBP, LVH, and proteinuria.
[u'grapefruit', u'arepa']Grapefruit juice increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curves from 0 to 24 h [AUC(0-24)] of simvastatin 3.6-fold (range 1.8-6.0-fold; P < 0.01) and that of simvastatin acid 3.3-fold (range 2.1-5.6-fold; P < 0.01), respectively.
[u'grapefruit']The peak concentrations (C(max)) of simvastatin and simvastatin acid were increased 3.9-fold (range 2.3-9.3-fold; P < 0.01) and 4.3-fold (range 2.7-7.9-fold; P < 0.01) by grapefruit juice.
[u'grapefruit']Even one glass of grapefruit juice, taken daily, considerably increases the plasma concentrations of simvastatin and simvastatin acid.
[u'gelatin']Gelatin zymography, Western blot analysis and reverse transcriptase-PCR were used to investigate the effects of simvastatin on MMP-9 in primary calvaria cells, U2-OS osteosarcoma cells, and HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells.
[u'gelatin']The results from gelatin zymography and Western blot analysis revealed that simvastatin suppressed MMP-9 activity in these cells in concentration- and time-dependent manners.
[u'rice']Evidence shows that fermented red yeast rice lowers cholesterol levels moderately compared to other statin drugs, but with the added advantage of underscores its potential as a new alternative to lipid level control.
[u'eggplant']The eggplant extract with orange juice is not to be considered an alternative to statins in reducing serum levels of cholesterol.
[u'eggplant', u'eggplant']The study included 21 individuals of both sexes, with total cholesterol (TC) levels > 200 mg/dL, no diabetes, no contraindication for the use of statins, and no use of cholesterol-lowering drugs, divided into the following 3 groups: 1) the eggplant group (B), in which the patients drank 1 glass of eggplant extract with orange juice before breakfast each morning; 2) the statin group (E), in which the patients received 20 mg of lovastatin in the evening after dinner; 3) control group (C), in which the patients received no treatment.
[u'grapefruit']To investigate the effects of repeated grapefruit juice (GFJ) intake on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin and pravastatin in Japanese subjects.
[u'oat']In conclusion, we have characterized pravastatin and cimetidine as OAT inhibitors.
[u'red rice', u'rice']Lovastatin is a naturally occurring component of Chinese red rice and was the probable cause of his myopathy.
[u'grapefruit']Atorvastatin is subject to metabolism by CYP3A4 and cellular membrane transport by OATP C and P-glycoprotein, and drug-drug interactions with potent inhibitors of these systems, such as itraconazole, nelfinavir, ritonavir, cyclosporin, fibrates, erythromycin and grapefruit juice, have been demonstrated.
[u'grapefruit']grapefruit juice, itraconazole, cyclosporine) should be discouraged if a patient is on atorvastatin, lovastatin or simvastatin.
[u'tea']The protective effect of FV was stronger than those of pravastatin and other antioxidants such as Trolox, ascorbic acid and green tea catechin.
[u'margarine']Seventeen stable cardiac transplant recipients, of whom 16 were on statin therapy, used margarine with stanol/sterol esters.
[u'grapefruit']Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is responsible for the metabolism of atorvastatin and simvastatin which present the highest risk of drug interactions with CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as macrolides, antifungal agents, protease inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, amiodarone, and grapefruit juice.
[u'red rice', u'rice']In order to text effectiveness and safety of red rice products, the determination of total lovastatin is more optional than that of determination of its lactone only.
[u'corn']We also studied the influence on TBA-MDA of statins combined with n-3 PUFAs or corn oil.
[u'fruits']A diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, low in sodium, high in potassium and calcium, and containing a lot of fruits and vegetables reduces blood pressure as much as an antihypertensive drug and in coronary patients is twice as effective as statin drugs in reducing death and myocardial infarction.
[u'corn']Plasma concentrations of TF, FXIIa and FM were unaffected by n-3 PUFAs as compared to corn oil, and were uninfluenced by additional statin treatment in subgroup analyses.
[u'grapefruit']The objective of this paper is to investigate in vitro the possible metabolic hepatic interaction between simvastatin (SV) and bergamottin (BG) and thus to compare its effects to those of naringenin (NRG) the aglycone form of naringin (NR) (a flavonoid present in grapefruit juice).
[u'margarine']The objective of this study was to evaluate whether plant sterol-ester margarine has an additive or interactive effect on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction when ingested in combination with a statin drug.
[u'margarine']In subjects with primary hypercholesterolemia, statin and sterol-ester margarine used together produce a purely additive effect on LDL cholesterol reduction.
[u'margarine']The addition of sterol-ester margarine to statin therapy offers LDL cholesterol reduction equivalent to doubling the dose of statin.
[u'margarine']Eleven consecutive hypercholesterolemic coronary patients from Lipid Clinics on a low-fat, low-cholesterol baseline diet added simvastatin (20 mg/day) for three months, and then dietary plant stanol ester margarine (2.25 g of stanols/day) for eight weeks; finally, cholestyramine 8 g/day was added for another eight weeks.
[u'margarine']Simvastatin lowered LDL-C by 39% (p < 0.001), and additional stanol ester margarine by a further 13% (p < 0.05).
[u'margarine']Thus, serum cholesterol and non-cholesterol sterols were measured before and during long-term simvastatin treatment (inhibition of cholesterol synthesis) and subsequent combination of statin with plant stanol ester margarine (inhibition of cholesterol absorption) consumption in subjects with low (n=15) and high (n=15) absorption of cholesterol, defined by respective low and high baseline ratios of serum cholestanol to cholesterol.
[u'margarine']Plant stanol ester margarine consumption, combined with chronic statin treatment, further lowered the serum cholesterol level (P<0.001) only in the high absorption group.
[u'margarine']Thus, stanol ester margarine combined with chronic simvastatin treatment reduces cholesterol absorption and serum cholesterol more consistently in subjects with high than low baseline absorption of cholesterol.
[u'citrus']Accordingly, these results would appear to indicate that naringin, a citrus bioflavonoid, plays an important role in regulating antioxidative capacities by increasing the SOD and catalase activities, up-regulating the gene expressions of SOD, catalase, and GSH-Px, and protecting the plasma vitamin E. In contrast, lovastatin exhibited an inhibitory effect on the plasma and hepatic lipid peroxidation and increased the hepatic catalase activity in high-cholesterol fed rabbits.
[u'rice']Red yeast rice contains a naturally-occurring statin (lovastatin) as well as other cholesterol-lowering compounds, some with antioxidant effects.
[u'spread']We conclude that a fortified fat spread enriched with vegetable oil sterols reduces LDL-cholesterol by 10-15% with no difference in response between hypercholesterolaemic patients prescribed statins and those not taking lipid-lowering drug therapy.
[u'salt']The purification of pravastatin, simvastatin and lovastatin in the sodium salt or lactone form and of mevastatin in the lactone form by reversed-phase displacement chromatography is presented.
[u'rice']Both lovastatin (a fungal product) and a tocotrienol rich fraction (TRF(25), a mixture of tocols isolated from stabilized and heated rice bran containing desmethyl [d-P(21)-T3] and didesmethyl [d-P(25)-T3] tocotrienols) are potent hypocholesterolemic agents, although they suppress cholesterol biosynthesis by different mechanisms.
[u'tea']Protection afforded by exercise training, estrogen replacement, statin drugs, green tea polyphenols, and cruciferous vegetables may reflect increased expression of the endothelial NO synthase.
[u'grapefruit', u'arepa']When simvastatin was taken with grapefruit juice, the mean peak serum concentration (Cmax) and the mean area under the serum concentration-time curve [AUC(0-infinity)] of simvastatin were increased 12.0-fold (P < .001) and 13.5-fold (P < .001), respectively, compared with control.
[u'grapefruit']When simvastatin was administered 24 hours after ingestion of the last dose of grapefruit juice, the Cmax and AUC(0-infinity) were increased 2.4-fold (P < .01) and 2.1-fold (P < .001), respectively, compared with control.
[u'grapefruit']When simvastatin was given 3 days after ingestion of grapefruit juice, the Cmax and AUC(0-infinity) were increased 1.5-fold (P = .12) and 1.4-fold (P = .09), respectively, compared with control.
[u'grapefruit']Seven days after ingestion of grapefruit juice, no differences in the Cmax or AUC(0-infinity) of simvastatin were seen.
[u'grapefruit', u'grapefruit']The mean Cmax and AUC(0-infinity) of simvastatin acid were increased 5.0-fold and 4.5-fold, respectively (P < .001), compared with control when simvastatin was taken with grapefruit juice and 1.7-fold (P < .01) when it was taken 24 hours after ingestion of grapefruit juice.
[u'grapefruit']After an interval of 3 or 7 days between ingestion of grapefruit juice and simvastatin, the pharmacokinetic variables of simvastatin acid did not differ significantly from those in the control phase.
[u'grapefruit', u'grapefruit', u'grapefruit']When simvastatin is taken 24 hours after ingestion of "high-dose" grapefruit juice, the effect of grapefruit juice on the AUC of simvastatin is only about 10% of the effect observed during concomitant intake of grapefruit juice and simvastatin.
[u'grapefruit']We wanted to investigate how long the inhibitory effect of grapefruit juice lasts, with the CYP3A4 substrate simvastatin used as a model drug.
[u'spread', u'spread']This study compares the effect of plant stanol ester spread with a placebo spread on cholesterol in patients taking statin therapy, but who still had elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.
[u'sake']In Japan, the fuzzy control has already been applied to practical industrial productions, such as pravastatin precursor, vitamin B2, and Japanese sake mashing process.
[u'grapefruit']Lovastatin and metabolite exposure is increased only by up to 2-fold when cilostazol is coadministered, which is considerably less than that observed for potent CYP3A inhibitors such as itraconazole and grapefruit juice.
[u'margarine', u'margarine']The families who consumed this margarine for 12 weeks included 24 children, aged 3 to 13 years, with the North Karelia variant of FH (FH-NK), 4 FH-NK parents, and 16 healthy family members, and a separate group of 12 FH-NK adults who consumed the margarine for 6 weeks and who were on simvastatin therapy (20 or 40 mg/d).
[u'margarine']The FH-NK children increased their serum lathosterol ratio more than did the FH-NK adults treated with stanol ester margarine and simvastatin (P<0.01).
[u'margarine']In FH-NK adults on simvastatin therapy, serum LDL cholesterol levels could be reduced even further by including a stanol ester margarine in the regimen.
[u'eggs']Hatchability of all eggs incubated was decreased in both atorvastatin groups compared with the other treatments.
[u'grapefruit']Daily consumption of a glass of regular-strength grapefruit juice has a minimal effect on plasma concentrations of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (approximately 30% to 40% increase) after a 40 mg evening dose of lovastatin.
[u'grapefruit', u'arepa']The area under the plasma concentration-time profiles (AUC) and maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors increased slightly (-30% for each) after consumption of grapefruit juice.
[u'grapefruit']The AUC and Cmax values for lovastatin approximately doubled in the presence of grapefruit juice, whereas the same parameters for lovastatin acid increased 1.6-fold.
[u'grapefruit']We demonstrated that naringenin (NRG), the aglycon form of naringin present in grapefruit juice inhibits in vitro the metabolism of simvastatin (SV), a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor.
[u'grapefruit', u'arepa']Grapefruit juice increased the area under the serum concentration-time curve of atorvastatin acid from time zero to 72 hours [AUC(0-72)] 2.5-fold (P < .01), whereas the peak serum concentration (Cmax) was not significantly changed.
[u'grapefruit']The AUC(0-72) of atorvastatin lactone was increased 3.3-fold (P < .01) and the Cmax 2.6-fold (P < .01) by grapefruit juice, and the tmax and t1/2 were also increased (P < .05).
[u'grapefruit']The AUC(0-72) values of active and total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were increased 1.3-fold (P < .05) and 1.5-fold (P < .01), respectively, by grapefruit juice.
[u'grapefruit']In study II, the only significant change observed in the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin was prolongation of the tmax of active HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors by grapefruit juice (P < .05).
[u'grapefruit']Grapefruit juice significantly increased serum concentrations of atorvastatin acid, atorvastatin lactone, and active and total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, probably by decreasing CYP3A4-mediated first-pass metabolism of atorvastatin in the small intestine.
[u'grapefruit']Concomitant use of atorvastatin and at least large amounts of grapefruit juice should be avoided, or the dose of atorvastatin should be reduced accordingly.
[u'coconut']The effects of atorvastatin (3 mg kg(-1)) and simvastatin (3 mg kg(-1)) on hepatic enzyme activities involved in very low density lipoprotein metabolism were studied in coconut oil/cholesterol fed rabbits.
[u'salt']Simvastatin feeding did not alter biliary bile salt secretion.
[u'grapefruit']Grapefruit juice greatly increases the bioavailability of lovastatin and simvastatin.
[u'grapefruit']We studied the effect of grapefruit juice on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin and pravastatin.
[u'salt']Cytochrome P450sca-2 from Streptomyces carbophilus catalyzes the hydroxylation of ML-236B sodium salt to pravastatin sodium, a tissue-selective inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzymeA (HMG-CoA) reductase.
[u'grapefruit']Grapefruit juice greatly increased serum concentrations of simvastatin and simvastatin acid and, to a lesser extent, those of active and total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.
[u'grapefruit']The probable mechanism of this interaction was inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated first-pass metabolism of simvastatin by grapefruit juice in the small intestine.
[u'grapefruit']Concomitant use of grapefruit juice and simvastatin, at least in large amounts, should be avoided, or the dose of simvastatin should be greatly reduced.
[u'grapefruit', u'arepa']Grapefruit juice increased the mean peak serum concentration (Cmax) of unchanged simvastatin about 9-fold (range, 5.1-fold to 31.4-fold; P < .01) and the mean area under the serum simvastatin concentration-time curve [AUC(0-infinity)] 16-fold (range, 9.0-fold to 37.7-fold; P < .05).
[u'grapefruit']Grapefruit juice increased the mean AUC(0-infinity) of active and total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors 2.4-fold (P < .01) and 3.6-fold (P < .01), respectively.
[u'grapefruit']The time of the peak concentration of active and total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors was increased by grapefruit juice (P < .05).
[u'gelatin']Conditioned media of cells treated for 24 hours with fluvastatin were analyzed by gelatin zymography.
[u'coconut']This study examined the effects of lovastatin supplementation (25 mg/kg per day) in conjunction with an atherogenic diet (10% coconut oil (w/w), 0.05% cholesterol) on regression of pre-existing foam cells and on hepatic and intestinal LDL receptor and HMG CoA reductase mRNA levels.
[u'grapefruit']Grapefruit juice greatly increased the serum concentrations of both lovastatin and lovastatin acid.
[u'grapefruit', u'arepa']The mean peak serum concentration (Cmax) of lovastatin was increased about 12-fold (range, 5.2-fold to 19.7-fold; p < 0.001) and the area under the concentration-time curve [AUC(0-12)] was increased 15-fold (range, 5.7-fold to 26.3-fold; p < 0.001) by grapefruit juice.
[u'grapefruit']The mean Cmax and AUC(0-12) of lovastatin acid were increased about fourfold (range, 1.8-fold to 11.5-fold; p < 0.001) and fivefold (range, 2.4-fold to 23.3-fold; p < 0.001) by grapefruit juice, respectively.
[u'grapefruit']Grapefruit juice can greatly increase serum concentrations of lovastatin and its active metabolite, lovastatin acid, probably by preventing CYP3A4-mediated first-pass metabolism in the small intestine.
[u'grapefruit']The concomitant use of grapefruit juice with lovastatin and simvastatin should be avoided, or the dose of these 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors should be reduced accordingly.
[u'margarine']Hypercholesterolaemic, mildly hypertriglyceridaemic non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients respond to cholesterol malabsorption caused by dietary sitostanol ester margarine, while long-term statin treatment of respective coronary patients significantly lowers the recurrence of coronary events, in addition to improving the lipid disorder.
[u'casein']In the mammary gland, lovastatin at 0.1 micron inhibited the PRL stimulation of lipid and lactose synthesis; at 2 microns, lovastatin abolished the PRL stimulation of casein production.
[u'salt']Compound 3a was approximately four times more potent than lovastatin sodium salt (in inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase in vitro (IC50 = 11 nM).
[u'casein']No similar reduction was seen when simvastatin was combined with casein or cod protein.
[u'salt']Significant inhibition (P < 0.01) of lymphocyte functions, including lymphocyte proliferative response to a variety of stimuli and activated natural killer-cell cytotoxicity, was demonstrated only when greater than 90% of the sterol synthesis in lymphocytes was inhibited by either simvastatin or simvastatin sodium salt at concentrations above 2 microM.
[u'margarine', u'margarine', u'margarine']Four 7-week intervention periods included margarine, sitostanol (3 g/day) ester margarine, pravastatin (40 mg/day), and sitostanol ester margarine plus pravastatin in a random order.
[u'margarine']Combination of pravastatin and sitostanol ester lowered serum total, VLDL, IDL, and LDL cholesterol and LDL apolipoprotein B by the highest rate, 35%, 50%, 35%, 44%, and 45% from the control margarine period, respectively, because of reduced apolipoprotein B transport rate (but unchanged removal), in both the total and dense LDL subfractions.
[u'salt']Physiologic biliary concentrations of the hydrophilic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor pravastatin were added to supersaturated model bile (cholesterol saturation index 1.4) and vesicles, the latter with and without the concomitant addition of the nucleation-promoting bile salt taurodeoxycholate.
[u'coconut']The present study analyses the effects of simvastatin, a specific inhibitor of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA reductase) in male Syrian hamsters fed a standard diet or a diet supplemented with 0.12% cholesterol and 20% coconut oil.
[u'salt']The sodium salt of phenylacetic acid (NaPA), an inhibitor of MVA-pyrophosphate decarboxylase, the enzyme that controls MVA use, acted synergistically with lovastatin to suppress malignant growth.
[u'salt']In addition cholestyramine alone and combined with simvastatin leads to a strong decrease of bile salt hydrophobicity, which may be beneficial in the prevention of nucleation of cholesterol crystals.
[u'buffalo']In May 1994, the Buffalo Veterans Affairs Medical Center Lipid Clinic adopted a fluvastatin-preferred program in which all patients who were recommended for an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor would be treated with fluvastatin as a first-line agent.
[u'salt']The lovastatin lactone form and sodium salt of mevinolinic acid inhibited bacterial luciferase in vitro but did not affect bioluminescence of the intact cells of the luminous bacteria.
[u'salt']Although bile salt concentrations were lower in the pravastatin group (114 +/- 21 vs. 152 +/- 15 mmol/L), this difference was not significant.
[u'casein']To ensure equivalent mean cholesterol concentrations, animals were randomized into treatment groups based on the 6-week TPC levels, and fed the casein diet alone or in combination with either atorvastatin or lovastatin for an additional 6 weeks.
[u'casein']To determine the mechanism by which atorvastatin lowered TPC in the EH rabbits, kinetic studies using human [125I]-LDL were performed in a subset of animals maintained on the casein diet alone (n = 5), or those treated with 3 mg/kg of atorvastatin (n = 5) or lovastatin (n = 7).
[u'agar']AML cells and normal BM mononuclear cells were incubated for 18 hours in suspension culture with 10 micrograms per mL simvastatin and the numbers of surviving clonogenic progenitor cells assayed in semisolid agar culture.
[u'oyster mushroom', u'mushrooms']The effect of dried oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus) on cholesterol (C) content in serum, in lipoproteins and in liver, and on the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase in liver microsomes, was studied in male rats (strain Wistar, initial body weight 75 g) fed on low-cholesterol (9 mg/100 g) and high-cholesterol (0.3%) diets.
[u'oyster mushroom', u'mushrooms']Addition of 5% oyster mushroom to both diets reduced significantly the C-content in serum (by 30%), in very-low- and low-density lipoproteins (in a 1:1 ratio to the decrease of total serum C) and in liver (by 50%), as well as the activity of HMG-CoA reductase (by more than 30%).
[u'eggs']Serum total lathosterol (micrograms/dl) was reduced by lovastatin (P < 0.0001), but was not significantly altered (and actually tended to increase) during consumption of the high cholesterol diet, presumably because eggs contained appreciable lathosterol as demonstrated by direct analysis.
[u'salt']It has been shown previously that the disodium salt of a new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (SQ-33600) is capable of existing as a number of hydrate species [1].
[u'peanut', u'coconut']Atorvastatin, previously known as CI-981 (2.5 mg/kg), PD135022 (1.0 mg/kg), simvastatin (2.5 mg/kg), lovastatin (2.5 mg/kg), PD134965 (1.0 mg/kg), pravastatin (2.5 mg/kg) and BMY22089 (2.5 mg/kg) were added to a 0.5% cholesterol, 3% peanut, 3% coconut oil diet and fed for 8 weeks.
[u'pulses']The stage-dependent susceptibility of P. falciparum to simvastatin was studied by subjecting synchronized cultures to 6-h pulses of drug throughout the 48-h erythrocytic life cycle.
[u'salt']An actinomycete (MA 6474, ATCC 53828) isolated from a soil sample (Mutare, Zimbabwe) was found to biotransform the sodium salt of Simvastatin (MK-733) to 6-alpha-hydroxymethyl MK-733, 6-beta-hydroxymethyl MK-733, and 6-ring-hydroxy MK-733.
[u'salt']An extended-release osmotic dosage form was designed for gastrointestinal delivery of the water-soluble tromethamine salt of the beta-hydroxyacid form of simvastatin, a potent HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and cholesterol lowering agent.
[u'salt']These findings raise the possibility that addition of lovastatin to ursodeoxycholic acid treatment might improve the efficacy of this bile salt for dissolution of cholesterol gallstones, especially in patients with a suboptimal response to ursodeoxycholic acid.
[u'salt']The sodium salt of DL-3,5-dihydroxyvaleric acid inhibits HMG-CoA reductase competitively with respect to HMG-CoA and noncompetitively with respect to NADPH.
[u'salt']The sodium salt of (E)-6-[2-(2-methoxy-1-naphthalenyl)ethenyl]-3,4,5,6- tetrahydro-4-hydroxy-2H-pyran-2-one (6) inhibits HMG-CoA reductase competitively with respect to HMG-CoA and noncompetitively with respect to NADPH.
[u'radish']The fungal metabolite mevinolin, known to be a potent hypocholesterolemic agent, exerts in vitro a strong inhibitory effect on microsomal HMG-CoA reductase from etiolated radish seedlings at a concentration of about three magnitudes lower than the Km towards the natural substrate (S)-HMG-CoA (I50 = 2.5 x 10(-9)M).
[u'radish']1) In kinetic studies, mevinolin proved to be a highly specific inhibitor of partially purified yeast HMG-CoA reductase (Ki = 3.5 nM towards HMG-CoA) and of microsomal HMG-CoA reductase from etiolated radish seedlings (Ki = 2.2 nM).
