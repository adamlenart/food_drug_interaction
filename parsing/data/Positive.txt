[[u'pro', u'generate', u'significant'], ['casein', 'whey'], 'digestion of isolated whey proteins and caseins of goat milk by gastric pepsin generated soluble hydrolysates exhibiting significant inhibition of ACEI compared to weak inhibition by undigested proteins.']
[[u'candid', u'potent'], ['casein', 'whey'], 'the results introduce, for the first time, new potent ACEI-inhibitory peptides that can be released by gastric pepsin of goat milk whey and caseins and thus may pave the way for their candidacy as anti-hypertensive bioactive peptides and prevention of associated disorders.']

[[u'efficacy'], ['pulses'], 'this meta-analysis of randomized parallel controlled trials was designed to compare the efficacy of atenolol with ACEI in changing pulse wave velocity (pwv), peripheral blood pressure and heart rate (hr) among patients with essential hypertension.']
[[u'pro', u'efficient'], ['rice', 'wheat'], 'enzymatic hydrolysis of proteins from rice, soy, pea and wheat, with both chymotrypsin and thermolysin, resulted in hydrolysates, which are efficient inhibitors of the ACEI (ACEI).']
[[u'pro', u'tribute'], ['whey'], 'compared to hydrolysates from whey protein, where the inhibitory effect can almost exclusively be attributed to ile-trp, the ACEI inhibition by plant protein hydrolysates is caused by a variety of peptides, in particular tyrosine-containing peptides.']
[[u'apt', u'elate'], ['date'], 'the annual rate of adverse events related to ACEI (ie, the number of reported cases of adverse events per 1000 patients receiving an ACEI) was calculated from data captured on the date the events were first reported for the 5 years before and 5 years after the revocation of the pa constraint.']
