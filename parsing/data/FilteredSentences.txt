[u'casein', u'whey']in this study, we examined the separated caseins and whey proteins of goat milk for the presence of ACEI inhibitory peptides.
[u'casein', u'whey']digestion of isolated whey proteins and caseins of goat milk by gastric pepsin generated soluble hydrolysates exhibiting significant inhibition of ACEI compared to weak inhibition by undigested proteins.
[u'casein', u'whey']the late-eluting fraction (f4) of either whey or caseins exhibited greater ACEI inhibition.
[u'casein', u'whey']the peptides from whey and caseins exert significant ACEI inhibitory activities comparable to that of captopril, an antihypertensive drug, exhibiting ic50 values of 4.45unkunkm and 4.27unkunkm, respectively.

[u'water']bilateral injections of muscimol (0.2 nmol/0.2 microl) into the lateral parabrachial nucleus strongly increased 0.3 m nacl (20.3+/-7.2 vs. saline: 2.6+/-0.9 ml/180 min) without changing water intake induced by the treatment with the diuretic furosemide combined with low dose of the ACEI captopril s.c.
[u'water']functional overloads of the plantaris and soleus muscles were produced via bilateral surgical ablation of the synergistic gastrocnemius muscle, and ACEI inhibition was accomplished by the addition of the ACEI enalapril maleate to the animals' daily drinking water (0.3 mg/ml).

[u'water']while no treatment was given to rats in group 1, lisinopril (an ACEI) was given to rats in group 2 and group 3 for post-operative 7 days in drinking water at 50 and 5 mg/l concentrations, respectively.
[u'salt']strategies to limit protein excretion include the use of ACEI or angiotensin receptor blockers and appropriate salt intake limitation.
[u'rice']in this study, the effect of process conditions on the ACEI inhibitory activity of rice dregs hydrolyzed with a trypsin was investigated systematically using response surface methodology.
[u'rice']it was shown that the ACEI inhibitory activity of rice dregs hydrolysates could be controlled by regulation of five process conditions.
[u'shortening']it was found that beta-blockers, ACEI, and angiotensin ii receptor antagonists independently improve both the plasma bnp level and %fractional shortening (fs), while oral inotropic agents increased the plasma bnp level and decreased %fs.

[u'pulses']the following immunosuppressive drugs have been used with varying success: cyclosporine, intravenous methyl prednisone pulses alone or combined with or followed by alkylating agents, plasma-exchange, and ACEI (ACEI) inhibitors.
[u'date']although increased activity of ACEI (ACEI) has been associated with increased cardiac collagen, no studies to date have established a direct cause-and-effect relation between the two.
[u'salt']two clinical groups have demonstrated that salt restriction has a larger and more consistently beneficial impact on the blood pressure of hypertensives when they concurrently are treated with ACEI - evidently because the physiological impact of the associated rise in renin is blunted.
[u'cheese', u'cheese']two experimental batches of manchego cheese elaborated with selected bacterial strains with the aim of improve the organoleptic characteristics demonstrated also a good performance in the formation of peptides with ACEI-inhibitory activity during cheese ripening.

[u'wax gourd']the aims of this study were to investigate the abilities of antioxidation and inhibition of ACEI (ACEI) activity of wax gourd pulp, core, seed, and peel prepared by different extraction methods.
[u'date']with respect to large trials published to date directly comparing arb versus ACEI therapy, neither the losartan heart failure survival study (elite ii) nor the optimal trial in myocardial infarction with the angiotensin ii antagonist losartan (optimaal) found differences in mortality or morbidity between the treatment groups.
[u'whey']a sample of we80bg derived from whey proteins showed the strongest anti-hypertensive activity (-21.2 +/- 16.9 mm hg) with a medium level of ACEI inhibitory activity (53.6%), and it was subjected to hydrophobic and gel filtration chromatography.
[u'whey']by means of an ACEI inhibitory peptide database, containing about 500 reported sequences and their ic(50) values, the different proteins in pea and whey were quantitatively evaluated as precursors for ACEI inhibitory peptides.
[u'whey']the major whey protein beta-lactoglobulin obtained the highest in silico scores, which corresponded with the fact that degradation of this protein in vitro only occurred from the simulated small intestine phase on and resulted in a 10-fold increase in the ACEI inhibitory activity.
[u'whey', u'whey']whey protein obtained total in silico scores of about 124 ml/mg, compared to 46 ml/mg for pea protein, indicating that whey protein would be a richer source of ACEI inhibitory peptides than pea protein.
[u'whey']although beta-lactoglobulin is only partially digested, a higher ACEI inhibitory activity was indeed found in the whey (ic(50) = 0.048 mg/ml) compared to the pea digest (ic(50) = 0.076 mg/ml).
[u'water']the maximum ACEI inhibitory activity (ic50: 0.31 mg) was obtained when the fruiting body of t. giganteum was extracted with distilled water at 30 degrees c for 3 h. after the purification of ACEI inhibitory peptides with ultrafiltration, sephadex g-25 column chromatography, and reverse-phase hplc, an active fraction with an ic50 of 0.04 mg and a yield of 0.3% was obtained.

[u'rabbit']a protocol to follow the processing of angiotensin i into angiotensin ii by rabbit ACEI (ACEI) and its inhibition by a novel natural antagonist, the leech osmoregulator factor (lorf) using capillary zonal electrophoresis is described.
[u'rabbit']we demonstrated that lorf (ipepyvwd), a neuropeptide previously found in leech brain, is able to inhibit rabbit ACEI with an ic(50) of 19.8 micro m. interestingly, its cleavage product, ipep exhibits an ic(50) of 11.5 micro m. a competition assay using p-benzoylglycylglycylglycine and insect ACEI established that lorf and ipep fragments are natural inhibitors for invertebrate ACEI.
[u'water']a&a, ACEI or the same amount of water was administered by gavage beginning 24 hours before uuo preparation and continued through ten days after uuo.
[u'water']ACEI inhibition (ACEI) with captopril has been shown to increase water intake and urine output in rats, but the mechanism is unknown.
[u'water']we conclude that ACEI with captopril induces primary polydipsia despite impaired production of the dipsogen ang ii and that this primary increase in water intake is likely the cause of the decreased protein abundance of inner medullary aqp2.
[u'sunflower']sunflower protein isolates and the proteases pepsin and pancreatin were used for the production of protein hydrolysates that inhibit angiotensin-i converting enzyme (ACEI).
[u'sunflower']these results show that sunflower seed proteins are a potential source of ACEI inhibitory peptides when hydrolyzed with pepsin and pancreatin.
[u'rabbit']to assess the effects of the ACEI (ACEI) inhibitor (ACEI) perindopril on prolonged endothelial cell dysfunction in a rabbit endotoxic model.
[u'water']the ingestion of 0.3 m nacl and water was induced by subcutaneous injections of the diuretic furosemide (furo, 10 mg/kg) and the ACEI captopril (cap, 5 mg/kg), and extracellular concentrations of 5-ht and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-hiaa) were measured using intracerebral microdialysis techniques.
[u'salt']we compared the effects of 4 weeks treatment of the vasopeptidase inhibitor omapatrilat and the ACEI enalapril on the degree of fibrosis and the concentration of vip in the heart in salt sensitive hypertension induced by treatment with l-nitro-omega-methylarginine (l-name).
[u'date']we present meta-analyses of the available randomised controlled trials to date (october 2003) of angiotensin ii receptor antagonists versus placebo in patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure in which both groups received ACEI.

[u'spinach']four new inhibitory peptides for angiotensin i-converting enzyme (ACEI), that is, mrwrd, mrw, lripva, and iaykpag, were isolated from the pepsin-pancreatin digest of spinach rubisco with the use of hplc.
[u'water']the experiment was carried out under the low water activity condition, using tosylate chloride activating side-chain hydroxyl group of sepharose cl-4b agarose to form a high active group which could react with the free amino-group of ACEI to link the enzyme with agarose.
[u'whey']in this study, the conditions of in vitro gastrointestinal digestion leading to the formation and degradation of ACEI inhibitory peptides were investigated for pea and whey protein.
[u'whey']in batch experiments, the digestion simulating the physiological conditions sufficed to achieve the highest ACEI inhibitory activity, with ic(50) values of 0.076 mg/ml for pea and 0.048 mg/ml for whey protein.
[u'whey']these results show that ACEI inhibitory activity of pea and whey hydrolysates can be controlled by the conditions of in vitro gastrointestinal digestion.
[u'tea']green tea extract (efla85942) is able to induce specifically the neutral endopeptidase (nep) activity and to inhibit the proliferation of sk-n-sh cells; the ACEI (ACEI) activity is not influenced under the same conditions.
[u'tea', u'tea']the treatment of the cells with arabinosylcytosine and green tea extract results in a strong enhancement of cellular nep activity whereas cellular ACEI activity was not changed significantly, indicating a green tea extract-specific regulation of nep expression.
[u'pectin', u'pectin']solutions of 100 ml of 1% commercial pectin each with a different degree of esterification (de), de94, de65, and de25, were reacted with 100 ml of 2 m alkaline hydroxylamine (ph 12.0) at room temperature for 4 or 18 h. these pectin hydroxamic acids (phas; de94t4, de94t18, de65t4, and de25t4) were used to test the inhibitory activities against semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (ssao) and ACEI (ACEI).
[u'buffalo']various ACEI-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine alpha(s1)-casein (alpha(s1)-cn) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and beta-cn f58-76; ovine alpha(s1)-cn f1-6 and alpha(s2)-cn f182-185 and f186-188; caprine beta-cn f58-65 and alpha(s2)-cn f182-187; buffalo beta-cn f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human beta-cn.
[u'whey']of the samples assayed, it was infant formulae whey that produces the greatest ACEI inhibition.
[u'yogurt', u'whey']ACEI-inhibition type was also studied, using a yogurt whey and a captropil solution as substrates.
[u'water']to investigate whether an ACEI (enalapril) or an angiotensin ii receptor blocker (losartan) could mitigate age-associated changes in kidney mitochondria, male wistar rats (14 mo old) received during 8 mo water containing either enalapril (10 mg/kg/day) (enal), or losartan (30 mg/kg/day) (los), or no additions (old).
[u'cheese']these results strongly suggest that digestive enzymes diminished the ACEI inhibition by the peptides present in emmental cheese wse, while the digestion of peptides of high molecular weight would generate new ACEI inhibitory peptides.
[u'water']we studied interstitial changes in rats before and after release of uuo and examined the effect of ACEI with 200mg/l of enalapril (e) in the drinking water on these changes.
[u'shortening']percent shortening and -dl/dt of isolated adjacent myocytes were improved with both ACEI (7.9 +/- 0.3%, -131 +/- 6 microm/sec, p <.05) and ct (7.7 +/- 0.3%, -144 +/- 8 microm/sec, p <.05) compared with no therapy (6.4 +/- 0.4%, -104 +/- 7 microm/sec), as was both +dl/dt and tr 70%.
[u'shortening']fractional shortening increased from 17.0 +/- 7.6 to 19.8 +/- 8.9% (p = 0.017) in the ACEI group and from 16.6 +/- 7.2 to 24.7 +/- 8.0% (p < 0.0001) in the beta-blocker group, respectively.
[u'shortening']changes of left ventricular dimensions at end-diastole and at end-systole, and fractional shortening were all greater in the beta-blocker group than in the ACEI group.
[u'water']lisinopril in drinking water (20, 50, or 200 mg/l) was administered to 10-week-old male wistar bonn/kobori (wbn/kob) rats for 10 weeks and then the inflammatory parameters, fibrosis, serum and pancreatic ACEI activity, and expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 (tgf-beta1) messenger rna (mrna) as well as positive immunostaining for alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-sma) were assessed.
[u'water']furthermore, blockade of ang ii production by an intravenous infusion of the ACEI captopril attenuated the hypotension-induced water intake similarly in rats fed standard and high-salt diet.
[u'whey']pea and whey protein were fermented by lactobacillus helveticus and saccharomyces cerevisiae in monoculture and in combination at 28 and 37 degrees c in order to release angiotensin-i-converting enzyme (ACEI) inhibitory peptides.
[u'whey']after fermentation, the ACEI inhibitory activity (%) increased by 18 to 30% for all treatments, except for the fermentations of whey protein with saccharomyces cerevisiae at 28 degrees c, where no significant change was observed.
[u'whey']the whey digests tended to have lower (50%) inhibitory concentrations (ic50; 0.14 to 0.07 mg/ml), hence, higher ACEI inhibitory activity, than the pea digests (0.23 to 0.11 mg/ml).
[u'whey']the nonfermented whey protein digest showed the highest ACEI inhibitory activity of all.
[u'salt']commercial ACEI could be adsorbed only by eah-coupled gsh gels and eluted off the gels by increasing salt concentrations.
[u'water']shr received, from the age of 4 wk, one of the two ACEI (lisinopril or zofenopril, 10 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) or for comparison, the selective at(1) antagonist (losartan, 20 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) in their drinking water for a period of 4, 12, and 20 wk.
[u'eggs']both ACEI reduced the size of the batch of eggs laid by females in a dose-dependent manner, with no observable effects on the behaviour of the adult insect.
[u'wakame']wakame (undaria pinnatifida) was hydrolyzed using 17 kinds of proteases and the inhibitory activity of the hydrolysates for ACEI was measured.
[u'wakame']the angiotensin-i-converting enzyme (ACEI) inhibitory and antihypertensive activities of wakame hydrolysates have been investigated in several studies.
[u'wakame']the hydrolysates derived from wakame by protease s 'amano' have a powerful ACEI-inhibitory activity (ic(50) = 86 microg protein/ml) and were effective in spite of their slight bitterness as 'physiologically functional food' with antihypertensive activity.
[u'cocktail']as sperm membrane-bound ACEI and neutral metalloendopeptidase are mainly involved in bk hydrolysis, an effective cocktail of enzyme inhibitors promoting the sperm motility consists of phosphoramidon and lisinopril (both at 10-7 m).
[u'water']to investigate the effects of angiotensin ii on endothelin and its receptors in the kidney, mice were subjected to uuo and treated with or without enalapril, an orally active ACEI, in their drinking water (100 mg/l).
[u'water', u'water']the ingestion of 0.3 m nacl and water was induced by treatment with the diuretic furosemide (10 mg/kg of body weight)+the ACEI captopril (5 mg/kg) injected subcutaneously 1 h before the access of rats to water and 0.3 m nacl.
[u'date']this article will discuss preliminary date concerning simultaneous inhibition of ACEI, ece and/or nep and their therapeutic potential interest in the treatment of heart failure.
[u'gelatin', u'alaska pollock']angiotensin i that converts the enzyme (ACEI) inhibitory peptide, gly-pro-leu, previously purified and identified from the alaskan pollack skin gelatin hydrolysate, were synthesized.
[u'shortening']in 11 patients with chronic heart failure treated with an ACEI and a beta-blocker, who have had severe left ventricular dysfunction or high plasma level of natriuretic peptides, left ventricular dimension, and fractional shortening, plasma atrial and brain natriuretic peptide (anp and bnp) levels were determined before and 3 months after the change of treatment.
[u'salt']several therapeutic measures (that is, adequate blood pressure control, early introduction of ACEI/ara, dietary protein restriction, low salt diets, weight loss in overweight patients, addition of a diuretic, increasing ACEI/ara dose titrated against proteinuria levels, combined therapy ACEI plus ara, addition of drugs with antiproteinuric effect such as non-dihydropiridine calcium channel blockers or nsaids) may increase the proteinuria reduction induced by ACEI and ara.
[u'wakame']seven kinds of angiotensin i-converting enzyme (ACEI) inhibitory peptides were isolated from the hydrolysates of wakame (undaria pinnatifida) by protease s "amano" (from bacillus stearothermophilus) by using three-step high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) on a reverse-phase column.
[u'casein']the commercial bovine serum albumin and casein (bovine milk) showed less ACEI inhibitory activity.
[u'salt']furthermore, csa blunted the increase of renocortical cox-2 expression in response to low salt intake or a combination of low-salt diet with the ACEI ramipril (10 mg/kg per day), which strongly stimulates renocortical cox-2 expression.
[u'salt']moreover, our data suggest that the stimulation of the renin system by low salt and by ACEI is not essentially mediated by cox-2 activity.
[u'water']vasopeptidase inhibitors (vpis), by simultaneously inhibiting ACEI and nep, reduce vasocontriction and enhance vasodilation; thus, they improve local blood flow, and improve sodium and water excretion.
[u'rabbit']we investigated the effects of a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a (hmg-coa) reductase inhibitor, pravastatin, an ACEI (ACEI) inhibitor, temocaprilat, and an angiotensin ii type 1 (at1) receptor antagonist, cv-11974, on myocardial metabolism during ischemia in isolated rabbit hearts using phosphorus 31-nuclear magnetic resonance (31p-nmr) imaging.
[u'water']acetazolamide (ACEI) is a putative inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase (ca), an enzyme that catalyzes the equilibration of carbon dioxide and carbonic acid and plays a key role in hco(3)(-) and water reabsorption and acid secretion.
[u'water']the present findings suggest that the reduction of rat sperm motility and count by ACEI can be attributed to its capacity to downregulate aqp1 water channel gene expression.
[u'water']we investigated the effects of water extracts of danshen on the ACEI (ACEI) activities, systolic blood pressure (sbp), and hormone levels in the plasma of 2k1c rats.
[u'water']ACEI (ACEI) inhibitors are commonly administered when hypertension is present to decrease plasma concentrations of angiotensin ii and aldosterone, which cause vasoconstriction and sodium and water retention, respectively.
[u'salt']blood pressure was manipulated with aggressive antihypertensive treatment combining low dietary salt and the ACEI enalapril.
[u'date']the available data to date indicate that ACEI, methyldopa, beta-blockers with high protein binding, and some calcium channel blockers all appear to be safe treatments of hypertension in a nursing mother.
[u'water']in chf, blockade of vasopressin v(1a) and v(2) receptors was associated with increased water excretion, and the combination of conivaptan with ACEI inhibition was the only treatment to reduce blood pressure, natriuretic peptide and pulmonary congestion.
[u'tartary buckwheat']the latent production of angiotensin i-converting enzyme (ACEI) inhibitors from tartary buckwheat (bw) was investigated, and the peptides responsible for ACEI inhibition characterized.
[u'salt']however, beta-adrenoreceptor activity or renal nerve activity appears to be required for the full stimulation of nnos expression by low salt intake or combined with ACEI inhibition.
[u'rabbit']by this spectrophotometric method, ACEI inhibition is measured using the substrate furanacryloyl-phe-gly-gly and as ACEI source rabbit lung acetone extract.
[u'whey']furthermore, pea and whey protein hydrolysates obtained by digestion with trypsin showed ACEI inhibitory activity in the ACEI inhibition assay.
[u'salt']this remarkable response to candesartan in subjects on a high-salt diet,when compared with the response to captopril,suggests that non-ACEI-dependent ang ii generation was influenced less than the classical renal pathway with an increase in salt intake, so that the percentage of ang ii generated via the non-ACEI pathway rose to the 60-70% range.
[u'date']although ACEI and angiotensin receptor blockers may differ theoretically in their renal effects, published information to date has not shown such a difference.
[u'water']diabetes was induced in 16 rats by administrating streptozocin; 8 of the diabetic rats were allocated at random to receive the ACEI perindopril (2 mg/l) in their drinking water and 8 age and weight matched rats served as controls.
[u'salt']the hypotensive effect of calcium channel blockers is less dependent on salt intake than other drugs, such as ACEI or diuretics.
[u'shrimp']sardine autolysate and cod head hydrolysate powder (50 microg) were able to inhibit near 30% of ACEI activity, whereas 50 microg of shrimp hydrolysate allows the inhibition of 57% of ACEI activity.
[u'rabbit']the rabbit jugular vein (rbjv) was used as a bioassay system to validate some early and new hypothetical interactions between the ACEI (ACEI) and the b2 receptor, which may be influenced by ACEI (ACEI-i).
[u'rabbit']enzymatic degradation studies performed in vitro and in vivo revealed that bk and r556 are readily degraded by rabbit ACEI whereas [phe8psi(ch2-nh)arg9]-bk (r379) is totally resistant.
[u'shortening']we found that (1) compared with c57 mice, enos-/- mice that underwent sham surgery had significantly increased systolic blood pressure (p<0.05) and increased lv mass both initially and at 1 to 3 months, although cardiac function and histological findings did not differ between strains; (2) the development of hf and myocardial remodeling were similar after mi in both strains; and (3) ACEI improved cardiac function and remodeling in c57 mice, as evidenced by increased lv ejection fraction (lvef) and lv shortening fraction (lvsf) and decreased diastolic lv dimension, mass, myocyte cross-sectional area, and interstitial collagen fraction, but these benefits were absent or diminished in enos-/- mice (for c57 versus enos-/-: increase in lvef after ACEI, 14.2 +/- 2% versus -4.9 +/- 2.5%, respectively [p<0.001]; increase in lvsf, 8.6 +/- 2.1% versus -7.2 +/- 2.8%, respectively [p<0.01]; and decrease in lv mass, -16.6 +/- 15 versus 73 +/- 23 mm(3), respectively [p<0.01]).
[u'rabbit']nk3201 inhibited human and dog chymases, but not rabbit ACEI.
[u'rabbit']in this study, the inhibition time courses of serum ACEI (ACEI) activity after intravenous administration of enalaprilat encapsulated in intact erythrocytes was evaluated and compared with free drug, in a rabbit model.
[u'rabbit']we here examined the effect of the combination of an ACEI, temocaprilat, an at1 receptor antagonist, cv-11974 and/or a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, l-name, on the myocardial metabolism and contraction during ischemia and reperfusion by using phosphorus 31-nuclear magnetic resonance (31p-nmr) in langendorff rabbit hearts.
[u'rabbit', u'rabbit']the b(2)-agonists bk, d-arg-[hyp(3)]-bk, [hyp,(3) tyr(me)(8)]-bk, [deltaphe(5)]-bk, [d-nmf(7)]-bk, and [phe(8)psi(ch(2)-nh)arg(9)]-bk were tested for degradation by purified rabbit ACEI and for their potency in contracting the endothelium-denuded rabbit jugular vein in the absence and presence of ramiprilat.
[u'salt']in healthy subjects on a high salt diet, the hyperglycemic state produced significant increases in renal plasma flow (rpf) in response to administration of the ACEI captopril.

[u'water']male wistar rats underwent transient aortic perfusion with porcine pancreatic elastase, followed by treatment with one of three ACEI (captopril [cp], lisinopril [lp], or enalapril [ep]), an angiotensin (at)1 receptor antagonist (losartan [los]), or water alone (9 rats in each group).
[u'casein', u'whey']numerous casein and whey protein-derived angiotensin-i-converting enzyme (ACEI) inhibitory peptides/hydrolysates have been identified.
[u'mustard']ACEI had no significant effect on cardiopulmonary exercise function in 14 patients who had undergone a mustard operation for transposition of the great arteries.
[u'date']no convincing evidence has been published to date to support the use of fish oil, ACEI or tonsillectomy for the treatment of children with igan or hspn.
[u'salt']these results indicate that high salt intake increases blood pressure, ACEI expression and activity in the hypothalamus and pons of dahl s rats without a parallel increase in angiotensin ii levels.
[u'salt']effects of high salt intake on ACEI mrna and activity appear to be secondary to activation of brain 'ouabain'.
[u'salt']dahl s rats showed small but significant increases in ACEI mrna in the hypothalamus on regular salt diet.
[u'salt']in dahl s rats on high salt diet for 2 or 5 weeks ACEI mrna levels significantly increased in both hypothalamus and pons, compared with dahl r rats on either diet or dahl s rats on regular diet.
[u'salt', u'salt']after 5 weeks of high salt diet, ACEI mrna levels in the hypothalamus in dahl s rats were almost three-fold higher and in the pons two-fold higher than in dahl r rats on either diet or dahl s on regular salt diet.
[u'salt', u'salt']high salt diet also increased ACEI activity of the hypothalamus and pons in dahl s but not dahl r. consistent with this increased ACEI activity, central responses to angiotensin i were clearly enhanced and to bradykinin markedly diminished in dahl s on high salt intake.
[u'salt']fab fragments prevented the increases in blood pressure, ACEI mrna and activity in the hypothalamus and pons by high salt intake in dahl s rats.
[u'salt']in protocol i, ACEI (ACEI) mrna and activity and angiotensin i and ii levels were assessed in the hypothalamus and pons of dahl salt-sensitive (dahl s) and salt-resistant (dahl r) rats on regular (120 micromol na+ per g) or high (1370 micromol na+ per g) salt diet from 4-6 weeks or 4-9 weeks of age.
[u'salt']in protocol ii, ACEI mrna and activity were assessed in the hypothalamus and pons in dahl s on regular or high salt treated with intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.)
[u'salt']fab fragments blocking brain 'ouabain' or gamma-globulins, and in dahl r on high or regular salt ACEI mrna was assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) assay and angiotensin i and ii by radioimmunoassay after high-performance liquid chromatography.
[u'salt']therapy of acute exacerbations of congestive heart failure associated with obesity cardiomyopathy consists of dietary salt restriction, inspired oxygen, diuretics, and ACEI or, if left ventricular systolic dysfunction is present, hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate.
[u'water']furthermore, the basis of current therapies in these disorders is discussed, including beta-blockers, ACEI, angiotensin-receptor blockers, aldosterone antagonists, and diuretics in chf and cirrhosis, as well as new approaches to treatment of water retention with vasopressin v(2) receptor antagonists.
[u'salt']for this purpose, studied were the effects of blocking macula densa salt transport by the loop diuretic bumetanide (100 microm) on renal perfusate flow and on renin secretion in isolated perfused rats, in which renocortical cox-2 expression was prestimulated in vivo by treatment with the ACEI ramipril, with low-salt diet, or with a combination of both.
[u'water']to clarify the relative importance of the presence of the thiol group in the molecule versus ACEI (ACEI) inhibitory properties in the antithrombotic action of captopril, rats were treated with captopril (5 mg/kg twice daily; cap), epicaptopril (stereoisomer of captopril devoid of ACEI-inhibitory properties; 5 mg/kg twice daily; epi), n-acetylcysteine (3.75 mg/kg twice daily; acc), enalapril (3 mg/kg once daily; ena), or distilled water (veh) for 10 days, per os.
[u'salt']this large multicenter study, tested the antihypertensive effects of isradipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker and enalapril, an ACEI, in salt-sensitive hypertensive patients under low and high salt intake diets.
[u'salt']to elucidate the relationship between the renin-angiotensin system and et-1 in hypertensive heart failure, we evaluated the effects of long-term treatment with imidapril, an ACEI (ACEI) inhibitor, on preproet-1, endothelin a receptor (etar), and ACEI mrna expression in the left ventricle and evaluated these in relation to myocardial remodeling in the failing heart of dahl salt-sensitive (ds) hypertensive rats fed a high salt diet.
[u'rabbit']peptide maps of n. virens dcp from lysyl endopeptidase digestion were different from rabbit p-ACEI.
[u'rabbit', u'rabbit']the far-ultraviolet circular dichroic spectra of n. virens dcp indicated that the secondary structure of this enzyme seemed to be an alpha-helical structure and was similar to that of rabbit p-ACEI, but the near-ultraviolet circular dichroic spectra of n. virens dcp indicated that the aromatic amino acid residue circumambience of this enzyme was different from rabbit p-ACEI.
[u'shortening']ACEI inhibition blunted the negative effect of bk on myocyte velocity of shortening by over 60% (p <.05).
[u'salt']the rationale for delaying ACEI therapy is due in part to a perceived unique pathobiology in hypertensive african americans: an excess prevalence of salt sensitivity, hypervolemia, and low plasma renin activity (pra).
[u'rabbit']the effect of ACEI (ACEI) inhibitor, temocaprilat and/or angiotensin ii type 1 (at1) receptor antagonist, cv-11974 on myocardial metabolism and contraction during ischemia and reperfusion was examined by phosphorus 31-nuclear magnetic resonance (31p-nmr) in langendorff rabbit hearts.
[u'wheat']we report here the antihypertensive effect of wheat germ (wg) hydrolysate and its dominant peptide, ile-val-tyr (ivy), with potent angiotensin i-converting enzyme (ACEI) inhibitory activity.
[u'salt']higher daily doses, dietary salt restriction, and concomitant diuretic or ACEI administration amplify the antihypertensive effect of arbs.
[u'water']in this trial the effects of an ACEI (ACEI) inhibitor were quantified in sheep on restricted water intake.
[u'water', u'water']comparing the phase of water restriction only with that of water restriction plus ACEI inhibition, significant increases were observed during the latter phase in urine volume, sodium and potassium excretion via the urine, sodium concentration in the plasma and osmolar clearance.
[u'rabbit']the results indicate that renin inhibition in the rabbit with a high circulating angii level is more effective in lowering bp than ACEI inhibition.
[u'salt']the in vitro and in vivo inhibitory potency of omapatrilat and the specific ACEI fosinopril toward the 2 active sites of ACEI (called n- and c-domains) was investigated with the use of 3 substrates: angiotensin i, which is equally cleaved by the 2 ACEI domains; hippuryl-histidyl-leucine, specific synthetic substrate of the c-domain in high- salt conditions; and a newly synthesized specific substrate of the n-domain designed by acetylating the lysine residue of acsdkp.
[u'salt']during a 3-year period, patients received nonpharmacological treatment consisting of moderate salt restriction and a low-calorie diet they were obese, with or without a regimen of antihypertensive drugs based on beta-blockers or ACEI.
[u'shortening']oral activity, achieved by shortening the original peptide structures, transformed the probes into therapeutic agents, the ACEI (ACEI) inhibitors.
[u'rabbit']the effect of an endothelin (et) a/etb receptor antagonist, tak-044, and/or an ACEI (ACEI) inhibitor, temocaprilat, on myocardial metabolism and contraction during ischemia and reperfusion was examined by phosphorus 31-nuclear magnetic resonance (31p-nmr) in langendorff rabbit hearts.
[u'salt']these data suggest that clinical, genetic, or environmental factors (such as salt intake and medications) that alter ACEI activity and ang ii production would be expected to impact on clotting and fibrinolytic mechanisms.
[u'whey']whey protein digests gave a 50% inhibition (ic50) of ACEI activity at concentration ranges within 345-1733 micrograms/ml.
[u'water']this study determined whether chronic treatment with s21402 produced different effects on sodium and water excretion, hormonal parameters, and cardiovascular structure compared with selective inhibition of ACEI and nep in a rat model of myocardial infarction-induced congestive heart failure (chf).
[u'rabbit']it had an estimated molecular weight of 180 000 and was recognized by the anti-ACEI antibody for the rabbit testicular ACEI in immunoblots.
[u'water']myocardial blood flow was analyzed in ischemic and nonischemic regions of 10 symptomatic patients with coronary artery disease using repetitive [15o] water positron emission tomography at rest and during maximal dobutamine stress before and after ACEI inhibition with quinaprilat 10 mg i.v.
[u'water']therefore, submaximal ACEI inhibition enhanced sodium excretion mainly by increasing rbf and gfr, whereas submaximal at1 receptor blockade decreased tubular sodium and water reabsorption.
[u'wheat']reported is the preparation of wheat germ (wg) hydrolyzate with potent angiotensin i-converting enzyme (ACEI) inhibitory activity, and the characterization of peptides responsible for ACEI inhibition.
[u'salt']in the present study, we tested for endosomal ang i, ang ii, angiotensin type 1a receptor (at(1a)), and ACEI (ACEI) activity and determined whether these levels are regulated by salt intake.
[u'shortening', u'shortening']we assessed the prevalence and predictors of patients with idc that showed marked reverse remodeling (a decrease in lv end-diastolic dimension > or = 5 mm to a final lv end-diastolic dimension < or = 55 mm and an increase in percent lv fractional shortening > or = 5% to a final percent fractional shortening of > or = 25% and a decrease in lv mass > or = 10%) after 2 years of intensive therapy with ACEI and/or beta blockers.
[u'water']in the third series of novel experiments, the ACEI perindopril was given in drinking water for 7 days (0.3 mg. kg(-1) x day(-1)), either alone (n=6) or combined with an intravenous infusion of a-779 (24 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1) for 7 days, n=8).
[u'rabbit']uptake of the ACEI (ACEI) inhibitor enalapril by rabbit small intestinal brush border membrane vesicles was examined.
[u'rabbit']the inhibitory effects of five ACEI (ACEI) inhibitors on the uptake of an aminocephalosporin antibiotic, cefroxadine, by rabbit small intestinal brush-border membrane vesicles were examined in the presence of an inward h+ gradient.
[u'corn']we investigated the relationship between angiotensin ii formation and the development of atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta of monkeys (macaca fascicularis) fed a high-cholesterol (4% cholesterol and 6% corn oil) diet for 6 months, and studied the effects of an ACEI (ACEI) inhibitor, trandolapril (10 mg kg-1 per day, p.o.
[u'salt', u'salt']we report two cases of hyperkalaemia related to the use of the salt substitute 'lo salt' in hypertensive patients on treatment with ACEI.
[u'salt']without vigilance the contribution of the salt substitute to hyperkalaemia would have been overlooked and an ACEI erroneously withdrawn.
[u'whey', u'whey']studies with gastric and pancreatic proteinase digests of whey proteins indicate that enzyme specificity rather than extent of hydrolysis dictates the ACEI inhibitory potency of whey hydrolysates.
[u'date']this review aims to give an overview of the research to date assessing the impact of the ACEI polymorphism in type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (dm).
[u'salt']we have previously shown that in renal cortex, cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2) expression is localized to the macula densa and surrounding cortical thick ascending limb and increases in high-renin states, such as salt restriction and ACEI inhibition.
[u'rabbit']to shed light on mechanisms of ACEI (ACEI) upregulation, we used a rabbit endothelial cell model to characterize intracellular pathways of beta-adrenergic stimulation.
[u'water']ACEI inhibition was obtained with captopril (100 mg/kg/24 h in the drinking water of the breeders) because this compound crosses the placental barrier.
[u'rabbit']ACEI inhibition with quinaprilat promotes angiogenesis in a rabbit model of hindlimb ischemia.
[u'salt']in humans, renin inhibition led to a larger increase in renal plasma flow in healthy human volunteers studied on a low salt diet to activate the renin system than did ACEI.
[u'water']the ACEI blocker was dissolved in the drinking water and supplied to 24 and 32 week old shrsp ad libitum for 5 weeks.
[u'water', u'salt']ACEI are indicated to counteract the vasoconstriction and salt and water retention associated with activation of the ras.
[u'whey']whey protein was digested with one of seven kinds of proteases at 37 degrees c (trypsin, proteinase k, actinase e, thermolysin, or papain) or at 25 degrees c (pepsin or chymotrypsin) for 24 h. the digested samples were assayed for the inhibitory activity of ACEI and for changes in the systolic blood pressure caused in spontaneously hypertensive rats after gastric intubation.
[u'water']an ACEI (fosinopril, 10 mg/kg per day) was added in drinking water and the angiotensin ii subtype 1 receptor antagonist losartan (3.5 microg/kg per min) was co-infused via the minipump.
[u'salt']however, it is controversial as to whether kinins oppose the hypertensinogenic effect of deoxycorticosterone acetate plus salt (doca-salt) or aortic coarctation and whether they mediate both chronic antihypertensive and cardiac antihypertrophic effects of ACEI in hypertension.
[u'salt']in contrast, the renal vasodilatory responses to ACEI inhibition in dogs on low salt intake were markedly dependent on the activation of bk b2 receptors.
[u'rabbit']moreover, these new b1 antagonists were found to be resistant to in vitro degradation by purified ACEI from rabbit lung.
[u'rabbit']the findings indicate that suppression of the renin-angiotensin system by at1 receptor blockade in a genetically hypercholesterolemic rabbit model causes comparable inhibition of aortic atherosclerosis as that achieved by ACEI inhibition, and that a mild reduction of blood pressure induced by both classes of agents may contribute to their antiatherosclerotic action in this model.
[u'shortening']myocyte shortening velocity increased with ACEI or combination treatment (36.9+/-0.7 v 42.3+/-0.8 microm/s, respectively, p < .05).
[u'water']rats with and without autoimmune heymann nephritis were treated with a no synthase inhibitor l-name (50 mg/100 ml) and/or an ACEI captopril (20 mg/100 ml) in drinking water for 12 weeks.
[u'salt', u'salt', u'salt']thus, the mean morning pai-1 antigen concentration was significantly higher during low salt intake than during either high salt intake or low salt intake and concomitant ACEI inhibition (22.7+/-4.6 versus 16.
[u'rabbit']studies were performed in rabbit renal brush border membrane vesicles in which the uptake of [14c]glycylsarcosine (glysar), at low substrate concentrations, was examined in the absence and presence of quinapril (and other ACEI).
[u'water']the intake of 0.3 m nacl and water was induced by combined administration of the diuretic, furosemide (furo), and the ACEI, captopril (cap).
[u'salt']it has been suggested that combined inhibition of ACEI (ACEI) and neutral endopeptidase (nep) may lower blood pressure more effectively than either treatment alone, independent of the degree of salt and volume status or the activity of the renin-angiotensin system.
[u'rabbit']in a rabbit model of atherosclerosis, we evaluated the effect of the ACEI quinapril on different parameters implicated in the pathogenesis of the plaque, such as the presence of chemokines (interleukin-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), collagen i, and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation (pdgf-b).
[u'water', u'salt', u'salt']the ACEI restores the renal-adrenal response to salt loading, whereas the calcium antagonist possesses intrinsic natriuretic properties through poorly described mechanisms of inhibiting renal tubular salt and water reabsorption.
[u'water']the physiological state associated with water and sodium ingestion was produced by the concurrent subcutaneous administration of the diuretic furosemide (10 mg/kg) and a low dose of the ACEI (ACEI) inhibitor captopril (5 mg/kg; furo/cap treatment).
[u'rabbit']a biochemical study was performed in order to analyse the effect of the no-donors, sin-1 and diethylamine/no (dea/no), and of an aqueous solution of nitric oxide on the ACEI activity in plasma from 3-month old male sprague-dawley rats and on ACEI purified from rabbit lung.
[u'salt']moreover, diazonium salt of sulfanilic acid (dasa), a membrane-impermeable ACEI, inhibited ACEI activity in intact cells and in cell lysates at the same extent, thus implying that intracellular ACEI is inactive.
[u'salt']we compared the antihypertensive effect of an ACEI (enalapril 5 or 20 mg bid) or a calcium channel antagonist (isradipine 5 or 10 mg bid) during alternating periods of high and low salt intake.
[u'water']in a group of animals given the ACEI enalapril (enal; 100 mg/l) in their drinking water for 4 wk, beginning 1 wk before bea injection, creatinine clearance improved significantly (bea 0.33 versus enal + bea 0.52 ml/min per 100 g body wt, p = 0.01) and albumin excretion fell to zero.
[u'rabbit']species- and/or age-related differences in the kinin-metabolism could explain these results, suggesting that in the newborn rabbit other kininases than ACEI are mainly responsible for the degradation of bradykinin.
[u'water']ACEI (ACEI) inhibitor enalaprilat in 10 critically ill patients, being ventilated with positive end-expiratory pressure (peep), on sodium and water excretion was investigated.
[u'salt']1 in spontaneously hypertensive rat (shr) we examined over a 4-week period the influence of control low sodium diet, common salt-enriched diet (sodium chloride 6% of the dry weight of the chow) and a novel mineral salt-enriched diet (potassium-, magnesium-, and l-lysine-enriched mineral salt added at a 75% higher level of 10.5% to produce the same sodium chloride concentration of 6%) on the cardiovascular effects produced by a low-dose combination of an ACEI ramipril (0.25 mg kg(-1) day(-1) in the food) and a calcium channel blocker felodipine (0.4 mg kg(-1) day(-1) subcutaneously via an osmotic minipump).
[u'water']we investigated whether ACEI-inhibitors interfere with the action of the renin-angiotensin system on the nephron, and therefore with water and urinary electrolytes excretion.
[u'rabbit']the relative importance of ACEI in the cardiac metabolism of bk was species related: dog (68.4 +/- 3.2%) = human (72.2 +/- 2.0%) > rabbit (47.7 +/- 5.0%) = rat (45.3 +/- 3.9%).
[u'rabbit']ACEI participation in the metabolism of des-arg9-bk was as follows: rabbit (57.0 +/- 4.0%) > dog (39.9 +/- 8.8%) = human (25.4 +/- 5.5%) = rat (36.0 +/- 7.0%).
[u'water']very high ACEI activity was found in ovary of water frog (rana esculenta) compared with other frog tissues, and this activity was inhibited by the typical ACEI, captopril and lisinopril.
[u'water']maximum tgf responses were 8.9 +/- 1.0 and 17.5 +/- 1.5 mmhg in 11- and 26-week-old rats that had been treated with the ACEI-i lisinopril in the drinking water started when the animals were 7 weeks of age.
[u'shortening']multiple regression analysis was performed to select independent variables associated with sdnn from the following 14 variables: age, sex, body mass index before hemodialysis, presence of ischemic heart disease, diabetic nephropathy as primary renal disease, smoking, duration of hemodialysis, mean blood pressure before hemodialysis, left ventricular mass index and fraction shortening in echocardiography, use of beta blockers, use of ACEI, hematocrit, and blood urea nitrogen.
[u'salt']experimentally it can be shown that inhibiting ACEI but preventing the fall in systemic blood pressure by salt loading abolishes renoprotection.
[u'water']ACEI inhibition attenuates the effects of atrial natriuretic factor on renal sodium and water handling; however, it is not known whether this effect is mediated by the accompanied decrease in blood pressure or by suppression of the renin-angiotensin system.
[u'water']of the ACEI captopril and 6 were given water with 30 mg./kg.
[u'rabbit']two series of analogues of the tetrapeptide nacsdkp, an inhibitor of hematopoietic stem cell proliferation, were prepared, and their enzymatic stability toward rabbit lung ACEI (ACEI) was evaluated as well as their capacity to inhibit nacsdkp hydrolysis by this enzyme.
[u'rabbit']we compared the ic50 values of this compound with those of several chymotrypsin-like serine proteinases (bovine alpha-chymotrypsin, recombinant human chymase and human neutrophil cathepsin g) and a metallo proteinase, rabbit ACEI (ACEI).
[u'rabbit']however, rabbit ACEI was not inhibited by this compound (ic50 > 1 x 10(-4) m).
[u'rabbit']to investigate whether angiotensin ii has a role in the regulation of bladder smooth muscle growth and function, we developed a model of bladder neck obstruction (bno) in the neonatal rabbit and investigated the effect of captopril (ACEI) on the obstructive changes in the developing bladder.
[u'salt', u'salt']our findings indicate that: (1) niddm with hypertension is associated with reduced rpf when dietary salt intake is high, (2) reduced ang ii formation is the dominant mechanism of ACEI-induced renal vasodilation in hypertensives with niddm; and (3) the sustained renal hemodynamic responses to ACEI inhibition despite high-salt balance, and the increased pra suggest an autonomous renin-angiotensin system suppressed subnormally by a high salt diet in patients with niddm despite greater volume expansion.
[u'rabbit']we have investigated whether this is a specific effect of the ACEI class of compounds in isolated endothelium-denuded segments of the rabbit jugular vein where bradykinin elicits a constrictor response which is exclusively mediated by activation of the b2 receptor.
[u'rabbit']ramiprilat did not alter the binding of [3h]-bradykinin to a membrane fraction prepared from endothelium-denuded rabbit jugular veins or to cultured fibroblasts, and there was no ACEI-sensitive, bradykinin-induced cleavage of the b2 receptor in cultured endothelial cells.
[u'water']in the present study we assessed the effect of captopril, an ACEI, on the voluntary consumption of 10% ethanol solution, water and solid food in our strain of rats genetically selected for their voluntary consumption of ethanol, namely ucha (low consumer) and uchb (high consumer).
[u'shortening']myocyte shortening velocity increased with ACEI or combination treatment compared with rapid pacing only (36.9+/-0.7 and 42.3+/-0.8 microm/s, respectively, p<.05).
[u'water']in these rats, pd 155080 reduced bp during 5 treatment days, and this antihypertensive effect was not altered by coadministration of the ACEI enalapril in the drinking water (508 micromol/l [250 mg/l]).
[u'rabbit']we investigated the possible effects of the ACEI (ACEI) inhibitor cilazapril and angiotensin ii antagonist saralasin on ovulation, ovarian steroidogenesis and ascites formation in the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (ohss) in the rabbit model.
[u'water']young (approximately 1 month old) male normotensive wistar-kyoto rats (n=26) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (n=38) were randomized into three groups treated via drinking water for approximately 2 years with, respectively, placebo, low doses, or high doses of an ACEI, ramipril (10 microg x kg[-1] x d[-1], non-blood pressure-lowering dose, or 1 mg x kg[-1] x d[-1], blood pressure-lowering dose).
[u'buffalo']hieace, a soluble 70 kda protein related to the ACEI (ACEI) has recently been identified, characterized and cloned from the adult buffalo fly (haematobia irritans exigua).
[u'rabbit']effects of ACEI (ACEI) inhibitors, captopril, enalapril maleate and quinapril, on the uptake of aminocephalosporin antibiotic, cefroxadine, by rabbit small intestinal brush border membrane vesicles were examined.
[u'water']an ACEI was administered in the drinking water for 6 weeks (spirapril 5 mg/kg bw).
[u'date']although not yet fully published, these results provide the most convincing evidence to date for an effect of an ACEI in retinopathy.
[u'shortening', u'shortening']nine pediatric symptomatic patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus with elevated pulmonary arterial pressure (mpa pressure) and ejection fraction (ef); and with fractional shortening, (fs) mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (mvcfc) and left ventricular peak systolic wall stress (ps) were prospectively evaluated using 2-dimensional and m-mode serial echocardiography and doppler cardiography after administration of an ACEI (inhibace 0.025 mg/kg/d orally) for 12 weeks.
[u'water']we estimated effective atomic contact energies (ACEI), the desolvation free energies required to transfer atoms from water to a protein's interior, using an adaptation of a method introduced by s. miyazawa and r. l. jernigan.
[u'shortening']we report the effects of acute and chronic (8 weeks) treatment with the ACEI perindopril (per, 2-->4 mg daily) or placebo (p) in a double-blind parallel group study of 24 diuretic treated patients (17m; 67 +/- 8 years, 80 +/- 17 kg) with ischaemic cardiomyopathy (fractional shortening, 19 +/- 5%; radionuclide ejection fraction, 31 +/- 3%).
[u'salt']we evaluated the role of the renin-angiotensin system in s.r-ren and s rats fed a 0.05% salt diet by examining differences between strains in (1) expression of renin in three tissue types, (2) the blood-pressure response to blockade of both ACEI and angiotensin ii receptors, and (3) pressure natriuresis.
[u'water', u'water']rats were treated for 1 week with the ACEI perindopril (1 mg/kg) via the drinking water, whereas the controls were given water alone.
[u'shortening']however, systolic performance, as assessed by midwall fractional fibre shortening, was significantly improved by ACEI only.
[u'salt']measurements were obtained during absence of treatment (control), treatment with dietary salt restriction plus an inhibitor of ACEI (2.5 mg of lisinopril, po, daily) and treatment with an inhibitor of nitric oxide production (0.1% l-name in the drinking water).
[u'shortening']however, with ACEI--28, myocyte shortening velocity was increased compared to rec (56 +/- 1 microns/s, p < 0.05).
[u'rabbit']in vitro, moexiprilat was a potent inhibitor of ACEI in guinea pig serum as well as on purified ACEI from rabbit lung with ic50 values of 2.6 and 4.9 nmol/l, respectively.
[u'rabbit']both, moexipril and moexiprilat inhibited the angiotensin i (ang i)-induced contractions of rabbit aorta concentration-dependently, whereas contractions by other agents were not affected, indicating a high selectivity of both compounds for ACEI.
[u'water']in hooded wistar rats, over 5 days of training in a water maze neither the ACEI, ceranapril 5 and 50 micrograms/kg/day, nor the ACEI, ramipril 2 and 10 mg/kg/day, altered the increase in path length produced by administration of scopolamine 0.75 mg/kg/day.
[u'water']when captopril, an ACEI, was administered intravenously after and during exp 3174, an additional increase in renal blood flow, by +8%, with no change in glomerular filtration rate was seen which led to an additional decrease in filtration fraction by -5%; additional increases were observed in water and urea but not in sodium and potassium excretion rates.
[u'shortening']to study the cellular mechanism of the effects of long-term ACEI inhibition on the modification of the transition to failure in pressure-overload hypertrophy, we measured simultaneous intracellular ca2+ transients and myocyte shortening in isolated left ventricular myocytes from fosinopril-treated aortic-banded rats (n = 9), untreated aortic-banded rats (n = 9), and normal age-matched control rats (n = 10).
[u'rabbit']we investigated a putative local angiotensin ii (angii) system in the rabbit retina by examining angii contents in the retina, vitreous humor, and choroid by radioimmunoassays and angii synthesis in the retina and choroid by detection of ACEI (ACEI) mrna.
[u'salt']moreover, reduction in salt intake has a permissive action on the antiproteinuric responses of ACEI and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.
[u'rabbit']we also incubated the compounds with purified ACEI from rabbit lung to test their resistance to degradation.
[u'shortening', u'shortening', u'shortening']with an ACEI: in group a, left ventricular dimensions fell at end diastole (p < 0.05) and end systole (p < 0.01) but fractional shortening did not change; long axis total excursion (p < 0.01) and peak rate of shortening (p < 0.05) both increased; ivrt increased (p < 0.001) with the appearance of markedly incoordinate wall motion, minor axis lengthening, and long axis shortening (p < 0.001 for both); a wave amplitude also consistently increased (p < 0.001); finally, transmitral e wave velocity fell and a wave velocity increased.
[u'cocktail']risk factors for development of arf despite cocktail administration included the presence of diabetes mellitus and ACEI (ACEI) inhibitor therapy.
[u'water']in male sprague dawley rats with left ventricular hypertrophy (lvh) and hypertension induced by aortic constriction (ac) and subsequent myocardial infarction (mi) by occlusion of the left coronary artery the effects of ACEI inhibition with ramipril (ra 1 mg/kg/day via the drinking water during 6 weeks) on survival as well as cardiac function and metabolism were investigated.
[u'rabbit']in conclusion, our data provide evidence for a greater influence of ACEI in rabbit basilar artery than in peripheral vessels.
[u'salt']for this purpose, uninephrectomized rats received doca and high salt diet, and when hypertension was installed, they were treated for 5 weeks with either a long-acting calcium antagonist, mibefradil (30 mg/kg/day), an ACEI, enalapril (3 mg/kg/day), or a mixed eta and etb endothelin receptor antagonist, bosentan (100 mg/kg/day).
[u'spread']earlier and more wide spread use of ACEI in nigerian and black africans with chronic heart failure is now clearly indicated.
[u'water', u'salt']to study tissue-specific regulation of the expression of the at1 receptor in the rat, we altered activity of the renin-angiotensin system by feeding rats a low (0.07% nacl), normal (0.3% nacl), or high (7.5% nacl) salt chow for 14 days; infusing ang ii (200 ng/kg per minute ip) or vehicle for 7 days; and administering an ACEI (captopril, 100 mg/dl in the drinking water) or vehicle for 7 days.
[u'salt']human plasma renin concentration increased in response to both ACEI inhibition with captopril and isoproterenol and decreased after a high salt diet.
[u'water']background: in congestive heart failure with water retention, subtraction of body fluid by ultrafiltration causes greater diuresis and clinical improvement in patients who are ACEI (ACEI)-inhibited, suggesting an influence of ACEI on fluid metabolism.
[u'rabbit']using in vitro transfected cell culture systems, we previously demonstrated that the rabbit testicular isozyme of ACEI (acet), which shares extensive homology with acep, is first synthesized as a plasma membrane-anchored ectoprotein and then secreted to the culture medium by cleavage removal of its cooh-terminal membrane-anchored tail.
[u'rabbit']we have now investigated whether this is an effect of the ACEI class of compounds by studying the bradykinin-induced vasoconstriction in isolated segments of the rabbit jugular vein.
[u'rabbit']these findings demonstrate that ACEI selectively potentiate the b2 receptor-mediated constrictor response to bradykinin in the rabbit jugular vein, possibly by increasing the affinity of the b2 receptor.
[u'salt']uninephrectomized rats received doca, a high salt diet, and when hypertension was installed, they were treated for 6 weeks with either a long-acting calcium antagonist, mibefradil (30 mg/kg day-1), an ACEI, enalapril (3 mg/kg day-1), or a mixed eta-etb endothelin receptor antagonist, bosentan (100 mg/kg day-1).
[u'salt']we examined the renal protective effect of the combined therapy with calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) and ACEI (enalapril) against hypertensive renal injury in 5/6 nephrectomized spontaneously hypertensive rats (shrs) with salt loading, comparing with monotherapy of each drug.
[u'water']theoretically, administering of ACEI can enhance sodium and water retention in cirrhotic patients with ascites.
[u'water']results in this study demonstrate that inhibition of ACEI alone may not improve sodium and water retention in cirrhotic patients with ascites.
[u'date']thus, the trial results to date do not suggest that nitrates are ineffective for remodeling, but rather that ACEI can confer added benefit.
[u'water']this study investigated the effects of bilateral injections of serotonergic receptor agonist and antagonist into the lateral parabrachial nucleus (lpbn) on the ingestion of water and 0.3 m nacl induced by intracerebroventricular angiotensin ii (ang ii) or by combined subcutaneous injections of the diuretic furosemide (furo) and the ACEI captopril (cap).
[u'rabbit']because recent data suggest that no may modulate some features of endothelial cells and because endothelial cells are involved in the control of intimal hyperplasia, we investigated the role of no synthesis in the effect of an ACEI, perindopril, on neoendothelial dysfunction and intimal hyperplasia in a rabbit model of unilateral iliac balloon injury.
[u'rabbit']perturbed angular correlation of gamma-rays (pac) spectroscopy has been used to investigate the angiotensin-i-converting enzyme (ACEI) of rabbit lung.
[u'shortening']however, ACEI inhibition does not enhance ventricular segmental shortening acutely despite improved microvascular endothelial function and augmented postischemic coronary blood flow in this model of ischemia-reperfusion.
[u'salt']this study was designed to ascertain whether salt sensitivity of bp is a determinant of bp and renal vascular responsiveness to ACEI (ACEI) inhibition.
[u'salt']the magnitude of the bp and renal vascular response to ACEI inhibition was not influenced by the sensitivity of bp to salt intake.
[u'salt']in a multivariate analysis neither body mass index nor age influenced the bp response to ACEI inhibition or the relationships between salt intake and a bp response to ACEI inhibition.
[u'salt']we conclude that the factors that influence sensitivity of bp to salt intake do not influence the systemic or renal hemodynamic response to ACEI inhibition.
[u'cocktail']a cocktail of bestatin or leuhistin (inhibitors of aminopeptidases), phosphoramidon, and captopril (an inhibitor of ACEI) protected met-enkephalin from degradation (recovery > 95%) in caudate-putamen.
[u'rabbit']in vitro, moexiprilat exhibited a higher inhibitory potency than enalaprilat against both plasma ACEI and purified ACEI from rabbit lung.
[u'shortening']with rvp/ACEI, myocyte length was reduced (169 +/- 1 micron) and velocity of shortening was increased (45 +/- 1 micron/s) compared with rvp values (p < .05).
[u'shortening']myocyte velocity of shortening after beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation with 25 nmol/l isoproterenol was reduced with rvp compared with control values (142 +/- 5 versus 193 +/- 8 micron/s, p < .05) and significantly improved with rvp/ACEI (166 +/- 6 micron/s, p < .05).
[u'water']in conclusion, ACEI inhibition can prevent the otherwise obligatory na and water retention and systemic mabp increase during a 20% reduction in renal perfusion pressure.
[u'rabbit']we investigated the effects of ACEI on acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the presence of nitroglycerin tolerance in rings of rabbit thoracic aorta mounted in tissue baths and precontracted with 10(-6) m norepinephrine.
[u'rabbit']finally, in vitro cleavage-secretion of the other isozyme of ACEI, acep, by membranes isolated from rabbit lungs was strongly inhibited by compound 3.
[u'rabbit']the purpose of this experiment was to determine whether use of the ACEI (ACEI) inhibitor, enalapril, would prevent the occurrence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (ohss) in the rabbit model.
[u'rabbit']ACEI inhibition resulted in a 40% decrease in the incidence of ohss in the rabbit model.
[u'casein']pulmonary and plasma ACEI activity were determined in rats of different ages, following in utero exposure to 18 (control) or 9% (deficient) casein diets.
[u'casein']no maternal diet induced changes in pulmonary ACEI were noted, but at 4 and 13 weeks of age, plasma ACEI activity was increased by 34 and 134%, respectively in 9% casein exposed rats relative to controls (p < 0.001).
[u'water', u'water']half of the animals of each group drunk plain water while the other half was provided water enriched with the ACEI enalapril (ena) at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day.
[u'rabbit']the distribution of ACEI was examined in the rabbit brain by in vitro autoradiography with the specific radiolabelled inhibitor 125i-351a.
[u'rabbit']ACEI (ACEI) is more widely distributed in rabbit brain that in rat, human and macaca fascicularis, and the results suggest ACEI has a very general role in the metabolism of neuropeptides.
[u'water']five-week-old bio14.6 cardiomyopathic hamsters were treated with the ACEI captopril (20 mg/kg per day) or the aldosterone antagonist k-canrenoate (20 mg/kg per day) in drinking water for 20 weeks, and the collagen concentration and type i/iii ratio at 25 weeks were compared with those in 25-week-old untreated bio14.6 and normal f1b hamsters.
[u'water']the angiotensin i converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) perindopril (2 mg/kg body weight), the peripheral vasodilator dihydralazine (dhl) (25 mg/kg body weight) or distilled water was given daily from birth to day 14 to neonatal rats.
[u'salt']we compared the response of the oral angiotensin ii (ang ii) receptor antagonist (ara) up 269-6 with an ACEI enalapril 20 mg or placebo, during salt depletion in normal men.
[u'rabbit']the data suggest that the antiatherosclerotic action of ACEI in the whhl rabbit may not be related directly to arterial enzyme inhibition.
[u'rabbit', u'salt']rabbits were treated with either ACEI or a low salt diet to modulate endogenous ang ii levels.
[u'water', u'salt']the history of the treatment of heart failure may be divided into three stages, the consequences of different conceptions of the physiopathology of the disease, with diuretics to counteract salt and water retention, vasodilators to improve conditions of cardiac load, ACEI to limit the effect of neurotumoral and sympathetic activation.
[u'water']we investigated the effects of ramipril, an angiotensin i-converting enzyme (ACEI) inhibitor, on water intake by male holtzman rats (250-300 g) with cannulae implanted into the lateral ventricle.
[u'water']simultaneous administration of the diuretic furosemide (10 mg/kg) and a low dose of the ACEI (ACEI) inhibitor captopril (5 mg/kg) results in short-latency thirst and sodium appetite (i.e., the rapid ingestion of water and nacl solution).
[u'water', u'salt']at least theoretically, ACEI-inhibitors may influence each of the factors involved in the regulation of salt and water metabolism.
[u'rabbit']we have identified ACEI, neutral endopeptidase-24.11, and aminopeptidase m in a purified glycoprotein fraction of rabbit skeletal muscle membranes.
[u'water', u'water']in all three diet groups, subgroups were formed drinking either tap water or water containing either the ACEI enalapril (ena) or the calcium antagonist diltiazem (dil), or both (ena + dil).
[u'salt']the aim of this study was to determine the participation of endogenous bradykinin (bk) in the antihypertensive effects of the ACEI, perindoprilat, in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (shr) on different salt diets.
[u'salt']these harmful effects of salt were blocked by the thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide but not by the ACEI enalapril.
[u'water']to evaluate the effects of ACEI inhibition on renal aging, enalapril was administered in the drinking water to three groups of cf1 mice at doses of 20 mg/l (group a), 10 mg/l (group b), and 5 mg/l (group c).
[u'sake', u'sake']nine peptides to inhibit angiotensin i converting enzyme (ACEI) were isolated from sake and sake lees.
[u'water']low and high doses of ACEI (ACEI) inhibitors have been shown either to enhance or suppress, respectively, the water intake of rats induced by acute administration of isoproterenol.
[u'water']the data are discussed in terms of access of ACEI to the brain, and interactions with structures involved in ang-related water intake.
[u'salt']this assertion depends partly on an experiment that suppressed salt appetite using an intravenous infusion of a dose of ACEI (ACEI) inhibitor (captopril, 2.5 mg/h) that supposedly blocked both central and peripheral enzyme (17).
[u'water']in congestive heart failure the set point of fluid balance is altered despite oral furosemide; supplemental iv furosemide does not shift the set point, at least in the presence of ACEI-inhibition; excessive, although silent, lung water limits the functional capacity of the patient.
[u'shortening']enalapril increased lv fractional shortening (fs%) (13.3 +/- 5.6 to 15.4 +/- 5.8, p < 0.05) and decreased the systolic time interval index (0.58 +/- 0.14 to 0.48 +/- 0.15, p < 0.05) concurrent with a significant decrease in ACEI activity and in aldosterone, angiotensin-ii, and norepinephrine concentrations after 6 weeks.
[u'water', u'water']in all three diet groups, subgroups drinking either tap water or water containing either the ACEI-inhibitor enalapril (ena) or the calcium antagonist diltiazem (dil) or both (ena+dil) were formed.
[u'water']we examined the dose-related effects of ACEI on circulating and tissue levels of angiotensin and bradykinin peptides by administering perindopril or lisinopril to rats in drinking water for 7 days.
[u'water']ACEI may act by normalizing electrolyte and water balance, improving vascular endothelial function, and reversing structural changes in peripheral vessels.
[u'water', u'salt']diuretic resistance was defined as: failure to lose weight and/or inappropriate urinary sodium excretion (50 mmol 24 h-1) despite bed rest for a period of 2-3 days, salt and water restriction, orally and intravenously administered furosemide in a dose of 250 mg day-1, digoxin, and when possible an ACEI.
[u'water']separate groups of pan rats with similar degree of glomerulosclerosis, assessed at 16 weeks after pan by renal biopsy, were then treated as follows: ACEI [50 mg/liter drinking water (dw), or 200 mg/liter dw], ang iira (20 mg/liter dw, or 80 mg/liter dw) or no treatment, starting after renal biopsy.
[u'rabbit']in the present study, we investigated the role of n- and o-glycosylation in intracellular transport and extracellular cleavage-secretion of rabbit testicular ACEI.
[u'sugar']sugar modifications of ACEI were analyzed by testing its sensitivity to specific glycosidases.
[u'salt']in contrast, chronic salt loading or inhibition of ACEI by perindopril significantly increased binding not only to the cortical sites but also to the sites in the inner stripe of the outer medulla.
[u'sugar']protein restriction, tight control of blood sugar and blood pressure, and specific therapy with ACEI have been shown independently to reduce microalbuminuria and preserve renal function in these patients.
[u'water']simultaneous administration of the diuretic furosemide (10 mg/kg sc) and a low dose of the ACEI captopril (5 mg/kg sc) reduced mean arterial blood pressure (map) and increased ingestion of water and 0.3 m nacl within 2 h. administration of either agent alone did not reduce map or cause significant fluid intakes.
[u'salt']for example, doca treatment led to increased ACEI activity in the heart and the kidney only if the rats were maintained on a high salt intake.
[u'salt']increased dietary intake of regular salt (sodium chloride) interferes markedly with the therapeutic effects of ACEI.
[u'rabbit']mouse epithelial cells transfected with rabbit testicular ACEI cdna, synthesize, glycosylate, and secrete ACEI by cleavage processing of its membrane-anchoring carboxyl-terminal region.
[u'date']to summarize, it has been confirmed to date that systemic antihypertensive therapy slows the progression of renal failure of any etiology, and there is initial proof that ACEI are superior to other antihypertensive agents in this respect.
[u'water']it is suggested that by inhibiting kininase ii, ACEI extend the duration of action of bradykinin and thereby unmask a potent inhibition of alcohol intake mediated by kinins--an effect that is dissociable from the accompanying stimulation of water intake.
[u'salt']to evaluate whether ACEI and vasodilators have different effects on salt sensitivity of bp in humans, we compared the effect of the ACEI cilazapril and the vasodilator dihydralazine on the renal function curve in a randomized prospective single blind cross-over study.
[u'salt']the results document that bp reduction after acute ACEI inhibition is a function of salt intake, i.e.
[u'rabbit']we directly tested this hypothesis by substituting tyr-236 with phe and lys-154 with glu in rabbit testicular ACEI (acet) using site-directed mutagenesis of the corresponding cdna.
[u'rabbit']western blot analysis of bbecs, tracheal and bronchial mucosal strips utilizing a cross-reacting rabbit anti-mouse ACEI antibody, showed a faint 175 kda band and additional strong 52 kda and 47 kda band.
[u'date']up to date it remains unsettled which patients may benefit from acute therapy with ACEI-inhibitors.
[u'rabbit']in this study, captopril (an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor; ACEI) and mpg, and the non-sulfhydryl compound enalaprilat (also an ACEI) were tested for their ability to protect the isolated perfused rabbit heart against complement-induced injury.
[u'water']ACEI inhibition reduced the blood pressure of wky and shr, and augmented their intake of water and output of urine.
[u'rabbit']it was reported recently that n-1-(r,s)carboxy-3-phenylpropyl-ala-ala-phe-p-carboxyanilide (cpp-a-a-f-pab), an inhibitor of endopeptidase 3.4.24.15 (e-24.15), also inhibits ACEI (ACEI) from rabbit lung.
[u'rabbit']we examined the mechanisms whereby phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (pma)-activated rabbit peritoneal neutrophils [polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn)] altered endothelial-bound ACEI (ACEI) activity in cultured bovine pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (ec).
[u'salt']when pmn were coincubated with pma (10 ng/ml) for 4 h in earle's salt solution, endothelial ACEI activity was decreased by 87%.
[u'water']six control and twenty-five streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were divided into 4 group: group i consisted of non-diabetic control rats administered a 40% protein diet (n = 6); group ii, diabetic rats administered a 40% protein diet (n = 8); group iii, diabetic rats treated with a 10% protein diet (n = 8), and group iv, diabetic rats treated together with a 10% protein diet and ad lib, drinking water containing 0.75 mg/l of ACEI (n = 9).
[u'water']chronic peripheral treatments with low doses of the ACEI, captopril, enhance daily intakes of dilute ethanol solutions in rats as they do the intakes of water and saline solutions.
[u'water', u'arepa']the effect of lisinopril, a potent inhibitor of ACEI (ACEI), injected into the medial preoptic area (mpoa) on water intake was investigated in male holtzman rats (200-250 g).
[u'rabbit']to examine the possibility that guinea pig ACEI has a superior catalytic efficiency, we purified it to apparent homogeneity and compared it to highly purified forms of ACEI from human seminal plasma, rat lungs and rabbit lungs.
[u'rabbit']second order rate constants (kcat/km) for guinea pig, human and rabbit forms of ACEI on reaction with benzoyl-phe-ala-pro were identical (1.6e-09 m-1 min-1).
[u'sauce', u'soy sauce']the inhibitory activity of an angiotensin i-converting enzyme (ACEI) detected in soy sauce was fractionated into two major fractions of high molecular weight (hw) and low molecular weight (lw) by gel filtration chromatography on bio-gel p-2 after treating with ethanol.
[u'water', u'water']separate groups of rats were then administered the angiotensin receptor antagonists, a-81988 or losartan (dup 753), the ACEI, enalapril, or vehicle (tap water) in their drinking water for 4 weeks.
[u'garlic', u'garlic']furthermore, a moderate ACEI (ACEI) inhibiting action of wild garlic was found in vitro as well as in vivo that could contribute to the cardioprotective and blood pressure lowering action of wild garlic.
[u'water']however, the rate of increase in sodium and water balance was significantly less in the ACEI group.
[u'date']a postmarketing surveillance study in 2273 canadian office practices provided the largest body of clinical experience to date with the ACEI (ACEI) inhibitor lisinopril in the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension.
[u'rabbit']idrapril, the prototype of a new class of ACEI (ACEI) inhibitors, competitively inhibited, with nanomolar apparent ki, the hydrolysis of hippuryl-glycyl-glycine by rabbit lung ACEI.
[u'salt']blockade of ang ii synthesis in the brain and periphery with the ACEI captopril eliminated the thirst and salt appetite.
[u'rabbit', u'coconut']this study investigates the endothelial preservation properties of the ACEI, ramipril, by assessing its ability to restore endothelium-dependent responsiveness in blood vessels from rabbits fed an atherogenic diet (0.25% cholesterol; 3% coconut oil; 12 weeks).
[u'rabbit']cephradine uptake was inhibited by phenylpropionylproline, a proline derivative, and enalapril, an ACEI, which do not have an alpha-amino group, as well as dipeptides, tripeptides, and amino-beta-lactam antibiotics in both rat and rabbit vesicles.
[u'salt']calcium antagonists are more likely to be effective first-line therapy than ACEI in patients with a high salt intake, in patients with raynaud's disease, when angina pectoris is present, and in black patients.
[u'salt']ACEI are preferred for combination with diuretic agents, and in the presence of congestive heart failure or low salt intake.
[u'water', u'salt']hence, ACEI cause a decrease in both pr and co, the latter by preventing salt and water retention by aldosterone, thereby reducing plasma volume and venous return.
[u'rabbit']idrapril strongly inhibited rat and human plasma ACEI and rabbit lung ACEI (ic50: 7-12 nm) as well as the pressor response induced by angiotensin i in anesthetized rats (ed50: 63 nmol/kg i.v.).
[u'rabbit', u'rabbit']to characterize this binding further, immunohistochemistry was performed on rabbit aorta using polyclonal antisera raised to two different preparations of rabbit lung ACEI.
[u'rabbit']the contractions were blocked by saralasin 10(-6) m, but not by captopril or enalaprilate 10(-5) m. in contrast, contractions produced by ati in rabbit mesenteric arteries were practically abolished by the ACEI (ACEI) inhibitors.
[u'water']we conclude that chronic ACEI inhibition and angiotension ii receptor antagonism improved hemodynamic conditions, diminished water retention, reversed cardiac hypertrophy, and restored plasma and tissue anf to more "normal" levels in rats with moderate high-output heart failure.
[u'water']by inhibiting this potent vasoconstrictor and suppressing its degradation of the powerful vasodilator bradykinin, and by promoting sodium and water excretion, ACEI contribute to the restoration of normal ventricular function.
[u'salt']these results suggest that lipids may be important in the development of both glomerular disease and hypertension in dahl s rats and that ACEI inhibition may not affect the course of renal disease in a setting of high salt intake.
[u'sugar']therapy with ACEI under long-term treatment (up to 12 months) reduced diastolic blood pressure (-25%) and, both for type i and ii diabetics, fasting blood sugar (-14%) and hba1 (-9%).
[u'sugar']the outcome of this meta-analysis shows that the treatment of diabetic patients with ACEI not only effectively reduces high blood pressure but also reduces microalbuminuria/proteinuria and, in addition, exhibits an anti-hyperglycemic effect by improving blood sugar levels.
[u'water']however, significantly more sodium and water were retained in cmv 20 than in cmv 20-ACEI (2.3 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.0 +/- 0.3 mmol/kg body wt, and 20 +/- 3 vs. 11 +/- 2 ml/kg body wt) because of a decrease of glomerular filtration rate and fractional unav in cmv 20.
[u'salt']the need-free salt intake of the female rat is not modified by treatment with the ACEI captopril or by the aldosterone receptor antagonist ru-28318.
[u'water']the following experimental drug regimens were used in the rat model of subtotal nephrectomy (snpx): so-called triple therapy [trx; a combination of reserpine 5 mg/liter drinking water (dw), hydralazine 80 mg/liter dw and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/liter dw], or ACEI (either captopril, cpl, 600 mg/liter dw, enalapril, enl, 400 mg/liter dw or lisinopril, lsl, 200 mg/liter dw), or a novel ang ii receptor antagonist (ang iir, l-158,809, 20 mg/liter dw).
[u'salt']single doses of the ACEI (ACEI) inhibitor quinapril were administered to salt replete normotensive men to investigate pharmacokinetics and dose responses.
[u'rabbit']we conclude that both the sh-containing ACEI captopril and the non-sh-containing ramiprilat, as well as iloprost, a stable analog of prostacyclin, can protect rabbit aortic endothelium against damage due to oxygen free radicals.
[u'water', u'water']three-month-old shrsps received untreated drinking water or drinking water containing cilazapril, an ACEI, or hydralazine and hydrochlorothiazide.
[u'water']expected pharmacologic effects of an ACEI were observed at all doses and included increased urine output, increased water consumption, decreased serum aldosterone (65 or 25% of control at 10 or 400 mg/kg, respectively, on day 28), increased plasma renin activity (pra, up to two- to threefold higher than controls at day 28), and hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus.
[u'rabbit']alignment of ACEI sequences from bovine, human, mouse, and rabbit reveals that during evolution both domains have been highly conserved.
[u'rabbit']lisinopril is a potent competitive inhibitor of purified rabbit lung ACEI (dissociation t1/2 = 105 min).
[u'rabbit']thus, rapid as well as slowly reversible components of inhibition of ACEI binding can be demonstrated in the perfused rabbit lung.
[u'water']the excretions of urinary sodium, potassium, magnesium, urate, and water after dosing with diuretics or the ACEI perindopril are reported, as well as the results of other recent studies.
[u'garlic', u'garlic']extracts of wild garlic (allium ursinum) and garlic (a. sativum) with defined chemical compositions were investigated for their in vitro inhibitory potential on 5-lipoxygenase (lo), cyclooxygenase (co), thrombocyte aggregation (ta), and angiotensin i-converting enzyme (ACEI).
[u'water', u'garlic', u'garlic']in the ACEI test the water extract of the leaves of wild garlic containing glutamyl-peptides showed the highest inhibitory activity followed by that of the garlic leaf and the bulbs of both drugs.
[u'rabbit']we have investigated the effects of ACEI (ACEI) inhibitors on intracellular ca2+ levels in human cultured endothelial cells and on endothelial autacoid formation in endothelium-intact bovine coronary arteries and in isolated perfused rabbit and rat hearts.
[u'rabbit']although these findings suggest that endothelium-derived bradykinin is not involved in the control of resting vascular tone in the coronary microcirculation of the rabbit and the rat, there appears to be significant ACEI activity to modulate bradykinin-induced endothelial autacoid formation.
[u'rabbit']in the isolated rabbit thoracic aorta the ACEI ramiprilat attenuated bradykinin degradation by enzymes localized on vascular endothelial cells as well as on vascular smooth muscle cells by 26% and 32%, respectively.
[u'rabbit']in ischemia-reperfusion rabbit hearts, no significant influence of the ACEI, captopril and ramiprilat, were observed.
[u'rabbit']species differences may be responsible for the beneficial role of ACEI in the limitation of infarct size in the dog hearts, possessing collateral flow, that are not seen in the rabbit heart with poor collateral flow.
[u'water']a kinin induced increase in collecting duct pg synthesis may account for the water diuresis seen clinically with ACEI.
[u'salt']rational combinations include an ACEI or a beta-blocker together with moderate salt restriction or a thiazide diuretic or a calcium antagonist.
[u'salt']effect of ACEI and calcium channel blockers (cab) on renal blood flow (rbf), glomerular filtration rate (gfr), and autoregulation (ar) of rbf were studied on the uninephrectomized spontaneously hypertensive rat (shr) under the conditions of high (h) and low (l) salt loading.
[u'water']captopril, an inhibitor of ACEI, given at a dose of 100 mg/kg ip, significantly decreased water intake in water-deprived rats but not in thermally dehydrated rats.
[u'rabbit']the effects of captopril and of other ACEI (zofenopril, fosenopril and enalaprilic acid) were tested on the isolated rabbit heart and aorta.
[u'rabbit']bimane peptides containing nitrated amino acid (1a, b) were shown to be useful fluorogenic substrates for the assay of angiotensin i converting enzyme (ACEI) from rabbit lung, similar to bimane substrate containing tryptophan (3) previously reported.
[u'rabbit']the enzyme was more active on tri- and tetrapeptides than ACEI (ACEI) from rabbit lung.
[u'rabbit']autoradiographic localization of [3h]-trandolaprilate in rabbit fundus sections shows that ACEI is present in the fundic mucosa and mainly in the gland area.
[u'rabbit']semi-thin (1 micron) or thin sections (800-900 a) were stained with anti-rabbit ACEI followed by fluorescein isothyocyanate-labeled rabbit anti-goat igg or protein a-gold reagent, respectively.
[u'water']streptozotocin diabetic rats were treated with captopril (50 mg l), an ACEI-inhibitor, in drinking water for 20 weeks.
[u'rabbit']delapril effectively inhibits rabbit lung ACEI activity and lowers blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.
[u'salt']the hypotensive effect of ramipril was prevented by a high salt diet, which did not alter the degree of renal ACEI inhibition.
[u'rabbit']the effects of specific renin inhibitors, ACEI, indomethacin, and prostaglandin i2 analogue on the release of angiotensins from isolated and krebs-ringer-perfused rabbit mesenteric arteries were examined.
[u'date']although to date no prospective study has examined the ability of ACEI to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertension, several features of these drugs suggest that this may be the case as several effects of ACEI in hypertension are potentially nephroprotective and cardioprotective.
[u'water']since angiotensin ii (aii) is a powerful elicitor of drinking behavior, we investigated the influence of the ACEI, captopril, on the amount of water consumed by the str/n mouse.
[u'rabbit']the peptidase and esterase activities of rabbit pulmonary ACEI (ACEI) are rapidly abolished on reaction with 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (dnp-f).
[u'rabbit']inactivation of rabbit lung ACEI (ACEI) by 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (dnp-f) has been shown to be due primarily to the modification of a tyrosine residue [bunknning, p., kleeman, s.g., & riordan, j.f.
[u'rabbit']rabbit testicular ACEI is also inactivated by dnp-f.
[u'rabbit']identical peptides were obtained from dnp-modified rabbit lung ACEI.
[u'date']nevertheless, renin inhibitors reported to date have limited oral bioavailability and short duration of action, and improvements in both will be necessary for them to compete effectively with ACEI.
[u'rabbit']we have shown that gastrin analogues were specifically degraded by gastric mucosal cells from different species (e.g., rabbit and dog) at 37 degrees c (ph 7.4), releasing the c-terminal dipeptide asp-phe-nh2, similarly to ACEI.
[u'rabbit']potency for inhibiting purified rabbit lung ang i-converting enzyme (ACEI) using a tripeptide substrate with an ang i-like (hippurylhistidylleucine, hhl) or a bk-like (hippurylphenylalanylarginine, hpa) cleavable dipeptide was determined.
[u'salt', u'salt', u'salt']to investigate the mechanisms by which small changes in plasma levels of atrial natriuretic hormone (anh) affect aldosterone, 10 normal young men were infused for 2 h with 0.6 pmol/kg.min human [ser,tyr28]anh under 3 study conditions: 1) high salt diet (h), 2) low salt diet (l), and 3) low salt diet plus pretreatment with the ACEI enalapril (le).
[u'salt']to dissociate the effects on the development of diabetic renal injury of ACEI (ACEI) inhibition per se, and a reduction in systemic blood pressure, we have studied the effects of chronic ramapril treatment in streptozotocin diabetic spontaneously hypertensive rats, with modulation of the hypotensive effect by a high salt diet.
[u'water']the hypotensive effects of three different ACEI (ACEI) inhibitors (captopril, enalapril, and lisinopril) and two angiotensin ii (aii) analogues ([sar1ile5ala8]aii and [sar1ile5thr8]aii) were compared in conscious, freely-moving brattleboro rats after 14 h of water deprivation.
[u'water', u'rabbit']to determine whether chronic ACEI inhibition induces a decrease in proximal tubular ACEI activity, urine and blood samples were collected in conscious new zealand rabbits before and after 16 days administration in drinking water of low doses of captopril (2.6 +/- 0.6 mg 24 h-1 kg-1), high doses of captopril (7.6 +/- 0.9 mg 24 h-1 kg-1) or no captopril (controls).
[u'water']the present data suggest that brain ACEI is more involved in compound 48/80-induced water intake than peripheral systemic ACEI.
[u'rabbit']degradation of bk by ACEI was calculated to be 52% in the rat uterus and 75% in the rabbit perfused ear.
[u'rabbit']fpl 63547, in its active diacid form, was a potent inhibitor of rabbit lung angiotension converting enzyme (ACEI) in vitro (ic50 0.51 nm).
[u'rabbit']samples were bioassayed for ACEI inhibitory activity using affinity-purified rabbit lung ACEI and the amounts of the active form of inhibitor present in each sample were calculated by comparison with a standard curve.
[u'rabbit']ab-47 was slightly more potent than enalaprilat in inhibiting rabbit lung ACEI.
[u'casein']bovine milk casein hydrolysate inhibited the angiotensin i-converting enzyme (ACEI) activity.
[u'casein']it is suggested that ACEI-inhibiting peptides in the tryptic hydrolysate milk casein are absorbed from the intestinal tract and produce an antihypertensive effect.
[u'salt']the acute effects of intravenous frusemide (30 mg) on prostaglandin dependent renal haemodynamics, urinary prostaglandin excretion, urinary dopamine excretion and electrolyte excretion were studied in six salt replete healthy volunteers with and without pretreatment with the ACEI (ACEI) inhibitor, ramipril (5 mg) and compared with the effects of ramipril alone in order to clarify the role of the renin-angiotensin system in these responses.
[u'rabbit']the aim of this study was to investigate the tissue distribution of ACEI (ACEI) in the pregnant rabbit and its fetus and to assess the effect of perindopril (pil) a new ACEI on maternal and fetal tissue ACEI activity.
[u'potato']mr 140,000 hydrolase activity was inhibited by captopril as reported for ACEI (ACEI), while that of mr 70,000 hydrolase activity was inhibited by potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor.
[u'water']these experiments tested whether ACEI (ACEI) located within the subfornical organ (sfo) participates in the generation of water intake during peripheral ACEI blockade with captopril (cap).
[u'date']studies to date indicate that ACEI exert their beneficial effect by lowering glomerular capillary pressure and that not all patients will benefit from therapy with regard to proteinuria or amelioration of disease progression.
[u'rabbit']sch 39370 (n-[n-[1-(s)-carboxyl-3-phenylpropyl]-(s)-phenyl-alanyl]-(s)-isoserin e) is a potent and specific inhibitor of neutral metalloendopeptidase (nep) from rabbit kidney (ic50 = 11.2 +/- 1.9 nm) and is devoid of ACEI inhibitory activity at 1 microm.
[u'rabbit']responses (45ca++ and contraction) elicited by norepinephrine or by kcl were unaltered by these agents at concentrations of up to 10(-4) m. in addition, they exerted no direct effect on the activity of rabbit ACEI and rat renin.
[u'salt', u'salt']renal and hemodynamic effects of diet alone and of single oral doses of the nonsulphydryl ACEI (ACEI) inhibitor, benazepril (10 mg), were investigated in eight healthy volunteers under stable conditions of high salt intake (300 mmol nacl/day) and low salt intake (10 mmol nacl/day), in a double blind, placebo controlled study.
[u'salt', u'salt']because of the relative insolubilities of both zofenopril calcium and sq 26,333, zofenopril potassium salt and sq 26,703, the arginine salt of the active ACEI (angiotensin i converting enzyme) inhibitory moiety of zofenopril, were employed in many of the following studies.
[u'rabbit']in vitro, sq 26,703 was more potent than captopril as an inhibitor of rabbit lung ACEI (ic50 = 8 vs. 23 nm).
[u'rabbit']tuna ai inhibited rabbit lung ACEI non-competitively with ki values of 1.7 and 5.7 microm with substrates, hippuryl-l-histidyl-l-leucine and angiotensin i, respectively.
[u'rabbit']in vitro, sq 27,519, the active moiety of the prodrug fosinopril, was a more potent inhibitor of purified rabbit lung ACEI- (ic50 = 11 vs. 23 nm) and bradykinin-induced contractions of guinea pig ileum than captopril.
