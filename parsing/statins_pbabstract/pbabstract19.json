The study is based on the hypothesis that CCTA as a diagnostic tool is associated with no increase in cardiac risk, decreased cost, and reduced radiation exposure compared with SPECT MPI.

Simvastatin was the most commonly used statin, and it was the statin most associated with muscle symptoms. Among FH patients with muscle symptoms, 41% (n = 40) reestablished statin therapy (\"eventually tolerant\") and 29% (n = 28) never reestablished statin therapy (\"never tolerant\"). Rosuvastatin (43%) and pravastatin (30%) were the most common eventually tolerated statins, and eventually tolerant patients achieved lower treated LDL-C levels (eventually tolerant 127 vs never tolerant 192 mg/dL, P < .001). Never tolerant patients also developed muscle symptoms on nonstatins (16% vs 50%, P = .003). SLCO1B1 rs4149056 genotyping revealed 224 wild-type patients (TT) and 49 heterozygotes (TC).

The relationship between atorvastatin and ALOX15 was investigated using a rat carotid artery balloon-injury model. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining showed that ALOX15 overexpression increased the thickness of the intima-media (IMT). Immunohistochemistry and western blotting showed that atorvastatin increased the expression of cellular adhesion molecules (CAMs) but decreased the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS); these effects of atorvastatin were blocked by ALOX15 overexpression. In human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVECs), silencing of ALOX15 enhanced the effects of atorvastatin on endothelial function. Expression levels of CAMs and Akt/eNOS/NO under oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) stimulation were modulated by ALOX15 inhibitor and ALOX15 small interfering RNA (siRNA). Atorvastatin abolished the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) induced by ox-LDL. Exposure to ox-LDL induced upregulation of ALOX15 in HUVECs, but this effect was partially abolished by atorvastatin or the NF-\u03baB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC). These results demonstrate that regulation of ALOX15 expression might be involved in the effects of atorvastatin on endothelial dysfunction.", 
    "16": "The hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1 (SLCO1B1) and OATP1B3 (SLCO1B3) mediate the uptake of endogenous metabolites and drugs from blood into hepatocytes. Alterations of transport function are accompanied with variations in drug plasma concentrations and the risk of adverse drug effects. Thus, knowledge on amino acids determining substrate recognition or transport kinetics are important to predict alterations in transport kinetics. Therefore, we analyzed the charged amino acids His54 and Tyr169, both located at the extracellular entry of the predicted transmembrane pore of OATP1B1. Based on a computational analysis we established HEK293 cell lines overexpressing the mutant OATP1B1 proteins HEK-OATP1B1p.H54Q, -p.H54A, -p.Y169H and -p.Y169A and analyzed protein expression, localization and transport kinetics of the four OATP1B1 substrates bromosulfophthalein, estradiaol-17\u03b2-glucuronide, taurocholate and pravastatin. Consequences on transport were detected for all mutants and these were different for each amino acid exchange and for each substrate tested. For example, the exchange H54Q resulted in reduced transport for BSP (78% of wildtype OATP1B1 transport at 0.05\u03bcM, P<0.01) with reduced affinity to this substrate (Km value increases from 0.76\u03bcM to 8.04\u03bcM) but in stimulated E217\u03b2G transport (138% compared to wildtype transport at 10\u03bcM, P<0.001). Investigating amino acid exchanges located at the extracellular entry of the transport pore of the OATP1B1 protein we demonstrated that these residues are involved in modulating transport kinetics and this participation strongly depends on the substrate and not on the physicochemical character of the investigated amino acid.",

A three factor, two level (2(3)) full-factorial design was applied to study the effect of independent variables, i.e. amount of lipid, surfactant and polymer on dependent variables, i.e. percent entrapment efficiency and particle size. Optimized formulations were further studied for zeta potential, TEM, in vitro drug release and ex vivo intestinal permeability. Cuboidal nanoparticles exhibited average particle size 61.37\u2009\u00b1\u20093.95\u2009nm, entrapment efficiency 86.77\u2009\u00b1\u20091.27% and zeta potential -6.72\u2009\u00b1\u20093.25\u2009mV. Nanoparticles were lyophilized to improve physical stability and obtain free-flowing powder. Effect of type and concentration of cryoprotectant required to lyophilize nanoparticles was optimized using freeze-thaw cycles.

Lyophilized nanoparticles were characterized using FTIR, DSC, XRD and SEM. Absence of C=C and C-F aromatic stretch at 1548 and 1197\u2009cm(-1), respectively, in LPN indicated coating of drug by lipid and polymer. In vitro diffusion of ROS using dialysis bag showed pH-independent sustained release of ROS from LPN in comparison to drug suspension. Intestinal permeability by non-everted gut sac model showed prolonged release of ROS from LPN owing to adhesion of polymer to mucus layer. In vivo absorption of ROS from LPN resulted in 3.95-fold increase in AUC0-last and 7.87-fold increase in mean residence time compared to drug suspension. Furthermore modified tyloxapol-induced rat model demonstrated the potential of ROS-loaded LPN in reducing elevated lipid profile.",

These types of drugs are commonly administered together. More recently, angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) antagonists, such as candesartan cilexetil (candesartan), have been used in the place of, or in combination with, ACEis. Here, we investigated the effects of simvastatin and ramipril single and combination therapy, and candesartan treatment on the lifespan of isocalorically fed, long-lived, B6C3F1 mice. Males were used for their relative endocrine simplicity and to minimize animal usage. The drugs were administered daily in food. The simvastatin and ramipril combination therapy significantly increased the mean and median lifespan by 9\u00a0%. In contrast, simvastatin, ramipril, or candesartan monotherapy was ineffective. All groups consumed the same number of calories. Simvastatin, alone or administered with ramipril, decreased body weight without changing caloric consumption, suggesting it may alter energy utilization in mice. Combination therapy elevated serum triglyceride and glucose levels, consistent with altered energy homeostasis. Few significant or consistent differences were found in mortality-associated pathologies among the groups. Simvastatin treatment did not reduce normal serum cholesterol or lipid levels in these mice, suggesting that the longevity effects may stem from the pleiotropic, non-cholesterol-related, effects of statins. Together, the results suggest that statins and ACEis together may enhance mouse longevity. Statins and ACE inhibitors are generally well-tolerated, and in combination, they have been shown to increase the lifespan of normotensive, normocholesterolemic humans.",

    "48": "The coronary artery calcium (CAC) scan has recently emerged as a reproducible noninvasive test to detect asymptomatic atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. It has several advantages over the traditional cardiac stress testing modalities, including lower cost, greater sensitivity for nonobstructing coronary artery lesions, and excellent prognostic value when combined with the Framingham risk parameters. Its chief disadvantage is that it does not identify obstructing coronary artery lesions or noncalcified coronary artery plaque. A CAC scan utilizes a chest computed tomogram and computer software to calculate the amount of calcium in the four main coronary vessels. Calcium is deposited in coronary plaques so that the greater the calcium score, the greater the plaque burden. This, in turn, is the basis for predicting a 10-15-year risk of a cardiovascular event. Individuals with a zero calcium score have a very low 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event. Obtaining a calcium score in a diabetic patient permits rational decisions for prescribing statin therapy. In patients with a zero score, the initiation of statin therapy is not recommended because the 5-year incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is so low. In patients with diabetes, it is recommended to repeat the calcium scan in 4-5 years to permit timely therapy in the event that the score becomes positive. Since statins mildly increase coronary calcium as part of the stabilization of plaque, a reduction in the calcium score should not be anticipated. However, progression of the calcium score by more than 15%/year (calculated from a repeat CAC scan) provides additional prognostic information of an indication of progression of atherosclerosis. In summary, the coronary calcium score is a major clinical advance for noninvasively detecting coronary artery disease and managing antiatherosclerotic therapy in type 1 diabetes.",

For prostate cancer however, statins are known to compete with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEAS) for the transport into the cytosol both using the cell by the Solute Carrier Transporter and thus diminish the cellular uptake of DHEAS as a precursor of androgens. Abiraterone inhibits CYP17A1 and thus effectively decreases the production of all relevant androgens including DHEAS. In this study we examined whether statins still affect survival outcome in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) when treated with Abiraterone.",

The interest in Fgf21 as a potential antidiabetic drug and the factors that regulate its production and secretion is growing. Statins are the most widely prescribed drug for the treatment of dyslipidemia. However, the function of statins is not limited to the lowering of cholesterol as they are associated with pleiotropic actions such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects. The recently described effect of statins on mitochondrial function and the induction of Fgf21 by mitochondrial stress prompted us to investigate the effect of statin treatment on Fgf21 expression in the liver. To this end, C57BL6J male mice and primary mouse hepatocytes were treated with simvastatin, and Fgf21 expression was subsequently assessed by immunoblotting and quantitative real-time PCR. Hepatic Fgf21 protein and mRNA and circulating levels of FGF21significantly decreased in mice that had received simvastatin in their food (0.1% w/w) for 1 week. This effect was also observed with simvastatin doses as low as 0.01% w/w for 1 week or following 2 intraperitoneal injections within a single day. The reduction in Fgf21 mRNA levels was further verified in primary mouse hepatocytes, indicating that the effect of simvastatin is cell autonomous. In conclusion, simvastatin treatment reduced the circulating and hepatic Fgf21 levels and this effect warrants further investigation with reference to its role in metabolism.", 
    "54": "While initially effective, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is not curative, and nearly all men with advanced prostate cancer will eventually progress to the more resistant, and ultimately lethal form of the disease, so called castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The maintenance of androgens within the prostate cancer microenvironment likely represents one of the key mechanisms by which this transition from hormone-sensitive to CRPC occurs. This can be accomplished either through intratumoral androgen biosynthesis or the active transport of androgens and androgenic precursors into the tumor microenvironment. More recently, preclinical and clinical data supported therapeutic strategies that seek to target these two mechanisms, either through the use of drugs that impair androgen biosynthesis (e.g. inhibiting the steroidogenic enzymes CYP17 and AKR1C3 with abiraterone and indomethacin, respectively) or drugs that inhibit the SLCO transporters responsible for importing androgens (e.g. statins).",

Encouragingly, there has lately been remarkable activity in the study of PSE. Three developments in PSE research deserve particular focus. First, large prospective trials have established the incidence and risk factors of PSE in the setting of modern stroke care. Stroke severity, cortical location, young age, and haemorrhage remain the most important risk factors. Second, although more studies are needed, epidemiological data indicate that the risk of PSE may be influenced, for instance, by statin treatment. Third, studies are emerging regarding the treatment and prognosis of PSE. Levetiracetam and lamotrigine may be well tolerated treatment options and seizure freedom is achieved in at least a similar proportion of patients as in other epilepsies. Furthermore, new animal models such as photothrombotic stroke gives hope of a more clear understanding of PSE epileptogenesis in the near future. In summary, PSE shows indications of maturing into an independent epilepsy research field. This review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of PSE and provides an update on management issues such as diagnosis, AED selection, and prognosis. Finally, future research challenges in the field are outlined.",

    "60": "Staff (pharmacy managers, staff pharmacists, and technicians) from intervention pharmacies attended a 2.5-hour workshop on the CPATCH program that prepared pharmacists to deal with the adherence barriers most likely associated with statin use (e.g., safety, cost, patient-provider relationship, and tolerability). Intervention pharmacists screened for new statin users and assessed these adherence barriers. Pharmacists were then instructed to tailor their follow-up plan based on the individual patient's situation. Investigators contacted the intervention pharmacies monthly to assess their compliance with the protocol and to offer additional support to motivate ongoing participation.",

Adherence was measured by the proportion of days covered (PDC) between 6 and 12 months following the original prescription fill date. General estimating equations were used to evaluate the difference in mean adherence between groups. Secondary outcomes included the percentage of new statin users exhibiting optimal adherence (defined as PDC of 80% or higher) and the percentage exhibiting nonpersistence (defined as the cessation of all statin dispensations within 3 mo of the first dispensation). Among 1906 eligible patients, no significant differences in mean adherence were observed between those receiving the intervention and those receiving usual care (71.6% vs 70.9%, p=0.64), the percentage of patients achieving optimal adherence (57.3% vs 55.9%, p=0.51), or the percentage exhibiting nonpersistence (9.4% vs 8.3%, p=0.41). However, compliance to the study protocol was extremely low in several intervention pharmacies. In a post hoc analysis, a higher level of protocol compliance among intervention pharmacies was significantly associated with higher adherence (p<0.01 for trend). Pharmacies falling in the highest tertile of compliance to the study protocol exhibited higher mean adherence among their patients compared with those in the usual care group (\u03b2 = 0.056, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.010-0.101, p=0.01), and a significantly higher percentage of patients achieving optimal adherence (odds ratio 1.32, 95% CI 1.08-1.61; p<0.01); however, nonpersistence did not significantly differ between the two groups (5.5% vs 8.3%, p=0.27).",

    "71": "Sarcopenia is a geriatric syndrome characterized by progressive and generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass and function. Reported prevalence of this geriatric syndrome, differs depending on the definition, the population and the method used to identify sarcopenia. The causes of sarcopenia are multifactorial, and can include genetic influence, immobility or disuse, endocrine factors, inflammation and nutritional deficiencies. These disorders involve an imbalance between anabolic and catabolic pathways that rules muscle mass. Many drugs taken regularly for common conditions may interact with some mechanisms that can alter the balance between protein synthesis and degradation. This may lead to a harmful or a beneficial effect on muscle mass and strength. Widely prescribed drugs could play an important role during the time of onset and development of sarcopenia. In this paper, we reviewed the current understanding of how can drugs contribute positively or negatively on sarcopenia and muscle wasting. We decided to focus this review on oral common drugs, which are usually prescribed in older adults, leaving aside other drugs as hormone therapy.",

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fixed-dose combination (FDC) therapy with olmesartan medoxomil (40 mg) and rosuvastatin (20 mg) in Korean patients with mild to moderate hypertension and dyslipidemia. This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, factorial-design study included patients aged \u226520 years with mild to moderate essential hypertension and dyslipidemia. Patients were randomly assigned to receive FDC therapy (40 mg olmesartan medoxomil, 20 mg rosuvastatin), 40 mg olmesartan medoxomil, 20 mg rosuvastatin, or a placebo. The percentage change from baseline in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels was compared between FDC therapy and olmesartan medoxomil, and the change from baseline in diastolic blood pressure was compared between FDC therapy and rosuvastatin 8 weeks after treatment. A total of 162 patients were included. The least square mean percentage change (standard error) from baseline in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels 8 weeks after treatment was significantly greater in the FDC than in the olmesartan medoxomil group (-52.3% [2.8%] vs -0.6% [3.5%], P<0.0001), and the difference was -51.7% (4.1%) (95% confidence interval: -59.8% to -43.6%). The least square mean change (standard error) from baseline in diastolic blood pressure 8 weeks after treatment was significantly greater in the FDC group than in the rosuvastatin group (-10.4 [1.2] mmHg vs 0.1 [1.6] mmHg, P<0.0001), and the difference was -10.5 (1.8) mmHg (95% confidence interval: -14.1 to -6.9 mmHg). There were 50 adverse events in 41 patients (22.7%) and eight adverse drug reactions in five patients (2.8%). The study found that FDC therapy with olmesartan medoxomil and rosuvastatin is an effective, safe treatment for patients with hypertension and dyslipidemia.

These studies often ensure comparability of statin users and non-users at baseline; however, most studies neglect to consider confounders that occur during follow-up. Failure to consider these confounders, such as new medications or procedures, may result in identification of a spurious association between statins and outcomes. The objective of this study was to examine the association of statins with diabetes mellitus and diabetic complications; and to examine potential confounders during the follow-up period that might affect this relationship. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using Tricare data (from October 1, 2003 to March 31, 2012). We propensity score-matched statin users and non-users on 115 baseline characteristics before starting statins; these characteristics would be potentially associated with the use of statins or the outcomes of interest. Outcomes included the risk of diabetes mellitus and diabetic complications. Out of 60,455 patients (10,910 statin users and 49,545 non-users), we propensity score-matched 6728 statin users to 6728 non-users. Statin users had higher ORs for diabetes (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.44) and diabetes with complications (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.42). Adjustment for potential confounders that occurred during the follow-up period did not explain or diminish the association between statins and adverse outcomes. Statin users in comparison to similar non-users were more commonly diagnosed with diabetes and diabetic complications, even after adjustment for potential confounders that occurred during the follow-up period.",

The severity of CHD in diabetic patients has been found to be directly associated with glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). According to the Malaysian Clinical Practice Guidelines on diabetes mellitus (DM), HbA1c level less than 6.5% reduces the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications. Hence, this study aimed to determine the relationship between dyslipidaemia and glycaemic status in patients with type 2 DM (T2DM) patients in Hospital Putrajaya, a tertiary endocrine centre in Malaysia. This was a cross sectional, retrospective study of 214 T2DM patients with dyslipidaemia who had visited the endocrine clinic between January 2009 and December 2012. Significant correlations were found between fasting blood glucose (FBG) and HbA1c with total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL), LDL/HDL ratio and TC/HDL ratio; greater correlation being with HbA1c than FBG.

    "142": "Control of lipid levels is one of the most effective strategies for cardiovascular (CV) event prevention. In fact, many clinical trials have clearly demonstrated that low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering, primarily with statins, reduces major CV events and mortality. The evidence from these trials has been useful in designing the cholesterol treatment guidelines, which are mainly aimed at preventing and managing cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, available data indicate that a large proportion of patients fail to achieve lipid goals, and this is particularly frequent in patients at high or very high CV risk. Furthermore, owing to side effects, a significant percentage of patients cannot tolerate statin treatment. Hence, researchers have focused their attention on novel LDL-C-lowering agents that act via mechanisms distinct from that of statins. Among the new compounds under investigation, the monoclonal antibodies to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) seem particularly promising, having recently been shown to be well tolerated and highly effective at lowering LDL-C, with a possible effect on the occurrence of CV events. Currently, alirocumab is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for use in adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or those with atherosclerotic CV disease who require additional LDL-C lowering; it has also been recently approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for use in patients with heterozygous FH, non-familial hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia in whom statins are ineffective or not tolerated. Evolocumab is approved by the FDA as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statins for adults with hetero- and homozygous FH and those with atherosclerotic CV disease who require additional lowering of LDL-C, and by the EMA in adults with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia, as an adjunct to diet, in combination with a statin or a statin with other lipid lowering therapies in patients unable to reach LDL-C goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin; alone or in combination with other lipid lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, or those for whom a statin is contraindicated.

In this study, \u201cprobable FH\u201d was defined as a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration greater than 155 mg/dL or TC concentration greater than 260 mg/dL plus DNA evidence of a low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) mutation in a first- or second-degree relative. A Danish school-based study of more than 2,085 6- to 8-year-olds used the ApoB:ApoA-1 ratio and reported a diagnostic yield of 4.8 cases per 1,000 screened. We found no studies reporting diagnostic yield or effectiveness of selective screening for FH in youth (i.e., screening subjects with a family history or other targeting factor). KQ6. Does treatment of FH with lifestyle modifications and/or lipid-lowering medications in children and adolescents improve intermediate outcomes (i.e., reduce lipid concentrations or reverse or slow the progression of atherosclerosis) in childhood and adolescence? Eight good-quality randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) formed the evidence base for statin treatment of FH in youth. Studies of statins ranged from 6 weeks to 2 years long, with most shorter than 1 year. Treatment with statins lowered LDL-C and TC concentrations in the short term in children and adolescents with FH, with most studies reporting that statins lowered LDL-C by 20 to 40 percent compared to placebo. The greatest effect on LDL-C was in a trial of rosuvastatin. Participants who received the highest dose (20 mg/day) experienced a 50 percent decrease (least mean squares) in LDL-C from baseline compared to a 1 percent decrease among controls (p<0.001). Eight studies reported the effect of statins on TC, all showing decreases of about 20 to 30 percent from baseline (compared to no change with placebo). The effect on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was minimal or null. A single study assessed the effect on a measure of atherosclerosis and found that pravastatin reduced carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) by 2.01 percent (compared to a 1.02% increase in the control group; p=0.02). There were no consistent differences in treatment effect among different statins, but the number of studies for any one drug was limited. The two studies that compared different doses of statins reported a dose response with pravastatin and rosuvastatin. In the 2010 rosuvastatin trial, the only statin study reporting how many subjects attained the target LDL-C concentration, only 12 to 41 percent of participants reached a target LDL-C of less than 110 mg/dL, with greater effect at higher doses. Six studies of statins provided the necessary data to create a forest plot of mean difference across statins between percent change from baseline of TC, LDL-C, and HDL-C. Treatment effects on TC and LDL-C were statistically significant for all five drugs in these six studies (atorvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin), with overlapping 95% confidence intervals across drugs. Five fair- to good-quality RCTs evaluated nonstatin drugs in children and adolescents with FH. All trials reported decreases in LDL-C from baseline. Three RCTs studied bile-sequestering agents. A good-quality trial of colestipol found a mean reduction in LDL-C of 19.5 percent after 8 weeks of treatment compared to a 1 percent decrease in the control group. One fair-quality RCT of cholestyramine found an 18.6 percent reduction in LDL-C after 1 year compared to a 1.5 percent increase in the control group. One good-quality 8-week RCT of colesevelam published after the 2007 USPSTF review found a least squares mean decrease in LDL-C of 10 percent (standard error [SE], 2.1%) at the higher of two doses compared to a least squares mean increase of 2.5 percent (SE, 2.0%). A lower dose provided a smaller, nonsignificant reduction. Two good-quality RCTs of ezetimibe were published after the 2007 USPSTF review. One reported that LDL-C decreased by a mean of 54.0 percent (SE, 1.4%) in participants who received a combination of ezetimibe and simvastatin, whereas the mean decrease was 38.1 percent (SE, 1.4%) in the simvastatin-only group at 33 weeks. The second found that, at 12 weeks, ezetimibe monotherapy decreased LDL-C by 28 percent (95% CI, -31 to -25) from baseline compared to a negligible change in the placebo group. KQ7. What are the harms of treatment of FH with medications in children and adolescents? There is a fair- to good-quality body of evidence about the short-term harms of pharmacologic treatment of children and adolescents with FH. Most studies were conducted outside the United States but were applicable to U.S. primary care setting. Most studies were of short duration (6 weeks to 2 years); the longest was 10 years. Statins were generally well-tolerated, although reversible elevations of liver enzymes and/or creatine kinase concentrations were noted in some studies. One study found lower dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate concentrations in men with FH treated with statins compared to unaffected siblings. Bile-acid binding resins were commonly associated with adverse gastrointestinal symptoms and poor palatability. Long-term harms are unknown.", 
    "174": "Direct evidence for the impact of screening on intermediate or health outcomes is lacking. One of the two studies assessing the diagnostic yield of screening for FH may not be generalizable to a U.S. population, and the other provides few details as to the screening and confirmatory testing for FH. Evidence on the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy lacks long-term studies assessing the effect of lipid-lowering medications on intermediate outcomes in childhood and adolescence or on health outcomes in adults. Participants in the eight statin trials were patients at tertiary care centers; none of the studies were conducted in screen-detected populations. Few studies were conducted in nonwhite populations. Three statin trials included children as young as age 8 years; however, the age distribution of the statin studies as a whole is skewed to early adolescence. We found no studies comparing outcomes between groups of children or adolescents who initiated treatment at different ages. Long-term studies of harms of pharmacotherapy in youth are lacking. Finally, this review was limited to FH alone; other atherogenic dyslipidemias are addressed in a separate review.", 
    "175": "We found no direct evidence of the effect of screening on intermediate or health outcomes. The evidence describing the diagnostic yield of screening for FH in children is minimal. There is good evidence of the effectiveness of statins in reducing LDL-C and TC concentrations in studies up to 2 years long and limited evidence of a statin effect on measures of atherosclerosis. Statins were generally well-tolerated in the short term, although reversible elevations of liver enzymes and/or creatine kinase concentrations were noted in some studies and a decrease in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate was noted in one study. Bile-acid binding resins were commonly associated with adverse gastrointestinal symptoms and poor palatability. Long-term harms are unknown. Randomized trials of screening for FH in U.S. youth are needed, as are longer-term treatment trials evaluating the benefits and harms of medications in children and adolescents with FH.",

Recently, it has been shown that statins also exert side effects on the pancreas. In vitro studies have suggested that this class of drugs induced a reduction in insulin secretion. Also, the use of statins is associated with a raised risk of diabetes mellitus (DM), but the mechanisms underlying statin-induced diabetes are poorly known. Literature data indicate that several statins are able to induce apoptosis signalling. This study was designed to examine the mechanism of atorvastatin on mitochondria obtained from rat pancreas. In our study, mitochondria were obtained from the pancreas and then exposed to atorvastatin and vehicle to investigate probable toxic effects. The results showed that atorvastatin (25, 50, 75, 100 and 125 \u03bcM) increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial swelling, collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release, the orchestrating factor for mitochondria-mediated apoptosis signalling. Atorvastatin also reduced the ATP levels.

Follow-up measurements were performed at six and 12 months in 30 (26) and 134 (77) patients, respectively. Mean levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased by 30%, from 2.49 mmol/l to 1.73 mmol/l at the end of follow-up. High-dose rosuvastatin therapy resulted in a non-significant change of -1.4 mm3 (95% CI: -3.0, 0.1) in NC volume during follow-up (p=0.074). The change in NC percentage of total plaque volume was -1.4% (95% CI: -2.4 to -0.4; p=0.006). A neutral effect was also observed on LCBI. Indications of significant regression of NC volume and LCBI in the highest baseline quartiles were observed, which should cautiously be regarded as hypothesis-generating.", 
    "216": "High-intensity rosuvastatin therapy during one year resulted in a neutral effect on NC and LCBI within non-stenotic, non-culprit coronary segments with a relatively low atheroma burden. This study has been registered in The Netherlands Trial Register (NTR) nr. 2872.", 
    "217": "We evaluated the chemopreventive effect of statins on colon cancer in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and identified the statin exerting the strongest chemopreventive effect.", 
    "218": "Using the National Health Insurance Research Database, we identified patients who received a COPD diagnosis in Taiwan between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2012, and included them in the study cohort. Each patient was followed to assess the colon cancer risk and protective factors. A propensity score was derived using a logistic regression model to estimate the effect of statins by accounting for covariates predicted during the intervention (statins). To examine the dose-response relationship, we categorized statin doses into four groups in each cohort [<28, 28-90, 91-365, and >365 cumulative defined daily dose].", 
    "219": "Compared with the statin nonusers, the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for colon cancer decreased in the statin users (aHR = 0.52, 95% confidence interval = 0.44, 0.62). Hydrophilic statins exerted a stronger preventive effect against colon cancer. Regarding the statin type, lovastatin, pravastatin, and fluvastatin nonsignificantly reduced the colon cancer risk in the patients with COPD. Compared with the statin nonusers, the aHRs for colon cancer decreased in the individual statin users (rosuvastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin: aHRs = 0.28, 0.64, and 0.65, respectively). In the sensitivity analysis, statins dose-dependently reduced the colon cancer risk.",

    "221": "More and more evidence suggests that the density of calcification plays an important role in the plaque stability. However, few studies have investigated the statin treatment on the density of plaque calcification in patients with both coronary artery disease (CAD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus.", 
    "222": "One hundred and twenty-two CAD patients with type 2 diabetes with confirmed coronary artery calcification (CAC) will be recruited consecutively in a 12-month period. These patients will receive rosuvastatin (20\u00a0mg/day) therapy in the next 24\u00a0months. Blood tests and adverse events will be collected at routine follow-up of 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24\u00a0months. The primary endpoint will be the change of CAC density score measured by coronary CT angiography after 24\u00a0months' treatment of rosuvastatin (20\u00a0mg/day) compared with baseline. The secondary endpoints will be the change of serum sclerostin and the effect on the volume score of CAC in those patients.", 
    "223": "We expect that rosuvastatin could both increase the density of CAC to improve plaque stability and up-regulate serum sclerostin, which would suggest the underlying mechanism of the plaque stabilization by a statin.", 
    "224": "This study would be the first to demonstrate the impact of rosuvastatin on the density score of coronary artery calcification in CAD patients with type 2 diabetes. This study has been registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02418884).", 
    "225": "Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) is a common complication of intravascular administration of contrast media used in coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention and other diagnostic and interventional procedures. This review article aims at summarizing the published literature regarding the prevention of CI-AKI, by focusing on available high-quality meta-analyses addressing this matter. Apart from adequate hydration, a number of pharmacologic agents have been proposed as potential candidates to be included in the routine preparation, prior to the patient's arrival in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Among them, statins and N-acetylcysteine appear to be the most extensively studied ones. Throughout this article we present the available data on CI-AKI prevention and provide a critical clinical appraisal, as well as a summary of currently available guidelines.", 
    "226": "Simvastatin, a lipophilic and fermentation-derived natural statin, is reported to treat neurological disorders, such as traumatic brain injury, Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer disease (AD), etc. Recently, research also indicated that simvastatin could promote regeneration in the dentate gyrus of adult mice by Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling (Robin et al. in Stem Cell Reports 2:9-17, 2014). However, the effect and mechanisms by which simvastatin may affect the neural stem cells (NSCs; from the embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) SD rat brain) are not fully understood. Here, we investigated the effects of different doses of simvastatin on the survival, proliferation, differentiation, migration, and cell cycle of NSCs as well as underlying intracellular signaling pathways. The results showed that simvastatin not only inhibits the proliferation of NSCs but also enhances the \u03b2III-tubulin(+) neuron differentiation rate. Additionally, we find that simvastatin could also promote NSC migration and induce cell cycle arrest at M2 phrase. All these effects of simvastatin on NSCs were mimicked with an inhibitor of Rho kinase (ROCK) and a specific inhibitor of geranylgeranyl transferase (GGTase). In conclusion, these data indicate that simvastatin could promote neurogenesis of neural stem cells, and these effects were mediated through the ROCK/GGTase pathway.", 
    "227": "Statins are widely used in high-risk patients to reduce the stroke incidence. However, little has been investigated about the impact of chronic pretreatment with statins on cerebral ischemic insult following defined arterial occlusion. To address this in experimental rats, in the present work, atorvastatin was orally dosed for 1\u00a0month to evaluate the outcomes of the subsequent occlusive stroke induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Our data was suggestive of potential escalating impact of chronic atorvastatin (Atv; 10\u00a0mg/kg) on neurological function, but not infarct volume. According to our immunoblotting data, such escalations were consistent with the prominent rise in TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 which paralleled with augmented Bax/Bcl2 ratio and Caspase-9 activation; however, these were not enough to worsen acute neurodegeneration determined by Fluoro Jade B staining. Noteworthy, such deteriorating effects were also partly detected in non-ischemic animals. Conclusively, our data are indicative of cerebral proinflammatory effects of chronic Atv which might overwhelm the beneficial pliotropic of the drug and predispose animals' brain to ischemic insult. Further studies on different statins with discrete pharmacokinetic properties are highly suggested to precisely explore stroke outcomes following long term prophylactic treatment particularly in primates.", 
    "228": "Recent retrospective observational studies suggest that high-potency statin therapy might increase the risk of acute kidney injury, however data on this subject is scares.", 
    "229": "This study, was designed to investigate the renal tubular cell effect of different doses of atorvastatin to detect the possible aggravation of renal function or morphology of the kidney.", 
    "230": "In this experimental study 24 male Wistar rats were designated into 4 equal groups and treated as follows. Control group received phosphate buffer as the vehicle of atorvastatin for 7 days. Groups 1, II and III received atorvastatin at doses of 10, 50 and 150 mg/kg daily for 7 days, then on the day 8, all rats were anesthetized using ketamine and the blood samples were collected for evaluation of creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels and then all rats were sacrificed, then the animals' kidneys were dissected out and histopathological studies were performed.", 
    "231": "Mean (\u00b1SD) of scores of injury to renal tubular cells in control group was 4.2 \u00b1 2.2 and in groups I, II and III were 6.44 \u00b1 4.9, 15.4 \u00b1 8.5 and 25.8 \u00b1 12.7 respectively. Group III which received 150 mg/kg/day of atorvastatin had significant renal damage in comparison to control group (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference of renal injury score between control group with groups of I and II.", 
    "232": "In the present study we found, atorvastatin with a dose of 150 mg/kg/day for 7 days was nephrotoxic for rats, while lower doses at 10 mg/kg/day or 50 mg/kg/day for 7 days were not accompanied by renal injury. These findings imply further attention to the administration of higher doses of atorvastatin in clinical conditions.", 
    "233": "Time and cost saving is an essential requirement in pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence studies. The aim of this study is to use a simple, fast, and nondestructive near-infrared transmission spectroscopic method to quantify simvastatin (SMV) concentrations in mice plasma and also to improve SMV bioavailability by using alpha-lipoic acid as a carrier. Calibration curve was built at a concentration range of 10-250 ng/mL, and HPLC method was considered as a reference method. A partial least squares regression analysis model was used for method development, which gave less root mean square error cross-validation. Comparison of SMV concentrations obtained from both instruments showed no statistically significant differences between all the data. Near-infrared spectroscopy was utilized as a rapid, simple accurate method to quantify drug-plasma concentrations without need for any extraction protocols, and the significant effect of alpha-lipoic acid as a novel carrier to enhance SMV bioavailability is also addressed.", 
    "234": "A reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is important for the secondary prevention of coronary artery disease. We performed secondary prevention in 632 consecutive patients, including 315 with acute coronary syndrome, who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention according to current treat-to-target lipid-lowering guidelines to achieve LDL-C\u00a0<100\u00a0mg/dL. We retrospectively analyzed 2-year all-cause mortality. The average LDL-C level was reduced from 114\u00a0\u00b1\u00a036\u00a0mg/dL at baseline to 94\u00a0\u00b1\u00a025\u00a0mg/dL at follow-up; 61\u00a0% of patients achieved the guideline target. Statin was not prescribed for 42 (6.6\u00a0%) patients, with reasons mainly due to a low baseline LDL-C level, however, renal failure, an older age, stable coronary artery disease and having a female gender were also related factors. At the end of follow-up (average 2.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9\u00a0years), 90\u00a0% of patients were on statins and showed a lower 2-year mortality rate than those not on statins (3.3 vs. 20.5\u00a0%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In contrast, achieving LDL-C target levels did not impact mortality (4.9 vs. 4.8\u00a0%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.99). Propensity score matching analysis revealed statin use to be a predictor of better survival (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009) after adjusting for a baseline difference between statin and no statin groups. A multivariable Cox proportional hazard showed that age (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.12, 95\u00a0% CI 1.03-1.22) and statin use (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.14, 95\u00a0% CI 0.008-0.77) were predictors of survival. Statin use was a significant predictor of improved mortality rates under treat-to-target guidelines. However, it also highlighted a poor prognosis in patients without an indication for statins.", 
    "235": "Efficacy and safety data from trials with suitable endpoints have shown that non-statin medication in combination with a statin is a potential strategy to further reduce cardiovascular events. We aimed to evaluate the overall effect of stanol- or sterol-enriched diets on serum lipid profiles in patients treated with statins by conducting a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We used the PubMed, Cochrane library and ClinicalTrials.gov databases to search for literature published up to December 2015. Trials were included in the analysis if they were RCTs evaluating the effect of plant stanols or sterols in patients under statin therapy that reported corresponding data on serum lipid profiles. We included 15 RCTs involving a total of 500 participants. Stanol- or sterol-enriched diets in combination with statins, compared with statins alone, produced significant reductions in total cholesterol of 0.30\u2009mmol/L (95% CI -0.36 to -0.25) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol of 0.30\u2009mmol/L (95% CI -0.35 to -0.25), but not in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglycerides. These results persisted in the subgroup analysis. Our meta-analysis provides further evidence that stanol- or sterol-enriched diets additionally lower total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels in patients treated with statins beyond that achieved by statins alone.", 
    "236": "Some patients are susceptible to statin-associated myopathy (SAM) either because of genetic variations affecting statin uptake and metabolism, or because they predispose their carriers to muscular diseases. Among the frequent variants examined using the genome-wide association study approach, SLCO1B1 c.521T>C represents the only validated predictor of SAM in patients treated with high-dose simvastatin. Our aim was to ascertain the overall contribution of large copy-number variations (CNVs) to SAM diagnosed in 86 patients. CNVs were detected by whole genome genotyping using Illumina HumanOmni2.5 Exome BeadChips. Exome sequence data were used for validation of CNVs in SAM-related loci. In addition, we performed a specific search for CNVs in the SLCO1B region detected recently in Rotor syndrome subjects. Rare deletions possibly contributing to genetic predisposition to SAM were found in two patients: one removed EYS associated previously with SAM, the other was present in LARGE associated with congenital muscular dystrophy. Another two patients carried deletions in CYP2C19, which may predispose to clopidogrel-statin interactions. We found no common large CNVs potentially associated with SAM and no CNVs in the SLCO1B locus. Our findings suggest that large CNVs do not play a substantial role in the etiology of SAM.", 
    "237": "Dyslipidemia and inflammation play an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and liver disease. Fenofibrate has a well-known efficacy to reduce cholesterol and triglycerides. Combination with statins can ameliorate hypolipidemic and anti-inflammatory effects of fibrates. In the current study, we tested the anti-inflammatory and metabolic effects of fenofibrate alone and in combination with rosuvastatin in a model of inflammation and metabolic syndrome, using spontaneously hypertensive rats expressing the human C-reactive protein transgene (SHR-CRP transgenic rats). SHR-CRP rats treated with fenofibrate alone (100 mg/kg body weight) or in combination with rosuvastatin (20 mg/kg body weight) vs. SHR-CRP untreated controls showed increased levels of proinflammatory marker IL6, increased concentrations of ALT, AST and ALP, increased oxidative stress in the liver and necrotic changes of the liver. In addition, SHR-CRP rats treated with fenofibrate, or with fenofibrate combined with rosuvastatin vs. untreated controls, exhibited increased serum triglycerides and reduced HDL cholesterol, as well as reduced hepatic triglyceride, cholesterol and glycogen concentrations. These findings suggest that in the presence of high levels of human CRP, fenofibrate can induce liver damage even in combination with rosuvastatin. Accordingly, these results caution against the possible hepatotoxic effects of fenofibrate in patients with high levels of CRP.",

    "242": "Creatine kinase (CK) values are a critical part of the workup of suspected myopathies and are often assessed in patients that develop myalgia on statin therapy. CK elevations may influence the initiation and cessation of statin treatment, and incidentally discovered CK elevation may lead to further testing. A number of factors influence CK levels in healthy patients, but current reference ranges do not incorporate important influencers of CK such as race. Objectives of this study were to evaluate clinical factors associated with CK among healthy individuals and to develop practical reference ranges for important subgroups to improve test interpretation.", 
    "243": "CK was evaluated in nonpregnant participants \u226520 years old from the cross-sectional National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2014. Linear and logistic regression stratified by sex identified clinical factors associated with CK levels. Adjustment for anthropomorphic measures assessed whether age and race-ethnicity differences in CK were explained by differences in body composition. The 95th and 97.5th percentiles of CK in sex/race-ethnicity subgroups were calculated, excluding patients with recent strenuous exercise.",

The odds ratio of having an abnormal CK for black women was 5.08 (95% CI 3.65-7.08) and for black men was 8.39 (95% CI 6.11-11.52). CK was substantially lower in older men. Differences in CK by age but not race-ethnicity were largely explained by body composition. Women with low body mass index were less likely to have an elevated CK, and overweight or obese men had an almost 2-fold greater odds of having an elevated CK. The 97.5th percentile of CK was 382 (95% CI 295-469) in white men, 1001 (95% CI 718-1284) in black men, 295 (95% CI 216-374) in white women, and 487 (95% CI 310-664) in black women.",

Effects of atorvastatin on expression of GSK-3\u03b2 and miR-199a-5p were determined using RT-PCR and Western blot. In addition, GSK-3\u03b2 expression with miR-199a-5p upregulation and downregulation was detected using RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry.", 
    "248": "Pretreatment with atorvastatin significantly improved the recovery of cells viability from OGD/R (p<0.05). In addition, the atorvastatin pretreatment significantly increased GSK-3\u03b2 expression both in mRNA level and protein level and decreased miR-199a-5p expression in mRNA level (p<0.05). Upregulation and downregulation of miR-199a-5p respectively decreased and increased GSK-3\u03b2 expression both in mRNA level and protein level.",

    "250": "Drug-induced tendon disorders are an often underestimated risk factor. The range from detrimental effects on the tendon include tendinopathy as well as potentially tendon rupture. As for today, four main drug classes have been reported to be associated with potentially deteriorated tendon properties: 1. Corticosteroids, 2. Chinolon antibiotics, 3. Aromatase inhbitors, 4. Statins as HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors. Most often, the Achilles tendon is affected in terms of tendinopathy and/or subsequent tendon rupture. However, nearly every tendon of the entire body might be affected in a detrimental way by one or a combination of the aformentioned agents.", 
    "251": "Hypercholesterolemia is a serious health problem that is associated not only with heart disease, but also tendon pathology. In high cholesterol environments (e.g. familial hyperlipidemia), lipids accumulate within the tendon extracellular matrix and form deposits called xanthomas. Lipid-related changes are known to affect several tendon mechanical properties, including stiffness and modulus, in uninjured and injured tendons, alike. Mechanisms to explain these cholesterol-related changes are multiple, including alterations in tenocyte gene and protein expression, matrix turnover, tissue vascularity, and cytokine production. Clinically, rotator cuff tear and Achilles tendon rupture are clearly associated with metabolic derangements, and elevated total cholesterol is often among the specific metabolic parameters implicated. Treatment of hypercholesterolemia using statin medications has also been shown to affect tendon properties, resulting in normalization of tendon thickness and improved tendon healing. Despite current work, the pathophysiology of lipid-related tendon pathology remains incompletely understood, and additional hypothesis-generating studies, including those incorporating whole-genome and whole-transcriptome technologies, will help to point the field in new directions.", 
    "252": "Fundamental kidney physiology research can provide important insight into how the kidney works and suggest novel therapeutic opportunities to treat human diseases. This is especially true for nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). Over the past decade, studies elucidating the molecular physiology and signaling pathways regulating water transport have suggested novel therapeutic possibilities. In patients with congenital NDI due to mutations in the type 2 vasopressin receptor (V2R) or acquired NDI due to lithium (or other medications), there are no functional abnormalities in the aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channel, or in another key inner medullary transport protein, the UT-A1 urea transporter. If it is possible to phosphorylate and/or increase the apical membrane accumulation of these proteins, independent of vasopressin or cAMP, one may be able to treat NDI. Sildenifil (through cGMP), erlotinib, and simvastatin each stimulate AQP2 insertion into the apical plasma membrane. Some recent human data suggest that sildenafil and simvastatin may improve urine concentrating ability. ONO-AE1-329 (ONO) stimulates the EP4 prostanoid receptor (EP4), which stimulates kinases that in turn phosphorylate AQP2 and UT-A1. Clopidogrel is a P2Y12-R antagonist that potentiates the effect of vasopressin and increases AQP2 abundance. Metformin stimulates AMPK to phosphorylate and activate AQP2 and UT-A1, and it increases urine concentrating ability in two rodent models of NDI. Since metformin, sildenafil, and simvastatin are commercially available and have excellent safety records, the potential for rapidly advancing them into clinical trials is high.",

Patients with RA were 25% (incidence rate ratio, 1.25, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.35) more likely to have a CV risk factor measured compared with matched controls. The difference declined to 8% (1.08, 1.04 to 1.14) over 5\u2005years of follow-up. The corresponding figures for IBD were 26% (1.26, 1.16 to 1.38) and 10% (1.10, 1.05 to 1.15). Patients with RA showed higher antihypertensive prescription rates during 5\u2005years of follow-up (OR, 1.37, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.65) and patients with IBD showed higher statin prescription rates in the year preceding diagnosis (2.30, 1.20 to 4.42). Incomplete CV risk assessment meant that QRISK scores could be calculated for less than a fifth (17%) and clinical recording of CV disease (CVD) risk scores among patients with RA and IBD was 11% and 6%, respectively.",

    "257": "The most common classifications of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy consist of chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia (PE) and superimposed PE. A common final pathophysiology of PE is endothelial dysfunction. The most successful translational research model for explaining the cause-effect relationship in the genesis of PE is the angiogenic/angiostatic balance theory, involving soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1), placental growth factor (PlGF) and soluble endoglin (sEng). In a systematic review of articles on the prediction of early-onset PE using angiogenesis-related factors, we revealed that the prediction of early-onset PE in the first trimester is clinically possible, but the prediction of early-onset PE in the early third trimester might be ideal. In addition, an onset threshold or a serial approach appeared to be clinically useful for predicting the imminent onset of PE, with onset at <4 weeks after blood sampling in the second and early third trimesters, because the positive likelihood ratio was >10 and the positive predictive value was >20%. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines state that the Triage PlGF testing and Elecsys immunoassay for the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio could help to exclude PE in women with suspected PE at 20-34 weeks of gestation. Until now, we have not found any effective therapies to prevent PE. However, low-dose aspirin treatment starting at \u2a7d16 weeks of gestation might be associated with a marked reduction in PE. In addition, early statin treatment might prevent the occurrence of PE. Currently, a clinical trial using pravastatin for the prevention of PE is ongoing."
