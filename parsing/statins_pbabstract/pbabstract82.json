However, so far, few studies reported increased circulating levels of oxidative stress markers in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver and no study has been performed with newer markers of systemic oxidative stress. The aim was to assess the relationship between urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin F2\u03b1 and serum soluble NOX2-derived peptide and the severity of liver steatosis in subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver.", 
    "1": "The study was performed in 264 consecutive patients referred for suspected metabolic disease. Steatosis was defined according to Hamaguchi ultrasonographic criteria. Oxidative stress was assessed by urinary 8-iso- prostaglandin F2\u03b1 and serum soluble NOX2-derived peptide levels.",

Prevalence of metabolic syndrome and of its clinical features was significantly higher in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver. Same findings were also observed after the exclusion of obese subjects, or subjects with diabetes or with metabolic syndrome and in those not taking statin medication. In addition, the levels of urinary 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1 were independent predictors of non-alcoholic fatty liver and a strong association of urinary 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1 and of serum soluble NOX2-derived peptide with the severity of steatosis at ultrasound was also observed.", 
    "3": "We demonstrated increased markers of oxidative stress in subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver. Urinary 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1 and serum soluble NOX2-derived peptide levels were independent from obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome and increased with the severity of liver steatosis at ultrasound.", 
    "4": "Studies have shown that the oxidative modification of low\u2011density lipoprotein (oxLDL) plays a major role in atherogenesis. Lectin\u2011like oxidized low\u2011density lipoprotein receptor\u20111 (LOX\u20111) mediated the transport of oxLDL into macrophages, which promoted foam cell formation. Targeting LOX\u20111 may therefore be a promising approach to inhibit atherosclerosis. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of berberine combined with atorvastatin on LOX\u20111 and explore the underlying molecular mechanism involved. Expression of LOX\u20111 in monocyte\u2011derived macrophages (MDMs) exposed to berberine (0, 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 nM) and atorvastatin (100 nM) were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot analysis. Results showed that the expression of LOX\u20111 was decreased in a dose\u2011dependent manner. Additionally, knockdown of the endothelin\u20111 (ET\u20111) receptor significantly blocked the inhibitory effect of berberine on LOX\u20111 expression. Body weight (BW), liver weight (LW) and kidney weight (KW) in the model rats were markedly increased at concentrations of berberine \u22651 \u00b5mol/kg, while heart weight (HW) and spleen weight (SW) remained constant among all groups. Berberine combined with atorvastatin also decreased serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and low\u2011density lipoprotein\u2011cholesterol (LDL\u2011C) levels in the rat model as well as inflammation and oxidative stress. Furthermore, plasma ET\u20111 levels and LOX\u20111 expression were decreased by berberine combined with atorvastatin treatment, and the inhibitory effect on LOX\u20111 was impeded by an ET\u20111 receptor antagonist. The results demonstrated that berberine combined with atorvastatin downregulates LOX\u20111 expression through ET\u20111 receptors in monocyte/macrophages in vitro and in vivo.",

Patients with LDL-cholesterol level below 2.5 mmol/l had 8 prescriptions per year. In contrast, patients who had LDL-cholesterol levels above 2.5 mmol/l had only 5.3-6.3 prescriptions per year. Patients who picked up their statins 10-12 or 7-9 times per year had significantly lower LDL-cholesterol level than those who had no or 1-3 pick up. The 100% persistence assessed by doctors was significantly lower (74%) based on data from the National Health Insurance Fund Administration of Hungary. About half of the patients were considered to display 100% adherence to lipid-lowering therapy by their doctors, while data from the National Health Insurance Fund Administration of Hungary showed only 36%. In patients with better adherence (90-100%) LDL-cholesterol levels below 2.5 mmol/l were more frequent (59.5%) compared to those with worse adherence. Satisfaction of doctors with lipid targets achieved was 69-80% in patients with total cholesterol between 4.5 and 6 mmol/l, and satisfaction with higher cholesterol values was also high (53-54%).",

VACNT films were prepared on a Ti substrate by a microwave plasma chemical vapour deposition method and then treated with oxygen plasma to produce the VACNT-GO electrode. The oxygen plasma treatment exfoliates the carbon nanotube tips exposing graphene foils and inserting oxygen functional groups, these effects improved the VACNT wettability (super-hydrophobic) which is crucial for its electrochemical application. The electrochemical behaviour of ATOR on the VACNT-GO electrode was studied by cyclic voltammetry, which showed that it underwent an irreversible oxidation process at a potential of +1.08 V in pHcond 2.0 (0.2 mol L(-1) buffer phosphate solution). By applying DPAdSV under optimized experimental conditions the analytical curve was found to be linear in the ATOR concentration range of 90 to 3.81 \u00d7 10(3) nmol L(-1) with a limit of detection of 9.4 nmol L(-1). The proposed DPAdSV method was successfully applied in the determination of ATOR in pharmaceutical and biological samples, and the results were in close agreement with those obtained by a comparative spectrophotometric method at a confidence level of 95%.", 
    "16": "Excitotoxicity and cytotoxic edema are the two major factors resulting in neuronal injury during brain ischemia and reperfusion. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK II), the downstream signal molecular of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), is a mediator in the excitotoxicity. Aquaporin 4 (AQP4), expressed mainly in the brain, is an important aquaporin to control the flux of water. In a previous study, we had reported that pretreatment of simvastatin protected the cerebrum from ischemia and reperfusion injury by decreasing neurological deficit score and infarct area (Zhu et al. PLoS One 7:e51552, 2012). The present study used a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model to further explore the pleiotropic effect of simvastatin via CaMK II and AQP4. The results showed that simvastatin reduced degenerated cells and brain edema while decreasing the protein expressions of phosphor-CaMK II and AQP4, and increasing the ratios of Bcl-2/Bax, which was independent of cholesterol-lowering effect. Immunocomplexes formed between the subunit of NMDARs-NR3A and AQP4 were detected for the first time. It was concluded that simvastatin could protect the cerebrum from neuronal excitotoxicity and cytotoxic edema by downregulating the expressions of phosphor-CaMK II and AQP4, and that the interaction between NR3A and AQP4 might provide the base for AQP4 involving in the signaling pathways mediated by NMDARs.",

This review summarizes recent genetic, metabolic, and clinical findings and presents an update on management strategies.", 
    "18": "Cases of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma have now been identified in heterozygous familial hypobetalipoproteinemia probably because of decreased triglyceride transport capacity from the liver. ANGPTL3 mutations cause low levels of LDL-cholesterol and low HDL-cholesterol in compound heterozygotes and homozygous individuals, decrease reverse cholesterol transport, and lower glucose levels. The effect on atherosclerosis is unknown; however, severe fatty liver has been identified. Loss-of-function mutations in PCSK9 cause familial hypobetalipoproteinemia, which appears to lower risk for coronary artery disease and has no adverse sequelae. Phase III clinical trials are now underway examining the effect of PCSK9 inhibitors on cardiovascular events in combination with statin drugs.",

The concept of a combination pill, or \"polypill,\" composed of aspirin, antihypertensives, and a statin has been suggested to simplify and improve the prevention and treatment of CVD. Individually, these medications have been shown to effectively modify risk factors of CVD, and a single pill composed of these medications has the potential to conveniently and cost effectively provide additive benefits in relative risk reduction. In particular, the polypill concept presents significant potential for reducing the impact of cardiovascular disease in low- and middle-income countries where populations account for >80% of all CVD-related deaths worldwide. Using a polypill as the primary way to prevent CVD has been proposed as a broad \"vaccination\" strategy to treat asymptomatic individuals based solely on age or the presence of risk factors.", 
    "21": "Several clinical trials have shown that combination pills are well tolerated and have lower relative risk by as much as 60-70% by moderately reducing blood pressure and LDL-cholesterol. However, uncertainty remains in regards to long-term adherence, cost effectiveness, and \"medicalization\" of asymptomatic individuals, who account for a large percentage of the world's population. Furthermore, more data regarding CVD outcomes is required to evaluate the widespread use of a polypill in primary prevention.",

The promising results of completed clinical trials have lead to the approval of polypill formulations (e.g., Polycap, Trinomia\u00ae, or Zycad) and several large clinical trials are posed to present new data regarding outcomes and adherence.", 
    "23": "Based on studies that date back to the 1920s, regression and stabilization of atherosclerosis in humans has gone from just a dream to one that is achievable. Review of the literature indicates that the successful attempts at regression generally applied robust measures to improve plasma lipoprotein profiles. Examples include extensive lowering of plasma concentrations of atherogenic apolipoprotein B and enhancement of reverse cholesterol transport from atheromata to the liver.", 
    "24": "Possible mechanisms responsible for lesion shrinkage include decreased retention of atherogenic apolipoprotein B within the arterial wall, efflux of cholesterol and other toxic lipids from plaques, emigration of lesional foam cells out of the arterial wall, and influx of healthy phagocytes that remove necrotic debris as well as other components of the plaque. This review will highlight the role key players such as LXR, HDL and CCR7 have in mediating regression.",

In spite of statin treatment, residual risk of CVD remains high in type 2 diabetes, and this may relate to HTG and atherogenic dyslipidemia. Treatment of HTG emphasises correcting secondary factors and adverse lifestyles, in particular, diet and exercise. Pharmacotherapy is also required in most type 2 diabetic patients. Statins are the first-line therapy to achieve recommended therapeutic targets of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Fibrates, ezetimibe and n-3 fatty acids are adjunctive treatment options for residual and persistent HTG. Evidence for the use of niacin has been challenged by non-significant CVD outcomes in two recent large clinical trials. Further investigation is required to clarify the use of incretin-based therapies for HTG in type 2 diabetes. Extreme HTG, with risk of pancreatitis, may require insulin infusion therapy or apheresis. New therapies targeting HTG in diabetes need to be tested in clinical endpoint trials. The purpose of this review is to examine the current evidence and provide practical guidance on the management of HTG in type 2 diabetes.",

In light of our previous findings concerning the biological effects of certain epoxidated all-trans-polyisoprenes, the effects of squalene carrying epoxy moieties on the second and third isoprene residues were investigated here. In cultures of HepG2 cells both monoepoxides of squalene and one of their hydrolytic products inhibited cholesterol synthesis and stimulated the synthesis of coenzyme Q (CoQ). Upon prolonged treatment the cholesterol content of these cells and its labeling with [(3)H]mevalonate were reduced, while the amount and labeling of CoQ increased. Injection of the squalene monoepoxides into mice once daily for 6days elevated the level of CoQ in their blood, but did not change the cholesterol level. The same effects were observed upon treatment of apoE-deficient mice and diabetic GK-rats. This treatment increased the hepatic level of CoQ10 in mice, but the amount of CoQ9, which is the major form, was unaffected. The presence of the active compounds in the blood was supported by the finding that cholesterol synthesis in the white blood cells was inhibited. Since the ratio of CoQ9/CoQ10 varies depending on the experimental conditions, the cells were titrated with substrate and inhibitors, leading to the conclusion that the intracellular isopentenyl-PP pool is a regulator of this ratio. Our present findings indicate that oxidosqualenes may be useful for stimulating both the synthesis and level of CoQ both in vitro and in vivo.",

However, differences appear to exist between different classes of agents, with statins and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system having the more favorable effects on arterial stiffness. A multifactorial approach appears to be the optimal management of increased arterial stiffness in patients with MetS.",

Men enrolled in Prostate Cancer Genetics Project were surveyed to determine statin medication use history from 1999 to 2009. Diagnosis and treatment data were taken from medical records. BCR was defined as a single increase in prostate-specific antigen level to \u22650.4 ng/mL after treatment with RRP. Statin use was modeled as a time-dependent variable, and BCR after RRP was both examined using crude Cox proportional hazards models and adjusted for known clinical prognostic factors.", 
    "44": "A total of 539 men treated with RRP were included in this study. Of these, 47.9% of men used statin medications, and 115 (21%) men experienced a recurrence.

    "46": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common disease with increasing prevalence, presenting with impaired walking ability affecting patient's quality of life. PAD epidemiology is known, however, mechanisms underlying functional muscle impairment remain unclear. Using a mouse PAD model, aim of this study was to assess muscle adaptive responses during early (1 week) and late (5 weeks) disease stages. Unilateral hindlimb ischemia was induced in ApoE(-/-) mice by iliac artery ligation. Ischemic limb perfusion and oxygenation (Laser Doppler imaging, transcutaneous oxygen pressure assessments) significantly decreased during early and late stage compared to pre-ischemia, however, values were significantly higher during late versus early phase. Number of arterioles and arteriogenesis-linked gene expression increased at later stage. Walking ability, evaluated by forced and voluntary walking tests, remained significantly decreased both at early and late phase without any significant improvement. Muscle glucose uptake ([18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography) significantly increased during early ischemia decreasing at later stage. Gene expression analysis showed significant shift in muscle M1/M2 macrophages and Th1/Th2 T cells balance toward pro-inflammatory phenotype during early ischemia; later, inflammatory state returned to neutrality. Muscular M1/M2 shift inhibition by a statin prevented impaired walking ability in early ischemia. High-energy phosphate metabolism remained unchanged (31-Phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy). Results show that rapid transient muscular inflammation contributes to impaired walking capacity while increased glucose uptake may be a compensatory mechanisms preserving immediate limb viability during early ischemia in a mouse PAD model. With time, increased ischemic limb perfusion and oxygenation assure muscle viability although not sufficiently to improve walking impairment. Subsequent decreased muscle glucose uptake may partly contribute to chronic walking impairment. Early inflammation inhibition and/or late muscle glucose impairment prevention are promising strategies for PAD management.", 
    "47": "Primary prevention guidelines focus on risk, often assuming negligible aversion to medication, yet most patients discontinue primary prevention statins within 3 years. We quantify real-world distribution of medication disutility and separately calculate the average utilities for a range of risk strata.", 
    "48": "We randomly sampled 360 members of the general public in London. Medication aversion was quantified as the gain in lifespan required by each individual to offset the inconvenience (disutility) of taking an idealized daily preventative tablet. In parallel, we constructed tables of expected gain in lifespan (utility) from initiating statin therapy for each age group, sex, and cardiovascular risk profile in the population. This allowed comparison of the widths of the distributions of medication disutility and of group-average expectation of longevity gain. Observed medication disutility ranged from 1 day to >10 years of life being required by subjects (median, 6 months; interquartile range, 1-36 months) to make daily preventative therapy worthwhile. Average expected longevity benefit from statins at ages \u226550 years ranges from 3.6 months (low-risk women) to 24.3 months (high-risk men).", 
    "49": "We can no longer assume that medication disutility is almost zero. Over one-quarter of subjects had disutility exceeding the group-average longevity gain from statins expected even for the highest-risk (ie, highest-gain) group. Future primary prevention studies might explore medication disutility in larger populations. Patients may differ more in disutility than in prospectively definable utility (which provides only group-average estimates). Consultations could be enriched by assessing disutility and exploring its reasons.",

For the ROR, a signal was detected if the lower limit of 95 % two-sided confidence interval (95 % CI) was >1. Additionally, signal detection using the IC was conducted using the IC025 metric, a lower limit of the 95 % CI of the IC, where a signal is detected if the IC025 value exceeds 0.

Patients on background atorvastatin (continued on starting dose or titrated to 40 mg, if needed) were randomized to FA 135 mg or placebo. The primary end point was rate of change from baseline through week 104 of the mean posterior-wall cIMT, measured by ultrasound. In patients with controlled low-density lipoprotein cholesterol while on atorvastatin background therapy, rate of change in posterior-wall cIMT was similar with FA plus atorvastatin (-0.006 mm/y) versus atorvastatin monotherapy (0.000 mm/y; P=0.22). FA plus atorvastatin was favored (P<0.05) in 5 of 24 prespecified subgroups: age \u226560 years, history of coronary artery disease, cIMT >0.795 mm, triglycerides 170 to 235 mg/dL, and statin use at entry.

Ectopic liver lipid, particularly diacylglycerol, exacerbates hepatic insulin resistance, promotes systemic inflammation, and increases risk of developing both type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Increasing evidence suggests that NAFLD is an emerging risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and although there are currently no licensed treatments for NAFLD per se, current evidence suggests that statin treatment is safe in NAFLD. Presently, there is insufficient evidence to indicate that statins or other cardioprotective agents, such as angiotensin receptor blockers, are effective in treating NAFLD. In this brief narrative review, we discuss the diagnosis of NAFLD and the role of ectopic liver fat to cause insulin resistance and to increase risk of both type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. For this review, PubMed was searched for articles using the key words non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or fatty liver combined with diabetes risk, cardiovascular risk, and cardiovascular mortality between 1990 and 2014.

    "59": "Aggressively managing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) after myocardial infarction (MI) is a cornerstone of secondary prevention. The changes in LDL-C after MI and the factors associated with LDL-C levels are unknown. Therefore, we directly measured fasting LDL-C levels in 797 MI patients from 24 US hospitals from 2005 to 2008. Mean LDL-C levels at discharge, 1 month, and 6 months were 95.1, 81.9, and 87.1 mg/dL, respectively. In a hierarchical, multivariable, repeated measures model, older age, male sex, and hypertension were associated with lower LDL-C levels, whereas self-reported avoidance of health care because of cost was associated with higher LDL-C. Both the presence and intensity of statin therapy at discharge were strongly associated with LDL-C levels, with adjusted mean 6-month changes of -3.4 mg/dL (95% confidence interval (CI): -12.1, 5.3) for no statins; 1.7 mg/dL (95% CI: -4.7, 8.1) for low statins; -10.2 mg/dL (95% CI: -14.5, -6.0) for moderate statins; and -13.9 mg/dL (95% CI: -19.7, -8.0) for intensive statins (P < 0.001). In conclusion, we found that greater reductions in LDL-C levels after MI were strongly associated with the presence and intensity of statin therapy, older age, male sex, hypertension, and better socioeconomic status. These findings support the use of intensive statin therapy in post-MI patients and provide estimates of the expected LDL-C changes after MI in a real-world population.",

When they occur prenatally, they are associated with a decreased maternal unconjugated estriol (uE(3)) level. Cholesterol plays an essential role in the Sonic Hedgehog pathway, allowing Shh protein maturation leading to its maximal activity. Many malformations in these two syndromes occur in Shh dependent tissues. We thus sought to assess whether a cholesterol defect could affect the Shh pathway and explain some of the observed malformations.", 
    "61": "We selected 14 cases of trisomy 18 and 3 cases of SLO in which the maternal uE(3) level was decreased and reported malformations were observed after fetopathological examination. We correlated the number of malformations with maternal uE(3) level. We then carried out cholesterol concentrations in separate culture media consisting of trisomy 18, SLO and control amniocytes. Finally, we analyzed the Shh pathway by testing the gene expression of several Shh components: GLI transcription factors, BMP2, BMP4, TGF\u03b21, COL1A1 and COL1A2.", 
    "62": "There was an inverse correlation between phenotypic severity and maternal uE(3) levels in SLO and trisomy 18. The cholesterol levels in the amniocyte culture media were correlated with maternal uE3 levels and were significantly lower in T18 and SLO amniocytes, reflecting cholesterol defects. There was an alteration in the Shh pathway since expression of several genes was decreased in T18 and SLO amniocytes. However, these cholesterol defects were not solely responsible for the altered Shh pathway and the malformations observed.",

The OB consisted of the determination of the plasmatic hydroperoxides (reactive oxygen metabolites [d-ROMs] test) and the antioxidant reserve (plasma antioxidants test [PAT]). The d-ROMs/CH and PAT/CH ratios allowed to measure, respectively, the oxidative index (OI) and the protective index (PI).

AP cases were defined by ICD-9 CM 577.0 and serum lipase\u22653 times normal. Patients were censored at death, last follow-up, and onset of AP or end-of-study. Incidence rate of pancreatitis among simvastatin users was compared with the adult reference population. Robust Poisson regression was used to generate risk ratio (RR) estimates for simvastatin use adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, gallstone-related disorders, hypertriglyceridaemia, smoking and alcohol dependence. Analysis was repeated for atorvastatin.",

A total of 707,236 patients received simvastatin during the study period. Patients that received simvastatin were more likely to have gallstone-related disorders, alcohol dependence or hypertriglyceridaemia compared with the reference population. Nevertheless, risk of AP was significantly reduced with simvastatin use, crude incidence rate ratio 0.626 (95% CL 0.588, 0.668), p<0.0001. In multivariate analysis, simvastatin was independently associated with reduced risk of pancreatitis, adjusted RR 0.29 (95% CL 0.27, 0.31) after adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, gallstone disorders, alcohol dependence, smoking and hypertriglyceridaemia.

The mean (SD) vitamin D level in patients experiencing myalgia was 26.2 (12.9) versus 36.3 (11.8) ng/mL. The 25-hydroxyvitamin D level in those who reported myalgia was approximately 10 ng/mL lower compared with those who tolerated simvastatin 80 mg (P = 0.0003). There was no statistically significant association between length of therapy and development of myalgia.",

Vitamin D insufficiency appears to be a risk factor for the development of myalgia.", 
    "76": "Hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, and oleuropein, the main phenols present in extra virgin olive oil, have been reported to exert several biochemical and pharmacological effects. Here, we investigated the short-term effects of these compounds on lipid synthesis in primary-cultured rat-liver cells. Hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol and oleuropein inhibited both de novo fatty acid and cholesterol syntheses without an effect on cell viability. The inhibitory effect of individual compounds was already evident within 2 h of 25 \u03bcM phenol addition to the hepatocytes. The degree of cholesterogenesis reduction was similar for all phenol treatments (-25/30%), while fatty acid synthesis showed the following order of inhibition: hydroxytyrosol (-49%) = oleuropein (-48%) > tyrosol (-30%). A phenol-induced reduction of triglyceride synthesis was also detected. To clarify the lipid-lowering mechanism of these compounds, their influence on the activity of key enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis (acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase), triglyceride synthesis (diacylglycerol acyltransferase) and cholesterogenesis (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase) was investigated in situ by using digitonin-permeabilized hepatocytes. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase, diacylglycerol acyltransferase and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase activities were reduced after 2 h of 25 \u03bcM phenol treatment. No change in fatty acid synthase activity was observed. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibition (hydroxytyrosol, -41%, = oleuropein, -38%, > tyrosol, -17%) appears to be mediated by phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase. These findings suggest that a decrease in hepatic lipid synthesis may represent a potential mechanism underlying the reported hypolipidemic effect of phenols of extra virgin olive oil.",

All patients were also tested for antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens and myositis related antibodies. To verify the specificity of the ELISA, 824 controls were tested. All three assays showed qualitative agreements of 100% and levels of anti-HMGCR antibodies showed significant correlation: Spearman's rho > 0.8. The mean age of the anti-HMGCR antibody positive patients was 54.4 years, 16/20 were females, and 18/20 had necrotizing myopathy (two patients were not diagnosed). Nine out of 20 anti-HMGCR positive patients were on statin. All patients with anti-HMGCR antibodies were negative for all other autoantibodies tested.

A recent report suggests that vitamin D (VD) levels are closely associated with lipid lowering activity and muscular toxicity of statins. However, data are limited and inconclusive. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of VD supplementation on the bioavailability and lipid lowering effect of simvastatin (ST).

After the dosing period of 8 days the animals were sacrificed and the blood was collected for the analysis of ST, its active metabolite simvastatin acid (STA), total cholesterol, triglyceride and liver enzymes including aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase. The result of this study showed a significant decrease in the level of cholesterol and triglyceride in ST alone treated group, whereas VD alone failed to alter the blood lipid levels. Concomitant treatment with VD produced significant decrease in the bioavailability of ST and STA. However, there was no significant difference in the level of cholesterol in ST alone and in ST + VD treated group. Our results on the liver enzyme suggest that ST alone or in combination with VD does not produce any hepatotoxicity. Further studies using VD along with various statins for a longer duration are suggested.",

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) studies were performed in 56 consecutive CE patients with LDL-c less than 140 mg/dL who were not taking lipid-lowering agents at baseline. CAP observed by TEE was defined as the presence of greater than 4-mm diameter, ulcerated, or mobile aortic plaque. Patients were divided into those with CAP versus without CAP (group A, n=24, age 69\u00b18 years) and without CAP (group B, n=32, age 62\u00b110 years). Of the 24 group A patients, 18 received 5 mg/d of rosuvastatin for 6 months and had follow-up TEE studies. In Group A, the baseline values of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c) and apolipoprotein A-1 (ApoA-1) were significantly lower than in Group B (44\u00b115 versus 55\u00b115 mg/dL, P=.0059; 103\u00b119 versus 137\u00b125 mg/dL, P=.0006, respectively) and age and serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentration were significantly higher (69\u00b18 vs. 62\u00b110 years, P=.0080; 2.34\u00b13.05 vs. 0.67\u00b11.00 mg/dL, P=.0054, respectively). By multivariate logistic regression analysis, ApoA-1 was shown to be an independent predictor of CAP (odds ratio=.894, 95% confidence intervals .800-.996, P=.0483). In the 18 group A patients receiving rosuvastatin for 6 months, aortic arch plaque diameter and serum LDL-c were significantly decreased (5.8\u00b12.2 to 5.1\u00b12.1 mm, P=.0377; 110\u00b123 to 81\u00b123 mg/dL, P=.0008, respectively), whereas serum HDL-c and ApoA-1 concentrations were significantly increased (42\u00b18 to 52\u00b19 mg/dL, P=.0002; 109\u00b122 to 135\u00b115 mg/dL, P=.0002, respectively).

    "88": "Statins can significantly reduce low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and modestly raise or not alter high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C). However, their impact on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) subfractions has been less examined. The aim of the present study was to investigate the short-term impact of low-dose atorvastatin on HDL and LDL subfractions in humans. In this randomized study, data from 52 subjects were analysed. Thirty-seven patients with atherosclerosis were randomized to treatment with atorvastatin 10 mg/day (n = 17) or 20 mg/day (n = 20) for 8 weeks, with 15 healthy subjects without therapy used as a control group. The lipid profile and lipoprotein subfractions were determined using the Lipoprint system at baseline and at 8 weeks. The data suggest that atorvastatin treatment (10 and 20 mg/day) for 8 weeks significantly decreases LDL-C levels and reduces the cholesterol concentration of all LDL subfractions, which is accompanied by an increase of the mean LDL particle size. Although 10 mg/day atorvastatin treatment for 8 weeks had no impact on the HDL subfraction, 20 mg/day atorvastatin for 8 weeks significantly increased the cholesterol concentration of large HDL particles and decreased the cholesterol concentration of small HDL particles without changing serum HDL-C levels in patients with atherosclerosis. Therefore, the results suggest that 20 mg/day atorvastatin treatment for 8 weeks may result in a favourable modification of the HDL subfraction phenotype in addition to its effects on the cholesterol concentration of all LDL subfractions and mean LDL particle size.",

An in vitro release experiment was performed and revealed that TNTs and micelles can jointly provide a sustained release of SV, and that TNTs alone might function in drug release. The effect of the Ti surface with TNTs or TNTs-micelles on osteoblast-like MG-63 cells was determined by analyzing cell morphology, cytoskeletal arrangement, early adhesion, proliferation, alkaline phosphatase activity, and intracellular and extracellular osteocalcin content. The results indicate that the Ti surface with SV-loaded TNTs-micelles not only has better able to promote early adhesion, spreading and early differentiation of osteoblasts than the Ti surface with TNTs alone but it is able to promote calcification of osteoblasts. Therefore, a Ti surface with TNTs or TNTs-micelles is expected to promote contact osteogenesis of the Ti implant, thus contributing to early osseointegration of the implant, whereas the osteogenic effect of the Ti surface with TNTs-micelles is expected to be stronger. This local delivery system can bridge the gap between basic research and applied science for a wide range of titanium-based orthopedic implants in diverse bone-loss diseases, including osteoporosis.",

A total of 84 elderly hypercholesterolemic patients complicated with carotid atherosclerosis were divided into control group (atorvastatin alone) and combined group (atorvastatin combined with ezetimibe) and treated for 12 months. Carotid atherosclerosis-related indicators including blood lipid and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were determined before and after treatment. The levels of carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and hsCRP were markedly decreased (P < 0.05) after treatment in the two groups, while the reduction of the levels of CIMT, serum LDL-C and hsCRP was more significant in the combined group (P < 0.01). After treatment, the levels of CIMT, serum LDL-C and hsCRP were distinctly different between combined and control group (P < 0.05). The combination of atorvastatin with ezetimibe could further decrease LDL-C and hsCRP levels and have certain effects on the progression of carotid atherosclerosis in elderly patients with hypercholesterolemia.",

Two hundred eighty-eight patients were divided into a control group, an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) group, and a stable coronary heart disease (CHD) group. Blood biochemical indices were determined using the enzyme method, and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis was performed to study the TaqIB polymorphism of the CETP gene. The ACS and stable CHD groups were treated with atorvastatin, and blood lipid levels were reexamined after three months. Plasma levels of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and lipoprotein(a) were all significantly higher in the ACS and stable CHD groups compared to the control group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). After three months of treatment with atorvastatin, plasma levels of TC, LDL-C, triglycerides (TG) (only in patients with genotype B2B2), and lipoprotein(a) (only in patients with genotype B1B2) were all significantly decreased (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). After treatment, the plasma level of TG was lower in patients with genotype B2B2 compared to patients with genotypes B1B1 or B1B2 (B1 carriers) (P < 0.01). Therefore, the CETP TaqIB polymorphism is associated with the lipid-lowering effect of atorvastatin in patients with CHD.",

This study will explore the effect of ursolic acid on OAPT1B1-mediated transport of rosuvastatin in the different cell systems. Given the genetic polymorphisms of OATP1B1, simultaneously, this study will further explore the effect of ursolic acid on OATP1B1 (521T>C)-mediated transport of rosuvastatin. When the concentration of ursolic acid was 1.8 and 18 \u00b5M, it showed that ursolic acid significantly inhibits the uptake of rosuvastatin in both OATP1B1*1a-HEK 293T cells and OATP1B1*5-HEK 293T cells.

We conducted a detailed meta-analysis of all relevant original studies to evaluate the effects of statin on the risk of gynecologic cancers. Methods. We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library databases up to February 2014 looking for eligible studies. Summary relative risk (RR) estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to calculate the risk using random-effects models. Results. A total of 14 (4 randomized controlled trials, 5 cohorts, and 5 case-control) studies, involving 12,904 gynecologic cancer cases, contributed to the analysis. Pooled results indicated a non-significant decrease of total gynecologic cancer risk among statin users (RR=0.89; 95% CI, 0.78-1.01). Stratified analyses across cancer site revealed a modest protective effect of statin on ovarian cancer (RR=0.79; 95% CI, 0.64-0.98), while no association was found for endometrial cancer (RR=0.90; 95% CI, 0.75-1.07). The effect of statin use against cervical cancer and vulvar cancer is not conclusive. Furthermore, long-term statin use (>5years use) did not significantly affect the risk of endometrial cancer (RR=0.69; 95% CI, 0.44-1.10), but had an obvious decrease on the risk of ovarian cancer (RR=0.48; 95% CI, 0.28-0.80). Conclusions. Our results suggest that statin use was inversely associated with ovarian cancer risk, and the association was stronger for long-term statin use (>5years). The evidence for a protective effect of statin use against other gynecologic cancers is suggestive but not conclusive, which deserves further investigation.",

Patients were eligible for enrolment if they were aged 18 years or older, diagnosed with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, and had not reached target LDL cholesterol concentrations after at least 8 weeks of statin therapy with or without ezetimibe. We used a computer-generated randomisation sequence to allocate patients to one of three groups: 50 \u03bcg eprotirome, 100 \u03bcg eprotirome, or placebo. This trial was planned for 52-76 weeks, with primary efficacy analysis at 12 weeks, but it was prematurely terminated when another study found that eprotirome causes cartilage damage in dogs. Although it was impossible to meet the predefined study outcomes, we analysed changes in the concentrations of LDL cholesterol and other lipids, liver parameters, thyroid hormone concentrations, and adverse effects of treatment with eprotirome versus placebo at 6 weeks of treatment.

In addition, the cumulative probability of cerebrovascular events at 52 weeks was significantly lower in the IAT group than in the LAT group, although there was no statistical difference between the IAT group and the SAT group. The proportion of patients experiencing any adverse event was similar among the three treatment groups. Adverse events caused by IAT were generally mild; no serious adverse events occurred throughout the entire period of study.",

One of the key enzyme of this pathway is the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, which catalyses the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate. HMG-CoA reductase therefore affects many biological processes, such as morphogenesis, synthesis of different metabolites or adaptation to environmental changes. In this study, transcription of the three HMG-CoA reductase genes (designated as hmgR1, hmgR2 and hmgR3) of the \u03b2-carotene producing Mucor circinelloides has been analysed under various culturing conditions; effect of the elevation of their copy number on the carotenoid and ergosterol content as well as on the sensitivity to statins has also been examined.",

Transcripts of hmgR1 were detected only in the mycelium and its relative transcript level seems to be strongly controlled by the temperature and the oxygen level of the environment. Transcripts of hmgR2 and hmgR3 are already present in the germinating spores and the latter is also strongly regulated by oxygen. Overexpression of hmgR2 and hmgR3 by elevating their copy numbers increased the carotenoid content of the fungus and decreased their sensitivity to statins.",

Our aim is to investigate the influence of statins and ASA on prostate cancer survival, when comorbidity is adjusted for, in men treated with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for prostate cancer. Methods. A cohort of 3851 patients with prostate cancer treated with curative EBRT \u00b1 androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) between 2000 and 2007. Stage, treatment, medication use, and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) scores were analyzed. Results. Median followup was 8.4 years. Mean age was 70.3 years. Neoadjuvant ADT was used in 67%. Statins were used in 23%, ASA in 24%, and both in 11%. Comorbidity scores were 0 in 65%, 1 in 25%, and \u22652 in 10% of patients. Statin and ASA use were associated with increased age and comorbidity. Although statin and ASA use were significantly associated with improved prostate cancer specific survival (PCSS) on univariate analysis, neither were on multivariate analysis. Conclusion. Neither statin nor ASA use impacted PCSS on multivariate competing risks analysis. Survival was impacted by increased comorbidity as well as statin and ASA use.",

The current chemotherapy for leishmaniasis presents several drawbacks like toxicity and increased resistance to existing drugs, and hence, there is a necessity to look out for the novel drug targets and new chemical entities. Current trend in drug discovery arena is the \"repurposing\" of old drugs for the treatment of diseases. In the present study, an antidepressant, ketanserin, was found lethal to both Leishmania donovani promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes with no apparent toxicity to the cells. Ketanserin killed promastigotes and amastigotes with an IC50 value of 37 \u03bcM and 28\u00a0\u03bcM respectively, in a dose-dependent manner. Ketanserin was found to inhibit L. donovani recombinant 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) enzyme with an IC50 value of 43\u00a0\u03bcM. Ketanserin\u00a0treated promastigotes were exogenously supplemented with sterols like ergosterol and cholesterol to rescue cell death. Ergosterol could recover the inhibition partially, whereas cholesterol supplementation completely failed to rescue the inhibited parasites. Further, HMGR-overexpressing parasites were generated by transfecting Leishmania promastigotes with an episomal psp\u03b1 hygro\u03b1-HMGR construct. Wild-type and HMGR overexpressors of L. donovani were used to study the effect and mode of action of this inhibitor. The HMGR overexpressors showed twofold resistance to ketanserin. These observations suggest that the lethal effect of ketanserin is due to inhibition of HMGR, the rate-limiting enzyme of the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway. Since targeting of the sterol biosynthetic pathway enzymes may be useful therapeutically, the present study may have implications in treatment of leishmaniasis.",

All patients were taking statins and\u00a0were grouped according to whether statins were continued or held in the 24 hours before operation. The primary outcome was AKI as defined by a doubling of serum creatinine or dialysis. The secondary outcome was the peak level of several kidney injury biomarkers. The results were adjusted for demographic and clinical factors.", 
    "201": "Continuing (vs holding) a statin before operation was not associated with a lower risk of AKI, as\u00a0defined by a doubling of serum creatinine or dialysis\u00a0(adjusted relative risk [RR] 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.44, 2.70). However, continuing a statin was\u00a0associated with a lower risk of elevation of the following AKI\u00a0biomarkers: urine interleukin-18, urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, urine kidney injury molecule-1, and plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (adjusted RR 0.34; 95% CI 0.18, 0.62), (adjusted RR 0.41; 95% CI 0.22, 0.76), (adjusted RR 0.37; 95% CI 0.20, 0.76), (adjusted RR 0.62; 95% CI 0.39, 0.98), respectively.",

This impaired glucose tolerance can be transient, reflecting an acute stress response, or\u00a0persistent, representing undiagnosed impaired glucose metabolism possibly requiring treatment. We aimed to assess the occurrence of persistent impaired glucose tolerance after a stroke or TIA and to develop a prediction model to identify patients at risk of persistent impaired glucose tolerance.",

The oral glucose tolerance test was repeated after 3\u00a0months and patients were classified as having transient impaired glucose tolerance or persistent impaired glucose tolerance. We developed a prediction model by means of a multivariable logistic regression model. We calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to quantify the performance of the model and the internal validity by bootstrapping.", 
    "205": "Of the 101 patients included, 53 (52%) had persistent impaired glucose tolerance or progression to diabetes. These patients were older and more often had hypertension and used statins. A prediction model including age, current smoking, statin use, triglyceride, hypertension, previous ischemic cardiovascular disease, body mass index, and fasting plasma glucose accurately predicted persistent impaired glucose tolerance (bootstrapped AUC, .777), with statin use, triglyceride, and fasting plasma glucose as the most important predictors.",

Ezetimibe, an inhibitor of the Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 cholesterol transporter, is a relatively new drug for LDL-C-lowering therapy in addition to statins. However, comparison between an aggressive LDL-C-lowering therapy with a combination of statin and ezetimibe versus a standard LDL-C-lowering therapy with statin alone is still unclear in terms of their effects on stabilization and volume regression of coronary plaque. The ZIPANGU (Ezetimibe clinical investigation for the regression of intracoronary plaque evaluated by angioscopy and ultrasound) study is aimed at comparing these two types of therapy based on indices of plaque characteristics using non-obstructive coronary angioscopy and intravascular ultrasound.",

Through a centralized enrollment method, patients will be allocated to either monotherapy with atorvastatin alone or to combination therapy with atorvastatin (maximum: 20mg/day) and ezetimibe (10mg/day). The target LDL-C level will be <100mg/dL for the monotherapy group and <70mg/dL for the combination therapy group. At the baseline and the follow-up period of 9 months, non-obstructive coronary angioscopy and intravascular ultrasound will be performed to compare the changes in plaque color and volume between the two groups.",

Although meta-analysis from observational studies showed that the use of statins was associated with a survival advantage, these outcomes were limited by high heterogeneity and possible bias in the data. Therefore, we should be cautious about the use of statins in infection and sepsis.", 
    "214": "The increased uptake and storage of lipids in the liver are important features of steatotic liver diseases. The fatty acid translocase/scavenger receptor cluster of differentiation (CD)36 facilitates the hepatic uptake of lipids. We investigated if RRR-\u03b1-tocopherol (\u03b1T) alone or in combination with atorvastatin (ATV) is capable of preventing hepatic lipid accumulation via down-regulation of CD36. To this end, Dunkin Hartley guinea pigs were fed a control diet (5% fat); or a high-fat control diet (21% fat, 0.15% cholesterol); or a high-fat control diet fortified with \u03b1T (250 mg/kg diet), ATV (300 mg/kg diet) or both ATV+\u03b1T for 6 weeks. Hepatic triacylglycerols, hepatic protein and mRNA expression of CD36 as well as the mRNA expression of the controlling nuclear receptors LXR\u03b1, PXR and PPAR\u03b3 were determined. Animals fed the high-fat control diet accumulated significantly more triacylglycerols in the liver than control animals. This was significantly reduced by ATV and numerically by \u03b1T and ATV+\u03b1T. Hepatic CD36 protein concentrations were significantly higher in the high-fat than in the control group, and both \u03b1T and ATV reduced CD36 expression to the level observed in the control group. However, no synergistic effect of the combined treatment was observed. Neither CD36 mRNA nor that of the nuclear receptors (LXR\u03b1, PXR and PPAR\u03b3) differed between groups, suggesting a posttranslational regulatory mechanism. Our results indicate that orally administered ATV and \u03b1T individually, but not synergistically, prevent diet-induced lipid accumulation in the liver of guinea pigs by down-regulation of hepatic CD36 protein.", 
    "215": "As a population ages, an increase in the number of patients with cardiac complications who undergo non-cardiac surgeries is observed. The perioperative mortality for noncardiac surgery is approximately 1-5%; approximately 20-35% of these cases are due to cardiovascular complications. Among them, perioperative myocardiac infarction/ischemia is a factor that leads to poor prognosis, and the ACC/AHA guidelines emphasize this aspect. An important task of the anesthesiologist is to accurately assess risks in patients undergoing noncardiac surgeries and avoid adverse cardiovascular events.", 
    "216": "Fibric acid derivatives like fenofibric acid (FA) decrease hepatic production of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-associated triglycerides (TG). Hepatic VLDL production can be estimated from VLDL-associated cholesterol (VLDL-C). We assessed if the degree of TG reduction observed with FA, statins, or their combination is associated with baseline VLDL-C. Overall, 2,715 patients with mixed dyslipidemia in three randomized, controlled studies were assigned to one of six treatment strategies: FA, low-dose statin (LDS), FA\u2009+\u2009LDS, moderate-dose statin (MDS), FA\u2009+\u2009MDS, and high-dose statin (HDS). Patients were dichotomized into low- or high-baseline VLDL-C groups. Pooled data were used to compare the degree of TG reduction in patients with low- vs. high-baseline VLDL-C for each treatment arm, using unpaired, two-sided t test. Additionally, the association between baseline VLDL-C level and percentage TG reduction from baseline was evaluated by linear regression. Diagnostic performance of baseline VLDL-C levels in predicting 5, 10, 15, and 20% TG reduction was assessed by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. In all treatment groups, following 12 weeks of therapy, a significantly greater percent change from baseline in TG was observed in the high-baseline VLDL-C group as compared with the low-baseline VLDL-C group. Linear regression analysis indicated that approximately 6 to 13% of the decrease in TG could be explained by baseline VLDL-C. ROC-derived cut points for baseline VLDL-C were obtained for 5, 10, 15, and 20% TG reduction. Baseline VLDL-C levels are associated with the degree of TG lowering using FA, statins, or their combination, thereof.",

At baseline, 44% of GADA-positive patients were not on insulin. Fewer autoantibody-positive than autoantibody-negative patients had metabolic syndrome (64 vs. 80%), and more were on insulin (56 vs. 17%) (P < 0.0001 for each) without lower HbA1c (69 mmol/mol [8.5%] vs. 62 mmol/mol [7.8%]).

After 11.8 years' diabetes duration, nearly half the patients with autoimmune diabetes were not on insulin treatment and almost two-thirds had metabolic syndrome. The type of diabetes, whether autoimmune diabetes or type 2 diabetes, did not impact the risk of microvascular disease.", 
    "221": "Statins form the backbone of lipid-lowering therapy in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Numerous studies have evaluated the effect of genomics on the clinical efficacy and adverse effects of statins. Several gene variants that can be linked to either the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of statins have been identified as potentially important, although there are some discrepant findings among studies. Effect sizes are modest for lipid-lowering efficacy and perhaps somewhat larger for risk of myopathy, although results are inconsistent. Pharmacogenomics of nonstatin lipid-lowering agents have not been evaluated to the same extent, given their relatively limited use, although there are some promising candidate genes for further study. Finally, with several new classes of lipid-lowering therapies soon becoming available, there may be a potential application for pharmacogenomics to identify patients ideally suited to receive-or those who should avoid-specific medications.", 
    "222": "Familial hypercholesterolemia is an autosomal dominant inherited disease characterized by elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). It is mainly caused by mutations of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene. Currently, the methods of whole genome sequencing or whole exome sequencing for screening mutations in familial hypercholesterolemia are not applicable in China due to high cost. We performed targeted exome sequencing of 167 genes implicated in the homozygous phenotype of a proband pedigree to identify candidate mutations, validated them in the family of the proband, studied the functions of the mutant protein, and followed up serum lipid levels after treatment. We discovered that exon 9 c.1268 T>C and exon 8 c.1129 T>G compound heterozygous mutations in the LDLR gene in the proband derived from the mother and father, respectively, in which the mutation of c.1129 T>G has not been reported previously. The mutant LDL-R protein had 57% and 52% binding and internalization functions, respectively, compared with that of the wild type. After 6 months of therapy, the LDL-C level of the proband decreased by more than 50% and the LDL-C of the other family members with heterozygous mutation also reduced to normal. Targeted exome sequencing is an effective method for screening mutation genes in familial hypercholesterolemia. The exon 8 and 9 mutations of the LDLR gene were pedigree mutations. The functions of the mutant LDL-R protein were decreased significantly compared with that of the wild type. Simvastatin plus ezetimibe was proven safe and effective in this preschool-age child.",

Inverse probability of treatment propensity weighting was used to determine the 3-year risk of major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (MACE; myocardial infarction, stroke, or death) and major adverse limb events (MALE; major amputation, thrombolysis, or surgical bypass). Among 739 patients with PAD, 325 (44%) had claudication and 414 (56%) had CLI.

The I/R injury models were induced by the ligation of left anterior descending (LAD) artery for 30 minutes followed by recovering the blood stream. Three hours after reperfusion, the I/R injured areas of rat hearts were harvested, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis was assessed by in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL).
