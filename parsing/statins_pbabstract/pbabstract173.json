To determine whether the effects of statins could be affected by leukocytes, the experiment was carried out on cells not purified of leukocytes and cells purified using anti-CD-45 immunomagnetic beads. The effect of statins on proliferation was evaluated by determination of DNA synthesis using radiolabeled thymidine-incorporation assay and by quantification of viable cells using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenil)-2H-tetrazolium assay.", 
    "5": "Statins induced an inhibition of DNA synthesis in both the absence and the presence of 22-hydroxycholesterol; furthermore, 22-hydroxycholesterol alone also inhibited DNA synthesis. These effects of statins and 22-hydroxycholesterol were confirmed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenil)-2H-tetrazolium assay. Comparable inhibition of proliferation was observed in cells obtained from women with and without PCOS and in cell preparations treated and not treated with anti-CD-45 immunomagnetic beads.",

    "8": "Invasive procedures can result in adverse cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction (MI) and death. We hypothesized that statins might improve clinical outcomes when used before invasive procedures.", 
    "9": "We searched the MEDLINE, Cochrane, and clinicaltrials.gov databases from inception to February 2010 for randomized, controlled trials that examined statin therapy before invasive procedures. Invasive procedures were defined as percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and noncardiac surgery. We required that studies initiated statins before the procedure and reported clinical outcomes. A DerSimonian-Laird model was used to construct random-effects summary risk ratios.", 
    "10": "Eight percent of the screened trials (21 of 270) met our selection criteria, which included 4,805 patients. The use of pre-procedural statins significantly reduced post-procedural MI (risk ratio [RR]: 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.46 to 0.70, p < 0.0001). This benefit was seen after both percutaneous coronary intervention (p < 0.0001) and noncardiac surgical procedures (p = 0.004), but not CABG (p = 0.40). All-cause mortality was nonsignificantly reduced by statin therapy (RR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.37 to 1.17, p = 0.15).

    "16": "Many strategies have been shown to be cost-effective for prevention of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), most often by Markov modeling using assumptions based on randomized clinical trails and observational studies. Targeted screening for proteinuria in diabetics and in hypertensive patients is cost-effective for prevention of ESRD, but such screening is not cost-effective when applied to the general population. Screening for chronic kidney disease based on estimated glomerular filtration rate alone is not recommended. Perhaps, treatment of all newly diagnosed type 2 diabetics with an inhibitor of angiotensin-II without screening for proteinuria will also prevent or delay ESRD in a cost-effective manner. Intensive interventions and the use of angiotensin-II inhibition in incipient and overt nephropathy in type 1 and type 2 diabetes is also cost-effective in preventing ESRD. Rigorous control of blood pressure to desired targets also lowers the risks of ESRD in both diabetic and nondiabetic nephropathies, most likely in a cost-effective manner. Newer strategies involving statins and new combinations of agents are emerging but have not yet been tested for their cost-effectiveness in preventing ESRD cost-effectiveness.", 
    "17": "It has been reported that both nicardipine and lovastatin are substrates of both the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A subfamily and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and P-gp transport is unlikely to be a significant factor. Thus, the effects of oral lovastatin on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous and oral nicardipine were investigated in rats. Nicardipine was administered intravenously (4\u2009mg/kg) and orally (12\u2009mg/kg) with 0 (control), 0.3 and 1\u2009mg/kg of oral lovastatin to rats. Lovastatin was administered 30\u2009min before nicardipine administration. After intravenous administration of nicardipine with 0, 0.3 and 1\u2009 mg/kg of lovastatin, the total areas under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUCs) of nicardipine were not changed by lovastatin. However, after oral administration of nicardipine with 1\u2009mg/kg of oral lovastatin, the AUC of nicardipine was significantly greater (by 67.4%), and the extent of absolute oral bioavailability (F) of nicardipine was increased (by 38.5%). The above data suggest that lovastatin did not considerably inhibit the metabolism of nicardipine via the hepatic CYP3A subfamily, but inhibited intestinal P-gp and/or the CYP3A subfamily.", 
    "18": "Patients should be placed on the following medications: antiplatelet agents, (meta-analysis for aspirin, multiple randomized controlled trials [RCTs] for aspirin plus clopidogrel); a statin; atorvastatin has the best evidence (a single RCT); a beta-blocker (meta-analysis); renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers, whether or not the ejection fraction is diminished after myocardial infarction (MI) (SOR: A, meta-analysis for angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor; B, single RCT for ACE inhibitor plus aldosterone blocker).",

    "22": "74 participants (37 per randomized arm) received either pravastatin or fenofibrate for 12 weeks with 60 receiving combination treatment from weeks 12-48. There were no significant changes in hs-CRP, PAI-1, and P-selectin. From baseline to week 12, the median Apo B levels (-8 mg/dL, P=0.01 for fenofibrate and -27 mg/dL, P<0.01 for pravastatin) and ApoB/A1 ratios (-0.16, P<0.01 for both arms) significantly decreased. From baseline to week 48, median adiponectin (-1 ng/dL, P<0.01), Apo B (-22 mg/dL, P<0.01) and Apo B/A1 ratios (-0.2, P<0.01) all decreased in those who went on combination therapy, whereas Apo A1 (9.5 mg/dL, P=0.01) levels increased.", 
    "23": "Treatment with pravastatin or fenofibrate improves the atherogenic lipid profile within the first 12 weeks and is sustained through 48 weeks with combination therapy. Adiponectin levels decrease with lipid-lowering therapy. However, markers of inflammation and platelet activation were not appreciably changed suggesting that the biologic properties of these agents differ in persons with HIV infection.", 
    "24": "Atorvastatin is commonly used as a cholesterol lowering agent in patients. Recently, the neuroprotective effects of atorvastatin became the focus of many research studies. In this study, we have formulated chitosan microspheres containing atorvastatin calcium. In-vitro characterization of chitosan microspheres and quantification of atorvastatin calcium from formulations were also evaluated. The neuroprotective efficiency of atorvastatin calcium was investigated by an experimental spinal cord injury model. Atorvastatin calcium microspheres were implanted at the laminectomy area (1 mg/kg) immediately after trauma. Twenty-four hours after injury, motor functions of animals were scored according to modified Tarlov Scale. In spinal cord tissues tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6 and lipid peroxidation levels were quantified and ultrastructural changes have been investigated. The results of all parameters indicate that microspheres containing atorvastatin calcium were capable of improving functional outcome, attenuating the expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6; lowering lipid peroxidation levels and maintaining the preservation of the cellular uniformity.", 
    "25": "Angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), erythropoietin, and angiopoietin play important roles in the pathophysiology of diabetic retinopathy. Increased amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are also known to associated with diabetic retinopathy and VEGF expression. This study evaluated the effect of a simvastatin on ROS generation and the changes in various angiogenic factors in the retinas of diabetic rats.", 
    "26": "The rats were divided into normal, diabetes mellitus (DM), and simvastatin-treated groups (each group, n\u2009=\u200910). Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin into 20 Sprague-Dawley rats. After diabetic induction, simvastatin (5mg/kg) was administered orally to ten rats. The expression levels of VEGF, erythropoietin, angiopoietin 1 and 2, and NADPH oxidase were examined in rat retinas by RT-PCR and Western blot. Superoxide formation was examined by dihydroethidium (DHE) staining.", 
    "27": "DHE analysis revealed increased superoxide formation in the retinas of the diabetic group, which was decreased in the group treated with simvastatin. Western blot analysis showed that NADPH oxidase levels were decreased in the diabetic group and remained normal in the simvastatin-treated group. Simvastatin treatment blocked hyperglycemia-induced increases in VEGF, angiopoietin 2 and erythropoietin levels, as demonstrated by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis.", 
    "28": "Simvastatin treatment led to suppression of superoxide formation and decreased expression of VEGF, angiopoietin 2 and erythropoietin in diabetic rat retinas.", 
    "29": "The influence of the phenolic hydroxyl group of ortho-hydroxy atorvastatin metabolite (Ato-OH) on the photochemistry of atorvastatin (Ato) has been evaluated by steady and time-resolved experiments. Direct excitation of Ato and Ato-OH led to phenanthrene-like intermediate formation, being \u223c30% for Ato-OH less efficient than that for its parent compound in methanol. Both, Ato and Ato-OH are able to quench benzophenone (E(T)\u223c69 kcal mol(-1)) and xanthone (E(T)\u223c74 kcal mol(-1)) triplet excited state with rate constants close to diffusion limit control which suggest energy transfer mechanism is taking place. In fact, lower triplet energies \u223c63 kcal mol(-1) and \u03c0,\u03c0* character, were confirmed by DFT calculations for both compounds. Interestingly, only Ato-OH can act as a hydrogen donor towards triplet benzil excited state (E(T)\u223c 54 kcal mol(-1)) due to the presence of the phenolic hydroxyl group. Nevertheless, the presence of this group in Ato-OH does not modify to a significant degree the compound reactivity toward singlet oxygen. The importance of triplet energy transfer in biological systems to form Ato and Ato-OH triplet excited state as well as the hydrogen donor capacity of Ato-OH toward triplet excited state are discussed in the present communication.",

Although accumulating evidence indicates the influence of glucocorticoids on the pathology and treatment of coronary heart disease, there is still a dearth of pharmaceutical mechanisms for this relationship. This study aimed to investigate the influence of drug treatment on glucocorticoid receptor levels in coronary heart disease.", 
    "31": "Eighty hospitalized patients (average age (59.0 +/- 7.5) years, 46 male and 34 female) with coronary heart disease were categorized into four groups with 20 members in each according to one of the four drugs they were treated with. The four drugs were: nitrated derivative isosorbide dinitrate, the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker metoprolol, the calcium antagonist nifedipine, and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin. Glucocorticoid receptor protein levels of peripheral blood lymphocytes were tested using immunoblotting analysis before and after one month of treatment.", 
    "32": "Immunoblotting analysis showed increased glucocorticoid receptor levels after treatment with metoprolol and nifedipine. There were no statistically significant changes of glucocorticoid receptor levels after treatment with isosorbide dinitrate or lovastatin, although there were trends of up-regulation of glucocorticoid receptor expression after both treatments.", 
    "33": "Both the beta-blocker and the calcium blocker can increase glucocorticoid receptor levels after chronic administration. This effect suggests a mechanism for their anti-inflammatory and other therapeutic roles for coronary heart disease and comorbid disorders.", 
    "34": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of dementia in the elderly. The two hallmark lesions in AD brain are deposition of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Hypercholesteremia is one of the risk factors of AD. But its role in the pathogenesis of AD is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between hypercholesteremia and tau phosphorylation or beta-amyloid (Abeta), and evaluate the effect of atorvastatin on the level of tau phosphorylation and Abeta in the brains of rats fed with high cholesterol diet.", 
    "35": "Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into normal diet control group, high cholesterol diet group, and high cholesterol diet plus atorvastatin (Lipitor, 15 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) treated group. Blood from caudal vein was collected to measure total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) at the end of the 3rd and the 6th months by an enzymatic method. The animals were sacrificed 6 months later and brains were removed. All left brain hemispheres were fixed for immunohistochemistry. Hippocampus and cerebral cortex were separated from right hemispheres and homogenized separately. Tau phosphorylation and Abeta in the brain tissue were determined by Western blotting (using antibodies PHF-1 and Tau-1) and anti-Abeta40/anti-Abeta42, respectively.", 
    "36": "We found that high cholesterol diet led to hypercholesteremia of rats as well as hyperphosphorylation of tau and increased Abeta level in the brains. Treatment of the high cholesterol diet fed rats with atorvastatin prevented the changes of both tau phosphorylation and Abeta level induced by high cholesterol diet.", 
    "37": "Hypercholesteremia could induce tau hyperphosphorylation and Abeta production in rat brain. Atorvastatin could inhibit tau hyperphosphorylation and decrease Abeta generation. It may play a protective role in the patho-process of hypercholesteremia-induced neurodegeneration in the brain.", 
    "38": "Oxidative stress and inflammation are important steps in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. We postulated that therapeutic concentrations of aspirin and pravastatin, especially in combination, may suppress oxidative stress and inflammation in endothelial cells, and this concept was examined in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs).", 
    "39": "Human coronary artery endothelial cells were cultured and treated with oxidized-low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL, 60 microg/ml for 24 hours) alone, or pre-treated with aspirin (1, 2 or 5 mmol/L), pravastatin (1, 5 or 10 micromol/L) or their combination (1 mmol/L aspirin and 5 micromol/L pravastatin), followed by ox-LDL treatment. After respective treatment, superoxide anion production, p38 mitogen activated protein kinase and transcription factor NF-kappaB activation, protein expression of lectin-like ox-LDL receptor-1 (LOX-1) and adhesion molecules, and monocyte adhesion were measured.", 
    "40": "Ox-LDL treatment greatly elicited its receptor LOX-1 expression, superoxide anion production and inflammatory response, which were minimally affected by low concentration of aspirin (1 mmol/L) or pravastatin (5 micromol/L), but were markedly decreased by their combination. Activation of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase and NF-kappaB, the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1, which were only mildly affected by aspirin or pravastatin alone, were significantly attenuated by their combination. As a consequence, monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells was markedly attenuated by the combination of the two agents. Well-known anti-oxidants alpha-tocopherol and gamma-tocopherol had similar inhibitory effects on ox-LDL-mediated oxidative stress and LOX-1 expression as well as monocyte adhesion as did the combination of aspirin and pravastatin.", 
    "41": "These studies point to a positive interaction between aspirin and pravastatin with regard to endothelial biology. Anti-oxidant and subsequent anti-inflammatory effect may be one of the potential underling mechanisms.", 
    "42": "A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed for the separation of lovastatin (LT) and its derivatives. The conversion of LT and its derivatives in alkaline or acidic solution in different storage times was also investigated by HPLC. The results showed that LT was present in different forms: as a lactone, as lovastatin acid (LA), and as its methyl ester (LM) under acidic condition. Well-resolved peaks of three forms compounds of lovastatin were separated on a Symmetry C(18) column (4.6 x 250 mm i.d., particle size 5 mum) using acetonitrile-water (77:23, v/v) as the mobile phase at pH 3.0. The retention time of LA, LT, LM was 6.41 +/- 0.25 min, 8.89 +/- 0.25 min, 9.73 +/- 0.25 min, respectively. LT only converted to LA when LT was treated with 0.1 M NaOH. Under the acidic condition, with the increase of storage time, LT converted to LA, following LA would be transformed to LT and LM. Apparently, containing high concentrations of methanol in acidic methanol solutions might facilitate the conversion of LA to LM, and conversion of LT, LA, and LM would almost reach equilibrium after 60 h. The concentration of methanol and the storage time would also change the form of the LT when LA, LT, and LM were extracted by methanol-water in acidic condition. So the determination and separation of LA and LT should possibly exclude methanol in acidic condition.", 
    "43": "We present the available data on the effects of combined therapy of fenofibrate with drugs affecting lipid metabolism other than statins.", 
    "44": "We consider studies evaluating the effects of combined therapy of fenofibrate with bile acid sequestrants (BAS), ezetimibe, niacin, n-3 fatty acids, plant sterols, orlistat, rimonabant, metformin and glitazones.", 
    "45": "Combination of BAS (especially colesevelam) with fenofibrate had additional effects on metabolic parameters in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia. Combination of ezetimibe with fenofibrate may be a useful approach to improve the overall lipid profile of patients with mixed hyperlipidemia. There is a further reduction in triglyceride levels when n-3 fatty acids are administered with fenofibrate in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Combined fenofibrate and orlistat treatment further improves metabolic parameters in overweight/obese patients with metabolic syndrome. The fenofibrate/thiazolidinedione combination is an alternative for diabetic patients intolerant to statins, though differences exist between pioglitazone and rosiglitazone.", 
    "46": "For patients who cannot tolerate statins there are useful combinations of fenofibrate with other drugs affecting lipid metabolism. These combinations improve several metabolic parameters, but more trials should be carried out to reach more robust conclusions about their effects on cardiovascular events.", 
    "47": "Atorvastatin lactone, a metabolite of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) atorvastatin acid, is believed to be myotoxic. Our objectives were to develop a population pharmacokinetic model for atorvastatin acid and its lactone metabolite and to identify patient characteristics that are predictive of variability in the pharmacokinetic parameters of the parent drug and its lactone metabolite.", 
    "48": "Twenty-six subjects, 13 of whom had experienced atorvastatin-induced myopathy, received atorvastatin 10 mg once daily for 7 days. Plasma samples taken on day 7 at 0 hours (predose) and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 22 and 24 hours post-dose were analysed for both atorvastatin acid and atorvastatin lactone, using a validated liquid chromatography assay with tandem mass spectrometry, and the data were modelled using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling software (NONMEM). The influence of the patients' demographic characteristics, biochemical indices and pharmacogenomics was evaluated. Final model validation was carried out using a visual predictive check.", 
    "49": "The pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin acid and atorvastatin lactone were best described by two- and one-compartment models, respectively. The main pharmacokinetic parameters of atorvastatin acid (mean [relative standard error {RSE}]) for a subject with mean covariate values were the first-order absorption rate constant (3.5 h-1 fixed); oral clearance (504 L/h [29%]); apparent volume of the central compartment (3250 L [16.5%]); and apparent volume of the peripheral compartment (2170 L [9.3%]). The main pharmacokinetic parameters of atorvastatin lactone (mean [RSE]) were the apparent clearance to atorvastatin acid (24 L/h [154%]); apparent total body clearance (116 L/h [9.5%]); and apparent volume of distribution (137 L [33.7%]). The value of aspartate transaminase was identified as a significant covariate for the apparent volume of the central compartment for atorvastatin acid and for the apparent total body clearance of atorvastatin lactone, signifying the importance of liver function in atorvastatin pharmacokinetics. The visual predictive plots demonstrated that the model adequately described the pharmacokinetics of both species.", 
    "50": "A population pharmacokinetics model was developed and validated to describe atorvastatin acid and its lactone metabolite concentration-time data. This model may be useful for atorvastatin dose individualization or analysis of sparse data.", 
    "51": "Statins have recently come under evaluation for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The aim of this study was to examine the effects of atorvastatin on the clinical manifestations and expression of p38, p27 and Jab1 using a rat PAH model. Ninety-six male Wistar rats were divided into control (receiving no surgical treatment), vehicle and treatment groups, among which the last two groups underwent left pneumonectomy and were then treated with monocrotaline (MCT, 60 mg/kg). Both control and vehicle groups subsequently received saline, and the treatment group received atorvastatin (20 mg/kg) by stomach catheter. Rats were sacrificed, and mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) and right ventricle hypertrophy index (RVHI) were measured. The expression of p38, p27, and Jab1 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. At 28 days, mPAP and RVHI and expression levels of Jab1 and p38 in the vehicle group were significantly higher than those in the treatment and control groups. However, the expression of p27 was lowest in the vehicle group among the three groups. Atorvastatin reduced PAP and RVHI in the rat PAH model, decreased expression of p38 and Jab1 but increased expression of p27.", 
    "52": "Hepatitis C is a leading cause of liver failure and transplantation in the United States and a major public health issue. Studies have shown that patients with hepatitis C are at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, which make statins of particular benefit in this patient population. However, the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) lists active or chronic liver disease as an absolute contraindication to statin therapy. The available literature regarding the safety of statins in this patient population is limited, but has not shown clinically significant differences in aminotransferase elevations or evidence of hepatotoxicity in patients with hepatitis C who have received statins versus those who have not. Statins should continue to be avoided in advanced end-stage liver disease, as there is a lack of safety data in these patients and drug metabolism would be severely compromised. Treatment with statins can be used in those with chronic, stable hepatitis C with elevated cardiac risk or a previous cardiac event.", 
    "53": "A 66-year-old man with diabetes and hypertension using statin was admitted to the hospital with progressive myalgia. He had been on rosuvastatin for five months. After beginning the use of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, he presented with severe muscle pain and maintained penile erection. Several days after interruption of therapy, muscle pain and penile erection disappeared. This case demonstrates the interaction of sildenafil with rosuvastatin might result in myopathy.", 
    "54": "It has been shown that many women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) insufficient. Both statin treatment and vitamin D supplementation have been shown to improve biochemical hyperandrogenemia, insulin resistance, and markers of inflammation in patients with PCOS, raising the possibility that some of the statin effects are mediated through vitamin D.", 
    "55": "We conducted this randomized, double-blind placebo controlled study to assess the effect of atorvastatin on serum 25OHD concentrations in patients with PCOS. Forty medication-naive patients with PCOS were randomized to either atorvastatin 20 mg daily or placebo for 3 months. After completing the initial 3 months of atorvastatin or placebo, both groups of patients participated in a 3-month extension study with metformin 1500 mg daily. We measured changes in 25OHD concentrations by use of tandem mass spectrometry.", 
    "56": "Mean (SD) baseline 25OHD concentrations were comparable between the 2 groups [45.9 (2.4) vs 44.8 (1.8) nmol/L; P = 0.7]. There was a significant increase in 25OHD concentrations with atorvastatin [45.9 (2.4) vs 60.8 (3.5) nmol/L] compared with placebo [44.8 (1.8) vs 41.8 (3.2) nmol/L; P = 0.02]. Three-month treatment with metformin maintained the improvement of 25OHD with atorvastatin compared to baseline [45.9 (2.4) vs 61.8 (3.5), P \u2264 0.01). There were no significant changes in 25OHD concentrations in the placebo group after 12 weeks of metformin.", 
    "57": "Among patients with polycystic ovary syndrome, 12 weeks of atorvastatin led to a clinically significant rise in 25OHD concentrations. This may represent a beneficial pleiotropic effect of statins on 25OHD concentrations.", 
    "58": "Statin use has been reported to reduce risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) whereas atherosclerotic disease has been reported to increase risk, but findings have been inconsistent. We aimed to establish the association of statin use and coronary atherosclerosis with CRC.", 
    "59": "We performed a population-based case control study of patients with a first diagnosis of CRC cancer between January 1, 1991, and December 31, 2008 (n = 9979), using the Danish National Registry of Patients. As many as 10 population controls were matched to each patient using risk set sampling (n = 99,790). Statin use before cancer diagnosis (or control index date) was determined via county prescription databases and evidence of coronary atherosclerosis using International Classification of Diseases codes. We calculated incidence rate ratios using conditional logistic regression, adjusted for multiple covariates.", 
    "60": "Among patients with CRC, statin use was modest (7.7%), but 23.5% of use was long term (\u22655 years). Ever use of statins (\u22652 prescriptions) slightly reduced CRC risk, compared with relative to never/rare use (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.87, 95% confidence interval = 0.80-0.96). However, long-term use did not affect risk compared with never/rare use (IRR = 0.95, 95% 0.80-1.12). No associations were observed between atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, or stroke, and CRC incidence.", 
    "61": "Although there is a weak inverse association between ever use of statins and CRC incidence, there was no trend with increasing duration of use, so statins do not appear to reduce CRC risk. We did not confirm the reported association between atherosclerosis and CRC risk.", 
    "62": "The accumulation of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) peptides in the brain of human and rodents has been associated with the activation of glial cells, neuroinflammatory and oxidative responses, and cognitive deficits. These oxidative changes leave glutamate transporters more vulnerable and may result in reduction of their functions, resulting in excitotoxic damage. Herein, we evaluated the effects of atorvastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, in molecular and behavioral alterations induced by a single intracerebroventricular injection of aggregated A\u03b2(1-40) (400 pmol) in mice. An increased glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP) expression and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) levels, as well as increased lipid peroxidation and impairment in the glutathione antioxidant system and cell degeneration was found in the hippocampus of A\u03b2(1-40)-treated mice. A\u03b2(1-40) also induced a marked decrease in glutamatergic transporters (GLAST and GLT-1) expression and in l-[\u00b3H] glutamate uptake in mice hippocampus, in addition to spatial learning and memory deficits. Atorvastatin (10 mg/kg/day v.o.) was administered after A\u03b2(1-40) injection and through seven consecutive days. Atorvastatin treatment was neuroprotective against cell degeneration induced by A\u03b2(1-40), reducing inflammatory and oxidative responses and increasing the expression of glutamatergic transporters. On the other hand, atorvastatin did not reverse the cognitive impairments and failed to alter the hippocampal glutamate uptake in A\u03b2(1-40)-treated mice. These results reinforce and extend the notion of the potential neuroprotective action of atorvastatin against the neuronal toxicity induced by A\u03b2(1-40). In addition, the present findings suggest that the spatial learning and memory deficits induced by A\u03b2 peptides in rodents may not be entirely related to neuronal damage.", 
    "63": "A number of clinical trials have confirmed that statin treatment and, more generally, LDL-lowering treatment, are able to reduce CHD and CVD events in a wide range of clinical conditions associated with increased cardiovascular risk. However, the most recent trials have also identified patient groups in which lipid-lowering treatment shows a more limited preventive potential due to the \"non-reversibility\" of part of the cardiovascular risk, which dilutes the observed treatment effect by events that are not directly a consequence of atherosclerosis. The use of lipid-lowering therapy in these patients should be driven not only by their absolute risk, as suggested by the most recent American and European guidelines, but also by their overall clinical setting and by the evidence of benefit obtained in controlled trials in comparable populations.", 
    "64": "Current clinical guidelines recommend the use of a global risk assessment tool, such as those pioneered by the Framingham Heart Study, to determine eligibility for statin therapy in patients with absolute risk levels greater than a certain threshold. In support of this approach, several randomized trials have reported that patients with high absolute risk clearly benefit from statin therapy. Therefore, the guideline recommendations would seem intuitive and effective, albeit on the core assumption that the mortality and morbidity benefits associated with statin therapy would be greatest in those with high predicted absolute risk. However, if this assumption is incorrect, using predicted absolute risk to guide statin therapy could easily result in underuse in some groups and overuse in others. Herein, the authors question the utility of global risk assessment strategies based on the Framingham risk score for guiding statin therapy in light of current data that have become available from more recent and robust prospective randomized clinical trials since the publication of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. Moreover, the Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines do not support treatment of some patients who may benefit from statin therapy. In conclusion, the authors propose an alternative approach for incorporating more recent randomized trial data into future statin allocation algorithms and treatment guidelines.", 
    "65": "Patients with mixed hyperlipidemia and at high risk of coronary heart disease may not achieve recommended low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol goals on statin monotherapy. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a fenofibrate 160 mg/pravastatin 40 mg fixed-dose combination therapy in high-risk patients not at their LDL cholesterol goal on pravastatin 40 mg. In this 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study, after a run-in on pravastatin 40 mg, 248 patients were randomly assigned to fenofibrate/pravastatin combination therapy or to pravastatin monotherapy. Combination therapy produced significantly greater complementary decreases in non-HDL cholesterol (primary end point) than pravastatin monotherapy (-14.1% vs -6.1%, p = 0.002). Significantly greater improvements were also observed in LDL cholesterol (-11.7% vs -5.9%, p = 0.019), HDL cholesterol (+6.5% vs +2.3%, p = 0.009), triglycerides (-22.6% vs -2.0%, p = 0.006), and apolipoprotein B (-12.6% vs -3.8%, p <0.0001). Significantly more patients receiving the fenofibrate/pravastatin combination therapy than pravastatin alone achieved the LDL cholesterol (<100 mg/dl) and non-HDL cholesterol (<130 mg/dl) goals (p <0.01). Combination therapy was generally well tolerated with incidences of clinical and laboratory adverse experiences similar between the 2 groups. In conclusion, the fenofibrate 160 mg/pravastatin 40 mg fixed-dose combination therapy significantly improved the global atherogenic lipid profile in high-risk patients with mixed hyperlipidemia not controlled by pravastatin 40 mg monotherapy.",

Although the mean value of high density lipoprotein-cholesterol did not change in the 3 months after coronary revascularization, that of (LDL-C) significantly decreased. A significant positive correlation was identified between % decrease in LDL-C and number of days to CVE recurrence. The average LDL-C value (102.8+/-21.7 mg/dL) in the group of patients with no recurrence within 5 years was significantly lower than that (135.3+/-46.1 mg/dL) in the recurrence group (P = 0.0088).

Although MK is required for biosynthesis of all isoprenoids, in MKD, in particular, the timely synthesis of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate appears to be compromised. Because small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) depend on geranylgeranylation for their proper signaling function, we studied the effect of MK deficiency on geranylgeranylation and activation of the two small GTPases, RhoA and Rac1. We demonstrate that both geranylgeranylation and activation of the two GTPases are more easily disturbed in MKD cells than in control cells when the flux though the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway is suppressed by low concentrations of simvastatin. The limited capacity of geranylgeranylation in MKD cells readily leads to markedly increased levels of nonisoprenylated and activated GTPases, which will affect proper signaling by these GTPases.", 
    "72": "Two spectrophotometric methods are presented for the simultaneous determination of ezetimibe/simvastatin and ezetimibe/atorvastatin binary mixtures in combined pharmaceutical dosage forms without prior separation. The first is the derivative ratio method where the amplitudes of the first derivative of the ratio spectra ((1) DD) at 299.5 and 242.5 nm were found to be linear with ezetimibe and simvastatin concentrations in the ranges 0.5-20 \u00b5gml(-1) and 1-40 \u00b5gml(-1) , respectively, whereas the amplitudes of the first derivative of the ratio spectra ((1) DD) at 289.5 and 288 nm were selected to determine ezetimibe and atorvastatin in the concentration ranges 5-50 \u00b5gml(-1) and 1-40 \u00b5gml(-1) , respectively. The second is the H-point standard additions method; absorbances at the two pairs of wavelengths, 228 and 242 nm or 238 and 248 nm, were monitored while adding standard solutions of ezetimibe or simvastatin, respectively. For the analysis of ezetimibe/atorvastatin mixture, absorbance values at 226 and 248 nm or 212 and 272 nm were monitored while adding standard solutions of ezetimibe or atorvastatin, respectively. Moreover, differential spectrophotometry was applied for the determination of ezetimibe in the two mixtures without any interference from the co-existing drug. This was performed by measurement of the difference absorptivities (\u0394A) of ezetimibe in 0.07 M 30% methanolic NaOH relative to that of an equimolar solution in 0.07 M 30% methanolic HCl at 246 nm.

The adiponectin gene is located in chromosome 3q27, a susceptibility locus for T2DM and metabolic disorders (Saito K, Tobe T, Minoshima S, Asakawa S, Sumiya J, Yoda M, Nakano Y, Shimizu N, Tomita M: Organization of the gene for gelatin-binding protein (GBP28). Gene 1999, 229:67-73). Increased circulating levels of adiponectin are associated with improvement in the metabolic syndrome and reductions are strongly predictive of diabetes risk (Li S, Shin HJ, Ding EL, van Dam RM: Adiponectin levels and risk of type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis. JAMA 2009, 302:179-188. Extensive efforts have been made to understand how adiponectin levels can be elevated. The complex post-translational processing and secretion of adiponectin provides a rich area where pharmacologic manipulation may be developed to increase adiponectin levels in humans. Circulating adiponectin levels are increased by many commonly used drugs, such as statins, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones (TZDs) providing an important opportunity to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying their effects. This review describes the cellular processes by which adiponectin is synthesized and secreted, current therapeutics known to affect this pathway and the potential for therapeutic manipulation in human subjects.",

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 10 mg of atorvastatin/day (64) or placebo (68) and were followed with trial visits 3-monthly for a mean of 2.5 yrs.

Lovastatin solid dispersions were prepared using sodium deoxycholate (NaDC) and sodium glycholate (NaGC) at ratios of 1:19, 1:49, and 1:69. The formulated solid dispersions and control (commercial tablet) were administered to rats and plasma concentrations were determined by a validated LC-MS/MS method. Statistically significant differences were found in C(max), AUC\u2080\u208b\u2081\u2080, and AUC\u2080\u208b\u221e values among lovastatin formulations (p\u2009<\u20090.05). NaDC-containing formulations revealed higher bioavailabilities than NaGC-containing solid dispersions at ratios of 1:19 and 1:49. Especially, NaDC-containing formulation at a ratio of 1:19 (NaDC19) showed the highest bioavailability. The AUC (both AUC\u2080\u208b\u2081\u2080 and AUC\u2080\u208b\u221e) of NaDC19 was statistically higher than control and NaDC69 (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The AUC values decreased as bile salt concentrations increased. Overall, formulations containing bile salts showed higher AUC values than control, even though all formulations did not show significantly higher AUC. In conclusion, the addition of bile salts to lovastatin could enhance drug bioavailabilities. However, too high concentrations of bile salts could decrease bioavailabilities of lovastatin.", 
    "92": "A diabetic patient may suffer simultaneously from cardiovascular disease; thus, lipid-lowering or anti-hypertensive agents could be given together with nateglinide. The pharmacokinetics of nateglinide were investigated in the presence and absence of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (fluvastatin, lovastatin) and calcium channel blockers (verapamil, nifedipine) in rabbits. A pharmacokinetic modeling approach was used to quantify the effects of the drugs that significantly influenced the pharmacokinetics of nateglinide. Fluvastatin and nifedipine shifted the time course of serum nateglinide concentrations upwards; there was no significant change with verapamil or lovastatin. The C(max) and AUC(inf) increased 1.5- (p<0.05) and 1.3-fold in the presence of fluvastatin and 1.8- (p<0.01) and 2.4-fold (p<0.01) in the presence of nifedipine, respectively. In a simultaneous nonlinear regression, fluvastatin and nifedipine decreased the elimination rate constant, by 76% and 32%, respectively. Fluvastatin and nifedipine increased the systemic exposure of nateglinide in rabbits, probably due to their inhibitory action on the metabolism of nateglinide by CYP2C5 (human CYP2C9). The concomitant use of fluvastatin and/or nifedipine with nateglinide is quite likely; therefore, the clinical consequences of long-term treatments must be considered.",

Blood vessel formation is essential for organ development during embryogenesis and is associated with several physiological and pathological processes, such as wound healing and tumor development. The VE-statin/egfl7 gene is specifically expressed in endothelial cells during embryonic development and in the adult. We studied here the regulatory mechanisms that control this tissue-specific expression. RT-qPCR analyses showed that the specificity of expression of VE-statin/egfl7 in endothelial cells is not shared with its closest neighbor genes notch1 and agpat2 on the mouse chromosome 2. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation analysis of histone modifications at the VE-statin/egfl7 locus showed that the chromatin is specifically opened in endothelial cells, but not in fibroblasts at the transcription start sites. A 13 kb genomic fragment of promoter was cloned and analyzed by gene reporter assays which showed that two conserved regions are important for the specific expression of VE-statin/egfl7 in endothelial cells; a -8409/-7563 enhancer and the -252/+38 region encompassing the exon-1b transcription start site. The latter contains essential GATA and ETS-binding sites, as assessed by linker-scanning analysis and site-directed mutagenesis. An analysis of expression of the ETS and GATA transcription factors showed that Erg, Fli-1 and GATA-2 are the most highly expressed factors in endothelial cells. Erg and GATA-2 directly control the expression of the endogenous VE-statin/egfl7 while Fli-1 probably exerts an indirect control, as assessed by RNA interference and chromatin immunoprecipitation. This first detailed analysis of the mechanisms that govern the expression of the VE-statin/egfl7 gene in endothelial cells pinpoints the specific importance of ETS and GATA factors in the specific regulation of genes in this cell lineage.",

PST also significantly reduced protein concentrations and numbers of inflammatory and epithelial cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Significantly lower numbers of donor CD11b and CD4, but not CD8 cells, were observed in skin and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid after PST treatment.

Little is known about the relationship between tendinopathy and HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) or the effects of atorvastatin use on tendon healing following surgical repair of tendon rupture. We hypothesized that atorvastatin negatively affects this healing process. The Achilles tendons of 16 New Zealand rabbits were ruptured surgically and repaired with sutures. Eight of the rabbits were given oral atorvastatin. The other 8 served as a surgical control group. Six weeks postoperatively, all the rabbits were sacrificed, and the repaired tendons were removed. After standard histological preparation, fibroblastic activity, re-vascularization, collagenization, collagen construction, and inflammatory-cell infiltration were evaluated. On comparing the atorvastatin and surgical control groups, we observed no difference in fibroblastic activity. Although it did not reach statistical significance in our study, a difference was noted in revascularization, collagenization, and inflammatory cell infiltration; and a statistical difference was observed in collagen construction.

Simvastatin also suppressed in vivo PAF-biosynthesis via the de novo pathway, in leukocytes of 6 simvastatin-treated volunteers. Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were also significantly decreased, whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triacylglycerol, EC(50), and lag time were unaffected in these participants. Simvastatin with an intact lactone ring also inhibited PAF-activities, while incubation of human mesangial cells with it also resulted in decreased de novo PAF-biosynthesis. This suggests that these simvastatin-dependent effects are independent of its lactone ring. These new actions of statins should be further studied in PAF-implicated pathological conditions such as CVD, cancer, and renal disease.",

For both groups of substances a cytotoxic effect against several human tumors is presumed. Direct comparison of several statins and TDZ has not been performed on meningioma cells until now. We compared the antiproliferative/cytotoxic effect of five statins, two TDZ, and their combinations on various human meningioma cell lines and nontumorous cells using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, cell cycle analysis, and caspase-3 assay. Simvastatin (SMV) and its combination with the TDZ pioglitazone (PGZ) turned out to be the most effective treatment. After 96\u00a0h the 50% inhibition concentration (IC(50)) of SMV in MTT assays for two more sensitive meningioma cell lines (one benign and one malignant) was below 0.9\u00a0\u03bcM, while the IC(50) was 2.8\u00a0\u03bcM or higher for two other meningioma lines. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis suggested that MTT results mostly represented cytotoxic rather than antiproliferative effects. Strong caspase-3 induction suggested participation of intrinsic apoptosis in meningioma cell death. In contrast, SMV showed no substantial effects on fibroblasts and astrocytes. Addition of 40\u00a0\u03bcM PGZ significantly decreased the fraction of clonogenic cells in soft-agar assays, as compared with 2.8\u00a0\u03bcM SMV alone. Taken together, SMV showed a significant cytotoxic effect against human meningioma cells, which was moderately enhanced by PGZ.",

This study compared cardiovascular (CV) risk and direct and indirect costs among higher- and lower-risk employees initiating atorvastatin vs. simvastatin. Using a large employer claims database (1999-2006), employees were stratified as 1) high-risk employees with prior CV events, diabetes, or renal disorders; and 2) low- to intermediate-risk employees without these conditions. Propensity score matching was used, and 2-year outcomes were compared between matched cohorts. Indirect costs included disability payments and medically related absenteeism. Drug costs were imputed with recent prices to account for availability of generic simvastatin. Among 4167 matched pairs of high-risk employees, atorvastatin use was associated with a numerically lower risk of CV events (17.6 versus 18.4%, P = 0.37), higher direct medical costs ($17,590 versus $17,377, P = 0.002), numerically lower indirect costs ($4830 versus $4989, P = 0.29), and higher total costs by $54 ($22,420 versus $22,366, P = 0.034). The majority of high-risk employees (62%) received low initial statin doses (atorvastatin = 10 mg or simvastatin = 20 mg). Among 9326 matched pairs of low- to intermediate-risk employees, atorvastatin use was associated with a lower risk of CV events (3.1% versus 3.7%, P = 0.030), lower direct medical costs ($8400 versus $8436, P < 0.001), numerically lower indirect costs ($2781 versus $2807; P = 0.12), and lower total costs by $61 ($11,181 versus $11,243, P < 0.001).

In addition, we observed that the average number of risk factors a given patient had was 5, with some risk factors like obesity having clustering of additional risk factors, suggesting the need to assess the full list of risk factors to be able to provide comprehensive risk factor assessment and modification. We now have developed a 1-page patient encounter sheet to facilitate rapid assessment of these 12 cardiometabolic risk factors in a busy clinical office setting. It is hoped that with the simple risk assessment tool provided, clinicians would be able to comprehensively screen for and treat these traditional and nontraditional risk markers.

A retrospective cross-sectional audit of HMR reports pertaining to 608 community-dwelling older people (>or=65 years) was conducted. EBTs considered for this audit included four guideline-recommended therapies for CVD: antithrombotic therapy (warfarin +/- antiplatelet therapy), beta-blockers, statins, and angiotensin agents (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEI] +/- angiotensin II receptor blockers [ARBs]). The prevalence of EBT use among the older people, mean age (SD) 75.6 (7.5) years, was: 73% for antithrombotic therapy, 75% for statins, 74% for angiotensin therapy, and 35% for beta-blockers. CVD risk factors warranting treatment with these EBTs were frequently associated with use of EBTs. EBTs were least likely to be used in those with coronary interventions like coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)/stent insertion (all EBTs except angiotensin agents) and angiotensin agents in those with a history of myocardial infarction or chronic heart failure. A pharmacist-led HMR service was significantly associated with the prescribing of all 4 EBTs. The results from this study show good adherence to evidence-based guidelines in general, although there is still room for improvement to further optimize clinical outcomes in these complex patients.

Photochemical fate in natural waters can be described in most cases by the sum of the loss due to hydrolysis, direct photolysis, and, reaction with hydroxyl radical (\u2022OH), singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)) (or O(2) ((1)D)), and excited state dissolved organic matter (DOM). The absolute bimolecular reaction rate constant with OH was measured, using pulsed radiolysis, (1.19 \u00b1 0.04) \u00d7 10(10) M(-1) s(-1). The reaction rate constant of (1)O(2) was determined to be (3.1 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10(8) M(-1) s(-1). Under the experimental conditions used, at high atorvastatin concentration (35.8 \u03bcM) the contribution of singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)) to the photodegradation of atorvastatin in natural waters was higher than that of hydroxyl radical, and accounted for up to 23% of the loss in aqueous solutions. Whereas, at a concentration of 35.8 nM, (1)O(2) (and \u2022OH) both played a minor role in the removal of this compound. Lastly, it also appears that atorvastatin reacts with (3)DOM* contributing to its loss in simulated natural waters.",

    "166": "Excipients in the pharmaceutical formulation of oral drugs are notably employed to improve drug stability. However, they can affect drug absorption and bioavailability. Passive transport through intestinal cell walls is the main absorption mechanism of drugs and, thus, involves an interaction with the membrane lipids. Therefore in this work, the effect of the excipient NaHCO(3) on the interaction of the anticholesterolemic drug fluvastatin sodium (FS) with membrane phospholipids was investigated by (1)H NMR and FTIR spectroscopy. Sodium bicarbonate is often combined with fluvastatin for oral delivery to prevent its degradation. We have used model DMPC/DMPS membranes to mimic the phospholipid content of gut cell membranes. The results presented in this work show a 100% affinity of FS for the membrane phospholipids that is not modified by the presence of the excipient. However, NaHCO(3) is shown to change the interaction mechanism of the drug. According to our data, FS enters the DMPC/DMPS bilayer interface by interacting with the lipids' polar headgroups and burying its aromatic moieties into the apolar core. Moreover, lipid segregation takes place between the anionic and zwitterionic lipids in the membranes due to a preferential interaction of FS with phosphatidylserines. The excipient counteracts this favored interaction without affecting the drug affinity and location in the bilayer. This work illustrates that preferential interactions with lipids can be involved in passive drug permeation mechanisms and gives evidence of a possible nonpassive role of certain excipients in the interaction of drugs with membrane lipids.",

Recently, new evidence suggesting that the statins in red yeast enhance bone formation has been reported, but more research is still needed in order to support these claims of osteogenic effects. Therefore, in this study, we hypothesized that red yeast rice (in which red yeast is fermented) can improve osteogenic function through osteoblast cell proliferation and differentiation. We studied the effect of methanol extract of red yeast rice powder (RYRP) on osteoblast proliferation and differentiation by measuring mitochondrial enzyme activity and bone marker alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, respectively. Osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured in various concentrations of RYRP methanol extract (0.001-1 mg/mL) during the osteoblast differentiation period (1, 5, 10, and 15 days). As measured by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-y]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, RYRP extracts stimulated cell proliferation during a 24-hour period, compared to cooked white rice powder extract. The most pronounced effect was observed at the concentration range between 0.075 and 0.1 mg/mL. This RYRP stimulatory effect for cell proliferation was observed during the whole osteogenic period. Cellular (synthesized) ALP activity was increased at a RYRP extract concentration of 0.075 mg/mL during 15 days of culture, but the medium (secreted) ALP activity did not show any significant change. This cellular ALP activity stimulation by RYRP extract was confirmed by the staining of ALP activity on cell matrix layers for matrix calcification. The results imply that RYRP extract may increase osteogenic effect by stimulating cell proliferation and ALP activity in osteoblastic cells.",

Simvastatin, steady flow, and non-reversing pulsatile flow each separately upregulated KLF2, eNOS, and TM mRNA. At lower simvastatin concentrations (0.1 and 1\u00a0\u03bcM), the combination of statin and unidirectional steady or pulsatile flow produced an overall additive increase in mRNA levels. At higher simvastatin concentration (10\u00a0\u03bcM), a synergistic increase in eNOS and TM mRNA expression was observed. In contrast, oscillating flow impaired KLF2 and TM, but not eNOS expression by simvastatin at 1\u00a0\u03bcM. A higher simvastatin concentration of 10\u00a0\u03bcM overcame the inhibitory effect of oscillating flow. Our findings suggest that oscillating shear stress renders the endothelial cells less responsive to simvastatin than cells exposed to unidirectional steady or pulsatile flow. Consequently, the pleiotropic effects of statins in vivo may be less effective in endothelial cells exposed to atheroprone hemodynamics.",
