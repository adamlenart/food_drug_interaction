However, there are limited options for patients who are either intolerant to statin therapy, develop CVD despite being on maximally tolerated statin therapy, or have severe hypercholesterolemia. Recently the Food and Drug Administration approved two novel medications for low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol reduction: Evolocumab and Alirocumab. These agents target and inactivate proprotein convertase subtilsin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a hepatic protease that attaches and internalizes LDL receptors into lysosomes hence promoting their destruction. By preventing LDL receptor destruction, LDL-C levels can be lowered 50%-60% above that achieved by statin therapy alone.

    "44": "As part of its single technology appraisal (STA) process, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the manufacturer of evolocumab (Amgen) to submit evidence on the clinical and cost effectiveness of evolocumab. The appraisal assessed evolocumab as monotherapy or in combination with a statin with or without ezetimibe, or in combination with ezetimibe (without statin therapy), in adult patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia (which includes mixed dyslipidaemia), for whom statins do not provide optimal control of their low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and/or for whom statins are contraindicated or not tolerated. The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a critical review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology based on the company's submission to NICE. The evidence was derived mainly from four randomised controlled trials comparing evolocumab with either ezetimibe or placebo in adults with primary familial or non-familial hypercholesterolaemia, who were either able to take statins or who were statin intolerant. The clinical-effectiveness review found that evolocumab is efficacious at lowering LDL-C but that there was uncertainty regarding its impact on cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. In response to the ERG's critique of the submitted health economic model, the company submitted an amended model, which also included a patient access scheme (PAS). Based on this, the deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for evolocumab against ezetimibe were above \u00a374,000 and \u00a345,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained within the non-familial primary and secondary prevention populations, respectively, whilst the ICER within the heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HeFH) population was approximately \u00a323,000 per QALY gained.

A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk and protective factors for severe sepsis. A significantly lower incidence of organ dysfunction was found in the statin group, as compared with the non-statin group (13.3% vs 31.1%, respectively; p=0.002), corresponding to adjusted rates ratio of 0.32 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.13-0.75; p=0.009).

Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption might contribute to the clinically observed reduction in cardiovascular events by evaluating its effect on inflammatory plaque development in apolipoprotein E(-/-) mice. Methods: Apolipoprotein E(-/-) mice were fed the Paigen diet (1.25% cholesterol, 0.5% cholic acid, and 15% fat) without or with ezetimibe (7 mg/kg/d) for 6 wk. In a first set of mice (n = 15), we intravenously injected (3)H-cholesteryl oleate-labeled human LDL to test whether ezetimibe promotes LDL-derived cholesterol fecal excretion. In a second set (n = 20), we used the imaging agent (99m)Tc-cAbVCAM1-5 to evaluate expression of an inflammatory marker, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), in atherosclerotic plaques. In a third set (n = 21), we compared VCAM-1 expression with (99m)Tc-cAbVCAM1-5 uptake in various tissues. Results: Mice treated with ezetimibe showed a 173% higher LDL-cholesteryl ester plasma disappearance rate (P < 0.001 vs. control) after (3)H-cholesteryl oleate-labeled LDL injection. At 96 h after injection, the hepatic fraction of (3)H-tracer was 61% lower in mice treated with ezetimibe (P < 0.001). Meanwhile, LDL-derived (3)H-cholesterol excretion in the feces was 107% higher (P < 0.001). The antiatherogenic effect of ezetimibe monitored by (99m)Tc-cAbVCAM1-5 SPECT showed a 49% reduction in aortic tracer uptake (percentage injected dose per cubic centimeter, 0.95 \u00b1 0.04 vs. 1.87 \u00b1 0.11; P < 0.01). In addition to hypercholesterolemia, the proinflammatory Paigen diet significantly increased VCAM-1 expression with respect to the control group in various tissues, including the aorta, and this expression correlated strongly with (99m)Tc-cAbVCAM1-5 uptake (r = 0.75; P < 0.05). Conclusion: Inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption with ezetimibe promotes antiatherosclerotic effects through increased LDL cholesterol catabolism and LDL-derived cholesterol fecal excretion and reduces inflamed atherosclerotic plaques. These mechanisms may contribute to the benefits of adding ezetimibe to a statin therapy.",

Because of the lack of effective medication, transplantation remains the only and final curative option for end-stage liver disease. Since the demand for organ transplants by far exceeds the supply, other treatment options are urgently required to prevent progression and improve end-stage liver disease. Statins are primarily cholesterol-lowering drugs used for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. In addition to the primary effect, statins act beneficially through different pleiotropic mechanisms on inflammation, fibrosis, endothelial function, thrombosis, and coagulation to improve chronic liver diseases. However, concerns remain about the efficacy and safety of statin treatment because of their potential hepatotoxic risks, and as of now, these risks impede broader use of statins in the treatment of chronic liver diseases. The aim of this review is to comprehensively describe the mechanisms by which statins improve prospects for different chronic liver diseases with special focus on the pathophysiological rationale and the clinical experience of statin use in the treatment of liver diseases.",

Area covered: Herein, the authors discuss the background to inhibition of PCSK9 and the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and clinical trials with alirocumab. Alirocumab produces substantial reductions in low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients with and without background statin treatment. The safety profile appears very promising from the relatively short term studies that have been completed but there are some remaining concerns about long term risks of neurocognitive events and developing diabetes. Expert opinion: The profound reduction in LDL-C with alirocumab is most likely to translate into cardiovascular benefits in the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial and is unlikely in itself to result in any major adverse effects. The high cost and the current lack of long-term safety and efficacy data will restrict the use of alirocumab to patients who have high cardiovascular risk from established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and who are unable to achieve LDL-C targets with maximally tolerated dose of statins with or without other lipid-lowering drugs.

However, recent meta-analyses of previous studies done with statins have shown that these drugs could induce new onset diabetes mellitus (NODM), especially in subjects prone to diabetes: obese, females, older age, Asian descent, and those with pre-diabetes or the metabolic syndrome. Several meta-analyses of randomized, controlled trials with statins and population-based studies of subjects taking statins have shown different incidence of NODM ranging from 28% in the JUPITER study to 43% in the UK clinical practice cohort. The exact cause of statin-induced NODM is not clearly known and several pathophysiologic mechanisms have been proposed, which include modification of the lipoprotein particle size, inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, decreased expression of GLUT 4, and decreased adiponectin and ubiquinone levels, including others, which all lead to either increase in insulin resistance or decrease in insulin secretion. Based on the current evidence, the use of statins should not be withheld from subjects at high cardiovascular risk, even if they are prone to NODM, because their benefits outweigh their risks. However, in persons prone to the development of NODM, vigilance is required and periodic measurements of plasma glucose or HbA1c should be performed. If NODM develops, statin treatment should not be stopped, but a switch to administration of a more favorable statin, administration of statin on alternate days, or reduction of the dose should be considered, or antidiabetic therapy added.",

Thus, the aim of this study was to identify the biological pathways affected by individual statins in an in vitro model of human pancreatic cancer. The study was performed on a human pancreatic cancer cell line MiaPaCa-2, exposed to all commercially available statins (12\u2009\u03bcM, 24\u2009h exposure). DNA microarray analysis was used to determine changes in the gene expression of treated cells. Intracellular concentrations of individual statins were measured by UPLC (ultra performance liquid chromatography)-HRMS (high resolution mass spectrometer). Large differences in the gene transcription profiles of pancreatic cancer cells exposed to various statins were observed; cerivastatin, pitavastatin, and simvastatin being the most efficient modulators of expression of genes involved namely in the mevalonate pathway, cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, apoptosis and cytoskeleton signaling. Marked differences in the intracellular concentrations of individual statins in pancreatic cancer cells were found (>11 times lower concentration of rosuvastatin compared to lovastatin), which may contribute to inter-individual variability in their anti-cancer effects. In conclusion, individual statins exert different gene expression modulating effects in treated pancreatic cancer cells. These effects may be partially caused by large differences in their bioavailability. We report large differences in gene transcription profiles of pancreatic cancer cells exposed to various statins. These data correlate to some extent with the intracellular concentrations of statins, and may explain the inter-individual variability in the anti-cancer effects of statins.",

The new ACC/AHA 2013 guidelines support intensifying statin therapy when the CAC is \u226575th percentile for age, sex, and ethnicity/race or when the calcium score is \u2265300 Agatston units. This allows for aggressive management of those at the highest risk, matching intensity of therapy with intensity of risk. Most importantly, the asymptomatic person rarely needs to undergo evaluation for obstructive disease, even when CAC scores are high, as revascularization with percutaneous coronary interventions does not improve outcomes in asymptomatic persons with preserved left ventricular function.

In this longitudinal study, 192 consecutive outpatients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease dementia were stratified according to APOE haplotypes, and followed for one year to investigate associations of lipid profile variations and lipophilic statin therapy with changes in cognition, caregiver burden, basic and instrumental functionality. Overall, 102 patients (53.1%) carried APOE4+ haplotypes and 90 (46.9%) carried APOE4- haplotypes; 189 patients (98.4%) used either a cholinesterase inhibitor, or Memantine, or both; 144 patients had dyslipidemias and 143 of them received statin therapy. Total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, Mini-Mental State Examination scores, and functional independence scores were significantly lower at the end of the follow-up, while Clinical Dementia Rating sum-of-boxes scores were higher. Exclusively for APOE4- carriers, rising LDL-cholesterol levels were associated with a trend toward improvements in the Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living (\u03b2=0.010; \u03c1=0.16), whereas rising HDL-cholesterol levels were associated with lowered scores (\u03b2=-0.051; \u03c1=0.04). Lipophilic statin therapy had non-significant protective effects over Clinical Dementia Rating sum-of-boxes score variations only for APOE4- carriers. APOE4- haplotypes might enhance lipid availability to protect neuronal membranes, thus overcoming their supposed dysfunction in cholesterol metabolism, while APOE4+ carriers have inefficient neural repair mechanisms.

    "113": "A retrospective analysis was performed on patient records derived from 279 SM patients whose muscle biopsies were referred to our clinical diagnostic laboratory for analysis. Clinical, histopathologic and biochemical features were compared with two myopathic control groups unexposed to statins: individuals with idiopathic mitochondrial myopathy (MMP; n\u200a=\u200a94) and with unknown metabolic myopathy (UMP; n\u200a=\u200a86); normal controls were unavailable for this record review study.", 
    "114": "More SM patients had significantly elevated plasma CK than in the other two groups (p\u200a<\u200a0.01). A subset of SM patients (67 of 279; 24%) had histopathologic and/or electron microscopic (EM) evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle; more cases were identified by EM than by histochemical analysis. Of 279 cases, 29 (10%) were confirmed to have respiratory chain defects by biochemical analysis; 4 of these had mitochondrial abnormalities by EM. An additional 20 cases had mitochondrial abnormalities by EM without a biochemical diagnosis.", 
    "115": "Both primary and secondary mitochondrial dysfunction was found in subsets of SM patients. The fact that respiratory chain defects were not found in most cases with histopathologic mitochondrial abnormalities does not rule out primary mitochondrial disease in these cases, however, it is more likely that secondary effects on mitochondrial structure and function have occurred; molecular analysis may be helpful only in a small number of cases.", 
    "116": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the results of prosthetic carotid bypass (PCB) with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in treatment of restenosis after CEA or carotid artery stenting (CAS).",

The study was approved by an Institutional Review Board. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. During the same period, a total of 4321 CEAs were completed in the three centers. In these 66 patients, the primary treatment of the initial carotid artery stenosis was CEA in 57 patients (86%) and CAS in nine patients (14%). The median delay between primary and redo revascularization was 32\u00a0months. Carotid restenosis was symptomatic in 38 patients (58%) with transient ischemic attack (n\u00a0= 20) or stroke (n\u00a0= 18). In this series, all patients received statins; 28 patients (42%) received dual antiplatelet therapy, and 38 patients (58%) received single antiplatelet therapy. All PCBs were performed under general anesthesia. No shunt was used in this series. Nasal intubation to improve distal control of the internal carotid artery was performed in 33 patients (50%), including those with intrastent restenosis. A PTFE graft of 6 or 7\u00a0mm in diameter was used in 6 and 60 patients, respectively. Distal anastomosis was end to end in 22 patients and end to side with a clip distal to the atherosclerotic lesions in 44 patients. Completion angiography was performed in all cases. The patients were discharged under statin and antiplatelet treatment. After discharge, all of the patients underwent clinical and Doppler ultrasound follow-up every 6\u00a0months. Median length of follow-up was 5\u00a0years.", 
    "118": "No patient died, sustained a stroke, or presented with a cervical hematoma during the postoperative period. One transient facial nerve palsy and two transient recurrent nerve palsies occurred. Two late strokes in relation to two PCB occlusions occurred at 2\u00a0years and 4\u00a0years; no other graft stenosis or infection was observed. At 5\u00a0years, overall actuarial survival was 81%\u00a0\u00b1 7%, and the actuarial stroke-free rate was 93%\u00a0\u00b1 2%. There were no fatal strokes.",

Among females, odds ratios (OR) were OR=1.99 for iHF tertile 3 vs. 1 (95% confidence interval [CI]=1.28, 3.08) for Intermountain validation (P-trend across tertiles=0.002) and OR=1.29 (CI=1.01, 1.66) for Baylor patients (P-trend=0.049). Among males, iHF had OR=1.95 (CI=1.33, 2.85) for tertile 3 vs. 1 in Intermountain (P-trend <0.001) and OR=2.03 (CI=1.52, 2.71) in Baylor (P-trend < 0.001).

This review aims to provide an update on the impact of statin treatment on markers of haemostasis and platelet function and on thrombosis-related outcomes.", 
    "125": "Different coagulation factors are modulated by statins, leading to inhibition of coagulation and increased fibrinolysis. Also, an impact of statins on platelet function has been documented. From a clinical perspective, several observational studies have revealed a reduced incidence of venous thromboembolism in patients receiving statins, which has been argued in some available studies and meta-analyses. Furthermore, a beneficial effect of early statin initiation following acute coronary syndrome for short-term prevention of thrombosis-related events has been documented, but the available data are still not consistent.", 
    "126": "Although statins influence the levels of a multitude of haemostatic factors in an antithrombotic direction, data supporting their use for venous thromboembolism prevention are not consistent, and the impact of statins on early vascular events following acute coronary syndrome is still debated. Whether the robust long-term beneficial effects of statins in reducing cardiovascular risk may be also explained by persistent changes in haemostatic factors needs further exploration.", 
    "127": "Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) is a surgical procedure in which a vessel, normally the left internal mammary artery and/or a segment of an excised vein (typically from the leg), is grafted to the coronary arteries to bypass a blockage. CABG has been shown to be superior to percutaneous coronary intervention for patients with complex three vessel disease and left main coronary artery disease. All patients undergoing CABG should receive aspirin preoperatively; they also should receive a beta blocker preoperatively to reduce the likelihood of postsurgical atrial fibrillation. All patients should receive aspirin within 6 hours postsurgery to prevent graft thrombosis and should continue taking aspirin indefinitely, be started or continued on a high-intensity statin, be enrolled in a cardiac rehabilitation program, and be screened and treated if necessary for depression.", 
    "128": "Delayed recovery from anesthesia remains a\u00a0very challenging subject for anesthesiologists. This case report describes the clinical course of delayed recovery from neuromuscular blockade after laparoscopic partial nephrectomy in a\u00a0patient on simvastatin. The patient was hypertensive on regular treatment with oral captopril 25\u2009mg twice daily and amlodipine 5\u2009mg once daily and hypercholesterolemic on regular simvastatin 40\u2009mg once daily with a normal electrocardiogram (ECG). All preoperative laboratory findings were within normal ranges. The patient was premedicated with midazolam 1\u2009mg and general anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 2\u2009\u00b5g/kg body weight, propofol 2\u2009mg/kg and rocuronium bromide 0.6\u2009mg/kg to facilitate tracheal intubation. Anesthesia was maintained with inhalation of isoflurane 1.0-1.5\u2009% in 40\u2009% oxygen-enriched air and 25\u2009\u00b5g boluses of fentanyl. The patient did not require any additional rocuronium throughout surgery which was finished after 4\u2009h. The patient most probably had preoperative simvastatin-induced myotoxicity. This potentiated the muscle relaxant effect of rocuronium bromide and was the reason for patient unresponsiveness and delayed postoperative recovery. We can conclude that anesthesiologists should preoperatively identify statin myotoxicity and to avoid neuromuscular blocking drugs for statin-treated patients. Also, preoperative adjustment of statin dosage may be recommended.", 
    "129": "Treatment with lipid-lowering drugs, statins, is common all over the world. Lately, the occurrence of spontaneous tendon ruptures or tendinosis have suggested a negative influence of statins upon tendon tissue. But how statins might influence tendons is not clear. In the present study, we investigated the effect of statin treatment on mechanical strength, cell proliferation, collagen content and gene expression pattern in a tendon-like tissue made from human tenocytes in vitro. Human tendon fibroblasts were grown in a 3D tissue culture model (tendon constructs), and treated with either simvastatin or atorvastatin, low or high dose, respectively, for up to seven days. After seven days of treatment, mechanical testing of the constructs was performed. Collagen content and cell proliferation were also determined. mRNA levels of several target genes were measured after one or seven days. The maximum force and stiffness were reduced by both statins after 7 days (p<0.05), while the cross sectional area was unaffected. Further, the collagen content was reduced by atorvastatin (p = 0.01) and the cell proliferation rate was decreased by both types of statins (p<0.05). Statin treatment also introduced increased mRNA levels of MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-13, TIMP-1 and decreased levels of collagen type 1 and 3. In conclusion, statin treatment appears to have a negative effect on tendon matrix quality as seen by a reduced strength of the tendon constructs. Further, activated catabolic changes in the gene expression pattern and a reduced collagen content indicated a disturbed balance in matrix production of tendon due to statin administration.",

The association was analyzed in two large population cohorts (TwinsUK and KORA) using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC-UPLC) in the TwinsUK cohort and reverse phase liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) in the KORA cohort. Afterwards we investigated the same association for only one statin (rosuvastatin) in a subset of individuals from the randomized double-blind placebo-controlled JUPITER study using LC-ESI-MS for IgG glycome and HILIC-UPLC for total plasma N-glycome.",

The association between statin use and FA2B was replicated in the KORA cohort. In the JUPITER trial we found no statistically significant differences between the randomly allocated placebo and rosuvastatin groups.",

    "135": "Residual cardiovascular (CV) risk remains in some patients despite optimized statin therapy and may necessitate add-on therapy to reduce this risk. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, lowers plasma triglyceride levels without raising low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and has potential beneficial effects on atherosclerotic plaques. Animal studies have shown that EPA reduces levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In clinical trials utilizing a wide spectrum of plaque imaging modalities, EPA has shown beneficial effects on plaque characteristics. Studies of patients with coronary artery disease receiving statin therapy suggest that EPA may decrease plaque vulnerability and prevent plaque progression. EPA also decreased pentraxin-3 and macrophage accumulation. A large, randomized, Japanese study reported that EPA plus a statin resulted in a 19% relative reduction in major coronary events at 5years versus a statin alone in patients with hypercholesterolemia (P=0.011). Icosapent ethyl, a high-purity prescription form of EPA ethyl ester, has been shown to reduce triglyceride levels and markers of atherosclerotic inflammation. Results of an ongoing CV outcomes study will further define the potential clinical benefits of icosapent ethyl in reducing CV risk in high-risk patients receiving statin therapy.",

Of all 4574 patients eligible to statin, 1060 ambulatory patients with HF and concomitant COPD were enrolled and randomly assigned to rosuvastatin 10\u00a0mg daily (538 patients) or placebo (522 patients). The primary end-point was to compare all cause death rate in patients randomized to rosuvastatin or placebo. Further, we assessed the effects of rosuvastatin (10\u00a0mg daily) on cardiovascular (CV) death, non-CV death and hospital admissions.

    "140": "Women all over the world are exposed to an unavoidable contamination by organochlorine pesticides and other chemical pollutants. Many of them are considered as xenoestrogens and have been associated with the development and progression of breast cancer. We have demonstrated that the most prevalent pesticide mixtures found in healthy women and in women diagnosed with breast cancer modulates the gene expression in human epithelial mammary cells. Statins are well-known cholesterol-depleting agents acting as inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis. Since the early 1990s, it has been known that statins could be successfully used in cancer therapy, including breast cancer, but the exact mechanism behind anti-tumor activity of the statins remains unclear. In the present study we evaluated the effect of simvastatin in the gene expression pattern induced by realistic organochlorine mixtures found in breast cancer patients. The gene expression of 94 genes related with the cell signaling pathways were assessed. Our results indicate that simvastatin exerts a global down regulating effect on successfully determined genes (78.7%), thus attenuating the effects induced by organochlorine mixtures on the gene profile of human mammary epithelial cells. This effect was more evident on genes whose function is the ATP-binding process (that also were particularly up-regulated by pesticide mixtures). We also found that MERTK (a proto-oncogene which is overexpressed in several malignancies) and PDGFRB (a member of the platelet-derived growth factor family whose expression is high in breast-cancer cells that have become resistant to endocrine therapy) were among the genes with a higher differential regulation by simvastatin. Since resistance to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors is closely related to MERKT, our findings would enhance the possible utility of statins in breast cancer treatment, i.e. improving therapeutic results combining statins with tyrosine Kinase inhibitors.",

To date, the controversy continues regarding the best and appropriate medical therapy for hypercholesterolemia; likewise, there is the recommendation of a healthy dietary content regarding the amount of sugar as well as the type of fats, either saturated or polyunsaturated. Together, control of circulating cholesterol, amelioration of hypertension, regulation of diabetes, and dietary recommendations might prevent atherosclerosis.",

We excluded those individuals meeting one of the following criteria: Use of statin therapy at baseline visit, discontinuation of statin treatment at most recent visit, change in statin treatment during follow-up and poor compliance to treatment. Statin escape phenomenon was defined as an increase in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels at the most recent visit by > 10% compared with the value at 6 mo following initiation of statin treatment.",

Both escapers and non-escapers had similar baseline LDL-C levels [174 (152-189) and 177 (152-205) mg/dL, respectively]. In comparison with non-escapers, statin escapers demonstrated lower LDL-C levels at 6 mo after treatment initiation [88 (78-97) mg/dL vs 109 (91-129) mg/dL, P < 0.05], but higher levels at the most recent visit [103 (96-118) mg/dL vs 94 (79-114) mg/dL, P < 0.05].",

    "146": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by neuronal and synaptic loss. One process that could contribute to this loss is the intracellular caspase cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) resulting in release of the toxic C-terminal 31-amino acid peptide APP-C31 along with the production of APP\u0394C31, full-length APP minus the C-terminal 31 amino acids. We previously found that a mutation in APP that prevents this caspase cleavage ameliorated synaptic loss and cognitive impairment in a murine AD model. Thus, inhibition of this cleavage is a reasonable target for new therapeutic development. In order to identify small molecules that inhibit the generation of APP-C31, we first used an APP\u0394C31 cleavage site-specific antibody to develop an AlphaLISA to screen several chemical compound libraries for the level of N-terminal fragment production. This antibody was also used to develop an ELISA for validation studies. In both high throughput screening (HTS) and validation testing, the ability of compounds to inhibit simvastatin- (HTS) or cerivastatin- (validation studies) induced caspase cleavage at the APP-D720 cleavage site was determined in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with wildtype (wt) human APP (CHO-7W). Several compounds, as well as control pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh, inhibited APP\u0394C31 production (measured fragment) and rescued cell death in a dose-dependent manner. The effective compounds fell into several classes including SERCA inhibitors, inhibitors of Wnt signaling, and calcium channel antagonists. Further studies are underway to evaluate the efficacy of lead compounds - identified here using cells and tissues expressing wt human APP - in mouse models of AD expressing mutated human APP, as well as to identify additional compounds and determine the mechanisms by which they exert their effects.",

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions between these two drugs in healthy males and to explore the effect of SLCO1B1 and CYP2C9 polymorphisms on their interactions in two randomized, open-label crossover studies. Glimepiride was studied in part 1 and rosuvastatin in part 2. Twenty-four participants were randomly assigned to each part. All subjects (n=24) completed part 1, and 22 subjects completed part 2. A total of 38 subjects among the participants of the PK interaction studies were enrolled in the genotype study to analyze their SLCO1B1 and CYP2C9 polymorphisms retrospectively (n=22 in part 1, n=16 in part 2). Comparison of the PK and safety of each drug alone with those of the drugs in combination showed that both glimepiride and rosuvastatin did not interact with each other and had tolerable safety profiles in all subjects. However, with regard to glimepiride PK, the SLCO1B1 521TC group had a significantly higher maximum plasma concentration (Cmax,ss) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve during the dose interval at steady state (AUC\u03c4,ss) for glimepiride in combination with rosuvastatin than those for glimepiride alone. However, other significant effects of the SLCO1B1 or CYP2C9 polymorphism on the interaction between the two drugs were not observed. In conclusion, there were no significant PK interactions between the two drugs; however, the exposure to glimepiride could be affected by rosuvastatin in the presence of the SLCO1B1 polymorphism.", 
    "152": "Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is an iatrogenic acute renal failure occurring following the intravascular injection of iodinated radiographic contrast medium. However, the regulatory mechanisms for CIN remain to be fully elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate whether atorvastatin protects against CIN via anti\u2011apoptotic effects by the upregulation of Hsp27 in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro. To determine whether atorvastatin attenuated CIN, the inflammatory response and apoptosis in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro, a rat model of iopamidol\u2011induced CIN was used, and human embryonic proximal tubule (HK2) cell damage was assessed. The rats were assigned into four\u00a0groups (n=10 per group), as follows: Control rats; rats+atorvastatin; rats\u00a0+\u00a0iopamidol; rats+iopamidol+atorvastatin. In\u00a0vitro, the HK2 cells were treated with iopamidol in the presence or absence of atorvastatin, heat shock protein (Hsp)27 small interfering (si)RNA or pcDNA3.1\u2011Hsp27. The renal tissues were examined histopathologically and collected for western blot analysis. The results showed that atorvastatin ameliorated the apoptosis and deterioration of renal function (P<0.05). Furthermore, atorvastatin reduced the iopamidol\u2011induced activity of B cell lymphoma\u20112 (Bcl\u20112)\u2011associated X protein (Bax)/caspase\u20113 and increased the expression of Bcl\u20112 in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro. Notably, following treatment with Hsp27 siRNA or pcDNA3.1\u2011Hsp27, it was found that iopamidol enhanced or weakened the upregulation of Bax/caspase\u20113 and downregulation of Bcl\u20112 in the HK2 cells, respectively. The results of the present study suggested that atorvastatin protected against contrast\u2011induced renal tubular cell apoptosis through the upregulation of Hsp27 in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro.", 
    "153": "Studies have reported that atorvastatin (ATO) may increase the radiosensitivity of malignant cells. However, the influence of ATO on reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels before and after irradiation has not been fully illustrated. In the present study, radiosensitivity was evaluated by a clonogenic assay and a cell survival curve and cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. ROS were detected by a laser scanning confocal microscope and flow cytometry with a DCFH-DA probe. NADPH\u00a0oxidases\u00a0(NOXs) and superoxide dismutase (SOD)\u00a0proteins were detected by immunoblotting, and total SOD activity was measured using an SOD\u00a0kit. We also conducted transient transfection of NOX2 and NOX4\u00a0genes to increase intracellular ROS generation and applied SOD\u00a0mimetic tempol to enhance ROS elimination ability. Our results demonstrated that, with ATO-alone treatment, the survival fractions of irradiated PC-3 cells were significantly decreased. Meanwhile, the apoptosis rate of the irradiated cells increased significantly (P<0.05). The ROS levels of the study group decreased obviously before irradiation (P<0.01), however, the radiation-induced ROS of the study group was at a high level even when irradiation had been terminated for 2\u00a0h (P<0.01). Moreover, NOX2 and NOX4\u00a0levels and total SOD activity decreased (P<0.01), while the levels of SOD1 were stably maintained (P>0.05). On the other hand, the decreased survival fractions and high radiation-induced ROS\u00a0levels were abrogated by increasing the level of NOXs by gene transfection or by enhancing the ability of SOD utilizing the addition of tempol. In conclusion, ATO enhanced the cell killing effect of irradiation by reducing endogenous ROS levels and prolonging the lifespan of radiation\u2011induced ROS via a decrease in the level of NOXs and SOD activity.", 
    "154": "There are limited contemporary data on guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) utilization and long-term clinical outcomes in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) with and without concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD). From 2006 to 2013, 879 patients with claudication or critical limb ischemia (CLI) underwent diagnostic angiography or therapeutic endovascular intervention at our multidisciplinary vascular center. GDMT use was assessed at the time of angiography, and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) and all-cause mortality were determined during 5\u00a0years of follow-up. Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to adjust for baseline differences between patients with and without concomitant CAD. Despite a higher adherence to GDMT (all p \u22640.002) for the use of aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, and statins, patients with PAD and concomitant CAD had higher unadjusted 5-year rates of MACCE (hazard ratio [HR] 1.7, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.1, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001) and all-cause mortality (HR 1.86, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.4, p\u00a0= 0.0001). After adjustment for baseline co-morbidities, the presence of CAD remained an independent risk factor for mortality (adjusted HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.80, p\u00a0= 0.04) but not for MACCE (adjusted HR 1.24, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.60, p\u00a0= 0.10) in patients with PAD. A sensitivity analysis limited to patients with CLI demonstrated that concomitant CAD was associated with significantly higher adjusted rates of both MACCE (adjusted HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.03, p\u00a0= 0.01) and mortality (adjusted HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.20, p\u00a0= 0.006). In conclusion, despite higher rates of GDMT use, PAD patients with concomitant CAD had significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality during a 5-year postprocedural follow-up. The subgroup of CLI patients with concomitant CAD was at particularly high risk for both MACCE and all-cause mortality.",

We aimed to determine whether atorvastatin (ATV) might affect orthodontic relapse and osteoclastogenesis by modulating expression of RANKL and osteoprotegerin (OPG), crucial molecules involved in bone turnover. Furthermore, we analyzed the adverse effects of ATV on femur turnover and endochondral ossification.",

Data for patients who were prescribed a statin for the first time (between the period from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2015), including personal data, laboratory data, diagnoses, and medications, were extracted.", 
    "161": "We extracted initial clinical data of statin from a CDW that was established to support clinical studies; the data was refined through a data quality management process. Data for 21,368 patients who were prescribed statins for the first time were extracted. We extracted data every 3 months for a period of 1 year. A total of 17 different statins were extracted. It was found that statins were first prescribed by the endocrinology department in most cases (69%, 14,865/21,368).",

In the SHR-L-ST group, animals were treated with daily 2 mg/kg ST administration. In L groups, a ligature remained around mandibular first molars for 10 d. Each group was divided for killing at 10 or 21 d postoperatively. Microtomographic and histometric analyses were performed. Osteoclastogenesis was evaluated by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase assay and gene expression of 84 proinflammatory mediators by polymerase chain reaction array.",

The pigment intensity, antioxidant activities and the main isoflavones of it were evaluated and compared with traditional red yeast rice and Radix Puerariae. The fermented mixture showed higher contents of isoflavones and pigment intensities than red yeast rice and Radix Puerariae. The DPPH, OH, FRAP and total antioxidant activity results of fermented mixture also showed higher antioxidant potential than those of Radix Puerariae and red yeast rice, owing to the higher pigment intensity and total phenolic contents. It is concluded that the fermented mixture of Radix Puerariae and rice could be widely used as a source of polyphenols with high antioxidative potential, thus introducing numerous health benefits for the consumer.",

Pharmacological research studies have not focused on tissue repair after the establishment of emphysema but have instead focused on inflammatory stimulation. The aim of our study was to analyze the effects of atorvastatin and simvastatin on mouse lung repair after emphysema caused by CS. Male mice (C57BL/6, n\u2009=\u200945) were divided into the following groups: control (sham-exposed), CSr (mice exposed to 12 cigarettes a day for 60\u00a0days and then treated for another 60\u00a0days with the vehicle), CSr+A (CSr mice treated with atorvastatin for 60\u00a0days), and CSr+S (CSr mice treated with simvastatin for 60\u00a0days). The treatment with atorvastatin and simvastatin was administered via inhalation (15\u00a0min with 1\u00a0mg/mL once a day). Mice were sacrificed 24\u00a0h after the completion of the 120-day experimental procedure. We performed biochemical, morphological, and physiological analyses. We observed decreased levels of leukocytes and cytokines in statin-treated mice, accompanied by a reduction in oxidative stress markers. We also observed a morphological improvement confirmed by a mean linear intercept counting in statin-treated mice. Finally, statins also ameliorated lung function. We conclude that inhaled atorvastatin and simvastatin improved lung repair after cigarette smoke-induced emphysema in mice.",

Multiple clinical entities such as the newborn, hypobetalipoproteinemia, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) missense mutations, and an unexpected excess response to a statin or other medications, are associated with very low LDL-C levels in otherwise healthy individuals. Therefore, an issue of major interest to clinicians who buy into \"lower is better\" for LDL-C in the high-risk CV patient is how low can and should the LDL-C be taken? Available information is discussed and placed into context. A definite safe lowest LDL-C level cannot be specified but there appears to be support that a level as low as 20 mg/dL (0.52 mmol/l) can be justified in the highest CV risk patients with extensive atherosclerosis where plaque stabilization and regression are necessary.",

A total of 45 male Sprague-Dawley rats (8 weeks old) were divided into three groups (n = 15 each): an age-matched normal control group (Control group), an uncontrolled DM group (DM group), and a statin-treated group (Statin group). The rats in the DM and Statin group received an injection of STZ (60 mg/kg). Beginning 10 weeks after the establishment of DM, the Statin group received daily treatment with atorvastatin (10 mg/kg) via oral gavage for four weeks. After 14 weeks, the results of the experiment were evaluated. The ratios of intracavernosal pressure (ICP) to mean arterial pressure (MAP) were recorded with cavernosometry (20 Hz, 3 V, 0.2 msec for 30 seconds) before and after the intravenous administration of udenafil (1 mg/kg). Expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) was evaluated using cavernosal tissue. In addition, changes in RhoA translocation ratio and myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1) phosphorylation were evaluated with western blot. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were also analyzed as measurements of oxidative stress levels. The ICP/MAP and area under the curve (AUC)/MAP ratios of the Statin group were obviously superior to the DM group, but were not comparable to the Control group (P<0.001). The level of oxidative stress, namely SOD activity, was also significantly lower in the Statin group than in the DM group (P = 0.015), and was comparable to the Control group. In contrast, MDA levels were not considerably different among the groups (P = 0.217). The RhoA translocation ratio was not significantly different among the groups (P = 0.668), whereas MYPT1 phosphorylation in the Statin group was significantly lower than in the DM group (P = 0.030), and similar to the Control group. Expression of \u03b1-SMA in the Statin group was higher than in the DM group (P<0.001), and comparable to the Control group. Chronic statin treatment alone showed anti-oxidative effects and helped to restore the erectile mechanism, but did not lead to the full recovery of erectile function in STZ-induced DM rats.

CI-AKI was induced by dehydration for 72 hours, followed by furosemide intramuscular injection 20 minutes before low-osmolar contrast media (CM) intravenous injection. Statins were administered by oral gavage once daily for 3 consecutive days before CM injection and once 4 hours after CM injection. Rats were sacrificed 24 hours after CM injection, and renal function, kidney histopathology, nitric oxide (NO) metabolites, and markers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis were evaluated. The results showed that atorvastatin and rosuvastatin but not simvastatin ameliorated CM-induced serum creatinine elevation and histopathological alterations. Atorvastatin and rosuvastatin showed similar effectiveness against CM-induced oxidative stress, but simvastatin was less effective. Atorvastatin was most effective against NO system dysfunction and cell apoptosis, whereas rosuvastatin was most effective against inflammation.

However, GA could cause only 30% reduction in HMGR activity when measured in Leishmania promastigotes treated with 34\u00a0\u03bcM of GA. Interestingly western blot analysis revealed fivefold reduced HMGR expression in GLA treated promastigotes. To further study the mode of action of GA, we used transgenic parasites overexpressing LdHMGR. Results indicated that \u223c2 fold resistance was exhibited by LdHMGR overexpressing promastigotes to GA with an IC50 value of 74\u00a0\u03bcM compared to the wild type parasite. This explained the specific binding of GA to LdHMGR enzyme. There was \u223c2 fold depletion in ergosterol levels in wild type promastigotes compared to the HMGR overexpressors. This data was further validated by exogenous supplementation of GA treated cells with ergosterol and 40% reversal of growth inhibition was observed. The results obtained suggested that GA kills the parasite by affecting sterol biosynthetic pathway, especially by inhibiting the L.\u00a0donovani HMGR and altering ergosterol levels. The finding from the current study shows that GA is a potential antileishmanial chemotherapeutic agent.",

    "230": "In Taiwan, the prevalence of hyperlipidemia increased due to lifestyle and dietary habit changes. Low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) are all significant predicting factors of coronary artery disease in Taiwan. We recognized that lipid control is especially important in patients with existed atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD), including coronary artery disease (CAD), ischemic stroke and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Because the risk of ASCVD is high in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD) and familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), lipid control is also necessary in these patients. Lifestyle modification is the first step to control lipid. Weight reduction, regular physical exercise and limitation of alcohol intake all reduce triglyceride (TG) levels. Lipid-lowering drugs include HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), cholesterol absorption inhibitors (ezetimibe), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, nicotinic acids (niacin), fibric acids derivatives (fibrates), and long-chain omega-3 fatty acids. Statin is usually the first line therapy. Combination therapy with statin and other lipid-lowering agents may be considered in some clinical settings. For patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and stable CAD, LDL-C < 70 mg/dL is the major target. A lower target of LDL-C <55 mg/dL can be considered in ACS patients with DM. After treating LDL-C to target, non-HDL-C can be considered as a secondary target for patients with TG \u2265 200 mg/dL. The suggested non-HDL-C target is < 100 mg/dL in ACS and CAD patients. For patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack presumed to be of atherosclerotic origin, statin therapy is beneficial and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL is the suggested target. For patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis or intracranial arterial stenosis, in addition to antiplatelets and blood pressure control, LDL-C should be lowered to < 100 mg/dL. Statin is necessary for DM patients with CV disease and the LDL-C target is < 70 mg/dL. For diabetic patients who are \u2265 40 years of age, or who are < 40 years of age but have additional CV risk factors, the LDL-C target should be < 100 mg/dL. After achieving LDL-C target, combination of other lipid-lowering agents with statin is reasonable to attain TG < 150 mg/dL and HDL-C >40 in men and >50 mg/dL in women in DM. LDL-C increased CV risk in patients with CKD. In adults with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73m(2) without chronic dialysis (CKD stage 3-5), statin therapy should be initiated if LDL-C \u2265 100 mg/dL. Ezetimibe can be added to statin to consolidate the CV protection in CKD patients. Mutations in LDL receptor, apolipoprotein B and PCSK9 genes are the common causes of FH. Diagnosis of FH usually depends on family history, clinical history of premature CAD, physical findings of xanthoma or corneal arcus and high levels of LDL-C. In addition to conventional lipid lowering therapies, adjunctive treatment with mipomersen, lomitapide, or PCSK9 inhibitors become necessary to further reduce LDL-C in patients with FH. Overall, these recommendations are to help the health care professionals in Taiwan to treat hyperlipidemia with current scientific evidences. We hope the prescription rate of lipid lowering drugs and control rate of hyperlipidemia in high risk patients could be increased by implementation of the clinical guidelines. The major purpose is to improve clinical outcomes of these high risk patients through the control of hyperlipidemia.",

Half of the HFD group also was given the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor pravastatin (S) through their drinking water (5\u00a0mg/kg body weight per day) to create HF+S dam group (n\u00a0=\u00a08/group). Offspring from each group were fed HFD or C diet from weaning to adulthood, generating respective dam/offspring dietary groups (C/C, HF/HF, HF+S/HF; n\u00a0=\u00a08/group). Body weight, blood pressure, and serum lipid profile were measured in female offspring at age 24\u00a0wk, and bone marrow endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) were cultured.",

The results also showed an increased bone marrow EPCs expressing colony numbers (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) compared with the HF/HF phenotype.", 
    "238": "Results from the present study demonstrated that statin administration in early life to dams fed on a HFD had a significant effect on their female offspring in terms of reduction in cardiovascular risk factors. Additionally, statin administration to female offspring on an HFD during early life was associated with reduction in circulating CRPs and an increased bone marrow EPC numbers and colony-forming characteristics.", 
    "239": "Ischemia and the following reperfusion damage are critical mechanisms of spinal cord injury. Statins have been reported to decrease ischemia-reperfusion injury in many organs including the spinal cord. Anti-oxidative effect is one of the main protective mechanisms of statin against neuronal death and cytotoxicity. We hypothesized that statins' anti-oxidative property would yield neuroprotective effects on spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion injury METHODS: Primary cultured spinal cord motor neurons were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rat fetuses. Ischemia-reperfusion injury model was induced by 60\u00a0min of oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and 24\u00a0h of reoxygenation. Healthy and OGD cells were treated with simvastatin at concentrations of 0.1, 1, and 10\u00a0\u03bcM for 24\u00a0h. Cell viability was assessed using water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST)-8, cytotoxicity with LDH, and production of free radicals with DCFDA (2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate).", 
    "240": "OGD reduced neuronal viability compared to normoxic control by 35.3%; however, 0.1-10\u00a0\u03bcM of simvastatin treatment following OGD improved cell survival. OGD increased LDH release up to 214%; however, simvastatin treatment attenuated its cytotoxicity at concentrations of 0.1-10\u00a0\u03bcM (p\u2009<\u20090.001 and p\u2009=\u20090.001). Simvastatin also reduced deteriorated morphological changes of motor neurons following OGD. Oxidative stress was reduced by simvastatin (0.1-10\u00a0\u03bcM) compared to untreated cells exposed to OGD (p\u2009<\u20090.001).",

    "242": "Purpose Treating small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains a therapeutic challenge. Experimental studies show that statins exert additive effects with agents, such as cisplatin, to impair tumor growth, and observational studies suggest that statins combined with anticancer therapies delay relapse and prolong life in several cancer types. To our knowledge, we report the first large, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of a statin with standard-of-care for patients with cancer, specifically SCLC. Patients and Methods Patients with confirmed SCLC (limited or extensive disease) and performance status 0 to 3 were randomly assigned to receive daily pravastatin 40 mg or placebo, combined with up to six cycles of etoposide plus cisplatin or carboplatin every 3 weeks, until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Primary end point was overall survival (OS), and secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS), response rate, and toxicity. Results Eight hundred forty-six patients from 91 United Kingdom hospitals were recruited. The median age of recruited patients was 64 years of age, 43% had limited disease, and 57% had extensive disease. There were 758 deaths and 787 PFS events. No benefit was found for pravastatin, either in all patients or in several subgroups. For pravastatin versus placebo, the 2-year OS rate was 13.2% (95% CI, 10.0 to 16.7) versus 14.1% (95% CI, 10.9 to 17.7), respectively, with a hazard ratio of 1.01 (95% CI, 0.88 to 1.16; P = .90. The median OS was 10.7 months v 10.6 months, respectively. The median PFS was 7.7 months v 7.3 months, respectively. The median OS (pravastatin v placebo) was 14.6 months in both groups for limited disease and 9.1 months versus 8.8 months, respectively, for extensive disease. Adverse events were similar between groups. Conclusion Pravastatin 40 mg combined with standard SCLC therapy, although safe, does not benefit patients. Our conclusions are the same as those found in all four much smaller, randomized, placebo-controlled trials specifically designed to evaluate statin therapy in patients with cancer.",

Statin-treated patients were more likely to present with stable angina, whereas non-statin-treated patients more frequently presented with acute myocardial infarction. Grayscale and VH-IVUS findings showed that lesions in statin-treated patients had a smaller plaque burden, but more dense calcium. Statin-treated patients had more calcified thick-cap fibroatheromas (9.2 vs. 3.7%, P=0.0007), but fewer VH-defined thin-cap fibroatheromas (45.2 vs. 56.1%, P=0.001) or plaque ruptures (26.6 vs. 38.4%, P=0.0001).

Moreover, meta-analysis of seven studies suggested that statins was beneficial on several specific poor outcomes of CHC patients (RR=0.49; 95% CI: 0.42-0.56). CHC patients with statin use were found to be inversely associated with a 55% reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (RR=0.45; 95% CI: 0.36-0.57) and 53% reduced risk of cirrhosis (RR=0.47; 95% CI: 0.33-0.67) as well as 44% reduced risk of mortality (RR=0.56; 95% CI: 0.46-0.69).

The decrease in total ATPase and Ca(2+)-ATPase activities in muscle tissue homogenates reflected impaired transport of active cations essential for muscle contraction. We conclude that abnormal relationships in the system of energy synthetic and energy-dependent processes in myocytes serve as the molecular basis for the formation of statin-induced degenerative changes.",

Modifying lipid targets, especially low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level, has become the first-line therapy for primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD. Intravascular imaging modalities have contributed to elucidating clinical efficacy of lipid lowering therapy on atherosclerotic plaques. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a high-resolution imaging tool enables visualization of plaque microstructures associated with its instability. This modality has demonstrated favorable changes in plaque microstructures under lowering LDL-C level. In addition, clinical studies using OCT have suggested potential association of other lipid targets, including triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol with plaque microstructures. Given continuing cardiovascular risks despite statin therapy, OCT will be an important imaging modality to evaluate novel therapeutic approaches that potentially modulates plaque instability."
