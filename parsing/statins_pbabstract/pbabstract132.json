    "2": "We have carried out a case-control study comparing statin use between patients with an incident diagnosis of OAC and controls with nonprogressive Barrett's oesophagus. Eighty-five cancer cases were compared with 170 age-matched and sex-matched controls. Risk factors and drug exposure were established using standardized interviews. Logistic regression was used to compare statin exposure and correct for confounding factors.", 
    "3": "Regular statin use was associated with a significantly lower incidence of OAC [uncorrected odds ratio (OR) 0.45, 95% confidence intervals 0.24-0.84)]. After correction for confounding variables including aspirin and NSAID use, statin use was still associated with a reduced incidence of OAC (OR 0.57, 0.28-0.94). Longer duration of statin use and higher doses were both associated with a significantly greater reduction in OAC. The combination of regular statin and aspirin use was associated with a significantly further reduced incidence of OAC (OR 0.31, 0.04-0.69).",

Dissolution test was performed in water containing 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 37 0.05 degrees C. FTIR spectrometry, X-ray diffractometry and thermal analysis confirmed the absence of any chemical interaction between polymer and the entrapped drugs. The granules size was about 280-619 \u03bcm. Scanning electron microscopy reported irregular morphology of granules. The entrapment efficiency was approximately 90% for atenolol and 70% for simvastatin. A controlled release behavior of both drugs but a burst release phenomenon of simvastatin from the formulations were observed. In conclusion, granules loaded with a hydrophilic and a lipophilic drug were successfully prepared.",

Administrative databases (including pharmaceutical prescriptions and hospital admissions) and laboratory test databases (including LDL-cholesterol values) of five local health units, distributed in Emilia Romagna, Toscana and Umbria, were linked. A retrospective cohort study was conducted and all subjects aged > or =18 years with a first prescription for statins (newly treated subjects) between January 1st, 2007 and June 30th, 2008 were included. All statin prescriptions over a 12 months follow-up period were considered and used to calculate adherence to treatment. Baseline and follow-up LDL-cholesterol, respectively, were defined according to the nearest determination to the first prescription for statins and to the end of the follow-up period. A total of 3.232 subjects was included, 1.516 males (47%) and 1.716 females (53%), with an average age equal to 65.9 +/- 11.3 years.

    "7": "Statins are the most effective and widely used drugs for treating dyslipidemia, a major risk factor for coronary heart disease. These are one of the safest hypolipidemic drugs but many patients are advised to discontinue statins for the fear of hepatotoxicity. Despite a lack of evidence that statins cause liver diseases, many physicians are reluctant to start statins in patients with an out-of-range liver enzymes value and this reluctance to initiate or interrupt the therapy with statins leads to dyslipidemia and its grave consequences. Further, there are some reports showing an additional benefit of statins in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with abnormal liver function tests.",

They had received a percutaneous coronary intervention in 55.1% and bypass surgery (coronary artery bypass graft) in 39.5%. Patients with MetS (n = 15,819) compared to those without MetS (n = 12,085) were less frequently males, and in terms of cardiac interventions, more often received coronary artery bypass surgery. Overall, statin use increased from 79.9% at entry to 95.0% at discharge (MetS: 79.7% to 95.2%). Patients with MetS compared to those without MetS received angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, oral antidiabetics, and insulin at entry and discharge more frequently, and less frequently clopidogrel and aspirin/clopidogrel combinations. Mean blood pressure was within the normal range at discharge, and did not differ substantially between groups (124/73 versus 120/72 mmHg). Overall, between entry and discharge, levels of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were substantially lowered, in particular in MetS patients. Thus, control rates of lipid parameters improved substantially, with the exception of high density lipoprotein cholesterol. Low density lipoprotein cholesterol rates <100 mg/dL increased from 38.7% at entry to 73.8% at discharge (MetS: from 39.4% to 74.6%) and triglycerides control rates (<150 mg/dL) from 58.1% to 70.4% (MetS: 43.7% to 62.2%).

The use of statins in patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease has reduced the incidence of major clinical events by 25% to 40%. However, despite aggressive statin therapy and the achievement of target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, the residual risk of cardiovascular events remains high. This review investigates emerging therapies to target the residual risk of cardiovascular events with concurrent statin therapy.",

    "20": "Triglycerides are a commonly measured component of lipid profiles. Raised triglycerides are a component of the metabolic syndrome and are strongly associated with future risk of diabetes as well as cardiovascular disease. Triglyceride-rich particles form a component of cardiovascular risk above that delineated by low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Elevated triglycerides are a marker of atherogenic small dense LDL, excess baseline and residual CVD risk even after statin therapy. Additional methods to lower triglycerides include niacin, fibrates and omega-3 fatty acids. Trials in monotherapy with both niacin and fibrates suggest some benefit in reducing CVD events based on evidence mostly derived from older studies. However, endpoint trials of adding either niacin or fenofibrate to statins have not shown any benefit, except possibly in patients with an increased atherogenic index (triglyceride\u200a:\u200aHDL-C ratio), or have been underpowered. Trials of omega-3 fatty acids have been performed at doses insufficient to affect lipid profiles in populations with inadequate control of LDL-C but did reduce CVD events.",

We explored the relationship between treatment effects and cumulative exposure to ezetimibe, with its effects on carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) in ARBITER 6-HALTS.", 
    "32": "This analysis includes the 159 patients randomized to ezetimibe within ARBITER 6-HALTS that completed the final imaging endpoint assessment. Eligibility criteria for ARBITER 6-HALTS included known coronary artery disease (CAD) or high risk for coronary heart disease, and treatment with a statin with LDL-C <100 mg/dL and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol <50 or 55 mg/dL for men and women, respectively. The mean CIMT was measured in the far wall of the distal common carotid artery. We analysed the univariate and multivariate relationships of the change in CIMT with baseline characteristics, on-treatment effects, and cumulative ezetimibe exposure (treatment duration \u00d7 dose \u00d7 adherence). Ezetimibe reduced LDL-C from 84 \u00b1 23 to 66 \u00b1 20 mg/dL. No net effect on CIMT was observed (baseline CIMT 0.898 \u00b1 0.151 mm; net change -0.002 mm; P = 0.52). There was an inverse relationship between LDL-C and change in CIMT such that greater reductions in LDL-C were associated with greater CIMT progression (r = -0.266; P < 0.001). Change in CIMT also had univariate associations with baseline LDL-C, triglycerides (TG), high-sensitive C-reactive protein, and systolic blood pressure and was directly associated with the change in TG and inversely associated with the change in high-sensitive C-reactive protein. Multivariable models controlling for change in LDL-C, cumulative ezetimibe exposure, and baseline and on-treatment variables showed that both increased LDL-C reduction (P = 0.005) and cumulative drug exposure (P = 0.02) were associated with ezetimibe-associated CIMT progression.", 
    "33": "Among CAD and high-risk patients on statin therapy in the ARBITER-6 trial, ezetimibe leads to paradoxical progression of CIMT in association with both greater LDL-C reduction and cumulative drug exposure. These findings may suggest the presence of off-target actions of ezetimibe.",

It consisted of two face-to-face patient counseling sessions with a pharmacist that addressed patient barriers to adherence. A group of 2056 NTT statin patients was identified between September 1, 2010 and October 31, 2010, and was followed for 12 months. The intervention group consisted of 586 patients, and the comparison group comprised 516 patients. Outcomes were measured using the continuous medication possession ratio (MPR), categorical MPR, and medication persistency.", 
    "37": "After adjusting for covariates, the intervention group had statistically greater MPR than the comparison group at every month measured. For example, at 12 months the intervention group had a MPR of 61.8% (CI, 54.5%-69.2%) and the comparison group had a MPR of 56.9% (CI, 49.5%-64.3%); this 4.9% difference is significant (P < 0.01). The 12 month categorical MPR also showed significant differences between groups (\u03c7(2) = 6.12, P < 0.05); 40.9% of the intervention group and 33.7% of comparison group had a MPR greater than or equal to 80%. Finally, the intervention group had significantly greater persistency with their medication therapy than the comparison group at 60, 90, 120, and 365 days.",

LDL-C goals and normal levels of HDL-C and TG were defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel 3 guidelines. Patients with previous CHD, diabetes, and 10-year CHD risk > 20% were classified as high risk. Multiple logistic regressions evaluated predictors of normal lipid-level attainment.",

Despite therapy (91.2% statins only), 22.7% had elevated LDL-C, 31.9% had low HDL-C, 12.3% had elevated TG, and 13.9% had multiple abnormal lipid levels. The strongest predictors of attaining \u2265 2 normal lipid levels included male gender (odds ratio [OR]: 2.11 [1.12 to 4.01]), diabetes (OR: 0.43 [0.23 to 0.78]), obesity (OR: 0.91 [0.86 to 0.97]), and CHD risk > 20% (OR: 0.33 [0.15 to 0.71]).", 
    "42": "Current approaches to lipid management in Hong Kong, primarily using statins, considerably improve attainment of LDL-C goal. However, a large proportion of patients do not achieve normal HDL-C levels and control of multiple lipid parameters remains poor.

    "43": "The aim of this study was to determine transepithelial transport characteristics of rosuvastatin and effect of ursolic acid (P-gp potential inhibitor) and ko143 (ABC transporters selective inhibitor) on its transport in Caco-2 monolayers. A reliable Caco-2 cell monolayers model was established. The TEER value was used to inspect integrity of cell model. Apparent permeability coefficients (Papp(BL-AP) and Papp(AP-BL)) were used to analyze transepithelial transport of rosuvastatin. Uptake of rosuvastatin was time- and concentration-dependent in Caco-2 cell. The ko143 but not ursolic acid had effect on the uptake of rosuvastatin in Caco-2 cell monolayer model and affected apparent permeability coefficient and apparent permeability of rosuvastatin. Active transport and passive diffusion absorption existed in transepithelial transport of rosuvastatin in Caco-2 cell model. Ursolic acid had no effect on transport of rosuvastatin in Caco-2 cell monolayer. The result indicated that ursolic acid may not cause effect on intestinal absorption of rosuvastatin.", 
    "44": "Statins are commonly prescribed medications that potently reduce cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiovascular events. Preclinical studies suggested statins also possess cancer chemopreventive properties. However, the clinical studies provided contradictory results as to whether statins influence the risk of pancreatic cancer. Herein, we present this meta-analysis to assess the association between statin use and risk of pancreatic cancer.",

Pooled results only indicated a non-significant decrease of pancreatic cancer risk among all statin users (RR 0.89; 95 % CIs, 0.74-1.07). Similar results were obtained in the subgroup analyses of the long-term (more than 4 years) follow-up (RR 0.94, 0.81-1.08) and statin use (RR 0.97, 0.76-1.23), and a null association was found between lipophilic statin use and pancreatic cancer risk (RR 1.03, 0.92-1.16). No evidence of publication bias was observed in the present meta-analysis. However, significant heterogeneity was detected among all studies (p < 0.00001, I(2) = 81 %).",

A drop in myoplasmic ATP paralleled with sustained elevations in cytosolic Ca\u00b2\u207a concentration represents a common signature of rhabdomyolysis. Interestingly, cardiac tissue is hardly affected or only secondary, as a consequence of imbalance in electrolytes or acid-base equilibrium. This dogma is now impaired by compounds, which show up with combined toxicity in heart and skeletal muscle. In this review, cases of rhabdomyolysis with novel recently approved drugs will be explored for new target mechanisms in the light of previously described pathomechanisms.",

    "54": "Venous and arterial thromboses have traditionally been regarded as separate diseases with different causes. However, recent epidemiological studies have documented an association between these vascular complications, probably due to the presence of more overlapping risk factors than previously recognized. This narrative review first focuses on the risk factors associated with both arterial and venous thrombotic events. In addition, it summarizes the more recent data on the risk of incident venous thromboembolism in patients with asymptomatic atherosclerosis or clinical manifestations of atherothrombosis, as well as on the risk of incident atherothrombotic events in patients with previous manifestation of venous thromboembolism. The potential clinical implications are also discussed.", 
    "55": "Statins are an effective treatment for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases and used extensively worldwide. However, myotoxicity induced by statins is a common adverse event and a major barrier to maximising cardiovascular risk reduction. The clinical spectrum of statin induced myotoxicity includes asymptomatic rise in creatine kinase concentration, myalgia, myositis and rhabdomyolysis. In certain cases, the cessation of statin therapy does not result in the resolution of muscular symptoms or the normalization of creatine kinase, raising the possibility of necrotizing autoimmune myopathy. There is increasing understanding and recognition of the pathophysiology and risk factors of statin induced myotoxicity. Careful history and physical examination in conjunction with selected investigations such as creatine kinase measurement, electromyography and muscle biopsy in appropriate clinical scenario help diagnose the condition. The management of statin induced myotoxicity involves statin cessation, the use of alternative lipid lowering agents or treatment regimes, and in the case of necrotizing autoimmune myopathy, immunosuppression.",

Especially diabetic nephropathy is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and its prevalence is increasing. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b1 (PPAR-\u03b1), a member of a large nuclear receptor superfamily, is expressed in several tissues including the kidney. Recently, experimental data have suggested that PPAR-\u03b1 activation plays a pivotal role in the regulation of fatty acid oxidation, lipid metabolism, inflammatory and vascular responses, and might regulate various metabolic and intracellular signalling pathways that lead to diabetic microvascular complications. This review examines the role of PPAR-\u03b1 activation in diabetic nephropathy and summarises data from experimental and clinical studies on the emerging therapeutic potential of fibrates in diabetic nephropathy.",

Multivariate analysis identified poor functional capacity (hazard ratio, 3.5 [95% confidence interval, 1.9-6.5]; P < .001), dialysis dependence (2.2 [1.3-3.8]; P = .003), gangrene (2.2 [1.4-3.4]; P < .001), need for infrapopliteal intervention (2.0 [1.2-3.1]; P = .004), and diabetes (1.8 [1.1-3.1]; P = .031) as predictors of limb loss. Poor functional capacity (3.3 [2.4-4.6]; P < .001), coronary artery disease (1.5 [1.1-2.1]; P = .006), and gangrene (1.4 [1.1-1.9]; P = .007) predicted poorer survival. Statin use predicted improved survival (0.6 [0.5-0.8]; P = .001). Need for infrapopliteal interventions predicted poorer PP (0.6 [0.5-0.9-2.2]; P = .007), whereas use of autologous vein predicted better PP (1.8 [1.1-2.9]; P = .017).",

    "61": "There are large and increasing discharges of statins into the aquatic environment. Statins are cholesterol-lowering pharmaceuticals, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, an enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis pathway. Earlier studies have shown that statins will affect the expression of a range of genes in mammalian tissues and this group of pharmaceuticals has also been shown to affect membrane transporters. Changes in gene expression and ion transport in aquatic organisms may have dramatic consequences for the individual. The aim of the present study was to clarify whether waterborne exposure to a selected statin, atorvastatin, would affect gene expression in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) gill or liver or ion regulation in gills. Juvenile rainbow trout were exposed to two atorvastatin acid and atorvastatin lactone concentrations for 7 days (nominal concentrations 200 ng L(-1) and 10 \u03bcg L(-1)). The exposures caused up-regulated gene expression in gill, not liver, and only at the lowest concentration. Genes involved in membrane transport (pgp, mrp1), oxidative stress response (sod, mt), apoptosis (bax) and biotransformation (sult2b) were differentially expressed whereas the expression of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis (hmgr, fdps) or peroxisomal proliferation (ppar) were not affected. There were no significant changes in gill Na(+)/K(+) ATPase activity following exposure to atorvastatin. The pattern of differentially expressed genes in rainbow trout gills differ from responses previously observed in mammalian tissues following statin exposure.",

Fifty RA patients were randomized in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial to receive either 10 mg of rosuvastatin or placebo as an adjunct to existing disease-modifying antirheumatic therapy. Patients were followed up for a six-month period. Measurements were done at baseline and six months. CRP and IL-6 were measured in the blood. RA disease activity was measured using disease activity score based on 28 joint counts (DAS 28). When analysing from baseline to six months there was no difference between the rosuvastatin and placebo groups in rheumatoid disease activity (-0.01; standard deviation [SD], 1.08; and +0.18; SD, 0.95; respectively; P value 0.509). There was a trend towards improvement in CRP in the rosuvastatin group (-3.23; SD, 18.18) compared with the placebo group (+17.43; SD, 38.03); P value, 0.161. IL-6 showed a trend towards worsening in the rosuvastatin group (+0.15; SD, 1.09) compared with placebo (-0.73; SD, 1.4); P value, 0.054. These data show that rosuvastatin with might decrease the CRP independent to IL-6 in patients with RA but does not improve the overall rheumatoid disease activity.",

The effect of the treatments on cellular low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) messenger ribonucleic acid and protein levels were determined by using real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, respectively.", 
    "70": "Resistin, at physiological levels observed in human obesity, down-regulated hepatocyte LDLR expression substantially (by 40%). A key mechanism by which human resistin inhibited LDLR levels was by increased cellular expression of the recently identified protease, PCSK9, which enhances intracellular LDLR lysosomal degradation. The quantitatively important role of human resistin in LDLR expression was demonstrated by antibody-immunoprecipitation removal of resistin in human serum, which decreased serum stimulation of hepatocyte LDLRs markedly (by 80%). Furthermore, resistin diminished statin-mediated up-regulation of the LDLR by 60%, implicating resistin in the relative ineffectiveness of statins in selective target populations.",

    "82": "There are several studies supporting the role of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as atorvastatin against carcinogenesis, in which inhibiting the generation of prenyl intermediates involved in protein prenylation plays the crucial role. Mutation of Kras gene is the most common genetic alteration in pancreatic cancer and the Ras protein requires prenylation for its membrane localization and activity. In the present study, the effectiveness of atorvastatin against pancreatic carcinogenesis and its effect on protein prenylation were determined using the LSL-KrasG12D-LSL-Trp53R172H-Pdx1-Cre mouse model (called Pankras/p53 mice). Five-week-old Pankras/p53 mice were fed either an AIN93M diet or a diet supplemented with 100 ppm atorvastatin. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with Log-Rank test revealed a significant increase in survival in mice fed 100 ppm atorvastatin (171.9 \u00b1 6.2 d) compared to the control mice (144.9 \u00b1 8.4 d, P < 0.05). Histologic and immunohistochemical analysis showed that atorvastatin treatment resulted in a significant reduction in tumor volume and Ki-67-labeled cell proliferation. Mechanistic studies on primary pancreatic tumors and the cultured murine pancreatic carcinoma cells revealed that atorvastatin inhibited prenylation in several key proteins, including Kras protein and its activities, and similar effect was observed in pancreatic carcinoma cells treated with farnesyltransferase inhibitor R115777. Microarray assay on the global gene expression profile demonstrated that a total of 132 genes were significantly modulated by atorvastatin; and Waf1p21, cyp51A1, and soluble epoxide hydrolase were crucial atorvastatin-targeted genes which involve in inflammation and carcinogenesis. This study indicates that atorvastatin has the potential to serve as a chemopreventive agent against pancreatic carcinogenesis.",

The others (compliant) - 59 pts (84.3%) received standard pharmacological treatment after MI. Nevertheless, an increase of IMT complex value after follow-up compared to initial IMT values of all examined peripheral arteries was observed (respectively: IMT CCA - 0.91 \u00b1 0.26 vs 1.10 \u00b1 0.36, p=0.002, IMT of carotid bulb - 1.31 \u00b1 0.55 vs 1.82 \u00b1 0.69, p=0.012, IMT CFA - 1.38 \u00b1 0.64 vs 1.97 \u00b1 0.75, p=0.014). Non-compliant patients had statistically significant higher IMT values after follow-up when compared to compliant subjects (1.62 vs 1.20, p= 0.017).

RV dysfunction is defined by hypertrophy with preserved myocardial contractility and cardiac output. RV hypertrophy seems to be a common complication of chronic and advanced lung disease. RV failure is rare, except during acute exacerbations of chronic lung disease or when multiple comorbidities are present.

    "89": "The pathophysiology of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) formation involves a complex interplay of genetic predisposition, cardiovascular risk factors, and hemodynamic forces. The medical community has resorted to the use of pharmacologic agents based on weak data transplanted from either abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) or Marfan syndrome. However, aneurysms differ significantly based on their anatomic location and etiology. Epidemiologic and experimental data demonstrate that different genetic and nongenetic risk factors as well as diverse physiologic processes are responsible for the development and progression of sporadic TAA, familial TAA, and AAA. Therefore, these disease processes need to be considered as distinct entities and not hastily grouped together. The extrapolation of data from one aneurysmal disease process to another is still ill-founded and potentially harmful. Clinical trials in TAA are required before medical therapies, such as \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, statins, or macrolide antibiotics, can be recommended.", 
    "90": "Optimal lipid targets (OLT) should be the goal for all individuals treated in the new era of cardiovascular (CV) disease prevention. Evidence supports that average LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) values in Westernized populations are not optimal. Lessons from nature and science support a physiologic LDL-C target of <70 mg/dL. Clinical trial evidence further supports optimal LDL-C targets, although several critical questions remain unanswered. Using a calculated LDL-C may have limitations in clinical practice. Non-HDL-C cholesterol may be a better predictor of outcomes, and should therefore be provided on all laboratory reports. Specific HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) targets are significantly more complicated. Although a low HDL-C predicts a less favorable outcome independent of LDL-C level, an HDL-C level > 50 mg/dL is associated with lower CV risk. Clinical trials on HDL-C have thus far been disappointing. OLT should be the goal for all individuals as an important part of addressing global CV risk.", 
    "91": "Angiogenesis is induced from sprouting of preexisting endothelial cells leading to neovascularization. Imbalance in the angiogenic and antiangiogenic mediators triggers angiogenesis, which may be physiological in the normal state or pathological in malignancy and atherosclerosis. Physiologic angiogenesis is instrumental for restoration of vessel wall normoxia and resolution inflammation, leading to atherosclerosis regression. However, pathological angiogenesis enhances disease progression, increasing macrophage infiltration and vessel wall thickness, perpetuating hypoxia and necrosis. In addition, thin-walled fragile neovessels may rupture, leading to intraplaque hemorrhage. Lipid-rich red blood cell membranes and free hemoglobin are detrimental to plaque composition, increasing inflammation, lipid core expansion, and oxidative stress. In addition, associated risk factors that include polymorphysms in the haptoglobin genotype and diabetes mellitus may modulate the features of plaque vulnerability. This review will focus on physiological and pathological angiogenesis in atherosclerosis and summarizes the current status of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy, microvascular rarefaction, and possible statin-mediated effects in atherosclerosis neovascularization.", 
    "92": "Protective effects of statins have been well documented for stroke therapy. Here, we used a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess these evidences. We identified 190 studies using statin treatment in stroke animal models by electronic searching. From those, only studies describing ischemic occlusive stroke and reporting data on infarct volume and/or neurological outcome were included in the analysis (41 publications, 1882 animals). The global estimate effect was assessed by Weighted Mean Difference meta-analysis. Statins reduced infarct volume by 25.12% (20.66%-29.58%, P < 0.001) and consistently, induced an improvement on neurological outcome (20.36% (14.17%-26.56%), P < 0.001). Stratified analysis showed that simvastatin had the greatest effect on infarct volume reduction (38.18%) and neurological improvement (22.94%), whereas bigger infarct reduction was observed giving the statin as a pre-treatment (33.5%) compared with post-treatment (16.02%). The use of pentobarbital sodium, the timing of statin administration, the statement of conflict of interest and the type of statin studied were found to be independent factors in the meta-regression, indicating their influence on the results of studies examining statin treatment. In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides further evidences of the efficacy of statins, supporting their potential use for human stroke therapy.", 
    "93": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, are the medical treatment of choice for hypercholesterolemia. In addition to lowering serum-cholesterol levels, statins appear to promote pleiotropic effects that are independent of changes in serum cholesterol. In this study, we investigated the effects of low-dose fluvastatin on antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, SOD; catalase), total nitrite/nitrate levels, and vascular reactivity in 2% cholesterol-fed rabbits. This diet did not generate any fatty streak lesions on carotid artery wall. However, SOD activity significantly increased with cholesterol feeding whereas the catalase activities decreased. The levels of nitrite/nitrate, stable products of NO degradation, diminished. Moreover, dietary cholesterol reduced vascular responses to acetylcholine, but contractions to serotonin were augmented. Fluvastatin treatment abrogated the cholesterol-induced increase in SOD, increased the levels of nitric oxide metabolites in tissue, and restored both the impaired vascular responses to acetylcholine and the augmented contractile responses to serotonin without affecting plasma-cholesterol levels. Phenylephrine contractions and nitroglycerine vasodilatations did not change in all groups. This study indicated that fluvastatin treatment performed early enough to improve impaired vascular responses may delay cardiovascular complications associated with several cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "94": "Coronary vasospasm is an unusual cause of angina and myocardial ischemia, with the potential to provoke acute myocardial infarction, malignant cardiac arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. The diagnosis is largely clinical and requires a high index of suspicion. Provocation studies are rarely performed due to the risks of the procedure and the relatively low incidence of disease. A subset of patients does not respond to conventional medical therapy and a paucity of evidence exists to guide therapy. While generally believed a multifocal phenomenon, there have been reports of successful treatment of focal, refractory vasospasm with coronary stent implantation. Furthermore, consideration of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator is warranted when vasospasm is complicated by lethal ventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "95": "It was investigated whether pharmacogenetic factors, both as single polymorphism and as gene-gene interactions, have an added value over non-genetic factors in predicting statin response. Five common polymorphisms were selected in apolipoprotein E, angiotensin-converting enzyme, hepatic lipase and toll-like receptor 4. Linear regression models were built and compared on R(2) to estimate the added value of single polymorphisms and gene-gene interactions. The selected polymorphisms and the gene-gene interactions had a small added value in predicting change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (LDL-c) as response to statins over the non-genetic predictors (P=0.104), and also in predicting LDL-c in non-treated patients (P=0.016). Moreover, four gene-gene interactions with statin therapy were identified. The added value of genetic factors over non-genetic variables is for the greater part produced by gene-gene interactions. This underlines the importance to examine gene-gene interactions in future (pharmaco)genetic research.", 
    "96": "Based on the results of recent randomized, controlled clinical trials and analyses of their follow-up periods the concept of metabolic memory cannot be restricted to antihyperglycaemic treatment only, rather it can be extended to lipid-lowering and antihypertensive treatment and even life-style modification. This broadened concept can be designated as vascular memory. According to this new concept, not only immediate and short-term but long-term effects of the metabolic and cardiovascular risk milieu are of great importance. Consequently, early and intensive lifestyle interventions, treatment of hyperglycaemia, lipid abnormalities and hypertension can result in beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes even in the long run. On the contrary, failing in target-oriented treatment from early detection of abnormalities can be associated with life-threatening cardiovascular events subsequently. Additional experimental studies are needed to characterize the exact pathomechanism of vascular memory and further clinical trials are also essential to explore its real clinical significance.",

Since by now, traditional medicine and some corticosteroid agents have been used for treatment of dermatitis caused by beetle paederus. Because, there are few researches about classical treatment of the disease at academic level, this study planned to compare the effectiveness of triamcinolone ointment and atorvastatin tablet with placebo in treatment ofpaederus dermatitis in Northern Iran. A randomized double-blind clinical trial was carried out on 30 patients referred to the hospital and clinics at Sari and Neka countries in Northern Iran during 6 months. Patients were randomly divided into two therapeutic equal groups. The first group was triamcinolone ointment twice a day and a placebo atorvastatin tablet daily. The second group was oral atorvastatin one tablet (20 mg) daily and a placebo triamcinolone ointment twice a day. In Seventh day of visits, therapeutic response of the patients in triamcinolone and atorvastatin group were 93.33 and 80%, respectively. No significant differences were found in therapeutic outcome between the two groups (p > 0.05). The results showed both oftriamcinolone ointment and oral atorvastatin had similar effect on paederus dermatitis.

    "98": "A simple, rapid and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) assay method has been developed and validated for simultaneous quantification of sitagliptin and simvastatin in human plasma. Carbamazepine was used as an internal standard (IS). The analytes and IS were extracted from the human plasma by liquid-liquid extraction technique. The reconstituted samples were chromatographed on an Alltima HP C(18) column using an isocratic solvent mixture [acetonitrile-5\u2009mm ammonium acetate (pH 4.5), 85:15 (v/v)] at a flow rate of 1.0\u2009mL/min. Method validation was performed as per Food and Drug Administration guidelines and the results met the acceptance criteria.

The results of the intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy studies were well within the acceptable limits. Both the analytes were found to be stable in a battery of stability studies. The method is precise and sensitive enough for its intended purpose. A run time of 3.0\u2009min for each sample made it possible to analyze more than 300 plasma samples per day.

    "99": "Rosuvastatin is a statin (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A [HMG-CoA] reductase inhibitor) that also serves as an endothelial dysfunction salvager in many disease models. Endothelial dysfunction is assumed to play a pivotal role in the process of chronic renal failure. The authors tested rosuvastatin on a rat model of renal failure with hypertension. Renal failure was induced by 5/6 nephrectomy (Nx). Fisher rats were divided into four groups: sham (n = 10), sham + rosuvastatin (n = 10), Nx (n = 9), and Nx + rosuvastatin (n =10). After 4 weeks, the authors determined renal function, lipid profile, and urine albumin excretion, investigated small renal arteries for endothelium function in response to acetylcholine by perfused juxtamedullary nephron technique, and detected intrarenal inflammatory cytokine expression by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. 5/6 Nx significantly increased blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and systolic/diastolic blood pressure, and severe albuminuria developed. The deterioration of renal function, hypertension, and albuminuria were almost normalized by rosuvastatin therapy; in addition, rosuvastatin prevented intrarenal inflammatory cytokine expression and the impaired response to acetylcholine of the renal endothelium. Microscopically, rosuvastatin significantly inhibited the development of progressing renal fibrosis, preserved glomerular structure and tubular integrity, and significantly reduced the degree of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. In conclusion, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor rosuvastatin can ameliorate markers of endothelium dysfunction and offers a significant protective effect against the development of renal failure caused by 5/6 Nx in rats. Rosuvastatin might, therefore, represent a novel therapeutic agent for chronic kidney disease.",

    "101": "Little is known about the efficacy and safety of intensive lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with statin/ezetimibe therapy after coronary stent implantation in patients with stable angina. Fifty patients with stable angina were randomly divided into an atorvastatin (10 mg/day) (A) group and an atorvastatin (10 mg/day)/ezetimibe (10 mg/day) (A+E) group after stent implantation. Follow-up coronary angiography was performed at 6-9 months after stenting. The A and A+E groups showed significant reductions in LDL-C. The levels of LDL-C in the A+E group were significantly lower than those in the A group at follow-up, whereas there were no differences in major adverse cardiac events, in-stent restenosis, or in-stent % diameter stenosis (DS) between the groups. Only the A+E group showed a significant decrease in the levels of highly sensitive C-reactive protein. In a sub-analysis, %DS in the non-target vessel significantly decreased in both groups. Moreover, \u0394%DS (\u0394=the value at baseline minus that at follow-up) in the A+E group was more closely associated with LDL-C levels at follow-up than that in the A group.

    "102": "COPD is considered today as an inflammatory disease of the lungs and bronchi, often associated with circulating inflammatory markers and non-respiratory co-morbidities. C-reactive protein is a good example of a circulating biomarker in this disease. Recent studies have shown that it is particularly associated with some phenotypes of COPD, that it is linked with cardiovascular and other co-morbidities, and that it has genetic determinants. In view of reports in the recent literature treatments aimed at decreasing systemic inflammation in COPD, in particular the use of statins, are discussed. Treatment of COPD should no longer be limited to relief of bronchial obstruction, but should, in the future, address the systemic inflammation that characterizes this disease.", 
    "103": "Coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA) is a valuable tool for assessing coronary artery disease (CAD). Although statin use is widely recommended for persons with diabetes older than age 40, little is known about the presence and severity of CAD in younger patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). We evaluated coronary artery calcium (CAC) and coronary CTA in young persons with both DM1 and DM2 in an attempt to detect the earliest objective evidence of arteriosclerosis eligible for primary prevention.", 
    "104": "We prospectively enrolled 40 persons with DM (25 type 1 and 15 type 2) between the ages of 19 and 35 presenting with diabetes for 5 years or longer. All patients underwent coronary CTA and CAC scans to evaluate for early atherosclerotic disease. Each plaque in the coronary artery was classified as noncalcified or calcified-mixed. We also evaluated all segments with stenosis, dividing them into mild (<50%), moderate (50-70%), and severe (>70%).", 
    "105": "The average age of the DM1 subjects were 26 \u00b1 4 (SD) years and 30 \u00b1 4 years for DM2 patients (P < .01), with duration of diabetes of 8 \u00b1 5 years and average HbA1c% of 8.7 \u00b1 1.6 (norm = 4.6-6.2). Abnormal scans were present in 57.5%, noncalcified in 35% and calcified-mixed plaque in 22.5%. Persons with DM2 had a higher prevalence of positive coronary CTA scans than DM1: 80% versus 44% (P\u00a0<\u00a0.03) and more positive CAC scores 53% versus 4%, (P < .01). The total segment score of 2.1 \u00b1 3.4 (P < .01) and total plaque score 1.9 \u00b1 2.8 (P < .01) were highly correlated to each other. Plaque was almost uniformly absent below age 25, and became increasingly common in individuals over the age of 25 years for both groups. The average radiation exposure was 2.5 \u00b1 1.3 mSv.", 
    "106": "Our study verifies that early CAD can be diagnosed with coronary CTA and minimal radiation exposure in young adults with DM. A negative CAC score was not sufficient to exclude early CAD as we observed a preponderance of noncalcified plaque in this cohort. Coronary CTA in young DM patients older than age 25 may provide earlier identification of disease than does a CAC because only noncalcified plaque is frequently present. Coronary CTA provides an opportunity to consider initiation of earlier primary CAD prevention rather than waiting for the age of 40 as currently recommended by the American Diabetes Association guidelines.",

SHI-1 cells were incubated with different concentrations of SV (5, 10, 15 \u00b5mol/L). Otherwise, SHI-1 cells without any treatment were used as control. Cells in different groups were collected at 24, 48 and 72 h after incubation for further detection. MTT method was used to assay the growth inhibition rate and flow cytometry was used to detect the early stage apoptosis ratio. The human PI3K-AKT Signaling Pathway RT(2) Profiler(TM) PCR Array was used to detect the expression of 84 genes involved in PI3K-AKT signaling. The results indicated that the SV inhibited the proliferation and inducted the apoptosis of SHI-1 cells in time- and dose-dependent manners significantly. The growth inhibition rates of SHI-1 cells treated with 15 \u00b5mol/L SV for 24, 48 and 72 h were 26.82, 47.09 and 63.92, respectively; and their early stage apoptosis ratios were 5.75, 13.25 and 15.59, respectively. Compared with the control group, expression levels of 39 genes were changed in the group of 15 \u00b5mol/L SV at 48 h, among them 26 genes were down-regulated and 13 genes were up-regulated. It is concluded that the SV can inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of SHI-1 cells, and the mechanism may be associated with the changes of gene expression level in PI3K-AKT signaling pathway regulated by SV.", 
    "117": "The hepatic organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) influence the pharmacokinetics of several drug classes and are involved in many clinical drug-drug interactions. Predicting potential interactions with OATPs is, therefore, of value. Here, we developed in vitro and in silico models for identification and prediction of specific and general inhibitors of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OATP2B1. The maximal transport activity (MTA) of each OATP in human liver was predicted from transport kinetics and protein quantification. We then used MTA to predict the effects of a subset of inhibitors on atorvastatin uptake in vivo. Using a data set of 225 drug-like compounds, 91 OATP inhibitors were identified. In silico models indicated that lipophilicity and polar surface area are key molecular features of OATP inhibition. MTA predictions identified OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 as major determinants of atorvastatin uptake in vivo. The relative contributions to overall hepatic uptake varied with isoform specificities of the inhibitors.",

The rats were divided into six groups and fed different diets with or without supplement of 1% cholestin and 25,000-50,000 (IU) vitamin A for 2 months. Hence, the symptoms of vitamin A toxicity in rats included loss of body weight, hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. However, these toxic effects of vitamin A were significantly reduced when the rats fed a diet supplemented with cholestin. Furthermore, the level of vitamin A in the serum of rats treated with cholestin and vitamin A was higher than that of the rats treated with vitamin A alone. It indicated that cholestin might play a role in reducing the toxic effect of vitamin A in rats.",

Major occlusive coronary events were equally strongly associated with the cholesterol- and particle-based total LDL measures; adjusted hazard ratios per 1-SD-higher level were 1.25 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-1.34) for LDL cholesterol, 1.22 (95% CI, 1.14-1.32) for non-HDL cholesterol, 1.23 (95% CI, 1.15-1.33) for apolipoprotein B, and 1.25 (95% CI, 1.16-1.35) for LDL particle number.

This clinical and social problem is mainly related to the ongoing epidemic of obesity and metabolic syndrome resulting in hypertension and diabetes mellitus. CKD is a well-recognized risk multiplier for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and it is widely known that CVD is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD. Lipid metabolism abnormalities are commonly associated with CKD. These consist of increased levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDL), triglycerides, very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and lipoprotein(a), and reduced levels of HDL cholesterol. Lipid abnormalities contribute to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in CKD patients. Some evidence also suggests that dyslipidemia may contribute to the progression of renal disease associated with type 1 and type 2 diabetic as well as non-diabetic renal disease. In the general population, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce the cardiovascular risk and prevent CVD. Similar data from secondary analyses of CKD subgroups of larger prospective trials using statins suggest a beneficial effect on cardiovascular outcomes and - albeit with more conflicting evidence - the progression of renal disease. Statins reduce blood levels of LDL cholesterol but also have multiple effects above and beyond cholesterol lowering, including direct effects on vascular tissue, kidney, bone, and glucose metabolism. The evidence linking dyslipidemia management with statins to cardiovascular disease and the decline in renal function in CKD patients will be presented in this review.",

SV-evoked prolongation of nodal refractoriness and concealed conduction caused rate-dependent ventricular slowing effects during AF. The ability of simvastatin to decrease the excitable gap by its heterogeneous effects on nodal dual pathways proposes its protective role in AF.", 
    "132": "To support drug development, the drug-drug interaction potential (DDI) of an investigational drug (AZX) was assessed against the probe estradiol 17\u03b2-glucuronide as well as against simvastatin acid, atorvastatin, pravastatin, pitavastatin, fluvastatin, rosuvastatin and estrone 3-sulfate. The inhibitory potentials of the OATP1B1 inhibitors rifamycin SV and gemfibrozil were assessed in parallel. Monolayer cellular uptake assays were used to determine inhibition of human OATP1B1. Apparent K(m) values for the OATP1B1-mediated transport of [(3)H] substrates were determined prior to their use as probes in inhibition studies, and ranged from 0.6 to 29 \u03bcM for statins. The K(m) of lipophilic simvastatin acid could not be determined due to its high passive permeability that masked OATP1B1 transport, and therefore this statin could not be used as a probe. Estrone 3-sulfate exhibited biphasic kinetics, whereas estradiol 17\u03b2-glucuronide demonstrated simple Michaelis-Menton kinetics. AZX moderately inhibited OATP1B1-mediated transport of all statins (IC(50)=4.6-9.7 \u03bcM), except fluvastatin, of estradiol 17\u03b2-glucuronide (IC(50)=5.3 \u03bcM), and weakly inhibited estrone 3-sulfate (IC(50)=79 \u03bcM). Rifamycin SV strongly, and gemfibrozil weakly, inhibited the OATP1B1-mediated transport of substrates. Estradiol 17\u03b2-glucuronide was identified as a good surrogate probe for statins when assessing OATP1B1 inhibitory potential using this test system. Inhibition data was used to predict the likelihood of a clinical DDI, using current draft US FDA guidance and recommendations of the International Transporter Consortium. Predictions for AZX indicated the potential for an OATP1B1-mediated DDI in vivo and that a clinical interaction study is warranted to confirm whether AZX is an OATP1B1 inhibitor in the clinic.", 
    "133": "This research investigates the environmental behavior of two widely prescribed cholesterol-lowering statin drugs that are expected to be present at significant concentrations in wastewater influents, namely: atorvastatin and simvastatin. Batch biodegradation experiments suggest that both statins are well degraded during secondary treatment, and removal rates exhibit a substrate-enhancement model reflecting elements of both first-order behavior and cometabolism. Resulting biodegradation parameters are used in conjunction with literature sorption parameters to construct a mass-balance model of statin concentrations during conventional treatment. Model results exhibit excellent accuracy compared to measurements from a medium-sized WWTP in the Southeastern USA. Influent concentrations of 1.56 \u03bcg L(-1) and 1.23 \u03bcg L(-1) were measured for atorvastatin and simvastatin. Results also suggest that 85-90% of each drug is removed during conventional treatment, with sorption accounting for less than 10% of overall removal. Expected effluent concentrations are orders of magnitude less than previously reported ecotoxicity thresholds for both drugs. Overall, results suggest statin active ingredients do not pose a significant environmental threat. It is recommended that future work characterize the fate of statin metabolites and that the same mass-balance modeling approach be used to assess other highly-prescribed pharmaceutical drugs.",

Next to their cholesterol-lowering activity, statins have immunomodulatory properties. Based on these properties, we hypothesized that statin use may eventually lead to dysregulation of immune responses, possibly resulting in autoimmunity. We have recently shown in an observational study that statin use was associated with an increased risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis.

Atorvastatin administration after CIA induction resulted in earlier onset than atorvastatin administration before induction, or than pravastatin administration before or after induction. The arthritic score of animals given pravastatin before CIA induction was similar to that of the nonstatin controls, whereas the other groups that received statins showed higher arthritic scores. Atorvastatin administration, especially before CIA induction, increased anti-CII autoantibody production. IL-2 and IL-17 production by lymph node and spleen cells was higher in CIA animals than in PBS controls, but was not affected by statin administration. While IFN\u03b3 production was not affected by CIA induction, atorvastatin administration before CIA induction increased the production of this cytokine.",

In addition to their cholesterol-lowering activities, statins exert pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effects, which might contribute to their beneficial effects on lipid-unrelated inflammatory diseases. Recently it has been demonstrated that the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-\u03b1 mediates anti-inflammatory effects of simvastatin in vivo models of acute inflammation.

In order to elucidate whether the effects of simvastatin are due to activation of the PPAR-\u03b1, we also investigated the effect of a PPAR-\u03b1 antagonist, GW6471 (1 mg/kg administered i.p. 30 min prior treatment with simvastatin) on the protective effects of on simvastatin.",

This knowledge has led to the development of many drugs that target specific elements of viral replication, including viral proteins and host factors required for replication. The NS3/4A serine protease inhibitors were the first of these to be used in the clinic, and reagents that target other elements of the viral lifecycle are in advanced stages of clinical development. These include new NS3/4A protease inhibitors, NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors, NS5A inhibitors, and host-directed antivirals, such as cyclophilin inhibitors. Alternative interferons with possibly improved tolerability, specifically interferon-\u03bb1 (interleukin-29), are also under development.

A 67-year-old female presented with progressively worsening abdominal pain and vomiting for 7 days. Home medications included rosuvastatin and clonidine. CT scan of abdomen, with intravenous contrast, showed findings consistent with acute pancreatitis. She responded to conservative management. Rosuvastatin was resumed at the time of discharge from the hospital, and she presented two months later with recurrence of acute pancreatitis. Further workup ruled out all likely causes of acute pancreatitis. Rosuvastatin was stopped completely when she was discharged the second time, and she did not have any further episodes of acute pancreatitis.

In 385 Chinese patients with hyperlipidemia who had been treated with rosuvastatin 10 mg daily for at least 4 weeks, the association between the FXR -1G>T SNP and lipid response to rosuvastatin was analyzed. The FXR -1G>T SNP was not associated with baseline lipids but was significantly associated with the LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol response to rosuvastatin. Carriers of the T-variant allele (GT+TT = 68+3) had 4.4% (95% CI: 1.2, 7.5%, P = 0.006) and 2.6% (95% CI: 0.3, 5.0%; P < 0.05) greater reductions in LDL-C and total cholesterol, respectively, compared with those with homozygous wild-type alleles. The association between the FXR polymorphism and the LDL-C response to rosuvastatin remained significant after adjusting for other covariants. This association of the variant allele of the FXR -1G>T polymorphism with a greater LDL-C response to rosuvastatin may suggest that this polymorphism influences the expression of the hepatic efflux transporters involved in biliary excretion of rosuvastatin.",

However, due to the significant side effects of statin medications, many patients seek alternative therapies to help manage their hypercholesterolemia. Red yeast rice (Monascus purpureus) has been used as a food and as an herbal medication in China for centuries. Phytosterols are foods that are similar in structure and function to animal cholesterol. Both of these compounds have been shown in clinical studies to significantly lower LDL cholesterol. We report on a case series of 18 patients with hypercholesterolemia despite therapeutic lifestyle change through diet and exercise who took a proprietary product combining red yeast rice and phytosterols as a powdered shake in an effort to improve their cholesterol indices. Statistically significant reduction (p < .05) in the following mean variables was seen: total cholesterol 19% (46 mg/dL) and LDL 33% (53 mg/dL) after 6 weeks using the blend. There was no significant difference in body mass index (BMI), triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, or systolic and diastolic blood pressure over the same period. This magnitude of reduction in LDL cholesterol is significantly greater than the 28% reduction observed in the 1999 Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) meta-analysis on the average effectiveness of statin medications in lowering cholesterol levels. None of the participants in our study reported any muscle pains, and no abnormal liver function tests were seen while taking the product. Though this case series is limited by small sample size, study duration, and lack of control group, the product's significant reduction in LDL cholesterol without severe side effects indicates that this product may be a clinically effective and well tolerated alternative treatment to using statin medications to treat hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "191": "The aetiology of colorectal cancer (CRC) remains elusive in the majority of cases. There is experimental evidence to show that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) may inhibit proliferation and induce cause apoptosis in CRC cells and although some clinical studies have suggested that statins may protect against the development of CRC, this has not been a consistent finding. Therefore we have examined any potential protective effects of statins by comparing statin use in patients with colorectal cancer against a control group.", 
    "192": "This was a case-control study examining statin use in symptomatic patients attending for diagnostic colonoscopy. Statin use was compared between patients with CRC and a control group, who had all had normal colonoscopy. Structured interviews and clinical records notes were used to determine drug exposure. Logistic regression was used to compare statin exposure and correct for confounding factors.", 
    "193": "There was a significant inverse association between previous statin use and a diagnosis of CRC (OR\u2009=\u20090.43 (95% confidence interval 0.25 - 0.80), p<0.01). This inverse association was stronger with higher statin doses (OR\u2009=\u20090.19 (0.07 - 0.47), p<0.01) and greater duration of statin use (statin use >years: OR\u2009=\u20090.18 (0.06 - 0.55), p<0.01).", 
    "194": "Statins use was associated with a protective effect against the development of CRC. This effect is associated with a significant dose and duration response. These findings need to be repeated in other observational studies before an interventional study can be considered.", 
    "195": "Previous studies in hypercholesterolemic patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) have demonstrated that lipid lowering therapy restores coronary endothelium dependent vasodilatation and increases myocardial perfusion. However, there is not enough data showing the effects of statins on myocardial perfusion in metabolic syndrome (MetS) patients who have perfusion abnormalities but not evident CAD, which are attributed to microvascular dysfunction. We aimed to evaluate whether or not statin therapy improves myocardial perfusion, as assessed by Technetium (Tc)-99m single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), in patients with MetS and angiographically normal epicardial coronary anatomy.", 
    "196": "The study population consisted of 55 selected patients (mean age: 52, 72% female) with MetS who have perfusion defect on exercise stress Tc-99m SPECT and normal coronary arteries. Patients were treated with 20 mg atorvastatin for six months regardless of baseline lipid levels and SPECT study was repeated after the therapy. The summed stress score (SSS), summed rest score (SRS) and summed difference score (SDS), and left ventricular (LV) volumes and ejection fractions (EF) at rest and stress were obtained.", 
    "197": "We found significant improvements in SSS, SRS and SDS after six months of statin therapy (p = 0.001, 0.001 and 0.002, respectively). In addition, end-diastolic volumes at rest and stress, and stroke volume at rest were significantly decreased (p = 0.001, 0.001 and 0.026, respectively). Also, LV EF at stress was significantly increased (p = 0.035).", 
    "198": "Statin therapy in patients with MetS who have perfusion defects on Tc-99m SPECT and normal coronary arteries produces significant improvements in myocardial perfusion abnormalities.", 
    "199": "The occurrence of Parkinson's disease (PD) is known to be associated both with increased nigrostriatal iron content and with low serum cholesterol and PD, but there has been no study to determine a potential relationship between these two factors.", 
    "200": "High-resolution MRI (T1-, T2, and multiple echo T2*-weighted imaging) and fasting lipid levels were obtained from 40 patients with PD and 29 healthy controls. Iron content was estimated from mean R2* values (R2* = 1/T2*) calculated for each nigrostriatal structure including substantia nigra, caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus. This was correlated with serum cholesterol levels after controlling for age, gender, and statin use.", 
    "201": "In patients with PD, higher serum cholesterol levels were associated with lower iron content in the substantia nigra (R = -0.43, p = 0.011 for total-cholesterol, R = -0.31, p = 0.080 for low-density lipoprotein) and globus pallidus (R = -0.38, p = 0.028 for total-cholesterol, R = -0.27, p = 0.127 for low-density lipoprotein), but only a trend toward significant association of higher total-cholesterol with lower iron content in the striatum (R = -0.34, p = 0.052 for caudate; R = -0.32, p = 0.061 for putamen). After adjusting for clinical measures, the cholesterol-iron relationships held or became even stronger in the substantia nigra and globus pallidus, but weaker in the caudate and putamen. There was no significant association between serum cholesterol levels and nigrostriatal iron content for controls.", 
    "202": "The data show that higher serum total-cholesterol concentration is associated with lower iron content in substantia nigra and globus pallidus in Parkinson's disease patients. Further studies should investigate whether this is mechanistic or epiphenomenological relationship.", 
    "203": "The objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of atorvastatin compared with simvastatin and pravastatin in patients of hyperlipidemia.", 
    "204": "This was a randomized, parallel group, open-label study conducted at KG hospital, Coimbatore, Tamilnadu, India. Twenty hyperlipidemia patients each taking atorvastatin 20 mg, pravastatin 20 mg and simvastatin 20 mg tablets were selected for the study after clinical and baseline investigations. The patients were reviewed after 3(rd) and 5(th) month of statin therapy for lipid profile. The liver enzyme levels (SGOT, SGPT, ALP), albumin, bilirubin, protein and biochemical infraction parameters (Creatine Kinase, Creatine Kinase - Myocardial Band) after 5(th) month of treatment with statins were also reviewed.", 
    "205": "The results showed that atorvastatin significantly reduced the lipid levels (LDL-C, TC, TG, VLDL) when compared to simvastatin and pravastatin after 3(rd) and 5(th) month of treatment. Atorvastatin increased the HDL-C levels significantly when compared to simvastatin and pravastatin after 5 months of treatment. Atorvastatin also significantly reduced the CK levels when compared to pravastatin but no increase in liver enzyme levels was observed.", 
    "206": "The study showed that atorvastatin is more effective when compared to simvastatin and pravastatin in patients with hyperlipidemia.", 
    "207": "Recent trials in cardiovascular medicine have contradicted current practice, and, accordingly, are medical reversals. Extended-release niacin and fenofibrate have failed to provide mortality benefit when added to statin therapy, though both drugs have been used for this purpose for years. Cardiovascular primary prevention is no small matter. Annual spending on statins exceeded $19 billion in 2005, ezetimibe cost over $5 billion in 2007, and fenofibrate costs passed $1 billion in 2009. Given the tremendous price of these medications, and recent trials that have undermined years of practice, we propose that the bar for cardiovascular primary prevention has been raised. Large studies must show improvements in overall mortality before novel agents are recommended and used. The implications of this proposal are considered."
