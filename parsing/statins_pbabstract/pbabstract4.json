    "0": "Congenital disorders of lipid metabolism are caused by a\u00a0wide range of variants of the genes for receptors, apolipoproteins, enzymes, transfer factors, and cellular cholesterol transporters. Clinically most relevant are autosomal dominant familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and familial combined hyperlipoproteinemia (FCHL). FH has a\u00a0prevalence of 1:250. It is due to mutations of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, less often to mutations of the apolipoprotein B (APOB), the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type\u00a09 (PCSK9), or the signal transducing adapter family member\u00a01 (STAP1). FH often leads to early atherosclerosis. Its diagnosis can definitely be made only by molecular genetic testing. The detection of mutations of the LDLR, APOB, or PCSK9 is an indicator for extremely high cardiovascular risk, independently of the concentration of LDL cholesterol. FCHL is also common (1:100) and is seen in about 10% of patients with early myocardial infarction. It is produced by combinations of frequent genetic variants affecting triglycerides and LDL cholesterol. Other monogenic hyperlipoproteinemias (HLP) affect the catabolism of chylomicrons (familial chylomicronemia) or of remnants of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (type\u00a0III hyperlipoproteinemia). Multiple hereditary disorders in HDL metabolism - with a broad spectrum of clinical significance - are known. Currently, second generation sequencing methods are used to simultaneously analyze multiple disease-causing genes. This approach cost-neutrally provides additional information such as the genetic risk of atherosclerosis and predisposition to statin intolerance.",

In the present study, we explore a possible role of the prenylated proteins on the statin-mediated PCSK9 induction in Caco-2 cells. Simvastatin (40\u03bcM) induced both PCSK9 mRNA (10.7\u00b13.2 fold) and protein (2.2\u00b10.3 fold), after 24h incubation. The induction of PCSK9 mRNA was partially, but significantly, prevented by the co-incubation with mevalonate (MVA), farnesol (FOH) and geranylgeraniol (GGOH), while a complete prevention was observed on secreted PCSK9, evaluated by ELISA assay. Under the same experimental conditions, MVA, GGOH, but not FOH, prevented the activation of the PCSK9 promoter by simvastatin in a SRE-dependent manner. Simvastatin reduced by -35.7\u00b115.2% the Rac1-GTP levels, while no changes were observed on RhoA- and Cdc42-GTP. This effect was prevented by MVA and GGOH. A Rac inhibitor, and N17Rac1 dominant negative mutant, significantly induced PCSK9 levels, and a suppression of Rac1 expression by siRNA, counteract the effect of simvastatin on the induction of PCSK9 mRNA. Finally, simvastatin, and Rac inhibitor inhibited the nuclear translocation of STAT3 and its knock-down by siRNA increased significantly the susceptibility of Caco-2 to simvastatin on PCSK9 expression. Taken together, the present study reveal a direct role of Rac1 on simvastatin-mediated PCSK9 expression via the reduction of STAT3 nuclear translocation.",

The risk of stroke is 5-30 times higher in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially on dialysis. Case fatality rates are also higher reaching almost 90%. It is therefore important to understand the factors that predispose to stroke in this vulnerable population to better apply preventive strategies. The heightened risk of stroke in CKD represents the interplay of the vascular co-morbidities that occur with renal impairment and factors specific to renal failure such as malnutrition-inflammation-atherosclerosis complex, the effect of uremic toxins, dialysis techniques, vascular access, and the use of anticoagulants to maintain flow in the extracorporeal circuit. Old age, hypertension, diabetes, and previous cerebrovascular disease are all risk factors for stroke with the period of dialysis initiation constituting the highest risk period for developing new stroke. Patients with CKD-stage 3-5 have worse survival and diminished functional outcomes following stroke. Thrombolytic therapy for stroke in CKD has shown an increased risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage or serious systemic hemorrhage, and the therapeutic effects may be attenuated. Benefit of statin therapy in dialysis patient as preventive therapy has not been shown to be beneficial. Control of hypertension and the judicious use of antiplatelet agents form the mainstay of stroke prevention. The benefit of antiplatelet therapies and oral anticoagulants has to be balanced against the real and increased risk of bleeding that is most evident in dialysis cohorts. An increased risk of vascular calcification particularly intracerebral vascular calcification has been seen in patientsreceiving warfarin as prophylaxis in atrial fibrillation. Newer anticoagulants have not been tested in patients with glomerular filtration rate <30 ml/min and hence have to be used with caution.

    "24": "An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an enlargement of the abdominal aorta. It is a common disease in the elderly, with a prevalence of 1-5%. An AAA is normally asymptomatic, and the diagnosis is often incidental, identified when a patient is examined for other conditions. The major risk of having an AAA is sudden rupture and death caused by massive hemorrhaging. As rupture risk increases with increasing AAA diameter, the current management strategies include regular imaging surveillance and elective repair before rupture occurs. Ruptured AAA (rAAA) carries high mortality, and an identification of a drug or compound with the potential to halt the growth of an AAA and/or reduce the risk of a rAAA is needed. Thus, the aims of this thesis were to examine the clinical impact of treatment with statins (Study I), reninangiotensin system (RAS) blockers (Study II), and low-dose aspirin (ASA)(Study III) on the risk of rAAA and case fatality following rAAA. The thesis is based on three nation-wide, combined case-control and follow-up studies using data from Danish population-based health-care and administrative registries. In Study I (1996-2008), we included 3,691 patients with an incident diagnosis of rAAA (cases). For the risk analyses, we matched 3,584 rAAA cases to 3,584 age- and sex-matched patients with an incident diagnosis of AAA (controls). Current statin use was associated with a lower risk of rAAA, adjusted odds ratio (OR): 0.73 (95% CI: 0.61;0.86), compared to never use of statins. Furthermore, current statin use was associated with a lower 30-day case fatality following rAAA, adjusted mortality rate ratio (MRR): 0.80 (95% CI: 0.68;0.95). In Study II (1996-2012), we identified 4,052 rAAA cases and 10,549 AAA controls. We were unable to demonstrate any association between the current use of either angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and the risk of rAAA, adjusted ORs: 0.96 (95% CI: 0.85;1.07) and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.79;1.09), respectively. The results were robust in supplemental propensity score matched analyses. Likewise, no association between current use of RAS-blockers and 30-day case fatality was found. In Study III (1996-2012), 4,055 rAAA cases were included. The adjusted OR for the risk of rAAA in ASA users compared to non-users was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.86;1.08). However, ASA use was associated with an unfavorable 30-day case fatality, adjusted MRR 1.17 (95% CI: 1.06;1.28), corresponding to an excessive rAAA case fatality in ASA users of nearly 20%. In conclusion, we found an approximately 25% lower risk of rAAA and 20% lower 30-day case fatality in statin-treated patients. Furthermore, we found an almost 20% higher 30-day case fatality following rAAA in ASA treated patients. No association between the use of RAS-blockers and the risk of rAAA or case fatality following rAAA was found. Similarly, we found no association between the use of ASA and the risk of rAAA.", 
    "25": "Response to drug administration is a primary determinant for treatment success. Sex and gender disparities play a role in determining the efficacy and safety of the most common used medications suggesting the need for a sex-tailored approach in prescription. Statins are a cost-effective strategy for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. While statins are similarly effective in secondary CVD prevention, some concerns raised by conflicting data reported in primary CVD prevention clinical trials. The small representation of women in clinical trials and the fewer rates of events due to the lower female baseline CVD risk may have conditioned contradictory meta-analysis findings. Specifically, benefits outweigh disadvantages of statin therapy in women with a high CVD risk, while several doubts exist for the primary prevention of women at low-intermediate CVD risk. Furthermore, disparities between women and men in medication adherence may influence statin efficacy in CVD prevention. The sex-dependent impact of adverse side effects is one of the reasons advocated for explaining the gender gap, but it's not evidence-proved. The present review summarizes the sex and gender differences in the use of statins, pointing out new perspectives and opening issues in sex-tailored CVD prevention strategy.",

Using a mouse model expressing KRAS(G12D) in the lung by nasal delivery of adenoviral Cre recombinase (Cre), here we show that KRAS(G12D) expression in lung-resident myeloid cells induces pulmonary LCH-like neoplasms composed of pathogenic CD11c(high)F4/80(+)CD207(+) cells. The pathogenic cells were mitotically inactive, but proliferating precursors were detected in primary cultures of lung tissue. These precursors were derived, at least in part, from CD11c(dim)CD11b(int)Gr1(-) lung-resident monocytic cells transformed by KRAS(G12D) In contrast, BRAF(V600E) expression induced by the same method failed to develop LCH-like neoplasms, suggesting that each oncogene may initiate pulmonary LCH by transforming different types of lung-resident myeloid cells.

English-language trials evaluating statins in PCOS were obtained and incorporated if they provided relevant data for providers. Results: We summarize twelve trials involving statins in PCOS. The trials were predominantly 12 weeks to 3 months in length (8 of the 12 trials) and low to moderate dose of statin drugs were used. The majority (10 of 12) of the trials show that statins reduce testosterone levels or other androgen hormones (DHEA-S and androstenedione), half of the trials evaluating LH/FSH ratio show an improvement, and all had positive effects on lipid profiles. Conclusion: Statins show promising improvements in serum levels of androgens and LH/FSH ratios translating to improved cardiovascular risk factors above and beyond simply lowering LDL levels.

It is currently unknown whether statins' neurological effects are lipid-dependent or due to pleiotropic mechanisms. Therefore, the assumption that all statin compounds will have the same effect within the central nervous system is potentially inappropriate, with no studies to date having compared all statins in a single model. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the effects of the six statins (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) within a single in vitro model of neuroinflammation. To achieve this, PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells were used as surrogate microglial cells, and LPS was used to induce inflammatory conditions. Here, we show that pretreatment with all statins was able to significantly reduce LPS-induced interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 release, as well as decrease LPS-induced prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Similarly, global reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) production were decreased following pretreatment with all statins. Based on these findings, it is suggested that more complex cellular models should be considered to further compare individual statin compounds, including translation into in vivo models of acute and/or chronic neuroinflammation.", 
    "47": "Excessive activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is implicated in cardiovascular diseases. Statins exert an anti-inflammatory effect independent of their cholesterol-lowering effect. This study investigated the potential role of statins in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in endothelial cells (ECs). Western blotting and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction showed that oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) or tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) activated the NLRP3 inflammasome in ECs. Simvastatin or mevastatin significantly suppressed the effects of ox-LDL or TNF\u03b1 Promoter reporter assays and small interfering RNA knockdown revealed that statins inhibit ox-LDL-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation via the pregnane X receptor (PXR). In addition, PXR agonists (rifampicin and SR12813) or overexpression of a constitutively active PXR markedly suppressed the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Conversely, PXR knockdown abrogated the suppressive effect of rifampicin on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Knockdown of lectin-like ox-LDL receptor or overexpression of I\u03baB\u03b1-attenuated ox-LDL- or TNF\u03b1-triggered activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that mevastatin inhibited nuclear factor-\u03baB binding to the promoter regions of the human NLRP3 gene. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the statin activation of PXR inhibits the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in response to atherogenic stimuli such as ox-LDL and TNF\u03b1 in ECs, providing a new mechanism for the cardiovascular benefit of statins.",

    "52": "A simple and efficient method for determination of the yield, enantiomeric/diasteriomeric excess (ee/de), and absolute configuration of crude chiral diols without the need of work-up and product isolation in a high throughput setting is described. This approach utilizes a self-assembled iminoboronate ester formed as a product by dynamic covalent self-assembly of a chiral diol with an enantiopure fluorescent amine such as tryptophan methyl ester or tryptophanol and 2-formylphenylboronic acid. The resulting diastereomeric boronates display different photophysical properties and allow for fluorescence-based ee determination of molecules containing a 1,2- or 1,3-diol moiety. This method has been utilized for the screening of ee in a number of chiral diols including atorvastatin, a statin used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Noyori asymmetric hydrogenation of benzil was performed in a highly parallel fashion with errors <1\u2009%\u2009ee confirming the feasibility of the systematic examination of crude products from the parallel asymmetric synthesis in real time and in a high-throughput screening (HTS) fashion.", 
    "53": "Advanced glycation endproduct (AGE)-induced vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production are emerging as important mechanisms of diabetic vasculopathy, but little is known about the molecular mechanism responsible for the antioxidative effects of statins on AGEs. It has been reported that statins exert pleiotropic effects on the cardiovascular system due to decreases in AGE-induced cell proliferation, migration, and vascular inflammation. Thus, in the present study, the authors investigated the molecular mechanism by which statins decrease AGE-induced cell proliferation and VSMC migration. In cultured VSMCs, statins upregulated Nrf2-related antioxidant gene, NQO1 and HO-1, via an ERK5-dependent Nrf2 pathway. Inhibition of ERK5 by siRNA or BIX02189 (a specific ERK5 inhibitor) reduced the statin-induced upregulations of Nrf2, NQO1, and HO-1. Furthermore, fluvastatin was found to significantly increase ARE promoter activity through ERK5 signaling, and to inhibit AGE-induced VSMC proliferation and migration as determined by MTT assay, cell counting, FACS analysis, a wound scratch assay, and a migration chamber assay. In addition, AGE-induced proliferation was diminished in the presence of Ad-CA-MEK5\u03b1 encoding a constitutively active mutant form of MEK5\u03b1 (an upstream kinase of ERK5), whereas depletion of Nrf2 restored statin-mediated reduction of AGE-induced cell proliferation. Moreover, fluvastatin suppressed the protein expressions of cyclin D1 and Cdk4, but induced p27, and blocked VSMC proliferation by regulating cell cycle. These results suggest statin-induced activation of an ERK5-dependent Nrf2 pathway reduces VSMC proliferation and migration induced by AGEs, and that the ERK5-Nrf2 signal module be viewed as a potential therapeutic target of vasculopathy in patients with diabetes and complications of the disease.",

We aimed to assess the association between several lipids and risk of venous thrombosis using data from a population-based case-control study, and to evaluate the underlying mechanism, considering confounding by common risk factors and mediation via hemostatic factors and C-reactive protein. From the Multiple Environmental and Genetic Assessment of risk factors for venous thrombosis (MEGA) study, 2234 patients with a first venous thrombosis and 2873 controls were included. Percentile categories of total/low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoproteins B and A1 were established in controls (<10th, 10th-25th, 25th-75th [reference], 75th-90th, >90th percentile). In age- and sex-adjusted models, decreasing levels of apolipoproteins B and A1 were dose-dependently associated with increased thrombosis risk, with odds ratios of 1.35 (95% confidence interval 1.12-1.62) and 1.50 (95% confidence interval 1.25-1.79) for the lowest category versus the reference category, respectively. The dose-response relation remained with further adjustment for body mass index, estrogen use, statin use, and diabetes. Although apolipoproteins B and A1 were associated with several hemostatic factors and C-reactive protein, none explained the increased risk in mediation analyses. The other lipids were not associated with venous thrombosis risk. In conclusion, decreasing levels of apolipoproteins B and A1 were associated with increased risk of venous thrombosis. Our findings are consistent with experimental data on the anticoagulant properties of apolipoproteins B and A1. These findings need to be confirmed and the underlying mechanism further investigated.",

On the other hand, in recent years, few inexpensive, broad-spectrum low-toxicity therapeutics have proven to be effective both in the preclinical and clinical settings. In early-stage CLL, the use of 2000 mg of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) from the green tea extract twice a day was able to reduce the absolute leukocyte count. Supplementation of >2000 IU/day of Vitamin D in early low-risk CLL patients is able to delay disease progression and postpone the moment of initiation of the first treatment. The doses of both vitamin D and EGCG were shown to be safe in older patients. Vitamin D, EGCG and Curcumin, either as monotherapy or in combination, have additive and synergistic effects with conventional chemotherapy. Further observations have identified the improvement of response to rituximab-fludarabine-cyclophosphamide (R-FC) therapy with concomitant administration of statin and aspirin combination in relapsed/refractory CLL. Finally, high dose dexamethasone with 40mg/m(2)/day for 4 days, every 28 days, either alone or with monoclonal antibody, might be used as a salvage therapy or for debulking before transplantation in refractory/resistant cases. Dexamethasone therapy is followed by transient response and high rate of infections, but fluid retention and other toxicities are lower compared to high dose methylprednisolone schedules.

The present subanalysis aimed to clarify the efficacy of combined use of warfarin and statins in patients with nonvalvular AF (NVAF) with coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus (DM), or hypertension. The effects of adding statins to warfarin were compared with those of warfarin alone in patients with NVAF with the data set of J-RHYTHM Registry, a prospective, observational study with a 2-year follow-up. End points included thromboembolism, major hemorrhage, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular mortality. Of 7,406 patients with NVAF and follow-up data, 6,404 patients received warfarin at baseline.

Interestingly, in patients with coronary artery disease or with hypertension, the addition of statin to warfarin did not decrease the frequency of thromboembolic events.

The primary end point was the major adverse cardiac event (MACE), defined as the composite of all-cause mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction, and repeated percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting. MACE occurred in 9.2% of the statin group versus 19.6% in the nonstatin group during the 12-month follow-up. Statin therapy significantly reduced the risk of MACE (hazard ratio [HR] 0.60, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.94, p\u00a0= 0.025) and coronary artery bypass grafting (HR 0.27, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.96, p\u00a0= 0.043).

Patients with diabetes and a history of ASCVD should be treated with high-dose statins. A combination of ezetimibe and a moderate-dose statin is an option for patients who cannot tolerate high-dose therapy.

These discoveries led to the rapid development of PSCK9-targeted monoclonal antibody (PCSK9 mAb) therapies and, in 2015, 2 'fully-humanized' PCSK9 mAbs (alirocumab and evolocumab) were marketed in the United States, Europe, and other countries. In a wide range of high risk patients, with and without ASCVD, these PCSK9 mAbs, as once or twice monthly subcutaneous injections, potently reduce LDL-C 50-65% beyond levels achieved by maximally tolerated statin therapy; approximately one-third of patients achieve LDL-C levels <25 mg/dL. In the US, PCSK9 mAb therapy has current limited indications for persons with ASCVD or familial hypercholesterolemia requiring additional LDL-C reduction beyond maximally tolerated statin therapy. The first of the ASCVD outcomes-driven trials, the FOURIER trial has very recently shown in over 27,000 subjects randomized to evolocumab or placebo on top of moderate or high intensity statin therapy, a 15% risk reduction in the primary and 20% reduction in the secondary outcome over 2.2 years of treatment. Also of interest in patients with coronary artery disease on statin therapies, once-monthly evolocumab treatment, for only 76 weeks, resulted in significant plaque atheroma volume regression, as assessed by serial intravascular ultrasonography imaging, in approximately two-thirds of treated patients. Finally, in development is a highly durable RNA interference therapeutic inhibitor of PCSK9 synthesis which from a single dosage has been shown to maintain, for 6 months, a 75% reduction in PCSK9 levels and 50% reductions in LDL-C levels.

    "97": "Examination of the current the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society (ESC/EAS) guidelines on the prevention of cardiovascular disease and the management of dyslipidemias finds much common ground. Both note that Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is, in most people, the product of a number of risk factors, notably tobacco exposure, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, inactivity, overweight and diabetes. They stress that risk calculators can help in the assessment of risk in apparently healthy persons. Persons with established ASCVD and many with diabetes or renal impairment are at high to very high risk and warrant intensive risk factor advice and guideline-based preventive therapies. The ACC/AHA guidelines favor the universal use of statins in all high-risk subjects and in primary prevention where the global risk exceeds 7.5% in 10 years, with a percentage reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) based on statin intensity as the \"goal\". In contrast, the ESC/EAS guidelines favor a goal or percentage-based reduction in LDL-C based on total risk and baseline LDL-C level. Both guidelines consider certain imaging and other measures to stratify risk as well as the use of non-statin therapies in those not achieving recommended targets. Perhaps the most important challenges are to stress similarities rather than differences, and to simplify communications with both healthcare professionals and the public.",

A number of clinical trials suggest that treatment with a fibrate may reduce cardiovascular events. However, the results of these trials are inconsistent, probably because many of their participants did not have dyslipidemia. The choice of medications used to treat diabetes can have major implications regarding management of dyslipidemia; metformin, GLP-1 agonists, and pioglitazone all have favorable lipid effects. These agents, as well as the new SGLT2 inhibitors, may reduce cardiovascular events. Management of dyslipidemia in people with type 2 diabetes should start with statin therapy and optimal glycemic control with agents that have favorable lipid and cardiovascular effects. We believe that there is a role for adding fenofibrate to moderate-intensity statins in selected patients with true dyslipidemia. We propose an algorithm for selecting add-on medications for diabetes (after metformin) based on lipid status.",

Reducing low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and raising high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) have been the therapeutic targets to reduce the risk of ASCVD. Cholesterol-lowering medications have been used to provide both primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD for many years by reducing the absorption and reabsorption, promoting excretion, or decreasing the synthesis of cholesterol. Within the past five years, several new classes of cholesterol-lowering drugs have been tested and approved for patients with hypercholesterolemia that are not well controlled by conventional therapy (ezetimibe, bile-acid sequestrants, and statins). These drugs include proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) antibodies, apolipoprotein A-100 (Apo B-100) antisense, and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) inhibitor. Clinical trials revealed that adding PCSK9 antibodies to the preexisting statin therapy can further reduce LDL-C by 60%. ApoB antisense and MTP inhibitor are currently approved for patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Several HDL-raising drugs have also been tested, but the results are not promising. Studies suggest that specifically raising reverse cholesterol transport rather than HDL-C level could be a novel therapeutic approach to reduce cardiovascular risk.",

Setting Outpatient cardiology specialty clinics located in main Lebanese cities. Methods This is a retrospective crosssectional study. Eligible patients were those who had established CAD, treated with statins and having complete follow-up lipid panel at least 3\u00a0months from statin prescription. The following statin prescription strategies were considered in data analysis: prescription of different intensity statin as monotherapy, prescription of a statin in combination with: a low fat diet, another lipid-altering agent and another lipidaltering agent plus a low fat diet. Main outcome measure LDL-C goal attainment for each of the statin prescription strategy. Results Of the 423 CAD statin-treated patients, only 38.5 and 36.6% attained their recommended LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals, respectively. Using a statin in combination with ezetimibe or with another lipid-altering agent plus a low fat diet were significantly associated with LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals attainment. Conclusion Improvement of statin prescription strategies, such as using regular and scheduled dosage of high-intensity statins and combining statin therapy with ezetimibe, is therefore required when managing patients with CAD.",

It is closely related to the epidemic of obesity, metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). NAFLD can cause liver inflammation and progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis or hepatocellular cancer (HCC). Nevertheless, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of death in NAFLD/NASH patients. Current guidelines suggest the use of pioglitazone both in patients with T2DM and in those without. The use of statins, though considered safe by the guidelines, have very limited use; only 10% in high CVD risk patients are on statins by tertiary centers in the US. There are data from several animal studies, 5 post hoc analyses of prospective long-term survival studies, and 5 rather small biopsy proven NASH studies, one at baseline and on at the end of the study. All these studies provide data for biochemical and histological improvement of NAFLD/NASH with statins and in the clinical studies large reductions in CVD events in comparison with those also on statins and normal liver. Ezetimibe was also reported to improve NAFLD. Drugs currently in clinical trials seem to have potential for slowing down the evolution of NAFLD and for reducing liver- and CVD-related morbidity and mortality, but it will take time before they are ready to be used in everyday clinical practice. The suggestion of this Expert Panel is that, pending forthcoming randomized clinical trials, physicians should consider using a PPARgamma agonist, such as pioglitazone, or, statin use in those with NAFLD/NASH at high CVD or HCC risk, alone and/or preferably in combination with each other or with ezetimibe, for the primary or secondary prevention of CVD, and the avoidance of cirrhosis, liver transplantation or HCC, bearing in mind that CVD is the main cause of death in NAFLD/NASH patients.",

Thus, the present study aimed to broaden this finding under hypoxic conditions induced by incubation of B16.F10 cells with cobalt chloride, when the constitutive production of HIF-1\u03b1 in these melanoma cells is amplified by inducible expression of this factor. The data demonstrated that the SIM antiproliferative effects on melanoma cells were mediated mainly via strong suppressive actions on the B16.F10 cell capacity to support tumor angiogenesis and inflammation, as a result of a high inhibition of the inducible expression of HIF-1\u03b1. However, the constitutive expression of HIF-1\u03b1 was not affected by SIM, probably due to the lack of effect of this statin on nuclear factor-\u03baB production in B16.F10 cancer cells at the concentration tested. Additionally, the present study noted slight reducing effects of SIM on tumor oxidative stress, which may contribute to the main inhibitory action of this statin on HIF-1\u03b1 production in hypoxic tumor cells.

Hepatoprotectant was used as a surrogate marker for elevated serum alanine transaminase (ALT). After adjusting for age, gender, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, gout, statin use, metformin use and aspirin use, elevated ALT was independently associated with an increased HCC risk [hazard ratio (HR) 6.80, 95% CI: 3.00-15.42; p\u2009<\u20090.001]. Multivariate stratified analysis verified this association in all subgroups (HR> 1.0).

Therefore, we estimated GFR in 18,015 individuals from the IMPROVE-IT (ezetimibe plus simvastatin versus simvastatin alone in individuals with cardiovascular disease and creatinine clearance >30 ml/min) and examined post hoc the relationship of eGFR with end points across treatment arms. For the primary end point of cardiovascular death, major coronary event, or nonfatal stroke, the relative risk reduction of combination therapy compared with monotherapy differed by eGFR (P=0.04). The difference in treatment effect was observed at eGFR\u226475 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) and most apparent at levels \u226460 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) Compared with individuals receiving monotherapy, individuals receiving combination therapy with a baseline eGFR of 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) experienced a 12% risk reduction (hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.82 to 0.95); those with a baseline eGFR of 45 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) had a 13% risk reduction (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.98). In stabilized individuals within 10 days of acute coronary syndrome, combination therapy seemed to be more effective than monotherapy in individuals with moderately reduced eGFR (30-60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)).

However, the benefit of this approach to prevent major adverse cardiovascular events has been demonstrated in only one randomised, placebo controlled trial. The Myocardial Ischemia Reduction with Aggressive Cholesterol Lowering (MIRACL) trial demonstrated that atorvastatin 80 mg daily, compared with placebo, reduced time to first occurrence of death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or hospitalisation for unstable angina (stroke not included) during the 16 week period following ACS. However, there were no significant effects on individual components of the composite endpoint except unstable angina. This led some to question whether early, intensive statin treatment reduces 'hard' events after ACS. Aim The burden of coronary heart disease after ACS, and therefore the efficacy of its treatment, depends not only on the occurrence of one ischaemic event, but rather on cumulative events experienced by patients. Accordingly, we conducted a post-hoc analysis of the MIRACL trial to examine the effect of atorvastatin on first as well as recurrent (i.e. total) hard cardiovascular events after ACS (death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and resuscitated cardiac arrest). Methods and Results In the 3086 patients who comprised the MIRACL trial, atorvastatin 80\u2009mg did not reduce time to first hard event compared with placebo (hazard ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.72-1.10, P\u2009=\u20090.27). However, atorvastatin significantly reduced total hard events (hazard ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.66-0.97, P\u2009=\u20090.03). To prevent one hard event during the 16 weeks following ACS, only 11 patient-years of treatment with atorvastatin were required. Conclusion Early, intensive treatment with atorvastatin is an efficient intervention to reduce hard cardiovascular events after ACS.",

    "252": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of atorvastatin on the bone formation and resorption markers in ovariectomized rats (experimental study), and to study its effect on the bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal osteoporotic women (clinical study).", 
    "253": "The study involved experimental and clinical aspects. In the experimental aspect, 42 female Wistar rats were divided into five groups: Group I (n=6; sham-operated), Group II (n=6; 1 mL of carboxymethyl cellulose [CMC] was administered orally), Group III (n=6; 20 mg/kg orally of atorvastatin was administered), Group IV (n=12; untreated ovariectomized [OVX] rats and served as a model of osteoporosis [OP]) and Group V (n=12; 20 mg/kg orally of atorvastatin was administered to ovariectomized rats). After 4 weeks, serum acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, total calcium and inorganic phosphorus were assessed. Then, 3 \u00b5m thickness lumbar and femur sections were examined using a light microscope to assess cortical thickness, trabecular area, numbers of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. In the clinical aspect, 85 post-menopausal osteoporotic females with recently detected hyperlipidemia participated in the study. Atorvastatin 40 mg/day, calcium carbonate 500 mg/day and vitamin D 800 international units were given to all patients for a period of 18 months. BMD was measured at the start and at the end of the study by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).", 
    "254": "In the experiment aspect, the biomarkers of bone remodeling were notably elevated in the OVX group. Administration of atorvastatin produced a significant decrease in the level of these bone metabolic markers. Atorvastatin significantly ameliorates osteoporotic changes induced by ovariectomy. In the clinical aspect, after 18 months the DEXA showed improvement in the T-score for the three measured zones; however, these changes were statistically significant only in the femoral neck area.", 
    "255": "Atorvastatin was able to decrease the rate of bone metabolism and increase osteogenic activity. It has dual mode of action; both anabolic and antiresorptive effect on bone. This lipophilic statin member may act as a double weapon drug.", 
    "256": "The prevalence estimates of statin eligibility among Hispanic/Latinos living in the United States under the new 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) cholesterol treatment guidelines are not known.", 
    "257": "We estimated prevalence of statin eligibility under 2013 ACC/AHA and 3rd National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel\u00a0(NCEP/ATP III) guidelines among Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (n=16\u00a0415; mean age 41\u00a0years, 40% males) by using sampling weights calibrated to the 2010 US census. We examined the characteristics of Hispanic/Latinos treated and not treated with statins under both guidelines. We also redetermined the statin-therapy eligibility by using black risk estimates for Dominicans, Cubans, Puerto Ricans, and Central Americans. Compared with NCEP/ATP III guidelines, statin eligibility increased from 15.9% (95% CI 15.0-16.7%) to 26.9% (95% CI 25.7-28.0%) under the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines. This was mainly driven by the \u22657.5% atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk criteria (prevalence 13.9% [95% CI 13.0-14.7%]). Of the participants eligible for statin eligibility under NCEP/ATP III and ACC/AHA guidelines, only 28.2% (95% CI 26.3-30.0%) and 20.6% (95% CI 19.4-21.9%) were taking statins, respectively. Statin-eligible participants who were not taking statins had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors compared with statin-eligible participants who were taking statins. There was no significant increase in statin eligibility when atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk was calculated by using black estimates instead of recommended white estimates (increase by 1.4%, P=0.12) for Hispanic/Latinos.", 
    "258": "The eligibility of statin therapy increased consistently across all Hispanic/Latinos subgroups under the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines and therefore will potentially increase the number of undertreated Hispanic/Latinos in the United States.", 
    "259": "Cholesterol-lowering statins have been postulated to improve cancer outcomes by many unconfirmed mechanisms. The prognosis of glioblastoma (GBM) remains dismal, and there is a paucity of evidence regarding the potential for preoperative statins to exert a benefit upon prognosis. In light of a recent report, the current evidence in the literature regarding statin use affecting GBM prognosis is discussed.", 
    "260": "Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the more aggressive form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NASH can progress to hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, portal hypertension and primary liver cancer. Therapy is evolving with a substantial number of trials of promising new agents now in progress. In this article however, we will examine data for several older forms of therapy which have been fairly extensively studied over the years: Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid (PUFA) supplements, vitamin E, insulin sensitizing agents with a focus on pioglitazone and statin agents. Early interest in PUFA derived from their potential benefit in cardio-metabolic disease and the close association of NAFLD/NASH with Metabolic Syndrome. Results have been variable although most studies show reduction of liver fat without other major effects and their effects are influenced by concomitant weight loss and underlying genetic factors. Vitamin E has had some efficacy in pediatric NASH but questionable efficacy in even mild NASH among adults. Pioglitazone has shown significant histological benefit in a number of trials but concern over side-effects (especially weight gain) have dampened enthusiasm. A newer insulin sensitizer, liraglutide, has also shown promise in a small randomized, controlled trial. Very limited data exists regarding the histological effects of the statins in NASH and these agents appear to be fairly neutral with neither clear cut benefit nor detriment. Their use is best guided by cardiovascular risks rather than liver histology.", 
    "261": "In indexed literature, a systematic review of the efficacy of statins in enhancing osseointegration is lacking. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy of local and systemic statin delivery on the osseointegration of implants.", 
    "262": "To address the focused question, \"Does local and systemic statin delivery affect osseointegration around implants?\", indexed databases were searched from 1965 through November 2015 using various keywords. Letters to the Editor, case reports/case series, historic reviews, and commentaries were excluded. The pattern of this systematic review was customized to primarily summarize the pertinent data.", 
    "263": "Nineteen studies were included. All studies were experimental and were performed in animal models. In seven studies, statins were delivered systemically via oral, intraperitoneal, intraosseous, subcutaneous, and percutaneous routes. Among the 12 studies, where statins were delivered locally, statin-coated implants were used in seven studies, whereas in the remaining studies, statins were delivered via topical application on the bone cavities. The follow-up duration ranged between 1 and 12 weeks. Results from 18 studies showed that statin administration enhanced new bone formation (NBF) around implants and/or bone-to-implant contact. One study showed that statin-coated implant surfaces impaired osseointegration. Seven studies reported that statin administration enhanced NBF around implants in osteoporotic rats.", 
    "264": "On experimental grounds, local and systemic statin delivery seems to enhance osseointegration; however, from a clinical perspective, further studies are needed to assess the role of statins in promoting osseointegration around dental implants.", 
    "265": "Statin therapy is a cornerstone of cardiovascular disease risk reduction for people with diabetes mellitus. Past reports have shown race-sex differences in statin use in general populations, but statin patterns by race and sex in those with diabetes mellitus have not been thoroughly studied.", 
    "266": "Our sample of 4288 adults \u226545\u00a0years of age with diagnosed diabetes mellitus who had low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) >100\u00a0mg/dL or were taking statins recruited for the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study from 2003 to 2007. Exposures included race-sex groups (white men [WM], black men [BM], white women [WW], black women [BW]) and factors that may influence healthcare utilization. Proportions and prevalence ratios were calculated for statin use and LDL-C control. Statin use for WM, BM, WW, and BW was 66.0%, 57.8%, 55.0%, and 53.6%, respectively (P<0.001). After adjustment for healthcare utilization factors, statin use was lower for BM, WW, and BW compared with WM (prevalence ratios [95%CI]: 0.96 [0.89-1.03], 0.86 [0.80-0.92], and 0.87 [0.81-0.93], respectively, P<0.001). LDL-C control among those taking statins for WM, BM, WW, and BW was 75.3%, 62.7%, 69.0%, and 56.0%, respectively (P<0.001). After adjustment, LDL-C control was lower for BM, WW, and BW compared with WM (prevalence ratios [95%CI]: 0.85 [0.79-0.93], 0.89 [0.82-0.96], and 0.73 [0.67-0.80], respectively, P<0.001).", 
    "267": "Race-sex disparities in statin use and LDL-C control were only partly explained by factors influencing health services utilization. Healthcare provider awareness of these disparities may help to close the observed race-sex gaps in statin use and LDL-C control among people with diabetes mellitus."
