It has been suggested that statins may be a potential treatment during the next influenza pandemic. In a previous study we found that a statin/caffeine combination protects BALB/c mice against Influenza A, subtypes haemagglutinin type 5 and neuraminidase type 1 (H5N1), H3N2 and H1N1 infection. The effect of statins alone on influenza virus infection, however, is not known. In this study, it was investigated whether fluvastatin is capable of inhibiting influenza A virus replication in vitro. The results demonstrated that the synthesis of viral RNA and protein was affected by fluvastatin treatment. Virus production was markedly reduced when fluvastatin was administered simultaneously with the virus; however, a greater inhibition was observed when fluvastatin was added following viral adsorption. The selectivity index [SI; 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50)/50% inhibition concentration (IC50)], however, was only 21. It was further demonstrated that fluvastatin protects host cells against influenza-induced inflammation by reducing the production of tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin 8 and interferon \u03b3. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that fluvastatin exerted a minor inhibitory effect on influenza virus infection, which involved anti-inflammatory activities.",

    "5": "Of late, solid self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (S-SNEDDS) have been extensively sought-after owing to their superior portability, drug loading, stability and patient compliance. The current studies, therefore, entail systematic development, optimization and evaluation (in vitro, in situ and in vivo) of the solid formulations of (SNEDDS) lovastatin employing rational quality by design (QbD)-based approach of formulation by design (FbD). The patient-centric quality target product profile (QTPP) and critical quality attributes (CQAs) were earmarked. Preformulation studies along with initial risk assessment facilitated the selection of lipid (i.e. Capmul MCM), surfactant (i.e. Nikkol HCO-50) and co-surfactant (i.e. Lutrol F127) as CMAs for formulation of S-SNEDDS. A face-centered cubic design (FCCD) was employed for optimization using Nikkol-HCO50 (X1) and Lutrol-F127 (X2), evaluating CQAs like globule size, liquefaction time, emulsification time, MDT, dissolution efficiency and permeation parameter. The design space was generated using apt mathematical models, and the optimum formulation was located, followed by validation of the FbD methodology. In situ SPIP and in vivo pharmacodynamic studies on the optimized formulation carried out in unisex Wistar rats, corroborated superior drug absorption and enhanced pharmacodynamic potential in regulating serum lipid levels. In a nutshell, the present studies report successful QbD-oriented development of novel oral S-SNEDDS of lovastatin with distinctly improved biopharmaceutical performance.", 
    "6": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in Western countries with up to 30% of the population affected. Since NAFLD is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease, these patients should be stratified for CV risk factors, including atherogenic dyslipidemia, and managed accordingly. Lifestyle modifications represent an effective treatment for NAFLD, since most patients are overweight or obese. Also, promising, but not conclusive, results are available for current pharmacologic treatment. Drugs potentially effective against NAFLD include insulin sensitisers as well as fibrates and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, while there is reluctance to use statins in patients with suspected or established chronic liver disease. Several other therapeutic options are potentially available, and more data are expected from new peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists and incretin-based therapies.",

    "8": "Uric acid has ever been considered as one of contrast induced acute kidney injury's risk factors. Atorvastatin and probucol can both improve contrast induced acute kidney injury separately. This prospective study is to assess their effect on reducing serum uric acid level and contrast induced acute kidney injury during perioperative period of interventional procedure. On the basis of different doses of atorvastatin and probucol, 208 cases admitted for coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention were randomly classified into standard combined group (S-C group), intensive combined group (I-C group), and intensive atorvastatin group (I-A group). Patients' blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and serum uric acid were measured and estimated glomerular filtration rate was evaluated 24 hours before and after the procedure. After procedure, blood urea nitrogen in all the three groups decreased; Scr of S-C group and I-A group increased significantly, while estimated glomerular filtration decreased in the S-C group (P < 0.05); serum uric acid in S-C group and I-C group decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Combination treatment of atorvastatin and probucol before intervention could reduce perioperative serum uric acid level; meanwhile, the intensive combined treatment can improve the contrast induced acute kidney injury. The result was the same for hypertensive patients.", 
    "9": "Atorvastatin is eliminated by CYP3A4 which follows carrier-mediated uptake into hepatocytes by OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OATP2B1. Multiple clinical studies demonstrated that OATP inhibition by rifampin had a greater impact on atorvastatin systemic concentration than itraconazole-mediated CYP3A4 inhibition. If it is assumed that the blood and hepatocyte compartments are differentiated by the concentration gradient that is established by OATPs, and if the rate of uptake into the hepatocyte is rate-determining to the elimination of atorvastatin from the body, then it is hypothesized that blood concentrations may not necessarily reflect liver concentrations. In wild-type mice, rifampin had a greater effect on systemic exposure of atorvastatin than ketoconazole, as the blood area under the blood concentration-time curve increased 7- and 2-fold, respectively. In contrast, liver concentrations were affected more by ketoconazole than by rifampin, as liver levels increased 21- and 4-fold, respectively. Similarly, in Cyp3a knockout animals, 39-fold increases in liver concentrations were observed despite insignificant changes in the blood area under the blood concentration-time curve. Interestingly, blood and liver levels in Oatp1a/b knockout animals were similar to wild types, suggesting that Oatp1a/b knockout may be necessary but not sufficient to completely describe atorvastatin uptake in mice. Data presented in this work indicate that there is a substantial drug interaction when blocking atorvastatin metabolism, but the effects of this interaction are predominantly manifested in the liver and may not be captured when monitoring changes in the systemic circulation. Consequently, there may be a disconnect when trying to relate blood exposure to instances of hepatotoxicity because a pharmacokinetic-toxicity relationship may not be obvious from blood concentrations.", 
    "10": "The present study describes the enhanced production and purification of lovastatin by Aspergillus terreus in submerged batch fermentation. The enhancement of lovastatin production from A. terreus was attempted by random mutagenesis using ultraviolet radiations and nitrous acid. UV mutants exhibited increased efficiency for lovastatin production as compared with nitrous acid mutants. Among all the mutants developed, A. terreus UV-4 was found to be the hyper producer of lovastatin. This mutant gave 3.5-fold higher lovastatin production than the wild culture of A. terreus NRRL 265. Various cultural conditions were also optimized for hyper-producing mutant strain. 5 % glucose as carbon source, 1.5 % corn steep liquor as nitrogen source, initial pH value of 6, 120 h of incubation period, and 28 \u00b0C of incubation temperature were found as best parameters for higher lovastatin production in shake flasks. Production of lovastatin by wild and mutant strains of A. terreus was also scaled up to laboratory scale fermentor. The fermentation process was conducted at 28 \u00b0C, 200 rpm agitation, and 1vvm air flow rate without pH control. After the optimization of cultural conditions in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks and scaling up to laboratory scale fermentor, the mutant A. terreus UV-4 gave eightfold higher lovastatin production (3249.95 \u03bcg/ml) than its production by wild strain in shake flasks. Purification of lovastatin was carried out by solvent extraction method which yielded 977.1 mg/l of lovastatin with 98.99 % chromatographic purity and 26.76 % recovery. The crystal structure of lovastatin was determined using X-ray diffraction analysis which is first ever reported.",

    "16": "The enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CoA-R) is the fundamental target for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia nowadays. The HMG-CoA-R clinical active site inhibitors (statins) are among the most widespread and profitable drugs ever sold but their side effects (myopathies, sometimes severe) still limit their use, which makes the finding of alternatives to statins a field of intense research. In this line, we address here a new strategy for inhibiting the homotetrameric HMG-CoA-R. The enzyme consists of a \"dimer of dimers\", each dimer having two active sites. We pursue here the inhibition of enzyme oligomerization, through drug binding to the dimer interface. We have computationally mutated 232 interfacial residues by alanine and calculated the loss in binding free energy among the monomers that build up each dimer of the homotetramer. This led to the identification of the (ten) key residues for the formation of the active dimer (Glu528, Ile531, Met534, Tyr644, Glu665, Asn686, Lys692, Lys735, Met742, and Val863). The results show that these residues are located in two specific spots of the protein with a cleft shape, whose shape and size is favorable for small drug binding. It is expectable that small molecules specifically bound to these druggable pockets will have a major effect on the oligomerization of the protein or/and in active site formation. This paves the way for the discovery of new families of inhibitors of HMG-CoA-R.",

    "23": "Endothelial injury and dysfunction precede accelerated arterial disease in allograft vasculopathy and systemic autoimmune diseases and involve pathogenic Abs and complement. Recent reports suggest that switching to rapamycin from calcineurin antagonists reduces posttransplant vasculopathy and prolongs survival following cardiac transplantion. The majority of these patients also receive statin therapy. We examined potential mechanisms underlying this protective response in human endothelial cells and identified synergy between rapamycin and atorvastatin. Mechanistically, atorvastatin and rapamycin activated a protein kinase C\u03b1, AMP-activated kinase, and CREB-dependent vasculoprotective pathway, which induced decay-accelerating factor (DAF) promoter activity via binding to the cAMP response element, mutation of which attenuated promoter activity. This response significantly increased endothelial cell surface DAF and enhanced protection against complement-mediated injury. Synergy with rapamycin was reproduced by simvastatin, whereas combining atorvastatin with cyclosporine or mycophenolate in place of rapamycin was ineffective. Importantly, synergy was reproduced in vivo, in which only atorvastatin and rapamycin therapy in combination was sufficient to induce DAF on murine aortic endothelium. We believe this pathway represents an important therapeutically inducible vasculoprotective mechanism for diseases mediated by pathogenic Abs and complement, including posttransplant vasculopathy and systemic lupus erythematosus. Although our study focuses on the vascular endothelium, the findings are likely to be broadly applicable, given the diverse cellular expression of DAF.",

After 8 weeks treatment, mice with dilated cardiomyopathy developed serious cardiac dysfunction characterized by significantly enhanced left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVIDd), decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) as well as left ventricular short axis fractional shortening (LVFS), accompanied with enlarged cardiomyocytes, and increased plasma levels of N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and plasma angiotensin II (AngII) concentration. Moreover, myocardium sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump (SERCA-2) activity was decreased. The ratio of phosphorylated phospholamban (PLB) to total PLB decreased significantly with the down-regulation of SERCA- -2a and ryanodine receptor (RyR2) expression. Pitavastatin was found to ameliorate the cardiac dysfunction in mice with dilated cardiomyopathy by reversing the changes in the ratios of phosphorylated PLB to total PLB, SERCA-2a and RyR2 via reducing the plasma AngII concentration and the expressions of myocardium angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and protein kinase C (PKC)b2. The possible underlying mechanism might be the regulation of myocardial AT1R-PKCb2-Ca2+ handling proteins.", 
    "29": "We recently proposed that mitotic asynchrony in repairing tissue may underlie chronic inflammation and fibrosis, where immune cell infiltration is secondary to proinflammatory cross-talk among asynchronously repairing adjacent tissues. Building on our previous finding that mitotic asynchrony is associated with proinflammatory/fibrotic cytokine secretion (e.g., transforming growth factor [TGF]-\u03b21), here we provide evidence supporting cause-and-effect. Under normal conditions, primary airway epithelial basal cell populations undergo mitosis synchronously and do not secrete proinflammatory or profibrotic cytokines. However, when pairs of nonasthmatic cultures were mitotically synchronized at 12 hours off-set and then combined, the mixed cell populations secreted elevated levels of TGF-\u03b21. This shows that mitotic asynchrony is not only associated with but is also causative of TGF-\u03b21 secretion. The secreted cytokines and other mediators from asthmatic cells were not the cause of asynchronous regeneration; synchronously mitotic nonasthmatic epithelia exposed to conditioned media from asthmatic cells did not show changes in mitotic synchrony. We also tested if resynchronization of regenerating asthmatic airway epithelia reduces TGF-\u03b21 secretion and found that pulse-dosed dexamethasone, simvastatin, and aphidicolin were all effective. We therefore propose a new model for chronic inflammatory and fibrotic conditions where an underlying factor is mitotic asynchrony.", 
    "30": "Interindividual variability exists in statin lipid-lowering response, partially attributed to genetic factors. Organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) encoded by SLCO1B1 gene (solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1) facilitates hepatic uptake of simvastatin and atorvastatin. SLCO1B1 polymorphisms are strongly associated with statin-induced myopathy whereas few studies have assessed their effect on statin differential response. In the present study, we analyzed the association of SLCO1B1 521T>C, 388A>G and 411G>A polymorphisms with response to atorvastatin and simvastatin in 386 adults (201 atorvastatin-treated and 185 simvastatin-treated) with primary hypercholesterolemia, all of Greek origin. Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were measured at baseline and on 6 months of treatment. Genetic polymorphisms were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. A novel RFLP protocol was developed for the simultaneous identification of 388A>G and 411G>A polymorphisms. SLCO1B1 521T>C, 388A>G and 411G>A polymorphisms were not associated with lipid-lowering response to atorvastatin or simvastatin. No sex-gene or statin dose-gene interaction was observed on the effect of the analyzed SLCO1B1 polymorphisms in statin lipid lowering response in either statin-treated patient cohort. Further studies in different populations are required to draw firm conclusion on the potential association of SLCO1B1 polymorphisms with statin lipid-lowering response.",

A follow up of 213 subjects with repeated ABP after an average 1.8 years identified that baseline cholesterol was the only predictor for an increasing RoR and BP(power) (P<0.05). 37 patients who commenced statin subsequently had lower BP(power) whereas 90 age and weight matched controls had similar BP(power) on follow-up.",

    "35": "Despite undisputed success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the therapy of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), development of drug resistance and inability to cure the disease challenge clinicians and researchers. Additionally, recent reports regarding cardiovascular toxicities of second and third generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors prove that there is still a place for novel therapeutic combinations in CML. We have previously shown that statins are able to modulate activity of chemotherapeutics or antibodies used in oncology. Therefore, we decided to verify that statins are able to potentiate antileukemic activity of imatinib, still a frontline treatment of CML. Lovastatin, a cholesterol lowering drug, synergistically potentiates antileukemic activity of imatinib in cell lines and in primary CD34+\u00a0CML cells from patients in different phases of the disease, including patients resistant to imatinib with no detectable mutations. This effect is related to increased intracellular concentration of imatinib in CD34+\u00a0CML cells and cell lines measured using uptake of (14)C-labeled imatinib. Lovastatin does not influence influx but significantly inhibits efflux of imatinib mediated by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters: ABCB1 and ABCG2. The addition of cholesterol completely reverses these effects. Statins do not affect expression of ABCB1 and ABCG2 genes. The effects are drug-class specific, as observed with other statins. Our results suggest that statins may offer a valuable addition to imatinib in a select group of CML patients.",

Obesity is the predominant underlying risk factor for the metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus. This study investigated whether change in body weight may predict NODM in statin-treated patients. A total of 7,595 patients without prevalent diabetes mellitus at baseline from the Treating to New Targets (TNT) study were included in this analysis. They were randomized to atorvastatin 10 or 80 mg/day and monitored for a median of 4.9 years. NODM developed in 659 patients (8.1% in the 10-mg group and 9.2% in the 80-mg group). There was a significant increase in body weight (0.9 kg, p <0.01 in both men and women) over 1 year after randomization. The increase in body weight was greater in patients with NODM than those without NODM (1.6 vs 0.9 kg, p <0.001). The association of change in body weight with NODM risk remained significant after adjusting for confounding factors (hazard ratios 1.33, 1.42, and 1.88 for quartiles 2, 3, and 4 compared with quartile 1, respectively). Similar results were obtained in patients with normal fasting glucose level.

Among all causes of dementia, vascular dementia (VaD) is the one type that is more likely to benefit from statins. To date no randomized clinical trials have been published and no systematic review has investigated a possible preventive effect of statins on the VaD subtype. In the present literature review, we tried to identify all available data on the effect of statins specifically in patients with VaD, and to further discuss this possible association. Our literature search highlighted two cross-sectional studies, two prospective cohort studies, and one retrospective cohort study. Two of the studies found a significant positive effect of statin treatment on VaD, depicted by the lower incidence of VaD in statin users, while the others reported non-significant associations. The relatively small numbers of VaD patients and statin users, as well as the presence of confounders and biases, make the interpretation of results extremely difficult. Statins may exert a benefit in the prevention of all-type dementia and VaD, through several mechanisms except for hyperlipidemia reduction. A well-designed randomized clinical trial is the ideal study design to address the effect of statin therapy in VaD and to draw final conclusions.", 
    "70": "Finding an efficient neuroprotectant is of urgent need in the field of stroke research. The goal of this study was to test the effect of acute simvastatin administration after stroke in a rat embolic model and to explore its mechanism of action through brain proteomics. To that end, male Wistar rats were subjected to a Middle Cerebral Arteria Occlusion and simvastatin (20\u00a0mg/kg s.c) (n\u00a0=\u00a011) or vehicle (n\u00a0=\u00a09) were administered 15\u00a0min after. To evaluate the neuroprotective mechanisms of simvastatin, brain homogenates after 48\u00a0h were analyzed by two-dimensional fluorescence Difference in Gel Electrophoresis (DIGE) technology. We confirmed that simvastatin reduced the infarct volume and improved neurological impairment at 48\u00a0h after the stroke in this model. Considering our proteomics analysis, 66 spots, which revealed significant differences between groups, were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry allowing the identification of 27 proteins. From these results, we suggest that simvastatin protective effect can be partly explained by the attenuation of the oxidative and stress response at blood-brain barrier level after cerebral ischemia. Interestingly, analyzing one of the proteins (HSP75) in plasma from stroke patients who had received simvastatin during the acute phase, we confirmed the results found in the pre-clinical model. Our aim was to study statins benefits when administered during the acute phase of stroke and to explore its mechanisms of action through brain proteomics assay. Using an embolic model, simvastatin-treated rats showed significant infarct volume reduction and neurological improvement compared to vehicle-treated group. Analyzing their homogenated brains by two-dimensional fluorescence Difference in Gel Electrophoresis (DIGE) technology, we concluded that the protective effect of simvastatin can be attributable to oxidative stress response attenuation and blood-brain barrier protection after cerebral ischemia.",

Array studies on monocytes demonstrated differential expression in 799 genes after fluvastatin treatment. Novel target genes and pathways modulated by fluvastatin were uncovered, including gene networks involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress and mitochondrial activity. Electron microscopy analysis showed increased density volume of mitochondria in monocytes from fluvastatin-treated patients, who also displayed higher expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis.

    "75": "Despite a well-recognized clinical benefit of the 2(nd)-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor nilotinib in patients with imatinib-resistant/-intolerant or newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia, recent evidence suggests that nilotinib has a propensity to increase the risk of occlusive arterial events, especially in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors. Given the key role of lipids in cardiovascular diseases, we studied the plasma lipid profile and global cardiovascular risk prior to and during nilotinib therapy in a series of 27 patients in the setting of a prospective single center study. Data from a minimum 1-year follow up showed that nilotinib significantly increased total, low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol within three months. Consequently, the proportion of patients with non-optimal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased from 48.1% to 88.9% by 12 months, leading to cholesterol-lowering drug intervention in 22.2% of patients. The proportion of patients with low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased from 40.7% to 7.4% by 12 months. In contrast, a significant decrease in triglycerides was observed. Global cardiovascular risk worsened in 11.1% of patients due to diabetes or occlusive arterial events. Whether hypercholesterolemia was the main driver of occlusive arterial events was uncertain: a longer follow up is necessary to ask whether nilotinib-induced hypercholesterolemia increases long-term risk of atherosclerotic diseases. Nevertheless, given key atherogenic properties of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, we conclude that when prescribing nilotinib, commitment to detect lipid disorders at baseline and during follow up is mandatory given their frequency, requirement for changes in lifestyle or drug intervention, and potential for long-term cardiovascular complications.", 
    "76": "The YAP and TAZ mediators of the Hippo pathway (hereafter called YAP/TAZ) promote tissue proliferation and organ growth. However, how their biological properties intersect with cellular metabolism remains unexplained. Here, we show that YAP/TAZ activity is controlled by the SREBP/mevalonate pathway. Inhibition of the rate-limiting enzyme of this pathway (HMG-CoA reductase) by statins opposes YAP/TAZ nuclear localization and transcriptional responses. Mechanistically, the geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate produced by the mevalonate cascade is required for activation of Rho\u00a0GTPases that, in turn, activate YAP/TAZ by inhibiting their phosphorylation and promoting their nuclear accumulation. The mevalonate-YAP/TAZ axis is required for proliferation and self-renewal of breast cancer cells. In Drosophila melanogaster, inhibition of mevalonate biosynthesis and geranylgeranylation blunts the eye overgrowth induced by Yorkie, the YAP/TAZ orthologue. In tumour cells, YAP/TAZ activation is promoted by increased levels of mevalonic acid produced by SREBP transcriptional activity, which is induced by its oncogenic cofactor mutant p53. These findings reveal an additional layer of YAP/TAZ regulation by metabolic cues.", 
    "77": "We previously showed that treating vascular endothelial cells with 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC) caused cell-cycle arrest in the Go/G1 phase; this resulted from the induction of p21 and p27 and a decreased level and activity of the cyclin-dependent kinase, Cdk2. We further investigated the molecular mechanisms that modulate cell-cycle regulatory proteins through the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)/Ras homolog gene family, member A (RhoA) dependent epigenetic modification of histone. AhR/RhoA activation mediated by 3MC was essential for the upregulation of retinoblastoma 2 (pRb2) and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), whereas their nuclear translocation was primarily modulated by RhoA activation. The combination of increased phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) activity and decreased phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activation by 3MC led to the inactivation of the Ras-cRaf pathway, which contributed to pRb2 hypophosphorylation. Increased HDAC1/pRb2 recruitment to the E2F1 complex decreased E2F1-transactivational activity and H3/H4 deacetylation, resulting in the downregulation of cell-cycle regulatory proteins (Cdk2/4 and Cyclin D3/E). Co-immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) results showed that simvastatin prevented the 3MC-increased binding activities of E2F1 proteins in their promoter regions. Additionally, RhoA inhibitors (statins) reversed the effect of 3MC in inhibiting DNA synthesis by decreasing the nuclear translocation of pRb2/HDAC1, leading to a recovery of the levels of cell-cycle regulatory proteins. In summary, 3MC decreased cell proliferation by the epigenetic modification of histone through an AhR/RhoA-dependent mechanism that can be rescued by statins.", 
    "78": "Cardiac hypertrophy is elicited by endothelin (ET)-1 as well as other neurohumoral factors, hemodynamic overload, and oxidative stress; HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) were shown to inhibit cardiac hypertrophy partly via the anti-oxidative stress. One of their common intracellular pathways is the phosphorylation cascade of MEK signaling. Pin1 specifically isomerizes the phosphorylated protein with Ser/Thr-Pro bonds and regulates their activity through conformational changes. There is no report whether the Pin1 activation contributes to ET-1-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and whether the Pin1 inactivation contributes to the inhibitory effect of statins. The aim of this study was to reveal these questions.",

    "80": "Fluvastatin inhibited ET-1-induced increase in the cell surface area, ANP expression, and [(3)H]-leucine incorporation; and it suppressed the signaling cascade from JNK to c-Jun. The phosphorylated Pin1 level, an inactive form, was decreased by ET-1; however, it reached basal level by fluvastatin. Furthermore, Pin1 overexpression clearly elicited cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, which was inhibited by fluvastatin.", 
    "81": "This is the first report that ET-1-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is mediated through the Pin1 activation and that the inhibitory effect of fluvastatin on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy would partly be attributed to the suppression of the Pin1 function. This study firstly suggests that Pin1 determines the size of hypertrophied cardiomyocyte by regulating the activity of phosphorylated molecules and that statins exert their pleiotropic effects partly via Pin1 inactivation.", 
    "82": "Membrane/lipid rafts (MLR) are plasmalemmal microdomains that are essential for neuronal signaling and synaptic development/stabilization. Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of mevalonic, a precursor to cholesterol via the mevalonate pathway. Because there has been controversy over the effects of statins on neuronal and cognitive function, we investigated the impact of long-term atorvastatin treatment (5mg/kg/d for 7 months by oral gavage) on behavior, cognition, and brain biochemistry in mice. We hypothesized that long-term statin treatment would alter lipid rafts and cognitive function. Atorvastatin treatment resulted in behavioral deficits as measured in paradigms for basic exploration (open field activity) and cognitive function (Barnes maze, startle response) without impairment in global motor function (Rotor Rod). Furthermore, significant changes in MLR-associated proteins (syntaxin-1\u03b1 and synaptophysin) and a global change of post-synaptic density protein-95 (PSD95) were observed. The observed decreases in the MLR-localized pre-synaptic vesicle proteins syntaxin-1\u03b1 and synaptophysin suggest a molecular mechanism for the statin-associated impairment of cognitive function that was observed and that has been suggested by the clinical literature.", 
    "83": "Statins, inhibitors of the hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase enzyme, are molecules of fungal origin. By inhibiting a key step in the sterol biosynthetic pathway statins are powerful cholesterol lowering medications and have provided outstanding contributions to the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Their detection in mycetes traces back to close to 40 years ago: there were, originally, widely opposing views on their therapeutic potential. From then on, intensive pharmaceutical development has led to the final availability in the clinic of seven statin molecules, characterized by differences in bioavailability, lipo/hydrophilicity, cytochrome P-450 mediated metabolism and cellular transport mechanisms. These differences are reflected in their relative power (mg LDL-cholesterol reduction per mg dose) and possibly in parenchymal or muscular toxicities. The impact of the antagonism of statins on a crucial step of intermediary metabolism leads, in fact, both to a reduction of cholesterol biosynthesis as well as to additional pharmacodynamic (so called \"pleiotropic\") effects. In the face of an extraordinary clinical success, the emergence of some side effects, e.g. raised incidence of diabetes and cataracts as well as frequent muscular side effects, have led to increasing concern by physicians. However, also in view of the present relatively low cost of these drugs, their impact on daily therapy of vascular patients is unlikely to change.", 
    "84": "Statins as inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase are widely prescribed for hypercholesterolemia treatment. In the last years, statins have also been shown to exert immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects which appear to be related to inhibition of isoprenylation of small GTP-binding proteins and, at least in part, independent of their cholesterol-lowering effects. These \"pleiotropic\" effects make statins an attractive treatment option for immune-mediated disorders such as multiple sclerosis. Studies in vitro and in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis animal model seem to support not only the efficacy of statins as immunomodulatory agents but also their potential neuroprotective properties, although the exact mechanism with which statins exert these effects has not yet been fully understood. The immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties of statins provided the incentive for several clinical trials in multiple sclerosis, in which they were tested not only as mono-therapy but also in combination with interferon-\u03b2. However, the attempt to translate the results of animal model studies in humans produced conflicting results. Further large, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, designed to evaluate the long-term effects of statins alone or in add-on to other disease-modifying therapies, are needed to support their routine clinical use in multiple sclerosis.", 
    "85": "Statins, a class of drugs that act as inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis and protein isoprenylation, have been proposed as immunomodulatory agents due to their potent effects both on T lymphocytes and on antigen presenting cells. Unfortunately to date the benefits of statin therapy have not been unequivocally established due to contrasting results obtained in the setting of several autoimmune diseases. A major hurdle is our limited mechanistic understanding of the pleiotropic mechanisms underlying statin-mediated immunomodulation. Accumulating evidence has highlighted two CD4(+) T cell subsets, the Th17 and Treg cells, as important disease-related targets of statins. Here we shall review recent findings on the activity of statins on Th17 and Treg differentiation and effector function. Statin-based therapies of multiple sclerosis, a Th17 cell-mediated autoimmune disease, and of Systemic Lupus Erithematosus, characterized by a Th17/Treg imbalance, will be also discussed, based on animal models and clinical trials.",

Patients on statin therapy had reduced serum osteopontin (OPN), RANKL/osteoprotegerin (OPG) ratio, and MMP-9/pro-MMP-9 activity as compared to untreated patients. Statin-treated patients exhibited increased levels of collagen and reduced neutrophil infiltration in downstream portions of carotid plaques as compared to untreated controls. In upstream plaque portions, OPG content was increased in statin-treated patients as compared to controls. Other histological parameters (such as lipid, macrophage, smooth muscle cell, and MMP-9 content) as well as RANKL, RANK, and OPG mRNA levels did not differ between the two patient groups. Serum RANKL/OPG ratio positively correlated with serum levels of neutrophilic products, intraplaque neutrophil, and MMP-9 content within downstream portions of carotid plaques. In conclusion, statin treatment was associated with improvement in serum RANKL levels and reduced neutrophil activity both systemically and in atherosclerotic plaques.",

Insulin resistance is a key feature of both NAFLD and GD. Hepatic insulin resistance provides a crucial link between the metabolic syndrome, NAFLD, and increased cholesterol gallstone susceptibility. Hepatic insulin resistance is not only associated with accumulation of hepatic fat but also has a crucial role in supersaturation and excessive production of bile salts. It is not yet clear whether NAFLD is a precursor of GD or whether the presence of GD possibly indicates the presence of long-standing features of metabolic syndrome that accelerates the progression of NAFLD. Recent reports suggested the association between gallstones and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and liver fibrosis. Importantly, both NAFLD and GD are both associated with high incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality. Emerging evidence suggests a potential benefit of statin therapy in NAFLD and GD. Further research is needed to determine (i) how the presence of NAFLD and GD is associated with CVD (ii) and whether the presence of GD in association with NAFLD increases the risk of liver fibrosis, and (iii) the impact of therapy of NAFLD in the incidence of GD.",

Among adults between the ages of 60 and 75 years without cardiovascular disease who are not receiving statin therapy, the percentage who would be eligible for such therapy would increase from 30.4% to 87.4% among men and from 21.2% to 53.6% among women. This effect would be driven largely by an increased number of adults who would be classified solely on the basis of their 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event. Those who would be newly eligible for statin therapy include more men than women and persons with a higher blood pressure but a markedly lower level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

N/L was 2.2\u00b11.2 in the SAP and 2.6\u00b11.0 in the ACS (p=0.002) groups. In patients with SAP, N/L was significantly correlated with Gensini and SYNTAX scores (Gensini score r=0.32, p=0.002; SYNTAX score r=0.36, p=0.000), but there was no significant correlation between N/L and MBG. In the ACS group, N/L had a more powerful association with both Gensini and SYNTAX scores (Gensini r=0.42, p=0.001; SYNTAX r=0.51, p=0.000).

Traditional risk scores are moderately successful in predicting future CHD events and can be a starting place for general risk categorization. However, there is substantial heterogeneity between traditional risk and actual atherosclerosis burden, with event rates predominantly driven by burden of atherosclerosis. Serum biomarkers have yet to show any clinically significant incremental value to the FRS and even when combined cannot match the predictive value of atherosclerosis imaging. As clinicians, are we willing to base therapy decisions on risk models that lack optimum-achievable accuracy and limit personalization? The decision to treat a patient in primary prevention must be a careful one because the benefit of therapy in an asymptomatic patient must clearly outweigh the potential risk. CAC, in particular, provides a personalized assessment of risk and may identify patients who will be expected to derive the most, and the least, net absolute benefit from treatment. Emerging evidence hints that CAC may also promote long-term adherence to aspirin, exercise, diet, and statin therapy. When potentially lifelong treatment decisions are on the line, clinicians must arm their patients with the most accurate risk prediction tools, and subclinical atherosclerosis testing with CAC is, at the present time, superior to any combination of risk factors and serum biomarkers.",

Biological antioxidant potential (BAP) levels were measured at admission and at 6, 12, and 24 months in 69 patients with STEMI. The CV events abruptly increased 6 to 10 months after successful percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with STEMI, and the 6-month BAP levels were significantly lower in patients with CV events (2456 \u03bcmol/L [interquartile range: 2237-2615 \u03bcmol/L]) than in those without (2849 \u03bcmol/L [2575-2987 \u03bcmol/L], P < .001). A decreased 6-month BAP level was an independent and significant predictor of long-term CV events (hazard ratio = 2.45; 95% confidence intervals 1.10-5.78; P = .04). Our findings suggest that serial changes in antioxidant capacity, assessed by BAP levels, may serve as a predictive marker for CV events after STEMI.", 
    "157": "Two large studies in populations selected for cardiovascular disease (CVD) demonstrated that raising high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol with niacin added to statin therapy did not decrease CVD. We examine the association of lipoprotein subfractions with niacin and changes in coronary stenosis and CVD event risk. One hundred and seven patients from 2 previous studies using niacin in combination with either statin or bile acid-binding resin were selected to evaluate changes in lipoproteins separated by density-gradient ultracentrifugation to progression of coronary artery disease as assessed by quantitative coronary angiography. Improvement in coronary stenosis was significantly associated with the decrease of cholesterol in the dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles and across most of the intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) and very low density lipoprotein particle density range, but, not with any of the HDL fraction or of the more buoyant LDL fractions. Event-free survival was significantly associated with the decrease of cholesterol in the dense LDL and IDL; there was no association with changes in cholesterol in the HDL and buoyant LDL fractions. Niacin combination therapy raises HDL cholesterol and decreases dense LDL and IDL cholesterol levels. Changes in LDL and IDL are related to improvement in CVD. Lipoprotein subfraction analysis should be performed in larger studies utilizing niacin in combination with statins.", 
    "158": "New-onset diabetes has been observed in clinical trials and meta-analyses involving statin therapy. To explain this association, three major mechanisms have been proposed and discussed in the literature. First, certain statins affect insulin secretion through direct, indirect or combined effects on calcium channels in pancreatic \u03b2-cells. Second, reduced translocation of glucose transporter 4 in response to treatment results in hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Third, statin therapy decreases other important downstream products, such as coenzyme Q10, farnesyl pyrophosphate, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, and dolichol; their depletion leads to reduced intracellular signaling. Other possible mechanisms implicated in the effect of statins on new-onset diabetes are: statin interference with intracellular insulin signal transduction pathways via inhibition of necessary phosphorylation events and reduction of small GTPase action; inhibition of adipocyte differentiation leading to decreased peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein which are important pathways for glucose homeostasis; decreased leptin causing inhibition of \u03b2-cells proliferation and insulin secretion; and diminished adiponectin levels. Given that the magnitude of the risk of new-onset diabetes following statin use remains to be fully clarified and the well-established beneficial effect of statins in reducing cardiovascular risk, statins remain the first-choice treatment for prevention of CVD. Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the development of diabetes in association with statin use may help identify novel preventative or therapeutic approaches to this problem and/or help design a new generation statin without such side-effects.",

    "160": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the most important public health problem of our time in both Europe and the rest of the world, accounting for the greatest expenditure in most healthcare budgets. Achieving consistency of clinical care, incorporating new evidence and their synthesis into practical recommendations for clinicians is the task of various guideline committees throughout the world. Any change in a set of guidelines therefore can have far reaching consequences, particularly if they appear to be at variance with the existing guidelines. The present article discusses the recent American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines 2013 on the control of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in adults. When compared with the ESC/EAS guidelines on lipid modification in 2011, the ACC/AHA guidelines of 2013 differ markedly. Specifically, (i) the scope is limited to randomized trials only, which excludes a significant body of data and promotes essentially a statin centric approach only; (ii) the abolition of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets in favour of specific statin regimens that produce a 30-50% reduction in LDL-C we believe will confuse many physicians and miss the opportunity for medication adherence and patient engagement in self-management; (iii) the absence of target LDL-C levels in very high-risk patients with high absolute risk or residual risk factors will discourage clinicians to consider the addition of lipid modification treatments and individualize patient care; (iv) a reduction in the threshold for treatment in primary prevention will result in a greater number of patients being prescribed statin therapy, which is potentially good in young patients with high life time risk, but will result in a very large number of older patients offered therapy; and (v) the mixed pool risk calculator used to asses CVD risk in the guidelines for primary prevention has not been fully evaluated. This article discusses the potential implications of adopting the ACC/AHA guidelines on patient care in Europe and beyond and concludes with the opinion that the ESC/EAS guidelines from 2011 seem to be the most wide ranging, pragmatic and appropriate choice for European countries.",

Beyond their cholesterol lowering impact, statins have pleiotropic effects and their use is linked to improved lung health. We have shown that mevalonate cascade inhibition induces apoptosis and autophagy in cultured human airway mesenchymal cells. Here, we show that simvastatin also induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) in these cells. We tested whether coordination of ER stress, autophagy and apoptosis determines survival or demise of human lung mesenchymal cells exposed to statin. We observed that simvastatin exposure activates UPR (activated transcription factor 4, activated transcription factor 6 and IRE1\u03b1) and caspase-4 in primary human airway fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. Exogenous mevalonate inhibited apoptosis, autophagy and UPR, but exogenous cholesterol was without impact, indicating that sterol intermediates are involved with mechanisms mediating statin effects. Caspase-4 inhibition decreased simvastatin-induced apoptosis, whereas inhibition of autophagy by ATG7 or ATG3 knockdown significantly increased cell death. In BAX(-/-)/BAK(-/-) murine embryonic fibroblasts, simvastatin-triggered apoptotic and UPR events were abrogated, but autophagy flux was increased leading to cell death via necrosis. Our data indicate that mevalonate cascade inhibition, likely associated with depletion of sterol intermediates, can lead to cell death via coordinated apoptosis, autophagy, and ER stress. The interplay between these pathways appears to be principally regulated by autophagy and Bcl-2-family pro-apoptotic proteins. These findings uncover multiple mechanisms of action of statins that could contribute to refining the use of such agent in treatment of lung disease.",

We then performed electronic chart abstraction of prescriber-intended exposure time for statins, using previously identified logic to capture pill-splitting events, normalizing dosages to atorvastatin-equivalent dose. Four models using iterative training sets were tested to capture statin end-dates. Calculated cumulative provider-intended exposures were compared to manually abstracted gold-standard measures of ordered statin prescriptions, and aggregate model results (totals) for training and validation populations were compared.

The latter seems to explain from 20% up to 95% of patient to patient variability. Treating patients with cardiovascular disorders faces the clinician with the challenge to include genomic analysis into daily practice. There are several examples within cardiovascular disease of treatments that can vary in toxicity or clinical usefulness based on genetic changes. One of the main factors affecting the efficacy of Clopidogrel is the phenotype associated with polymorphisms in the gene CYP 2C9. Furthermore, regarding oral anticoagulants, changes in CYP2C9 and VKORC1 play an important role in changing the clinical response to anticoagulation.

Clinically, fatty liver progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) may be prevented by tackling obesity and administering appropriate medications.", 
    "201": "The effects of statins on the prognosis of patients with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction remain controversial. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of statin treatment on clinical outcomes in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients with LV systolic dysfunction. A total of 5,119 AMI patients with LV ejection fraction less than 50% on the initial echocardiogram were analyzed in the Korean Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry. The study population was divided into 4 groups according to the level of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and statin treatment: low hs-CRP (hs-CRP \u2264 2.0 mg/L) and high hs-CRP (hs-CRP > 2 mg/L) with or without statin therapy. We evaluated the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) including cardiac death, reinfarction, target lesion revascularization, and coronary artery bypass grafting during a 12-month period in each group. Statin therapy did not significantly prevent the MACEs in the low hs-CRP groups (with statin: 10.1% versus without statin: 12.0%, P = 0.249). In the high hs-CRP groups, however, the incidence of MACEs was significantly decreased with statin treatment (with statin: 11.3%, without statin: 20.8%, P < 0.001). These findings were consistently observed in all subgroups of the high-hs CRP group, including the subgroup with an LV ejection fraction less than 40%. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis of the high hs-CRP group, lack of statin therapy was a significant predictor of MACE incidence (odds ratio: 1.573, 95% confidence interval: 1.079-2.293, P = 0.018). The statin treatment was associated with better outcome in AMI and LV dysfunction patients with hs-CRP \u2265 2 mg/dL.", 
    "202": "Previous studies have examined the negative impacts of individual cardiovascular risk (CVR) factors on left atrial (LA)-left ventricular (LV) interaction, whereas the combined effects of these risk factors are insufficiently elucidated. We studied 176 asymptomatic patients with CVR factors and age-matched 50 healthy individuals by conventional and 2-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography. The patients were classified into 2 groups according to the number of CVR factors: one risk factor (single) group (n = 79) and 2 or more risk factors (comorbid) group (n = 97). The peak early diastolic transmitral flow velocity (E)/peak early diastolic mitral annular motion velocity (e')/peak systolic LA strain (S-LAs) was used as a surrogate for LA stiffness during ventricular systole. The E/e'/S-LAs was greatest in the comorbid group. The peak systolic LV circumferential and radial strains, peak early diastolic LV radial strain rate, and peak early diastolic LA strain and strain rate were lower in the comorbid group than in the single group. Multivariate regression analysis identified age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, end-systolic LV diameter, peak systolic mitral annular motion velocity (s'), and peak systolic LV radial strain in the comorbid group, and peak atrial systolic transmitral fl ow velocity and s' in the single group, as independent predictors of E/e'/S-LAs. Subtle LA and LV dysfunction with individual CVR factors were more aggravated with the comorbid conditions in asymptomatic patients.", 
    "203": "Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), a measure of atherosclerosis, is modulated by multiple risk factors. Accordingly, comprehensive control of risk factors is indispensable for management of atherosclerosis. In this study, as a posthoc analysis of the JART Study we planned two analyses. In the main analysis, we evaluated the effect of intensive lipid-lowering therapy with rosuvastatin on carotid IMT in high-risk patients. We also evaluated efficacy in the presence or absence of each risk factor using the full analysis population in the JART Study. Patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) \u2265 140 mg/dL and max-IMT \u2265 1.1 mm were randomized to rosuvastatin or pravastatin therapy for 12 months. Dosages were allowed to increase to 10 mg/day and 20 mg/day to achieve LDL-goals (aggressive goals for rosuvastatin group and guideline goals for pravastatin group). For the main analysis, we assessed 200 high-risk patients (105 in the rosuvastatin group), as category III or secondary prevention according to the Japan Atherosclerosis Society guideline 2007, whereas we assessed 289 patients in the other analysis. Rosuvastatin significantly slowed the percentage change in mean-IMT at 12 months compared with pravastatin (1.40 \u00b1 10.03% versus 6.43 \u00b1 13.77%, P = 0.005). LDL-C was reduced by 48.1% in the rosuvastatin group and 27.9% in the pravastatin group. The rate of achieving the LDL-C goal was significantly greater in the rosuvastatin group compared with the pravastatin group (P < 0.001). Rosuvastatin slowed the change in mean-IMT in the presence of every risk factor. Thus, intensive lipid-lowering therapy reduced progression of carotid IMT in high-risk patients."
