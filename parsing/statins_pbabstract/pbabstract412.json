    "0": "The biosynthesis of adrenal corticosteroids in humans depends on a continuous supply of cholesterol, which can be derived from both local synthesis and receptor-mediated uptake of low density lipoproteins (LDL) from plasma. Mevinolin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase [mevalonate:NAD+ oxidoreductase (CoA-acylating), EC 1.1.1.88] is an effective hypolipidemic agent in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. To determine whether mevinolin influences the adrenal production of corticosteroids, the adrenocortical response to a continuous 36-hr infusion of corticotropin (ACTH) was examined in eight patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia before, and again during, treatment with mevinolin (40-80 mg/day). The drug produced an average decrease of 28% and 34% in the plasma concentrations of total and LDL cholesterol. Serum cortisol levels showed similar increases in response to ACTH stimulation before and during mevinolin treatment, and the rates of excretion of urine-free cortisol were also similar. We conclude that clinically effective doses of mevinolin do not affect corticosteroid production by the adrenal cortex during prolonged ACTH stimulation in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "1": "The functional molecular weight of rat liver 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase was determined by radiation inactivation. Both isolated hepatic microsomes and primary hepatocytes were irradiated with high energy electrons at -135 degrees C, and the residual microsomal enzyme activity was subsequently determined. The loss of enzyme activity in both irradiated microsomes and microsomes isolated from irradiated hepatocytes followed a single exponential decay which corresponded to a molecular mass of 200 kDa. This minimal molecular size of the functional enzyme was unaffected by either addition of cholestyramine to the rat diet or addition of 25-hydroxycholesterol plus mevalonate to the isolated rat hepatocytes. In addition, surviving enzyme protein was determined by immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled enzyme from hepatocytes that had been incubated with [35S]methionine before irradiation. The target size for loss of the monomer subunits was 98 kDa. The simplest interpretation of these results is that rat liver 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase in situ is a noncovalently linked dimer of the Mr = 97,200 enzyme subunit.", 
    "2": "Cholesterol synthesis in cell culture in the presence of D2O yields a spectrum of enriched molecules having a relative abundance that indicates random substitution of deuterium for hydrogen. Quantitation of the absolute rate of cholesterol synthesis is obtained by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Mevinolin and 26-hydroxycholesterol both decrease cholesterol synthesis rate but have a discordant effect on HMG-CoA reductase activity.", 
    "3": "A somatic cell mutant has been isolated which is resistant to killing and growth inhibition by mevinolin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. The resistance phenotype is dominant with respect to the wild-type cell and can largely be ascribed to a 6-7-fold lowering of the KM for HMG-CoA. We thus conclude that mevinolin resistance can be utilized to obtain a genetic marker for the structural gene encoding HMH-CoA reductase.", 
    "4": "A 4-month-old infant with hypotonia and macrocephaly was diagnosed as having 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria, using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry and confirmatory enzyme studies. The same diagnosis was made on his asymptomatic non-identical twin. Examination of the pedigree is consistent with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Dietary treatment improved the symptoms of the propositus, but did not prevent episodes similar to Reye's syndrome in both twins. One such episode closely followed immunisation and our experience suggests that children with this disorder should be observed carefully following immunisation. These episodes were accompanied by an overflow of a wide range of abnormal metabolites. Examination of the urine for organic acids should be considered in infants with unexplained hypotonia and macrocephaly, especially if accompanied by abnormal biochemical indices.", 
    "5": "Although widely distributed throughout mammalian tissues, the biological function of cholesterol sulfate remains largely unknown. In these studies we have demonstrated that cholesterol sulfate suppresses de novo sterol synthesis in cultured human fibroblasts. It was further shown in these cultured cells that cholesterol sulfate is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (mevalonate: NADP+ oxidoreductase (CoA-acylating), EC 1.1.1.34), the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis and the site at which exogenous cholesterol suppresses endogenous cholesterol synthesis. Because cholesterol sulfate inhibited sterologenesis in steroid-sulfatase deficient fibroblasts derived from patients with recessive X-linked ichthyosis, it was inferred that cholesterol sulfate per se and not cholesterol liberated by intracellular desulfation was the inhibitor in these studies. Cholesterol sulfate may be an endogenous regulator of mammalian cholesterol biosynthesis.", 
    "6": "The activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMGCoA) reductase of rat liver microsomes was inhibited by the addition of FeSO4 and the cytosolic protein, fermodulin. Modulation of the activity was obtained only in the combined presence of Fe2+ and fermodulin. Using ammonium sulfate fractionation, heat treatment, and chromatography on CM-Sephadex and then on an Fe2+-Blue Sepharose affinity matrix, fermodulin was purified to homogeneity. The molecular weight of the purified protein, as determined by filtration through a Sephacryl S-200 column, was 58,000. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the protein resolved into two subunits of Mr 43,000 and 28,000. Fermodulin showed ultraviolet absorption and fluorescence spectra typical of tryptophan-containing proteins, and addition of FeSO4 quenched the fluorescence. Using the Millipore filter assay the binding of 1.6 mol 55FeCl2/mol fermodulin was observed in the presence of Tris-HCl buffer. The inhibitory effect of fermodulin at nonsaturating concentrations was potentiated by bicarbonate, ATP.Mg, and ADP.Mg.", 
    "7": "Two monensin-resistant clones show similar low-density lipoprotein binding activity but less internalization or degradation of low-density lipoprotein than the parental Balb/3T3 or other resistant clone. Sterol synthesis from radioactive acetate in the resistant mutant, MO-5, is inhibited by more than 70% of control in the presence of tenfold higher amounts of low-density lipoprotein than the dose that inhibits the parental Balb/3T3 to similar level. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity of Balb/3T3 and MO-5 is inhibited by 48% and 27% of control, respectively, in the presence of 10 micrograms/ml of low-density lipoprotein. Colloidal silica gradient centrifugation shows that transport of low-density lipoprotein from the surface membrane to the lysosome is much slower in MO-5 cells than in Balb/3T3 cells. Down regulation of low-density lipoprotein receptors on the cell surface in Balb/3T3 is observed by exposing the cells to 5-15 micrograms/ml low-density lipoprotein, whereas only slight if any down regulation is observed when MO-5 cells are treated with low-density lipoprotein. The altered endocytosis of low-density lipoprotein behaves as a dominant trait in hybrids of MO-5 and THO2-2, a derivative of Balb/3T3 resistant to both ouabain and 6-thioguanine.", 
    "8": "Intracellular sources of extramitochondrial corticoidogenic cholesterol in bovine, rat and hamster adrenocortical cells were examined in vitro by comparing the species differences in the effects of various inhibitors on the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-induced corticoidogenesis. The inhibitors were ML-236B (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor), W-7 (N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalene sulfonamide; calmodulin inhibitor), dichlorvos (O,O-dimethyl-2,2-dichlorovinyl phosphate; organic phosphorylation inhibitor), chloroquine [7-chloro-4-4-diethylamino-1-methyl-butylamino) quinoline; lysosomal enzyme inhibitor) and cycloheximide (protein synthesis inhibitor). During 2 to 3 hr incubation periods, the ACTH-induced corticoidogenesis was not inhibited by ML-236B (100 microM) in the bovine and rat adrenocortical cells. In the hamster adrenocortical cells, ML-236B (100 microM) did not affect the ACTH-induced corticoidogenesis during the initial 1 hr incubation periods; but thereafter, the ACTH-induced corticoidogenesis during the subsequent 2 hr incubation periods was completely blocked by ML-236B. The ACTH-induced corticoidogenesis was inhibited by W-7 (up to 25 microM) in the bovine and rat adrenocortical cells, but this was not the case in the hamster cells. Chloroquine (up to 400 microM) inhibited the ACTH-induced corticoidogenesis in the adrenocortical cells of three different species, but the hamster adrenal cells were much more vulnerable than the bovine and rat cells. The ACTH-induced corticoidogenesis in the adrenocortical cells of three different species were equally inhibited by cycloheximide (up to 1 mM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

This compound was isolated by solvent extraction and column chromatography, and its structure was determined by a combination of IR, UV, 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Monacolin K was also converted to the corresponding hydroxylated analogue. Data on the inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl co-enzyme A reductase and sterol biosynthesis in vitro are presented for these hydroxylated compounds.", 
    "10": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG CoA reductase) is a single polypeptide chain with two contiguous domains: a soluble domain (548 amino acids) that catalyzes the rate-controlling step in cholesterol synthesis and a membrane-bound domain (339 amino acids) that anchors the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). HMG CoA reductase is degraded at least 10-fold more rapidly than other ER proteins; degradation is accelerated in the presence of cholesterol. To understand this controlled degradation, we transfected reductase-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with a plasmid expression vector containing a reductase cDNA that lacks the segment encoding the membrane domain. The plasmid produced a truncated reductase (37 kd smaller than normal) that was enzymatically active with normal kinetics; most of the truncated enzyme was found in the cytosol. The truncated enzyme was degraded one-fifth as fast as the holoenzyme; degradation was no longer accelerated by sterols. We conclude that the membrane-bound domain of reductase plays a crucial role in the rapid and regulated degradation of this ER protein.", 
    "11": "Derivatives of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid (HMG), a portion of the substrate for HMG CoA reductase, were prepared and tested for their inhibitory action against rat liver HMG CoA reductase and for their hypocholesterolemic activity. Structure-dependent competitive inhibition was observed. Optimal structures had a free dicarboxylic acid with an alkyl group of 13-16 carbons at position 3. 3-n-Pentadecyl-3-hydroxyglutaric acid (3j) (IC50 = 50 microM) reduced serum cholesterol in the Triton-treated rat and HMG CoA reductase activity in the 20,25-diazacholesterol-treated rat.", 
    "12": "Mevinolinic acid, the open acid form of mevinolin, which is a metabolite of Aspergillus terreus, has been shown to be a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (Alberts et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 77:3957-3961, 1980). The biosynthesis of mevinolinic acid was studied by examining the incorporation of [1-14C]acetate and [methyl-14C]methionine into the molecule. These isotopes were rapidly incorporated into mevinolinic acid, with [1-14C]acetate and [methyl-14C]methionine incorporation being linear for at least 10 and 30 min, respectively. A comparison of acetate incorporation into mevinolinic acid and fatty acids indicated that mevinolinic acid biosynthesis increased with a maximum between days 3 and 5 of growth; at this time cell growth had ceased and fatty acid biosynthesis was negligible. Hydrolysis of the mevinolinic acid and isolation of the products showed that [1-14C]acetate and [methyl-14C]methionine were incorporated into the 2-methylbutyric acid side chain as well as into the main (alcohol) portion of the molecule.", 
    "13": "The changes in the structure and proliferative activity of rabbit ileal mucosa have been studied with morphometric and stathmokinetic techniques during 24 h organ culture. Under control conditions the villus base diameter and villus height decreased by 34 and 53%, respectively, whereas the number of villi per mm2 remained constant. The reduction of crypt depth was less pronounced than the loss in villus height, leading to a decrease in the villus height to crypt depth ratio from 3.4 to 2.3. The likely reason for this culture induced hypoplasia was a significant drop in mitotic activity as early as 2 h after starting the culture. Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, the key enzyme of cholesterogenesis, lead to a further reduction in mucosal dimensions and a near complete suppression of crypt cell regeneration. These data imply that despite the well-known preservation of differentiated function mucosal cell renewal during organ culture is impaired.", 
    "14": "A recombinant plasmid containing a full-length cDNA for hamster 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase was introduced by calcium phosphate-mediated transfection into UT-2 cells, a mutant line of Chinese hamster ovary cells that lack 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity and thus require low density lipoprotein-cholesterol and mevalonate for growth. We selected a line of permanently transfected cells, designated TR-36 cells, that expressed high levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity and thus grew in the absence of low density lipoprotein and mevalonate. Constitutive synthesis of reductase mRNA in TR-36 cells was driven by the simian virus 40 early promoter, and therefore the mRNA was not suppressed by sterols, such as 25-hydroxycholesterol or cholesterol derived from low density lipoprotein, which normally suppresses transcription of reductase mRNA when the reductase gene is driven by its own promoter. Although TR-36 cells continued to synthesize large amounts of reductase mRNA and protein in the presence of sterols, reductase activity declined by 50 to 60%. This decline was caused by a twofold increase in the rate of degradation of preformed enzyme molecules. The current data demonstrate that sterols accelerate the degradation of reductase protein independently of any inhibitory effect on the synthesis of the protein.", 
    "15": "Spectroscopic, ultrafiltration, and kinetic studies have been used to characterize interactions of reduced and oxidized triphosphopyridine nucleotides (TPNH and TPN), 2'-phosphoadenosine 5'-diphosphoribose (Rib-P2-Ado-P), and adenosine 2',5'-bisphosphate [Ado(2',5')P2] with with TPN-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase. Close similarity of the UV difference spectra and of the protein fluorescence changes accompanying the formation of the binary complexes provides evidence for the binding of these nucleotides to the same site on the enzyme. From the pH dependence of the dissociation constants for TPNH binding to TPN-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase in the absence and in the presence of Mn2+, over the pH range 5.8-7.6, it has been demonstrated that the nucleotide binds to the enzyme in its unprotonated, metal-free form. The involvement of positively charged residues, protonated over the pH range studied, has been postulated. One TPNH binding site per enzyme subunit has been measured by fluorescence and difference absorption titrations. A dramatic effect of ionic strength on binding has been demonstrated: about a 1000-fold decrease in the dissociation constant for TPNH has been observed at pH 7.6 upon decreasing ionic strength from 0.336 (Kd = 1.2 +/- 0.2 microM) to 0.036 M (Kd = 0.4 +/- 0.1 nM) in the presence and in the absence of 100 mM Na2SO4, respectively. Weak competition of sulfate ions for the nucleotide binding site has been observed (KI = 57 +/- 3 mM). The binding of TPN in the presence of 100 mM Na2SO4 at pH 7.6 is about 100-fold weaker (Kd = 110 +/- 22 microM) than the binding of the reduced coenzyme and is similarly affected by ionic strength. These results demonstrate the importance of electrostatic interactions in the binding of the coenzyme to TPN-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase. The large enhancement of protein fluorescence caused by binding of TPN and Rib-P2-Ado-P (delta Fmax = 50%) and of Ado(2',5')P2 (delta Fmax = 41%) has been ascribed to a local conformational change of the enzyme. An apparent stoichiometry of 0.5 nucleotide binding site per peptide chain was determined for TPN, Rib-P2-Ado-P, and Ado(2',5')P2 from fluorescence titrations, in contrast to one binding site per enzyme subunit determined from UV difference spectral titration and ultrafiltration experiments. Thus, the binding of one molecule of the nucleotide per dimeric enzyme molecule is responsible for the total increase in protein fluorescence, while binding to the second subunit does not cause further change.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "16": "The sodium salts of compactin (1) and trans-6-[2-(2,4- dichloro-6-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-4-hydroxy-2H-pyran- 2-one (3) are inhibitors of yeast beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. The dissociation constants are 0.24 X 10(-9) and 0.28 X 10(-9) M, respectively. Similar values have been reported for HMG-CoA reductase from mammalian sources [Endo, A., Kuroda, M., & Tanzawa, K. (1976) FEBS Lett. 72, 323; Alberts, A. W., et al. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 77, 3957]. The structures of these compounds marginally resemble that of any substrates of HMG-CoA reductase. We, therefore, investigated the basis for the strong interaction between HMG-CoA reductase and these inhibitors. HMG-CoA and coenzyme A (CoASH), but not reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), prevent binding of compactin to the enzyme. HMG-CoA, but not CoASH or NADPH, prevents binding of 3 to the enzyme. We also investigated the inhibitory activity of molecules that resemble structural components of compactin. Compactin consists of a moiety resembling 3,5-dihydroxyvaleric acid that is attached to a decalin structure. The sodium salt of DL-3,5-dihydroxyvaleric acid inhibits HMG-CoA reductase competitively with respect to HMG-CoA and noncompetitively with respect to NADPH. The dissociation constant for DL-3,5-dihydroxyvaleric acid, derived from protection against inactivation of enzyme by iodoacetic acid, is (2.1 +/- 0.9) X 10(-2) M. Two decalin derivatives (structurally identical with or closely related to the decalin moiety of compactin) showed no detectable inhibition. If the lack of inhibition is due to their limited solubility, the dissociation constant of these decalin derivatives may be conservatively estimated to be greater than or equal to 0.5 mM. Simultaneous addition of decalin derivatives and DL-3,5-dihydroxyvaleric acid does not lead to enhanced inhibition. The sodium salt of (E)-6-[2-(2-methoxy-1-naphthalenyl)ethenyl]-3,4,5,6- tetrahydro-4-hydroxy-2H-pyran-2-one (6) inhibits HMG-CoA reductase competitively with respect to HMG-CoA and noncompetitively with respect to NADPH. The inhibition constant (vs. HMG-CoA) is 0.8 microM. CoASH does not prevent binding of 6 to enzyme. Compound 6, therefore, behaves analogously to compound 3. We propose that these inhibitors occupy two sites on the enzyme: one site is the hydroxymethylglutaryl binding domain of the enzyme active site and the other site is a hydrophobic pocket located adjacent to the active site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Furthermore, only one enantiomer of the ring-opened form of lactone 6a(+/-) possesses the activity displayed by the racemate.

Screening for metabolic disorders revealed massive 3-methylglutaconic with 3-methylglutaric aciduria leading to the tentative diagnosis of 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase deficiency. Metabolite excretion was correlated with variation of leucine intake. 3-methyl-3-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA lyase activity in cultured fibroblasts was normal. The suspected metabolic defect was not demonstrable in cultured skin fibroblasts, however.", 
    "21": "We have isolated three mammalian cell lines which are resistant to compactin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. The drug resistance in all three cell lines is due to an increase of HMG-CoA reductase activity. Two of the three cell lines overaccumulate HMG-CoA reductase messenger RNA when grown in the presence of compactin. DNA hybridization experiments indicate that both a baby hamster kidney-derived compactin-resistant cell line, C100, and a cell line derived from mouse 3T6 cells, 3T6-40, exhibit amplifications of the HMG-CoA reductase gene. A third compactin-resistant cell line derived from Chinese hamster ovary cells, ML100, does not exhibit an amplification of the HMG-CoA reductase gene, nor does it show an elevated level of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA, comparable to that seen in the other cell lines.",

The phosphorylation and concomitant inactivation of enzymic activity of HMG-CoA reductase was absolutely dependent on Ca2+, phosphatidylserine, and diolein. Dephosphorylation of phosphorylated HMG-CoA reductase was associated with the loss of protein bound radioactivity and reactivation of enzymic activity. Maximal phosphorylation of purified HMG-CoA reductase was associated with the incorporation of 1.05 +/- 0.016 mol of phosphate/mol of native form of HMG-CoA reductase (Mr approximately 100,000). The apparent Km for purified HMG-CoA reductase and histone H1 was 0.08 mg/ml, and 0.12 mg/ml, respectively. The tumor-promoting phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulated the protein kinase C-catalyzed phosphorylation of HMG-CoA reductase. Increased phosphorylation of HMG-CoA reductase by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate suggests a possible in vivo protein kinase C-mediated mechanism for the short-term regulation of HMG-CoA reductase activity. The identification of the protein kinase C system in addition to the reductase kinase-reductase kinase kinase bicyclic cascade systems for the modulation of the enzymic activity of HMG-CoA reductase may provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis.", 
    "23": "A series of 22-hydroxycholesterol derivatives with a modified side chain terminus was prepared. These agents were evaluated in vitro and in vivo for their ability to suppress HMG CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis. In tissue culture assays, 22-hydroxycholesterol as well as the side chain modified analogues were potent inhibitors of HMG CoA reductase. However, only those sterols with a modified side chain terminus were effective suppressors of liver reductase when administered ig to rats. 22-Hydroxy-25-methylcholesterol (4a) and 25-fluoro-22-hydroxycholesterol (15a) significantly lowered serum cholesterol levels when administered ig to primates; 25-chloro-22-hydroxycholesterol (15b) and the analogue with a cyclopropyl terminus, 20b, were ineffective.

    "25": "When the disulfide of 2-mercaptoethanol (ESSE) is added to the medium of cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, a time and concentration dependent release of 2-mercaptoethanol to the medium is observed. The reduction of ESSE to 2-mercaptoethanol by cells is a saturable process, the rate being approximately 50 nmoles of 2-mercaptoethanol per mg cell protein for an hour upon exposure to 250 microM ESSE. Reduction rate of ESSE by cells attached to a substratum is independent of glucose and insulin for periods up to 4 hours. However, in detached cells, swirled in suspension, addition of glucose and insulin is necessary in order to obtain a linear reduction rate of ESSE. The rate limiting enzyme in the sterol biosynthetic pathway, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl Coenzyme A reductase (E.C. 1.1.1.34), is inhibited by ESSE when isolated from CHO cells but total nonsaponifiable lipids synthesis from [2-14C]-acetate in intact cells is not affected by ESSE at concentrations up to 500 microM. Cytosolic reduced glutathione can spontaneously exchange disulfide bonds with ESSE and thus prevent it from inhibiting the reductase. Cultured cells respond to ESSE administration by elevating their total and acid-soluble glutathione levels. The use of ESSE as a perturbant of the GSH Status in cells is discussed.",

EGF stimulates the incorporation of [14C]acetate into cholesterol. EGF increases the activity of the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, HMG CoA reductase. EGF has no effect on the levels of any intermediates involved in the conversion of pregnenolone to cortisol, although ACTH produced changes consistent with 17 alpha-hydroxylase activation. We propose that EGF increases adrenal cortisol synthesis in vitro by a stimulation of cholesterol precursor biosynthesis mediated through activation of HMG CoA reductase.", 
    "27": "We have evaluated the hypolipidemic effects of mevinolin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis in 13 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Patients were maintained on a low-cholesterol diet and received sequentially increasing doses of 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg of mevinolin twice daily for a period of 1 mo on each dose. Plasma concentrations of low density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased by 19.8% on the 5 mg twice daily dose (P less than 0.05 vs. base line), 28.4% on 10 mg of mevinolin twice daily (P less than 0.05 vs. 5 mg twice daily), 35% on 20 mg of mevinolin twice daily (P less than 0.05 vs. 10 mg twice daily), and 37.7% on 40 mg of mevinolin twice daily (not statistically different from 20 mg twice daily). Concentrations of high density lipoprotein cholesterol remained stable on all doses of mevinolin whereas plasma triglyceride levels fell significantly on the 20 mg (-30.7%) and 40 mg (-34.3%) twice daily doses of mevinolin. Mevinolin was well tolerated and all patients completed the study period. Side effects during the period of study were limited to transient insomnia and headaches in two patients, transient increases in alkaline phosphatase in three patients, and a modest but sustained increase in alkaline phosphatase in a fourth patient. These results indicate that mevinolin is an effective hypolipidemic agent in patients with heterozygous FH but that the optimal doses in these patients are greater than those previously reported in normal volunteers. If long-term safety can be satisfactorily established, mevinolin offers considerable promise in the therapy of heterozygous FH.", 
    "28": "The catalytically inactivating subset within rabbit serum polyclonal antibody to the solubilized, purified 55,000 to 60,000 dalton active fragment of rat liver microsomal beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase immunoinactivates this enzyme with little or no diminution of effect by enzyme catalytically inactivated by incubation of microsomes with ATP,Mg++. Reactivation of inactive enzyme with ethanol-treated rat liver phosphatase restores antibody affinity showing that the catalytically inactivating subset of antibody exhibits marked or complete affinity for the active enzyme over the ATP,Mg++- inactivated form. This means that immunoinactivation using this antibody is not a valid way of measuring changes in the specific activity of the enzyme via phosphorylation-dephosphorylation. Preference for the active enzyme has not been obvious because when different amounts of enzyme activity are used in immunotitrations of samples of low activity, apparent differences in specific activity are observed when none actually exist. If precautions are not taken, results are obtained supporting phosphorylation by using an antibody that is not capable of distinguishing it.",

All of these compounds were found to be potent inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG-CoA) reductase activity in cultured mouse L cells.

    "30": "Normal fasting human plasma was incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees C in the presence or absence of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) inhibitors. The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) fractions of incubated plasma (control LDL and LCAT-modified LDL) were studied with respect to their chemical and functional properties. LCAT-modified LDL differed from control LDL by a decreased phospholipid and free-cholesterol content, but increased cholesteryl esters. Furthermore, an increase of the relative protein content in LDL by 16-20% was found. Apolipoproteins of LCAT-modified LDL exhibited a 10-fold increase of apo AI, a 4-5-fold increase of apo E, and a 2-fold increase of apo C. All these apolipoproteins resided together with apo B on the same particles. LCAT-modified LDL displayed a higher electrophoretic mobility, a higher hydrated density, a decreased flotation constant and a smaller diameter. Cultured human fibroblasts bound and internalized LCAT-modified LDL to a lower extent than control LDL. The degradation, however, was faster. Modified LDL suppressed 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity to a lower extent than did control LDL. Our results demonstrate that LCAT action, together with lipid transfer and exchange processes, markedly alters the chemical and physiochemical properties of LDL. This in turn significantly influences LDL catabolism in vitro.",

The degree of enhancement of enzyme activity by NADH decreased as GSH concentration in the assay increased. Addition of 500 microM NADH to the assay converted the sigmoidal (Hill coefficient = 2.0) NADPH-dependent kinetic curve of the microsomal reductase into Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Hill coefficient = 1.1). Furthermore, the kinetic curves were shifted to the left, resulting in an up to 35% decrease in the concentration of NADH required to obtain half-maximal velocity (S0.5) in the presence of 500 microM NADH. Again, this effect of NADH was diminished as GSH concentrations increased. These results demonstrate that NAD(H) is an allosteric activator of HMG-CoA reductase. These results also indicate that HMG-CoA reductase has NAD(H) binding site(s) distinct from the catalytic NADPH site(s).", 
    "32": "To investigate the perturbation of ubiquinone biosynthesis by a hypocholesterolemic drug, 3 beta-(2-diethylaminoethoxy)androst-5-en-17-one hydrochloride (U18666A), we measured the incorporation of radioactive mevalonate, methionine, tyrosine, and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid into ubiquinone in glioblastoma cells. These four precursors unanimously showed that ubiquinone biosynthesis was not significantly altered by U18666A, which blocked cholesterol biosynthesis at steps beyond mevalonate formation. The fluctuation of the endogenous mevalonate level had little effect on ubiquinone biosynthesis, implying the relative stability of cellular ubiquinone biosynthesis. Furthermore, exogenously added mevalonate did not have an appreciable effect on ubiquinone biosynthesis. The major ubiquinone produced in rat glioblastoma cells was identified as ubiquinone-9. The mevalonate-derived products accumulated in the U18666A-treated cells differed significantly from those reported in a broken cell study, suggesting the existence of delicate mechanisms regulating the formation of cholesterol intermediates.", 
    "33": "Twelve patients with severe heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, in whom other hypolipidemic drug therapy had failed to reduce serum cholesterol levels to less than 300 mg/dL, were sequentially treated with mevinolin (a specific inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis) and colestipol. In ten patients receiving 80 mg/d of mevinolin, plasma cholesterol concentrations decreased 33%, from 487 +/- 27 (SE) mg/dL to 326 +/- 16 mg/dL. Additional therapy with colestipol resulted in a further 18% decrease, to 269 +/- 13 mg/dL. Concentrations of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol decreased in parallel (54% decrease on combined drug therapy). Plasma concentrations of high density lipoprotein cholesterol did not change significantly, but the LDL:HDL ratio decreased from 8.2 in patients on diet only to 3.8 in patients treated with mevinolin and colestipol. In seven patients treated with 40 mg/d of mevinolin, concentrations of LDL cholesterol decreased by 33%; combined therapy resulted in a further 20% decrease (46% reduction from the level achieved with diet only). No consistent side effects have been noted in up to 24 months of therapy. Combined therapy with mevinolin and colestipol promises to be effective for heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "34": "The current studies were undertaken to define the optimal conditions for measuring the absolute rates of cholesterol synthesis in cultured rabbit intestine and to assess whether the rate of sterol synthesis affects the esterification of locally formed or absorbed cholesterol. Using both [3H]water or [14C]octanoate (3 mM) as a precursor, sterol formation was linear during the 24 h culture, resulting in comparable estimates of the rate of synthesis equivalent to 129.5 and 118.7 nmol acetyl CoA incorporated per g per h, respectively. The presence of liposomal cholesterol or the hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor mevinolin suppressed the rates of cholesterol synthesis by 24 and 92% of controls, respectively. Only 12% of total newly synthesized cholesterol was recovered in the medium and more than 97% was in the unesterified form, in both medium and biopsy. Even when the rate of sterol synthesis was stimulated over 90-fold by increasing concentrations of [14C]mevalonolactone, less than 8% of the label in total cholesterol was found in the sterol nucleus of the esterified cholesterol. Rather, the majority of the cholesterol ester-bound radioactivity was incorporated into the fatty acid moiety. On the other hand, there was only a limited decrease in the esterification of absorbed [3H]cholesterol both when the rate of sterol synthesis was increased with 10 mM mevalonolactone and when it was inhibited with mevinolin. The data suggest that locally synthesized and absorbed cholesterol is organized in distinct functional pools with different degrees of esterification in the mucosal epithelial cell.", 
    "35": "The effect of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid (HMG) on serum cholesterol levels was investigated in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidaemic (WHHL) rabbits. Oral administration of HMG resulted in a reduction of serum cholesterol by 39%. Bile acid drainage, by means of either cholestyramine medication or partial ileal bypass (PIB) surgery, also led to significant reductions in circulating cholesterol, by 35 and 59% respectively. Intraperitoneal injection of HMG after PIB surgery further reduced serum cholesterol by 35%. Fibroblasts from the WHHL rabbits did not show high-affinity binding, uptake or degradation of 125I-labelled low density lipoprotein (LDL). The working mechanism of these lipid-lowering lowering therapies in WHHL rabbits is discussed in relation to recent literature. The significant reductions in circulating cholesterol induced by HMG warrant further investigation into the use of this compound in the management of familial hypercholesterolaemia.", 
    "36": "Rat liver microsomal 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase was activated by 50% at a concentration of 0.4 mM 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid (DPG) and by 11-fold at 10 mM DPG. DPG also prevented the inactivation of HMG-CoA reductase by ATP and Mg++. Rat liver microsomal HMG-CoA reductase prepared in the presence of 1 mM DPG was significantly more active than when prepared in the absence of DPG. Activation of the enzyme by DPG and protection of the enzyme against inhibition by ATP and Mg++ by DPG were also observed with solubilized HMG-CoA reductase.", 
    "37": "Measurement of mevalonic acid (MVA) concentrations in plasma or 24-h urine samples is shown to be useful in studies of the regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and cholesterol synthesis. Plasma MVA concentrations, measured either at 7-9 a.m. after an overnight fast, or throughout the 24-h cycle, were compared with cholesterol synthesis rates that were measured by the sterol balance method: plasma MVA concentrations were directly related to the rate of whole body cholesterol synthesis (r = 0.972; p less than 0.001; n = 18) over a tenfold range of cholesterol synthesis rates. Moreover, hourly examination of MVA concentrations throughout the day demonstrated that interventions such as fasting or cholesterol feeding cause suppression of the postmidnight diurnal rise in plasma MVA concentrations, with little change in the base-line of the rhythm. Thus, the daily rise and fall of plasma MVA appears to reflect changes in tissues and organs, such as the liver and intestine, that are known to be most sensitive to regulation by fasting or by dietary cholesterol. The hypothesis that short-term regulation of HMG-CoA reductase in tissues is quickly reflected by corresponding variations in plasma MVA was tested by using a specific inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, mevinolin, to block MVA synthesis. Mevinolin caused a dose-dependent lowering of plasma MVA after a single dose; and in patients who received the drug twice a day for 4 wk, it decreased 24-h urinary MVA output. Significant lowering of plasma cholesterol was achieved through administration of mevinolin at doses that only moderately limit MVA production.", 
    "38": "Combined drug therapy with cholestyramine and compactin was found to be extremely effective against heterozygous cases of familial hypercholesterolemia. With a single drug regimen, compactin at a dosage of 15 mg/day produced a cholesterol reduction of 23% (70 mg/dl) in cases of combined hyperlipidemia, while twice the dosage (30 mg/day) was needed to produce a comparable effect with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. When compaction was combined with cholestyramine (in a 4 g dose three times a day), the cholesterol-lowering effect of compactin was strongly improved with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia; half the dosage of compactin was enough to produce the additive effect compared with the effect produced by each single drug regimen.", 
    "39": "Mevinolin is a potent inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase; EC 1.1.1.34), an enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. We have been studying the hepatic distribution of reductase with immunofluorescence microscopy and liver ultrastructure with electron microscopy in normal and drug-treated rats. In control animals, only about 20% of the hepatocytes were reductase positive. These cells were localized in the periportal lobular zones. The numbers of positive hepatocytes in animals given mevinolin or cholestyramine (or both) were directly proportional to the activities of the HMG-CoA reductase determined biochemically. This induction of HMG-CoA reductase immunofluorescence was centered periportally. Rats given 0.075% mevinolin alone had a homogeneous distribution of reductase staining in their hepatocyte cytoplasm, whereas a combination of 0.25% mevinolin and 3% cholestyramine caused a 150-fold increase in enzyme activity and induced prominent juxtanuclear immunofluorescent globules of HMG-CoA reductase in all hepatocytes. With electron microscopy, these bodies were composed of tightly packed stacks of smooth endoplasmic reticulum cysternae and aggregates of branched smooth endoplasmic reticulum tubules. Our data suggest that a subpopulation of periportal rat hepatocytes may be uniquely specialized for cholesterol synthesis.", 
    "40": "Low density lipoprotein (LDL) processing was investigated in a human hepatoma-derived cell line, Hep G2. Hep G2 cells bound, internalized and degraded LDL via a saturable, high affinity (Kd approximately 2 X 10(-8)M) pathway similar to that present in other mammalian cells. Although 80% of the uptake and degradation of 125I-LDL was inhibited by 40-fold excess native LDL, the same concentration of methylated LDL, which cannot bind to LDL receptors, had virtually no effect on processing. When added at low concentrations, the lysosomotropic agent, chloroquine, inhibited degradation (I50 approximately 15 microM) without affecting the rate of lipoprotein internalization. Receptor activity was decreased 60% by preincubation of the cells in medium containing a source of cholesterol (LDL or unesterified cholesterol) and increased 1.7-fold by preincubation with compactin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. The Hep G2 cell line may prove a useful system both for the further study of hepatic lipoprotein metabolism and for the evaluation of new antihypercholesterolemic agents.", 
    "41": "The effects of the lipid-lowering agent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid (HMGA) on serum lipids and on biliary lipid composition were evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in normolipidemic volunteers. After 4 weeks of HMGA administration (1 g three times a day orally) serum total cholesterol showed a significant decrease with regard to both pretreatment values and corresponding values of controls. The bile lipid molar percentage composition and the cholesterol saturation index showed no modification after HMGA and did not differ from the values obtained in the placebo group. These findings indicate that HMGA exerts no adverse effects on bile lipid composition in humans, differing from other hypolipidemic drugs currently in clinical use, which increase the bile cholesterol saturation index.", 
    "42": "Previous studies have identified several cellular requirements for mevalonic acid that appear unrelated to cholesterol, dolichol, or ubiquinone. To search for other products of mevalonic acid that might account for these requirements we cultured Swiss 3T3 cells in the presence of mevinolin, an inhibitor of mevalonic acid biosynthesis, then labeled the cells with exogenous radioactive mevalonic acid. Upon analyzing the radioactive material formed, we found that 40-50% of it was not extractable into lipid solvents, and that most of the lipid-insoluble material behaved like protein when treated with sodium dodecyl sulfate:chloroform:phenol, RNase, or proteinase K. Further analysis by electrophoresis revealed that radioactivity was associated with a few specific proteins that had apparent molecular weights of 13,000-58,000. Control experiments indicated that authentic radioactive (R)-mevalonic acid was the active precursor. Other lines of evidence suggested that mevalonate was first converted to an isoprenoid compound, then covalently incorporated into proteins by way of a cycloheximide-insensitive mechanism. These results suggest that Swiss 3T3 cells possess novel metabolic products of mevalonic acid metabolism that are formed by post-translational incorporation of isoprenoids into specific cell proteins.", 
    "43": "The effect of compactin on hormonally induced lipogenesis and protein synthesis was studied in vitro in explants of mammary gland from mid-pregnant rabbits. Compactin blocks mevalonate synthesis by the specific inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, and in this system, culture with 10 microM compactin for 24, 48, and 72 h inhibited incorporation of [1-14C]acetate (but not [2-14C]mevalonate) into sterol by 98, 95, and 86%, respectively. Removal of compactin prior to assay rapidly reversed this effect and was associated with increased tissue 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity. Fatty acid synthesis (measured by incorporation of [1-14C]acetate or [4,5-3H]leucine) and protein synthesis (measured by incorporation of [4,5-3H]leucine) were both inhibited by around 50% after culture with compactin. This inhibition was not rapidly reversed by removal of compactin prior to assay, but it was prevented by inclusion of 1 mM mevalonolactone in the culture medium. After removal of compactin and continued culture in its absence for 24 h with hormones, the normal tissue capacity for fatty acid and protein synthesis was restored, indicating no permanent cell damage. The results suggest a specific requirement for mevalonate (or derived products) for the hormonal maintenance of the increased fatty acid and protein synthesis characteristic of the development of the mammary gland.", 
    "44": "Compactin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA) reductase, decreased cholesterol synthesis in intact Hep G2 cells. However, after the inhibitor was washed away, the HMG-CoA-reductase activity determined in the cell homogenate was found to be increased. Also the high-affinity association of LDL (low-density lipoprotein) to Hep G2 cells was elevated after incubation with compactin. Lipoprotein-depleted serum, present in the incubation medium, potentiated the compactin effect compared with incubation in the presence of human serum albumin. Addition of either mevalonate or LDL prevented the compactin-induced rise in activities of both HMG-CoA reductase and LDL receptor in a comparable manner. It is concluded that in this human hepatoma cell line, as in non-transformed cells, both endogenous mevalonate or mevalonate-derived products and exogenous cholesterol are able to modulate the HMG-CoA reductase activity as well as the LDL-receptor activity.", 
    "45": "A cell line, C100, resistant to 225 microM compactin, has been isolated which overproduces 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase approximately 100-fold compared to the parental cell line [E. Hardeman, H. Jenke and R. Simoni (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 1516-1520]. It is demonstrated that the overproduction of HMG-CoA reductase in these cells is the result of increased enzyme synthesis due to elevated levels of translatable mRNA. Furthermore, the apparent molecular weight of the in vitro translation product is 94,000, which agrees with the molecular weight of the in vivo synthesized HMG-CoA reductase protomer in C100 cells. However, a comparison of the Staphylococcus aureus V8 proteolysis patterns between the in vitro and in vivo translation products reveals structural differences which suggests in vivo post-translation modification(s). It is also demonstrated unequivocally, by comparing proteolytic cleavage patterns and pulse-chase experiments, that the previously reported 63,000-, 52,000-, and 38,000-Da polypeptides recognized by HMG-CoA reductase antiserum derive from the 94,000-Da protomer as a result of nonphysiological proteolysis. Finally, the types of regulatory mechanisms involved in both the induction and repression of the enzyme in the presence or absence of compactin were determined. Four biochemical parameters of HMG-CoA reductase were examined in variant and parental cells grown in the presence and absence of compactin: enzymatic activity, degradation rate, synthesis rate, and concentration of translatable mRNA. These studies revealed that changes in cellular HMG-CoA reductase content are a function of concurrent changes in the rates of enzyme degradation and synthesis. Changes in enzyme synthesis are due to alterations in the level of translatable mRNA.", 
    "46": "To assess the importance of de novo cholesterol synthesis for bile salt formation, the effects of ML-236B (an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase) on biliary excretion of bile salts and lipids were studied in rats with permanent catheters in bile duct, heart and duodenum. In rats having their bile diverted continuously for 8 days, duodenal administration of ML-236B (50 mg/kg) caused an immediate transient choleresis, which subsided after 2 h. Concomitant with the choleresis concentrations of bile salt, phospholipid and cholesterol fell, but this decrease was maintained for 6 h. Consequently, ML-236B inhibited biliary output salts and lipids from the second till the sixth hour after injection. The kinetics of biliary excretion of intravenously injected [14C]taurocholate were not affected by ML-236B administration. In rats having their biliary catheter connected to the duodenal catheter, or in rats with prolonged bile diversion but treated with mevalonolactone, ML-236B again caused a transient choleresis (having subsided after 2 h), but now did not affect biliary excretion of bile salts and lipids. It is concluded that (1) ML-236B causes a transient bile salt-independent choleresis, (2) ML-236B depresses excretion of bile salts and lipids by blocking mevalonate synthesis and not by blocking the bile salt or lipid transport, (3) biliary excretions of phospholipids and cholesterol partly depend on excretion of bile salt, and (4) in rats with a prolonged total bile diversion newly formed mevalonate is a major substrate for bile salt synthesis.", 
    "47": "Incubation of rat hepatocytes, prepared from rats fed a normal diet, with either human high density lipoproteins or lecithin dispersions resulted in a dose-and time-dependent increase in the specific activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase. Incubation of cells with both high density lipoprotein and lecithin dispersions resulted in an additive stimulation of enzymic activity. We used pulse and pulse-chase experiments, followed by immunoprecipitation of the radiolabeled reductase, to demonstrate that high density lipoproteins and lecithin dispersions resulted in increased rates of synthesis and decreased rates of degradation of the reductase. We also demonstrate, by the use of immunoblots, that the increased enzymic activity was paralleled by an equivalent increase in the mass of the reductase. Addition of human low density lipoprotein to rat hepatocytes resulted in a small decrease in both enzymic activity and enzyme synthesis.", 
    "48": "The polyene antibiotic filipin was used to visualize the presence and distribution of cholesterol in the plasma membrane of glutaraldehyde-fixed human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. Both compactin (ML-236B), a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, and 25-hydroxycholesterol reduced the content of filipin-cholesterol complexes in the plasma membrane of CLL cells grown in media supplemented with either 15% delipidized horse serum or 15% normal (whole) horse serum. The reduction due to compactin was reversed by the concomitant addition of mevalonolactone. The ability of compactin to reduce the relative cholesterol content (as judged by filipin labeling) in CLL cells grown in lipoprotein-containing (normal) serum suggest that either CLL cells are different from other cells in that they predominantly utilize endogenously synthesized cholesterol for incorporation into the plasma membrane, or that a separate pool of endogenously synthesized cholesterol provides cholesterol for the plasma membrane.", 
    "49": "The effect of a single injection of L-triiodothyronine (T3) on the levels of liver cholesterol and liver 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) has been studied in chicken. A minimal dose of 8 micrograms/animal produces its maximal effects after 12 h. T3 enhances both HMGR activity and cholesterol levels in liver. Both effects are suppressed when protein synthesis inhibitors (actinomycin D or cycloheximide) are administered along with the hormone. Solubilized and membrane-bound HMGR activities are equally influenced by the hormone. The in vitro addition of T3 does not affect the HMGR activity. It is concluded that T3 increases cholesterol biosynthesis in chicken liver through the activation of de novo protein synthesis.", 
    "50": "The pathogenesis of arteriosclerosis is not yet fully understood. The growing body of scientific information strongly indicates that the plasma lipoproteins are playing a crucial role in the development of this disease. We now have conclusive information that dietary cholesterol can produce arteriosclerosis in animals and its removal from the diet can result in regression of these lesions. Most importantly, we know that reducing plasma cholesterol in humans will prevent mortality and morbidity related to the clinical sequelae of arteriosclerosis. A diet can be prescribed that can produce profound reductions in lipoprotein levels in many individuals. The rate of success in achieving modifications that reduce plasma cholesterol is very high. Most patients over time find a diet with reduced cholesterol and saturated fat to be quite palatable. As food suppliers become more active in emphasizing low fat, low cholesterol products, and as restaurants see a demand for healthier entrees, the task for the physician and nutritionist will become much easier. Achieving sustained weight reduction is a much more difficult problem, but this too can be accomplished in many patients if the health professionals maintain a hopeful supportive approach. Ultimately, it is the patient's responsibility to bring about these lifestyle changes. It is the physician's and nutritionist's job to monitor the process and provide sound information and encouragement. For individuals with severe lipoprotein disorders such as familial hypercholesterolemia where diet therapy is helpful but not adequate, the use of medications is now indicated (bile acid binding resins and nicotinic acid). Other medications that promise additional effectiveness and safety are under development (Compactin, Mevinolin). It is our belief that control of coronary heart disease and stroke requires appropriate treatment of lipoprotein disorders and the methods for a strong beginning in this endeavor are at hand.", 
    "51": "Mevinolin inhibited the incorporation of [14C]acetate into cholesterol by human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMD macrophages) when both mevinolin and [14C]acetate were added simultaneously to the culture medium. Longer incubation with mevinolin, 24 h, led to a marked increase in the degradation of [125I]low density lipoprotein (LDL) via the high affinity receptor for LDL by HMD macrophages. Furthermore, this increased LDL receptor activity in cells incubated for 24 h with mevinolin and lipoprotein-depleted serum (LPDS) led to a nearly 3-fold increase in the formation of cholesteryl esters when these cells were then incubated with LDL for 24 h. Continuous exposure to mevinolin did not result in a constant increase in LDL receptor activity. Cells exposed to mevinolin for 24 h on day 3 had increased LDL receptor activity, but continuous exposure to mevinolin with 5% human serum (HS) from day 3-9 resulted in degradation of [125I]LDL at the same rate as observed in cells incubated with 5% HS alone. Cholesterol synthesis from [14C]acetate was decreased in cells incubated for 24 h in 5% HS + mevinolin compared with 5% HS alone, and in 10% LPDS + mevinolin compared with 10% LPDS alone; however, cells incubated with LPDS + mevinolin synthesized cholesterol at higher rates than did cells cultured in 5% HS alone. Continuous culture with 5% HS + mevinolin for 5 days resulted in cholesterol synthesis at control levels. These data show that following inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by mevinolin, HMD macrophages maintain cholesterol homeostasis by increasing LDL receptor activity to obtain cholesterol from LDL.", 
    "52": "The role of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in mediating the immunomodulatory effects of LDL was examined by comparing responses of normal lymphocytes with those obtained from a patient with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) lacking receptors for LDL. The function of LDL receptors in supporting lymphocyte growth was demonstrated by blocking endogenous sterol synthesis with mevinolin, a specific inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, and culturing cells in lipoprotein-deficient medium with supplemental LDL as the only source of cholesterol. Mevinolin inhibited mitogen-induced proliferation of normal and FH lymphocytes. Whereas inhibition was overcome by mevalonate, the product of the inhibited enzyme, low concentrations of LDL (less than 10 micrograms of protein/ml) restored the responses of normal but not FH lymphocytes. When normal and FH lymphocytes were cultured in the absence of mevinolin, high concentrations of LDL (greater than 100 micrograms of protein/ml) inhibited mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation. The inhibitory effects on normal and FH lymphocytes were similar in that both required comparably large concentrations of LDL and could be completely reversed by transferrin. When normal lymphocytes were cultured in serum-free medium supplemented with transferrin, low concentrations of LDL (less than 10 micrograms of protein/ml) caused marked augmentation of proliferation. By contrast, no enhancement of FH lymphocyte growth was observed. These results indicate that LDL-mediated enhancement of lymphocyte growth in the presence or absence of endogenous sterol biosynthesis involves specific receptors for LDL whereas the immunosuppression caused by LDL is independent of these receptors. Moreover, the results suggest that peripheral lymphocytes can be used to evaluate the functional integrity of the receptor-mediated uptake of LDL.", 
    "53": "Regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (EC 1.1.1.34, reductase) activity was studied in cultured rat intestinal epithelial cells using 3-beta-[2-(diethylamino)ethoxy]androst-5-en-17-one ( U18666A ), an inhibitor of 2,3- oxidosqualene cyclase (EC 5.4.99.7, cyclase) that causes cellular accumulation of squalene 2,3:22,23-dioxide ( Sexton , R. C., Panini , S.R., Azran , F., and Rudney , H. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 5687-5692). Treatment of cells with U18666A (5-50 ng/ml) caused a progressive inhibition of reductase activity. Further increases in the level of the drug paradoxically lessened the inhibition such that at a level of 1 microgram/ml, no inhibition of enzyme activity was observed. Cellular metabolism of squalene 2,3:22,23-dioxide to compounds with the chromatographic properties of polar sterols led to an inhibition of reductase activity that could be prevented by U18666A (1 microgram/ml). The drug was unable to prevent the inhibition of enzyme activity by 25-hydroxycholesterol or mevalonolactone, but totally abolished the inhibitory action of low density lipoproteins. Pretreatment with U18666A did not affect the ability of cells to degrade either the apoprotein or the cholesteryl ester component of low density lipoproteins. These results suggest that oxysterols derived from squalene 2,3:22,23-dioxide may act as physiological regulators of reductase and raise the possibility that the suppressive action of low density lipoproteins on reductase may be partially or wholly mediated by such endogenous oxysterols generated through incomplete inhibition of the cyclase.", 
    "54": "Rat hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase was purified to homogeneity using agarose-HMG-CoA affinity chromatography. Additional protein was isolated from the affinity column with 0.5 M KCl that demonstrated no HMG-CoA reductase activity, yet comigrated with purified HMG-CoA reductase on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. This protein was determined to be an inactive form of HMG-CoA reductase by tryptic peptide mapping, reaction with anti-HMG-CoA reductase antibody, and coelution with purified HMG-CoA reductase from a molecular-sieving high-performance liquid chromatography column. This inactive protein was present in at least fourfold greater concentration than active HMG-CoA reductase, and could not be activated by rat liver cytosolic phosphoprotein phosphatases. Immunotitration studies with microsomal and solubilized HMG-CoA reductase isolated in the presence and absence of proteinase inhibitors suggested that the inactive protein was not generated from active enzyme during isolation of microsomes or freeze-thaw solubilization of HMG CoA reductase.", 
    "55": "The effect of ML-236B, a specific inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, on serum lipids and plasma cortisol responses to ACTH were studied in 11 hypercholesterolemic patients. Mean serum total cholesterol decreased significantly [279 +/- 57 (SD) mg/dl to 213 +/- 48 mg/dl], as did serum triglycerides (211 +/- 140 mg/dl to 166 +/- 125 mg/dl) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (195 +/- 49 mg/dl to 139 +/- 47 mg/dl), after ML-236B treatment for 12 weeks in doses ranging from 15-60 mg/day. The mean basal plasma cortisol level was not changed after ML-236B treatment, but the mean absolute increment in plasma cortisol increased from 15.4 +/- 3.4 to 26.7 +/- 8.4 micrograms/dl (P less than 0.005) after treatment. These data demonstrate a new effect of a potent inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase in human adrenal tissue.", 
    "56": "The relation of cellular cholesterol content to a biochemical expression of astrocytic differentiation was investigated in cultured C-6 glial cells. The astrocytic marker, glutamine synthetase, was studied. Cellular sterol content was perturbed with compactin, a specific inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and, thereby, cholesterol biosynthesis. Depletion of cellular sterol resulted in 72 h in a more than twofold increase in glutamine synthetase activity. Production of various degrees of sterol depletion with different concentrations of compactin demonstrated a striking inverse relationship between glutamine synthetase activity and the cellular sterol/phospholipid molar ratio. That the effect of compactin, in fact, is mediated by depletion of sterol was shown further by prevention of the compactin-induced increase in synthetase activity by simultaneous addition of exogenous cholesterol. Moreover, addition of cholesterol alone to the culture medium led to both a decrease in glutamine synthetase activity and an increase in the sterol/phospholipid molar ratio. The possibility that the compactin-induced increase in glutamine synthetase activity is caused by an increase in synthesis of the enzyme was suggested by prevention of the increase by cycloheximide. The data suggest that astrocytic differentiation is stimulated by a decrease in cellular sterol content. When considered with our previous observation that oligodendroglial differentiation is inhibited by such a decrease, the findings suggest that cellular sterol content is a critical determinant of the direction of glial differentiation, i.e., whether along astrocytic or oligodendroglial lines.", 
    "57": "Mevinolin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, stimulated outgrowth of neurites and increased acetylcholinesterase activity in C1300-N2A murine neuroblastoma cells cultured in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Changes in cell morphology and enzyme activity were concentration-dependent in the range of 0.25-25 microM mevinolin, and were accompanied by decreased incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA. The expression of differentiated characteristics induced by 25 microM mevinolin was blocked by simultaneous addition of 100 microM mevalonate to the culture medium. The data suggest that changes in intracellular levels of mevalonate or one of its isoprenoid derivatives may play a role in the regulation of cell differentiation.", 
    "58": "3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (EC 1.1.1.3.4.) activity and cell membrane fluidity measured by fluorescence polarization using 1,6 diphenyl, 1,3,5-hexatriene as fluorescent probe have been concomitantly examined in HTC hepatoma cells, both in relation to growth rate and in response to treatment with hydroxylated sterols. A high level of HMG-CoA reductase activity was observed in cells at log phase of growth which progressively decreased to reach a sustained low level at stationary phase. Similarly, membrane fluidity markedly decreased in relation to growth rate. Hydroxylated sterols such as 7 beta-hydroxycholesterol or 25-hydroxycholesterol strongly inhibited HMG-CoA reductase activity whereas a water-soluble derivative of 7 beta-hydroxycholesterol sodium 3,7-bishemisuccinate had no effect. Within the same range of concentrations 7 beta-hydroxycholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol strongly decreased membrane fluidity when the water-soluble derivative was ineffective. Thus, the present results provide evidence for a correlation between the two tested parameters and suggest a dependency of HMG-CoA reductase activity on cell membrane fluidity.", 
    "59": "The kinetics of the apoprotein B (apo B) of very-low-density (VLDL; d less than 1.006) and low-density (LDL; d 1.019-1.063) lipoproteins were studied in six rabbits by using radioiodinated homologous lipoproteins, before and during oral administration of mevinolin (5 mg/kg per day), a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (EC 1.1.1.34), to explore the mechanism by which the drug reduces LDL synthesis. Before treatment LDL-apo B production greatly exceeded VLDL-apo B production in all animals, indicating that a large proportion of plasma LDL was derived from a VLDL-independent pathway. Five animals responded to mevinolin with a fall in plasma cholesterol (mean change - 53%; P less than 0.01). This was associated with a 66% decrease in LDL-apo B synthesis (P less than 0.05). In contrast, VLDL-apo B synthesis was unaffected by mevinolin. Furthermore, in all but one animal the decrement in LDL-apo B synthesis was greater than the rate of VLDL-apo B synthesis before treatment, demonstrating that mevinolin had reduced the VLDL-independent production of LDL.", 
    "60": "Patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) have a deficiency of receptors for plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) that impairs removal of LDL from plasma. In these patients, mevinolin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase [mevalonate:NAD+ oxidoreductase (CoA-acylating), EC 1.1.1.88], increases receptors for LDL and decreases LDL concentrations. To determine whether mevinolin also causes severe decreases in total body synthesis of cholesterol, fecal excretions of neutral steroids and acidic steroids were determined in five FH heterozygotes before and during treatment with mevinolin. The drug produced an average decrease in plasma total cholesterol of 23% and in LDL cholesterol of 24%. Mevinolin caused a significant decrease in the output of neutral and acidic steroids in three patients, but it caused no alterations in two others. Changes in fecal output of steroids did not correlate with the degree of lowering of the patients' LDL-cholesterol level. In none of the patients did the output of fecal steroids fall below the values seen in normal subjects studied under similar conditions. One patient had a previous ileal exclusion operation and had a massive output of acidic steroids in the control period; mevinolin therapy caused a slight decrease in excretion of acidic steroids, but the output was still markedly above normal. We conclude that the LDL lowering action of mevinolin does not appear to require a severe decrease in cholesterol synthesis that might lead to depletion of vital body stores of cholesterol.", 
    "61": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria was found in a newborn infant whose parents are first cousins. The patient presented at 5 days of life with hyperammonemia, hypoglycemia, and metabolic acidosis. There was no ketonuria. Diagnosis was made by analysis of the pattern of organic acids excreted in the urine. A profound deficiency in activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A lyase was found in cultured skin fibroblasts. The parents had intermediate levels of enzyme activity.", 
    "62": "The orientation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase within the endoplasmic reticulum was investigated. Microsomal reductase activity was not latent, as addition of various detergents failed to activate the enzyme. Reductase activity was readily inhibited in intact microsomes by impermeable inhibitors such as trypsin, mercury dextran and anti-reductase IgG. Under the conditions used, these agents did not affect the intactness of microsomes as determined by latency of mannose-6-phosphate phosphohydrolase activity. The sensitivity to these inhibitors was not increased in disrupted microsomes. It is concluded that the domain containing the active site of the reductase is situated on the cytosolic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum.", 
    "63": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase in the ileum of rats was inactivated by Mg2+-ATP and reversibly reactivated by cytoplasmic activator from the liver. The mevalonate kinase reaction was presumably not involved in this inactivation. Studies of nucleotide specificity for the inactivation revealed that ATP was most effective in the reaction among the nucleotides tested. In contrast to the hepatic microsomal HMG-CoA reductase, more than one-half of intestinal reductase existed in an active form. These observations indicated the presence of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation mechanism for modulation of intestinal HMG-CoA reductase.", 
    "64": "Relationships between mevalonate and DNA synthesis were explored in quiescent human fibroblasts stimulated with human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Studies of others have indicated that mevalonate, or a product of mevalonate other than cholesterol, is essential for DNA replication. The present studies were designed to determine whether there was a critical time in the cell cycle when mevalonate was necessary for later DNA synthesis to occur. Compactin and mevinolin, inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase, were employed to block both the synthesis of mevalonate and of DNA. Compactin inhibited the sharp peak of DNA synthesis which occurs in cells 24 h after PDGF addition in a concentration-dependent manner. This suppression of DNA synthesis was not prevented by low density lipoprotein but was fully reversed by mevalonate. Compactin inhibited DNA synthesis when the inhibitor was present during the time interval 10-20 h after PDGF addition. Its presence only in the interval before 10 h or after 20 h had no effect. Conversely, mevalonate could fully overcome the compactin block in DNA synthesis when present during the period of from 10-20 h after PDGF addition. Mevalonate present only before 10 h or after 20 h had no effect. When mevalonate was added to mevinolin-blocked cells for the interval 10-15 h after PDGF, the mevinolin block of DNA synthesis was 68% overcome; in contrast, only 20% of the reversal of the mevinolin block was seen when mevalonate was added from 15-20 h. Addition of mevalonate for only the 2-h interval of from 10-12 h after PDGF overcame the mevinolin block of DNA synthesis (assayed at 24 h) by 50%. The results show that there is a critical time period, several h before S phase, when PDGF-stimulated cells require mevalonate in order for DNA synthesis to proceed at 24 h. This critical period comprised the interval of approximately 10-20 h after PDGF addition and especially the early part of this interval.", 
    "65": "Studies of lipid metabolism in cell cultures are usually carried out after preincubation of cells in media containing lipoprotein-deficient or delipidated serum. The artifacts produced during delipidation prevent the standardization of assays and the study of the role of hormones on lipid metabolism. We studied the effects of triiodothyronine, hydrocortisone, insulin and their combination on cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis in cultured human skin fibroblasts preincubated for 24 h in an artificial medium (medium A) consisting of equal volumes of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's and Ham's F-12 media enriched with transferrin, biotin and calcium pantothenate. In cells preincubated in medium A the incorporation of acetate to cholesterol and the activity of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase were much lower than in cells preincubated in standard medium containing lipoprotein-deficient serum. Addition of the three hormones caused a marked stimulation of the incorporation of acetate to cholesterol (from 3.1 to 17.7 pmol/min per mg protein), an activity similar to that in cells preincubated in lipoprotein-deficient serum plus hormones. The stimulatory effect of the hormones on HMG-CoA reductase activity was smaller, from 11 to 26 pmol/min per mg protein compared to 83 pmol/min per mg protein in cells preincubated in lipoprotein-deficient serum plus hormones. Most of the stimulatory effect was due to insulin. The lack of coordinate response between these two parameters in cells preincubated in artificial medium could not be explained by (a) stimulation of a post-mevalonate step as measured by the incorporation of mevalonate to cholesterol; (b) the in vitro inactivation of HMG-CoA reductase by phosphorylation: incubation of fibroblast microsomes with Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase resulted in a decrease in HMG-CoA reductase activity, in contrast to an increase in hepatic microsomes; (c) the presence of inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase in the microsomal extract. In cells preincubated in medium A the incorporation of acetate to fatty acids and the activities of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase were approximately equal to that of cells preincubated in standard medium containing lipoprotein-deficient serum. Hormones added to medium A caused a stimulation of incorporation of acetate to fatty acids (from 5.1 to 19.8 pmol/min per mg protein), the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (from 494 to 820 pmol/min per mg protein) and of fatty acid synthetase (from 300 to 678 pmol/mg protein). These values were significantly higher than those obtained in cells preincubated with lipoprotein-deficient serum with or without hormones.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "66": "Both 5% cholesterol feeding and fasting produced a decrease in the hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity, although certain diurnal variations remained during the second day of treatment. Supplementation of 5% cholesterol to the diet produced a significant increase in cholesterol content of hepatic microsomes, whereas no significant variations were observed after fasting. The phospholipid content of hepatic microsomes did not change by fasting. However, cholesterol feeding produced a clear decrease in microsomal phospholipids. After 7 hr of cholesterol feeding, an increase of nearly 3-fold in the cholesterol/lipidic phosphorus molar ratio was found. Fasting had no effect on this molar ratio. The changes observed by cholesterol feeding agree with a mechanism of regulation of hepatic reductase by alteration in membrane fluidity, a mechanism that would be already operative during the neonatal period.", 
    "67": "The information reviewed here indicates that LDL receptor activity in vivo is regulated in normal animals and probably in normal humans. Furthermore, LDL receptor activity is also regulated in patients with heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia. Our experiments in patients with this disease indicate that one can exploit the normal regulation of receptor synthesis to stimulate the single normal gene in these patients to produce an increased number of LDL receptors. This stimulation can be accomplished by manipulating the intracellular cholesterol pools in the liver with drugs that inhibit HMG-CoA reductase and by maneuvers that result in bile acid depletion. These therapeutic measures are most effective when combined. Such therapy is likely to be beneficial, particularly since the results of the Lipid Research Clinics Primary Intervention Trial using the bile acid sequestrant, cholestyramine, have demonstrated that lowering LDL-cholesterol levels with this drug also lowers the incidence of coronary heart disease. In a broader sense, the success of this regulatory manipulation suggests that other genetic diseases may be treated by manipulation of regulatory signals that control the rates of synthesis of gene products.", 
    "68": "The mechanism of deregulation of cholesterol metabolism was studied in fast and slow growing nude mouse tumors and cancer cells in culture derived from azaserine-induced rat pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma. The tumors showed a loss of feedback control of the de novo synthesis of cholesterol, probably due to a loss of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors on plasma membranes or to a defect in the binding and internalization of LDL in the cancer cells. The hexosemonophosphate shunt pathway is stimulated in the cancer cells, presumably because of an increased demand for NADPH in cholesterol synthesis and for ribose phosphate in DNA synthesis. The uncontrolled de novo synthesis of cholesterol is one of the factors responsible for the high rate of cell proliferation in the tumors.", 
    "69": "Bifonazole, a new broad-spectrum antimycotic, interferes with sterol biosynthesis. Compared to clotrimazole, the primary mode of action of these two antimycotics is accepted to represent inhibition of the cytochrome P450-dependent hydroxylation at the sterol-C14-methyl group, which is the first step in C14-demethylation reaction. At least in dermatophytes bifonazole additionally inhibits directly HMG-CoA-reductase, the starting and regulatory enzyme in terpenoid biosynthesis, whereas after application of clotrimazole the activity of HMG-CoA-reductase is only decreased by feed-back control, resulting from accumulation of dihydrolanosterol. The inhibition of HMG-CoA-reductase obviously is pathogen specific as the mammalian enzyme is not affected. By this, in contrast to clotrimazole, bifonazole possesses a sequential mode of action, namely inhibition of cytochrome P450-dependent C14-demethylation of sterols and direct inhibition of HMG-CoA-reductase. In vitro bifonazole shows a strongly pH-dependent efficacy. The uptake kinetics of bifonazole have been measured with different pathogens. With respect to budding cells of Candida albicans it can be shown that the pH dependence of efficacy is due to a parallel pH dependence of the intracellular concentration of active ingredient. Even sublethal concentrations of bifonazole cause prior damages of young cells of C. albicans. These effects might explain the loss of infectivity of C. albicans after incubation with sublethal concentrations of bifonazole.", 
    "70": "Bifonazole (Bay h 4502, Mycospor) and clotrimazole (Bay b 5097, Canesten) are potent inhibitors of ergosterol synthesis in yeasts and dermatophytes. Inhibition of demethylation of 4,4',14-trimethylsterols is accepted as primary mode of action responsible for their fungistatic efficacy. In Candida albicans, Microsporum canis, Trichophyton mentagrophytes as well as in Epidermophyton floccosum the ergosterol precursor 24-methylendihydrolanosterol accumulates, whereas in Torulopsis glabrata lanosterol accumulation occurs, due to the fact that in this organism side chain alkylation proceeds after demethylation reactions. Bifonazole additionally leads to a generally decreased rate of sterol biosynthesis as compared to clotrimazole, due to a direct inhibition of microsomal HMG-CoA-reductase. The additional fungicidal effects of bifonazole are considered to originate from a sequential action by inhibition of HMG-CoA-reductase and of cytochrome P450.", 
    "71": "A number of glycoproteins have oligosaccharides linked to protein in a GlcNAc----asparagine bond. These oligosaccharides may be either of the complex, the high-mannose or the hybrid structure. Each type of oligosaccharides is initially biosynthesized via lipid-linked oligosaccharides to form a Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-pyrophosphoryl-dolichol and transfer of this oligosaccharide to protein. The oligosaccharide portion is then processed, first of all by removal of all three glucose residues to give a Man9GlcNAc2-protein. This structure may be the immediate precursor to the high-mannose structure or it may be further processed by the removal of a number of mannose residues. Initially four alpha 1,2-linked mannoses are removed to give a Man5 - GlcNAc2 -protein which is then lengthened by the addition of a GlcNAc residue. This new structure, the GlcNAc- Man5 - GlcNAc2 -protein, is the substrate for mannosidase II which removes the alpha 1,3- and alpha 1,6-linked mannoses . Then the other sugars, GlcNAc, galactose, and sialic acid, are added sequentially to give the complex types of glycoproteins. A number of inhibitors have been identified that interfere with glycoprotein biosynthesis, processing, or transport. Some of these inhibitors have been valuable tools to study the reaction pathways while others have been extremely useful for examining the role of carbohydrate in glycoprotein function. For example, tunicamycin and its analogs prevent protein glycosylation by inhibiting the first step in the lipid-linked pathway, i.e., the formation of Glc NAc-pyrophosphoryl-dolichol. These antibiotics have been widely used in a number of functional studies. Another antibiotic that inhibits the lipid-linked saccharide pathway is amphomycin, which blocks the formation of dolichyl-phosphoryl-mannose. In vitro, this antibiotic gives rise to a Man5GlcNAc2 -pyrophosphoryl-dolichol from GDP-[14C]mannose, indicating that the first five mannose residues come directly from GDP-mannose rather than from dolichyl-phosphoryl-mannose. Other antibodies that have been shown to act at the lipid-level are diumycin , tsushimycin , tridecaptin, and flavomycin. In addition to these types of compounds, a number of sugar analogs such as 2-deoxyglucose, fluoroglucose , glucosamine, etc. have been utilized in some interesting experiments. Several compounds have been shown to inhibit glycoprotein processing. One of these, the alkaloid swainsonine , inhibits mannosidase II that removes alpha-1,3 and alpha-1,6 mannose residues from the GlcNAc- Man5GlcNAc2 -peptide. Thus, in cultured cells or in enveloped viruses, swainsonine causes the formation of a hybrid structure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "72": "Methyl (RS)-5-bromo-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-pentanoate was prepared by bromination of methyl mevalonate and used for the formation of 4-carboxy-3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyl thioether derivatives by reaction with N-octanoyl-cysteamine, pantetheine, phosphopantetheine and coenzyme A. These thiols were also converted to the (RS)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl thioester derivatives. The thioesters formed with pantetheine and phosphopantetheine are substrates of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase; Km and V values are similar to those of the superior CoA-derivative. The corresponding thioether derivatives in which the oxygen next to sulfur of the substrates is replaced by hydrogen, are inhibitors of the reductase. The inhibition is competitive with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA varied, and noncompetitive with NADPH varied. For each of the corresponding pairs of thioester and thioether derivatives Km (substrate) is nearly identical with Ki (inhibitor). The specificity and stereospecificity of the inhibitor action are also shown.", 
    "73": "Mevinolin is a fungal metabolite, and in the hydroxyacid form, mevinolinic acid, it is an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-Co A) reductase, an enzyme essential in cholesterol biosynthesis. Oral administration of 800 mg/kg/day of mevinolin to rats from days 6 through 17 of gestation produced fetal malformations of the vertebrae and ribs in 29% of the litters, and there was a treatment-related increase in the incidence of gastroschisis. Mevinolinic acid at 60 and 90 mg/kg/day also produced fetal malformations of the vertebrae and ribs, and these teratogenic manifestations were markedly suppressed by coadministration of the product of HMG-Co A reductase, mevalonic acid, at a dosage level of 500 mg/kg b.i.d. A diet supplemented with 0.5% or 1.0% cholesterol had no effect on the teratogenicity of mevinolinic acid. Teratology studies in rats with a dihydroxyheptanoic acid derivative of mevinolin, a compound 1/700 as potent as mevinolinic acid as an inhibitor of HMG-Co A reductase, and dihydromevinolinic acid, an inhibitor of this enzyme comparable in activity to mevinolinic acid, indicated that the teratogenicity of these compounds was related to their relative enzyme inhibitory activity. The dihydroxyheptanoic acid derivative was not teratogenic at doses as high as 150 mg/kg b.i.d.; in contrast, when dihydromevinolinic acid was administered at 50 and 100 mg/kg/day, its potency as a teratogenic agent was comparable to that of mevinolinic acid. These studies demonstrated that inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase produced terata in rats and that the teratogenic effects could be antagonized by coadministration of the enzyme product, mevalonic acid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "74": "Granulosa and luteal cells from immature, hormone-primed hamsters increased progesterone production in response to luteinizing hormone (LH) in a dose-dependent manner. Both cell types responded to 8-bromoadenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP) with increased progesterone production. Lipoproteins (hamster or human) did not enhance progesterone production by either cell type in the presence of LH during short-term incubation; human high-density lipoprotein (HDL) inhibited progestin production. Compactin, an inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis, had no significant effect on progesterone production by either cell type. Granulosa and luteal cells increased progesterone production in response to 25-OH-cholesterol. The response to 25-OH-cholesterol was more rapid than that to LH. Increased progestin levels were apparent within 15 min of incubation whereas a response to LH was not seen until 30 min. LH in combination with 25-OH-cholesterol did not increase progesterone production above that seen with either agent alone. Cycloheximide blocked LH-stimulated steroidogenesis but not 25-OH-cholesterol-stimulated progestin production in both cell types. We conclude that 1) hamster granulosa and luteal cells rely upon endogenous, preformed cholesterol for the acute steroidogenic response to LH and 2) LH-stimulated steroidogenesis, but not 25-OH-cholesterol-stimulated steroidogenesis, is a cycloheximide-sensitive process which presumably involves an increase in the access of cellular cholesterol to the side-chain cleavage system.", 
    "75": "The sodium salt of (Z)-3-hydroxy-3-(2-hydroxycyclohexyl)butyric acid (I) and its lactone (II) were prepared through the corresponding tert-butyl ester by hydrogenation, over Rh/Al2O3 catalyst, of the phenyl ring of tert-butyl 3-hydroxy-3-(2-hydroxyphenyl)butyrate (III). (Z)-3-Hydroxy-3-(2-methoxycyclohexyl)butyric acid was prepared similarly. (Z)-4-Methyloctahydro-2H-1-benzopyran-2-one was prepared by hydrogenation, over Rh/Al2O3 catalyst, of 4-methylcoumarine, prepared in turn from III by a one-pot procedure comprising hydrolysis, lactonization, and dehydration. The above compounds inhibit acetate incorporation in cholesterol and fatty acids in rat liver slices at 5 X 10(-3) M, but they lack specific inhibitory activity on HMG-CoA reductase.", 
    "76": "Pores formed in the membranes of animal cells by complexes of sterols and the polyene antibiotic amphotericin B can efficiently kill the cells. Thus, in the absence of exogenous sources of cholesterol, inhibitors of enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway render cells resistant to amphotericin B. Preincubation of Chinese hamster ovary cells with compactin or 25-hydroxycholesterol, inhibitors of the synthesis of the key intermediate mevalonate, protected cells from amphotericin B killing and this protection was reversed by the addition of exogenous mevalonate. The ability of compactin to confer amphotericin B resistance on normal cells was abolished when cells were provided exogenous cholesterol by the receptor-mediated endocytosis of low density lipoprotein. Low density lipoprotein receptor-defective Chinese hamster ovary cells were not subject to this low density lipoprotein-dependent amphotericin B killing. Exogenous mevalonate did not prevent 4,4,10 beta-trimethyl-trans-decal-3 beta-ol, an inhibitor of mevalonate conversion to sterols, from protecting cells from amphotericin B. A simple two-step protocol in which cells are preincubated (15-24 h) with potential inhibitors and then treated (3-6 h) with amphotericin B was devised to provide a sensitive method for detecting direct (e.g., competitive) and regulatory inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis. This protocol may prove useful in detecting potential antihypercholesterolemia drugs and is currently being used to isolate mutants in receptor-mediated endocytosis.", 
    "77": "By gas chromatographic mass spectrometric analysis, 3-hydroxy-3-ethylglutaric acid was identified in the urine of patients with propionyl CoA carboxylase deficiency. Simultaneously, large amounts of 3-hydroxyvaleric acid and 3-oxovaleric acid, as well as a number of metabolites previously well known in this disorder, were also found in the urine of the patients. It is suggested that formation of 3-oxovaleric acid and 3-hydroxyvaleric acid proceeds via 3-hydroxy-3-ethylglutaryl CoA as an intermediate by a mechanism similar to that of ketone body formation.",

    "79": "Mutants resistant to ML236B (compactin) were isolated from the Chinese hamster lung V79 cell line (1). Three ML236B-resistant mutants, MF-1, MF-2 and MF-3, were enhanced in insulin-specific binding activity about 2 to 3 times over the parental V79 cell lines. Compared to V79, endocytosis of insulin was also increased 2 to 3-fold in ML236B-resistant mutants than V79. Scatchard analysis showed that 5,000 insulin binding sites per cell in V79 and 16,000 in a NL236B-resistant clone, MF-2. Insulin receptors in mutant and parental strains are down-regulated to a similar extent in the parental V79 treated with an excess insulin. This is the first somatic cell mutant with increased surface binding sites for insulin.", 
    "80": "Rabbits fed a wheat starch-casein diet develop a marked hypercholesterolemia and have a slower rate of removal of rabbit 125I-labeled low density lipoproteins (LDL) from plasma. Treating rabbits with mevinolin, a highly potent competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, at a daily dose of 20 mg per animal prevents the increase in plasma and LDL cholesterol. The mevinolin effect is mediated through an increased rate of removal of rabbit 125I-labeled LDL from plasma. To study the role of mevinolin on the regulation of the hepatic LDL receptor in rabbits, the binding of 125I-labeled LDL and 125I-labeled beta-VLDL (beta-migrating very-low-density lipoproteins) to liver membranes prepared from rabbits fed the wheat starch-casein diet with or without mevinolin was investigated. Liver membranes from wheat starch-casein-fed rabbits have no demonstrable EDTA-sensitive binding activity of 125I-labeled LDL and low (37 ng/mg protein) binding activity of 125I-labeled beta-VLDL. Treatment of the wheat starch-casein fed rabbits with mevinolin results in high levels of specific EDTA-sensitive binding of 125I-labeled LDL (28.7 ng/mg protein) and 125I-labeled beta-VLDL (120 ng/mg protein). To assess the functional role of the hepatic LDL receptor in response to mevinolin, the catabolism of 125I-labeled LDL by perfused rabbit livers was studied. Perfused livers from mevinolin-treated rabbits show a 3.3-fold increase in the rate of receptor-dependent catabolism of 125I-labeled LDL (4.6% X h-1) when compared with that of livers from rabbits not treated with mevinolin (1.4% X h-1). Thus, these studies demonstrate that mevinolin prevents the increase of plasma LDL cholesterol level in rabbits fed a wheat starch-casein diet by regulating the levels of hepatic LDL-binding sites and the rate of receptor-dependent catabolism of LDL by the liver."
