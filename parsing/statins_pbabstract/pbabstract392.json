    "0": "The synthesis and biological activity of a series of seco-oxysterol analogs designed to be inhibitors of transcription of the gene for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) are described. The compound possessing the most significant activity, [1 alpha (E),4 beta]-3-[2-(4- hydroxy-1-methylcyclohexyl)ethenyl]-alpha,alpha-dimethylbenzenepentan ol (4, U-88156), inhibited (IC50 = 10 microM) the expression of beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) in a transfected human HepG2 cell line wherein the beta-gal gene was driven by a 5 kB segment of the promoter for hamster HMGR. Furthermore, using wild-type HepG2 cells, it was shown that 10 microM 4 reduced HMGR mRNA levels by 73% while stimulating LDL-receptor activity by 47%. In the same system, the related oxysterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol (1), at 10 microM lowered both HMGR mRNA levels and LDL-receptor activity by 58% and 64%, respectively. Overall HMGR activity in wild-type HepG2 cells was inhibited 30% by 4 at 10 microM. These findings collectively demonstrate that a seco-oxysterol analog is capable of regulating HMGR gene expression and that this regulation can occur without a concomitant attenuation of the level of LDL-receptor activity.", 
    "1": "Hyperlipidemia is common in heart transplant patients. Lipid-lowering therapy poses special problems, yet may be important because accelerated graft atherosclerosis is the major factor limiting long-term survival. Simvastatin 5 mg/day was started > 6 months after surgery in 26 consecutive cardiac transplant recipients with a total serum cholesterol level of > 250 mg/dl. The dose of simvastatin was increased in 5-mg increments until total serum cholesterol fell below 220 mg/dl or until side effects developed or up to a maximal dose of 20 mg/day. The final average daily dose was 10 mg. Changes in serum lipid levels after 6 months of therapy were compared with data from a matched and concurrent control group of heart transplant patients not taking simvastatin. Immunosuppression for both groups consisted of CsA, AZA, and corticosteroids. In the simvastatin-treated group, the serum level of total cholesterol decreased by 27% from 315 +/- 53 to 230 +/- 38 mg/dl (P < 0.0001), low density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased by 40% from 205 +/- 30 to 123 +/- 32 mg/dl (P < 0.0001), and triglycerides decreased by 21% from 177 +/- 89 to 140 +/- 49 mg/dl (P < 0.01). There was no significant change in high density lipoprotein cholesterol level. Body weight and CsA blood levels remained stable. Steroid intake decreased during the study period to a similar extent in both the treated and the control groups. In the control group, no significant changes in serum lipid levels were observed. Two patients experienced a mild form of myotoxicity. In one other patient simvastatin treatment was stopped after an acute pancreatitis of uncertain etiology developed. Low dose simvastatin effectively lowers total serum cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides in heart transplant patients. With due precautions, the safety profile of the drug in this patient population seems reasonable.", 
    "2": "Seventy-four patients with plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels > or = 160 mg/dl after an American Heart Association phase 1 diet were randomized to double-blind treatment with fluvastatin, 20 mg/day, or placebo for 6 weeks. Immediate-release niacin was then added to both treatment regimens and titrated to a maximum of 3 g/day for a further 9 weeks. After 6 weeks of fluvastatin monotherapy, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased by 21% (p < 0.001 vs placebo), and after the addition of niacin, response was potentiated to 40% compared with 25% for the niacin control group at study end point (p < 0.001). Fluvastatin, alone and in combination with niacin, also significantly improved high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (increases of about 30%) and triglyceride profiles (decreases of approximately 28%) from baseline. Lipoprotein(a) decreased by 37% in those receiving fluvastatin-niacin but was unaltered in those receiving fluvastatin alone. No serious adverse events were ascribed to fluvastatin, and no cases of myositis were observed. Small, transient, asymptomatic increases in aspartate aminotransferase were noted with fluvastatin-niacin treatment but were not considered clinically relevant. Although the fluvastatin-niacin combination in this study was without evidence of significant transaminitis, myopathy, or rhabdomyolysis, it would seem prudent to continue to monitor its safety with longer term use. In conclusion, fluvastatin, both as monotherapy and in combination with niacin, proved to be an effective, safe, and well-tolerated therapeutic alternative for hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "3": "Little is known regarding the regulation of expression of the RHOA protooncogene, a member of the family of genes encoding Ras-related GTP-binding proteins. We have previously reported that the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of RHOA was contained within a genomic sequence which flanked the 5' end of the human glutathione peroxidase 1-encoding gene [J.A. Moscow et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267 (1992) 5949-5958]. Our previous studies revealed the presence of multiple (1.8 and 1.5 kb) RHOA mRNA species in breast cancer cell lines and of three putative polyadenylation signals in the RHOA 3' UTR. In this report, we have isolated several RHOA cDNAs from a multidrug-resistant MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line. Sequence analyses of these RHOA cDNA clones indicate that multiple polyadenylation signals are used to terminate RHOA transcripts. RNase-protection analysis demonstrated that all three polyadenylation signals are utilized in breast cancer cell lines and RNA stability studies demonstrated that RHOA RNA species with different 3' ends have equivalent stability. Since little is known about the RNA expression of RHOA in human tumors, and since both activated and non-activated RHOA genes possess transformation potential, we analyzed RHOA mRNA in lung and colon tumors by Northern blot and RNase-protection analyses. In all eight lung tumors examined, RHOA RNA levels were decreased relative to the level in normal surrounding tissue, whereas RHOA expression was decreased in only two of six colon tumors. We also found that lovastatin-induced cell cycle arrest resulted in increased RHOA RNA expression in breast cancer cell lines.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "4": "Lovastatin, a cholesterol-lowering drug, decreased plasma cholesterol and cardiac tissue coenzyme Q10 levels in guinea pigs given 20 mg per kg body weight twice a day. Plasma cholesterol levels were reduced 40% in animals 2 to 4 months of age and 61% in animals 2 years of age. Coenzyme Q10 values in cardiac muscle and cardiac mitochondria of the treated, older group were decreased 31% and 37%, respectively. A significant decrease was not observed in coenzyme Q10 levels of the younger animal group. The potential to phosphorylate ADP to ATP driven by pyruvate-malate and succinate oxidation was decreased 43% and 45%, respectively, for cardiac mitochondria from the treated, 2-year-old animals. A decrease in phosphorylation potential was not observed for the younger group. The respiratory burst of leukocytes isolated from the intraperitoneal cavities of the treated, older animals was decreased 67%, while leukocytes isolated directly from their blood was decreased 76% (Diebold, B., Bhagavan, N. and Guillory, R. (1991) FASEB J. 5, A1203). In contrast to the intact leukocytes, the superoxide production of the cell-free systems prepared from leukocytes isolated from treated and untreated animals did not differ significantly. These observations suggest that in vivo lovastatin may not directly affect the leukocyte superoxide generating system, but may influence it indirectly possibly by modifying the lipid content of the membrane.", 
    "5": "N-[(1,5,9)-trimethyldecyl]-4 alpha,10-dimethyl-8-aza-trans-decal-3 beta-ol (8-azadecalin 1), a high-energy intermediate analogue for the 2,3-oxidosqualene-lanosterol cyclase, was found to be a powerful (IC50 approximately 0.1 microM) inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. In analogy with other mammalian cells grown in the presence of cyclase inhibitors, the decrease in C27-sterol formation was accompanied by an accumulation of 2,3-oxidosqualene, 2,3:22, 23-dioxidosqualene, and by the formation of a compound characterized as 24,25-epoxycholesterol, a repressor of HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase activity. In order to assess the cyclase as a potential pharmacological target for the design of hypocholesterolemic drugs, it is important to test whether inhibitors of this enzyme are able to act synergistically on the biosynthesis of cholesterol, i.e. by decreasing the amount of lanosterol formed and by repressing the regulatory HMG-CoA reductase via the formation of regulatory oxysterols. The accumulation of 24,25-epoxycholesterol in relationship to the decrease of C27-sterol biosynthesis and of HMG-CoA reductase activity showed only a partial correlation: e.g. at [1] = 100 x IC50 only a 50% reduction in enzyme activity could be attained. In contrast, when HepG2 cells were treated with 2,3:22,23-dioxidosqualene or 24,25-epoxycholesterol, excellent correlations were found between the inhibition of C27-sterol biosynthesis and the repression of HMG-CoA reductase activity, which was almost complete at the highest concentrations of these epoxides (10(-5) M). Altogether, our results suggest that treatment of HepG2 cells with a cyclase inhibitor such as 8-azadecalin (1) does not lead to an intracellular accumulation of repressor molecules high enough to fully trigger a regulatory pathway resulting in a complete down-regulation of HMG-CoA reductase. At intermediary concentrations of cyclase inhibitors (IC50), however, a synergistic mode of action of these inhibitors seems plausible.", 
    "6": "The regulation of mevalonic acid synthesis requires both nonsterol isopentenoid and sterol regulatory signal molecules. A primary target of this multivalent control process is the enzyme which catalyzes mevalonate synthesis: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (EC 1.1.1.34). In this report Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin perforated Chinese hamster ovary cells were used to facilitate the identification of isopentenoidogenic reactions and metabolites required for mevalonate-mediated loss of HMG-CoA reductase activity. alpha-Toxin-perforated cells retained the capacity to decrease, upon demand, HMG-CoA reductase activity and protein in response to mevalonate or isopentenoid pyrophosphate esters. Also, it was deduced with highly specific metabolic inhibitors, that conversion of farnesyl 1-diphosphate to squalene was required for mevalonate-mediated suppression of reductase activity. Since squalene (2 microM) did not downregulate reductase activity, pre-squalene pyrophosphate or a derivative, or polyprenyl-1-pyrophosphate-generated inorganic pyrophosphate, or a combination of these metabolites are proposed as candidate regulatory nonsterol isopentenoid signal molecules.", 
    "7": "Tamoxifen (TAM)-induced changes in proliferation kinetics of the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 were investigated using dual parameter flow cytometry (FCM) of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) immunolabelling and of the expression of cell-cycle related proteins (the proliferating cell nuclear antigen, PCNA, and the non proliferation-specific protein, Statin), versus the DNA content. Single-parameter FCM DNA histograms confirmed that after 96 hours of treatment with 10(-7) M TAM the fraction of S-phase cells decreased significantly, with a simultaneous accumulation of cells in the G(0)/G(1) range of DNA content. In dual-parameter FCM cytograms, the fraction of BrdU-positive cells after TAM exposure was significantly lower than in the controls, and no unlabeled S-phase cells were found. The TAM-induced block in G(0)/G(1) phase was paralleled by a decrease in the number of cells with a DNA content typical of the S-phase expressing PCNA, and by an increase in Statin-positive (G(0)) cells. Upon readdition of 10(-9) M 17 beta-estradiol (E2) to the TAM-treated cultures, BrdU-labelling as well as PCNA expression levels increased significantly, whereas the fraction of Statin-positive cells remained higher than in the controls. The results obtained confirm that the TAM-induced inhibition of cell growth is associated with major changes in the cell cycle parameters of MCF-7 cells, and provide experimental evidence that two main mechanisms are operating: the accumulation of cells in G(1), before the onset of S-phase, and the exit of some cells from the cycling compartment; however, some of those that are blocked at G(0); cannot be totally reversed by estrogens and may be permanent; These data should be taken into account in the attempt to combine the antiestrogen treatment with chemotherapy more effectively.", 
    "8": "Mutated ras genes are found in a variety of human tumors. For biological activity the gene product p21 ras needs to be bound to the cell membrane by a farnesyl residue. Treatment of tumor cells with lovastatin reduces the availability of farnesyl pyrophosphate for the modification of the ras proteins. The membrane localization of p21 ras has been reduced by 30-36% after the tumor cells have grown in the presence of 10 microM lovastatin for 7 days. The extent of the inhibition depends on the growth kinetics of the cell lines.",

It usually presents with episodic biliary pains (colics), and postprandial dyspepsia (bloating and indigestion).

    "14": "The lipid profiles of 192 patients with functioning renal transplants and their etiologic associations and response to therapy, in particular simvastatin, were assessed. Hypercholesterolemia was present in 71.3% of patients within 3 years following transplantation. There were independent associations of serum cholesterol with prednisone dosage (p < 0.05), renal function (p < 0.05), and smoking (p < 0.05) in the early posttransplant period (up to 3 months posttransplant). Those patients whose immunosuppression included cyclosporin had lower serum cholesterol levels than those receiving azathioprine and prednisone (p < 0.02). Plasma triglyceride levels reflected a marked interindividual variation, and no independent correlations were observed. The presence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension (or the use of antihypertensive agents), or the form or duration of prior dialysis did not independently influence the lipid profiles. During the study period 22 patients died, 54.5% due to vascular causes. Those who died of vascular causes had higher serum cholesterol levels than those who died of other causes, which reached statistical significance at 3 years posttransplant (7.74 +/- 0.4 versus 5.5 +/- 0.52 mmol/L; p < 0.02). Cholestyramine was introduced in 30 patients, only 2 of whom continued with therapy beyond 3 months. Simvastatin was used in 43 patients, 20 of whom were receiving cyclosporin, resulting in a mean reduction in serum cholesterol of 16.5% (p < 0.001) and in serum triglycerides of 21% (p < 0.05). No clinical or biochemical evidence of muscle, liver, or renal toxicity occurred in 15.4 +/- 0.9 months of follow-up.",

    "16": "Two hundred seventy subjects, 37 to 67 years old, with plasma total cholesterol (TC) 190 to 295 mg/dL (4.91 to 7.63 mmol/L) and total triglyceride < 500 mg/dL (5.65 mmol/L) were randomized to low-fat, low-cholesterol diet and either lovastatin 80 mg/d or placebo. Logistic regression was used to model the association between risk factors and coronary lesion progression in mild/moderate (< 50% S) and severe (> or = 50% S) lesions in 220 angiogram pairs analyzed by computer quantitative coronary angiography. In the placebo group, risk factors (P < .05) for the progression of mild/moderate lesions were triglycerides and TC/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Risk factors for the progression of severe lesions were HDL-C (negative), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)/HDL-C, and TC/HDL-C. TC/HDL-C was the predominant risk factor for both mild/moderate and severe lesions in the multivariate analysis. In the lovastatin group, with aggressive lowering of LDL-C and TC below 85 mg/dL and 156 mg/dL, respectively, risk factors for mild/moderate lesions included triglycerides and very-low-density lipoprotein-LDL-associated apolipoprotein C-III (apo C-III-heparin precipitate), a marker of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles. Apo C-III-heparin precipitate was the predominant risk factor in the multivariate analysis. Risk factors for severe lesions were LDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C, TC/HDL-C, and apo B; LDL-C/HDL-C was the predominant risk factor.", 
    "17": "These results indicate that triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and cholesterol-rich lipoproteins have a differential effect on mild/moderate and severe lesion progression, respectively.

    "18": "Mevalonic acid is a product of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase which is essential for cholesterol biosynthesis. Fluvastatin (Sandoz compound XU 62-320) is a potent inhibitor of this enzyme and, hence, mevalonic acid production. In three separate studies, oral administration of fluvastatin at 12 and 24 mg/kg/day to mated rats from day 15 of gestation through weaning resulted in unanticipated maternal mortality at the time of parturition and during lactation. Microscopic evaluations performed in two studies revealed significant cardiac myopathy in the dying animals. Drug-related clinical signs, significant maternal body weight loss, and an increase in stillborn pups and neonatal mortality were also noted at one or both dose levels. Supplementation of fluvastatin administration with 500 mg/kg b.i.d. of mevalonic acid completely blocked and/or ameliorated the mortality, cardiac myopathy, and other adverse effects. These studies indicate that the adverse maternal effects observed with fluvastatin before or following parturition resulted from exaggerated pharmacologic activity at the dose levels administered, i.e., inhibition of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, its immediate product mevalonic acid, and cholesterol biosynthesis.", 
    "19": "In 9 clinics 177 patients (68 men and 109 women) aged 23-69 years with primary hypercholesterolemia (TC above 6.5 mmol/L) were treated with lovastatin for 12 weeks. The treatment was started with 20 mg daily. The dose was doubled every 4 weeks, if the total serum cholesterol level did not fall below 5.2 mmol/L. For 4 weeks before treatment with lovastatin all patients received placebo. After the first 4 weeks of therapy the mean TC level decreased significantly (from 8.09 mmol/L to 6.54 mmol/L) by 18.5%. In comparison with the results after placebo (the starting value), after the 8 weeks of the therapy the TC level reduction reached 22.4% and after 12 weeks 23.5%. The mean LDL cholesterol decreased by 26.1%, 30.8% and 32.9% after 4.8 and 12 weeks of lovastatin treatment respectively. An increase in HDL cholesterol by 5.9%, 6.0% and 7.6% and decrease in triglyceride level by 10.7%, 14.9% and 14.0% respectively was also observed. In 6 patients on lovastatin treatment symptoms of acute pancreatitis in 1 case, a cataract in 1 case and aggravation of coronary insufficiency in 4 cases were noticed. These symptoms in the light of our knowledge of the mechanism of action of the drug used and of its side effects described in other trials, may be considered of independent on lovastatin. The treatment was discontinued in 5 cases (because of gastrointestinal intolerance in 2 patients, of aggravation of coronary insufficiency in 2 patients and of pain in the right hypochondrium in 1 patient who himself decided to stop the therapy).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "20": "The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are a new and novel class of cholesterol-lowering agents which are widely used worldwide. Fluvastatin is the first entirely synthetic compound in this class and is structurally distinct from fungal metabolite derivatives which are already marketed. As the liver is the site of some toxic effects for these compounds, it was not entirely unexpected that liver cancer was found in rats and/or mice with the first three marketed compounds, lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin. Four lifetime carcinogenicity studies (two rat and two mouse) did not give any evidence that fluvastatin induced liver tumors in rodents. Fluvastatin induced thyroid neoplasms in rats and forestomach papillomas in rodents, as other compounds in this pharmacologic class have also done. The genotoxic potential of fluvastatin has been assessed in vitro using Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli (gene mutations), V79 Chinese hamster cells (HGPRT gene mutations, chromosomal aberrations), rat hepatocyte primary cultures (DNA repair), and BALB/3T3 cells (malignant transformations). Fluvastatin was also tested in vivo for clastogenicity using the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test and by performing a cytogenetic analysis in the rat bone marrow after acute and subacute treatment. In all seven assays fluvastatin was found to be free of any genotoxic potential.", 
    "21": "Platelet function was studied in 10 patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia, following lipid-lowering treatment with selective LDL-apheresis and with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor pravastatin. Platelet function was assessed before, and 2, 5 and 14 days after LDL-apheresis, and before and after 4 weeks of pravastatin therapy. Both treatments significantly reduced total- and LDL-cholesterol, whereas LDL-apheresis also reduced VLDL-cholesterol. Lp(a)-levels were reduced by LDL-apheresis and elevated by pravastatin treatment. Pravastatin therapy significantly enhanced platelet aggregability in vivo, as measured by ex vivo filtragometry. Plasma serotonin levels also increased. Other markers of in vivo activation of platelets, i.e. beta-thromboglobulin in plasma and urine, and 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 in urine were unaltered. Adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation in vitro remained unchanged during pravastatin therapy, and the platelet volume distribution was not affected. LDL-apheresis reduced the mean platelet volume, as well as the percentage of large platelets, whereas the percentage of small platelets increased. Other measures of platelet function in vivo or in vitro were, however, unaltered following LDL-apheresis. Thus, pravastatin therapy enhances certain aspects of platelet aggregability in vivo, whereas a single treatment with selective LDL-apheresis does not consistently affect platelet aggregability during resting conditions. These results do not support the concept that reduction of LDL-cholesterol improves platelet function in hypercholesterolaemic patients, at least not in the short-term. However, the reduction of platelet volume after LDL-apheresis may be beneficial for patients receiving this therapy regularly.", 
    "22": "This double-blind, placebo-controlled, six month trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of pravastatin in hypercholesterolaemic, hypertensive patients on antihypertensive treatment, who on a standard lipid-lowering diet maintained a plasma total cholesterol level of at least 250 mg%. Fifty hypertensive patients were randomised to placebo or pravastatin treatment. Once daily dosing consisted of 10 mg pravastatin during the first month, 20 mg during the second month and 40 mg during an additional 4 months or matching placebos. Compared with placebo, pravastatin reduced (P < 0.001) the plasma level of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and phospholipids during the six month study period whereas plasma HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides did not change significantly. These changes in plasma lipids were independent of age and of the nature of the concomitant antihypertensive treatment. No serious side-effects were observed and pravastatin was generally well tolerated. In conclusion, pravastatin 10-40 mg once daily reduced plasma total and LDL-cholesterol in hypercholesterolaemic, hypertensive patients, independent of age and concurrent antihypertensive drug therapy.", 
    "23": "Fluvastatin (Sandoz Compound XU 62-320), a synthetic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, was assayed in vitro and in vivo for its ability to suppress juvenile hormone (JH) biosynthesis by corpora allata of Locusta migratoria migratorioides. Fluvastatin inhibited JH biosynthesis by corpora allata in vitro. Exogenous mevalonic acid lactone restored JH biosynthesis in corpora allata inhibited by fluvastatin. Fluvastatin injected into locusts in vivo inhibited JH biosynthesis, but maximal inhibition lasted for only 6 hr. There were no discernible effects on either JH-regulated metamorphosis or oocyte maturation. Lengthening of the fourth larval stadium was observed and increased doses (single or repeated injections) were fatal.", 
    "24": "Neurosteroids (steroids synthesized in the CNS) function by modulating neurotransmission. To establish an experimental model for investigation of neurosteroid synthesis and regulation, independent of blood-borne steroids, we examined the steroidogenic activity of isolated rat retinas. We identified progesterone, pregnenolone, dehydroepiandrosterone, desoxycorticosterone, 3 alpha,5 alpha-tetrahydrodesoxycorticosterone, 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-dihydroprogesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and 17-hydroxypregnenolone together with their esterified forms. As pregnenolone is the precursor of all steroids, its formation was studied in detail as an index of a steroid-synthesizing tissue. Pregnenolone was identified further by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, and its in vitro synthesis was inhibited by lovastatin, an inhibitor of mevalonolactone and cholesterol biosynthesis. We then examined pregnenolone synthesis in the presence of mevalonolactone as a precursor of sterol formation together with lovastatin, which reduces endogenous mevalonolactone synthesis, as well as with inhibitors of pregnenolone metabolism. The incorporation of mevalonolactone into pregnenolone and its sulfate ester was time- and concentration-dependent and blocked by aminoglutethimide, a competitive inhibitor of cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage (P450scc) enzyme. Immunocytochemical studies with a specific antibody to P450scc revealed a primary localization of the enzyme at the retinal ganglion cell layer. A less pronounced immunostaining was also seen at cells of the inner nuclear layer. Compounds known to stimulate cyclic AMP content also stimulated pregnenolone formation by rat retinas. These results demonstrate that rat retinas synthesize steroids and, for the first time, they reveal the steroidogenic ability of neuronal cells. We propose rat retinas as an in vitro model system to study neurosteroidogenesis in the CNS.", 
    "25": "As part of a program to prepare delta 8(14)-15-ketosterols that cannot readily be metabolized to cholesterol or side-chain oxygenated species, we have prepared 3 beta-hydroxy-7 alpha-fluoro-5 alpha-cholest-8(14)-en-15-one (VII) and the 9 alpha-hydroxy (IV), 9 alpha-fluoro (VI) and 7 alpha-fluoro (VIII) derivatives of 3 beta-hydroxy-25,26,26,26,27,27,27-heptafluoro-5 alpha-cholest-8(14)-en-15-one (II). Sterol IV was prepared by oxidation of the delta 8,14 dienol ethyl ether of the 3 beta-acetate of II with m-chloroperbenzoic acid, followed by mild alkaline hydrolysis of the 3 beta-acetate derivative of IV. Treatment of IV with hydrogen fluoride-pyridine gave VI. The 7 alpha-fluoro-15-ketosterols VII and VIII were synthesized by treating the 3 beta,15-bis-trimethylsilyl delta 7,14-dienol ether derivative of the appropriate delta 8(14)-15-ketosterol with N-fluoropyridinium triflate, followed by hydrolysis of residual trimethylsilyl ethers and purification by high-performance liquid chromatography. The combined results of 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts, 1H-1H coupling constants, 1H-19F long-range coupling constants and molecular modeling indicated that a 7 alpha-fluoro, 9 alpha-fluoro or 9 alpha-hydroxy substituent has negligible effect on the conformation of the 15-ketosterols. 1H and 13C-NMR data are also given for delta 6,8(14)- and delta 8(14),9(11)-15-ketosterols, synthetic byproducts that could not be detected readily in samples of the fluoro-15-ketosterols by chromatographic methods. Mass spectra of VI and of previously reported 9 alpha-fluoro and 9 alpha-hydroxy-delta 8(14)-15-ketosterols showed abundant M-62 or M-60 ions that appear to correspond to loss of ketene and HF or H2O. The 9 alpha-hydroxy-F7-15-ketosterol IV, the 7 alpha-fluoro-15-ketosterol VII and the 7 alpha-fluoro-F7-15-ketosterol VIII were of equivalent potency to the parent 3 beta-hydroxy-5 alpha-cholest-8(14)-en-15-one (I) in lowering the levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity in CHO-K1 cells. The 9 alpha-fluoro-F7-15-ketosterol VI showed high potency but appeared to be slightly less active than I.", 
    "26": "A polyclonal antibody [anti-prelamin A antibody (alpha-PA)] has been obtained against the peptide LLGNSSPRTQSPQN which is proteolytically removed during the farnesylation-dependent processing of prelamin A to mature lamin A. We tested the ability of this antibody to detect inhibition of farnesylation-dependent protein processing of prelamin A. The alpha-PA antibody was shown to immunoprecipitate prelamin A from lovastatin-treated HeLa cells but not mature lamin A from untreated cells. Further studies were performed after antigen-affinity chromatographic purification of the antibody. Western blotting of lovastatin-treated HeLa cell extract demonstrated that the purified alpha-PA antibody recognizes prelamin A. Furthermore, this signal could be competed away by incubation with the peptide. Indirect immunofluorescence helped detect nuclear accumulation of the antigen in response to treatment of HeLa cells with lovastatin or in Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells transiently transfected with a prelamin A mutant blocked in farnesylation. This antibody should be useful for screening compounds that may block any of the three common steps in the farnesylation-dependent processing of proteins (farnesylation, endoproteolysis, and carboxymethylation) since it appears that prelamin A undergoes all of these reactions prior to removal of the antigenic peptide. Inhibitors of these reactions have been proposed as potential anticancer drugs, since they would be expected to block the biological activity of oncogenic p21ras proteins. Since such screening would be performed most efficiently by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, we can detect the accumulation of prelamin A after treatment with lovastatin by performing this procedure as well. Application of alpha-PA in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, which demonstrates the activity of a peptidomimetic farnesyltransferase inhibitor, supports the use of this antibody in large scale screening for inhibitors of farnesylation-dependent protein processing.",

The ASA, lovastatin and danazol were discontinued. The symptoms resolved, and laboratory test results were normal within 2 weeks. Lovastatin was strongly suspected; danazol was the most likely potentiator by diminishing the metabolism of lovastatin and its metabolites in the liver or by having a direct toxic effect on the muscles.", 
    "28": "Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) previously have been shown to drive the major cell cycle transitions in eukaryotic organisms ranging from yeast to humans. We report here the identification of a 28-kDa protein, p28Ick (inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase), that binds to and inhibits the kinase activity of preformed Cdk/cyclin complexes from human cells. p28 inhibitory activity fluctuates during the cell cycle with maximal levels in G1 and accumulates in G1- and G0-arrested cells. These results suggest that control of the G1/S transition may be influenced by a family of Cdk inhibitors that include p28Ick and the recently described inhibitors p21Cip1/Waf1/Cap20 and p16Ink4.", 
    "29": "In this long-term (52-week) open-label extension to an earlier randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding trial, 381 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia received fluvastatin at increasing doses of 10 to 40 mg/day to achieve plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol normalization, according to the European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines. The aim of the extension study was to assess the long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of fluvastatin. After 52 weeks of therapy, 75% of patients were receiving fluvastatin at 40 mg/day (mean dose: 36 +/- 8 mg/day). The mean percent change in LDL-cholesterol levels from baseline was -24.8% (p < 0.001), and 82.6% of patients achieved an LDL-cholesterol reduction of > or = 15%. In patients in the lowest baseline quintile, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels were significantly (p < 0.001) increased by 8.8% whereas, in the highest baseline quintile, triglycerides were significantly (p < 0.001) reduced by 15.3%. Plasma lipoparticle (a) [Lp(a)]:B levels were also significantly reduced (-38.6%; p < 0.001). Fluvastatin was considered to be well tolerated by the majority of patients by both patients and investigators. The most frequently reported adverse event was abdominal pain. Notable biochemical abnormalities were rare. In conclusion, the results of this extension study indicate that fluvastatin at dosages of 20-40 mg/day is effective and well tolerated in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and is accompanied by no particular problems of safety.", 
    "30": "A double-blind, randomized, crossover study assessed the effects of a single 40-mg dose of fluvastatin on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin in chronically treated patients. After demonstrating consistent digoxin serum concentrations as part of the inclusion criteria, 18 patients received a single dose of either fluvastatin or placebo, with a 1-week washout period between crossover to the other treatment. For each patient, 14 serum samples were drawn and urine collected over 24 hours; all samples were assayed for digoxin using a fluorescence polarization immunoassay. The following pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using noncompartmental techniques: area under the curve for 24 hours (AUC24); time to maximum concentration after digoxin (tmax); maximum concentration after digoxin dosing (Cmax); concentration at 24 hours after fluvastatin or placebo (Cmin); total amount excreted in the urine over 24 hours (U24); and urinary clearance (Clren). The pharmacokinetic data were analyzed for sequence, patient nested with sequence, and period and treatment differences using ANOVA, Schuirmann's two one-sided testing approach, confidence intervals, and power analysis. The AUC24, Cmax, and tmax for digoxin were considered bioequivalent with the two treatments. The differences in Cmax, U24, and Clren were statistically significant but were not considered to be clinically relevant due to the low magnitude of the difference (< 20%). There were no clinically significant adverse reactions attributable to either digoxin or fluvastatin.", 
    "31": "Patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and established coronary artery disease (CAD) with additional associated risk factors for atherosclerosis are considered for lipid-lowering drug therapy at lower levels of total and/or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) than are patients with isolated hypercholesterolemia. As regards prevention of cardiovascular morbid events, high-risk patients are expected to receive the most benefit from lipid-lowering treatment. Thus, it is of interest to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the new lipid-lowering agent fluvastatin, a new, wholly synthetic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, in patients at high risk. A retrospective analysis was based on data from controlled clinical trials in which 1,815 patients were treated with fluvastatin at a daily dose of > or = 20 mg and 783 patients received placebo. Of the fluvastatin-treated patients, 328 (18.1%) had CAD compared with 136 (17.4%) patients taking placebo. Within these groups, 186 fluvastatin patients and 75 placebo patients had at least one of the following additional risk factors: hypertension, obesity, and/or fasting blood glucose levels above the upper limit of normal (ULN). Patients at high risk, as defined above, were compared with patients without CAD or any risk factors (fluvastatin, n = 837; placebo, n = 375). The effect of 40 mg of fluvastatin on LDL and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides tended to be enhanced in patients at high risk (HR) compared with those at low risk (LR). Changes from baseline in HR patients were: LDL-C, -26.6%; HDL-C, 6.4%; triglycerides, -13%. Changes in LR patients were: LDL-C, -24.8%; HDL-C, 4.4%; triglycerides, -6%. All of these changes were highly significant (0.001 < p < 0.01). No patient in the HR group experienced a confirmed (measured on two consecutive occasions) increase > 3 x ULN in aspartate (ASAT) or alanine (ALAT) aminotransferases, nor any notable increases in creatine kinase > 10 x ULN. The tolerability of fluvastatin, as assessed by analysis of adverse events, was not consistently influenced by concomitant high risk. This exploratory analysis of the efficacy and safety profile of fluvastatin in patients at high risk for atherosclerosis suggests that such treatment is efficacious, safe, and well tolerated. The observed tendency toward an improved efficacy in the high-risk group will need further confirmation using data from prospective studies in such patients.", 
    "32": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the triglyceride-lowering effect of fluvastatin, a new 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, in the combined hyperlipidemia of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). In this double-blind trial, 66 patients with NIDDM (24 men and 42 women, age 37-71), with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels of 130-300 mg/dL (3.4-7.8 mmol/L) and triglyceride (TG) levels of 200-1,000 mg/dL (2.3-11.3 mmol/L) despite an 8-week period of diet modification, were randomized to receive either fluvastatin at 20 mg once daily (at night) or placebo for 6 weeks, followed by an increase of fluvastatin to 20 mg twice daily for an additional 6 weeks of treatment. After 12 weeks, fluvastatin decreased plasma levels of total cholesterol by 19.9% (p < 0.001), LDL-C by 24.3% (p < 0.001), TG by 15.3% (p < 0.01), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) by 19.7% (p < 0.001), apolipoprotein (apo) B by 21.3% (p < 0.001), and apo E by 18.1% (p < 0.05), whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were increased by 4.6% (p < 0.05). Within the intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDL-C) fraction, a constituent analysis revealed a total cholesterol reduction of 35% (p < 0.01). Greater decreases in TG were seen in patients who had higher levels of TG at baseline. Slight increases in glycemic indices and body weight were seen in both treatment groups. The occurrence of clinical and laboratory abnormalities was similar with both active treatment and placebo, and no myositis was observed. Slight increases in aspartate (ASAT; mean 5.6 U/L at the higher dose) and alanine (ALAT; mean 5.1 U/L at the higher dose) aminotransferases were not clinically significant. In this first, parallel-group placebo-controlled trial of a reductase inhibitor in a free-living NIDDM population, fluvastatin safely improved the combined TG, VLDL-C, IDL-C, LDL-C, and HDL-C abnormalities associated with NIDDM.", 
    "33": "A total of 74 hypercholesterolemic patients were randomized to receive double-blind treatment for 6 weeks with either 20 mg of fluvastatin daily or placebo. Open-label niacin, to a maximum of 3 g daily, was added to each treatment for a further 9 weeks. Changes in lipid parameters were derived from averaged data, with monotherapy at weeks 3 and 6 and with combination therapy at weeks 12 and 15. The reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was significantly greater with fluvastatin (20.8%) compared with placebo (p < 0.001) after 3-6 weeks of treatment. At the end of 12-15 weeks, the addition of niacin potentiated the response to 43.7% with the fluvastatin+niacin combination and to 26.5% with the placebo+niacin combination (p < 0.001, vs baseline and between treatment groups). Significant gender differences were noted in the LDL-C response to the fluvastatin+niacin combination. Women achieved LDL-C reductions of 54.6% whereas men achieved reductions of 38.2% (p < 0.0005, between gender groups). Women also tended to have greater LDL-C reductions with the placebo+niacin combination, compared with men (p < 0.05). At the end of 12-15 weeks, there were HDL-C increases of 33.1% (p < 0.001) whereas triglyceride levels declined by 32.3% (p < 0.001). In conclusion, fluvastatin, both as monotherapy and in combination with niacin, proved to be an effective and well-tolerated alternative for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. The differential response in LDL-C between men and women should be further explored in other trials of lipid-lowering therapy.", 
    "34": "The effects of fluvastatin and bezafibrate on lipids, lipoproteins, and apoproteins (apo) were investigated in a multicenter randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study. After 8 weeks of strictly controlled (computer-based assessment) dietary stabilization, patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] > or = 160 mg/dL; triglycerides < or = 300 mg/dL) were enrolled into a 6-week placebo phase. Altogether, 131 patients were randomized to receive either fluvastatin at 40 mg once daily (n = 64; mean age 53 years) or bezafibrate at 400 mg once daily (n = 67; mean age 52 years) for 12 weeks. Compliance with the diet was monitored (3-day food records) after 6 and 12 weeks. Fluvastatin led to significant reductions in LDL-C (-23%), total cholesterol (-17%), LDL-C/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (-24%) and apo B (-19%). Fluvastatin significantly increased LpA-I (+8%) and apo E (+20%). Bezafibrate produced significant reductions in LDL-C (-17%), total cholesterol (-13%), LDL-C/HDL-C (-24%), triglycerides (-28%), apo B (-15%), and LpA-I (-10%) and significantly increased HDL-C (+12%), apo A-I (+9%), apo A-II (+30%), apo E (+14%), and Lp(a) (+3%). No clinically notable increases in levels of liver enzymes or creatine phosphokinase were observed with either treatment. Both treatments were well tolerated. There was a low incidence of adverse events that tended to be mild and included headache, muscular pain, angina, and dyspepsia. The frequency of adverse events was similar in both treatment groups, and no significant differences in dietary behavior were observed. In conclusion, fluvastatin is a well tolerated 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor for the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia. Effects of fluvastatin on LpA-I occur irrespective of changes in HDL-C.", 
    "35": "A total of 123 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia were randomized on a 2:1 ratio to receive either fluvastatin at 20 mg once daily at night (n = 82) or gemfibrozil at 600 mg twice daily (n = 41) in a double-blind, double-dummy comparison of the effects on plasma lipid parameters and tolerability over 8 weeks. All patients had either low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations > or = 160 mg/dL (4.1 mmol/L) in association with definite coronary artery disease (CAD) or > or = 2 risk factors, or LDL-C > or = 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) with no CAD and < 2 risk factors. All had triglyceride (TG) levels < or = 350 mg/dL (4.0 mmol/L). After 8 weeks of treatment, fluvastatin produced significant reductions from baseline of 17.4% (p < 0.001) in LDL-C, 13.2% (p < 0.001) in total cholesterol (TC), 13.8% (p < 0.001) in very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), and 6.4% (NS) in TG. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was increased by 5.6% (p < 0.001), and the ratio of LDL-C:HDL-C (Friedewald) was decreased by 21.2% (p < 0.001). Gemfibrozil reduced LDL-C by 15.8%, TC by 13.4%, VLDL-C by 32.2%, LDL-C:HDL-C by 24.8%, and TG by 34.2%, and increased HDL-C by 13.9% (all changes were statistically significant, p < 0.001) compared with baseline. Gemfibrozil produced significantly greater changes in VLDL-C (p < 0.01), HDL-C (p < 0.001), and TG (p < 0.001), but not in LDL-C: HDL-C, compared with fluvastatin. Both drugs significantly reduced apolipoprotein (apo) B and lipoparticles (Lp) E:B, and increased apo A-I but had divergent effects on LpA-I (increased with fluvastatin and reduced with gemfibrozil; p < 0.05). At the end of the study, 43.8% of fluvastatin patients and 45% of gemfibrozil patients achieved a reduction of > 20% in LDL-C levels. Normalization of LDL-C levels was achieved (according to European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines) by 13.4% of fluvastatin- and 14.6% of gemfibrozil-treated patients. Both drugs were well tolerated; adverse events occurred in 36.6% of fluvastatin recipients compared with 58.5% of patients taking gemfibrozil. No clinically notable elevations of aspartate or alanine aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, or creatine phosphokinase occurred. No patient developed new or worsening lens opacities associated with a reduction in optically corrected visual acuity. The most commonly reported adverse events were headache and gastrointestinal upset. There were no serious drug-related adverse events.", 
    "36": "The Fluvastatin Long-Term Extension Trial (FLUENT) evaluated the safety and efficacy of fluvastatin over a period of 48 weeks. All 918 enrolled patients had severe primary hypercholesterolemia (mean baseline low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol, 227 mg/dL) and had completed one of three previous short-term studies of fluvastatin. This open-label extension study used a starting dose of 20 mg of fluvastatin at bedtime. The dose was titrated to 40 mg to achieve LDL levels of < 3.36 mmol/L (130 mg/dL). If necessary, cholestyramine was added to the fluvastatin treatment to achieve this level. After 48 weeks of treatment, the mean percent change from baseline was statistically significant for LDL (-30.7%; p < 0.001), total (-21.9%; p < 0.001), and HDL (+3.5%; p < 0.001) cholesterol. Of the 836 patients who completed the study, only four (0.5%) withdrew because of drug-related adverse events, which were mainly gastrointestinal. There was one purported case of myopathy in a patient who had a recent history of strenuous physical activity. Newly occurring or worsening lens abnormalities were generally mild and did not require discontinuation of treatment. In conclusion, these results indicate that fluvastatin is safe, effective, and well tolerated in the long-term treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "37": "Fluvastatin is a totally synthetic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor that is effective in reducing cholesterol when given in a single evening dose. Absorption and rate of bioavailability may be affected when administered with food, but the effect of mealtime dosing on efficacy and safety has not been evaluated. This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study was performed in 44 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia. Patients received 20 mg of fluvastatin with the evening meal and placebo at bedtime for 6 weeks, followed by 12 weeks of placebo at mealtime and fluvastatin at bedtime (group 1). Group 2 received the opposite treatment schedule, and group 3 received placebo at mealtime and at bedtime for 12 weeks before receiving 20 mg of fluvastatin at bedtime instead of placebo for the final 6 weeks. Fluvastatin with the evening meal resulted in a marginally lower peak serum concentration (p < 0.1) and a significantly delayed time to peak concentration compared with bedtime dosing, but there were no statistically significant differences in the extent of bioavailability. At the end of the first 6 weeks of treatment, similar reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were obtained whether fluvastatin was given at mealtime (-21.8%; p < 0.001) or at bedtime (-23.9%; p < 0.001). After crossover of groups 1 and 2, the results remained constant. With fluvastatin, there were comparable reductions in total cholesterol (p < 0.001) and in LDL:high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio (p < 0.001) irrespective of the time of dosing. In conclusion, fluvastatin had a similar tolerability, safety, and efficacy, whether given with the evening meal or at bedtime. There were no serious adverse events nor changes in physical examination findings or laboratory values attributable to treatment.", 
    "38": "Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated an association between apolipoprotein (apo) B-containing particles (lipoprotein [Lp] E:B; LpC-III:B) and an inverse association between LpA-I and the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). The effect of 6 weeks of treatment with fluvastatin (20 and 40 mg/day in the evening), a novel competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, on lipoparticle levels was studied in 423 patients with hypercholesterolemia after 14 weeks of standard dietary therapy. The combined data of the European double-blind controlled studies were used for the analysis. Two independent groups of hypercholesterolemic patients receiving fluvastatin (20 and 40 mg every evening) for 6 weeks were compared with a placebo group. For inclusion, patients had to fulfill the following criteria: plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels > 160 mg/dL and premature CAD and/or two associated risk factors; LDL cholesterol > 190 mg/dL and no CAD; triglycerides < 300 mg/dL. All measurements were performed at the Pasteur Institute Central Laboratory, LpE:B and LpC-III:B were measured by double-site ELISA. Lipoprotein A-I and LpA-I:A-II were determined by differential electroimmunodiffusion. Treatment with 20 and 40 mg of fluvastatin was associated with reductions in plasma apo B (median change: -19.3% and -22.8%, respectively; p < 0.001), LpE:B (-12.5% and -22.6%, respectively; p < 0.001), and LpC-III:B (-3.6% and -36.8%, respectively; p < 0.001) particles compared with placebo. Significant increases in plasma apo A-I (1.7% and 4.8%, respectively; p < 0.001) and antiatherogenic LpA-I (2.3% and 6.9%, respectively; p < 0.001) were also observed. Levels of LpA-I:A-II were not affected by fluvastatin treatment. In conclusion, 6-week treatment with fluvastatin is associated with beneficial antiatherogenic changes in lipoparticle profiles in hypercholesterolemic patients.",

    "40": "Nine patients with hypercholesterolemia were studied before and after cholesterol-lowering therapy with pravastatin (an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase) for 6 +/- 3 months, which lowered serum cholesterol from 272 +/- 8 to 187 +/- 16 mg/dL (P < .01). Control patients with serum cholesterol of 218 +/- 23 mg/dL also were studied twice in a similar interval (8 +/- 2 months) with no cholesterol-lowering drugs. Acetylcholine (the endothelium-dependent vasodilator) and papaverine and nitrate (endothelium-independent vasodilators) were infused into the study coronary artery. Changes in the diameter of the epicardial coronary artery and coronary blood flow were assessed by quantitative coronary arteriography and an intracoronary Doppler catheter. In patients with hypercholesterolemia, acetylcholine-induced vasoconstriction of the epicardial artery was less (P < .05) and the acetylcholine-induced increases in coronary blood flow were greater (P < .001) after than before pravastatin. In control patients, responses of the epicardial coronary artery and coronary blood flow to acetylcholine did not change over the follow-up period. The vasomotor responses to papaverine or nitrate were similar between the two groups, and no interval changes in their responses were noted in either group.",

During follow-up colonoscopic examination of patients who had undergone previous resection for colorectal carcinoma, biopsies were taken from the anastomotic site and from the mucosa 10 to 15 cm from the anastomosis. One side of 10 well-oriented crypts was counted for each patient with the number of nuclei positive for statin being determined by the presence of dark brown reaction product.", 
    "44": "The average percentages of statin-positive cells varied between 19.4 and 44.4 (average, 31.3 +/- 6.5) for the normal mucosa and 22.8 to 35.1 (average, 29.98 +/- 3.67) for the anastomotic mucosa. The differences were not significant. There were no differences between those patients in whom the postoperative time elapsed was two years or less and those greater than two years.",

    "46": "Modulation of cell growth by a combination of pravastatin [a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor] and d-limonene (an inhibitor of protein isoprenylation) was studied using Hep G2, a human hepatoma-derived cell line. Pravastatin, at 0.1 mM, produced 85% inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis in Hep G2 cells. The combination of 0.1 mM pravastatin and 1.0 mM d-limonene had no further effect on the reduction seen with pravastatin alone. Addition of 0.1 mM pravastatin or 1.0 mM d-limonene did not significantly suppress DNA synthesis by the cells, whereas the combination suppressed it to 50% of the control level. Production of m-p21ras was markedly decreased to 35% of the control level by the combination of these two inhibitors. Both the reduction by pravastatin of farnesylpyrophosphate as substrate for protein:farnesyl transferase and inhibition of protein farnesylation by d-limonene seem to be responsible for the profound suppression of m-p21ras formation in the cells. However, dolichol synthesis was not suppressed by the combination of these inhibitors. In human fibroblasts, the combination suppressed m-p21ras production but not DNA synthesis. These findings suggest that the combination of pravastatin and d-limonene acts on cancer cell growth through inhibition of the post-translational processing of cellular proteins including p21ras, rather than through the suppression of cholesterol and dolichol biosynthesis. Thus, the combination of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and an inhibitor of protein isoprenylation offers potential as a new approach for cancer therapy.", 
    "47": "The highly regulated enzyme HMG-CoA reductase generates mevalonate, the precursor of a complex series of isoprenoids that posttranslationally modify (isoprenylate) certain proteins (e.g., the low-molecular-weight GTP-binding proteins) or that are incorporated into cholesterol and other end products. We recently reported that isoprenoids are required for NADPH oxidase activity in granulocytes via LMW GTP-binding protein isoprenylation. In this study, we evaluated the effects of isoprenoid depletion on the expression of proinflammatory genes in human monocytic THP-1 cells. We selected conditions under which pretreatment for 24 h with isoprenoid synthesis inhibitors (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin or compactin at 10 microM) did not compromise cell viability but markedly suppressed H2O2 generation. Under these conditions interleukin-8 (IL-8) production was attenuated (by 50-90%) in response to lipopolysaccharide, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and phorbol myristate acetate. Coincubation of reductase inhibitor-treated cells with mevalonate prevented the attenuation of IL-8 production by reductase inhibitors. The effects of isoprenoid depletion on cytokine production were selective: IL-1 beta generation was not inhibited but the production of IL-6 and IL-8 was concomitantly suppressed. IL-8 induction was suppressed at least in part through attenuation of the increase in mRNA in stimulated cells. We conclude that isoprenoid generation through the mevalonate pathway is a requirement for IL-8 induction by activated monocytic cells in vitro. Isoprenylation inhibitors have the potential to alter monocyte proinflammatory function.", 
    "48": "Lovastatin, a specific inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, inhibits the biosynthesis of cholesterol and the prenylation of proteins. In this study, we have found that lovastatin inhibited the cytotoxicities of modeccin, ricin, Pseudomonas toxin, and diphtheria toxin in Vero and a brefeldin A (BFA)-resistant mutant of Vero cells (BER-40) to different extents. Among these toxins tested, the cytotoxicity of modeccin was most strongly inhibited by lovastatin in a dose-dependent manner. The protective effect of lovastatin was completely reversed by the addition of mevalonic acid, while the addition of cholesterol had no effect on the cytotoxicity of modeccin in lovastatin-treated cells. These results suggest that prenylated proteins are involved in the intoxication process of modeccin. The addition of cycloheximide to the growth medium also reversed the protective effect of lovastatin, suggesting a requirement of de novo protein synthesis for the protection by lovastatin against toxins. In contrast to Vero and BER-40 cells, no significant effect of lovastatin was observed in naturally BFA-resistant cell lines, PtK1 and MDCK cells, even though similar morphological changes and disassembly of the actin microfilaments were induced by lovastatin in these cell lines as observed in Vero and BER-40 cells. Lovastatin did not affect the binding and internalization of ricin and modeccin in Vero and BER-40 cells. Our results suggest that prenylated cellular proteins are involved in intracellular trafficking or processing of protein toxins, especially modeccin. In PtK1 and MDCK cells, such intracellular vesicle trafficking of protein toxins may be regulated by lovastatin-resistant mechanisms.", 
    "49": "The production of the murine monoclonal antibody BU31 is described. This antibody identifies a nuclear envelope protein which is expressed in some but not all cells, and which resembles statin, a protein reported to be expressed by non-proliferating cells. BU31 was applied onto frozen sections of a series of 78 lung tumours and the staining patterns were compared with those obtained with Ki-67. There was an inverse correlation between the proportion of tumour nuclei labelled with the two reagents (r = -0.61, 95 per cent confidence intervals -0.73 to -0.45). However, the four neuroendocrine neoplasms were BU31-negative. Squamous cell carcinomas often showed a peripheral distribution of the cells stained positively with Ki-67, whereas BU31 tended to label centrally situated cells. These observations are consistent with the concept that the antigen recognized by BU31 is expressed by non-proliferating cells in these tumours.", 
    "50": "The efficacy of pravastatin as reducing plasma cholesterol, LDL-CH and Apo B is widely proved. Other molecules within the Apolipoprotein family are recently emerging to have a predictive and/or causative role in atherosclerosis such as particularly Lp(a). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of pravastatin therapy in patients affected by primary hypoercholesterolemia on apoprotein and Lp(a) plasma levels. We investigated the effects of pravastatin on 15 patients, seven female and eight male patients, mean age 50.23 +/- 17.2 (range 21-71 years) with primary hypercholesterolemia, of which 7 patients affected by familial hypercholesterolemia and 8 patients by polygenic hypercholesterolemia, were selected. Five weeks after suspension of lipid-lowering drugs and on a normocaloric-fat diet, were given 20 mg pravastatin/day for 12 weeks. The following parameters were measured basally, on the 6th week and the 12th week on pravastatin therapy and after five weeks from drug withdrawal: cholesterol (CH), triglicerides (TG), high density and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-CH and LDH-CH) measured enzymatically, apoproteins A1, B, C2, C3, E measured radial immunodiffusion technique (RID) and Lp(a), measured as apoprotein(a) with immunoradiometric assay (RIA). Our data confirm pravastatin efficacy in decreasing CH (from 305.6 +/- 43.4 mg/dl to 266.2 +/- 47.7 mg/dl, p < 0.01) LDL-CH (from 223.9 +/- 56.4 mg/dl to 187.2 +/- 59.8 mg/dl, p < 0.01) and Apo B (from 170.4 +/- 27.5 to 152.4 +/- 25.2, p < 0.02); non influence was observed on HDL-CH and apoproteins A1, C2, E and Lp(a). Pravastatin determined a significant increase only on Apo C3 (from 8.35 +/- 2.7 to 10.3 +/- 3.1, p < 0.04). The above data confirm the beneficial effect of pravastatin in greatly decreasing CH and LDL-CH considered as major risk factors for coronary artery disease, but also point to a role of pravastatin in regulating the apoproteins equilibrium, an aspect that surely merits further studies.", 
    "51": "Previous studies have shown that treatment of guinea pigs with lovastatin alters the composition and the metabolic properties of circulating low density lipoprotein (LDL). Specifically, LDL isolated from lovastatin-treated animals is cleared from plasma more slowly than LDL isolated from control animals, when injected into the guinea pig. In the present study, we examine whether lovastatin also affects the metabolic properties of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), the metabolic precursor of LDL. VLDL isolated from lovastatin-treated guinea pigs (L-VLDL) and VLDL isolated from untreated (control) guinea pigs (C-VLDL) were radioiodinated and simultaneously injected into eight untreated guinea pigs. Radioactivity associated with apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB) was measured in four plasma density fractions and analyzed using a compartmental model consisting of fast and slow pools for VLDL, fast and slow pools for intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and a single slow pool for LDL. The fractional catabolic rate (FCR) for C-VLDL apoB was 2.8 +/- 1.0 h-1 and for L-VLDL apoB was 5.1 +/- 2.0 h-1 (P < 0.002, paired t test). The fractions of control and lovastatin VLDL apoB converted to LDL averaged 0.15 +/- 0.15 and 0.02 +/- 0.02, respectively (P < 0.05, paired t test). Finally, the FCRs of LDL apoB derived from control and lovastatin VLDL were similar (0.059 +/- 0.007 h-1 and 0.083 +/- 0.038 h-1, respectively; paired t test not significant). These data indicate that L-VLDL was irreversibly removed from the plasma of an untreated guinea pig more rapidly than was C-VLDL. Thus, the metabolic behavior of VLDL apoB is affected by lovastatin. Therefore, changes in lipoprotein particles themselves must be considered in assessing the overall impact of treatment with lovastatin.",

Administration of VII resulted in lowering of the levels of serum cholesterol at dosages as low as 0.025% by weight in diet. In marked contrast to I, VII had little or no effect on food consumption. Whereas administration of I at a level of 0.1% by weight in diet resulted in a cessation of growth, VII, at approximately the same molar concentration in diet, had only slight or no effect on changes in total body weight. Significant levels of 25,26,26,26,27,27,27-heptafluorocholesterol (VIII) were observed in serum and liver, indicating the conversion of VII to VIII. Characterization of VIII in liver was based upon the results of gas chromatography, low and high resolution mass spectral studies, infrared spectroscopy, and 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

At up to 20 micrograms/ml of SV, the effect was reversible and was restored by 60 micrograms/ml mevalonic acid. Point mutation of Ki-ras at codon 12 in each cell line was detected by means of the modified polymerase chain reaction. The concentration of SV necessary to achieve 50% cytotoxicity was about 10 micrograms/ml, and at this concentration of SV, DNA synthesis assayed in terms of [3H]thymidine uptake, isoprenylation of p21ras examined by Western blotting and cell progression from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle analyzed by flow cytometry were all inhibited.

As previous studies from our group have demonstrated that P2 is taken up by cells mainly via the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor pathway, we tried to increase the amount of drug delivered to cells by enhancing the LDL receptor expression. For this purpose, we used hydroxy methyl glutaryl Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors such as lovastatin. In the present work, we show that the calcium antagonist verapamil, which is currently used in human chemotherapy to overcome multidrug resistance, enhances in a synergistic manner the potentiating action of lovastatin on the photocytotoxic effect of P2.", 
    "59": "Squalene synthase catalyzes the committed step in the biosynthesis of sterols. Treating rats with zaragozic acid A, a potent inhibitor of squalene synthase, caused marked increases in hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase, HMG-CoA reductase, squalene synthase, and LDL receptor mRNA levels. The increase in HMG-CoA reductase mRNA fully accounted for the increases seen in enzyme protein and activity. Farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase mRNA and activity were only slightly increased by zaragozic acid A, while cholesterol 7 alpha hydroxylase mRNA levels were decreased substantially. When rats were pretreated with zaragozic acid A, there was no change in mRNA levels for the cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes or cholesterol 7 alpha hydroxylase upon subsequent treatment with mevalonolactone. Under these same conditions, the enzymatic activity of HMG-CoA reductase was also unaffected. Mevalonolactone treatment reduced the zaragozic acid A-mediated increase in hepatic LDL receptor mRNA levels. Feeding cholesterol eliminated the zaragozic acid A-induced increase in HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels. These results suggest that inhibition of squalene synthase decreases the level of a squalene-derived regulatory product, resulting in altered amounts of several mRNAs and coordinate increases in HMG-CoA reductase mRNA, protein, and activity. The increase in HMG-CoA reductase gene expression was closely related to the degree of inhibition of cholesterol synthesis caused by zaragozic acid A.",

They had all been treated previously with other hypocholesterolemic drugs, including the statins, forming a specific and homogeneous group with hypercholesterolemia and definite coronary risk. After 7 weeks with American Heart Association phase I diet and placebo drug, pravastatin was administered during 12 weeks. All patients received an initial daily dose of 10 mg for six weeks. After this period, this dose was increased to 20 mg. The levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, lipoprotein (a) and apolipoproteins A-1 and B were determined.",

The smaller effect observed with the more commonly used dosage (10 mg/day) was most probably due to the characteristics of the sample with already established hypercholesterolemia, being thus dependent of higher concentrations of medications, as observed in previous treatments in our outpatient clinic. Side affects with this drug were rare. No biochemical changes were observed that would interrupt the continuation of therapy.",

    "65": "Prevention of restenosis after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary balloon angioplasty (PTCA) continues to present the greatest therapeutic challenge in interventional cardiology. Experimental and pathological studies describe restenosis as no more than the biologic healing response to arterial injury. Studies of serial quantitative coronary angiography have demonstrated that this biologic process may be measured as the loss in minimal luminal diameter (MLD) from post-PTCA to follow-up angiography and that it is essentially ubiquitous and normally distributed. Thus, quantitative coronary angiography has become the gold standard for evaluation of the angiographic outcome of clinical trials of new agents and devices aimed at prevention of restenosis. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors inhibit biosynthesis of mevalonate, a precursor of non-sterol compounds involved in cell proliferation, and thus may control the neointimal response, which forms the kernel of restenosis. Experimental evidence suggests that fluvastatin may exert a greater direct inhibitory effect on proliferating vascular myocytes than other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, independent of any lipid-lowering action. The Fluvastatin Angioplasty Restenosis (FLARE) Trial was conceived, in collaboration between the Thoraxcenter, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, and Sandoz Pharma, to evaluate the ability of fluvastatin 40 mg twice daily to reduce restenosis after successful single-lesion PTCA. Treatment of suitable patients begins 2 weeks before PTCA and continues after successful PTCA (residual diameter stenosis < 50%, without major cardiac complications) to follow-up angiography at 26 +/- 2 weeks. Restenosis is measured by quantitative coronary angiography at a core laboratory as the loss in MLD from post-PTCA to follow-up angiography. It is calculated (90% power, alpha = 0.05) that 730 evaluable patients will be needed to test the hypothesis that fluvastatin will reduce the expected post-PTCA loss in MLD by 40%. Serial lipid analysis will be carried out at a central laboratory. Trial evaluation is focused on the primary endpoint (change in MLD) but includes primary clinical endpoints (death, myocardial infarction, or the need for coronary artery bypass graft surgery or reintervention up to 40 weeks after PTCA) as well as secondary and tertiary clinical, angiographic, and laboratory endpoints. According to this methodologic approach, the effect of fluvastatin in luminal renarrowing and clinical events after successful PTCA as well as possible associations of lipid parameters with restenosis can be comprehensively investigated.",

The progression and regression of atherosclerotic lesions will be assessed by quantitative angiography and positron emission tomography (PET) after 2.5 years of treatment. Patients were included in the trial if they had angiographically documented lesions that occluded 30-75% of the diameter of a major coronary vessel. Of the 429 subjects, 99 were also studied by PET at rest and during static exercise of sustained handgrip combined with administration of dipyridamole. All subjects were instructed in an American Heart Association/National Cholesterol Education Program (AHA/NCEP) Step I or Step II diet. Of the total, 107 subjects (25%) had low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) > or = 160 mg/dL and were given cholestyramine, 8 g/day. All subjects were randomized to placebo or fluvastatin, the newest 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor to be introduced into the U.S. market. Fluvastatin is entirely synthetic and is similar in efficacy to the other available HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Its pharmaceutical profile (i.e., low systemic exposure) makes fluvastatin a good candidate for use in combination lipid-lowering therapy. The majority of subjects were recruited through a community campaign and the remainder through cardiac catheterization laboratories and the medical records of hospitals in the Texas Medical Center. Approximately 8,500 prospects from the community campaign were screened and 272 were randomized, a conversion rate of approximately 3%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

For the present analysis, we identified 18 patients in the fluvastatin plus bezafibrate group (cohort 1) and 16 patients in the fluvastatin plus cholestyramine group (cohort 2) for whom complete dose-response data were available for the full 56-week duration of all 3 studies.

    "69": "Four inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase have been approved for treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Three of these are fungal metabolites or derivatives thereof: lovastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin. The fourth, fluvastatin, is totally synthetic. Its structure, containing a fluorophenyl-substituted indole ring, is distinct from that of the fungal metabolites. Lovastatin and simvastatin are administered as prodrugs, which undergo in vivo transformation to active inhibitory forms; fluvastatin and pravastatin are administered as active agents. The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are all effective in reducing plasma concentrations of low density lipoprotein. They have differing pharmacokinetic properties, which may be of importance in some patients. All of these drugs are very well tolerated, and there do not appear to be major differences in toxicity or adverse effects. When LDL reductions > 30% are needed, simvastatin is the most cost-effective HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. However, these drugs are most commonly used in dosages that reduce LDL-C by 20-30%. For this degree of LDL reduction, fluvastatin is the most cost-effective HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor.",

Seventy-four patients with plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels > or = 160 mg/dL were treated with fluvastatin, 20 mg/d, or placebo for 6 weeks. Thereafter, immediate-release niacin, at a dosage titrated to a maximum of 3 g/d, was added to both regimens for another 9 weeks. All adverse events were monitored, with particular attention to the evaluation of liver and muscle enzymes. Initial analysis of the data shows that fluvastatin and its combination with niacin was well tolerated and was not associated with any serious adverse events. Small, transient, asymptomatic rises in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) occurred in 28.9% of fluvastatin-niacin treated patients compared to 8.3% in the niacin-placebo control arm (p < 0.05). These were considered clinically insignificant in that no transaminase elevations > 3 times the upper limit of normal occurred. No evidence of myopathy, creatine kinase levels exceeding 10 times the upper limit of normal, myositis, or rhabdomyolysis were demonstrated in this short-term trial. The majority of adverse events resulting in patient withdrawals were ascribed to niacin therapy and included cutaneous vasodilatation, flushing, itching, and rash. These preliminary results suggest that fluvastatin, both alone and combined with niacin, is an effective, safe, and well-tolerated treatment for hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "71": "Clinical experience with fluvastatin in > 1,800 North American patients treated for an average of 61 weeks has shown it to be safe and well tolerated. Frequencies of transaminase and creatine kinase elevations compare favorably with those observed during long-term administration of other 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors. Further, whereas frank rhabdomyolysis has been encountered with treatment with all other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, this syndrome has not been observed to date with fluvastatin in studies here or abroad; a single case of myopathy, which was probably related to physical exertion, was reported in a patient receiving fluvastatin. Although dyspepsia was observed more commonly in fluvastatin patients the incidence, along with that of other adverse events (e.g., headache), and the number of treatment discontinuations proved statistically indistinguishable from those of placebo controls. Whether the favorable safety profile of fluvastatin is related to this synthetic agent's unique biopharmaceutical profile is a matter of ongoing long-term inquiry.", 
    "72": "Fluvastatin sodium (Lescol; Sandoz) the first entirely synthetic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor studied, is structurally distinct from the other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors currently available, all of which are fungal metabolites and analogues of compactin. Fluvastatin's distinct structure may be responsible for the biopharmaceutical properties that result in its low systemic exposure and, subsequently, low incidence of peripheral adverse events, such as headache and myositis. Fluvastatin is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract; has a 30-minute half-life, the shortest of any currently available HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (lovastatin, 15 hours; pravastatin, 2 hours; simvastatin, 15.6 hours); is highly selective for the liver, undergoing extensive first-pass metabolism; has no active circulating metabolites; and does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier, unlike lovastatin and simvastatin. The low systemic exposure suggests that the occurrence of peripheral adverse events, such as myositis, central nervous system effects, and drug-drug interactions, may be less than what is currently observed with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Neither niacin nor propranolol had an effect on fluvastatin plasma levels when combined with fluvastatin. In contrast to other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, fluvastatin in combination with niacin resulted in no instances of myositis or other serious adverse events. Although the interaction of fluvastatin with cholestyramine resulted in a lower rate and extent of fluvastatin bioavailability, this reduction had no impact on clinical efficacy.

Twenty-four men with primary hypercholesterolemia (low-density lipoprotein 4 to 7 mmol/liter) each received 2 of the following 3 treatments in a randomized, incomplete block, crossover design study: lovastatin (40 mg/day), pravastatin (40 mg/day), and placebo.

Lovastatin did not differ from placebo regarding any polysomnographic parameter except \"number of entries to wake,\" for which it produced fewer entries (i.e., change was in the direction of improvement). Pravastatin did not differ from placebo regarding any polysomnographic measures, but was associated with worsening in relation to lovastatin in the following parameters: sleep efficiency, entries to wake, percent rapid eye movement sleep, wake time during sleep, and total wake time. For each of these 4 parameters, although neither drug showed marked differences from placebo, the mean change in the lovastatin group was in the direction of improved sleep, whereas the change in the pravastatin group was in the direction of disturbed sleep.

    "78": "We examined the secretion of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) when hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, a rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis, was inhibited. To inhibit HMG-CoA reductase in liver, pravastatin sodium, a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, was administered to homozygous Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits, a low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient animal model, at a dosage of 50 mg/kg per day for 5 weeks. Although triglyceride levels were not changed, total cholesterol levels of sera and each atherogenic lipoprotein were decreased by approximately 30%. As a result, the percentage of cholesterol concentration in newly secreted VLDL was significantly decreased by 24%. The VLDL secretion rate was determined by intravenous injection of Triton WR-1339. The VLDL secretion rate was significantly decreased by 23% using cholesterol as an index, but it did not change using triglyceride, phospholipid, or protein as an index. It is concluded that one of the mechanisms of serum total cholesterol decrease due to reduction of the putative cholesterol pool of the liver in homozygous WHHL rabbits is caused by a decrease of cholesterol content in newly secreted VLDL particles.", 
    "79": "Anutritive isoprenoid constituents of fruits, vegetables, cereal grains and essential oils exhibit a spectrum of anticarcinogenic activities. The induction of hepatic Phase II detoxifying activities by dietary isoprenoids appears to underlie their blocking action. The second anticarcinogenic action of the dietary isoprenoids, suppression of the growth of chemically initiated and transplanted tumors is, we suggest, secondary to the inhibition of mevalonate pathway activities. Mevinolin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity, depletes cells of the intermediate products of the pathway that are required for the posttranslational modification of proteins, a process giving the proteins lipophilic anchors that bind to membranes. As a consequence, nuclear lamins and ras oncoproteins remain in nascent states, and cells do not proliferate. gamma-Tocotrienol, perillyl alcohol, geraniol and d-limonene suppress hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity, a rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis, and modestly lower serum-cholesterol levels of animals. These isoprenoids also suppress tumor growth. The HMG-CoA reductase of neoplastic tissues differs from that of sterologenic tissues in being markedly resistant to sterol feedback inhibition. Our review suggests that the mevalonate pathway of tumor tissues is uniquely sensitive to the inhibitory actions of the dietary isoprenoids.",

    "85": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors lovastatin and simvastatin inhibit the in vitro intraerythrocytic development of Plasmodium falciparum and Babesia divergens, with concentrations inhibiting parasite growth by 50% in the ranges of 10 to 20 and 5 to 10 micrograms.ml-1, respectively. For P. falciparum, the 50% inhibitory concentrations were in the same range whatever the chloroquine susceptibility of the strains tested (strain F32/Tanzania [chloroquine susceptible] or FcB.1/Columbia [resistant]). The stage-dependent susceptibility of P. falciparum to simvastatin was studied by subjecting synchronized cultures to 6-h pulses of drug throughout the 48-h erythrocytic life cycle. The most important inhibitory effects were observed between the 12th and 30th hours of the cycle, corresponding to the trophozoite stage. This period precedes the S phase and the nuclear divisions. Parasites in the newly formed ring stage (time zero to the 6th hour of the cycle) and the schizont stage (30th to 48th hour of the cycle) were weakly or not susceptible to simvastatin pulses.", 
    "86": "Niemann-Pick type C is an autosomal-recessive, neurovisceral storage disorder that results from defective cholesterol esterification. Cholesterol-lowering agents have been demonstrated to decrease hepatic lipids in Niemann-Pick type C patients. The objective was to determine the effects of cholesterol-lowering agents on neurologic features and to develop a noninvasive method of monitoring clinical response. A 9-month-old boy with progressive hepatosplenomegaly and neurodevelopmental delay was studied. Water-suppressed proton magnetic resonance spectra from a supraventricular volume of central white and gray matter revealed an abnormal lipid signal. The patient was treated with cholesterol-lowering agents (i.e., cholestyramine, lovastatin). Repeat standardized neurodevelopmental assessments (Peabody and Griffith scales) at 13 and 19 months were normal and magnetic resonance spectra no longer detected the previously observed lipid resonance. Early treatment of Niemann-Pick type C patients with cholesterol-lowering agents appeared to have short-term beneficial effects. Magnetic resonance spectra provided a noninvasive means of monitoring CNS response.", 
    "87": "Eight patients with biopsy-proven primary nephrotic syndrome were included in an open, prospective, two-year study of lovastatin. One patients was withdrawn after 6 months due to an asymptomatic rise in creatinine phosphokinase, which was rapidly reversed after interruption of lovastatin. In the remaining patients, treatment was well-tolerated and produced no side effects. After 2 years of treatment, these 7 patients had decreases in total cholesterol from 446 +/- 165 to 250 +/- 57 mg/dl (p < 0.001), LDL cholesterol from 343 +/- 121 to 174 +/- 49 mg/dl (p < 0.001), Apo B lipoprotein from 162 +/- 60 to 108 +/- 42 mg/dl (p < 0.05), triglycerides from 336 +/- 273 to 182 +/- 71 mg/dl (p < 0.04). There was no change in HDL cholesterol. The LDL/HDL cholesterol and the total/HDL cholesterol ratios fell from 15.0 +/- 12.1 and 19.1 +/- 17.2 mg/dl before the study to 4.4 +/- 1.2 and 6.3 +/- 1.6 mg/dl, respectively, at 2 years. A decrease in proteinuria from 8.6 +/- 4.6 to 5.0 +/- 3.7 g/24 h (p < 0.02) was noted in 4 patients on concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy. Renal function remained stable in all patients throughout the study, except for one whose moderate impairment progressed to end-stage renal failure requiring dialysis 3 months poststudy. We conclude that long-term lovastatin in patients with primary nephrotic syndrome is an effective and generally safe treatment for accompanying dyslipidemia.", 
    "88": "1. GR95030X, a potent inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, was administered daily to marmosets by gavage. In a Maximum Repeatable Dose (MRD) study, doses of up to 30 mg kg-1 day-1 were administered for 49 days. In a chronic study, animals received dosages equivalent to 0, 1, 2.5, 7.5 and 20 mg kg-1 day-1 for 204 or 205 days. Some animals were maintained without treatment for a recovery period of 29 or 30 days. 2. Clinical signs included poor coat condition, weakness with impaired coordination, lethargy and other behavioural changes. There was also alimentary disturbance, and some deaths occurred at doses of 20 mg kg-1 day-1 and above. 3. Adverse effects upon body weight were seen although some recovery was apparent after the cessation of treatment. 4. Serum cholesterol concentrations were reduced. Very large increases in serum ALT, AST and CK activities were recorded with CK-MM isoenzymes accounting for 80% or more of the total CK enzyme activity. 5. Treatment was associated with muscle fibre atrophy and a sarcolemmal response with little evidence of regeneration. Histological examination revealed vascular changes, glial proliferation and cell death in the brain, with no consistent distribution. Alveolar capillary congestion and alveolar proteinosis indicated that there may have been a reduction in cardiac function. 6. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have evident potential to cause myopathy in marmosets. This is believed to be the first report of such an effect.", 
    "89": "In vitro data suggests that lifibrol lowers plasma cholesterol by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis. We report that lifibrol is far less potent in vitro and in vivo than lovastatin for inhibiting 14C-acetate incorporation into sterols. Moreover, several major differences between lifobrol and lovastatin were noted in various animal models. In contrast, lifibrol exhibited several activities in common with gemfibrozil, another phenoxy-acid-type drug. Specifically, in normal rats lifibrol, like gemfibrozil, lowered plasma non-HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides, and increased liver weight and hepatic peroxisomal marker enzyme activities. Lovastatin only lowered plasma triglycerides. In cholesterol-fed rats lifibrol and gemfibrozil lowered non-HDL-cholesterol and elevated HDL-cholesterol while lovastatin was inactive. Finally, lovastatin but not lifibrol exhibited hypocholesterolemic activity in normal guinea pigs and resin-primed dogs. Our interpretation is that these data do not support the notion that lifibrol lowers plasma cholesterol in vivo by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis.", 
    "90": "After reviewing the literature concerning the advisability and efficacy of dyslipidemia treatment in old age, the authors present their experience with the use of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors. Twenty-five patients were treated with simvastatin and 20 with pravastatin. Already after one month of therapy, both drugs had induced a reduction of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides, as well as an increase of HDL-cholesterol. These changes were found to be even more marked after three months of treatment. Altogether, tolerability of both drugs was good. However, recurrent episodes of nose bleeding were observed in two patients with normal blood clotting activity.", 
    "91": "Four drugs that act as specific inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase--lovastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, and, most recently, fluvastatin--have been approved by regulatory authorities throughout the world. In the present review, we have critically assessed the comparative hypocholesterolemic effects of these four drugs based on direct comparative studies, which were randomized, double-blind, and included more than 25 patients per treatment group. All studies were conducted in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and the major end point of efficacy was reduction in the plasma concentrations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. Eight comparative trials have evaluated the efficacy and safety of lovastatin, simvastatin, or pravastatin, and one recently completed trial has compared lovastatin and fluvastatin. These trials confirm the log-linear dose response curves for all four of these drugs but indicate that on a milligram-for-milligram basis, lovastatin and pravastatin are approximately equipotent, whereas simvastatin is at least twice as effective per milligram of drug administered as lovastatin and pravastatin. Lovastatin at doses of 20 and 40 mg/d was of similar efficacy to fluvastatin at doses of 40 and 80 mg/d and would suggest that on a milligram-for-milligram basis, fluvastatin is half as potent as lovastatin. The side-effect profiles of all four drugs appeared similar, and earlier reports that suggested a higher incidence of sleep disorders in patients treated with the more lipophilic drugs, lovastatin and simvastatin, as compared with pravastatin, are not supported by more recent, controlled clinical trials. We conclude that although the currently available HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors differ in their relative hypolipidemic effects, as a class they constitute the most effective agents available to maximally reduce elevated concentrations of LDL-cholesterol.", 
    "92": "The parallel effects of simvastatin on cell cycle and PKC activity in rat C6 glioma cells were investigated. Simvastatin, 2.5 microM, for 24 h resulted in cell growth arrest in early G1 phase of the cell cycle and in a significant increase of total PKC activity (283 +/- 42 vs 470 +/- 61 pmoles/min/mg protein p = 0.002 for control cells and simvastatin-treated cells, respectively). The effect of simvastatin was fully prevented by mevalonate. A time dependent increase of PKC activity was observed in control exponentially free-growing C6 cells approaching confluency: a highly significant negative correlation (r = -0.91 p < 0.0001) between PKC activity and growth rate was calculated. PKC activity was high in cells arrested in G0 by serum starvation (0.4%). Following addition of complete medium (17.5% serum) the PKC activity progressively decreased and reached a minimum when cells traversed the G2/M phase, as determined by DNA analysis distribution. PKC activity dropped 30% in simvastatin-arrested early G1 cells; 44% in hydroxyurea-arrested cells at the G1/S boundary; and 73% in Colcemid mitosis-blocked cells. The results show that C6 glioma cell PKC activity is maximal in a G0 quiescent state and varies at different points of the cell cycle.", 
    "93": "When incubated under anoxic conditions, cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes undergo cell necrosis. Simvastatin-sodium, the bioactive metabolite of simvastatin (a potent serum cholesterol-lowering drug), delayed the anoxia-induced myocyte necrosis in a dose-dependent manner. This beneficial effect of simvastatin-sodium could not be attributed to its cholesterol-lowering properties. We found that simvastatin-sodium, at concentrations of 20 and 50 microM, attenuated the rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) measured with Fura-2 in anoxic cardiomyocytes. In a test of sarcolemmal Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity, simvastatin-sodium attenuated the rise of [Ca2+]i upon incubation in sodium-free buffer, which normally causes a reversal of Na+/Ca2+ exchange and cellular calcium overload. The inhibitory action of simvastatin-sodium on the sarcolemmal Na+/Ca2+ exchanger could well explain the cardioprotective effect of the drug on myocytes subjected to anoxia.", 
    "94": "A method for derivatization of (S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) by phenacylation in tetrahexylammonium hydrogensulphate as phase-transfer reagent and high-performance liquid chromatography of the HMG-diphenacyl ester is described. To avoid interference with buffers and other ions used to dissolve biological material, the alkaline hydrolysate of CoA esters has to be neutralized with phosphoric rather than hydrochloric acid. The latter reacts with phenacyl bromide. The pH during phenacylation has to be maintained in the range 6-7 to provide sufficient dissociation of HMG.", 
    "95": "The 7 alpha-methyl analog (II) of 3 beta-hydroxy-5 alpha-cholest-8(14)-en-15- one (I) was prepared by chemical synthesis and evaluated with respect to its effects on HMG-CoA reductase activity in CHO-K1 cells and on serum cholesterol levels in rats. The 7 alpha-methyl substitution had no detectable effect on the potency of I in lowering HMG-CoA reductase activity in the cultured cells. In contrast, the 7 alpha-methyl substitution had a marked effect on the action of I in the suppression of food consumption in rats. Whereas II was less potent than I in lowering serum cholesterol levels in rats, it did so at dosage levels at which only slight or moderate effects on food consumption were observed. Full 1H and 13C-NMR assignments for II and intermediates in its synthesis have been presented. Conformational analysis, based on 1H-1H coupling constants, NMR shieldings and force-field calculations, indicated that the 7 alpha-methyl substitution had virtually no effect on the conformation of the 15-ketosterol apart from minor distortions of ring B.", 
    "96": "trans-Ethyl 1,2,3,4a,5,6,8a-octahydro-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-5- isoquinoline-carboxylate was prepared by intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction as a precursor of newly designed aza-analogue of mevinolin.", 
    "97": "Statin is a 57 kDa nuclear protein exclusively found in noncycling cells. Its expression in hematolymphoid cells had not been examined previously. The authors studied statin immunoreactivity in nonneoplastic lymphoid tissues from 26 lymph nodes, 3 tonsils, and 2 spleens. Statin was detected primarily in small lymphoid cells and histiocytes, along with such accessory elements as fibroblasts and endothelial cells. The distribution of positive cells showed an inverse correlation with the proliferative activity of the various lymphoid compartments. Statin labeling was also quantified in 15 follicular lymphomas and compared with that in hyperplastic follicles. Although reactivity in benign germinal centers was less than that in neoplastic follicles, this difference did not prove statistically significant. Statin provides an alternative to proliferation-associated parameters, such as Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, in the analysis of hematolymphoid processes and may be helpful in the dissection of their kinetic heterogeneity.", 
    "98": "Cholesterol lowering over 1- to 3-year trials is associated with modest regression or no progression of focal coronary artery stenoses compared with progression in controls, a decrease in cardiac events proportionately more than the modest improvement in percent stenosis, and in experimental animals improved endothelial-mediated coronary vasodilation.", 
    "99": "Accordingly, we hypothesized that there would be improvement in size and severity of perfusion abnormalities by rest-dipyridamole positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in a randomized intensive cholesterol-lowering trial with each patient studied after a baseline control period, a 90-day intensive cholesterol-lowering treatment, and a final control period off cholesterol-lowering regimens. Completely automated, objective measures of size and severity of perfusion abnormalities on rest-dipyridamole PET images were made by computer algorithm in 12 patients with coronary artery disease. There were statistically significant decreases (improvement) in size and severity of perfusion abnormalities by rest-dipyridamole PET on comparison of baseline control with perfusion abnormalities after intensive 90-day cholesterol lowering and significant increases (worsening) in size and severity after the final control period, respectively, as follows. (1) The percent of left ventricle outside 2.5 SD of normal values on the dipyridamole-to-rest ratio image of normalized counts was 22 +/- 20% after the initial control period, 13 +/- 14% after the treatment period, and 26 +/- 22% after the final control period with a significant decrease (improvement) occurring between the initial control and treatment periods (P = .02) and an increase (worsening) occurring between the treatment and final control periods (P = .009). (2) The percent of left ventricle with a ratio of < or = 0.66 in the dipyridamole-to-rest ratio image of normalized counts was 11 +/- 13% after the initial control period, 5.8 +/- 10% after the treatment period, and 14 +/- 19% after the final control period with a significant decrease (improvement) occurring between the initial control and treatment periods (P = .04) and an increase (worsening) occurring between the treatment and final control periods (P = .02). (3) The myocardial quadrant on the polar display with the lowest average activity expressed as a percent of maximal activity was 0.81 +/- 0.18 after the initial control period, 0.87 +/- 0.014 after the treatment period, and 0.77 +/- 0.23 after the final control period with significant improvement occurring between the initial control and treatment periods (P = .05) and worsening occurring between the treatment and final control periods (P = .05).", 
    "100": "These results suggest that relatively short-term, intensive cholesterol lowering over 90 days improves myocardial perfusion capacity before anatomic regression of stenoses occurs and that such improvement, or deterioration after withdrawal of lipid-lowering treatment, can be followed noninvasively by dipyridamole PET, reflecting the integrated flow capacity of the entire coronary arterial/arteriolar vascular system affected by diffuse atherosclerosis.", 
    "101": "The role of altered ras oncoprotein (Ras) farnesylation and membrane association in the growth inhibitory effects of several monoterpenes (limonene, perillic acid, perillyl alcohol, menthol, pinene and cineole) was investigated in rat liver epithelial cells. All of the above compounds except cineole inhibited the growth of viral Ha-ras-transformed rat liver epithelial cells (WB-ras cells) at concentrations of 0.25-2.5 mM. These cells, however, were not necessarily more sensitive to these compounds compared to non-transformed and viral raf-transformed rat liver epithelial cells. Growth inhibition by limonene, perillic acid and pinene was only partially restored (20-50%) by supplementing the culture medium with 2 mM mevalonic acid. Western blot analyses of cytosolic and membranous fractions of WB-ras cells treated with monoterpenes indicated no change in Ras distribution. In contrast, lovastatin, a potent inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase and Ras farnesylation, specifically reduced WB-ras cell growth and increased cytosolic levels of Ras. Thus, monoterpene-induced growth inhibition of rat liver epithelial cells was dissimilar to lovastatin and did not appear to involve altered Ras plasma membrane association.", 
    "102": "Rabbits fed low-fat, cholesterol-free diets containing casein as the sole protein source develop endogenous hypercholesterolemia (EH). To test the hypothesis that lipoprotein cholesteryl esters in EH rabbits are acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) derived, we treated EH rabbits with CI-976, a potent and selective ACAT inhibitor. In addition, since cholesterol and bile acid synthesis as well as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor activity are reduced in EH rabbits, we determined whether changes in gene expression for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, 7 alpha-hydroxylase, and the LDL receptor might be associated with the efficacy due to ACAT inhibition. Compared with EH controls, CI-976-treated rabbits (50 mg/kg per day for 5 weeks) had decreased plasma total cholesterol (-43%), very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol (-62%), LDL cholesterol (-43%), plasma apolipoprotein B (-23%), liver cholesteryl esters (-39%), LDL size, VLDL and LDL cholesteryl ester content (percent of total lipids), cholesteryl oleate/cholesteryl linoleate ratios in VLDL and LDL (25% to 30%), and ex vivo liver ACAT activity. The triglyceride/cholesteryl ester ratio increased twofold to fourfold in these apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins. Endogenous cholesterol absorption appeared to be unaffected by drug treatment. CI-976 failed to alter specific hepatic mRNAs involved in cholesterol metabolism, but comparisons among dietary control groups revealed a marked reduction in 7 alpha-hydroxylase mRNA, no change in LDL receptor mRNA, and an increase in HMG-CoA reductase mRNA in EH rabbits compared with normal chow-fed controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
