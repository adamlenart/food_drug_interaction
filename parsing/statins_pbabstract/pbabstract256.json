The results showed that AC (0.40 g/kg) significantly inhibited the increase in serum triglycerides by 40% in fructose-fed mice. In mice induced by alloxan and high-fat diets, serum total cholesterol remained at a high level (180 - 220 mg/dl) within 7 days of removing high-fat diets but reached normal level (120 - 140 mg/dl) after AC (0.40 g/kg per day) treatment. Also, AC (0.40 and 0.80 g/kg) significantly inhibited serum lipids from the increase in Triton WR-1339-induced hyperlipidemic mice. AC (0.01 - 100 microg/ml) selectively activated lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity by 200% - 400% and significantly inhibited 3-hydroxyl-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase activity by 20% - 49% in vitro. Furthermore, 2 months of fenofibrate (0.20 g/kg) administration particularly increased mice liver weights (0.0760 +/- 0.0110 g/g) while AC (0.40 g/kg) had no effect (0.0403 +/- 0.0047). Taken together, these results suggest that AC will be a new potential natural product for the treatment of hyperlipidemia that exerts its actions through mechanisms of inhibiting HMGCoA reductase and activating LPL activities. Its action mechanisms differentiate from those with fibrates but may be partly similar to those with statins. It is hopeful that AC may serve as the adjuvant for fibrates.",

    "2": "Twelve patients with hypercholesterolemia were prospectively randomized in a crossover design to receive either fluvastatin (20 mg/d) or colestimide (3000 mg/d) for 12 weeks. The subjects were switched to the opposite arm for additional 12 weeks. Before and after first and second treatments, experiments were performed. Eleven age-matched volunteers with normal lipid profiles served as controls. ADP-induced platelet aggregation, platelet-derive nitric oxide (PDNO) release, intraplatelet levels of GSH and GSSG, and intraplatelet nitrotyrosine production during platelet aggregation were measured. Fluvastatin and colestimide equally lowered total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in hypercholesterolemia. Platelet aggregation was greater in hypercholesterolemia than in normocholesterolemia before treatment and was altered by fluvastatin. PDNO release, intraplatelet glutathione level, and GSH/GSSG ratio were lower in hypercholesterolemia than in normocholesterolemia before treatment and were increased by fluvastatin. Intraplatelet nitrotyrosine formation was greater in hypercholesterolemia than in normocholesterolemia, and decreased by fluvastatin. Colestimide did not have such effects. In vitro application of fluvastatin dose-dependently inhibited platelet aggregation. Furthermore, in vitro application of fluvastatin dose-dependently inhibited platelet nitrotyrosine expressions and the inhibitory effects by fluvastatin were reversed by preincubation with geranylgeranylpyrophosphate.",

Forty diabetic rats were randomized in two groups: one treated by cerivastatin (diabetic treated group, DT) and the other untreated (diabetic untreated group, DU). The data were compared to a group of normal rats.", 
    "6": "The peripheral capillary filtration of albumin (CFA) was studied on a limb by a non-invasive isotopic method, and nerve electrophysiological measurements were performed. Rats were followed-up until 6 months. In group DU albumin retention (AR) increased by 3 months and lymphatic uptake of interstitial albumin was impaired at 6 months. None of these disorders was observed in group DT. Motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities (MNCV and SNCV) were significantly slower at 6 months in group DU but not in group DT as compared to control rats. The duration of the sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) was significantly longer in group DU than in control rats at 6 months whereas it did not differ in group DT and in control animals.", 
    "7": "This study shows that cerivastatin may prevent the peripheral increase in CFA and lymphatic dysfunction induced by diabetes. These beneficial effects on microcirculation may be involved in the prevention of nerve function deterioration. The underlying mechanisms are likely to be independent of a lipid-lowering effect, but their clarification needs further investigations.",

He had undergone heart transplantation 7 years earlier and been receiving daily pravastatin therapy for >3 years without complaining of any symptoms. A physical examination of the patient at admission was unremarkable, except for dyspnea. However, laboratory testing revealed that his serum creative kinase (CK) concentration was substantially above the reference range. Pravastatin was immediately discontinued, and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for treatment. CK values declined after 3 days, and they returned to within reference range after 3 weeks. The patient was diagnosed with acute rhabdomyolysis; a score of 6 on the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated that pravastatin was the probable cause.", 
    "15": "The hydrophilic statin pravastatin is frequently recommended for patients who have undergone heart transplantation due to its favorable tolerability profile. Unlike lipophilic statins, hydrophilic statins such as pravastatin are not metabolized in the liver via the cytochrome P450 system and have little potential for adverse events through interaction with drugs metabolized via this pathway. Based on a search of relevant literature, this report appears to be the first to describe a case of asymptomatic rhabdomyolysis occurring in a patient receiving long-term daily therapy with pravastatin after undergoing heart transplantation and who had no muscular symptoms or history of intense physical exertion. The occurrence of acute statin-induced rhabdomyolysis in this case suggests that even hydrophilic statins may have the potential to damage myocytes.", 
    "16": "The hydrophilic statin pravastatin appears to have caused asymptomatic rhabdomyolysis, in the absence of physical exertion, in a patient who had undergone heart transplantation and had been receiving the drug for >3 years.

One hundred twenty-five nondiabetic patients at cardiovascular risk were randomized to pioglitazone (PIO), pioglitazone and simvastatin (PIO/SIM), or simvastatin (SIM) treatments. Blood samples were taken for the measurement of adiponectin and lipid levels. In addition, an oral glucose load with the measurements of glucose, insulin, and intact proinsulin levels was performed. Adiponectin levels increased from 14.0+/-8.2 to 27.6+/-14.5 microg/mL (P<.0001) during PIO treatment and from 11.7+/-10.0 to 26.7+/-15.7 microg/mL (P<.0001) during PIO/SIM treatment. A decrease in adiponectin levels from 15.5+/-12.7 to 11.6+/-7.0 microg/mL (P<.05) was observed during SIM treatment. Although fasting intact proinsulin levels remained unchanged, the increase in postprandial intact proinsulin levels could be reduced from 29.5+/-21.4 to 22.1+/-17.5 pmol/L (P<.01) during PIO treatment and from 24.3+/-27.4 to 21.1+/-16.5 mmol/L (P<.05) during PIO/SIM treatment.

Therefore, development and testing of new therapies that exploit the vascular protective effects of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) constitutes a rational and complementary approach. A number of HDL-based therapies are in various stages of development and testing. It is hoped that one or more of these new HDL-based therapies, if proven effective and safe, will become a part of our armamentarium against vaso-occlusive cardiovascular disease. A paradigm could emerge in which patients recovering from acute coronary syndromes and at high risk of recurrent events could be treated with rapid-acting HDL-based therapy, such as infusions of recombinant HDL or even HDL delipidation, followed by more sustained long-term HDL-based therapies, such as oral agents and perhaps even HDL-based gene therapy.",

Hypertension was a co-morbidity in almost half. Mean time (SD) since diagnosis was 5.8 (4.7) years. Where lipid profiles were available, less than one-third achieved the target LDL-C of <2.6 mmol L(-1). Almost all patients (96%) were candidates for treatment with a statin according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommendation, whereas only 6.6 and 38.5% were actually taking one in the regional and the teaching hospital, respectively. Over 90% should have been taking primary prophylactic aspirin, whereas only 5.7-29% were actually prescribed one. A few had existing cardiovascular/cerebrovascular disease, and all were taking aspirin. There was no documented proteinuria status; however, 30-50% were on a ACEI/ARB, most likely as part of an antihypertensive regimen.",

    "23": "The beneficial effect achieved by the treatment of endothelial dysfunction in chronic cardiovascular diseases is already an evidence belonging to the basic treatment of the disease. Given the fact that the vascular system is uniform and consubstantial both physiologically, pathophysiologically and in terms of therapy, and that it plays a key role in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) - a disease leading to tragic loss of vision with its etiology and therapy being unknown -, endothelial dysfunction should be treated. The pleiotropic effects of ACE-inhibitors, AR-blockers and statins help to restitute the balance between vasodilators and vasoconstrictors in endothelial dysfunction caused by oxidative stress, the balance of growth factors and their inhibitors, pro- and anti-inflammatory substances and prothrombotic and fibrinolytic factors, inhibit the formation of oxidative stress and its harmful effects; while aspirin with its pleiotropic effects acting as an antiaggregation substance on platelets helps to set the endothelial layer back to its normal balance regarding its vasodilating, antithrombotic, anti-adhesive and anti-inflammatory functions. For the above reasons it is suggested that, as a part of long term primary and/or secondary prevention, the following groups of patients with AMD receive - taking into consideration all possible side effects - ACE-inhibitor and/or AR-blocker and statin and aspirin treatment: 1) those without maculopathy but being over the age of 50 and having risk factors inducing endothelial dysfunction; 2) those, who already developed AMD in one eye as a prevention in the second, unaffected eye; and 3) those patients who developed AMD in both eyes in order to ameliorate or merely slow the progression of the disease. Besides, it is advisory to inhibit AMD risk factors inducing oxidative stress with consecutive endothelial dysfunction.", 
    "24": "Diabetics are subjects to a high cardiovascular risk. This concept is now accepted by all and has been demonstrated in clinical practice by the constantly increasing number of diabetic cardiac patients and cardiac diabetics. The many therapeutic trials carried out on the prevention of cardiovascular complications in diabetics have made it possible to define therapeutic goals. HbA1c must be less than 6.5%. Target blood pressure values are 130/80 mmHg or even 125/75 in the case of renal insufficiency. If conventional treatments have proven efficacy against stroke and coronary events, only molecules which modulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system provide additional nephroprotection in diabetics. However, single-agent therapy is seldom sufficient to achieve glycaemic or blood pressure targets. Diabetic dyslipidemia also requires attentive management, usually by a statin, with a target LDL cholesterol < 1 g/l at the onset of microalbuminuria. All these measures should make it possible to obtain a significant reduction in the cardiovascular risk of diabetic patients.", 
    "25": "Like other proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha may play an important role in the development of central nervous system injury following ischemic stroke. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of early treatment with simvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, on serum TNF-alpha level in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Patients with AIS (n = 36) were randomly assigned to the two groups: Group I (n = 18) treated with simvastatin 40 mg/day within 24 h after the onset of stroke and Group II (n = 18) not treated with the statin. Blood samples were obtained on days 1, 3 and 7 after stroke onset. Serum TNF-alpha level was significantly elevated on day 3 after the stroke onset in comparison to day 1 only in the simvastatin-treated group (increase in median values by 16.2% [p = 0.028] and 6.1% within 3 days in Group II and I, respectively). These findings indicate that simvastatin given within 24 h after the onset of stroke could prevent the increase in serum TNF-alpha level within 3 days.",

The purpose of this statement is to examine new evidence on the association of lipid abnormalities with early atherosclerosis, discuss challenges with previous guidelines, and highlight results of clinical trials with statin therapy in children and adolescents with familial hypercholesterolemia or severe hypercholesterolemia. Recommendations are provided to guide decision-making with regard to patient selection, initiation, monitoring, and maintenance of drug therapy.", 
    "27": "Statins exert anti-inflammatory, anti-atherogenic actions. The mechanisms responsible for these effects remain only partially elucidated. Diabetes and obesity are characterized by low-grade inflammation. Metabolic and endocrine adipocyte dysfunction is known to play a crucial role in the development of these disorders and the related cardiovascular complications. Thus, direct modulation of adipocyte function may represent a mechanism of pleiotropic statin actions. We investigated effects of atorvastatin on apoptosis, differentiation, endocrine, and metabolic functions in murine white and brown adipocyte lines. Direct exposure of differentiating preadipocytes to atorvastatin strongly reduced lipid accumulation and diminished protein expression of the differentiation marker CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-beta (CEBP-beta). In fully differentiated adipocytes, however, lipid accumulation remained unchanged after chronic atorvastatin treatment. Furthermore, cell viability was reduced in response to atorvastatin treatment in proliferating and differentiating preadipocytes, but not in differentiated cells. Moreover, atorvastatin induced apoptosis and inhibited protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation in proliferating and differentiating preadipocytes, but not in differentiated adipocytes. On the endocrine level, direct atorvastatin treatment of differentiated white adipocytes enhanced expression of the pro-inflammatory adipokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), and downregulated expression of the insulin-mimetic and anti-inflammatory adipokines visfatin and adiponectin. Finally, these direct adipotropic endocrine effects of atorvastatin were paralleled by the acute inhibition of insulin-induced glucose uptake in differentiated white adipocytes, while protein expression of the thermogenic uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) in brown adipocytes remained unchanged. Taken together, our data for the first time demonstrate direct differentiation state-dependent effects of atorvastatin including apoptosis, modulation of pro-inflammatory and glucostatic adipokine expression, and insulin resistance in adipose cells. These differential interactions may explain variable clinical observations.",

The genetic basis of statin-related muscle disorders is largely unknown. Because mutations in the COQ2 gene are associated with severe inherited myopathy, we hypothesized that common, mild genetic variation in COQ2 would be associated with inter-individual variation in statin intolerance. We studied 133 subjects who developed myopathy on statin monotherapy and 158 matched controls who tolerated statins without incident or complaint.",

    "35": "Approximately 20 to 40 percent of patients at high risk of cardiac-related morbidity develop myocardial ischemia perioperatively. The preferred approach to diagnostic evaluation depends on the interactions of patient-specific risk factors, surgery-specific risk factors, and exercise capacity. Stress testing should be reserved for patients at moderate to high risk undergoing moderate- or high-risk surgery and those who have poor exercise capacity. Further cardiovascular studies should be limited to patients who are at high risk, have poor exercise tolerance, or have known poor ventricular function. Medical therapy using beta blockers, statins, and alpha agonists may be effective in high-risk patients. The evidence appears to be the strongest for beta blockers, especially in high-risk patients with proven ischemia on stress testing who are undergoing vascular surgery. Many questions remain unanswered, including the optimal role of statins and alpha agonists, whether or not these therapies are as effective in patients with subclinical coronary artery disease or left ventricular dysfunction, and the optimal timing and dosing regimens of these medications.",

Etiology theories include neurohormonal activation, volume overload, and inflammation. Studies examining nonpharmacologic therapies have shown that maintenance of the anterior epicardial fat pad is not a viable prophylactic strategy. Biatrial cardiac pacing, especially in combination with amiodarone, is a viable preventive option. Withdrawal of preoperative beta-blockers places patients at higher risk for atrial fibrillation; these drugs should be continued postoperatively. Evidence exists supporting the use of amiodarone, sotalol, and magnesium in addition to beta-blockers. Since most of these strategies work by attenuating neurohormonal activation, adverse events, including hypotension and bradycardia, are of concern. Adding agents with antiinflammatory properties, including hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors or corticosteroids, may prove to be of benefit. Additional studies using novel therapies are needed in addition to established preventive strategies.",

We did not observe any effects of VEGF on VSMCs apoptosis, on survivin and survivin mRNA expression, and on Fas and Fas mRNA expression in VSMCs after treatment with atorvastatin. At 48 hours after the start of transfection, survivin protein expression was significantly reduced after transfection with 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 microg/ml of survivin ASODN and there was no survivin protein expression after transfection with 3.0 and 4.0 microg/ml of survivin ASODN.

    "54": "The IDEAL trial showed that high-dose treatment with atorvastatin was associated with fewer non-fatal myocardial infarctions (MI) or coronary heart disease death (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.78-1.01) and major cardiovascular events by (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.77-0.98) or any coronary event (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.76-0.91) than simvastatin with no significant difference in the number of serious adverse events. Costs during the trial period was estimated based on the trial data and a Markov model was constructed where the risk of MIs and revascularization procedures and the long-term costs, quality of life, and mortality associated with these events was simulated. Costs were based on resource consumptions recorded in the trial multiplied with recent unit costs from each country. Both direct health care costs and indirect costs (costs from lost production due to work absence) were included. Intervention lasted for the duration of the trial (4.8 years) while health-effects and costs are predicted for the lifespan of the patient. The main outcome was quality adjusted life-years (QALY) gained. High-dose treatment was predicted to lead to a mean increase in survival of 0.049 years per patient and 0.033 QALYs gained. The cost to gain one QALY was predicted to 47,197euro (Denmark), 62,639euro (Finland), 35,210euro (Norway), and 43,667euro (Sweden), with cost-effectiveness ratio decreasing with higher risk.",

    "69": "Gastrointestinally active agents such as cholesterol absorption inhibitors (CAIs) (eg, ezetimibe) and bile acid sequestrants (BAS) (the resins cholestyramine and colestipol, or colesevelam, a nonabsorbable polymer) offer important options for lipid-lowering therapy. Ezetimibe is a novel CAI that inhibits the absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol without affecting the absorption of triglycerides or fat-soluble vitamins. In clinical trials, there has been no evidence of increased rates of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis associated with ezetimibe, whether in use as monotherapy or in a combination with statin therapy, although there exist case reports of possible ezetimibe-associated myopathy. Ezetimibe alone does not appear to increase liver transaminase levels significantly, but the coadministration of a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) with ezetimibe marginally increases this risk. However, reported increases in liver enzymes have not been associated with clinically meaningful symptoms and often return to baseline levels after the discontinuation of therapy or with continued treatment. To date, no cases of liver failure, liver transplantation, or death have been reported. BAS have been used clinically since the 1960s for lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Because they are not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract into the blood, these agents do not contact most body organs and are therefore systemically safe. However, case reports and pharmacokinetic data disclose 3 kinds of adverse effects: (1) the decreased absorption of concomitant medications and sometimes of certain vitamins; (2) the physicochemical alteration of intestinal contents leading to constipation and, very rarely, intestinal obstruction; and (3) modest increases in plasma triglyceride levels due to the alteration of hepatic lipid metabolism. The newest BAS, colesevelam, has greater specificity for bile acids compared with the older agents cholestyramine and colestipol, eliminating most drug interactions and reducing the tendency for constipation. Overall, CAIs and BAS have excellent systemic safety profiles when used alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering drugs.", 
    "70": "Fibrates are an important class of drugs for the management of dyslipidemia. This class of drugs is generally well tolerated but is infrequently associated with several safety issues. Fibrates, most likely by an effect mediated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha, may reversibly increase creatinine and homocysteine but are not associated with an increased risk for renal failure in clinical trials. Fibrates are associated with a slightly increased risk (<1.0%) for myopathy, cholelithiasis, and venous thrombosis. In clinical trials, patients without elevated triglycerides and/or low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) levels, fibrates are associated with an increase in noncardiovascular mortality. In combination with statins, gemfibrozil generally should be avoided. The preferred option is fenofibrate, which is not associated with an inhibition of statin metabolism. Clinicians are advised to measure serum creatinine before fibrate use and adjust the dose accordingly for renal impairment. Routine monitoring of creatinine is not required, but if a patient has a clinically important increase in creatinine, and other potential causes of creatinine increase have been excluded, consideration should be given to discontinuing fibrate therapy or reducing the dose.", 
    "71": "Niacin has beneficial effects on plasma lipoproteins and has demonstrated clinical benefits in reducing cardiovascular events and atherosclerosis progression. The side effects of niacin, however, have limited its use in general clinical practice. An understanding of cutaneous flushing based on the best available evidence should enhance patient education efforts and improve adherence. Although serious hepatic toxicity from niacin administration has been reported, it is largely confined to the use of slow-release formulations given as unregulated nutritional supplements. Niacin has been shown to induce insulin resistance in short-term trials, but the glycemic response in subjects with and without diabetes is usually minor. Niacin can be used safely in patients with diabetes. Despite a few case reports of myopathy associated with niacin-statin (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor) combination therapy, 2 decades of clinical evidence since the introduction of statins do not support a general myopathic effect of niacin either alone or in combination with statins. Rare, less well-defined side effects of niacin include blurred vision due to cystoid macular edema, nausea and vomiting, and the exacerbation of peptic ulcers. Laboratory abnormalities that are usually small (< or =10%) and clinically unimportant include increased prothrombin time, increased uric acid, and decreases in platelet count and serum phosphorus. Overall, the perception of niacin side effects is often greater than the reality. As a result, a valuable medication for cardiovascular risk is underused.", 
    "72": "The use of fibrates in the management of lipoprotein disorders has a history dating back to the mid-1960s. This group of drugs has now been tested in several large long-term trials with cardiovascular end points. Overall, there is good evidence for the reduction of cardiovascular disease in primary prevention studies and in those of subjects with manifest disease. More recent trials have suffered from high interference due to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) introduction, particularly in their placebo control groups. However, there is very good evidence for overall safety from a combined study of >20,000 patients in these controlled clinical trials lasting approximately 5 years. Abdominal pain has been observed more frequently in the statin vs placebo group. Myopathy, liver enzyme elevations, and cholecystitis have been potential adverse reactions of interest. However, these have occurred at a very low rate and are rarely found to be statistically more frequent in the active-treatment group compared with the subjects taking placebo. The recent Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study found a slightly higher incidence of pancreatitis, deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. Small creatinine and homocysteine elevations are observed in many patients taking fibrates, and the effect of this on long-term outcomes is under study. The FIELD study also described a significant reduction in the rates of progression of proteinuria and vascular retinopathy with fibrate therapy. To date, there has been no study exclusive to patients with elevated triglycerides, raising the question of the potential benefit of these drugs in patients with the lipid abnormalities most effectively treated with fibrates.",

Endothelial dysfunction (ED), which is an early manifestation of vascular injury, has been shown in patients with ADPKD. Statins have a beneficial effect in the reversal of ED. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a statin, simvastatin, on ED in patients with ADPKD. Sixteen patients with ADPKD having well-preserved renal function were included in the study. Endothelial function of the brachial artery was evaluated by using high-resolution vascular ultrasound. Endothelial-dependent dilatation (EDD) was expressed as the percentage change in the brachial artery diameter from baseline to reactive hyperemia. After the baseline evaluations of EDDs, patients were started treatment with simvastatin at a dose of 40 mg/day and were treated for six months. EDDs were recalculated after one and six months of therapy. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were also measured as markers of inflammation. Baseline EDD was 11.3 +/- 6.9% in patients with ADPKD. After one month of simvastatin treatment, EDD increased significantly to 14.6 +/- 4.6 % (P = 0.016 versus baseline). Endothelial-dependent dilatation further increased significantly to 18.9 +/- 7.5 % (P = 0.011 versus baseline, P = 0.048 versus first month) after six months of therapy. There was also a significant decrease in the level of IL-6 from 21.6 +/- 21.7 pg/mL to 9.1 +/- 3.5 pg/mL (P= 0.002). Six months of simvastatin therapy resulted in a significant improvement of ED in patients with ADPKD. This finding may be in part related to the pleiotropic effects of simvastatin.",

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) produced by chondrocytes play an important role in the development of cartilage destruction in OA, and agents that can target against MMPs activity may be of therapeutical value. There were reports that statins can inhibit the secretion of MMPs in vitro and in vivo, which were believed to account for the plaque stabilizing effects of statins in the treatment of atherosclerosis. We based our hypothesis on that atherosclerosis possesses some aspects that are similar to that of osteoarthritis, such as inflammation and matrix degradation. Since statins have displayed great benefits in modifying the progression of atherosclerosis via anti-inflammatory and matrix-stabilizing mechanisms, it is conceivable that statins may also prevent the disease progression of osteoarthritis. Further work are needed to verify if statins can protect cartilage from destruction through inhibition of MMP secretion by chondrocytes, and their potential to be used as therapeutic agents in OA should be investigated.", 
    "106": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is strongly associated with atherosclerosis in the coronary and carotid arteries, leading to a highly increased incidence of myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke and cardiovascular death. Fortunately, pharmacological interventions in large clinical trials have been as effective in subgroups of patients with PAD as in subjects with other atherosclerotic disease. Antiplatelet treatment is indicated in virtually all patients with PAD. Aspirin 75-325 mg day(-1) is considered as first-line treatment, and clopidogrel 75 mg day(-1) is an effective alternative. Statin therapy is indicated to achieve a target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of < or = 2.5 mmol L(-1) in patients with PAD and there is emerging evidence that even lower levels are beneficial. Lowering of plasma homocysteine by supplementing folic acid, vitamin B(12) and vitamin B(6) is not recommended in patients with mild to moderate hyperhomocysteinaemia in the 12-25 micromol L(-1) range, since it does not reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events. Antihypertensive treatment is indicated to achieve a goal blood pressure of < or = 140/90 mmHg or < or = 130/80 mmHg in the presence of diabetes or chronic kidney disease. All classes of antihypertensive drugs are acceptable for treatment of hypertension in patients with PAD, but angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ramipril or perindopril are especially appropriate because they reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events beyond their blood pressure-lowering effects. Beta-blockers should not be used as first-line antihypertensive treatment. Diabetic patients with PAD should reduce their glycosylated haemoglobin to < or = 7%. In conclusion, pharmacological secondary prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with PAD should be as comprehensive as that in patients with established coronary or cerebrovascular disease.",

    "111": "Community pharmacists surveyed had undertaken an array of continuing education and felt confident to undertake cardiovascular risk assessment. However, very few sales of OTC simvastatin had been made and a variety of issues were identified, particularly relating to the evidence base, access to clinical information, cost and the product licence.", 
    "112": "3-Hydroxy-3-methyl-glytaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (\"statins\") have been proved to be extremely useful in the management of hypercholesterolemia, as well as in prevention of primary and secondary coronary heart disease. However, they may produce rare but severe muscle-related symptoms such as myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Recent findings in vitro have shown that statins can reduce cardiomyocyte viability. The exact mechanism of statin myotoxicity still remains unclear. Diltiazem as CYP3A4 inhibitor, is a well recognized risk factor of skeletal muscles myopathy, if co-administered with simvastatin. It is not known whether such interaction affects myocardial efficiency causing biochemical changes. The experiments were performed on thirty six New Zealand white rabbits. The animals were divided into four groups receiving: 0.2% MC (control group): diltiazem (5 mg/kg); simvastatin (50 mg/kg) or diltiazem + simvastatin, daily for 14 days (po). The following biochemical parameters were estimated: creatine kinase (CK), serum transaminases (ALT and AST), as well as myocardial injury markers: troponin I (Tnl) and creatine kinase MB (CK-MB). Simultaneous administration of simvastatin and diltiazem caused 23-fold increase (p < 0.01), in rabbit serum CK levels and 20-fold increase (p = 0.056) in TnI levels, as compared to the initial values. Also in these rabbits significant increase in CK (12411,60 vs 839.87 IU/L) and TnI (0,26 vs 0,014 ng/mL), as compared to control group were observed. Significant increase in CK (12411,60 vs 1100,92 IU/L) and TnI (0,26 vs 0,012 ng/mL), as compared to diltiazem alone were noted, too. This may suggest another mechanism of drug-drug interaction than the one based on CYP3A4 inhibition if the impact on cardiac or skeletal muscle is considered.", 
    "113": "To study the protective effect of rosuvastatin on ischemic brain injury and its mechanism, focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion was induced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) using the intra-luminal filament technique. The cerebral blood flow was monitored with laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF). The slices of brain tissue were stained with cresyl-violet. The cerebral volume of infarction and edema were quantified with Image J software. The expressions of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and activated caspase-3 were detected with Western blot. The inducible NO synthase (iNOS) positive cells were immunohistochemically observed. The results demonstrated that rosuvastatin (20 mg/kg) could remarkably decrease infarct volume and cerebral edema after MCAO 90 min/reperfusion 24 h. Western blots showed that the expression of eNOS in cerebral cortex before and after ischemia was (100+/-43.3) %, (1668.9+/-112.2) % respectively (P<0.001), rosuvastatin significantly up-regulated the expression of eNOS in non-ischemic cortex (P<0.001), whereas in ischemic cortex of rosuvastatin group the expression of eNOS was (1678.8+/-121.3) %. There was no expression of activated caspase-3 in non-ischemic cortex, nonetheless the expression of activated caspase-3 increased after ischemia, and rosuvastatin significantly diminished it (P<0.01). Immunohistochemistry revealed no iNOS-positive cells in non-ischemic brain area, while in ischemic brain area the number of iNOS positive cells went up, and rosuvastatin could significantly reduced them. Consequently, the mechanisms of rosuvastatin's neural protection on ischemic brain injury are to enhance expression of eNOS, to inhibit expression of iNOS and activated caspase-3.", 
    "114": "In the UK, about 5% of men and 3% of women have, or have had, angina. Also, estimates suggest that, each year, around 340,000 people present with the symptom for the first time. Characterised by pain or discomfort in the chest, angina is usually caused by atherosclerotic coronary artery disease and so carries an increased risk of cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction and death from coronary heart disease (CHD). In stable angina, the symptoms are induced by exertion, reflecting the limitation of blood supply through the narrowed arteries and the resulting myocardial ischaemia. The condition is not only potentially distressing, but may also limit daily function and quality of life. To address these problems and the elevated cardiovascular risk, standard management includes lifestyle measures (e.g. physical activity without excessive exertion, stopping smoking, weight control); tackling other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. raised blood pressure, diabetes mellitus); and medication to control angina (e.g. nitrates, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists) and to reduce overall cardiovascular risk (e.g. aspirin, statin therapy). Where such non-invasive measures alone are inadequate, revascularisation (restoration of adequate blood supply to the heart muscle) by using coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may also be needed. Here we discuss methods for, and difficulties in, assessing patients who present with suspected stable angina to identify those who could benefit from revascularisation.", 
    "115": "Animal studies have suggested that the reduction in stroke risk observed with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) therapy is owing to an increase in basal cerebral blood flow (CBF). The purpose of the study was to determine if statin therapy was associated with increased CBF in humans with cerebrovascular atherosclerotic disease. Quantitative measurements of CBF were obtained on study entry in 97 patients with carotid artery occlusion enrolled in a prospective study of cerebral hemodynamics and stroke risk. This study represents a post hoc analysis of CBF measurements based on whether patients were receiving statin therapy at the time of CBF measurement. Global and regional CBF (including hemispheric, basal ganglia, and arterial borderzones), and baseline clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory stroke risk factors were compared between the two groups. Nineteen of the 97 patients were on a statin agent on study entry. The statin group was younger, had significantly lower LDL levels and included more women. Statin therapy was not associated with higher baseline values of CBF in global or regional analyses. Mean middle cerebral artery territory CBF (+/-s.d.) ipsilateral to the occluded carotid artery was 37.6+/-12.7 mL/100 g min for the statin group (n=19) compared with 38.6+/-12.7 mL/100 g min for the nonstatin group (n=78). Contralateral values were 42.9+/-13.5 and 44.2+/-13.3 mL/100 g min for the statin and nonstatin groups, respectively. We conclude that the stroke risk reduction observed with statin therapy in humans likely involves mechanisms other than an increased basal CBF.",

Mean CIMT levels were the same in both populations, and the percentage of individuals with > or = 2 CHD risk factors was similar. Increased baseline CIMT (> 2 mm) was related to increasing age, male gender, smoking, hypertension and lipid levels.",

Each subject received one 160 mg valsartan tablet or one 40 mg simvastatin tablet or co-administration of valsartan (160 mg) and simvastatin (40 mg) tablets for 7 days, with a 7-day inter-dose washout period.

These results indicated that the area under the curve of plasma concentration from 0 to 24 hours (AUC(0-24)) of valsartan, simvastatin beta-hydroxy acid and simvastatin was increased by 14%, 19%, and 23%, respectively, with the combination treatment. In addition, the maximum concentration (C(max)) of valsartan and simvastatin beta-hydroxy acid was increased by 10% and 22%, respectively, and the C(max) of simvastatin was decreased by 26% with the combination treatment.

Reductions in mortality, MI, and stroke predominantly contributed to the reduction in cardiovascular events in men taking statins. Women did not have a reduction in mortality or stroke, suggesting that the reductions in cardiac events may have been predominantly due to reductions in need for revascularization and/or unstable angina.",

Although angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-adrenergic blockers have been broadly used as evidence-based therapies in heart failure, morbidity and mortality remains high. Furthermore, treatment for acute decompensated heart failure and diastolic heart failure (or 'heart failure with preserved ejection fraction') is far from perfect. This review provides a broad overview of some of the novel compounds under investigation for the treatment of heart failure. Novel strategies include drugs that aim to alleviate congestion and improve hemodynamics, drugs that preserve renal function, drugs that reduce arterial and myocardial stiffness, drugs that module myocardial contractility, drugs that affect metabolic and hormonal balance, and drugs that act on existing and novel physiologic targets.", 
    "131": "In order to characterize the metabolic syndrome it becomes necessary to establish a number of diagnostic criteria. Because of its impact on cardiovascular morbidity/mortality, considerable attention has been focussed on the dyslipidemia accompanying the metabolic syndrome. The aim of this review is to highlight the fundamental aspects of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and the treatment of the metabolic syndrome dyslipidemia with recommendations to clinicians. The clinical expression of the metabolic syndrome dyslipidemia is characterized by hypertriglyceridemia and low levels of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C). In addition, metabolic syndrome dyslipidemia is associated with high levels of apolipoprotein (apo) B-100-rich particles of a particularly atherogenic phenotype (small dense low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol [LDL-C]. High levels of triglyceride-rich particles (very low-density lipoprotein) are also evident both at baseline and in overload situations (postprandial hyperlipidemia). Overall, the 'quantitative' dyslipidemia characterized by hypertriglyceridemia and low levels of HDL-C and the 'qualitative' dyslipidemia characterized by high levels of apo B-100- and triglyceride-rich particles, together with insulin resistance, constitute an atherogenic triad in patients with the metabolic syndrome. The therapeutic management of the metabolic syndrome, regardless of the control of the bodyweight, BP, hyperglycemia or overt diabetes mellitus, aims at maintaining optimum plasma lipid levels. Therapeutic goals are similar to those for high-risk situations because of the coexistence of multiple risk factors. The primary goal in treatment should be achieving an LDL-C level of <100 mg/dL (or <70 mg/dL in cases with established ischemic heart disease or risk equivalents). A further goal is increasing the HDL-C level to >or=40 mg/dL in men or 50 mg/dL in women. A non-HDL-C goal of 130 mg/dL should also be aimed at in cases of hypertriglyceridemia. Lifestyle interventions, such as maintaining an adequate diet, and a physical activity program, constitute an essential part of management. Nevertheless, when pharmacologic therapy becomes necessary, fibrates and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are the most effective drugs in controlling the metabolic syndrome hyperlipidemia, and are thus the drugs of first choice. Fibrates are effective in lowering triglycerides and increasing HDL-C levels, the two most frequent abnormalities associated with the metabolic syndrome, and statins are effective in lowering LDL-C levels, even though hypercholesterolemia occurs less frequently. In addition, the combination of fibrates and statins is highly effective in controlling abnormalities of the lipid profile in patients with the metabolic syndrome.",

    "133": "The prevention of cardiovascular disease is critically dependent on lipid-lowery therapy, including statins, cholesterol absorption inhibitors, fibrates and nicotinic acid. Statins are the most prescribed drugs in lipid lowering therapy with variability in response and almost one third of the patients do not meet their treatment goals. The severe adverse effects of treatment with cerivastatin stimulated the search for new genes and gene variations affecting pharmacokinetics, drug-drug interactions and pharmacodynamics. Moreover, instead of monotherapy, combined therapy of statins with ezetemibe and niacin was considered. This led to the identification of CD13, NPC1L1 and HM74A as new targets and CYP2C8 and glucuronidation enzymes as potential targets for drug-drug interactions. Moreover multiple polymorphic sites and pleiotrophic gene targets were reinvestigated in larger cohorts and the relevant pathogenetic factors start to evolve.",

    "135": "Adults with Down syndrome (DS) are at significantly higher risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) than the general population, but there is considerable variability in age at onset. This study tested the hypothesis that total cholesterol (TC) levels are related to vulnerability, and that the use of statins may decrease risk. The relation of TC level and statin use to risk of AD was investigated in 123 Caucasian adults with DS. Evaluations included serial assessments of cognitive, adaptive and maladaptive behavior, medical records, and neurological examinations. Mean length of follow-up was 5.5 years [1.2-7.1] for the entire sample, 5.1 years [1.2-7.1] for subjects who developed dementia, and 5.6 years [1.5-7.1] for those who did not develop dementia. Controlling for covariates, participants with TC>or=200mg/dL were more than two times as likely to develop AD than subjects with lower TC [hazard rate (HR)=2.59, p=.029, 95% CI: 1.1, 6.1]. In contrast, participants with higher TC levels who used statins during the study, had less than half the risk of developing AD than participants with higher TC levels who did not use statins (HR=.402, p=.095, 95% CI: .138, 1.173). If the protective effects of statins can be further validated, these findings suggest that their use may delay or prevent AD onset in vulnerable populations.", 
    "136": "Sepsis is a severe inflammatory disorder that may lead to multiple organ failure. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is associated with Gram-negative sepsis and can activate monocytes and macrophages to release pro-inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), nitric oxide (NO) and anti-inflammatory mediator such as interleukin-10 (IL-10). In this present study, we used fluvastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, to study its effects upon LPS-induced endotoxic shock in conscious rats.", 
    "137": "The experiments were designed that rats received an intravenous injection of 1mg/kg fluvastatin followed 10min later, by an intravenous injection of 10mg/kg Klebsiella pneumoniae LPS, the latter inducing endotoxic shock amongst conscious rats. Subsequently, the levels of certain biochemical variables and cytokines in serum were then measured during the ensuing 48-h period following sepsis. These included total cholesterol (TCH), triglyceride (TG), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cre), creatine phosphokinase (CPK), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate transferase (GOT), alanine transferase (GPT), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-10 and nitric oxide.", 
    "138": "LPS significantly increased blood TG, BUN, Cre, LDH, CPK, GOT, GPT, TNF-alpha, IL-10 and NO levels but decreased the blood TCH level. Pretreatment of test rats with fluvastatin decreased blood levels of certain markers of organ injury, suppressed the release of TNF-alpha and increased IL-10, and NO levels following LPS treatment. Fluvastatin did not affect the blood TCH and TG level subsequent to the development of sepsis.", 
    "139": "Pre-treatment with fluvastatin suppresses the release of plasma TNF-alpha, increases plasma IL-10, and NO production, and decreases the levels of markers of organ injury associated with endotoxic shock, so ameliorating LPS-induced organ damage amongst conscious rats.", 
    "140": "Statins are cholesterol-lowering drugs extensively used for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events related to hypercholesterolemia. Because of their capacity to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, statins also block the production of isoprenoids required for post-translational modification of proteins such as Ras superfamily GTPases, which are master regulators in signaling pathways triggered by surface receptors. As such, statins have pleiotropic effects on many cell types. In the immune system, statins harbor strong anti-inflammatory properties, which result from their capacity to interfere with the activation of proinflammatory cells, including macrophages and endothelial cells. More recently, T-lymphocytes have been identified as cellular targets of statins. Here we shall review recent findings, which document an inhibitory activity of statins on T-cell activation, proliferation, differentiation to Th1 cells and migration across the blood-brain barrier. The therapeutic perspectives of these findings, based on animal models and ongoing clinical trials, will also be discussed.",

The therapeutic action of NCX 6550 was also tested in mice lacking the gene for endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS).", 
    "143": "In normoglycaemic or STZ-diabetic CD1 mice, only NCX 6550 stimulated skeletal muscle revascularisation. In addition, NCX 6550 induced greater improvement in limb reperfusion and salvage, than pravastatin. The number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells was decreased in STZ-diabetic mice, this defect being prevented by NCX 6550 and, to a lesser extent by pravastatin. In vitro, high glucose concentrations reduced the migratory capacity of endothelial progenitor EPCs, which was partly reversed by preincubation with pravastatin and completely reversed by NCX 6550. The postischaemic recovery of eNOS knockout mice was severely impaired as a consequence of depressed angiogenesis and this recovery was improved by treatment with NCX 6550, but not with pravastatin.",

    "145": "Experimental data and preliminary clinical studies suggest that lipid-lowering drugs might have a beneficial effect on restenosis after coronary angioplasty. Recently, statins have been focused on prevention of restenosis after coronary stent implantation. However, their benefit has not yet been established. The authors studied the effects of statins on stent restenosis. We compared retrospectively the quantitative coronary angiographic (QCA) variables between 62 dyslipidemic patients treated with statins (pravastatin or fluvastatin) and 62 normolipidemic patients, as a control, treated without statins after undergoing successful coronary stent implantation with 6-month follow-up angiography from May 1999 to December 2002. Major cardiac events were about the same in both groups. Each of the QCA variables before and immediately after coronary stenting was similar in the 2 groups. At follow-up angiography, however, minimal lumen diameter (MLD) (2.12 -/+ 0.73 vs 1.78 -/+ 0.7; p < 0.01) was larger in the statin group than in the normolipidemia group. Both restenosis rate (15% vs 31%; p = 0.05) and target lesion revascularization rate (10% vs 24%; p = 0.05) were lower in the statin group than in the normolipidemia group. Statin reduced restenosis rate. The efficacy of statins appears to be dependent on their pleiotropic effects on vascular wall rather than on lipid-lowering effects.", 
    "146": "Inflammation contributes importantly to all stages of atherosclerosis, including the onset of acute thrombotic complications. In clinical trials, statins are beneficial in the primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. Moreover, statins have been shown to possess several pleiotropic properties independent of cholesterol lowering in experimental settings. Based on these premises, we investigated the anti-inflammatory and anti-atherothrombotic properties of rosuvastatin in vivo, testing its effect on cholesterol and monocyte accumulation, and on adhesion molecules and tissue factor (TF) expression. ApoE-deficient female mice were fed a cholesterol-rich diet containing rosuvastatin (0, 1, 2 or 10 mg kg(-1)d(-1)) for 12 weeks. Treatment with rosuvastatin did not significantly affect either body weight gain or plasma total cholesterol (C) and triglyceride levels. However, rosuvastatin treatment dose-dependently reduced ICAM-1 expression in the aortic valves (V) (up to 40% inhibition, p<0.05) and in the proximal segment of the ascending aorta (AA) (-50%, p<0.001). Similarly, rosuvastatin inhibited VCAM-1 expression in the V (-40%) and in the AA (-35%, p<0.05). Moreover, there was a reduced accumulation of macrophages in the V in a dose-dependent and statistically significant manner (-45%, p<0.01). These anti-inflammatory effects were reflected in a reduction of cholesterol deposition in the entire aorta, both in the free and in the esterified form. Finally, the expression of tissue factor, the most potent pro-thrombogenic agent, was consistently reduced in AA by rosuvastatin treatment (-71%, p<0.001). Altogether, these data demonstrate that rosuvastatin has anti-inflammatory and anti-atherothrombotic activities in apoE-deficient mice that could translate in a beneficial effect on atherogenesis.", 
    "147": "Increased lipoprotein-associated PLA(2) (Lp-PLA(2)) predicts the future development of cardiovascular diseases. Although lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC) produced by Lp-PLA(2) may contribute to its proatherogenic activity, the relation between Lp-PLA(2) and lyso-PC content in LDL remains unclarified. We determined the correlation between lyso-PC content in LDL and serum concentrations of Lp-PLA(2), chemokines, oxidative and inflammatory markers and microvascular complications in 32 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus free of macroangiopathy. We also investigated the effect of simvastatin treatment on Lp-PLA(2) and lyso-PC content in 26 hypercholesterolemic patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 1-palmitoyl lyso-PC was measured using electrospray ionization-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and Lp-PLA(2) by ELISA. Lyso-PC content in LDL was significantly higher in diabetic patients than in control healthy subjects. Lyso-PC content correlated significantly with Lp-PLA(2) levels (r=0.56, p<0.0001), and was significantly higher in patients with preproliferative or proliferative retinopathy and those with nephropathy than the control. Simvastatin treatment reduced serum Lp-PLA(2) and lyso-PC content in LDL. Our findings suggest that Lp-PLA(2) has the proatherogenic activity by contributing to the production of lyso-PC in circulating LDL.",

    "152": "In patients with stable coronary artery disease, elevated levels of biomarkers of inflammation, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) > or = 2.0 mg/L, are predictors of future vascular events. Because long-term low-dose colchicine is a safe and effective means of dampening inflammation, we conducted an open-label pilot study to determine whether it could significantly lower hs-CRP in patients with stable coronary artery disease in whom hs-CRP was > or = 2.0 mg/L despite taking both aspirin and high-dose atorvastatin therapy. Plasma hs-CRP was measured in 200 patients with clinically stable coronary artery disease who were taking aspirin and atorvastatin. In 64 patients, hs-CRP was > or = 2.0 mg/L. In 20 of these patients, hs-CRP was measured again at 2 weeks (no treatment group), and in 44 patients, hs-CRP was measured again after 4 weeks of open-label colchicine 0.5 mg twice daily (treatment group). In the no treatment group, mean baseline hs-CRP did not decrease significantly, measuring 4.28 +/- 2.03 mg/L at baseline and 3.70 +/- 2.30 mg/L after repeated measurement (mean change 11.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -30% to +9%, p = NS). In contrast, hs-CRP decreased in all patients administered colchicine, with mean baseline hs-CRP decreasing from 4.58 +/- 2.05 to 1.78 +/- 1.38 mg/L (p <0.001), an absolute decrease of 2.80 mg/L (95% CI 2.40 to 3.65 mg/L) and a relative decrease of 60% (95% CI 54% to 67%). In 28 patients (64%) in this group, the decrease in hs-CRP was >50% from baseline, and in 31 patients (70%), hs-CRP decreased to <2.0 mg/L. No significant side effects were reported. In conclusion, low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg twice daily) can effectively decrease hs-CRP in patients with clinically stable coronary artery disease and increased hs-CRP independent of aspirin and atorvastatin use. Additional controlled studies are warranted to confirm this observation and determine whether long-term use of low-dose colchicine can improve clinical outcomes in patients with advanced vascular disease.",

The potential beneficial effect of lipid-lowering therapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is not well known. This was an observational analysis of 4,739 patients who underwent first-time isolated CABG at a single institution from 1995 to 2001. Patients were categorized into 2 groups based on treatment with a lipid-lowering agent within 30 days before surgery. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine the association between lipid-lowering therapy and survival to hospital discharge. Patients in the lipid-lowering group (n = 2,334) tended to be younger (mean age 66 +/- 10 vs 68 +/- 10 years), were more likely to be diabetic (31% vs 28%), and on beta blockers (77% vs 70%) than patients in the nonlipid-lowering group (n = 2,405). In-hospital mortality was significantly lower in the lipid-lowering group than in the nonlipid-lowering therapy group (1.4% vs 2.2%, odds ratio 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.40 to 0.96, p = 0.03). A multivariable model demonstrated a loss of statistical significance for the effect of lipid-lowering therapy on in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio 0.83, 95% confidence interval 0.5 to 1.37, p = 0.46). In conclusion, preoperative use of lipid-lowering therapy in patients undergoing CABG appears safe and is associated with improved survival to hospital discharge compared with patients not receiving lipid-lowering therapy. However, patient risk factors and other cardioprotective medication use associated with the use of preoperative lipid-lowering therapy appear to explain the association with improved survival.", 
    "154": "We sought to test the platelet inhibitory and anti-inflammatory effects of a higher statin dosage compared with combined treatment with ezetimibe plus a low statin dose.", 
    "155": "Reducing the level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with statins induces important pleiotropic effects such as platelet inhibition. An insufficient LDL-C reduction often is treated with ezetimibe, an intestinal cholesterol absorption inhibitor, in combination with a low statin dose. It is not known whether this combination therapy has the same pleiotropic effects as a statin monotherapy.", 
    "156": "Fifty-six patients with coronary artery disease were assigned randomly to receive either 40 mg/day of atorvastatin or 10 mg/day of ezetimibe plus 10 mg/day of atorvastatin for 4 weeks. The levels of LDL-C, platelet activation markers after stimulation, platelet aggregation, and plasma chemokine levels (i.e., regulated on activation normally T-cell expressed and secreted [RANTES]) were measured before and after changing lipid-lowering medication.", 
    "157": "Platelet activation markers (P-selectin) after stimulation (adenosine diphosphate) were reduced by 40 mg/day of atorvastatin (-5.2 +/- 1.6 arbitrary units) but not by ezetimibe plus low-dose atorvastatin (2.1 +/- 1.8 arbitrary units; p < 0.005) despite a similar reduction of LDL-C (atorvastatin -1.01 +/- 0.18 mmol/l vs. ezetimibe plus atorvastatin -1.36 +/- 0.22 mmol/l, p = NS). Thrombin receptor-activating peptide-induced platelet aggregation as well as plasma RANTES levels were reduced by 40 mg/day of atorvastatin but not by ezetimibe plus low-dose atorvastatin.", 
    "158": "Platelet reactivity and a proinflammatory chemokine were reduced more by the higher atorvastatin dose than by ezetimibe plus low-dose atorvastatin. In patients with coronary artery disease, it might be important to combine ezetimibe with higher statin dosages to benefit from cholesterol-independent pleiotropic effects.", 
    "159": "We have introduced a heterologous coculture model between Ehrlich ascites tumor (EAT) and baby hamster kidney cells (PtK2), and we have studied the influence of PtK2 cells and their newly synthesized cholesterol on uptake and tumor cell proliferation. PtK2 cells produce about five times more cholesterol as compared to EAT cells, and they support tumor cell growth in coculture experiments. This growth stimulation is reduced by 80% when EAT cells are cultured in PtK2 cell-derived medium in the presence of a monoclonal anti-low-density lipoprotein receptor (anti-LDL(r)) antibody. Freshly synthesized cholesterol by PtK2 cells is taken up by EAT cells in a time-dependent manner amounting to a threefold increase after 24 h. Alternatively, cholesterol transfer to EAT cells is decreased between 28% and 35%, when PtK2 cell cholesterol synthesis is inhibited in the presence of mevinolin, the specific inhibitor of the hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. Furthermore, lower levels of EAT cell LDL receptor induced by antisense technology reduces cholesterol uptake and cell proliferation. These data demonstrate a metabolic interaction between normal and tumor cells mediated via the exchange of cholesterol, an important membrane constituent.", 
    "160": "Etiology of stroke and dementia in young adults are challenging clinical problems, and these diseases often have devastating consequences. We present a case where a final etiologic diagnosis is not possible, in spite of an exhaustive study.", 
    "161": "A 34-year-old man presented with a 5-year history of transient neurological deficits. Examination disclosed a cortico-subcortical dementia, but no other deficits. Laboratory evaluation was unremarkable, including the basic vascular study, homocystein, immunologic study, ACE, serology for Lyme, syphilis and HIV, tests for mitochondrial cytopathy, CADASIL and Fabry's disease, and CSF study. Prothrombotic study was normal except for a heterozygous mutation for factor V Leiden and for methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase. Cardiac exams (electrocardiogram, transesophagic echocardiography and 24 h-ECG) were normal. Cervical and transcranial duplex ultrasound and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)-were normal, except for a hypoplasic right vertebral artery. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed corticosubcortical atrophy and multiple infarcts. The patient was prescribed antiplatelet and statin therapy, and is presently clinically stabilized after 3 years of follow-up, scoring 2 in modified Rankin scale.", 
    "162": "Differential diagnosis of young onset vascular dementia is wide, including a number of rare sporadic and hereditary diseases. Although our case has a heterozygotic mutation for factor V Leiden, this might not explain the whole clinical picture; furthermore, there is no history of other vascular events, as venous thrombosis. An extensive investigation did not lead to a final etiological diagnosis. Nevertheless, even in these cases prevention with antiplatelet and statin might lead to clinical stabilization.", 
    "163": "To observe the effect of simvastatin carried by poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) on residual ridge resorption following tooth extraction.", 
    "164": "Sixty male Wistar rats were divided into experimental groups and control groups (30 rats/group). PLGA was immediately implanted with or without simvastatin into extraction sockets of the mandibular incisors. Soft X-ray photography, bone mineral density (BMD) and histopathologic study were conducted at 7, 14, 28, 56, and 84 days after implantation.", 
    "165": "The relative length values of residual alveolar ridge of the experimental groups were greater than those of the controls at 14, 28, 56, and 84 days after implantation, and there was a significant difference between the experimental and control groups (P < 0.05). The BMD of the specific region was higher in the experimental groups [(7.101 +/- 0.025), (7.178 +/- 0.039), and (7.162 +/- 0.052) g/cm(2)] than that in the control groups [(7.074 +/- 0.014), (7.117 +/- 0.012), and (7.059 +/- 0.037) g/cm(2)] (P < 0.05) after 28, 56, and 84 days. Light microscopy showed that bone formation rate and quality of the experimental group were better than those in the control group at the same time.", 
    "166": "Simvastatin carried by PLGA could induce bone formation of tooth socket. Local application of simvastatin would be potential to preserve the length and bone volume of alveolar ridge after tooth extraction.", 
    "167": "Currently, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are the main, if not the only, lipid target in the effort to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. Several primary and secondary CVD prevention trials with statins shaped current guidelines and provided detailed targets across a range of CVD risk categories. These targets can be attained using effective statins or combination therapy. However, the net benefit in CVD risk reduction may be improved if we address other lipid risk factors. High density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) emerges from epidemiological studies as the most promising target. This review links the increase in HDL-C levels with clinical benefit from \"old\" (e.g. sustained release niacin) and new treatment options. Synthetically produced recombined apolipoprotein A-I Milano administered intravenously seems to have a marked effect in reducing the atheroma burden. The anti-cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) vaccine (CETi-1) produces auto-antibodies against CETP thus increasing the cholesterol ester content in HDL particles. CETP inhibitors (e.g. JTT-705 and torcetrapib) seem to be the most promising regimen to increase HDL-C levels. Torcetrapib (already in phase IIIa studies) can substantially increase HDL-C levels (up to 106%), alone or in combination with atorvastatin. HDL-C strategies, in combination with effective statins, are a new drug target aimed at a further reduction in CVD morbidity and mortality compared with statin monotherapy.", 
    "168": "The current 3rd edition of the Italian Society of Nephrology guidelines has been drawn up to summarize evidence of key intervention issues on the basis of systematic reviews (SR) of randomized trials (RCT) or RCT data only. In the present guideline, evidence of the efficacy of statins in chronic kidney disease patients (CKD, non-dialysis patients) is presented.", 
    "169": "SR of RCT and RCT on statins in CKD (non-dialysis) patients were identified referring to a Cochrane Library and Renal Health Library search (2005 update). Quality of SR and RCT was assessed according to current methodological standards.", 
    "170": "Three SR and 36 RCT were found addressing this intervention issue. Methodological quality of the relevant RCT was suboptimal. There is no enough evidence to suggest that statins are associated with a significant reduction in the risk of serum creatinine doubling or of end-stage renal disease in CKD patients (evidence from SR and RCT). Statins compared to placebo or no treatment are associated with significant improvements in proteinuria (evidence from SR). Statins are also associated with significant reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality in CKD patients (evidence from SR and RCT) and in renal transplant recipients (evidence from RCT), and no significant increases in the risk of rhabdomyolysis and hepatotoxicity in CKD patients.", 
    "171": "Available evidence supports the hypothesis that statins should be recommended in CKD patients (non-dialysis patients) on the basis of significant evidence of cardiac and renal protection and no evidence of significant harms. Further studies are necessary to test this hypothesis in selected patient populations.", 
    "172": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most frequent genetic disorders, with a prevalence of around 1:3500. The most important concern for patients and their families is the increased risk of developing benign and malignant tumours in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Up to 80% of patients, however, experience difficulties in learning processes. Symptoms compatible with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are present in as many as 60% of patients. Learning difficulties are the chief cause of morbidity throughout their lives.", 
    "173": "Some recent studies have made it possible to offer a better description of the cognitive and developmental phenotype in patients with NF1. Similarly, advances in our understanding of the underlying molecular and cellular processes in cognitive impairment and access to sophisticated molecular genetics techniques have allowed a number of scientific disciplines to work together in the search for an understanding and potential solution to the cognitive disorders in this population.", 
    "174": "Preclinical studies show the enormous potential of certain pharmacological interventions. Transferring the results obtained in the treatment of learning difficulties in animal models of NF1 to the treatment of patients is a step that is currently under development. If it were effective, it would open the door to numerous areas of research that would rapidly increase our knowledge and the possibilities of intervention in this and many other learning disorders.", 
    "175": "Hypercholesterolemia has been identified as a risk factor for bioprosthetic valvular degeneration, and it has been suggested that statin therapy reduces this risk. The case of a 77-year-old man with low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and apolipoprotein B who developed marked LDL-C crystal deposition and a severe foreign body giant cell reaction 21.5 years after aortic bioprosthetic replacement is reported. This observation confirms that cholesterol deposition contributes to bioprosthetic valve degeneration, but that this can occur even in patients with low levels of LDL-C. It suggests that the characteristics of the valve are more critical than the patient's level of LDL-C.", 
    "176": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) presents an enormous and growing burden on the Canadian health care system. Elevated serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are an established, major risk factor in the development of premature CVD. There is strong evidence that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, or statins, significantly lower both low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and CVD risk. However, there is currently a treatment gap, in that a large segment of the population who should be receiving statins due to elevated serum cholesterol levels are not. Individuals at moderate risk of developing CVD represent one large population segment that is currently being undertreated. This group may be a candidate for receiving over-the-counter (OTC) or behind-the-counter (BTC) statins, which may be a suitable primary prevention strategy. Nonetheless, it must be noted that hypercholesterolemia is a complex, chronic condition that must be carefully managed and requires close consultation with a health care practitioner. The advantages and disadvantages of OTC or BTC statin usage must therefore be carefully weighed before any potential introduction of OTC or BTC statins in Canada.", 
    "177": "Up-regulation of local monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) production is involved in glomerular damage through macrophage recruitment and activation in diabetic nephropathy. Advanced glycation end-products induced chemokine production in cultured mesangial cells and podocytes. Statins prevented recruitment of macrophages to the glomeruli, suggesting that statins may have the ability of anti-inflammation. In the present studies, we investigated the effects of pravastatin in the carboxymethyllysine (CML)-induced MCP-1 expression in mouse differentiated podocytes.", 
    "178": "MCP-1 gene and protein expressions were examined using RT-PCR and ELISA. Dichlorofluorescein-sensitive intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was measured by confocal microscopy. Activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), nuclear factor (NF) kappaB and Sp1 were studied using Western blotting and immunocytochemistry.", 
    "179": "MCP-1 was induced by CML in a time- and dose-dependent manner. CML-induced MCP-1 mRNA and protein production were inhibited by 0.1 or 1 mM pravastatin. CML rapidly generated intracellular ROS in podocytes. Pravastatin did not have any ability of blocking ROS generation. Phosphorylated ERK was found in podocytes incubated with CML and was prevented by pravastatin in a dose-dependent manner. Both Western blotting and immunocytochemistry results suggested that pretreatment of podocytes with pravastatin prevented the CML-induced NF-kappaB and Sp1 translocation.", 
    "180": "These results suggest that pravastatin prevents CML to induce MCP-1 expression in podocytes via modulation of the intracellular ERK/NF-kappaB and Sp1 signalling pathway.", 
    "181": "Enhanced production of collagen is central to fibrotic disorders such as hepatic cirrhosis and pulmonary fibrosis. We describe a sensitive, quantitative, and high-throughput technique for measuring hepatic collagen synthesis in vivo through metabolic labeling with heavy water ((2)H(2)O). Rats and mice received (2)H(2)O in drinking water for up to 35 days. Deuterium incorporation into collagen-bound amino acids (AA) alanine and hydroxyproline (OHP) was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A threefold stimulation of collagen fractional synthesis was observed under the maximum dosage of carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4); 1.67 ml/kg). Deuterium enrichment was systematically 20% higher in AA from monomeric collagen relative to dimeric collagen, consistent with slower turnover of the latter. Administration of 1% griseofulvin to mice resulted in a significant, threefold increase in liver collagen synthesis, observable within 12 days and consistent with predicted interstrain differences (C57/Bl6J > BALB/c). Deuterium enrichments of OHP from total liver proteins correlated well with alanine or OHP from isolated collagen. Fibrogenesis subsided after withdrawal of CCl(4) exposure and was reduced to various degrees by coadministration of interferon-gamma, rosiglitazone, atorvastatin, or enalapril. Changes in isotopically measured collagen synthesis correlated with, but were more sensitive and reproducible than, standard histological staining (trichrome) for fibrosis. In summary, liver collagen synthesis can be measured sensitively and with high precision over a short time period, without radioactivity, thereby providing a relatively high-throughput in vivo strategy for rapidly measuring profibrotic activities of suspected hepatotoxicants and antifibrotic activities of drug candidates.", 
    "182": "In patients with chronic renal disease, other lipid markers than total cholesterol or low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol are probably more appropriate to detect a potential lipid-related risk for progression to renal failure. Statin therapy might be protective.", 
    "183": "From 1999 to 2001, 177 consecutive patients with renal disease from our out-patient clinic were included and 169 could be followed-up for a mean period of 4.1 years. Seventy-two progressive patients (end-stage chronic renal disease or >5 ml/min/year decrease of creatinine clearance) were compared in 97 patients with stable or slowly progressive disease (<5 ml/min/year decrease). Throughout the study all patients were treated according to nephrology guidelines. Atorvastatin was instituted in patients with elevated LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) after the baseline determinations", 
    "184": "Proteinuria, mean arterial pressure and the type of underlying renal disease were independently associated with progressive renal disease. After adjustment for these factors and whether or not statin therapy was started, an increase in plasma apo B concentration was the most predictive lipid parameter for renal failure. An increase in apo B from 0.77 g/l (10th percentile) to 1.77 g/l (90th percentile) was associated with progressive loss of renal function, represented by an odds ratio of 2.63 (95% CI: 1.02-6.76; P = 0.045). Treatment with atorvastatin in the dyslipidaemic patients to lower LDL-C, was also accompanied by a reduction of proteinuria in this group (P < 0.001). The patients who reached the target level for LDL-C of <2.6 mmol/l in response to atorvastatin showed less often progression than patients with higher LDL-C (P = 0.010).", 
    "185": "A high apo B at baseline appeared to be the strongest risk factor among various lipid parameters for progression of renal failure during the following years. Atorvastatin, aimed at lowering LDL-C, reduced proteinuria. Renal outcome was better in patients with the lowest LDL-C on treatment.", 
    "186": "Activation of T-lymphocytes is an important component of inflammatory and infectious processes, including HIV infection. It is regulated via the actions of various cell-surface receptors, including CD4 and CXCR4. We examined the roles of CD4 and CXCR4 in the adhesive interaction of CD4+T-cells with the vascular endothelium. CD4+Jurkat cells were incubated in the presence or absence of anti-CD4 to stimulate CD4, or with SDF-1 alpha, a cognate ligand of CXCR4. Stimulation of CD4 or CXCR4 each significantly enhanced cell adhesion. We next stimulated the two receptors together, using gp120, a component of HIV. This enhanced cell adhesion was greater than stimulation of CD4 or CXCR4 individually. Western blotting revealed that stimulation of CXCR4 by SDF-1 alpha significantly increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in Jurkat cells. Treatment with anti-CD4 also activated ERK1/2, although to a lesser extent. When the expression of CD4 was reduced by siRNA transfection, both CD4-dependent adhesion and MAPK activation were diminished. Furthermore, pre-treatment with fluvastatin, significantly attenuated observed Jurkat cell adhesion. These findings indicate novel mechanisms of CD4+ T-cells recruitment to activated endothelium via CD4 and CXCR4, which are modulated by statin.", 
    "187": "The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy and tolerability of ezetimibe in cardiac transplant recipients who were intolerant of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) or unable to reach target lipid levels with statin therapy. After treatment with ezetimibe (n = 16), mean total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased significantly (228 +/- 40 mg/dl to 197 +/- 48 mg/dl, p = 0.003; and 149 +/- 34 mg/dl to 117 +/- 39 mg/dl, p < 0.001, respectively). One patient required a reduction in ezetimibe dose owing to myalgias; no other adverse events occurred. This initial experience indicates that ezetimibe is well tolerated in cardiac transplant recipients and is effective in reducing total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels."
