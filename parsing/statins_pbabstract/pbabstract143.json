The effective management of this highly prevalent condition is largely dependent on the identification of the prevailing pathogenic mechanism, the implementation of lifestyle changes and the appropriate use of pharmacological agents and revascularization techniques. There is abundant literature on management of chronic stable angina, but publications are generally devoted to focused areas. There is a need for a comprehensive review that addresses both the different types of angina and their pathogenic mechanisms, as well as rational approaches to patient management.",

A careful clinical history, the implementation of appropriate diagnostic tests and a rational use of antianginal drugs and revascularization protocols often ensure the successful control of the patient's symptoms.", 
    "3": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been associated with increased cardiovascular risk (CVR) markers, but population studies have not clarified whether there is an increase in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Four different PCOS phenotypes resulted from the Rotterdam criteria that may differ in their CVR potential, thus introducing further complexity. This has led to studies using surrogate CVR markers including biomarkers in blood and imaging such as flow-mediated vasodilatation. In PCOS, both peripheral and central insulin resistance (IR) have been shown. Weight loss has been shown to improve IR and visceral fat, while insulin sensitizer therapies with metformin or thiazolidinediones improve IR and endothelial dysfunction. IR is also found in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease that in turn is very common in PCOS; studies have suggested that IR may be improved by treatment with metformin and omega-3 fish oils. PCOS patients have a more dyslipidemic phenotype that is worse in 'classical PCOS' associated with a higher CVR. Studies with atorvastatin and simvastatin have reported a decrease in the lipid parameters and an improvement in CVR indices including IR, but it is unclear whether this is due to their lipid-lowering action or a pleiotropic effect of the statin. In this expert opinion review, the relevant literature published during the last 2 years was considered. It focuses on some recent important data that has emerged while also exposing the gaps that remain in our knowledge that need to be addressed.",

    "8": "Subclinical coronary artery disease (CAD) is widespread and under-diagnosed. Preventive efforts are required to reduce the burden of this disease and its complications. Imaging of coronary artery calcium (CAC) with cardiac computed tomography is highly specific for the diagnosis of subclinical CAD and can also facilitate treatment decisions in preventive cardiology. Indeed, CAC testing has been recommended by the American Heart Association for asymptomatic patients at intermediate risk for future cardiac events (as defined by clinical risk factors) to refine existing risk estimates. However, the optimal follow-up of those patients who have already undergone CAC testing remains unclear, particularly with regards to repeat CAC testing. The existing literature points to two major considerations for the use of CAC progression in the management of subclinical CAD. On one hand, CAC progression has been used as a surrogate marker to test the efficacy of cardiac preventive medications in halting or regressing CAD. To date, study results have been mostly disappointing and CAC progression appears resistant to medications such as statins. On the other hand, however, CAC progression has potential as a clinical indicator of underlying CAD activity. This may facilitate optimization or up-titration of preventive medications by using CAC progression as a marker of subclinical disease activity. We believe that the data, thus far, argues against the use of a CAC progression as a clinical surrogate marker of preventive therapy efficacy. Further studies with non-statin medications and with concomitant outcome data are needed. However, CAC progression has potential for monitoring subclinical CAD in some patients and may facilitate treatment decisions. In this review we will provide recommendations for repeat CAC testing and discuss when repeat CAC testing may be helpful to assess coronary artery disease progression.",

Total cholesterol (TC), LDL-c and apoB were reduced after each treatment (p<0.001). Triglycerides, VLDL-c and apoAI were reduced only after atorvastatin (p<0.05), whereas triglycerides and VLDL-c were increased after HT (p=0.01). HT women had lower reduction on TC, LDL-c and apoB than AT and HT+AT groups (p<0.05). APOE mRNA expression was reduced after atorvastatin treatment (p=0.03). Although LXRA gene expression was not modified by atorvastatin, it was correlated with APOE mRNA before and after treatments. Basal APOE mRNA expression was not influenced by gene polymorphisms, however the reduction on APOE expression was more pronounced in \u025b3\u025b3 than in \u025b3\u025b4 carriers.

It has been suggested that the mechanism is reduced synthesis of coenzyme Q10 (coQ10) and a subsequent dysfunction of the respiratory chain. A literature review resulted in insufficient evidence supporting this theory. It is uncertain whether intramuscular levels of coQ10 and mitochondrial function are affected by statin therapy and whether the symptoms of myopathy can be alleviated with coQ10 supplementation. Nevertheless, due to a favourable safety profile, coQ10 can be tested in patients whose muscular symptoms cannot be managed otherwise.",

The mechanisms for the adverse effects remain to be fully elucidated for safer chronic use and drug development. The results of our earlier work suggested that hydrophobic statins induce autophagy in cultured human rhabdomyosarcoma A204 cells. In this study, we first confirmed the statin-induced autophagy by assessing other criteria, including induced expression of the autophagy-related genes, enhanced protein degradation of autophagy marker protein p62 and electron microscopic observation of induced formation of autophagosome. We next demonstrated that the extent of inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase in the cell is parallel with the ability of a statin to induce autophagy. Thus, the primary activity of statins causes autophagy in A204 cells. Considering the mechanism for the induction, we showed that statins induce autophagy by depleting cellular levels of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) mostly through an unknown pathway that does not involve two major small G proteins, Rheb and Ras. Finally, we demonstrated that the ability of statins to induce autophagy parallels their toxicity to A204 cells and that both can be suppressed by GGPP.",

In the elderly patients with cardiovascular disease, preventive measures are of great benefit. Smoking cessation results in substantial gains in LE and is more effective than most other interventions. Lipid lowering with statins is cost effective and the intensity of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering correlates with the risk reduction of cardiac events and stroke without increasing the risk of cancer. A quality-adjusted life year costs US $ 18,800, less than the costs of a nursing home for 1 year. Exercise training decreases cardiovascular events and improves quality of life. The benefits of the Mediterranean diet are based on a small randomized trial, which is supplemented by a large observational database. A reduction in all-cause, cardiovascular disease, and cancer mortality is highly likely. Blood pressure lowering reduces stroke and all-cause mortality above the age of 80; however, the target blood pressure should be around 150/80 mmHg or slightly lower. Annual vaccination against influenza is one of the most cost-effective methods to prolong life and should not be forgotten in patients with cardiovascular disease above the age of 65.

The present study was conducted to assess the effect of simvastatin on ameliorating the gentamicin-induced renal injury in 87 Sprague-Dawley rats, which were allocated randomly to 11 study groups: (A) and (B) groups with only gentamicin in 2 dosages; (C), (D), and (E) gentamicin 50 mg/kg/day and simvastatin with different dosage; (F), (G), and (H) gentamicin 80 mg/kg/day and simvastatin with different dosage; (I) only simvastatin; (J) Injected normal saline; (K) control (no gentamicin and no simvastatin) group. Our study intervention period for injection of drugs was 12 days. Serum creatinine level and clearance were measured in all groups. At the end of the study, the rats were killed and both kidneys were removed and processed for histopathologic examination using the standard methods. The 50 mg/kg/day dose was utilized because it induces a mild form of renal toxicity, whereas the 80 mg/kg/day dose cause a more severe degree of renal injury. Morphologic examination of specimens from all rats was qualitatively assessed with blindness to treatment groups and proximal tubular profiles that were presented in each file were counted. The results demonstrated amelioration of gentamicin-induced renal toxicity in rats by simvastatin due to its antioxidant drug dose-related effect.",

On the other hand, it has been shown that statins can affect growth and survival of solid tumour and leukemic cells, thus they have been proposed in the treatment of neoplasias as multiple myeloma, in association with drugs, as thalidomide, known to act on the cancer microenvironment. In the current view, tumor microenvironment include many cell types that interact with tumor cells: among them, stromal and endothelial cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, the various types of lymphocytes such as NK cells, B and T cells. The interplay between all these cell populations, and the balance between these, determines whether there is a tumour cell growth promotion or inhibition. In haematological malignancies, such as multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic and myeloid leukemias and follicular lymphomas, the survival, drug-resistance and proliferation of leukemic cells have been shown to be largely dependent on a supportive microenvironment, so that some cellular components of it, mainly mesenchymal stromal cells, cancer associated fibroblasts and macrophages, are now proposed as targets of new therapies.

The results showed that the over-expression of HMG-CoA reductase gene and adding 100 mg/l ketoconazole alone can result in 135.1 and 15.6% increment of \u03b2-carotene concentration compared with that of the control (2.05 mg/g dry weight of cells), respectively. However, the combination of overexpressing HMG-CoA reductase gene and adding ketoconazole can achieve a 206.8% increment of pigment content (6.29 mg/g dry weight of cells) compared with that of the control. Due to the fact that over-expression of the HMG-CoA reductase gene can simultaneously improve the flux of the sterol and carotenoid biosynthetic pathway, it can be concluded that under the circumstances of blocking sterol biosynthesis, increasing the activity of HMG-CoA reductase can result in more precursors FPP fluxing into carotenoid branch and obtain a high increment of \u03b2-carotene production.

We review recent publications regarding primary and secondary prevention of CVD with statin therapy in older adults. Risk scores and their limitations in this population are discussed. The association of adverse effects with intensive doses of statin and their interactions with other drugs may be more problematic in older adults. Statin therapy appears cost-effective for individuals with higher CVD risk but this is dependent on the assumptions used.

To investigate molecular mechanisms of lova, the present study was aimed at proteomics and bioinformatics analyses on anaplastic thyroid cancer cell line ARO differentiated with low concentration of lova. Thyroid differentiation was induced by treating ARO cells with 25 \u03bcM of lova and confirmed by checking upregulation of some thyroid differentiation markers. Gel-based proteomics analysis was then performed to identify proteins differentially expressed between undifferentiated and lova-differentiated ARO cells. Bioinformatics analysis was finally performed to estimate biological networks regulated by lova. Our results showed that lova impacted on proteins involved in protein folding, biomolecule metabolism, signal transduction, protein expression and protein degradation. Specifically, transfecting ARO cells with plasmid DNA encoding flotillin 1 (FLOT1) up-regulated the thyroid differentiation markers, indicating that FLOT1 might at least partially mediate the lova-induced thyroid differentiation. These data may shed light on the mechanism underlying lova-induced re-differentiation of thyroid cancer, and give a rationale for clinical use of lova as an auxiliary agent in cancer therapy.",

As a result, much work has investigated the potential use of lipid-lowering agents, particularly statins, as preventive or therapeutic agents for AD. Although epidemiology and preclinical statin research (described in part I of this review) have generally supported an adverse role of high cholesterol levels regarding AD, human studies of statins (reviewed herein) show highly variable outcomes, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions. We identify several confounding factors among the human studies, including differing blood-brain barrier permeabilities among statins, the stage in AD at which statins were administered, and the drugs' pleiotropic metabolic effects, all of which contribute to the substantial variability observed to date. We recommend that future human studies of this important therapeutic topic (1) take the blood-brain barrier permeabilities of statins into account when analyzing results, (2) include specific analyses of the effects on low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and, most important, (3) conduct statin treatment trials solely in patients with mild AD, who have the best chance for disease modification.", 
    "133": "Endothelial dysfunction contributes to the initiation and development of hypertension. We previously found that simvastatin moderately decreases blood pressure in 2-kidney-2-clip (2k2c) renal hypertension, but the precise mechanisms are still unclear. The present study was designed to examine the protective actions of simvastatin in 2k2c-evoked endothelial dysfunction and also delineate the underlying mechanisms. Here we show that 2k2c-induced elevation in plasma angiotensin II impaired acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation, suppressed endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activity and reduced nitric oxide (NO) production. Additionally, the levels of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), an essential cofactor of eNOS, as well as the activity of GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH I), the rate-limiting enzyme for BH4 synthesis, were markedly reduced. Administration of simvastatin significantly improved acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent carotid arteries relaxation at 9\u00a0weeks in reno-hypertensive rats. Notably, GTPCH I activity, BH4 production, p-eNOS expression and NO levels in the vascular endothelium were elevated as a result of simvastatin administration. In cultured rat arterial endothelial cells, simvastatin restored BH4, GTPCH I activity and NO release impaired by angiotensin II, and pretreatment with mevalonate (MVA) or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) abolished the beneficial effects exerted by simvastatin. Moreover, RhoA inhibitor C3 exoenzyme, Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 and dominant negative mutant of RhoA prevented BH4 and NO loss due to Ang II treatment. Taken together, normalization of BH4-eNOS-NO pathway at least in part accounts for the beneficial actions of simvastatin on vascular endothelium during 2k2c hypertension, and RhoA-Rho kinase pathway is involved in regulation of BH4 production.",

We detected 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase mRNA in organ of Corti, spiral ganglion, and stria vascularis by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Moreover, we observed a dose-dependent and significant reduction of hair cell loss in organs of Corti treated with simvastatin in addition to gentamicin, as compared to samples treated with gentamicin alone.

The marker cassette is composed of the sac7d promoter and the hmg gene coding for the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (P(sac7d)-hmg), which confers simvastatin resistance to this crenarchaeon. The basic plasmid vector pSSR was constructed by substituting the pyrEF gene of the expression vector pSeSD for P(sac7d)-hmg with which the Sulfolobus expression plasmids pSSRlacS, pSSRAherA, and pSSRNherA were constructed. Characterization of Sulfolobus transformants carrying pSSRlacS indicated that the plasmid was properly maintained under selection. High-level expression of the His(6)-tagged HerA helicase was obtained with the cells harboring pSSRAherA. The establishment of two efficient selectable markers (pyrEF and hmg) was subsequently exploited for genetic analysis. A herA merodiploid strain of S. islandicus was constructed using pyrEF marker and used as the host to obtain pSSRNherA transformant with simvastatin selection. While the gene knockout (\u0394herA) cells generated from the herA merodiploid cells failed to form colonies in the presence of 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA), the mutant cells could be rescued by expression of the gene from a plasmid (pSSRNherA), because their transformants formed colonies on a solid medium containing 5-FOA and simvastatin. This demonstrates that HerA is essential for cell viability of S. islandicus. To our knowledge, this is the first application of an antibiotic selectable marker in genetic study for a hyperthermophilic acidophile and in the crenarchaeal lineage.", 
    "147": "Blocking of the potassium current I(Kr) [human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG)] is generally associated with an increased risk of long QT syndrome (LQTS). The 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, rosuvastatin, is a methanesulfonamide derivative, which shows structural similarities with several I(Kr) blockers. Hence, we assessed the effects of rosuvastatin on cardiac repolarization by using in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models. Patch clamp experiments on hERG-transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells established the potency of rosuvastatin to block hERG [half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50) ) = 195 nM]. We showed in isolated guinea pig hearts that 195 nM rosuvastatin prolonged (basic cycle length of 250 ms; p < 0.05) the monophasic action potential duration at 90% repolarization (MAPD(90) ) by 11 \u00b1 1 ms. Finally, rosuvastatin (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) prolonged corrected QT interval (QTc) in conscious and unrestrained guinea pigs from 201 \u00b1 1 to 210 \u00b1 2 ms (p < 0.05). Thus, rosuvastatin blocks I(Kr) and prolongs cardiac repolarization. In additional experiments, we also show that hERG blockade in HEK 293 cells was modulated by coexpression of efflux [breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), multidrug resistance gene (MDR1)] and influx [organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 2B1] transporters involved in the disposition and cardiac distribution of the drug. Genetic polymorphisms observed for BCRP, MDR1, and OATP2B1, and IC(50) determined for hERG blocking lead us to propose that some patients may be at risk of rosuvastatin-induced LQTS.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of simvastatin on mitochondrial respiration, oxidative stress, and cell death in differentiated primary human skeletal muscle cells (i.e., myotubes). Simvastatin induced a dose-dependent decrease in viability of proliferating and differentiating primary human muscle precursor cells, and a similar dose-dependent effect was noted in differentiated myoblasts and myotubes. Additionally, there were decreases in myotube number and size following 48 h of simvastatin treatment (5 \u03bcM). In permeabilized myotubes, maximal ADP-stimulated oxygen consumption, supported by palmitoylcarnitine+malate (PCM, complex I and II substrates) and glutamate+malate (GM, complex I substrates), was 32-37% lower (P<0.05) in simvastatin-treated (5 \u03bcM) vs control myotubes, providing evidence of impaired respiration at complex I. Mitochondrial superoxide and hydrogen peroxide generation were significantly greater in the simvastatin-treated human skeletal myotube cultures compared to control. In addition, simvastatin markedly increased protein levels of Bax (proapoptotic, +53%) and Bcl-2 (antiapoptotic, +100%, P<0.05), mitochondrial PTP opening (+44%, P<0.05), and TUNEL-positive nuclei in human skeletal myotubes, demonstrating up-regulation of mitochondrial-mediated myonuclear apoptotic mechanisms.

Because the liver is a target organ of pitavastatin, OATP1B1 is responsible for both the pharmacological effects and clearance of pitavastatin. The effects of the SLCO1B1*15 allele on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of pitavastatin were studied. Pitavastatin 2 mg was orally administered to 38 subjects with SLCO1B1*1a/*1b (n = 20), *1b/*15 (n = 13), or *15/*15 (n = 5). After pitavastatin administration, the plasma concentrations of pitavastatin and pitavastatin lactone were assayed for up to 48 h using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In comparison to the SLCO1B1*1a/*1b subjects, only a C(max) was slightly higher in the SLCO1B1*1b/*15 subjects.

OATP-mediated uptake into the hepatocyte coupled with subsequent excretion into bile via efflux proteins, such as MRP2, is often referred to as hepatobiliary excretion. OATP transporter proteins can impact some drugs in several ways including pharmacokinetic variability, pharmacodynamic response and drug-drug interactions (DDIs). The impact of transporter mediated hepatic clearance is illustrated with case examples, from the literature and also from the Pfizer portfolio.

The contralateral breast of women with a previous history of breast cancer was used as a high-risk model. Eligible women who had completed all planned treatment of a prior stage 0-III breast cancer received simvastatin 40\u00a0mg orally daily for 24-28\u00a0weeks. At baseline and end-of-study, we measured circulating concentrations of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), estrogens, and fasting lipids; breast density on contralateral breast mammogram; and quality of life by Rand Short Form 36-Item health survey. Fifty women were enrolled with a median age of 53\u00a0years.

We did not observe a significant change in circulating estradiol or estrone concentrations, contralateral mammographic breast density, or reported physical functioning or pain scores. This study demonstrates the feasibility of short-term biomarker modulation studies using the contralateral breast of high-risk women.

We calculate the risk of jaundice caused by statin drugs, from sale in the whole country of Iceland, to be one in 17,434 users a year.

Although statin based therapy is commonplace in primary and secondary prevention, several economical, clinical and safety issues have been raised, so that there is ongoing research into new, safer and more effective agents to be used alone or in combination with existing cardiovascular drugs. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are a class of short, single-stranded synthetic analogs of nucleic acids that bind to a target mRNA, preventing its translation and thereby inhibiting protein synthesis. Apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) is the major protein moiety of the atherogenic lipoproteins LDL and Lp(a), thus representing the ideal target for antisense therapy. Two anti-apoB100 (i.e., ISIS 301012 and ISIS 147764) and one anti-apolipoprotein(a) (i.e., ASO 144367) have already been developed and tested in some animal and human trials, providing promising results in terms of significant reduction of both LDL and Lp(a). Nevertheless, some safety issues - especially injection-site reactions and potential hepatotoxicity - have also emerged, thereby slowing down the large clinical diffusion of these agents. The present article provides an update on clinical data regarding antisense therapy targeting human apolipoproteins, highlighting the benefits and the potential risks of this innovative therapeutic approach for hypercholesterolemia and hyperlipoproteinemia(a).",

We tested the possible involvement of p110\u03b2 in a recently described rapid depletion of phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) in the nucleus. Previous work showed that this down-regulation is induced by extracellular ATP or by statins and is mediated by the purinergic receptor P2X7. Here, we used p110\u03b2 knock out mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and siRNA-treated cancer cells. We found that p110\u03b2 is essential for ATP- or statin-induced nuclear pAkt depletion in MEFs and in several cancer cell lines including prostate cancer cells. ATP, statin or the selective P2X7 agonist BzATP also inhibited cell growth, and this inhibition was not seen in p110\u03b2 knock out cells. We also found that p110\u03b2 was necessary for statin-induced changes in binding between FKBP51, pAkt and PTEN. Our data show that p110\u03b2 is essential for the ATP- and statin-induced effects and support a role of nuclear pAkt in cancer development. They also provide support for a chemopreventive effect of statins mediated by depletion of nuclear pAkt.", 
    "200": "Hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of death worldwide. Since the late 1980s, statins have emerged as effective lipid-lowering therapies and are now widely used to protect against and slow the progression of CVD and cerebrovascular disease. However, there is a significant gap between disease improvement in clinical trials and daily practice possibly attributable to poor adherence with statin therapy. High discontinuation rates were reported in primary and secondary prevention. This systematic review aims to summarize the current literature regarding the association between statin therapy discontinuation and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and all-cause mortality in high-risk patients. Available English literature was reviewed using Medline, Embase, Web of Sciences and the Cochrane Library; 39 studies were identified. In primary and secondary prevention, as well as perioperatively, non-adherence or discontinuation of statin therapy was associated with detrimental effects on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular outcomes, including disease severity and mortality. Importantly, some studies reported that very low adherence and discontinuation was associated with worse outcomes than never using statins. In conclusion, non-adherence and discontinuation of statin therapy significantly increased the incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events as well as all-cause mortality in high-risk patients. Patients would therefore benefit from closer adherence assessment and education programs aimed at increasing awareness of the risk associated with discontinuation of statin therapy.", 
    "201": "Cholelithiasis is a common disease worldwide. The majority of gallstones can occur when the bile is supersaturated with cholesterol. Dyslipidaemia, obesity, insulin resistance are associated with an increased risk for cholesterol gallstone formation as well as with vascular risk. Statins and ezetimibe are used to treat dyslipidaemia and appear to have some effect on bile composition and cholesterol gallstone formation. Statin (e.g. pravastatin, simvastatin, fluvastatin and lovastatin) monotherapy or combined with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) have shown reductions in bile cholesterol saturation, preventing gallstone formation and even dissolving pre-existing stones. However, this effect was not consistently reported in all studies. Statin use has also been associated with a reduced risk for cholecystectomy in 2 large epidemiological studies. Ezetimibe was shown to have a beneficial action against cholelithiasis in animal studies but data in humans - although promising - are very limited. The effect of these drugs on gallstone disease warrants further investigation in large human trials.

The lack of an animal model in which these side effects would consistently be observed is one of the important drawbacks in studying statin associated myopathy. To overcome this and enable the studying of the effects of fluvastatin on skeletal muscles an animal model with high blood cholesterol levels was developed. In these animals cholesterol levels rose more than seven fold (from 1.5 \u00b1 0.1 to 10.7 \u00b1 2.0 mmol/l; n = 15 and 16) with a dramatic increase in low density lipoprotein/high density lipoprotein ratio (from 0.29 \u00b1 0.02 to 1.56 \u00b1 0.17). While the latter was reversed by statin treatment, an elevation in blood creatine kinase (CK) level indicated the presence of muscle wasting. Fibers from m. extensor digitorum longus (EDL) showed significant reduction in cross sectional area in the statin treated groups. Statin treatment also decreased the proliferation and fusion of skeletal myotubes in culture. In line with this, resting intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) was reduced in statin treated satellite cells and myotubes. On the other hand, in adult skeletal muscle fibers statin treatment increased resting [Ca(2+)](i) (116 \u00b1 4 nM vs. 151 \u00b1 5 nM; n = 33 and 34) and decreased both twitch and tetanic force both in EDL and m. soleus. In addition, in m. soleus the duration of twitch and tetanic force was shortened. These results clearly indicate that statin administration in these animals results in a myopathy characterized by decreased muscle force and elevated plasma CK level.",

    "222": "For the brand-name drug atorvastatin calcium, the PDP reimbursement was positively related to a pharmacy's request for a contract change (\u03b2 = 0.887, P < 0.05), whereas other bargaining activities were not significantly related to PDP reimbursement. However, for the generic drug lisinopril, no bargaining activities were found to be significantly related to the PDP reimbursement.", 
    "223": "Pharmacy request for a contract change was associated with higher reimbursement rates for the brand-name drug atorvastatin calcium in PDP contracts, after controlling for pharmacy quality attributes, local market structures, and area socioeconomic status; this finding likely applies to other brand-name drugs because of the structure of the contracts. Our results suggest that independent pharmacies are more likely to acquire higher reimbursement rates by engaging in active bargaining with third-party payers.", 
    "224": "Transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients are at high risk of short-term stroke, myocardial infarction and vascular death. Stroke risk is reduced by immediate treatment initialization. Stroke unit treatment is recommended for TIA patients. We established an outpatient TIA clinic to address the question whether outpatient evaluation of suspected TIA is safe.", 
    "225": "TIA workup included cerebral imaging, duplex sonography, transcranial Doppler screening for patent foramen ovale, electrocardiography, blood tests, ABCD(2) score and ankle-brachial index within one day. TIA patients received secondary prophylaxis immediately. TIA patients fulfilling predefined criteria for high early stroke risk (ABCD(2) score \u22654 points and TIA within 72 h, symptomatic stenosis, newly detected atrial fibrillation, recurrent TIA) were referred to the stroke unit. The remaining patients were discharged home. 90-day telephone follow-up was obtained.", 
    "226": "123 consecutive patients with suspected TIA (53 male, age 59 \u00b1 17.2 years) were prospectively evaluated. TIA or minor stroke was diagnosed in 69 (56%), and TIA mimics in 54 (44%) patients. Median time from symptom onset to presentation was 48 h (1 h to 3 months). Patients with TIA/minor stroke presented significantly more frequently with ABCD(2) score \u22654 points (p = 0.021). Twelve patients (9.8%) were admitted to the stroke unit. There were 2 strokes during follow-up. The stroke rate was 1.6% within all patients, and 2.9% within the subgroup of patients with TIA/minor stroke, compared to 5.7% predicted by the ABCD(2) score. Other vascular end points were not found.", 
    "227": "Based on risk stratification, outpatient evaluation of TIA is safe. TIA mimics are frequent.", 
    "228": "Aortic valve calcification is an actively regulated process with endothelial dysfunction displaying hallmarks of atherosclerosis. C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) system has been reported to have a role in the pathogenesis of vascular atherosclerosis and to be distinctly downregulated in aortic valve stenosis (AS). Here we studied gene expressions of CNP and is target receptor natriuretic peptide receptor type B (NPR-B) in human aortic valves. Furthermore, we compared gene expression of CNP system in patients with HMG-coenzyme-A reductase (statin) treatment to non-statin-treated patients in AS group.", 
    "229": "With the study population of 108 patients, we characterized expression of CNP and NPR-B in human aortic valves and compared normal control valves (n = 12) with valves obtained from patients with aortic regurgitation (AR, n = 16), AR with fibrosis (AR+fibr., n = 19) and AS (n = 61). By reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), CNP mRNA levels were 89% lower (p = 0.022) in stenotic valves, when compared to AR group. Moreover, the mRNA levels of NPR-B, the target receptor of CNP, were 62% lower (p < 0.001) in stenotic valves when compared to control group and 54% lower (p = 0.002) in stenotic valves, when compared to AR group. There was no statistical significant difference in CNP and NPR-B levels in AS group when the statin-treated patients were compared to untreated patients.", 
    "230": "These results show for the first time that the gene expression of anti-atherogenic CNP system did not differ between statin-treated and non-statin-treated patients in AS. The research data supports the results of clinical trials with the same drug class.", 
    "231": "Although statin therapy is known to increase concentrations of PCSK9, whether this effect is related to the magnitude of LDL reduction is uncertain. This study was undertaken to understand the extent of this effect and examine the relationship between PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction.", 
    "232": "We measured plasma PCSK9 concentrations by ELISA at baseline and at 1 year in 500 men and 500 women participating in the Justification for Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial that randomly allocated participants to rosuvastatin 20 mg daily or placebo. We also evaluated rs11591147, a single nucleotide polymorphism known to have an impact on plasma PCSK9 concentrations.", 
    "233": "At baseline, median (interquartile range) PCSK9 concentrations were higher in women [73 (62-90)] ng/mL than in men [69 (57-81) ng/mL] (P<0.005). During 1 year, there was no change in PCSK9 concentrations in the placebo arm, suggesting stability in time. In contrast, the rosuvastatin increased PCSK9 by 35% in women [101 (82-117) ng/mL] and 28% in men [89 (71-109) ng/mL] (P<0.0001). Among those allocated to rosuvastatin, greater reductions in LDL-C were associated with greater increases in PCSK9 on both absolute and relative scales (r=-0.15, P<0.0005). Furthermore PCSK9 (rs11591147) did not alter the magnitude of LDL-C reduction associated with rosuvastatin use.", 
    "234": "In this randomized trial, rosuvastatin increased plasma concentration of PCSK9 in proportion to the magnitude of LDL-C reduction; the LDL-C response to statin could not be inferred by PCSK9 concentrations.", 
    "235": "Clinical trials have shown that statin therapy reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), even among patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels <100 mg/dL. We sought to determine the extent to which patients with obstructive CAD in routine outpatient care are treated with statins, nonstatins, or no lipid-lowering therapy.", 
    "236": "Within the American College of Cardiology's Practice Innovation and Clinical Excellence (PINNACLE) outpatient registry, we examined rates of treatment with statin and nonstatin medications in 38 775 outpatients with obstructive CAD (history of myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization) and without documented contraindications to statin therapy. Among these patients, 30 160 (77.8%) were prescribed statins, 2042 (5.3%) were treated only with nonstatin lipid-lowering medications, and 6573 (17.0%) were untreated. Lack of medical insurance was associated with no statin treatment, and male sex, coexisting hypertension, and a recent coronary revascularization were associated with statin treatment. Among those not on any lipid-lowering therapy, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were available for 51.2% (3365/6573). Among these untreated patients, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were <100 mg/dL in 1794 patients (53.3%) and \u2265 100 mg/dL in 1571 patients (46.7%).", 
    "237": "Despite robust clinical trial evidence, a substantial number of patients with obstructive CAD remain untreated with statins. A small proportion were treated with nonstatin therapy, and 1 in 6 patients was simply untreated; half of the untreated patients had low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values <100 mg/dL. These findings illustrate important opportunities to improve lipid management in outpatients with obstructive CAD.", 
    "238": "Inflammation is associated with atherosclerosis. Cholestin (Monascus purpureus-fermented rice) contains a naturally occurring statin, which has lipid-modulating, anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects. This study aimed to investigate the effects of Cholestin extract on the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1-treated human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs).", 
    "239": "Zymography, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot analyses were used for analysis of MMP expression of TNF-\u03b1-stimulated HASMCs. Gel shift assay was used for analysis of transcription factor nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was also analysed.", 
    "240": "The supplement of HASMCs with Cholestin extract significantly suppresses enzymatic activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in TNF-\u03b1-stimulated HASMCs. RT-PCR and immunoblot analyses show that Cholestin extract significantly attenuates TNF-\u03b1-induced mRNA and protein expressions of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Gel shift assays show that Cholestin treatment reduces TNF-\u03b1-activated NF-\u03baB. Furthermore, Cholestin also attenuates intracellular ROS generation in TNF-\u03b1-treated HASMCs. The supplement with an ROS scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine (glutathione precursor) gives similar results to Cholestin.", 
    "241": "Cholestin reduces TNF-\u03b1-stimulated MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression as well as downregulating NF-\u03baB activation and intracellular ROS formation in HASMCs, supporting the notion that the natural compound Cholestin may have potential application in clinical atherosclerosis disease.", 
    "242": "On the basis of large randomized clinical trials, pharmacological antagonists of HMG-CoA reductase (statins) have become increasingly used in clinical practice for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Rosuvastatin was developed as a potent statin, which appeared to raise levels of HDL-cholesterol, in addition to marked reductions in levels of LDL-cholesterol. These effects on lipids are associated with a beneficial impact of rosuvastatin on progression of various stages of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular outcomes in clinical trials. The clinical experience of rosuvastatin will be reviewed in this article."
