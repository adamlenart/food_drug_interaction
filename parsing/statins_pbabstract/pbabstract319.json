    "0": "Statins and fibrates constitute the two major families of lipid-lowering agents. Statins are widely used for the treatment of pure hypercholesterolaemia while fibrates are used for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. Both drugs are also used for the treatment of mixed dyslipidemia. Some fibrates efficiently lower serum LDL-cholesterol. Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase and decrease cellular cholesterol synthesis. The resulting lower intracellular cholesterol concentration induces the activation of SREBP thus inducing the over expression and transcription of the LDL receptor gene. This over expression of the LDL receptor in the liver increases the clearance of circulating LDL thus decreasing the LDL-cholesterol plasma levels. The effects of fibrates on lipid metabolism are entirely due to their capacity to activate PPAR-alpha and to induce the over expression of genes containing a PPRE in their promoter. Fibrates decrease triglyceride concentrations by increasing the beta-oxidation of fatty acids in the liver and by decreasing triglyceride-VLDL synthesis. Fibrates also decrease triglycerides by increasing the hydolysys of triglycerides in chylomicron and VLDL through their capacity to increase and to decrease the lipoprotein lipase and the apo C-III transcription, respectively. Fibrates could decrease triglycerides partly by inducing apo A-V over-expression. These molecules increase HDL-cholesterol by increasing apo A-I and apo A-II transcription. Therefore the mechanisms of action of statins and fibrates depend on their capacity to modulate the expression of genes controlling lipoprotein metabolism.", 
    "1": "Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors, acutely increase endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity and chronically increase eNOS expression in endothelial cells. NO decreases transport in thick ascending limbs (TAL). We hypothesized that statins inhibit TAL transport by acutely activating eNOS, thereby increasing NO production and chronically enhancing eNOS expression. Oxygen consumption (QO(2)) by TAL suspensions from Sprague-Dawley rats was used as a measure of active NaCl reabsorption. Na/K ATPase activity was assessed by measuring ATP hydrolysis in the presence and absence of ouabain. eNOS expression was measured by Western blot. A total of 50 micro M pravastatin decreased QO(2) by 18.6 +/- 3.4% (P < 0.01). In the presence of 500 micro M furosemide and 200 micro M amiloride, transport blockers, QO(2) remained the same after pravastatin was added. Na/K ATPase activity was not different from controls and TAL treated with 50 micro M pravastatin (0.33 +/- 0.07 versus 0.29 +/- 0.04 nmol P(i)/ micro g protein/min, where P(i) is inorganic phosphate). Nystatin stimulated QO(2) to 178 +/- 13.7 in pravastatin-treated TAL and 195 +/- 11.5 in furosemide-treated TAL. The inhibitory effect of pravastatin on QO(2) was blocked by L-nitroarginine methyl ester, an NOS inhibitor. In addition, pravastatin increased NO production as measured by the fluorescent dye DAF-2A. Pravastatin at a dose of 10 mg/kg per d had no effect on eNOS protein at 1 d (24.1 +/- 2.7 versus 25.5 +/- 1.1 arbitrary units [AU]) or 7 d (24.1 +/- 2.7 versus 20.9 +/- 1.3 AU). Similarly, at 1 d, 50 mg/kg per d had no effect on expression (24.1 +/- 2.7 versus 21.2 +/- 3.6 AU). At 7 d, this dose decreased eNOS protein from 24.1 +/- 2.7 to 11.8 +/- 4.4 AU. It is concluded that pravastatin acutely decreases NaCl entry into the TAL by releasing NO. Pravastatin does not chronically increase eNOS expression in TAL.",

Methods and Results The association between treatment with statins and the regression of cardiac mass (left ventricular mass index, LVMI) was investigated in a case - control study using transthoracic echocardiography in 304 patients with angina who underwent coronary angiography. Those who received pravastatin or simvastatin were defined as cases (n=66), and age, sex and body mass index-matched controls (n=127) were selected. The cases showed a significant decrease in LVMI compared with the controls. Although the cases included a significantly higher percentage of patients with hypertension and calcium antagonist (CaA) treatment than the controls, there were no relationships between LVMI and either hypertension or CaA treatment. Because the cases had a significantly higher number of stenosed vessels than the controls, LVMI for each number of stenosed vessels was analyzed, and a significant interaction effect between the association of LVMI with statin and the number of stenosed vessels was found. Conclusions Treatment with statins was associated with a lower cardiac mass in patients with angina, suggesting that this is one of the drugs' pleiotropic effects.",

We investigated the role of lymphocyte function antigen-1 (LFA-1) in endotoxin-induced leukocyte-endothelium interactions, microvascular perfusion failure, hepatocellular injury and apoptosis in the liver by use of gene-targeted mice, blocking antibodies and a synthetic inhibitor of LFA-1 (LFA703). For this purpose, mice were challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)+D-galactosamine (Gal), and intravital microscopy of the liver microcirculation was conducted 6 h later. 2. The number of firmly adherent leukocytes in response to LPS/Gal was reduced by 48% in LFA-1-deficient mice. Moreover, endotoxin-induced increases of apoptosis and enzyme markers of hepatocellular injury were decreased by 64 and 69-90%, respectively, in LFA-1-deficient mice. Furthermore, sinusoidal perfusion was improved in endotoxemic mice lacking LFA-1. 3. A similar protective pattern was observed in endotoxemic mice pretreated with an antibody against LFA-1. Thus, immunoneutralization of LFA-1 reduced endotoxin-induced leukocyte adhesion by 55%, liver enzymes by 64-66% and apoptosis by 42%, in addition to the preservation of microvascular perfusion. 4. Administration of a novel statin-derived inhibitor of LFA-1, LFA703, significantly decreased leukocyte adhesion (more than 56%) and the subsequent liver injury in endotoxemic mice. 5. Thus, this study demonstrates a pivotal role of LFA-1 in supporting leukocyte adhesion in the liver. Moreover, interference with LFA-1-mediated leukocyte adhesion protects against endotoxemic liver damage, and may constitute a potential therapeutic strategy in sepsis.",

Pharmacy records from 1990 to 1999 were obtained from a Washington State health maintenance organization (66% of subjects) and retail pharmacies (34% of subjects) on a sample of subjects (212 cases, 191 controls) and used as the \"gold standard.\" Recall accuracy was assessed for 6-month, 2-year, and 8-year time windows. Sensitivity of antihypertensive use was 92% (95% confidence interval (CI): 85, 96) for cases and controls in the 6-month period and slightly lower for the 2-year (90% (95% CI: 82, 94) and 87% (95% CI: 78, 92)) and 8-year (80% (95% CI: 69, 88) and 79% (95% CI: 68, 88)) periods. For statins, sensitivity was 83% (95% CI: 64, 93) for cases and 93% (95% CI: 69, 99) for controls in the 6-month period, 75% (95% CI: 55, 88) and 86% (95% CI: 60, 96) in the 2-year period, and 67% (95% CI: 42, 85) and 75% (95% CI: 41, 93) in the 8-year period. For self-report of antidepressants, sensitivities ranged from 66% (95% CI: 47, 80) in the 6-month period to 44% (95% CI: 30, 60) in the 8-year period. Specificity was high among all drug classes, ranging from 91% to 100%. Recall did not differ by case-control status. Trivial changes in estimates were observed when health maintenance organization records alone were used as the gold standard. Self-reported use of antihypertensives and statins appears to be relatively accurate among older women.", 
    "64": "Statins have been shown to interact with several monocyte/macrophage functions. We tested the effect of pravastatin on transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) production and its possible involvement in scavenger receptors class A (SRA) expression in human THP-1 cells. TGF-beta1s biological activity in THP-1 cell conditioned medium, evaluated by luciferase activity of transfected cell with a TGF-beta responsive promoter, was increased in a dose-dependent manner after incubation with pravastatin (1-20 microM). Pravastatin (1-20 microM) induced a dose-dependent increase in TGF-beta1 mRNA expression and protein production in THP-1 cells. PMA-induced SRA gene and protein expression was suppressed by pravastatin with a mean 3-fold decrease at 10 microM. This last effect was reversed by a mouse monoclonal anti-TGF-beta1 neutralizing antibody. PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MAP kinase cascade, completely reversed pravastatin-induced SRA down-regulation. p44 and p42 isoforms showed a dose-dependent phosphorylation after treatment with pravastatin (1-20 microM) which was inhibited by a mouse monoclonal anti-TGF-beta1 antibody. Our results demonstrate that pravastatin significantly up-regulates TGF-beta1 expression which may be in involved in down-regulation of SRA expression in THP-1 cell cultures. A new pathway for pravastatin effects in atherogenesis can be suggested.",

A total of 179 patients were enrolled: 100 male and 79 female; 153 were Caucasian, eight Black and 18 other races; the mean age was 56 years. Patients were generally in good health as evidenced by medical history, physical and laboratory examination. Patients were required to not exceed specific low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels depending on their risk category. The trial was conducted as a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, positive-controlled, double-dummy, two-way crossover study. Patients were washed-out of any prior lipid-lowering medications (period 1) and then received one ER or one IR lovastatin tablet for 12 weeks (period 2) and then washed out with placebo for 6 weeks (period 3). They then received the alternate treatment for an additional 12 weeks (period 4).",

Secondary variables included the mean percent change from baseline in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides (TG) for periods 2 and 4 combined. Least-square mean differences between ER and IR treated groups were estimated at both treatments. All tests were two-sided and a p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",

Differences in HDL-C (4.1% and 4.3% for ER and IR, respectively) and TG (7.4% and 10.4% for ER and IR, respectively) were not significant between treatments. TC (19.1% and 17.2% for ER and IR, respectively) and LDL-C (26.4% and 23.1% for ER and IR, respectively) were also reduced significantly from baseline by both treatments. However the ER lovastatin reduced TC by an additional 1.9% (p = 0.0355) and LDL-C by a further 3.3% decrease (p = 0.0028) as compared to the IR formulation. The increase in LDL-C efficacy is equivalent to an increase of 50% in the dose of IR lovastatin, suggesting that 20 mg ER is equivalent to about 30 mg IR in LDL-C-lowering capacity. No apparent difference in the safety profile between the two formulations was noted.",

Therapy with these drugs requires monitoring of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels because animal studies and premarketing clinical trials showed signs of hepatotoxicity that were primarily minor elevations of ALT. Nevertheless, postmarketing experience suggests that hepatotoxicity is rare, and that elevated ALT levels are reversible with continued therapy and probably are related to cholesterol lowering. Based on the low occurrence of ALT elevations and the lack of clinical evidence of hepatotoxicity, some clinicians are calling for a change in the current practice of monitoring liver function tests. We report, however, the case of a 71-year-old woman who was receiving atorvastatin and experienced elevated transaminase levels on two occasions, and developed pruritus on rechallenge with the drug. Thus, clinicians should be aware of asymptomatic elevations in liver function tests in patients receiving atorvastatin who do not have known risk factors for liver damage.",

Levels of total and LDL cholesterol, the steroid hormones estradiol, testosterone, cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) as well as FSH and LH were studied. Pravastatin led to a significant reduction of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. There was no significant change in estradiol, testosterone, cortisol or DHEAS plasma concentrations. There was no compensatory change in FSH or LH. It is concluded that pravastatin does not alter steroid hormones or gonadotropins in a clinically applicable dose, which significantly reduces total and LDL cholesterol.",

Nonetheless, data from epidemiological, longitudinal studies in humans as well as studies on transgenic mouse models and cultured neuronal cell lines indicate that cholesterol may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. Statins have proven therapeutic and preventive effects in IHD and other vascular diseases in man. They generally are well tolerated, but some adverse effects, probably due to antiproliferative and proapoptotic properties of the statins, are matters of concern. AD patients may be extrasusceptible to adverse effects of statins due to preexisting aberrations in signal transduction and energy metabolism in the neurons and a perturbed cholesterol metabolism in the brain. This problem might be addressed in randomized, double-blind studies with statins in AD. The statins differ from each other in several aspects, and they are not considered to be therapeutically interchangeable. It could be fruitful to use both a placebo and two different types of statins, i.e. an essentially hydrophilic statin and a lipophilic statin, in a double-blinded fashion, and to compare the effects on the cognitive decline in AD.",

A Packard MultiProbe II workstation was used to convert human plasma samples collected following administration of simvastatin and quality control (QC) samples from individual tubes into 96-well plate format. The workstation was also used to prepare calibration standards and spike internal standards. A Tomtec Quadra 96-channel liquid handling workstation was used to perform LLE based on 96-well plates including adding solvents, separating organic from aqueous layer and reconstitution. SV and SVA were separated through a Kromasil C18 column (50 mm x 2 mm i.d., 5 microm) and detected by tandem mass spectrometry with a TurboIonspray interface. Stable isotope-labeled SV and SVA, 13CD(3)-SV and 13 CD(3)-SVA, were used as the internal standards for SV and SVA, respectively. The automated procedures reduced the overall analytical time (96 samples) to 1/3 of that of manual LLE. Most importantly, an analyst spent only a fraction of time on the 96-well LLE. A limit of quantitation of 50 pg/ml was achieved for both SV and SVA. The interconversion between SV and SVA during the 96-well LLE was found to be negligible. The assay showed very good reproducibility, with intra- and inter-assay precision (%R.S.D.) of less than 7.5%, and accuracy of 98.7-102.3% of nominal values for both analytes. By using this method, sample throughput should be enhanced at least three-fold compared to that of the manual procedure.", 
    "83": "The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the lipid lowering and antioxidant capacity of naringin in LDL receptor knockout (LDLR-KO) mice fed a cholesterol (0.1 g/100 g) diet. As such, naringin or lovastatin (0.02 g/100 g) was supplemented in a cholesterol diet for 6 weeks. The naringin and lovastatin supplementation significantly lowered the plasma total cholesterol level compared to the control group. The plasma and hepatic triglyceride level was only lowered by the lovastatin supplement, while the hepatic cholesterol content was lowered by both the naringin and lovastatin supplements compared to the control group. The hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity was significantly lower in the naringin and lovastatin supplemented groups than in the control group, whereas the ACAT activity was unaffected. The excretion of total sterol was significantly higher in the naringin and lovastatin groups compared to the control group due to significant changes in the acidic and neutral sterol, respectively. When comparing the hepatic antioxidant enzyme activities, the superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione reductase activities were all significantly higher in the naringin-supplemented group than in the control group, while only the lovastatin supplement increased the glutathione reductase activity. Accordingly, the current results confirmed that naringin lowers the plasma cholesterol level via the inhibition of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity and increases the excretion of fecal sterol. Naringin was also found to improve the activities of hepatic antioxidant enzymes against oxidative stress in a hypercholesterolemic animal model, i.e. cholesterol-fed LDLR-KO mice.", 
    "84": "Diabetic nephropathy is related to glomerular extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation that leads to glomerulosclerosis. Fluvastatin as a lipid-lowering medicine significantly prevents diabetic nephropathy, probably not only through its lipid-lowering action, but also mainly through its direct suppression of glomerular ECM accumulation. To test this hypothesis, in the present study, a five-sixths nephrectomized (5/6Nx) rat model to induce a renal ECM accumulation without coexistence of hyperlipidemia was used to investigate the effect of fluvastatin on renal function, glomerular ECM accumulation and expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). 5/6Nx induced a significant nephropathy in rats at 13 weeks, indicated by renal dysfunction including increases in blood urine nitrogen, creatinine and urinary protein excretion, and renal histopathological changes. Administration of fluvastatin significantly prevented the renal dysfunction and histological abnormalities in the 5/6Nx rats. Furthermore, both significant suppression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) activity such as MMP-2 and significant activation of tissue inhibitors of MMP (TIMPs) such as TIMP-2 observed in the 5/6Nx rats were almost completely prevented by fluvastatin, resulting in a significant prevention of glomerular ECM accumulation. For upstream mediator of ECM accumulation, 5/6Nx significantly up-regulated CTGF mRNA expression, but fluvastatin treatment prevented CTGF up-regulation. These results suggest that fluvastatin, as one of well-known lipid-lowering agents, plays an important role in the prevention of nephropathy, likely through suppression of CTGF-mediated ECM accumulation. Therefore, fluvastatin may be a potential candidate for developing a pharmaceutical approach to the prevention of diabetic nephropathy due to its both lipid-lowering and direct anti-renal ECM accumulation actions.",

    "89": "Complement activation plays a relevant role in the development of tissue damage under inflammatory conditions, and clinical and experimental observations emphasize its contribution to inflammatory vasculitides. Statins have recently been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity independently of plasma cholesterol lowering and in vitro studies support a direct anti-inflammatory action of these drugs. The aim of this study was to verify the in vivo effect of fluvastatin on complement-mediated acute peritoneal inflammation. The effect of oral treatment with fluvastatin was investigated in normo-cholesterolaemic rats that received intraperitoneal injection of either yeast-activated rat serum (Y-act RS) or lipopolysaccharide to induce peritoneal inflammation monitored by the number of PMN recruited in peritoneal fluid washes. In addition, vascular adherence and extravasation of leucocytes were evaluated by direct videomicroscopy examination on mesentery postcapillary venules topically exposed to Y-act RS. The number of PMN in the peritoneal washes of rats treated with fluvastatin was 38% lower than that of untreated animals (P < 0.05) 12 h after LPS injection, and was even lower (56%) in rats treated with Y-act RS already 8 h after injection (P < 0.02). Firm adhesion to endothelium and extravasation of leucocytes evaluated under direct videomicroscopy observation were significantly inhibited in fluvastatin treated rats (77% and 72%, respectively; P < 0.01), 120 min after treatment with Y-act RS. Our results demonstrate that fluvastatin inhibits in vivo complement-dependent acute peritoneal inflammation and suggest a role for statins in preventing the inflammatory flares usually associated with complement activation in chronic diseases, such as SLE or rheumatoid arthritis.",

One of major pleiotropic actions of statins, which have been proposed, is anti-inflammatory effect. Statins have been shown to reduce infiltration of inflammatory cells into atherosclerotic lesions. It has been also reported that statins increase production of nitric oxide, reduce expression of proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules, and lower plasma C-reactive protein levels. Although these effects may partially account for anti-inflammatory property of statins, its mechanisms are not fully understood. Therefore, further studies are expected to elucidate process of anti-inflammatory effect of statins.",

Atherosclerosis and hypertension can also damage the kidney parenchyma causing renal failure. Medical treatment focuses on the latter. Lipid-lowering drugs (statins) could reduce renal failure progression and could reduce the overall high cardiovascular risk.

    "95": "Data collected included the reading of 2,693,656 drug prescriptions, 1,937,083 (71.9%) of which contained patient information. Forty-four patients received combined therapy with cerivastatin and gemfibrozil over the three periods, yielding 55 exposures: 27 during the baseline period, and 28 between periods II and III, when the alert bulletins had already been released. Moreover, 41.6% of doctors included in the follow-up repeated the hazardous prescription during those two periods.", 
    "96": "The effect of the informative notes about the risk of prescribing cerivastatin and gemfibrozil concomitantly on doctors' prescribing habits was limited.

    "97": "Serum cholesterol changes after an 8-week behavior modification program for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) were studied in a randomized controlled clinical trial. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) patients were randomly assigned to the intervention (N = 94) or to usual care (N = 90). After 9 months' follow-up the intervention was effective in reducing total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels, particularly in patients with high baseline lipid levels. After correcting for changes in dose of statins during follow-up, effects were weakened, but for patients with high baseline cholesterol levels favorable effects remained. In these patients, the intervention group showed a decline of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels of 20% and 29%, respectively, compared to a 12% and 19% reduction in the control group (p <.01). These effects could not be explained by changes in dietary fat consumption. An unexpected finding was a lower increase in HDL cholesterol in the intervention group than in the control group.", 
    "98": "MHC class I and class II molecules play essential roles in the adaptive immune response by virtue of their ability to present peptides to T lymphocytes. Given their central role in adaptive immunity, the genes encoding these peptide-presenting molecules are regulated in a tight fashion to meet with local requirements for an adequate immune response. In contrast to MHC class I gene products, which are expressed on almost all nucleated cells, constitutive expression of MHC class II molecules is found only in specialized antigen-presenting cells of the immune system. Expression of both classes of MHC molecules can be induced by immune regulators and upon cell activation. A set of conserved cis-acting regulatory promoter elements mediate the transcription of MHC class I and beta2-microglobulin genes. Of these regulatory elements, the promoters of MHC class II and accessory genes also have the SXY module. The MHC class II transactivator (CIITA) is essential for the activation of MHC class II promoters, and it functions through protein-protein interactions with regulatory factors bound to the SXY module. Given the central role of CIITA in these regulatory processes, it is of interest to identify the DNA-binding factors and co-activators that assemble on CIITA promoters in a cell-type-specific fashion. Accordingly, recent studies include investigations into chromatin remodeling and epigenetic control mechanisms that modulate cell-type-specific transcriptional regulation of genes involved in antigen presentation.", 
    "99": "Resistin is an adipocytokine which plays a role in the development of insulin resistance. In this study, we investigated the direct effect of resistin on vascular endothelial cells. Resistin induced the expression of adhesion molecules such as VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, and long pentraxin 3, a marker of inflammation. The induction of VCAM-1 by resistin was inhibited partially by pitavastatin. Moreover, the induction of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 by resistin was inhibited by adiponectin, an adipocytokine that improves insulin resistance. Taken together, these results suggest that the balance in the concentrations of adipocytokines such as resistin and adiponectin determines the inflammation status of vasculature, and in turn the progress of atherosclerosis.", 
    "100": "A multitude of studies in experimental animals, together with clinical data, provide evidence that increased production of ROS (reactive oxygen species) are involved in the development and progression of cardiovascular disease. As ROS appear to have a critical role in atherosclerosis, there has been considerable interest in identifying the enzyme systems involved and in developing strategies to reduce oxidative stress. Prospective clinical trials with vitamins and hormone replacement therapy have not fulfilled earlier promises, although there is still interest in other dietary supplements. Superoxide dismutase mimetics, thiols, xanthine oxidase and NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitors are currently receiving much interest, while animal studies using gene therapy show promise, but are still at an early stage. Of the drugs in common clinical use, there is evidence that ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors and AT1 (angiotensin II type 1) receptor blockers have beneficial effects on oxidative stress above their antihypertensive properties, whereas statins, in addition to improving lipid profiles, may also lower oxidative stress.", 
    "101": "Activation of the small GTPase, Rac, requires post-translational modification by isoprenylation. Statins interfere with this process by blocking the synthesis of isoprenoid intermediates. The protein kinase Akt is a multifunctional regulator of cell behavior that has been linked to Rac activation. We have shown that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation leads to Rac activation in THP-1 cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that LPS stimulation would also activate Akt, a downstream effector of Rac, and that this may be blocked by statin pretreatment.",

Activated Akt was detected by immunoblotting with a phospho-Akt antibody and was quantified by image densitometry.", 
    "103": "LPS stimulation of THP-1 cells results in membrane ruffling and cell polarization. Furthermore, LPS increased Akt activation in THP-1 cells when compared with the nonstimulated controls. Akt phosphorylation peaked after 15 min of LPS stimulation and was suppressed by pretreatment with simvastatin.",

This suggests one possible mechanism through which simvastatin could modulate LPS-induced signaling events in monocytes to improve the host response to Gram-negative infections.", 
    "105": "Statins are lipid-lowering drugs that have been shown to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, there is growing evidence from epidemiological studies that long-term treatment with statins has unwanted effects on extrahepatic tissue and increases the risk for neuropathy. To investigate underlying molecular mechanisms we analyzed whether statins influence the activity of caspase-3 in immortalized neurons. Lovastatin and mevastatin are not able to activate caspase-3 but they strongly potentiate its activity when apoptotic signal transduction is initiated by staurosporine. The increase in caspase-3 activity after coincubation with statins and staurosporine was paralleled by an increase in the protein level of the pro-apoptotic GTPase RhoB. Our data provide evidence that statins enhance neuronal apoptosis and therefore give reasons for a careful evaluation when patients with neurological diseases are treated with these drugs.", 
    "106": "The purpose of this study was to elucidate the role of human organic anion transporters (human OATs) in the induction of drug-induced skeletal muscle abnormalities. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors have been clinically used for lowering plasma cholesterol levels, and are known to induce various forms of skeletal muscle abnormalities including myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that human OAT1 and human OAT3 are localized in the cytoplasmic membrane of the human skeletal muscles. The activities of human OATs were measured using mouse cell lines from renal proximal tubules stably expressing human OATs. Human OAT3, but not human OAT1, mediates the transport of pravastatin. Fluvastatin inhibited organic anion uptake mediated by human OAT1 in a mixture of competitive and noncompetitive manner, whereas simvastatin and fluvastatin noncompetitively inhibited the organic anion uptake mediated by human OAT3. In conclusion, the organic anion transporters OAT1 and OAT3 are localized in the cytoplasmic membrane of human skeletal muscles. Pravastatin, simvasatin, and fluvasatin inhibit human OATs activity. These results suggest that muscle organic anion transporters play a role in the muscular side effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.", 
    "107": "As a class, hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors can potentially cause skeletal myopathy. One statin, cerivastatin, has recently been withdrawn from the market due to an unacceptably high incidence of rhabdomyolysis. The mechanism underlying statin-induced myopathy is unknown. This paper sought to investigate the relationship among statin-induced myopathy, mitochondrial function, and muscle ubiquinone levels. Rats were administered cerivastatin at 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 (mg/kg)/day or dose vehicle (controls) by oral gavage for 15 days. Samples of type I-predominant skeletal muscle (soleus) and type II-predominant skeletal muscle [quadriceps and extensor digitorum longus (EDL)], and blood were collected on study days 5, 10, and 15 for morphological evaluation, clinical chemistry, mitochondrial function tests, and analysis of ubiquinone levels. No histological changes were observed in any of the animals on study days 5 or 10, but on study day 15, mid- and high-dose animals had necrosis and inflammation in type II skeletal muscle. Elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels in blood (a clinical marker of myopathy) correlated with the histopathological diagnosis of myopathy. Ultrastructural characterization of skeletal muscle revealed disruption of the sarcomere and altered mitochondria only in myofibers with degeneration, while adjacent myofibers were unaffected and had normal mitochondria. Thus, mitochondrial effects appeared not to precede myofiber degeneration. Mean coenzyme Q9 (CoQ9) levels in all dose groups were slightly decreased relative to controls in type II skeletal muscle, although the difference was not significantly different in most cases. Mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle was not affected by the changes in ubiquinone levels. The ubiquinone levels in high-dose-treated animals exhibiting myopathy were not significantly different from low-dose animals with no observable toxic effects. Furthermore, ubiquinone levels did not correlate with circulating CK levels in treated animals. The results of this study suggest that neither mitochondrial injury, nor a decrease in muscle ubiquinone levels, is the primary cause of skeletal myopathy in cerivastatin-dosed rats.",

Both primary and secondary prevention trials of cholesterol lowering, using HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, have demonstrated clear benefits for lipid lowering in preventing both cardiovascular morbidity and mortality over a wide spectrum of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. Even so, risk of events has been reduced by about 30% in these trials, leaving 70% of events occurring even in the presence of substantial cholesterol lowering. It is unknown whether further reduction of serum cholesterol levels will lower risk factors. The relationship between cholesterol lowering and cardiovascular risk, moreover, is not completely defined; it is unclear, at lower cholesterol levels, whether that relationship follows a threshold, a linear, or a curvilinear model. Early studies of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors suggested that non-cardiovascular mortality might be increased at low serum LDL-C levels, however, these concerns have not been supported by subsequent clinical trials. Recent studies have shed further light on the potential benefits of lowering serum cholesterol levels beyond current guideline targets with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. More potent agents in development are likely to make such levels more readily achievable, as well as making guideline targets attainable for many of the large number of patients who currently fail to reach them.", 
    "110": "Dyslipidemia is a major factor responsible for coronary heart disease and its reduction decreases coronary risk in patients with diabetes mellitus. However, the association of dyslipidemia with microvascular complications and the effect of intervention with lipid-lowering therapy in diabetes have been less investigated. We present the systematic review of association and intervention studies pertaining to dyslipidemia and microvascular disease in diabetes and also review possible mechanisms. Dyslipidemia may cause or exacerbate diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy by alterations in the coagulation-fibrinolytic system, changes in membrane permeability, damage to endothelial cells and increased atherosclerosis. Hyperlipidemia is associated with faster decline in glomerular filtration rate and progression of albuminuria and nephropathy. Recent evidence also suggests a role of lipoprotein(a) in progression of retinopathy and nephropathy in patients with diabetes mellitus. Lipid-lowering therapy, using single agents or a combination of drugs may significantly benefit diabetic retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy. In particular, hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors may be effective in preventing or retarding the progression of microvascular complications because of their powerful lipid-lowering effects and other additional mechanisms. However, most of the data are based on short-term studies, and need to be ascertained in long-term studies. Until more specific guidelines are available, aggressive management of diabetic dyslipidemia, according to currently accepted guidelines, should be continued for the prevention of macrovascular disease which would also benefit microvascular complications.", 
    "111": "Combined hyperlipidemia is increasing in frequency and is the most common lipid disorder associated with obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus. It is associated with other features of the metabolic syndrome including hypertension, hyperuricemia, hyperinsulinemia and highly atherogenic subfractions of lipoprotein remnant particles including small dense low density lipoprotein-cholesterol. This review examines the mechanisms by which combined hyperlipidemia arises and the various drugs including fibric acid derivatives, hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, and nicotinic acid which can be used either as monotherapy or in combination to manage it and to improve prognosis from atherosclerotic disease in diabetes mellitus, insulin resistant states and primary combined hyperlipidemia. The therapeutic approach to combined hyperlipidemia involves determination of whether the cause is hepatocyte damage or metabolic derangements. Combined hyperlipidemia due to hepatocyte damage should be treated by attention to the primary cause. In the case of metabolic dysfunction because of imbalance in glucose and fat metabolism, therapy of diabetes mellitus and obesity should be optimised prior to commencement of lipid lowering drugs. Both fibric acid derivatives and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can be used in the treatment of combined hyperlipidemia with fibric acid derivatives having greater effects on triglycerides and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on LDL-C though both have effects on the other cardiovascular risk factors. There is some evidence of benefit with both interventions in mild combined hyperlipidemias and large scale trials are underway. Fibric acid derivatives and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor therapy can be combined with care, provided that gemfibrozil is avoided, fibric acid derivatives are given in the mornings and shorter half -life HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are used at night. Combined hyperlipidemia emergencies occur with predominant hypertriglyceridemia in pregnancy or as a cause of pancreatitis. Therapy in the former should aim to reduce chylomicron production by a low fat diet and intervention to suppress VLDL-C secretion using omega-3 fatty acids. In the latter case, fluid therapy alone and medium chain plasma triglyceride infusions usually reduce levels satisfactorily though apheresis may be required. Blood glucose levels also need aggressive management in these conditions. Combined hyperlipidemia is likely to become an increasing problem with the increase in the prevalence of obesity and diabetes mellitus and needs aggressive management to reduce cardiovascular risk.", 
    "112": "Accumulating evidence indicates that hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. This increased risk is probably substantially mediated through the metabolic interrelationships between serum triglyceride (TG) levels and other risk factors, such as the atherogenic lipid profile (low high density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels and elevated small dense low density lipoprotein levels), insulin resistance, a prothrombotic propensity and low grade systemic inflammation. TG-lowering strategy in patients with HTG encompasses dietary modification and pharmacological agents, such as fibric acid derivatives, fish-oil and hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, which have, besides their known effects on the atherogenic lipid profile, beneficial effects on other determinants of cardiovascular disease. However, in spite of data from trials investigating fibric acid derivative-induced reduction in coronary events in patients with distinct types of hyperlipidemia, no specific trials have been performed that investigated this risk reduction in patients with HTG, in whom other cardiovascular risk factors are clustered as well. Small-scale studies on determinants of cardiovascular disease in patients with HTG and post-hoc analyses of the Helsinki Heart, Veterans Affairs High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Intervention Trial and Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention trials in patients with high serum TG levels suggest a drug-induced reduction in cardiovascular events. However, a specific trial should be conducted to investigate the effects of lipid-lowering therapy on clinical end-points in patients with HTG of defined types.", 
    "113": "Treatment with hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors has been accompanied by a reduced risk of cardiovascular events. Rapid onset of clinical benefit and weak correlations between plasma low density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels and coronary lumen change or cardiovascular events indicates that nonlipid mechanisms are involved in this beneficial effects with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Furthermore, more rapid onset of clinical benefit with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in patients with acute coronary syndromes or acute myocardial infarction than in those with stable coronary heart disease suggest that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors facilitate repair of ruptured or ulcerated atherosclerotic plaque, facilitate plaque stabilization and/or reduce thrombus formation on ruptured plaques. Treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors improved endothelial dysfunction in patients with hypercholesterolemia and this improvement in endothelial function was not correlated with reduction in total serum cholesterol levels. Similarly, reduction in endothelial pre-proendothelin mRNA expression and endothelin synthesis and blood pressure lowering with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors occurred independent of lipid-lowering. Finally, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors increased endothelial nitric oxide levels i.e. upregulated endothelial nitric oxide synthetase expression via post-transcriptional mechanisms and prevented its down-regulation by oxidized LDL-C. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have been shown to modulate the immune response by inhibiting activation of immune-competent cells such as macrophages, and antigen presentation to macrophages by T cells. Treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can reduce expression, production and circulating levels of chemokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) and proinflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factoralpha, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1beta]. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors reduced inflammation in human atheroma: significantly fewer macrophages and T cells, less oxidized LDL-C and higher collagen content. In addition, treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor led to decreased cell death within the atheroma. Treatment with these agents also reduced expression of inducible cellular adhesion molecules, decreased secretion of metalloproteinases by macrophages, reduced vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis. Lastly, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors appear to have important effects on the thrombogenesis: reduced expression of tissue factor production and activity; increased production of tissue factor package inhibitor; decreased platelet thrombus formation and improved fibrinolysis as a result of lowered plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels. As the pluripotential cardioprotective mechanisms of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are further elucidated, it is envisaged that treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors will be initiated earlier and more frequently in patients with hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "114": "Stroke is a heterogeneous disorder with significantly high morbidity and mortality. The relationship between serum cholesterol level and the incidence of stroke remains controversial. Recent evidence from primary and secondary prevention trials suggests that treatment with hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors may reduce the incidence of stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). In this review, we attempt to outline and describe the potential mechanisms of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in the prevention of stroke. In addition to their lipid-lowering action HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors appear to exert their beneficial effects by various nonlipid-lowering mechanisms including anti-inflammatory effects, effect on endothelial function and coagulation cascade. Treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is associated with decreased progression, plaque stablization and even regression of atheromatous plaque in the carotid arteries. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors also inhibit the coagulation cascade at various levels such as activation of prothrombin, factor V, factor X and liberation of tissue factor in response to vascular injury. Inhibition of fibrinolysis occurs secondary to inhibition of plasmin generation. Pravastatin therapy is associated with a reduction in the size of aortic atheroma which is an independent risk factor for stroke. Lastly, left ventricular dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction is associated with an increased risk of stroke and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may indirectly decrease the incidence of stroke by reducing coronary events. Most of these effects are independent of the cholesterol-lowering effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. In conclusion, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may have a role in primary prevention of stroke in patients with CAD.", 
    "115": "Ezetimibe, a synthetic 2-azetidinone, is the first of a new class of compounds that selectively inhibits the absorption of cholesterol and related plant sterols in the intestine. The drug, and its glucuronyl metabolite, are thought to inhibit a putative cholesterol transporter of enterocytes, located within the brush-border membrane of the small intestine. In large, randomized, placebo-controlled, 12-week trials, ezetimibe reduced levels of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) by approximately 18%; triglyceride levels were reduced by approximately 6% in one trial but not another. Ezetimibe produced a modest increase in levels of high density lipoprotein-cholesterol. Moreover, reductions in LDL-C and triglyceride levels were greater in patients treated with ezetimibe coadministered with a statin (lovastatin, pravastatin, atorvastatin or simvastatin), than with either of those agents given alone. The coadministration of the lowest statin dose and ezetimibe produced similar LDL-C reductions to the administration of the highest statin dose alone. Ezetimibe also provided beneficial effects on plasma lipid levels when administered to patients with hypercholesterolemia already receiving a statin. Ezetimibe plus a statin reduced LDL-C levels more than the maximum statin dose alone in a trial in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and was effective in a placebo-controlled trial in patients with homozygous sitosterolemia. The drug was well tolerated in clinical studies conducted to date. In large, randomized, double-blind trials, ezetimibe had a similar tolerability profile to that of placebo. Coadministration of ezetimibe and a statin did not increase the incidence of adverse events related to statin monotherapy.", 
    "116": "Plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) are a powerful independent cardiovascular risk factor, bearing an inverse relationship with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (with risk rising sharply when levels are <1.04 mmol/L). Apart from its protective role in atherosclerosis, HDL-C increases fibrinolysis, is an antioxidant to low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and decreases platelet aggregability. Up to a third of patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease have 'desirable' plasma levels of total cholesterol but low HDL-C levels. Benefits of treating low plasma HDL-C levels were clearly demonstrated in the Veterans Affairs HDL Intervention Trial (VA-HIT) where gemfibrozil reduced nonfatal infarcts and coronary deaths by 22%. This was achieved by a 6% increase in plasma HDL-C levels, and a 24.5% decrease in plasma levels of triglycerides, without any significant decrease in LDL-C levels. Multivariate analyses revealed the rise in plasma HDL-C levels after treatment, but not decreases in plasma levels of triglycerides or LDL-C, predicted coronary artery disease events. The typical patient under consideration in this article is one with plasma levels of HDL-C <1 mmol/L, LDL-C <3.37 mmol/L [either receiving therapeutic lifestyle changes or or LDL-C-lowering therapy comprising a hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor or bile acid sequestrant] and fasting triglycerides <2.26 mmol/L. We propose this dyslipidemia be classified as Type VI phenotype following the Frederickson and Lees classification. High-risk patients (with >/=2 risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or 10-year cardiovascular risk >20%), patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus, or metabolic syndrome should receive pharmacotherapy. Plasma HDL-C levels >1.16 mmol/L may be considered optimal and between 1 and 1.16 mmol/L as desirable. Fibric acid derivatives, nicotinic acid, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, estrogens, and ethanol (not recommended as therapy) increase plasma HDL-C levels. Nicotinic acid is the most potent agent and recent reports indicate that, in contrast to gemfibrozil, it selectively increases antiatherogenic HDL subfraction, lipoprotein (Lp) AI (without apolipoprotein AII), in patients with low plasma HDL-C levels. An extended-release formulation, administered once daily, has improved the tolerability of nicotinic acid. Recent evidence also indicates that nicotinic acid may effectively correct dyslipidemia in patients with diabetes mellitus without significantly compromising glycemic control. Fibric acid derivatives and estrogen raise plasma HDL-C levels by different mechanisms of action, and these agents may be used with nicotinic acid. Combination therapy (especially HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and nicotinic acid) should be considered in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and low plasma HDL-C levels.", 
    "117": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors significantly reduce the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) events and CAD-related mortality in patients with and without established CAD. Consequently, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have a central role within recommendations for lipid-modifying therapy. However, despite these guidelines, only one-third to one-half of eligible patients receive lipid-lowering therapy and as few as one-third of these patients achieve recommended target serum levels of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol. The underuse of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in eligible patients has important implications for mortality, morbidity and cost, given the enormous economic burden associated with CAD; direct healthcare costs, estimated at US $16-53 billion (2000 values) in the US and 1.6 billion pound (1996 values) in the UK alone, are largely driven by inpatient care. Hospitalization costs are reduced by treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, particularly in high-risk groups such as patients with CAD and diabetes mellitus in whom net cost savings may be achieved. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are underused because of institutional factors and clinician and patient factors. Also, the vast number of patients eligible for treatment means that the use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is undoubtedly limited by budgetary considerations. Secondary prevention in CAD using HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is certainly cost effective. Primary prevention with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is also cost effective in many patients, depending upon CAD risk and drug dosage. As new, more powerful, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors come to market, and the established HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors come off patent, the identification of the most cost-effective therapy becomes increasingly complex. Research in to the relative cost effectiveness of alternative HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, taking full account of the institutional, clinician and patient barriers to uptake should be undertaken to identify the most appropriate role for the new therapies.", 
    "118": "It has been clearly shown that lowering low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) [most often with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor] decreases the risk of a cardiovascular event. However, this risk reduction was, at most, 35% in clinical trials, meaning that many events could not be prevented. Moreover, reaching target lipid values as recommended by the current guidelines is often difficult, mainly in high-risk situations such as secondary prevention or type 2 diabetes mellitus. As the two main classes of lipid-lowering drugs (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and fibric acid derivatives) have complementary effects on lipid parameters, it seems logical to combine both treatments particularly in patients with combined hyperlipidemia. In fact, combination therapy with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and a fibric acid derivative induces a further decrease in LDL-C levels compared with monotherapy and improves other lipid values such as high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride (TG) levels. Unfortunately, there are currently no available randomized, prospective clinical data on the reduction of the incidence of cardiovascular events with such a combination. This is mainly because the use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and fibric acid derivative combinations was initially described as dangerous. It is true that such a combination increases the risk of muscle toxicity that already exists with monotherapy. Muscle toxicity can eventually lead to life-threatening rhabdomyolysis and some precautions of use are required; however, the risk seems actually lower than what has been initially reported. The use of combined therapy with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and a fibric acid derivative requires the respect of some rules such as avoiding the prescription in patients with concomitant conditions like renal failure and avoiding the use of gemfibrozil as a fibric acid derivative in such a combination. It is now imperative to design clinical trials to determine the clinical efficacy and precise safety of this combined treatment especially in patients with abnormalities in every parameter of the lipid triad (LDL, HDL and TG) and a high vascular risk such as patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

Reference patients were gender, age and pharmacy or region matched patients who were using any HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor other than cerivastatin on the same date. The main outcome measure was discontinuation of lipid-lowering drug use.

Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to obtain parameter epsilon determining the exact form of the social welfare function in Catalonia, Spain.

Aspirin therapy is the best-documented treatment to avoid another stroke, both in the acute and the long-term perspective. Warfarin treatment is fairly well documented for stroke patients with atrial fibrillation. Heparin therapy increases the risk for serious haemorrhage. Blood-pressure-lowering with a combined ACE-inhibitor and diuretic regimen has been shown to reduce the recurrence rate in younger patients with hemorrhagic as well as ischemic stroke. Statin therapy could be offered to younger stroke patients with a history of coronary heart disease.

    "141": "This study tested the hypotheses that (i) lipophilic statins (atorvastatin and simvastatin) impair ventricular recovery from myocardial ischemia-reperfusion, owing to their greater myocyte permeability, compared with a hydrophilic statin (pravastatin), and (ii) statins enhance endothelium-dependent vasodilation of isolated coronary arteries from the ischemic region. Farm pigs consumed chow supplemented with atorvastatin (2.5 mg.kg(-1).d(-1); n=6), pravastatin (10 (n=3) or 20 (n=2) mg.kg(-1).d(-1)), simvastatin (5 mg.kg(-1).d(-1); n=6), or no statin (control; n=6) for 3 weeks. Animals were anesthetized and instrumented to measure regional (% segment shortening) and global (dP/dt max) left ventricular (LV) function during coronary artery occlusion (10 min) and reperfusion (30 min). Coronary resistance (i.d. = 119 +/- 3 microm) and conductance (i.d. = 487 +/- 11 microm) arteries were isolated from the ischemic region to measure receptor-dependent (acetylcholine (ACh)) and -independent (KCl) vasoconstriction, and endothelium-dependent (bradykinin (BK)) and -independent (sodium nitroprusside (SNP)) vasodilation. At 30 min reperfusion, neither percent recovery of regional ventricular function (atorvastatin, 24% +/- 15%; pravastatin, 36% +/- 13%; simvastatin, 29% +/- 13%; control, 36% +/- 13%) nor percent recovery of global LV cardiac function differed among groups. However, BK-induced vasorelaxation of coronary conductance vessels was greater (P<0.05) in statins versus controls, and ACh-induced vasoconstriction was less in simvastatin-treated animals, suggesting the potential for enhanced coronary arterial blood flow to the jeopardized region. In conclusion, our data suggest that ischemia-induced myocardial stunning is similar among pigs treated for 3 weeks with atorvastatin, pravastatin, or simvastatin, even though statin treatment appears to augment endothelium-dependent vasodilation of conductance, but not resistance, vessels subjected to ischemia-reperfusion.",

We also found a severe decrease in her serum total carnitine level of 22 micromol/l (normal range 45-91 micromol/l) before changing the diet, suggesting secondary carnitine deficiency. Severe hyperlipidemia was reversed by changing the carnitine deficient diet (Ensureliquid) to a carnitine-containing diet.

The 7 patients who did not participate in lipid-lowering therapy and who exhibited an increased cholesterol level were also examined (CFR 2.03 +/- 0.88).

New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits aged 37 weeks (control), Watanabe Heritable Hyperlipidemic rabbits (WHHL) aged 37 weeks, and WHHL aged 35 weeks with fluvastatin treatment of 17 weeks (10 mg/kg/d) were examined. Aortas were isolated for isometric tension recording. Both endothelium-dependent and independent relaxation were impaired in WHHL. Fluvastatin significantly restored impaired endothelium-independent relaxation (WHHL: 57 +/- 12 versus WHHL+ fluvastatin: 150 +/- 22%; P < 0.05) and in tendency endothelium-dependent relaxation (WHHL: 26 +/- 5 versus WHHL+ fluvastatin: 83 +/- 29%; (P = 0.07)). In parallel, fluvastatin restored nitrite plasma level in hyperlipoproteinemic animals (WHHL: 480 (13-3821) versus WHHL+ fluvastatin: 808 (467-1595) nmol; P < 0.05). Thus, chronic treatment with fluvastatin not only improves endothelial but also vascular smooth muscle function in hyperlipoproteinemia, which may contribute to the beneficial clinical effects of statins.",

Randomized patients are expected to be followed for an average of 5 years. The primary end point is the time to occurrence of a major cardiovascular event, defined as coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or stroke. The large patient numbers in the TNT study and long follow-up should ensure that there is adequate power to definitively determine if reducing LDL cholesterol levels to approximately 75 mg/dl (1.9 mmol/L) can provide additional clinical benefit.", 
    "156": "The metabolic syndrome, which is a set of lipid and nonlipid risk factors of metabolic origin linked with insulin resistance, is believed to be associated with an elevated risk for cardiovascular disease, but few have studied this association in prospective long-term cardiovascular outcomes trials. Placebo data from the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) and the Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study (AFCAPS/TexCAPS) were used post hoc to estimate the long-term relative risk of major coronary events (MCEs) associated with the metabolic syndrome, after excluding diabetes mellitus. In 4S and AFCAPS/TexCAPS, respectively, placebo-treated patients with the metabolic syndrome were 1.5 (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 1.8) and 1.4 (95% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.9) times more likely to have MCEs than those without it. Of the components of the metabolic syndrome, low high-density lipoprotein levels were associated with elevated risk of MCEs in both studies, whereas high triglycerides in 4S and elevated blood pressure and obesity in AFCAPS/TexCAPS were associated with significantly increased relative risk. Patients with the metabolic syndrome showed increased risk of MCEs irrespective of their Framingham-calculated 10-year risk score category (>20% vs </=20%). These data demonstrate that the metabolic syndrome is associated with increased risk of MCEs in both hypercholesterolemic patients with coronary heart disease in 4S and in those with low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol but without coronary heart disease in AFCAPS/TexCAPS. It appears that the metabolic syndrome is associated with risk that is not entirely accounted for by traditional risk scoring paradigms.",

Research from genetics, epidemiology, and cell biology all converge, suggesting that cholesterol plays a central role in the biology of amyloid precursor protein and the toxic peptide generated by its cleavage, beta-amyloid (Abeta). The ability of cholesterol to modulate Abeta production suggests opportunities for therapeutic intervention, although the functional significance underlying the connection between cholesterol and Abeta remains to be investigated.", 
    "162": "For about a century there has been recognition that calcium and lipids bind to one another in the gut, each interfering with the other's absorption. Calcium also causes malabsorption of bile acids, which is likely to contribute further to malabsorption of fat. High dietary calcium intakes may also have stimulatory effects on lipolysis. These mechanisms provide a basis for hypothesising that calcium supplementation may impact on circulating lipid concentrations, and there is now a significant amount of observational and trial data indicating that this is the case. The largest randomised controlled trial of calcium effects on lipids was carried out in 223 healthy postmenopausal women, and found that low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) decreased 6.3% and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) increased by 7.3% at 1-year. The resultant 16.4% increase in HDL-C/LDL-C ratio would be predicted to reduce cardiovascular event rates by 20-30%, which is consistent with the available observational data. There are no trial data addressing this question and it is possible that other lipid-lowering agents, such as hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, might impact on cardiac event rates by mechanisms other than by lowering cholesterol levels. Therefore, caution is appropriate in incorporating these findings into clinical practice, but the balance of evidence suggests that calcium is a cost-effective adjunct to the dietary management of hyperlipidaemia.",

Hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) have been associated with myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Although rhabdomyolysis is a rare adverse event associated with this class of drugs, their prevalent use in the management of dyslipidemia makes it increasingly important for clinicians to understand the nature of this condition. Rhabdomyolysis can occur with all statins when used alone and particularly when combined with other drugs that are themselves myotoxic or that elevate the concentration of the statin. Statins are particularly susceptible to the latter effect because of their metabolism by the CYP450 system and their low oral bioavailability. In this report, we describe a case of rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure secondary to the interaction between danazol and simvastatin.", 
    "168": "At the beginning of atherosclerosis before evidence of morphological lesions or plaques, vascular distensibility or arterial compliance decreased gradually. This endothelial dysfunction is regarded as an early feature of atherosclerosis. In a randomized, double-blind study design, group 1 (12 patients; 7 males, 5 females) with serum LDL-C levels higher than 170 mg/dL and without any other risk factor for atherosclerosis received three months of 20 mg/day atorvastatin treatment while group 11 (8 males, 4 females) with the same characteristics received 80 mg/day. Baseline and posttreatment serum lipid fractions and arterial compliance were measured. Arterial compliance was measured noninvasively in the left common carotid artery with color Doppler ultrasound. Atorvastatin reduced total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, and triglyceride levels by 32% (P < 0.001), 40.8% (P < 0.001), and 19% (P < 0.001), respectively, and increased HDL-C by 6.9%, (P = 0.002) in the first group. In the second group these reductions were 38.5% (P < 0.001), 46.2% (P < 0.001), and 26.78% (P < 0.001), respectively, and the increase in HDL was 7.8% (P = 0.03). It was observed that the decrease in serum TC, LDL-C and triglyceride levels were significantly higher in the second group than the first group. With atorvastatin, the distensibility coefficient (DC) and compliance coefficient (CC) increased from 18.7 +/- 3.4 to 21.3 +/- 2.9 10(-3) x kPa(-1) (P < 0.001) and from 0.69 +/- 0.05 to 0.77 +/- 0.03 mm2 x kPa(-1) (P < 0.001) in the first group while they changed from 18.3 +/- 3.6 to 21.9 +/- 3.0 10(-3) x kPa(-1) (P < 0.001) and from 0.70 +/- 0.04 to 0.81 +/- 0.01 mm2 x kPa(-1) (P < 0.001) respectively, in the second group. DC and CC increased in both groups, but the differences between the groups were not significant. High doses of atorvastatin reduce blood lipid levels more than conventional doses, however, the change in compliance is not dose-dependent. As endothelial dysfunction is regarded as an early feature of atherosclerosis, there would be no need to administer aggressive doses in a patient without any risk factors other than hyperlipidemia.", 
    "169": "We retrospectively compared the incidence of cardiac events in myocardial infarction (MI) patients treated in our departments between 1990 and 1999 with pravastatin or without cholesterol-lowering agents. Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of pravastatin in the secondary prevention of MI. Cardiac events--defined as fatal or nonfatal recurrent MI, sudden cardiac death, and death from congestive heart failure--occurred in 8 (2.2%) of 356 MI patients treated with pravastatin (17.1 cases/1.000 person x year) and in 39 (5.6%) of 700 MI patients not treated with cholesterol-lowering agents (54.3 cases/1000 person x year), which represented a significant decline among those taking pravastatin (P < 0.05, odds ratio: 0.39, 95% (CI: 0.18-0.84). Likewise, total mortality was significantly lower among patients treated with pravastatin (18 cases, 5.1%; 38.4 cases/1,000 person x year vs 77 cases, 11.0%; 107.2 cases/1,000 person x year, P < 0.01, odds ratio: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.25-0.73). Subgroup analysis revealed a significantly lower incidence or cardiac events in the pravastatin group for 6 of the items among 53 patient characteristics, and was lower but not significant for 45 items and was greater but not significant only for 2 items. Furthermore, multivariate analysis confirmed pravastatin to be a useful factor for preventing the occurrence of cardiac events in MI patients (P < 0.05, odds ratio: (0.44, 95% CI: 0.20-0.95), and Kaplan-Meier curves also showed pravastatin to significantly reduce the incidence of both cardiac events and total mortality. These findings are consistent with those previously reported by several large-scale clinical trials carried out in Western countries, and demonstrate that pravastatin is useful for secondary prevention of MI in Japanese patients.", 
    "170": "The role of lipoproteins secreted by cortical glial cells in axon growth of central nervous system (CNS) neurons was investigated. We first established compartmented cultures of CNS neurons (retinal ganglion cells). Addition of glial cell-conditioned medium (GCM) to distal axons increased the rate of axon extension by approximately 50%. Inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase in glial cells diminished the secretion of cholesterol and apolipoprotein E, and prevented the growth stimulatory effect of GCM. When glia-derived lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein E were provided to distal axons, axon extension was stimulated to the same extent as by GCM. In contrast, addition of lipoproteins to cell bodies failed to enhance growth. The growth stimulatory effect of glial lipoproteins was abrogated in the presence of receptor-associated protein, RAP, indicating involvement of receptor(s) of the low density lipoprotein receptor family in stimulation of axonal extension. These observations suggest that glial cells stimulate axon growth of CNS neurons by providing lipoproteins containing cholesterol and apolipoprotein E to distal axons.",

The objectives of this study were: to determine the effects of diet and exercise on Lp(a) and to evaluate the relation of Lp(a) with the lipid profile (total serum cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol). Baseline Lp(a), body mass index (BMI) and the lipid profiles were measured in 343 Obese (BMI >30kg/m(2)) African-Americans. After a 3-month intervention of diet and exercise by 105 participants, their lipids were re-measured. Baseline Lp(a) levels ranged from 1.2 to 280mg/dl. Lp(a) was inversely associated with triglyceride (P<0.05). After the intervention, Lp(a) and HDL increased by a mean of 20 and 5%, respectively. Total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL and BMI decreased by 7, 10, 11 and 8%, respectively. Women taking estrogen replacement had a negligible change in Lp(a) while participants taking HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors had an increase in Lp(a) levels by 30%.", 
    "172": "The beneficial effects of statins in atherosclerosis have been partly attributed to their immunomodulating functions. Dendritic cells (DC), which are \"professional\" antigen-presenting cells, were recently detected in atherosclerotic plaques. It is assumed that DC play a critical role in the immunological processes related to atherosclerosis. Thus, we investigated the effects of statins on maturation and antigen-presenting function of DC. Human monocyte-derived DC were incubated with simvastatin or atorvastatin (1-10microM) for different periods (1-48h), and were subsequently stimulated with a cytokine cocktail (1.25ng/ml TNF-alpha, 1ng/ml Il-1beta, and 0.5microg/ml prostaglandin E(2)) to induce maturation. In contrast to untreated DC, statin-preincubated DC exhibited an immature phenotype and a significantly lower expression of the maturation-associated markers CD83, CD40, CD86, HLA-DR, and CCR7. The inhibitory statin effect was completely reversed by mevalonate or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. In addition, preincubation with statins significantly reduced the ability of cytokine-stimulated DC to induce T cell proliferation. In the present study, we have shown that statins inhibit the maturation and antigen-presenting function of human myeloid dendritic cells, thus maybe contributing to their beneficial effects in atherosclerosis. Therefore, the use of statins as immunomodulators might also provide a new therapeutic approach to other immunological disorders.",

Combined excretion was 10-fold elevated in comparison to control during inadequate glucose maintenance, and still elevated following dietary improvement. 3MGC acid excretion correlated with plasma lactate and glucose. We speculate that imbalanced gluconeogenesis and de novo cholesterol synthesis result in secondarily increased 3MGC/3MGR production.", 
    "174": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors or statins are newly identified immunomodulators. In vivo treatment of SJL/J mice with lovastatin reduced the duration and clinical severity of active and passive experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for multiple sclerosis. Lovastatin induced the expression of GATA3 and the phosphorylation of STAT6, whereas it inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of Janus kinase 2, tyrosine kinase 2, and STAT4. Inhibition of the Janus kinase-STAT4 pathway by lovastatin modulated T0 to Th1 differentiation and reduced cytokine (IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha) production, thus inducing Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10). It inhibited T-bet (T box transcription factor) and NF-kappaB in activated T cells and significantly reduced infiltration of CD4- and MHC class II-positive cells to CNS. Further, it stabilized IL-4 production and GATA-3 expression in differentiated Th2 cells, whereas in differentiated Th1 cells it inhibited the expression of T-bet and reduced the production of IFN-gamma. Moreover, lovastatin-exposed macrophage and BV2 (microglia) in allogeneic MLRs induced the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. These observations indicate that the anti-inflammatory effects of lovastatin are mediated via T cells as well as APCs, because it modulates the polarization patterns of naive T cell activation in an APC-independent system. Together, these findings reveal that lovastatin may have possible therapeutic value involving new targets (in both APCs and T cells) for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and other inflammatory diseases.", 
    "175": "Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or Oncostatin M (OSM), both mitogens for Swiss mouse 3T3 cells, triggers initiation of DNA synthesis without the requirement for mevalonic acid. Thus, Lovastatin (LOV), an inhibitor of the hydroxy methylglutaryl CoA (HMGCoA) reductase, does not block LIF or OSM induced DNA replication and cell multiplication. In contrast, increasing concentrations of LOV from 1 to 60 microM block the mitogenic action of PGF(2alpha) by decreasing the number of cells capable of entering S-phase and dividing. This inhibition by LOV can be reversed by addition of mevanolactone (MEV), an analogue of mevalonic acid. Thus, LIF or OSM triggers initiation of DNA replication independently of mevalonic acid synthesis and therefore without the involvement of isoprenylation of various signalling proteins."
