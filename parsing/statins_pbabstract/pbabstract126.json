However, the impact of long-term statin therapy on postprocedure MI remains unknown. We examined the impact of long-term statin therapy on cardiac enzyme (cardiac troponin I [cTnI] and creatine kinase-MB [CK-MB]) increases after PCI in patients undergoing nonemergency PCI. Using the 2004/2005 Cornell Angioplasty Registry, we evaluated 1,482 patients undergoing elective or urgent PCI with normal preprocedure cardiac enzymes levels (cTnI and CK-MB). The population was divided into 2 groups: (1) patients on long-term (\u22657 days) statin therapy before PCI (n = 1,073) and (2) patients not on long-term statin regimen (n = 409). Cardiac enzyme levels after PCI were assessed at 8, 12, and 18 hours after PCI. An increase in cTnI \u22651 time upper-limit of normal (ULN) was observed in 830 patients (56.1%) and an increase in cTnI \u22653 times ULN was observed in 518 patients (35.0%). There was no difference in incidence of cTnI increases \u22653 times ULN in patients on long-term statin therapy versus those not on long-term statin therapy in the overall group (35.1% vs 34.5%, p = 0.855). There was a trend toward a lower incidence of small cTnI increases \u22651 time ULN in patients on long-term statin therapy versus those not receiving long-term statins (54.6% vs 59.7%, p = 0.090). Incidence of CK-MB increases \u22651 time or \u22653 times ULN and peak cTnI and CK-MB levels were similar between the 2 groups. In a subgroup of patients with unstable angina, long-term statin therapy decreased small cTnI increases (\u22651 time ULN) after PCI (54.6% vs 64.3%, p = 0.023). The greatest benefit in decrease of MIs after PCI was seen in patients with unstable angina receiving long-term high-dose statin therapy. In conclusion, long-term statin therapy did not decrease the incidence of periprocedural MI in patients with stable coronary artery disease undergoing nonemergency PCI. In patients with unstable coronary syndromes, long-term statin therapy may be beneficial, particularly at a high dose.",

After ROC curve analysis with respect to the combined endpoint (AUC 0.72), we concluded that a value of 18.5U conferred a sensitivity of 75.0% and a specificity of 68% to that result. We therefore created two groups based on that level: group A - platelet aggregation <18.5U, n=44; and group B - platelet aggregation \u226518.5U, n=26. The groups were similar with respect to demographic data (age 60.5 [49.0-65.0] vs. 62.0 [49.0-65.0] years, p=0.21), previous cardiovascular history, and admission diagnosis. There were no associations between left ventricular ejection fraction, GRACE risk score, or length of hospital stay and platelet aggregation. The groups were also similar with respect to antiplatelet, anticoagulant, proton pump inhibitor (63.6 vs. 46.2%, p=0.15) and statin therapy. The variability in platelets and hemoglobin was also similar between groups. Combined event-free survival was higher in group A (96.0 vs. 76.7%, log-rank p<0.01).

    "6": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia and one of the major causes of morbidity and hospitalization. It is an important risk factor for thromboembolic complications and cerebrovascular disease. In AF, extensive electrical and structural remodeling of atrial tissue takes place with the main underlying mechanisms being inflammation and fibrosis. In recent years it has been shown, that beside conventional antiarrhythmic therapies, modalities aiming at reversal of atrial tissue derangement could be of some benefit in the treatment of AF. In this respect, the main focus was oriented towards drugs such as angiotensin convertase (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), polyunsaturated fatty acids and statins. Data about the potential beneficial role of statins for AF treatment is continuously growing. It is now evident that statins act on AF mainly through their pleiotropic and not their lipid lowering properties. Several retrospective trials have shown that statins exert antiarrhythmic effects in patients with AF, while data from prospective studies are still conflicting. Thus, the definitive confirmation and explanation of statin's role in AF treatment is still missing. Herein, the current patophysiological concepts providing rationale for the use of statins in AF treatment as well as up-to-date data from retrospective and prospective clinical studies are reviewed and discussed. Particular attention is paid to various clinical settings such as primary prevention, secondary prevention (post-cardioversion) and postoperative setting. We also present our own data regarding the role of statins in prevention of the recurrence of AF after successful cardioversion.",

    "12": "A pilot survey was performed to determine the presence of known risk factors for cardiovascular disease in Croatian patients with diagnosed coronary heart disease (CHD) using a new questionnaire. The idea was to test this new and very simple questionnaire but also to compare the data collected in this pilot survey with the results of the last Croatian national survey (TASPIC-CRO V) and so to obtain the information whether secondary prevention has improved between 2003 and 2010. 122 patients with established CHD (88 men, 34 women, mean age 66.3 years) treated in Zagreb University Hospital Center were included. Data collection was based on filling the SURF questionnaire right after the clinical exam or later using review of medical records. Patients were hospitalized because of CABG (1%), PCI (8%), ACS (35%) or chronic stable angina (56%). The history of arterial hypertension had 95%patients (however, on admission mean systolic pressure was 130.1 mmHg, diastolic 76.8 mmHg), 90% had dyslipidaemia (total cholesterol <4.5 mmol/L had 43%; <4.0 mmol/L 33%; LDL-cholesterol <2.5 mmol/L 49%; <2.0 mmol/L 32%; HDL>1.2 mmol/L (women) or >1.0 mmol/L (men) had 67%), 25% had diabetes which was poorly regulated (mean HbA1c 8.2%), 18% were active smokers. After discharge only 24% performed cardiac rehabilitation. Mean body mass index of the patients was 28.3 kg/m2 (32% were obese, 72% overweight). Compared to TASPIC-CRO V there was lower usage of aspirin than recommended on discharge. This was also true for statin therapy. More patients were taking beta blockers, calcium antagonists and diuretics than 7 years ago. This pilot survey showed that CRO-SURF questionnaire is short, quick, effective and simple to use. It is a good and cost effective tool to collect data on CVD risk factors and their management. The results obtained by using it indicate that there is still a high prevalence of modifiable risk factors in Croatian patients with CHD.", 
    "13": "Membrane transporters can play a clinically important role in drug absorption and disposition; Caco-2 and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells are the most widely used in vitro models for studying the functions of these transporters and associated drug interactions. Transport studies using these cell models are mostly focused on apical transporters, whereas basolateral drug transport processes are largely ignored. However, for some hydrophilic drugs, a basolateral uptake transporter may be required for drugs to enter cells before they can interact with apical efflux transporters. The objective of this study was to evaluate potential differences in drug transport across Caco-2 and MDCK basolateral membrane that could cause discrepancy in the identification of efflux transporter substrates and to elucidate the underlying factors that may cause such differences, using rosuvastatin as a model substrate. Bidirectional transport results in Caco-2 and breast cancer resistance protein-MDCK cells demonstrated the necessity of an uptake transporter at the basolateral membrane for rosuvastatin. Kinetic study revealed saturable and nonsaturable processes for rosuvastatin uptake across the Caco-2 basolateral membrane, with the saturable process encompassing >75% of overall rosuvastatin basolateral uptake at concentrations below the K(m) (4.2 \u03bcM). Furthermore, rosuvastatin basolateral transport exhibited cis-inhibition and trans-stimulation phenomena, indicating a facilitated diffusion mechanism. This basolateral transporter appeared to be a prerequisite for rosuvastatin and perhaps for other hydrophilic substrates to interact with apical efflux transporters. Deficit of such a basolateral transporter in certain cell models may lead to false-negative results when screening drug interactions with apical efflux transporters.",

This therapeutic strategy is based on results of randomized trials of open repair versus ultrasound surveillance of small AAA (<5.5 cm). Studies of screening for AAA have shown that >90% of aneurysms detected are small aneurysms (<5.5 cm). Despite the low annual risk of rupture of these aneurysms, patients with small AAA are left with a potentially life-threatening disease for which no immediate treatment is available. Hence, medical treatment directed at limiting the expansion of small AAA has emerged as an alternative therapeutic strategy. Randomized trials of doxycycline, roxithromycin, and propranolol in patients with small AAA have been published. The results of the doxycycline and roxithromycin trials suggest that both medications can limit AAA expansion, especially during the first year of treatment. Propranolol did not limit AAA expansion, and the trials were stopped because of its serious side effects. In other studies, statins and indomethacin have also been shown to limit AAA expansion. However, these studies were observational with relatively small numbers of patients. Thus, large randomized controlled trials with long follow-up are needed to objectively assess the efficacy of medications that have shown potential in limiting AAA expansion. In addition, recent evidence of regression of AAA in experimental animal models is likely to change our concepts of the molecular pathogenesis of AAA, and could make medical treatment of small AAA a possibility.",

We discuss in full detail the methodological strengths and pitfalls of published data including three cohort studies suggesting that the use of statins may protect from the development of HCC and of a single trial reporting increased survival in those with advanced HCC randomized to receive statins. A remarkably hepato-safe class of drugs acting on both hepatocyte and endothelial cells, statins also have potentially beneficial effects in lowering portal hypertension. In conclusion, there is strong experimental evidence that statins are beneficial in chemopreventing and slowing the growth of HCC.

However, the genetic basis for CIMT variation is almost unknown. Cardiovascular genetics has led to numerous clinical studies generally focused on only one candidate gene and were frequently conducted in subjects with cardiovascular diseases and/or taking drugs that could affect CIMT. Pharmacogenetics is the study of the effect of a medication as it relates to single or defined sets of genes. An important goal of pharmacogenetics in cardiovascular disorders is to integrate the two (drugs plus genes) so that true personalized therapy can be delivered.

Two such genes, cysteinyl aspartate-specific protease-3 (caspase-3), an apoptosis activator, and B-cell leukemia-2 (Bcl-2), an apoptosis suppressor, are tightly regulated for their expression and activation. Statins, inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, have been recently recognized as neuroprotective drugs. However, their underlying mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, we examined the neuroprotective effects of simvastatin in a rat model of SE induced by kainic acid (KA). Feeding of simvastatin for 3 days after kainate injection rescued SE-induced neuronal apoptosis, as determined by histological examination of brain sections at the level of the dorsal hippocampus. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed that SE treatment markedly increased caspase-3 mRNA expression and reduced Bcl-2 mRNA expression in the hippocampus. Similarly, western blot analysis and immunohistochemical analysis of the rat hippocampus demonstrated that under SE treatment, caspase-3 protein levels significantly increased and peaked at 72 h, whereas Bcl-2 protein levels decreased from 6-24 h following SE. Interestingly, simvastatin could reverse the aforementioned SE-induced changes, suggesting that the neuroprotective effects of simvastatin against neuronal apoptosis may be achieved by inhibiting caspase-3 expression and increasing Bcl-2 expression.", 
    "85": "Ubiquinone (Q) is a product in the cholesterol synthesis pathway and is an essential component of the respiratory chain in the mitochondrial membrane. In addition, extra-mitochondrial Q has anti-oxidative properties and this fraction is increased during carcinogenesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate if extra-mitochondrial level of Q is affected by statin treatment in a rat model for liver cancer, and if this change correlates with inhibited carcinogenesis. To do this we isolated sub-cellular fractions of rat livers from a previous experiment where we have shown anti-carcinogenic effects of statins. The levels of Q(8), Q(9) and Q(10) were analysed with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The Q(9)-levels, constituting the major part of Q in rats, were not significantly affected in any of the sub-cellular compartments. The levels of Q(10), constituting a minor part of Q in rats but the major part of Q in humans, were significantly decreased by about 60% in the statin treated rats. The decrease was present in all sub-cellular compartments, but was most pronounced in the cytosol. There was a significant correlation between extra-mitochondrial Q(10) levels and inhibited carcinogenesis. No such correlation was observed with extra-mitochondrial Q(9). The reduced Q(10)-levels might be explained by the reduced availability of isoprene units during statin treatment, shifting the synthesis towards isoforms with shorter side-chains. In line with this hypothesis there were increased levels of Q(8)-levels during statin treatment. The results support our previous suggestion that at least part of the anti-carcinogenic effect of statins in our rat model is mediated by effects on synthesis of Q. We also demonstrate a shift in the Q-synthesis pathway towards isoforms with shorter side-chains during statin treatment. The ratio between the different Q-isoforms might be used as a more sensitive marker of statin-induced inhibition of Q than measuring total Q levels.",

B cells initially thought to be atheroprotective provide opposing roles by their different subsets. Unlike B2 cells that are atherogenic, serosal B1a cells are atheroprotective by producing natural IgM antibodies that clear modified low-density lipoprotein and apoptotic and necrotic debris. In addition to natural IgM antibodies, B1a cells may act as regulatory B cells by producing the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, which inhibits proinflammatory cytokines secreted by activated macrophages and T cells in atherosclerotic lesions. These findings suggest in vivo expansion of atheroprotective B1a cells as a potential therapeutic strategy to augment the benefits of lipid-lowering statin therapy.", 
    "89": "Alcohol consumption has been implicated to cause severe hepatic steatosis which is mediated by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity and CYP(450) 2E1 expression. In this context, the effect of ethanol was studied for its influence on lipogenesis in HepG2 cell which is deficient of ADH and does not express CYP(450) 2E1. The results showed that ethanol at 100mM concentration caused 40% cytotoxicity at 72h as determined by MTT assay. The incorporation of labeled [2-(14)C] acetate into triacylglycerol and phospholipid was increased by 40% and 26% respectively upon 24h incubation, whereas incorporation of labeled [2-(14)C] acetate into cholesterol was not significantly increased. Further, ethanol inhibited HMG-CoA reductase which is a rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis. It was observed that, HMG-CoA reductase inhibition was brought about by ethanol as a consequence of decreased cell viability, since incubation of HepG2 cells with mevalonate could not increase the cholesterol content and increase the cell viability. Addition of ethanol significantly increased TNF-alpha secretion and depleted mitochondrial coenzyme-Q(10) which is detrimental for cell viability. But vitamin E (10mM) could partially restore coenzyme-Q(10) and glutathione content with decreased TNF-alpha secretion in ethanol treated cells. Further, lipid peroxidation, glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase enzyme activities remained unaffected. Ethanol decreased glutathione content while, GSH/GSSG ratio was significantly higher compared to other groups showing cellular pro-oxidant and antioxidant balance remained intact. Alanine amino transferase activity was increased by 4.85 folds in cells treated with ethanol confirming hepatocyte damage. Hence, it is inferred that ethanol induced cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells due to coenzyme-Q(10) depletion and increased TNF-alpha secretion.",

Recent literature supports an association between inflammatory bowel disease and coronary artery disease. While hypertension increases the risk of coronary artery disease in inflammatory bowel disease patients, other typical risk factors have not been confirmed, and markers of inflammation may predict coronary artery disease risk in this population. Common cardiovascular drugs such as statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may have dual potential for controlling inflammatory bowel disease and preventing or treating coronary artery disease. Large, prospective, longitudinal studies can help to determine the true prevalence of coronary artery disease in this population and confirm risk factors.

Lp(a) cholesterol [Lp(a)-C] was measured with the Vertical Auto Profile (upper limit of normal, 10 mg/dL). Lp(a) particle concentrations [Lp(a)-P] were measured with an isoform-independent molar assay (upper limit of normal, 70 nmol/L). The subjects were divided into the following four groups on the basis of their Lp(a)-C and Lp(a)-P levels: normal Lp(a)-P and Lp(a)-C; high Lp(a)-P and normal Lp(a)-C; normal Lp(a)-P and high Lp(a)-C; and high Lp(a)-P and Lp(a)-C. The proportion of subjects with values above the upper limit of normal was similar with both assays (P = .15). However, the Lp(a)-C and Lp(a)-P assays discordantly classified 23% of the study's subjects. In addition, the four Lp(a)-defined groups displayed differences in their relationships with other lipoproteins. The two groups with elevated Lp(a)-C showed significant associations with higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein AI, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol/apolipoprotein AI ratios. Triglycerides were also noted to be above normal in discordant and normal within concordant Lp(a) groups. Finally, the amount of cholesterol per Lp(a) particle [Lp(a)-C/Lp(a)-P] varied widely across the four groups. These findings suggest that the four Lp(a)-defined groups are physiologically discrete. Further investigation is warranted to assess which parameters among Lp(a)-P, Lp(a)-C, and Lp(a)-C/Lp(a)-P can be used to more accurately characterize Lp(a)-associated cardiovascular risk.",

Seven (n\u00a0= 4 PITA, n\u00a0= 3 ATOR) and 10 (n\u00a0= 5 PITA, n\u00a0= 5 ATOR) patients experienced episodes of ALT >100 IU/L at weeks 4 and 12, respectively, with one patient in each group excluded because of severe ALT elevation >3\u00d7 ULN (>120 IU/L) at week 4.

Medication was initiated at age 9 (2-35) years, and apheresis treatment at age 10 (6-44) years. Regular once-weekly apheresis combined with the maximum-tolerable doses of a statin and ezetimibe reduced LDL cholesterol to 197 (170-282) mg/dL (5.1 [4.5-7.3] mmol/L) pre-apheresis and 85 (50-108) mg/dL (2.2 [1.3-2.8] mmol/L) post-apheresis.

    "123": "Researchers from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) Collaboration have argued for maximal lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by the use of pharmacologic agents, with the strongest evidence coming from the five comparison statin studies in their second meta-analysis. The CTT meta-analysis has many strengths but also a number of limitations, which have not been discussed and which, given the clinical implications, require consideration. Among these are: (1) the impact and validity of including revascularizations within a composite primary end point; (2) the inclusion of the A-Z study, whose design does not allow for valid comparisons of two statin regimens; (3) the fact that baseline LDL-C levels in the comparison studies were not low enough to test whether statin therapy reduces risk significantly in groups with an initial low LDL-C; and, most important, (4) authors of the five studies compared doses at the extremes of statin regimens. However, the clinical choice is not between the lowest and the greatest dose of a statin statin regimens, for example, between 10 and 80 mg atorvastatin, but, more realistically, between intermediate and high dose, that is, between 40 and 80 mg atorvastatin. On the basis of the CTT meta-analysis, we calculate that any potential gain from increasing the dose from 40 to 80 mg atorvastatin would be very small, at best a further 2% further reduction in clinical events. The increase in dose, unfortunately, would likely be associated with increased side effects and decreased compliance. Accordingly, whether net benefit would be demonstrable cannot be assumed. It follows that definitive evidence supporting maximal lowering of LDL-C or maximal dose of statins is still lacking and guidelines, if they are to be evidence-based, should acknowledge this uncertainty.", 
    "124": "Recently, statins have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects on lung inflammatory diseases. However, the mechanisms of action of simvastatin in viral pneumonia have yet to be elucidated, although viral infection remains a considerable health threat. In this study, we hypothesised that simvastatin inhibits polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C)-induced airway inflammation, such as RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted) expression and inflammatory cell recruitment. In bronchial cells, the effect of simvastatin on poly I:C-induced RANTES expression and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3-mediated signal transduction was determined using an ELISA and short hairpin (sh)RNA system. In a poly I:C-induced pneumonia mouse model, immunological changes in the lungs after simvastatin inhalation, such as inflammatory cell recruitment and cytokine/chemokine release, were examined. In poly I:C-stimulated bronchial cells, RANTES secretion was increased by STAT3 activation, and simvastatin suppressed poly I:C-induced STAT3 activation, resulting in inhibition of RANTES expression. In BALB/c mice stimulated with inhaled poly I:C, RANTES expression and neutrophil infiltration into the airway were elevated. However, simvastatin treatment attenuated STAT3 activation, RANTES release and subsequent neutrophilia in the lungs. These findings suggest that simvastatin inhibits airway inflammation, but there are other mechanisms that need to be fully elucidated.",

    "130": "High concentration of glycerol was used as the sole carbon source for efficient production of Monacolin K (MK) by solid-state fermentation (SSF) of Monascus purpureus 9901 using agricultural residue (bagasse), as an inert carrier. A comparative study showed that MK production in SSF was about 5.5 times higher than that of submerged fermentation when 26\u00a0% of glycerol was used, which may be due to the formation of glycerol concentration gradients in the inert carrier and less catabolite repression in SSF. For enhancement of MK yield in SSF, the effects of different influential variables, such as glycerol concentration, nitrogen source and its concentration, initial moisture content, inoculum size and particle size of bagasse, were systematically examined. All the factors mentioned above had an effect on the MK production in SSF to some extent. The maximal yield of MK (12.9\u00a0mg/g) was achieved with 26\u00a0% glycerol, 5\u00a0% soybean meal, 51\u00a0% initial moisture content, 20\u00a0% inoculum size and 1\u00a0mm particle size of bagasse.

    "131": "Hydroxy methyl glutaryl CoA inhibitors (statins) are the agents most frequently used to reduce elevated serum cholesterol. In addition to their cholesterol lowering effects, statins also have nonlipid lowering pleiotropic properties. These include reducing oxidative stress, renin-angiotensin and endothelin synthesis and activity, and improving nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and availability. Thus, one would predict that statins might be able to exert an antihypertensive effect. Experimental models bear out the blood pressure lowering effects but the data from clinical trials have been inconsistent perhaps due to inappropriate experimental designs, sample size, blood pressure measurement techniques etc. Moreover, although experimental models strongly suggest a role for salt intake in the potential antihypertensive responses to statins, available clinical trials fail to report salt intake in the studied populations. The statins' antihypertensive effects remain an unsettled hypothesis and calls for a large clinical trial at a wide range of doses and a controlled salt intake. Statins meanwhile remain as a excellent option to control high cholesterol and in tissue injury prevention.",

We propose a novel method that combines the therapeutic powers of the potassium channel opener pinacidil and the statin drug simvastatin. These two drugs do not share similar mechanisms of treating PH. We used rats with monocrotaline (MCT)-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) as a model and examined the combined effects of pinacidil and simvastatin on pulmonary vascular remodeling. A series of indicators, including those for pulmonary vascular obstruction, proliferation, and cell phenotype, pulmonary vascular matrix and pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype were used to monitor changes in pulmonary structure over the course of disease and treatment in normal controls, untreated PAH rats, pinacidil-treated subjects, simvastatin-treated subjects, and combination-treated subjects. We found that levels of mPAP, right ventricle Fulton index, pulmonary arteriolar wall thickness and muscularization, cell growth rate, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), lung tissue matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9 and lung tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) contractile protein SM-alpha-actin, and SM-alpha-actin mRNA of these different groups were all significantly lower in the combination-treated group than in the untreated group. Subjects in the combination-treated group also showed lower levels than those in either the pinacidil-treated or simvastatin-treated group. These results support our hypothesis and provide basis for a new, more effective therapeutic methods of treating PAH in human patients.",

In this study, we show that simvastatin dose-dependently inhibited serotonin-stimulated PASMCs proliferation. This was accompanied with the parallel induction of heme oxyganase-1 (HO-1) and upregulation of p21(WAF1). More importantly, we found that Tin-protoporphyrin (SnPP), a selective inhibitor of HO-1, could block the effect of simvastatin on inhibition of cell proliferation in response to serotonin and abolish simvastatin-induced p21(WAF1) expression. The inhibitive effect of simvastatin on cell proliferation was also significantly suppressed by silencing p21(WAF1) with siRNA transfection. The extent of effect of SnPP on inhibition of cell proliferation was similar to that of lack of p21(WAF1) by siRNA transfection. Taken together, our study suggests that simvastatin inhibits PASMCs proliferation by sequential upregulation of HO-1 and p21(WAF1) to benefit pulmonary hypertension.",

We therefore examined the association between statin use and risk of PD by conducting a detailed meta-analysis of all observational studies published regarding this subject. A literature search in the PubMed database was undertaken through April 2012, looking for observational studies evaluating the association between statin use and risk of PD. Combined relative risk (RR) estimates and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were also performed. A total of eight (five case-control and three cohort) studies contributed to the analysis. There was heterogeneity and publication bias among the studies. Statin use significantly reduced the risk of PD by 23 % (RR 0.77, 95 % CI 0.64-0.92, p = 0.005). However, long-term statin use did not significantly affect the risk of PD (RR 0.72, 95 % CI 0.45-1.13, p = 0.15).

In plasma, a soluble form of LRP1 (sLRP1) is the major transport protein for peripheral A\u03b2. LRP1 in brain endothelium and mural cells mediates A\u03b2 efflux from brain by providing a transport mechanism for A\u03b2 across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). sLRP1 maintains a plasma 'sink' activity for A\u03b2 through binding of peripheral A\u03b2 which in turn inhibits re-entry of free plasma A\u03b2 into the brain. LRP1 in the liver mediates systemic clearance of A\u03b2. In AD, LRP1 expression at the BBB is reduced and A\u03b2 binding to circulating sLRP1 is compromised by oxidation. Cell surface LRP1 and circulating sLRP1 represent druggable targets which can be therapeutically modified to restore the physiological mechanisms of brain A\u03b2 homeostasis. In this review, we discuss how increasing LRP1 expression at the BBB and liver with lifestyle changes, statins, plant-based active principles and/or gene therapy on one hand, and how replacing dysfunctional plasma sLRP1 on the other regulate A\u03b2 clearance from brain ultimately controlling the onset and/or progression of AD.",

The plant employs a biological nutrient removal (BNR) process for the treatment of municipal wastewater, and a single-stage mesophilic anaerobic co-digestion for the treatment of wasted activated sludge mixed with the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW), followed by a short-cut nitrification-denitrification of the anaerobic supernatant in a sequential batch reactor. Influent and effluent wastewater, as well as thickened, digested and treated sludge were sampled and analyzed for the selected pharmaceuticals in order to study their presence and fate during the treatment. Twenty three compounds were detected in influent and effluent wastewater and eleven in sludge. Infiltration of groundwater in the sewer system led to a dilution of raw sewage, resulting in lower concentrations in wastewater (up to 0.7 \u03bcg/L in influent) and sludge (70 ng/g d.w.). Due to the dilution, overall risk quotient for the mixture of pharmaceuticals detected in effluent wastewater was less than one, indicating no direct risk for the aquatic environment. A wide range of removal efficiencies during the treatment was observed, i.e. <20% to 90%. The influent concentrations of the target pharmaceuticals, as polar compounds, were undoubtedly mostly affected by BNR process in the wastewater train, and less by anaerobic-co-digestion. Mass balance calculations showed that less than 2% of the total mass load of the studied pharmaceuticals was removed by sorption. Experimentally estimated distribution coefficients (<500 L/kg) also indicated that the selected pharmaceuticals preferably remain in the aqueous phase, and that biodegradation/transformation is the primary removal mechanism for these compounds during wastewater treatment.",

    "222": "Statins were given to 64% vs. 87% (P <0.05), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) to 53% vs. 84% (P <0.05), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to 70% vs. 69% (P = 0.8) of the patients with DM and CAD, respectively. Screening tests to detect glucose abnormalities in patients with CAD or to detect CAD in patients with DM were not performed in 26% of patients with DM and 24% of those with CAD (P = 0.64). Mean systolic blood pressure was 136.8 \u00b1 13.6 vs. 131.7 \u00b1 15.8 mmHg (P = 0.001), diastolic blood pressure was 80.4 \u00b1 7.4 vs. 79.4 \u00b1 11.6 mmHg (P = 0.316), and total cholesterol was 196 \u00b1 42 vs. 183 \u00b1 42 mg/dl (P = 0.003) in patients with DM and CAD, respectively. The percentage of patients with blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg, total cholesterol below 175 mg/dl, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol below 100 mg/dl was 15% vs. 25% (P = 0.055), while the percentage of patients with blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg, total cholesterol below 175 mg/dl, and LDL cholesterol <70 mg/dl was 1% vs. 3% (P = 0.016) in the DM vs. CAD groups, respectively.", 
    "223": "Use of statins and ASA was more frequent in patients with CAD than in patients with DM. Control of risk factors in the study population was better in the CAD group but still unsatisfactory in most patients.", 
    "224": "Statins suppress expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in endothelial cells, whereas they enhance it in immune cells. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induce matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 gene expression in macrophages, which has been linked to progress of various inflammatory diseases. The aim of this study was to identify effects of various statins on LPS-induced MMP-9 gene expression in macrophages and microglia. MMP-9 expression was analyzed by real-time PCR or zymography. Effect of statins on activation of signaling pathways was analyzed by time-dependent phosphorylation of signaling molecules. Atorvastatin and simvastatin, but not pravastatin, up-regulated LPS-induced MMP-9 expression in murine RAW 264.7 macrophages and BV2 microglia. The phosphorylation duration of extracellular signal regulated kinases was extended by simvastatin, but not by atorvastatin or pravastatin. The up-regulation of LPS-induced MMP-9 gene expression by the statins was dependent on extracellular calcium ions and mediated by enhancing phosphorylation of cAMP-responsive element binding protein. Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, a precursor for cholesterol synthesis, could suppress up-regulation of LPS-mediated MMP-9 gene expression by atorvastatin and simvastatin. Atorvastatin and simvastatin-mediated up-regulation of LPS-induced MMP-9 gene expression in macrophages and microglia in vitro raises an important concern about use of the widely-prescribed statins in certain inflammatory conditions that are mediated by LPS.",

    "226": "Endogenous thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and total nitrite/nitrate (NO(2)/NO(3)) levels as well as non-enzymatic glutathione (GSH) and enzymatic antioxidants [glutathione-S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and catalase (CAT) activities] were determined in the livers of young (3 months), aged (22 months), \u03b1-tocopherol- or simvastatin-treated aged rats. Serum lipid profile and liver function parameters were also assessed in these 4 groups.", 
    "227": "Both \u03b1-tocopherol and simvastatin almost equally restored the age-induced changes in liver TBARS and CAT activity, serum aspartate aminotransferase (GOT), alanine aminotransferase (GPT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). \u03b1-Tocopherol, but not simvastatin, tended to restore GST and GPX activities in livers of aged rats. Simvastatin, on the other hand, counteracted age-induced increases in serum cholesterol, TG, LDL, total hepatic NO(2)/NO(3) level, and preserved a normal liver function during aging.", 
    "228": "Thus, either drug may be beneficial, in spite of a mechanistic difference in the antioxidant effect of both of them, in alleviating age-induced liver injury.", 
    "229": "A novel use of external lubrication has been investigated in which magnesium stearate was applied directly to the roll surface during roller compaction. A scalable parameter; travelling roll distance per shot (D(pS)), has been defined which ensures that an equal amount of magnesium stearate is applied to the roll surface per rotation at any roll speed. It was found that a formulation containing 20% w/w of either the API Pravastatin or Ibipinabant required a smaller D(pS) than a placebo formulation in order to prevent roll adherence. The inherent adhesiveness, and hence the required amount of external magnesium stearate to prevent roll adhesion, will depend on the material properties of the formulation. The amount of magnesium stearate transferred from the roll surface to the ribbon was measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy and was found to be less than 0.01% w/w. This is a significant reduction in magnesium stearate compared to the normal manufacturing procedure of blending 0.25-2.0% w/w within the formulation.The advantage of external lubrication during roller compaction is the significant reduction in magnesium stearate from the formulation which could lead to the production of tablets with superior mechanical properties and faster dissolution times.",

Although successful outcomes have been reported for the mother, transplanted heart, and newborn, such pregnancies should be considered high risk. Hypertension, preeclampsia, and infection should be treated. Vaginal delivery is recommended unless cesarean section is obstetrically necessary. Most outcomes are live births, and long-term follow-up of children show most are healthy and developing well. Maternal survival, independent of pregnancy-related events, should be part of prepregnancy counseling.",

    "232": "In this study, we tested the hypothesis that chronic exposure to NP will aggravate AD-induced CKD through increasing generations of inflammation, ROS, and apoptosis that could be attenuated by rosuvastatin. Fifty male Wistar rats were equally divided into group 1 (control), group 2 (AD in fodder at a concentration of 0.25%), group 3 (NP: 2 mg/kg/day), group 4 (combined AD & NP), and group 5 (AD-NP\u2009+\u2009rosuvastatin: 20 mg/kg/day).

Histopathology scorings of renal-parenchymal and tubular damages were significantly higher in group 4 than in groups 1-3, but remarkably lower in group 5 compared with group 4 (all p\u2009<\u20090.01). Both gene and protein levels of inflammation, oxidative stress, ROS, and cellular apoptosis were remarkably higher in group 4 compared with groups 1-3, but lowered in group 5 than in group 4 (all p\u2009<\u20090.001). Conversely, both gene and protein levels of anti-oxidants, anti-inflammation and anti-apoptosis were markedly increased in group 5 compared with group 4 (all p\u2009<\u20090.001).",

    "235": "Organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) mediate the hepatic uptake of many drugs. Hepatic uptake is crucial for the therapeutic effect of pravastatin, a cholesterol-lowering drug and OATP1A/1B substrate. We aimed to gain empirical insight into the relationship between OATPs and pravastatin pharmacokinetics and toxicity. We therefore compared the distribution and toxicity of pravastatin in wild-type and Oatp1a/1b-null mice. Intestinal absorption of pravastatin was not affected by Oatp1a/1b absence, but systemic plasma exposure (AUC) increased up to 30-fold after oral bolus administration. This increased plasma exposure resulted from reduced hepatic uptake, as evident from 10 to 100-fold lower liver-to-plasma concentration ratios. However, the reductions in liver exposure were far smaller (<2-fold) than the increases in plasma exposure. Reduced pravastatin liver uptake in Oatp1a/1b-null mice was more obvious shortly after intravenous administration, with 8-fold lower biliary pravastatin excretion. Although mice chronically exposed to pravastatin for 60 days evinced little muscular toxicity, Oatp1a/1b-null mice displayed 10-fold higher plasma concentrations and 8-fold lower liver concentrations than wild-type mice. Thus, Oatp1a/1b transporters importantly control the hepatic uptake of pravastatin. Activity-reducing human OATP1B polymorphisms may therefore both reduce pravastatin therapeutic efficacy in the liver and increase systemic toxicity risks, thus compromising its therapeutic index in a two-edged way."
