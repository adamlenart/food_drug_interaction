Medical therapy with intense risk-factor modification and treatment with a statin, aspirin, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, should be used unless contraindicated. Surgical therapy has also changed with the introduction of minimally invasive, beating heart surgery. Percutaneous coronary intervention has perhaps changed the most radically with adjunctive therapy - glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, thienopyridines, and reliance on stent implantation. The future, with new distal protection devices and drug-coated stents, should continue to see increased numbers of patients who can benefit from percutaneous intervention.", 
    "1": "Three clinical trials have recently focused on the benefits of lipid-regulating therapy in populations with normocholesterolaemia and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. Two secondary prevention studies (Veterans Affairs HDL-Cholesterol Intervention Trial [VA-HIT] and Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention [BIP] trial) testified to the efficacy of fibrates in decreasing cardiovascular events, particularly in patients with coexisting risk factors, including hypertriglyceridaemia. The Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study (AFCAPS/TexCAPS) demonstrated that a statin could decrease acute coronary events in patients with isolated low HDL-cholesterol in a primary prevention setting. The absolute risk reduction in coronary events in the VA-HIT study compares favourably with those reported from the statin-based Cholesterol and Recurrent Events (CARE) and Long-term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease (LIPID) trials. The absolute risk reduction in AFCAPS-TexCAPS is similar to that in West of Scotland Coronary Pravastatin Study (WOSCOPS). Recommendations are given concerning lifestyle and pharmacological management of low HDL-cholesterol. Optimal management also requires review of current treatment targets for HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides levels.", 
    "2": "The importance of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) control in the management of patients at high risk of cardiovascular events is unquestionable. The major statin trials have shown that the benefits of LDL lowering extend throughout the range of risk and the range of serum cholesterol, and have indicated that the protective effects of the intervention are mostly related to the baseline risk. Statin therapy is, for this reason, currently seen as an anti-atherogenic approach for the majority of high risk individuals and possibly all coronary heart disease patients. This debate is not about the value of statin therapy or the importance of LDL reduction, but about the goals to be set once we decide that LDL cholesterol must be reduced. With the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) guidelines representing a solid middle ground, the two viewpoints in this debate try to argue, on one hand, that the LDL goals should be substantially lower than our current standards or, on the other, that a specific on-treatment LDL value may not be the most important goal to pursue. We defend the latter position by presenting the case that the most effective LDL intervention in high risk patients is to achieve a reduction of at least 30%. This strategy complies with the NCEP guidelines, as most of the high risk patients treated with an average dose of an average statin would experience a 30-40% LDL reduction that would put on-treatment LDL levels safely below goal. Our position differs from both the guidelines and the proponents of more aggressive LDL goals in the management of the two extremes of the cholesterol distribution, where our lack of interest in a predefined on-treatment LDL concentration would make us more aggressive than guidelines on low baseline LDL patients and less aggressive than guidelines on high baseline LDL patients.", 
    "3": "We examined how lesional composition is related to the stability of coronary plaques. WHHL rabbits (12 months old) were given pravastatin and fluvastatin orally for 52 weeks. Both statins decreased plasma cholesterol levels by about 25%, but the suppressive effects on the degree of coronary plaques were mild. Macrophage (Mphi) contents in fibromuscular cap regions were decreased by pravastatin, and smooth muscle cell (SMC) contents in those were decreased by fluvastatin. The plaque vulnerability index was low in Mphi)-poor plaques, but high in SMC-poor plaques. Our results suggest that reduction in M(phi)s in the fibromuscular cap is related to plaque stabilization and that reduction in SMCs in the fibromuscular cap is related to plaque destabilization.", 
    "4": "Two in vitro and one in vivo assay were performed to study the endothelial pleiotropic actions of \"tissue type\" angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) such as perindopril and quinapril, their active forms, that is, quinaprilat and peridoprilat, or of statins belonging to natural (lovastatin), semisynthetic (simvastatin), and synthetic enantiomeric (atorvastatin, cerivastatin) classes. Cytoplasmic [Ca2+]i levels in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells and endothelium-dependent nitric oxide-mediated coronary vasodilatation in the Langendorff preparation of guinea pig heart constituted our in vitro assays. The in vivo assay consisted of study of PGI2-mediated thrombolytic response in arterial blood of rats after intravenous administration of drugs. In this last assay, perindopril and quinapril proved to be, by two orders of magnitude, more potent PGI2-dependent thrombolytics than the most potent statin (atorvastatin). However, in both in vitro assays we found a higher endothelial efficacy of statins as compared to ACE-Is. In particular, those statins that contain the lactone ring in their molecules (lovastatin, simvastatin) were the most potent coronary vasodilators. In summary, the in vivo profile of action of ACE-Is and statins contrasted with their reversed order of potency in vitro. We hypothesize that the endocrine-like function of the pulmonary circulation [28-31] may be responsible for the in vivo bradykinin-triggered, PGI2-mediated thrombolysis by ACE-Is, whereas the pleiotropic action of statins, possibly involving inhibition of prenylation [14-19], is diffused throughout many vascular beds.", 
    "5": "Compelling evidence from meta-analysis of a number of clinical studies on a large aggregate of patients has established an increased level of triglycerides as an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic heart disease. The finding of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in human atheromata has provided substantial pathophysiologic evidence for a direct role in atherogenesis. Hypertriglyceridemia is commonly embedded in the context of a metabolic syndrome that includes central obesity, insulin resistance, low levels of HDL cholesterol, and often hypertension. Hypertriglyceridemia also appears to underlie the phenomenon of small dense LDL in most instances. Therapeutic interventions must be directed at underlying obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes when present, as well as addressing metabolic determinants of dyslipidemia per se. Diet, exercise, weight loss, and avoidance of alcohol are the cornerstones of treatment. The choice of medication should be based on the lipoprotein phenotype. Niacin, fibric acid derivatives, and omega-3 fatty acids are most useful in treating severe hypertriglyceridemia. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are useful in some phenotypes with moderately increased triglyceride levels. Evidence from a number of clinical trials indicates that mitigation of risk of coronary heart disease, and possibly stroke, can be effected by reducing levels of plasma triglycerides.", 
    "6": "A 67-year-old man treated with gemfibrozil for a year development rhabdomyolysis and anuric renal failure after addition of cerivastatin. The clinical features and serological studies ruled out other causes of rhabdomyolysis. Drugs were stopped and hemodialysis was carried on for 14 days until diuresis occurred. The renal function improved steadily to a serum creatinine of 1.2 mg/dl two months later. On the basis of its pharmacokinetic profile cerivastatin appears to have less interactions than other statins. There are only two reports of rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure due to fibrates and cerivastatin combination. This patient shows the potential risk of a fibrates-cerivastatin combination. When this association is required it is necessary to avoid other nephrotoxic and myopathic factors and to monitor CK levels closely.", 
    "7": "The effects of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, simvastatin (statin, 60 mg/Kg/24 h by forced feeding), were studied on the development of hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy and oxidating stress induced by chronic perfusion of angiotensin II (ANG II, 200 ng/Kg/min s.c., for 10 days) in the rat. The statin was giver 24 hours before, and during the 10 days of ANG II. At the end of the study, mean blood pressure was measured and blood sampling performed under anaesthesia (sodium pentobarbital). The cardiac mass index was measured (cardiac mass/body weight, mg/Kg). TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances), representing the index of lipid peroxidation, was assessed by fluorimetry. The statin attenuated the development of hypertension (131 +/- 9 vs 164 +/- 4 mmHg) and the increase in cardiac mass (3.13 +/- 0.09 vs 3.46 +/- 0.09 mg/g) associated with ANG II. The overproduction of TBARS induced by ANG II was partially prevented by simvastatin (598 +/- 40 vs 794 +/- 79 pmol/mL). These results indicate that simvastatin attenuates the cardiovascular effects and lipid peroxidation induced by chronic administration of angiotensin II.", 
    "8": "The evidence that lipid disorders in patients following renal transplantation play a major role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and chronic renal allograft rejection is circumstantial. The high rate of clinical vascular disease and cardiovascular complications in renal transplant recipients, the high prevalence of an atherogenic dyslipidemia and the evidence from the statin regression trials in the general population suggest that lipid lowering treatment is beneficial in patients after renal transplantation. In addition, animal models and observational studies in patients have demonstrated correlations between plasma lipid levels and both acute and chronic rejection. Animal transplant models and clinical trials in heart transplant patients also suggest that statin treatment decreases the incidence of chronic rejection. However, the mechanisms behind this protective effect remain unsolved and no conclusive data exist proving that statins directly inhibit the development of chronic rejection. However, sufficient evidence exists to consider the use of these agents in the posttransplant setting for their possible effects on cardiovascular complications.", 
    "9": "High levels of plasma lipids have been recognized as a major risk factor in the development and progression of atherosclerosis, and to influence hemorheological factors that may predispose to thrombotic complications. Lipid-lowering interventions have been associated with a significant reduction of morbidity and mortality. Several mechanisms have been postulated for the observed clinical effect. Serum lipid-regulating therapies may reduce cardiovascular risk not only by altering the arterial wall, improving disturbed endothelial function, atherogenesis and plaque stability, but also through their antithrombogenic effects and influence on blood flow properties associated with hyperlipidemia. In this article, we will review the recent literature and discuss the value of hemorheological-hemostatic findings as surrogate endpoints for clinical trials in dyslipidemic patients.", 
    "10": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the most common complication of diabetes. Recent guidelines in the USA have underlined the importance of treating lipid abnormalities in people with diabetes in order to reduce the risk of this complication. Should lifestyle approaches not be sufficient drugs will need to be added. The two most common classes of drugs to correct lipoprotein abnormalities are the statins and the fibrates. Each has a role to play and their use depends on the nature of the lipid abnormality that is present. Thus, rather than considering their use as an 'either/or' situation, this review will consider the uses of each class. In addition, as correcting the lipoprotein abnormalities may not account for all of the benefit produced by these agents, their non-lipid, pleotropic effects that may be antiatherogenic will also be reviewed.", 
    "11": "One-fifth of all humans who have survived beyond the age of 65 are alive today, and in the industrialized world the elderly segment of the population is expanding most rapidly. In biological terms, these survivors are healthier than the elderly of previous generations. However 'there are no diseases peculiar to old age and very few from which it is exempt' (Alfred Worcester, 1855-1951), and so society will inevitably accumulate a significant share of degenerative diseases within the ranks of its senior citizens. In the last two decades, the prevalence of stroke, diabetes mellitus, arthritis and heart disease has increased significantly as a tangible index of ageing in the population, and these diseases have been accompanied by degenerating cognitive function and physical disability, both of which are adding increasing stress to community healthcare and social services. Policy-makers need to understand and monitor these trends in order to make informed and cogent decisions about the management of this growing problem. This review highlights some of the key health issues facing the elderly in regard to coronary artery disease, insulin resistance, redox status, and statin therapy, in the hope that enlightened debate will inform decision making on resource allocation for this important and growing segment of society.", 
    "12": "A detailed kinetic analysis of the recombinant soluble enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGR) from Trypanosoma cruzi has been performed. The enzyme catalyzes the normal anabolic reaction and the reductant is NADPH. It also catalyzes the oxidation of mevalonate but at a lower proportion compared to the anabolic reaction. We report that the catalytically active species of HMGR in solution is the tetrameric form. Fluvastatin inhibited competitively the enzyme while cerivastatin binds by a mechanism which is more accurately described by a biphasic process characteristic of a class of 'slow, tight-binding' inhibitors.",

    "14": "Participating centers will include 50 patients with normal to mildly elevated cholesterol levels eligible for balloon angioplasty and/or stent placement of the common iliac artery. Patients will be randomized to 1-year treatment with either low-dose (10 mg) or high-dose (80 mg) atorvastatin. The morphological effects of atorvastatin will be studied using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS); the effect of atorvastatin on both plaque volume and vascular remodeling seen at 1-year follow-up will be investigated. The functional cardiovascular effects of atorvastatin will be studied using dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE); the effect of atorvastatin on myocardial coronary flow reserve at 6-months and 1-year follow-up will be investigated. The aims of the present study are noteworthy in respect that (1) IVUS is the only available technique to sensitively measure the effect of atorvastatin on both intimal hyperplasia and vascular remodeling, and (2) DSE is a non-invasive test to objectively quantify the effect of atorvastatin on the functionality of the coronary artery.", 
    "15": "To determine whether cerivastatin, a newly developed novel synthetic potent statin, exerts a renoprotective effect, we assessed urinary albumin excretion (UAE) and plasma and urinary endothelin (ET)-1 concentrations in normotensive microalbuminuric type 2 diabetes patients with dyslipidemia.", 
    "16": "Sixty normotensive type 2 diabetic patients (38 men and 22 women; mean age 56.5 years) with microalbuminuria (20-200 microg/min) and dyslipidemia (total cholesterol >200 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol >160 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol <35 mg/dl, and triglyceride >150 mg/dl) were enrolled in a double-blind study for 6 months, receiving either cerivastatin (0.15 mg/day) or placebo. Plasma and urinary ET-1 concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay.", 
    "17": "Cerivastatin did not affect serum creatinine and HbA(1c) levels, and reduced systolic blood pressure slightly, but not significantly. Plasma levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were significantly reduced (p < 0.01), and plasma triglyceride levels were also reduced significantly (p < 0.05) after 6 months of cerivastatin treatment. A concomitant significant decrease in UAE (p < 0.01), and urinary and plasma ET-1 concentrations (p < 0.01) were found during this period.",

    "19": "Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) grown in primary culture are converted from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype. This includes a marked morphological reorganization, with loss of myofilaments and formation of a large ER-Golgi complex. In addition, the number of cell surface caveolae is distinctly reduced and the handling of lipoprotein-derived cholesterol changed. Here we used filipin as a marker to study the distribution of cholesterol in SMCs by electron microscopy. In contractile cells, filipin-sterol complexes were preferentially found in caveolae and adjacent ER cisternae (present in both leaflets of the membranes). After exposure to LDL or cholesterol, labeling with filipin was increased both in membrane organelles and in the cytoplasm. In contrast, treatment with mevinolin (a cholesterol synthesis inhibitor) or beta-cyclodextrin (a molecule that extracts cholesterol from cells) decreased the reaction with filipin but did not affect the close relation between the ER and the cell surface. In synthetic cells, filipin-sterol complexes were diffusely spread in the plasma membrane and the strongest cytoplasmic reaction was noted in endosomes/lysosomes, both under normal conditions and after incubation with LDL or cholesterol. On the basis of the present findings, we propose a mechanism for direct exchange of cholesterol between the plasma membrane and the ER and more active in contractile than in synthetic SMCs.", 
    "20": "Dyslipidemias are common after renal transplantation. Most common are elevations in total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Causes of dyslipidemia are usually multiple, but include immunosuppression (especially prednisone, cyclosporine and sirolimus), graft dysfunction (reduced glomerular filtration rate and proteinuria), and genetic predisposition. There is a growing amount of evidence suggesting that dyslipidemias contribute to the very high incidence of cardiovascular disease after transplantation. Less well established is whether the associations between dyslipidemias and graft dysfunction are due to a causal role of lipid abnormalities on renal injury. In any case, hypercholesterolemia, and especially increases in low density lipoprotein cholesterol, should be treated using guidelines established for patients in the general population.", 
    "21": "Chronic renal failure patients suffer from a secondary form of complex dyslipidemia, similar to the so-called atherogenic dyslipidemia in insulin resistant patients or to diabetic dyslipidemia. The most important abnormalities are an increase in the serum level of triglyceride (elevated VLDL-remnants/IDL), small LDL particles and a low HDL cholesterol. The highly atherogenic LDL subclass, namely LDL-6 or small dense LDL, accumulates in hypertriglyceridemic diabetic hemodialysis patients. All these lipoprotein particles contain apoB, thus much of this complex disorder can be summarized as an elevation of triglyceride-rich apoB containing complex lipoprotein particles. Growing evidence suggests that all of the components of this type of dyslipidemia are independently atherogenic. Further disturbances exist in the dynamics of cholesterol exchange between the various lipoprotein particles and in transport from cells to catabolic sites. The European Joint Task Force and the US National Cholesterol Education Program expert panel have issued guidelines for the general population to lower the cardiovascular risk in hyper- and dyslipidemias. There is preliminary consensus that these guidelines should be applied to dialysis patients. However, the genesis of atherosclerosis in the dialysis population may be different and real benefit from lipid-lowering has not yet been demonstrated in this population. Large-scale, prospective randomized trials (4D-trial, HARP) are underway to determine whether statins reduce cardiovascular complications in diabetic and non-diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and on hemodialysis treatment.", 
    "22": "Hyperlipidaemia complicating the nephrotic syndrome is characterised by elevated levels of total and LDL cholesterol, often with hypertriglyceridaemia and low HDL cholesterol levels. The underlying mechanisms are complex but involve abnormalities of both lipoprotein synthesis and catabolism. Experience to date suggests that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors or \"statins\" offer the most effective therapy and are relatively safe, at least in short term studies. The benefits of treatment remain unproven but may include a reduction in cardiovascular risk and preservation of residual renal function. Newly defined actions of statins, some of which may be unrelated to lipid lowering, are likely to extend the application of these drugs in patients with glomerular disease.",

Patients in the pravastatin group achieved significant reductions of 18.8 and 21.4% in total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, respectively (p < 0.05). Among patients treated with a combination of continuous combined hormone replacement therapy plus pravastatin, levels of total cholesterol (20.5%) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (23.8%) decreased the most, while levels of triglycerides (2.1%) decreased lower than the pravastatin-only group.

In the current study, we investigated the effect of lipophilic and hydrophilic statins (fluvastatin and pravastatin) on apoptosis in unstimulated or cytokine-stimulated VSMCs. The presence of apoptosis in rat VSMCs was evaluated by electrophoresis of DNA fragments and 4'6'-diamidine-2'-phenylindole staining and quantified by flow cytometry. Fluvastatin but not pravastatin enhanced apoptosis in interleukin-1beta-stimulated VSMCs. The proapoptotic effect of fluvastatin was fully reversed by mevalonate and geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate, and partially by farnesyl-pyrophosphate, but not by squalene. Inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK1/2) pathway significantly increased fluvastatin-enhanced apoptosis, whereas inhibition of the p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway significantly prevented this increase. However, fluvastatin showed no effect on the activity of ERK1/2 and p38-MAPK. Furthermore, fluvastatin-induced apoptosis was inhibited by YVAD-FMK (a caspase-1/interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme-like protease inhibitor) and DEVD-FMK (a caspase-3/CPP32 inhibitor), indicating involvement of an important segment in the apoptosis signaling pathway. These findings suggest that fluvastatin enhances apoptosis in cytokine-stimulated VSMCs and that protein prenylation, MAPK (ERK1/2 and p38-MAPK), and caspases are critically involved in the pathways of fluvastatin-enhanced apoptosis.",

    "49": "Ras-related proteins are small GTPases that are post-translationally modified with mevalonate-derived isoprenoids. Although the effects of inhibition of isoprenylation on protein function have been examined, the consequences of depletion of isoprenoid pools on regulation of expression of isoprenylated proteins have yet to be investigated. In these studies we have shown that depletion of mevalonate results in increased total levels of Ras, Rap1a, RhoA, and RhoB in K562 cells. Cycloheximide and [(35)S]methionine pulse/pulse-chase experiments reveal that mevalonate depletion increases the de novo synthesis of Ras and RhoA and decreases the degradation of existing Ras and RhoA protein. Pretreatment with actinomycin D completely prevents the induced up-regulation of RhoB and only partially prevents the up-regulation of Ras, Rap1a, and RhoA. Although depletion of mevalonate does not alter steady state levels of Ras mRNA, there is an increase in RhoB mRNA. Our results are the first to demonstrate that mevalonate depletion induces up-regulation of Ras and Ras-related proteins by discrete mechanisms that include modulation of transcriptional, translational, and post-translational processes.", 
    "50": "Statin therapy has been remarkably successful in reducing coronary events and improving survival. Reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is the paramount mechanism for the benefit of statins. Although the relation between reduction of risk of coronary artery disease and pretreatment lipid levels has not been fully resolved, a feature of statin therapy emerging from previous large-scale trials is the diminished benefit when the baseline level of LDL-C is low (eg, <125 mg/dL). Increases in levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) with statin therapy are associated with mild reductions in coronary events, indicating that HDL-C is an important element. However, the risk of low HDL-C is not altered by statin therapy, in marked contrast with LDL-C. Because most coronary events have not been prevented in the statin trials, nonstatin lipid therapy, including fibrates, may be necessary to further reduce the unacceptably high rate of coronary artery disease.", 
    "51": "The Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study (AFCAPS/TexCAPS) is the first coronary heart disease (CHD) primary prevention trial of the cholesterol-reducing agents called \"statins\" to include women. For 5608 men and 997 postmenopausal women without clinical evidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) who had average low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and below average high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), 20-40 mg/day lovastatin reduced first acute major coronary events (AMCEs) 37% (for those receiving placebo and lovastatin, respectively, 183 and 116 first AMCEs defined as fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI], unstable angina, or sudden cardiac death; relative risk [RR] 0.63; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.50, 0.79; p < 0.001). Statistically significant reductions in prespecified secondary end points (coronary revascularizations, unstable angina, MI, cardiovascular end point events, and coronary end point events) were also associated with lovastatin treatment in the overall cohort. This paper provides results in women, a prespecified subgroup. Among women, 20-40 mg/day lovastatin reduced LDL-C 25% and increased HDLC 9% (p < 0.001). A prespecified analysis revealed consistency with the overall results regardless of gender (i.e., there were no statistical differences between men and women in risk reduction for first AMCEs with lovastatin). However, the number of women who had an AMCE was small, and there was insufficient power to detect a treatment group difference among women (7 of 499 vs. 13 of 498 first AMCEs in those receiving lovastatin and placebo, respectively; RR 0.54; 95% CI 0.22, 1.35; p = 0.183). Numerical reductions in all prespecified secondary end points were observed for women treated with lovastatin, but again, the numbers of events were small and the differences were not statistically significant. Chronic long-term treatment with lovastatin was well tolerated, with no treatment group differences in the frequency of cancer, muscle symptoms, and clinically important liver enzyme elevations. In AFCAPS/TexCAPS, a consistent pattern of numerical reductions in all prespecified primary and secondary cardiovascular end points was observed in women treated with lovastatin for primary prevention of CHD. However, because of the small number of events, there was insufficient power to detect significant treatment group differences. Lovastatin treatment was associated with statistically significant decreases in LDL-C and increases in HDL-C, and chronic long-term treatment with 20-40 mg/day lovastatin was well tolerated in women.",

Outcomes in several diseases that have predictable circadian variations (e.g., arthritis, asthma, allergies, pepticulcer disease, dyslipidemia, cancer) have been improved by matching the timing of medication use to the circadian rhythm of the illness. Results of the ongoing CONVINCE study may provide evidence that chronotherapy for hypertension and angina pectoris may be more effective than traditional homeostatic treatment.", 
    "53": "1. The results of several clinical studies investigating the effect of statin therapy on the fibrinolytic system in vivo are inconclusive. We compared the effect of six different statins (atorvastatin, cerivastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin) on components of the fibrinolytic system expressed by human vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells and by the human hepatoma cell line HepG2. 2. All statins used except pravastatin significantly decreased PAI-1 production in human endothelial and smooth muscle cells. This effect was also seen in the presence of IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha. All statins except pravastatin increased t-PA production in human smooth muscle cells. On a molar basis cerivastatin was the most effective HMG CoA reductase inhibitor used. Only simvastatin and lovastatin increased t-PA production in endothelial cells. The effects on the fibrinolytic system were reversed by mevalonate. Statins decreased mRNA levels for PAI-1 in endothelial and smooth muscle cells and increased mRNA levels for t-PA in smooth muscle cells. Statins did not affect PAI-1 expression in HepG2 cells. Cell viability was not influenced by statins in endothelial cells and HepG2 cells whereas in smooth muscle cells a cytotoxic effect was seen at high concentrations. 3. If the effects on the fibrinolytic system of vascular cells in vitro shown in this study are also operative in vivo one could speculate that by increasing t-PA and decreasing PAI-1 at sites of vascular lesions statins might reduce fibrin formation and thrombus development. Such an effect might contribute to the clinically proven benefits of statin therapy.",

The utilization pattern is compared to the results of a systematic review of randomized controlled trials on their effectiveness. The study found that 74.7% of individuals prescribed a statin had no reported history of coronary heart disease (CHD). Women without CHD formed 23.1% of statins recipients; 32.9% of individuals filling a statin prescription were age 70 and over. Only 15.3% of men with CHD had been prescribed a statin. Based on the systematic review, 88.7% of the utilization of statins in this Canadian province was not supported by the results of the systematic review. Considering baseline lipid-levels does not substantially alter these findings. This study concludes that statins prescribing practices need to be realigned with research evidence.

A 14% reduction in mean cholesterol was achieved by dietary modification, and three patients merited statin treatment. Obesity is a major problem in our population and 15 of the patients had grade I obesity with a mean BMI of 30.6; five of these gained a further 4.5 kg.

Lipoprotein levels were measured at admission, at 6 hours, the morning after admission, before discharge, and 3 months after discharge in patients with myocardial infarction and unstable angina. Patients with myocardial infarction on thrombolytic therapy (n = 63) and patients with unstable angina (n = 33) had a decrease in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels < or = 24 hours after admission (-12 +/- 20% and -6 +/- 23%, respectively), but these levels returned to baseline before discharge. In patients with myocardial infarction who did not receive thrombolytic therapy (n = 37), the decrease was more gradual and peaked before hospital discharge (-7 +/- 19%). There was good correlation between LDL cholesterol levels at admission and after discharge, especially in normotriglyceridemic patients. Over 90% of patients with LDL cholesterol > or = 125 mg/dl on the morning after admission were candidates for statin therapy after discharge. Thus, the need for future statin therapy can be predicted with fair reliability during the initial 24 hours after admission. However, elevated baseline triglyceride levels significantly affect these LDL cholesterol changes and complicate prediction of long-term lipoprotein levels.", 
    "77": "Statin therapy reduces clinical events in patients with stable coronary artery disease. Recent data indicate that the beneficial effects of statin therapy may also extend to patients experiencing an acute ischemic coronary event. However, the potential role of statins to further modify clinical outcome in patients undergoing coronary stent implantation has not been addressed. Therefore, we investigated whether the initiation of statin therapy immediately after successful coronary stent implantation improves short-term clinical outcome in 704 patients (335 patients with stable angina pectoris [AP], 224 patients with unstable AP, and 145 patients with Q-wave acute myocardial infarction [AMI]). Compared with the lowest risk group (patients with stable AP receiving statin therapy), patients with unstable AP (RR 6.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5 to 31, p = 0.004) and patients with Q-wave AMI (RR 7.6, 95% CI 1.5 to 37, p = 0.004) experienced an increased risk for the occurrence of the primary combined end point of cardiac death and AMI. Importantly, initiation of statin therapy abrogated the increased risk in patients with unstable AP to the level of patients with stable AP receiving statin therapy (RR 1.5, 95% CI 0.2 to 11, p = 0.7). In contrast, statin therapy did not affect the RR in patients with Q-wave AMI during 6-month follow-up (RR 7.9, 95% CI 1.6 to 39 vs RR 7.6, 95% CI 1.5 to 37, p = NS). The beneficial effects of statin therapy after successful coronary stent implantation in unstable AP were most prominent during the first 4 weeks after the ischemic episode. Statins appear to contribute to the rapid transformation of unstable coronary artery disease into a stable condition with a very low event rate over the forthcoming 6 months in patients with unstable AP undergoing successful coronary stent implantation.", 
    "78": "Overexpression of cyclin B has been detected in various human breast cancer cell lines, breast tumor tissues, and immortalized but nontransformed breast cells. The cause of this overexpression has not been thoroughly investigated, nor is it known if cyclin B protein forms a functional complex with its partner, cdk1, at inappropriate cell cycle periods. In this study we examined the pattern of cyclin B1 promoter activity in three breast cancer cell lines, BT-549, MDA-MB-157, T-47D, and the immortalized breast cell line MCF-10F. Using cells stably transfected with a cyclin B1 promoter-luciferase reporter, luciferase activity was measured throughout the cell cycle in lovastatin synchronized cells and in G1 and S/G2 phases of asynchronized cells by flow cytometry. Results demonstrate that the cyclin B1 promoter activity increases, as expected, during the S/G2 period in all the cell lines. However, some promoter activity can be detected in G1 phase of the different cell line with BT-549 displaying the more altered pattern. Functional cyclin B1-cdk 1 protein complex was detected in G1 phase of BT-549 and T-47D cell lines. These results suggest that in a subset of transformed breast cancer cells altered cyclin B1 promoter activity may contribute to the misexpression of cyclin B protein.", 
    "79": "In this study, we used a coactivator-dependent receptor-ligand interaction assay (CARLA), which is a semifunctional in vitro assay, to determine whether hypolipidemic drugs are ligands for the three peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor isotypes (PPARalpha, delta, and gamma). We also evaluated the transcriptional activities of the three PPAR isotypes by transient transfection assays. We found that bezafibrate was a ligand for PPARalpha, delta, and gamma in the CARLA and that bezafibrate induced transcriptional activation of PPARalpha/RXRalpha, PPARdelta/RXRalpha, and PPARgamma/RXRalpha. Although the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors cerivastatin, fluvastatin, and pitavastatin were not ligands for these three nuclear receptors in the CARLA, they induced transcriptional activation of PPARalpha/RXRalpha, PPARdelta/RXRalpha, and PPARgamma2/RXRalpha. Moreover, cerivastatin, fluvastatin, and pitavastatin synergistically and dose-dependently increased the transcriptional activation of PPARalpha/RXRalpha induced by bezafibrate. In addition, the cerivastatin-induced transcriptional activation of PPARalpha/RXRalpha was decreased by addition of mevalonate, farnesol, geranylgeraniol, or cholesterol and by co-transfection with sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1). Moreover, concomitant administration of statins and fibrates also decreased the transactivation of nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) and the activation of NFkappaB by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MEKK) also decreased the transactivation of PPARalpha/RXRalpha.",

    "84": "Chronic renal insufficiency is characterized by specific abnormalities in lipoprotein metabolism, affecting both apolipoprotein A (apo A)- and apo B-containing lipoproteins. To evaluate the effects of fluvastatin, a synthetic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, on renal dyslipoproteinemia, we performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-way, period cross-over study. Study patients were administered fluvastatin, 40 mg/d, or placebo during 8 weeks in randomized order. Forty-five nonnephrotic patients (28 men, 17 women) without diabetes with moderate to advanced chronic renal insufficiency participated in the study. Their mean age was 56.4 +/- 11.0 years. Glomerular filtration rate ranged from 12 to 44 mL/min/1.73 m2 of body surface area (mean, 27.5 +/- 10.5 mL/min/1.73 m2). Fluvastatin treatment resulted in significant reductions in the primary outcome variables low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C; -26%; P < 0.001), apo B (-21%; P < 0.001), and lipoprotein B complex (Lp-Bc) (-14%; P < 0.01). There were statistically significant differences between fluvastatin and placebo treatment for the secondary outcome variables total cholesterol (-19%), triglycerides (TGs; -13%), VLDL-C (-13%), apo E (-13%), and Lp-B (-22%). There was no treatment effect on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or lipoprotein(a). Fluvastatin treatment was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events during the study. In conclusion, fluvastatin treatment was well tolerated in patients with moderately advanced renal insufficiency and led to a significant reduction in cholesterol-rich, but to a lesser extent in TG-rich, apo B-containing lipoproteins. It remains to be clarified whether these positive changes in lipoprotein profile also will result in attenuation of the atherosclerotic process in these patients, as well as beneficially affect the progression of chronic renal failure.", 
    "85": "A recent debate has emerged as to the risk-benefit ratio of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins). This debate has centered on the withdrawal of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor cerivastatin (Baycol). Its withdrawal was prompted by an unacceptably high rate of rhabdomyolysis associated with its use. The development of rhabdomyolysis in cerivastatin-treated patients surprised few, since myotoxicity is a class effect with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. What has sprung from the cerivastatin experience, though, is the concept of \"guilt by association\"; thus, other members of this class are now viewed in a similarly negative light. Such misgivings are understandable, but to a degree may be ill-advised, since differences exist in the risk and therefore the rate of rhabdomyolysis occurrence among the various HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. In this regard, pravastatin and fluvastatin are least likely to provoke muscle cell damage, which, at least in part, relates to their not being metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3A4 pathway. When muscle damage does occur with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, it is commonly the result of drug-drug interactions rather than a specific adverse response to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor monotherapy. Such drug-drug interactions inevitably result in higher plasma concentrations of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and thereby an increased risk of myotoxicity. A growing consensus supports an expanded use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in elderly patients. Polypharmacy and altered drug metabolism both put the elderly patient at increased risk of myotoxicity when drugs in the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor class are administered. Physicians must take many factors into account when selecting a member of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor class, particularly as relates to their use in the multiply medicated elderly patient.",

New Zealand white rabbits were fed one of three diets, a reference diet with no cholesterol added (NC), a high cholesterol diet (1 g/100 g, HC) and a HC diet supplemented with 2 g/100 g hawthorn fruit powder (HC-H). After 12 wk, serum total cholesterol (TC) and triacylglycerols (TG) were 23.4 and 22.2% lower, respectively, in the hawthorn fruit group compared with the HC rabbits (P < 0.05). Hawthorn supplementation led to 50.6% less cholesterol accumulation in aorta (P < 0.05) and 23-95% greater excretion of neutral and acidic sterols (P < 0.05). Supplementation of hawthorn fruit did not affect the activities of hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA-R) or cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CH) but it suppressed the activity of intestinal acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT, P < 0.05).

Recently, statins have been shown to modulate several of the mechanisms of inflammation in atherosclerosis in vitro and in vivo, including reduction of inflammatory markers in clinical trials.

Although the benefits of statin treatment are well known from a myriad of clinical trials, the safety of these compounds has not been an issue since lovastatin was first introduced in 1987.

Where should our goal of therapy be? Until data is available from several large, ongoing trials, we do not have a final answer. We asked three investigators, Drs.

    "96": "Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is a rare disorder resulting in severe premature atherosclerosis. Drug therapy was previously viewed as inadequate for control of the dyslipidemia, so portacaval shunting, plasmapheresis, and liver transplantation were undertaken to treat this condition. Despite these drastic measures, additional cholesterol-lowering treatment may still be required. Furthermore, there is a need for pharmacologic control until additional measures can be undertaken. The statins, an evolving class of cholesterol-modifying drugs, represent a significant development in the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. The experience with statins in this condition is limited, but some insight into their utility has been gained from studies reviewed in this article. It is recommended that high doses of statins be used in combination with other lipid-modifying strategies for the best control of the dyslipidemia of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "97": "The effects of statins and other lipid drugs are assessed by their ability to affect specific lipid fractions. Although there has been a great deal written abut the statins, most recent papers have focused on the comparative effects of the statins on triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or have been concerned with the nonlipid effects of these drugs. In addition, some recent papers have focused on new parameters that may mediate cardiovascular risk, such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.", 
    "98": "Rosuvastatin is a synthetic enantiomer that is hepatoselective, relatively hydrophilic and has minimal metabolism via the cytochrome P450 3A4 system (similar to pravastatin). Rosuvastatin, like atorvastatin, has a plasma half-life of about 20 h and is a potent inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. The majority of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity in plasma is associated with the parent rosuvastatin compound. In a Phase II study, rosuvastatin across a dose range of 1- 80 mg lowered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 34 - 65%. Phase III trials have demonstrated greater reductions in LDL-C for rosuvastatin compared to atorvastatin as well as greater increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). The drug appears to be well tolerated at all doses up to 80 mg/day. A starting dose of 10 mg will reduce LDL-C by approximately 50%, which should adequately treat most patients to within the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) goals.", 
    "99": "Inflammation is a reaction to primary injury of various kinds, such as infection and trauma, which has both beneficial and detrimental effects. Inflammation has been associated with major diseases of the heart and vessels. Research has focused not only on ischaemia but also on post-ischaemic reperfusion, which is known to activate and amplify the inflammatory response. Although reperfusion should always be attempted in the clinical environment, it has been shown experimentally that it can cause some cardiac damage, in addition to that caused by ischaemia. Therefore, it is reasonable to attempt to increase the benefit obtainable with reperfusion by modulating inflammatory processes triggered by reperfusion itself. In this field, different potential therapeutic targets have been identified and interventions have been tested over the last 30 years. With the exception of adenosine, which probably does not act merely through inhibition of the inflammatory response, no other compounds have yet proven successful in clinical trials. Active research is ongoing. Broadening the approach from the heart to the cardiovascular system, promising data is emerging on cardiovascular protection conferred by statins in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and high levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a systemic marker of inflammation. Similarly, results of trials aimed at preventing cardiovascular events by eradicating chronic infections will be among the first to directly test whether such therapies will decrease risks of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "100": "An elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level is a strong predictor of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. Over the past seven years, equally strong evidence has accumulated that lowering LDL cholesterol with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors or statins reduces CHD risk and there is now widespread use of these agents for the primary and secondary prevention of CHD. Treatment issues remain regarding the appropriate degree of LDL cholesterol reduction and whether, in people with very high levels, it would be preferable to achieve the LDL cholesterol goal with a powerful statin alone or combined with an agent that lowers LDL cholesterol by a different mechanism. The main focus in the development of novel agents is the patient with low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, usually associated with hypertriglyceridaemia. Already prevalent as a risk factor for CHD, this abnormality has been linked with insulin resistance, which is likely to increase greatly over the next decade, along with increasing obesity and diabetes. Agents that have potent HDL cholesterol raising capacity include cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors, retinoid X receptor (RXR) selective agonists, specific peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists and oestrogen-like compounds. Another area of development involves agents that will lower both cholesterol and triglyceride levels, such as partial inhibitors of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) and perhaps squalene synthase inhibitors and agonists of AMP kinase. Future emphasis will be on correcting all lipid abnormalities for the prevention of CHD, not just lowering LDL cholesterol.", 
    "101": "The beneficial effect of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) in primary prevention of coronary artery disease in those with hypercholesterolaemia and in secondary prevention in those with established coronary vascular disease are now well known. A growing body of evidence suggests that statins also possess important additional clinical benefits, such as stroke risk reduction. In this article we review the evidence that statins may be neuroprotective, especially in the brain parenchyma during stroke. We also review the observational data that statins may prevent the onset of dementia.", 
    "102": "The development of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (the statins) has lead to important advances in the management of cardiovascular disease. There have several landmark mortality and morbidity clinical trials with the statins. The 4S (Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study) was the first large-scale randomised cholesterol-lowering trial to show a decrease in mortality. In patients with coronary heart disease and relatively high cholesterol, simvastatin decreased mortality, hospital stays, the risk of undergoing myocardial re-vascularisation, stroke and transient ischaemic attack. The CARE (Cholesterol and Recurrent Events) trial showed that lowering average cholesterol levels after myocardial infarction with pravastatin reduced a composite primary end point of coronary mortality and myocardial infarction, coronary bypass surgery, angioplasty and strokes. The LIPID (Long-term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaaemic Disease) study showed that lowering average cholesterol levels after previous myocardial infarction or unstable angina reduced mortality. WOSCOPS (The West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study) was the first trial to demonstrate the benefit of pravastatin, as primary prevention for cardiovascular disease, in men with high cholesterol levels. AFCAPS/Tex CAPS (The Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study) showed that the benefits of lowering cholesterol levels were also evident in healthy men and women who initially had average cholesterol levels. Rather surprisingly the reductions in mortality and morbidity with statins are only associated with small improvements in coronary angiographic findings. A preliminary study indicated than lovastatin prevented restenosis, but larger and better-controlled studies indicate that the statins do not have beneficial effects in restenosis. Effects other than lipid-lowering or as a consequence of their lipid-lowering may contribute to the beneficial effects of statins. These effects include improvement in vascular endothelial function, cardiac remodelling, changes in blood rheology, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-hypertensive actions.", 
    "103": "Mevastatin (3-10 microM) and fluvastatin (0.1-10 microM), but not pravastatin, were found to promote calcification of MC3T3-E1 cells and their subclone MC4, in either the presence or absence of 3 mM inorganic phosphate stimulus. The mechanism of action was examined. Gel retardation assay and immunocytochemical analysis of core binding factor (Cbfa1) revealed that mevastatin and fluvastatin completed the nuclear export of Cbfa1, possibly thereby reducing the induction of the stably transfected p6OSE2-luc gene, and then promoted Cbfa1-independent calcification, which invariably occurred in both wild type and dominant negative Cbfa1-expressing cells. The induction of the bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) gene promoter failed to respond to the statins. All the effects of the cell-permeable statins were negated by mevalonate pathway metabolites (geranylgeranylpyrophosphate > farnesylpyrophosphate > mevalonate) and reproduced by toxin B (a Rho-specific inhibitor), but not totally by Y27632 (a ROCK-specific inhibitor). The results suggest that lipophilic statins can be osteogenic by promoting Cbfa1- and BMP-2-independent calcification processes.", 
    "104": "Statins (cholesterol lowering drugs) with a closed-ring structure (lovastatin, simvastatin and mevastatin) and an open-ring structure (pravastatin and fluvastatin) are currently used in the management of cardiac disease. Lovastatin and simvastatin inhibit the growth of tumor cells; however, the studies on the effect of a statin in combination with micronutrients such as alpha-tocopheryl succinate (alpha-TS), 13-cis retinoic acid (RA) and polar carotenoids (PC) have never been performed. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the effect of mevastatin alone and in combination with the above micronutrients on the growth of mouse neuroblastoma (NB) cells and rat immortalized dopamine (DA) neurons in culture. In addition, a comparative efficacy of mevastatin and pravastatin on the growth of NB cells was studied.", 
    "105": "Cells were treated with mevastatin in combination with individual antioxidants, alpha-TS, RA and polar carotenoids, 24 hours after plating. Fresh growth medium and agents were changed at two days after treatment, and the viability in control and experimental groups was determined at three days after treatment by MTT assay. Each experiment was repeated three times with triplicate samples per treatment. Growth in experimental groups was expressed as % of untreated cells.", 
    "106": "Mevastatin inhibited the growth of neuroblastoma (NB) cells and immortalized, non-tumorigenic dopamine (DA) neurons in culture in a dose-dependent manner. Immortalized DA neurons were more sensitive to mevastatin than NB cells. Pravastatin at similar concentrations was ineffective in inhibiting the growth of NB cells. Mevastatin in combination with alpha-TS, RA or PC was more effective in reducing the growth of NB and DA neurons than the individual agents.", 
    "107": "Statins with a closed-ring structure can inhibit the growth of established cancer cells as well as immortalized cells (equivalent to pre-malignant lesion), whereas statins with an open-ring structure may be ineffective. A combination of a statin having a closed-ring structure with alpha-TS, RA and PC may be one of the potentially useful anti-cancer agents for prevention and treatment strategies.", 
    "108": "In the last decade, large-scale clinical trials have consistently shown that therapy with statins is of great benefit to patients with and at risk of developing coronary artery disease. We assessed, in a sample of patients with coronary artery disease in whom coronary angiography was indicated and hospitalized in the last 10 years, the use of statins at admission.", 
    "109": "One hundred patients with stable coronary artery disease were randomly selected per year from 1991 to 2000. The final study population consisted of 1000 patients. The prescription of statins for > or = 6 months before hospital admission was determined from a hospital-wide clinical database.", 
    "110": "From 1995, the prevalence of patients treated with statins at hospital admission progressively increased. In 1991, only 2% of patients were treated with statins before hospital admission while in the year 2000, 38% of patients were receiving this treatment. The mean prevalence of patients treated with statins before and after 1995 was 3 vs 22% (p < 0.0001) respectively. The distribution of the demographic and clinical parameters and the prevalence of conventional cardiovascular risk factors were similar in patients treated or not treated with statins.", 
    "111": "After 1994, in coincidence with the publication of the results of clinical trials showing the benefit of statins in patients with coronary artery disease, the use of these drugs increased significantly. This finding suggests that the widespread diffusion of the results of the major clinical trials and of guidelines drawn up by medical associations have had a significant impact on statin prescription in patients with coronary artery disease. Nevertheless our data also indicate that, despite overwhelming evidence on the benefits of statin therapy, in current clinical practice cardiologists are not optimally utilizing lipid management and that statins are frequently prescribed without an appropriate analysis of risk factors.", 
    "112": "From the initial stages of leukocyte recruitment to diseased endothelium, to eventual rupture of unstable atheromatous plaque, pro-inflammatory mechanisms mediate key steps in atherogenesis and its complications. Lipid lowering, both with diet and statin therapy, has been shown to have favorable effects on inflammatory processes in atheromatous plaque. Several plasma markers of inflammation have been found to predict future cardiovascular risk, both among patients with acute coronary syndromes and myocardial infarction, and among healthy men and women. C-reactive protein (CRP), a pattern recognition molecule linked to the innate immune system, is a sensitive marker of low-grade vascular inflammation, which may also have direct pro-inflammatory actions. Recent studies have shown that statin therapy may lower CRP levels independent of lipid-lowering effects. Statin therapy may also be highly effective for the prevention of cardiovascular events among individuals with elevated CRP levels. The role of statin therapy for plaque stabilization in acute coronary syndromes, and for prevention of future plaque rupture among healthy individuals with evidence of vascular inflammation, is an area of active research.", 
    "113": "In controlled trials, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) effectively reduced cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, recent pharmacoepidemiological studies indicate an underuse of statins in the target population. The objective of this study was to examine the extent to which CAD patients in Germany actually received statins under field conditions.", 
    "114": "We evaluated the medical records of 296 patients referred to the cardiology outpatient clinic of the Frankfurt University Hospital by their general practitioner (GP) in the period 1995 to 1998. All patients had symptomatic, angiographically proven CAD, 142 had previous myocardial infarction. A diagnosis of dyslipidemia was taken from the records. Most patients were visited on more than 1 occasion. In all, we were able to access 296 records for a 1st visit, 76 records for a 2nd visit and 29 records for a 3rd visit and 16 records for > 3 visits.", 
    "115": "According to the entry criteria of the 4S Trial (total cholesterol 5.5-8.0 mmol/l or 212-311 mg/dl), 108 patients were deemed as eligible for lipid-lowering treatment, criteria of the LIPID Trial (4.0-7.0 mmol/l or 154-270 mg/dl) gave a yield of 190 patients. The actual treatment rate with a statin at the 1st visit was 34% (LIPID Group) and 40% (4S Group). At later visits, the treatment rates with statins increased to 63% (LIPID Group) and 79% (4S Group), due to advice given to the GP by the outpatient clinic. When the observation period was devided into 2 periods (04/95 - 01/97; 02/97 - 09/98), actual treatment rates (all visits) for the 4S Group were 43% and 38%, respectively, indicating no further \"penetration\" of the 4S Study in the therapy decision-making of the GPs.", 
    "116": "The data indicate that necessary treatment with a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor is often withheld in the ambulatory setting.", 
    "117": "Treatment with low drug doses is generally recommended in the elderly. However, the efficacy of low dose 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitor treatment in elderly hypercholesterolemic patients has never been examined. Therefore, we compared the effect of low-dose with standard dose pravastatin, an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, on the incidence of cardiovascular events (CVEs) in elderly patients with hypercholesterolemia in a randomized prospective trial. Subjects aged > or = 60 years (73 +/- 6 years) with serum total cholesterol (TC) levels of 220-280 mg/dL were randomized to the low-dose (groupL, 5 mg/day; n=334) or standard dose (groupS, 10-20mg/day; n= 331). Baseline TC levels were similar in the 2 groups (253 +/-15 mg/dL). Patients were followed for 3-5 years (mean 3.9 years). TC levels decreased from baseline by 11-13% in group L and by 15-17% in groupS. TC levels at 1 year in S and L group were 209 +/- 2 mg/ dL (16 +/- 1% decrease) and 221+/- 2 mg/dL (12 +/- 1% decrease), respectively. Forty two and 29 CVEs occurred in group L and S, respectively. The incidence of CVEs was significantly lower in group S than in group L (P = 0.046, generalized Wilcoxon test; P = 0.096, log-rank test). The risk ratio for group S compared with group L was 0.674 (95% confidence interval: 0.423-1.074). Subgroup analyses suggested that the difference in the incidence of CVEs between the 2 groups was more clear in subjects without diabetes mellitus, with TC levels of < 253 mg/dL, and with TG levels of > or = 133 mg/dL. The incidence of CVEs in group S was significantly lower than that in group L in subjects without both diabetes mellitus and previous cardiovascular disease (P = 0.026, generalized Wilcoxon test; P = 0.032, log rank test). These findings suggest that standard-dose pravastatin (10-20 mg/day) is more effective in reducing the incidence of CVEs in the elderly than low dose pravastatin (5 mg/ day), especially in nondiabetic elderly patients with mild hypercholesterolemia or previous cardiovascular disease.", 
    "118": "Rhabdomyolysis is a rare but potentially fatal complication associated with the use of cholesterol synthesis inhibitors (statins). The complication can develop in susceptible patients and with the concomitant use of medications that impede the biodegradation of statins, for example, biotransformation via the cytochrome P450 system. This may result in the plasma and tissue concentrations of statins, and their active metabolites, increasing to levels that are toxic for striated muscle. Myopathy is present when plasma activity levels of creatinine kinase are raised to in excess of 10 times the upper limit of the normal value. Muscular complaints which may be indicative of myotoxicity and subsequent myopathy are present in 1-7% of statin users. Albeit to varying degrees, all statins can induce myotoxicity especially at high dosages. Rhabdomyolysis was clearly more prevalent under cerivastatin users than the users of other statins and was therefore recently withdrawn from the market. Statins should be withdrawn immediately if myopathy is suspected. Prompt withdrawal may prevent rhabdomyolysis.", 
    "119": "Increasing drug costs are a concern in Sweden. The costs for statin treatment are considerable, and among those increasing most rapidly (by 30-35% per year). Our survey of eligibility for statin treatment in Stockholm according to current Swedish recommendations (i.e. patients < 75 years with elevated cholesterol and manifest atherosclerotic disease, hereditary dyslipidemia, and diabetes) indicates marked undertreatment. The cost for statins in Stockholm 2000 was SEK 175 M (144 M for patients < 75 years). The projected cost, if current recommendations were to be fully implemented, is SEK 450 M for the target group and > 100 M extra for patients > 75 years and/or high cardiovascular risk. We propose that individual risk assessments should replace crude patient group recommendations to obtain reasonable \"numbers needed to treat\", i.e. to optimize the expenditure on statins and cost-effectiveness of the therapy. Prioritization of drug expenditures (within and between patient categories) must be debated, and medical needs must be made clear to those who determine the medical budget.", 
    "120": "Recently, it has been shown that statins increased cancellous bone formation and volume in 3-month-old rats and induced a minor decrease in osteoclast number. In the present study, one-year-old female rats were given simvastatin (10 mg/kg) or placebo daily for 3 months by a gastric tube. Specimens, 2.0 mm high, were cut transversely from the 5th lumbar vertebral body. The cancellous bone core diameters within the cortical shell of each specimen were delineated by a micro-CT scanner and then the cancellous bone was compressed in a materials testing machine between an upper and a lower platen with a diameter corresponding to the diameter of the cancellous bone core of each specimen. The cancellous bone volume was determined histomorphometrically on transverse sections. The cancellous bone volume in the simvastatin group (52.7 +/- 1.6%, mean value +/- SEM) was increased by 23% compared with the placebo group (42.8 +/- 1.7%). The compressive stress of the cancellous bone from the simvastatin group (31.8 +/- 2.7 MPa) was increased by 24% compared with the placebo group (24.1 +/- 1.9 MPa). No changes were found in cortical bone mass and strength after the statin treatment. In conclusion, statin given perorally to adult rats increased cancellous bone mass and increased cancellous bone compressive strength. The cancellous bone was found to possess normal biomechanical competence after the statin treatment.", 
    "121": "Clinical trials have demonstrated the beneficial effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors(statins) for stroke prevention, independent of their lipid-lowering effects. Recent experimental progress indicated the effects of statins for brain protection on both vascular walls(endothelium, smooth muscle, inflammatory cells and platelets) and extra-vascular tissues(brain parenchyma). These pleiotropic effects of statins have been, at least in part, ascribed to inhibition of small GTPases Rho and Ras, which require isoprenoids (intermediates of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway) for activation. Importantly, statin inhibition of Rho (1) attenuates the infarct size in a rat model of brain ischemia via the elevation of eNOS expression, and (2) suppresses vascular smooth muscle proliferation through up-regulation of CDK inhibitor p27kip1. The novel action of statin, as inhibitor of small GTPase family, should expand its potential toward integrative organ protection, beyond its conventional lipid-lowering and anti-atherogenic effects.", 
    "122": "The event of cerivastatin is the starting point for several methodological issues that, in the era of evidence-based medicine, should be the scientific basis of clinical practice. The article goes into three main issues: the production of evidence about efficacy of drugs, their safety profile through the collection of data about adverse drug reactions and the appropriateness of drug prescription.", 
    "123": "To investigate the ability of statins, the inhibitors of the hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase enzyme, to affect endothelial cell activation induced by anti-beta2-glycoprotein I (anti-beta2GPI) antibodies in vitro.", 
    "124": "Human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) activation was evaluated as U937 monocyte adhesion, E-selectin, and intercellular adhesion molecule I (ICAM-1) expression by cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and as interleukin-6 (IL-6) messenger RNA (mRNA) expression by RNA protection assay. E-selectin-specific nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) DNA-binding activity was evaluated by the gel-shift assay. HUVECs were activated by polyclonal affinity-purified IgG, human monoclonal IgM anti-beta2GPI antibodies, human recombinant IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha, or lipopolysaccharide (LPS).", 
    "125": "Fluvastatin reduced, in a concentration-dependent manner (1-10 microM), the adhesion of U937 to HUVECs and the expression of E-selectin and ICAM-1 induced by anti-beta2GPI antibodies as well as by cytokines or LPS. Another lipophilic statin, simvastatin, displayed similar effects but to a lesser extent than fluvastatin. The inhibition of E-selectin expression exerted by fluvastatin was related to the impairment of NF-kappaB binding to DNA. Moreover, the drug attenuated the expression of IL-6 mRNA in HUVEC exposed to anti-beta2GPI antibodies or cytokines. Incubation of HUVECs with mevalonate (100 microM), concomitantly with fluvastatin, greatly prevented the inhibitory effect of statin.", 
    "126": "Endothelial activation mediated by anti-beta2GPI antibody can be inhibited by statins. Because of the suggested role of endothelial cell activation in the pathogenesis of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), our data provide, for the first time, a rationale for using statins as an additional therapeutic tool in APS.", 
    "127": "A coalition of employers based in Ohio is addressing statin utilization on multiple fronts. By working through a new pharmacy benefits manager, it reduced its costs for statins by 9 percent over the course of one year, chiefly by replacing a relatively high-cost statin with a lower-cost statin believed to be of similar efficacy. The coalition also has worked on an individual basis with high prescribers of a high-cost statin, requesting them to consider a lower-cost statin. That effort also has met with success. Meanwhile, the coalition has launched a mail-based program intended to improve adherence among patients taking statins.", 
    "128": "According to guidelines, medical treatment of dyslipidaemia in post-AMI patients should await assessment of underlying lipid disorders and the outcome of dietary treatment. The risk of patients not being treated with lipid-lowering therapy because of lack of follow-up has led to more aggressive guidelines recommending statin treatment even before discharge from hospital. In a study comprising 730 patients, we have shown that, although most patients were discharged from the coronary care unit without statin treatment, a traditional rehabilitation programme succeeded in assessing more than 95% of the patients for underlying lipid disorders, and more than 75% of patients with plasma cholesterol > or = 5.5 mmol/l received lipid-lowering therapy within the first year. Most patients were treated with statins. Statins, however, were given in smaller doses than those used in the clinical trials, and only 52% of the treated patients reached the recommended goal of plasma cholesterol lower than 5 mmol/l."
