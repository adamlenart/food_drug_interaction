Our results suggested that PST increased the incidence of postoperative renal complication (relative risk [RR] 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.36, P\u200a=\u200a.03) with low heterogeneity (I\u200a=\u200a30%, P\u200a=\u200a.18). Six studies with 3116 patients detected no significant difference in severe renal complication between PST and control groups (RR 1.23, 95%CI 0.84-1.79, P\u200a=\u200a.28). Postoperative serum creatinine (sCr) at 48\u200ahours was shown to be higher in the PST group (mean difference [MD] 0.03, 95% CI 0.03-0.03; P\u200a<\u200a.01).

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association based on available evidence. We searched the databases of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Embase, and PubMed from inception to January 2017. Studies that evaluated the association between statin use and survival outcomes in gynecologic cancers were included. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival, disease-specific survival and progression-free survival were calculated using a fixed-effects model. A total of 11 studies involving more than 6,920 patients with endocrine-related gynecologic cancers were identified. In a meta-analysis of 7 studies involving 5,449 patients with endocrine-related gynecologic cancers, statin use was linked to improved overall survival (HR, 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63 to 0.80) without significant heterogeneity (I2 = 33.3%). Statin users also had improved disease-specific survival (3 studies, HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.90, I2 = 35.1%) and progression-free survival (3 studies, HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.93, I2 = 33.6%) in endocrine-related gynecologic cancers. Our findings support that statin use has potential survival benefits for patients with endocrine-related gynecologic cancers. Further large-scale prospective studies are required to validate our findings.",

Compared with saline, the risk of CIAKI was reduced by using statin (odds ratio [OR], 0.42; 95% credible interval [CrI], 0.26-0.67), xanthine (OR, 0.32; 95% CrI, 0.17-0.57), ischemic preconditioning (OR, 0.48; 95% CrI, 0.26-0.87), NAC+NaHCO3 (OR, 0.50; 95% CrI, 0.33-0.76), NAC (OR, 0.68; 95% CrI, 0.55-0.84), and NaHCO3 (OR, 0.66; 95% CrI, 0.47-0.90). The benefit of statin therapy was consistent across multiple sensitivity analyses, whereas the efficacy of all the other strategies was questioned by restricting the analysis to high-quality trials. Overall, high heterogeneity was observed for comparisons involving xanthine and ischemic preconditioning, although the impact of NAC and xanthine was probably influenced by publication bias/small-study effect. Hydration alone was the least effective preventive strategy for CIAKI. Meta-regressions did not reveal significant associations with baseline creatinine and contrast volume. In patients with diabetes mellitus, no strategy was found to reduce the incidence of CIAKI.",

    "17": "Statin use is associated with lower advanced prostate cancer risk. In addition to cholesterol lowering, statins have systemic anti-inflammatory properties. However, their effect on histologic prostate inflammation is not well understood, particularly among men at increased prostate cancer risk but with a negative prostate biopsy. We examined associations between serum lipid levels, statin use, and histologic prostate inflammation using data from 6,655 men with a negative baseline prostate biopsy in the REduction by DUtasteride of prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) trial. Statin use and lipid levels [total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides] were assessed at baseline. Inflammation was assessed by central review. Logistic regression was used to examine the effects of lipids and statin use on presence and extent of chronic and acute prostate inflammation [none, moderate (<20%), severe (\u226520% biopsy cores)]. Chronic and acute inflammation affected 77% and 15% of men, respectively. Men with high HDL (\u226560 vs. <40 mg/dL) had reduced presence of acute inflammation [OR, 0.79; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.63-0.99] and were less likely to have severe acute inflammation (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.45-0.97), but there were no other associations between lipids and inflammation. Statin users had reduced presence of chronic inflammation (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.69-0.95) and were less likely to have severe chronic (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.68-0.95) and severe acute inflammation (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.53-1.00), relative to non-users. Given the possible role for inflammation in prostate cancer, the inverse association between statins and prostate inflammation suggests a mechanism linking statins with lower advanced prostate cancer risk.

We hypothesized that the increased cardiovascular risk observed in psoriasis would be partially attributable to an elevated subclinical coronary artery disease burden composed of noncalcified plaques with high-risk features. However, inadequate efforts have been made to directly measure coronary artery disease in this vulnerable population. As such, we sought to compare total coronary plaque burden and noncalcified coronary plaque burden (NCB) and high-risk plaque (HRP) prevalence between patients with psoriasis (n=105), patients with hyperlipidemia eligible for statin therapy under National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines (n=100) who were \u224810 years older, and healthy volunteers without psoriasis (n=25).",

Furthermore, compared to healthy volunteers, patients with psoriasis had increased total coronary plaque burden (1.22\u00b10.31 versus 1.04\u00b10.22, P=0.001), NCB (1.18\u00b10.33 versus 1.03\u00b10.21, P=0.004), and HRP prevalence beyond traditional risk (odds ratio, 6.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-31.7; P=0.03). Last, among patients with psoriasis followed for 1 year, improvement in psoriasis severity was associated with improvement in total coronary plaque burden (\u03b2=0.45, 0.23-0.67; P<0.001) and NCB (\u03b2=0.53, 0.32-0.74; P<0.001) beyond traditional risk factors.",

In addition, patients with psoriasis had elevated NCB and equivalent HRP prevalence as older patients with hyperlipidemia.

Overactivation of SREBP1 and elevated lipid biogenesis are considered the major characteristics in malignancies of prostate cancer, endometrial cancer, and glioblastoma. However, the impact of SREBP1 activation in the progression of pancreatic cancer has not been explored. The present study examines the effect of suppression of SREBP1 activation by its inhibitors like fatostatin and PF429242 besides analyzing the impact of inhibitory effects on SREBP1 downstream signaling cascade such as fatty acid synthase (FAS), hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCoAR), stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1), and tumor suppressor protein p53 in MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells. Both fatostatin and PF429242 inhibited the growth of MIA PaCa-2\u00a0cells in a time and concentration-dependent manner with maximal inhibition attained at 72\u00a0h time period with IC50 values of 14.5\u00a0\u03bcM and 24.5\u00a0\u03bcM respectively. Detailed Western blot analysis performed using fatostatin and PF429242 at 72\u00a0h time point led to significant decrease in the levels of the active form of SREBP1 and its downstream signaling proteins such as FAS, SCD-1 and HMGCoAR and the mutant form of tumor suppressor protein, p53, levels in comparison to the levels observed in vehicle treated control group of MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cells over the same time period. Our in\u00a0vitro data suggest that SREBP1 may contribute to pancreatic tumor growth and its inhibitors could be considered as a potential target in the management of pancreatic cancer cell proliferation.", 
    "27": "Hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, namely statins, are potential anti-tumor agents. Previously, we showed that a pan-histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor enhances the anti-tumor effects of the HMG-CoA inhibitor. However, the underlying mechanisms were not fully understood. Cancer cell lines (CAL-27 and SACC-83) were exposed to pan-HDAC inhibitor, or HDAC1 inhibitor, or geranylgeranyl transferase type I (GGTase-I) inhibitor alone or in combination with statin. Cell viability, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were assessed by Cell Count Kit-8, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining, and transwell assay, respectively. A xenograft model was used for assessing tumor growth in vivo. Western blot and real-time PCR were used to assess the expression of genes. We observed that inhibiting HDAC1 could enhance the anti-tumor effects of statins both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibiting HDAC1 blocked the statin-induced upregulation of geranylgeranyl transferase type I\u03b2 subunit (GGTase-I\u03b2), resulting in an enhancement of the anti-cancer effects of statin. Overexpression of GGTase-I\u03b2 or constitutively active RhoA abolished the enhancement by inhibiting HDAC1 on anti-tumor effects of statins. The HDAC1 inhibitor failed to enhance cytotoxicity in non-tumor primary cells treated with statin. Inhibiting HDAC1 enhanced the anti-cancer effects of statins through downregulation of GGTase-I\u03b2 expression, and thus further inactivation of RhoA. A combination of statin with HDAC1 or GGTase-I inhibitor would be a new strategy for cancer chemotherapy.",

It is further proposed that interleukin-1beta (IL-1\u03b2) is a true mediating risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and that elevated homocysteine predicts coronary disease because it can serve as a marker for increased IL-1\u03b2 activity.

    "51": "There has been an unprecedented rise in the prevalence of stroke in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), which when compared to stroke profiles in high-income countries (HIC) is characterized by a younger age of onset, higher case fatality rates, and more severe disability among survivors. Stroke survivors in SSA (vs. HIC) are especially at high risk for recurrent vascular events or death due to undiagnosed or under-controlled vascular risk factors, logistical challenges, low health literacy, and lack of care affordability. While international expert consensus secondary prevention guidelines recommend that antihypertensive, statin and anti-platelet therapy, be initiated promptly after ischemic stroke and adhered to in a persistent fashion to achieve optimal vascular risk reduction, these goals are seldom realized in routine clinical care settings in SSA. A relatively simple, low-cost, evidence-based strategy that could be largely applied in a uniform manner to stroke survivors in low-to-middle income countries (LMICs), including the nations of SSA, is sorely needed. Fixed-dose combination pills, also known \"polypills\", containing generic drugs, i.e. Aspirin, a statin, and blood pressure (BP) lowering medication(s) may be a viable avenue to improve medication adherence and consequently reduce risk of further disability or death on a large scale among stroke survivors encountered in resource-constrained regions. In this conceptual article, we review the data supporting the rationale for a polypill to improve stroke outcomes in SSA and propose the conduct of a Stroke Minimization through Additive Anti-atherosclerotic Agent in Routine Treatment (SMAART) pilot study to determine the impact of a polypill such as the Polycap DS\u00ae in reducing future vascular risk compared to usual care in recent stroke in SSA. A preliminarily feasible and efficacy-suggesting SMAART trial could inform the future design of a multi-center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial comparing the clinical efficacy of the polypill strategy for vascular risk moderation among stroke survivors in LMICs.", 
    "52": "Lipophilicity plays a crucial role in determining the hepato-selectivity and hence, the biological activity and the associated side effects of statins. Herein, the employment of RP-TLC for estimation of lipophilicity of six statins namely; atorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, lovastatin, rosuvastatin and fluvastatin is examined. A very good correlation between the chromatographically-determined retention parameters (relative lipophilicity (RM0) or lipophilic parameter (C0)) and both experimental and computed log P values were obtained. However, the results indicate that the type of organic modifier in the mobile phase system (methanol, acetonitrile and acetone) has a small influence on RM0 or C0 values. Higher values of RM0 or C0 are ascribed to lipophilic statins and lower values of RM0 or C0 are attributed to hydrophilic ones. Therefore, RM0 or C0 could be effectively used as simple practical predictors of extra-hepatic distributions of statins and thus their expected side effects. Furthermore, three QSPR (quantitative structure-property relationship) models were constructed to describe the relationship between RM0 with log P and log D of the statins under investigation. These models can be very useful to predict the lipophilicity of other members of statin drugs and might be expanded to newly synthesized compounds with the same structural features.",

Statins can also activate AMPK, resulting in the secretion of adiponectin. We determined whether atorvastatin inhibits angiotensin II-induced cardiac fibrosis (AICF) in the presence or absence of adiponectin. Adiponectin knockout (APN-KO, n\u00a0=\u00a044) and wild type (WT, n\u00a0=\u00a044) mice were received subcutaneous angiotensin II (1.5\u00a0mg/kg/day), and atorvastatin (10\u00a0mg/kg/day) was administered orally for 15\u00a0days. The mRNA expression levels of collagen type I and III, as well as AMPK phosphorylation levels in cardiac tissue were then measured. In the APN-KO mice, collagen type I (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and type III (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) expression was significantly greater when treated with angiotensin II, while their expression was significantly reduced in the presence of angiotensin II and atorvastatin. Relative AMPK phosphorylation levels in APN-KO mice were also significantly higher in the angiotensin II\u00a0+\u00a0atorvastatin group when compared with angiotensin II group alone. We conclude that atorvastatin attenuates AICF independently from adiponectin by activating AMPK.

With such development in policy comes a stronger need for understanding statins' myriad of effects. Surprisingly little is known about possible direct actions of statins on cardiac myocytes, although claims of a direct myocardial toxicity have been made. Here, we determine the impact of simvastatin administration (40 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks in normocholesterolemic rats on cardiac myocyte contractile function and identify an underlying mechanism. Under basal conditions, statin treatment increased the time to half (t0.5) relaxation without any effect on the magnitude of shortening, or the magnitude/kinetics of the [Ca(2+)]i transient. Enhanced myocyte lusitropy could be explained by a corresponding increase in phosphorylation of troponin I (TnI) at Ser(23,24). Statin treatment increased expression of eNOS and Ser(1177) phosphorylated eNOS, decreased expression of the NOS-inhibitory proteins caveolins 1 and 3, and increased (P = 0.06) NO metabolites, consistent with enhanced NO production. It is well-established that NO stimulates protein kinase G, one of the effectors of TnI phosphorylation at Ser(23,24). Trends for parallel changes in phospho-TnI, phospho-eNOS and caveolin 1 expression were seen in atrial muscle from patients taking statins. Our data are consistent with a mechanism whereby chronic statin treatment enhances TnI phosphorylation and myocyte lusitropy through increased NO bioavailability. We see no evidence of impaired function with statin treatment; the changes we document at the level of the cardiac myocyte should facilitate diastolic filling and cardiac performance.",

Nerve conduction study demonstrated no evidence of neuropathy; electromyography revealed spontaneous activity suggestive of myopathy. A muscle biopsy was performed and demonstrated myonecrosis.

Myalgias and/or myopathic symptoms are among the most recognized side effects of the medication. Statin-associated autoimmune myopathy is a very rare complication of statin use and estimated to affect two to three for every 100,000 patients treated. Clinically, the condition presents as progressive symmetric weakness, muscle enzyme elevations, necrotizing myopathy on muscle biopsy, and the presence of autoantibodies to HMGCR. These findings will often persist and even progress despite discontinuation of the statin. Very few cases of SAM have been described in the literature.

    "161": "In children, the co-administered volume increases with age because of a gradual switch from liquids to solid dosage forms. In adults, water was the most selected co-administered fluid and the preferred volume of intake was a half glass of liquid.", 
    "162": "Results of the surveys clearly indicated that the majority of all participants took their medication with a sip or half glass of water. However, this was not the case for the youngest children, as their preferred formulations were liquids (eg solutions, suspensions) which do not require any extra intake of liquid. In the case of specific classes of drugs, real-life intake can still be improved, suggesting that the pharmacist's advice has an important influence on their administration of medicines.", 
    "163": "It is well recognized that the elevated plasma level of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Deposition of pro-atherogenic LDL-C, on the intima of arterial wall, contributes to plaque formation and atherosclerosis, which further leads to lowered blood flow to vital organs and increased risk of CVD. The most commonly used statin therapy is effective in reducing dyslipidemia and preventing cardiovascular events only in about half of the patient population. However, in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, these drugs were not effective to meet the required goals of lower LDL-C, and to reduce the CVD risk. Furthermore, many patients even develop intolerability to statins and resistance. The identification of pro-protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and the association of PCSK9 mutations with familial hypercholesterolemia led to the identification of PCSK9 as a new therapeutic target for lowering LDL-C and dyslipidemia-associated CVD. PCSK9 is found to promote the degradation of LDL-receptor (LDLR), thus rendering it unavailable for recycling to hepatocyte plasma membrane, leading to elevated levels of circulating LDL-C, as it cannot be taken up into cells. While gain-of-function mutations aggravate the degradation of LDLR as in familial hypercholesterolemia whereas loss of function mutations reduce the ability of PCSK9 to promote the degradation of LDLR and thus lower the plasma level of LDL-C and dyslipidemia. Monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 are currently being tested in clinical trials and are found to be efficacious in countering the activity of PCSK9 and thus control the plasma LDL-C and triglycerides even in statin non-responsive patients and protect against dyslipidemia-related CVD.",

All patients underwent continuous 1-hour transcranial Doppler monitoring of the relevant vessel at baseline (\u226424 hours). SP was recorded and dichotomized as high dose or low-to-moderate dose. SP was documented in 43 (41%) of 106 LAA patients (mean age, 65.4\u00b110.3 years; 72% men; low-to-moderate dose, 32%; high dose, 8%).

There is a need to develop effective treatments, and drug repositioning is an interesting alternative to achieve new strategies to treat cryptococcosis. Atorvastatin (ATO), a statin currently used to treat hypercholesterolaemia, was tested in this study as an adjuvant to control infections caused by C. gattii. Several aspects of the effect of ATO on the host and the yeast were evaluated, with particular focus on the association of ATO with fluconazole (FLC), which (i) reduced ergosterol content in the cell membrane and altered properties of the polysaccharide capsule of C. gattii; (ii) increased the production of reactive oxygen species by macrophages; and (iii) reduced yeast phagocytosis and the intracellular proliferation rate. In an animal model, infected mice treated with ATO\u2009+\u2009FLC showed increased survival, improved clinical condition, and reduced fungal burden in the lungs and brain. This study is the first to perform in vivo tests with ATO\u2009+\u2009FLC for the treatment of cryptococcosis. The results suggest that ATO may be an important adjuvant for the treatment of cryptococcosis.",

There is a pressing need for public health interventions to increase the use of statin medications, especially among high-risk patients. In this article, we present the results of a quality assurance pilot program to provide laboratory-reported Framingham Risk Score (FRS) to physicians. This work was performed in a mixed urban and rural setting in southern Alberta. We provided FRSs and, for high-risk patients, statin treatment recommendations in conjunction with laboratory lipid panel requests. Adhesive labels were supplied to primary care physicians, and space was provided for information necessary for the calculation of the FRS by a laboratory information system. In total, 16 physicians from 4 different clinics participated in the pilot program. Data were collected from October 25, 2014-November 5, 2015, during which time 1266 patients had FRSs from the laboratory. Three hundred twenty-four individuals were identified as high risk for coronary heart disease (\u2265\u00a020% 10-year risk) and received a recommendation for treatment with a statin medication in the laboratory result report. These individuals had a 26% relative and a 6.4% absolute increase in statin prescriptions compared with before the pilot program.

The isolated compounds from RYR were subjected to anti-proliferation assay, apoptosis assay via flow cytometry, and telomerase inhibitory assay via telomeric repeat amplification protocol-PCR (TRAP-PCR) assay, and Western blotting assay in an in vitro cell culture system. The results showed that a statin, monacolin L, and a red pigment, rubropunctatin, from RYR exhibited very strong cancer cell proliferation inhibitory effects; the rubropunctatin was comparable with anticancer drug cis-platinum, taxol, and 10-hydroxy-camptothecin (HCPT) in their IC50 values. Monacolin L and rubropunctatin exerted their anticancer activity via telomerase inhibitory effects. Monacolin L and rubropunctatin presented the similar telomerase inhibitory effects as the anticancer drug cis-platinum, while the anticancer drug HCPT presented a weak telomerase inhibitory effect in the TRAP-PCR assay. Meanwhile, rubropunctatin and cis-platinum did not present strong apoptosis induction activity as the momacolin L and HCPT did. These results indicate that the RYR may exert anticancer effects through the telomerase inhibitory effect of rubropunctatin and the apoptosis-induction effect of monacolin L.",

In clinical studies, plasma LDL burden is usually estimated by determination of plasma LDL cholesterol level (LDL-C). Rare genetic mutations that cause reduced LDL receptor function lead to markedly higher LDL-C and a dose-dependent increase in the risk of ASCVD, whereas rare variants leading to lower LDL-C are associated with a correspondingly lower risk of ASCVD. Separate meta-analyses of over 200 prospective cohort studies, Mendelian randomization studies, and randomized trials including more than 2 million participants with over 20 million person-years of follow-up and over 150\u2009000 cardiovascular events demonstrate a remarkably consistent dose-dependent log-linear association between the absolute magnitude of exposure of the vasculature to LDL-C and the risk of ASCVD; and this effect appears to increase with increasing duration of exposure to LDL-C. Both the naturally randomized genetic studies and the randomized intervention trials consistently demonstrate that any mechanism of lowering plasma LDL particle concentration should reduce the risk of ASCVD events proportional to the absolute reduction in LDL-C and the cumulative duration of exposure to lower LDL-C, provided that the achieved reduction in LDL-C is concordant with the reduction in LDL particle number and that there are no competing deleterious off-target effects.",

    "203": "The impact of systemic 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC) and intratumoral CYP27A1 expression on pathobiology and clinical response to statins in breast cancer needs clarification. 27HC is an oxysterol produced from cholesterol by the monooxygenase CYP27A1, which regulates intracellular cholesterol homeostasis. 27HC also acts as an endogenous selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator capable of increasing breast cancer growth and metastasis. 27HC levels can be modulated by statins or direct inhibition of CYP27A1, thereby attenuating its pro-tumorigenic activities. Herein, the effect of statins on serum 27HC and tumor-specific CYP27A1 expression was evaluated in 42 breast cancer patients treated with atorvastatin within a phase II clinical trial. Further, the associations between CYP27A1 expression with other primary tumor pathological features and clinical outcomes were studied in two additional independent cohorts. Statin treatment effectively decreased serum 27HC and deregulated CYP27A1 expression in tumors. However, these changes were not associated with anti-proliferative responses to statin treatment. CYP27A1 was heterogeneously expressed among primary tumors, with high expression significantly associated with high tumor grade, ER negativity and basal-like subtype. High CYP27A1 expression was independently prognostic for longer recurrence-free and overall survival. Importantly, the beneficial effect of high CYP27A1 in ER-positive breast cancer seemed limited to women aged \u226450 years. These results establish a link between CYP27A1 and breast cancer pathobiology and prognosis and propose that the efficacy of statins in reducing serum lipids does not directly translate to anti-proliferative effects in tumors. Changes in other undetermined serum or tumor factors suggestively mediate the anti-proliferative effects of statins in breast cancer.",

For a 15% cardiovascular risk (vignette 2) and for a low-level of DTD, the payoff time was 5.5 years and 9.5 years, respectively. For a 20% cardiovascular risk (vignette 3), the payoff time was 4.2 and 7.2 years, respectively.

We, therefore, aimed at exploring microRNA (miRNA) expression to understand molecular mechanism of statin-induced toxicity. miRNA expression profiling assay for cerivastatin (1 \u03bcM for 48\u00a0h)-treated RD cells showed more than 2-fold decrease in 26 miRNA expressions with miR-145 being downregulated prominently. When RD cells were treated with cerivastatin at 10 \u03bcM for 36\u00a0h, mitochondrial dysfunction was observed in 49.6% of the population without causing apoptosis, whereas 82% underwent apoptosis when treated at 10 \u03bcM for 48\u00a0h. In RD cells treated under the same condition (10 \u03bcM for 48\u00a0h), miR-145 expression and mRNA expressions of proapoptotic APAF1 and CASP10 genes, potential targets of miR-145, significantly decreased and increased, respectively. Moreover, enforced expression of miR-145 reduced apoptotic cell population of cerivastatin-treated RD cells (10 \u03bcM for 36\u00a0h). Because miR-145 increased in extracellular medium from cerivastatin-treated RD cells, miR-145 was suggested to be secreted in response to statin-induced toxicity. These results provide a new rationale for statin's toxicity that statin-induced apoptosis is caused by enhanced expression of proapoptotic genes mediated by decreased intracellular miR-145 due to statin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.", 
    "221": "Aims Cardiovascular fixed-dose combination pills, or polypills, may help address the widespread lack of access and adherence to proven medicines. Initiation of polypill-based care typically entails switching from current separately taken medications. Given the heterogeneity in usual care, there is interest in the impact of polypill treatment across different patterns of prior medication regimen. Methods A total of 2004 participants with established cardiovascular disease or estimated 5-year cardiovascular risk of over 15% were randomised to polypill-based treatment (aspirin 75\u2009mg, simvastatin 40\u2009mg, lisinopril 10\u2009mg and either atenolol 50\u2009mg or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5\u2009mg) or usual care. Baseline medications were classified by potency relative to polypill components. Estimated cardiovascular risk reduction was calculated by combining risk factor changes with results seen in meta-analyses of previous randomised trials. Results For cholesterol reduction conferred by polypills, there was a dose response across baseline statin groups, with mean low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol differences of 0.37, 0.22, 0.14 and 0.07\u2009mmol/L among patients taking no statin, less potent, equipotent and more potent statin at baseline, respectively. Similarly there were differences in mean systolic BP of 5.4, 6.2, 3.3 and 1.8\u2009mmHg among patients taking 0, 1, 2 or 3 BP-lowering agents. Among patients taking more potent statins at baseline, there was no significant difference in LDL-cholesterol but there were benefits for BP and aspirin adherence. Similar results were seen among patients taking 3 BP-lowering agents at baseline. Switching to a polypill-based strategy resulted in estimated cardiovascular relative risk reductions across a wide range of usual care patterns of antiplatelet, statin and BP-lowering therapy prescribing. Conclusion Adherence benefits from switching to a polypill resulted in risk factor changes that were at least as good as usual care across a wide variety of treatment patterns, including equally potent or more potent regimens. The benefits of switching to polypill-based care were greatest among those stepped up from partial treatment or less potent treatment.",

Design The LUdwigshafen RIsk and Cardiovascular health (LURIC) study is a prospective observational registry of patients who were referred for coronary angiography. Methods Circulating PCSK9 was measured in 2139 participants of the LURIC study. There was a follow-up for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality with a median (interquartile range) duration of 10.1 (8.1-10.8) years. Results The mean (standard deviation) age of the participants (1470 males and 669 females) was 62.6 (10.8) years, body mass index 27.3 (4.0) kg/m(2), and low density lipoprotein cholesterol 114 (33) mg/dl. The mean (standard deviation) PCSK9 concentration was 220 (82) ng/ml. Of the participants, 1035 (48.4%) were on statins. Use of statins was associated with significantly lower low density lipoprotein cholesterol (106 vs 121\u2009mg/dl, p\u2009<\u20090.001) but significantly higher circulating PCSK9 (244 vs 197\u2009ng/ml, p\u2009<\u20090.001). A total of 674 (31.5%) study participants died from any cause and 431 (20.1%) from cardiovascular diseases. In the entire cohort, the third vs first tertile of PCSK9 was not associated with the risk of death from any cause (hazard ratio\u2009=\u20091.09, p\u2009=\u20090.367) and from cardiovascular diseases (hazard ratio\u2009=\u20091.09, p\u2009=\u20090.476). In participants without statins, the third vs first PCSK9 tertile was modestly associated with increased all cause mortality (hazard ratio\u2009=\u20091.34, p\u2009=\u20090.029) but not with cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio\u2009=\u20091.25, p\u2009=\u20090.194). Conclusions Circulating PCSK9 may be upregulated by statin use and does not appear to be useful for cardiovascular risk stratification.", 
    "223": "Background Statin treatment in association with physical exercise can substantially reduce mortality in dyslipidaemic individuals. However, the available data to compare the efficacy and safety of statins and exercise combination therapy with statin monotherapy are limited. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods We systematically searched PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library from database inception until December 2016. We included randomised and non-randomised studies that compared the efficacy and safety of statins and exercise combination therapy with statin monotherapy in patients with dyslipidaemia. Standardised mean differences were calculated and pooled by means of fixed effects models. The risk of bias and heterogeneity among trials was also assessed. Seven articles were assessed in terms of the efficacy of therapy and 13 from the viewpoint of therapeutic safety. Results In terms of efficacy, statins and exercise combination decreased the incidence of diabetes mellitus, improved insulin sensitivity and inflammation, but caused no change in lipid profile compared to statins alone. In terms of safety, statins and exercise combination increased peak oxygen uptake (standardised mean difference 1.01, 95% confidence interval 0.46 to 1.57) compared to statins alone. In contrast to statin-induced myopathy, chronic exercise training prior to statin treatment could counteract statin-induced adverse effects in skeletal muscle. Conclusion Statins and exercise combination therapy is more effective than statin monotherapy in terms of insulin sensitivity, inflammation and exercise capacity. The small number of studies warrants the need for more randomised controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of combination therapy.", 
    "224": "Although patients with diabetes have 2 to 4 times increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than individuals without diabetes, recent studies indicate that a significant part of patients are in a lower cardiovascular risk category. Men younger than 35\u00a0years, women younger than 45\u00a0years, patients with diabetes duration of less than 10\u00a0years without other risk factors have a much lower risk than patients who have traditional cardiovascular\u00a0risk factors, and\u00a0subclinical or established coronary artery disease (CAD). These patients are not risk equivalent as stated in previous studies. On the contrary, when in the presence of traditional risk factors or evidence of subclinical coronary disease (e.g. high coronary calcium score), the coronary risk is much increased and patients may be classified at a higher-risk category. Recent guidelines do not anymore consider diabetes as a CAD risk equivalent and recommend cardiovascular risk stratification for primary prevention. Stratification of\u00a0diabetic patients improves accuracy in prediction of subclinical CAD, silent ischemia and future cardiovascular events. Stratification also discriminates higher from lower risk patients who may need intensive statin or aspirin prevention, while avoiding overtreatment in lower risk cases. It may also allow the clinician to decide whether to intensify risk reduction actions through specific newer drugs for glucose control such as SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 agonists, which recently have shown additional cardiovascular protector effect. This review addresses the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk using traditional and non-traditional cardiovascular risk factors.

A simplified definition of AD was proposed to enhance understanding of this condition, its prevalence and its impact on cardiovascular risk. AD can be defined by high fasting triglyceride levels (\u22652.3mmol/L / \u2265200mg/dL) and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) levels (\u22641,0 / 40 and \u22641,3mmol/L / 50mg/dL in men and women, respectively) in statin-treated patients at high cardiovascular risk. The use of a single marker for the diagnosis and treatment of AD, such as non-HDL-c, was advocated. Interventions including lifestyle optimization and low density lipoprotein (LDL) lowering therapy with statins (\u00b1ezetimibe) are recommended by experts. Treatment of residual AD can be performed with the addition of fenofibrate, since it can improve the complete lipoprotein profile and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with AD. Others clinical condictions in which fenofibrate may be prescribed include patients with very high TGs (\u22655.6mmol/L / 500mg/dL), patients who are intolerant or resistant to statins, and patients with AD and at high cardiovascular risk. The fenofibrate-statin combination was considered by the experts to benefit from a favorable benefit-risk profile.

In conclusion, these findings provide further evidence that\u00a0the untoward effects of torcetrapib were attributable to off-target effects and not related to disturbances in lipoprotein transport.",

    "257": "The HIJ-PROPER study is a prospective, randomized, open-label trial to assess whether intensive LDL-C lowering with standard-dose pitavastatin plus ezetimibe reduces cardiovascular events more than standard LDL-C lowering with pitavastatin monotherapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and dyslipidaemia. Patients were randomized to intensive lowering (target LDL-C\u2009<\u200970\u2009mg/dL [1.8\u2009mmol/L]; pitavastatin plus ezetimibe) or standard lowering (target LDL-C 90\u2009mg/dL to 100\u2009mg/dL [2.3-2.6\u2009mmol/L]; pitavastatin monotherapy). The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, unstable angina, and ischaemia-driven revascularization. Between January 2010 and April 2013, 1734 patients were enroled at 19 hospitals in Japan. Patients were followed for at least 36\u2009months. Median follow-up was 3.86 years. Mean follow-up LDL-C was 65.1\u2009mg/dL (1.68\u2009mmol/L) for pitavastatin plus ezetimibe and 84.6\u2009mg/dL (2.19\u2009mmol/L) for pitavastatin monotherapy. LDL-C lowering with statin plus ezetimibe did not reduce primary endpoint occurrence in comparison with standard statin monotherapy (283/864, 32.8% vs. 316/857, 36.9%; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.76-1.04, P\u2009=\u20090.152). In, ACS patients with higher cholesterol absorption, represented by elevated pre-treatment sitosterol, was associated with significantly lower incidence of the primary endpoint in the statin plus ezetimibe group (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56-0.91).", 
    "258": "Although intensive lowering with standard pitavastatin plus ezetimibe showed no more cardiovascular benefit than standard pitavastatin monotherapy in ACS patients with dyslipidaemia, statin plus ezetimibe may be more effective than statin monotherapy in patients with higher cholesterol absorption; further confirmation is needed.",

    "260": "Oxidative stress is increased in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Statins reduce oxidative stress independent of their effect in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin on oxidative status by investigating serum paraoxonase, serum arylesterase, total oxidant status, total antioxidant status (TAS) and oxidative stress index (OSI) in patients with AMI.", 
    "261": "Seventy patients with AMI were randomized into 2 groups; total of 55 patients (19 females, 36 males) aged 32 to 86 years completed the study and were included in the analysis. Patients were treated with 80 mg atorvastatin or 40 mg rosuvastatin for 4 weeks. Lipid parameters and parameters of oxidative status were measured at admission and after 4-week statin treatment.", 
    "262": "After 4-week treatment, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin were associated with significant reduction in TAS, OSI, total cholesterol, and LDL-C levels. Serum paraoxonase level was significantly increased in both groups, while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level was significantly reduced in atorvastatin group. No statistically significant differences were found between atorvastatin and rosuvastatin in terms of actual difference in oxidative stress parameters.", 
    "263": "Atorvastatin and rosuvastatin have similar effects on oxidative status in patients with AMI. Rosuvastatin affected HDL-C level more favorably than atorvastatin."
