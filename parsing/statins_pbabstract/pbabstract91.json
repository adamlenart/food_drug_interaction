Our previous study has showed that statin, the inhibitor of HMGCR, inhibited the tumorigenecity of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in vitro and in vivo. However, the function of HMGCR in the carcinogenesis of ESCC cells remains unknown. In this study, we have observed the up-regulation of HMGCR in ESCC tissues compared with the paired normal tissues. Over-expression of HMGCR in ESCC cells promoted cell growth and migration, while knockdown of the expression of HMGCR inhibited the growth, migration and colony formation of ESCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we found that oncogene Myc positively regulated the expression of HMGCR. Taken together, our study revealed the pivotal function of HMGCR and mevalonate pathway in the progression of ESCC and supported the clinical application of statin.", 
    "1": "Reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress are associated with various cell processes, including cell survival and apoptosis. Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). In the present study, we evaluated the effects of lovastatin chemoprotection against hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress in bone marrow stromal cell-derived neural stem cells (BMSC-derived NSCs) and whether it has protective effects. BMSC-derived NSCs were pretreated with different doses of lovastatin for 48\u00a0h and then exposed to 125\u00a0\u03bcM H2O2 for 30\u00a0min. Using MTT, TUNEL assay, and real-time RT-PCR, we evaluated the effects of lovastatin on cell survival, apoptosis, and PGC-1\u03b1 and Nrf2 expression rates in pretreated BMSC-derived NSCs compared to control groups. Results showed that apoptosis rate in the lovastatin-pretreated BMSC-derived NSCs was significantly decreased compared to the control group. Our findings suggest that lovastatin protects NSCs against oxidative stress-induced cell death, and therefore, it may be used to promote the survival rate of NSCs and can be a candidate for treatment of oxidative stress-mediated neurological diseases.", 
    "2": "Statins are competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the cellular production of cholesterol and other products of the mevalonate pathway. Statins exert hepatic and extrahepatic effects, modulating the function of various tissues and organs, including ovaries. Previously, we have demonstrated that simvastatin inhibited cellular proliferation and reduced androgen production by ovarian theca-interstitial cells. The above actions are of translational relevance to the most common endocrine disorder among women in reproductive age: polycystic ovary syndrome. However, different statins may have distinctly different profiles of effects on cholesterol and androgens. The present study was designed to compare the effects of several statins on growth and steroidogenesis of rat theca-interstitial cells. The cells were incubated in the absence (control) or in the presence of simvastatin, lovastatin, atorvastatin, or pravastatin. Assessment of effects of statins on cell growth was carried out by evaluation of DNA synthesis and by estimation of the number of viable cells. Effects on steroidogenesis were evaluated by quantification of steroid production and expression of mRNA for the key enzyme regulating androgen production: Cyp17a1. Among tested statins, simvastatin exerted the greatest inhibitory effects on all tested parameters. The rank order of the effects of the tested statins is as follows: simvastatin > lovastatin > atorvastatin \u2265 pravastatin. While the lipophilicity is likely to play a major role in determining the ability of statins to act on nonhepatic cells, other factors unique to individual cell types are also likely to be relevant.",

We investigated the effects of atorvastatin, a 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitor; amlodipine, a calcium antagonist; and their combination on blood pressure, arterial relaxation and contraction, and vascular oxidative stress in aortas of high fructose-fed rats. Oral administration of atorvastatin for 8 weeks did not significantly lower blood pressure, but normalized angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction and endothelial function in the fructose-fed rats. Atorvastatin treatment of fructose-fed rats increased vascular BH4 content, which was associated with an increase in endothelial NO synthase activity as well as a reduction in endothelial O2(-) production. On the other hand, administration of amlodipine did not affect the angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction and endothelial function, but normalized the elevated blood pressure in the fructose-fed rats. The combined treatment did not show synergistic but additive beneficial effects. The present study suggests that combined therapy of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and calcium antagonists prevents functional vascular disorders in the insulin-resistant state, possibly resulting in the protection against or delay of development of hypertension, vascular dysfunction in diabetes, and thereafter atherosclerosis.",

Non-HDL-cholesterol target values are 0.8 mmol/L higher than those for LDL-cholesterol in the same cardiovascular risk category. Currently, the main issue of lipidology is the degree by which the cardiovascular risk can be reduced with the treatment of residual dyslipidemia that exists under statin therapy. In such a role the examined agents have essentially failed despite their more or less profound effect on HDL-cholesterol and/or non-HDL-cholesterol. The largest loser has been the nicotinic acid. The results of cardiovascular, otherwise controversial fish oil studies cannot be considered convincing because of the administered low doses. In a combination with statin (i) ezetimibe may have role if the LDL-cholesterol target cannot be reached with statin monotherapy, or (ii) fibrates, in case of large increase of triglyceride level, or in less severe hypertriglyceridemia if it is associated with considerable decrease in HDL-cholesterol level.

    "9": "Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) or ubiquinone was known for its key role in mitochondrial bioenergetics as electron and proton carrier; later studies demonstrated its presence in other cellular membranes and in blood plasma, and extensively investigated its antioxidant role. These two functions constitute the basis for supporting the clinical indication of CoQ10. Furthermore, recent data indicate that CoQ10 affects expression of genes involved in human cell signalling, metabolism and transport and some of the effects of CoQ10 supplementation may be due to this property. CoQ10 deficiencies are due to autosomal recessive mutations, mitochondrial diseases, ageing-related oxidative stress and carcinogenesis processes, and also a secondary effect of statin treatment. Many neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, cancer, fibromyalgia, muscular and cardiovascular diseases have been associated with low CoQ10 levels. CoQ10 treatment does not cause serious adverse effects in humans and new formulations have been developed that increase CoQ10 absorption and tissue distribution. Oral CoQ10 treatment is a frequent mitochondrial energizer and antioxidant strategy in many diseases that may provide a significant symptomatic benefit.", 
    "10": "Although lipid-lowering therapy with statin and ezetimibe has been reported to provide greater reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels than statin monotherapy, the effect of supplemental therapy on plaque stabilization is yet to be fully elucidated. Cap thickness of fibroatheroma evaluated by optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a major determinant of vulnerable plaque. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of ezetimibe in addition to fluvastatin on the progression of coronary atherosclerotic plaque evaluated by OCT. Sixty-three patients with angina pectoris with intermediate, nonculprit, lipid-rich plaque lesions evaluated by OCT were enrolled. The patients were divided into 2 groups: ezetimibe (10 mg/day) + fluvastatin (30 mg/day), and fluvastatin (30 mg/day) alone, and serial OCT examinations were performed at baseline and 9-month follow-up. A total of 57 patients (ezetimibe + fluvastatin, n = 31; fluvastatin alone, n = 26) underwent serial OCT examinations. The change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was significantly larger in the ezetimibe + fluvastatin group compared with fluvastatin-alone group (-34.0 \u00b1 32.0 vs -8.3 \u00b1 17.4 mg/dl, p <0.001). Fibrous cap thickness was significantly increased and the angle of the lipid plaque was significantly decreased in both groups. The change in the fibrous cap thickness was significantly greater in the ezetimibe + fluvastatin group (0.08 \u00b1 0.08 mm vs 0.04 \u00b1 0.06 mm, p <0.001). In conclusion, lipid-lowering therapy by ezetimibe + fluvastatin could increase the fibrous cap thickness of lipid-rich plaque compared with fluvastatin monotherapy.",

This review article focuses primarily on idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI). New epidemiologic data suggest that approximately 20 new cases of DILI per 100,000 persons occur each year. Idiosyncratic DILI accounts for 11% of the cases of acute liver failure in the United States. Risk factors for DILI include medication dose, drug lipophilicity, and extent of hepatic metabolism. There is mixed evidence to support the role of host factors such as age, sex, and chronic liver disease in the development of DILI. For specific drugs, a genetic predisposition appears to be a risk factor for DILI. Suspected cases of idiosyncratic DILI should be categorized as hepatitic, cholestatic, or mixed on the basis of the degree/ratio of abnormalities in the alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase. A careful evaluation for other causes of liver disease should be performed, though a liver biopsy is rarely needed. There is evidence that some patients with DILI may actually have hepatitis E and this diagnosis should be considered. Amoxicillin/clavulanate isoniazid, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are among the most common causes of DILI. Drug discontinuation or dechallenge should lead to an improvement in liver biochemistries in most patients, though a bilirubin value of more than 3 g/dL is associated with mortality of at least 10%. New biomarkers for DILI using proteomics and micro RNA appear promising but require further study.

During that time, there has been an evolution in the focus of nutritional intervention. Early trials emphasized reduction of dietary fat with the goal of preventing heart disease by reducing serum cholesterol. Results from trials focused exclusively on dietary fat reduction were disappointing, prompting subsequent studies incorporating a whole diet approach with a nuanced recommendation for fat intake. The Mediterranean-style diet, with a focus on vegetables, fruit, fish, whole grains, and olive oil, has proven to reduce cardiovascular events to a degree greater than low-fat diets and equal to or greater than the benefit observed in statin trials.",

Applying VCD to pharmaceutically relevant compounds has been handled in an ad hoc fashion, relying on fragment analysis and technical shortcuts to reduce the computational time required. We leverage a large computational infrastructure to provide adequate conformational exploration which enables an accurate assignment of absolute configuration. We describe a systematic approach for rapid calculation of VCD/IR spectra and comparison with corresponding measured spectra and apply this approach to assign the correct stereochemistry of nine test cases. We suggest moving away from the fragment approach when making VCD assignments. In addition to enabling faster and more reliable VCD assignments of absolute configuration, the ability to rapidly explore conformational space and sample conformations of complex molecules will have applicability in other areas of drug discovery.",

But they also possess several adverse effects like myopathy with elevation of hepatic transaminases (>3 times the upper limit of normal) or creatine kinase (>10 times the upper limit of normal) and some rare side-effects, including peripheral neuropathy, memory loss, sleep disturbances, and erectile dysfunction. Due to these adverse effects, patients abruptly withdrew statins without consulting physicians. This abrupt discontinuation of statins is termed as statin intolerance. Statin-induced myopathy constitutes two third of all side-effects from statins and is the primary reason for statin intolerance. Though statin intolerance has considerably impacted cardiovascular outcomes in the high-risk patients, it has been well effectively managed by prescribing statins either as alternate-day or once weekly dosage regimen, as combination therapy with a non-statin therapy or and by dietary intervention. The present article reviews the causes, clinical implications of statin withdrawal and management of statin intolerance.",

All three elements of AD per se have been recognised as independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. LDL-C/HDL-C ratio has shown excellent risk prediction of coronary heart disease than either of the two risk markers. Asian Indians have a higher prevalence of AD than western population due to higher physical inactivity, low exercise and diet deficient in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The AD can be well managed by therapeutic lifestyle changes with increased physical activities, regular exercise, and diets low in carbohydrates and high in PUFA such as omega-3-fatty acids, as the primary intervention. This can be supplemented drug therapies such as statin monotherapy or combination therapy with niacin/fibrates.

However, aspirin is associated with potential complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke, and statins are associated with myopathy. We developed a simulation disease model to study the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of aspirin and statin chemoprevention against esophageal adenocarcinoma. A decision analytic Markov model was constructed to compare four strategies for Barrett's esophagus management; all regimens included standard endoscopic surveillance regimens: (i) endoscopic surveillance alone, (ii) aspirin therapy, (iii) statin therapy, and (iv) combination therapy of aspirin and statin. Endpoints evaluated were life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years (QALY), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). Sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the impact of model input uncertainty on results. Assuming an annual progression rate of 0.33% per year from Barrett's esophagus to esophageal adenocarcinoma, aspirin therapy was more effective and cost less than (dominated) endoscopic surveillance alone. When combination therapy was compared with aspirin therapy, the ICER was $158,000/QALY, which was above our willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY. Statin therapy was dominated by combination therapy. When higher annual cancer progression rates were assumed in the model (0.5% per year), combination therapy was cost-effective compared with aspirin therapy, producing an ICER of $96,000/QALY. In conclusion, aspirin chemoprevention was both more effective and cost less than endoscopic surveillance alone. Combination therapy using both aspirin and statin is expensive but could be cost-effective in patients at higher risk of progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma.",

Although statins decrease the incidence of CVD in T2D, residual cardiovascular risk remains high despite the achievement of optimal or near-optimal plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations. This may, in part, be due to uncorrected atherogenic dyslipidemia. Hypertriglyceridemia, the driving force behind diabetic dyslipidemia, results from hepatic overproduction and/or delayed clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. In patients treated with a statin to LDL-cholesterol goals, the addition of ezetimibe, fenofibrate, niacin, or n-3 fatty acid ethyl esters may be required to correct the persistent atherogenic dyslipidemia. Clinical trial evidence describing best practice is limited, but recent data supports the strategy of adding fenofibrate to a statin, and suggests specific benefits in dyslipidemic patients and in the improvement of diabetic retinopathy. However, based on results from a recent clinical trial, niacin should not be added to a statin in individuals with low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and very well controlled LDL-cholesterol.

Statins have an established efficacy in the management of dyslipidemia primarily by decreasing the levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and thus decreasing CVD risk. They also have a favorable safety profile. Despite the statin-mediated benefit of CVD risk reduction a residual CVD risk remains, especially in T2DM patients with high triglyceride (TG) and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) values. Fibrates decrease TG levels, increase HDL-C concentrations, and improve many other atherosclerosis-related variables. Fibrate/statin co-administration improves the overall lipoprotein profile in patients with mixed dyslipidemia and may reduce the residual CVD risk during statin therapy. However, limited data exists regarding the effects of statin/fibrate combination on CVD outcomes in patients with T2DM. In the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study the statin/fibrate combination did not significantly reduce the rate of CVD events compared with simvastatin/placebo in patients with T2DM. However, it did show a possible benefit in a pre-specified analysis in the subgroup of patients with high TG and low HDL-C levels. Furthermore, in the ACCORD study the simvastatin/fenofibrate combination significantly reduced the rate of progression of retinopathy compared with statin/placebo administration in patients with T2DM.

Endothelial dysfunction (ED), an early indicator of diabetic vascular disease, is common in T2D and independently predicts cardiovascular risk. Although the precise pathogenic mechanisms for ED in T2D remain unclear, at inception they probably involve uncoupling of both endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, as well as the activation of vascular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase. The major contributing factors include dyslipoproteinemia, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Therapeutic interventions are designed to target these pathophysiological factors that underlie ED. Therapeutic interventions, including lifestyle changes, antiglycemic agents and lipid-regulating therapies, aim to correct hyperglycemia and atherogenic dyslipidemia and to improve ED. However, high residual cardiovascular risk is seen in both research and clinical practice settings. Well-designed studies of endothelial function in appropriately selected volunteers afford a good opportunity to test new therapeutic interventions, paving the way for clinical trials and utilization in the care of the diabetic patient.

Diabetic glomerulopathy and the related albuminuria are the main manifestations of DKD. Numerous animal studies support the finding that glomerular atherosclerosis is the main mechanism of glomerulosclerosis in CKD and DKD. Some randomized, controlled trials suggest the use of statins for the prevention of albuminuria and renal function impairment in CKD and DKD patients. However, a large clinical study, the Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP), does not support that statins could reduce ESRD in CKD.

To reduce the risk of myopathy, in 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Drug Safety Communication set a new dose limitation for simvastatin, for patients taking simvastatin concomitantly with amlodipine. However, there is no such dose limitation for atorvastatin for patients receiving amlodipine. The combination pill formulation of amlodipine/atorvastatin is available on the market.

Simvastatin has an extensive first-pass effect in the intestinal wall, whereas atorvastatin has a smaller intestinal first-pass effect. The interaction with simvastatin seems mainly driven by CYP3A4 inhibition at the intestinal level, whereas the interaction with atorvastatin is more due to hepatic CYP3A4 inhibition. The interaction of CYP3A4 inhibitor with simvastatin has been more pronounced compared with atorvastatin. From the current data, atorvastatin seems to be a safer CYP3A4-statin for comedication with DHP-CCB. There is no convincing evidence that amlodipine is an unusual DHP-CCB, either as a precipitant drug or as an object drug, from the perspective of CYP3A4-mediated drug metabolism. Amlodipine may have interactions with CYP3A5 in addition to CYP3A4, which may explain its particular characteristics in comparison with other DHP-CCBs. The degree of DDIs between the DHP-CCB and statin and the clinical outcome depends on many factors, such as the kind of statin, physicochemical proprieties of the DHP-CCB, the dose of either the precipitant drug or the object drug, the sex of the patient (eg, isradipine-lovastatin), route of drug administration (eg, oral versus intravenous nicardipine-lovastatin), the administration schedule (eg, nonconcurrent dosing method versus concurrent dosing method), and the pharmacogenetic status (eg, CYP3A5-nonexpressers versus CYP3A5-expressers).",

Although there are reported cases of hepatotoxicity related to statins, very few are associated with severe course and liver failure. MATERIAL AND METHODS. We used the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III)-mortality linked files to assess the association between statin use and liver-related mortality. Patients with established causes of liver disease (HCV RNA-positive, HBs-Ag-positive, NAFLD by hepatic ultrasound, iron overload and excessive alcohol use of > 20 g of alcohol per day with elevated liver enzymes) were excluded. RESULTS. Of all adult NHANES III participants enrolled in 1988-1994 (n = 20,050), 9,207 individuals had sufficient demographic, clinical and medical information making them eligible for this study (age 41.26 \u00b1 0.38, 46.76% male, 76.67% Caucasian, BMI 26.39 \u00b1 0.38, 16.99% had diabetes or insulin resistance, 16.97% had hypertension, 65.28% had dyslipidemia). Of the entire study cohort, 90 (1.25%) participants reported using statins at the time of the interview. Median mortality follow-up for the study cohort was 175.54 months. During this period, 1,330 individuals (11.25%) died with 26 (0.17%) being liver-related deaths. For the cohort using statins, there were 37 deaths (40.15%) after a median follow-up of 143.35 months. In fact, the top cause of death for statin users was cardiac related (16 cases, 33.62%). However, after adjusting for major demographic, clinical and metabolic confounders, statin use was not associated with cardiovascular deaths in males (Hazard Ratio, 0.79, 95% Confidence Interval, 0.30-2.13), but was associated with higher risk of cardiovascular deaths in females (odds ratio, 2.32, 95% confidence interval, 1.58-3.40). Furthermore, the rate of liver-related mortality was significantly lower (p = 0.0035) among statin users compared to non-statin users. CONCLUSIONS. After a decade of follow up, there was no association between statin use and liver-related mortality.",

One of the reasons is the lack of reendothelialization related to inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation and migration since drug is delivered to the luminal surface. Statins can promote angiogenic processes by improving endothelial function, proliferation and migration in cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMECs). This study clarified the effect of simvastatin on Akt/mTOR/p70 S6K and FoxO3a signalling pathways in rat CMECs following pretreated with rapamycin. Rapamycin treatment for 24 h inhibited CMECs' proliferation, migration and NO (nitric oxide) secretion, but with increased cell apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In contrast, simvastatin pretreatment significantly improved proliferation, migration and NO secretion, and inhibited CMECs' apoptosis and ROS production in rapamycin-induced CMECs. Western blot assay showed that, after treatment with simvastatin, the phosphorylation of Akt/mTOR/p70 S6K and FoxO3a were up-regulated in rapamycin-induced CMECs, which was significantly reversed by pretreatment with LY294002. The data suggest that simvastatin inhibits rapamycin-induced CMECs dysfunction and apoptosis, probably through activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR/p70 S6K and mTOR/FoxO3a signalling pathway in a sequential manner and this pathway may be important in some of the pleiotropic effects of statins.",

One of the trials was a pilot trial in which 16 participants with biopsy-proven NASH were randomised to receive simvastatin 40 mg (n = 10) or placebo (n = 6) once daily for 12 months. No statistically significant improvement in the aminotransferase level was seen in the simvastatin group compared with the placebo group.

There were no statistically significant differences between any of the three intervention groups regarding the week 54 mean activity levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and alkaline phosphatase. The triglyceride levels seemed higher in the fenofibrate group compared with the atorvastatin group. Liver histology was not assessed in this trial. The presence of biochemical and ultrasonographic evidence of NAFLD seemed to be higher in the fenofibrate group compared with the atorvastatin group (58% versus 33%). Three patients discontinued treatment due to myalgia and elevated serum creatine kinase activity; one from the atorvastatin group and two from the combination group. Another patient from the atorvastatin group discontinued treatment due to alanine aminotransferase activity that was over three times the upper normal limit.No data for all-cause mortality and hepatic-related mortality were reported in the included trials.",

Trials with larger sample sizes and low risk of bias are necessary before we may suggest statins as an effective treatment for patients with NASH.

Conversely, loss-of-function mutations are associated with lower concentrations of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and reduced coronary heart disease. As these loss-of-function mutations are not associated with apparent deleterious effects, PCSK9 inhibition is an attractive new strategy for lowering LDL-C concentration. Among the various approaches to PCSK9 inhibition, human data are only available for inhibition of PCSK9 binding to LDLR by monoclonal antibodies. In phase II studies, the two most advanced monoclonal antibodies in development (alirocumab and evolocumab) decreased atherogenic lipoproteins very effectively and were well tolerated. A dramatic decrease in LDL-C up to 70% can be obtained with the most efficacious doses. Efficacy has been evaluated so far in addition to statins in hypercholesterolaemic patients with or without familial hypercholesterolaemia, in patients with intolerance to statin therapy and in monotherapy.

However, statins have not been clearly shown to increase diabetic microvascular complications (retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy). Thus, the clinical significance of increased glucose levels in patients treated on statins is uncertain. While the exact mechanism for how statins increase the risk of diabetes is unknown, a possible explanation is through a reduction in adiponectin levels. Despite the fact that higher statin doses are more likely to lead to new-onset diabetes, for every case of diabetes caused, there are approximately three cardiovascular events reduced with high dose versus moderate dose statin therapy.

Inflammatory exudates were collected and measured. Oxidative stress was assessed by measuring exudates' malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO). Inflammatory mediator C-reactive protein (CRP) was investigated using slide agglutination test. Exudates' levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-4 were measured by ELISA. We found that simvastatin alone or in combination with aspirin exerts anti-inflammatory effects by reducing volume of exudates. Simvastatin significantly reduced serum level of CRP and exudates levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and MDA as well as significantly elevated exudates level of NO and IL-4. The results of simvastain were comparable to those of aspirin. In conclusion, air pouch granuloma interrupted the balance between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers, which is restored by simvastatin. The anti-inflammatory effects of simvastatin are comparable to aspirin and their combination may produce better effects especially in the attenuation of the oxidative stress and IL-6.", 
    "144": "Elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) increase the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), and statin therapy to decrease LDL-C significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular events. Despite the effectiveness of statin therapy, there remains a significant residual cardiovascular risk. A low plasma concentration of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is associated with an increased risk of CHD. However, recent clinical trials aimed at reducing the CHD risk by raising HDL-C levels have not shown satisfactory results, and it is becoming evident that a functional HDL-C is a more desirable target than simply elevating its level. This review summarizes the function of HDL-C in reverse cholesterol transfer from peripheral tissue and discusses the latest HDL-targeting therapeutic strategies including the manipulation of microRNAs.",

The present post hoc analysis examined if arterial stiffness was improved with high-dose atorvastatin treatment in healthy adults and whether PA levels magnified this response. We utilized data from a double-blind, random-assignment clinical trial investigating the effects of atorvastatin 80\u2009mg/d for 6\u2009mo on skeletal muscle symptoms. Methods. Central and peripheral arterial pulse wave velocity (PWV) were measured and PA levels assessed at baseline and 6\u2009mo in subjects randomized to atorvastatin (n = 21, 9 men) or placebo (n = 29, 16 men). Results. Baseline participant characteristics, PWV, and PA levels were not different between treatments. Central (means \u00b1 SD; 8.7 \u00b1 2.6 to 9.0 \u00b1 2.5\u2009m/sec) and peripheral PWV (9.9 \u00b1 1.3 to 9.8 \u00b1 1.6\u2009m/sec) were unchanged from baseline following atorvastatin treatment (time \u00d7 drug interaction: P \u2265 0.13). Similarly, PA levels were unaffected by time or treatment. In sex and age adjusted models, baseline levels of PA were not related to changes in PWV with atorvastatin treatment. Conclusion. These data indicate that high-dose atorvastatin treatment for 6\u2009mo does not influence arterial stiffness in healthy adults. Participation in habitual PA did not magnify the vascular effects of statin therapy. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00609063.",

However, how the expression of RHAMM is regulated remains elusive. Statins, inhibitors of mevalonate metabolic pathway widely used for hypercholesterolemia, have been found to also have antitumor effects, but little is known of the specific targets and mechanisms. Moreover, Hippo signaling pathway plays crucial roles in organ size control and cancer development, yet its downstream transcriptional targets remain obscure. Here we show that RHAMM expression is regulated by mevalonate and Hippo pathways converging onto Yes-associated protein (YAP)/TEAD, which binds RHAMM promoter at specific sites and controls its transcription and consequently breast cancer cell migration and invasion (BCCMI); and that simvastatin inhibits BCCMI via targeting YAP-mediated RHAMM transcription. Required for ERK phosphorylation and BCCMI, YAP-activated RHAMM transcription is dependent on mevalonate and sensitive to simvastatin, which modulate RHAMM transcription by modulating YAP phosphorylation and nuclear-cytoplasmic localization. Further, modulation by mevalonate/simvastatin of YAP-activated RHAMM transcription requires geranylgeranylation, Rho GTPase activation, and actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, but is largely independent of MST and LATS kinase activity. These findings from in vitro and in vivo investigations link mevalonate and Hippo pathways with RHAMM as a downstream effector, a YAP-transcription and simvastatin-inhibition target, and a cancer metastasis mediator; uncover a mechanism regulating RHAMM expression and cancer metastases; and reveal a mode whereby simvastatin exerts anticancer effects; providing potential targets for cancer therapeutic agents.",

These conditions result from chronic immune activation after exposure to environmental risk factors in individuals with a predisposing genetic background. A strong association of autoantibodies with distinct clinical phenotypes and prognosis is found in patients with myositis. Inflammatory myopathies, sporadic IBM excluded, are amenable to immunosuppressive and immunomodulation therapies.

Furthermore, the addition of pomegranate juice (or punicalagin, but not beta sitosterol) to simvastatin significantly increased the statin ability to protect the cells from oxidative stress.

Sham-operated or 2K1C hypertensive rats were treated with vehicle, atorvastatin (50\u00a0mg/Kg), sildenafil (45\u00a0mg/Kg), or both for 8 weeks. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was monitored weekly. Nitrite concentrations were assessed in the aortas and in plasma samples by ozone-based reductive chemiluminescence assay. Aortic rings were isolated to assess endothelium-dependent and independent relaxation. Aortic NADPH activity and ROS production were evaluated by luminescence and dihydroethidium, respectively, and plasma TBARS levels were measured. Aortic nitrotyrosine staining was evaluated to assess peroxynitrite formation. Atorvastatin and sildenafil, alone or combined, significantly lowered SBP by approximately 40\u00a0mmHg. Atorvastatin significantly increased vascular nitrite levels by 70% in hypertensive rats, whereas sildenafil had no effects. Both drugs significantly improved the vascular function, and decreased vascular NADPH activity, ROS, and nitrotyrosine levels. Lower plasma TBARS concentrations were found with both treatments. The combination of drugs showed no improved responses compared to each drug alone. These findings show evidence that atorvastatin, but not sildenafil, increases vascular NO stores, although both drugs exert antioxidant effects, improve endothelial function, and lower blood pressure in 2K1C hypertension.", 
    "205": "The levels of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in ischemic stroke have not been studied extensively and reported results are inconsistent. We aimed to investigate the time course, the prognostic relevance, and the variables associated with EPC counts in patients with ischemic stroke at different time points.", 
    "206": "We studied prospectively 146 consecutive patients with ischemic stroke within the first 48 h from the onset of symptoms (baseline). We evaluated demographic data, classical vascular risk factors, treatment with thrombolysis and statins, stroke etiology, National Institute of Health and Stroke Scale score and outcome (favorable when Rankin scale score 0-2). Blood samples were collected at baseline, at day 7 after stroke (n = 121) and at 3 months (n = 92). The EPC were measured by flow cytometry.", 
    "207": "We included 146 patients with a mean age of 70.8 \u00b1 12.2 years. The circulating EPC levels were higher on day 7 than at baseline or at 3 months (P = 0.045). Pretreatment with statins (odds ratio [OR] 3.11, P = 0.008) and stroke etiology (P = 0.032) were predictive of EPC counts in the baseline sample. EPC counts were not associated with stroke severity or functional outcome in all the patients. However, using multivariate analyses, a better functional outcome was found in patients with higher EPC counts in large-artery atherosclerosis and small-vessel disease etiologic subtypes.", 
    "208": "After acute ischemic stroke, circulating EPC counts peaked at day 7. Pretreatment with statins increased the levels of EPC. In patients with large-artery atherosclerosis and small-vessel disease subtypes, higher counts were related to better outcome at 3 months.", 
    "209": "There is abundant epidemiologic evidence to support the independent, inverse relationship between low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and incident cardiovascular (CV) risk, the clinical importance of which is underscored by the high prevalence of low HDL-C in populations with coronary heart disease (CHD), with or without elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The National Cholesterol Education Program recommended that optimal treatment for high-risk patients includes both lowering LDL-C and non-HDL-C to risk stratified levels and raising HDL-C when it is <40 mg/dL, although no target level for the latter lipoprotein was suggested. Niacin is the most powerful agent currently available for raising low levels of HDL-C. It also induces significant reductions in triglycerides, lipoprotein(a), and LDL-C levels while also favorably altering LDL particle size and number. In the Coronary Drug Project, niacin treatment was associated with significant reductions in CV events and long-term mortality, similar to the reductions seen in the statin monotherapy trials. In combination trials, niacin plus a statin or bile acid sequestrant produces additive reductions in CHD morbidity and mortality and promotes regression of coronary atherosclerosis. Recently, 2 clinical outcome trials (Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome With Low HDL/High Triglycerides and Impact on Global Health Outcomes [AIM-HIGH] and Second Heart Protection Study [HPS-2 THRIVE]) failed to show a reduction in CV events in patients treated to optimally low levels of LDL-C. Despite favorable effects on HDL-C and triglycerides, these studies did not demonstrate incremental clinical benefit with niacin when added to simvastatin, although notable limitations were identified in each of these trials. Thus, there is insufficient evidence from clinical trials to recommend HDL-targeted therapy for additional event reduction at the present time. However, niacin should continue to be used as an adjuvant therapy for reducing atherogenic lipoprotein burden in patients who have not reached their risk stratified LDL-C and non-HDL-C targets.", 
    "210": "SNX8 is a PX-BAR domain sub-family of sorting nexins (SNXs), which is reported as a \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) toxicity enhancer and associated with Alzheimer's disease. We have also described SNX8 as a novel activator of the sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) transcription factor, a major regulator of cholesterol homeostasis. In that study, we have showed that SNX8 reduced an insulin-induced gene (INSIG)-dependent block of SREBP-mediated transcription. Here, for the first time, we investigated the expression and function of SNX8 within the CNS. We found that SNX8 was expressed within neurons, but not astrocytes or microglia, with neuronal localisation primarily in the soma. The protein levels of neuronal SNX8 were unchanged in the presence of moderately high cholesterol but were decreased by mevinolin (a cholesterol-lowering statin) and U18666a (which causes cholesterol to accumulate within the lysosome). To determine if SNX8 overexpression alters the levels of cholesterol, we engineered a GFP-SNX8 lentivirus. The overexpression of GFP-SNX8 had no effect on cholesterol in neurons under control conditions or in already strongly altered cholesterol conditions of mevinolin or U18666a. In contrast, in moderately high cholesterol, the overexpression of GFP-SNX8 caused redistribution of cholesterol within neurons creating a phenotype similar to U18666a treatment. Taken together, these data suggest that extreme changes in cholesterol reduce SNX8 expression and that overexpression of SNX8 exacerbates aberrant handling of neuronal cholesterol. This work further supports the role for SNX8 in regulating cholesterol levels, which could be important in understanding its role as an A\u03b2 toxicity enhancer and its association with Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "211": "The Food and Drug Administration recently updated the safety warning concerning the association between statin therapy and new-onset diabetes mellitus (NODM). For prediabetes, little information is available for statins on cardiovascular outcome reduction and diabetogenic consequences. This study aimed to examine the risk of NODM and the reduction of cardiovascular events and death (MACE) after statin therapy in the prediabetic subjects. The medical and pharmacy claims of the prediabetic beneficiaries were retrieved from Taiwan National Health Insurance research database. The occurrence of NODM, MACE, and morbidity indexed by hospitalizations and emergency visits was ascertained by ambulatory and inpatient database. A propensity score-matched model was constructed for statin users and nonusers. During follow-up (4.1 \u00b1 2.5 years), NODM and MACE occurred in 23.5% and 16.7%, respectively, of nonusers and 28.5% and 12.0%, respectively, of users. Statin therapy was associated with a greater risk of NODM (hazard ratio 1.20, 95% confidence interval 1.08 to 1.32) and less risk of MACE (hazard ratio 0.70, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 0.80), both in dose-dependent fashions. The earlier and more persistent use correlated with the greater increase in risk of NODM offset by the proportionally larger reduction in MACE. Furthermore, the early persistent users had the lowest rate of hospitalizations and emergency visits. In conclusion, our findings suggested that the relation between NODM and therapeutic advantages of statins was parallel in the prediabetic population. Treatment benefits outweighed diabetic consequences in subjects receiving the earlier and more persistent treatment.", 
    "212": "Diabetic patients are at the risk of cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) and arterial stiffness. This study aimed to investigate the association of heart rate variability (HRV) as an index for CAN and pulse wave velocity (PWV) as an index for arterial stiffness.", 
    "213": "Uncomplicated diabetes type-2 patients who had no apparent history of cardiovascular condition underwent HRV and PWV measurements and the results were compared with the control group consisting of non-diabetic peers. Also, the findings were adjusted for the cardiovascular risk factors and other confounding factors.", 
    "214": "A total of 64 diabetic patients (age= 52.08\u00b18.50 years; males=33 [51.6%]) were compared with 57 controls (age= 48.74\u00b16.18 years; males=25 [43.9%]) in this study. Hypertension, dyslipidemia, and thereby systolic blood pressure and statin use were significantly more frequent in the diabetic group, while the serum levels of cholesterol, HDL-C and LDL-C were significantly higher in the controls. Pulse wave was significantly increased in the diabetic patients (p<0.001). Main HRV parameters were significantly lower in diabetics than in controls. After adjustment for the confounders, PWV and HRV remained significantly different between the groups (p=0.01 and p=0.004, respectively). Multiple logistic regression of the association between pulse wave velocity and HRV index was independently significant both in diabetics and controls.", 
    "215": "There exists a significant relationship between heart rate variability and arterial stiffness as a measure for atherosclerosis in diabetic patients, although the role of the confounding factors is noteworthy.", 
    "216": "Necrotizing myopathies (NM) are defined by histological features. Muscle biopsy demonstrates marked muscle necrosis with regeneration, with little or an absence of inflammatory infiltrate. Histological pattern of NM is unspecific and can be encountered in diverse conditions as acquired myopathies and muscular dystrophies. Among acquired forms of NM, necrotizing autoimmune myopathy (NAM) is a recently recognized sub-group of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. Classically, patients present with a subacute severe proximal myopathy, associated with a markedly elevated creatine kinase level, usually greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal. Nevertheless, the clinical presentation can be misleading, with chronic course mimicking muscular dystrophy. Different forms of NAM can be distinguished with various underlying inciting conditions, including autoantibodies to the SRP, autoantibodies to the HMG-CoA reductase, association to connective tissue disease or underlying malignancy. Other associated conditions need yet to be identified. To confirm a diagnosis of NAM, other causes of NM should be excluded as toxic myopathies, muscular dystrophies and other inflammatory myopathies with a misleading histological pattern. NAM is a rare condition but is probably underdiagnosed. Both clinicoserologic and pathologic data must be taken into account to improve this diagnosis. We propose guidelines for diagnosis of NAM according to clinical course, to be used in clinical practice.", 
    "217": "Natural killer cells comprise the body's first line of defense against virus-infected cells. As is true of all lymphocytes, natural killer cell malignancies can develop, however natural killer cell leukemias can be very difficult to treat due to their intrinsic resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. With the recent understanding that statin drugs may have anti-cancer properties, our investigations have focused on the ability of statins to inhibit the growth and cytotoxicity of the YT-INDY natural killer cell leukemia cell line.", 
    "218": "Our findings indicate that several statin compounds can inhibit YT-INDY proliferation disrupt cell cycle progression and abrogate natural killer cell cytotoxicity. Since natural killer cell leukemia cytotoxicity may play a role in the pulmonary damage seen in these patients, this is an important finding. Cytotoxicity, proliferation and cell cycle progression could be restored by the addition of mevalonate, signifying that the statin effects are brought about through HMG CoA reductase inhibition. The mevalonate pathway intermediate geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, but not other intermediates in the mevalonate pathway, partially reversed statin-induced inhibition of YT-INDY proliferation and cytotoxicity. These results suggest that blockage of products made in the latter part of the mevalonate pathway may account for the observed inhibitory effects on YT-INDY proliferation and cytotoxicity. However, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate could not reverse the statin-induced inhibition of the cell cycle.", 
    "219": "These results suggest that the statin drugs should be investigated as a potential therapeutic strategy for human natural killer cell leukemias possibly in combination with chemotherapeutic agents.",

The aim of this paper is to describe time trends for treatment and outcome data, and to discuss if any such changes could be attributed to quality changes in stroke care.", 
    "221": "Data from Riks-Stroke, the Swedish stroke register, were analyzed for the time period of 1995 through 2010. The total number of patients included was 320,181. The following parameters were included: use of computed tomography (CT), stroke unit care, thrombolysis, medication before and after the stroke, length of stay in hospital, and discharge destination. Three months after stroke, data regarding walking, toileting and dressing ability, as well social situation, were gathered. Survival status after 7, 27 and 90 days was registered.", 
    "222": "In 1995, 53.9% of stroke patients were treated in stroke units. In 2010 this proportion had increased to 87.5%. Fewer patients were discharged to geriatric or rehabilitation departments in later years (23.6% in 2001 compared with 13.4% in 2010), but more were discharged directly home (44.2 vs. 52.4%) or home with home rehabilitation (0 vs. 10.7%). The need for home help service increased from 18.2% in 1995 to 22.1% in 2010. Regarding prevention, more patients were on warfarin, antihypertensives and statins both before and after the stroke. The functional outcome measures after 3 months did improve from 2001 to 2010. In 2001, 83.8% of patients were walking independently, while 85.6% were independent in 2010. For toileting, independence increased from 81.2 to 84.1%, and for dressing from 78.0 to 80.4%. Case fatality (CF) rates after 3 months increased from 18.7% (2001) to 20.0% (2010). This trend is driven by patients with severe strokes.", 
    "223": "Stroke outcomes may change over a relatively short time period. In some ways, the quality of care has improved. More stroke patients have CT, more patients are treated in stroke units and more have secondary prevention. Patients with milder strokes may have benefited more from these measures than patients with severe strokes. Increased CF rates for patients with severe stroke may be caused by shorter hospital stays, shorter in-hospital rehabilitation periods and lack of suitable care after discharge from hospital.",

Although extensively studied for decades, recent data on coenzyme Q have painted an exciting albeit incomplete picture of the multiple facets of this molecule's function. In humans, mutations in the genes involved in the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q lead to a heterogeneous group of rare disorders, with most often severe and debilitating symptoms. In this review, we describe the current understanding of coenzyme Q biosynthesis, provide a detailed overview of human coenzyme Q deficiencies and discuss the existing mouse models for coenzyme Q deficiency. Furthermore, we briefly examine the current state of affairs in non-mitochondrial coenzyme Q functions and the latter's link to statin.",

Plasma levels of lipids, apolipoproteins, glucose homeostasis markers, leptin, adiponectin, visfatin, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), free fatty acids (FFA), and high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were determined on the allocation day and after 12\u00a0weeks of therapy.", 
    "233": "Apart from improving lipid profile, simvastatin administered alone or in combination with ezetimibe, decreased plasma levels of hsCRP, FFA, leptin, visfatin, and TNF-\u03b1, as well as increased plasma levels of adiponectin. The combination therapy was superior to simvastatin in influencing plasma lipids/lipoproteins, hsCRP, FFA, and the investigated adipokines. The effect of the combination therapy, but not of simvastatin, on systemic inflammation and plasma adipokines was stronger in insulin-resistant than in insulin-sensitive subjects.",
