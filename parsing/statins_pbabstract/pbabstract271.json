This review focuses on a number of extended analyses from these trials that may relate to the success or failure of fibrate therapy and indicate who might likely benefit from this therapy.", 
    "1": "Results have been far from uniform and several trials have been adversely impacted by high off-trial statin use. Collective evidence suggests, however, that fibrates have optimum cardiovascular benefit in diabetes or other manifestations of insulin resistance. Much of this evidence comes from posttrial analysis in subgroups with more sharply defined clinical characteristics than in the overall trial population. Analyses also suggest that different fibrates have a different range of favorable clinical properties, that the cardiovascular benefit of fibrates may not be readily measured or mostly predicted by changes in traditional lipid measurements, and that other nonlipid properties of fibrates as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agents might explain some of the benefit of these drugs.", 
    "2": "Results of major clinical endpoint trials with fibrates, although not uniformly positive, provide substantial evidence for a selective therapeutic role of these drugs in cardiovascular event reduction in diabetes or insulin resistance.",

    "4": "Four large-scale randomized trials have compared high-dose vs. standard doses of statin therapy among patients with coronary heart disease, and their results suggest that higher doses are more effective for preventing major vascular events, albeit with evidence of increased toxicity. There is now clear evidence that statin therapy is effective among most patients with type 2 diabetes, although uncertainty remains about the benefits in those with advanced nephropathy. Ongoing trials will assess whether statin therapy is beneficial among patients with noncoronary vascular disease (such as congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, or aortic stenosis), and among people with comorbid conditions or risk factors that increase the risk of vascular disease (including chronic kidney disease and raised C-reactive protein with below average low-density lipoprotein cholesterol).",

    "6": "Ubiquitin (Ub)-fold proteins are rapidly emerging as an important class of eukaryotic modifiers, which often exert their influence by post-translational addition to other intracellular proteins. Despite assuming a common beta-grasp three-dimensional structure, their functions are highly diverse because of distinct surface features and targets and include tagging proteins for selective breakdown, nuclear import, autophagic recycling, vesicular trafficking, polarized morphogenesis, and the stress response. Here we describe a novel family of Membrane-anchored Ub-fold (MUB) proteins that are present in animals, filamentous fungi, and plants. Extending from the C terminus of the Ub-fold is typically a cysteine-containing CAAX (where A indicates aliphatic amino acid) sequence that can direct the attachment of either a 15-carbon farnesyl or a 20-carbon geranylgeranyl moiety in vitro. Modified forms of several MUBs were detected in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana, suggesting that these MUBs are prenylated in vivo. Both cell fractionation and confocal microscopic analyses of Arabidopsis plants expressing GFP-MUB fusions showed that the modified forms are membrane-anchored with a significant enrichment on the plasma membrane. This plasma membrane location was blocked in vivo in prenyltransferase mutants and by mevinolin, which inhibits the synthesis of prenyl groups. In addition to the five MUBs with CAAX boxes, Arabidopsis has one MUB variant with a cysteine-rich C terminus distinct from the CAAX box that is also membrane-anchored, possibly through the attachment of a long chain acyl group. Although the physiological role(s) of MUBs remain unknown, the discovery of these prenylated forms further expands the diversity and potential functions of Ub-fold proteins in eukaryotic biology.",

    "8": "Clinical trials provide preliminary evidence that the perioperative process can influence long-term patient outcome. Immunology may begin to elucidate the biology of this safety concern and open new therapeutic opportunities. In this context, awareness of the immunological properties of drugs administered in the perioperative period may assist in their deliberate use to modulate this risk. Statins, beta-blockers, and clonidine can potentially improve long-term cardiac risk. Volatile anesthetics appear to suppress effector functions of both the innate and adaptive immunity, assist tumor growth in animal models, and facilitate aggregation of certain neurodegenerative disease proteins. Local anesthetics block neurons, but are also potent antiinflammatory drugs. Morphine has recognized immunosuppressive functions, which the newer, synthetic opioids don't seem to share. The cholinergic nervous system has antiinflammatory control functions that are largely unexploited.",

Cases of fatal MI were identified by linkage to Statistics Norway using each subject's individual personal number. Cases of non-fatal MI were extracted from the hospital records. Cox proportional hazards regression models estimated relationships between changes in total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations and smoking status and the primary endpoints up to 16 years following the end of the trial.", 
    "15": "At 5 and 10 years following the end of the trial the incidence of MI among the 604 men in the intervention (I) and 628 in the control (C) group differed significantly (5-year event rate (I/C) =0.059/0.090; P=0.038 and 10-year event rate (I/C) =0.111/0.155; P=0.023), but the difference faded slowly and subsequently (P=0.069 at 16 years). The reduction in MI in the intervention group was primarily explained by the differences in total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations between the groups.", 
    "16": "This extended follow-up of the Oslo Diet and Antismoking Study found a prolonged benefit of the intervention lasting for at least a decade after the close of the trial. This finding is in accordance with statin and other studies showing that the effect of cholesterol lowering may be prolonged after the end of the intervention.",

However, it remains unknown whether post-infarction treatment with simvastatin can also reduce myocardial no-reflow for which suppression of adenosine triphosphate-sensitive K+ (K(ATP)) channel opening is an important mechanism.", 
    "18": "Area at risk and the area of no-reflow were determined by myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) and by pathology in 45 mini-swine randomised into 5 groups: 10 control, 9 simvastatin, 9 glibenclamide, 9 simvastatin plus glibenclamide and 8 sham-operated. A myocardial infarction and reperfusion model was created by 3-h occlusion of the coronary artery followed by 4 weeks of reperfusion.", 
    "19": "Compared with the control group, simvastatin significantly increased coronary blood volume (P<0.01) and decreased the area of no-reflow measured by MCE (78.5+/-4.5% to 43.7+/-4.3%) and pathological evaluation (82.3+/-1.9% to 45.2+/-3.8%) of area at risk (P<0.01). Simvastatin also increased the levels of K(ATP) channel proteins (SUR2 and Kir6.2) (P<0.05), but had no effect on necrosis area. The combination of simvastatin and glibenclamide had no significant effect on the above parameters.",

    "21": "Despite major improvement in surgical techniques and intensive care management, stroke remains one of the most devastating complications of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). We aimed to determine factors predicting the occurrence of stroke during CABG. A special interest was focused on preoperative therapies.", 
    "22": "We prospectively enrolled 810 consecutive candidates for CABG alone in a specific database, including all pre- and perioperative data (history, clinical, therapeutic, cardiac catheterization, surgical and intensive care data). Univariate tests and then multiple logistic regression analysis were used to determine independent predictive factors.", 
    "23": "During the first postoperative month, stroke occurred in 11 cases and transient ischemic attack (TIA) in 4 additive cases (cumulative rate: 1.85%). After the multivariate analysis, the following factors remained significant (p<0.05) in the predictive model, with corresponding odds ratios between brackets: redo cardiac surgery (7.45), unstable cardiac status (4.74), past history of cerebrovascular disease (4.14), past history of peripheral arterial disease (3.55), whereas the presence of preoperative statins was protective (0.24, 95% IC: 0.07-0.78). The addition of perioperative data (aortic calcification, postoperative arrhythmia, on/off-pump surgery) did not change the final predictive model.", 
    "24": "To our knowledge, this is the first real-world observational report highlighting the interest of statins for the prevention of stroke in the very special situation of CABG. Even though according to randomized trials coronary patients have a benefit from these drugs, a special level of interest should be directed towards those presenting the above-mentioned risk factors.", 
    "25": "Degenerative aortic valve stenosis is a common disease in western countries. When it becomes severe, it confers significant morbidity and mortality. Aortic stenosis has been recognized as a complex inflammatory and highly regulated process with histological and immunochemical similarities with the process of atherosclerosis. Hypertension, smoking and diabetes mellitus have consistently been linked to the development of aortic stenosis. Endothelial injury or other processes that contribute to coronary disease may play a role in calcific aortic stenosis. Several observational studies suggests that the key factors of aortic stenosis are lipoproteins and that medical therapies with cholesterol lowering drugs may retard its progression. Similarly, it has been suggested that the process of degeneration of the tissue heart valve has been associated with the same risk factors of atherosclerosis and shares many histological and molecular characteristics. Assuming all this concept, and evaluating the results of a retrospective study it has been suggested to use statin also as medical therapy able to prevent tissue valve degeneration. Randomized controlled clinical trials will be needed to demonstrate the role of lipid intervention to prevent the progression of aortic stenosis and the degeneration of tissue heart valves.", 
    "26": "Lymphocyte function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1; CD11a/CD18) is an important mediator of leukocyte migration and T cell activation. We previously showed that antithymocyte globulin stimulates an independent, non-neuronal cholinergic system in T cells via LFA-1-mediated pathways, as evidenced by increases in acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) mRNA expression. The cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin inhibits LFA-1 signaling by binding to an allosteric site on CD11a (LFA-1 alpha chain), which leads to immunomodulation. In the present study, we investigated whether simvastatin modulates lymphocytic cholinergic activity in T cells. We found that anti-CD11a monoclonal antibody (mAb) increased ChAT activity, ACh synthesis and release, and expression of ChAT and M5 muscarinic ACh receptor mRNA in MOLT-3 cells, a human leukemic T cell line. Simvastatin abolished these anti-CD11a mAb-induced increases in lymphocytic cholinergic activity in a manner independent of its cholesterol-lowering activity. These results indicate that LFA-1 contributes to the regulation of lymphocytic cholinergic activity via CD11a-mediated pathways, and suggest that simvastatin exerts its immunosuppressive effects in part via modification of lymphocytic cholinergic activity.", 
    "27": "Cardiac syndrome X (CSX), or angina with no flow-limiting stenosis on coronary angiogram, has been regarded as a condition with an excellent prognosis despite variable symptomatic improvement. Newer data show that patients with CSX with endothelial dysfunction have an increased risk for future adverse cardiac events. Current hypotheses of CSX pathophysiology emphasize a dysfunctional vascular endothelium that leads to microvascular ischemia. Treatments that target improving endothelial function, such as statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, estrogen, and lifestyle modification, are promising additions to treatment regimens for CSX. The goal of this article is to provide information for improved diagnosis, risk stratification, and therapy for the population with CSX.", 
    "28": "Treatment with statins reduces coronary risk In all people but do not remove the risk associated with a low HDL-C or with other features of the metabolic syndrome such as an elevated level of plasma triglyceride or with a high BMI. Treatment with a fibrate such as gemfibrozil (a PPAR alpha agonist) has been shown to be especially effective in people with low HDL-C and other features of the metabolic syndrome. Potential beneficial effects of the combination of a statin and an agent with PPAR alpha activity in patients with type 2 diabetes is currently being addressed in the ongoing Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study.", 
    "29": "This study was undertaken to explore the possibility that cholesterol deficiency may perturb the physiological functions of astrocytes, thus rendering cells vulnerable to the cytotoxicity induced by glutamate (Glu). Cholesterol deprivation induces astrocyte stellation, which is accompanied by disruption of cortical actin, and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in an astrocyte-specific manner. Moreover, cholesterol reduction decreases the activity of glutamine synthetase (GS) while enhancing the capacity of Glu transporter. Using [(3)H]d-aspartate as a tracer, we found a marked efflux of [(3)H]d-aspartate from cholesterol-deficient astrocytes after Glu stimulation. Changes in the actin cytoskeleton, cell morphology, ERK phosphorylation and GS level gradually recovered in astrocytes after the withdrawal of cholesterol depletion. Moreover, withdrawal of cholesterol deprivation attenuated cell loss in cholesterol-deficient astrocytes during Glu exposure. Taken together, our data suggest that, upon Glu exposure, there would be an increase in intracellular Glu as a consequence of enhanced Glu uptake and reduced degradation of Glu by GS in cholesterol-deficient astrocytes. This in turn leads to a concentration gradient favoring Glu release, thereby causing the accumulation of cytotoxic levels of Glu extracellularly. It is thus concluded that the detrimental effect of cholesterol deprivation may, in part, arise from the impairment in Glu homeostasis.", 
    "30": "The subjects of the study were 43 patients with II- III functional class coronary heart disease (CHD) and dyslipidemia, who received conventional cardial therapy. The patients were divided into two groups: group I (26 subjects) received vasilip, a simvastatin generic, in a dose of 20 mg a day; group 11 (17 subjects) received vasilip in a dose of 20 mg a day plus cudesan in a dose of 1 ml a day, which contained 30 mg of ubiquinone Q 10 and 4.5 mg of alpha-tocopherol. Effects of the therapies on blood lipids, their peroxides, and the antioxidative status of blood were studied. After one month, vasilip was effective in achieving the target level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in 62% of group I patients and 65% of group II patients; at the same time, its use led to a significant increase in the level of primary and secondary lipid peroxidation (LP) products (25% and 29%, respectively), and lowering of the antioxidative status of blood, which consisted in a decrease in ceruloplasmin (CP) serum level and CP: transferrin (CP:TF) ratio by 6% in group I patients. The use of cudesan in combination with vasilip led to a significant decrease in the level of primary and secondary LP products (30% and 29%, respectively), and an increase in the level of serum CP by 25.7%, and CP: TF ratio by 12.5%.", 
    "31": "This study was carried out to elucidate the effect of a brain-permeable statin (lovastatin) on cholesterol and oxysterol levels of the hippocampus after neuronal injury induced by the excitotoxin, kainic acid. Increased immunolabeling to cholesterol and the oxysterol biosynthetic enzyme, cholesterol 24-hydroxylase, was observed in the rat hippocampus after kainate lesions. This was accompanied by increased levels of cholesterol, 24-hydroxycholesterol (product of cholesterol 24-hydroxylase enzymatic activity), and 7-ketocholesterol in homogenates of the degenerating hippocampus as detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Hippocampi from rats or organotypic slices that had been treated with kainate plus lovastatin showed significantly lower levels of cholesterol, 24-hydroxycholesterol, and 7-ketocholesterol compared with those that had been treated with kainate only. Lovastatin also modulated hippocampal neuronal loss after kainate treatment in vivo and in vitro. The level of 24-hydroxycholesterol detected in vivo after kainate treatment (>50 microM) was found to be neurotoxic in hippocampal slice cultures. These results suggest that brain-permeable statins such as lovastatin could have a neuroprotective effect by limiting the levels of oxysterol in brain areas undergoing neurodegeneration.", 
    "32": "Disturbed HDL metabolism in insulin-resistant, obese subjects may account for an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Fish oils and atorvastatin increase plasma HDL cholesterol, but the underlying mechanisms responsible for this change are not fully understood.", 
    "33": "We studied the independent and combined effects of fish oils and atorvastatin on the metabolism of HDL apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) and HDL apo A-II in obese men.", 
    "34": "We conducted a 6-wk randomized, placebo-controlled, 2 x 2 factorial intervention study of the effects of fish oils (4 g/d) and atorvastatin (40 mg/d) on the kinetics of HDL apo A-I and HDL apo A-II in 48 obese men with dyslipidemia with intravenous administration of [d3]-leucine. Isotopic enrichments of apo A-I and apo A-II were measured with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with kinetic parameters derived from a multicompartmental model (SAAM II).", 
    "35": "Fish oils and atorvastatin significantly decreased plasma triacylglycerols and increased HDL cholesterol and HDL2 cholesterol (P < 0.05 for main effects). A significant (P < 0.02) main effect of fish oils was observed in decreasing the fractional catabolic rate of HDL apo A-I and HDL apo A-II. This was coupled with a significant decrease in the corresponding production rates, accounting for a lack of treatment effect on plasma concentrations of apo A-I and apo A-II. Atorvastatin did not significantly alter the concentrations or kinetic parameters of HDL apo A-I and HDL apo A-II. None of the treatments altered insulin resistance.", 
    "36": "Fish oils, but not atorvastatin, influence HDL metabolism chiefly by decreasing both the catabolism and production of HDL apo A-I and HDL apo A-II in insulin-resistant obese men. Addition of atorvastatin to treatment with fish oils had no additional effect on HDL kinetics compared with fish oils alone.", 
    "37": "LMNA-associated progeroid syndromes have been reported with both recessive and dominant inheritance. We report a 2-year-old boy with an apparently typical Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) due to compound heterozygous missense mutations (p.T528M and p.M540T) in LMNA. Both mutations affect a conserved region within the C-terminal globular domain of A-type lamins, defining a progeria hot spot. The nuclei of the patient showed no prelamin A accumulation. In general, the nuclear phenotype did not correspond to that previously described for HGPS. Instead, honeycomb figures predominated and nuclear blebs with reduced/absent expression of B-type lamins could be detected. The healthy heterozygous parents showed similar nuclear changes, although in a smaller percentage of nuclei. Treatment with a farnesylation inhibitor resulted in accumulation of prelamin A at the nuclear periphery, in annular nuclear membrane plaques and in intra/trans-nuclear membrane invaginations. In conclusion, these findings suggest a critical role for the C-terminal globular lamin A/C region in nuclear structure and support a major contribution of abnormal assembly to the progeroid phenotype. In contrast to earlier suggestions, we show that prelamin A accumulation is not the major determinant of the progeroid phenotype.",

The volume and density of the bone fusion mass was quantified by computed tomography.", 
    "43": "Drug treatment for 9 weeks caused a reduction in serum lipid biochemical markers when compared with controls. The spinal fusion rate, as judged by manual palpation testing (13.0% control group, 16.6% Simvastatin group) and fine detail radiography, was not significantly different comparing treatment with control animals. Accordant with the assessment of spinal fusion, there was no statistically significant effect on the volume of the fusion mass (1,224.7+/-98.7 mm(3) in the control group and 1,075.9+/-66.3 mm(3) in the Simvastatin group), the density of bone in the lumbar spine or that in the formed fusion mass.", 
    "44": "Systemic use of Simvastatin caused a reduction in lipid biochemical parameters in treated animals. Successful spinal fusion as judged by manual palpation testing and fine detail radiography was not significantly different in treated versus untreated animals. The bone volume density of the formed fusion mass was not significantly different in treated versus untreated animals. There did not appear to be a significant advantage or disadvantage to the use of Simvastatin rabbit posterolateral spinal fusion. The potential positive effects of statins on bone require further study.",

The proportion of patients who switched from their initial statin varied across the statins (ranging from 7% to 34%). The proportion of patients who were 80% adherent to their treatment was significantly lower with the other CLA than with statins (43% vs 60%, P < .001). A composite index combining monthly persistence and adherence was calculated.

    "53": "Cells exposed to simvastatin or to methyl-beta-cyclodextrin show reduced poliovirus infection, without alteration in virus binding or on the kinetics of genome entry, suggesting that the steps which are altered are those post uncoating and genome entry. Reduction of infection by cyclodextrin is reversed by increasing MOI whereas that produced by simvastatin treatment is not, suggesting that the effects on infection are not due to a reduction in cholesterol. The differences in the characteristics of inhibition can be explained by the differential effects of the compounds. Cyclodextrin inhibits the store-operated calcium channels, suggesting that reduction in infection is through translational inhibition. Simvastatin produces vesicles from internal membranes which cannot sustain viral RNA synthesis, reducing infection through reduced transcription. The results indicate that the impact on viral infection by the cholesterol-modifying agents is due to the cellular changes produced rather than due to disruption of the cholesterol-rich domains.",

    "55": "Increased platelet activity plays a key role in atherothrombotic events. Persistent platelet activity has been reported in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) following myocardial infarction and in the chronic phase after ischemic stroke. However, platelet activity in patients with AF remains clear. This study investigated platelet reactivity (expressed by CD62p) in patients with chronic nonvalvular (NV) AF. Expression of CD62p was measured by flow cytometry in 62 consecutive patients with chronic NVAF (defined as sustained AF > 6 months) and no previous embolic events. The CD62p expression was also evaluated in 20 healthy subjects. Expression of CD62p was not different between AF patients and healthy subjects (P = 0.970). Additionally, CD62p expression did not differ between patients with and patients without the following atherosclerotic risk factors: hypertension, current smoking, and hypercholesterolemia (all P values > 0.1). Furthermore, CD62p expression did not differ between patients taking and not taking the following medications: warfarin, a statin, or an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker (all P values > 0.2). However, diabetes mellitus (DM) was strongly associated with increased CD62p expression (P < 0.0001). Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that only DM independently predicted increased CD62p expression (r2 = 0.509, regression coefficient = 3.044, P < 0.0001). In conclusion, compared to healthy subjects, CD62p expression was not significantly enhanced in chronic NVAF patients. However, CD62p expression was substantially elevated in diabetic patients with chronic NVAF.", 
    "56": "The importance of different lipid and lipoprotein measurements, including LDL particle concentration and levels of apolipoproteins and triglycerides, in the prediction of future cardiac events continues to be debated. In summary, apo B is a strong, independent predictor of initial and recurrent coronary events, even during statin treatment, and recent studies show its predictive superiority over LDL and non-HDL cholesterol. Importantly, determination of apo B levels is unaffected in a non-fasted or hypertriglyceridemic state and is not derived from other measurements. Thus, clear advantages exist for using apo B as a predictor of CHD. Likewise, triglycerides and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins are also strong, independent predictors of coronary events (initial and recurrent) during statin treatment. Triglycerides or especially triglyceride-rich lipoproteins with apo C-III may provide additional information to apo B. Apo C-III not only impairs lipoprotein metabolism but also stimulates directly the vascular inflammatory process. In contrast, evidence from large epidemiological studies is coalescing toward the view that small LDL size is more of a marker of these atherogenic triglyceride-rich lipoproteins than an independent predictor of CHD. Clearly, there remains considerable interest, both in terms of research and clinical practice, in the role of apo B, triglycerides, and specific apo B-containing lipoprotein particles as independent predictors of CHD risk as well as their potential to improve risk prediction and response to lipid-modifying treatment.",

    "62": "Elevated triglycerides are now considered an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease and continue to be a major risk for acute pancreatitis, especially when levels exceed 1000 mg/dL (SOR: B). Elevated triglycerides are a component of atherogenic dyslipidemia and often signal the presence of other conditions (eg, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus) associated with an increased cardiovascular risk (SOR: A). When evaluating a patient with elevated triglycerides, it is important to be cognizant of all atherogenic lipoproteins to more accurately determine the risk of coronary heart disease (SOR: C). Patients with hypertriglyceridemia should first achieve their low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal, followed by their non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal (SOR: C). Fibrates, niacin, and omega-3 acid ethyl esters are highly effective at reducing triglycerides, while statins are considered moderately efficacious (SOR: A).",

Although the impact of elevated cholesterol on stroke risk has been disputed, numerous trials using 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors (ie, statins) in patients with CHD have demonstrated a significant reduction in stroke incidence as a secondary endpoint. It is likely that statins are pleiotropic in stroke prevention, providing benefits through both cholesterol reduction and cholesterol-independent mechanisms. In this article, we review the relationship between cholesterol and stroke, randomized trials of statins in patients with CHD and high risk for CHD that have assessed stroke risk, and the putative mechanisms of stroke prevention by statins.", 
    "64": "CETP (cholesteryl ester transfer protein) and HL (hepatic lipase) play a role in the metabolism of plasma lipoproteins, but the effects of CETP and LIPC (gene encoding HL) genotypes on coronary atherosclerosis may be dependent on LDL (low-density lipoprotein)-receptor activity. Recently, the -1337 C>T polymorphism in the CETP gene has been reported in REGRESS (Regression Growth Evaluation Statin Study) to be a major determinant of promoter activity and plasma CETP concentration. In the present study, we have investigated the effects of the CETP promoter -1337 C>T and LIPC promoter -514 C>T polymorphisms on serum lipid profiles and risk of coronary atherosclerosis in 206 patients (154 males) with heterozygous FH (familial hypercholesterolaemia). To evaluate coronary atherosclerosis, we used CSI (coronary stenosis index) calculated from coronary angiograms. The CETP -1337 T allele was less frequent in subjects with a CSI > or =14 (mean value) in the group with coronary artery disease (P=0.04, as determined by chi(2) test). ANOVA revealed that HDL-C (high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol) and triacylglycerol (triglyceride) levels were not significantly higher in the presence of the CETP promoter -1337 T allele. Combined with LIPC promoter polymorphisms, HDL-C levels were highest and CSI were lowest with CETP -1337 CT+TT and LIPC -514 CC genotypes, but a significant interaction was not shown. A multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that, in patients with coronary atherosclerosis, the CETP- 1337 CC genotype was a significant genetic risk factor in FH (odds ratio=2.022; P=0.0256). These results indicate that the CETP promoter -1337C>T polymorphism is associated with the progression of coronary atherosclerosis in Japanese patients with FH, independent of HDL-C and triacylglycerol levels.",

    "69": "The increasing prevalence of diabetes is reaching epidemic proportion worldwide. Because of the associated morbidity and mortality, it is exerting major pressure on the healthcare system. With a better understanding of the pathophysiology of type-2 diabetes, the concept of primary prevention has emerged. A number of studies have confirmed that intensive lifestyle modification was very effective in the prevention of diabetes in the impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) population. However, maintaining long-term lifestyle modification is a major challenge. It is, therefore, important to have other strategies, either pharmacological or surgical, that can be used as an adjunct or alternative to lifestyle modification. The Chinese study showed that metformin and acarbose could reduce the risk of diabetes by 65 and 83%, respectively, in IGT subjects. The efficacy of metformin was confirmed by the Diabetes Prevention Program (31% risk reduction) and that of acarbose by the STOP-NIDDM trial (36% risk reduction) in a similar high-risk population. The TRIPOD study showed that troglitazone could reduce the risk of diabetes by 55% in Hispanic women with a history of gestational diabetes. And more recently, the XENDOS study showed that orlistat could reduced the risk of diabetes by 37% in obese subjects when used as an adjunct to an intensive lifestyle program. Three studies have suggested that bariatric surgery in morbidly obese subjects could reduce the risk of diabetes to near zero. Furthermore, a number of studies have examined the effect of a renin angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitor, as well as statin and hormone replacement therapy on the prevention of type-2 diabetes in high-risk subjects as secondary outcomes and have suggested that they could be of potential benefit. The accumulating evidence is now overwhelming. Yes, diabetes can be prevented or delayed in high-risk populations. With this new information, we need to design new strategies to screen high-risk populations and to implement the new treatments that have proven effective in the prevention of type-2 diabetes.", 
    "70": "Calcific aortic valve disease is a common condition and is associated with inflammatory changes and expression of osteoblast-like cell phenotypes, but the cellular mechanisms are unclear. Recent studies identified extracellular ATP and P2Y receptor cascade as important regulators of bone remodeling, whereas its breakdown product, adenosine, is known to have anti-inflammatory properties. We hypothesize that extracellular ATP and adenosine have important roles in regulating osteoblast differentiation in human valve interstitial cells, and that this can be a potential target for therapy. Method and Results- Primary cultures of human valve interstitial cells (ICs) treated for 21 days with osteogenic media, ATP, and ATP-gamma-S (a stable agonist of the P2Y receptor) revealed a significant increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (an osteoblast marker) activity and expression as measured using spectrophotometric assay and immunocytochemistry staining. Valve ICs treated with adenosine alone did not cause an increase in ALP activity; however, adenosine treatment decreased the ALP activity and expression induced by osteogenic media after 21 days of incubation. In addition, atorvastatin inhibited the activity of ALP induced by ATP in human valve ICs, and enzyme studies revealed that atorvastatin upregulated the breakdown of extracellular ATP into adenosine in human valve ICs after 24-hour treatment.",

    "73": "To test this hypothesis, we treated primary cultures of human aortic valve ICs with osteogenic media, bone morphogenic proteins ([BMPs] BMP-2, BMP-4, and BMP-7), and tissue growth factor-beta ([TGF-beta] TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta3) for 21 days. These mediators induced osteoblast differentiation of valve ICs by significantly increasing the activity and expression of alkaline phosphatase ([ALP] P<0.001). A cytokine protein array revealed that atorvastatin treatment (100 micromol/L) of human valve ICs caused a downregulation in levels of expression of BMP-2, BMP-6, TGF-beta1, and TGF-beta3 after 24 hours. In addition, human valve ICs treated with atorvastatin in the presence of osteogenic media showed a significant reduction in ALP activity in comparison to cells treated with osteogenic media only (P=<0.001). This was further confirmed with immunocytochemical staining of valve ICs, whereby atorvastatin markedly reduced the expression of ALP and osteocalcin induced by osteogenic media in comparison to untreated cells.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of mevinolin, a clinical statin drug, on osteoblast function (MG 63 Cell Line) and compare its mode of action with the conventionally utilized parathyroid hormone (PTH). MG63 cells were treated with different concentrations (control, low (100 nM), medium (1 uM), and high (10 uM)) of mevinolin or Parathyroid hormone. The cells were incubated for 24, 48, and 72 hours at 37 degrees C in a 95% air and 5% CO2 environmental chamber. Data obtained in this study revealed that: (I) there were significant decreases in cell number after 24 hours upon the exposure of medium and high doses of mevinolin, (II) cell numbers rebounded back toward control after 48 hours and were similar in number at 72 hours, and (III) there were no significant changes in calcium or alkaline phosphatase activity were observed throughout the study. Morphologically, the cells treated with various doses of Mevinolin expressed similar structural changes to those observed using PTH. These changes included pleomorphic characteristics and an occasional hyperchromatic pattern during the entire duration of the study (72 Hours). Other structural features observed were spindle shapes, cluster arrangements and multinucleation. The majority of cells had multiple nucleoli in all treated groups compared to controls. The overall conclusion of this investigation demonstrated that the concentrations used (100 nM and 10 microM) did not appear to affect the mitotic activities of immature phenotypic MG-63 cells. In addition, the concentrations of mevinolin used did not trigger the differentiation process of the cells throughout the experimental phases. This observation led us to suggest that the reason for such an outcome could be attributed to the lack of a response in calcium production or alkaline phosphatase activity (stimulator to differentiation and mineralization process).", 
    "98": "Statins, which are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors are widely used for the treatment of hyperlipidemia, and recent studies and animal data suggest that statins promote osteogenesis and increase bone strength. However, little is known about the effects of statins delivered by sustained delivery system to a target site of a defect and segmental bone fractures on certain biochemical markers including reproductive hormones. The purpose of this study was to develop a targeted statin delivery system using Tricalcium Phosphate Lysine (TCPL) for defect and segmental femoral injuries and evaluate the effects on alkaline phosphatase, total protein, malinodialdehyde, glutathione, total cholesterol, testosterone, luteinizing hormone, statins, and follicle-stimulating hormone. Because of the influence oral intake of statins might have on certain body organs, we also examine the histomorphology of the vital and reproductive organs of the animals receiving statins for a period of 30 days and 12 weeks post surgery. Simvastatin used in this study significantly increased fracture healing and without significant influence on the body weights and the weights and morphology of the vital and reproductive organs. There was a significant reduction in the cholesterol levels on the 3rd week in both phases of the study and at the conclusion of the study the difference in the cholesterol levels was no more significant in both phases. Other biochemical markers including plasma LH, FSH and testosterone levels were not affected by active treatment with simvastatin. In conclusion, short and long-term simvastatin treatment delivered at a fracture target site did not influence vital and reproductive organs, the systemic levels of the biochemical markers studied, but was able to effectively stimulate bone formation in simple and complicated segmental fractures.",

There are few trials evaluating the efficacy of prevention strategies in renal transplant patients on major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and cardiovascular mortality. However, there is general agreement that active prevention strategies can significantly decrease cardiovascular mortality after renal transplantation. Here, we present the case of a 52-year-old male patient who received a first kidney transplant in 1993. He showed a small fixed perfusion defect on thallium scintigraphy before transplant. He was admitted at 13 months due to an antero-lateral myocardial infarction that was complicated with ventricular fibrillation. Despite anti-coagulation with acenocumarol, treatment with statins and angiotensin II receptor blocking agents and an excellent preservation of renal function, the patient presented with a second episode of myocardial infarction at 9 years post-transplant. This case report is discussed in order to highlight the way in which attitudes have been modified in the past decade in order to systematically pursue an early diagnosis of pre-existing coronary artery disease, aggressively treat MACE and actively decrease cardiovascular risk in transplant patients, using all available efficacious treatments as well as individualizing immunosuppression to prolong not only graft but also patient survival.",

    "106": "To investigate the potential determinants of the pleiotropic effects of statins, we measured NK cell cytotoxicity in samples from normal subjects and patients, including patients receiving statin therapy. In a multivariate analysis, NK cell cytotoxicity was related to total plasma cholesterol concentration rather than statin use. In vitro, we investigated the role of lipid modification, specifically the effects on membrane rafts and raft-dependent signal transduction. We demonstrate that statins reduce NK cell cytotoxicity and that membrane cholesterol depletion by cyclodextrins has a similar effect. In contrast, isoprenyl transferase inhibitors had little or no effect on NK cell function. We hypothesise that the pleiotropic effects of statins reflect changes in membrane cholesterol and, specifically, the density of membrane rafts. Moreover, there is likely to be a relationship between membrane cholesterol, membrane rafts and cell function that may be involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.", 
    "107": "Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a severe developmental disorder caused by mutations in the DHCR7 gene coding for 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) reductase, the enzyme involved in the last step of cholesterol biosynthesis. SLOS homozygotes exhibit marked deficiency of cholesterol in plasma and tissues with concomitant increase in 7-DHC. Ultraviolet A (UVA) photosensitivity has been recognized as part of SLOS with maximal response occurring at 350 nm. 7-DHC itself has no UVA absorption and so cannot be the direct cause of SLOS photosensitivity. However, cholesta-5,7,9(11)-trien-3beta-ol (9-DDHC), a metabolite of 7-DHC, has been detected in plasma from SLOS patients. Because 9-DDHC has strong absorption in the UVA range (approximately 15,000 @ 324 nm), we have examined its photobiology to determine whether it could be involved in SLOS photosensitivity. High levels of 7-DHC (0.65 mg/100 g wet weight) and measurable amounts of 9-DDHC (0.042 mg/100 g wet weight) were found in skin lipids extracted from CD-1 mice treated with AY9944 (trans-1,4-bis(2-chlorobenzylaminomethyl)cyclohexane dihydrochloride), an inhibitor of 7-DHC reductase. Human HaCaT keratinocytes treated with 9-DDHC (10 microM) and then immediately exposed to UVA (15 J/cm2) exhibited an 88% decrease in viability (compared to dark controls). No damage was observed in cells exposed to 7-DHC/UVA or UVA alone. However, HaCaT keratinocytes treated with 7-DHC (5 microM) for 15 h and then exposed to UVA (30 J/cm2) were damaged. 9-DDHC was detected in keratinocytes incubated with 7-DHC. Reactive oxygen species were detected in 9-DDHC/UVA-exposed cells using the fluorescent probe 5-(and 6-)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate acetyl ester. Singlet oxygen was generated when 9-DDHC was UVA irradiated in CCl4. UVA irradiation of 9-DDHC in acetonitrile generated superoxide and carbon-centered and alkoxyl radicals which were trapped by 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide. These findings suggest that reactive oxygen species generated by 9-DDHC may play a role in the UVA skin photosensitivity of SLOS patients. Furthermore, several statin drugs inhibit 7-DHC reductase, in addition to hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoenzymeA reductase, so that 9-DDHC may also be responsible for statin-derived photosensitivity, dermatoses, and cataract formation. Finally, we have previously detected 9-DDHC in skin lipids from normal subjects, so this sterol may also be the skin chromophore responsible for skin photoaging and UV-induced skin cancer.",

Most patients were treated in the neoadjuvant setting or because of biochemical recurrence. Fasting serum lipid, glucose and hemoglobin A1C were determined in 1,102 men at baseline, and on treatment days 85 and 169.

Consistent changes in low density lipoprotein-cholesterol were not detected. Increased total cholesterol was usually due to an increase in high density lipoprotein-cholesterol. Hemoglobin A1C increased from baseline to day 85 only and there were no significant changes in fasting glucose measurements. The type of androgen deprivation therapy did not affect these parameters.",

We also examined the effect of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor pitavastatin against the changes of BDNF, NGF, HSP 70 and ubiquitin in the hippocampus after cerebral ischemia in the hippocampus after ischemia. 2. The transient cerebral ischemia was carried out by clamping the carotid arteries with aneurismal clips for 5 min. 3. In the present study, the alteration of HSP 70 and ubiquitin immunoreactivity in the hippocampal CA1 sector was more pronounced than that of BDNF and NGF immunoreactivity after transient cerebral ischemia. In double-labeled immunostainings, BDNF, NGF and ubiquitin immunostaining was observed both in GFAP-positive astrocytes and MRF-1-positive microglia in the hippocampal CA1 sector after ischemia. Furthermore, prophylactic treatment with pitavastatin prevented the damage of neurons with neurotrophic factor and stress proteins in the hippocampal CA1 sector after ischemia. 4. These findings suggest that the expression of stress protein including HSP 70 and ubiquitin may play a key role in the protection against the hippocampal CA1 neuronal damage after transient cerebral ischemia in comparison with the expression of neurotrophic factor such as BDNF and NGF. The present findings also suggest that the glial BDNF, NGF and ubiquitin may play some role for helping surviving neurons after ischemia. Furthermore, our present study indicates that prophylactic treatment with pitavastatin can prevent the damage of neurons with neurotrophic factor and stress proteins in the hippocampal CA1 sector after transient cerebral ischemia. Thus our study provides further valuable information for the pathogenesis after transient cerebral ischemia.", 
    "117": "Statin therapy may be associated with lower mortality in patients with heart failure, but the underlying mechanism of such an association is unknown. We have evaluated the effects of pitavastatin on cardiac function and survival in a rat model of hypertensive heart failure and investigated the molecular mechanism of the observed effects. Dahl salt-sensitive rats fed with high-salt diet from 7 weeks of age developed compensatory left ventricular hypertrophy at 12 weeks and heart failure at 19 weeks. Dahl salt-sensitive rats were treated with either vehicle or pitavastatin (0.3 mg/kg per day) from 7 or 12 weeks. Both early-onset and late-onset pitavastatin treatment reduced left ventricular fibrosis, improved cardiac function, and increased the survival rate apparent at 19 weeks. The increases in the expression levels of hypertrophic, profibrotic, and metalloproteinase genes as well as in gelatinase activities in the heart induced by the high-salt diet were suppressed by pitavastatin treatment. Furthermore, the level of cardiac endothelin-1 was increased in association with the development of heart failure in a manner sensitive to treatment with pitavastatin. Both early and late pitavastatin treatment thus improved cardiac function and survival, with modulation of extracellular matrix remodeling and endothelin-1 signaling possibly contributing to these beneficial effects.",

Patients with a triglyceride level >or=200 mg/dL were randomly assigned to receive either 200 mg of fenofibrate (n = 54) or general measures (n = 54). A third group of patients with hypercholesterolemia received a statin (n = 54). Patients with a CRP level >or=10 mg/L were excluded. CRP levels were measured before and after 2 months of therapy. Fenofibrate did not reduce CRP levels (1.74 +/- 1.74 vs. 1.54 +/- 1.66 mg/L, P = 0.27) nor did general measures (P = 0.85). Statin reduced CRP levels (P = 0.002). In patients with baseline CRP levels of >or=3 mg/dL, CRP levels were decreased in both the fenofibrate and control groups (P = 0.026 and 0.008, respectively). Changes in CRP levels were associated only with baseline CRP levels in both groups (P = 0.001 and 0.049, respectively). When all hypertriglyceridemic patients were divided into 2 subgroups according to changes in body weights, CRP levels decreased in patients who reduced their body weight >or=1 kg (n = 29, P = 0.030), and were not changed in the other patients (n = 79, P = 0.67). In summary, fenofibrate failed to decrease CRP levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia. An anti-inflammatory mechanism may not play a significant role in the cardioprotective effect of fenofibrate.",

As cholesterol seems to play a role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases, it is of interest to evaluate the effect of high dosages of statins (eg, atorvastatin or simvastatin) on brain cholesterol metabolism. Plasma samples from 44 participants (aged 30-69 years, 16 men and 18 women) of an earlier randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, who took 40 mg atorvastatin or 80 mg simvastatin daily for 2 months, were used to analyze total cholesterol, its precursor lathosterol, and its metabolites 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol. Despite a significant decrease in absolute plasma concentrations of oxysterols, total cholesterol, and its endogenous synthesis rate, indicated by a decreased ratio of lathosterol to cholesterol, the plasma 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol to cholesterol ratio, a surrogate marker of brain cholesterol homeostasis, remained unchanged. Short-term high-dose atorvastatin and simvastatin treatment does not seem to influence brain cholesterol metabolism in patients with moderately elevated plasma cholesterol levels.",

Under fasted conditions, 80 mg simvastatin was administered with or without 4 g P-OM3 for two 14-day periods. After 14 days of dosing to achieve steady state, no significant differences were found in either the extent (AUC(tau)) or rate (Cmax) of exposure to simvastatin or its major beta-hydroxy metabolite after coadministration of P-OM3 with simvastatin compared with administration of simvastatin alone. At steady state, the coadministration of P-OM3 capsules did not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin tablets.

An increase of CD68 positive cells was observed in patients receiving statins compared with nonstatin treatment (P=0.05). This effect was specifically related to atorvastatin treatment. In patients treated with atorvastatin, the increased amount of CD68 positive cells were not associated with increased protease activity.

Although improvement in values of mentioned parameters, after six months long therapy with simvastatin the percentage of patients with Duke's treadmill score value showing intermediate cardiovascular risk (between -10 and +4) increased. In conclusion, therapy with hypolipemic diet and simvastatin already after four weeks decreased plasma lipids and fibrinogen levels and improved the course of angina pectoris and exercise stress test, what suggested its effectiveness not only as the treatment improving atherosclerosis risk factors, but also with prompt and clinical important effect ameliorating the handicapped coronary reserve.",

Statins decrease thrombus formation and increase fibrinolysis, inhibit platelet reactivity and aggregation, improve endothelial function in patients with coronary artery disease and have a major role in plaque stabilisation. Several studies showed that initiation of early statin therapy in these settings may have beneficial effects. This review summarises the current data on statins in the setting of ACSs. Known and other possible mechanisms of action are described. The pathophysiological mechanisms, histological features and biochemical characteristics of ACS are different than those with stable coronary disease, thereby suggesting that the mechanisms whereby statins exert their benefits in ACS may be distinct from those for stable CHD. Initiation of the therapy during hospitalisation rather than at the time of hospital discharge may provide protection against early recurrent cardiovascular events and also improve patients' compliance.",

The more relevant questions today are focused on ways of optimising statin therapy. More recent studies have found that more intensive statin therapy, using high doses of these agents that produce substantially greater reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, are associated with greater benefit than less intensive statin therapy. These trials suggest that statins with greater efficacy in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, would be preferred over less effective statins. So far, economic analyses of these comparative studies have not been published. These economic studies are needed to support formulary and drug therapy selection decisions regarding statins.",

The decrease in GSH and the an increase in MPO activity in the colitis group were reversed by SIM at all doses (p<0.01), but FLU had no effect. An increase in colonic lucigenin CL value in the colitis group was reduced by SIM and FLU at all doses (p<0.001) and an increase in peroxynitrite ratio in the colitis group showed a significant reduction in SIM-treated groups; FLU reduced this effect at a dose of 1 mg/kg (p<0.01).

    "159": "We have previously reported that protein lipidation in the form of palmitoylation and farnesylation is critical for the production of Abeta (amyloid beta-peptide), the dimerization of beta-secretase and its trafficking into cholesterol-rich microdomains. As statins influence these lipid modifications in addition to their effects on cholesterol biosynthesis, we have investigated the effects of lovastatin and SIMVA (simvastatin) at a range of concentrations chosen to distinguish different cellular effects on Abeta production and beta-secretase structure and its localization in bHEK cells [HEK-293 cells (human embryonic kidney cells) transfected with the Asp-2 gene plus a polyhistidine coding tag] cells. We have compared the changes brought about by statins with those brought about by the palmitoylation inhibitor cerulenin and the farnesyltransferase inhibitor CVFM (Cys-Val-Phe-Met). The statin-mediated reduction in Abeta production correlated with an inhibition of beta-secretase dimerization into its more active form at all concentrations of statin investigated. These effects were reversed by the administration of mevalonate, showing that these effects were mediated via 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA-dependent pathways. At low (1 microM) statin concentrations, reduction in Abeta production and inhibition of beta-secretase dimerization were mediated by inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis. At high (>10 microM) concentrations of statins, inhibition of beta-secretase palmitoylation occurred, which we demonstrated to be regulated by intracellular cholesterol levels. There was also a concomitant concentration-dependent change in beta-secretase subcellular trafficking. Significantly, Abeta release from cells was markedly higher at 50 microM SIMVA than at 1 microM, whereas these concentrations resulted in similar reductions in total Abeta production, suggesting that low-dose statins may be more beneficial than high doses for the therapeutic treatment of Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "160": "Because elevated serum cholesterol levels are strongly associated with coronary heart disease, cholesterol reduction by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (or statins) has been assumed to be the predominant, if not the only, mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of these drugs in cardiovascular diseases. Subgroup analyses of large clinical trials, however, have suggested that the beneficial effects of statins may extend to mechanisms beyond cholesterol reduction. Indeed, recent experimental and clinical evidence indicates that some of the cholesterol-independent or \"pleiotropic\" effects of statins may be mediated through improving or restoring endothelial function, enhancing the stability of atherosclerotic plaques, and decreasing oxidative stress and vascular inflammation.",

About 100 compactin-resistant strains were isolated from the Basal agar containing 7% (w/v) mannitol as a carbon source, in which two bacteria, Pseudomocardia autotrophica BCRC 12444 and Streptomyces griseolus BCRC 13677, capable of converting compactin to pravastatin with the yield of 20 and 32% (w/w), respectively, were found. High-performance liquid chromatography using C-18 column and two sequential mobile phases, 30% and 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, was also established to simultaneously determine the concentration of compactin and pravastatin in the culture broth. As such, about 2% of target microorganisms could be obtained from the screening program.", 
    "166": "Primary and secondary prevention trials have clearly demonstrated that lowering serum cholesterol levels with statins reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events. Recent studies plus post hoc analysis of previous clinical trials show that risk reduction is proportional to the magnitude of LDL cholesterol lowering. Therefore, new recommendations of the National Cholesterol Education Program (USA) have defined a category of patients with very high cardiovascular risk, who should achieve serum LDL cholesterol levels below 70 mg/dl. This proposal will require new and more efficient pharmacologic strategies to attain the increasingly strict therapeutic goals for LDL cholesterol. This article reviews the clinical studies that support the use of intensive lipid lowering therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk. An effective reduction of serum cholesterol can be obtained using statins in high doses or a combination of hypolipidemic drugs with different mechanisms of action.", 
    "167": "Progression of sclerosis and stenosis is substantially unpredictable in the individual patient: in some cases it is very slow, in others it is accelerated. In addition, different patterns of progression (linear and non-linear) are possible. It has been suggested that the aortic valve lesion can be considered a form within the spectrum of the same atherosclerotic disease. In this context it seemed reasonable to hypothesize that targeted medical therapy could retard the progression of the disease. In particular HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been tested. The first experimental and clinical studies are now available, even though they are not conclusive to date. Large, prospective, randomized trials are ideally needed, but they are quite difficult, if not even impossible, to realize in practice. The ASSIST study (Asymptomatic aortic Sclerosis/Stenosis: Influence of STatins) of the Italian Society of Cardiovascular Echography aims to create a large, prospective, observational investigation, involving many centers of echocardiography and thousands of patients, in order to provide from the real clinical world at least some of the answers to this unsolved question.", 
    "168": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is increased in type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of 10 mg of atorvastatin versus placebo on CVD prevention in subjects with type 2 diabetes and LDL cholesterol levels below contemporary guideline targets.", 
    "169": "Subjects were randomly assigned to receive 10 mg of atorvastatin or placebo in a 4-year, double-blind, parallel-group study. The composite primary end point comprised cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, recanalization, coronary artery bypass surgery, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and worsening or unstable angina requiring hospitalization.", 
    "170": "A total of 2,410 subjects with type 2 diabetes were randomized. Mean LDL cholesterol reduction in the atorvastatin group over 4 years was 29% versus placebo (P < 0.0001). When we compared atorvastatin versus placebo, composite primary end point rates were 13.7 and 15.0%, respectively (hazard ratio 0.90 [95% CI 0.73-1.12]). In the subset of 1,905 subjects without prior myocardial infarction or interventional procedure, 10.4% of atorvastatin- and 10.8% of placebo-treated subjects experienced a primary end point (0.97 [0.74-1.28]). In the 505 subjects with prior myocardial infarction or interventional procedure, 26.2% of atorvastatin- and 30.8% of placebo-treated subjects experienced a primary end point (0.82 [0.59-1.15]). Relative risk reductions in fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction were 27% overall (P = 0.10) and 19% (P = 0.41) and 36% (P = 0.11) for subjects without and with prior myocardial infarction or interventional procedure, respectively.", 
    "171": "Composite end point reductions were not statistically significant. This result may relate to the overall study design, the types of subjects recruited, the nature of the primary end point, and the protocol changes required because of changing treatment guidelines. For these reasons, the results of the Atorvastatin Study for Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease Endpoints in Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (ASPEN) did not confirm the benefit of therapy but do not detract from the imperative that the majority of diabetic patients are at risk of coronary heart disease and deserve LDL cholesterol lowering to the currently recommended targets.", 
    "172": "A 54-year-old man with unstable angina presented with severe stenosis of the middle segment of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Percutaneous coronary stent implantation and serial intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) were performed. IVUS detected a non-culprit coronary plaque with a large lipid-rich pool in the proximal segment of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Atorvastatin 10 mg/day was given to reduce his cholesterol level for 2 years after the stent implantation. This patient had no cardiac events, and the low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level reduced from 171 to 88 mg/dl at follow-up. Two-year follow-up IVUS examination revealed the reduction of plaque burden associated with regression of the lipid-rich pool size. This case may indicate that statin could contribute to the regression of lipid-rich plaque and to the stability of coronary plaque.", 
    "173": "To study alterations in muscle function combining physiological, electrophysiological and metabolic measurements in patients receiving a statin at various dosages during long-term therapy.", 
    "174": "A 3-month (D0, D30 and D90) longitudinal physiological and electrophysiological muscle study was performed in 26 patients receiving 10, 40 or 80 mg/day atorvastatin.", 
    "175": "All subjects performed maximal (MVC) and submaximal (60% MVC) isometric thumb adduction, handgrip and knee extension exercises during the recording of surface electromyograms (EMG) of the adductor pollicis (AP), flexor digitorum (FD) and vastus lateralis (VL). The compound muscle potential (M-wave) evoked by direct muscle stimulation was measured at rest and after 60% MVCs and the EMG power spectrum was analyzed during sustained effort. Blood was sampled from an antecubital vein for measurements of pH, lactate and potassium levels after thumb adduction and handgrip exercises. The measurements were repeated on Day 0 (D0), D30 and D90.", 
    "176": "Atorvastatin did not affect the MVC and endurance time to fatigue. Post-exercise M-wave alterations in the AP began at D30 with the 80 mg/day treatment and there was a reduced or suppressed leftward shift in the EMG power spectrum in the AP and VL with all 3 dosages. In the AP, the EMG changes appeared earlier (D30) with 80 mg/day whereas they only occurred at D90 on the lower dosages. Atorvastatin had no effect on the maximal postexercise variations in pHv and lactate but it significantly reduced the maximal increase in plasma potassium concentration after thumb adduction and handgrip exercise, the effects being only present at D90 on 10 mg/day but occurring as early as D30 with higher dosages.", 
    "177": "A 3-month atorvastatin treatment did not affect the maximal performance of skeletal muscle during voluntary efforts but EMG analysis revealed a reduced muscle excitability and an attenuated adaptation to fatigue. These effects prevailed in muscles containing the largest proportion of slow-oxidative fibers and were associated with a reduced outward flow of potassium.", 
    "178": "We recently developed a genome-length hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA replication system (OR6) with luciferase as a reporter. The OR6 assay system has enabled prompt and precise quantification of HCV RNA replication. Pegylated interferon (IFN) and ribavirin combination therapy is the world standard for chronic hepatitis C, but its effectiveness is limited to about 55% of patients. Newer therapeutic approaches are needed. In the present study, we used the OR6 assay system to evaluate the anti-HCV activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, called statins, and their effects in combination with IFN-alpha. Five types of statins (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin) were examined for their anti-HCV activities. Fluvastatin exhibited the strongest anti-HCV activity (IC50: 0.9 micromol/L), whereas atorvastatin and simvastatin showed moderate inhibitory effects. However, lovastatin, reported recently as an inhibitor of HCV replication, was shown to exhibit the weakest anti-HCV activity. The anti-HCV activities of statins were reversed by the addition of mevalonate or geranylgeraniol. Surprisingly, however, pravastatin exhibited no anti-HCV activity, although it worked as an inhibitor for HMG-CoA reductase. The combination of IFN and the statins (except for pravastatin) exhibited strong inhibitory effects on HCV RNA replication. In combination with IFN, fluvastatin also exhibited a synergistic inhibitory effect. In conclusion, statins, especially fluvastatin, could be potentially useful as new anti-HCV reagents in combination with IFN.", 
    "179": "Muscle pain and weakness are frequent complaints in patients receiving 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzymeA (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins). Many patients with myalgia have creatine kinase levels that are either normal or only marginally elevated, and no obvious structural defects have been reported in patients with myalgia only. To investigate further the mechanism that mediates statin-induced skeletal muscle damage, skeletal muscle biopsies from statin-treated and non-statin-treated patients were examined using both electron microscopy and biochemical approaches. The present paper reports clear evidence of skeletal muscle damage in statin-treated patients, despite their being asymptomatic. Though the degree of overall damage is slight, it has a characteristic pattern that includes breakdown of the T-tubular system and subsarcolemmal rupture. These characteristic structural abnormalities observed in the statin-treated patients were reproduced by extraction of cholesterol from skeletal muscle fibres in vitro. These findings support the hypothesis that statin-induced cholesterol lowering per se contributes to myocyte damage and suggest further that it is the specific lipid/protein organization of the skeletal muscle cell itself that renders it particularly vulnerable.", 
    "180": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma is the master regulator of adipocyte differentiation and controls many adipocyte genes in response to anti-diabetic thiazolidinediones (TZDs) and lipid-lowering fibrates. We hypothesized that the combination of TZD+fibrate may be better than the sulfonylurea + statin approach regarding modifying the adipokine profile in diabetic patients with dyslipidemia.", 
    "181": "We measured the lipid profiles and circulating levels of adiponectin, resistin, and inflammatory markers before and after treatment in 24 type 2 diabetic patients with dyslipidemia (aged 64+/-9 years; M/F=5/19). The study patients were randomly assigned to receive an 8-week treatment of either rosiglitazone 4 mg daily and fenofibrate 160 mg daily (PPAR group) or glibenclamide 5 mg daily and atorvastatin 10 mg daily (non-PPAR group).", 
    "182": "Even though the administration of sulfonylurea+statin can achieve a greater reduction of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels and a comparable glucose control compared to PPAR treatment, their administration did not change the plasma adipokine levels significantly. In contrast, a significant greater increase of the plasma concentrations of adiponectin (P<0.0001), a trend to a greater decrease of the plasma resistin levels (P=0.061), a significantly greater increase of HDL-cholesterol (P=0.002), and a significantly greater reduction of triglyceride levels (P=0.018) were seen in the PPAR group.", 
    "183": "Considering the clinical significance of the adipokine-endothelial interaction in the progression and long-term prognosis of atherosclerosis, the differential effects of PPAR ligands and sulfonylurea+statin on plasma adipokine concentrations demonstrated in this study are interesting foci of investigation in the future.", 
    "184": "Gender differences between the risk factors for coronary heart disease and coronary events were examined in the Japan Lipid Intervention Trial, a 6-year observational study.", 
    "185": "Men (12,575) and women (27,013) were analyzed for risk of coronary events (acute myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death). Simvastatin reduced serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 27% in both genders, and increased serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in men (5%) and women (4%). The incidence of coronary events was lower in women (0.64/1,000 patient-years) than in men (1.57/1,000 patient-years). The risk of coronary events increased by 18% in men and 21% in women with each 10 mg/dl elevation of LDL-C, and decreased by 39% in men and 33% in women with each 10 mg/dl elevation of HDL-C. The risk increased proportionally with aging in women, but not in men. Diabetes mellitus (DM) was more strongly related to the risk of coronary events for women (relative risk 3.07) than for men (relative risk 1.58).", 
    "186": "The incidence of coronary events is lower in women. Serum LDL-C is related to an increased risk of coronary events to the same extent in both genders. DM seems to be a more important risk factor in women, trading off the lower risk of coronary events among them.", 
    "187": "We have demonstrated that myocardial ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels are implicated in the development of cardiac hypertrophy in hyperlipidemic rabbits. We investigated the effect of pravastatin on development of ventricular hypertrophy in male normolipidemic Wistar rats with two-kidney, one-clip (2K1C) hypertension and whether the attenuated hypertrophic effect was via activation of K(ATP) channels. Twenty-four hours after the left renal artery was clipped, rats were treated with one of the following therapies for 8 wk: vehicle, nicorandil (an agonist of K(ATP) channels), pravastatin, glibenclamide (an antagonist of K(ATP) channels), hydralazine, nicorandil plus glibenclamide, or pravastatin plus glibenclamide. Systolic blood pressure, relative left ventricular (LV) weight, and cardiomyocyte sizes significantly increased in vehicle-treated 2K1C rats compared with those in sham-operated rats. Treatment with either nicorandil or pravastatin significantly attenuated LV hypertrophy/body weight compared with the vehicle, which was further confirmed by downregulation of LV atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA. Nicorandil-induced effects were abolished by administering glibenclamide. Similarly, pravastatin-induced beneficial effects were reversed by the addition of glibenclamide, implicating K(ATP) channels as the relevant target. A dissociation between the effects of blood pressure and cardiac structure was noted because pravastatin and hydralazine reduced arterial pressure similarly. These results suggest a crucial role of cardiac K(ATP) channel system in the development of ventricular hypertrophy in the 2K1C hypertensive rats. Pravastatin is endowed with cardiac antihypertrophic properties probably through activation of K(ATP) channels, independent of lipid and hemodynamic changes.", 
    "188": "The most important risk factors for coronary heart disease are hypercholesterolemia, smoking and hypertension. To find out which treatment is more effective in modifying the total risk--lowering cholesterol concentration or using antihypertensive treatment--we conducted a parallel group placebo-controlled study. The goal of the study was to assess the effect of two drugs on the calculated CHD Framingham risk score in subjects with both moderate hypertension and moderate hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "189": "Celiprolol for hypertension and simvastatin for cholesterol-lowering were given as monotherapy or as combination treatment. The effects of the treatments on the CHD risk scores were calculated after 3 months. A total of 112 patients were randomized.", 
    "190": "The total CHD risk decreased in simvastatin and combination groups from 26% to 19% and from 26% to 17%, respectively. Celiprolol alone decreased the risk from 25% to 21%, which was not statistically different from placebo.", 
    "191": "It can be concluded that subjects with moderate hypercholesterolemia and hypertension benefit more from lipid-lowering treatment with simvastatin than from blood pressure-lowering with beta blocker celiprolol.", 
    "192": "Statins have been proven to reduce cardiac events and mortality. However, there are few studies dealing with the long-term efficacy of statin therapy following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).", 
    "193": "We collected data from 575 consecutive patients who underwent PCI between 1987 and 1992. The baseline data, mortality and incidence of cardiovascular events of patients given statins and those not given statins at the time of PCI were compared.", 
    "194": "There were 243 patients in the statin group and 332 patients in the non-statin group. During follow-up (11.0+/-3.0 years), 68 patients died. At about 10 years, statin use was significantly associated with lower all-cause mortality (8.2% versus 14.5%, P=0.023) and cardiac death (2.5% versus 6.9%, P=0.017). After adjusting for variables, statin use was found to be an independent predictor of death from all causes (hazard ratio [HR] 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29-0.99, P=0.048) and cardiac death (HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07-0.80, P=0.02).", 
    "195": "Statin use at the time of PCI was associated with a significantly reduced risk of death from all causes and cardiac death. Furthermore, this study provides evidence of a clinical benefit at about 10 years of statin use in patients who underwent PCI."
