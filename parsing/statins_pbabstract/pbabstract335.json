Lipoprotein kinetic studies afford a powerful approach to understanding and defining the mechanisms by which such interventions modulate lipoprotein metabolism. Stable isotope tracers and compartment models are now commonly employed for such studies. We review the recent application of tracer methodologies to the study of dyslipoproteinemia in the metabolic syndrome. We also focus on the effects of nutritional intervention studies that have addressed the effects of weight loss, n-3 fatty acids, plant sterols and alcohol on very low density lipoprotein, LDL and HDL metabolism. The potential for statin treatment as an adjunct to dietary modification is also discussed. New tracer methodologies are discussed, specifically those referring to reverse cholesterol transport. The nutritional interventions discussed in this review are readily transferable into clinical preventive practice. The potential benefits to be gained by weight loss and fish oil supplementation in the metabolic syndrome extend beyond their specific and positive effects on lipoprotein metabolism. Furthermore, recent developments in tracer methodologies afford new tools for probing the in-vivo pathways of lipoprotein metabolism in future studies.", 
    "1": "An inflammatory process may be one of the critical factors that contribute to the development of diabetic nephropathy (DN). We reported previously that intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is up-regulated and promotes macrophage infiltration in the glomeruli of diabetic rats. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have recently been emphasized to have anti-inflammatory effects; inhibition of leukocyte adhesion and migration, independent of the cholesterol-lowering effect. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that statins prevent the development of DN by pleiotropic effects.", 
    "2": "Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were treated with cerivastatin (0.5 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle for 4 weeks. We analysed glomerular macrophage infiltration and ICAM-1 expression. We also evaluated major regulators of ICAM-1, activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) using electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and oxidative stress.", 
    "3": "Statin treatment reduced urinary albumin excretion (UAE) (2.96+/-0.18 vs 2.38+/-0.06; log(10) UAE, P<0.05), glomerular size (12 150+/-329 vs 9963+/-307 micro m(2), P<0.05), and lowered blood pressure, compared with untreated diabetic rats. Immunohistochemistry revealed that macrophage infiltration and ICAM-1 expression in glomeruli were increased in diabetic rats and were inhibited by statin treatment. Renal NF-kappaB activity, urinary excretion and renal deposition of 8-OHdG were increased in diabetic rats, and reduced by statin treatment.", 
    "4": "Statin treatment prevented glomerular injury, independent of the cholesterol-lowering effects. Our findings suggest that the beneficial effect might be mediated by pleiotropic effects including an anti-inflammatory action through a reduction of oxidative stress, NF-kappaB activation, ICAM-1 expression and macrophage infiltration in the early phase of DN.", 
    "5": "Statins block de novo synthesis of cholesterol by inhibiting the enzyme, HMG CoA reductase. The product of this reaction, mevalonic acid, is also a precursor of isoprenoids, molecules required for the activation of signaling G-proteins, such as Ras. Signal transduction pathways involving Ras are important for cell survival and this may be why statins induce apoptotic death of several cell types. Given that statins are used to treat vascular disease, surprisingly no studies have been conducted on vascular endothelial cells. Here we show that fluvastatin (FS), at concentrations from 1-2 microM, blocks growth and induces apoptosis of the endothelial cell line, EA.hy 926. Considerable redundancy is known to exist in cell signaling and in vivo toxicity of FS might be prevented by other signaling pathways, like those activated by adrenal or sex steroids. RT-PCR analysis revealed the expression of the androgen and glucocorticoid receptor in EA.hy 926 cells. Although the androgen, dihydrotestesterone (DHT) had no effect, the glucocorticoid, dexamethasone (Dex), blocked FS-induced apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis revealed that 24 h exposure to FS prevented cells from leaving G(1) and 24-48 h later a marked sub-G(1) peak was observed. Dex was able to reduce the sub-G(1) peak, but it failed to block accumulation of cells in G(1), indicating that it's effect was specific for blockade of apoptosis, and not specific to an effect on FS alone. This study strongly suggests that glucocorticoids have a role to play in preventing vascular injury and they may provide the reason why statins are not inherently toxic to vascular endothelial cells, in vivo.", 
    "6": "Statins are known to exert a number of biological effects apart from reducing cholesterol synthesis. The results of recent studies indicate that patients treated with pravastatin have a lower prevalence of diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (AD). These observations prompted us to examine the effects of pravastatin on Alzheimer's peptide (Abeta(1-42))-induced pro-inflammatory activation in the human glioma cell line in vitro. Cells alone or cells pre-treated with pravastatin (0.1mg x ml(-1)) for 24h were stimulated with 5 microM of freshly dissolved Abeta(1-42) for the next 24h. The pre-treatment of cells with pravastatin diminished the capacity of Abeta to induce metalloproteinases, cytokine IL-6 and free radical levels. Although both pravastatin and Abeta(1-42) separately increased PPARgamma activity, the combination of Abeta(1-42) and pravastatin resulted in no effect on PPARgamma expression. These data indicate that soluble forms of Abeta(1-42), which are a potent stimulus of pro-inflammatory activation of glioma cells in vitro, could be a good target for pravastatin.",

The drug cost per year varies from euro 1940 for aspirin to euro 60,525 for statins. Assuming incremental changes only (for those not already on treatment), aspirin post MI will be added for 37 patients and produce 0.40 of a death prevented per year at a drug cost of euro 410 and statins will be added for 120 patients and prevent 2.26 deaths per year at a drug cost of euro 46,150.

Before the treatment, fibronectin was found to be positively correlated with CRP and total cholesterol (r=0.38, p<0.05 and r=0.33, p<0.05, respectively) and negatively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (r=-0.42, p<0.01) in patients with dyslipidaemia. High fibronectin levels (0.57 +/- 0.17 g/l) were found in patients with HDL-C below 35 mg/dl (0.57 +/- 0.09 g/l), compared to patients with HDL-C above 35 mg/dl (0.45 +/- 0.11 g/l). During the lipid-lowering therapy, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride and apo B levels were reduced while HDL-C and apo AI levels were increased.", 
    "14": "It was found that plasma fibronectin and CRP levels were decreased by lipid lowering therapy. Plasma fibronectin levels were associated with lipids, lipoproteins, CRP levels before treatment and these relationships disappeared after treatment. Consequently, it was suggested that reduction of plasma fibronectin levels, together with lipids and loss of its relationship with CRP, may play a role on the antiatherogenic effects of lipid-lowering therapy.", 
    "15": "Simvastatin is widely used in the treatment of hypercholestero-lemia. Recently, it was reported that it is also effective in reducing lethality in coronary heart disease. A simple and sensitive reversed-phase liquid chromatographic method has been developed and validated for the analysis of simvastatin in human plasma. Simvastatin and internal standard lovastatin in plasma were extracted with cyclohexane-dichloromethane (3.5:1, V/V), and then measured by HPLC using a Lichrospher C18 column as stationary phase and an acetonitrile-water (70:30, V/V) mixture as mobile phase. The flow rate was 1.2 mL/min. Simvastatin was quantified by UV at 237 nm. The calibration curve showed a good linearity in the mass concentration range of 0.25-50.0 micrograms/L. The regression equation is: Y = 0.0364 rho + 0.00583, r = 0.9998. Intra-day and inter-day coefficients of variation of assay for simvastatin in plasma < 7.94% and < 8.58%, respectively. The recoveries of simvastatin were > 93.3%. The method has been used to determine simvastatin in plasma from 12 healthy male volunteers.",

    "18": "Of 7,173 women invited and eligible to participate, information was obtained on 4,286 (60%). One in five women had a doctor diagnosis of any one of myocardial infarction, angina, heart failure, stroke, or peripheral vascular disease. Fifty per cent of women were hypertensive, 12% smoked, and over one quarter were obese. Fifty per cent had a total cholesterol level greater than 6.5 mmol/l, though only 3% had low high density lipoprotein concentrations. Cardiovascular disease prevalence varied by geographical region being highest in Scotland: age adjusted prevalence (95% confidence intervals) 25.0% (21.5% to 28.8%) and lowest in South England: age adjusted prevalence (95% confidence intervals) 15.4% (13.5% to 17.6%). The geographical variations in cardiovascular disease prevalence were attenuated by adjustment for risk factors and socioeconomic position; further adjustment for health service use (as indicated by aspirin or statin use) reduced the differences further. However, variation remained even after full adjustment for these factors: odds ratio (95% confidence intervals) comparing Midlands and Wales to South England 1.15 (0.82 to 1.61) and comparing Scotland to South England 1.53 (1.08 to 2.14). Of women with cardiovascular disease, 12% were current smokers, a third had uncontrolled hypertension, a third were obese, and 90% had a blood cholesterol over 5 mmol/l. Only 41% were taking antiplatelet drugs and 22% were taking a statin.",

    "20": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients more than 65 years old. Within this population, elevated cholesterol levels are prevalent and associated with increased risk of CHD. Despite increasing emphasis on lipid-lowering treatment in the elderly population, questions remain regarding secondary and primary prevention of CHD. According to current clinical trial evidence, lipid-lowering therapy, specifically with HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors, can reduce CHD morbidity and mortality without increased adverse effects in the elderly population. Lipid-lowering treatment should be considered for patients aged 65 to 75 years with a history of CHD or who are at moderate to high risk for CHD. Estrogen replacement therapy (ERT), which has also been shown to lower cholesterol levels, raises special considerations for postmenopausal women. However, recent findings suggest that postmenopausal women with a history of CHD should not be given estrogen solely for secondary prevention of CHD events.", 
    "21": "Despite important advances in the management of hypercholesterolemia in recent decades, many patients with lipid disorders remain unidentified or undertreated and so continue to have unfavorable levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and an increased risk for coronary events. The statins--which inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis--have proved to be the most powerful pharmacologic agents for lowering serum lipids, and newer statins offer even greater efficacy than the agents introduced 10 to 15 years ago. Studies have shown that rosuvastatin, in late-stage development, is a very potent agent for the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia, and that relatively low doses decrease LDL cholesterol levels to a greater extent than do similar doses of pravastatin, simvastatin, or atorvastatin as evaluated in separate clinical trials. Pitavastatin, in phase II trials, also has promise as a more potent drug than currently available statins. Because neither of these drugs has been approved for use in the United States, clinical trial results should be considered preliminary. In the future, agents that combine the actions of statins and nicotinic acid may achieve still greater LDL cholesterol reductions. Drugs that lower lipids via mechanisms other than inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase also offer promise. The newest addition to the roster of lipid-regulating agents is ezetimibe, a cholesterol absorption inhibitor that has been approved for use either alone or in combination with a statin. Agents in development include bile acid transport inhibitors and inhibitors of acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase. More research will be needed to determine the full clinical potential of such approaches to the management of hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "22": "The statins have proved to be some of the most potent therapies for reducing elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and lessening the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and related events. Nonetheless, there are still questions about the clinical relevance of individual drug characteristics, such as chemical derivation, solubility properties, and metabolic route, in terms of tolerability or therapeutic benefit. At the same time, no clear explanation has emerged for the significantly steeper reductions in LDL cholesterol levels achieved with atorvastatin versus lovastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, or fluvastatin, or, more recently, with rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin, although possible mechanisms have been suggested. More studies are needed to characterize the effects of statins on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in different patient groups. Clearly, though, several statins have yielded significant reductions in CHD risk and have shown to be well tolerated in both primary and secondary prevention trials. The possibility that statins exert pronounced effects beyond lowering blood lipids is opening other avenues of research into the benefits of these drugs.", 
    "23": "A large body of evidence demonstrates that statin therapy reduces risk for coronary events. This benefit probably stems in large part from lipid lowering, but lipid-independent cellular effects may also contribute. Statin therapy may lower the risk of thrombosis by reducing tissue factor expression and increasing plasminogen activators while reducing plasminogen-activator inhibitor. The statins may also improve endothelial function and reduce inflammatory response by increasing nitric oxide activity; all statins tested can decrease levels of C-reactive protein, a systemic marker of inflammation. Indeed, limiting inflammation may prove an important mechanism of statins' clinical benefits due to both lipid lowering and direct cellular effects. For example, attenuation of inflammation probably promotes maintained integrity of the fibrous cap of the atherosclerotic lesion by inhibiting processes that degrade the collagenous structure of the cap. Rupture of the fibrous cap causes most fatal coronary thrombosis.", 
    "24": "Newer, more effective statins are powerful agents for reducing elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and thereby lowering the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and related adverse events. Although LDL remains the primary target of therapy for reducing CHD risk, increased interest is focusing on apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing lipoprotein subfractions--particularly very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). VLDL remnants, and intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL)--as secondary targets of therapy. Elevated apoB is known to be an important risk factor for CHD, and dysregulation of the metabolism of apoB-containing lipoproteins is involved in the progression of atherosclerosis. Statins reduce circulating concentrations of atherogenic apoB-containing lipoproteins by decreasing the production of VLDL in the liver and, thus, the production of VLDL remnants and LDL. Statins also increase the clearance of these particles through upregulation of LDL receptors in the liver. Efforts to develop statins with enhanced lipid-modifying properties are ongoing. The optimal statin would offer a high degree of inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, a prolonged duration of action, hepatic selectivity for maximal upregulation of LDL receptors, and a low potential for drug-drug interactions. Recent studies have shown that rosuvastatin, a new agent in this class, demonstrates these qualities. Rosuvastatin is a highly effective inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, is relatively nonlipophilic, has a half-life of approximately 20 h, exhibits hepatic selectivity, has little systemic availability, and has a low potential for drug-drug interactions because of its limited degree of metabolism by the cytochrome P450 system. A recent double-blind, crossover study revealed that treatment with rosuvastatin resulted in marked reductions in apoB-containing lipoproteins in patients with type IIa or IIb dyslipidemia. By reducing the number of atherogenic lipoprotein particles, rosuvastatin decreases the atherosclerotic burden in hyperlipidemic patients at high risk for CHD and related adverse outcomes.", 
    "25": "Atherosclerosis was relatively uncommon 100 years ago, when researchers first established its link to elevated cholesterol. As the twentieth century progressed, however, factors such as high-fat diets, sedentary lifestyles, cigarette smoking, and urbanization combined to increase the prevalence of both hypercholesterolemia and coronary heart disease (CHD) throughout the developed world. Atherogenesis begins at an early age and progresses throughout life, and cholesterol levels during young adulthood strongly predict the risk of CHD and related mortality during the ensuing decades. The total cholesterol level in youth also determines the actual age at which a critical level of atherosclerosis will be reached. Early studies on the primary and secondary prevention of CHD failed to identify a linear relationship between lipid lowering and risk reduction, primarily because older lipid-lowering agents lacked the potency to reduce cholesterol levels significantly enough to achieve lower cardiovascular event and mortality rates. The introduction of the statins, with their powerful lipid-lowering activity, overcame this limitation. Several large-scale trials of statins firmly established the efficacy of these agents in both primary and secondary CHD prevention. With the availability of statin therapy, we are now able to reduce the risk of major adverse CHD events by an average of 30%, regardless of patient age or gender.", 
    "26": "Patients with elevated levels of serum triglycerides (TG) often have other associated lipid abnormalities (e.g., low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C]) and are at increased risk of developing coronary heart disease. Although the therapeutic benefits of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) in hypercholesterolemic patients have been well established, less is known about the effects of statins in patient populations with hypertriglyceridemia.", 
    "27": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the lipoprotein-altering efficacy of simvastatin in hypertriglyceridemic patients.", 
    "28": "This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. In all, 195 patients with fasting serum triglyceride levels between 300 and 900 mg/dl received once daily doses of placebo or simvastatin 20, 40, or 80 mg for 6 weeks.", 
    "29": "Compared with placebo, simvastatin treatment across all doses resulted in significant reductions (p < 0.05 - < 0.001) in serum levels of triglycerides (-20 to -31% decrease) and TG-rich lipoprotein particles. Significant (p < 0.001) reductions were also seen in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-25 to -35%) and non-HDL-C (-26 to -40%). Levels of HDL-C were increased (7-11%) in the simvastatin groups compared with placebo (p < 0.05 - < 0.001).", 
    "30": "The results of this study demonstrate the beneficial effects of simvastatin in patients with hypertriglyceridemia.", 
    "31": "Recent primary and secondary intervention studies have shown that reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with statins significantly reduced coronary heart disease (CHD) morbidity and mortality. However, many patients with dyslipidemia who have or are at risk for CHD do not reach target LDL-C goals. The recently updated National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III guidelines identify a group of patients at very high risk for CHD for more aggressive LDL-C reduction and reaffirm the importance of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) by raising the categorical threshold to 40 mg/dl. Lipid-lowering therapy needs to be more aggressive in both primary and secondary prevention settings, and therapy should be considered to increase HDL-C as well as lower LDL-C in order to improve patient outcomes. Both combination therapy and the next generation of statins may provide improved efficacy across the dyslipidemia spectrum.", 
    "32": "The mechanism involved in the clinically relevant drug-drug interaction (DDI) between cerivastatin (CER) and cyclosporin A (CsA) has not yet been clarified. In the present study, we examined the possible roles of transporter-mediated hepatic uptake in this DDI. The uptake of [(14)C]CER into human hepatocytes prepared from three different donors was examined. Kinetic analyses revealed K(m) values for the uptake of [(14)C]CER within the range of 3 to 18 microM, suggesting that more than 70% of the total uptake at therapeutic CER concentrations was accounted for by a saturable process, i.e., transporter-mediated uptake. This uptake was inhibited by CsA with K(i) values of 0.3 to 0.7 microM. The uptake of [(14)C]CER was also examined in human organic anion transporting polypeptide-2 (OATP2)-expressing Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCKII). Saturable OATP2-mediated uptake of [(14)C]CER was observed and was also inhibited by CsA, with a K(i) value of 0.2 microM. These results suggest that the DDI between CER and CsA involves the inhibition of transporter-mediated uptake of CER and, at least in part, its OATP2-mediated uptake. The effect of CsA on the in vitro metabolism of [(14)C]CER was also examined. The metabolism of [(14)C]CER was inhibited by CsA with an IC(50) value of more than 30 microM. From these results, we conclude that the DDI between CER and CsA is mainly due to the inhibition of transporter (at least partly OATP2)-mediated uptake in the liver.", 
    "33": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) exert favorable effects on lipoprotein metabolism, but may also possess anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, we explored the activities of simvastatin, a lipophilic statin, in a Th1-driven model of murine inflammatory arthritis. We report in this study that simvastatin markedly inhibited not only developing but also clinically evident collagen-induced arthritis in doses that were unable to significantly alter cholesterol concentrations in vivo. Ex vivo analysis demonstrated significant suppression of collagen-specific Th1 humoral and cellular immune responses. Moreover, simvastatin reduced anti-CD3/anti-CD28 proliferation and IFN-gamma release from mononuclear cells derived from peripheral blood and synovial fluid. Proinflammatory cytokine production in vitro by T cell contact-activated macrophages was suppressed by simvastatin, suggesting that such observations have direct clinical relevance. These data clearly illustrate the therapeutic potential of statin-sensitive pathways in inflammatory arthritis.", 
    "34": "Statins such as simvastatin are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors that inhibit cholesterol synthesis. We presently investigated statin effects on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in osteoblastic cells. Hydrophobic statins including simvastatin, atorvastatin, and cerivastatin-but not a hydrophilic statin, pravastatin-markedly increased VEGF mRNA abundance in nontransformed osteoblastic cells (MC3T3-E1). Simvastatin (10(-6) M) time-dependently augmented VEGF mRNA expression in MC3T3-E1 cells, mouse stromal cells (ST2), and rat osteosarcoma cells (UMR-106). According to heterogeneous nuclear RNA and Northern analyses, 10(-6) M simvastatin stimulated gene expression for VEGF in MC3T3-E1 cells without altering mRNA stability. Transcriptional activation of a VEGF promoter-luciferase construct (-1128 to +827), significantly increased by simvastatin administration. As demonstrated by gel mobility shift assay, simvastatin markedly enhanced the binding of hypoxia-responsive element-protein complexes. These results indicate that the stimulation of the VEGF gene by simvastatin in MC3T3-E1 cells is transcriptional in nature. VEGF secretion into medium was increased in MC3T3-E1 by 10(-6) M simvastatin. Pretreating MC3T3-E1 cells with mevalonate or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, a mevalonate metabolite, abolished simvastatin-induced VEGF mRNA expression; manumycin A, a protein prenylation inhibitor, mimicked statin effects on VEGF expression. The effect of simvastatin was blocked by pretreatment with wortmannin and LY294002, specific phosphatidylinositide-3 kinase inhibitors. Simvastatin enhanced mineralized nodule formation in culture, whereas coincubation with mevalonate, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, LY294002, or VEGF receptor 2 inhibitor (SU1498) abrogated statin-induced mineralization. Thus, statins stimulate VEGF expression in osteoblasts via reduced protein prenylation and the phosphatidylinositide-3 kinase pathway, promoting osteoblastic differentiation.", 
    "35": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylgutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors, commonly referred to as the statins, have proven therapeutic and preventative effects in cardiovascular diseases. Recently, there are emerging interests in their use as anticancer agents based on preclinical evidence of their antiproliferative, proapoptotic, anti-invasive, and radiosensitizing properties. Inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylgutaryl CoA reductase by the statins interferes with the rate-limiting step of the mevalonate pathway, leading to reduced levels of mevalonate and its downstream products, many of which play important roles in critical cellular functions such as membrane integrity, cell signaling, protein synthesis, and cell cycle progression. Perturbations of these processes in neoplastic cells by the statins may therefore result in control of tumor initiation, growth, and metastasis. The statins have demonstrated growth inhibitory activity in cancer cell lines and preclinical tumor models in animals. Phase I trials of statins in humans have demonstrated myotoxicity as their main dose-limiting toxicity, and Phase II trials in various tumor types are ongoing to evaluate their efficacy. Potential future directions in the development of the statins as anticancer agents include combinations with chemotherapeutic or other molecular-targeted agents, combinations with radiotherapy, maintenance therapy in minimal disease status, and as chemopreventive therapy.", 
    "36": "Seropositivity to cytomegalovirus (CMV) and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) may jointly predict increased mortality rates in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).

    "37": "We monitored 2315 patients with angiographically significant CAD (stenosis > or =70%) for an average of 2.4 years (maximum, 5.8 years). Anti-CMV IgG antibody levels and CRP concentrations were measured at baseline, and statin prescription was recorded. As previously reported, mortality rate was higher for CMV seropositivity (+) with high CRP (hazard ratio [HR], 2.0) and lower for statins (HR, 0.50). Compared with CMV(-)/low CRP (mortality rate, 5% with statin versus 4% without statin), the protective effect of statin therapy was markedly greater for CMV(+)/low CRP (mortality rate, 2% versus 7%; HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.16 to 1.3), CMV negative (-)/high CRP (mortality rate, 1% versus 8%; HR, 0.16), and CMV(+)/high CRP (mortality rate, 6% versus 17%; HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.70).

We measured CRP levels in 118 participants who had exercise-induced ischemia and in 111 who did not have inducible ischemia, as determined by stress echocardiography. We used logistic regression to examine the risk of exercise-induced ischemia associated with elevated CRP. We found that 75% (39/52) of participants in the highest CRP category (>0.38 mg/dL) had inducible ischemia, compared with 45% (79/177) in the lower 4 categories combined (adjusted odds ratio 4.2; 95% confidence interval 1.6 to 11; P=0.004). However, this association differed in users and nonusers of beta-blockers and statins. Among 89 participants who did not use beta-blockers, 93% in the highest CRP category had exercise-induced ischemia, compared with 42% in the lower 4 categories (P=0.03). Among 67 participants who did not use statins, 94% in the highest CRP category had exercise-induced ischemia, compared with 44% in the lower 4 categories (P=0.009).

    "42": "Advanced age is associated with a dramatic increase in the rates of venous and arterial thrombotic events. Increases in fibrinogen, factors VIII and IX, and other coagulation proteins, without a proportional increase in anticoagulant factors, likely contribute to this risk. Recent studies have delineated a role for genomic elements in controlling age-related expression of some coagulation proteins. Enhanced platelet activity as well as molecular and anatomic changes in the vessel wall also contribute to the thrombotic propensity. Advanced age is associated with elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein levels, indicating an inflammatory state that may be an important stimulus for thrombus formation in the elderly. Despite evidence of a prothrombotic state, many elderly people do not experience clinical thrombotic events. It is possible that the increase in coagulation proteins and activation markers conveys a survival advantage, such as inhibiting tumor angiogenesis. The recent epidemic in obesity may heighten thrombotic risks in the elderly because adipose tissue is an important source of inflammatory cytokines and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). As the population ages, further studies will be warranted to define the mechanisms for thrombosis in the elderly.", 
    "43": "We describe a method to decipher the complex inter-relationships between metabolite production trends and gene expression events, and show how information gleaned from such studies can be applied to yield improved production strains. Genomic fragment microarrays were constructed for the Aspergillus terreus genome, and transcriptional profiles were generated from strains engineered to produce varying amounts of the medically significant natural product lovastatin. Metabolite detection methods were employed to quantify the polyketide-derived secondary metabolites lovastatin and (+)-geodin in broths from fermentations of the same strains. Association analysis of the resulting transcriptional and metabolic data sets provides mechanistic insight into the genetic and physiological control of lovastatin and (+)-geodin biosynthesis, and identifies novel components involved in the production of (+)-geodin, as well as other secondary metabolites. Furthermore, this analysis identifies specific tools, including promoters for reporter-based selection systems, that we employed to improve lovastatin production by A. terreus.", 
    "44": "In the present study, we investigated the effects of statins on serum levels of soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L) in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).", 
    "45": "Atherosclerotic disease seems to involve inflammatory and immunologic mechanisms, and sCD40L has recently been identified as one of the key players in the atherosclerotic process. HMG-Co A reductase inhibitors, statins, have been recognized as immunomodulators and reduce cardiovascular events and mortality, but the effects of statins on sCD40L has not been clarified.", 
    "46": "In a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial, as part of the Atorvastatin versus Simvastatin on Atherosclerosis Progression (ASAP) trial, 110 patients with FH were given atorvastatin 80 mg/daily (n = 57) or simvastatin 40 mg/daily (n = 53) for two years.", 
    "47": "Our main findings were: 1) at baseline patients with FH had significantly higher (approximately 27-fold) serum levels of sCD40L than healthy controls; 2) statin therapy markedly decreased serum levels of sCD40L (approximately 40% reduction); 3) this decrease in sCD40L was found during both \"aggressive\" (i.e., atorvastatin) and \"conventional\" (i.e., simvastatin) statin therapy and was not correlated with the degree of reduction in cholesterol levels.", 
    "48": "Our findings may suggest enhanced CD40L-CD40 interaction in FH and that this inflammatory response may be downregulated by statins.", 
    "49": "Delayed chylomicron clearance is a characteristic of patients with coronary artery disease. In vivo study of the clearance of labeled chylomicron-like emulsions constitutes a valid model system for evaluation of chylomicron catabolism. The effects of atorvastatin at low (10 mg) and high (40 mg) dose upon the intravascular metabolism and plasma kinetics of chylomicron-like emulsions were evaluated in fasting hyperlipidemic subjects (n=45). Subjects were randomized to a 6-week treatment period with placebo (n=15), low dose or high dose atorvastatin (10 mg/day, n=17 and 40 mg/day, n=13). The chylomicron-like emulsion, double-labeled with 14C-Cholesteryl oleate (14C-CE) and 3H-triolein (3H-TG), was injected in a bolus after a 12-h fast, and blood samples were collected up to 60 min. Plasma decay curves were determined for labeled emulsion CE and TG and residence times (RT) calculated by the occupancy principle. The 14C-CE RT was decreased by 50% after low dose atorvastatin and by 73% after atorvastatin at high dose in comparison to placebo (P<0.05). The 3H-TG RT was significantly reduced (-55%) after high dose atorvastatin, but in contrast was not significantly reduced after placebo or low dose statin. By compartmental analysis, both doses of atorvastatin led to marked elevation in the slow removal component of emulsion remnant particles (10 mg/day=107%; 40 mg/day=195%, P=0.01). Equally, the rapid removal component was increased (+99%) at high dose (P=0.015). Recirculation of 3H-fatty acids was significantly reduced at both statin doses (43 and 83%, respectively) in comparison to placebo (P=0.01). In conclusion, atorvastatin treatment accelerates the plasma clearance of chylomicron-like emulsions and reduces recirculation of fatty acids in subjects with atherogenic hyperlipidemia. Such effect might implicate in reduction of cardiovascular risk.", 
    "50": "The aim of the present study was to investigate plasma levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an important endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, in populations at high risk for atherosclerosis as compared to healthy controls, and furthermore to evaluate the effect of cholesterol lowering therapy in individuals with hypercholesterolemia. The present study consisted of 32 men with untreated hypercholesterolemia (HC group), 38 individuals with well-controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (DM group) and 20 healthy individuals (controls). The HC subjects were randomly allocated into a double blinded, placebo-controlled cross-over designed study with 8 weeks treatment with pravastatin (40 mg/day) or matching placebo. ADMA levels were statistically significantly higher in DM and HC individuals as compared to controls (P<0.001 for both), and the L-arginine/ADMA ratios were significantly lower in both groups (P<0.001 and P<0.005, respectively). Significant reductions in total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C levels on pravastatin were obtained (P<0.001 for both), whereas no changes were observed in the levels of ADMA or the L-arginine/ADMA ratios. Statistically significant correlations between ADMA and TC and LDL-C were found (r=0.41, P<0.001 for both). In conclusion, significantly elevated ADMA levels and reduced L-arginine/ADMA ratios were found in individuals with diabetes type-1 as well as in hypercholesterolemia. Treatment with pravastatin 40 mg/day for 8 weeks had no effect on the levels of ADMA in hypercholesterolemic men.", 
    "51": "Little is known about the mechanism by which HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors affect inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression. We investigated the effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor cerivastatin on iNOS expression in cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Quiescent VSMCs were incubated with or without various concentrations of drugs as follows: cerivastatin, C3 exoenzyme or Y-27632. Then, pretreated VSMCs were stimulated by a vehicle or interleukin (IL)-1beta (10 ng/ml). Treatment of VSMCs with cerivastatin (10(-7)-10(-5) mol/l), which inhibits isoprenylation of Rho and other small G proteins, significantly increased nitrite/nitrate (NOx) production and upregulated the expression of iNOS mRNA in IL-1beta-stimulated VSMCs. This effect of cerivastatin was abolished by cotreatment with mevalonate (2x10(-4) mol/l) or geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate (GGPP) (10(-5) mol/l), but not by farnesyl-pyrophosphate (10(-5) mol/l). Furthermore, C3 exoenzyme (50 microg/ml), an inactivator of Rho protein, and Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 (10(-5) mol/l) also enhanced NOx production and the expression of iNOS mRNA in IL-1beta-stimulated VSMCs. Immunocytochemical study revealed that cerivastatin, C3 exoenzyme and Y-27632 did not affect the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB in IL-1beta-stimulated VSMCs. Our study suggests that cerivastatin stimulates iNOS expression in IL-1beta treated VSMCs by its inhibitory effect on Rho/Rho kinase pathway. In addition, this effect of cerivastatin, by enhancing iNOS expression, may contribute to the prevention of restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention and protect against atherothrombosis.", 
    "52": "It has been shown that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) modulate vascular smooth muscle cell functions. In the present study, we investigated the effect of simvastatin on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release, and the underlying mechanism, in a rat aortic smooth muscle cell line, A10 cells. Administration of simvastatin increased the VEGF level in rat plasma in vivo. In cultured cells, simvastatin significantly stimulated VEGF release in a dose-dependent manner. Simvastatin induced the phosphorylation of p44/p42 MAP kinase but not p38 MAP kinase or SAPK (stress-activated protein kinase)/JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase). PD98059 and U-0126, inhibitors of the upstream kinase that activates p44/p42 MAP kinase, significantly reduced the simvastatin-induced VEGF release in a dose-dependent manner. The phosphorylation of p44/p42 MAP kinase induced by simvastatin was reduced by PD98059 or U-0126. Moreover, a bolus injection of PD98059 truly suppressed the simvastatin-increased VEGF level in rat plasma in vivo. These results strongly suggest that p44/p42 MAP kinase plays a role at least partly in the simvastatin-stimulated VEGF release in vascular smooth muscle cells.", 
    "53": "Sterols accelerate degradation of the ER enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMG CoA reductase), which catalyzes a rate-controlling step in cholesterol biosynthesis. This degradation contributes to feedback inhibition of synthesis of cholesterol and nonsterol isoprenoids. Here, we show that degradation of HMG CoA reductase is accelerated by the sterol-induced binding of its sterol-sensing domain to the ER protein insig-1. Accelerated degradation is inhibited by overexpression of the sterol-sensing domain of SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), suggesting that both proteins bind to the same site on insig-1. Whereas insig-1 binding to SCAP leads to ER retention, insig-1 binding to HMG CoA reductase leads to accelerated degradation that is blocked by proteasome inhibitors. Insig-1 appears to play an essential role in the sterol-mediated trafficking of two proteins with sterol-sensing domains, HMG CoA reductase and SCAP.", 
    "54": "Histopathologically, Alzheimer's disease is characterized by plaques and tangles that develop progressively over time. Experimental data described a statin-induced decrease in beta-amyloid production, a major constituent of the plaques. Others reported data on statin-mediated changes in neuronal survival and cytoskeleton, including the microtubule-associated protein tau, a major constituent of the tangles. However, these latter reports remain contradictory. To clarify and extend our knowledge on the effect of statin on the cytoskeleton, we challenged rat primary neuron cultures by lovastatin and determined the metabolite that is critical for structural integrity and survival of neurons. During the blockade of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, the neuritic network was affected and eventually was completely destroyed. This process was not part of the execution phase of apoptosis and was marked by alterations in the microfilament and microtubule system. The distribution and phosphorylation of protein tau changed. Immunoblot analysis and indirect immunofluorescence revealed a transient increase in tau phosphorylation, which ceased during the execution of apoptosis. All of these effects could be linked to the lack of the geranylgeranylpyrophosphate intermediate. Inhibition of the geranylgeranylation of Rho family GTPases (geranylgeranyl-transferase I) evoked similar changes in neurons. These data and our findings that statin treatment reduced the membrane-bound fraction of RhoA-GTPase in neurons suggest that reduced levels of functional small G proteins are responsible for the observed effects. Our data demonstrate that lovastatin concentrations able to suppress not only cholesterol but also geranylgeranylpyrophosphate formation may evoke phosphorylation of tau reminiscent of preclinical early stages of Alzheimer's disease and, when prolonged, apoptosis.",

Healthy male volunteers (n = 14) received ketoconazole 200 mg or placebo twice daily for 7 days, and rosuvastatin 80 mg was coadministered on day 4 of dosing. Plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin, and active and total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were measured up to 96 h postdose.", 
    "57": "Following coadministration with ketoconazole, rosuvastatin geometric least square mean AUC(0,t) and Cmax were unchanged compared with placebo (treatment ratios (90% confidence intervals): 1.016 (0.839, 1.230), 0.954 (0.722, 1.260), respectively). Rosuvastatin accounted for essentially all of the circulating active HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and most (> 85%) of the total inhibitors. Ketoconazole did not affect the proportion of circulating active or total inhibitors accounted for by circulating rosuvastatin.", 
    "58": "Ketoconazole did not produce any change in rosuvastatin pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects. The data suggest that neither cytochrome P450 3A4 nor P-gp-mediated transport contributes to the elimination of rosuvastatin.",

However, the relations among cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction, the timing of the antiplatelet effect, the involved mechanisms and the doses of each statin able to reduce platelet function are not actually well known. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of simvastatin (20 mg day-1), atorvastatin (10 mg day-1), fluvastatin (40 mg day-1) and pravastatin (40 mg day-1) on platelet function in hypercholesterolaemic subjects with relation to (LDL-C), oxidized-LDL (ox-LDL) and antiport mechanism modifications.",

Pox-LDL are modulated early by simvastatin, atorvastatin and fluvastatin Pox-LDL (r = 0.66, 0.65 and 0.52; P < 0.001, 0.001 and 0.01, respectively) whereas LDL-C and ox-LDL reductions associated to modifications of antiport activity act later.

Policosanol is a cholesterol-lowering drug purified from sugar cane wax with a therapeutic dosage range from 5-20 mg/day. Atorvastatin is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor which across its dosage range (10-80 mg/day) has shown significantly greater lipid-lowering effects than all previously marketed statins.",

    "65": "This randomised, single-blind, parallel-group study was conducted in older patients (60-80 years) with type II hypercholesterolaemia. After 4 weeks on a cholesterol-lowering diet, 75 patients were randomised to policosanol or atorvastatin 10mg tablets taken once daily with the evening meal for 8 weeks.

At study completion, policosanol significantly (p < 0.0001) reduced serum TC (16.4%), LDL-C/HDL-C ratio (25.5%) and TC/HDL-C ratio (19.3%), as well as (p < 0.001) triglyceride levels (15.4%). Atorvastatin significantly (p < 0.0001) decreased serum TC (22.6%), LDL-C/HDL-C (26.2%) and TC/HDL-C (19.8%) ratios, as well as (p < 0.001) triglyceride levels (15.5%). Atorvastatin was significantly more effective than policosanol in reducing LDL-C and TC, but similar in reducing both atherogenic ratios and triglyceride levels. Policosanol, but not atorvastatin, significantly (p < 0.05) increased serum HDL-C levels by 5.3%. Both treatments were well tolerated. At study completion, atorvastatin mildly, but significantly (p < 0.05) increased creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and creatinine, whereas policosanol significantly reduced AST and glucose (p < 0.01) and CPK (p < 0.05) levels. All individual values, however, remained within normal limits. Three atorvastatin but no policosanol patients withdrew from the study because of adverse events: muscle cramps (1 patient), gastritis (1 patient) and uncontrolled hypertension, abdominal pain and myalgia (1 patient). Overall, no policosanol and seven atorvastatin patients (18.9%) reported a total of nine mild or moderate adverse events during the study (p < 0.01).",

Policosanol, but not atorvastatin, however, significantly increased serum HDL-C levels, whereas both drugs similarly reduced atherogenic ratios and serum triglycerides. Policosanol was better tolerated than atorvastatin as revealed by patient withdrawal analysis and overall frequency of adverse events.

Combination therapy with cholestyramine failed to lower the TC and LDL to the levels recommended by the NCEP guidelines.", 
    "69": "Medical drugs are usually grouped together because they exhibit identical or similar chemical and pharmacological properties. Thus, for example, all known statins lower morbidity and mortality in coronary patients. In the meantime, three beta blockers have been shown to have a life-prolonging effect in mild-to-moderate cardiac insufficiency. The question is: to what extent are the preparations interchangeable? The beta blockers in particular manifest numerous other properties--such as beta 1 selectivity, vasodilatory or antioxidative actions which, under certain circumstances may even be decisive for the success or failure of treatment. The mortality-lowering effect of high-dose ACE inhibitors in patients with a high cardiovascular risk has to date, been shown only for a single preparation. For others, the high dose (effect) has yet to be confirmed. Also, with every new substance, a new side effect profile is introduced, which may result from the tiniest alteration to the active agent molecule, but also by a different preparation method. In consequence, unexpected effects, such as allergic reactions, may occur. This not only makes the grouping of similar substances, but also the interchange of \"me-too\" or generic preparations, problematic.",

    "76": "The development of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) has been a very significant development in the management of coronary artery disease. Large prospective clinical trials have provided unequivocal evidence that cholesterol lowering therapy with statins reduces all-cause mortality in patients with coronary artery disease. There is now accumulating data indicating that statin treatment should be initiated early after an acute coronary syndrome. This body of evidence is based on large databases in which investigators compared outcomes among patients taking statins with those patients who were not prescribed cholesterol lowering therapy. Prospective, randomized, clinical trials also indicate that early statin therapy reduces recurrent ischemia. Finally, studies examining long-term compliance with statin therapy suggest increased adherence to therapy when statins are prescribed during the initial hospitalization for an acute coronary syndrome. In tandem with these clinical observations, there is a large body of scientific data that highlights many important cellular and molecular mechanisms through which statins may confer early benefit. These effects involve relatively rapid improvement in endothelial function, antiischemic, antithrombotic and antiinflammatory actions of statins.", 
    "77": "Statins are currently used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Recently, we demonstrated that cerivastatin also reduces the proliferation and invasion of aggressive breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231. In this report, a molecular mechanism to explain its anti-cancer action is proposed by combining the study of cerivastatin effect on both gene expression (microarray) and signal transduction pathways. Firstly, the expression of 13 genes was modified by cerivastatin and confirmed at protein level. They could contribute to the inhibition of both cell proliferation (down-regulation of cyclin D1, PCNA, c-myc and up-regulation p21(Waf1), p19(INK4d), integrin beta8) and cell invasion, either directly (decrease in u-PA, MMP-9, u-PAR, PAI-1 and increase in anti-oncogenes Wnt-5a and H-cadherin) or indirectly by stimulating an anti-angiogenic gene (thrombospondin-2). The anti-angiogenic activity was confirmed by in vivo experiments. Secondly, we demonstrated that the biochemical mechanism of its anti-cancer action could be mainly explained by the inhibition of RhoA-dependent cell signalling. This hypothesis was supported by the fact that a RhoA inhibitor (C3 exoenzyme) or a dominant negative mutant RhoA (N19RhoA) induced similar effects to those of cerivastatin. In conclusion, cerivastatin, by preventing RhoA prenylation, inhibits (i) the RhoA/ROCK pathway, leading to defective actin stress fibres formation responsible for the loss of traction forces required for cell motility and (ii) the RhoA/FAK/AKT signalling pathway that could explain the majority of cancer-related gene modifications described above. Thus, the inhibition of RhoA cell signalling could be a good strategy in therapy of aggressive forms of breast cancer.",

Statin therapies have been shown to reduce cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and death, significantly, by altering vascular atherosclerosis development in patients with or without coronary artery disease symptoms. Extensive use of statins has led to the increase of some undesirable effects that are heavily counterbalanced by the benefits. Indeed, pleiotropic effects extend far beyond cholesterol reduction and involve non-lipid-related mechanisms that modify endothelial functions, immunoinflammatory responses, smooth muscle cell activation, proliferation and migration, atherosclerotic plaque stability, and thrombus formation.

This toxicity has been attributed to statin inhibition of Ras isoprenylation in tumors like AML where oncogenic ras mutations and/or overexpression are common. We show that mevastatin kills certain AML cell lines and is more toxic to a majority of primary AML cell samples than to myeloid cells in bone marrow (BM) samples from normal donors, and that mevastatin can produce more than additive kill with standard chemotherapeutics. Mevastatin reduces Ras membrane localization, but statin sensitivity in primary AML cells is not consistently associated with ras mutations nor with Ras overexpression, suggesting that another mevalonate pathway by-product(s) is the statin target in at least some AMLs.", 
    "89": "Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, known as statins, are widely used for primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery atherosclerosis. Pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is multistep processes where transendothelial migration of various leukocytes including monocytes is a crucial step. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) contributes in this process by activating macrophages and T-lymphocytes, and by inducing adhesion molecules in vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells. In this study we investigated the expression of intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in transformed endothelial cell line ECV304 cells as influenced by lovastatin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and IFN-gamma. Results show that lovastatin suppresses expression of ICAM-1 by inhibiting the IFN-gamma-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) p44/p42-STAT1 signaling pathway. In cells treated with lovastatin and IFN-gamma, ICAM-1 was expressed at a lower level than in cells treated with IFN-gamma alone. However, lovastatin does not reduce TNF-alpha induced expression of ICAM-1. A similar result was observed in cells treated with the MEKK inhibitor PD98059 and IFN-gamma. Cis-acting DNA sequence elements were identified in the 5'-flanking region of the ICAM-1 promoter that mediate inhibition by lovastatin; these sequences map to the IFN-gamma activated site which also binds the STAT1 homodimer. However, lovastatin did not inhibit IFN-gamma-mediated induction of the Y701 phosphorylated form of STAT1. But lovastatin does inhibit the IFN-gamma-mediated phosphorylation of ERK1/ERK2 (T202/Y204) and S727 phosphorylation of STAT1. TNF-alpha does not induce phosphorylation of ERK1/ERK2 and S727 in ECV304 and smooth muscle cells. The results provide the evidences that statins may have beneficial effects by inhibiting IFN-gamma action in atherosclerotic process",

By switching the positive and negative voltage, the three analytes were determined with a 4 min chromatographic run and with instrumental detection limits of 1-3 pg. This analytical method, using a microbore LC column combined with solid-phase extraction, was applied successfully to the determination of trace levels of the above pharmaceuticals in aqueous samples. Atorvastatin was detected in a sewage treatment plant final effluent.",

Muscle histochemistry revealed ragged-red fibers and cytochrome c oxidase negative (COX) fibers, and biochemistry showed a defect of COX activity. Immunoblot analysis showed a 60% reduction of COX I and COX II polypeptides. Cerivastatin myotoxicity might be related to a depletion of essential metabolites needed to anchor COX subunit I to mitochondrial membrane.", 
    "92": "Recent data suggest that the statins, apart from their lipid-lowering activity, exhibit profound anti-inflammatory effects. Basophils are major proinflammatory effector cells in diverse pathologic reactions. We have examined the in vitro effects of five different statins on primary human basophils, their progenitors, and the basophil cell line KU-812. Preincubation of blood basophils with cerivastatin or atorvastatin (0.1-100 microM) for 24 h reduced their capacity to release histamine on immunoglobulin E (IgE)-dependent stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. These statins also inhibited IgE-dependent up-regulation of the basophil-activation antigen CD203c. Moreover, both statins suppressed interleukin-3-induced differentiation of basophils from their progenitors as well as (3)H-thymidine uptake in KU-812 cells. All inhibitory effects of cerivastatin and atorvastatin were reversed by mevalonic acid (200 microM). The other statins tested (lovastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin) did not show significant inhibitory effects on basophils. Together, these data identify cerivastatin and atorvastatin as novel inhibitors of growth and activation of human basophils.",

Monascus at the dosage of 0.0, 0.6, 1.2 g/(d.kg BW) was administrated for 28 days. Normal control group was fed with standard rat chow. Rats in 0.0 g/kg BW group became hypercholesterolemia clearly. Monascus decreased TC, TG, and increased HDL-C significantly in the experimental groups. Monascus can significantly increase the deformability of erythrocyte(IDEI) and decrease aggregation index(AI), platelet adhesion rate(PADT) and blood viscosity at the shear rate of 5 s-1. No significant difference of platelet aggregation (PAGT) in groups was observed.",

    "95": "Our studies uncovered several new features that distinguish SCAP ligand from lovastatin, a classic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, and from OM, which utilize an SREBP-independent regulatory pathway. We show that the induction of LDLR mRNA expression by GW707 is not affected by intracellular cholesterol but is completely abolished by blocking de novo protein synthesis. Moreover, the effects of GW707 but not lovastatin on LDLR promoter activity, mRNA expression, and uptake of 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanin perchlorate-LDL are markedly enhanced by OM. We further demonstrate that the amounts of the mature form of SREBP-2 translocated to the nucleus under GW707 treatment are increased by costimulating cells with OM.",

The inhibitory effects of statins on NF-kappaB or AP-1-dependent transcriptional activity were examined by transient transfection studies. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors upregulated IkappaB-alpha protein levels in endothelial cells and decreased c-Jun mRNA expression in smooth muscle cells as analyzed by Western and Northern blotting, respectively.

The objective of this study was to examine the possibility that the protective effect observed in female mice depends on the up-regulation and/or activation of endothelial cell NO synthase (eNOS). Anesthetized female and male wild-type or eNOS-deficient C57BL/6 mice were subjected to 70% liver ischemia for 45 min followed by resection of the remaining 30% nonischemic lobes and reperfusion of ischemic tissue. Survival was monitored daily, whereas liver injury was quantified by using serum alanine aminotransferase determinations and histopathology. Hepatic eNOS mRNA, protein, and enzymatic activity were determined in male and female mice subjected to RSL+I/R. We found that liver injury was reduced and survival increased in female mice compared with males. This protective effect correlated with significant increases in hepatic eNOS message levels and enzyme activity but not protein expression compared with males subjected to the surgery. Furthermore, N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester-treated or eNOS-deficient female mice responded to RSL+I/R with dramatic increases in liver injury and 100% mortality within 2 days of surgery. Finally, we found that pravastatin pretreatment significantly attenuated hepatocellular injury and increased survival of male mice, which was associated with enhanced expression of eNOS message. We conclude that the protective effect afforded female mice is due to the activation of hepatic eNOS activity and enhanced NO production.", 
    "105": "1. Pitavastatin is a potent competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase little metabolized in hepatic microsomes. Pitavastatin lactone, which can be converted back to the unchanged form, is the major metabolite of pitavastatin in humans. To clarify the mechanism of the lactonization of pitavastatin and the metabolic properties of the lactone, we performed experiments in vitro. 2. On addition of UDP-glucuronic acid, human hepatic microsomes produced pitavastatin lactone and an unknown metabolite (UM-2). UM-2 was converted to its unchanged form by enzymatic hydrolysis and to a lactone form non-enzymatically. Using several human UGT-expressing microsomes, UGT1A3 and UGT2B7 were principally responsible for glucuronidation of pitavastatin leading to lactonization. 3. No marked difference in intrinsic clearance between pitavastatin and its lactone form was detected in human hepatic microsomes. 4. Pitavastatin lactone showed no inhibitory effects on CYP2C9- and CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of model substrates in contrast to other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. 5. The mechanism of pitavastatin lactone formation has been clarified, in that glucuronidation by UGT occurs first followed by lactonization via an elimination reaction. It was also found that pitavastatin lactone demonstrates no drug-drug interactions.", 
    "106": "Simvastatin rapidly induced cataracts in young Chbb:Thom (CT) but not Sprague Dawley (SD) or Hilltop Wistar (HW) rats. Oral treatment for 14 but not 7 days committed CT rat lenses to cataract formation. The cholesterol to phospholipid molar ratio in lenses of treated CT rats was unchanged. Differences between strains in serum and ocular humor levels of simvastatin acid poorly correlated with susceptibility to cataracts. No significant differences were found between rat strains in the capacity of simvastatin acid to inhibit lens-basal sterol synthesis. Prolonged treatment with simvastatin comparably elevated HMG-CoA reductase protein and enzyme activity in lenses of both cataract resistant and sensitive strains. However, in contrast to SD and HW rats, where sterol synthesis was markedly increased, sterol synthesis in CT rat lenses remained at baseline. Discordant expression of sterol synthesis in CT rats may be due to inadequate upregulation of lens HMG-CoA synthase. HMG-CoA synthase protein levels, and to a much lesser extent mRNA levels, increased in lens cortex of SD but not CT rats. Because upregulation of the sterol pathway may result in increased formation of isoprene-derived anti-inflammatory substances, failure to upregulate the pathway in CT rat lenses may reflect an attenuated compensatory response to injury that resulted in cataracts.", 
    "107": "We recently demonstrated that squalene synthase (SQS) inhibitors reduce plasma triglyceride through an LDL receptor-independent mechanism in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits (Hiyoshi et al. 2001. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 431: 345-352). The present study deals with the mechanism of the inhibition of triglyceride biosynthesis by the SQS inhibitors ER-27856 and RPR-107393 in rat primary cultured hepatocytes. Atorvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, had no effect on triglyceride biosynthesis, but reversed the inhibitory effect of the SQS inhibitors. A squalene epoxidase inhibitor, NB-598, affected neither triglyceride biosynthesis nor its inhibition by ER-27856 and RPR-107393. The reduction of triglyceride biosynthesis by ER-27856 and RPR-107393 was potentiated by mevalonolactone supplementation. Treatment of hepatocytes with farnesol and its derivatives reduced triglyceride biosynthesis. In addition, we found that ER-27856 and RPR-107393 significantly reduced the incorporation of [1-(14)C]acetic acid into oleic acid, but not the incorporation of [1-(14)C]oleic acid into triglyceride. Though ER-27856 and RPR-107393 increased mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation, the inhibition of beta-oxidation by RS-etomoxir had little effect on their inhibition of triglyceride biosynthesis. These results suggest that SQS inhibitors reduce triglyceride biosynthesis by suppressing fatty acid biosynthesis via an increase in intracellular farnesol and its derivatives.", 
    "108": "Clofibrate is a hypolipidemic drug belonging to the peroxisome proliferator (PP) family. PPs are well-recognized hepatocarcinogens, though only for rodents and not for humans. Their oncogenicity is usually ascribed to mitogenic or antiapoptotic action. However, we have reported that clofibrate can trigger fast and extensive apoptosis in rodent and human tumor cell lines. The present study examines the possible mechanisms involved in clofibrate-induced apoptosis in AH-130 hepatoma cells. The results show that the apoptogenic effect of clofibrate does not depend on induction of peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs), but on interference with HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR), a key enzyme that regulates cholesterol biosynthesis and production of isoprenoid units for protein farnesylation. The level and activity of HMGR mRNA are reduced in clofibrate-treated AH-130 cells and apoptosis can be partially prevented by addition of mevalonate. Moreover, cholesterol and cholesterol ester content decreases early in mitochondria, and cytocrome c is released in the cytosol. On the contrary, perturbations at the level of protein farnesylation are not important in determining the fast apoptogenic effect, since treatment of AH-130 cells with an inhibitor of farnesyltransferase induces apoptosis only after 4 h. In conclusion, inhibition of HMGR and decreased cholesterol content are crucial events in clofibrate-induced apoptosis in AH-130 hepatoma cells.", 
    "109": "Numerous studies in vitro have shown a close relationship between the chemical structure and biologic activity of flavonoids, whereby their basic structure is modified to increase or decrease their biologic activity. The effects of naringenin (1) and its synthetic derivative, naringenin 7-O-cetyl ether (2), on the lipid profile, the cholesterol-regulating enzyme activity and the excretion of sterol were compared in rats fed a high-cholesterol (1% wt/wt) diet. Either 1 or 2 was supplemented with a high-cholesterol diet for 6 weeks at a dose of 0.073 mmol/100g diet. The supplementation of 1 or 2 significantly lowered the levels (mean+/-SE) of the plasma total cholesterol (4.93+/-0.19 and 4.75+/-0.16 mmol/L vs 5.87+/-0.36 mmol/L, p<0.05) and hepatic triglyceride (0.12+/-0.01 and 0.11+/-0.01 mmol/g vs 0.18+/-0.01 mmol/g, p<0.05) and cholesterol (0.23+/-0.01 and 0.21+/-0.01 mmol/g vs 0.31+/-0.01 mmol/g, p<0.05) compared to those of the control. The compound 1 or 2 supplementation appeared to decrease the excretion of neutral sterols. The plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration and ratio of HDL to total cholesterol were significantly higher in 1 and 2 groups than in control group. Although the biological effect of 2 on inhibiting hepatic HMG-CoA reductase and ACAT activities was only significant compared to the control group, both compounds exhibited a significant hypocholesterolemic effect in rats fed a high-cholesterol diet. The results suggest that cholesterol biosynthesis and esterification were concomitantly reduced by 2, as indicated by the decreased HMG-CoA reductase and ACAT activities.",

    "114": "The search for potent and efficacious inhibitors of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase (HMGRI) was the focus of considerable research in the 1980s. Building on the discovery of the fungal metabolite-derived inhibitors, mevastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin, a number of totally synthetic inhibitors were discovered and developed. This manuscript describes the discovery and development of one of those synthetic inhibitors, atovastatin calcium, currently marketed in the United States as LIPITOR. This inhibitor was designed based in part on molecular modeling comparisons of the structures of the fungal metabolites and other synthetically derived inhibitors. In addition to development of the structure-activity relationships which led to atorvastatin calcium, another critical aspect of the development of this area was the parallel improvement in the chemistry required to prepare compounds of the increased synthetic complexity needed to potently inhibit this enzyme. Ultimately, the development of several chiral syntheses of enantiomerically pure atorvastatin calcium was accomplished through a collaborative effort between discovery and development. The impact of the progress of the required chemistry as well as external factors on internal decision-making with regards to the development of atorvastatin calcium will be discussed.",

Numerous multicenter trials have shown the effectiveness of statins in lowering cholesterol concentration, slowing down progression of atherosclerosis, and in decreasing number of cardio-vascular incidents. However, since the discovery of statins experiments have been carried out showing other mechanisms of action of these drugs. Many circumstances expose the antiproliferative, and antiinflammatory influence of HMGCoA reductase inhibitors. This paper presents a review of the studies on these mechanisms with a special emphasis on their nephroprotective role.", 
    "116": "Increased circulating cholesterol is known to promote risk of coronary artery disease. It is now emerging that cholesterol promotes production and accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) deposited in the hallmark pathologic lesion of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the senile plaque, perhaps by shifting away from normal metabolism of amyloid beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) to beta. Previous studies employing the cholesterol-fed rabbit model of AD demonstrated that induction of AD-like Abeta accumulation in brain could be reversed by co-administration of cholesterol lowering drugs or removing cholesterol, prompted initiation of an AD Cholesterol-Lowering (Statin) Treatment Trial. We now present data that identify a previously unrecognized role for dietary water quality on the severity of neuropathology induced by elevated cholesterol. Neuronal accumulation of Abeta induced by increased circulating concentrations of cholesterol in the New Zealand white rabbit is attenuated when distilled drinking water is administered compared to use of tap water. The numbers of neurons in cholesterol-fed rabbits that exhibited Abeta immunoreactivity, relative to normal chow-fed controls, increased approximately 2.5 fold among animals on tap water but only approximately 1.9 fold among animals on distilled water. This yielded a statistically significant approximately 28% reduction due to the use of distilled water. In addition, the subjectively assessed intensity of neuronal Abeta immunoreactivity was consistently reduced among cholesterol-fed rabbits allowed distilled drinking water compared to cholesterol-fed rabbits on tap water. As intensity of antibody immunoreactivity is likely related to concentration of antigen, the identified difference among cholesterol-fed rabbits allowed distilled drinking water may hold greater importance than a significant reduction in numbers of affected neurons. The effect on neuronal Abeta immunoreactivity intensity was observable among cholesterol-fed rabbits reared and allowed tap water when performing studies in three distinct locales. Pilot data suggest the possibility of increased clearance of Abeta from the brain, identified as increased blood levels, among cholesterol-fed rabbits administered distilled water compared to animals on tap water. The agent(s) occurring in tap water, excluded by distillation, promoting accumulation of neuronal Abeta immunoreactivity is(are) yet undisclosed, but arsenic, manganese, aluminum, zinc, mercury, iron and nitrate have tentatively been excluded because they were not identifiable (below detection limits) in the tap water of the three locales where the cholesterol-induced neuropathologic difference was observable. These findings suggest that water quality may impact on human health in the setting of increased circulating cholesterol levels, and could illustrate a truly simple life-style change that could be of benefit in AD.",

Pretreatment with fluvastatin (approximately 5 micromol/L) for 24 hours significantly inhibited Ang II (1 micromol/L)-mediated DNA synthesis and c-fos promoter activity in cultured VSMCs. Moreover, pretreatment of VSMCs with fluvastatin significantly inhibited Ang II-mediated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation and tyrosine- and serine-phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1 and STAT3. AT1 receptor-mediated recruitment of Rac-1 to Janus kinase (Jak) family/STATs was also inhibited by fluvastatin.

    "126": "HMG-CoA reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme for cholesterol synthesis and its inhibition exerts profound effects on cellular metabolism. Inhibitors of this enzyme are used in clinical practice to lower plasma cholesterol levels and are commonly collectively referred to as 'statins'. A number of in vitro, in vivo animal, and clinical studies suggest that properties of statins other than cholesterol lowering may be of biological importance. These diverse properties are often referred to as 'pleiotropic' and suggest that statins may affect a number of diseases of ageing. In this article we review the biological plausibility and clinical evidence of a role for statins in modulating two diseases of ageing: osteoporosis and dementia (including Alzheimer's disease). In both diseases, there is a sound cellular and laboratory basis for a plausible therapeutic effect of statins. In the case of osteoporosis, there are conflicting data regarding clinical benefit, with both negative and positive results reported. In particular, secondary analyses of randomised, controlled studies have shown no reduction of fracture risk by statins. In the case of dementia there are fewer clinical studies but there is clear anticipated benefit in macrovascular dementias attributable to statin-mediated reduction of the risk of stroke. Overall, there are a lack of prospective, placebo-controlled, randomised data testing statins and modulation of the risk of osteoporosis-related fracture or of clinical dementia, where these are primary outcomes. Until such data are available, the use of statins appears promising but cannot be recommended as a primary therapeutic modality for either condition.", 
    "127": "The rate-limiting enzyme for mevalonate and cholesterol synthesis in mammalian cells is 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase. Control occurs through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional actions signaled by the end product, cholesterol, and by isoprenoid intermediates. End products of plant mevalonate metabolism, i.e., plant-derived isoprenoids, also suppress mammalian HMG-CoA reductase. Previous studies reported that isoprenoids suppress reductase synthesis at a post-transcriptional level. We tested the hypothesis that plant-derived isoprenoids also regulate mammalian HMG-CoA reductase synthesis at a post-transcriptional level by incubating lovastatin-treated C100 cells with mevalonate or a plant-derived isoprenoid (the monoterpenes, limonene, perillyl alcohol or geraniol) either alone or combined with the oxysterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OH C). Mevalonate decreased HMG-CoA reductase synthesis and mRNA levels by 65 and 66%, respectively (P < 0.05). The cyclic monoterpenes, limonene and perillyl alcohol, lowered HMG-CoA reductase synthesis by 70 and 89%, respectively (P < 0.05); although neither reduced HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels (P = 0.88). Geraniol, an acyclic monoterpene, suppressed HMG-CoA reductase synthesis by 98% and lowered mRNA levels by 66% (P < 0.05). A combination of 25-OH C and either mevalonate or any three monoterpenes reduced HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels (P < 0.05) compared with lovastatin-only treated cells. However, the dual combination of 25-OH C and either mevalonate or a monoterpene resulted in a greater decrease in HMG-CoA reductase synthesis than in mRNA levels. The difference between changes in HMG-CoA reductase synthesis and mRNA levels reflects a specific effect of isoprenoids on HMG-CoA reductase synthesis at the translational level. Mevalonate enhanced HMG-CoA reductase degradation, but no such effect was observed for the monoterpenes. These results indicate that the three plant-derived isoprenoids primarily suppress HMG-CoA reductase synthesis at a post-transcriptional level by attenuating HMG-CoA reductase mRNA translational efficiency.", 
    "128": "When cytokinin-autonomous tobacco BY-2 cell cultures are transferred into 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)-deprived medium, amyloplast development is initiated. Using this in vitro amyloplast-inducing system, the role of cytokinins in amyloplast formation was investigated. We show that addition of lovastatin, an inhibitor of mevalonate synthesis, to amyloplast-inducing medium reduced starch accumulation. Microscopic observation also revealed that lovastatin treatment decreased starch deposition; however, the overall morphologies of cells and plastids were less affected than control cell cultures. In addition, lovastatin lowered the transcription level of the ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase small subunit (AgpS) gene. Application of mevalonate or zeatin dramatically restored the decrease in starch deposition, and restored AgpS mRNA accumulation. Moreover, addition of other molecules with cytokinin activity, such as adenine- and phenylurea-type compounds, restored starch accumulation and AgpS transcript levels, whereas other isopentenyl pyrophosphate-derived phytohormones did not. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry quantification of endogenous cytokinins revealed that endogenous cytokinins increased when BY-2 cells were transferred into 2,4-D-deprived medium from conventional medium containing 2,4-D. In addition, lovastatin treatment decreased endogenous cytokinins to some extent when cultured under 2,4-D-deprived conditions. Our results suggest that both 2,4-D deprivation and an increase in endogenous cytokinins have important roles in accelerating the changes in plastid morphology, starch accumulation, and AgpS gene expression.", 
    "129": "Endothelium dysfunction, which is often defined as a decrease in NO bioavailability, is one of the earliest manifestations of endothelium-impaired function disorders, including atherosclerosis. Although improvement in NO bioavailability has been attributed to the lowering of serum cholesterol levels, recent studies suggest that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, statins, may have direct effects on NO bioavailability by little known mechanisms that are independent of serum cholesterol levels. The long-term effect of cerivastatin on NO release from endothelial cells was determined by using highly sensitive electrochemical microsensors and was correlated with endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) levels. To explore whether changes in isoprenoid synthesis affect NO bioavailability and eNOS expression, human endothelial cells were treated with cerivastatin, L-mevalonate (MVA; 1.5 mmol/L), geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP; 1 mg/mL) and farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP; 1 mg/mL). Cerivastatin increased spontaneous (by 53% +/- 6) and an eNOS-stimulated NO release (by 41 +/- 6% for calcium ionophore and by 47 +/- 5% acetylcholine) as well as eNOS expression (by 118 +/- 6%) in the same concentration-range. Cerivastatin-dependent increase in both NO release and eNOS expression was revealed after approximately 4 h of exposure reaching the maximum after approximately 10 h. Co-treatment with MVA or GGPP, but not FPP or LDL, reversed the effects of cerivastatin. These findings indicate that the long-term effect of cerivastatin resulting in enhanced NO bioavailabilty in endothelial cell is, at least in part, due to up-regulation of eNOS by blocking isoprenoids synthesis.",

Patients with concurrent prescriptions were surveyed for current use, awareness of withdrawal/warnings, adverse effects and creatine phosphokinase (CK) results.", 
    "132": "From August 2000 to August 2001, 29,377 prescriptions for cerivastatin were dispensed for 10,780 unique patients; 211 (2%) also received gemfibrozil. Prescription time frames for the two drugs overlapped for 67 patients. Interview of 47 patients revealed 35 actually taking both. 18/35 (51.4%) were still taking both drugs 2 weeks after market-withdrawal of cerivastatin. Only 7/46 (21.2%) had 'heard the news' about withdrawal. 19/46 (41.3%) described muscle-related symptoms; nine reported severe symptoms. Only 13 (28.3%) had CK monitoring. 5/8 symptomatic patients monitored had CK values > 200 U/L. (> 1000 U/L in two cases.)", 
    "133": "Despite escalating labeled warnings, nearly 2% of patients prescribed cerivastatin received gemfibrozil prescriptions, 1/3 concurrently. Most were still taking this combination 2 weeks after cerivastatin withdrawal and unaware of publicized warnings. Nearly half experienced muscle-related symptoms. More reliable methods for preventing prescription/dispensing of interacting medications and alerting patients about drug recalls are warranted.",

In a murine cerebral ischemia model produced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, statins were shown to reduce infarct size. However, the effect of statins on hypertension-based stroke is unknown. The purpose of this study is to clarify the effect of a statin on stroke in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-SP), in which both cerebral hemorrhage and infarction occur.", 
    "135": "We treated SHR-SP chronically from 4 weeks of age with cerivastatin (2 mg/kg per day by gavage) or vehicle. The physiological parameters, the incidence of stroke-associated symptoms, and mortality were assessed.",

Moreover, stroke-associated symptoms and early mortality of SHR-SP were markedly reduced in the statin-treated group (mortality at the age of 15 weeks: 15% versus 50%; P<0.05). Statin treatment significantly reduced superoxide production from nonstroke parenchyma of brain and infiltration of inflammatory cells to the stroke lesions.",

    "139": "We determined the frequency of total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol measurements and the use of statins in a multicenter prospective cohort study of 1743 patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, we determined the influence of several clinical variables on lipid measurements and the prescription of statins at hospital discharge.", 
    "140": "TC was measured in 90% and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was measured in 48% of the patients. Differences between the centers accounted for most of the observed variability in a multivariate model. Statin prescription also varied widely between the centers. The prescription of a statin at discharge was most strongly associated with statin intake before the event and with increasing TC levels; elderly patients received statins less often. Coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, and other manifestations of atherosclerosis were not independently associated with the use of statins; 68% of the patients with manifest atherosclerosis and TC levels >200 mg/dL were discharged without a statin.", 
    "141": "The determination of serum lipid profiles varies widely between different centers. Statins are highly underused in patients with recent ischemic stroke or TIA, particularly in those in whom statins are indicated according to existing recommendations (eg, patients with additional coronary artery disease and hypercholesterolemia). Currently, international guidelines concerning the use of statins are not adequately implemented in clinical practice in patients with stroke or TIA.", 
    "142": "Statins, which are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, decrease the hepatic biosynthesis of cholesterol by blocking the mevalonate pathway. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate drugs also inhibit the mevalonate pathway, preventing the production of the isoprenoids, which consequently results in the inhibition of osteoclast formation and osteoclast function. Therefore, we hypothesized that statins could affect bone metabolism in vivo through effects on osteoclastic bone resorption. In vitro, cerivastatin inhibited the parathyroid hormone (PTH)-stimulated bone resorption. Using a panel of 40 statin analogs, which showed variable effects on HMG-CoA reductase activity, we found that the ability of compounds to inhibit bone resorption is directly related to HMG-CoA reductase activity. However, in the thyro-parathyrodectomy (TPTX) model for bone resorption in the rat in vivo, cerivastatin did not prevent experimentally induced increases in bone resorption. The lack of effect of cerivastatin in this model is not related to a limited penetration of the target tissue (bone marrow), because a significant effect on HMG-CoA reductase activity was demonstrated in the total rat bone marrow cell extracts of rats posttreatment in vivo. Furthermore, cerivastatin inhibited protein prenylation in osteoclasts isolated from the rabbit bone marrow of rabbits after treatment in vivo. In contrast to other studies, none of the statins tested showed anabolic effects in parietal bone explant cultures. Taken together, we conclude that statins inhibit bone resorption in vitro, which correlates directly with the potency of the compounds for inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity. However, cerivastatin does not affect bone resorption in the rat TPTX model in vivo.", 
    "143": "We evaluated the economic efficiency as well as the clinical effectiveness on serum lipid levels of a change in drug therapy from bezafibrate or a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor to fenofibrate. Subjects were 26 outpatients suffering from type IIb or type IV hyperlipidemia who visited our hospital between October 2000 and January 2001. Medication doses, and serum lipid levels were recorded prior to the change to fenofibrate and at 6 months after the change. Medical costs were also calculated at the same time points. A significant reduction in medical costs of 14.9% was observed following the change to fenofibrate. Serum lipid levels were not significantly different, although an increase in low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol) was observed in patients changing from the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. The actual drug costs were reduced by 21.8% in the bezafibrate to fenofibrate group and by 23.7% in the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor to fenofibrate group. Although the drug costs of changing to fenofibrate decreased significantly, other costs remained almost unchanged.", 
    "144": "Epidemiological and clinical studies have suggested that powerful cholesterol lowering may have adverse effects on mood and psychological well-being. Inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis by simvastatin (a hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor) may also reduce steroid hormone biosynthesis. To explore if mood changes are related with steroid hormone levels, we designed a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial. The separate and combined effects of a Mediterranean-type diet intervention and treatment with simvastatin 20 mg/day PO for 12 weeks were studied in 120 hypercholesterolemic but otherwise healthy middle-aged men. Psychological functioning was assessed with questionnaires, and steroid hormone levels in blood were assayed radioimmunologically before and after the treatments. Simvastatin resulted in a statistically significant increase of depression and somatization without changes in the anxiety, hostility or aggression scores. Mood changes seemed to be unrelated with the statistically significant but clinically insignificant decline in serum testosterone levels and unrelated with the increase in serum dehydroepiandrosterone levels.",

Elderly hypertensive patients were less likely than the youngest patients to be under GP active review, more likely to be on a thiazide, calcium channel blocker or antiplatelet treatment, and less likely to be on a statin. More deprived hypertensive patients were less likely to be under GP review, or to be on a thiazide or a statin, but were more likely to be on a calcium channel blocker or an antiplatelet drug than the most affluent group.",

BMP-2 expression of bone marrow stromal cells was analyzed by using immunocytochemistry and Western blotting.", 
    "152": "After treated with simvastatin for 72 hours, BMP-2 expression increased, while little BMP-2 expression could be observed in the control group. ALP activity also increased in a dose-dependent manner; t-test showed that ALP activity in the group which concentrations of simvastatin were 0.5 mumol/L (t = 2.35, P = 0.041), 1.0 mumol/L (t = 2.348, P = 0.041) had significant difference when compared with control group.",

    "154": "Although not very common, medication-induced neuropathy is a treatable condition and, therefore, is important to identify. Medications continue to grow in number and expand in usage; consequently, toxic neuropathy continues to be relevant to neurologists. Many agents have toxicities that are tolerated because the treatments are necessary, such as therapies for HIV and malignancy. Additional agents to prevent or ameliorate the toxic neuropathy are being sought and trials are ongoing. Certain patients, however, may be at high risk for peripheral nerve toxicity due to genetic factors or another underlying neuropathy. Newer drug-delivery methods, such as viral transfection, may produce less toxicity in the future. The underlying pathomechanisms remain incompletely elucidated; however, apoptosis is emerging as an important final pathway in some forms of toxic neuropathy. Although most cases demonstrate acute or subacute onset after exposure, recent experiences with statin drugs raise the possibility of occult toxic causes of chronic idiopathic neuropathy.", 
    "155": "Statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are an important component of our armamentarium for stroke prevention. Both of these classes of agents have a primary mechanism of action of reducing the level of the respective risk factor. They also have mechanisms of action that may confer benefits beyond what is believed to be the primary action of the agent. This has led to speculation that statins reduce stroke risk by means beyond cholesterol lowering, and ACE inhibitors reduce stroke risk by means beyond blood pressure lowering. We review the mounting evidence that suggests that statins and ACE inhibitors have so-called pleiotropic effects that may lead to stroke prevention.",

It presents with a severe mixed hyperlipidaemia in which the ratio of total cholesterol to triglycerides is typically 2:1. There is a high incidence of atherosclerotic complications and severe hypertriglyceridaemia may cause pancreatitis. Highly effective therapy is available and affected families also benefit from genetic counselling.

    "162": "The mevalonate pathway produces many critical substances in cells, including sterols essential for membrane structure and isoprenoids vital to the function of many membrane proteins. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase is a rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. Because cholesterol is a product of this pathway, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are used to treat hypercholesterolemia. Statins are also toxic to several malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Although this toxicity has been attributed to the inhibition of Ras/Rho isoprenylation, we have previously shown that statin toxicity in primary AML cells (AMLs) does not correlate with Ras isoprenylation or with activating Ras mutations. In other studies, we have shown that hypoxic and oxidant injuries induce cholesterol increments in renal tubule cells and that statins sensitize these cells to injury by blocking protective cholesterol responses. We now demonstrate that exposing particular AMLs to radiochemotherapy induces much greater cellular cholesterol increments than those seen in similarly treated normal bone marrow. Treatment of these AMLs with mevastatin or zaragozic acid (which inhibits cholesterol synthesis but not isoprenoid synthesis) attenuates the cholesterol increments and sensitizes cells to radiochemotherapy. The extent of toxicity is affected by the availability of extracellular lipoproteins, further suggesting that cellular cholesterol is critical to cell survival in particular AMLs. Because zaragozic acid does not inhibit isoprenoid synthesis, these data suggest that cholesterol modulation is an important mechanism whereby statins exert toxic effects on some AMLs and that cholesterol modulators may improve therapeutic ratios in AML by impacting cholesterol-dependent cytoresistance.", 
    "163": "This study was designed to evaluate the effects of lipid-lowering therapy by atorvastatin versus simvastatin on calcified plaque progression, as determined by serial electron beam tomography (EBT), in primary prevention patients. In this observational study, serial EBT was performed before and after 1.2 years of atorvastatin (n = 103) and simavastatin therapy (n = 46); approximately 50% of each group was on niacin as well, in similar doses. There were no differences in demographic parameters between the groups. Total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were significantly higher in the atorvastatin group before treatment. Before treatment, EBT calcium score and volume scores were 469 and 378, respectively, in the atorvastatin patients, and 388 and 307, respectively, in the simvastatin patients (p = NS, atorvastatin vs simvastatin). After treatment, there were no differences in any lipid or EBT values between the groups. Post-treatment total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were 156 and 79 mg/dl, respectively, in the atorvastatin cohort and 154 and 76 mg/dl, respectively, in the simvastatin group (p = NS). Calcium score and volume progressed 10.8%/year and 8.5%/year, respectively, in the atorvastatin group, and 7.5%/year and 7.8%/year in the simvastatin group (p = NS, atorvastatin vs simvastatin). We conclude that aggressive treatment with atorvastatin and simvastatin in the primary prevention population, to similar lipid levels, is associated with equal progression of EBT-determined calcified plaque. This suggests that these hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors exhibit a \"class effect\" with respect to progression of subclinical atherosclerosis.",

The percentage decrease in plasma LDL cholesterol versus dose was log-linear for each drug, ranging from -46.6% to -61.9% for rosuvastatin 10 and 80 mg, compared with -38.2% to -53.5% for atorvastatin 10 and 80 mg. The dose curve for rosuvastatin yielded an 8.4% greater decrease in LDL cholesterol compared with atorvastatin at any given dose (p <0.001). Similarly greater decreases were observed for rosuvastatin across the dose range in total cholesterol (-4.9%), non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol (-7.0%), apolipoprotein B (-6.3%), and related ratios versus atorvastatin (all p <0.001). Because dose responses for HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein A-I were non-log-linear and nonparallel between the 2 drugs, percentage changes from baseline were compared at each dose. Significantly greater increases for rosuvastatin compared with atorvastatin were observed for HDL cholesterol at 40 and 80 mg, and for apolipoprotein A-I at 80 mg. Significantly greater triglyceride decreases were seen at 80 mg with atorvastatin over rosuvastatin. Both rosuvastatin and atorvastatin were well tolerated over 6 weeks.", 
    "165": "Little information exists to quantify the functional status and economic consequences of lipid-lowering therapy in elderly patients. We describe the design of the cost-effectiveness component of the first large, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of lipid-lowering therapy in subjects aged 70 years or older. The PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk has randomized 5804 men and women 70-82 years old, with existing vascular disease or related risk factors, to receive 40 mg/d of pravastatin or placebo. The cost-effectiveness study will be based on within-trial observations of differences between the two study arms in rates of myocardial infarction, stroke and related vascular disease outcomes (including vascular dementia). In addition to comparing within-trial clinical outcomes, we will model the projected changes in life expectancy and cardiovascular outcome rates that would be seen with lifelong use of the drug, based on the risk reduction rates seen in the trial as well as baseline observational data from the three countries where the trial is being conducted (Scotland, Ireland and the Netherlands). A state transition (Markov) model will be constructed to estimate the likely states of health, functional status and health care resource utilization (including lipid-lowering drug costs) in a cohort of elderly patients with versus without pravastatin therapy over a series of 1-year cycles until death. In addition, a standard measure of utility (the Health Utilities Index) will be administered to all study subjects to permit calculation of quality-adjusted life-years gained with this regimen. This approach will make it possible to go beyond the calculation of a single endpoint for each subject, and to translate the trial findings into definitions of effectiveness and outcomes that will be relevant to the ongoing debate concerning how best to relate the benefits of such medications to their costs."
