Despite the effectiveness of statins for CHD risk reduction, even optimal LDL-lowering therapy alone fails to avert 60% to 70% of CHD cases. A low plasma concentration of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is also associated with increased risk of CHD. However, the convincing epidemiologic data linking HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) to CHD risk in an inverse correlation has not yet translated into clinical trial evidence supporting linearity between HDL-C increases and CHD risk reduction. It is becoming clear that a functional HDL is a more desirable target than simply increasing HDL-C levels. Discoveries in the past decade have shed light on the complex metabolic and antiatherosclerotic pathways of HDL. These insights, in turn, have fueled the development of new HDL-targeted drugs, which can be classified according to four different therapeutic approaches: directly augmenting the concentration of apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I), the major protein constituent of HDL; indirectly augmenting the concentration of apo A-I and HDL cholesterol; mimicking the functionality of apo A-I and enhancing reverse cholesterol transport. This review discusses the latest in novel HDL directed therapeutic strategies.", 
    "1": "Although cholesterol-rich microdomains are highly involved in the functions of cardiomyocytes, the cholesterol homeostasis is largely unknown in these cells. We developed experimental procedures to assess cholesterol synthesis, cholesterol masses and cholesterol efflux from primary cultures of cardiac myocytes obtained from 2 to 4 days old Wistar rats. We first observed that cardiomyocytes poorly internalized exogenously supplied native or modified LDL and that free cholesterol (FC) efflux to free apolipoprotein AI (apo AI) and to HDL was mediated by ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and likely by ATP binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1), respectively, which are both upregulated by liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR) activation. We then investigated the consequences of cholesterol synthesis inhibition on cholesterol homeostasis using an HMGCoA reductase inhibitor (pravastatin, 90% effective concentration (EC90): 0.11 mM, 18 h). We observed no impact of cholesterol synthesis inhibition on the FC or cholesteryl ester (CE) masses. Consistently with no FC mass changes, pravastatin treatment had no notable impact on LDL receptors mRNA expression or on the capacity of cardiomyocytes to uptake radiolabeled LDL. Conversely, pravastatin treatment induced a significant decrease of cholesterol efflux to both apo AI and HDL whereas the passive aqueous diffusion remained unchanged. The cholesterol efflux pathway reductions induced by cholesterol synthesis inhibition were not caused by a reduction of ABC transporter expression (mRNA or protein). These results show that cardiac myocytes down-regulate active cholesterol efflux processes when endogenous cholesterol synthesis is inhibited, allowing them to preserve cholesterol homeostasis.",

The present study determined the effect of an intronic SNP rs4149081 in SLCO1B1 on the lipid-lowering effects of simvastatin and rosuvastatin in Chinese patients with hypercholesterolaemia. Lipid profiles were determined off treatment and after at least 4 weeks of treatment with each of the statins at daily doses of rosuvastatin 10 mg and simvastatin 40 mg. In 247 patients with good adherence, the rs4149081 G>A polymorphism was significantly associated with a 4.6 and 4.0% greater low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction compared with those with wild-type alleles in response to rosuvastatin and simvastatin, respectively (P<0.05 for both). The 388A>G and 521T>C polymorphisms were not associated with the LDL-C response to either statin. The intronic SNP rs4149081 in SLCO1B1 was associated with the LDL-C response to statins in Chinese patients and this association was independent of the 521T>C polymorphism.",

In this study, the effects of simvastatin on selected parameters of apoptosis and proliferation in chemocarcinogen-induced mammary tumorigenesis in female rats were determined. Simvastatin was administered dietary at a dose of 18 mg/kg and highly effective dose of 180 mg/kg the entire experiment (18 weeks). At autopsy mammary tumors were removed and prepared for immunohistochemical and histomorphological analysis. In treated animals (simvastatin 180 mg/kg), significant decrease by 12% in Bcl-2 protein expression and non-significant decrease by 27% of Ki67 protein expression in tumor cells compared to tumor cells in control animals were observed after semiquantitative evaluation. Morphometrical analysis has shown significant proapototic shift in Bcl-2/Bax ratio in tumor cells. In high grade control carcinoma cells, the expression of Ki67 increased by 37% (non-significantly) in comparison with control low grade carcinomas. A histomorphological analysis of malignant tumors has revealed a shift from high grade to low grade carcinomas after simvastatin treatment. The noticeable decrease of mammary tumor frequency and incidence in rats after simvastatin treatment was accompanied with antiapoptotic Blc-2 protein decrease and proapoptotic Bax protein increase in this experiment.", 
    "4": "Trypanosoma cruzi infection induces progressive cardiac inflammation that leads to fibrosis and modifications in the heart architecture and functionality. Statins, such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors, have been studied due to their pleiotropic roles in modulating the inflammatory response. Our goal was to evaluate the effects of simvastatin on the cardiac inflammatory process using a cardiotropic strain of T. cruzi in a murine model of Chagas cardiomyopathy. C57BL/6 mice were infected with 500 trypomastigotes of the Colombian strain of T. cruzi and treated with an oral dose of simvastatin (20 mg/Kg/day) for one month and inflammatory and morphometric parameters were subsequently evaluated in the serum and in the heart, respectively. Simvastatin reduced the total cholesterol and inflammatory mediators (interferon-gamma, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, CCL2 and CCL5) in the serum and in the heart tissue at 30 days post-infection. Additionally, a proportional reduction in heart weight and inflammatory infiltration was observed. Simvastatin also reduced epimastigote proliferation in a dose-dependent manner in vitro and was able to reduce blood trypomastigotes and heart amastigote nests during the acute phase of Chagas disease in vivo. Based on these data, we conclude that simvastatin exerts a modulatory effect on the inflammatory mediators that are elicited by the Colombian strain of T. cruzi and ameliorates the heart damage that is observed in a murine model of Chagas disease.", 
    "5": "Statin therapy reduces the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), however, the person-to-person variability in response to statin therapy is not well understood. We have investigated the effect of genetic variation on the reduction of CHD events by pravastatin. First, we conducted a genome-wide association study of 682 CHD cases from the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events (CARE) trial and 383 CHD cases from the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS), two randomized, placebo-controlled studies of pravastatin. In a combined case-only analysis, 79 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with differential CHD event reduction by pravastatin according to genotype (P<0.0001), and these SNPs were analyzed in a second stage that included cases as well as non-cases from CARE and WOSCOPS and patients from the PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk/PHArmacogenomic study of Statins in the Elderly at risk for cardiovascular disease (PROSPER/PHASE), a randomized placebo controlled study of pravastatin in the elderly. We found that one of these SNPs (rs13279522) was associated with differential CHD event reduction by pravastatin therapy in all 3 studies: P = 0.002 in CARE, P = 0.01 in WOSCOPS, P = 0.002 in PROSPER/PHASE. In a combined analysis of CARE, WOSCOPS, and PROSPER/PHASE, the hazard ratio for CHD when comparing pravastatin with placebo decreased by a factor of 0.63 (95% CI: 0.52 to 0.75) for each extra copy of the minor allele (P = 4.8 \u00d7 10(-7)). This SNP is located in DnaJ homolog subfamily C member 5B (DNAJC5B) and merits investigation in additional randomized studies of pravastatin and other statins.",

Although generally well-tolerated side effects from this class of drug have been noted to include liver dysfunction, renal failure and myopathy. Statins are also known to effect nitric oxide levels through upregulation of nitric oxide synthase. There is some evidence to imply that nitric oxide acts on inhibitory nerves in the colon to produce impaired motility. The authors present a case of recurrent colonic dilatation and volvulus which was initially treated with a sigmoid colectomy. Unfortunately symptoms persisted and a trial of the omission of statins was undertaken resulting in symptomatic relief. Following admission into hospital, statins were inadvertently restarted which caused the symptoms to reoccur. The statin was discontinued and upon review several months later the patient reported symptomatic benefit.", 
    "7": "Interindividual variability in activity of uptake transporters is evident in vivo, yet limited data exist in vitro, confounding in vitro-in vivo extrapolation. The uptake kinetics of seven organic anion-transporting polypeptide substrates was investigated over a concentration range in plated cryopreserved human hepatocytes. Active uptake clearance (CL(active, u)), bidirectional passive diffusion (P(diff)), intracellular binding, and metabolism were estimated for bosentan, pitavastatin, pravastatin, repaglinide, rosuvastatin, telmisartan, and valsartan in HU4122 donor using a mechanistic two-compartment model in Matlab. Full uptake kinetics of rosuvastatin and repaglinide were also characterized in two additional donors, whereas for the remaining drugs CL(active, u) was estimated at a single concentration. The unbound affinity constant (K(m, u)) and P(diff) values were consistent across donors, whereas V(max) was on average up to 2.8-fold greater in donor HU4122. Consistency in K(m, u) values allowed extrapolation of single concentration uptake activity data and assessment of interindividual variability in CL(active) across donors. The maximal contribution of active transport to total uptake differed among donors, for example, 85 to 96% and 68 to 87% for rosuvastatin and repaglinide, respectively; however, in all cases the active process was the major contributor. In vitro-in vivo extrapolation indicated a general underprediction of hepatic intrinsic clearance, an average empirical scaling factor of 17.1 was estimated on the basis of seven drugs investigated in three hepatocyte donors, and donor-specific differences in empirical factors are discussed. Uptake K(m, u) and CL(active, u) were on average 4.3- and 7.1-fold lower in human hepatocytes compared with our previously published rat data. A strategy for the use of rat uptake data to facilitate the experimental design in human hepatocytes is discussed.",

    "16": "The cholesterol biosynthesis pathway has recently been shown to play an important role in the innate immune response to viral infection with host protection occurring through a coordinate down regulation of the enzymes catalysing each metabolic step. In contrast, statin based drugs, which form the principle pharmaceutical agents for decreasing the activity of this pathway, target a single enzyme. Here, we build an ordinary differential equation model of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in order to investigate how the two regulatory strategies impact upon the behaviour of the pathway. We employ a modest set of assumptions: that the pathway operates away from saturation, that each metabolite is involved in multiple cellular interactions and that mRNA levels reflect enzyme concentrations. Using data taken from primary bone marrow derived macrophage cells infected with murine cytomegalovirus or treated with IFN\u03b3, we show that, under these assumptions, coordinate down-regulation of enzyme activity imparts a graduated reduction in flux along the pathway. In contrast, modelling a statin-like treatment that achieves the same degree of down-regulation in cholesterol production, we show that this delivers a step change in flux along the pathway. The graduated reduction mediated by physiological coordinate regulation of multiple enzymes supports a mechanism that allows a greater level of specificity, altering cholesterol levels with less impact upon interactions branching from the pathway, than pharmacological step reductions. We argue that coordinate regulation is likely to show a long-term evolutionary advantage over single enzyme regulation. Finally, the results from our models have implications for future pharmaceutical therapies intended to target cholesterol production with greater specificity and fewer off target effects, suggesting that this can be achieved by mimicking the coordinated down-regulation observed in immunological responses.",

We first performed a study in seven statin-na\u00efve HF patients (56 \u00b1 2 yr; ejection fraction: 31 \u00b1 4%) to determine if 1 mo of simvastatin (40 mg/day) reduces muscle SNA (MSNA).

By this pilot study we aimed to evaluate the effect of hypolipidemic drugs on the levels of low molecular weight (LMW) thiols bound to LDL in nephropatic patients. We enrolled thirty CKD randomized to receive three different hypolipidemic regimens: simvastatin alone (40 mg/day) or ezetimibe/simvastatin combined therapy (10/20 or 10/40 mg/day). LMW thiols in their reduced and total form, oxidative stress indices as malondialdehyde and allantoin/uric acid ratio were evaluated. LDL thiolation decreased in all treated patients, but a greater efficacy was attained from a combined therapy with a higher simvastatin dose, by which a 31% decrease of all S-bound thiols was reached after 1 year of therapy. In particular, in this patients group the reduction of apoB-Hcy was greater than 40%. The concomitant decrease of the oxidative stress indices during the therapy brings to the hypothesis that decreased levels of protein bound thiols may be a consequence of oxidative stress improvement. Therefore lipid lowering therapy may have beneficial effects also through the reduction of LDL-S-homocysteinylation that has been reported to have antiangiogenic and proatherogenic effect on endothelial vascular cells.",

The impacts of statins on integrity of AJs and VE-cad Tyr phosphorylation have not been explored. The effects of atorvastatin on IL-1\u03b2 and monocyte-induced VE-cad Tyr phosphorylation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECs) were studied. In ECs treated with interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 for 30 min, VE-cad Tyr phosphorylation, dissociation of the VE-cad/\u03b2-catenin complex and transendothelial migration (TEM) of monocytes were increased. These processes were mediated by activation of HRas and RhoA that leads to phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC). Atorvastatin inhibited IL-1\u03b2-induced Tyr phosphorylation of VE-cad by inhibiting RhoA and by dephosphorylating MLC. The attenuating effect of atorvastatin on VE-cad Tyr phosphorylation was reversed when RhoA was activated or MLC phosphatase was inhibited. Furthermore, inhibiting farnesyl transferase or geranylgeranyl transferase reproduced the inhibitory effects of atorvastatin on VE-cad Tyr phosphorylation. In addition, atorvastatin inhibited monocyte-induced VE-cad Tyr phosphorylation in ECs and attenuated IL-1\u03b2-induced TEM of monocytes. Our study introduces a novel pleiotropic effect of atorvastatin and suggests that statins protect the integrity of AJs in ECs by inhibiting RhoA-mediated Tyr phosphorylation of VE-cad.",

Blood circulating EPCs were identified by flow cytometry. Rats were sacrificed 25 days after TBI. vWF and CD31 immunostaining was performed. We found that atorvastatin administration significantly induced angiogenesis and increased circulating EPC levels as well as improved functional recovery when compared with non-treatment TBI-control rats (P<0.05). The circulating EPC level is correlated with vascular density (r=0.878, P <0.05) and CD31 positive cell number in the injured brain (r=0.921, P <0.05).

In recent years, however, concern has been raised regarding an increased incidence of new-onset diabetes mellitus observed in clinical trials of statin therapy. While most randomized, placebo controlled, statin trials have not included the incidence of new-onset diabetes as a major primary end point, a very small but consistent adverse effect on glycosylated hemoglobin and blood glucose levels, which is presently of unknown clinical significance, has been observed. Importantly, it should be remembered that some patient subgroups exposed to statin therapy, such as those with the metabolic syndrome, may already be particularly vulnerable to developing diabetes mellitus. Experimentally, although the weight of evidence suggests a protective effect of statins on the development of diabetes mellitus, basic science studies have documented conflicting evidence regarding both the beneficial and adverse effects from statin therapy on insulin secretion and sensitivity. In addition, the possibility that statin-induced muscle inflammation may elevate blood glucose levels cannot be excluded. Thus, although the biological plausibility of statins inducing diabetes certainly may exist, at the present time, sufficient high-quality scientific evidence does not exist to definitively establish the veracity or the strength of any putative cause and effect relationship.

Modifiable factors associated with BBB function may have therapeutic implication. This study tested the hypothesis that dyslipidemia is associated with BBB impairment in mild-to-moderate AD. Methods. Thirty-six subjects with AD were followed for 1 year. Fasting CSF and plasma were collected with clinical assessments at baseline and 12 months. BBB impairment was defined as CSF albumin index \u22659. Independent t-tests and linear regression assessed the relationship between plasma lipoproteins and BBB integrity. Results. Dyslipidemia was prevalent in 47% of the population, and in 75% of those with BBB impairment. Subjects with BBB impairment had significantly higher mean plasma triglyceride and lower HDL cholesterol (TG, P = 0.007; HDL, P = 0.043). Plasma triglycerides explained 22% of the variance in BBB integrity and remained significant after controlling for age, gender, ApoE-4 genotype, blood pressure, and statin use. Conclusion. Dyslipidemia is more prevalent in AD subjects with BBB impairment. Plasma triglyceride and HDL cholesterol may have a role in maintaining BBB integrity in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "86": "Statins are cholesterol-lowering drugs widely used in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases; however, they are associated with various types of myopathies. Statins inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and thus decrease biosynthesis of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and may also reduce ubiquinones, essential coenzymes of a mitochondrial electron transport chain, which contain isoprenoid residues, synthesized through an HMG-CoA reductase-dependent pathway. Therefore, we hypothesized that statin treatment might influence physical performance through muscular mitochondrial dysfunction due to ubiquinone deficiency. The effect of two statins, atorvastatin and pravastatin, on ubiquinone content, mitochondrial function, and physical performance was examined by using statin-treated mice. Changes in energy metabolism in association with statin treatment were studied by using cultured myocytes. We found that atorvastatin-treated mice developed muscular mitochondrial dysfunction due to ubiquinone deficiency and a decrease in exercise endurance without affecting muscle mass and strength. Meanwhile, pravastatin at ten times higher dose of atorvastatin had no such effects. In cultured myocytes, atorvastatin-related decrease in mitochondrial activity led to a decrease in oxygen utilization and an increase in lactate production. Conversely, coenzyme Q(10) treatment in atorvastatin-treated mice reversed atorvastatin-related mitochondrial dysfunction and a decrease in oxygen utilization, and thus improved exercise endurance. Atorvastatin decreased exercise endurance in mice through mitochondrial dysfunction due to ubiquinone deficiency. Ubiquinone supplementation with coenzyme Q(10) could reverse atorvastatin-related mitochondrial dysfunction and decrease in exercise tolerance.",

Although GWAS results are highly provocative, direct analyses of the contribution of specific allelic variations in regulating LDL-C has been challenging due to the difficulty in accessing appropriate cells from affected patients. The primary cell type responsible for controlling cholesterol and lipid flux is the hepatocyte. Recently, we have shown that cells with hepatocyte characteristics can be generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). This finding raises the possibility of using patient-specific iPSC-derived hepatocytes to study the functional contribution of GWAS loci in regulating lipid metabolism. To test the validity of this approach, we produced iPSCs from JD a patient with mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene that result in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). We demonstrate that (1) hepatocytes can be efficiently generated from FH iPSCs; (2) in contrast to control cells, FH iPSC-derived hepatocytes are deficient in LDL-C uptake; (3) control but not FH iPSC-derived hepatocytes increase LDL uptake in response to lovastatin; and (4) FH iPSC-derived hepatocytes display a marked elevation in secretion of lipidated apolipoprotein B-100.",

In particular, small, dense LDL (sd-LDL) particles have been recently highlighted as an emerging cardiovascular risk factor. PD patients exhibit a more overtly abnormal lipid profile than HD patients, probably due to the metabolic interference of the peritoneal dialysis fluid. Statins are the main drugs for the treatment of dyslipidemia and they are able to decrease all LDL subclasses levels, but it remains unclear whether they can influence the proportion of sd-LDL. Only few studies regarding the effect of statins on the proportion of these particles have been performed in HD patients and, to our knowledge, no trials have been carried out in PD patients. Therefore, we compared the lipid profile and the proportion of sd-LDL in two populations of HD and PD patients. Our study suggests that statin therapy may be effective in reducing both the absolute amount and the proportion of sd-LDL in patients with a more overtly abnormal lipid profile, such as patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. Statins do not seem to be effective in altering sd-LDL levels in patients undergoing hemodialysis with other factors that can influence LDL subtractions generation, such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus.

The pathogenesis of the lipid disturbances in PD patients is not completely understood, but both the protein loss in the dialysate, and the glucose absorption from the dialysate may contribute to these alterations. Hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, more commonly known as statins, are effective to reduce low density cholesterol levels in PD patients and have few side effects. The use of statins is associated with reduced mortality in PD patients, but so far no large randomized controlled trial has been performed concerning the effects on clinical outcome in PD patients (except for the fact that 496 patients in the SHARP trial were treated with PD). In addition, except from their lipid lowering effects, statins also have pleiotropic effects, independent of their lipid lowering effect, that theoretically have beneficial effects on the peritoneal membrane remodeling. Use of alternative osmotic agents as well as nutritional interventions has also been reported to improve the lipid profilein PD patients.", 
    "96": "Treatment of cholesterol in people with advanced stage chronic kidney disease (CKD) clearly reduces cardiovascular risk; however, it does not significantly slow nephropathy progression. Moreover, cholesterol reduction does not reduce mortality in people on dialysis. In general, cholesterol reduction is very important for reducing cardiovascular risk in people with GFR values >15 ml/min who are not on dialysis. There are many reasons for the lack cardiovascular risk reduction with cholesterol lowering in dialysis patients including a defective HDL and higher than usual oxidation rates of LDL. The reviews some of the biochemistry of lipids in uremia and discusses the randomized trial data that support these statements and provides greater detail regarding use of statin in patients with stages 4 and 5 CKD. Caution should be used in dosing statins in stage 3b or higher CKD. Specifically, all statins except for atorvastatin and pravastatin need dose reductions due to safety issues. Given the more 'metabolic syndrome like' profile of lipids in stage 5 CKD adjunctive methods such as fibrates and omega-3 is discussed, however no good data are available in this group on outcomes with these agents.",

Many studies have demonstrated important benefits in patients with asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis. We have evaluated the effect of low dose of rosuvastatin on asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis in elderly versus adult subjects. Among 640 participants in the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease In Manfredonia Study (ACADIM Study) forty-five patients (21 adults, 24 elderly) with hypercholesterolemia and asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis on baseline carotid ultrasound investigation (CUI) were examined with repeat CUI after one treatment year with rosuvastatin (ROS) (10 mg/day). Total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased significantly (p<0.001) while high density lipoprotein cholesterol increased significantly (p<0.001) during the intervention. Mean decrease in carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) of the right and left common carotid arteries were higher in adult versus elderly subjects (p<0.04 for each), even if in both group there was a significant regression in carotid atherosclerosis respect to baseline values (P<0.001). These results confirm the reduction in IMT of the CCAs in response to ROS at a low dose in a one-year treatment period, even if in elderly subjects this effect is lower respect to adult. The treatment of asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis defined by CIMT started in the adult age is more effective.", 
    "98": "The purpose of this study was to develop a new therapeutic approach for atorvastatin (ATV) adopting nanostructured polymeric micelles for its controlled delivery to the cancer cells. Amphiphilic block copolymers of stearyl chitosan (SC) and sulfated stearyl chitosan (S-SC) that could self assemble to form polymeric micelles with different degree of substitution (DS) were synthesized and characterized. The synthesized chitosan derivatives were able to self assemble and form micelles encapsulating ATV with critical micellar concentrations ranging from 6.9 to 21\u03bcg/ml, drug-loading ranging from 40% to 84.1% and encapsulation efficiency ranging from 10.4% to 35%. ATV caused a significant decrease in particle size and zeta potential of both SC and S-SC micelles. Micelles encapsulating ATV exhibited a sustained release and more cytotoxic activity against MCF 7 and HCT 116 cell lines than ATV alone. The 50% cellular growth inhibition (IC50%) of the drug decreased from 10.4 to 3.7 in case of MCF 7 and from 9.4 to 3.4 in case of HCT 116 after its loading in micelles. These results indicate that SC ATV polymeric micelles can be considered as a promising system for site specific controlled delivery of ATV to tumor cells.",

This article reviews the current available information on the pharmacology, clinical efficacy and safety of Pravafenix. Pravafenix is recommended to be taken with food in the evening. In clinical trials, Pravafenix consistently produces complementary benefits on the overall atherogenic lipid profile of high-risk patients with mixed hyperlipidemia not controlled by either pravastatin 40 mg or simvastatin 20 mg. Within the limitations of the database, Pravafenix seems to be well tolerated up to 64 weeks, with an overall tolerability and safety profile consistent with findings generally observed with fenofibrate treatment. In particular, no myopathy or rhabdomyolysis has been reported. The actual European indication is restricted to high-risk patients with mixed hyperlipidemia whose LDL cholesterol levels are adequately controlled on pravastatin 40 mg monotherapy.

Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are rare with statin monotherapy at the approved dose ranges, but the risk increases with use of higher doses, interacting drugs and genetic predisposition. Asymptomatic increases in liver transaminases with statin treatment do not seem to be associated with an increased risk of liver disease. Therefore, statin treatment can be safely used in patients with mild to moderately abnormal liver tests that are potentially attributable to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and can improve liver tests and reduce cardiovascular morbidity in this group of patients.

Higher risk groups like patients with diabetes, a higher prevalence of CAC has been shown to impart a high short term risk of CV events, while those with zero calcium score had excellent event-free survival, similar to non-diabetic patients. Having a zero calcium score is currently used in United Kingdom practice guidelines (NICE) as a gatekeeper for any further investigations in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with chest pain. Unanswered questions include the concept of CAC progression that need to be standardized with respect to technique, interpretation and subsequent management strategies. Studies also demonstrated that risk assessment using CAC was motivational to patients leading to better adherence to their preventive practices as well as medications.

Lipid profiles, flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and Rho-kinase activity of circulating leukocytes (the extent of phosphorylation of myosin binding subunit, a Rho-kinase substrate) were examined. We also evaluated remnant-like particle cholesterol (RLP-C) known as an up-regulator of Rho-kinase and cholesterol absorption status by measuring cholestanol and campesterol/lathosterol ratio (CLR) (both absorption markers). Although ezetimibe and pravastatin equally reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (E: -25% vs. P: -21%), the CLR was reduced by ezetimibe but was rather increased by pravastatin (E: -41% vs. P: +37%; P<0.01). Reduction in RLP-C by ezetimibe was greater compared with pravastatin (E: -33% vs. P: -14%; P<0.05). Importantly, ezetimibe significantly improved FMD (26%, P<0.05) and reduced Rho-kinase activity (-21%, P<0.05), whereas pravastatin had no such effects.

Statins induced CYP4F3B mRNA, protein and the production of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), a product of arachidonic acid metabolism and a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) ligand. This response was not dependent on cholesterol shortage or on sterol regulatory element binding protein activation. By both a pharmacological and a siRNA approaches, we demonstrated that recruitment of the Pregnane X Receptor (PXR) was required to mediate CYP4F3 induction by lovastatin. Furthermore, the CYP4F3 gene promoter was transcriptionally activated by PXR, and responded to lovastatin. Finally, the expression of fatty acid-responsive genes was increased in response to the statin or 20-HETE in a CYP4F3-dependent way. We propose that metabolites produced by CYP4F3 could modulate lipid metabolism in response to lovastatin.

We showed that RNF149 bound directly to the C-terminal kinase-containing domain of wild-type BRAF and induced ubiquitination, followed by proteasome-dependent degradation, of the latter protein. Functionally, RNF149 attenuated the increase in cell growth induced by wild-type BRAF. However, RNF149 did not bind to mutant BRAF or induce ubiquitination thereof.

Plasma samples for PK assessments were collected on days 5, 19, and 24. Plasma concentrations of analytes were determined by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection methods.", 
    "204": "PK data were available for 23 of 24 subjects enrolled. For pitavastatin, area under the concentration time curve (AUC0-\u03c4) and maximum concentration (C(max)) were 136.8 \u00b1 52.9 ng\u00b7h(-1)\u00b7mL(-1) and 58.6 \u00b1 30.4 ng/mL, respectively, when given alone, versus 113.9 \u00b1 53.8 ng\u00b7h(-1)\u00b7mL(-1) and 58.2 \u00b1 32.7 ng/mL when combined with lopinavir/ritonavir. The geometric mean ratio for AUC(0-\u03c4) for pitavastatin with lopinavir/ritonavir versus pitavastatin alone was 80.0 (90% confidence interval: 73.4 to 87.3) and C(max) was 96.1 (90% confidence interval: 83.6 to 110.4). Median T(max) of pitavastatin was approximately 0.5 hours for both treatments. The PK effect of pitavastatin on lopinavir/ritonavir was minimal. No significant safety issues were reported.", 
    "205": "The effect on exposures when pitavastatin and lopinavir/ritonavir are coadministered was minimal. Concomitant use of pitavastatin and lopinavir/ritonavir was safe and well tolerated in healthy adult volunteers.", 
    "206": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is often associated with steatosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Statins (HMG-CoAR inhibitors) have been shown to exert an antiviral effect in vitro, principally on replicon harboring cells, but the effect of their use alone in vivo remains controversial. In clinical trials, when used in combination with the standards of care (SOC), they led to an increased proportion of sustained virological responder (SVR). Here we investigated the implication of SKI-1/S1P, a master lipogenic pathways regulator upstream of HMG-CoAR, on different steps of HCV life cycle. We compared the HCV antiviral effect of the most potent SKI-1/S1P small molecule inhibitor (PF-429242) with a set of two statins on different steps of the viral life cycle, and showed that SKI-1/S1P inhibitor blocked HCVcc (strain JFH-1) RNA replication (EC(50)= 5.8 \u03bcM) more efficiently than statins. Moreover, we showed that PF-429242 could reduce lipid droplets accumulation in Huh7 cells. Interestingly, PF-429242 dramatically reduced infectious particles production (EC(90)= 4.8 \u03bcM). Such inhibition could not be achieved with statins. SKI-1/S1P activity is thus essential for viral production and its inhibition should be considered for antiviral drug development.",

We present a case of a 60-year-old man with a history of stroke without changes in carotid and vertebral arteries. Echocardiography exam revealed patent foramen ovale (PFO) and abnormal echos in the aorta that were verified as advanced complex atheromas by computed tomography. Due to small size PFO was deemed insignificant and the source of embolism were most probably aortic atheromas. Patient was put on acenocumarol, aspirin and statin.",

A trial is under way to evaluate the effect of once-daily fenofibric acid or placebo on carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) progression in patients with controlled low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels achieved through atorvastatin treatment, but with high TG and low HDL-C levels.", 
    "209": "In this multicenter, double-blind study, 682 patients were randomized to once-daily delayed-release capsules of choline fenofibrate 135 mg (fenofibric acid [Trilipix(\u00ae); Abbott, North Chicago, IL]) or placebo plus atorvastatin treatment after a 2- to 10-week diet and atorvastatin run-in period. Key inclusion criteria included age \u226545 years; posterior-wall common CIMT \u22650.7 mm on at least one side at baseline; fasting results of TG \u2265150 mg/dL, and HDL-C \u226445 mg/dL for men or HDL-C \u226455 mg/dL for women at screening while receiving atorvastatin; controlled LDL-C; and known coronary heart disease (CHD) or a CHD risk equivalent. The primary efficacy variable is the rate of change from baseline through week 104 in the mean posterior-wall intima-media thickness of the common carotid arteries (composite value of left and right sides).", 
    "210": "This trial is the first to examine the effect of fenofibric acid on CIMT and the first CIMT trial to select patients with controlled LDL-C and elevated TG and low HDL-C as inclusion criteria. Also, this trial will prospectively evaluate the effect of treatment on LDL particles and address shortcomings of previous CIMT trials.", 
    "211": "Low levels of statin adherence may compromise treatment outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate whether nurse-led cardiovascular risk-factor counseling could improve statin adherence and lipid levels without increasing patients' anxiety. Patients with indications for statin therapy for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease were randomly assigned to receive routine care or extended care (EC) at baseline and at months 3, 9, and 18. Patients in the EC group received a personalized risk-factor passport, showing modifiable and unmodifiable individual risk factors and a graphical presentation of their calculated absolute 10-year cardiovascular disease risk as well as the target risk that could be reached if all modifiable risk factors were optimally treated. Lipid levels were assessed at each visit. Carotid intima-media thickness was measured at baseline and at month 18. Adherence, anxiety, quality of life, symptoms, and smoking status were assessed using a self-administered questionnaire at each visit. A total of 201 patients were included in the study. Statin adherence was significantly higher (p <0.01) and anxiety was significantly lower (p <0.01) in the EC group than in the routine care group. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was statistically significantly lower in the EC group than in the routine group (2.66 vs 3.00 mmol/L, respectively, p = 0.024) in primary prevention patients only. Intima-media thickness improved significantly from baseline (p <0.01) in all patients, irrespective of group assignment. In conclusion, cardiovascular risk-factor counseling resulted in improved lipid profiles in primary prevention patients and higher levels of adherence to statins and lower levels of anxiety in all patients.", 
    "212": "Reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is associated with reduced risk for major coronary events. Despite statin efficacy, a considerable proportion of statin-treated hypercholesterolemic patients fail to reach therapeutic LDL-C targets as defined by guidelines. This study compared the efficacy of ezetimibe added to ongoing statins with doubling the dose of ongoing statin in a population of Taiwanese patients with hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "213": "This was a randomized, open-label, parallel-group comparison study of ezetimibe 10 mg added to ongoing statin compared with doubling the dose of ongoing statin. Adult Taiwanese hypercholesterolemic patients not at optimal LDL-C levels with previous statin treatment were randomized (N = 83) to ongoing statin + ezetimibe (simvastatin, atorvastatin or pravastatin + ezetimibe at doses of 20/10, 10/10 or 20/10 mg) or doubling the dose of ongoing statin (simvastatin 40 mg, atorvastatin 20 mg or pravastatin 40 mg) for 8 weeks. Percent change in total cholesterol, LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides, and specified safety parameters were assessed at 4 and 8 weeks.", 
    "214": "At 8 weeks, patients treated with statin + ezetimibe experienced significantly greater reductions compared with doubling the statin dose in LDL-C (26.2% vs 17.9%, p = 0.0026) and total cholesterol (20.8% vs 12.2%, p = 0.0003). Percentage of patients achieving treatment goal was greater for statin + ezetimibe (58.6%) vs doubling statin (41.2%), but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.1675). The safety and tolerability profiles were similar between treatments.",

    "217": "High-dose hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme. A reductase inhibitor (statin) administration reduces neuronal injury and improves outcomes in experimental models of acute ischemic stroke, and has been shown to be safe in a phase 1 dose-escalation study using lovastatin at doses higher than currently approved for daily use. Statins also affect the hemostatic system by upregulating t-PA expression and decreasing plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) expression, platelet adhesion and thrombus formation in animal models. Since a thrombolytic agent, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), is currently the only FDA-approved therapy for use in ischemic stroke patients, it is important to ascertain whether high statin doses impact the efficacy of rt-PA. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of a high dose of lovastatin and its active form, lovastatin hydroxy acid, on rt-PA thrombolysis in an in vitro model. Percentage clot lysis was measured in the presence and absence of rt-PA in three different treatment groups: lovastatin, lovastatin hydroxy acid, and ethanol. The effect of ethanol on clot lysis was studied since ethanol was used to disperse the highly hydrophobic lovastatin. The decrease in clot width over time was measured using microscopic imaging of an in vitro human whole blood clot model; an approximately 400 \u03bcm diameter clot was formed on suture silk, suspended in human fresh frozen plasma (hFFP) and exposed to treatment. In the absence of rt-PA, clot lysis did not show statistically significant differences in the percentage clot lysis between different treatment groups (p=0.103). In the presence of rt-PA, clot lysis was greater than in the absence of rt-PA for all groups, but there were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups (p=0.385). In this in vitro study, high doses of lovastatin neither impaired nor enhanced the lytic efficacy of rt-PA.", 
    "218": "Metabolic syndrome (MS) is characterised by accumulation of CVD risk factors. The use of very long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLC n3 PUFA) could potentially benefit MS by reducing risk factors. To better understand the possible VLC n3 PUFA benefits, the literature was systematically reviewed for randomised controlled trials (RCT) that published effects of VLC n3 PUFA on MS patients. 17 RCT fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were analysed for relevance to the research question. The available RCT convincingly show that the administration of VLC n3 PUFA doses > 1 g for at least 3 months produces a significant reduction of triglycerides ranging from 7 % to 25 %. These results confirm the hypotriglyceridemic effect of VLC n3 PUFA in MS patients. The triglyceride lowering may produce further benefits by reducing the % of pro-atherogenic small dense LDL particles (sdLDL) and also perhaps by ameliorating the inflammatory process associated with MS. High doses of VLC n3 PUFA ( \u2265 3 g/day) may produce further TAG reductions but could raise other risk factors such as LDL-C. No clear effects were found on other MS markers. The combination of VLC n3 PUFA plus a statin may be useful to prevent the occurrence of coronary events. More studies are needed using different amounts of VLC n3 PUFA, time lengths, dietary backgrounds and different profiles of MS patients before clear recommendations can be made.", 
    "219": "Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a novel candidate immunoinflammatory marker that has been reported to be associated with cardiometabolic risk factors and to predict adverse outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between the plasma levels of PTX3 and plaque vulnerability and the effect of the levels using statin in patients with coronary artery disease.", 
    "220": "We determined the associations among the plasma levels of PTX3 and coronary plaque vulnerability in nonculprit coronary lesions with stenosis as assessed by integrated backscatter intravascular ultrasound (study 1). One hundred and eighteen consecutive patients with stable angina who underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention were enrolled. We also enrolled 53 patients with stable angina, and they were treated either with (n=36) or without (n=17) atorvastatin (10 mg/day) (study 2).", 
    "221": "In study 1, although there was no association between the plasma levels of PTX3 and plaque vulnerability in all patients, the level of PTX3 was positively correlated with the percentage of lipid volume and negatively correlated with the percentage of fibrous volume in patients without statin treatment. There were no associations between high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels and percentage of lipid volume and fibrous volume. Moreover, in study 2, statin therapy for 6-8 months significantly decreased the level of PTX3 in addition to high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.", 
    "222": "The plasma level of PTX3 may be a useful biomarker for predicting the tissue characteristics of coronary plaque using integrated backscatter intravascular ultrasound. Statin therapy may have a beneficial effect with regard to the reduction of PTX3 levels.", 
    "223": "Cholesterol reduction from statin therapy has been one of the greatest public health successes in modern medicine. Simvastatin is among the most commonly used prescription medications. A non-synonymous coding single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs4149056, in SLCO1B1 markedly increases systemic exposure to simvastatin and the risk of muscle toxicity. This guideline explores the relationship between rs4149056 (c.521T>C, p.V174A) and clinical outcome for all statins. The strength of the evidence is high for myopathy with simvastatin. We limit our recommendations accordingly."
