    "4": "Cytochrome P450 (P450)-dependent arachidonic acid metabolites may act as mediators in the regulation of vascular tone and renal function. We studied arachidonic acid hydroxylase activities in renal microsomes from normotensive NMRI mice, desoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive mice, and DOCA-salt mice treated with either lovastatin or bezafibrate, both of which improve hemodynamics in this model. Control renal microsomes had arachidonic acid hydroxylase activities of 175+/-12 pmol. min(-1). mg(-1). The metabolites formed were 20- and 19-hydroxyarachidonic acid, representing approximately 80% and approximately 20% of the total hydroxylation. Treatment with DOCA-salt resulted in significantly decreased hydroxylase activities (to 84+/-4 pmol. min(-1). mg(-1)) of the total microsomal P450 content and a decrease in immunodetectable Cyp4a proteins. Lovastatin had no effect on these variables, whereas bezafibrate increased arachidonic acid hydroxylase activities to 163+/-12 pmol. min(-1). mg(-1). In situ hybridization with probes for Cyp4a-10, 12, and 14 revealed that Cyp4a-14 was the P450 isoform most strongly induced by bezafibrate. The expression was concentrated in the cortical medullary junction and was localized predominantly in the proximal tubules. In conclusion, these results suggest that the capacity to produce 20-hydroxyarachidonic acid is impaired in the kidneys of DOCA-salt hypertensive mice. Furthermore, bezafibrate may ameliorate hemodynamics in this model by restoring P450-dependent arachidonic acid hydroxylase activities. Lovastatin, on the other hand, exerts its effects via P450-independent mechanisms.",

    "12": "In an in vitro study, we compared the cytochrome P450 (CYP)-dependent metabolism and drug interactions of the acid and lactone forms of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitor atorvastatin. Metabolism of atorvastatin acid and lactone by human liver microsomes resulted in para-hydroxy and ortho-hydroxy metabolites. Both substrates were metabolized mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. Atorvastatin lactone had a significantly higher affinity to CYP3A4 than the acid (K(m): para-hydroxy atorvastatin, 25.6 +/- 5.0 microM; para-hydroxy atorvastatin lactone, 1.4 +/- 0.2 microM; ortho-hydroxy atorvastatin, 29.7 +/- 9.4 microM; and ortho-hydroxy atorvastatin lactone, 3.9 +/- 0.2 microM). Compared with atorvastatin acid, CYP-dependent metabolism of atorvastatin lactone to its para-hydroxy metabolite was 83-fold higher [formation CL(int) (V(max)/K(m)): lactone 2949 +/- 3511 versus acid 35.5 +/- 48.1 microl. min(-1). mg(-1)] and to its ortho-hydroxy metabolite was 20-fold higher (CL(int): lactone 923 +/- 965 versus acid 45.8 +/- 59. 1 microl. min(-1). mg(-1)). Atorvastatin lactone inhibited the metabolism of atorvastatin acid by human liver microsomes with an inhibition constant (K(i)) of 0.9 microM while the K(i) for inhibition of atorvastatin by atorvastatin lactone was 90 microM. Binding free energy calculations of atorvastatin acid and atorvastatin lactone complexed with CYP3A4 revealed that the smaller desolvation energy of the neutral lactone compared with the anionic acid is the dominant contribution to the higher binding affinity of the lactone rather than an entropy advantage. Because atorvastatin lactone has a significantly higher metabolic clearance and the lactone is a strong inhibitor of atorvastatin acid metabolism, it can be expected that metabolism of the lactone is the relevant pathway for atorvastatin elimination and drug interactions. We hypothesize that most of the open acid metabolites present in human plasma are generated by interconversion of lactone metabolites.", 
    "13": "The advent of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) has revolutionised the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia. Statin treatment, by lowering the atherogenic lipoprotein profile, reduces morbidity and mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease. Treatment with simvastatin causes a reduction of events of new-onset heart failure, but this may be attributable to properties other than its lipid-lowering effects. There is some evidence that lower serum cholesterol concentrations (as a surrogate for the totality of lipoproteins) relate to impaired survival in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). Inflammation is a feature in patients with CHF and increased lipopolysaccharide may contribute substantially. We postulate that higher concentrations of total cholesterol are beneficial in these patients. This is potentially attributable to the property of lipoproteins to bind lipopolysaccharide, thereby preventing its detrimental effects. We hypothesise there is an optimum lipoprotein concentration below which lipid reduction would, on balance, be detrimental. We also propose that, in patients with CHF, a non-lipid-lowering statin (with ancillary properties such as immune modulatory and anti-inflammatory actions) could be as effective or even more beneficial than a lipid-lowering statin.",

Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2, C-reactive protein, and fibrinogen levels, and the white-cell count were measured at base line, along with other traditional risk factors. The association of these variables with the risk of coronary events was tested in regression models and by dividing the range of values according to quintiles.",

However, the association of these variables with risk was markedly attenuated when age, systolic blood pressure, and lipoprotein levels were included in multivariate models. Levels of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase), the expression of which is regulated by mediators of inflammation, had a strong, positive association with risk that was not confounded by other factors. It was associated with almost a doubling of the risk in the highest quintile as compared with the lowest quintile.",

We previously identified the first French FDB-R3531C proband, a woman with very high total cholesterol, in a group of type IIa hypercholesterolemic families. We report here the investigation of her family at large that revealed the total absence of cosegregation with hypercholesterolemia. Six of the 10 subjects heterozygous for the R3531C mutation had plasma cholesterol lower than the 97.5th percentile for their age and gender, and mean cholesterol levels were not significantly different between affected and unaffected persons. Furthermore, 2 family members with similar high LDL-cholesterol levels were not carriers of the R3531C substitution, suggesting the implication of another mutation. Segregation analysis of the LDLR gene revealed statistically significant genetic linkage with hypercholesterolemia, and analysis of the proband LDLR gene led to the identification of the 664 proline to leucine defective mutation and its detection in all 6 hypercholesterolemic-related members of this family. Therefore, our results show that the family presents with familial hypercholesterolemia and give evidence that the R3531C substitution in the APOB gene is not an allelic variant leading to FDB. Furthermore, thorough analysis of our data suggests that the APOB-R3531C mutation enhances the hypercholesterolemic effect of the LDLR-P664L defect, suggesting that it is a susceptibility mutation.",

Lovastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin are substrates of CYP3A4, whereas fluvastatin is metabolized by CYP2C9. Pravastatin is not extensively metabolized by either of these isoenzymes; rather, it is transported into hepatocytes by a sodium-independent, carrier-mediated uptake system that normally transports bile acids. Compared with other statins, pravastatin thus has a reduced potential for drug interactions with other substrates, inhibitors, or inducers of the CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 systems.",

The AT1 receptor plays a central role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and hypertension. In parallel, hypercholesterolaemia is a major risk factor for the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases. The underlying molecular events, however, are understood only partially. An important mechanism may be the interaction between hypercholesterolaemia and AT1 receptor expression in vascular tissue. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol leads to a profound increase in AT1 receptor expression in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells as well as in hypercholesterolaemic rabbits. This up-regulation is associated with an enhanced functional response upon stimulation with angiotensin II. Over-expression of the vascular AT1 receptor can also be observed in hypercholesterolaemic men and is prevented by treatment with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors. These findings may explain why hypercholesterolaemia is frequently associated with hypertension and why blockade of the RAS attenuates the progression of atherosclerosis.", 
    "45": "Recent clinical trials have provided unequivocal evidence of major cardiovascular benefits from low density lipoprotein (LDL) lowering with statins. However, the three critical unresolved questions about aggressive LDL lowering are the shape of the curve relating cardiac events to LDL, the best surrogate measurement for assessing therapeutic efficacy and the best target for LDL therapy. The relation between cardiac events and LDL is curvilinear, both epidemiologically and during therapy. The benefit of lipid lowering diminishes progressively and becomes difficult to detect at lower LDL levels without a very large sample size. Assessment of the benefits of lipid lowering is further confounded by differences in the level of pretreatment LDL and by the non-LDL lowering effects of statins. Both epidemiologic studies and large randomized clinical trials have produced conflicting results concerning the best LDL target. Failure to reduce the event rate in patients with pretreatment LDL <125 mg (Cholesterol And Recurrent Events [CARE] trial) alerts us to the risk of extrapolating epidemiologic data to clinical practice, yet subset analysis of some clinical trials suggests the greatest benefit appears in those patients with the lowest on-treatment LDL levels (Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study [4S]). This controversy should be resolved in the next few years by several important on-going trials. In the face of seemingly contradictory data from current clinical trials, we can only speculate that very aggressive LDL lowering to <80 mg/dl could be accompanied by a modest therapeutic benefit beyond the current recommendations of the National Cholesterol Education Program. If any benefit is observed, it will have to be balanced against a small potential for increased adverse events.",

    "52": "Thirty-one gallstone patients were enrolled in the study; 17 were treated with 20 mg simvastatin daily for 3 weeks prior to cholecystectomy and 14 served as controls. Samples of blood, liver, gall-bladder bile and bile from the common bile duct (CBD) were collected and analysed.", 
    "53": "The plasma cholesterol (-30%), triacylglycerol (-23%) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (-42%) concentrations were significantly lowered by simvastatin treatment, as was the plasma lathosterol: cholesterol (-70%), which reflects whole-body cholesterol synthesis. Despite these changes, the hepatic LDL receptor protein and LDL receptor activity in circulating mononuclear cells were similar in both groups. There were no differences in the plasma phytosterol: cholesterol, which reflects the intestinal cholesterol absorption capacity or in the activity of hepatic acyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase. There were however, lower cholesterol concentrations in CBD (-68%) and gall bladder (-41%) bile, and decreased lithogenic (-47%) and bile acid hydrophobicity (-22%) indices of CBD bile in the simvastatin group.", 
    "54": "These data indicate that simvastatin reduced plasma and biliary cholesterol levels primarily by reducing cholesterol synthesis. The reduction in CBD bile lithogenicity and bile acid hydrophobicity by simvastatin suggests that this agent may be useful for people who have early stages of cholesterol gallstone development and in whom a choleretic effect is required.", 
    "55": "Thrombosis superimposed on atherosclerosis causes approximately two thirds of all brain infarctions. We previously demonstrated that statins protect from cerebral ischemia by upregulation of endothelial type III nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), but the downstream mechanisms have not been determined. Therefore, we investigated whether antithrombotic effects contribute to stroke protection by statins.", 
    "56": "129/SV wild-type and eNOS knockout mice were treated with atorvastatin for 14 days (0.5, 1, and 10 mg/kg). eNOS mRNA from aortas and platelets was measured by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Platelet factor 4 (PF 4) and beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG) in the plasma were quantified by ELISA. Transient cerebral ischemia was induced by filamentous occlusion of the middle cerebral artery followed by reperfusion.", 
    "57": "Stroke volume after 1-hour middle cerebral artery occlusion/23-hour reperfusion was significantly reduced by 38% in atorvastatin-treated animals (10 mg/kg) compared with controls. Serum cholesterol levels were not affected by the treatment. eNOS mRNA was significantly upregulated in a dose-dependent manner in aortas and in thrombocytes of statin-treated mice compared with controls. Moreover, indices of platelet activation in vivo, ie, plasma levels of PF 4 and beta-TG, were dose-dependently downregulated in the treatment group. Surprisingly, atorvastatin-treatment did not influence PF 4 and beta-TG levels in eNOS knockout mice.", 
    "58": "The synthetic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor atorvastatin upregulates eNOS in thrombocytes, decreases platelet activation in vivo, and protects from cerebral ischemia in normocholesterolemic mice. Antithrombotic and stroke-protective effects of statins are mediated in part by eNOS upregulation. Our results suggest that statins may provide a novel prophylactic treatment strategy independent of serum cholesterol levels.", 
    "59": "Lipid-lowering with statins reduces disease progression, prevents myocardial infarction and other hard end points, and prolongs survival. Data from large-scale trials with these agents further show that lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in patients with coronary artery disease reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events and that the lower the LDL cholesterol achieved, the lower the event rate. Currently available evidence supports the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) recommendations for reduction of LDL-cholesterol levels to at least 100 mg/dL in patients with coronary artery disease. The Treating to New Targets study, which will evaluate the effects of LDL-cholesterol lowering to < or = 75 mg/dL with atorvastatin, may help clarify if additional benefit accrues with further reductions. However, up to 82% of patients with proven coronary disease are not even at the current NCEP lipid goal. Up to 55% need a > 30-mg/dL reduction in LDL cholesterol to reach that goal. These data suggest that many patients are not receiving a statin or are receiving an inadequate dose. Aggressive lipid lowering, although a desirable goal, does not yet appear to be standard practice.", 
    "60": "Therapeutic and prophylactic regimens directed specifically against Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) are increasingly being used in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Several of the drugs used in the management of MAC have been associated with significant drug interactions involving the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. This enzyme system is also highly influenced by other drugs used in the management of patients with HIV, particularly the protease inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and azole antifungals. This article reviews the published concentrations or subtherapeutic concentrations of other drugs have been described. In particular, concurrent use of rifabutin with clarithromycin or fluconazole has resulted in increased concentrations of rifabutin and an accompanying increase in the incidence of rifabutin toxicities, including uveitis and leucopenia. Similar results have been seen when rifabutin is combined with protease inhibitors or delavirdine. The macrolides, clarithromycin and azithromycin, have also been associated with significant drug interactions. Clarithromycin has a higher affinity for CYP than azithromycin and, thus, is more frequently associated with clinically significant drug interactions. Clarithromycin is an inhibitor of CYP and may result in toxic concentrations of other drugs metabolised by this enzyme system. Such interactions have been described with rifabutin and the statin lipid-lowering agents. In addition, nevirapine and efavirenz have been shown to significantly reduce clarithromycin concentrations, whereas the protease inhibitors and delavirdine may increase clarithromycin concentrations. Other drugs used in the management of patients with MAC are not metabolised by CYP and thus have a lower incidence of interactions, although the absorption of ciprofloxacin may be impaired when it is given with products containing multivalent cations, such as didanosine. However, clinicians must remain vigilant for drug interactions when reviewing a patient's medication profile, keeping in mind both interactions that have been described in the literature and those that may be predicted based upon known pharmacokinetic profiles.",

Triamcinolone acetonide was used as internal standard. The method was linear within the range of 5 to 200 microg/l pravastatin. The coefficient of variation depended on the pravastatin concentration, but was less than 10% throughout. The pharmacokinetics of pravastatin were determined in healthy individuals. Five healthy subjects received single oral doses of pravastatin (60 mg) and one of these subjects additionally received a dose of 80 mg at three different study days. In all subjects blood was sampled 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240 and 300 min after drug intake.",

The calculated AUCs were between 52 ng/ml x h and 311 ng/ml x h and the corresponding plasma elimination half-life times were between 95 min and 165 min. In all subjects plasma concentrations of pravastatin 5 hours after oral drug administration were near the detection limit of the method (5 microg/l). Intraindividually, there was only little variation in the kinetics of pravastatin. However, marked differences were encountered between the subjects studied.",

This study showed that plaque growth is a general response 1 year after PTA regardless of the use of simvastatin; simvastatin has the potential to induce positive vascular remodeling, thereby reducing the occurrence of restenosis.", 
    "67": "An extended-release (ER) formulation of fluvastatin 80 mg has been developed for once-daily treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia in patients who require fluvastatin dosages of > 40 mg/day. The study aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of the new formulation and to assess the dose response over the range of 40 to 160 mg/day. After a 4-week placebo/dietary run-in period, 123 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (Fredrickson type IIa/IIb) were randomized to receive fluvastatin 40, 80, or 160 mg/day for 6 weeks. The 40 mg/day dosage was administered as the marketed immediate-release (IR) capsule and the 80 mg/day dosage as 1 80-mg ER tablet. Patients receiving 160 mg/day were administered 80 mg/day (1 ER tablet) for the first 2 weeks, followed by 160 mg/day (2 ER tablets) for the remainder of the study. All doses were administered once daily at bedtime. The results showed a linear dose-response relation. Doubling the fluvastatin dosage resulted in a 6% greater mean percent reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (40 mg IR -29%; 80 mg ER -35%; 160 mg ER -41%). In the 160-mg ER group, 62% of patients achieved > or = 40% reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol compared with 32% and 10% of patients in the 80-mg ER and 40-mg IR groups, respectively. Dose ordering of the response was also observed for the other lipid parameters. Fluvastatin ER was well tolerated. Thus, the new ER formulation of fluvastatin was effective and well tolerated in the once-daily treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "68": "The Regression Growth Evaluation Statin Study (REGRESS) is a placebo-controlled multicenter study designed to assess the effect of 2-year treatment with pravastatin on the progression and regression of angiographically documented coronary artery disease. One of the secondary end points was the occurrence of 2-year restenosis in the percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) block. We randomly assigned eligible patients to receive pravastatin 40 mg once daily or placebo. The end point was the percent diameter stenosis of the target lesion at 24 months, as assessed by (semi)quantitative coronary angiography. Two hundred twenty-one patients underwent scheduled PTCA, which was considered successful in 201 patients. One hundred seventy-eight patients underwent angiographic restudy (89%). The patients in the pravastatin group (n = 109) and placebo group (n = 112) were similar at baseline. Percent diameter stenosis before angioplasty was 78 +/- 14% (mean +/- SD) in the pravastatin group and 80 +/- 14% in the placebo group (p = 0.46). At follow-up, the percent diameter stenosis was 32 +/- 23% in the pravastatin group and 45 +/- 29% in the placebo group (p < 0.001). Clinical restenosis was significantly lower in the pravastatin group (7%) compared with the placebo group (29%) (p < 0.001). Risk reduction for all events was 58%. We conclude that treatment with pravastatin reduces 2-year clinical and angiographic restenosis.",

To evaluate this question, we enrolled men into a multicenter randomized, placebo-controlled study lasting 12 weeks. Men with serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) more than 145 mg/dL after 6 weeks of a lipid-lowering diet were randomized to 80 mg simvastatin or placebo. Half of the subjects were asked to undergo a 6-hour infusion of corticotropin (ACTH) to evaluate cortisol synthesis, and the entire cohort received a human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulation test to assess gonadal hormone secretion using pooled serum samples taken 15 minutes apart. A total of 81 men (age, 45 +/- 11 years; 93% Caucasian) with baseline serum LDL-C of 197 mg/dL (placebo, n = 39) and 184 mg/dL (simvastatin 80 mg, n = 42) completed the study. After 12 weeks, serum LDL-C, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in the simvastatin group changed by -43%, -25%, and 8%, respectively (all P < .001). The basal cortisol level and the peak serum cortisol and area under the curve response to the 6-hour ACTH infusion were comparable between the two treatment groups at baseline and after 12 weeks. The pooled total testosterone level at baseline was 541 and 513 ng/dL in the placebo and simvastatin-treated groups, respectively, which declined to 536 +/- 20.5 ng/dL (-1.5%) and 474 +/- 30.4 ng/dL (-13.6%, P = .09) after treatment (mean +/- SD). The pooled free testosterone declined by 6.3% in the simvastatin group, versus a 4.9% increase in the placebo group (P = .588), while pooled bioavailable testosterone declined 10.2% in the simvastatin group and increased 1.4% in the placebo group (P = .035). There were no changes in serum gonadotropin levels or sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). After administration of hCG, there were no differences in the peak total pooled testosterone level before or after 12 weeks of treatment. Simvastatin 80 mg was well tolerated compared with placebo. In conclusion, basal and stimulated cortisol production was unaffected by the use of simvastatin 80 mg versus placebo. As reported with other statins and cholestyramine, there were small declines in the simvastatin-treated group for pooled total, free, and bioavailable testosterone after 12 weeks, although there was no compensatory increase in serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) or luteinizing hormone (LH) levels.",

Patients were then switched after a 1-week washout to the corresponding starting or higher dose of the alternate drug for a second 6-week period. The primary endpoint was the mean percent change from baseline to Week 6 in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol; percent changes from baseline in total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B were also compared. Safety was assessed through adverse experiences and laboratory measurements.",

The main treatment comparison showed no statistically significant difference in changes in LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, whereby the overall effects were comparable when doses of 20 mg and 40 mg of simvastatin were compared with atorvastatin 10 mg and 20 mg. The mean percent reductions for LDL cholesterol from baseline to Week 6 ranged from 35-42% for the entire study cohort. An LDL cholesterol level < or = 130 mg/dl (3.4 mmol/l) was achieved in approximately 70% of patients treated with both drugs in this study.

In addition, the relationships between LPL activity and mass and severity of angina pectoris according to the NYHA classification and silent ischemia on 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring were assessed. Patients in different LPL activity quartiles and mass had different severities of angina; a total of 47% of patients in the lowest LPL quartile reported class III or IV angina. In contrast, only 29% in the highest activity quartile (P:=0.002) had severe angina. These parameters were supported by ambulatory ECG results, for which the total ischemic burden in the lowest LPL activity quartile was 36. 5+/-104.1 mm x min compared with 14.8+/-38.8 mm x min in the highest quartile of LPL activity (P:=0.001). LPL activity levels were strongly correlated with LPL mass (r=0.70, P:<0.0001). A significant association between the LPL protein mass and NYHA class (P:=0.012) was also demonstrated.", 
    "77": "We have demonstrated a significant relationship between LPL mass and activity and severity of ischemia as defined by angina class and ambulatory ECG. These results suggest that LPL influences risk for coronary artery disease by both catalytic and noncatalytic mechanisms.", 
    "78": "In order to investigate the involvement of Ras and/or Rho proteins in the induction of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (NOS II) we used HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and Clostridium difficile toxin B (TcdB) as pharmacological tools. Statins indirectly inhibit small G proteins by preventing their essential farnesylation (Ras) and/or geranylgeranylation (Rho). In contrast, TcdB is a glucosyltransferase and inactivates Rho-proteins directly. Human A549/8- and DLD-1 cells as well as murine 3T3 fibroblasts were preincubated for 18 h with statins (1 - 100 microM) or TcdB (0.01-10 ng ml(-1)). Then NOS II expression was induced by cytokines. NOS II mRNA was measured after 4 - 8 h by RNase protection assay, and NO production were measured by the Griess assay after 24 h. Statins and TcdB markedly increased cytokine-induced NOS II mRNA expression and NO production. Statin-mediated enhancement of NOS II mRNA expression was reversed almost completely by cotreatment with mevalonate or geranylgeranylpyrophosphate. It was only slightly reduced by farnesylpyrophosphate. Therefore, small G proteins of the Rho family are likely to be involved in NOS II induction. In A549/8 cells stably transfected with a luciferase reporter gene under the control of a 16 kb fragment of the human NOS II promoter (pNOS2(16)Luc), statins produced only a small increase in cytokine-induced NOS II promoter activity. In contrast, statins had a considerable superinducing effect in DLD-1 cells stably transfected with pNOS2(16)Luc. In conclusion, our studies provide evidence that statins and TcdB potentiate cytokine-induced NOS II expression via inhibition of small G proteins of the Rho family. This in turn results in an enhanced NOS II promoter activity and/or a prolonged NOS II mRNA stability.", 
    "79": "Since the publication of the second set of guidelines by the National Cholesterol Education Program, a solid body of data from landmark clinical studies has demonstrated that reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (\"statin\") therapy sharply diminishes the risk for coronary artery disease. These trials include the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study, the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study, the Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study, the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events investigation, and the Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease trial. Coronary event rates and, in some cases, all-cause mortality decreased significantly after about 5 years of statin therapy in patients at risk for and those who had coronary artery disease at baseline. In contrast, recent subgroup analyses of these pivotal studies have in the aggregate challenged the premise that lower LDL cholesterol levels necessarily lead to further declines in risk for coronary artery disease, particularly among the patients most likely to be seen by the clinician: those with moderately elevated or normal cholesterol profiles. Indeed, when LDL cholesterol levels are in this range, further lowering with statin therapy elicits diminishing returns in terms of coronary event rates. These findings are readily accommodated by the curvilinear, or log-linear, model between serum cholesterol level and risk for coronary artery disease, which is predicated on data from large epidemiologic studies. In light of the current climate involving competing health care costs, the pursuit of progressively diminishing returns in terms of reductions in coronary artery disease risk through more aggressive lowering of LDL cholesterol levels appears to be unwarranted. Until data are published from ongoing randomized, clinical trials that can more effectively resolve the clinical utility of aggressive lipid-lowering strategies to improve coronary event rates, a prudent, evidence-based strategy seems warranted.",

Both the L-arginine-nitric oxide-cGMP and endothelin pathways are involved in the regulation of vascular tone. Here, we show that the basal transcription rate of the preproendothelin-1 gene was decreased by simvastatin (10 micromol/L) in bovine aortic endothelial cells. Transfection studies with the preproendothelin-1 gene promoter showed that mevalonate (100 micromol/L) was able to prevent the inhibitory effect mediated by simvastatin. Protein geranylgeranylation, but not farnesylation, proved to be crucial for a correct expression of the preproendothelin-1 gene. The C3 exotoxin from Clostridium botulinum that selectively inactivates Rho GTPases, the processing of which involves geranylgeranylation, reproduced the inhibitory effect of simvastatin on the expression of preproendothelin-1. Overexpression of dominant-negative mutants of RhoA and RhoB led to a significant reduction in the preproendothelin-1 promoter activity, whereas the expression of wild-type and constitutively active forms of these proteins resulted in an increase, in support that Rho proteins are required for the basal expression of the preproendothelin-1 gene. Finally, we show that the Rho-dependent activation of the preproendothelin-1 gene transcription was inhibited by simvastatin. Thus, the control of vascular tone and proliferative response mediated by endothelin-1 is regulated at multiple levels, among which the Rho proteins play an essential role.", 
    "95": "The clinical and biochemical determinants of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglyceride response to simvastatin and atorvastatin were assessed in 150 patients with severe hyperlipidemia treated in a randomized open-trial format design. Triglyceride reduction was only dependent on HDL:apolipoprotein A1, change in apolipoprotein B, and dose response, whereas an increase in HDL was dependent on initial LDL, change in LDL or dose response, and therapy with simvastatin.", 
    "96": "Left ventricular (LV) mass is a powerful predictor for future cardiovascular events. Epidemiologic studies have shown that hyperlipidemia is associated with higher LV mass. The effects of statin therapy for hyperlipidemia on LV mass have not been studied. To determine the effects of statin therapy on LV mass, we prospectively studied 3 groups of age and body surface area-matched patients: group 1 (n = 20), patients with systemic hypertension and hyperlipidemia treated with pravastatin plus anti-hypertensive drugs; group 2 (n = 20), patients with hypertension and hyperlipidemia treated with hypertensive agents and diet control alone; and group 3 (n = 20), hypertensive patients with normolipidemia treated with antihypertensive agents. A group of controls without hypertension or hyperlipidemia was used for comparison. Echocardiograms were recorded at baseline and after 6-month therapy. All hypertensive groups showed significant decreases in LV mass index after treatment. Group 1 had the greatest decrease in LV mass and it was significantly higher than in groups 2 and 3. Multivariate analysis revealed that regression of LV mass was significantly correlated only with the use of statins and sex (p = 0.005 and 0.01, respectively, R(2) = 0.47). Linear regression analysis in group 1 showed a significant correlation between changes in arterial compliance and LV mass regression (r = 0.57, p = 0.01). Thus, the addition of a statin may have an additional effect on reducing LV mass, independent of lipid-lowering effects.", 
    "97": "A sensitive and reliable procedure for the simultaneous determination of simvastatin (SV) and its active beta-hydroxy acid metabolite (SVA) in human plasma was developed and validated. The analytes were extracted simultaneously from 0.5 ml aliquots of human plasma samples by methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) via Chem Elut cartridge extraction [also called liquid-solid extraction (LSE) or liquid-liquid cartridge extraction (LLCE)], separated through a Kromasil C(18) column (50 x 2 mm i.d. 5 microm) and detected by tandem mass spectrometry with a turbo ionspray interface. Stable isotope-labeled SV and SVA, (13)CD(3)-SV and (13)CD(3)-SVA, were used as internal standards. SV and SVA were detected in positive and negative ion modes, respectively, via within-run polarity switching. The use of Chem Elut cartridges not only provided a simple and efficient means of plasma sample extraction but also successfully reduced the interconversion between SV and SVA to an undetectable (for lactonization of SVA) or negligible (<0.07%, for hydrolysis of SV) level. The method showed excellent reproducibility, with intra- and inter-assay precisions <4.5% (RSD), and intra- and inter-assay accuracy between 94% and 107% of nominal values, for both analytes. The extraction recoveries were 78% and 87% on average for SV and SVA, respectively. The analyte was found to be stable in plasma through three freeze (-70 degrees C)-thaw (4 degrees C) cycles and for at least 3 h under bench-top storage condition in an ice-bath (4 degrees C), and also in the reconstitution solution at 4 degrees C for at least 24 h. The method has a lower limit of quantitation (LOQ) of 50 pg ml(-1) with a linear calibration range of 0.05-50 ng ml(-1) for both analytes, and has proved to be very reliable for the analysis of clinical samples.", 
    "98": "Because of the potential in-source conversion between a lactone and the corresponding hydroxy acid, it has been recognized that a liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometric (LC/MS/MS) method developed for quantitation of a lactone drug in the presence of its hydroxy acid metabolite (or vice versa) must incorporate chromatographic separation between the two compounds, unless in-source conversion between the two compounds has been eliminated by the appropriate selection of the LC/MS/MS parameters. We now report that chromatographic separation between a lactone and its hydroxy acid will be required under certain LC/MS/MS conditions used even in the absence of in-source conversion. This is due to the fact that the 18-mass-unit difference between a lactone and its hydroxy acid is, by coincidence, different by only one mass unit from the 17-mass-unit difference between the [M + H](+) and [M + NH(4)](+) ions of the lactone or the hydroxy acid. Thus, the [M + H](+) ion of a hydroxy acid is higher than the [M + NH(4)](+) ion of its lactone by only one mass unit. Therefore, in a method developed for quantitation of a hydroxy acid drug utilizing a selected-ion-monitoring (SRM) scheme that incorporates its [M + H](+) ion as the precursor ion, the quantitation would be inaccurate due to the interference by the contribution of the A + 1 isotope response from the [M + NH(4)](+) ion of the lactone metabolite present in the sample, unless there is a chromatographic separation between the two compounds. This is true even if Q1 is operated under a unit-mass resolution. The implication of this type of interference, arising from the presence of both the [M + H](+) and [M + NH(4)](+) ions of a drug and its metabolite, to the selection of LC and MS conditions (including mass resolution) will be discussed using the data obtained with a model lactone drug and its hydroxy acid metabolite.", 
    "99": "The availability of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors has revolutionised the treatment of lipid abnormalities in patients at risk for the development of coronary atherosclerosis. The relatively widespread experience with HMG-CoA therapy has allowed a clear picture to emerge concerning the relative tolerability of these agents. While HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have been shown to decrease complications from atherosclerosis and to improve total mortality, concern has been raised as to the long term safety of these agents. They came under close scrutiny in early trials because ocular complications had been seen with older inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis. However, extensive evaluation demonstrated no significant adverse alteration of ophthalmological function by the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Extensive experience with the potential adverse effect of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on hepatic function has accumulated. The effect on hepatic function for the various HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is roughly dose-related and 1 to 3% of patients experience an increase in hepatic enzyme levels. The majority of liver abnormalities occur within the first 3 months of therapy and require monitoring. Rhabdomyolysis is an uncommon syndrome and occurs in approximately 0.1% of patients who receive HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor monotherapy. However, the incidence is increased when HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are used in combination with agents that share a common metabolic path. The role of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system in drug-drug interactions involving HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors has been extensively studied. Atorvastatin, cerivastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin are predominantly metabolised by the CYP3A4 isozyme. Fluvastatin has several metabolic pathways which involve the CYP enzyme system. Pravastatin is not significantly metabolised by this enzyme and thus has theoretical advantage in combination therapy. The major interactions with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in combination therapy involving rhabdomyolysis include fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, cyclosporin and fluconazole. Additional concern has been raised relative to overzealous lowering of cholesterol which could occur due to the potency of therapy with these agents. Currently, there is no evidence from clinical trials of an increase in cardiovascular or total mortality associated with potent low density lipoprotein reduction. However, a threshold effect had been inferred by retrospective analysis of the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events study utilising pravastatin and the role of aggressive lipid therapy is currently being addressed in several large scale trials.", 
    "100": "Atherosclerosis is the most common cause of vascular diseases, but the relevance of cholesterol has only been definitely associated with coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease. In comparison, the role of cholesterol in stroke is, while a tempting assumption, subject to controversy in the literature. The crucial question--is cholesterol a risk factor for stroke?--remains open. Recent trials with statin drugs, such as 4 S, CARE, LIPID and WOSCOP, have created a new wave of enthusiasm by showing decreased risk of stroke in the statin-treated patients. However, these trials are most often designed for patients with a known history of coronary artery disease. In contrast, studies investigating the impact of statins in the secondary prevention of stroke are still lacking. Moreover, the beneficial effects of statins on clinical events may involve non-cholesterol mechanisms. In regard to stroke prevention, there is no absolute evidence to recommend the use of statin drug therapy.", 
    "101": "This study contrasts the sensitivity of four quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) measures (percent diameter stenosis [%S], minimum lumen diameter, average segment diameter, and percent involvement) in detecting 2-year treatment effects of two lipid-lowering therapies and reports on the longitudinal pattern after 4 years of treatment on the primary QCA trial endpoint (%S) for all, mild/moderate (<50%S), and severe lesions (> or =50%S). Patient cohorts were followed up from two randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of lipid-lowering therapies-colestipol/niacin in the Cholesterol Lowering Atherosclerosis Study (CLAS) and lovastatin in the Monitored Atherosclerosis Regression Study (MARS). Identical QCA methodology was used. In CLAS, the largest 2-year treatment effect size (=0.60) was noted for %S. In MARS, equivalent 2-year effect sizes (=0.15) were noted for three QCA measures. The largest 2-year effect size in %S was found in CLAS for mild/moderate lesions (=0.55) and in MARS for severe lesions (=0.31). Treatment in CLAS led to regression of disease in the first 2 years; treatment in MARS slowed progression of disease in the first 2 years and led to regression of disease after 4 years. Colestipol/niacin reduced progression of mild/moderate and severe lesions over the first 2 years of therapy; lovastatin reduced the progression of severe lesions over the last 2 years of therapy. We conclude that reducing the progression of atherosclerosis is not a simple proposition; maximal therapy for reducing and stabilizing atherosclerosis most likely will result from the selection of agents targeted at specific lesions.",

After 10-20 months on biweekly LA using dextran sulfate cellulose columns and concomitant simvastatin administration, time-averaged levels (+/-SD) measured by integration of the area under the curve were as follows: TC 4.4+/-1.0 mmol/l, LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) 2.5+/-1.0 mmol/l, apolipoprotein B (apo B) 1. 3+/-0.3 g/l, triglycerides (TG) 1.7+/-0.7 mmol/l, HDL-C 1.1+/-0.2 mmol/l, and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] 53.7+/-49.4 mg/dl. Mean acute reductions in TC, LDL-C, apo B, Lp(a), and TG were 61, 77, 75, 76, and 62%, respectively. HDL-C levels were not influenced. Median recovery half times for TC, LDL-C, apo B, and Lp(a) were 3.0, 4.0, 2. 3, and 3.5 days, respectively. The rebound of Lp(a) was identical to LDL-C, in 12 and 13 days post-treatment, respectively, whereas apo B and TC returned to pre-treatment levels in 7.5 and 10 days, respectively, due to the fast rebound of VLDL particles. Notwithstanding these differences, time-averaged levels (C(AVG)) could be estimated uniformly for the four latter parameters with the formula: C(AVG)=C(MIN)+0.73(C(MAX)-C(MIN)), where C(MAX) and C(MIN) are the immediate pre- and post-treatment levels. During long-term treatment the whole-body cholesterol synthesis was increased as measured by the ratio lathosterol to cholesterol of 3.24+/-1.49 mmol/mmol, whereas no further transient increase in the recovery period after LA was found. In conclusion, long-term LA and simvastatin therapy induced acute and chronic changes in lipids and lipoproteins showing the feasibility of biweekly treatment. It was shown that time-averaged levels, as a measure for the effective plasma levels, can be accurately estimated from pre- and post-treatment levels only.", 
    "110": "We tested the effects of vitamin C and atorvastatin treatment on endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilation in 18 hypercholesterolemic patients (ten men and eight women, aged 20-46 years) in comparison with 12 normal volunteers (seven men and five women, aged 20-45 years). The responses of the forearm blood flow (FBF) to acetylcholine (ACh) (7.5, 15 and 30 microg/min), sodium nitroprusside (SNP) (0.8, 1.6, 3.2 microg/min) and L-NMMA (2, 4, 8 micromol/min) were evaluated at baseline and after 1 month of atorvastatin (10 mg/day) treatment. Drugs were infused into the brachial artery and FBF was measured by strain-gauge plethysmography. At baseline, the response to ACh was significantly attenuated in hypercholesterolemics versus controls: at the highest dose (30 microg/min), FBF was 27.0+/-3.4 versus 11.5+/-1.9 ml.100 ml tissue(-1).min(-1) respectively (P<0.0001). No significant differences were found between groups during SNP infusion. The atorvastatin treatment significantly improved ACh-stimulated FBF: at highest dose the FBF increased to 14.9+/-1.5 ml.100 ml tissue(-1). min(-1) (P<0.0001). Similarly, the L-NMMA endothelial effects were significantly enhanced by lipid-lowering treatment, supporting the improvement of basal nitric oxide. Vitamin C increased ACh-vasodilation in the same way before and after atorvastatin treatment. In conclusion, the endothelial dysfunction in hypercholesterolemics is due to an oxidative stress and atorvastatin rapidly improves both basal and stimulated endothelium-dependent vasodilation.", 
    "111": "Hyperlipidemia is common in type 2 diabetic patients and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The aim of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily atorvastatin 10-80 mg for the treatment of hyperlipidemia in type 2 diabetics with plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels exceeding 3.4 mmol/l (130 mg/dl). One hundred and two patients met the study criteria and received 10 mg/day atorvastatin. Patients who reached the target LDL-C level of </=2.6 mmol/l (100 mg/dl) maintained the same dosage regimen until they had completed 16 weeks of treatment. Patients not reaching the target LDL-C underwent dose titration to atorvastatin 20, 40 and 80 mg/day at Weeks 4, 8 and 12, respectively. All 88 patients who completed the study attained target LDL-C levels and 52 (59%) of patients achieved the target goal at the starting dose of atorvastatin 10 mg/day. In this group the differences between baseline and post-treatment values for LDL-C were 4.3+/-0.7 mmol/l (166+/-26 mg/dl) versus 2. 2+/-0.4 mmol/l (87+/-14 mg/dl) (P<0.0001), respectively, a decrease of 47%. Similar trends were observed for total cholesterol, triglycerides, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B levels. The safety profile of atorvastatin in these patients was highly favorable and similar to those reported with other statins. Only one patient withdrew due to a possible drug-related adverse event. These data confirm the marked efficacy and safety of atorvastatin in type 2 diabetic patients with hyperlipidemia and the efficacy of atorvastatin 10 mg in helping patients attain their LDL-C goal.", 
    "112": "Inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, namely statins, improve endothelial function independently of their cholesterol-lowering effects. Plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) plays a critical role in vascular pathophysiology both at the intra- and extravascular levels. We therefore investigated the effects of atorvastatin (ATOR) and fluvastatin (FLU) on PAI-1 and also tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) synthesis in 20% fetal calf serum-cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) stimulated or not by recombinant human pro-inflammatory cytokines, i.e. tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin 1alpha (IL-1alpha). In non-stimulated HUVEC, ATOR and FLU significantly diminished (-50% at 2.0 micromol/l) the constitutive production of PAI-1 (mRNA level and protein secretion). This effect was prevented by addition of mevalonate (100 micromol/l). In HUVEC cultivated in 20% fetal calf serum, the t-PA antigen accumulation was not significantly altered, whereas in low serum concentration (1%) a significant stimulatory effect of ATOR (+30%) and FLU (+76%) was observed. In TNFalpha-stimulated cells, ATOR and FLU had a modest down-modulating effect (-17 and -20%, respectively) on TNFalpha-induced increase in PAI-1 synthesis. No effect of statins was observed in IL-1alpha-stimulated HUVEC, suggesting that statins do not interfere with the up-regulation of PAI-1 synthesis by pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, ATOR and FLU inhibited the TNFalpha-induced decrease in t-PA release. In conclusion, these results show that statins favorably modulate the expression of fibrinolytic factors produced by human endothelial cells.", 
    "113": "We have shown that lovastatin, an inhibitor of 3 hydroxy-3-methylglutary coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, delays development and progression of diabetic nephropathy in streptozotocine-induced diabetic rats through suppression of glomerular transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 mRNA expression. We have also shown that lovastatin suppresses both control and high glucose (HG)-induced TGF-beta1 and fibronectin mRNA expression and protein synthesis by rat mesangial cell (RMC) and that this down-regulation by lovastatin is reversed by mevalonate. It was postulated that this down-regulation may be linked to signaling of small guanine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins and mediated by the limitation of isoprenoids such as farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) in RMC. To determine the isoprenoid and small GTP-binding proteins involved in TGF-beta1 and fibronectin expression. FPP or GGPP was added alone or in combination to RMC treated with lovastatin cultured under normal or high glucose condition. Suppression of TGF-beta1 and fibronectin expression by lovastatin was reversed effectively when GGPP was added alone. Partial reversal of lovastatin effect on fibronectin and TGF-beta1 expression was found when FPP was added alone. Adding both GGPP and FPP resulted in complete reversal of lovastatin effect on fibronectin but not TGF-beta1 suggesting that fibronectin and TGF-beta1 are regulated differently. Furthermore, luciferase activity of RMC cotransfected with fibronectin promoter reporter system and plasmid-expressing C3 exoenzyme (a specific inactivator of Rho family GTP binding proteins, pEFC3) was completely suppressed when compared with RMC cotransfected with empty vector, pEF. Because geranylgeranylation is usually involved in post-translational modification and membrane targeting of Rho family small GTP binding proteins, these data indicate that Rho family small GTP-binding proteins rather than Ras family small GTP binding proteins may play a key role in the TGF-beta1 and fibronectin expression in RMC.", 
    "114": "Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statins, have been shown to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Atherosclerotic plaque lesions can be chronically inflamed and vulnerable to rupture or stable and less rupture-prone. Human smooth muscle cells (SMC) are critically important in maintaining the stability of atherosclerotic plaques. This stability may be greatly influenced by pro-inflammatory mediators such as IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and Il-1beta and Fas ligand (FasL) that are present in human atheroma. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of the statins on apoptosis of SMC. We have found that SMC are normally resistant to Fas or cytokine-induced apoptosis, but can be sensitized to these agents with pharmacological concentrations of some statins. Simvastatin and lovastatin strongly sensitized the cells to apoptotic agents while atorvastatin was less effective. In contrast to the lipophilic statins, the hydrophilic statin pravastatin did not induce this sensitization of SMC to apoptosis. Treatment of SMC with either mevalonate, the product of the HMG-CoA reductase, or geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, a down stream intermediate, prevented lipophilic statin-induced sensitization to apoptosis. These results suggest that prenylation of one or more proteins is critically involved in regulating the sensitivity of SMC to apoptotic stimuli. Our data support the emerging evidence that through this pathway the various statins may have effects which are beyond a simple lowering of the levels of circulating cholesterol.",

Through the inhibition of this enzyme system, grapefruit juice interacts with a variety of medications, leading to elevation of their serum concentrations. Most notable are its effects on cyclosporine, some 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, and some 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors. In the case of some drugs, these increased drug concentrations have been associated with an increased frequency of dose-dependent adverse effects. The P-glycoprotein pump, located in the brush border of the intestinal wall, also transports many cytochrome P-450 3A4 substrates, and this transporter also may be affected by grapefruit juice. This review discusses the proposed mechanisms of action and the medications involved in drug-grapefruit juice interactions and addresses the clinical implications of these interactions.", 
    "116": "It has been claimed that coenzyme Q10 (Q10) would be an effective plasma antioxidant since it can regenerate plasma vitamin E. To test separate effects and interaction between Q10 and vitamin E in the change of plasma concentrations and in the antioxidative efficiency, we carried out a double-masked, double-blind clinical trial in 40 subjects with mild hypercholesterolemia undergoing statin treatment. Subjects were randomly allocated to parallel groups to receive either Q10 (200 mg daily), d-alpha-tocopherol (700 mg daily), both antioxidants or placebo for 3 months. In addition we investigated the pharmacokinetics of Q10 in a separate one-week substudy. In the group that received both antioxidants, the increase in plasma Q10 concentration was attenuated. Only vitamin E supplementation increased significantly the oxidation resistance of isolated LDL. Simultaneous Q10 supplementation did not increase this antioxidative effect of vitamin E. Q10 supplementation increased and vitamin E decreased significantly the proportion of ubiquinol of total Q10, an indication of plasma redox status in vivo. The supplementations used did not affect the redox status of plasma ascorbic acid. In conclusion, only vitamin E has antioxidative efficiency at high radical flux ex vivo. Attenuation of the proportion of plasma ubiquinol of total Q10 in the vitamin E group may represent in vivo evidence of the Q10-based regeneration of the tocopheryl radicals. In addition, Q10 might attenuate plasma lipid peroxidation in vivo, since there was an increased proportion of plasma ubiquinol of total Q10.",

The following costs were included in the analysis: daily treatment costs of pravastatin, non-fatal myocardial infarction, coronary bypass operations and stroke. Life years gained were obtained by applying the declining exponential approximation of life expectancy. All calculations were standardized to 1,000 treated patients. The net costs of treating 1,000 patients (i.e. drug costs minus the costs of sequelae and interventions) are DM 8.4 Mio. In addition, a total of 405 life years may be saved through treatment.

We investigated the effects of chronic pravastatin treatment on the impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation seen in aortae from established streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Starting at 6 weeks of diabetes, pravastatin (10 mg kg(-1)) was administered to STZ-induced diabetic rats for 4 weeks. 2. The increased total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels seen in STZ-induced diabetic rats were not restored to normal by pravastatin. Aortae from pravastatin-treated diabetic rats did not show an impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine. The expression of the mRNA for endothelial nitric oxide synthase was unaffected by diabetes or pravastatin. 3. The enhanced level of malondialdehyde (MDA)-modified LDL seen in STZ-induced diabetic rats was normalized by pravastatin treatment. The resistance of LDL to oxidation was assessed by measuring the amount of MDA or conjugated dienes generated by incubation with copper ions. LDL isolated from diabetic rats, but not those from pravastatin-treated diabetics, showed enhanced the susceptibility to oxidation, but incubation in vitro with pravastatin had no effect on LDL oxidation. 4. Following incubation of control aortae for 6 h with LDL (0.1 mg protein ml(-1)) isolated from diabetic rats, the endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine or A23187 was impaired, but LDL isolated from control or pravastatin-treated rats had no such effect. This inhibitory effect of diabetic LDL was prevented by superoxide dismutase (SOD), a superoxide scavenger. 5. These results suggest that pravastatin preserves endothelial function in aortae from STZ-induced diabetic rats without lowering plasma cholesterol, and its effect may be due to decreased LDL oxidation.",

This study will employ intensive medical management in all patients with coronary disease, and the incremental benefit of state of the art revascularization techniques in terms of clinical event reduction, quality of life issues and cost-effectiveness will be addressed. For now, aggressive medical therapy and revascularization should be viewed as complementary rather than opposing strategies. All patients with coronary heart disease should receive proven medical and lifestyle prescriptions to favorably alter the atherosclerotic process. Percutaneous revascularization without comprehensive risk factor modification is a suboptimal therapeutic strategy.", 
    "128": "Abnormal lipid levels contribute significantly to the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), which is increased further in the presence of other risk factors. The association between elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and CHD risk is well established, and large primary and secondary prevention studies of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have shown conclusively that lowering LDL cholesterol levels reduces CHD events and total mortality. Regardless of the intervention used (diet, surgery, drugs), reduction of plasma cholesterol has consistently produced a reduction in cardiovascular risk. Absolute benefit is greatest in those who are at highest risk initially, and trial results suggest that the lower the LDL cholesterol level achieved, at least down to LDL of 3.0 mmol/l, then the lower is the CHD event risk. Epidemiological data also point to the negative impact of other lipids on CHD risk. Low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and high levels of triglycerides (particularly in conjunction with an LDL/HDL ratio >5) are particularly strong risk factors for CHD. Thus, although prevention trials to date have primarily assessed the impact of LDL lowering on CHD events, the initial assessment of CHD risk should consider a more detailed atherogenic profile including HDL and triglyceride levels. A general approach to preventing cardiovascular disease should include strategies to reduce the overall CHD risk by lifestyle modification and management of modifiable risk factors such as smoking, hypertension and diabetes. Based on data from recent prevention studies, and because they are the most potent lipid-lowering agents available for lowering LDL cholesterol, statins have appropriately become the drug of choice for most patients with hyperlipidaemia who require drug therapy.", 
    "129": "Familial defective apolipoprotein B-100 (FDB) is a genetic disorder caused by a substitution of glutamine for arginine at residue 3500 of the apolipoprotein B-100 molecule. We have identified 23 heterozygotes and one homozygote for FDB (frequency 1:20) in a group of 510 patients with hypercholesterolemia. Mean age of the patients (18 females and 6 males) was 46 years. The diagnosis of FDB was based on point mutation PCR analysis of exon 26 of the apo B gene. Plasma lipids in heterozygous patients were: total cholesterol 8.76+/-1.2 mmol/l, triglycerides 1.42+/-0.5 mmol/l, HDL-cholesterol 1.43+/-0.3 mmol/l, LDL-cholesterol 6.69+/-1.2 mmol/l, apoB 1.69+/-0.4 g/l, Lp(a) 0.26+/-0.2 g/l. The most frequent apoE genotype was 3/3 (19 patients), apoE 3/4 genotype was found in 3 patients and one person had apoE 2/3. Xanthelasma palpebrarum was present in 4 patients and tendon xanthomas in 3 patients including the homozygote. Premature manifestation of coronary heart disease was revealed in 3 patients. Sixteen patients were treated with statins, a combination of statin and resin was used in 2 patients (including the homozygote), whereas six patients were treated with the diet only. We conclude that although the plasma lipid levels of total and LDL cholesterol in FDB patients are lower than in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, the patients with FDB suffer from premature atherosclerosis. The therapeutic approach to FDB individuals and patients with familial hypercholesterolemia is very similar.", 
    "130": "Over the past 15 years several studies have examined the benefits of treating patients with dyslipidemia in order to prevent a first cardiac event and to prevent the onset of clinical symptoms of coronary atherosclerosis. Some of the pitfalls of these studies have been that they have been performed predominantly in men, and also in patients with extremely high cholesterol levels. The Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study (AFCAPS/TexCAPS) provides substantial additional information regarding the benefits of primary prevention in the general population. The study included large numbers of women as well as subjects with a wide variety of ethnic backgrounds, and showed substantial benefit across this population. Patients with average cholesterol levels, but below-average high-density lipoproteins, had substantial reduction in risk of a first cardiac event with aggressive treatment of their dyslipidemia, using lovastatin. The majority of the patients in the AFCAPS/TexCAPS study would not warrant therapy, based on the current National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel guidelines. The data suggest that new strategies are warranted to better identify those patients who are at high risk and those who will receive benefit from aggressive lipid-lowering therapy.", 
    "131": "The underlying disorder in the vast majority of cases of cardiovascular disease is atherosclerosis, for which low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is recognized as a major risk factor. Data from epidemiologic studies have suggested that lower cholesterol levels are associated with a lower overall risk of morbidity and mortality due to coronary heart disease. Numerous clinical trials with lipid-lowering agents support these epidemiologic data. Of these, studies with the HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase inhibitors, or statins, have shown the greatest lipid-lowering effects. Data from recent trials such as the Atorvastatin Versus Revascularization Treatment contribute to a growing body of evidence that suggests that aggressive reduction of cholesterol can yield additional clinical benefits above and beyond that observed with less robust treatment regimens. Aggressive cholesterol-lowering strategies have the potential therefore to have a significant impact on levels of atherosclerotic disease throughout the westernized world. Such effects argue in favor of renaming the entire class of drugs as anti- atherosclerotic rather than lipid-lowering agents.", 
    "132": "Randomized clinical trials have established that lipid- lowering pharmacologic therapy can substantially reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD). Researchers are now working to define the role of lipid-lowering agents in the primary prevention of CAD to extend their benefit to patients at increased risk for future coronary events. The risk assessment models presently used for secondary prevention are not sufficient to identify high-risk, asymptomatic patients. Building on the accumulated data about the physiologic mechanisms and metabolic factors that contribute to CAD, novel serum markers and diagnostic tests are being critically studied to gauge their utility for the assessment of high-risk patients and occult vascular disease. New risk prediction models that combine traditional risk factors for CAD with the prudent use of new screening methods will allow clinicians to target proven risk reduction therapies at high-risk patients before they experience a cardiac event.", 
    "133": "Combination therapy for hyperlipidemia, especially combined hyperlipidemia, may have advantages over single drug therapy, affording better improvement in lipoprotein risk factors and possibly better prevention of atherothrombotic events. Although preliminary experience has been gained using treatment combinations of niacin with statins, and fibrates with statins, few studies have focused on angiographic or clinical outcomes. Both of these treatment combinations increase the risk of drug-induced myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Current estimates of myopathy incidence are much lower than original estimates, but the relative safety of combined therapy might depend upon employing low or moderate statin doses. Safety depends critically upon educating the patient to respond appropriately to muscle symptoms, to intercurrent illness, and to concurrent use of certain other medications. Other useful drug combinations include those derived by addition of fish oil, bile acid binding resins, or stanol esters, as well as nonstatin combinations such as niacin-resin or fibrate-niacin.", 
    "134": "Recent publications, including new population-based studies and a meta-analysis of prospective, population-based studies, provide strong evidence for an elevated triglyceride level as an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease. Pathophysiologic relationships between elevated triglyceride levels and both reduced high-density lipoprotein levels and an increase in the proportion of low density lipoproteins that are small and dense support the epidemiologic data, and suggest that an elevated triglyceride level should constitute a target for lipid-lowering therapy. There are no clear recommendations for management of patients with hypertriglyceridemia available in the current treatment guidelines. Treatment options include life-style measures and, if drug therapy is required, nicotinic acid, fibrates, more potent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), or combination therapy with statin plus fibrate or nicotinic acid.", 
    "135": "Lipid and nonlipid mechanisms contribute to the beneficial effects of some statins on endothelial function, plaque stability and thrombus formation. The nonlipid effects of statins may contribute to alleviation of tissue ischemia and prevention of acute cardiovascular syndromes. Endothelial dysfunction is reversed by a statin and this beneficial property results, in part, from direct actions on the endothelial vasoactive factors, nitric oxide and endothelin-1. Some statins have been shown to inhibit production of proinflammatory cytokines that regulate many key functions of the vascular wall including monocyte adhesion, chemotaxis, and metalloproteinase secretion. Vascular smooth muscle cell synthetic capacity and viability is inhibited by lipophilic agents, whereas a hydrophilic agent does not interfere with this reparative response. Some statins may impede thrombogenesis by reduced activation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway, inhibition of platelet adhesion and aggregation, and improvement in the rheologic profile.", 
    "136": "The genesis of an atherosclerotic plaque depends on interplay of cellular components of the immune system such as monocytes, cytokines, and cell adhesion molecules with lipids, platelets and endothelial cells. Thus, inflammation may play a pivotal role in the propagation of coronary artery disease. Several reports have linked inflammation and cardiovascular risk, particularly a novel acute inflammatory peptide, C-reactive protein (CRP), with future risk of coronary events independent of the traditional coronary artery disease risk factors. To this end, many studies suggest that CRP may be used as a marker of sub-clinical atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk. Specifically, CRP has been positively linked to future cardiovascular events in healthy women, healthy men, elderly patients, and high-risk individuals. In addition, reports have shown associations between CRP and peripheral vascular disease and stroke. Furthermore, preliminary data suggest that the relative efficacy of secondary preventive therapies such as statin drugs and aspirin may depend on the individual patient's baseline CRP level.", 
    "137": "This study describes the rationale, design, and baseline characteristics of a trial to determine whether treatment with fosinopril 20 mg/day and/or pravastatin 40 mg/ day will prevent cardiovascular and renal disease in nonhypertensive (RR <160/100 mm Hg and not using antihypertensive medication) and nonhypercholesterolemic (total cholesterol <8.0 or <5.0 mmol/L in case of previous myocardial infarction and not using lipid lowering medication) men and women with persistent microalbuminuria (urinary albumin excretion >10 mg/L once in an early morning spot urine and 15 to 300 mg/24-hour at least once in two 24-hour urine collections). The Prevention of REnal and Vascular ENdstage Disease Intervention Trial is a single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with a 2 x 2 factorial design. The 864 randomized subjects will be monitored for a minimum of 4 years and a maximum of 5 years. The primary efficacy parameter is defined as the combined incidence of all-cause mortality or hospital admission for documented (1) nonfatal myocardial infarction, (2) myocardial ischemia, (3) heart failure, (4) peripheral vascular disease, (5) cerebrovascular accident and/or (6) end-stage renal disease.", 
    "138": "Acute tubular cell injury is accompanied by plasma membrane phospholipid breakdown. Although cholesterol is a dominant membrane lipid which interdigitates with, and impacts, phospholipid homeostasis, its fate during the induction and recovery phases of acute renal failure (ARF) has remained ill defined. The present study was performed to ascertain whether altered cholesterol expression is a hallmark of evolving tubular damage. Using gas chromatographic analysis, free cholesterol (FC) and esterified cholesterol (CE) were quantified in: 1) isolated mouse proximal tubule segments (PTS) after 30 minutes of hypoxic or oxidant (ferrous ammonium sulfate) injury; 2) cultured proximal tubule (HK-2) cells after 4 or 18 hours of either ATP depletion/Ca(2+) ionophore- or ferrous ammonium sulfate-mediated injury; and 3) in renal cortex 18 hours after induction of glycerol-induced myoglobinuric ARF, a time corresponding to the so-called \"acquired cytoresistance\" state (ie, resistance to further renal damage). Hypoxic and oxidant injury each induced approximately 33% decrements in CE (but not FC) levels in PTS, corresponding with lethal cell injury ( approximately 50 to 60% LDH release). When comparable CE declines were induced in normal PTS by exogenous cholesterol esterase treatment, proportionate lethal cell injury resulted. During models of slowly evolving HK-2 cell injury, progressive CE increments occurred: these were first noted at 4 hours, and reached approximately 600% by 18 hours. In vivo myoglobinuric ARF produced comparable renal cortical CE (and to a lesser extent FC) increments. Renal CE accumulation strikingly correlated with the severity of ARF (eg, blood urea nitrogen versus CE; r, 0.84). Mevastatin blocked cholesterol accumulation in injured HK-2 cells, indicating de novo synthesis was responsible. Acute tubule injury first lowers, then raises, tubule cholesterol content. Based on previous observations that cholesterol has cytoprotectant properties, the present findings have potential relevance for both the induction and maintenance phases of ARF."
