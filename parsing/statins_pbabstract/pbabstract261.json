    "0": "To assess the temporal effect of statin therapy on coronary atherosclerotic plaque volume measured by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), we searched PubMed for eligible studies published between 1990 and January 2006. Inclusion criteria for retrieved studies were (1) IVUS volume analysis at baseline and follow-up and (2) statin therapy in > or =1 group of patients. All data of interest were abstracted in prespecified structured collection forms. Statistical analysis was performed with Review Manager 4.2. Random-effect weighted mean difference (WMD) was used as summary statistics for comparison of continuous variables. Nine studies of 985 patients (with 11 statin treatment arms) were selected. After a mean follow-up of 9.8 +/- 4.9 months, we found a significant decrease in coronary plaque volume (WMD -5.77 mm(3), 95% confidence interval -10.36 to -1.17, p = 0.01), with no significant heterogeneity across studies (p = 0.47). Prespecified subgroup analyses showed similar trends. Studies in which the achieved low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level was <100 mg/dl showed a trend for plaque regression (WMD -7.88 mm(3), 95% confidence interval -16.31 to 0.55, p = 0.07), whereas studies in which the achieved level of LDL cholesterol was > or =100 mg/dl, the trend was less evident (WMD -4.22 mm(3), 95% confidence interval -10.27 to 1.82, p = 0.17). Plaque volume remained essentially unchanged in patients not treated with statins (WMD 0.13 mm(3), 95% confidence interval -4.42 to 4.68, p = 0.96). In conclusion, statin therapy, particularly when achieving the target LDL level, appears to promote a significant regression of coronary plaque volume as measured by IVUS.", 
    "1": "Tissue factor (TF) is a key mediator of atherosclerotic plaque thrombogenicity and may be regulated by plaque TF pathway inhibitor (TFPI). High atherogenic lipoproteins are a well-known arterial risk factor, but their effects on the TF/TFPI balance in atherosclerotic plaques, as well as those of widely used lipid-lowering agents such as statins, are incompletely understood.", 
    "2": "We analyzed the TF/TFPI balance in carotid plaques from 86 patients, according to the presence of dyslipidemia and statin therapy.", 
    "3": "In patients with untreated dyslipidemia (ApoB/ApoA1 ratio >0.7) (D+) (n=44), TF antigen (TF) tended to be higher than in those without dyslipidemia (D-) (n=16). In patients with statins (S+) (n=26), TF was lower than in D+ (p=0.02) and similar to that of D- patients. TFPI antigen was higher in D- than in D+ and S+ patients (p<or=0.02). As a result, the TF/TFPI (mol/mol) ratio was higher in D+ than in D- or S+ patients (p<or=0.005). TF activity correlated to TF/TFPI ratio (p<0.0001), and was higher in the D+ than in the D- and in the S+ patients (p=0.02). Among analyzed clinical risk factors and biological parameters, including CRP, dyslipidemia was the only independent predictor for low plaque TFPI and high TF/TFPI ratio. Histochemistry showed that TF and TFPI were mainly expressed in macrophage-rich regions surrounding the lipid-rich core in the three groups.", 
    "4": "These results indicate that dyslipidemia is associated with a shift of the TF/TFPI balance and of TF activity toward higher plaque thrombotic potential. Statins correct this equilibrium mainly by decreasing plaque TF together with blood atherogenic lipoproteins.", 
    "5": "We present a case study of a person (63 year-old man), who has been using statins for 18 years, with rhabdomyolysis of the bilateral adductor muscles associated with strenuous and prolonged eccentric exercises (hiking) in a hot environment. Clinical examination showed predominantly on the right side muscle swelling and palpational pain of the bilateral adductor muscle groups and bilateral tibial edema. His serum creatine kinase (CK) level was 12218 IU/L. T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images showed a high signal intensity in the bilateral adductor muscles of the hip. The patient did not develop complications and returned to his previous performance level in 30 days following adequate hydration and resting of the affected muscles. Strenuous eccentric exercise should be avoided during the course of statin use and clinicians should be aware of present observations when considering the significance of acute CK elevations in patients on statin treatment. Key pointsStatin use can be one of the causes of the rhabdomyolysis following a strenuous eccentric exercise.Elevated CK levels and MRI imaging are important for the diagnosis.The treatment consists of complete rest and adequate hydration.", 
    "6": "The combination of Simvastatin and Ezetimibe allows dual inhibition of both cholesterol production and absorption. This treatment approach allows achieving same low serum cholesterol levels with the administration of much lower doses of statins. This should reduce side effects, compared to statin only therapy, enabling more patients to achieve their LDL cholesterol treatment goals. With ezetimibe/simvastatin therapy, reductions of about 60% from baseline in LDL cholesterol have been shown. Concomitant improvement in other lipid fractions have also been demonstrated. The ezetimibe/simvastatin combination has been well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of statin therapy. This article will review clinical experience with ezetimibe/simvastatin combination, commenting upon its place and potential value in the prevention of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "7": "This study was conducted to investigate the hypocholesterolemic effect of simvastatin (30 mg/kg BW) and antioxidant effect of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10, 15 mg/kg BW) or green tea (5%) on erythrocyte Na leak, platelet aggregation and TBARS production in hypercholesterolemic rats treated with statin. Food efficiency ratio (FER, ADG/ADFI) was decreased in statin group and increased in green tea group, and the difference between these two groups was significant (p<0.05). Plasma total cholesterol was somewhat increased in all groups with statin compared with control. Plasma triglyceride was decreased in statin group and increased in groups of CoQ10 and green tea, and the difference between groups of statin and green tea was significant (p<0.05). Liver total cholesterol was not different between the control and statin group, but was significantly decreased in the group with green tea compared with other groups (p<0.05). Liver triglyceride was decreased in groups of statin and green tea compared with the control, and the difference between groups of the control and green tea was significant (p<0.05). Platelet aggregation of both the initial slope and the maximum was not significantly different, but the group with green tea tended to be higher in initial slope and lower in the maximum. Intracellular Na of group with green tea was significantly higher than the control or statin group (p<0.05). Na leak in intact cells was significantly decreased in the statin group compared with the control (p<0.05). Na leak in AAPH treated cells was also significantly reduced in the statin group compared with groups of the control and CoQ10 (p<0.05). TBARS production in platelet rich plasma was significantly decreased in the groups with CoQ10 and green tea compared with the control and statin groups (p<0.05). TBARS of liver was significantly decreased in the group with green tea compared with the statin group (p<0.05). In the present study, even a high dose of statin did not show a cholesterol lowering effect, therefore depletion of CoQ10 following statin treatment in rats is not clear. More clinical studies are needed for therapeutic use of CoQ10 as an antioxidant in prevention of degenerative diseases independent of statin therapy.", 
    "8": "The combination of a beta-blocker, a platelet inhibitor, a statin and an ACE inhibitor (B.A.S.I.C. regimen) provides major therapeutic benefits in the management of coronary patients. In patients receiving the quadruple combination, the overall mortality risk is 75% lower than for patients receiving none of these four therapies. According to the data from the PREVENIR III study, the combination of a statin and a platelet inhibitor reduces the risk of recurrent coronary events by 71%, the risk of recurrent vascular events by 65% and the risk of death from all causes taken together by 68%, when compared with the absence of these two medications. In the French USIC 2000 survey, prescription of the triple combination of platelet inhibitor, statin and beta-blocker is also associated with a 50% reduction in overall mortality. However, although the B.A.S.I.C. strategy is of major therapeutic value, it markedly increases the number of tablets to be taken every day. Treatment compliance, which is a predictive factor for overall mortality in diabetic coronary patients, diminishes markedly as the number of medications to be taken every day increases. The availability of fixed combinations, e.g. statin-acetylsalicylic acid, thus makes it possible to reduce the number of tablets to be taken at any one time, thus potentially increasing treatment compliance and the efficacy of the treatment administered.", 
    "9": "The rationale behind combined statin-acetylsalicylic acid therapy is based on the beneficial effects ofacetylsalicylic acid on thrombosis, the leading immediate cause of the majority of occlusive cardiovascular events, and those of statins on atherosclerosis, which is the main underlying cause. The clinical benefits of combined pravastatin-acetylsalicylic acid in the management of coronary patients have been demonstrated by a meta-analysis of five randomized clinical trials for secondary prevention; compared with pravastatin alone, the pravastatin-acetylsalicylic acid combination reduced the risk of fatal or non fatal myocardial infarction by 26%, the risk of ischemic stroke by 31%, and the risk of cardiovascular events at 5 years by 13%. Combined pravastatin-acetylsalicylic acid therefore appears to significantly reduce the cardiovascular risk in coronary patients. Following the AHA/ACC and National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) I and II guidelines, the proportion of patients treated by acetylsalicylic acid, beta-blockers and statins increased significantly: 94%, 57% and 91% respectively at one year versus 68%, 18% and 10% before the guidelines were applied. The impact of these treatments on clinical outcomes is statistically significant in terms of recurrent myocardial infarction, the need for re-hospitalization, sudden death or all-cause mortality. Patients treated with combined statin-acetylsalicylic acid therapy have significantly improved clinical outcome and a significantly lower rate of coronary events at 1 year of follow-up. These data therefore confirm the importance of optimizing therapeutic management of coronary patients, and in particular with combined acetylsalicylic acid-statin therapy.", 
    "10": "Atherothrombotic lesions associate atherosclerosis with a thrombotic reaction; they result from a complex inflammatory response to multifactorial stress. Endothelial dysfunction, lipid accumulation in the arterial intima, the recruitment of circulating monocytes and differentiation into macrophages and then foam cells, and an inflammatory reaction, all participate in the genesis of atheromatous plaque. The lipid core and fibrous parts of the plaque then contribute to its progression towards stenosis as a result of lipid infiltration, an accumulation of foam cells and the proliferation of smooth muscle cells with the synthesis of extracellular matrix. Atheromatous plaque is likely to rupture. The inflammatory components and an accumulation of cholesterol are two important characteristics found in the event of plaque rupture. The importance of the incorporation of thrombotic material formed during a silent rupture should also be emphasised. Among the factors favouring plaque rupture, a distinction can be made between extrinsic factors such as hypertension, and intrinsic factors which reflect the vulnerability of the plaque in terms of its quantitative aspects (relative composition in lipids and fibrous tissues) and qualitative characteristics (solidity of the fibrous cap and proteins in the extracellular matrix, the degradation of which is controlled by metalloproteinases). In the prevention of atherothrombosis-related complications, statins and platelet inhibitors have complementary mechanisms of action. Statins reduce inflammation, modify the composition of atheromatous plaque and promote stabilisation, while acetylsalicylic acid reduces the formation of thrombin, exerts an anti-thrombotic action, reduces endothelial dysfunction and the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, and, like statins, has an anti-inflammatory effect. As a result, in the context of the B.A.S.I.C. strategy recommended by 2002-2003 ESC guidelines, the fixed statin-acetylsalicylic acid combination appears to constitute a logical combination in coronary patients in order to prevent the clinical complications linked to atherothrombosis.", 
    "11": "The management of coronary patients aims at improving the prognosis, by preventing myocardial infarction and/or death, and also at optimal reduction of symptoms related to coronary disease. This can be achieved by a variety of approaches including coronary revascularisation, life-style modifications and drug therapies including several drug classes: platelet inhibitors, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, statins and anti-anginal drugs. The B.A.S.I.C. regimen is a combination of a beta-blocker, a platelet inhibitor, a statin and an ACE inhibitor for secondary prevention in coronary patients. Although recommended in the latest ESC and AHA/ACC guidelines, this strategy is insufficiently applied in medical practice. Indeed, the results of the European Action on Secondary Prevention by Intervention to Reduce Events (EUROASPIRE) Survey conducted over the period 1999-2000, show that 6 months after a first hospitalisation for aorto-coronary bypass, percutaneous coronary angioplasty, myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome, 86% of patients are prescribed a platelet inhibitor, 63% a beta-blocker, 61% a hypolipidaemic agent and only 38%, an ACE inhibitor. The PREVENIR Study published in 2005 reported that only 12% of patients are prescribed the B.A.S.I.C. quadritherapy outside the acute phase. Despite recognised benefits in terms of survival, the B.A.S.I.C. approach is therefore clearly under-prescribed following coronary events.", 
    "12": "Atherosclerosis, which causes approximately half of all deaths of adults over age 60 in industrialized nations, is a pandemic among inappropriately nourished and/or physically hypoactive children, adolescents, and adults world wide. Although nowadays statins are widely prescribed to middle age and elderly adults with high blood lipid levels as pharmacological prevention for the late complications of atherosclerosis, from a critical point of view statins seem not to solve the problem, especially when compared with certain natural ingredients of our nutrition like micronutrients as alternative strategy. Statin ingestion is associated with lowering of serum cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein concentrations; some prospective studies have shown statistical associations with subsequent modest reduction of mortality from cardiovascular disease. However, specific biochemical pathways and pharmacological roles of statins in prevention of atherosclerosis, if any, are unknown. Moreover, there have been no systematic cost-benefit analyses of life-style prophylaxis versus statin prophylaxis versus combined life-style plus statin prophylaxis versus neither life-style nor statin prophylaxis for clinically significant complications of cardiovascular diseases in the elderly. Further, in the trials of effectiveness statins were not compared with management of nutrition, which is the most appropriate alternative intervention. Such studies seem to be important, as the ever increasing world population, especially in developing countries, now demand expensive statins, which may be unaffordable for mitigating the pandemic. Studies of this kind are necessary to identify more precisely those patients for whom cardiovascular benefits will outweigh the risks and costs of the statin treatment in comparison with nutritional interventions. Against the background of the current pathogenetic concept of atherogenesis some of its possible risk factors, particularly the roles of cholesterol and homocysteine, and the effects of statins versus nutritional (micronutrients) interventions in prevention and treatment of the disease are discussed. The prevailing opinion that serum cholesterol as a mediator of the disease is increased by eating saturated fats and decreased by eating polyunsaturated fats is being challenged. Evidently, the beneficial effects of statins in atherosclerosis are not mainly due to its cholesterol lowering effect, rather than to its \"pleiotropic effects\". Other pathogenetic factors in atherosclerosis are involved, like inflammatory and immunologic processes, that can be modulated by statins as well as by other drugs or by the Mediterranean-style nutrition and by micronutrients (folate, B-vitamins).",

Standard inhaled corticosteroids markedly suppress such inflammatory changes, resulting in clinical beneficial effects. However, it is also notified that airway wall remodeling including goblet cell hyperplasia, sub-epithelial collagen deposits, increased capillary networks and smooth muscle hypertrophy occur as a chronic consequence of this disorder even by the recommended strategies with steroid treatment. These pathologic changes play an important role in the increased airway obstruction and hyperresponsiveness, and eventually in the development of irreversible respiratory failure. Recent studies have elucidated that myofibroblasts and smooth muscle as well as mucosal epithelial cells play a vital role in these processes. Agents regulating proliferation, differentiation and activity of these cells, especially of low-molecular weight compounds, attract attention. Studies on molecular mechanisms of above processes, have led the development and patents of potential drugs including inhibitors of NF kappaB, statins, macrolides and phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors.",

    "19": "A moderate-dose statin was of little benefit in a population aged 70 to 82 years when given for 3 years in the setting of suboptimally treated blood pressure. More evidence supports the use of blood pressure-lowering medications, but few data are available regarding the appropriate blood pressure target and most effective agents in the elderly. Some evidence also suggests that the elderly could experience higher mortality with antihypertensive treatment. These findings, along with greater safety concerns and an increasing number of competing risks and medical conditions with advancing age, make it imperative to carefully evaluate the risk/benefit balance from treating hypercholesterolemia and hypertension in persons aged > or =70 years.", 
    "20": "We propose a 5-year 2x2 factorial trial of primary prevention in the elderly that will (1) evaluate whether statin therapy will reduce the risk of cardiovascular events when added to the treatment of hypertension to achieve a blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg in most patients and (2) determine the most appropriate blood pressure regimen for the prevention of cardiovascular and renal events.", 
    "21": "Mortality rates in patients with schizophrenia are double compared to those in the general population, with cardiovascular disease causing 50% of the excess. Lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is recognized as a primary target for the prevention of cardiovascular mortality according to the National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III. Use of lipid-lowering drugs such as statins is recommended when lifestyle changes are not sufficient to reach the LDL goal. The efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin treatment were evaluated in schizophrenic patients.", 
    "22": "100 schizophrenic patients with severe dyslipidemia were identified. All were treated with antipsychotics. Fifty-two patients were treated with rosuvastatin and compared with 48 who did not receive statin treatment. All patients were screened for cardiovascular risk factors and examined at baseline. The effects of lipid-lowering medication on lipid profile, glucose homeostasis, and components of metabolic syndrome were evaluated at 3-month follow-up. The study began in 2003, and all data available until December 2005 are reported.",

Recent studies have indicated statins, a class of cholesterol-lowering drugs, as a potential therapy for Alzheimer's disease. Our objective was to determine whether administering a statin drug (simvastatin) would protect against the development of behavioral deficits in an established mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "29": "The inhibition of hepatic uptake transporters, such as OATP1B1, on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin is unknown. Here, we investigate the effect of a model hepatic transporter inhibitor, rifampin, on the kinetics of atorvastatin and its metabolites in humans. The inhibitory effect of a single rifampin dose on atorvastatin kinetics was studied in 11 healthy volunteers in a randomized, crossover study. Each subject received two 40-mg doses of atorvastatin, one on study day 1 and one on study day 8, separated by 1 week. One intravenous 30-min infusion of 600 mg rifampin was administered to each subject on either study day 1 or study day 8. Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin and metabolites were above the limits of quantitation for up to 24 h after dosing. Rifampin significantly increased the total area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of atorvastatin acid by 6.8+/-2.4-fold and that of 2-hydroxy-atorvastatin acid and 4-hydroxy-atorvastatin acid by 6.8+/-2.5- and 3.9+/-2.4-fold, respectively. The AUC values of the lactone forms of atorvastatin, 2-hydroxy-atorvastatin and 4-hydroxy-atorvastatin, were also significantly increased, but to a lower extent. An intravenous dose of rifampin substantially increased the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin and its acid and lactone metabolites. The data confirm that OATP1B transporters represent the major hepatic uptake systems for atorvastatin and its active metabolites. Inhibition of hepatic uptake may have consequences for efficacy and toxicity of drugs like atorvastatin that are mainly eliminated by the hepatobiliary system.", 
    "30": "In addition to the prevention of cardiovascular diseases by lowering plasma LDL cholesterol, recent studies suggest that statins could have some impact on insulin action. To estimate the direct effects of statins on insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells, MIN6 cells were treated with pravastatin, simvastatin, or atorvastatin. Basal insulin secretion at low glucose concentration was unexpectedly increased at very high doses of simvastatin or atorvastatin after 24- and 48-hour incubation. Insulin secretion at high glucose was not significantly changed, and thus, net glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was apparently decreased by these lipophilic statins. The changes in insulin secretion were highly associated with increased endogenous SREBP activities in response to HMG-CoA inhibition as estimated by SRE-luciferase assays, and finally after 48-hour incubation, accompanied by impaired cell viability as estimated by MTT assays. In contrast, these changes were much less prominent by the addition of pravastatin. Meanwhile, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion of islets isolated from C57BL/6 mice was not significantly changed by any of the statins. Overall, taken up by beta-cells, statins can affect insulin secretion through either HMG-CoA inhibition or cytotoxicity, as observed by the addition of extraordinary high doses of lipophilic statins, but not hydrophilic statins, to the medium.", 
    "31": "Although statins are prescribed as relatively safe and effective drugs for hypercholesterolemic patients, it has been reported that a significant side effect, myopathy, occurs infrequently during medication. Moreover, because statins decrease cardiac ubiquinone levels, the risk of cardiac dysfunction has been suggested. This study sought to evaluate and compare the cytotoxicity of statins (cerivastatin, pitavastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin and pravastatin) in cultured human skeletal muscle cells (HSkMCs) and the effects on ubiquinone levels in statin-treated rat skeletal muscle and heart. Cerivastatin, the most potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, showed the strongest cytotoxicity (over 10-fold) among the statins examined, while the effects of the others were in a similar range. In rat experiments, neither pitavastatin nor cerivastatin decreased ubiquinone levels in skeletal muscle, but both dose-dependently lowered ubiquinone levels in the heart. As the rates of reduction by pitavastatin (9.6% at 30 mg/kg) and cerivastatin (9.7% at 0.3 mg/kg) were almost equal, it was estimated that cerivastatin reduced ubiquinone levels in the rat heart approximately 100-fold more strongly than pitavastatin, based on the effective doses. We found that cerivastatin showed the most potent cytotoxicity in HSkMCs and strongly lowered ubiquinone levels in the rat heart.", 
    "32": "The treatment of hyperlipidemia is aimed at preventing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and coronary heart disease (CHD). As the incidence of CHD in Japan is about one-third lower and that of stroke is two-fold higher compared to Western countries, and the doses of lipid-lowering drugs used in foreign randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) are much higher than in general use in Japan, it remains unclear whether the results of RCTs conducted in Western countries could be extrapolated to Japanese patients. Recently, two major large-scale, prospective, RCTs in Japanese hypercholesterolmic patients, the Management of Elevated Cholesterol in the Primary Prevention of Adult Japanese (MEGA) study and the Japan EPA Lipid Intervention Study (JELIS), have been reported. Japanese epidemiological studies and Japanese clinical studies are reviewed. The evidence suggests that hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and low HDL-cholesterol are strongly associated with increased CHD risk. Lipid-lowering medication shows beneficial effects even in low-risk populations; however, the data did not support that lower cholesterol is better. The safety and efficacy of hyperlipidemia treatment in Japanese patients are discussed.", 
    "33": "Experimental studies point to an interplay between hypercholesterolemia and hypertension, acting through the renin angiotensin system. In a crossover study design with 8 healthy subjects, the authors tested the hypothesis that statin treatment exerts renin angiotensin system-modulating effects in veins by down-regulation of AT1-receptors, resulting in reduced Angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced venoconstriction and by increasing the pleiotropic Ang II-metabolite Ang-(1-7). Irbesartan was used as positive control. Ang II-induced venoconstriction was 49% +/- 9% before and 64% +/- 10% after 30 days of atorvastatin treatment compared to 50% +/- 8% before and 15% +/- 9% after irbesartan (P = .004). Plasma angiotensin levels significantly increased only after irbesartan treatment (Ang II: 35 +/- 4 vs 329 +/- 101 pg/mL [P = .02]; Ang-(1-7): 10 +/- 3 vs 35 +/- 6 pg/mL [P = .01]) compared to atorvastatin treatment (Ang II: 26 +/- 5 vs 31 +/- 4 pg/mL [P = ns]; Ang-(1-7): 9 +/- 2 vs 11 +/- 3 pg/mL [P = ns]). The data indicate that atorvastatin does not inhibit Ang II-induced venoconstriction in vivo and point toward a supportive role of Ang-(1-7) in contributing to the antihypertensive and beneficial vascular effects of irbesartan.", 
    "34": "Simvastatin, a cholesterol-lowering agent, is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4/5. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of CYP3A5*3 genotype on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin in humans. Twenty-two men with CYP3A5*1/*1 (n = 4), CYP3A5*1/*3 (n = 8), or CYP3A5*3/*3 (n = 10) genotypes were enrolled. Each subject ingested a 20-mg dose of simvastatin, and plasma simvastatin concentrations were measured for 12 hours after dosing. The mean (+/-SD) area under the plasma concentration-time curve for simvastatin in the CYP3A5*1/*1 carriers (4.94 +/- 2.25 ng x h/mL) was significantly lower than CYP3A5*3/*3 carriers (16.35 +/- 6.37 ng x h/mL; P = .013, Bonferroni test). The mean (+/-SD) oral clearance was also significantly different between CYP3A5*1/*1 carriers (4.80 +/- 2.35 L/h) and CYP3A5*3/*3 carriers (1.35 +/- 0.61 L/h; P < .05, Dunn's test). However, other pharmacokinetic parameters including peak plasma concentrations and half-life did not show any difference between genotype groups. These findings suggest that the polymorphic CYP3A5 gene affects the disposition of simvastatin and provides a plausible explanation for interindividual variability of simvastatin disposition.",

Of all CHD patients, approximately 70% did not achieve a serum LDL-C target of <100 mg/dL. Most patients receiving HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) regimens were treated initially with low- to medium-equipotency regimens and were never titrated to stronger regimens. The vast majority (approximately 94%) of patients at very high risk did not achieve the stringent serum LDL-C target of <70 mg/dL. Patients receiving higher potency statins were significantly more likely to achieve LDL-C goals, whereas those with higher baseline LDL-C levels or Malaysian ethnicity were less likely to achieve LDL-C goals.",

A more effective disease-management approach, including patient education concerning lifestyle modification (e.g. diet, physical activity), efforts to enhance medication adherence, and more effective, well tolerated therapies such as high-equipotency or high-dose statins and statin combination regimens, may be needed to improve achievement of consensus cholesterol targets.

Benefits have been documented in primary and secondary prevention, across a range of baseline cholesterol levels, in the young and old, and in patients with varying manifestations of cardiovascular disease. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that risk is associated with serum cholesterol in a continuous, graded fashion with no clear threshold below which further reductions in risk do not occur. In aggregate, the placebo-controlled statin trials strongly suggest that the magnitude of risk reduction is related to the degree of cholesterol lowering achieved. However, until recently, it was unknown whether intensified cholesterol lowering with higher doses of newer, more potent statins could bring further gains over a policy of moderate or conventional lipid lowering. This article summarizes the results of randomized trials comparing these two strategies in patients with a history of coronary artery disease.",

In this review we analyse the current evidence linking cholesterol metabolism and regulation in the CNS with the known mechanisms underlying the development of Alzheimer's Disease. Cholesterol is known to affect amyloid-beta generation and toxicity, although it must be considered that the results studies using the statin class of drugs to lower plasma cholesterol may be affected by other effects associated with these drugs.

Platelets from rosuvastatin-treated non-fructose-fed (NFF) and fructose-fed (FF) hamsters were analyzed for aggregability and psPDI-denitrosation activity. Platelets from NFF animals treated with xanthine/xanthine oxidase (X/XO) were assessed for the same parameters and primary aortic endothelial cells (AEC) cultivated with a range of [rosuvastatin] +/- mevalonate were analyzed for ROS production. Platelets from FF hamsters displayed statistically significant enhanced ROS production, diminished psPDI-mediated NO-releasing activity, and hyperaggregability. Suggestively, platelets from NFF animals treated with X/XO displayed characteristics similar to platelets from FF animals. Rosuvastatin elicited a normalizing effect on all parameters measured in platelets from FF animals. Further, ROS production in primary AEC from FF animals could be blunted to that of NFF animals by concentrations of rosuvastatin in the range of those achieved in the bloodstream. Diminished psPDI-dependent NO-releasing activity and increased initial aggregation rates of FF platelets may result from elevated vascular ROS production under conditions of insulin resistance. Normalization of ROS production and platelet aggregation by rosuvastatin indicates its potential use as a vasculoprotective agent.", 
    "50": "Regulation of cholesterol metabolism in cultured cells and in the liver is dependent on actions of the LDL receptor. However, nonhepatic tissues have multiple pathways of cholesterol uptake. One possible pathway is mediated by LPL, an enzyme that primarily hydrolyzes plasma triglyceride into fatty acids. In this study, LDL uptake and tissue cholesterol levels in heart and skeletal muscle of wild-type and transgenic mice with alterations in LPL expression were assessed. Overexpression of a myocyte-anchored form of LPL in heart muscle led to increased uptake of LDL and greater heart cholesterol levels. Loss of LDL receptors did not alter LDL uptake into heart or skeletal muscle. To induce LDL receptors, mice were treated with simvastatin. Statin treatment increased LDL receptor expression and LDL uptake by liver and skeletal muscle but not heart muscle. Plasma creatinine phosphokinase as well as muscle mitochondria, cholesterol, and lipid droplet levels were increased in statin-treated mice overexpressing LPL in skeletal muscle. Thus, pathways affecting cholesterol balance in heart and skeletal muscle differ.",

Both statin (S) and resveratrol (R) demonstrated cardioprotection through nitric oxide-dependent mechanism. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to determine whether combination therapy with statin and resveratrol is more cardioprotective than individual treatment groups in ischemic rat heart model. The rats were fed with 2% high cholesterol diet and after 8 weeks of high cholesterol diet the animals were treated with statin (1 mg/kg bw/day) and resveratrol (20 mg/kg bw/day) for 2 weeks. The rats were assigned to: (1) Control (C), (2) HC, (3) HCR, (4) HCS and (5) HCRS. The hearts, subjected to 30-min global ischemia followed by 120-min reperfusion were used as experimental model. The left ventricular functional recovery (+dp/dt(max)) was found to be significantly better in the HCRS (1926+/-43), HCR (1556+/-65) and HCS (1635+/-40) compared to HC group (1127+/-16). The infarct sizes in the HCRS, HCS and HCR groups were 37+/-3.6, 43+/-3.3 and 44+/-4.2 respectively compared to 53+/-4.6 in HC. The lipid level was found to be decreased in all the treatment groups when compared to HC more significantly in HCS and HCRS groups when compared to HCR. Increased phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS was also observed in all the treatment groups resulting in decreased extent of cardiomyocyte apoptosis but the extent of reduction in apoptosis was more significant in HCRS group compared to all other groups. In vivo rat myocardial infarction (MI) model subjected to 1 week of permanent left descending coronary artery (LAD) occlusion documented increased capillary density in HCR and HCRS treated group when compared to HCS treatment group. We also documented increased beta-catenin translocation and increased VEGF mRNA expression in all treatment groups. Thus, we conclude that the acute as well as chronic protection afforded by combination treatment with statin and resveratrol may be due to pro-angiogenic, anti-hyperlipidemic and anti-apoptotic effects and long-term effects may be caused by increased neo-vascularization of the MI zone leading to less ventricular remodeling.",

AS achieved much greater lipid lowering than PS. Serial oral glucose tolerance tests revealed new-onset diabetes was delayed by PS only. The untreated rats exhibited a progressive decrease in plasma adiponectin, increases in plasma leptin and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and reduction of plasma nitric oxide (NO), which were limited more by PS than AS. PS, but not AS, enhanced adiponectin mRNA expression in white adipose tissue at 30 weeks. Cardiac endothelial NO synthase expression was upregulated, and overexpression of both transforming growth factor-beta1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mRNA was limited more by PS than AS. Coronary perivascular fibrosis at 30 weeks was suppressed only by PS, which was accompanied by preserved left ventricular diastolic function assessed with Doppler echocardiography.",

Prednisolone, pulse methylprednisolone therapy, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis, CsA, cyclophosphamide and mizoribine (MZR) had proved to be ineffective. She was started on pravastatin for her hyperlipidaemia 6 and a half years from onset, in addition to the baseline therapy, which included CsA; remission of the nephrotic syndrome was unexpectedly attained after 10 months of treatment. The baseline therapy has not been changed since the inclusion of pravastatin. This case suggests that, in patients with hyperlipidaemia, the response to CsA could be restored by lowering cholesterol levels with statins. The decrease of cholesterol levels might have improved the pharmacokinetics of CsA in this patient. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory and immuno-modulatory effects, recently attributed to statins, may also have been involved in the improvement experienced by our patient.",

The purpose of our study was to evaluate the effects of atorvastatin on bone metabolism by means of measuring bone turnover markers in male patients with hypercholesterolemia both at diagnosis and prospectively after 3 months of treatment. Twenty-two Japanese male patients (mean age 62.36 +/- 10.1 years) with untreated hypercholesterolaemeia were selected for this study. After 3-months treatment of atorvastatin, total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly decreased as expected (p<0.001 for both parameters). Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) did not change significantly (p = 0.444). However, serum N-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (NTx) significantly decreased by -19.86 +/- 26.4% (p = 0.020). In addition, delta NTx during the course of this study was negatively correlated with NTx at baseline (r = -0.645, p = 0.0008). Although there was a tendency of positive correlations of delta NTx with delta total cholesterol, delta triglycerides, and delta low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and of negative correlations of delta NTx and delta BAP with delta high density lipoprotein cholesterol, none of them reached statistical significance. Our findings suggest that atorvastatin may have potentially beneficial effects on bone metabolism in patients with hypercholesterolemia mostly by reducing bone resorption rather than by stimulating bone formation. Further studies with more patients and longer duration are warranted to evaluate its effects, if any, on prevention of osteoporosis and subsequent fractures.",

These changes in lipid composition did not alter the association of decay accelerating factor or tissue factor with lipid rafts. Atorvastatin in combination with lipid restriction reduced factor VIIa/tissue factor activity by as much as 75% but did not alter tissue factor expression.

    "67": "MMP-9 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AIS and predicts haemorrhagic transformation of the ischaemic focus. The aim of our study was to analyse both serum MMP-9 and its most specific endogenous inhibitor (TIMP-1) levels in AIS and to check whether HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (simvastatin) affects the MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio value. Fifty patients with AIS were randomly divided into two groups: Group I (N = 25) treated with 40 mg/day with simvastatin within 24 hours after the onset of stroke and Group II (N = 25) non-treated with statin. To evaluate MMP-9 and TIMP-1 serum levels, the ELISA method was used. The serum MMP-9 level was significantly elevated on the 7th day of stroke in both groups (from 668 to 862 ng/ml and 670 to 855 ng/ml, respectively, in Group I and II). The serum TIMP-1 level was also elevated on the 7th day of stroke in both groups but the results were not significant. The MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio was elevated on the 7th day of stroke in both groups, but the result was significant only in the Group II (P < 0.01). These findings indicate that simvastatin given during 24 hours after the onset of stroke could have an influence on the MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio during AIS.", 
    "68": "1. The hepatic mechanisms involved in the simultaneous regulation of plasma cholesterol concentration and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity were investigated by sharply modifying the hepatic rates of cholesterol synthesis. This was accomplished by cholestyramine, lovastatin and cholesterol feeding in human CETP transgenic mice cross-bred with low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr)-knockout mice, generating CETP(+/-)/LDLr(+/-) mice, which present a plasma lipoprotein profile resembling that of humans. 2. Analyses of pooled data showed that the plasma CETP activity correlated positively with plasma total cholesterol concentration, hepatic CETP mRNA and the liver microsomal cholesterol content; a negative correlation was found between plasma CETP activity and the liver 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and LDLr mRNA levels. These coordinated events represent an efficient control system that stabilizes the cell cholesterol content. 3. Nonetheless, not all cholesterol metabolism regulatory systems seem to fit into a coherent pattern of responses, suggesting that other unknown cellular mechanisms play roles depending on the type of pharmacological intervention. 4. For example, microsomal cholesterol content was not affected by cholestyramine, but was increased on cholesterol feeding (as predicted), and, surprisingly, on lovastatin treatment. Furthermore, although both plasma cholesterol-lowering drugs increased CYP7A1 mRNA and had no effect on CYP27 mRNA, other metabolic components were differentially modified. Cholestyramine and lovastatin, respectively, did not modify and increased both HMG-CoA and sterol responsive element binding protein 1c mRNA, did not modify and lowered liver X receptor alpha mRNA, lowered and increased ATP binding cassette A1 mRNA and lowered and did not modify scavenger receptor B1 mRNA. 5. That is, different to unabsorbed cholestyramine, lovastatin, as an absorbed plasma cholesterol-lowering drug, may have modified the activity of other unknown genes that play roles in the interaction of CETP with the metabolism of hepatic cholesterol.", 
    "69": "1. Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (statins) manifest pleiotropic effects that may contribute to their therapeutic efficacy. However, the mechanism of the beneficial action of statins on cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis remains unclear. We have now investigated this action of pitavastatin in Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats. 2. The DS rats progressively develop marked hypertension when fed a diet containing 8% NaCl from 7 weeks of age. These animals exhibited pronounced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, as well as upregulation of fetal-type cardiac gene expression at 12 weeks of age, compared with DS rats fed a diet containing 0.3% NaCl. The abundance of mRNAs for collagen types I and III, angiotensin-converting enzyme, transforming growth factor-beta1 and connective tissue growth factor was also increased in the heart of rats on the high-salt diet. 3. Treatment of rats on the high-salt diet with a non-antihypertensive dose of pitavastatin (0.3 or 1 mg/kg per day) from 7 to 12 weeks of age attenuated the development of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, as well as inhibiting the upregulation of cardiac gene expression. Pitavastatin also blocked the translocation of RhoA to the membrane fraction of the left ventricle and RhoA activation, as well as the phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1 and ERK-2 and an increase in the DNA binding activity of serum response factor (SRF) in the heart induced by the high-salt diet. 4. These findings suggest that the effects of pitavastatin on load-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis are independent of its cholesterol-lowering action and may be mediated, at least in part, through inhibition of RhoA-ERK-SRF signalling.",

In order to systematically investigate these effects at a cellular level, we investigated gene expression in phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-activated and non-activated human THP-1 monocytes in response to statins using cDNA arrays. 3. Of 588 genes tested, 26 were differentially expressed in the presence of statins. A marked reduction was found for the chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha). The decrease in MIP-1alpha mRNA expression after incubation with statins was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in THP-1 monocytes and human freshly isolated monocytes. Macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha protein in THP-1 monocytes was reduced from 377 to 299 and 305 pg/mL by 0.1 micro mol/L simvastatin and 0.01 micro mol/L cerivastatin, respectively. The reduction in MIP-1alpha expression by statins was due, at least in part, to transcriptional inhibition of MIP-1alpha promoter activity. 4. The CC receptor ligand MIP-1alpha is a chemokine that has been implicated in atherosclerotic lesion formation. The present findings suggest that statin-mediated immunomodulation by inhibiting MIP-1alpha could contribute to the beneficial effects of statin therapy independent of lowering plasma cholesterol.",

HMG-CoA Reductase inhibitors (statins), which block hepatic synthesis of cholesterol, are the mainstay of therapy of hypercholesterolemia.

The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis identified several affected pathways (23 gene lists with False Discovery Rate q-value<0.1) in muscle following high dose simvastatin, including eicosanoid synthesis and Phospholipase C pathways. Using lipidomic analysis we identified previously uncharacterized drug-specific changes in the plasma lipid profile despite similar statin-induced changes in plasma LDL-cholesterol. We also found that the plasma lipidomic changes following simvastatin treatment correlate with the muscle expression of the arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein.",

Immunoregulatory activity by the anti-hypercholesterolemia agents, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, known as statins, has recently been reported. We analyzed the effects of three statins on human NK cell cytotoxicity. Two lipophilic statins (simvastatin and fluvastatin) suppressed the cytotoxic activity of fresh and IL-2-stimulated NK cells, while pravastatin, a hydrophilic statin, did not. Suppression was not associated with changes in intracellular perforin, granzyme A or granzyme B levels, or with changes in expression of leukocyte function-associated antigen-1, an integrin known to regulate NK activity and reported to be altered by statin treatment. Decreased cytotoxicity was associated with decreased CD107a surface expression, indicating that the exocytosis pathway was compromised by simvastatin and fluvastatin but not by pravastatin. Mevalonate, the immediate downstream product of HMG-CoA reductase, partially reversed the effect of lipophilic statins on cytotoxicity and CD107a expression. Lipophilic statins also suppressed the release of the granule component, granzyme B, by IL-2-activated NK cells following stimulation with K562. That lipophilic statins suppress NK cell activity through inhibition of the exocytosis pathway suggest an additional potential role for statins in inhibition of transplantation responses.",

    "89": "In this work different crystallization processes of sodium pravastatin are explored and a new polymorph is obtained. The analytical results of powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and thermal analysis for this new polymorph indicate that it is different from the polymorphs previously reported. This new crystal form shows different physical-chemical properties than the previous forms, such as crystallographic structure, thermal behavior, and melting point, 181.5 degrees C. Besides, all crystallization processes previously reported use an aprotic solvent as antisolvent. However, we propose a new crystallization process for sodium pravastatin that uses only protic solvents, overcoming industrial scaling and environmental problems. Variable-temperature PXRD experiments show a transformation between different crystal forms in the range of 80-120 degrees C. Solid-state 13C NMR, reported in this work for the first time, and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) studies of some polymorphs show some differences in intermolecular interactions, especially with carboxylate and hydroxyl groups. Quantum mechanical calculations of the pravastatin molecule are also presented for the first time, obtaining a molecular structure similar to the experimental structure existing within the crystal lattice of the tert-octylamonium salt of pravastatin.", 
    "90": "With increasing age of the population and improvement of diagnostic tools, the incidence of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) has been rising steadily. Despite an improvement in operative and interventional treatment options, AAA is the cause of death in 1-3% of men over 65 years of age in industrial countries, mostly due to rupture [1]. Therefore, routine screening for AAA by ultrasonography has been postulated in the past: a 60 year old man with an abdominal aortic diameter of less than 3 cm has a life-time risk of developing AAA close to zero. However, routine screening has not been found to be cost effective. Despite of the results of two well-designed studies, the limits of AAA qualifying the patient for surgery or intervention in contrast to conservative treatment is still a matter of debate. The present review article summarizes the current knowledge of the pathology, incidence, risks, natural course as well as symptoms and current treatment strategies of AAA on the basis of the recent literature.", 
    "91": "Statins are commonly used cholesterol-lowering drugs that have proapoptotic and antimetastatic activities that could affect cancer risk or progression. Results from previous epidemiologic studies of the association between statin use and cancer have been inconsistent. We investigated the association of statin use with total and advanced prostate cancer, the latter being the most important endpoint to prevent.", 
    "92": "We analyzed data from an ongoing prospective cohort study of 34,989 US male health professionals who were cancer free in 1990 and were followed to 2002. Participants reported their use of cholesterol-lowering drugs on biennial questionnaires. Prostate cancer diagnosis was confirmed by medical record review. Multivariable-adjusted relative risks (RRs) were estimated from Cox proportional hazards regression models. Statistical tests were two-sided.", 
    "93": "During 376,939 person-years of follow-up, we ascertained 2579 prostate cancer cases, 316 of which were advanced (regionally invasive, metastatic, or fatal). The age-standardized incidence rates of advanced prostate cancer were 38 and 89 per 100,000 person-years in current statin users and in past or never users, respectively. The multivariable-adjusted relative risk of advanced disease was 0.51 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.30 to 0.86) and of metastatic or fatal disease was 0.39 (95% CI = 0.19 to 0.77) for current statin use compared with no current use. The associations remained after adjusting for prostate-specific antigen screening history (advanced disease: RR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.30 to 1.11; metastatic or fatal disease: RR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.14 to 0.92). Risk of advanced disease was lower with longer statin use (P(trend) = .003); compared with never use, the relative risk for less than 5 years of use was 0.60 (95% CI = 0.35 to 1.03) and for 5 or more years of use was 0.26 (95% CI = 0.08 to 0.83). We found no association between statin use and risk of total prostate cancer (RR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.85 to 1.09).",

    "95": "We examined the change in the subcellular distribution of a lysosomal enzyme, beta-glucuronidase (beta-G), caused by decreased cholesterol levels in mouse melanoma cells using an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, lovastatin and lipoprotein-deficient serum (LDS). There was a decrease in the cholesterol content of the cells and increased secretion of the mature form of beta-G located in lysosomes, as documented by Percoll density gradient fractionation, digitonin permeabilization and immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, another lysosomal enzyme, cathepsin H, was found to be released in the medium from cells treated with lovastatin. Both the precursor and mature forms of cathepsin H were detected in the medium of treated cells. Next, when cells were treated with LDS without lovastatin, concomitantly with the decrease in the levels of cholesterol and beta-G activity in the cells, beta-G activity in the medium increased. Also, the ratio of beta-G (3.2-fold) released in the medium from cells treated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (D-MEM) containing lovastatin and LDS was higher than that (2.3-fold) on treatment with D-MEM containing LDS without lovastatin. From these results, it was suggested that the exocytosis of mature enzymes from lysosomes into the medium or mis-sorting of the lysosomal precursor forms to the medium was caused by the lovastatin- and/or LDS-induced decrease in the cholesterol content of the cells, although the mechanism of secretion by lysosomal enzymes differed somewhat.", 
    "96": "Lovastatin promotes osteoblast differentiation by increasing bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) expression. We demonstrate that lovastatin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), leading to an increase in its kinase activity in osteoblast cells. Inhibition of PI3K ameliorated expression of the osteogenic markers alkaline phosphatase, type I collagen, osteopontin, and BMP-2. Expression of dominant-negative PI3K and PTEN, an inhibitor of PI3K signaling, significantly attenuated lovastatin-induced transcription of BMP-2. Akt kinase was also activated in a PI3K-dependent manner. However, our data suggest involvement of an additional signaling pathway. Lovastatin-induced Erk1/2 activity contributed to BMP-2 transcription. Inhibition of PI3K abrogated Erk1/2 activity in response to lovastatin, indicating the presence of a signal relay between them. We provide, as a mechanism of this cross-talk, the first evidence that lovastatin stimulates rapid activation of Ras, which associates with and activates PI3K in the plasma membrane, which in turn regulates Akt and Erk1/2 to induce BMP-2 expression for osteoblast differentiation.", 
    "97": "Although most randomized trials and meta-analyses suggest a slight or no increase in the risk of cancer in statin users, results from observational studies have been conflicting, and some have even suggested a large protective effect of statins on certain cancers. Long-term statin users tend to be healthier, less frail, and more adherent to therapy than nonusers, however. This could explain such apparent \"protective\" effects.", 
    "98": "We conducted the present cohort study by linking data from a large state drug benefit program with cancer registry data and Medicare healthcare utilization data. We identified all initiators of statins; initiators of glaucoma medications, another preventive drug, served as a comparison group. Outcomes included all registry-identified cases of colorectal, lung, and breast cancer. Multivariable Cox proportional models were used to adjust for confounding. Patient characteristics were similar in both groups, but statin initiators (n=24,439) were slightly younger and used some services more frequently than glaucoma drug initiators (n=7284). The mean follow-up was 2.9 years, with the longest follow-up being 8.4 years. Incidence rates of colorectal, lung, and breast cancers in both groups were very similar to rates in the general population. Adjusted hazard ratios were 0.96 (95% CI, 0.70 to 1.31) for colorectal cancer, 1.11 (95% CI, 0.77 to 1.60) for lung cancer, and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.74 to 1.33) for breast cancer.",

    "100": "The monkey is often used to predict metabolism of drugs in humans since it generally shows a metabolic pattern similar to humans. However, metabolic profiles different from humans are occasionally seen in monkeys for some drugs including pitavastatin. Recently, we have successfully identified a monkey-specific cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C76, which possibly accounts for a species difference between monkeys and humans because of its sequence and functional uniqueness. The present study on the role of CYP2C76 and other monkey CYP2Cs in pitavastatin metabolism, as an example, has revealed that CYP2C76 is important for the metabolism of the lactone form, indicating a major role of CYP2C76 for the difference in the metabolism of pitavastatin and possibly other drugs between monkeys and humans. The current investigation on the involvement of CYP2C76 in the metabolism of other drugs is expected to reveal further the further importance of this monkey-specific drug-metabolizing enzyme.", 
    "101": "Current therapies for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other autoimmune diseases non-specifically suppress immune function, and there is great need for fundamental approaches such as antigen-specific tolerizing therapy. In this paper we describe development of antigen-specific tolerizing DNA vaccines to treat collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice, and use of protein microarrays to monitor response to therapy and to identify potential additional autoimmune targets for next generation vaccines. We demonstrate that tolerizing DNA vaccines encoding type II collagen (CII) reduced the incidence and severity of CIA. Atorvastatin, a statin drug found to reduce the severity of autoimmunity, potentiated the effect of DNA vaccines encoding CII. Analysis of cytokines produced by collagen-reactive T cells derived from mice receiving tolerizing DNA encoding CII, as compared to control vaccines, revealed reduced production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. Arthritis microarray analysis demonstrated reduced spreading of autoantibody responses in mice treated with DNA encoding CII. The development of tolerizing DNA vaccines, and the use of antibody profiling to guide design of and to monitor therapeutic responses to such vaccines, represents a promising approach for the treatment of RA and other autoimmune diseases.", 
    "102": "Statins, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors exert pleiotropic anti-inflammatory properties in vitro and in vivo, and are associated with the risk reduction of colorectal cancer. It remains unknown, however, whether statin is effective for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Therefore, we investigated anti-inflammatory effects of simvastatin on intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) and on an experimental murine colitis model, and elucidated its molecular mechanisms. Simvastatin (50 micro M) significantly inhibited TNF-alpha-induced IL-8 gene expression in COLO 205 cells. Simvastatin (50 micro M) blocked TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB transcriptional activity, IkappaB phosphorylation/degradation and DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB. Administration of simvastatin significantly reduced the severity of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced murine colitis as assessed by body weight, colon length, DAI, and histology in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that simvastatin inhibits proinflammatory gene expression by blocking NF-kappaB signaling in IEC, and attenuates DSS-induced acute murine colitis. Simvastatin could be a potential agent for the treatment of IBD.", 
    "103": "Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (NBPs) are powerful anti-bone-resorptive drugs, but they frequently induce various inflammatory side effects. Recent clinical applications have disclosed an unexpected new side effect, jaw-bone necrosis and exposure. In vitro studies suggest that the inflammatory effects of NBPs are due to Vgamma2Vdelta2 T-cells, stimulated directly and/or indirectly [the latter via isopentenylpyrophosphate (IPP) in the mevalonate pathway]. Rats and mice, however, lack Vgamma2Vdelta2 T-cells, yet NBPs still induce necrotic and inflammatory reactions. In mice, NBPs induce IL-1-dependent inflammatory reactions, such as inductions of histidine decarboxylase (HDC, the histamine-forming enzyme) in the liver, lung, spleen, and bone marrow, an increase in granulocytic cells in the peritoneal cavity, pleural exudation, and splenomegaly. Here, we examined the involvement of IPP, TNF, macrophages, and T-cells in the inflammatory actions of alendronate (a typical NBP) in mice. Various statins (mevalonate-synthesis inhibitors) suppressed the alendronate-induced HDC inductions, while mevalonate itself augmented such inductions. IPP injection also induced HDC. Like IL-1-deficient mice, TNF-deficient mice were resistant to alendronate-stimulated HDC induction. Alendronate-stimulated HDC inductions were significantly weaker in macrophage-depleted mice and in nude mice than in control mice. Similar, though generally less clear-cut, results were obtained when other alendronate-induced inflammatory reactions were examined. These results suggest that (i) inhibition of the mevalonate pathway causes and/or modifies at least some inflammatory actions of alendronate in mice, (ii) in addition to IL-1, TNF is also involved in the inflammatory actions of alendronate, and (iii) alendronate may act on a variety of cells, including macrophages and T-cells.", 
    "104": "The cardiac effects of statins are subject to controversial discussion, and the mechanism of their uptake into the human heart is unknown. A candidate protein is the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 2B1 (SLCO2B1), because related transporters are involved in the uptake of statins into the human liver. In this study we examine OATP2B1 expression in the human heart and describe statins as inhibitors and substrates of OATP2B1.",

    "106": "Significant messenger ribonucleic acid expression was found in all samples, with no difference in the diseased hearts. However, patients who had taken atorvastatin exhibit decreased OATP2B1 messenger ribonucleic acid expression compared with patients with no statin treatment. OATP2B1 protein was detected at approximately 85 kd in atrial samples, as well as ventricular samples, and could be localized to the vascular endothelium. Furthermore, estrone-3-sulfate transport into OATP2B1-overexpressing Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells was inhibited by various drugs, including atorvastatin, simvastatin, cerivastatin, glyburide (INN, glibenclamide), and gemfibrozil, with the most pronounced effect being found for atorvastatin (inhibition constant, 0.7 +/- 0.4 micromol/L). Whereas simvastatin (lactone) itself was not transported by OATP2B1, atorvastatin was identified as a high-affinity substrate for OATP2B1 (Michaelis-Menten constant, 0.2 micromol/L) by direct transport measurement via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.",

    "108": "Lipid-lowering drugs, especially 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A inhibitors (statins), are widely used in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerotic disease. The benefits of statins are well documented. However, lipid-lowering drugs may cause myopathy, even rhabdomyolysis, the risk of which is increased by certain interactions. Simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 (simvastatin acid is also metabolized by CYP2C8); their plasma concentrations and risk of myotoxicity are greatly increased by strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (eg, itraconazole and ritonavir). Weak or moderately potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg, verapamil and diltiazem) can be used cautiously with small doses of CYP3A4-dependent statins. Cerivastatin is metabolized by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, and fluvastatin is metabolized by CYP2C9. The exposure to fluvastatin is increased by less than 2-fold by inhibitors of CYP2C9. Pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and pitavastatin are excreted mainly unchanged, and their plasma concentrations are not significantly increased by pure CYP3A4 inhibitors. Cyclosporine (INN, ciclosporin) inhibits CYP3A4, P-glycoprotein (multidrug resistance protein 1), organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), and some other hepatic uptake transporters. Gemfibrozil and its glucuronide inhibit CYP2C8 and OATP1B1. These effects of cyclosporine and gemfibrozil explain the increased plasma statin concentrations and, together with pharmacodynamic factors, the increased risk of myotoxicity when coadministered with statins. Inhibitors of OATP1B1 may decrease the benefit/risk ratio of statins by interfering with their entry into hepatocytes, the site of action. Lipid-lowering drugs can be involved also in other interactions, including those between enzyme inducers and CYP3A4 substrate statins, as well as those between gemfibrozil and CYP2C8 substrate antidiabetics. Knowledge of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of lipid-lowering drugs and their interaction mechanisms helps to avoid adverse interactions, without compromising therapeutic benefits.", 
    "109": "The association between statin use and fracture risk is controversial, due to conflicting findings from previous studies. This study utilized the Bayesian approach to combine existing evidence and update the association with consideration of potential bias.",

    "111": "Empirical Bayesian analysis showed that statin use was associated with a reduction in hip fracture risk (OR=0.57, 95% credible interval (CrI): 0.46-0.71) and for non-vertebral (OR=0.69, 95% CrI, 0.63-0.74). These results were comparable with results from the fully Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis only for hip fracture (OR 0.56, 95% CrI, 0.42-0.73), but not for non-vertebral fracture (OR 0.77, 95% CrI, 0.58-1.03). The probability that statin use reduces fracture risk by at least 20% was 0.995 for hip fracture and 0.61 for non-vertebral fracture. Under the assumption that bias over-estimates the true OR by 20%, there is still a probability of 0.97 that statin use reduces hip fracture risk by at least 20%; however, the effect on non-vertebral fracture was much less robust with a probability of 0.27.", 
    "112": "Results of this Bayesian consideration are highly consistent with the hypothesis that statin use reduces hip fracture, but the association between statin use and non-vertebral fracture remains uncertain.

    "113": "Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a product generated during oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and a major lipid extracted from human atherosclerotic plaques, has been shown to elicit smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and inflammation, thereby being involved in atherogenesis. Recently, statins, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, have been reported to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and slows the progression of atherosclerosis, at least partly, via pleiotropic effects. However, the effect of statin on the LPA-signaling in SMCs remains to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated whether and how pitavastatin could inhibit the LPA-induced proliferation and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expression in cultured human aortic SMCs. LPA dose-dependently increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in SMCs, which was blocked by diphenylene iodonium (DPI), an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase or pitavastatin. The anti-oxidative property of pitavastatin was prevented by simultaneous treatment of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Furthermore, overexpression of dominant negative Rac-1 mutant was found to inhibit the LPA-induced ROS generation in SMCs. LPA induced Rac-1 activation in SMCs, which was suppressed by pitavastatin or LPA receptor antagonist. Pitavastatin, DPI, and an anti-oxidant N-acetylcysteine inhibited the LPA-induced proliferation and MCP-1 gene expression in SMCs. These results suggest that pitavastatin could block the LPA-induced proliferation and MCP-1 expression in SMCs by suppressing Rac-1-mediated NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS generation. Our present study provides a novel beneficial aspect of pitavastatin; pitavastatin may act as a blocker of the LPA-signaling in SMCs.", 
    "114": "The apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon2 allele has been associated with both Parkinson's disease (PD) and lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). We tested the hypothesis that lower LDL-C may be associated with PD. This case-control study used fasting lipid profiles obtained from 124 PD cases and 112 controls. The PD cases were recruited from consecutive cases presenting at our tertiary Movement Disorder Clinic, and the controls were recruited from the spouse populations of the same clinic. Multivariate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated from unconditional logistic regressions, adjusting for age, gender, smoking status, and use of cholesterol-lowering agents. Lower LDL-C concentrations were associated with a higher occurrence of PD. Compared with participants with the highest LDL-C (> or =138 mg/dL), the OR was 2.2 (95% CI = 0.9-5.1) for participants with LDL-C of 115 to 137, 3.5 (95% CI = 1.6-8.1) for LDL-C of 93 to 114, and 2.6 (95% CI = 1.1-5.9) for LDL-C of < or = 92. Interestingly, use of either cholesterol-lowering drugs, or statins alone, was related to lower PD occurrence. Thus, our data provide preliminary evidence that low LDL-C may be associated with higher occurrence of PD, and/or that statin use may lower PD occurrence, either of which finding warrants further investigation.", 
    "115": "The role of drug transporters in pravastatin disposition is underlined by the fact that pravastatin does not undergo significant cytochrome P-450 (CYP)-mediated biotransformation. The organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), encoded by SLCO1B1, and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 [MRP2 (ABCC2)], are thought to be the major transporters involved in the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin in humans. Other transporters that may play a role include OATP2B1, organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3), bile salt export pump (BSEP), and the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). OATP1B1 and MRP2 mediate the hepatic uptake and biliary excretion of pravastatin, respectively. The SLCO1B1 and ABCC2 polymorphisms probably contribute to the high interindividual variability in pravastatin disposition. Recent small studies have characterized the impact of the SLCO1B1 polymorphism on pravastatin in humans, and especially the c.521T>C single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) seems to be an important determinant of pravastatin pharmacokinetics. Pravastatin plasma concentrations may be up to 100% higher in subjects carrying the c.521C variant, as found in the *5, *15, *16, and *17 haplotypes, reflecting diminished OATP1B1-mediated uptake into the major site of pravastatin elimination, the liver. The SLCO1B1 polymorphism seems to have a similar impact on the pharmacokinetics of single- and multiple-dose pravastatin. Overall, 2-5% of individuals in various populations may be expected to show markedly elevated plasma pravastatin concentrations due to the SLCO1B1 polymorphism. Of note, the impact of the SLCO1B1 polymorphism on statins may be dependent on ethnicity. Although individuals with a diminished hepatic uptake of pravastatin might be expected to show reduced cholesterol-lowering efficacy due to lower intracellular pravastatin concentrations, there is preliminary evidence to suggest that the SLCO1B1 polymorphism is not a major determinant of non-response to pravastatin. The possible consequences of drug transporter polymorphisms, especially the SLCO1B1 and ABCC2 polymorphisms, for the lipid-lowering efficacy and tolerability of pravastatin in various ethnic groups warrant further study.", 
    "116": "Optimal treatment for patients with chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) is not known. Early intervention is preferred. We examined the benefit of adding sirolimus (SRL; C(0) 5-12 ng/mL: HPLC) on the rate of progression of early CAN. We identified patients with biopsy-confirmed Banff grade 1 CAN. After biopsy, patients were switched to SRL + CsA + prednisolone (SRL), MMF + CsA + prednisolone (MMF), or CsA + AZA + prednisolone (AZA). GFR was estimated by Cockcroft-Gault and MDRD formulae. The rate of GFR decline (delta GFR) was determined by calculating the slope of the regression line of estimated GFR (MDRD and Cockcroft-Gault method) at different times. Statistical analysis was performed by the Wilcoxon test. The 41 patients with CAN grade 1 were assigned to SRL: MMF: AZA = 12: 20: 9.

Follow-up time for SRL: MMF: AZA was 19 +/- 4: 35 +/- 32: 59 +/- 54 months. At last follow-up; GFR (MDRD method) for SRL: MMF: AZA were 39 +/- 13: 35 +/- 21: 40 +/- 24 mL/min; GFR (C-G method) 46 +/- 17, 37 +/- 18, 46 +/- 25 mL/min; BP 128 +/- 11/79 +/- 7: 131 +/- 22/80 +/- 14: 132 +/- 20/82 +/- 11 mm Hg; and CsA level 52 +/- 25: 122 +/- 41: 155 +/- 49. After biopsy, statin was prescribed in nine SRL, 10 MMF, and three AZA. ACEI was prescribed in two SRL, three MMF, and two AZA. Compared with the prebiopsy values, the delta GFR (MDRD method) changed to -0.04 +/- 0.31 (SRL; P = .04), -0.17 +/- 0.40 (MMF; P = .60), and -0.97 +/- 1.52 (AZA: P = .16). Delta GFR (C-G method) was also significantly improved in the SRL group (-0.02 +/- 0.47; P = .05) but not in the MMF (-0.13 +/- 0.51; P = .53) or AZA (-0.54 +/- 1.78; P = .44). We concluded that patients with early CAN who are switched to SRL and low-dose CsA have a significant attenuation of the rate of GFR declination when compared with patients who receive MMF or AZA addition.", 
    "117": "Statins, the most widely prescribed medications in patients with hyperlipidemia and coronary heart disease, have a number of pleiotropic actions beyond cholesterol lowering. They improve endothelial function, they have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, they regulate neovascularization and have immunomodulatory activities. Experimental evidence suggests that statins may be beneficial in heart failure as they can inhibit myocardial hypertrophy, reduce cardiomyocyte loss by apoptosis, reduce oxidative stress and restore neurohormonal imbalance. Furthermore small randomised clinical trials showed that short term statin administration may improve key pathophysiological aspects of this syndrome. Finally retrospective analyses of large statin trials imply a long term profit on clinical outcome in this group of patients. These results however need to be reviewed with caution as certain studies have demonstrated that low serum cholesterol is associated with worse prognosis in HF and that ubiquinone levels, a micronutrient with antioxidant actions, reduces significantly following statin administration. Large prospective randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm the beneficial effect of statins on cardiovascular outcome in HF patients and further elucidate the contributing mechanisms. Finally the statin dose and the interaction with co-administered drugs need to be studied.",

Endothelial cells (ECs) synthesize and secrete PAI-1, but the intracellular signaling pathways that regulate PAI-1 expression are not entirely known. We hypothesize that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase Akt pathway, which regulates endothelial function, could modulate PAI-1 expression in ECs. Cultured bovine aortic and human saphenous vein ECs were stimulated with TNF-alpha, ANG II, insulin, or serum, and PAI-1 expression was determined by Northern and Western analyses. Inhibition of PI3K with wortmannin or LY-294002 enhanced PAI-1 expression induced by these extracellular stimuli. Similarly, overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of PI3K or Akt increased TNF-alpha- and insulin-induced PAI-1 expression. The increase in PAI-1 was due to transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms as PI3K inhibitors increased PAI-1 promoter activity and mRNA stability. The induction of PAI-1 by TNF-alpha and insulin is mediated, in part, by ERK and p38 MAPK. PI3K inhibitors augmented TNF-alpha- and insulin-induced phosphorylation of these MAPKs. Simvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor, which is known to activate PI3K/Akt, blocks TNF-alpha- and insulin-induced PAI-1 expression. Treatment with PI3K inhibitors reversed the inhibitor effects of simvastatin on TNF-alpha- and insulin-induced PAI-1 expression. These findings indicate that the PI3K/Akt pathway acts as a negative regulator of PAI-1 expression in ECs, in part, through the downregulation of MAPK pathways. These results suggest that factors that activate the PI3K/Akt pathway in ECs may have therapeutic benefits for atherothrombotic vascular disease.",

Olmesartan prevented vascular eNOS dimer disruption or the downregulation of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) more than pravastatin, whereas Akt phosphorylation was enhanced by pravastatin but not olmesartan, indicating differential pleiotropic effects between olmesartan and pravastatin.

Whereas strong CCR7 expression was seen in T-cells from murine and human atherosclerotic plaques, circulating T-cells from angina patients showed decreased CCR7 expression. CCL19 and CCL21 promoted an inflammatory phenotype in T-cells and macrophages and increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and tissue factor levels in the latter cell type.

We also used hippocampal cultures from Niemann-Pick type C1-deficient mice defective in intracellular cholesterol trafficking. These conditions revealed an augmentation in spontaneous neurotransmission detected electrically and an increase in spontaneous vesicle endocytosis judged by horseradish peroxidase uptake after cholesterol depletion by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin. In contrast, responses evoked by action potentials and hypertonicity were severely impaired after the same treatments. The increase in spontaneous vesicle recycling and the decrease in evoked neurotransmission were reversible upon cholesterol addition. Cholesterol removal did not impact on the low level of evoked neurotransmission seen in the absence of synaptic vesicle SNARE protein synaptobrevin-2 whereas the increase in spontaneous fusion remained. These results suggest that synaptic cholesterol balances evoked and spontaneous neurotransmission by hindering spontaneous synaptic vesicle turnover and sustaining evoked exo-endocytosis.",

Evaluation of endothelial function seems to have a predictive role in humans, and therapeutic interventions improving nitric oxide bioavailability in the vasculature may improve the long-term outcome in healthy individuals, high-risk subjects, or patients with advanced atherosclerosis. Several therapeutic strategies are now available, targeting both the synthesis and oxidative inactivation of nitric oxide (NO) in human vasculature. Statins seem to be currently the most powerful category of these agents, improving endothelial function and decreasing cardiovascular risk after long-term administration. Other cardiovascular agents improving endothelial function in humans are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptors blockers, which increase NO bioavailability by modifying the rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Newer therapeutic approaches targeting endothelial dysfunction in specific disease states include insulin sensitizers, L-arginine (the substrate for endothelial NO synthase [eNOS]) as well as substances that target eNOS \"coupling,\" such as folates or tetrahydrobiopterin.

Of concern, nonsignificant increases in coronary and sudden deaths, thrombotic events, and pancreatitis occurred in the fenofibrate group. The PROspective pioglitAzone Clinical Trial In macroVascular Events (PROACTIVE) also found a reduction in coronary and stroke events with pioglitazone compared with placebo in a population with diabetes and cardiovascular disease, but this benefit was counterbalanced by an increase in congestive heart failure as well as symptomatic edema.

Several large clinical trials have demonstrated that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) decrease cardiovascular events. The beneficial effects of statins may extend to mechanisms beyond cholesterol reduction. Evidence for the pleiotropic effects of statins is provided by recent clinical trials in which the benefit of statin drugs is manifest early in the course of lipid-lowering therapy, well before plaque regression could occur. Inflammation is pivotal in all stages of atherosclerosis, and C-reactive protein (CRP), the prototypic marker of inflammation, has emerged as a cardiovascular risk marker. Statins reduce CRP levels, and this reduction in most studies does not correlate to reduction in cholesterol. In addition, statins have beneficial effects on endothelial function, monocyte-macrophages, and platelets. In this review we discuss the role of inflammation in atherosclerosis, the role of CRP as a risk marker, the clinical evidence implicating the anti-inflammatory effects of statins, and the cellular and molecular basis underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of statins.", 
    "173": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) creates one of the highest-risk atherosclerotic states that can occur in human beings. The use of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) has gained widespread acceptance in the general population for the purposes of lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and reducing the future risks of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiac death. In patients with CKD, these benefits are believed to be enjoyed to the same or greater degrees. Reductions in LDL-C with statins may be associated with a reduced progression of CKD. Importantly, recent studies suggest statins are associated with a reduction in rates of acute renal failure after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery and exposure to iodinated contrast. In patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), recent data suggest that the annual rate of coronary artery calcification can be attenuated or reduced with LDL-C reduction. However, two large trials demonstrating LDL-C reduction with statins and with these drugs have failed to demonstrate a reduction in cardiovascular events in ESRD. Thus, the potential benefits of statins and LDL-C reduction in CKD have to be considered in light of evidence suggesting a reduced benefit if any, in patients with ESRD. In addition, studies suggest that there are higher adverse drug effects with statins in CKD.", 
    "174": "Hyperlipidemia is a well-known risk factor for atherosclerosis. Several trials have demonstrated the importance of lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels to reduce all-cause mortality, coronary ischemia, and cerebrovascular accidents. Although the optimal goal for LDL-C levels in patients with known coronary heart disease has been less than 100 mg/dL, more recent findings support achieving even lower LDL-C levels for very high-risk patients. As the target levels for LDL-C trend towards lower values, it is important to evaluate the status for optimal management with statin therapy. In this review article, we discuss the role of percent LDL-C reduction versus attained LDL-C levels as targets for statin therapy in order to maximize the preventive care provided to high-risk patients."
