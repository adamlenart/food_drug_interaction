This study examined the use of the CETP inhibitor JTT-705 combined with pravastatin. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 155 patients with type II dyslipidemia using pravastatin 40 mg were treated with placebo or JTT-705 300 or 600 mg. Four weeks of treatment with JTT-705 600 mg led to a 30% decrease in CETP activity (p <0.001), a 28% increase in HDL cholesterol (p <0.001), and a 5% decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p <0.03). Combination therapy using JTT-705 and pravastatin effectively increases HDL cholesterol levels and is safe and well tolerated up to 4 weeks of administration.", 
    "1": "The effects of atorvastatin (40 mg/day) versus placebo on fasting and postprandial plasma levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) were examined over 36 weeks in 84 patients who had coronary heart disease and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels >130 mg/dl and compared directly with the effects of fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin. Results were also compared with those obtained in age- and gender-matched control subjects (n = 84). Feeding increased median hs-CRP levels by 2% in patients (p = NS) and 22% in controls (p <0.01) and increased mean Lp-PLA2 values by 9% in patients (p = NS) but decreased values by 21% in controls (p <0.0001). Patients had 51% higher median hs-CRP values and 29% higher mean Lp-PLA2 values than did controls (p <0.05 for hs-CRP and Lp-PLA2) in the fasting state; however, Lp-PLA2 values were 62% higher (p <0.0001) in the fed state in patients compared with controls. Atorvastatin decreased median hs-CRP levels by 32% (p <0.01) and mean Lp-PLA2 values by 26% in patients (p <0.0001), with similar decreases in the fed state, and none of the other statins had any significant effect on these parameters. Change in Lp-PLA2 was significantly related to change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p <0.01), with no significant relations with change in hs-CRP. Our data indicate greater differences in patients with coronary heart disease compared with controls in Lp-PLA2 in the fed state than in the fasting state and that atorvastatin is more effective than fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, or simvastatin for decreasing not only low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but also hs-CRP and Lp-PLA2.",

After pravastatin treatment, the activity of proMMP-2 and MMP-2, decreased significantly (number = 8, P < 0.01). MMP-2 secretion was completely suppressed after 1.0 micromol/ml pravastatin treatment. Reverse zymography revealed that, compared to the single culture HUVECs or THP-1, the secretion of TIMP-2 decreased in the co-cultured system, regardless of the ratio of mixture.

    "17": "There is a dichotomy in the biosynthetic pathway of terpenoid precursor isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) in higher plant. One is the classical mevalonate pathway in cytosol, and the other is non-mevalonate pathway in plastid. To know the origin of the taxane ring system of taxol in suspension culture of Taxus chinensis, lovastatin and fosmidomycin were used to block the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reducto-isomerase (DXR) in the mevalonate and non-mevalonate branch respectively of the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway. Methyl jasmonate (MJ) was used to improve the biosynthesis of taxol. Taxol content was determined by HPLC, the transcriptional expression of genes encoding DXR and HMGR were investigated by real time PCR. Taxol production was lowered by about 2/5 and 1/5 by fosmidomycin (200 mmol/L) and fosmidomycin (200 mmol/L)+MJ (100 mmol/L) treatment respectively, and was lowered by about 1/6 and 1/10 by lovastatin (1 mmol/L) and lovastatin (1 mmol/L) + MJ (100 mmol/L) respectively, which means that both mevalonate and non-mevalonate pathway contribute to taxol biosynthesis, and the latter is the main source of IPP. Inhibitors lovastatin and fosmidomycin both promoted the transcriptional expression of hmgr and dxr, which indicated a metabolic cross talk between cytosolic and plastidial pathways of taxol biosynthesis.",

(2) The serum levels of hs-CRP and TNFalpha significantly lowered after one week of therapy in the two fluvastatin treated groups (P < 0.01 in all), especially in the 80 mg fluvastatin group, while no significant difference was observed before and after treatment in the routine therapy group. (3) The serum levels of hs-CRP and TNFalpha had a significant positive correlation in the patients with ACS (r = 0.70, P < 0.01), but no relationship were observed between TC, TG, LDL-C, or HDL-C and hs-CRP or TNFalpha by Pearson correlation analysis.", 
    "21": "The serum levels of inflammatory factors including CRP and TNFalpha are increased in patients with ACS and early fluvastatin intervention may decease dose-dependently the serum levels of hs-CRP and TNFalpha. The anti-inflammatory effect of fluvastatin may be beyond that of lipid lowering. Early intensive fluvastatin treatment may yield more significant benefits in the patients with ACS.", 
    "22": "Recent studies suggest that postnatal neovascularization relies not exclusively on sprouting of preexisting vessels (\"angiogenesis\"), but also involves the contribution of bone marrow-derived circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). EPCs can be isolated from peripheral blood or bone marrow mononuclear cells, CD34(+) or CD133(+) hematopoietic progenitors. Infusion of EPCs was shown to promote postnatal neovascularization of ischemic tissue after myocardial infarction in animal models and initial clinical trials. Moreover, circulating endothelial precursor cells can home to denuded arteries after balloon injury and contribute to endothelial regeneration, thereby limiting the development of restenosis. Thus, circulating endothelial cells may exert an important function as endogenous repair mechanism to maintain the integrity of the endothelial monolayer and to promote ischemia-induced neovascularization. However, risk factors for coronary artery disease, such as diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension are associated with impaired number and function of EPC in patients with coronary artery disease. Therapeutically, the reduction of EPC number and the decreased functional activity in patients with coronary artery disease was counteracted by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzymeA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), estrogen, or exercise. At the molecular level, these factors are well established to activate the phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt-dependent activation of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), suggesting that the PI3K-Akt-eNOS signaling pathway may be involved in the transduction of atheroprotective factors. Taken together, the balance of atheroprotective and proatherosclerotic factors may influence EPC levels and their functional capacity to improve neovascularization and endothelial regeneration.", 
    "23": "Endothelin blocking drugs have vasodilator effects mediated at least in part via the nitric oxide system. Hypercholesterolaemia is associated with vascular dysfunction manifest as impaired nitric oxide-mediated vasodilatation and arterial stiffness. Treatment with HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) has proven mortality benefits in a range of patient populations. Subjects (n = 5) received either placebo or 800 mug cerivastatin for an 8-week period in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Cerivastatin reduced the total plasma cholesterol compared with baseline by 27% (5.4 +/- 0.4 mmol/L versus 7.3 +/- 0.4 mmol/L, P = 0.04). Selective endothelin-A receptor blockade caused an increase in forearm blood flow (FBF) (18.0 +/- 7.2%, P = 0.04). Compared with placebo, cerivastatin therapy caused a trend towards a further increase in FBF (18.0 +/- 7.2% versus 52.0 +/- 19.0%, P = 0.06). Selective endothelin-B receptor blockade reduced FBF (-11.0 +/- 3.9%, P = 0.02) with no difference between placebo and cerivastatin therapy (-11.0 +/- 3.9% versus -13.0 +/- 3.6%, P = 0.9). Combined endothelin-A/endothelin-B receptor blockade increased FBF (39.8 +/- 13.4%, P < 0.01) with no difference between placebo and cerivastatin therapy (39.8 +/- 13.4% versus 42.4 +/- 19.0%, P = 0.7). There was a trend towards a reduction in the augmentation index between cerivastatin and placebo (6.2 +/- 2.7 versus 9.1 +/- 2.4, n = 5, P = 0.4) compared with baseline (7.2 +/- 1.0). In conclusion, statin therapy may decrease large artery stiffness and increase the vasodilating effects of endothelin-A receptor blockade.", 
    "24": "To summarise recent evidence for elevated risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and explore explanatory mechanisms and modalities that may lessen such risk.", 
    "25": "Evidence for elevated CHD risk in RA is convincing. On current estimates, individuals who have had RA for several years have around a twofold higher risk for CHD compared with non-RA persons after taking account of most traditional risk factors. Such excess risk appears to be driven by systemic inflammation both directly via its deleterious effects on blood vessels (endothelial dysfunction inclusive of myocardial microvascular abnormalities) and indirectly by its accentuation of multiple risk pathways including lipid abnormalities. Established therapies that lessen RA disease activity and systemic inflammation will likely lessen CHD risk, although there remains considerable scope for more robust studies employing better measures of vascular disease (e.g., carotid intima-media thickening). Other emerging evidence indicates statins may have dual effects in RA, with a modest disease-modifying effect (requiring confirmation) and significant lipid-lowering action. The latter finding is particularly important because extrapolation of data from all statin endpoint trials suggests that the extent of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction may account for most statin clinical benefit.", 
    "26": "Systemic inflammation is the major driver for excess vascular comorbidity in RA. Controlling systemic inflammation should lessen vascular risk but complete, long-term suppression of articular inflammation is rarely achieved. Thus, the use of conventional CHD risk reduction strategies, in particular statins, should be considered in patients with RA with prevalent CHD or at elevated risk.",

Several reports have also provided much-needed insight into the deleterious impact that select therapies (including cyclo-oxygenase-2-specific inhibitors) may have in terms of the risk of cardiovascular disease in rheumatoid arthritis. Although further study is warranted, preliminary investigations also suggest that aggressive anti-inflammatory therapy, including the adjunctive use of statins, may play important cardioprotective roles in rheumatoid arthritis.", 
    "29": "The pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in rheumatoid arthritis is complex and involves several intermediate factors, including dyslipidemia, elevations in serum homocysteine, impaired insulin sensitivity, and endothelial dysfunction. Given the burden of cardiovascular disease in this population, it is important that health care providers caring for rheumatoid arthritis patients adopt a treatment course that is both comprehensive and individualized to address specific risk factors for cardiovascular disease.",

However, after one or two weeks of treatment, no protection was observed (52.6 +/- 3.8% vs. 58.6 +/- 4.3%; 58.3 +/- 2.7% vs. 52.4 +/- 5.7%, respectively). Surprisingly, a supplementary dose of atorvastatin recaptured the protection in the groups treated chronically (36.2 +/- 2.8% vs. 58.6 +/- 4.3%; 26.8 +/- 1.5% vs. 51.2 +/- 6.7%, at one and two weeks, respectively). Interestingly, we observed an increased level of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN), the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase inhibitor, in the chronic treated hearts.",

Treatment with statins reduced the over-expression of Cx43 and Cx40 in atherosclerotic lesion. Cx40 and Cx43 gap junction quantity from each of the arteries obtained at the different drug treatment levels revealed no significant difference. Neointimal SMCs had abundant, large gap junctions, whereas normal SMCs had smaller, less frequent junctions. Statins also normalized the enlarged gap junctions.",

Because there are hints for an increase of cholesterol absorption during statin therapy, the combination of Ezetimibe with a statin seems to be appropriate. This dual approach -- inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption and hepatic cholesterol synthesis -- offers a very potent reduction of cholesterol. The combination of statins with Ezetimibe leads to a further reduction of LDL-cholesterol up to 12-21%. The dual inhibition causes a more effective reduction of LDL-cholesterol than a statin monotherapy. LDL treatment goals can be reached more easily, and possible side effects of otherwise necessary high doses of statins can be avoided. Clinical endpoint studies with Ezetimibe are underway.",

This method offers important advantages over those previously reported because no radiolabeled substrates or expensive techniques such as mass spectrometry are required, and the time of analysis is relatively short. Moreover, the method can be successfully applied to different biological samples; hence, it should be very useful in evaluating potential inhibitors of the HMG-CoA enzyme and investigating cholesterol metabolism, cell growth and differentiation processes.",

However, the exact mechanisms by which these factors cause early glomerulosclerosis and proteinuria remain unclear.

In addition, podocytes from OZR showed positive staining for desmin. Use of the ACE inhibitor quinapril normalized proteinuria, cholesterol levels, glomerular lesions, and podocyte morphology. In contrast, atorvastatin ameliorated but did not normalize renal damage, with a partial reduction in desmin staining and podocyte morphology. Treatment with both drugs resulted in only a slight reduction in IL-8 and IP-10 in the tubulointerstitium.",

    "69": "When risk factors such as dyslipidemia and hypertension are inadequately controlled in subjects with the metabolic syndrome by lifestyle interventions, pharmacologic approaches are warranted. Statins are first-line pharmacotherapy for dyslipidemia due to their efficacy for lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and may also improve high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Fibrates and niacin may be useful in combination with a statin for additionally lowering triglycerides or raising HDL cholesterol. Adequate control of hypertension will usually require two or more drugs; agents that block the renin-angiotensin system are particularly useful in this population, given their demonstrated benefits for reducing the burden of cardiovascular events and end-stage renal disease independent of blood-pressure lowering. A multifaceted approach to risk factor management for the metabolic syndrome will have benefits for prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.",

It is presumed to result from disturbances of microcirculation in the anterior portion of the optic nerve head due to hemodynamic factors derived from excessive blood viscosity, or restriction of the vasal lumen in hypertensive, hypercholesterolemic, diabetic patients. We aimed to determine whether acute reduction of plasma fibrinogen and serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is effective for treatment of NAION. We recruited 11 patients (7 females, 4 males) with a mean age of 57.2 +/- 19.6 years. All except one of them presented risk factors for atherosclerosis. The mean values of LDL-cholesterol and fibrinogen before treatment were 144 +/- 32 mg/dL and 341 +/- 80 mg/dL, respectively. All were treated with standard therapy (prednisone, salicylate, pentoxiphyllin) and underwent three sessions of LDL-apheresis (HELP system-B Braun) that can reduce plasma LDL-cholesterol and fibrinogen by more than 50% in a very short time. In all patients we observed a drastic reduction of LDL cholesterol and fibrinogen and a clear improvement in the visual functional data. In fact, mean values of corrected vision increased from 3.7/10 +/- 3/10 to 7.9/10 +/- 2.2/10 (P = 0.002) after the third session, while the scotomatous portion of the visual field regressed after the first session, and in 5 patients further regressed after the third session. This improvement had remained stable after 3 months. Thanks to it's effect of antagonizing hemorheologic disorders of the ocular microcirculation, fibrinogen/LDL-apheresis seems to be an efficacious treatment of NAION.",

    "81": "Statins reduce cholesterol levels through competitive inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the key enzyme that regulates cholesterol synthesis. The cholesterol-lowering effect of statins is also due to an increase in the uptake of cholesterol by cells as a result of intracellular cholesterol depletion and enhanced expression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors. The use of statins as lipid-lowering agents has lead to remarkable changes in the treatment and prevention of ischemic heart disease. Results of large clinical trials of patients with ischemic heart disease have demonstrated that statins reduce inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, an independent risk factor in the disease. Statins exhibit properties that are beyond their lipid-lowering effects. These non-lipid-lowering properties involve the inhibition of the isoprenoid pathway through decreased synthesis of many nonsteroidal isoprenoid compounds. The focus on the immunomodulatory effect of statins is the result of the positive outcome of pravastatin treatment in cardiac transplantation patients, as well as angiographic regression studies showing insignificant changes in the degree of coronary stenosis despite a large reduction in cardiac events. Statin treatment reduces the risk of ischemic stroke despite the fact that LDL cholesterol is not directly associated with the risk of stroke. This observation lead to the investigation of the role of statins in inflammation and the immune system. Recent research data demonstrated that statins inhibit the induction of the major histocompatibility (MHC) class II expression by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), leading to repression of MHC II-mediated T-cell activation. Furthermore, statins inhibit the expression of specific cell surface receptors on monocytes, adhesion molecules and also integrin-dependent leucocyte adhesion. While statins may stimulate the secretion of caspase-1, IL-1beta and IL-18 in peripheral mononuclear cells in response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, they exhibit additional effects on inflammation by decreasing IL-6 synthesis in human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in vitro. The focus of this monograph is to highlight the role of statins in the modulation of the immune system and inflammatory processes.", 
    "82": "Statins, a group of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, are widely used in clinical practice for their efficacy in producing significant reductions in plasma cholesterol and LDL cholesterol and in reducing morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. However, several large clinical trials have suggested that the cholesterol-lowering effects of statins may not completely account for the reduced incidence of cardiovascular disease seen in patients receiving statin therapy. A number of recent reports have shown that statins may also have important antiinflammatory effects, in addition to their effects on plasma lipids. Since inflammation is closely linked to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the molecular basis of the observed antiinflammatory effects of statins may relate to their ability block the production and/or activity of ROS. In this review, we will discuss both the inhibition of ROS generation by statins, through interference with NAD(P)H oxidase expression and activity, and the actions of statins that serve to blunt the damaging effects of these radicals, including effects on antioxidant enzymes, lipid peroxidation, LDL cholesterol oxidation and nitric oxide synthase. These antioxidant effects of statins likely contribute to their clinical efficacy in treating cardiovascular disease as well as other chronic conditions associated with increased oxidative stress in humans.",

Monocyte TF expression and monocyte-platelet aggregates were measured by whole-blood flow cytometry over the same time course. The increases in hsCRP and MCP-1, both known inducers of TF, were significantly suppressed by statin treatment after LPS challenge. Statin premedication blunted the increase of monocyte TF expression in response to LPS. In parallel, endotoxin-induced formation of F1.2 was significantly reduced by simvastatin after 4 and 8 hours.

    "91": "Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) contribute to postnatal neovascularization. Risk factors for coronary artery disease reduce the number of EPCs in humans. Since EPC apoptosis might be a potential mechanism to regulate the number of EPCs, we investigated the effects of oxidative stress and HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors (statins) on EPC apoptosis. Atorvastatin, mevastatin, or VEGF prevented EPC apoptosis induced by H2O2. The antiapoptotic effect was reversed by inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Forkhead transcription factors (FOXO1, FOXO3a, FOXO4) exert proapoptotic effects and are phosphorylated and, thereby, inactivated by Akt. Therefore, we elucidated the involvement of forkhead transcription factors. Atorvastatin induced the phosphorylation of the predominant forkhead factor FOXO4 in EPCs. In addition, atorvastatin reduced the expression of the proapoptotic forkhead-regulated protein Bim in a PI3K-dependent manner. Consistently, overexpression of FOXO4 activated the Bim promoter as determined by reporter gene expression and stimulated the expression of Bim, resulting in an increased EPC apoptosis. Statins failed to prevent EPC apoptosis induced by overexpression of Bim or nonphosphorylatable FOXO4, suggesting that the protective effects of statins depend on this pathway. In summary, our results show that FOXO-dependent expression of Bim plays a pivotal role for EPC apoptosis. Statins reduce oxidative stress-induced EPC apoptosis, inactivate FOXO4, and down-regulate Bim.",

From all patients 692 were either on a statin or ASA monotherapy (Groups B + C). Relative risk reductions (RRRs) in 'all events' (primary endpoint) between groups were assessed. During the 3-year follow-up there were 292 cardiovascular events; 92 (12% of patients) in Group A, 14 (15%) in group B, 144 in Group C (24%) and 42 events in Group D (35%). The total number of events in Group B + C was 158 (23%).

Introduction of mutant p53 did not affect MG132-mediated p14(ARF) protein stabilization. We found that phorbol ester TPA (12-o-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate) stabilized p14(ARF) protein and that p53 status had no effect on TPA-mediated stabilization. TPA-mediated stabilization was abolished by staurosporine but not by lovastatin or U0126. We further investigated which isoforms of PKC were involved in TPA-mediated p14(ARF) stabilization using short-interference RNA. Knockdown of PKCalpha, but not PKCdelta, attenuated TPA-mediated p14(ARF) stabilization. These findings suggest that PKCalpha is involved in TPA-mediated stabilization of p14(ARF) protein, and this effect of TPA was not affected by the Ras/MAPK pathway or p53 status.

Lipoproteins (cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol, VLDL-triglycerides, lipoprotein(a)) were determined twice (before and during ezetimibe/placebo, each given for 5 weeks), dietary behaviour was analyzed once (3-days-protocol) during each treatment period. During ezetimibe the mean (+/-S.D.) preapheresis LDL-cholesterol concentration decreased from 159+/-26 mg/dl (4.11+/-0.67 mmol/l) to 133+/-28 mg/dl (3.44+/-0.72 mmol/l) (-16+/-11%, P<0.0001, Wilcoxon test) and the postapheresis LDL-cholesterol from 51+/-9 mg/dl (1.32+/-0.23 mmol/l) to 43+/-8 mg/dl (1.11+/-0.21 mmol/l) (-14+/-25%, P<0.05), while there was no significant change during placebo.

The functional significance and neuroprotectiove mechanism of simvastatins in ischemic brain injury is controversial. The purpose of study is to evaluate the effect of simvastatin on ischemic brain injury and to investigate the perfusion capability of brain microvessels in the ischemic injury. This study included two series of experiments. In the first series, we studied if simvastatin is neuroprotective in an embolic model of stroke. The treatments began 2 weeks before middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. Infarct volume was measured at 48 h post stroke. Neurological deficits were assessed at 2 h, 24 h and 48 h post stroke. Results showed that infarct volume in rats which received saline and simvastatin was 32.5 +/- 9.3% (mean +/- SD) and 18.7 +/- 6.5%, respectively. The infarct volume in the simvastatin group was significantly smaller than in the controls (P < 0.002). Treatment with simvastatin also improved neurological deficits and reduced brain edema significantly (P < 0.05). In the second series, we studied if simvastatin can improve microvascular reperfusions after ischemia. Perfusion deficits were detected at 8 h post stroke using Evens blue dye. Neurological deficits were assessed at 2 h and 8 h post stroke. Results showed that perfusion deficit in saline and simvastatin-treated groups were 58.7 +/- 8.7% and 23.4 +/- 7.5%, respectively. The perfusion deficit in simvastatin-treated group was decreased 61% (P < 0.01).

However, the overall benefits observed with statins appear to be greater than what might be expected from changes in lipid levels alone, suggesting effects beyond cholesterol lowering. Indeed, recent studies indicate that some of the cholesterol-independent or \"pleiotropic\" effects of statins involve improving endothelial function, enhancing the stability of atherosclerotic plaques, decreasing oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibiting the thrombogenic response. Furthermore, statins have beneficial extrahepatic effects on the immune system, CNS, and bone. Many of these pleiotropic effects are mediated by inhibition of isoprenoids, which serve as lipid attachments for intracellular signaling molecules. In particular, inhibition of small GTP-binding proteins, Rho, Ras, and Rac, whose proper membrane localization and function are dependent on isoprenylation, may play an important role in mediating the pleiotropic effects of statins.",

A large body of evidence from numerous, well-controlled, randomized trials demonstrates that statins significantly reduce fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events in the general population. Cardiovascular benefits of statins have been conventionally attributed to reduction in levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. More recently, subanalyses of large clinical trials suggest that statins may also prove beneficial in ameliorating the progression of kidney disease through their cholesterol-dependent and/or cholesterol-independent (pleiotropic) effects.

More important, patients at this federal institution continue to receive life-saving medical therapy during follow-up. Better use of evidence-based therapy may be related to affiliation of this VA Medical Center with a teaching institution where board certified cardiologists are involved in short- and long-term care of these patients.", 
    "112": "Reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide anion (O2-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), may act as second messengers of intracellular signaling and play a key role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappa B) is a redox-sensitive transcription factor that is involved in this process. The aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms of action of statins on cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and monocytic cells (THP-1) under oxidative stress. In THP-1 and cultured VSMC, O2- caused an increase in NF-kappa B activation (P < 0.05) that was correlated with inhibitory I kappa B-alpha degradation. Atorvastatin or simvastatin decreased NF-kappa B activation induced by oxidative stress by around 50% in both cell types and was correlated with the I kappa B-alpha levels. In monocytes, O2- increased I kappa B kinase (IKK)-1 and IKK-2 activity (P < 0.05) and p38 and p42/44 activation and phosphorylation, which was reduced by statins. PD 98059 (p42/44 inhibitor) and SB20358 (p38 inhibitor) decreased NF-kappa B binding activity and prevented I kappa B-alpha degradation. However, we only observed a reduction in IKK-1 and IKK-2 activity with PD98059. Statins diminish NF-kappa B activation elicited by oxidative stress through the inhibition of IKK-1/-2, p38, and p42/44 activation. These data may help to further understand the molecular mechanisms of statins in cardiovascular disease.", 
    "113": "Hyperlipidemia constitutes a major etiopathological factor for atherosclerosis. The medicinal value of garlic is best known for its lipid lowering effects and antiatherogenic effects. The mechanism by which lipid soluble organosulphur compounds from garlic reduce plasma lipids has not been fully investigated. The author had previously shown that the hepatic activity of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis and the incorporation of radiolabeled (1, 2 14C), acetate into hepatic free and esterified cholesterol was significantly decreased in rat treated with garlic derived organosulphur compounds. We hypothesised that the antiatherogenic effect of the organosulphur compounds may be attributed to the formation of protein internal disulphide and thus inactivation of thiol (-SH) group enzymes such as HMG-CoA reductase and the multienzyme complex of fatty acid synthesis. The objective of the present study is to elucidate the inhibitory mechanism by in vitro studies.",

    "116": "The antiatherogenic effects of these organosulphur compounds can be attributed to such reactions that inhibit HMG-CoA reductase and other lipogenic enzymes. The anticarcinogenic effects of these compounds may also be due to inhibitory reactions on enzymes that activate carcinogens.", 
    "117": "The goal of the present research was to assess the efficacy of combination treatment with antioxidant coenzyme Q10 and simvastatin as well as coenzyme Q10 without statin therapy in order to prevent coronary atherosclerosis. 42 outpatients were divided into 2 groups: receiving coenzyme Q10 (Hasco-Lek, Poland) 60mg daily and its combination with simvastatin (zocor, vasilip) 10mg daily for an 8-week period. The treatment with coenzyme Q10 demonstrated its potential independent role in positive modification of oxidative stress, antiatherogenic fraction of lipid profile, atherogenic ratio, platelet aggregability. Taking into consideration the obtained results the study supports the use of coenzyme Q10 in combination with statins. Suggested attractive approach may result in complete correction of dislipidemia, reverse of endothelial dysfunction, reduce degree of oxidative stress and platelet aggregability. Consequently such a combination may be beneficial in preventing of further development of atherosclerosis in native coronary arteries as well as in bypass grafts in all coronary heart disease patients with or without myocardial revascularization.",

More patients in the statin group had documented hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, or had proven coronary artery disease. Overall, the rate of change of Vmax was not different between statin-treated patients and controls (0.13+/-0.24 vs 0.14+/-0.19 m/s/year, p = 0.72).

Wide variations were observed between regions for prescribing of secondary preventative therapies with the highest variability observed for statin prescribing (1.5- to 1.6-fold) and for AT2 antagonist prescribing (2.0-fold) in NIDDM patients. In those with NIDDM, men were more likely to receive aspirin OR=1.26 (1.21--1.31), ACE inhibitors 1.14 (1.101.18), and fibrates OR=1.55 (1.23--1.96) than women and those aged over 75 years were less likely to receive statins OR=0.60 (0.56--0.65) and fibrates OR=0.25 (0.17--0.37) than those aged 45--74. Similar results were also shown for patients with IDDM.",

    "138": "Leukocyte and platelet adhesion to endothelial cells, an early step in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, is mediated through adhesion molecules. It has been shown that statins decrease adhesion molecule expression. We examined the hypothesis that fluvastatin decreased intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) expression through a nitric oxide-mediated pathway. Human iliac artery endothelial cells were exposed to fluvastatin in the presence or absence of 2 mM N-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA). Flow cytometry analysis was used to measure ICAM-1 and PECAM-1 expression. In a separate experiment, confluent cell cultures were exposed in a serum-free medium to fluvastatin 20 microM, and the supernatant was collected for nitrate/nitrite determination after 6 and 48 hr of incubation. Protein was isolated and processed for immunoblotting with monoclonal antibodies specific for endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), Ser(1177)-phosphorylated eNOS, and AMP kinase. Relative band intensity was assessed with densitometry. Results are presented as the mean +/- standard deviation (SD), and p < 0.05 was considered significant. ICAM-1 and PECAM-1 were expressed constitutively. Human iliac artery endothelial cells (HIAECS) treated with 5 microM fluvastatin did not exhibit reduced expression of PECAM-1 or ICAM-1. Incubation with 10 microM fluvastatin reduced basal expression of both ICAM-1 and PECAM-1. Fluorescence intensity (FI) for these substance was as follows: 3638 +/- 1671, p = 0.01 and PECAM-1 vs. control FI 276 +/- 52 vs. 522 +/- 78, p = 0.02. In the presence of 2 mM L-NMMA, fluvastatin failed to decrease the expression of ICAM-1 (fluvastatin 10 microM + L-NMMA: FI was 3042 +/- 1378 vs. 3638 +/- 1671 for the control p = 0.01) or PECAM-1 (fluvastatin 10 microM + L-NMMA: FI was 415 +/- 188 vs. 522 +/- 78 for the control, p = 0.1). Incubation with 20 microM fluvastatin similarly reduced ICAM-1 expression (FI was 2014 +/- 1595 vs. 3638 +/- 1671 for the control, p = 0.02) and PECAM-1 expression (FI was 196 +/- 109 vs. 522 +/- 78 for the control, p = 0.02). This reduction was prevented in the presence of 2 mM L-NMMA. L-NMMA in a concentration of 2 mM had no significant effect on adhesion molecule expression (p > 0.05 for all comparisons of the control FI versus 2 mM L-NMMA mean FI). After a 48 hr incubation with 20 microM fluvastatin there was a 219 +/- 35% increase in the cell eNOS protein content (p = 0.01) and a 170 +/- 26% increase in the cell AMPK protein content (p = 0.02). Ser(1177)-phosphorylated eNOS protein levels were increased by 41 +/- 8% (p = 0.03). The nitric oxide concentration in the medium of the HIAEC treated with 20 microM fluvastatin for 48 hr was significantly higher than that in the control (p = 0.0004), pointing to increased production during the incubation period. Fluvastatin thus decreases basal expression of ICAM-1 and PECAM-1. Competitive inhibition of eNOS with L-NMMA abolishes the effect of fluvastatin on ICAM-1 and PECAM-1 expression. The statin up-regulates eNOS and AMP kinase, one of the enzymes that activates eNOS via phosphorylation at Ser(1177). We have shown that after a 48-hr exposure to fluvastatin there is an increased amount of the phosphorylated enzyme in the endothelial cells.", 
    "139": "RhoA plays a critical role in regulating NO production in cultured endothelial cells. To determine its role in in situ endothelial cells, we investigated the effects of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors and a RhoA-binding domain of Rho-kinase (RB) on vascular contractility in the isolated rabbit mesenteric artery. Ex vivo treatment of the strips with 3x10(-5) mol/L simvastatin and fluvastatin for approximately 24 to 30 hours significantly attenuated the contractile response to phenylephrine and high K+ in the presence of endothelium. The addition of N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and the removal of endothelium abolished the attenuation of the contractile response. The cotreatment with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate prevented the statin-induced attenuation of the contractile response, whereas geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor mimicked the effect of simvastatin. Treatment with simvastatin enhanced the bradykinin-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation in the mesenteric artery, whereas it had no effect on the bradykinin-induced [Ca2+]i elevation in endothelial cells of the aortic valves. Introduction of RB to the strips using a cell-penetrating peptide of Tat protein (TATHA-RB) attenuated the contractile responses in a NO-dependent manner. However, a Rac1/Cdc42-binding fragment of p21-activated protein kinase, RB without Tat peptide or TATHA-protein A had no effect. The in vivo treatment of rabbit with simvastatin and TATHA-RB attenuated the contractility in a NO-dependent manner. Simvastatin and TATHA-RB significantly upregulated eNOS in the rabbit mesenteric artery. The present study provides the first evidence that RhoA plays a physiological role in suppressing NO production in in situ endothelial cells.", 
    "140": "The cholesterol biosynthetic pathway produces numerous signaling molecules. Oxysterols through liver X receptor (LXR) activation regulate cholesterol efflux, whereas the non-sterol mevalonate metabolite, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), was recently demonstrated to inhibit ABCA1 expression directly, through antagonism of LXR and indirectly through enhanced RhoA geranylgeranylation. We used HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) to test the hypothesis that reduced synthesis of mevalonate metabolites would enhance cholesterol efflux and attenuate foam cell formation. Preincubation of THP-1 macrophages with atorvastatin, dose dependently (1-10 microm) stimulated cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein AI (apoAI, 10-60%, p < 0.05) and high density lipoprotein (HDL(3)) (2-50%, p < 0.05), despite a significant decrease in cholesterol synthesis (2-90%). Atorvastatin also increased ABCA1 and ABCG1 mRNA abundance (30 and 35%, p < 0.05). Addition of mevalonate, GGPP or farnesyl pyrophosphate completely blocked the statin-induced increase in ABCA1 expression and apoAI-mediated cholesterol efflux. A role for RhoA was established, because two inhibitors of Rho protein activity, a geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor and C3 exoenzyme, increased cholesterol efflux to apoAI (20-35%, p < 0.05), and macrophage expression of dominant-negative RhoA enhanced cholesterol efflux to apoAI (20%, p < 0.05). In addition, atorvastatin increased the RhoA levels in the cytosol fraction and decreased the membrane localization of RhoA. Atorvastatin treatment activated peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma and increased LXR-mediated gene expression suggesting that atorvastatin induces cholesterol efflux through a molecular cascade involving inhibition of RhoA signaling, leading to increased peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma activity, enhanced LXR activation, increased ABCA1 expression, and cholesterol efflux. Finally, statin treatment inhibited cholesteryl ester accumulation in macrophages challenged with atherogenic hypertriglyceridemic very low density lipoproteins indicating that statins can regulate foam cell formation.", 
    "141": "In patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), non-remitting deficits are mainly caused by axonal and neuronal damage. We demonstrated previously that myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in rats provokes severe axonal and neuronal injury even before clinical manifestation of the disease. In our present study, we investigated effects of simvastatin treatment on degeneration of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) bodies as well as their axons during MOG-induced optic neuritis. Electrophysiological functions of optic nerves and RGCs were analyzed in vivo. Although neuroprotective effects of simvastatin have been demonstrated before in other experimental settings, we did not observe an increase in RGC survival nor an improvement of visual functions. As we could not reproduce the anti-inflammatory effects that were observed under statin therapy in other EAE models, we hypothesize that patients suffering from optic neuritis might not take advantage of simvastatin applications.", 
    "142": "As statin therapy has been reported to reduce antioxidants such as vitamin E and coenzyme Q10 and there are indications that this reduction may cause impairment of left ventricular function (LVF), we studied the influence of simvastatin on LVF and serum vitamin E and coenzyme Q10 levels in humans.", 
    "143": "We assessed the effect of simvastatin on left ventricular function and coenzyme Q10 levels in 21 (11 male, 10 female) hypercholesterolaemic subjects (mean age = 56 years) with normal LVF, over a period of 6 months. Subjects were re-tested after a 1-month wash-out period (7 months). Echocardiography was performed on all subjects before commencement of simvastatin (20 mg day(-1)), and at 1, 3, 6 and 7 months after initiation of treatment. Fasting blood samples were also collected at these intervals to assess lipids, apoproteins, vitamin E and coenzyme Q10.", 
    "144": "Serum lipids showed the expected reductions. Plasma vitamin E and coenzyme Q10 levels were reduced by 17 +/- 4% (P < 0.01) and 12 +/- 4% (P < 0.03) at 6 months. However, the coenzyme Q10/LDL-cholesterol ratio and vitamin E/LDL-cholesterol ratio increased significantly. Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) decreased transiently after 1 month, while no significant change was observed at 3 and 6 months. Other markers of left ventricular function did not change significantly at any time point.", 
    "145": "Despite reduced plasma vitamin E and coenzyme Q10, 20 mg of simvastatin therapy is associated with a significantly increased coenzyme Q10/LDL-cholesterol ratio and vitamin E/LDL-cholesterol ratio. Simvastatin treatment is not associated with impairment in left ventricular systolic or diastolic function in hypercholesterolaemic subjects after 6 months of treatment.",

Combination treatments to promote a maximal reduction of the ratio between total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein are currently the most effective way of preventing CVD. In this review, we assess the role of plant sterols and statins in CVD prevention. Statins have been used by millions of patients at high to moderate risk of CVD, while plant sterols are potentially available to whole populations in food products. The benefits and risks of each compound, as well as the combination, are discussed.",

These markers were all significantly increased in hypertensive and hyperlipidemic patients with Type 2 diabetes. In hypertensive patients with diabetes, CD62P, CD63, PAC-1, platelet and endothelial microparticles, and soluble adhesion markers were all decreased by losartan monotherapy. The decrease of each marker in hypertensive and hyperlipidemic patients given combined therapy with losartan plus simvastatin was greater among those with than without Type 2 diabetes. Low-density lipoprotein was decreased significantly by simvastatin and was correlated with CD62P or platelet microparticles in all of the patients.",

    "151": "Inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase (statins) are potent cholesterol-lowering drugs. Large clinical trials have shown that statins reduce the incidence of cerebrovascular events, which might be surprising because cholesterol is not an established risk factor for stroke. In addition to their cholesterol-lowering properties, statins exert a number of pleiotropic, vasculoprotective actions that include improvement of endothelial function, increased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, antioxidant properties, inhibition of inflammatory responses, immunomodulatory actions, regulation of progenitor cells, and stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques. In fact, statins augment cerebral blood flow and confer significant protection in animal models of stroke partly via mechanisms related to the upregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Retrospective clinical evidence suggests that long-term statin administration may not only reduce stroke risk but also improve outcome. Early secondary prevention trials are underway to test the hypothesis that statin treatment initiated immediately after an event improves short-term outcome. Lastly, recent evidence suggests that sudden discontinuation of statin treatment leads to a rebound effect with downregulation of NO production. Withdrawal of statin treatment may impair vascular function and increase morbidity and mortality in patients with vascular disease.",

At each clinic visit, beginning at week 12, the dose of SIMVA was titrated upward until patients reached their National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel II LDL-C goal or the maximum SIMVA dose of 80 mg/d. Safety/tolerability and lipid efficacy parameters were assessed at 12-week intervals.", 
    "155": "Of 433 patients entering the extension study, 355 were randomized to receive EZE and 78 were randomized to receive PBO. Baseline demographic characteristics and lipid levels were similar between treatment groups. Overall, coadministration of EZE + SIMVA was well tolerated.

The risk reduction for coronary artery disease for patients using statins is 27%. These reductions, however, are average effects for all patients included in the trials. There is notable interindividual variation in response to statins, and the origins of this variation are poorly understood. Pharmacogenetics seeks to determine the role of genetic factors in variation of drug response. In patients with primary hypercholesterolemia, 23 studies have examined the effects of genetic polymorphisms at 20 different loci on the lipid response to statin treatment, and 18 studies examined genetic polymorphisms involved in the benefits of statin therapy in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Even though many studies have been performed, few results have been replicated. It is our contention that larger sample sizes and consideration of multiple genes are needed in the field of pharmacogenetics of statin response.", 
    "158": "Vascular complications are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The recently published Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) showed that atorvastatin (10 mg, once daily vs. placebo) markedly reduces vascular events in this high-risk population. The participants (n = 2838) were fairly typical T2DM = 2838) patients without cardiovascular disease and with at least one other risk factor: hypertension, retinopathy, albuminuria or current smoking. In the treatment group, coronary events were reduced by 36% (p = 0.001) and stroke by 48% (p = 0.001). The trial was terminated two years early on ethical grounds. The number needed to treat (NNT) was 27 for four years to prevent one event. However, the benefit may have been greater since a proportion of the placebo group received statin therapy. The benefit from statin treatment was independent of sex, age, baseline lipid levels, was independent of sex, age, baseline lipid levels, systolic blood pressure, retinopathy, albuminuria, systolic blood pressure, retinopathy, albuminuria, smoking or HbA smoking or HbA(1c). The frequency of adverse events did not differ between the groups. These findings support those of other statin trials.", 
    "159": "CARDS does not comment on renal function. However, other trials suggest that statins preserve renal function in those with and without DM. We discuss the CARDS study in this context in this brief overview paper.", 
    "160": "the evidence shows that we need to control glucose to prevent microvascular complications, to lower cholesterol to prevent macrovascular disease and to lower blood pressure to prevent both. It may be that the benefit of statins extends beyond a threshold low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in patients with T2DM. More trials are needed in this field.", 
    "161": "To investigate the efficacy of the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe in patients with refractory familial hyperlipidaemia or intolerant to statin therapy.", 
    "162": "This prospective study assessed the safety and efficacy of ezetimibe in 200 patients with refractory familial hyperlipidaemias not achieving a low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol < 3 cholesterol < 3 mmol/L (116 mg/dL) including 22% intolerant to all statin therapy, many consuming intolerant to all statin therapy, many consuming sterol-containing products.", 
    "163": "Ezetimibe monotherapy resulted in 7% and 11% reductions in LDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B respectively. Ezetimibe-statin combination therapy reduced LDL-cholesterol by an additional 11 +/- 27% and apolipoprotein B by 11 (+79 to -18)%. There was a similar response between various sub-groups but a wide variation within groups with the greatest effect seen in patients groups with the greatest effect seen in patients under-responding to statins. The number of patients achieving the LDL-C target of 3 mmol/L rose from 5.5% to 18%. Non-significant effects included a 5 (+78 to -470)% reduction in triglycerides, 8 +/- 36% increment in HDL-cholesterol, 21 (+35 to -82)% reduction in C-reactive protein and a 1 (+20 to -50)% increase in alanine transaminase. No effects were seen on creatinine, creatine kinase, or insulin resistance. Fourteen patients (7%) discontinued ezetimibe: seven due to gastrointestinal side-effects, one patient developed an ezetimibe-induced hypercholesterolaemia (x 1.5), one developed ezetimibe-induced hypertriglyceridaemia (x 7) and five discontinued for other reasons.", 
    "164": "Ezetimibe is a useful addition to statins in patients with familial hyperlipidaemias but shows a highly variable response profile.", 
    "165": "Outcome studies are used to measure clinically meaningful primary end points, such as mortality and cardiovascular morbidity. However, few outcome trials have been conducted exclusively in people with diabetes; the majority of conventional diabetes trials use surrogate end points that may or may not translate into clinical benefits. Our current knowledge of the effects of pharmacotherapies on cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes has been gained from subgroups included in large-scale studies. Several trials with lipid-modifying, antiplatelet and/or antihypertensive therapy, for example the recent Collaborative AtoRvastatin Diabetes Study, have included sufficient numbers of patients with diabetes to indicate that effective management can reduce cardio vascular risk in this patient population. The United Kingdom Diabetes Study and the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial provide important, but inconclusive data on the impact of glucose-lowering therapy on the incidence of cardiovascular complications in diabetes. Thiazolidinediones have only become available during the past few years, thus their effects were not assessed in these landmark trials. Ongoing studies in diabetic populations at high risk for further macrovascular events, such as the PROspective pioglitAzone Clinical Trial In macroVascular Events, have been designed to assess the effect of thiazolidinediones on cardiovascular outcome in patients with diabetes and should help to reinforce the importance of broad-based treatment of the multiple metabolic risk factors for cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes.", 
    "166": "This paper (based upon MEDLINE and EMBASE literature searches in the year range 1990-2005) reviews what we have learned from outcome studies up to the end of 2004 and looks at what we hope to learn from ongoing studies.", 
    "167": "Lipid abnormalities in people with diabetes are likely to play an important role in the development of atherogenesis. These lipid disorders include potentially atherogenic quantitative (increased triglyceride levels and decreased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol [HDL-C] levels) and qualitative abnormalities of lipoproteins (changes in lipoprotein size, increase in triglyceride content of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and HDL, glycation of apoproteins and increased susceptibility of LDL to oxidation). Guidelines from the two main diabetes organizations, the International Diabetes Federation and the American Diabetes Association, recommend the aggressive management of diabetic dyslipidaemia to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Statins are the first choice pharmacological therapy to address diabetic dyslipidaemia due to their effectiveness at lowering LDL-C levels in patients with diabetes. Fibrates (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor [PPAR]alpha ligands) target another aspect of dyslipidaemia by lower ing triglycerides (to a greater extent than statins) and raising HDL-C levels, especially when baseline levels are low. The PPARgamma agonist, pioglitazone appears to affect lipid metabolism by decreasing plasma triglycerides, increasing HDL-C and decreasing the number of small, dense atherogenic LDL particles.", 
    "168": "This paper provides a review of the current literature (based on searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE from 1985 to 2005, inclusive) supporting the recommendations for the management of dyslipidaemia among patients with type 2 diabetes, including new strategies involving drug combinations that achieve good glycaemic and lipidaemic control that could potentially reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with type 2 diabetes.", 
    "169": "People with type 2 diabetes generally carry an array of risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), including hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia, alterations in inflammatory mediators and coagulation/thrombolytic parameters, as well as other 'non-traditional' risk factors, many of which may be closely associated with insulin resistance. Consequently, rates of CVD mortality and morbidity are particularly high in this population. Targeting hyperglycaemia alone does not reduce the excess risk in diabetes, highlighting the need for aggressive treatment of other risk factors.", 
    "170": "This is a review of cardiovascular risk markers in diabetes, based on MEDLINE and EMBASE literature searches (1994-2004).", 
    "171": "Although, the current use of statin therapy is effective at reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, residual risk remains from other independent lipid and non-lipid factors. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma(PPARgamma) appears to be intimately involved in regulating risk markers at multiple levels. Ligands that activate PPARgamma, which include the thiazolidinedione (TZD) insulin-sensitizing agents used to manage type 2 diabetes, display a number of potential anti-atherogenic properties, including effects on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides, as well as other beneficial non-lipid effects, such as regulating levels of mediators involved in inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. Data from several sources suggest that simple strategies combining TZDs and statins could have complementary effects on CVD risk factors profiles in diabetes, alongside the ability to control glycaemia.", 
    "172": "It is hoped that studies currently underway will provide insights into the value of such treatment approaches in terms of reducing the excess CVD risk, morbidity and mortality associated with type 2 diabetes.", 
    "173": "We report on a patient who developed acute rhabdomyolysis after taking cerivastatin. A 74-year-old hypercholestrerolaemic woman taking cerivastatin (0.15 mg/day) for 22 days complained of general muscle weakness and muscle pain. Her serum creatinine phosphokinase level was 19,190 IU/L. Serum myoglobin was over 3000 ng/mL. Serum concentration of cerivastatin at 6 h after taking the last dose (0.15 mg) was 8062.5 ng/L, which was almost 5.7 times higher than that of normal persons. The serum concentration of cerivastatin showed that the half-life of cerivastatin in this patient was 22.4 h, compared with 2.4 h for normal controls. Cerivastatin is catabolized by cytochrome P450, 3A4 and 2C8 to M-1, and by 2C8 to M-23. The ratio of M-23 to M-1 in her serum was much lower than that of control persons (0.64 vs. 2.08). She had previously taken simvastatin which is metabolized by CYP3A4, without any sign and symptoms of rhabdomyolysis. These results suggest that the slowed clearance of cerivastatin in this patient might have been compounded by cytochrome P450, 2C8 dysfunction.", 
    "174": "The objective of the study was to investigate the effects of cerivastatin therapy on forearm endothelial dependent acetylcholine (ACH) and independent (nitroprusside) vasodilator responses, blood pressure (BP) responses to intravenous infusions of angiotensin II (AII) and noradrenaline (NA) and on 24-h ambulatory BP recordings in type 2 diabetic men.", 
    "175": "Eleven type 2 diabetic men aged 59 +/- 9 years with total cholesterol levels of 5.0 +/- 1.26 mmol/l, triglycerides of 2.23 mmol/l and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of 1.24 mmol/l completed a double-blind, randomized, crossover trial comparing 8 weeks of cerivastatin therapy (800 microg of nocte) with placebo. Forearm vascular resistance (FVR) responses to intrabrachial-arterial infusions of ACH (3-24 microg/min), nitroprusside (2-16 microg/min), the nitric oxide(NO) synthase inhibitor l-nitro-mono-methyl arginine (l-nmma) (8 micromol/min), ACH during l-NMMA infusion and BP responses to intravenous infusions of AII (12.5-50 ng/min) and NA (20-400 ng/min) were measured at the end of each treatment period. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory BP recordings were also performed.", 
    "176": "FVR responses to ACH during l-NMMA infusion were significantly (p = 0.026) greater during cerivastatin than during placebo therapy. In contrast, FVR responses to ACH in the absence of NO synthase inhibition did not differ significantly between cerivastatin and placebo therapies (p = 0.81). FVR increased by 31.4 +/- 57.3% in response to l-NMMA infusion during cerivastatin therapy compared with 6.1 +/- 41.2% during placebo therapy (p = 0.20). FVR responses to nitroprusside did not differ between cerivastatin and placebo therapies (p = 0.28), nor did BP responses to AII (systolic BP, p = 0.99; diastolic BP, p = 0.98) or NA (systolic BP, p = 0.21; diastolic BP, p = 0.48). Mean 24-h BP was similar during cerivastatin (123 +/- 10 or 70 +/- 7 mmHg) and placebo therapies (129 +/- 11 or 74 +/- 7 mmHg) (systolic BP, p = 0.26; diastolic BP, p = 0.41).", 
    "177": "Cerivastatin increases FVR responses to ACH in type 2 diabetic men with mild dyslipidaemia but only following NO synthase inhibition. This may indicate an improvement in endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor-mediated responses.", 
    "178": "Lipid rafts are cholesterol-enriched microdomains in plasma membranes. The functional activity of many membrane proteins, including death and growth factor receptors, depends on their insertion in lipid rafts. We have previously demonstrated the presence of lipid rafts in keratinocytes and shown that lipid rafts are involved in the control of keratinocyte proliferation and metabolic activity. In this work, we investigated the effect of lipid-raft disruption on HaCaT keratinocyte survival. Lipid rafts could be disrupted or rearranged with cholesterol-targeting detergents: methyl-beta-cyclodextrin and filipin III. Moreover, cholesterol oxidation by a specific oxidase or blocking of cholesterol synthesis by mevastatin had a similar effect on lipid rafts. All cholesterol-modifying substances caused cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. More detailed studies on the effects of cyclodextrin revealed apoptotic cell death at concentrations >or=0.5% (w/v). The molecular mechanism of apoptosis precipitated by raft disruption remains unknown but does not seem to be dependent of either membrane permeabilization or cell-cycle arrest imposed by cholesterol-modifying compounds."
