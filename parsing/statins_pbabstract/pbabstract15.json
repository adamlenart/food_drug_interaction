    "1": "We used data from the Queensland Pancreatic Cancer Study, a population-based case-control study. In total, 704 cases and 711 age- and sex-matched controls were recruited. Participants completed an interview in which they were asked about history of NSAID and statin use. We included 522 cases and 653 controls who had completed the medication section of the interview in this analysis. Unconditional multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate associations between medication use and pancreatic cancer.", 
    "2": "We found no consistent evidence of an association between use of NSAIDs or statins and risk of pancreatic cancer. There was some suggestion of a protective effect in infrequent users of selective COX-2 inhibitors, but no association in more frequent users. We did not find evidence of protective effects in analyses stratified by sex, smoking status, time between diagnosis and interview, or presence/absence of metastases.", 
    "3": "Overall, our results do support the hypothesis that use of NSAIDs or statins may reduce the odds of developing pancreatic cancer.",

The standard AAC score, the Agatston, up-weights for greater calcium density, and thus models higher calcium density as associated with increased CVD risk. We determined associations of CVD risk factors with AAC volume and density (separately).", 
    "5": "In a multi-ethnic cohort of community living adults, we used abdominal computed tomography scans to measure AAC volume and density. Multivariable linear regression was used to determine the period cross-sectional independent associations of CVD risk factors with AAC volume and AAC density in participants with prevalent AAC.", 
    "6": "Among 1413 participants with non-zero AAC scores, the mean age was 65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09 years, 52% were men, 44% were European-, 24% were Hispanic-, 18% were African-, and 14% were Chinese Americans (EA, HA, AA, and CA respectively). Median (interquartile range, IQR) for AAC volume was 628\u00a0mm(3) (157-1939\u00a0mm(3)), and mean AAC density was 3.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6. Compared to EA, each of HA, AA, and CA had lower natural log (ln) AAC volume, but higher AAC density. After adjustments for AAC density, older age, ever smoking history, higher systolic blood pressure, elevated total cholesterol, reduced HDL cholesterol, statin and anti-hypertensive medication use, family history of myocardial infarction, and alcohol consumption were significantly associated with higher ln(AAC volume). In contrast, after adjustments for ln(AAC volume), older age, ever smoking history, higher BMI, and lower HDL cholesterol were significantly associated with lower AAC density.",

    "8": "In the current work, we describe the identification and characterization of the first plasmid-encoded P450 (CYP107DY1) from a Bacillus species. The recombinant CYP107DY1 exhibits characteristic P450 absolute and reduced CO-bound difference spectra. Reconstitution with different redox systems revealed the autologous one, consisting of BmCPR and Fdx2, as the most effective one. Screening of a library of 18 pharmaceutically relevant compounds displayed activity towards mevastatin to produce pravastatin. Pravastatin is an important therapeutic drug to treat hypercholesterolemia, which was described to be produced by oxyfunctionlization of mevastatin (compactin) by members of CYP105 family. The hydroxylation at C6 of mevastatin was also suggested by docking this compound into a computer model created for CYP107DY1. Moreover, in view of the biotechnological application, CYP107DY1 as well as its redox partners (BmCPR and Fdx2) were successfully utilized to establish an E. coli based whole-cell system for an efficient biotransformation of mevastatin. The in vitro and in vivo application of the CYP07DY1 also offers the possibility for the screening of more substrates, which could open up further biotechnological usage of this enzyme.", 
    "9": "The purpose of this study is to review genetic risk variants for coronary artery disease (CAD) and how they will change the management and prevention of CAD currently and in the future.", 
    "10": "Through the efforts of international consortia, 58 genetic risk variants for CAD of genome-wide significance have been replicated in appropriate independent populations. Only one third of these variants mediate their risk through known conventional risk factors for CAD. Thus, unknown mechanisms contribute to CAD. Secondly, the genetic risk is proportional to the total number of risk variants rather than the intensity of any risk factor. Thirdly, the availability of the genetic risk variants enables one to perform Mendelian randomization (MR) studies since they are randomized at conception, not confounded, fixed for life, and can be used to determine if a risk factor is causative or just a marker. MR can also be used to determine the safety and efficacy of a gene product targeted for drug therapy. Genetic risk variants have been shown to successfully risk stratify for CAD in both primary and secondary preventions. Contrary to dogma, MR documents that plasma HDL-C is not protective of CAD. The use of genetic risk score (GRS) for CAD is shown to be more effective in risk stratifying for CAD than the Framingham risk score and independent of the conventional risk factors including family history. Furthermore, the GRS predicts the response to statin therapy in primary and secondary preventions. The use of GRS could represent a paradigm shift in the prevention of CAD.", 
    "11": "Myopathy is the most commonly reported adverse effect of statins. All statins are associated with myopathy, though with different rates. Rosuvastatin is a potent statin reported to induce myopathy comparable to earlier statins. However, in clinical practice most patients could tolerate rosuvastatin over other statins. This study aimed to evaluate the myopathic pattern of rosuvastatin in rats using biochemical, functional and histopathological examinations. The possible deleterious effects of rosuvastatin on muscle mitochondria were also examined. The obtained results were compared to myopathy induced by atorvastatin in equimolar dose. Results showed that rosuvastatin induced a rise in CK, a slight increase in myoglobin level together with mild muscle necrosis. Motor activity, assessed by rotarod, showed that rosuvastatin decreased rats' performance. All these manifestations were obviously mild compared to the prominent effects of atorvastatin. Parallel results were obtained in mitochondrial dysfunction parameters. Rosuvastatin only induced a slight increase in LDH and a minor decrease in ATP (\u223c14%) and pAkt (\u223c12%). On the other hand, atorvastatin induced an increase in LDH, lactate/pyruvate ratio and a pronounced decline in ATP (\u223c80%) and pAkt (\u223c65%). These findings showed that rosuvastatin was associated with mild myotoxic effects in rats, especially when compared to atorvastatin.", 
    "12": "There are currently six different classes of drugs available for lowering cholesterol levels. There are currently seven HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) approved for lowering cholesterol levels and they are the first line drugs for treating lipid disorders and can lower LDL cholesterol levels by as much as 60%. Statins also are effective in reducing triglyceride levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia. Statins lower LDL levels by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase activity leading to decreases in hepatic cholesterol content resulting in an up-regulation of hepatic LDL receptors, which increases the clearance of LDL. The major side effects are muscle complications and an increased risk of diabetes. The different statins have varying drug interactions. Ezetimibe lowers LDL cholesterol levels by approximately 20% by inhibiting cholesterol absorption by the intestines leading to the decreased delivery of cholesterol to the liver, a decrease in hepatic cholesterol content, and an up-regulation of hepatic LDL receptors. Ezetimibe is very useful as add on therapy when statin therapy is not sufficient or in statin intolerant patients. Ezetimibe has few side effects. Bile acid sequestrants lower LDL cholesterol by10-30% by decreasing the absorption of bile acids in the intestine which decreases the bile acid pool consequently stimulating the synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol leading to a decrease in hepatic cholesterol content and an up-regulation of hepatic LDL receptors. Bile acid sequestrants can be difficult to use as they decrease the absorption of multiple drugs, increase triglyceride levels, and cause constipation and other GI side effects. They do improve glycemic control in patients with diabetes which is an additional benefit. PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies lower LDL cholesterol by 50-60% by binding PCSK9, which decreases the degradation of LDL receptors. PCSK9 inhibitors also decrease Lp(a) levels. PCSK9 inhibitors are very useful when maximally tolerated statin therapy does not reduce LDL sufficiently and in statin intolerant patients. PCSK9 inhibitors have very few side effects. Mipomersen and lomitapide are approved for lowering LDL levels in patients with Homozygous Familiar Hypercholesterolemia. Mipomersen is a second generation apolipoprotein anti-sense oligonucleotide that decreases apolipoprotein B synthesis resulting in a reduction in the formation and synthesis of VLDL. Lomitapide inhibits microsomal triglyceride transfer protein decreasing the formation of chylomicrons in the intestine and VLDL in the liver. Both mipomersen and lomitapide have the potential to cause liver toxicity and therefore they were approved with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) to reduce risk.

    "13": "Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a prevalent, autosomal dominant disorder of lipid metabolism that results in elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and premature atherosclerosis. Screening for and identifying heterozygous FH in childhood is critical, given its high prevalence and asymptomatic presentation. Furthermore, treatment of FH in childhood is effective at lowering LDL-C levels and has the potential to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events in adulthood. Selective screening based on family history criteria had previously been recommended to identify children and adolescents with FH or other lipid disorders. However, studies indicated that many heterozygous FH individuals were missed with this approach, and therefore in 2011, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Expert Panel recommended universal screening of children and adolescents between ages 9 and 11 years and again at ages 17 to 21 years, in addition to selective screening, in order to identify pediatric individuals with heterozygous FH. Once FH is diagnosed, prompt treatment with lifestyle modification should be initiated. When lifestyle interventions are not sufficient, pharmacotherapy using statins has been shown to be effective at lowering LDL-C, generally safe in short and medium term studies, and may be beneficial at reducing ASCVD events. Other medications may be useful at lowering LDL-C in conjunction with statin therapy, although generally statins are sufficient in young patients. Homozygous FH is a rare disorder manifesting as extremely high LDL-C and ASCVD in childhood, requiring aggressive multimodal management. Overall, studies are needed to determine the optimal timing and intensity of statin therapy, and to better understand long-term safety and ASCVD outcomes in adulthood for lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy initiated in pediatric patients with heterozygous FH.

    "14": "It is well established that endothelial injury plays an essential role in atherosclerotic plaque formation. Accumulating evidence has shown that high glucose levels may detrimentally affect cultured endothelial cells through endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In this study, we investigated the effect of rosuvastatin on high glucose-induced ER stress in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). HUVECs treated with 30 mM glucose were used to simulate high-glucose conditions, and rosuvastatin concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 nM were used. Cell viability was analyzed by thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide assay, and apoptosis rate was measured using flow cytometry. Expression of GRP78, IRE1\u03b1, XBP1s, and CHOP was quantified using western blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Compared to cells treated with high glucose alone, cell viability increased and apoptosis rate decreased significantly in the rosuvastatin + high-glucose groups. Furthermore, GRP78, IRE1\u03b1, XBP1s, and CHOP expression was downregulated as a result of rosuvastatin administration. These results suggest that rosuvastatin may protect HUVECs from injury induced by high glucose levels, through alleviation of ER stress.",

    "16": "Two hundred forty-two consecutive morbidly obese patients were recruited to this prospective study. Histological analysis of liver biopsy to diagnose NAFLD was performed. Bile sample was taken during the LRYGB. Associations of GD with serum non-cholesterol sterol to cholesterol ratios, measured using gas liquid chromatography and with mRNA expression of genes participating in the cholesterol, bile, and fatty acid metabolism in the liver, were analyzed.",

Serum plant sterols, campesterol (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), sitosterol (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), and avenasterol (p\u00a0=\u00a00.015), were lower in patients with GD compared to those without GD. This association remained significant after adjustment for NAFLD, use of statin medication, and previous laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LCC). Levels of sitosterol (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and campesterol (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) remained lower in obese individuals with GD also after obesity surgery. Liver mRNA expression of genes regulating cholesterol synthesis and bile metabolism was increased in individuals with GD.", 
    "18": "Serum plant sterols were lower in patients with GD independent of NAFLD, history of LCC, use of statin medication, and weight loss after LRYGB. Low serum plant sterols in patients with GD suggest potentially inherited alterations in sterol absorption and biliary transport in subjects susceptible for GD.", 
    "19": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is associated with a significant risk of cardiovascular mortality. The use of statins for lipid modulation and the prevention of cardiovascular disease in this population also may impart pleiotropic anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. Our aim was to identify studies that compared the use of statins and placebo or no statin therapy in patients with SLE.", 
    "20": "A meta-analysis was conducted on the follow-up measures of serum lipid levels, inflammatory markers, and disease activity, which was measured using the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score.

There was no change with statin use in serum levels of high-density lipoprotein and conventional C-reactive protein, and there was no difference in the SLEDAI score.", 
    "22": "The use of statins in SLE reduced the serum lipid and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, which suggests a role for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Statins did not affect the SLEDAI score, and therefore their use for modifying SLE disease activity levels is not presently supported.",

    "24": "It is fundamental to identify patients at risk for AKI as soon as possible and as accurately as possible. In order to achieve these goals, translational approaches implementing new biomarkers have shown promising results. Focusing on the role of potential preventive strategies, hemodynamic stabilization is the most important intervention with proven efficacy. Recent published data undermined any hope that high-dose statin therapy in statin-na\u00efve patients could exert renoprotective effects. However, preliminary data revealed the renoprotective activity of dexmedetomidine when used as a sedative agent. Moreover, several studies demonstrated the protective effects of remote ischemic preconditioning in various organs including the kidneys. The use of balanced crystalloid instead of hyperchloremic solutions also contributes to the reduction of AKI in critically ill patients.", 
    "25": "To prevent AKI, it is crucial to identify patients at risk as early as possible. Establishing hemodynamic stability and an adequate intravascular volume state to ensure a sufficient perfusion pressure is the only effective therapeutic intervention. It is self-evident that nephrotoxic agents should be avoided whenever it is possible.",

Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were measured before breakfast on day 1. Glucose variability, mean glucose level (MGL), mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE), mean of daily differences (MODD) in glucose levels and area under the postprandial plasma glucose curve (AUCPP) were measured on days 2 and 3. Plasma oxidant capacity against N,N-diethylparaphenylenediamine was measured with the diacron-reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROMs) test on day 1.",

RC is anti-hyperlipidemic drug with low oral bioavailability (20%) due to first-pass metabolism. Hot homogenization followed by ultrasonication method was used to prepare RC-SLNs with stearic acid, glyceryl behenate and glyceryl trilaurate as lipid matrices, egg lecithin and poloxamer 188 as surfactants. The prepared SLNs were tested for particle size, PDI, zeta potential (ZP), entrapment efficiency (EE), drug content and in vitro release. Further, PK and PD studies were conducted on selected SLNs. No changes in physical stability of the optimized SLN were observed at refrigerated and room temperature for 90days. SLNs prepared with glyceryl trilaurate having average size of 67.21\u00b11.71nm, PDI of 0.25\u00b10.01, ZP of -28.93\u00b10.84mV with 93.51\u00b10.34% EE was considered as optimized. DSC and XRD studies revealed that no interaction occurred between the drug and lipid. SEM and TEM studies revealed that SLNs were nearly spherical in shape. PK studies showed improvement in the oral bioavailability (extent of absorption) of SLNs by 4.6-fold when compared to that of suspension. PD study of SLNs in hyperlipidemic rats exhibited a decrease in lipid profile for 36h, while a suspension exhibited for 24h.", 
    "31": "Lipid nanoparticles and their multiple designs have been considered appealing nanocarrier systems. Bringing the benefits of these nanosystems together with conventional coating technology clearly results in product differentiation. This work aimed at developing an innovative solid dosage form for oral administration based on tableting nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), coated with conventional polymer agents. NLC dispersions co-encapsulating olanzapine and simvastatin (Combo-NLC) were produced by high pressure homogenization, and evaluated in terms of scalability, drying procedure, tableting and performance from in vitro release, cytotoxicity and intestinal permeability stand points. Factorial design indicated that the scaling-up of the NLC production is clearly feasible. Spray-drying was the method selected to obtain dry particles, not only because it consists of a single step procedure, but also because it facilitates the coating process of NLC with different polymers. Modified NLC formulations with the polymers allowed obtaining distinct release mechanisms, comprising immediate, delayed and prolonged release. Sureteric:Combo-NLC provided a low cytotoxicity profile, along with a ca. 12-fold OL/3-fold SV higher intestinal permeability, compared to those obtained with commercial tablets. Such findings can be ascribed to drug protection and control over release promoted by NLC, supporting them as a versatile platform able to be modified according to the intended needs.", 
    "32": "Statins, widely prescribed as cholesterol-lowering drugs, have recently been extensively studied for their pleiotropic effects on immune systems, especially their beneficial effects on autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. However, the mechanism of statin-induced immunosuppression is far from understood. Here, we found that atorvastatin promoted the expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) both in vitro and in vivo. Atorvastatin-derived MDSCs suppressed T-cell responses by nitric oxide production. Addition of mevalonate, a downstream metabolite of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, almost completely abrogated the effect of atorvastatin on MDSCs, indicating that the mevalonate pathway was involved. Along with the amelioration of dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) -induced murine acute and chronic colitis, we observed a higher MDSC level both in spleen and intestine tissue compared with that from DSS control mice. More importantly, transfer of atorvastatin-derived MDSCs attenuated DSS acute colitis and T-cell transfer of chronic colitis. Hence, our data suggest that the expansion of MDSCs induced by statins may exert a beneficial effect on autoimmune diseases. In summary, our study provides a novel potential mechanism for statins-based treatment in inflammatory bowel disease and perhaps other autoimmune diseases.",

    "61": "Statins induce apoptosis of tumour cells by inhibiting the prenylation of small G-proteins. However, the details of the apoptosis-inducing mechanisms remain poorly understood. The present study showed that the induction of apoptosis by statins in four different human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines, HSC-3, HEp-2, Ca9-22, and SAS cells was mediated by increased caspase-3 activity. Statins induced apoptosis by the suppression of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate biosynthesis. Furthermore, statins decreased the levels of phosphorylated ERK and mTOR by inhibiting the membrane localization of Ras and enhancing Bim expression in HSC-3 and HEp-2 cells. We also found that in all the cell types analyzed, the IC50 values for fluvastatin and simvastatin were highest in HEp-2 cells. In addition, HSC-3, Ca9-22, and SAS cells had higher Ras expression and membrane localization, higher activation of ERK1/2 and mTOR, and lower levels of Bim expression than HEp-2 cells. Our results indicate that statins induce apoptosis by increasing the activation of caspase-3 and by enhancing Bim expression through inhibition of the Ras/ERK and Ras/mTOR pathways. Furthermore, the sensitivity of HNSCC cells to statin treatment was closely related to Ras expression and prenylation levels, indicating that statins may act more effectively against tumours with high Ras expression and Ras-variability. Therefore, our findings support the use of statins as potential anticancer agents.", 
    "62": "Statin therapy is beneficial in reducing LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and cardiovascular events, but it is associated with the risk of incident diabetes mellitus (DM). Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is characterized by genetically determined high levels of plasma LDL-C and a low prevalence of DM. LDL-C levels seem then inversely correlated with prevalence of DM. Familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL) represents the genetic mirror of FH in terms of LDL-C levels, very low in subjects carrying mutations of APOB, PCSK9 (FHBL1) or ANGPTL3 (FHBL2). This review explores the hypothesis that FHBL might represent also the genetic mirror of FH in terms of prevalence of DM and that it is expected to be increased in FHBL in comparison with the general population. A systematic review of published literature on FHBL was made by searching PubMed (1980-2016) for articles presenting clinical data on FHBL probands and relatives. The standardized prevalence rates of DM in FHBL1 were similar to those of the reference population, with a prevalence rate of 8.2 and 9.2%, respectively, while FHBL2 showed a 4.9% prevalence of DM. In conclusion, low LDL-C levels of FHBL do not seem connected to DM as it happens in subjects undergoing statin therapy and the diabetogenic effect of statins has to be explained by mechanisms that do not rely exclusively on the reduced levels of LDL-C. The review also summarizes the published data on the effects of FHBL on insulin sensitivity and the relationships between FH, statin therapy, FHBL1 and intracellular cholesterol metabolism, evaluating possible diabetogenic pathways.",

The findings for prostate cancer, particularly advanced disease, are the most promising of all cancers studied. Use of these agents seems to also be associated with improved prostate- cancer-specific survival, particularly in men undergoing radiotherapy, suggesting usefulness of statins in secondary and tertiary prevention. Some study results might be influenced by increased PSA screening and health-conscious behaviour in statin users but these factors are unlikely to completely account for observed beneficial effects. The epidemiological evidence is supported by preclinical studies that show that statins directly inhibit prostate cancer development and progression in cell-based and animal-based models. The antineoplastic effect of statins might arise from a number of cholesterol-mediated and non-cholesterol-mediated mechanisms that affect pathways essential for cancer formation and progression. Understanding these mechanisms is instrumental in drug discovery research for the development of future prostate cancer therapeutics, as well as in designing clinical trials to test a role for statins in prostate cancer prevention. Currently, sufficient data are lacking to support the use of statins for the primary prevention of prostate cancer and further research is clearly warranted.

Insulin-resistant, hypertriglyceridemic, hypertensive, obese males were treated with pitavastatin (4 mg/day) for 180 days, resulting in marked reduction in plasma TGs (-41%) and LDL-cholesterol (-38%), with minor effects on HDL-cholesterol and apoAI. Native plasma LDL (baseline vs. 180 days) was oxidized by aqueous free radicals under mild conditions in vitro either alone or in the presence of the corresponding pre- or poststatin HDL2 or HDL3 at authentic plasma mass ratios. Lipidomic analyses revealed that statin treatment i) reduced the content of oxidizable polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine (PUPC) species containing DHA and linoleic acid in LDL; ii) preferentially increased the content of PUPC species containing arachidonic acid (AA) in small, dense HDL3; iii) induced significant elevation in the content of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) plasmalogens containing AA and DHA in HDL3; and iv) induced formation of HDL3 particles with increased capacity to inactivate PCOOH with formation of redox-inactive phospholipid hydroxide.

It also disrupted the function of the small GTPase RhoA and induced activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and p38 MAPK, with AMPK functioning upstream of p38 MAPK. Inhibitors of AMPK or p38 MAPK attenuated the induction of apoptosis by simvastatin, whereas metformin enhanced this effect of simvastatin by further activation of AMPK. Although treatment with simvastatin alone did not inhibit osteosarcoma tumor growth in vivo, its combination with a fat-free diet induced a significant antitumor effect that was enhanced further by metformin administration.

Other aspects of the cardioprotective HDL functionality include antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-thrombotic, vasodilatory, anti-infectious and antidiabetic activities. Over the last decades, wide interest in HDL as an athero- and cardioprotective particle has resulted in the development of HDL-C raising as a therapeutic approach to reduce cardiovascular risk. Several strategies to increase circulating HDL-C concentrations were developed that primarily included use of niacin and fibrates as potent HDL-C raising agents. In the statin era, inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein, infusion of artificially reconstituted HDL and administration of apolipoprotein A-I mimetics were established as novel approaches to raise HDL-C. More recently, other strategies targeting HDL metabolism, such as upregulation of apolipoprotein A-I production by the liver, were added to the list of HDL therapeutics.

Upon admission, the patient presented with muscle weakness and pain, a serum creatinine phosphokinase of 18 723 U/L, and a serum creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL. The atorvastatin dose was held and the patient was treated with intravenous fluids. The 2013 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association Blood Cholesterol Practice Guidelines recommend the use of moderate-intensity statins in patients older than 75 years to prevent myopathy. However, in clinical practice, aggressive statin therapy is often prescribed for significant coronary disease. Prescribing high-intensity statins for patients with advanced age, such as this case, may increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis and other complications. This case report suggests that providers should avoid or be cautious with initiating high-intensity atorvastatin in elderly patients over 75 years to minimize the risk of rhabdomyolysis.", 
    "117": "Lung cancer is the first cause of cancer death worldwide and the Hippo pathway transcriptional coactivators YAP/TAZ have a pro-oncogenic role in this context. In order to understand the mechanisms through which YAP/TAZ elicit their oncogenic role in different systems, many studies are focused on YAP/TAZ target genes involved in the regulation of cell proliferation/survival and migration. However, there is scarce evidence on the role of YAP/TAZ in microRNA regulation while there is increasing evidence supporting the role of microRNAs in the main oncogenic processes. Here, we showed that YAP/TAZ were able to regulate several microRNAs in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. In detail, we focused on a cluster of three oncogenic microRNAs (miR-25, 93 and 106b) hosted in the MCM7 gene that were overexpressed in lung tumors compared to normal tissues. In addition, similar behavior was observed in breast cancer and head and neck tumor casuistries, where they showed a prognostic role. In NSCLC cells, YAP/TAZ induced the transcription of the MCM7 gene and its hosted miRs, thereby promoting cell proliferation through the post-transcriptional inhibition of the p21 cell cycle regulator. Accordingly, p21 was maintained at low levels in lung tumors compared to normal tissues. Conversely, its expression was restored in NSCLC cells upon YAP/TAZ interference or upon treatment with the statin cerivastatin. In summary, we provide evidence for a novel mechanism of modulation supporting the protumorigenic functions of the YAP/TAZ factors through the modulation of a bioncogenic locus consisting of one gene and three hosted microRNAs.", 
    "118": "Statins are one of the most widely prescribed drug classes in the USA. This review aims to summarize recent research on the relationship between statin use and cancer outcomes, in the context of clinical guidelines for statin use in patients with cancer or who are at high risk for cancer.", 
    "119": "A growing body of research has investigated the relationship between statins and cancer with mixed results. Cancer incidence has been more extensively studied than cancer survival, though results are inconsistent as some large meta-analyses have not found an association, while other studies have reported improved cancer outcomes with the use of statins. Additionally, two large studies reported increased all-cancer survival with statin use. Studies on specific cancer types in relation to cancer use have also been mixed, though the most promising results appear to be found in gastrointestinal cancers. Few studies have reported an increased risk of cancer incidence or decreased survival with statin use, though this type of association has been more commonly reported for cutaneous cancers. The overall literature on statins in relation to cancer incidence and survival is mixed, and additional research is warranted before any changes in clinical guidelines can be recommended. Future research areas include randomized controlled trials, studies on specific cancer types in relation to statin use, studies on populations without clinical indication for statins, elucidation of underlying biological mechanisms, and investigation of different statin types. However, studies seem to suggest that statins may be protective and are not likely to be harmful in the setting of cancer, suggesting that cancer patients who already take statins should not have this medication discontinued.",

    "121": "Background The prognostic effect of multi-component cardiac rehabilitation (CR) in the modern era of statins and acute revascularisation remains controversial. Focusing on actual clinical practice, the aim was to evaluate the effect of CR on total mortality and other clinical endpoints after an acute coronary event. Design Structured review and meta-analysis. Methods Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), retrospective controlled cohort studies (rCCSs) and prospective controlled cohort studies (pCCSs) evaluating patients after acute coronary syndrome (ACS), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or mixed populations with coronary artery disease (CAD) were included, provided the index event was in 1995 or later. Results Out of n\u2009=\u200918,534 abstracts, 25 studies were identified for final evaluation (RCT: n\u2009=\u20091; pCCS: n\u2009=\u20097; rCCS: n\u2009=\u200917), including n\u2009=\u2009219,702 patients (after ACS: n\u2009=\u200946,338; after CABG: n\u2009=\u200914,583; mixed populations: n\u2009=\u2009158,781; mean follow-up: 40 months). Heterogeneity in design, biometrical assessment of results and potential confounders was evident. CCSs evaluating ACS patients showed a significantly reduced mortality for CR participants (pCCS: hazard ratio (HR) 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20-0.69; rCCS: HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.49-0.84; odds ratio 0.20, 95% CI 0.08-0.48), but the single RCT fulfilling Cardiac Rehabilitation Outcome Study (CROS) inclusion criteria showed neutral results. CR participation was also associated with reduced mortality after CABG (rCCS: HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.54-0.70) and in mixed CAD populations. Conclusions CR participation after ACS and CABG is associated with reduced mortality even in the modern era of CAD treatment. However, the heterogeneity of study designs and CR programmes highlights the need for defining internationally accepted standards in CR delivery and scientific evaluation.", 
    "122": "Statins may be causally associated with a decreased risk of venous thrombosis. If so, this could be a substantive breakthrough since statins do not increase the risk of bleeding and could therefore be used as a safer antithrombotic drug. However, scepticism exists on the observed reduction of venous thrombosis by statins, as it may have been confounded by healthy user effects or other biases. Areas covered: The main focus of this review will be the biases that may have arisen in clinical studies that investigated the relationship between statin use and risk of venous thrombosis. We also discuss the suggested causal association from a pathophysiological perspective. Furthermore, we integrate the knowledge from clinical and pathophysiological studies into a proposal for new study designs that are needed to sufficiently answer the question whether we can, and should, prevent recurrent venous thrombosis with statins. Expert commentary: A drug to prevent recurrent venous thrombosis in patients at risk of bleeding that does not induce bleeding and in which the number needed to treat for the prevention of venous thrombosis is sufficiently high, is a remedy that we should continue to look for, and for which statin therapy might be a suitable candidate.",

F105 is a combination of bergamot fruit extract (Citrus bergamia, BFE) and 9 phytoextracts selected for their ability to improve the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of BFE. In vitro F105 exhibited a synergistic inhibition of oxygen radical absorbing capacity, peroxynitrite formation, and myeloperoxidase activity. Following 12 weeks of F105 daily, no treatment-related adverse events or changes in body mass were seen. Statistically significant changes were noted in total cholesterol (-7.3%), LDL-cholesterol (-10%), non-HDL cholesterol (-7.1%), cholesterol/HDL (-26%), and apolipoprotein B (-2.8%). A post hoc analysis of 8 subjects with HbA1c > 5.4 and HOMA-IR score > 2 or elevated triglycerides revealed additional statistically significant changes in addition to those previously observed in all subjects including triglycerides (-27%), oxLDL (-19%), LDL/HDL (-25%), triglycerides/HDL (-27%), oxLDL/HDL (-25%), and PAI-1 (-37%). A follow-up case report of a 70-year-old female patient, nonresponsive to statin therapy and placed on F105 daily, demonstrated improved cardiometabolic variables over 12 weeks similar to the subgroup. In summary, F105 was clinically well-tolerated and effective for ameliorating dyslipidemia in subjects with moderate cardiometabolic risk factors, particularly in the individuals with HbA1c > 5.4%.",

Coronary artery bypass graft surgery was performed in 4.2\u00a0% of STEMI and 11.4\u00a0% of NSTEMI patients. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in STEMI patients than NSTEMI patients (7.7 vs 5.1\u00a0%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.007). Independent correlates of in-hospital mortality were advanced age, low blood pressure, and high Killip classification, statin-treated dyslipidemia and PCI within 24\u00a0h were favorable predictors for STEMI. High Killip classification, high heart rate, and hemodialysis were significant predictors of in-hospital mortality, whereas statin-treated dyslipidemia was the only favorable predictor for NSTEMI. In conclusion, patients with MI received PCI frequently (83.5\u00a0%) and promptly (door-to-balloon time; 66\u00a0min), and had favorable in-hospital prognosis (in-hospital mortality; 7.0\u00a0%).

Alirocumab, a monoclonal antibody to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by up to 62% from baseline in phase 3 studies, with adverse event rates similar between alirocumab and controls. We evaluated the effect of alirocumab on serum Lp(a) using pooled data from the phase 3 ODYSSEY program: 4,915 patients with hypercholesterolemia from 10 phase 3 studies were included. Eight studies evaluated alirocumab 75\u00a0mg every 2\u00a0weeks (Q2W), with possible increase to 150\u00a0mg Q2W at week 12 depending on LDL-C at week 8 (75/150\u00a0mg Q2W); the other 2 studies evaluated alirocumab 150-mg Q2W from the outset. Comparators were placebo or ezetimibe. Eight studies were conducted on a background of statins, and 2 studies were carried out with no statins. Alirocumab was associated with significant reductions in Lp(a), regardless of starting dose and use of concomitant statins.

Here, we show antitumor effects of statin on MM cells with HPI, through the interplay of the mevalonate and Hippo signaling pathways. Statin attenuated proliferation and migration of MM cells harboring NF2 mutation by accelerating YAP phosphorylation/inactivation. CD44 expression was decreased by statin, in parallel with YAP phosphorylation/inactivation. Importantly, we discovered that YAP/TEAD activated CD44 transcription by binding to the CD44 promoter at TEAD-binding sites. On the other hand, CD44 regulated Merlin phosphorylation according to cell density and sequentially promoted YAP transcriptional co-activator, suggesting that CD44 plays two pivotal functional roles as an upstream suppressor of the Hippo pathway and one of downstream targets regulated by YAP/TEAD. Moreover, the YAP/CD44 axis conferred cancer stem cell (CSC)-like properties in MM cells leading to chemoresistance, which was blocked by statin. Together, our findings suggest that YAP mediates CD44 up-regulation at the transcriptional level, conferring CSC-like properties in MM cells, and statin represents a potential therapeutic option against MM by inactivating YAP.",

In contrast, primary patency of two-stage (hazards ratio [HR] = 0.51; p = 0.024), but not one-stage fistulas (HR = 0.98; p = 0.95), was improved by all statins as a group, but not by individual drugs.",

Recent data indicates that simvastatin increases the risk of new-onset diabetes by impairing both insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. However, systematic evaluation of mechanistic pathways is lacking. We aimed to explore the effects of simvastatin on glucose uptake and underlying mechanisms using L6 skeletal muscle myotubes. We performed our experiments at basal and insulin-stimulated conditions, at normal (5.5\u00a0mM) and high (16.7\u00a0mM) glucose. We showed that simvastatin inhibited glucose uptake at all conditions. We also found out that pravastatin, another widely used statin with different physicochemical properties, did not inhibit glucose uptake. The effect of simvastatin was reversed with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate but not with farnesyl pyrophosphate, implying that reduced protein geranylgeranylation has a role in simvastatin-induced insulin resistance. Simvastatin also decreased phosphorylation of insulin receptor (IR), insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), AKT and glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2), and downregulated GLUT4. In conclusion, our data indicate that simvastatin decreased both basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake through inhibiting the critical steps in IR/IRS-1/AKT signaling cascade, and by hindering GLUT4 function and normal regulation of glycogen synthesis, contributing to insulin resistance.",

    "164": "Since the publication of the 2012 guidelines new literature has emerged to inform decision-making. The 2016 guidelines primary panel selected a number of clinically relevant questions and has produced updated recommendations, on the basis of important new findings. In subjects with clinical atherosclerosis, abdominal aortic aneurysm, most subjects with diabetes or chronic kidney disease, and those with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol \u2265 5 mmol/L, statin therapy is recommended. For all others, there is an emphasis on risk assessment linked to lipid determination to optimize decision-making. We have recommended nonfasting lipid determination as a suitable alternative to fasting levels. Risk assessment and lipid determination should be considered in individuals older than 40 years of age or in those at increased risk regardless of age. Pharmacotherapy is generally not indicated for those at low Framingham Risk Score (FRS; <10%). A wider range of patients are now eligible for statin therapy in the FRS intermediate risk category (10%-19%) and in those with a high FRS (> 20%). Despite the controversy, we continue to advocate for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets for subjects who start therapy. Detailed recommendations are also presented for health behaviour modification that is indicated in all subjects. Finally, recommendation for the use of nonstatin medications is provided. Shared decision-making is vital because there are many areas in which clinical trials do not fully inform practice. The guidelines are meant to be a platform for meaningful conversation between patient and care provider so that individual decisions can be made for risk screening, assessment, and treatment.",

Subpopulations of prostate cancer cells develop castration-resistance by obtaining the complete steroidogenic ability to synthesize androgens from cholesterol. Statin derivatives, such as simvastatin, inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis and may reduce prostate cancer incidence as well as progression to advanced, metastatic phenotype. In this study, we demonstrate novel simvastatin-related molecules SVA, AM1, and AM2 suppress the tumorigenicity of prostate cancer cell lines including androgen receptor-positive LNCaP C-81 and VCaP as well as androgen receptor-negative PC-3 and DU145. This is achieved through inhibition of cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration as well as induction of S-phase cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. While the compounds effectively block androgen receptor signaling, their mechanism of inhibition also includes suppression of the AKT pathway, in part, through disruption of the plasma membrane. SVA also possess an added effect on cell growth inhibition when combined with docetaxel. In summary, of the compounds studied, SVA is the most potent inhibitor of prostate cancer cell tumorigenicity, demonstrating its potential as a promising therapeutic agent for castration-resistant prostate cancer.",

Yet, there have been concerns of increased risk of diabetes with statin use. This study was aimed to evaluate the association between statins and new onset diabetes mellitus (NODM) in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) utilizing the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service claims database. Among adult patients with preexisting IHD, new statin users and matched nonstatin users were identified on a 1:1 ratio using proportionate stratified random sampling by sex and age. They were subsequently propensity score matched further with age and comorbidities to reduce the selection bias. Overall incidence rates, cumulative rates and hazard ratios (HRs) between statin use and occurrence of NODM were estimated. The subgroup analyses were performed according to sex, age groups, and the individual agents and intensities of statins. A total of 156,360 patients (94,370 in the statin users and 61,990 in the nonstatin users) were included in the analysis. The incidence rates of NODM were 7.8% and 4.8% in the statin users and nonstatin users, respectively.

However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms and therapeutic approaches to destabilize mutp53. Here, through high-throughput screening we identify statins, cholesterol-lowering drugs, as degradation inducers for conformational or misfolded p53 mutants with minimal effects on wild-type p53 (wtp53) and DNA contact mutants. Statins preferentially suppress mutp53-expressing cancer cell growth. Specific reduction of mevalonate-5-phosphate by statins or mevalonate kinase knockdown induces CHIP ubiquitin ligase-mediated nuclear export, ubiquitylation, and degradation of mutp53 by impairing interaction of mutp53 with DNAJA1, a Hsp40 family member. Knockdown of DNAJA1 also induces CHIP-mediated mutp53 degradation, while its overexpression antagonizes statin-induced mutp53 degradation. Our study reveals that DNAJA1 controls the fate of misfolded mutp53, provides insights into potential strategies to deplete mutp53 through the mevalonate pathway-DNAJA1 axis, and highlights the significance of p53 status in impacting statins' efficacy on cancer therapy.",

High expression of EGFL7 in EGFRvIII-positive glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) was determined to be a strong and independent risk factor for reduced life expectancy. EGFRvIII cells can secrete the EGFL7 protein to improve the activity of the \u03b2-catenin/TCF4 Transcription complex in EGFRwt cells, thus promoting their own EGFL7 expression.

After the mouse received the gene of interest (i.e., luciferase as the reporter or hOATP1B1) via hydrodynamic gene delivery (HGD) method, the expression was found to be liver-specific while alterations in the serum biochemistry and hepatocyte histology were apparently transient and reversible. The reporter activity was also detected in the plasma, but not in the blood cell in mice that received HGD, suggesting that the protein is probably released due to transiently increased permeability in hepatocytes by HGD. Using this delivery condition, the expression of hOATP1B1 was readily detected in the liver, but not in other tissues, of the mice receiving HGD for the transporter gene. Compared with the sham control mice, the uptake of pravastatin into the liver increased significantly in mice receiving hOATP1B1 wild type; the uptake parameters decreased consistently in mice expressing the 521T>C variant compared with that of the wild type control.

In the present study, the effects of cyclosporine A and rifampicin on recombinant cynomolgus monkey OATP-mediated pitavastatin uptake were investigated in pre- and simultaneous incubation systems. Pre-incubation with cyclosporine A, but not with rifampicin, decreased the apparent IC50 values on recombinant cynomolgus monkey OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated pitavastatin uptake. Application of the co-incubated IC50 values toward R values (1\u00a0+\u00a0[unbound inhibitor]inlet to the liver, theoretically maximum /inhibition constant) in static models, 1.1 in monkeys and 1.3 in humans, for recombinant cynomolgus monkey and human OATP1B1-mediated pitavastatin uptake might result in the poor prediction of drug interaction magnitudes. In contrast, the lowered IC50 values after pre-incubation with cyclosporine A provided better prediction with R values of 3.9 for monkeys and 2.7 for humans when the estimated maximum cyclosporine A concentrations at the inlet to the liver were used. These results suggest that the enhanced inhibitory potential of perpetrator medicines by pre-incubation on cynomolgus monkey OATP-mediated pitavastatin uptake in vitro could be of value for the precise estimation of drug interaction magnitudes in silico, in accordance with the findings from pre-administration of inhibitors on pitavastatin pharmacokinetics validated in monkeys.

Thus, we investigated the impact of simvastatin on airway inflammation and airway remodelling and the possible relationship of these processes to a simvastatin-induced autophagic pathway in mouse models of asthma.", 
    "218": "Ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized and challenged mice were treated with simvastatin and sacrificed. The autophagy-related proteins Atg5, LC3B and Beclin1 were quantified, as well as the autophagy flux in bronchial smooth muscle cells (BSMCs). The relationship between airway inflammation and the autophagic process was investigated.", 
    "219": "We show that simvastatin treatment mediates activation of autophagy in BSMCs, which is correlated with airway inflammation and airway remodelling in mouse models of asthma. Simvastatin increases autophagy-related protein Atg5, LC3B and Beclin1 expression and autophagosome formation in lung tissue. Simvastatin-induced autophagy is associated with increased interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and decreased IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 cytokines production in BSMCs, as well as reversed extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. In contrast, autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) eliminates the therapeutic effect of simvastatin.", 
    "220": "These findings demonstrate that simvastatin inhibits airway inflammation and airway remodelling through an activated autophagic process in BSMCs. We propose a crucial function of autophagy in statin-based therapeutic approaches in asthma.", 
    "221": "The purposes of this study were to clarify the amorphization by ball milling of atorvastatin calcium sesquihydrate (AT) and to analyse the change in dissolution kinetics.", 
    "222": "The amorphous AT was prepared from crystal AT by ball milling and analysed in terms of the changes of its physicochemical properties by powder X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), thermal analysis and infrared spectroscopy (IR). Moreover, to evaluate the usefulness of the amorphous form for pharmaceutical development, intrinsic solubility of the ground product was evaluated using a dissolution kinetic method.", 
    "223": "The XRD results indicated that crystalline AT was transformed into amorphous solids by more than 30-min milling. The thermal analysis result suggested that chemical potential of the ground AT are changed significantly by milling. The IR spectra of the AT showed the band shift from the amide group at 3406 cm(-1) with an intermolecular hydrogen bond to a free amide group at 3365 cm(-1) by milling. The dissolution of amorphous AT follows a dissolution kinetic model involving phase transformation.", 
    "224": "The initial dissolution rate of the ground product increased with the increase in milling time to reflect the increase in the intrinsic solubility based on the amorphous state.", 
    "225": "Although statins are well tolerated by most aged people, their potential carcinogenicity is considered as one of the biggest factors limiting the use of statins. The aim of the present study was to determine the risk of cancer in people aged over 60 years receiving statin therapy.", 
    "226": "A comprehensive search for articles published up to December 2015 was performed, reviews of each randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effects of statin mono-therapy with placebo on the risk of cancer in people aged > 60 years were conducted and data abstracted. All the included studies were evaluated for publication bias and heterogeneity. Pooled odds ratios (OR) estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the random effects model.", 
    "227": "A total of 12 RCTs, involving 62,927 patients (31,517 in statin therapy group and 31,410 in control group), with a follow-up duration of 1.9-5.4 years, contributed to the analysis. The statin therapy did not affect the overall incidence of cancer (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.94-1.14, P = 0.52); subgroup analyses showed that neither the variety nor the chemical properties of the statins accounted for the incidence of cancer in older people.", 
    "228": "Our meta-analysis findings do not support a potential cancer risk of statin treatment in people over 60 years old. Further targeted researches with a longer follow-up duration are warranted to confirm this issue.", 
    "229": "Lipid-lowering therapy is one of the cornerstones of cardiovascular prevention and is one of the most effective strategies in the secondary prevention of ischemic heart disease. Nevertheless, the current treatment of lipid disorders, together with lifestyle changes, fails to achieve the targets recommended in clinical guidelines in a substantial proportion of patients. PCSK9 inhibitors have demonstrated safety and efficacy in the treatment of dyslipidemia. Due to their ability to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, these drugs have recently been approved for clinical use by Spanish regulatory agencies, with the aim of reducing cardiovascular risk in selected patient groups.", 
    "230": "Simvastatin (SIM), a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme\u00a0A reductase inhibitor, has been reported to inhibit the activity of hepatitis\u00a0B virus (HBV), however, the mechanism underlying its antiviral function remains unknown. Minichromosome maintenance (MCM)\u00a07, a component of the MCM complex, has been reported to act as an important host factor aiding virus genome replication in host cells. The present study demonstrated that downregulation of MCM7 inhibited the expression of proteins transferred by adenoviral vectors. This suggests an association between MCM7 and viral DNA expression. Thus, the current study aimed to investigate whether SIM affected MCM7 expression. Notably, the results of the present study indicated that following exposure to SIM the protein expression levels of MCM7 in HepG2.2.15, a human HBV\u2011transfected liver cell line, was decreased. In addition, the HBV DNA replication in the cell line was suppressed. As quantitative polymerase chain reaction experiments demonstrated that SIM did not downregulate the mRNA expression level of MCM7, the current study further investigated whether SIM affects the translation of MCM7. Western blot experiments indicated that SIM improved the activation of eukaryotic initiation factor\u20112\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1), a protein synthesis initiation factor, and upregulated the upstream factors of eIF2\u03b1, protein kinase RNA\u2011like endoplasmic reticulum kinase, which is regulated by the liver kinase\u00a0B1 (LKB1)\u2011AMP\u2011activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway. These results indicated that SIM induced HBV downregulation via an MCM\u2011dependent mechanism, and SIM may inhibit MCM7 expression by increasing the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, which is mediated by the LKB1-AMPK signaling pathway.",

    "232": "OPTIMA II was a non-interventional, observational study conducted at a single center in the Russian Federation. Included patients were aged \u226518 years with stable angina who had received long-term (\u22651 month) statin therapy prior to elective PCI with DES implantation and who had participated in the original OPTIMA study. Patients received treatment for stable angina after PCI as per routine study site clinical practice. Study data were collected from patient medical records and a routine visit 4 years after PCI.",

    "235": "Overall, 543 patients agreed to participate in the study (90.2% of patients in the original OPTIMA study). The mean (\u00b1 standard deviation [SD]) duration of follow-up from the date of PCI to data collection was 4.42\u2009\u00b1\u20090.58 (range: 0.28-5.56) years. The frequency of MACCEs (including data in patients who died) was 30.8% (95% confidence interval: 27.0-34.7); half of MACCEs occurred in the first year of follow-up. After PCI, the majority of patients had no clinical signs of angina. Overall, 24.3% of patients discontinued statin intake in the 4 years after PCI. Only 7.7% of patients achieved a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goal of <1.8\u2009mmol/L. Key limitations of this study related to its observational nature; for example, the sample size was small, the clinical results were derived from outpatients and hospitalized medical records, only one follow-up visit was performed at the end of the study (after 4 years' follow-up), only depersonalized medical information was made available for statistical analysis, and adherence to statin treatment was evaluated on the basis of patient questionnaire.", 
    "236": "Long-term follow-up of patients who underwent PCI with DES implantation demonstrated MACCEs in nearly one-third of patients, which is comparable to data from other studies. PCI was associated with relief from angina or minimal angina frequency, but compliance with statin therapy and the achievement of LDL cholesterol targets 4 years after PCI were suboptimal.", 
    "237": "The availability of effective drugs targeting the major risk factors of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has reduced morbidity and mortality. Cumulative relative risk of CVD events can be reduced by 75\u00a0% with a combination of aspirin, a \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist (\u03b2-blocker), an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin), and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. The principal pharmacodynamics of these drugs cannot explain the entirety of their cardioprotective action, as other drugs with similar pharmacologic targets have not been associated with favorable clinical effects. This raises the possibility that the cardioprotective drugs have a unique pleiotropic activity that contributes to their clinical efficacy. Recent data suggest that reducing cellular stress such as oxidative, inflammatory, and endoplasmic reticulum stress, might be a common denominator of the drugs with proven efficacy in reducing CVD risk. In this communication, the evidence in favor of this hypothesis is discussed, and ongoing trials with therapeutic agents targeting cellular stresses are reviewed.", 
    "238": "We hypothesized that the additional administration of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) receiving statin has the potential to lower the serum pentraxin 3 (PTX3) level, an indicator of plaque stabilization.", 
    "239": "We randomly assigned CAD patients already receiving statin therapy to an EPA group (1800\u00a0mg/day, n\u00a0=\u00a053) or control group (n\u00a0=\u00a053).", 
    "240": "No significant difference was found in the change in the plasma PTX3 level between the groups. However, in a subgroup analysis, a significant percentage reduction in the plasma PTX3 level was observed in patients receiving strong statin compared with the patients receiving moderate statin in the EPA group (-5.6 vs. 14.7\u00a0%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0082), while no such difference in the percentage change in the plasma PTX3 level was noted between the two same statin subgroups in the control group. A multiple logistic regression analysis identified the addition of EPA to ongoing strong statin treatment as an independent predictor of PTX3 level reduction. Furthermore, even in patients with relatively well-controlled serum lipid levels, pretreatment with EPA added to ongoing statin therapy reduced serum non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins as residual risk factors.", 
    "241": "Through this study design, the results could not support the hypothesis that adding EPA in patients with stable CAD receiving varying degrees of statin treatment reduces the plasma PTX3 level comprehensively. However, addition of EPA to ongoing strong statin treatment, but not ongoing moderate statin treatment, may reduce the plasma PTX3 level, possibly leading to coronary plaque stabilization.",

However, it is uncertain whether this relationship extends to LDL-C levels <50 mg/dL. We assessed the relationship between additional LDL-C, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B100 reductions and MACE among patients within the ODYSSEY trials that compared alirocumab with controls (placebo/ezetimibe), mainly as add-on therapy to maximally tolerated statin.",

This analysis included 4974 patients (3182 taking alirocumab, 1174 taking placebo, 618 taking ezetimibe). In a post hoc analysis, the relationship between average on-treatment lipid levels and percent reductions in lipids from baseline were correlated with MACE (coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or unstable angina requiring hospitalization) in multivariable analyses.",

In total, 104 patients experienced MACE (median time to event, 36 weeks). For every 39 mg/dL lower achieved LDL-C, the risk of MACE appeared to be 24% lower (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-0.91; P=0.0025). Percent reductions in LDL-C from baseline were inversely correlated with MACE rates (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.57-0.89 per additional 50% reduction from baseline; P=0.003). Strengths of association materially similar to those described for LDL-C were observed with achieved non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B100 levels or percentage reductions.",

Its frequent use has been seen as one of the most important elements for the reduction of cardiovascular mortality in developed countries. However, the recurrent incidence of muscle symptoms in statin users raised the possibility of causal association, leading to a disease entity known as statin associated muscle symptoms (SAMS). Mechanistic studies and clinical trials, specifically designed for the study of SAMS have allowed a deeper understanding of the natural history and accurate incidence. This set of information becomes essential to avoid an unnecessary risk of severe forms of SAMS. At the same time, this concrete understanding of SAMS prevents overdiagnosis and an inadequate suspension of one of the most powerful prevention strategies of our times. In this context, the Luso-Latin American Consortium gathered all available information on the subject and presents them in detail in this document as the basis for the identification and management of SAMS.",

In the present study, oxygen\u2011glucose deprivation (OGD)/reperfusion\u2011stimulated. RAW264.7 murine macrophages served as a model of I/R injury. The knockdown of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor\u2011\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) expression in these cells increased OGD/reperfusion\u2011induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), tumor necrosis factor\u2011\u03b1 (TNF\u2011\u03b1) and interferon\u2011\u03b3 (IFN\u2011\u03b3), and enhanced OGD/reperfusion\u2011induced downregulation of the expression of cluster of differentiation (CD) 206, at the mRNA and protein levels. Conversely, overexpression of PPAR\u03b3 significantly attenuated OGD/reperfusion\u2011induced alterations in the expression of iNOS, TNF\u2011\u03b1, IFN\u2011\u03b3 and CD206 at the mRNA and protein levels.
