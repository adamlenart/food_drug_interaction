    "5": "Transformation of thyroid cells with either K-ras or H-ras viral oncogenes produces cell types with different phenotype and different response to the inhibition of the prenylation pathway by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase or farnesyltransferase inhibitors. These inhibitors induce apoptosis in K-ras-transformed FRTL-5 cells (FRTL-5-K-Ras) whereas cell cycle arrest is induced in H-ras-transformed FRTL-5 (FRTL-5-H-Ras). In FRTL-5-K-Ras cells, the product of K-ras gene is implicated in the scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the activation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 kinases. We observed that lovastatin blocked ras activation through inhibition of farnesylation and induced apoptosis, increasing ROS levels through inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling and Mn-SOD expression. Lovastatin-induced apoptosis was due to intracellular ROS increase since both, the antioxidant compound pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate or the SOD-mimetic compound, antagonized apoptosis. Moreover, both p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor kappaB pathways, activated as a consequence of high ROS levels, are involved in the apoptotic effect, indicating that cell death induced by lovastatin was dependent on oxidative stress. Lovastatin antitumor efficacy in K-ras-dependent thyroid tumors was further confirmed in vivo, proposing a new therapeutic strategy for those tumor diseases that are sustained by an inappropriate K-ras expression.",

Statins have been suggested to ameliorate pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); however, the mechanisms involved, especially their effects on progenitors, are largely unknown. Therefore, we examined whether pravastatin ameliorates hypoxia-induced PAH in mice, and if so, which type of progenitors and what mechanism(s) are involved.",

Furthermore, in vitro experiments demonstrated that hypoxia enhances differentiation of VEGFR2(+)/c-kit(+) cells into alpha-smooth muscle actin(+) cells. Importantly, pravastatin ameliorated hypoxia-induced PAH associated with a decrease in the number of BM-derived progenitors accumulating in the pulmonary artery adventitia. The expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and its ligand, CD18 (beta2-integrin), were enhanced by hypoxia and were again suppressed by pravastatin.",

Median total adiponectin levels were not significantly altered by atorvastatin treatment (6.0 vs. 6.2 microg/ml, P = 0.898).

Total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides decreased significantly (p < 0.0001), while high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) increased significantly (p < 0.0001) during the intervention. The mean decrease in IMT of the right and left common carotid arteries (CCAs) was 0.35 and 0.38 mm, respectively (p < 0.05 for each). Age and lipid profile parameters were significant predictors of change in CIMT in linear regression analyses after adjustment for established atherosclerosis risk factors.",

    "16": "Recent findings regarding the physiological transport mechanisms and metabolism of bile acids have led to an increased interest in their synthetic derivatives, especially as transmucous transporters. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of the synthetic sodium salt of monoketocholic acid (Na-MKHA) on the hypolipidemic activity of lovastatin. The effects of a 7 days administration of lovastatin (20 mg/kg b.w.) (experimental group 1, n=5) and a combination of lovastatin (20 mg/kg b.w.) and Na-MKHA (2 mg/kg b.w.) (experimental group 2, n=5) in group of healthy and diabetic male Wistar rats were investigated. The animals in the control group of healthy (n=5) and diabetic (n=5) rats were treated with physiological saline (10 ml/kg b.w.) per os twice a day. In the healthy rats, lovastatin increased the low density lipoprotein (LDL) (32.14%) and non-high density lipoprotein (HDL) (15.38%) cholesterol and decreased HDL cholesterol levels (9.89%), and also increased the investigated atherogenic ratios. Na-MKHA significantly potentiated lovastatin activity, and its effects on the LDL (p<0.05; 102.70%), HDL (p<0.01; 32.93%) and non-HDL (p<0.05; 65%) cholesterol levels, as well as the LDL/HDL (p<0.02; 231.11%), total cholesterol/HDL (p<0.02; 70.52%) and non-HDU/HDL cholesterol ratios (p<0.02; 167.12%). In diabetic animals, the potentiating effect of Na-MKHA was not significant. The stimulatory effect of Na-MKHA is probably a consequence of the intensified transmembrane transport of lovastatin due to the direct action of bile acids on the cell membranes, as well as a result of their enhanced transport via specific bile acid transport systems.", 
    "17": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of atorvastatin 10 mg compared with placebo in 2,838 patients with type 2 diabetes and no history of coronary heart disease who were enrolled in the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) and followed for 3.9 years. The percentages of patients experiencing treatment-associated adverse events (AEs), serious AEs and discontinuations due to AEs in the atorvastatin (n=1,428) and placebo (n=1,410) groups were 23.0% vs. 25.4%, 1.1% vs. 1.1% and 2.9% vs. 3.4%, respectively. The most common treatment-associated AEs in the atorvastatin and placebo groups were digestive system-related (8.9% vs. 10.0%). All-cause and treatment-associated myalgia were reported in 4.0% and 1.0% of atorvastatin-treated patients, and 4.8% and 1.2% of placebo-treated patients. An analysis of selected AEs by tertiles of baseline low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol showed no relationship between LDL cholesterol levels and the incidence of myalgia, cancer or nervous system AEs in either treatment group. Overall, these data demonstrate that atorvastatin 10 mg was well tolerated in patients with type 2 diabetes during long-term treatment.", 
    "18": "Arterial hypertension represents one of the most common conditions associated with an increased cardiovascular risk. New evidences support the need to adopt a global approach to the treatment of cardiovascular risk in hypertensive subjects by using drugs with proven benefits, not only for blood pressure control, but also for their pleiotropic effects. A greater understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms of hypertension would provide a better strategy for preventing and treating this condition. Angiotensin II seems to be responsible for triggering vascular inflammation by inducing oxidative stress, resulting in up-regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators that lead to endothelial dysfunction and vascular injury. The interaction of angiotensin II, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction might be a target of a new integrated approach with important clinical implications.", 
    "19": "Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) derived from bone marrow were isolated for the first time in 1997 and characterized. Recent evidence has indicated that EPCs contribute to re-endothelialization of injured vessels as well as neovascularization of ischemic lesions and that a decrease in the number of EPCs is an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular diseases. These finding suggest that EPCs play a major role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. Interestingly, the number and function of EPCs are regulated by not only various kinds of angiogenic cytokines and cardiovascular risk factors per se but also some interventions, including lifestyle modification (aerobic exercise, body weight loss, and smoking cessation) and pharmacological therapy (e.g., renin-angiotensin system inhibitor, statin, and erythropoietin). It is thought that regulation of the number and function of EPCs directly influences the maintenance and development of atherosclerosis. Therefore, it is clinically important to estimate the degree of EPC bioactivity and to increase the EPC bioactivity by appropriate interventions. In this review, we focus on the relationship between EPCs and cardiovascular risk factors and the role of EPCs in cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "20": "We studied a new teamwork-based teleconsultation model for treating patients with diabetes, where a specialist in diabetes care, a diabetes nurse and a patient attended by videoconference. The study series consisted of all the patients (n = 101) at three health centres in northern Finland whose care was provided by a single physician at a remote diabetes clinic. A total of 101 patients with diabetes (19 of type 1 and 82 of type 2) were studied at baseline and at 10-14 months after the first consultation. Mean HbA(1c) was 8.0% at baseline and 7.6% at follow-up (P = 0.007). The proportion of patients with poor glycaemic control decreased from 32% to 13%. Mean LDL cholesterol was 3.3 mmol/L at baseline and 2.7 mmol/L at follow-up (P < 0.001). The percentage of patients with optimum lipid levels increased from 20% to 50%. Mean systolic blood pressure was 146 mmHg at baseline and had decreased by 6 mmHg at follow-up (P = 0.004). The percentage of patients with poor blood pressure control decreased from 19% to 8%. The most common changes in medication were the introduction or modification of insulin treatment and the introduction of statin and antihypertensive drugs and acetylsalicylic acid. Although the study was uncontrolled, there were improvements in glucose and LDL cholesterol levels and blood pressure in patients who were managed by teleconsultation.", 
    "21": "Combinations of new medications or existing therapies are gaining momentum over monotherapy to treat central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS). Recent studies established that statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) are effective in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an MS model and are promising candidates for future MS medication. Another drug, rolipram (phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor) ameliorates the clinical severity of EAE via induction of various anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities. In this study, we tested whether combining the suboptimal doses of these drugs can suppress the severity of EAE. Prophylactic studies revealed that combined treatment with suboptimal doses of statins perform better than their individually administered optimal doses in EAE as evidenced by delayed clinical scores, reduced disease severity, and rapid recovery. Importantly, combination therapy suppressed the progression of disease in an established EAE case via attenuation of inflammation, axonal loss and demyelination. Combination treatment attenuated inflammatory T(H)1 and T(H)17 immune responses and induced T(H)2-biased immunity in the peripheral and CNS as revealed by serological, quantitative, and immunosorbant assay-based analyses. Moreover, the expansion of T regulatory (CD25(+)/Foxp3(+)) cells and self-immune tolerance was apparent in the CNS. These effects of combined drugs were reduced or minimal with either drug alone in this setting. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that the combination of these drugs suppresses EAE severity and provides neuroprotection thereby suggesting that this pharmacological approach could be a better future therapeutic strategy to treat MS patients.", 
    "22": "Pulmonary veins (PVs) are the most important focus for the generation of atrial fibrillation. The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) can reduce the occurrence of atrial fibrillation. The purposes of this study were to evaluate whether statins may inhibit the PV arrhythmogenic activity to prevent atrial arrhythmias from PVs and to investigate the link between fluvastatin, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity, mechanical activity, and electrical activity.", 
    "23": "Conventional microelectrodes and Western blot were used to record the electrical activity, diastolic tension, contractility and expression of Akt, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), and phosphorylated Akt and eNOS before and after the administration of fluvastatin in rabbit PVs or atria.", 
    "24": "Fluvastatin decreased the PV spontaneous activity, diastolic tension, and contractility, but did not change the action potential duration or resting membrane potential. The effects of fluvastatin on the PV firing rate and diastolic tension were attenuated in the presence of L-NAME (100 microM), wortmannin (100 nM), and ODQ (3 microM). Fluvastatin (1 muM) increased the phosphorylated Akt and eNOS, but did not change the total Akt or eNOS in the PVs and atria. In contrast, fluvastatin (1 microM) decreased the total nNOS in the PVs and atria.",

    "26": "Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) during exercise are associated with adverse prognosis, particularly in patients with intermediate treadmill test findings. Statin use reduces the incidence of resting ventricular arrhythmias in patients with coronary artery disease; however, the relationship between statin use and exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias has not been investigated.", 
    "27": "We evaluated the association between statin use and PVCs in 1,847 heart-failure-free patients (mean age 58, 95% male) undergoing clinical exercise treadmill testing between 1997 and 2004 in the VA Palo Alto Health Care System. PVCs were quantified in beats per minute and frequent PVCs were defined as PVC rates greater than the median value (0.43 and 0.60 PVCs per minute for exercise and recovery, respectively). Propensity-adjusted logistic regression was used to evaluate the odds of developing PVCs during exercise and recovery periods associated with statin use. There were 431 subjects who developed frequent PVCs during exercise and 284 subjects had frequent recovery PVCs. After propensity score adjustment, subjects treated with statins (n = 145) had 42% lower odds of developing frequent PVCs during exercise (odds ratio [OR] 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.93) and 44% lower odds of developing frequent PVCs during recovery (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.30-0.94). These effects were not modified by age, prior coronary disease, hypercholesterolemia, exercise-induced angina, or exercise capacity.",

There is now voluminous data to show that patients treated by vascular surgeons benefit from statins and that these medications do effect the natural history of atheroma, its consequences, and treatment. This article will attempt to summarize the more relevant data that highlights the beneficial effects of statins in patients with peripheral arterial disease and how use of these drugs affects cardio-, peripheral, and cerebrovascular risk.",

    "34": "Significant structural and inflammatory changes were noted in the AF group. Atrial tissue angiotensin II level was elevated and STAT1 and STAT3 were activated in the AF group. Nuclear translocation of activated STAT3 and binding to STAT3 consensus DNA sequence were also increased in the AF group. Rac1, the molecular target of statin, which mediates the activation of STAT3 by angiotensin II, was also activated in the AF group. The tissue levels of interleukin-6, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), which are known to activate STATs through membrane gp130 and JAKs, were not increased in the AF group. Membrane gp130 and JAKs were also not activated in the AF group.", 
    "35": "Activated angiotensin II/Rac1/STAT may be associated with or perhaps contribute to the structural and inflammatory changes in pacing-induced sustained trial fibrillation. It may further imply the therapeutic option of combination of angiotensin receptor blocker and statin.", 
    "36": "The aim of the prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled Tyrolean Aortic Stenosis Study (TASS) was to characterize the natural history and risk factors and their possible modulation by new-onset atorvastatin treatment (20 mg/day vs placebo) in patients with asymptomatic calcified aortic stenosis. Forty-seven patients without previous lipid-lowering therapy or indications for it according to guidelines at study entry were randomized to atorvastatin treatment or placebo and prospectively followed for a mean study period of 2.3 +/- 1.2 years. Patients' prognoses were worse than expected, with 24 (51%) experiencing major adverse clinical events, in most cases the new onset of symptoms followed by aortic valve replacement. In multivariate regression analysis, independent risk factors for worse clinical outcomes were aortic valve calcification, as assessed by multidetector computed tomography, and plasma levels of C-reactive protein. In univariate analysis, mean systolic pressure gradient or an increased N-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide plasma level allowed the prediction of major adverse clinical events as well, whereas concomitant coronary calcification, age, and the initiation of atorvastatin treatment had no significant prognostic implication. As shown in a subgroup of 35 patients (19 randomly assigned to atorvastatin and 16 to placebo), annular progression in aortic valve calcification and hemodynamic deterioration were similar in both treatment groups. In conclusion, TASS could demonstrate a poor clinical outcome in patients with asymptomatic calcified aortic stenosis which can be predicted by new risk factors such as strong AVC or increased plasma levels of CRP or NT-proBNP. The study does not support the concept that treatment with a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (20 mg atorvastatin once daily) halts the progression of calcified aortic stenosis.", 
    "37": "It has been suggested that statins could slow the progression of aortic stenosis (AS), but this hypothesis is still debated and has not been validated in large series of patients by long-term follow-up studies. Moreover, information about the role of statins in patients with different degrees of severity of AS is scarce. From our 1988 to 2007 echocardiographic database, we retrospectively identified all asymptomatic patients with aortic valve sclerosis (abnormal irregular thickening of the aortic valve with a peak aortic velocity [Vmax] > or =1.5 and <2 m/s), mild AS (Vmax > or =2 and <3 m/s), and moderate AS (Vmax > or =3 and <4 m/s), age > or =50 years, and with > or =2 echocardiographic studies > or =2 years apart. Exclusion criteria were moderate/severe aortic regurgitation, bicuspid aortic valve, rheumatic valve disease, and ejection fraction <40%. The final study population consisted of 1,046 patients (mean age 70 +/- 8 years, 587 men); 309 were treated with statins. Mean follow-up duration was 5.6 +/- 3.2 years (range 2 to 19). Progression of AS was slower in patients receiving statins compared with untreated patients in aortic sclerosis (0.04 +/- 0.09 vs 0.07 +/- 0.10 m/s/year, p = 0.01) and mild AS (0.09 +/- 0.15 vs 0.15 +/- 0.15 m/s/year, p = 0.001), but not in moderate AS (0.21 +/- 0.18 vs 0.22 +/- 0.15 m/s/year, p = 0.70). In multivariate analysis only statin therapy, initial Vmax, and dialysis were independently related to progression of aortic valve disease. In conclusion, in a large series of patients with long-term follow-up, statins were effective in slowing the progression of aortic valve disease in aortic sclerosis and mild AS, but not in moderate AS. These results suggest that statin therapy should be taken into consideration in the early stages of this common disease.", 
    "38": "Recent studies have reported a higher incidence of late stent thrombosis in patients undergoing drug-eluting stent (DES). Reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) is considered a risk factor for this complication after both bare-metal stent (BMS) and DES implantation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of DES on long-term follow-up in patients with LV dysfunction undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. We retrospectively selected all patients with an EF <45% undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with implantation of > or =1 sirolimus- or paclitaxel-eluting stent at our institution. The primary endpoint of the study was all-cause mortality, retrieved using both Social Security Database and hospital records. We also compared the results of this group with a historical cohort of patients with LV dysfunction undergoing BMS implantation; 121 patients who received > or =1 DES were enrolled. The mean LVEF was 36 +/- 8%, with 20 patients (16%) with a LVEF < or =25%; 36 patients (30%) had diabetes mellitus, and DES implantation was considered off-label in 100 patients (83%). Survival at 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow-up was 94% (95% confidence interval [CI] 88 to 100), 90% (95% CI 82 to 98) and 88% (95% CI 80 to 96), respectively. In conclusion, the favorable results of this study demonstrate the safety of DES in patients with LV dysfunction.",

In the simvastatin plus ezetimibe group, 95% of the patients reached the target level of LDL-C < 100 mg/dl. This percentage was significantly higher than in patients treated with fluvastatin alone (75%; p < 0.001). The greater effectiveness of simvastatin plus ezetimibe was more impressive when considering the optional goal of LDL-C < 70 mg/dl (75% vs. 32%, respectively; p < 0.001).

The animals received either atorvastatin (10 mg/kg), atorvastatin and the nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-inhibitor N-Nitro-L-Argininemethylester (L-NAME) (15 mg/kg), or vehicle. MCE was performed to assess the size of the perfusion defect and the myocardial signal intensities (A(max)) at the baseline, during occlusion, and during reperfusion. For comparison, the infarct size, risk area, and regional myocardial blood flow (MBF) were determined by the standard techniques as well.",

The infarct size-to-risk area ratio progressively increased during reperfusion and was markedly reduced in the atorvastatin group. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining confirmed a 23% reduction in the infarct size by atorvastatin. The infarct size by MCE correlated well with the histological methods (r=0.86, P < 0.001). A(max) was reduced in the anterior segments during LAD occlusion (0.08 +/- 0.01 dB) compared to the baseline (2.9 +/- 0.4 dB), approached higher levels post revascularization of LAD (3.22 +/- 0.50 dB), but decreased during 180 minutes of reperfusion (2.32 +/- 0.40 dB). After 180 minutes of reperfusion, A(max) in the risk area was significantly higher in the atorvastain-treated group compared to the vehicle-treated group (2.32 +/- 0.40 dB vs 1.3 +/- 0.4 dB, P <or= 0.05), indicating preserved MBF. The L-NAME-treated group showed no significant difference compared to the vehicle-treated group (A(max) 1.12 +/- 0.60 dB vs 1.3 +/- 0.4 dB).

Nine GPs and one cardiologist estimated a gain of more than 5 years of life from statin therapy. Cardiologists were more optimistic than GPs about relative risk reduction (P = 0.04). Only 50% of GPs and 68% of cardiologists were able to estimate an absolute risk reduction over 5 years, such estimates varying widely with no significant difference in responses between the groups (P = 0.2).

Epidemiologic and angiographic evidence from primary and secondary prevention studies involving several HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) indicate that decreasing elevated serum cholesterol concentration (specifically LDL-cholesterol) can reduce the incidence of CHD and/or progression of atherosclerosis and results in a decrease in associated morbidity and mortality. It has been estimated that each 1% reduction in LDL-cholesterol concentration may result in a 1% decrease in the incidence of CHD. Furthermore, an analysis of pooled data from primary and secondary prevention studies found that treatment with a statin for a median duration of 5.4 years was associated with a 31% and 21% reduction in the risk of major coronary events and total mortality, respectively.

We tested the hypothesis that variation in the chemokine gene CXCL5, which encodes epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide (ENA-78), is associated with ACS prognosis. We also investigated whether statin use, a potent modulator of inflammation, modifies CXCL5's association with outcomes and characterized the in vitro effect of atorvastatin on endothelial ENA-78 production. Using a prospective cohort of ACS patients (n = 704) the association of the CXCL5 -156 G>C polymorphism (rs352046) with 3-year all-cause mortality was estimated with hazard ratios (HR). Models were stratified by genotype and race. To characterize the influence of statins on this association, a statin*genotype interaction was tested. To validate ENA-78 as a statin target in inflammation typical of ACS, endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with IL-1beta and atorvastatin with subsequent quantification of CXCL5 expression and ENA-78 protein concentrations. C/C genotype was associated with a 2.7-fold increase in 3-year all-cause mortality compared to G/G+G/C (95%CI 1.19-5.87; p = 0.017). Statins significantly reduced mortality in G/G individuals only (58% relative risk reduction; p = 0.0009). In HUVECs, atorvastatin dose-dependently decreased IL-1beta-stimulated ENA-78 concentrations (p<0.0001). Drug effects persisted over 48 hours (p<0.01). CXCL5 genotype is associated with outcomes after ACS with potential statin modification of this effect. Atorvastatin lowered endothelial ENA-78 production during inflammation typical of ACS.

In human immunodeficiency virus infection, the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy has led to a shift from virus-related to drug-induced morbidity. The knowledge of these distinct syndromes allows rational management. In addition, an omnium-gatherum is presented with recent findings on drug-induced dermatomyositis, tendinopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and local myotoxicity. These latter topics are intended to direct attention to less familiar but still clinically relevant myotoxic events.",

These two treatments in combination further decreased infarct volumes (13.2+/-6.3%), and remarkably reduced the staining extents of Ox-42, and of inducible nitric oxide synthase. In addition, hypothermia alone was found to be effective when applied at 3 h after ischemia, but not when applied at 6 h. However, atorvastatin pretreatment and hypothermia led to a significant reduction in infarct volumes even when hypothermia was applied at 6 h.",

Thus, developing and discovering effective novel drugs with different molecular structures from conventional chemotherapy agents have become an urgent clinical need.",

    "83": "Morbidity from degenerative aortic valve disease is increasing worldwide, concomitant with the ageing of the general population and the habitual consumption of diets high in calories and cholesterol. Immunohistologic studies have suggested that the molecular mechanism occurring in the degenerate aortic valve resembles that of atherosclerosis, prompting the testing of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) for the prevention of progression of native and bioprosthetic aortic valve degeneration. However, the effects of these therapies remain controversial. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying the onset of aortic valve degeneration are largely unknown, research in this area is advancing rapidly. The signaling components involved in embryonic valvulogenesis, such as Wnt, TGF-beta(1), BMP, and Notch, are also involved in the onset of aortic valve degeneration. Furthermore, investigations into extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis, and osteogenesis in the aortic valve have been reported. Having noted avascularity of normal cardiac valves, we recently identified chondromodulin-I (chm-I) as a crucial anti-angiogenic factor. The expression of chm-I is restricted to cardiac valves from late embryogenesis to adulthood in the mouse, rat, and human. In human degenerate atherosclerotic valves, the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinases and angiogenesis is observed in the area of chm-I downregulation. Gene targeting of chm-I resulted in VEGF expression, angiogenesis, and calcification in the aortic valves of aged mice, and aortic stenosis is detected by echocardiography, indicating that chm-I is a crucial factor for maintaining normal cardiac valvular function by preventing angiogenesis. The present review focuses on the animal models of aortic valve degeneration and recent studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying the onset of degenerative aortic valve disease.", 
    "84": "Statins reduce cardiovascular disease risk and affect endothelial function by cholesterol-dependent and independent mechanisms. Recently, circulating (detached) endothelial cells and endothelial microparticles (EMP) have been associated with endothelial functioning in vitro and in vivo. We investigated whether simvastatin affects endothelial detachment and release of EMP. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated with clinically relevant concentrations of simvastatin (1.0 and 5.0 microM), with or without mevalonic acid (100 microM) or geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP; 20 microM) for 24 hours, and analyzed by flowcytometry and Western blot. Simvastatin at 1.0 and 5.0 microM increased cell detachment from 12.5+/-4.1% to 26.0+/-7.6% (p=0.013) and 28.9 +/- 2.2% (p=0.002) as well as EMP release (p=0.098 and p=0.041, respectively). The majority of detached cells was apoptotic, although the fraction of detached cells that showed signs of apoptosis (>70%) was unaffected by simvastatin. Detached cells and EMP contained caspase 3 and caspase 8, but not caspase 9. Restoring either cholesterol biosynthesis and prenylation (mevalonate) or prenylation alone (GGPP) reversed all simvastatin-induced effects on cell detachment and EMP release. Adherent cells showed no signs of simvastatin-induced apoptosis. Simvastatin promotes detachment and EMP release by inhibiting prenylation, presumably via a caspase 8-dependent mechanism. We hypothesize that by facilitating detachment and EMP release, statins improve the overall condition of the remaining vascular endothelium.",

Among patients assigned to ezetimibe, there were more, albeit not significantly more, deaths from cancer (97, vs. 72 in the control group; P=0.07), but there were also fewer, although not significantly fewer, other cases of cancer (216, vs. 254 in the control group; P=0.08). There was no evidence of a trend in the risk ratio for incidence of or death from cancer with increasing duration of follow-up.",

    "93": "Boosting low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels is a current strategy for preventing clinical events that result from cardiovascular disease. We previously showed that HDL(3) of subjects with coronary artery disease is enriched in apolipoprotein E and that the lipoprotein carries a distinct protein cargo. This observation suggests that altered protein composition might affect the antiatherogenic and antiinflammatory properties of HDL. We hypothesized that an intervention that increases HDL levels-combined statin and niacin therapy-might reverse these changes.", 
    "94": "HDL(3) isolated from 6 coronary artery disease subjects before and 1 year after combination therapy was analyzed by liquid chromatography-Fourier transform-mass spectrometry. Alterations in protein composition were detected by spectral counting and confirmed with extracted ion chromatograms. We found that combination therapy decreased the abundance of apolipoprotein E in HDL(3) while increasing the abundance of other macrophage proteins implicated in reverse cholesterol transport. Treatment-induced decreases in apolipoprotein E levels of HDL(3) were validated biochemically in a second group of 18 coronary artery disease subjects. Interestingly, the changes in HDL(3) proteome with niacin/statin treatment resulted in a protein composition that more closely resembled that of HDL(3) in healthy control subjects.",

Results from studies examining the association between statin use and reduced risk of prostate cancer have been encouraging, particularly in terms of advanced prostate cancer risk. These findings are supported by a strong foundation of scientific evidence demonstrating the potential cholesterol and non-cholesterol-mediated mechanisms through which statins may prevent prostate cancer. In this article, we analyze recent human data regarding the association between statins and prostate cancer, and the basic scientific data supporting the possible antineoplastic mechanisms of statins. We also address the issue of where to best direct future funding and research energies. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend all men to initiate therapy with a statin medication regardless of cholesterol profile, but the rationale to move forward with research is clear.",

Compared with the general population, dialysis patients suffer from an accelerated disease course that is, at least in part, resistant to conventional therapy. While there are a myriad of potential explanations for this resistance, derangements in lipid metabolism probably play an important role. Here, we discuss the significance of altered lipid metabolism in uremia, such as oxidative lipoprotein modification and the pathophysiology of adipose tissue; limitations of conventional approaches to dyslipidemia such as statin therapy and traditional lipid profiles; and areas of investigation with potential for new therapy, such as reverse cholesterol transport.", 
    "98": "Statin's treatment clearly is authorized in prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD). According to the results of many studies and meta-analyses statins can inhibit the first cerebrovascular infarct (stroke). The greater the decrease of LDL-cholesterol level the more prominent the efficacy. The effect is not so robust compared to coronary vessels moreover clear pleiotropic (cholesterol independent) action takes also part. It has been nowadays revealed that high dose (80 mg) atorvastatin can confine first time the development of recurrence stroke (SPARCL study), which is an important fact in the field of secondary prevention.", 
    "99": "Atherothrombosis of the coronary and cerebral vessels is understood to be a disorder of inflammation and innate immunity, as well as a disorder of lipid accumulation. From a vascular biology perspective, the processes of cellular adhesion, monocyte and macrophage attachment, and transmigration of immune cells across the endothelium are crucial steps in early atherogenesis and in the later stages of mature plaque rupture, particularly the transition of unstable plaque at the time of acute thrombosis. There is abundant clinical evidence demonstrating that many biomarkers of inflammation are elevated years in advance of first ever myocardial infarction (MI) or thrombotic stroke and that these same biomarkers are highly predictive of recurrent MI, recurrent stroke, diabetes, and cardiovascular death. In daily practice, the inflammatory biomarker in widest use is high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP); when interpreted within the context of usual risk factors, levels of hsCRP <1, 1 to 3, and >3 mg/l denote lower, average, and higher relative risk for future vascular events. Risk-prediction models that incorporate hsCRP, such as the Reynolds Risk Score, have been developed that improve risk classification and the accuracy for global risk prediction, particularly for those deemed at \"intermediate risk\" by usual algorithms, such as the Framingham Risk Score. With regard to cerebral vessels, increased biomarkers of inflammation, including hsCRP, have been associated with increased stroke risk as well as an increased rate of atherosclerosis progression in the carotid vessels. Although the proportion of variation in hsCRP explained by genetic factors may be as large as 20% to 40%, diet, exercise, and smoking cessation remain critical tools for risk reduction and CRP reduction. Statin therapy reduces hsCRP in a largely low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-independent manner, and the \"anti-inflammatory\" properties of these agents have been suggested as a potential mechanism beyond LDL reduction for the efficacy of these agents. The ongoing multinational Justification for the Use of statins in Primary prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial of 17,802 initially healthy men and women with low levels of LDL cholesterol but increased levels of hsCRP will help to define whether vascular protection can be achieved with statin therapy, even in the absence of hyperlipidemia. Targeted anti-inflammatory therapies are being developed that may provide a direct method of translating the biology of inflammation into new clinical treatments across multiple vascular beds. This article summarizes data supporting a role for inflammation in cardiovascular disease and offers the possibility that other disorders characterized by inflammation, such as periodontal disease, may have an indirect role by influencing the risk, manifestation, and progression of vascular events.",

It also studied the effect of atorvastatin in those with normal cholesterol. ASCOT concluded that reductions in cardiovascular events with atorvastatin were significant, and that amlodipine-based treatment prevented more cardiovascular events. The latter seemed to be due to better control of central blood pressure. Both statin and amlodipine-based treatments were cost-effective. According to the ASCOT study, it does matter how blood pressure is lowered.",

In the primary analysis, patients were observed until an event or significant non-adherence occurred, up to 3.5 years; in secondary analyses, maximum 3-month, 6-month and 1-year observation periods were used. The primary endpoint was the first inpatient admission due to a CV event after the end of the qualifying period; multivariate Cox regression analysis controlled for a variety of demographic and CV risk characteristics and statin type.",

In the primary Cox regression analyses, the CV event hazard rates for atorvastatin ranged from 0.899 (1-month qualifying period, p = 0.027) to 0.936 (3-month qualifying period, p = 0.33) versus simvastatin. Cox-based hazard rates for atorvastatin during 3-month to 1-year observation periods ranged from 0.908 to 0.915 for the 0-day qualifying period and from 0.851 to 0.884 for the 1-month qualifying period cohort (all p < 0.05); rates for the 3-month qualifying period cohort remained non-significant.",

Enhanced beclin 1 expression, a Bcl-2-interacting protein required for autophagy, has been used as a marker of autophagy. Beclin 1 was significantly increased at short times after HI, both in the hippocampus and in the cerebral cortex. Beclin 1-positive cells were found in the injured but not in the contralateral side and co-localized with MAP2 but not with GFAP or ED1, indicating that the protein is over-expressed in neurons. Beclin 1-positive cells were also TUNEL-positive. 3-Methyladenine and wortmannin, that inhibit autophagy, significantly reduced beclin 1 expression and switched the mechanism of the cell death mode from apoptosis to necrosis. Conversely, rapamycin, that increases autophagy, augmented beclin 1 expression, reduced necrotic cell death, and decreased brain injury. A prophylactic treatment with simvastatin or hypoxic preconditioning also increased beclin 1 expression. Taken together, these data indicate that autophagy is increased in neuronal cells after neonatal hypoxia-ischemia and suggest that over-activation of autophagic pathways represents a potential protective mechanism in the early stage of the brain injury.",

Four different treatment schemes have been evaluated at our institution, with only a discrete increment in survival when treated with carboplatin-vincristine and fluvastatin (CVF). Low-dose, continuous antiangiogenic treatment has been recently introduced in the treatment of cancer. Our objective was to determine tumor response to metronomic chemotherapy combined with an antiangiogenic drug and fluvastatin and to calculate the survival of pediatric patients with brain stem tumors.", 
    "108": "This was a phase II study. A magnetic resonance (MRI) study was made at inclusion and after the fourth course. Routine laboratory analyses were performed prior to each treatment scheme. Patients received four courses of chemotherapy every 28 days consisting of thalidomide alternating with fluvastatin every 14 days and combined with carboplatin and vincristine every 14 days followed by radiotherapy (56 cGy) and four more courses of the same chemotherapy. Toxicity was evaluated according to Miller criteria.",

The authors have previously shown that simvastatin is protective after ischemic cerebral injury in normothermic conditions. In this study they further examined whether treatment with simvastatin can reduce ischemic brain injury in a hyperthermic condition.", 
    "112": "Focal ischemic brain injury was induced by embolizing a preformed clot into the middle cerebral artery in rats. The authors initially examined whether treatment with simvastatin could reduce ischemic brain injury without or with hyperthermia. The infarct volume, edema, and neurological deficits were examined. They then studied whether simvastatin could reduce the perfusion deficits, damage to the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and degeneration of neurons in the ischemic injured brain.", 
    "113": "Simvastatin significantly reduced the infarct volume in both normothermic and hyperthermic conditions, compared with appropriate controls. Concomitantly, this treatment also significantly reduced neurological deficits and brain edema. Administration of simvastatin significantly decreased perfusion deficits, BBB permeability, and degenerated neurons.", 
    "114": "These studies suggest that simvastatin is an effective agent for ischemic brain injury not only in normothermic but also in hyperthermic conditions, which may be through the decrease of BBB permeability, degenerated neurons, and perfusion deficits.",

Two-month-old B2R knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were assigned to 4 treatment groups (n = 12-14/group): control (vehicle); nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) an NO synthase inhibitor; simvastatin (SIM), an NO synthase activator; and SIM+L-NAME. Serial echocardiography was performed and blood pressure (BP) at 6 weeks was recorded using a micromanometer. Myocardial eNOS and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK, including ERK, p38, and JNK) protein expression were measured. Results showed that (i) B2RKO mice had significantly lower ejection fraction than did WT mice (61% +/- 1% vs. 73% +/- 1%), lower myocardial eNOS and phospho-eNOS, normal systolic BP, and higher LV mass, phospho-p38, and JNK; (ii) L-NAME increased systolic BP in KO mice (117 +/- 19 mm Hg) but not in WT mice and exacerbated LV hypertrophy and dysfunction; and (iii) in KO mice, SIM decreased hypertrophy, p38, and JNK, improved function, increased capillary eNOS and phospho-eNOS, and prevented L-NAME-induced LV hypertrophy without lowering BP. We conclude that disruption of the B2R causes maladaptive cardiac hypertrophy with myocardial eNOS downregulation and MAPK upregulation. SIM reverses these abnormalities and prevents the development of primary cardiac hypertrophy as well as hypertrophy secondary to L-NAME-induced hypertension.",

Each treatment was administered for 8 weeks separated by a 6-week washout period. The primary outcome was morning peak expiratory flow (PEF). Secondary outcomes included forced expiratory volume in 1 s, asthma control questionnaire score, airway hyper-responsiveness to methacholine, induced sputum cytology and inflammatory biomarkers.",

Values for other clinical outcomes were similar between the atorvastatin and placebo treatment periods. The absolute sputum macrophage count was reduced after atorvastatin compared with placebo (mean difference -45.0 x 10(4) cells, 95% CI -80.1 to -9.7, p = 0.029), as was the sputum fluid leucotriene B4 (mean difference -88.1 pg/ml, 95% CI -156.4 to -19.9, p = 0.014).",

The change in sputum macrophage count suggests potential areas for investigation of statins in other chronic lung diseases.", 
    "127": "Osteosarcoma is characterized by a high malignant and metastatic potential, which points to the need for new therapeutic strategies to prevent cell metastasis. In this study, we show that statin-induced HMG-CoA reductase inhibition reduces cell migration and invasion in human and murine osteosarcoma cells, independently of the genotype. The statin-induced reduction of cell migration and invasion was independent of induction of apoptosis and was geranylgeranylpyrophosphate-dependent. The statin reduced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2, 9, and 14 and TIMP2 expression or activity in invading cells. Forced expression of MMP2 and MMP14 overcame the inhibitory effect of the statin on cell invasion, suggesting a role for these MMPs in invasive potential. We also investigated the mechanisms involved in the reduced MMP2 activity and cell invasion. Inhibition of JNK, but not ERK1/2 signaling, reduced MMP2 activity. Pharmacological or constitutive activation of JNK overcame the reduced MMP2 activity and cell invasion induced by the statin. The statin decreased JNK phosphorylation and c-Jun nuclear translocation, suggesting that HMG-CoA reductase inhibition targets the JNK-c-Jun signaling pathway. We showed that mevalonate or geranylgeranylpyrophosphate treatment prevented the statin-induced reduction in JNK phosphorylation, MMP2 activity, and cell invasion. Forced expression of a constitutively active form of RhoA increased JNK phosphorylation and overcame the inhibitory effect of atorvastatin on MMP2 activity and cell invasion. The data establish a link between RhoA, JNK, c-Jun, and MMP2 activity that is functionally involved in the reduction in osteosarcoma cell invasion by the statin. This suggests a novel strategy targeting RhoA-JNK-c-Jun signaling to reduce osteosarcoma cell tumorigenesis.", 
    "128": "IFNalpha is an immunostimulatory cytokine involved in the development of autoimmunity. Atorvastatin, a cholesterol-lowering drug, also possess immunomodulatory effects, being able to downregulate IFNgamma-induced MHC-II expression. In this study we evaluated the role of IFNalpha in monocyte differentiation to antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and the effect of atorvastatin during this process. Results showed that IFNalpha-treated monocytes differentiated into dendritic-like cells (IFNalpha-DLCs) characterized by a CD86(high), CD1a(low), MHC-II(high) and CD14(low) expression, consistent with the phenotype of mature DCs and with similar ability to uptake antigens and induce T cell responses to mature IL-4/GM-CSF-DCs. Interestingly enough, the presence of atorvastatin did not inhibit IFNalpha-induced HLA-DR expression, although this drug markedly reduced the ability of IFNalpha-DLCs to induce T cell responses. These results confirm the immunostimulatory role of IFNalpha by promoting the generation of APCs and provide new clinical applications of statins as modulators of autoimmune responses in patients with high pathological or pharmacological IFNalpha levels.",

Although adhesions have been recognized for more than 250 years, a uniformly effective method of adhesion prevention does not exist. In recent years, research has become more focused on understanding the biochemical and cellular processes involved in adhesion formation--a necessary step in the development of safe and effective means of adhesion prevention. Studies suggest that events critical to adhesion outcome begin within hours of an abdominal operation with the balance between fibrin deposition and degradation being of central importance. A pharmacologic agent administered at the time of surgery that could tip the fibrinolytic balance in favor of fibrin degradation without interfering with postoperative wound healing would be an ideal candidate in the prevention of adhesion formation. Further research into the molecular and cellular events that underlie adhesion formation is essential and undoubtedly will lead to successful adhesion prevention.",

The multivariable predictors of CHD were sex, age, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HT), and history of smoking. Serum total and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol were not independent risk factors for CHD in the current analysis. In addition, the effect of pravastatin was evaluated by subgroups in each risk factor using the interaction in a Cox model.

Patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), such as chronic heart failure (CHF), might benefit from the effects of statin therapy. However, one question that has not yet been answered and that may clarify the role of statins in CHF is whether statins prevent the development of CHF in patients with a low risk of CVD. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of adherence to statins on the incidence of CHF.",

To check its efficacy in lowering the carotid intima-media thickness, in 2002 a multicenter international trial called ENHANCE was started, in order to assess by ultrasound the regression of atherosclerotic plaques. The protocol tested the use of simvastatin 80 mg + placebo versus simvastatin 80 mg + ezetimibe 10 mg in 720 randomized patients. Both drugs were well tolerated. Combination therapy was associated with a larger reduction in LDL cholesterol, but there were no differences in the intima-media thickness measured at three sites in the carotid arteries, nor differences in cardiovascular events between the two groups in the trial. These results provoked disappointment of sponsors (Merck, Schering Plough) who, although the results of the trial were available since march 2007, delayed official communication of about 18 months. This led to speculations and rumors among media, American Government, cardiologic scientific associations, and consequences in the Ezetimibe market and at Wall Street. In particular, the American College of Cardiology didn't accept the communication of ENHANCE results to the Late Breaking Trial Session of the Chicago congress, diverting it to another secondary forum. In conclusion, the experience of the ENHANCE trial suggests to pharmaceutical companies, researchers, clinicians, scientific companies and media a deep meditation in order to avoid in the future similar problems in the management of results of medical research.",

Sixteen patients (8 men, 8 women; 10 Caucasians, 4 African Americans, 1 Hispanic, 1 Asian), aged 63 +/- 11 years (mean +/- SD, weight 92 +/- 31 kg) on atorvastatin (45 +/- 33 mg/day) were studied with and without supplemental vitamin D (800 IU/day for 6 weeks). Levels of vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxy(OH) and 25 OH-metabolites), atorvastatin (parent, OH-acid metabolites, lactone, and lactone metabolites), and cholesterol (total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol) were determined at 0.5, 3, and 10 h after dosing. Vitamin D supplementation increased vitamin D-25-OH metabolites (P < 0.0001) without increased 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D. Atorvastatin and active metabolite concentrations (P < 0.001) as well as LDL-cholesterol and total-cholesterol levels (97 +/- 28 mg/dl vs. 83 +/- 30 and 169 +/- 35 mg/dl vs. 157 +/- 37, P < 0.005) were lower during vitamin D supplementation.

The VKORC1 3673G>A genotype was the most important predictor of warfarin dose, with a partial R(2) value of 23.9%. Replacing the VKORC1 3673G>A genotype with VKORC1 diplotype did not increase the algorithm's predictive power. We suggest that three other single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (5808T>G, 6853G>C, and 9041G>A) that are in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with 3673G>A would be equally good predictors of the warfarin dose requirement. The algorithm's predictive power was similar across the self-identified \"race/color\" subsets. \"Race/color\" was not associated with stable warfarin dose in the multiple regression model, although the required warfarin dose was significantly lower (P = 0.006) in white (29 +/- 13 mg/week, n = 196) than in black patients (35 +/- 15 mg/week, n = 76).",

A history of hypertension was more prevalent in patients with corticosubcortical and basal ganglia microbleeds. Magnetic resonance imaging risk factors associated with one or more microbleeds were total WMH volume, subcortical WMH volume, and periventricular WMH volume. Total WMH volume and periventricular WMH volume were risk factors for corticosubcortical microbleeds and basal ganglia microbleeds.",

    "152": "The beneficial effects of statins in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) may be balanced by concerns that statins can depress production of ubiquinone (CoQ10), which serves as a component of mitochondrial energy production and an antioxidant. Accordingly, the effects of atorvastatin (ATO)-induced changes in plasma CoQ10 on BNP and oxidative stress were investigated. In 29 patients with CAD, the plasma levels of CoQ10 and BNP and urinary excretion of 8-iso-prostaglandin F2alpha (8-iso-PGF) were determined before and after 3-month treatment with ATO. Ten patients had received pravastatin and 10 patients fluvastatin, while 9 patients had not received any statin before ATO. There was a linear correlation between ATO-induced changes in total cholesterol and CoQ10 (r = 0.632, P < 0.01), and an inverse correlation between ATO-induced changes in CoQ10 and BNP (r = -0.497, P < 0.01). There was no significant correlation between ATO-induced changes in CoQ10 and 8-iso-PGF. Multivariate analysis revealed that ATO-induced decreases in plasma CoQ10 were significantly associated with increasing BNP levels. In conclusion, long-term treatment with ATO might increase plasma levels of BNP in patients with CAD when it is accompanied by a greater reduction in plasma CoQ10. However, ATO-induced decreases in CoQ10 might not increase oxidative stress.",

However, hepatotoxic events have not been widely published with ezetimibe or the combination agent simvastatin-ezetimibe. We describe a 70-year-old Hispanic woman who developed fulminant hepatic failure necessitating liver transplantation 10 weeks after conversion from simvastatin 40 mg/day to simvastatin 10 mg-ezetimibe 40 mg/day. The patient's lipid panel had been maintained with simvastatin for 18 months before the conversion without evidence of hepatotoxicity. A routine laboratory work-up 10 weeks after conversion revealed elevated serum aminotransferase levels. Simvastatinezetimibe and escitalopram (which she was taking for depression) were discontinued, and other potential causes of hepatotoxicity were excluded. A repeat work-up revealed further elevations in aminotransferase levels, and liver biopsy revealed evidence of moderate-to-severe drug toxicity. She underwent liver transplantation with an uneventful postoperative course. Her aminotransferase levels returned to normal by postoperative day 23, and her 2-year follow-up showed no adverse events. Ezetimibe undergoes extensive glucuronidation by uridine diphosphate glucoronosyltransferases (UGT) in the intestine and liver and may have inhibited the glucuronidation of simvastatin hydroxy acid, resulting in increased simvastatin exposure and subsequent hepatotoxicity. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of simvastatin-ezetimibe-induced liver failure that resulted in liver transplantation. We postulate that the mechanism of the simvastatinezetimibe-induced hepatotoxicity is the increased simvastatin exposure by ezetimibe inhibition of UGT enzymes. Clinicians should be aware of potential hepatotoxicity with simvastatin-ezetimibe especially in elderly patients and should carefully monitor serum aminotransferase levels when starting therapy and titrating the dosage.",

No convincing associations between the presence of depressive symptoms and use of antihypertensives, antiparkinsonism drugs, NSAIDs and tranquilizers/hypnotic/sedatives were demonstrated.", 
    "162": "The evidence in this study suggests a possible protective effect of statin use on depressive symptoms, and affirms a positive association between depressive symptoms and corticosteroid use, especially in the older elderly. Use of H(2) receptor antagonists was also associated with depressive symptoms, probably through their link with underlying dyspeptic syndromes.", 
    "163": "Many women of reproductive age are affected by polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a heterogeneous endocrinopathy characterized by androgen excess, chronic oligo-anovulation and/or polycystic ovarian morphology. In addition, PCOS is often associated with insulin resistance, systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, which, on one hand, lead to endothelial dysfunction and dyslipidaemia with subsequent cardiovascular sequelae and, on the other hand, to hyperplasia of the ovarian theca compartment with resultant hyperandrogenism and anovulation. Traditionally, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have been used to treat dyslipidaemia by blocking HMG-CoA reductase (the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis); however, they also possess pleiotropic actions, resulting in antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects. Statins offer a novel therapeutic approach to PCOS in that they address the dyslipidaemia associated with the syndrome, as well as hyperandrogenism or hyperandrogenaemia. These actions may be due to an inhibition of the effects of systemic inflammation and insulin resistance/hyperinsulinaemia. Evidence to date, both in vitro and in vivo, suggests that statins have potential in the treatment of PCOS; however, further clinical trials are needed before they can be considered a standard of care in the medical management of this common endocrinopathy.", 
    "164": "Diseases of the heart and vascular systems are the leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide. High-risk patients have been the focus of lipid-lowering trials and treatment guidelines, which recognize that more intensive reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is appropriate for a redefined, broader high-risk population. Lifestyle modifications and lipid-lowering drug therapy form the foundation of primary- and secondary-prevention programs for patients at moderate to very high risk. Evidence shows that despite the availability of effective agents, such as HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), many patients still do not achieve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals. Nurse-centered case management programs that support early and continued adherence with lifestyle and medical therapies have been consistently successful at improving the rates of achieving lipid goals in high-risk patients.",

Case 1 had an arthritis predominant undifferentiated connective tissue disease, which was treated with hydroxychloroquine for 4-5 years. She presented with a mottled, reticulated macular gray pigmentation involving the upper back and shoulders. Case 2 had a history of systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, treated with hydroxychloroquine for 1.5 years. She presented to the hospital for treatment of constrictive cardiomyopathy and was noted to have a blue macular pigmentation involving the right temple. The biopsies from both patients showed superficial dermal, yellow-brown, non-refractile and coarsely granular pigment deposition. A Fontana-Masson stain highlighted some of these granules, while the Perl's iron stain was negative. Rare, previous reports of hyperpigmentation indicate the presence of both melanin and hemosiderin in patients being treated with antimalarial medication. To our knowledge, this staining pattern for hydroxychloroquine has not been previously reported in the literature and supports that hydroxychloroquine, in addition to chloroquine, binds to melanin.",

Among the 3800 patients who did not receive statin therapy, the risk association between LDL cholesterol and cancer was represented by a V-shaped curve. Compared with patients whose LDL cholesterol was at least 2.80 mmol/L but less than 3.80 mmol/L, the risk of cancer, death from any cause or the composite outcome of cancer or death was greater among those with an LDL cholesterol level of less than 2.80 mmol/L (hazard ratio for cancer 1.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-2.52) and those with an LDL cholesterol level of 3.80 mmol/L or greater (hazard ratio for cancer 1.87, 95% CI 1.29-2.71). Using 3.8 mmol/L as a reference point, we found that the hazard ratio for cancer for every millimole per litre absolute change in LDL cholesterol was 1.54 (95% CI 1.19-1.99) among patients not using statins; the hazard ratio was reduced to 1.24 (1.01-1.53) for the entire sample (statin users and those not using statins). These associations persisted after adjustment for covariates and exclusion of patients with less than 2.5 years of follow-up.",

    "179": "The aim of the present systematic review is to present an overview of the evidence linking atrial fibrillation (AF), inflammation and oxidative stress, with emphasis on the potential of statins to decrease the incidence of different types of AF, including new-onset AF, after electrical cardioversion (EC) and after cardiac surgery. Observational and clinical trials have studied the impact of statin therapy on new-onset, post-EC or postoperative AF. Data from different observational trials have shown that treatment with statins significantly reduces the incidence of new-onset AF in the primary and secondary prevention. The data are insufficient to recommend the use of statins before EC. Finally, perioperative statin therapy may represent an important non-antiarrhythmic adjunctive therapeutic strategy for the prevention of postoperative AF.", 
    "180": "A rapid, sensitive and specific method has been developed for the determination of simvastatin in human plasma with ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Simvastatin and the internal standard (lovastatin) were extracted from human plasma with diethyl ether-n-hexane-isopropanol (80: 20 : 3, v/v/v), then separated on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (50 mm x 2.1 mm, 1.7 microm) with isocratic elution at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min. The mobile phase was composed of 85% acetonitrile and 15% water (containing 10 mmol/L ammonium acetate). Electrospray ionization (ESI) source was applied and operated in positive ion mode. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode with the transitions of m/z 419. 2 --> m/z 199.0 and m/z 405. 0 --> m/z 199.0 was used to quantify simvastatin and the internal standard, respectively. The linear calibration curve was obtained in the concentration range of 0.051 - 20.4 ng/mL. The lower limit of quantification was 0.051 ng/mL. The inter-day and intra-day precision (relative standard deviation) were less than 10%, and the accuracy (relative error) was within -2.7% - 0% calculated from quality control samples. The mean extraction recovery of simvastatin was 91.6%. The method was proved to be selective, sensitive, rapid and suitable for the pharmacokinetic study of simvastatin.", 
    "181": "Although the hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are widely used in atherosclerosis to reduce serum cholesterol, statins have multiple other effects, including direct effects on cells of the vessel wall. Recently, DNA damage, including telomere shortening, has been identified in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in human atherosclerosis. Although statins reduce DNA damage in vitro, the mechanisms by which they might protect DNA integrity in VSMCs are unknown. We show that human atherosclerotic plaque VSMCs exhibit increased levels of double-stranded DNA breaks and basal activation of DNA repair pathways involving ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) and the histone H2AX in vivo and in vitro. Oxidant stress induced DNA damage and activated DNA repair pathways in VSMCs. Statin treatment did not reduce oxidant stress or DNA damage but markedly accelerated DNA repair. Accelerated DNA repair required both the Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS)-1 protein and the human double minute protein Hdm2, accompanied by phosphorylation of Hdm2, dissociation of NBS-1 and Hdm2, inhibition of NBS-1 degradation, and accelerated phosphorylation of ATM. Statin treatment reduced VSMC senescence and telomere attrition in culture, accelerated DNA repair and reduced apoptosis in vivo after irradiation, and reduced ATM/ATR (ATM and Rad3-related) activity in atherosclerosis. We conclude that statins activate a novel mechanism of accelerating DNA repair, dependent on NBS-1 stabilization and Hdm2. Statin treatment may delay cell senescence and promote DNA repair in atherosclerosis.", 
    "182": "Recent evidence suggests that higher doses of statins could improve clinical outcomes compared to conventional doses, but whether this benefit is due to \"additional\" pleiotropic effects is uncertain. We tested the hypothesis that atorvastatin 80 mg/day would have beneficial effects on indices of matrix remodelling (matrix metalloproteinase-1, MMP-1, and its tissue inhibitor, TIMP-1) in high-risk cardiovascular disease. We studied 27 \"high-risk\" patients (inclusion criteria: severe triple vessel but rejected for by-pass for extensive coronary disease, severe effort angina after coronary artery by-pass and premature coronary disease with > or =3 risk factors) with an abnormal lipid profile despite atorvastatin 40 mg/day, at baseline and at 3 months after increasing the statin dose to 80 mg/day. Baseline results in patients were compared to 22 healthy controls. At baseline, patients had lower levels of MMP-1 compared to controls. When atorvastatin was increased to 80 mg/day, significant reduction in LDL-cholesterol was observed, whereas MMP-1 and TIMP-1 levels were increased. These, despite of atorvastatin 40 mg daily, 'high-risk' patients still demonstrated abnormal extracellular remodelling indices. Doubling the dose of atorvastatin resulted in significant improvement in extracellular remodelling indices.",

    "184": "A total of 968 patients treated with RT had information about medication use available. Of these, 23% had been taking using statins during RT. Progression-free survival (PFS) was determined by a biochemical failure definition of prostate-specific antigen nadir plus 2 ng/mL, clinical failure, start of androgen deprivation therapy, or death.", 
    "185": "The mean patient age was 68 years. The median radiation dose was 76 Gy. Of the patients, 29% underwent androgen deprivation therapy. The 5-year overall survival rate was 83%. The median PFS time was 7.8 years versus 6.4 years, and the 5-year PFS rate was 70% versus 59% in favor of the statin users (P = 0.03). The analysis by risk group demonstrated no significant statin effect in any of the three risk strata. Stratification by hydrophilic versus hydrophobic statin agents revealed similar results. Multivariate analysis revealed that T stage (P <0.0001), pretreatment prostate-specific antigen level (P <0.0001), and Gleason score (P = 0.0026) were significant predictors of PFS; however, statin use (P = 0.48), androgen deprivation therapy (P = 0.95), pelvic RT (P = 0.96), radiation dose (P = 0.13), age (P = 0.19), and year of treatment (P = 0.07) were not.", 
    "186": "Statin use did not affect PFS after adjusting for differences in treatment year and multiple prognostic factors. However, T stage, baseline prostate-specific antigen level, and Gleason score were critical determinants of prostate-specific antigen failure. These results did not differ when hydrophilic pravastatin was excluded.", 
    "187": "Statins elicit numerous favorable effects on central nervous system (CNS) injury, including inhibition of the rhoA/ROCK pathway. In the present study, we show that statins decrease acute astrocyte activation in CNS injury, and decrease chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) levels in astrocyte cultures as well as CNS injury. CSPG levels decreased by up to 45% in simvastatin-treated astrocyte cultures compared to control cultures. In simvastatin-treated animals, CSPG levels declined by 60% 8 days after brain stab injury, and by 62-64% 4 weeks after spinal cord injury (SCI). Glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) levels decreased in brain stab at 8 days after surgery/intervention, suggesting that statins produce a decrease in astrocyte activation. Attenuation of astrocyte activation may contribute to the decline in CSPG levels. However, there are likely other contributing factors, since GFAP levels were not a contributing factor in the decline of CSPG levels in astrocyte cultures. Robust locomotor improvements were not observed with any treatment. The numerous beneficial effects of statins on CNS injury render them an attractive candidate in the treatment of CNS injury.", 
    "188": "We examined the effects of intensive statin therapy in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) and previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) participating in the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 22 (PROVE-IT TIMI 22) and the Aggrastat to Zocor (A to Z) trials. Of the 8,655 patients enrolled in PROVE IT-TIMI 22 or A to Z, 640 (7.4%) had undergone CABG before enrollment. After a median follow-up of 2 years, compared with patients without previous CABG, those with previous CABG had a higher risk of cardiovascular death (6.2% vs 2.8%), myocardial infarction (14.2% vs 6.6%), and readmission for ACS (7.9% vs 4.4%, p <0.001 for all comparisons) but a lower rate of repeat coronary revascularization (22.7% vs 26.9%, p = 0.01). Compared with moderate statin therapy, intensive statin therapy appeared to decrease the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stoke, and readmission for an ACS (A to Z primary end point) to a similar extent in patients with (26.1% vs 21.6%, hazard ratio 0.84, p = 0.27) and without (13.9% vs 12.0%, hazard ratio 0.86, p = 0.016) previous CABG, although the decrease was not statistically significant in the previous CABG group, likely due to the small number of patients with previous CABG. In conclusion, compared with patients with ACS without previous CABG, those with previous CABG have a higher risk for adverse cardiac events and may derive similar benefit from intensive statin therapy."
