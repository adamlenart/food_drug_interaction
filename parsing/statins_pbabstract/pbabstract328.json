Cellular apoptosis was determined using phase-contrast and fluorescein microscopic observation with Hoechst 33342 staining. L6 rat myoblasts were treated with various statins and bezafibrate under various conditions. With statins only, skeletal cytotoxicity was ranked as cerivastatin > fluvastatin > simvastatin > atorvastatin > pravastatin in order of decreasing potency. Combined application of fibrates enhanced atorvastatin-induced myopathy, which causes little apoptosis alone. These results suggest that statins and fibrates synergistically aggravate rhabdomyolysis.",

    "8": "Rhabdomyolysis is a recognized adverse effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), commonly caused by their interaction with other drugs, such as azole antifungals, that inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme family. An objective causality assessment revealed that the adverse drug event was probable. Although drug interactions have been described for combinations of other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and azole antifungals, rhabdomyolysis likely caused by the interaction between simvastatin and fluconazole has not yet been reported. This case reinforces the importance of being vigilant for drug interactions, particularly in connection with commonly prescribed medications such as statins.",

    "10": "The aim of our study was to evaluate whether a single dose of cerivastatin at the time of admission of patients with unstable angina pectoris (UAP) or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (NQMI) can influence the serum level of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) 24 h later. Forty-four patients with rest chest pain and subendocardial ischemia on ECG were randomized to receive cerivastatin 0.3 mg at the time of admission (group C+) to standard therapy or to remain just on standard therapy (group C-). Blood samples for determination of troponin I (TI), CRP, IL-6 and IL-8 were collected at admission (entry level) and 24 h later (final level). Patients with non-physiological baseline levels of TI, as well as patients with progression to Q wave MI were excluded. All baseline, clinical and demographic data and final values of TI were comparable in the two groups. In patients treated with cerivastatin (group C+, n = 13) we observed decrease in the CRP level (-6.73 +/- 3.93 mg/L); on the other hand, in group C- (n = 17) the CRP level increased (+7.92 +/- 2.77 mg/L, p = 0.004). Similar differences were observed also in IL-6: in group C+ the level was significantly reduced as compared with the increase in group C- (-0.76 +/- 0.52 vs. 4.58 +/- 1.49 ng/L, p = 0.005). The level of IL-8 was not affected. Our results suggest that early treatment with cerivastatin can decrease the serum level of CRP and IL-6 in patients with UAP/NQMI; this might positively influence their prognosis. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to support this hypothesis.", 
    "11": "Recently, the idea was advanced that short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) may potentially regulate intestinal fat absorption. The aim of this investigation was to examine the effects of butyrate on the intracellular events governing the assembly of triglyceride-lipoproteins in enterocytes. To this end, differentiated human Caco-2 cells were exposed to 10 or 20 mmol/L butyrate for 20 h. The incubation of Caco-2 cells with butyrate decreased cholesteryl ester (P < 0.005) export in the basolateral medium, probably due to reduced activity of DL-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (P < 0.02), the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. Furthermore, a drop was noted in the protein expression of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (P < 0.03), concomitant with the inhibition of de novo apolipoprotein B-48 synthesis (P < 0.02) and triglyceride-rich lipoprotein output (P < 0.03). Our results support the hypothesis that SCFA can influence lipoprotein concentrations by limiting lipid release from the small intestine into the circulation.", 
    "12": "Ischaemic heart disease may present as a wide variety of clinical entities including unstable or stable angina pectoris, acute myocardial infarction, and occasionally heart failure. Chronic stable angina is a common condition and results in a considerable burden for both the individual and society. The goals in management are (i) treatment of other conditions that may worsen angina; (ii) modification of risk factors and treatment with medications for coronary artery disease to improve outcome; and (iii) effective relief of anginal symptoms. There are limitations to the methods available to risk-stratify patients, and the optimal treatment strategy remains unclear. The benefits of lifestyle modification cannot be over-emphasised, and appropriate attention to modifiable risk factors is paramount. The mortality benefit of lipid lowering treatment and antiplatelet therapy is well proved. However the evidence base for anti-ischaemic therapy is less rigorous, being based mainly on extrapolations from studies of acute coronary syndromes. Angioplasty has been shown to be more effective in relief of symptoms than medical therapy alone, but provides no mortality benefit. Coronary artery bypass surgery, however, has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with severe proximal coronary disease when compared with medical management alone.", 
    "13": "Although many studies have documented that reduction of plasma cholesterol levels decreases the risk of coronary artery disease, it remains the most common cause of death in the Western world. Current therapeutic options are effective in lowering cholesterol, especially in clinical trials, but clinical application is not optimized for many reasons. Dietary restriction for long-term management of hypercholesterolemia is helpful but usually insufficient to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to goal levels. Powerful drugs are available, but these are often insufficient to meet the clinical demands for cholesterol-lowering therapy. Phytosterols and phytostanols have been partially effective by providing some inhibition of absorption of cholesterol. Compounds that specifically and more effectively block intestinal absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol should provide a significant new agent for altering lipoprotein concentrations favorably. Ezetimibe is the first of this class of compounds that act at the gut epithelium to reduce cholesterol absorption in the milligram dose range markedly. Clinical studies indicate that ezetimibe effectively decreases LDL-C by 15 to 20% as monotherapy, with a favorable safety profile. Moreover, results from preliminary clinical trials indicate that ezetimibe given concomitantly with a statin provides additive efficacy. The combination represents a new approach to lipid management, achieving greater LDL-C and triglyceride reductions and greater improvements in HDL-C than statin monotherapy. This could offer another important option in clinical practice for management of hypercholesterolemic patients.", 
    "14": "Previous observations suggested that multiple ischemic lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) are common in acute stroke patients. We hypothesized that a source of these multiple lesions was the recurrence of ischemic lesions within a week after a clinically symptomatic stroke. We analyzed 99 acute ischemic stroke patients scanned within 6 hours of onset and at subsequent times within the first week. Ischemic lesion recurrence was defined as any new lesion separate from the index lesion. Recurrent lesions occurring outside initial perfusion deficit were termed 'distant lesion recurrence'. We estimated the hazard ratio (HR) of recurrence associated with clinical and imaging characteristics using log-rank test. Any lesion recurrence was found in 34%, with distant lesion recurrence in 15%, while clinical recurrence was evident in 2%. Initial multiple DWI lesions were associated with any lesion recurrence (HR, 2.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.65-10.29; p = 0.002) and with distant lesion recurrence (HR, 5.99; 95% CI, 4.05-64.07; p < 0.0001). Large-artery atherosclerosis was the most frequent stroke subtype associated with any lesion recurrence (p = 0.026). These results may indicate a prolonged state of increased ischemic risk over the first week and suggest DWI as a possible surrogate measure for recurrent stroke.", 
    "15": "Exercise intolerance (EI) is a frequent cause of medical attention, although it is sometimes difficult to come to a final diagnosis. However, there is a group of patients in whom EI is due to a metabolic dysfunction. McArdle's disease (type V glucogenosis) is due to myophosphorylase (MPL) deficiency. The ischemic exercise test shows a flat lactate curve. The most frequent mutations in the PYGM gene (MPL gene) in Spanish patients with MPL deficiency are R49X and W797R. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) II deficiency is invariably associated to repetitive episodes of myoglobinuria triggered by exercise, cold, fever or fasting. The diagnosis depends on the demonstration of CPT II deficiency in muscle. The most frequent mutation in the CPT2 gene is the S113L. Patients with muscle adenylate deaminase deficiency usually show either a mild myopathy or no symptom. The diagnosis is based on the absence of enzyme activity in muscle and the lack of rise of ammonia in the forearm ischemic exercise test. The mutation Q12X in the AMPD1 gene is strongly associated with the disease. Exercise intolerance is a common complaint in patients with mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) deficiencies, although it is often overshadowed by other symptoms and signs. Only recently we have come to appreciate that exercise intolerance can be the sole presentation of defects in the mtDNA, particularly in complex I, complex III, complex IV, or in some tRNAs. In addition, myoglobinuria can be observed in patients under statin treatment, particularly if associated with fibrates, due to an alteration in the assembly of the complex IV of the MRC.", 
    "16": "Antiretroviral-induced hyperlipidaemia is observed frequently and has raised concern about an increase in cardiovascular risk. However, HIV infection itself induces pro-atherogenic lipid changes, which may lead to an increased cardiovascular risk but are partly reversed by some antiretroviral regimens. Recent cohort studies have reported conflicting data on the change in the incidence of cardiovascular disease and the associated risk factors in HIV-positive patients. Switching patients with high low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol or very high triglyceride levels to antiretrovirals with a less pronounced effect on lipids is an option. Patients who are not eligible for this strategy should be considered for treatment with lipid-lowering agents. However, to date, no controlled studies showing a clinical benefit for the treatment of antiretroviral-induced hyperlipidaemia with lipid-lowering agents are available; for patients with several cardiovascular risk factors and pronounced hyperlipidaemia the use of a statin or fibrate is justified. In general, hyperlipidaemia due to antiretroviral therapy should not lead to undertreatment with antiretrovirals or overtreatment with statins or fibrates. Given the overall low number of cardiovascular events, an individualised approach seems adequate.", 
    "17": "We have reported that intermediate conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels (ImK) showed augmented expression in angiotensin II (AII) type 1 receptor-dependent manner in post-ischemic rat heart. ImK has tyrosine phosphorylation sequence in the C-terminus and motifs for NFkappaB and AP1 in the promoter. While statin inhibits AII-mediated vascular remodeling via anti-inflammatory effect independent of cholesterol lowering. To test the possible effect of statin on expression of ImK, Wistar-Kyoto rats received L-nitro-arginine methyl ester (LNAME: 1 mg/ml in drinking water) for 4 weeks in group L. While in L+P group, rats received both LNAME and pitavastatin (PTV: 1 mg/kg/day in drinking water). Temporal profile of ImK mRNA was examined by RT-PCR using specific primers for ImK.", 
    "18": "Long-term LNAME administration produced significant hypertension and resulted in marked microvascular remodeling characterized by medial thickening and perivascular fibrosis of coronary arterioles (100-200 microm in diameter). RT-PCR revealed significant up-regulation of ImK mRNA with two distinct peaks in L group in the early phase (days 3-7) and the late phase (4 weeks). PTV partially inhibited a rise in systolic blood pressure, but completely abolished the first peak of ImK upregulation (0.76 +/- 0.04 vs. 3.96 +/- 1.43 folds at day 7, p < 0.001). Co-treatments with PTV also significantly inhibited medial thickening and perivascular fibrosis. These findings indicate that statin inhibits microvascular remodeling induced by chronic inhibition of NO synthesis through the action independent of cholesterol lowering.", 
    "19": "In this pilot, randomized, double-blind study, we compared the effects of policosanol and lovastatin on lipid profile and lipid peroxidation in patients with dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus. After 4 weeks on a cholesterol-lowering diet, 36 patients were randomized to policosanol (10 mg/day) or lovastatin (20 mg/day) tablets o.i.d. for 8 weeks. Policosanol significantly (p < 0.001) lowered serum low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) (29.9%), total cholesterol (21.1%), triglycerides (13.6%) and the LDL-C/high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) (36.7%) and total cholesterol/HDL-C (28.9%) ratios and significantly (p < 0.01) increased HDL-C (12.5%). Lovastatin significantly (p < 0.001) lowered LDL-C (25%), total cholesterol (18%), triglycerides (10.9%) and the LDL-C/HDL-C (30.4%) and total cholesterol/HDL-C ratios (23.9%) and significantly (p < 0.01) raised HDL-C (8.3%). Policosanol was more effective (p < 0.05) than lovastatin in reducing both ratios and in increasing (p < 0.05) HDL-C. Policosanol, but not lovastatin, significantly raised the lag time (20.9%) of Cu+2-induced LDL peroxidation and total plasma antioxidant activity (24.2%) (p < 0.05). Both policosanol and lovastatin significantly decreased the propagation rate (41.9% and 41.6% respectively, p < 0.001), maximal diene production (8.3% and 5.7%) and plasma levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (9.7% and 11.5%, p < 0.001). Both treatments were well tolerated. Only one patient in the lovastatin group withdrew from the trial due to adverse events. In conclusion, policosanol and lovastatin administered short term to patients with dyslipidemia secondary to type 2 diabetes were effective in lowering cholesterol and in inhibiting the extent of lipid peroxidation. Policosanol (10 mg/day) was slightly more effective than lovastatin (20 mg/day) in reducing the LDL-C/HDL-C and total cholesterol/HDL-C ratios, in increasing HDL-C levels and in preventing LDL oxidation. Nevertheless, since this was a pilot study, further clinical studies performed in larger sample sizes of diabetic patients are needed for definitive conclusions.",

Although a large number of options exist within each class, by considering the above factors, the choice is narrowed to only 1-2 preferred options. These drugs should then be added to the P- or Personal-drug list. By only prescribing agents on the P-drug list, the prescriber will become more familiar with their closing, adverse effects, and interactions, resulting in improved patient outcomes. Also when a new drug becomes available, it clearly needs to be better for the patient in terms of these factors, before it is added to the P-drug list.", 
    "25": "Cardiovascular complications are the major cause of perioperative and late morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing major vascular surgery. This is related to the frequent presence of underlying coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD may be asymptomatic because of reduced exercise capacity due to pre-existing non-cardiac conditions like stroke or claudication. Careful preoperative evaluation of CAD and perioperative management with beta-blockers and statins may offer the physician a unique opportunity to improve patients' perioperative and long-term outcome.", 
    "26": "Histamine, prostaglandin E(2), and catecholamines have been demonstrated to regulate the innate and acquired immune responses. In this review, we describe one of the mechanisms common to the action of these agonists; the regulation of the expression of costimulatory adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 and B7 antigens on monocytes/macrophages. The specific receptor subtypes involved in the action of each agonist were H(2) for histamine, EP(2)/EP(4) for prostaglandin E(2), and beta(2) for catecholamines, all of which are coupled with adenylate cyclase via Gs protein. The regulation of the expression of adhesion molecules by these agonists in turn leads to the modulation of subsequent cytokine production mediated by cell-cell interaction under different stimuli. Histamine is synthesized in monocytes and T cells by the induction of histidine decarboxylase. The inducible histamine has different dynamics from that in storage granules of mast cells and basophils. Also, noradrenaline appears to be synthesized in lymphocytes. Thus, immune cells can produce histamine, prostaglandins, and noradrenaline by themselves and modulate the cell-cell interaction between monocytes and other cells. Some of the inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase were shown to bind to the ICAM-1-binding domain of LFA-1, reducing the interaction mediated by ICAM-1/LFA-1. The regulation of interaction mediated by adhesion molecules may provide a new target for controlling inflammatory and immune responses.", 
    "27": "Prophylactic administration of simvastatin has been shown to protect against brain damage and its long-lasting behavioral consequences in neonatal rats. To establish the drug treatment window, we evaluated the effectiveness of simvastatin administered at different intervals before and after stroke. Furthermore, we determined whether simvastatin affected endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) or inflammatory cytokines in brain tissue or cholesterol levels in serum.", 
    "28": "On postnatal day 7, male rats were subjected to hypoxia-ischemia (HI). The experiment included sham-operated controls and HI animals receiving daily saline or activated simvastatin (20 mg/kg) injections from postnatal day 1 to day 7 (HI-simvastatin 1-7 group), from postnatal day 4 to day 11 (HI-simvastatin 4-11 group), or from postnatal day 7 to day 14 (HI-simvastatin 7-14 group). The neuroprotective effect of simvastatin was evaluated at adulthood by means of behavioral and histological analyses. Cytokines and eNOS expression were assessed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting.", 
    "29": "Animals in both the HI-simvastatin 1-7 and HI-simvastatin 4-11 groups performed better than HI rats in either the T-maze or the circular water maze and showed significantly attenuated brain damage. Expression of interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA in cortex was significantly increased in HI but not in HI-simvastatin 1-7 animals. In the same brain area, simvastatin treatment did not affect the increase of eNOS expression observed after HI.", 
    "30": "These findings indicate that prophylactic but not delayed administration of simvastatin improves functional outcome in neonatal rat stroke. The reduced induction of cytokines suggests that the neuroprotective effect of simvastatin may be related to a dampening of the inflammatory response.", 
    "31": "High affinity uptake of serum-derived low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is accomplished through the LDL receptor in the liver. In mammals, thyroid hormone depletion leads to decreased LDL receptor expression and elevated serum cholesterol. The clinical association in humans has been known since the 1920s; however, a molecular explanation has been lacking. LDL receptor levels are subject to negative feedback regulation by cellular cholesterol through sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2). Here we demonstrate that the SREBP-2 gene is regulated by thyroid hormone and that increased SREBP-2 nuclear protein levels in hypothyroid animals results in thyroid hormone-independent activation of LDL receptor gene expression and reversal of the associated hypercholesterolemia. This occurs without effects on other thyroid hormone-regulated genes. Thus, we propose that the decreased LDL receptor and increased serum cholesterol associated with hypothyroidism are secondary to the thyroid hormone effects on SREBP-2. These results suggest that hypercholesterolemia associated with hypothyroidism can be reversed by agents that directly increase SREBP-2. Additionally, these results indicate that mutations or drugs that lower nuclear SREBP-2 would cause hypercholesterolemia.",

Pravastatin and fluvastatin achieved smaller reductions. In the 58 trials, for an LDL cholesterol reduction of 1.0 mmol/l the risk of IHD events was reduced by 11% in the first year of treatment, 24% in the second year, 33% in years three to five, and by 36% thereafter (P < 0.001 for trend). IHD events were reduced by 20%, 31%, and 51% in trials grouped by LDL cholesterol reduction (means 0.5 mmol/l, 1.0 mmol/l, and 1.6 mmol/l) after results from first two years of treatment were excluded (P < 0.001 for trend). After several years a reduction of 1.8 mmol/l would reduce IHD events by an estimated 61%. Results from the same 58 trials, corroborated by results from the nine cohort studies, show that lowering LDL cholesterol decreases all stroke by 10% for a 1 mmol/l reduction and 17% for a 1.8 mmol/l reduction. Estimates allow for the fact that trials tended to recruit people with vascular disease, among whom the effect of LDL cholesterol reduction on stroke is greater because of their higher risk of thromboembolic stroke (rather than haemorrhagic stroke) compared with people in the general population.",

We estimate that the combination (which we call the Polypill) reduces IHD events by 88% (95% confidence interval 84% to 91%) and stroke by 80% (71% to 87%). One third of people taking this pill from age 55 would benefit, gaining on average about 11 years of life free from an IHD event or stroke.

After simvastatin treatment, Cx40 remained depressed, but Cx37 recovered to 94% of the level found in non-cholesterol-fed animals (P<0.01).

The patient, a 30 cigarettes/day smoker, with family history of hypertension and high levels of trygliceride and cholesterol, was subsequently admitted to our Cardiac Rehabilitation Unit. Cardiac Rehabilitation Program was composed of cycle aerobic training 4 times/week, dietary education, psychologic support and therapy with pravastatin, aspirin, nitrate, enalapril, and carvedilol.

    "47": "Simvastatin hydroxy acid (1) is a well-known, potent HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Its lactone, simvastatin (commercial name Zocor) (a prodrug of 1), has been widely prescribed in the USA and throughout the world. In this work, collision-induced dissociation (CID) of the negative ion of 1 (m/z 435), a carboxylic anion, was analyzed in detail. The major fragmentation pathway of this ion is a novel de-esterification to form the negative product ions at m/z 319 and 115. The ion at m/z 319 undergoes further collision-induced rearrangements to form the negative ions at m/z 215, 159 and 85. Possible mechanisms of the de-esterification are discussed in terms of both charge-initiated and charge-remote fragmentations. The de-esterification of the negative ion of 1 and the rearrangements of the ion at m/z 319 are rationalized by charge transfer and negative-charge initiated fragmentation. This study deepens our understanding of collision-induced fragmentations of carboxylic anions with multi-functional groups. A comparison of the CID data for the negative ions of 1 and 5 (a major oxidation degradate of 1) indicates that the analysis of the CID data for 1 can serve as a basis for identification of oxidation degradation products or metabolites of 1. The analysis of the CID data for the negative ion of 1 also reveals the fundamental characteristics of the CID data for the negative ions of other statin hydroxy acids such as lovastatin (3) and pravastatin (4).", 
    "48": "Events leading to hyperactivity of human blood platelets are accompanied by an enhanced risk of atherosclerosis and arterial thrombosis. Lipoprotein disorders affect platelet functions, and hypersensitive platelets are observed in various stages of hyperlipidemia. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL), a circulating complex of lipids and proteins that is increased in hypercholesterolemia, enhances platelet function and increases sensitivity of platelets to several naturally occurring agonists. LDL sensitizes platelets via binding of apoB-100 to a receptor on the platelet membrane and via transfer of lipids to the platelet membrane. The receptor that mediates binding of LDL to the platelet and initiates subsequent intracellular signaling cascades has not yet been identified. Modification of native LDL generates a platelet-activating particle, and this interaction might contribute to the development of the atherosclerotic plaque. Lysophosphatidic acid is formed upon mild oxidation of LDL and is responsible for subsequent platelet activation induced by the modified LDL particle. Thus, LDL changes the functions of platelets via a broad spectrum of interactions.", 
    "49": "3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have several non-lipid-lowering actions; however, characteristics of their acute vasodilator effects remain to be elucidated. In this study, acute vasodilator effects of statins were examined in isolated rat blood vessels. After incubation with cerivastatin (1 microM) for 2 hours, acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxations were enhanced in the rat aorta. This effect was abolished by a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, L-NNA, and by a PI3 kinase inhibitor, LY294002. Western blot analysis showed that the extent of phosphorylation of Akt, an active form of Akt, was increased by cerivastatin while it was reduced by LY294002, suggesting an involvement of PI3 kinase/Akt-dependent activation of endothelial NOS. At higher concentrations (1-300 microM), both cerivastatin and fluvastatin, but not pravastatin, directly relaxed the blood vessels, regardless of the presence or absence of the endothelium. These relaxations were abolished by KCl and were significantly inhibited by an inhibitor of Kv channel, 4-aminopyridine. These results indicate that multiple mechanisms are involved in the acute vasodilator effects of statins, including augmentation of nitric oxide-mediated endothelium-dependent relaxations through the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway and endothelium-independent relaxations via Kv channel-mediated smooth muscle hyperpolarizations. These acute vasodilator effects of statins may account, at least in part, for their beneficial effects on cardiovascular diseases associated with impaired organ blood flow.", 
    "50": "This study was designed to investigate the potential antiatherosclerotic effects of the calcium antagonist amlodipine as compared with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor atorvastatin and the combination of both in ApoE*3-Leiden transgenic mice. Four groups of 15 ApoE*3-Leiden mice were put on a high-cholesterol diet. One group received 0.002% (wt/wt) amlodipine in the diet, which had no effect on plasma cholesterol levels. Another group received 0.01% (wt/wt) atorvastatin, resulting in a decrease of plasma cholesterol by 50% by a reduction in very low density lipoprotein production. The combination group received both amlodipine and atorvastatin. After 28 weeks, atherosclerosis in the aortic root was quantified. Treatment with amlodipine had no significant effect on atherosclerotic lesion area, whereas atorvastatin markedly reduced atherosclerosis by 77% compared with the control group. Atorvastatin also reduced inflammation markers. The combination of amlodipine and atorvastatin tended to reduce lesion area by 61% compared with the atorvastatin-only group; however, this effect did not reach statistical significance. Amlodipine treatment significantly reduced calcification in the lesions, whereas atorvastatin alone had no effect. The combination of amlodipine and atorvastatin resulted in a near absence of calcium deposits in the lesions. This study demonstrates that amlodipine treatment alone does not significantly reduce atherosclerotic lesion development. Atorvastatin was shown to have strong antiatherosclerotic effects, and cotreatment with amlodipine may potentiate the antiatherosclerotic effect of atorvastatin.", 
    "51": "This study was designed to test the hypothesis that fluvastatin preserves endothelium-dependent and nitric oxide (NO)-independent relaxations in arterial preparations from rabbits fed a high-cholesterol diet in the absence of any cholesterol-lowering action. Rabbits were fed a 0.5% high-cholesterol diet for 12 weeks and then fed the high-cholesterol diet with/without fluvastatin 2 mg/kg/d for an additional 8 weeks. Plasma total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations were not affected by fluvastatin treatment. Endothelium-dependent and NO-mediated relaxation elicited by acetylcholine and A23187 in both the thoracic aorta and femoral artery was impaired in the high-cholesterol group but not in the fluvastatin-treated group. Endothelium-independent relaxation elicited by sodium nitroprusside was similar among the 3 groups. Preincubation of thoracic aortas from each of the 3 groups with Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and indomethacin completely abolished the relaxant response to acetylcholine. In contrast, the maximal response to acetylcholine (1 microM) in femoral artery was only partially reversed in the presence of L-NAME and indomethacin. Fluvastatin treatment preserved the acetylcholine-induced L-NAME and indomethacin-resistant relaxation impaired in the femoral artery from the high-cholesterol diet group. These results suggest that fluvastatin treatment preserves endothelium-dependent, NO-independent function as well as NO-dependent function in absence of its lipid lowering-action.", 
    "52": "The accumulating evidence suggests that C-reactive protein (CRP) may have direct inflammatory effects on the vascular wall and that statin therapy may have important non-lipid anti-inflammatory effects confirmed by decreasing serum inflammatory markers, such as CRP. However, the effect of simvastatin on interleukin-6 (IL-6) release in cultured human monocytes was not investigated. DESIGN A prospective, human monocyte culture, simvastatin intervention study.", 
    "53": "Monocytes were isolated from blood of healthy volunteers by the Ficoll density gradient and stimulated by broad concentrations of CRP (1-20 microg/ml) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1-10 ng/ml) at indicated time points (0, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 24 h). Also 10-8-10-6 mol/l simvastatin was coincubated with cells in the presence of CRP and LPS. Measurements of IL-6 were performed from supernatants of cultured medium in duplicate, using a commercial assay kit.", 
    "54": "CRP and LPS induced the rapid release of IL-6, with significantly elevated levels in cultured supernatants at 4 h in the CRP group and at 2 h in the LPS group. The effects of CRP and LPS on IL-6 release of monocytes were dose and time dependent. A greater than 11-fold increase of IL-6 in the CRP group (20 microg/ml) and a greater than 26-fold increase in the LPS group (10 ng/ml) were observed at 24 h compared with the control group (945.7+/-98.3 pg/ml compared with 94.3+/-12.4 pg/ml and 1720.4+/-690.1 pg/ml compared with 70.1+/-16.7 pg/ml, P<0.001, respectively). However, 10-8-10-6 mol/l simvastatin inhibited significantly the production of IL-6 in monocytes stimulated by CRP and LPS in a dose-dependent manner, with the maximal inhibiting effect at a concentration of 10-6 mol/l (945.7+/-98.3 pg/ml compared with 180.9+/-31.2 pg/ml and 1720.4+/-690.1 pg/ml compared with 824.0+/-206.2 pg/ml, P<0.001 respectively).",

    "56": "To assess the time-dependent changes in renal function in relation to antioxidant and lipid-lowering effects of fluvastatin in hyperlipidemic renal transplant recipients, 20 patients were treated with fluvastatin 40 mg/d for 12 months, after failure of a dietary program. Plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and lipid profiles were evaluated in relation to serum creatinine and calculated creatinine clearances 18 months before and during the fluvastatin treatment. Mean baseline lipid values were: total cholesterol 318 mg/dL, triglycerides 212 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol 219 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 58 mg/dL, apolipoprotein A 176 mg/dL, and apolipoprotein B 145 mg/dL. During 12 months of treatment, fluvastatin produced consistent and significant reductions in total and LDL cholesterol (-18.4% and -24.1%), triglycerides (-17.7%), and apolipoprotein B (-22.7%) as well as an increase in HDL cholesterol (12.3%) and apolipoprotein A (9.2%). Plasma MDA levels decreased by 41.8% (from 3.5 +/- 0.3 to 1.8 +/- 0.1 nmol/mL, P =.00002). Creatinine clearance, which had been declining at a rate of 0.32 mL/min/month during the previous 18 months before treatment, progressively improved during treatment, giving a positive slope of the creatinine clearance, which increased by 0.35 mL/min/month, (P =.016; 53.3 +/- 4.2 mL/min vs 49.8 +/- 4.1 mL/min pretreatment). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that MDA was the parameter most closely associated with the variability in creatinine clearance. In conclusion, renal transplant patients with lipid abnormalities display renoprotective activity of fluvastatin, possibly due to its lipid-lowering and antioxidant effects.", 
    "57": "Rosuvastatin (Crestor; licensed to AstraZeneca, Macclesfield, UK from Shionogi, Osaka, Japan) is a new statin with pharmacologic characteristics that translate into selectivity of effect in hepatic cells and enhanced potency in 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibition. It is approved for use at doses of 10-40 mg once daily to reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and improve other lipid measures in dyslipidemic patients. In a dose-ranging study in mild/moderate hypercholesterolemia, rosuvastatin reduced LDL cholesterol by 52-63% at 10-40 mg. Rosuvastatin 10 mg reduces LDL cholesterol significantly more than atorvastatin 10 mg, simvastatin 10-40 mg and pravastatin 10-40 mg, and enables significantly more patients to achieve National Cholesterol Education Program and Joint European Societies LDL cholesterol goals compared with each of these statins. Rosuvastatin also produces marked elevations in HDL cholesterol and maintains this effect across the dose range. Rosuvastatin favorably modifies triglycerides, LDL cholesterol and other lipid measures in patients with hypertriglyceridemia or mixed dyslipidemia, including diabetic patients, and may constitute a monotherapy option for many such patients. Rosuvastatin is well tolerated when used alone or in combination, exhibiting a safety profile similar to that of other available statins. Rosuvastatin offers considerable advantages for use in routine clinical practice.", 
    "58": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, statins, are potent inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis and have wide therapeutic use in cardiovascular diseases. Recent evidence, however, suggests that the beneficial effects of statins may extend beyond their action on serum cholesterol levels. In this study, we investigated the effects of lovastatin, pravastatin, atorvastatin and fluvastatin on macrophage formation of nitric oxide (NO) in murine RAW 264.7 cells. Stimulation of macrophages with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) resulted in inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression, which was accompanied by a large amount of NO formation. At concentrations of 0.1-30 microM, statins can inhibit stimuli-induced NO formation and iNOS induction to different extents. This inhibition occurs at the transcriptional level, and displays potency in the order of lovastatin > atorvastatin > fluvastatin > pravastatin. We found that LPS-induced I kappa B kinase and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) activation, as well as IFN-gamma-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) phosphorylation, were reduced by lovastatin. Moreover, inhibition by lovastatin of NO production and kappa B activation was reversed by mevalonate, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate. All these results suggest that inhibition of iNOS gene expression by statins can be attributed to interference with protein isoprenylation, which mediates both NF-kappa B and STAT1 activation in the upstream signaling pathways for iNOS gene transcription.", 
    "59": "1. Hypercholesterolaemia has been associated with impaired endothelial function. However, there are no available data as to whether hypercholesterolaemia is also associated with platelet dysfunction. 2. In a group of asymptomatic adults with (n = 16) and without (n = 13) mild hypercholesterolaemia, we evaluated inhibition of platelet aggregation in response to the nitric oxide (NO) donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP), as well as the augmentation index (AIx), a parameter of arterial stiffness that is impaired in the presence of endothelial dysfunction. 3. Neither SNP response nor AIx varied significantly between normocholesterolaemic (NC) and hypercholesterolaemic (HC) subjects. 4. Three months treatment with pravastatin (40 mg/day) in HC subjects lowered mean (+/-SEM) total cholesterol levels from 6.6 +/- 0.2 to 5.5 +/- 0.2 mmol/L. Platelet response to SNP increased in platelet-rich plasma and tended to increase in whole blood. The AIx did not change significantly. However, falls in low-density lipoprotein (P = 0.03) and total cholesterol (P = 0.08) correlated with reductions in AIx in individual subjects. 5. These data provide evidence that moderate reduction of cholesterol levels may improve platelet responses to NO, whereas improvement in arterial stiffness may be detectable only with more extensive and/or a prolonged reduction in cholesterol levels.", 
    "60": "The field of new lipid-lowering drug research is very active, with researchers, looking to make the currently available drugs more powerful and safer, and to develop new classes of drugs. Among the statins, development has gone the farthest for rosuvastatin and pitavastatin. Colesevelam is a new bile acid sequestrant with a better digestive tolerance. Among the new classes of drugs, the most promising molecules are the cholesterol absorption inhibitors--with ezetimibe as the first in line--and the PPAR-alpha and PPAR-gamma activators. Among the other classes, the acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitors, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) inhibitors, cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors, and ileal bile acid transporter inhibitors, have to be mentioned. In most of the cases, those new compounds are being developed mainly as a combined treatment with statins. However, these combination therapies differ depending on the lipid abnormalities of the patient. The statin-ezitimibe and the statin-bile acid sequestrant combinations have been the most studied treatments in pure hypercholesterolaemia. On another hand, the statin-PPAR-alpha and -gamma activator combination were the first to be developed for patients with combined hyperlipidaemia or type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the clinical benefit of ACAT or CETP inhibitors remains to be determined and the development of MTP inhibitors has been restricted so far, because of problems of digestive intolerance and hepatic steatosis. Finally, the discovery of new specific lipoprotein receptors, such as the ABCA1 and SRB1 receptors, means that we can work towards developing new potential targets for pharmacological intervention.", 
    "61": "More than ten years after the statins became available in therapeutics, some questions remain unanswered. What would be the populational impact if the results of clinical trials were applied to a country such as France? Is the extrapolation licit? Does the benefit of the statins actually exceed the risk? What is the relevant target population? Are statins more effective than agents acting on other cardiovascular risk factors? How efficient are the statins really? Are the statins effective in non-hypercholesterolaemic patients? What is the overall cost of the statins? Despite the fact that the statins are the drug of choice in many situations, it is still important for these questions to be answered before we accept the widespread use of statins in the general population, such as the large numbers of patients that the drug may be prescribed for in France.", 
    "62": "The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and fibrates have been associated with myotoxicity, which, in some cases, has been fatal. Rhabdomyolysis is frequently observed during drug interactions with elevated plasma concentrations. Statins have a low oral bioavailability because of their intense first-pass extraction. Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is responsible for the metabolism of atorvastatin and simvastatin which present the highest risk of drug interactions with CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as macrolides, antifungal agents, protease inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, amiodarone, and grapefruit juice. Fluvastatin has a low potential for drug interactions due to its CYP2C9-dependant metabolism. Pravastatin liver extraction does not involve CYPs and presents a low potential for drug interactions. Fibrates have a high oral bioavailability (approximately 100%), and this minimises the risk of drug interactions. However, fibrates alter the pharmacokinetics of some drugs, possibly via CYP2C9 and UDP-glucuronyltransferase (UGT) inhibition. Only three cholesterol-reducing agents have demonstrated their ability to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular death in long-term follow-up randomised trials among patients with atherosclerosis. Simvastatin exhibits the highest potential for drug interactions, pravastatin and gemfibrozil the lowest.", 
    "63": "The safety of the hydroxymethyl glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) has been called into question following the recent withdrawal from the market of one of the class, cerivastatin. The withdrawal of cerivastatin highlighted concerns regarding the safety of the entire class. According to data from several large clinical trials, the statins (except cerivastatin) are well tolerated. The most important and clinically relevant adverse effect reported with statins is myopathy. Myopathy is a clinical diagnosis of elevated creatine phosphokinase and/or myalgia along with fatigue. However, the severe from (i.e. statin-associated rhabdomyolysis) is an uncommon syndrome and occurs at a rate of approximately 1/100,000 patients/years. Statin-associated myopathy is related to statin doses, and often to drug/drug interactions. Other clinically relevant adverse effects associated with statin therapy include liver transminases elevation, which is relatively mild and often self-limiting There is no evidence from clinical trials of a significant alteration of ophthalmological function with statins. The issue of statin-induced cancer remains inconclusive. Overall, the statins seem to exhibit a favourable risk/benefit ratio, and this undoubtedly justifies life-long clinical use of statins for cardiovascular prevention.", 
    "64": "Statins and fibrates have been demonstrated to prevent both cardiovascular events and stroke. While this preventive effect was initially thought to be related to their lipid-lowering effects, in particular hypocholesterolaemic effect, analysis of primary and secondary prevention trials suggest that these preventive effects could be partly independent of their effects on lipid disorders. The pleiotropic effects, such as vascular, anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidants effects, were described for both the statins and fibrates. In addition to the preventive effects, these pleiotropic effects could partially explain the decrease in myocardial or cerebral ischemia consequences in experimental models. These cellular protective effects may have a therapeutic interest to decrease severity of stroke or coronary acute syndrome. They could also explain the drugs' lipid-lowering preventive effects independent of the treatment of lipid disorders. Beyond vascular pathologies, the pleiotropic effects of lipid-lowering drugs could explain their potentially beneficial effect in different diseases, such as dementia or cancer.", 
    "65": "The treatment of hypercholesterolaemia in children is often discussed as part of the primary prevention strategy for premature coronary disease in adults. Cholesterol-lowering drugs are appropriate in children with hereditary autosomal dominant diseases such as familial hypercholesterolaemia, familial Apo B100 deficiency, or combined familial dyslipidaemia. Indeed, these diseases are associated with a high risk of cardiovascular attacks in young adults. In children suffering from these diseases, cholesterol-lowering drugs are considered when the plasma low density-lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol concentration remains above 190 mg/dL after a 6-month dietary treatment. The drug of first choice remains bile acid-binding resines (colestyramine) because their efficacy and safety are well documented in children. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can be used in children older than 8 or 9 years of age in cases of an altered observance of colestyramine treatment, but their long-term tolerance is unknown. Fibrates are also efficient, however, their safety has not been evaluated in controlled studies through in children.", 
    "66": "Statin therapy significantly decreases the rate of clinical events in secondary prevention, however their use in patients with the acute phase of acute coronary syndromes remains controversial. Their pleiotropic effects on thrombosis, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction, might improve vascular healing. Although numerous observational studies have shown a significant reduction in mortality, one trial suggested that the statins may have a potentially harmful effect in patients with low cholesterol. However, randomised controlled trials have not demonstrated harmful effects. Of these trials, the Myocardial Ischemia Reduction with Aggressive Cholesterol Lowering (MIRACL) study is the only trial with adequate statistical power to show a significant reduction in ischemic events at 16 weeks with a high dose of once daily atorvastatin 80 mg.", 
    "67": "An important issue for stroke prevention is the identification and treatment of risk factors such as hypercholesterolaemia. The 4 reasons to test if the statins have a role in stroke prevention are: (i) a statistical link between elevated low density lipoprotein-cholesterol or decreased high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and ischaemic stroke; (ii) a reduction in vascular risk with statins in randomised trials in patients with coronary heart disease; (iii) evidence of a decreased plaque progression under statins; and (iv) pooled analyses of primary and secondary prevention trials showing that reduction of total serum cholesterol reduces the incidence of stroke, especially with the highest rate of cholesterol reduction, and in patients with the highest risk of stroke (i.e. with statins in secondary prevention trials). The question of whether statins also have a neuroprotective effect in humans and reduce the risk of post-stroke dementia remains unsettled.", 
    "68": "Previous overviews have suggested that the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), but not other lipid lowering therapies (LLTs), may reduce stroke incidence in coronary patients. Our objective was to investigate the amplitude and sources of heterogeneity of LLT effects on stroke prevention.", 
    "69": "A literature search was performed from 1966-2001 to identify all English-language published trials testing LLT. We then conducted a meta-analysis including randomised primary and secondary coronary heart disease prevention trials, which tested statins, nonstatins, diet or other interventions, and providing data on stroke incidence.", 
    "70": "The overall meta-analysis (38 individual trials, 83,161 patients, mean follow-up of 4.7 years) showed a significant relative risk reduction (RRR) of strokes by LLTs of 17% (p < 0.001), without significant heterogeneity between trials and between subgroups according to either the type of prevention (primary or secondary prevention) or type of LLT. Most demonstrative effects was obtained however with statins (RRR = 26%). Effect model analysis showed that the treatment benefits appeared constant whatever the risk of stroke, suggesting that LLTs may be effective in a population with a higher risk of stroke. Weighted regression showed a significant correlation between the RRR of stroke and total cholesterol levels (baseline, final, and change). Only final cholesterol level allowed a clear separation between benefit (RRR > 0) and no effect (RRR < 0) of LLTs on stroke incidence, with a cut-off for benefit of 6.0 mmol/L.", 
    "71": "LLTs reduce stroke incidence in coronary patients, especially when total cholesterol is under 6.0 mmol/L, this explains the better results obtained with statins.", 
    "72": "Intermediate criteria will always be useful in the first phases of drug development, e.g. to confirm that the drug acts on lipid parameters as expected from pharmacological model, for they are easier and faster to obtain than clinical criteria such as cardiovascular events. However, their use in other contexts (medical practice, research, labelling) is based on a set of conditions, needed and sufficient for surrogacy: correlation, prediction, capture and universality conditions. The critical appraisal of available information, from epidemiological studies and clinical trials as well, shows that not one of these conditions is met. The consequences are: for practice, the questioning of the worth of therapeutic monitoring of statins by lipid parameters; for research the requirement of formal models which alone would allow to fill the gap left by mythical surrogate outcomes, without meeting all their impossible conditions; and eventually for labelling, a much higher level of demand, with heavy consequences.", 
    "73": "The prevention of cardiovascular diseases is an important aim in public health. As hyperlipidaemia is one of the main causes of cardiovascular disease, a number of clinical trials have involved the testing of hypolipidaemic drug, i.e. statins, colestyramine, and gemfibrozil, and have shown their effectiveness in reducing the incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction and coronary death. Moreover, the use of statins has lead to a decrease in coronary mortality, hence a decrease in total mortality. Their efficacy was irrespective of the initial LDL-cholesterol level or atherosclerotic risk, regardless of age or gender. This demonstration of the effectiveness of hypolipidaemic drugs leads to the recommendation of there use in individuals with high atherosclerotic risk, particularly in those patients with a history of coronary heart disease or diabetes mellitus.", 
    "74": "The comparison of major statin trials with trials using either cholestyramine or ileal bypass has suggested that the reduction in coronary heart disease events for those patients receiving statin therapy largely result from their low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol lowering action. LDL-cholesterol lowering has several physiological consequences, including plaque stabilisation with a decrease in the inflammatory process, slowing of plaque progression, and improvement of endothelial function, as evidenced by the measurement of endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation in response to hyperhaemia or acetylcholine infusion. Statins lower C-reactive protein without any consistent effect on the other inflammation acute phase proteins. The cause and consequences of this effect are still debated. In order to explain why some statins can prevent coronary events within a few months, a direct effect of this therapy on thrombosis has also been advocated; however, the evaluation of statin antithrombotic effects in humans has produced conflicting results. By inhibiting L-mevalonic acid synthesis, statins also prevent the farnelysation of small-GTP binding proteins such as Rho and Ras. In vitro, and in animal models, the inhibition of Rho with statins results in a decrease in endothelial nitric oxide production, an inhibition of leucocyte adhesion on endothelium, decrease in PPAR alpha activation and high density lipoprotein (HDL) production by the hepatocyte, decrease in Ca2+ stores in vascular smooth cells, and a stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis. However, most of these effects were obtained with high statin concentrations. Further evidence is needed before a full assessment of the clinical importance of isoprenylation blockage with therapeutic concentrations of statins in humans can be made.", 
    "75": "Statins and fibrates constitute the two major families of hypolipidaemic drugs. Statins are widely used in the treatment of patients with pure hypercholesterolaemias and mixed dyslipidaemias while fibrates are used to treat hypertriglyceridaemias and mixed hyperlipidaemias. Some fibrates efficiently reduce low density-lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase and decrease cellular cholesterol synthesis. The resulting lower intracellular cholesterol concentrations suppress the capacity of Insing-1 and Insing-2 to inhibit the interaction of SCAP with SREBP-2 in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum and the formation of the SCAP: SREBP-2:SP-1 complex. When formed, this complex migrates towards the Golgi where activated SP-1 and SP-2 protease cleave SREBP-2 to give a free NH2-terminal-SREBP-2 peptide which migrates towards the nucleus. In the nucleus, this free NH2-terminal-SREBP-2 peptide binds to the SRE contained in the promoter of the gene of the LDL(B/E)-receptor and induces the transcription of this gene, and the over-expression of the LDL(B/E)-receptor in the cytoplasmic plasma membrane of hepatocytes. The over-expression of the LDL-receptor in the liver increases the clearance of circulating LDL, decreasing the LDL-cholesterol plasma levels. Fibrates decrease plasma triglycerides by decreasing their hepatic synthesis and increasing their catabolism. They decrease the triglyceride-very low density-lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis through their capacity to increase the beta-oxidation of fatty acids in the liver. They increase the plasma triglyceride catabolism by inducing the lipoprotein lipase gene transcription and decreasing the apoC-III gene transcription. Fibrates increase high density-lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol by increasing apoA-I and apoA-II gene transcription. These bio-molecular effects of fibrates are entirely due to their capacity to activate PPAR alpha and to induce the over expression of genes containing a PPRE in their promoter. Therefore, the mechanism of action of the statins and fibrates depends on their capacity to modulate the expression of genes controlling the lipoprotein metabolism.",

Hepatic secretion and fractional catabolic rate (FCR) of VLDL-apoB was measured using an intravenous bolus of d(3)-leucine before and after treatment. ApoB isotopic enrichment was measured using GCMS and multicompartmental modelling. Plasma lathosterol: cholesterol and campesterol:cholesterol ratios were determined to assess cholesterol synthesis and cholesterol absorption, respectively.", 
    "78": "Compared with placebo, atorvastatin significantly decreased (P<0.05) total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-cholesterol and VLDL-apoB.

Atorvastatin also increased VLDL-apoB FCR from 3.82+/-0.33 to 6.30+/-0.75 pools/day (P<0.01), but did not significantly alter VLDL-apoB secretion (12.8+/-1.7 to 13.8+/-2.0 mg/kg/day).",

Their ratio is reduced in AD, further reductions correlating with reduced Mini-Mental Status Examination scores [r(11) = 0.69, p < 0.05]. As statins alter APP processing, platelet APPs were analyzed in patients with AD given anticholesterol drugs for 6 weeks. APP ratios increased [t(37) = -3.888, p = 0.0004], proportionally with reduced cholesterol [r(36) = -0.45, p = 0.005]. Longer trials may reveal slowed cognitive loss, validating this index.",

Late potentials were defined as positive if signal-averaged ECG met at least two of Gomes criteria: filtered total QRS duration >114 ms, root mean square voltage of the last 40 ms of the QRS <20 mV, or the duration of the terminal low (<40 mV) amplitude signals >38 ms. Changes observed in signal-averaged ECG recordings after thrombolysis were evaluated statistically with regard to statin usage. There were no significant differences between the clinical characteristics of the two randomized groups. There was a significant decrease in the rates of late potentials between the first and third signal-averaged ECG recordings after thrombolytic therapy in pravastatin group. Pravastatin group also had lower incidence of ventricular arrhythmias compared with control group (26 vs. 63%, P=0.021). The in-hospital cardiovascular event rates were also lower in statin group.", 
    "88": "Early use of pravastatin reduces the incidence of late potentials following thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction. Statin therapy also seems to be reducing the incidence of in-hospital ventricular arrhythmias. These beneficial effects of statins might be explained through prevention of new myocardial ischemic episodes due to early plaque stabilization or regulation of endothelial and platelet functions.", 
    "89": "Low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are frequently encountered in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), most often in combination with elevated triglycerides as part of a dysmetabolic syndrome. Although no large secondary prevention trials with statin therapy with special emphasis on low HDL-C have been performed, some guidance can be extracted from a number of post-hoc analyses on how to treat patients with low levels of HDL-C. In terms of risk reduction, statin therapy appears to be at least as effective in patients with low compared to normal HDL-C levels. Fibrate therapy seems only effective when low HDL-C coincides with a level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the low-normal range. Before considering combination therapy of statins with fibrates, much emphasis should be put on dietary changes, weight reduction, smoking cessation and regular exercise, since these measures are effective tools to raise HDL-C levels. Moreover, one should be aware of the fact that combination therapy of statins and fibrates is not evidence-based and confers some potential risk of myopathy. Future therapy options may include CETP (cholesterol ester transfer protein) inhibitors, but these agents are still in an experimental phase. As most patients with low HDL-C levels share features of the dysmetabolic syndrome, one could also consider a combination therapy of statins and ACE-inhibitors, since this combination is not only safe, but the individual preventive effects of these compounds appear to be cumulative.",

    "92": "We quantified the risk of cognitive impairment first with the use of any lipid-lowering drug, and then specifically with the statins, using the random effects model. We tested for heterogeneity using the Q statistic as well as quantitatively using the Ri statistic. All seven studies provided data for statin users, and five provided data only on use of lipid-lowering drugs. Compared with patients not receiving lipid-lowering drugs, the relative risk of cognitive impairment with any lipid-lowering drug was 0.62 but was not statistically significant (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28-1.38), and the relative risk with statins was 0.43 and was statistically significant (95% CI 0.31-0.62).",

    "94": "Heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) and Hsp70 have been involved in resistance to anticancer drugs in human breast cancer cells growing in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we examined the expression of Hsp25 (the rodent homologue to human Hsp27) and Hsp70 in 3 different rodent tumors (a mouse breast carcinoma, a rat sarcoma, and a rat lymphoma maintained by subcutaneous passages) treated in vivo with doxorubicin (DOX) and lovastatin (LOV). All tumors showed massive cell death under control untreated conditions, and this massive death increased after cytotoxic drug administration. In this study, we show that this death was due to classic apoptosis. The tumors also showed isolated apoptotic cells between viable tumor cells, and this occurred more significantly in the lymphoma. The tumor type that was more resistant to cell death was the sarcoma, and this was found in sarcomas growing both under control conditions and after cytotoxic drug administration. Moreover, sarcomas showed the highest expression levels of Hsp25 in the viable tumor cells growing under untreated conditions, and these levels increased after DOX and LOV administration. After drug treatment, only sarcoma tumor cells showed a significant increase in Hsp70. In other words, sarcomas were the tumors with lower cell death, displayed a competent Hsp70 and Hsp25 response with nuclear translocation, and had the highest levels of Hsp25. In sarcomas, Hsp25 and Hsp70 were found in viable tumor cells located around the blood vessels, and these areas showed the most resistant tumor cell phenotype after chemotherapy. In addition, Hsp25 expression was found in endothelial cells as unique feature revealed only in lymphomas. In conclusion, our study shows that each tumor type has unique features regarding the expression of Hsp25 and Hsp70 and that these proteins seem to be implicated in drug resistance mainly in sarcomas, making these model systems important to perform more mechanistic studies on the role of Hsps in resistance to certain cytotoxic drugs.",

    "101": "Acute renal injury causes accumulation of free and esterified cholesterol (FC, CE) in proximal tubules, mediated, at least in part, by increased cholesterol synthesis. Normally, this would trigger compensatory mechanisms such as increased efflux and decreased influx to limit or reverse the cholesterol overload state. This study sought to determine the integrity of these compensatory pathways following acute renal damage. Rhabdomyolysis-induced acute renal failure was induced in mice by glycerol injection. Normal mice served as controls. After 18 hours, BUN levels and renal cortical FC/CE content were determined. Expression of ABCA-1 and SR-B1 (cholesterol efflux proteins) were assessed by Western blot. Renal cortical LDL receptor (LDL-R; a cholesterol importer) regulation was gauged by quantifying its mRNA. To obtain proximal tubule cell-specific data, the impact of oxidant (Fe) stress on cultured HK-2 cell LDL-R, SR-B1, and ABCA-1 proteins and their mRNAs (versus controls) was assessed. Glycerol evoked marked azotemia and striking FC/CE increments (44%, 384%, respectively). Paradoxically, renal cortical SR-B1 and ABCA-1 protein reductions and LDL-R mRNA increments resulted. Fe-induced injury suppressed HK-2 cell SR-B1, ABCA-1, and their mRNAs. LDL-R protein rose with the in vitro Fe challenge. Renal tubular cell injury causes dysregulation of SR-B1, ABCA-1, and LDL-R protein expression, changes which should contribute to a cholesterol overload state. Reductions in HK-2 cell SR-B1 and ABCA-1 mRNAs and increases in renal cortical LDL-R mRNA imply that this dysregulation reflects, at least in part, altered genomic/transcriptional events.", 
    "102": "Accumulating data from studies in animals and humans indicate that beta-blockade has antiatherosclerotic effects. To date, 2 long-term ultrasound studies provide the strongest evidence. The Beta-Blocker Cholesterol-Lowering Asymptomatic Plaque Study (BCAPS) trial reported favorable effects with beta-blockade on early stages of atherosclerosis in patients with carotid plaque but no symptoms of carotid artery disease. Compared with placebo, metoprolol controlled release/extended release (CR/XL) 25 mg once daily significantly reduced plaque thickness after 18 months of treatment (net difference -0.058 mm/year; p <0.001) and at 3 years' follow-up (net difference -0.023 mm/year; p = 0.018). The Effects of Long-Term Treatment of Metoprolol CR/XL on Surrogate Variables for Atherosclerotic Disease (ELVA) trial demonstrated that beta-blockers and statins affect different mechanisms in the atherosclerotic process and have additive beneficial effects. Patients with hypercholesterolemia were randomized to metoprolol CR/XL 100 mg once daily or placebo once daily and concomitant statin therapy. The metoprolol CR/XL group had a significantly lower rate of progression of the composite carotid bulb intima-media thickness (IMT) plus common carotid IMT than the placebo group, both at 1 year (-0.08 vs -0.01 mm; p = 0.004) and after 3 years' follow-up (-0.06 vs +0.03 mm; p = 0.011). Several factors may contribute to the mechanism of benefit in these trials, including reduced sympathetic activity, improved hemodynamic parameters, and direct effects on the vascular endothelium.", 
    "103": "The immunologic response in atherosclerosis involves not only intrinsic cells of the artery wall, but also circulating leukocytes, lymphocytes, and macrophages. Interaction of various arms of the immune response modulates plaque development and stability, and it is conceivable that immunologic effects of some cardiovascular therapies may contribute to their mechanism of benefit. The preponderance of data has accrued with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins). Statin effects, such as inhibition of T cell activation, tissue factor expression, or reduction of platelet hyperreactivity, may elicit beneficial effects in vitro and in vivo in patients with coronary artery disease. Moreover, aspirin may limit oxidation of lipoproteins and fibrinogen, and it may inhibit cytokine-induced nitric oxide synthase II expression. The hypothesis that selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) may increase risk of myocardial infarction is controversial and may also be of questionable clinical significance. Finally, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors not only reduce proinflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-6, but also enhance the concentration of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-10. Because ACE is expressed at the shoulder region of atherosclerotic plaques, and ACE activity is enhanced in unstable plaques, ACE inhibition may also contribute to plaque stability. This article reviews the potential immunomodulatory potencies of aspirin, COX-2 inhibitors, statins, and ACE inhibitors as established pharmacotherapy in patients with coronary artery disease.", 
    "104": "The acute coronary syndromes arise from procoagulant changes in complex plaques, which trigger both platelet activation and coagulation pathways. These 2 pathways intersect at a number of points that form positive-feedback loops to sustain and accelerate thrombus formation. In normal hemostasis and with a healthy endothelium, intravascular thrombosis is prevented, and vascular patency is protected by the fibrinolytic system and a number of antithrombotic factors, such as antithrombin, thrombomodulin, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor. However, atherosclerosis is characterized by a hypercoagulable state, and the fibrinolytic balance is skewed toward occlusive thrombus formation at critical sites on vulnerable plaques. This review focuses on cellular and humoral mechanisms and the antithrombotic strategies that are important during the acute phase of an ischemic coronary syndrome, both in patients managed conservatively and in patients scheduled for an interventional procedure. These strategies include fibrinolytic therapy, antiplatelet therapies (aspirin, clopidogrel, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors), and low-molecular-weight heparin.", 
    "105": "The effect of statin therapy on subclasses of LDL, VLDL and HDL lipoproteins is unclear. We compared changes in serum lipids, apolipoproteins and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy measured lipoprotein subclass concentration and average particle size over a minimum 6 months treatment period of atorvastatin 10 mg vs. placebo in 122 men and women. All subjects had type 2 diabetes and a modest dyslipidaemia (mean LDL-cholesterol 3.2 mmol/l and median triglycerides 1.8 mmol/l) and had a previous myocardial infarction. Compared with placebo, atorvastatin therapy was associated with a greater decrease in medium VLDL (median within person change -13.4 vs. -5.9 nmol/l, P<0.001 adjusted for baseline level), small VLDL (median change -17.8 vs. -8.1 nmol/l, P=0.002), large LDL (mean within person change -167.9 vs. -48.6 nmol/l, P<0.001) and medium LDL (median within person change -101.8 vs. -22.3 nmol/l, P=0.017). Atorvastatin therapy was also associated with a greater increase in large HDL than placebo (median change 1.40 vs. 0.80 micromol/l, P=0.02) and there was little change in small HDL so that average HDL particle size increased significantly with atorvastatin (P=0.04). In addition to reducing levels of (enzymatically measured) triglyceride, LDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B in diabetic patients, atorvastatin significantly reduces NMR measured medium and small VLDL and large and medium LDL, and increases large HDL.", 
    "106": "Recent studies suggest that the beneficial effects of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) in reducing cardiovascular events may in part, be independent of their capacity to lower plasma lipids. To test this hypothesis, simvastatin (50 mg/kg/d) was administered to 30-week-old apolipoprotein E deficient mice (apo E-/-) for 12, 18 and 24 weeks. In contrast to other experimental models and humans, simvastatin treatment increases plasma cholesterol levels in apo E-/- mice. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify expression of tissue factor (TF) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in the aorta of each mouse. Expression of TF was reduced to 34, 24, and 13% of control levels at 12, 18 and 24 weeks, respectively, of simvastatin administration. Advanced lesions in the innominate arteries of the simvastatin treated mice had reduced levels of TF, fewer macrophages and reduced expression of early growth response-1 (Egr-1). In vitro studies in mouse macrophages demonstrated decreased lipopolysaccharide induced binding of nuclear proteins to the Egr-1 consensus DNA sequence following pretreatment with simvastatin. RNA levels for MCP-1 were reduced to 30% of control values following 24 weeks of simvastatin treatment. In conclusion, these data suggest that chronic administration of simvastatin to older apo E-/- mice can inhibit the expression of pro-thrombotic/pro-inflammatory genes within established atherosclerotic lesions via mechanisms that are independent of reductions in plasma lipids.", 
    "107": "The object of this study was to analyze drug interactions between repaglinide, a short-acting insulin secretagogue, and five other drugs interacting with CYP3A4: ketoconazole, rifampicin, ethinyloestradiol/levonorgestrel (in an oral contraceptive), simvastatin, and nifedipine. In two open-label, two-period, randomized crossover studies, healthy subjects received repaglinide alone, repaglinide on day 5 of ketoconazole treatment, or repaglinide on day 7 of rifampicin treatment. In three open-label, three-period, randomized crossover studies, healthy subjects received 5 days of repaglinide alone; 5 days of ethinyloestradiol/levonorgestrel, simvastatin, or nifedipine alone; or 5 days of repaglinide concomitant with ethinyloestradiol/levonorgestrel, simvastatin, or nifedipine. Compared to administration of repaglinide alone, concomitant ketoconazole increased mean AUC0-infinity for repaglinide by 15% and mean Cmax by 7%. Concomitant rifampicin decreased mean AUC0-infinity for repaglinide by 31% and mean Cmax by 26%. Concomitant treatment with CYP3A4 substrates altered mean AUC0-5 h and mean Cmax for repaglinide by 1% and 17% (ethinyloestradiol/levonorgestrel), 2% and 27% (simvastatin), or 11% and 3% (nifedipine). Profiles of blood glucose concentration following repaglinide dosing were altered by less than 8% by both ketoconazole and rifampicin. In all five studies, most adverse events were related to hypoglycemia, as expected in a normal population given a blood glucose regulator. The safety profile of repaglinide was not altered by pretreatment with ketoconazole or rifampicin or by coadministration with ethinyloestradiol/levonorgestrel. The incidence of adverse events increased with coadministration of simvastatin or nifedipine compared to either repaglinide or simvastatin/nifedipine treatment alone. No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions occurred between repaglinide and the CYP3A4 substrates ethinyloestradiol/levonorgestrel, simvastatin, or nifedipine. The pharmacokinetic profile of repaglinide was altered by administration of potent inhibitors or inducers, such as ketoconazole or rifampicin, but to a lesser degree than expected. These results are probably explained by the metabolic pathway of repaglinide that involves other enzymes than CYP3A4, reflected to some extent by a small change in repaglinide pharmacodynamics. Thus, careful monitoring of blood glucose in repaglinide-treated patients receiving strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 is recommended, and an increase in repaglinide dose may be necessary. No safety concerns were observed, except a higher incidence in adverse events in patients receiving repaglinide and simvastatin or nifedipine.", 
    "108": "The aim of this review of the landmark HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) studies is to enable the clinician to draw practical lessons from these trials. The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) established the importance of treating the hypercholesterolemic patient with established cardiovascular heart disease. The West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS) showed the benefit of treating healthy hypercholesterolemic men who were nevertheless at high risk of developing cardiovascular heart disease in the future. The Cholesterol and Recurrent Events (CARE) study, a secondary prevention trial, proved the benefit of treating patients with myocardial ischemia and cholesterol levels within normal limits. This conclusion was confirmed by the Long-term Intervention With Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease (LIPID) study, another secondary prevention study that enrolled patients with a wide range of cholesterol levels (4-7 mmol/dL), into which the large majority of patients would belong. The importance of treating patients with established ischemic heart disease (IHD), and those at high risk of developing cardiovascular heart disease, regardless of cholesterol level, was being realized. The Air Force/Texas Coronary Artery Prevention Study (AFCAPS/TexCAPS) then showed that treatment can reduce adverse cardiovascular events even in the primary prevention of patients with normal cholesterol levels. The Myocardial Ischemia Reduction With Aggressive Cholesterol Lowering (MIRACL) trial showed that hypocholesterolemic therapy is useful in the setting of an acute coronary syndrome, while the Atorvastatin Versus Revascularisation Treatment (AVERT) study showed that aggressive statin therapy is as good as angioplasty in reducing ischemic cardiac events in patients with stable angina pectoris. Finally, the Heart Protection Study (HPS) randomized more than 20,000 patients, and the value of statins in reducing adverse cardiovascular events in the high-risk patient, including the elderly, women, and even in those with low cholesterol levels, is beyond doubt. The emphasis is now on the risk level for developing cardiovascular events, and treatment should target the high-risk group and not be dependent on the actual cholesterol level of the patient. It is interesting to compare the large amount of data on the value and safety of the statins with the much more limited and less convincing data on antioxidant vitamins.", 
    "109": "Obesity and hyperhomocysteinaemia are found very frequently after kidney transplantation (Tx). They may independently represent risk factors for development of atherosclerosis and chronic allograft nephropathy. In a prospective metabolic study, we monitored, over a period of 24 months, a total of 118 obese transplant patients [body mass index (BMI) > or =30 kg/m(2)] with hyperhomocysteinaemia. We compared the findings of a new therapeutic regimen at 1 year (start of the study) and 2 years after renal transplantation. Based on a Subjective Global Assessment Scoring Sheet, we started at the end of the first year with an individualized hypoenergic-hypolipidaemic diet (IHHD). Subsequently, after corticoid withdrawal, IHHD was supplemented regularly with orlistat at a dose of up to 3 x 120 mg/day, statins (pravastatin 10-40 mg), folic acid 5 mg/day and vitamin B6 50 mg/day, and followed-up for up to 2 years. All patients were on a regimen of cyclosporin A and mycophenolate mofetil. During the study period, there was a significant decrease in BMI (P < 0.025) and total homocysteine level (P < 0.001). Long-term therapy was associated with a significant decrease in serum leptin (P < 0.001) and lipid metabolism parameters (P < 0.01). The mean values of serum folate and vitamin B6 also increased significantly (P < 0.01); creatinine clearance, mean blood pressure, proteinuria, lipoprotein(a) and apolipoprotein E isoforms did not differ significantly. Based on our results, we assume that obesity and hyperhomocysteinaemia after renal transplantation can be treated effectively by modified immunosuppression (corticosteroid withdrawal), long-term diet (IHHD), folic acid and vitamin B6 supplementation, and drugs suppressing digestion or absorption to reduce atherosclerotic and chronic allograft nephrop-athy processes.",

Release of the proinflammatory chemokines interleukin-8 (IL-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) was measured by ELISA. Superoxide was determined by using the fluorescent probe dihydroethidium (HE), and monocyte binding was assessed with calcein-labeled U-937 cells. Three- to 4-fold increases in MCP-1 and IL-8 release were observed at endotoxin concentrations of 100 pg/mL; these increases were inhibited by the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor atorvastatin. Studies in cultured endothelial cells suggest that the mechanism is related to inhibition of isoprenylation (ie, geranylgeranylation) rather than cholesterol formation. Endotoxin produced dose-dependent increases in HE fluorescence that were inhibited by the superoxide dismutase mimics Tiron and MnTBAP. Endotoxin potently induced U-937 cell binding to HSV; binding was inhibited by both Tiron and atorvastatin. Toll-like receptor-4 expression was detected in cultured HSV endothelial and smooth muscle cells and in intact HSV.",

For the first occurrence of any of these major vascular events among participants with diabetes, there was a definite 22% (95% CI 13-30) reduction in the event rate (601 [20.2%] simvastatin-allocated vs 748 [25.1%] placebo-allocated, p<0.0001), which was similar to that among the other high-risk individuals studied. There were also highly significant reductions of 33% (95% CI 17-46, p=0.0003) among the 2912 diabetic participants who did not have any diagnosed occlusive arterial disease at entry, and of 27% (95% CI 13-40, p=0.0007) among the 2426 diabetic participants whose pretreatment LDL cholesterol concentration was below 3.0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL). The proportional reduction in risk was also about a quarter among various other subcategories of diabetic patient studied, including: those with different duration, type, or control of diabetes; those aged over 65 years at entry or with hypertension; and those with total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L (193 mg/dL). In addition, among participants who had a first major vascular event following randomisation, allocation to simvastatin reduced the rate of subsequent events during the scheduled treatment period.", 
    "130": "The present study provides direct evidence that cholesterol-lowering therapy is beneficial for people with diabetes even if they do not already have manifest coronary disease or high cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rate of first major vascular events by about a quarter in a wide range of diabetic patients studied. After making allowance for non-compliance, actual use of this statin regimen would probably reduce these rates by about a third. For example, among the type of diabetic patient studied without occlusive arterial disease, 5 years of treatment would be expected to prevent about 45 people per 1000 from having at least one major vascular event (and, among these 45 people, to prevent about 70 first or subsequent events during this treatment period). Statin therapy should now be considered routinely for all diabetic patients at sufficiently high risk of major vascular events, irrespective of their initial cholesterol concentrations.",

However, fibrate + statin therapy has been restricted following early reports of rhabdomyolysis that mainly involved gemfibrozil, originally with bovastatin, and recently, with cerivastatin. Despite this limitation, several reports describing combination therapy have been published. This review considers these studies and the relevant indications and contraindications. Statin + fibrate therapy should be considered if monotherapy or adding other drugs (e.g. cholesterol absorption inhibitors, omega-3 fatty acids ornicotinic acid) did not achieve lipid targets or is impractical. Combination therapy should be hospital-based and reserved for high-risk patients with a mixed hyperlipidaemia characterised by low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) >2.6 mmol/l(100 mg/dl, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) <1.0 mmol/l (40 mg/dl) and/or triglycerides> 5.6 mmol/l (500 mg/dl. These three 'goals' are individually mentioned in guidelines. Patients should have normal renal, liver and thyroid function tests and should not be receiving therapy with cyclosporine, protease inhibitors or drugs metabolised through cytochrome P450 (especially 3A4). Combination therapy is probably best conducted using drugs with short plasma half-lives; fibrates should be prescribed in the morning and statins at night to minimise peak dose interactions. Both drug classes should be progressively titated from low doses. Regular (3-monthly) monitoring of liver function and creatine kinase is required. In conclusion, fibrate + statin therapy remains an option in high-risk patents. However, long-term studies involving safety monitoring and vascular endpoints are required to demonstrate the efficacy of this regimen.",

Dietary administration of 3 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg SC-435 to apolipoprotein E-/- (apoE-/-) mice increased fecal bile acid excretion by >2.5-fold. In vivo inhibition of ASBT also resulted in significant increases of hepatic mRNA levels for cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase and HMG-CoA reductase. Administration of 10 mg/kg SC-435 for 12 weeks to apoE-/- mice lowered serum total cholesterol by 35% and reduced aortic root lesion area by 65%. Treatment of apoE-/- mice also resulted in decreased expression of ileal bile acid binding protein and hepatic nuclear hormone receptor small heterodimer partner, direct target genes of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), suggesting a possible role of FXR in SC-435 modulation of cholesterol homeostasis. In dogs, SC-435 treatment reduced serum total cholesterol levels by </=12% and, in combination with atorvastatin treatment, caused an additional reduction of 25%.
