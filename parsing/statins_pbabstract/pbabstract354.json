This effect was seen as early as 12 weeks (median reduction in CRP with pravastatin, 14.7%; P<.001) and was present among all prespecified subgroups according to sex, age, smoking status, body mass index, baseline lipid levels, presence of diabetes, and use of aspirin or hormone replacement therapy. No significant association was observed between baseline CRP and baseline LDL-C levels, end-of-study CRP and end-of-study LDL-C levels, or change in CRP and change in LDL-C levels over time. In linear regression analyses, the only significant predictors of change in CRP on a log scale were randomized pravastatin allocation and baseline CRP levels (P<.001 for both).

As expected, there was a significant reduction in plasma total cholesterol (-23%) and LDL-cholesterol (-27%) levels in the statin group, and a significant reduction in triglycerides (-29%) and some decrease in total cholesterol (-12%) in the fibrate group; no change was observed in the control group. The selective increase in plasma arachidonic acid levels (in terms of absolute concentration and as a percentage of total fatty acids) was of the same order as the reduction in cholesterol, and the selective increase in the product/precursor ratios for delta 5 desaturation in the statin group indicated that this key step in arachidonic acid synthesis is affected.",

Stored serum samples from this study were analysed to compare the effects of simvastatin and atorvastatin on 2 biomarkers of bone turnover, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), a marker of bone formation, and C-teleopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTx), a marker of bone resorption. Treatment with simvastatin 40 and 80 mg/day, but not atorvastatin 20 and 40 mg/day, led to significant (p < 0.05) reductions in BSAP in both men (4.1-5.4% reduction) and women (4.2-7.4% reduction). In addition, there appeared to be a dose-dependent effect with greater reductions in BSAP seen with the 80 mg dose of simvastatin. Treatment with either 20 mg or 40 mg of atorvastatin had no significant effect on BSAP levels on the groups as a whole or in the gender-specific subgroups. CTx showed a small, but not statistically significant, decrease with simvastatin, again with an apparent dose-related trend. Atorvastatin treatment generally resulted in small, non significant increases in CTx.",

The beneficial effects of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) therapy in atherosclerosis outweigh those expected from simply lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and may be related to the direct action in the endothelium. Based on these concepts, in the studies described here, the effect of new statin derivatives on nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide (O2-) release in bovine endothelial cells was tested.",

The tested statins stimulated NO release in a modest way, which resulted in diminishing O2- generation during activation of nitric oxide synthase. Moreover, the kinetics of O2- release after administration of the statins suggested that these compounds may also scavenge O2-. The NO/O2- peak concentration ratio after the NOS agonists administration was as follows: 7.51 for CaI, 6.56 for Lovastatin, 6.00 for Atorvastatin, 4.17 for Pravastatin and 6.25 for Simvastatin.",

    "17": "Large scale clinical trials have clearly demonstrated that the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce cardiovascular mortality by about 30%. The specific benefit on stroke prevention remains however to be determined. We reviewed all controlled clinical trials comparing statins versus placebo in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. We identified 13 studies including 4S, CARE, WOSCOPS and LIPID. More than 32000 patients were randomized. The meta-analysis was performed using relative risk as treatment effect parameter. Statin treatment induced a significant relative risk reduction (RRR) of 24% (95% CI [12%-34%]) for stroke (2.1% vs 2.8%). RRR achieved 25% (95% CI [17%-32%]) for cardiovascular mortality and 34% (95% CI [30%-38%]) for myocardial infarction, without heterogeneity between trials. Stroke was reduced by 25% in secondary prevention, and by 15% in primary prevention, without significant heterogeneity between them. RRR of stroke was similar with pravastatin (RRR=0.79, p=0.0038) and with simvastatin (RRR=0.71, p=0.049). The effect model analysis (relationship between annual incidence of events in treated group versus placebo group in each trial) showed that RRR was constant whatever the baseline risk. These results are in favor of a preventive efficacy of statin treatment against stroke in middle aged patients with coronary heart disease. Complementary information will be needed to clarify the mechanism of this beneficial effect and to demonstrate statin efficacy in a population with a higher risk of stroke such as the elderly.", 
    "18": "Before the statins era, this was one of the most debated questions in the field of cardiology: although hypolipidemic drugs (mainly fibrates) decreased the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, their influence on total mortality was not significant. The 4S study demonstrated the efficacy of a statin on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and on total mortality. This was confirmed by the CARE and the LIPID trials. Statins should be prescribed to all coronary patients, whatever the type of coronary disease, the age (we do not know yet for people older than 80), the gender, the basal cholesterol level (maybe statins are not efficacious when it is<2g/l); cholesterol level has to be lowered below 2g/l. Two trials of drugs increasing the HDL cholesterol level were recently published. Unfortunately their results are contradictory. Statins should be the first level drugs. Maybe it is useful to decrease the triglycerides level and to increase the HDL cholesterol level. The association of a statin and a fibrate is reserved to specialized centers. We should not forget the usefulness of diet. We must also take the other risk factors into account.", 
    "19": "Elevated levels of C-reactive protein, even in the absence of hyperlipidemia, are associated with an increased risk of coronary events. Statin therapy reduces the level of C-reactive protein independently of its effect on lipid levels.

Lovastatin therapy reduced the C-reactive protein level by 14.8 percent (P<0.001), an effect not explained by lovastatin-induced changes in the lipid profile. As expected, lovastatin was effective in preventing coronary events in participants whose base-line ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was higher than the median ratio, regardless of the level of C-reactive protein (number needed to treat for five years to prevent 1 event, 47; P=0.005). However, lovastatin was also effective among those with a ratio of total to HDL cholesterol that was lower than the median and a C-reactive protein level higher than the median (number needed to treat, 43; P=0.02).

Furthermore, administration of simvastatin tended to lower plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha [by 20+/-44 and 13+/-29%, respectively (P= 0.066 and 0.110, respectively)]. There were significant inverse correlations between pretreatment levels of MMP-9 and the degree of change in those levels after administration of simvastatin (r = -0.714, P= 0.005).

    "32": "Dyslipidemia is an important factor in causation of macrovascular disease in type 2 diabetics. The role of simvastatin in the management of dyslipidemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is not very well elucidated, particularly in the context of the recent American Diabetes Association criteria 2001. The American Diabetes Association suggests that aggressive therapy of diabetic dyslipidemia will reduce the risk of coronary heart disease in diabetics and that optimal levels are serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol <2.60 mmol/L (< 100 mg/dl), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol >1.1 5 mmol/L (>45 mg/dl) and triglycerides <2.30 mmol/L, (<200 mg/dl). This study was planned to compare the effect of simvastatin together with behavioral modification and behavioral modification alone, in age, sex and body mass index matched patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with dyslipidemia, in reaching the target levels of various lipids as suggested by the American Diabetes Association criteria 2001.", 
    "33": "An open-label, prospective study was conducted on 80 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, who had fair to moderate glycemic control with a total glycated hemoglobin < 10%. The patients in the control group (n=40) were treated with only behavioral modifications like calorie control and daily walking for 30 minutes, and no lipid-lowering agent was given. The lipid profile was re-evaluated after 6 and 12 weeks. The patients in the test group (n=40) were advised behavioral modification and given simvastatin. The starting dose was 10 mg at bed time. After 6 weeks of simvastatin therapy, a lipid profile was done. If the goal of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol < 100 mg/dl and/or triglycerides <200 mg/dl and/or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol >45 mg/dl was not achieved, the dose of simvastatin was increased to 20 mg at bedtime for another 6 weeks. It was observed that low-density lipoprotein dyslipidemia was most prevalent. In the control group, a favorable alteration in lipid levels was brought about but none was statistically significant and the American Diabetes Association goals were not achieved in any of the patients. In the test group, there was a significant and favorable alteration in all lipid moieties, and the target levels were achieved in 80% of patients after 12 weeks. There was no significant alteration in glycemic control and liver functions. Myopathy and epigastric pain were seen in 1 patient in each group.", 
    "34": "In our study, behavioral modification alone did not achieve the target levels of various lipids in diabetic dyslipidemia as per the American Diabetes Association guidelines. Hence, pharmacological therapy with statins should be resorted to in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who carry a high risk of coronary heart disease. Simvastatin is a safe and efficacious lipid-lowering drug.", 
    "35": "Atorvastatin is a new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor that strongly lowers plasma cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) levels in humans and animals. Since previous data indicated that atorvastatin has prolonged inhibition of hepatic cholesterol synthesis, we tested whether this longer duration of inhibitory effect on cholesterol synthesis decreased hepatic lipoprotein secretion in vitro. We used the HepG2 hepatoma cell line to: (1) determine the time required until levels of secreted apo B-100 and TG declined significantly, (2) examine the relation to the mass of cellular cholesteryl ester (CE) and (3) test microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) activity which leads to decreased apo B-100 production. Although atorvastatin significantly inhibited cholesterol synthesis in HepG2 cells regardless of treatment duration (1, 14 or 24 h), it did not inhibit TG synthesis. Apo B-100 and TG secretion were unchanged after 1-h atorvastatin treatment, but declined significantly after 24-h treatment. Atorvastatin treatment also reduced cellular CE mass, exhibiting both time- and dose-dependency. Mevalonolactone, a product of HMG-CoA reductase, attenuated the inhibitory effects of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin strongly reduced mRNA levels of MTP, whereas it did not inhibit MTP activity as measured by TG transfer assay between liposomes. Simvastatin also induced treatment- and time-dependent reductions in apo B-100, whereas the MTP inhibitor BMS-201038 exhibited no time dependency, instead inhibiting this variable even on 1-h treatment. These results indicate that reduced apo B-100 secretion caused by atorvastatin is a secondary result owing to decreased lipid availability, and that atorvastatin's efficacy depends on the duration of cholesterol synthesis inhibition in the liver.", 
    "36": "We hypothesized that coadministration of avasimibe and simvastatin would limit size, composition and extent of atherosclerotic lesions and potentially promote lesion regression, since bioavailable ACAT inhibitors decrease monocyte-macrophage enrichment and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors limit smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation. Male New Zealand white rabbits were sequentially fed a 0.5% cholesterol, 3% peanut oil, 3% coconut oil diet for 9 weeks and a chow-fat diet for 6 weeks prior to drug administration. A time zero control group was necropsied prior to drug administration and the progression control was fed various diets but untreated. Avasimibe (10 mg/kg), simvastatin (2.5 mg/kg) or combination of avasimibe (10 mg/kg) with simvastatin (2.5 mg/kg) were administered in the chow-fat diet for 8 weeks. Plasma total cholesterol exposure was unchanged by avasimibe but was reduced 21% by both simvastatin alone and in combination with avasimibe. Combination of avasimibe and simvastatin decreased VLDL-cholesterol exposure by 56%. VLDL+IDL lipid composition was similar in the progression control and simvastatin-treated animals. Administration of avasimibe alone or in combination with simvastatin reduced the cholesteryl ester fraction and increased the triglyceride fraction to comparable extents. Relative to the progression control, avasimibe plus simvastatin markedly decreased thoracic aortic cholesteryl ester content and lesion coverage by 50% and aortic arch lesion size and macrophage area by 75 and 73%, respectively. With respect to lesion regression, avasimibe+simvastatin decreased aortic arch lesion size by 64% and monocyte-macrophage area by 73% when compared to time zero. Based on these data, we conclude that despite changes in plasma total and lipoprotein cholesterol exposure and lipoprotein composition comparable to monotherapy, inhibition of both ACAT and HMG-CoA reductase may not only directly blunt lesion progression but also promote regression of pre-established atherosclerotic lesions.", 
    "37": "We examined the relationship between plaque vulnerability and fibromuscular cap composition using hydrophilic pravastatin and lipophilic fluvastatin. WHHL rabbits aged 10 months were given pravastatin (50 mg/kg) or fluvastatin (20 mg/kg) for 52 weeks. The atherosclerotic lesions were immunohistochemically or conventionally stained and the components were analyzed with a color image analyzer. Compared with the control group, the plasma cholesterol levels were decreased by about 25% in both statin groups. Pravastatin decreased the lipid components (macrophages+extracellular lipids) in whole aortic plaques by 34% and the fibrous caps of coronary plaques by 55%. Fluvastatin decreased the fibromuscular components (smooth muscle cells+collagen fibers) in whole aortic plaques and in the fibromuscular caps of the aortic and coronary plaques. In the pravastatin group, the vulnerability index, the ratio of (lipid components)/(fibromuscular components), was decreased in whole aortic plaques by 28% and in the fibromuscular caps of coronary lesions by 61%, while the indexes were increased in the fluvastatin group. The incidence of vulnerable plaques was decreased by 74% in the coronary plaques of the pravastatin group. Our results suggest that the stability of atheromatous plaques was improved due to a decrease of the lipid components and vulnerability index of the fibromuscular cap by pravastatin.", 
    "38": "We recently identified HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway, as a potential therapeutic target of various retinoic acid responsive cancers. Lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, induced a retinoic acid-like differentiation response followed by extensive apoptosis in neuroblastoma cell lines at relatively low concentrations (<20 microM) of this agent. More recently, we demonstrated that acute myeloid leukemias but not acute lymphocytic leukemias also displayed increased sensitivity to lovastatin-induced apoptosis. In this study, we examined the ability of lovastatin to induce differentiation of acute myeloid leukemic cells and to evaluate the role differentiation may hold in the anti-leukemic properties of this agent. Increased expression of the leukocyte integrins CD11b and CD18 as well as down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2 are associated with late stage differentiation of the myeloid lineage and retinoic acid induced maturation of acute myeloid leukemic cells. Lovastatin exposure induced increased expression of CD11b and CD18 markers similar to retinoic acid treatment. Following 24 hrs exposure to 20 microM lovastatin, all 7 acute myeloid leukemia cell lines tested showed a decrease in bcl-2 mRNA expression while only 1/5 acute lymphocytic leukemia cell lines showed a similar response. A role for bcl-2 in the apoptotic response of acute myeloid leukemia cells to lovastatin was demonstrated as exogenous constitutive expression of bcl-2 in the AML-5 cell line inhibited apoptosis in a time and dose dependent manner. Thus, lovastatin exposure of acute myeloid leukemia cells induced a differentiation response that may contribute to the therapeutic potential of this agent in the treatment of this disease.", 
    "39": "Lipid abnormalities in diabetic patients, particularly in those with nephropathy, may be partially due to deteriorating atherosclerosis. Therefore, strict control of the lipid metabolism in addition to glycemic control is desirable. Whether or not lipid lowering drugs prevent albuminuria in diabetic patients in the long term remains unclear. This study involved 71 NIDDM patients with hypercholesterolemia (group A: n = 37, group B: N = 34). The effect of bezafibrate (group A) or pravastatin (group B) on the cholesterol (CH) content of apolipoprotein AI, B100 containing particles or remnant-like particles (RLP) or urinary albumin excretion was studied over 4 years. The CH content in apolipoprotein B100 particles after treatment with either bezafibrate or pravastatin decreased significantly (group A: 24.7%, group B: 26.6%). The CH content in RLP after treatment with bezafibrate showed a significant decrease (67.9%). Apolipoprotein AI after treatment with bezafibrate showed a significant increase (10.9%). Apolipoprotein B100 after treatment with either drug decreased significantly (group A: 19.8%, group B: 23.4%). The urinary albumin excretion rate after treatment with either drug showed no significant change over 4 years. Bezafibrate and pravastatin appear to be useful in the preventive treatment of albuminuria as well as in lowering lipid levels in NIDDM patients.", 
    "40": "The Kyushu Lipid Intervention Study (KLIS) aimed to investigate the effects of pravastatin in the primary prevention of coronary events and cerebral infarction in Japanese men aged 45-74 years with serum total cholesterol of > or = 220 mg/dl (5.69 mmol/l). The coronary events included myocardial infarction, coronary artery surgery and angioplasty, cardiac death, and sudden death. A total of 5,640 patients were recruited, and 3,061 and 2,579 were allocated to the pravastatin (10-20 mg/day) and conventional treatment, respectively. They were followed up for 5 years on average. Due to unsuccessful randomization, a protocol-based analysis was carried out with adjustment for coronary risk factors at baseline using the Cox proportional hazards model. For several reasons (serum total cholesterol of > or = 300 mg/dl, use of drugs excluded in protocol, etc.), 2,219 men in the pravastain group and 1,634 in the conventional treatment group were used in the analysis. The baseline total cholesterol levels were 254 mg/dl in the pravastain group and 243 mg/dl in the conventional treatment group. Serum total cholesterol levels fell by 15% in the pravastain group and by 8% with the conventional treatment group. Adjusted relative risks for pravastatin versus conventional treatment were: coronary events 0.86 (one-side p=0.23), cerebral infarction 0.78 (p=0.13), and the two outcomes combined 0.81 (p=0.08). These findings add to evidence that pravastatin use is beneficial in the prevention of coronary events and cerebral infarction in hypercholesterolemic Japanese patients, and suggest that pravastatin may be more protective against cerebral infarction.", 
    "41": "We recently reported that AML cells derived either from cell lines or from patients undergo apoptosis in response to lovastatin, an agent used extensively in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. The concentration of lovastatin required to achieve this in culture varies from patient to patient, however, the in vitro concentrations required to kill AML cells, can be attained clinically. While in vitro studies assessing responsiveness of leukemic cells to lovastatin were being performed, a 72 year old female presented with relapsed AML. The patient did not desire any further induction therapy. As the patient's cells proved to be sensitive in culture to lovastatin, the patient was offered this drug. In this brief report we describe a case in which there was apparent control of the patient's leukemic blast cells by lovastatin at a dose double the usual recommended dose for hypercholesterolemia. This case illustrates the potential for lovastatin to provide a novel means of controlling leukemic cell growth in AML patients.", 
    "42": "The importance of treating symptomatic high-grade stenosis of the carotid artery is now widely acknowledged. The criteria for nonmedical treatment is continually refined by taking into account the patient's symptoms, age, gender, family history, and treatment-related risk factors. Such refinements have realized importance because the small benefit of invasive treatment can be negated by treatment complications. Improvements in medical treatments such as novel antiplatelet agents, antioxidant, and statin therapy, will ensure that the gain from invasive methods will be further reduced. Surgical (open) carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is the gold standard treatment for high-risk lesions, because it achieves the crucial goal of excising the culprit atheroma, thus providing treatment durability. However, this treatment is highly dependent on surgical standards, and therefore, it may not be beneficial in all centers. In carotid angioplasty (CAP), the atheroma is distended with an endovascular balloon. Because the atheroma is not removed, but the pathologic process is altered, durability cannot be assumed and restenosis remains a significant possibility. In this article, the areas of concern for CEA and CAP will be compared and contrasted. I will address the standards of care used when treating patients with carotid artery disease, and discuss the procedure that should be followed when introducing new treatment options.", 
    "43": "Statins are widely used lipid-lowering drugs that reduce cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity. They also strongly stimulate bone formation in rodents. If the drugs' potent bone-building activity results directly from inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, there should be less bone fracturing in humans who have taken statins to lower their serum cholesterol and prevent heart attacks, but the data gleaned from several databases are contradictory. According to some reports the lipid-lowering doses of oral statins increased bone mineral density and more than halved the risk of fracturing various bones, while according to others, including the very large Women's Health Initiative Observational Study (WHI-OS), the drugs did not significantly affect the fracturing risk. Such contradictory data could be due in part to one of the commonly used statins, pravastatin which only targets hepatocytes, or due to bone growth being stimulated by something other than inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. Therefore, different doses of statins may be needed to build bone or optimally lower serum cholesterol. To be able to answer the question posed by the title of this editorial, it will be necessary to carry out a controlled trial using designer statins that are less liver-oriented and thus better for assessing the optimal doses needed, specifically for osteogenicity rather than for their cholesterol-lowering ability.",

Corresponding IC50 values for diltiazem ranged from 110-127 microM and from 21-27 microM, respectively. Verapamil and diltiazem inhibited testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, key features of mechanism-based inactivation. Values for the inactivation parameters kinact and KI were 0.15 +/- 0.04 min-1 (mean +/- s.d.) and 2.9 +/- 0.6 microM, respectively, for verapamil and 0.07 +/- 0.01 min-1 and 3.3 +/- 1.5 microM, respectively, for diltiazem.", 
    "47": "The IC50 values for coincubation of verapamil and diltiazem were 46- and 220-fold higher, respectively, than those reported previously for mibefradil, and 16- and 71-fold higher, respectively, for preincubation. Thus, the results of this study suggest that verapamil and diltiazem are less likely than mibefradil to cause acute drug interactions with simvastatin in vivo. However, verapamil and diltiazem are moderate mechanism-based inhibitors of CYP3A4 and therefore may still cause significant inhibition of simvastatin metabolism in vivo during chronic therapy.",

    "49": "This study compared the effects of conversion from maintenance troglitazone therapy to pioglitazone versus rosiglitazone. HbA(1c), lipids, weights, adverse effects, and hepatic status were monitored, providing no other major therapeutic change had been made. Of 163 study candidates, 144 and 125 patients fulfilled the criteria for comparison of HbA(1c) and lipids, respectively.", 
    "50": "HbA(1c) decreased an absolute mean of 0.08% for each treatment group, after a mean 3.2-month observation. Mean cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels decreased in the pioglitazone group by 4.7%, 11.3%, and 7.3% but increased 8.4%, 38.4%, and 8.1%, respectively, in the rosiglitazone group. Mean high-density lipoprotein (HDL) increased 2.6% with pioglitazone and decreased 6.3% with rosiglitazone therapy. Patients receiving a statin concomitantly when switched to rosiglitazone treatment had a 51.9% mean triglyceride increase versus a 25.7% increase for those not taking a statin, whereas the patients switched to pioglitazone therapy had respective decreases of 14.2% and 6.2%. Both drugs were generally well tolerated; patients in both groups had similar slight weight increases and no hepatic dysfunction.", 
    "51": "Patients switched from maintenance troglitazone treatment to either pioglitazone or rosiglitazone therapy had similar glycemic control. Conversion to pioglitazone therapy caused a trend toward improvement in all lipid variables, but switching to rosiglitazone therapy caused significantly increased levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL and a trend toward decreased HDL. Patients already receiving statins when switched to rosiglitazone therapy had particularly notable triglyceride worsening. Whether these effects will lead to changes in cardiovascular outcome or will be maintained over a longer period remains to be established.", 
    "52": "The inhibitory effect of NK-104, a potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, on taxol metabolism was examined using radio-TLC. This method is described for in vitro measurement of taxol metabolites as an alternative to the commonly used HPLC assay. After incubation of 14C-taxol with human liver microsomes, the supernatants were developed using a solvent system consisting of toluene-acetone-formic acid (60:39:1, v/v) and quantified with a bioimaging analyzer. The described method provides a valuable tool for the simultaneous determination of unchanged taxol and its major metabolites. There was no inhibitory effect of NK-104 on CYP-mediated metabolism of taxol in human liver microsomes.", 
    "53": "Two hydroxymethylglutaryl-SCoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, mevastatin and lovastatin, inhibited the in vitro growth and production of CH4 of strains of Methanobrevibacter isolated from the rumen. Mevastatin or lovastatin did not inhibit growth of species of rumen bacteria that are essential for fermenting cellulose, starch and other plant polysaccharides to acetate, propionate, and butyrate. Approximately 4 nmol of lovastatin per milliliter resulted in 50% growth inhibition of Methanobrevibacter strain ZA10 and concentrations > or =10 nmol per milliliter completely inhibited growth and CH4 formation. Results of in vitro growth studies suggest that supplementation of ruminant feeds with HMG-CoA inhibitors could decrease ruminant methane production and increase the efficiency of feed utilization by domestic ruminants.", 
    "54": "Hepatitis D virus (HDV) requires the isoprenylated large delta antigen (LDAg) for interaction with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) to allow packaging and secretion out of the host cell. Phosphorylated LDAg has been found but, as yet, neither localization of LDAg within the nucleus nor any other function has been correlated with modification. In this study, we transfected HuH-7 or HeLa cells with plasmids encoding various lengths of LDAg [designated GFP-LD and GFP-LD(31-214) for full length and a deletion, respectively] or non-isoprenylated mutants of these [designated GFP-LDM and GFP-LD(31-214)M] fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP). These fusion proteins were then characterized and it was found that: (i) the addition of the GFP did not interfere with the functioning of the full-length or N-terminally deleted LDAgs when interacting with HBsAg for secretion; (ii) the HDV small antigen (SDAg) together with the GFP-LD, but not the GFP-LD(31-214), could be cosecreted by HBsAg; and (iii) the GFP-LD, but not the GFP-LD(31-214), exerted a dominant-negative role on HDV genome replication. Analyses of transiently transfected cells and postmitotic permanent cells revealed the sequential appearance of GFP-LD in the nucleoplasm, then in the nucleolus, and finally in nuclear speckles (NS). Isoprenylation of LDAg seems to be important for targeting to and accumulating in the NS, which was evident from the dynamic and static localization of the non-isoprenylation mutant (GFP-LDM) and the distribution of wild-type (GFP-LD) when treated with an isoprenylation inhibitor, lovastatin, for more than 48 h. Permanently expressing GFP-LD cells allowed us to show the dynamic redistribution of dephosphorylated GFP-LD from the nucleolus to the SC-35 containing NS in the presence of dichlororibofuranosyl benzimidazole (DRB) and then the translocation back of the GFP-LD to the nucleolus within 2 h after removal of DRB. Our studies thus suggest that the various versions of the GFP-LD fusion protein, having the same function as their nonfusion counterparts, can be a powerful tool for the study of the dynamic localization of LDAg when correlated with the functional modification of this protein.", 
    "55": "Dyslipidemia emerges as an important modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease in diabetes mellitus, especially as part of the metabolic syndrome in type 2 diabetes. In type 1 diabetes mellitus, tight glucose regulation usually will correct dyslipidemia. Both total cholesterol and triglyceride levels predict cardiovascular disease in diabetes, and HDL-cholesterol may prove to be an even better predictor. In type 2 diabetes, increased triglyceride and reduced HDL-cholesterol levels are the key characteristics of dyslipidemia. Increased hepatic VLDL production and impaired catabolism of triglyceride-rich particles contribute to hypertriglyceridemia. Subsequent formation of small dense LDL particles leads to increased atherogenicity. Small dense LDL particles have a longer circulation time, are susceptible to glycoxidation, and are taken up by macrophages and the vessel wall. Post-hoc analysis of diabetic subgroups in primary and secondary prevention trials suggest that individuals with diabetes may enjoy substantial cardiovascular risk reduction from lipid-lowering therapy. Trials prospectively addressing the benefit of lipid lowering therapy in diabetes are under way. Target levels for lipid lowering therapy in diabetes at present stem from pathophysiological plausibility rather than from clinical proof. Intensive lipid-lowering with a statin in adequate dosage or a combination of a statin and a fibrate may be used to lower LDL-cholesterol levels to values < 2.6 mmol/l and triglyceride levels to < 1.7 mmol/l, a value at which few small dense LDL particles remain in circulation. Effective medication to raise HDL-cholesterol levels adequately are not yet available for clinical use. Treatment of diabetic dyslipidemia should be as simple as possible, given the polypharmacy that is often necessary for the patient with diabetes. Therefore, single treatment with a statin in adequate dosage is the first choice.", 
    "56": "Hypertriglyceridaemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in patients suffering from Type II diabetes mellitus, and is due to enhanced synthesis and/or impaired clearance of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins. In the present study we investigated whether pseudocholinesterase (PChE) activity could serve as a marker for the rate of triacylglycerol synthesis in these patients. Patients were stratified according to their apolipoprotein E (apoE) phenotype, i.e. E3E2, E3E3 or E3E4. In study I, the relationship between PChE activity and serum triacylglycerols was investigated in 224 insulin-treated patients with Type II diabetes. In study II, which had a cross-over design, PChE activity was measured in 45 dyslipidaemic, insulin-treated patients with Type II diabetes that were treated with bezafibrate or pravastatin. In study I, PChE activity was correlated positively with serum triacylglycerol concentrations, but did not differ significantly between apoE phenotypes. The strongest relationship was found in the E3E4 group (r=0.50; P=0.001), the phenotype for which hypertriglyceridaemia is expected to be the result of increased triacylglycerol synthesis. In a stepwise multiple regression analysis, serum triacylglycerol concentrations were found to be the strongest predictor of PChE activity in the E3E4 group. In study II, PChE activity decreased as a result of bezafibrate treatment in all three apoE groups. The decrease in PChE activity with bezafibrate treatment paralleled the decrease in serum triacylglycerol concentrations in the apoE subgroups. Pravastatin treatment did not significantly affect PChE activity. Thus the present study suggests an association between PChE activity and the rate of triacylglycerol synthesis. Measurement of PChE activity may therefore be a useful tool in the choice of drug for treatment of hypertriglyceridaemia in patients with Type II diabetes.", 
    "57": "The current understanding of the origin of atherosclerosis is that of an inflammatory process that involves the acute phase response -an innate biological response to a disturbance in homeostasis -infection, inflammation, tissue injury, neoplasm, or immune disturbance. The activation of the acute phase response, signaled by interleukin-6, produces proteins (fibrinogen, C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A) that lead to inflammatory reactions. The tissues themselves contain elevated levels of acute phase proteins and cytokines resulting in a localized inflammatory effect. Localized inflammatory responses in the intimal layer of the arterial wall have been shown to be responsible for many of the aspects of intimal thickening and plaque disruption, leading to acute cardiovascular events. The predictive value of plasma C-reactive protein as a risk factor for cardiovascular events has led some researchers to support the use of CRP as a main cardiovascular risk assessment tool, along with total cholesterol:HDL ratios and homocysteine levels. The ability of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors to lower C-reactive protein levels has recently brought into question the mechanisms of action of the statin drugs. Because these medications lower incidences of acute cardiovascular events as well as decreasing morbidity and mortality well before the effects of lowered LDL cholesterol can be expected to occur, questions have been asked about whether they may work independently of LDL-lowering mechanisms. Red yeast rice contains a naturally-occurring statin (lovastatin) as well as other cholesterol-lowering compounds, some with antioxidant effects. Alpha-tocopherol also significantly lowers CRP levels in diabetics and nondiabetics, and minimizes other aspects of the acute phase response and inflammatory damage involved in atherosclerosis. This may account for alpha-tocopherol's positive effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Finally, polyphenolic compounds present in virgin olive oil also have anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects in cardiovascular disease. The phenolic compounds in virgin olive oil may explain some of the protective effects found in epidemiological studies.", 
    "58": "The effect of the synthetic statin fluvastatin was investigated on the concentrations of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and of soluble adhesion molecules in human vascular endothelial cell cultures. Fluvastatin was able to increase dose-dependently eNOS concentration. In addition, fluvastatin reduced concentrations of E-Selectin and ICAM-1. These results further support the evidence that statins elicit important effects on the vascular endothelium which may contribute to the reduction of morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "59": "Therapeutic neovascularization may constitute an important strategy to salvage tissue from critical ischemia. Circulating bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) were shown to augment the neovascularization of ischemic tissue. In addition to lipid-lowering activity, hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) reportedly promote the neovascularization of ischemic tissue in normocholesterolemic animals. Methods and Results-Fifteen patients with angiographically documented stable coronary artery disease (CAD) were prospectively treated with 40 mg of atorvastatin per day for 4 weeks. Before and weekly after the initiation of statin therapy, EPCs were isolated from peripheral blood and counted. In addition, the number of hematopoietic precursor cells positive for CD34, CD133, and CD34/kinase insert domain receptor was analyzed. Statin treatment of patients with stable CAD was associated with an approximately 1.5-fold increase in the number of circulating EPCs by 1 week after initiation of treatment; this was followed by sustained increased levels to approximately 3-fold throughout the 4-week study period. Moreover, the number of CD34/kinase insert domain receptor-positive hematopoietic progenitor cells was significantly augmented after 4 weeks of therapy. Atorvastatin treatment increased the further functional activity of EPCs, as assessed by their migratory capacity.", 
    "60": "The results of the present study define a novel mechanism of action of statin treatment in patients with stable CAD: the augmentation of circulating EPCs with enhanced functional activity. Given the well-established role of EPCs of participating in repair after ischemic injury, stimulation of EPCs by statins may contribute to the clinical benefit of statin therapy in patients with CAD.",

After a 6-week period on a 30% fat diet, participants received treatment with 20 mg/day of pravastatin during a 16-week follow-up period. Pre- and post-treatment samples were analyzed for procollagen I aminoterminal peptide (PINP) and bone alkaline phosphatase (bAP) as markers of bone formation, carboxyterminal telopeptide of collagen I (CTX) as a marker of bone resorption, and procollagen III aminoterminal propeptide (PIIINP) as a marker of fibrogenesis.", 
    "64": "Total cholesterol decreased from 7.26+/-0.83 to 6.1+/-0.77 mmol/l with pravastatin treatment. PINP levels significantly increased (from 33.6+/-13 to 37.4+/-16, p=0.03) without changes in bAP or CTX. Individual changes in PINP correlated with individual reduction in cholesterol levels (r=0.337, p=0.04). There was no significant change in PIIINP concentration.",

    "66": "Angiotensin (Ang) II is capable of producing inflammatory changes by signals through its AT1 receptor. Reactive oxygen species production, adhesion molecule expression, chemokines, and other mediators are involved. Nuclear factor-kappaB (NK-kappaB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) are two of the transcription factors activating the responsible genes. We have studied Ang II-independent modulating effects in a double transgenic rat model harboring the human renin and angiotensinogen genes. We have recently focused on the protective effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition and review these data here. We found that cerivastatin decreased mortality, lowered blood pressure, preserved renal function, decreased cardiac hypertrophy, and inhibited the entire chain of inflammatory events. Furthermore, NF-kappaB and AP-1 activation was sharply attenuated. We also observed that cerivastatin blocked ERK1/2 phosphorylation in vivo and in vitro. Cerivastatin also inhibited phorbol ester-transmitted events in vascular smooth muscle cells. Because Rho, a member of the Ras protein superfamily is important to Ang II-dependent and -independent vascular smooth muscle signaling events, we suggest that cerivastatin may act by inhibiting the prenylation, membrane anchoring, and subsequent activation of Ras proteins. These data may in part explain cholesterol-independent, HMG-CoA reductase-related, protective effects.", 
    "67": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors prevent the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate and thereby inhibit the synthesis of other products derived from this metabolite. This includes a number of small prenylated GTPases involved in cell growth, motility, and invasion. We studied the effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (fluvastatin and lovastatin) on in vitro invasion of human pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cells. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) induced a dose-dependent increase of PANC-1 cell invasion in a modified Boyden chamber assay. Stimulation of cancer cells with EGF induced translocation of RhoA from the cytosol to the membrane fraction and actin stress fiber assembly. Furthermore, Clostridium botulinum C3 transferase, a specific inhibitor of Rho, inhibited the ability of EGF to promote invasion, indicating that EGF-induced cancer cell invasion is regulated by Rho signaling. Treatment of PANC-1 cells with fluvastatin markedly attenuated EGF-induced translocation of RhoA from the cytosol to the membrane fraction and actin stress fiber assembly, whereas it did not inhibit the tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor and c-erbB-2. The induction of cancer cell invasion by EGF was inhibited by the addition of fluvastatin or lovastatin in a dose-dependent manner. The effects of fluvastatin or lovastatin on cell morphology and invasion were reversed by the addition of all-trans-geranylgeraniol but not by the addition of all-trans-farnesol. These results suggest that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors affect RhoA activation by preventing geranylgeranylation, which results in inhibition of EGF-induced invasiveness of human pancreatic cancer cells.", 
    "68": "Male rabbits fed a 0.5% cholesterol diet for 8 wk were divided into three groups. Group 1 was hypercholesterolemic; group 2 was fed a regular diet for an additional 12 wk; and group 3 was fed a regular diet with simvastatin (5 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)). Simvastatin treatment reduced the atherosclerotic area and total and esterified cholesterol concentrations in the thoracic aorta. Tone-related basal nitric oxide (NO) release was highest in group 3. Acetylcholine-induced, NO-dependent relaxation was improved in group 3 compared with group 2. Amount of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA in vessels increased in group 1, compared with normal aorta, and decreased in group 2; however, it did not decrease in group 3. The amount of O released from vessels increased in group 1 and group 2 compared with normal rabbits; however, it decreased in group 3, especially in the endothelial cells. Peroxynitrite determined by nitrotyrosine staining decreased in group 3. Additionally, the arteries of rabbits fed a regular diet with or without simvastatin were investigated. The aorta from simvastatin-treated group showed increase of tone-related basal NO release and eNOS mRNA and decrease of O release. Taken together, upregulation of eNOS and decrease of O treatment were observed in vivo in the process of the sufficient stabilization of atheroma following simvastatin.", 
    "69": "The main therapy needed most in the bone field is an anabolic agent for the treatment of osteoporosis. Current drugs on the market, which included bisphosphonates, calcitonin, estrogen and related compounds, vitamin D analogues trabecular microarchitecture. Therefore, it would be desirable to have a satisfactory and universally and iprifalvone, are essentially bone resorption inhibitors that mainly act to stabilize bone mass. Patients with established osteoporosis have lost more than 50% of their bone mass at critical sites in the skeleton, and more over have marked disruption of acceptable drug that would stimulate new bone formation and correct this disturbance of trabecular microarchitecture characteristic of established osteoporosis. Recently inhibitors of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, which controls the first step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol, have been shown to stimulate bone formation in rodents both in vitro and in vivo. The effect is associated with an increased expression of the bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) gene in bone cells. These statins drugs are widely used agents for lowering cholesterol and reducing heart attacks, however they are also known to elicit numerous pleiotropic effects including inhibition of proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells, inhibition of tumor growth and anti-inflammatory activity. Some of these effects have been attributed to not only to the reduction of cholesterol synthesis by inhibition of the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme but also by the concurrent reduction in downstream metabolites of the mevalonate pathway such as mevalonate, farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. The findings that statins are capable of increasing bone formation and bone mass in rodents suggests a potential new action for the statins, which may be beneficial in patients with established osteoporosis where marked bone loss has occurred. Recent clinical data suggests that they may reduce the risk of fracture in patients taking these drugs. However, their precise role can only be determined by appropriate randomized clinical trials, which demonstrate their efficacy in this regard in patients.",

Changes in cell morphology and actin cytoskeleton were evaluated using a phase-contrast microscope and by fluorescent staining of actin cables with TRITC-phalloidin.", 
    "72": "We found that lovastatin showed an important antiproliferative effect on human RPE cells in culture. This effect was clearly dose-dependent, and adding mevalonate could reverse it. We also found that lovastatin induced changes in the distribution of actin cytoskeleton and, finally, that it also induced RPE apoptosis. Manumycin A, farnesyltransferase inhibitor III and N-acetyl-S-farnesyl-L-cysteine also showed antiproliferative effects in RPE. However, they do not have any effect on cell morphology or induction of apoptosis.", 
    "73": "We identified various effects of lovastatin on human RPE cultures: inhibition of cell proliferation, modifications of the phenotype and induction of apoptosis. Interestingly, the addition of different inhibitors of protein isoprenylation only affected the proliferation of the cells. There was no evidence that isoprenylated proteins inhibition is related to lovastatin-induced RPE apoptosis.", 
    "74": "Macrophages secrete matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), an enzyme that weakens the fibrous cap of atherosclerotic plaques, predisposing them to plaque rupture and subsequent ischemic events. Recent work indicates that statins strongly reduce the possibility of heart attack. Furthermore, these compounds appear to exert beneficial effects not only by lowering plasma low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol but also by directly affecting the artery wall. To evaluate whether statins influence the proinflammatory responses of monocytic cells, we studied their effects on the chemotactic migration and MMP-9 secretion of human monocytic cell line THP-1. Simvastatin dose dependently inhibited THP-1 cell migration mediated by monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of about 50 nM. It also inhibited bacterial lipopolysaccharide-stimulated secretion of MMP-9. The effects of simvastatin were completely reversed by mevalonate and its derivatives, farnesylpyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, but not by ubiquinone. Additional studies revealed similar but more profound inhibitory effects with L-839,867, a specific inhibitor of geranylgeranyl transferase. However, alpha-hydroxyfarnesyl phosphonic acid, an inhibitor of farnesyl transferase, had no effect. C3 exoenzyme, a specific inhibitor of the prenylated small signaling Rho proteins, mimicked the inhibitory effects of simvastatin and L-839,867. These data supported the role of geranylgeranylation in the migration and MMP-9 secretion of monocytes.",

Immunosuppression with corticosteroids and cyclosporine has been associated with hyperlipidemia. Pravastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, has been shown to be effective and safe for cholesterol reduction in adult heart transplant recipients. To our knowledge the safety and efficacy of pravastatin therapy in pediatric and adolescent heart transplant populations have not been previously analyzed. Therefore, we evaluated lipid profiles, liver transaminases, rejection data, and possible side effects in pediatric and adolescent cardiac transplant recipients treated with pravastatin.", 
    "76": "The study group consisted of 40 cardiac transplant recipients 10 to 21 years old (mean age 16.9 years). Twenty-two patients received pravastatin in addition to an immunosuppressive regimen of either cyclosporine or tacrolimus, azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone. Serial determinations of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides were available for all pravastatin-treated patients. Pre-treatment lipid values and hepatic transaminases were compared with those measured after therapy with pravastatin. Comparison of pravastatin-induced lipid reduction between groups treated with cyclosporine vs tacrolimus was also made.", 
    "77": "Patients receiving pravastatin experienced a mean 32 mg/dl decrease in TC (p < 0.005) and a mean 31 mg/dl decrease in LDL (p < 0.005), regardless of their immunosuppressive regimen. No statistical differences occurred in the magnitude of mean lipid reduction induced by pravastatin between the groups treated with cyclosporine vs tacrolimus. No significant changes in hepatic transaminase levels were noted, and no clinical evidence of pravastatin-induced myositis occurred in any subjects.", 
    "78": "Pravastatin therapy is effective and safe when used in pediatric and adolescent cardiac transplant recipients. Although the pravastatin-induced reduction in TC and LDL was more pronounced in patients receiving cyclosporine, the reduction was not statistically different from that in the tacrolimus group.

Long-term studies are required to evaluate the effect of pravastatin therapy on the incidence of accelerated coronary atherosclerosis in this population.", 
    "79": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) significantly reduce cardiovascular mortality associated with hypercholesterolemia. There is evidence that statins exert beneficial effects in part through direct effects on vascular cells independent of lowering plasma cholesterol. We characterized the effect of a 30-day treatment with atorvastatin in normocholesterolemic, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Systolic blood pressure was significantly decreased in atorvastatin-treated rats (184+/-5 versus 204+/-6 mm Hg for control). Statin therapy improved endothelial dysfunction, as assessed by carbachol-induced vasorelaxation in aortic segments, and profoundly reduced angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction. Angiotensin type 1 (AT(1)) receptor, endothelial cell NO synthase (ecNOS), and p22phox mRNA expression were determined with quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Atorvastatin treatment downregulated aortic AT(1) receptor mRNA expression to 44+/-12% of control and reduced mRNA expression of the essential NAD(P)H oxidase subunit p22phox to 63+/-7% of control. Aortic AT(1) receptor protein expression was consistently decreased. Vascular production of reactive oxygen species was reduced to 62+/-12% of control in statin-treated SHR, as measured with lucigenin chemiluminescence assays. Accordingly, treatment of SHR with the AT(1) receptor antagonist fonsartan improved endothelial dysfunction and reduced vascular free-radical release. Moreover, atorvastatin caused an upregulation of ecNOS mRNA expression (138+/-7% of control) and an enhanced ecNOS activity in the vessel wall (209+/-46% of control). Treatment of SHR with atorvastatin causes a significant reduction of systolic blood pressure and a profound improvement of endothelial dysfunction mediated by a reduction of free radical release in the vasculature. The underlying mechanism could in part be based on the statin-induced downregulation of AT(1) receptor expression and decreased expression of the NAD(P)H oxidase subunit p22phox, because AT(1) receptor activation plays a pivotal role for the induction of this redox system in the vessel wall.", 
    "80": "Taking into account the species and sex differences in drug interactions based on the inhibition of cytochrome P450 (P450)-mediated drug metabolism, we examined whether the interaction between simvastatin and itraconazole observed in humans could also occur in rats, the most commonly used animal species for pharmacokinetic studies. Itraconazole inhibited the in vitro metabolism of simvastatin in female rat liver microsomes, but not in male rat liver microsomes. Using anti-P450 antisera, the main P450 isozyme responsible for the metabolism of simvastatin was identified as CYP3A in female rats and CYP2C11 in male rats. Therefore, the sex difference in the inhibition of simvastatin metabolism by itraconazole seems to be caused by a difference in the P450 isozymes responsible for the metabolism of simvastatin in male and female rats and the different ability of itraconazole to inhibit CYP3A and CYP2C11. In addition, the effect of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin in rats was also investigated. The area under the curve value of simvastatin was increased approximately 1.6-fold by the concomitant use of itraconazole (50 mg/kg) in female rats, whereas in male rats, itraconazole had no effect. In conclusion, it was found that the results obtained in male rats did not reflect the results in humans as far as the inhibition of simvastatin metabolism by itraconazole was concerned. The P450 isozymes involved in the metabolism of drugs should be taken into consideration when rats are used as a model animal for humans in the investigation of drug interactions.", 
    "81": "Mevastatin is an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. Butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid, reduces proliferation and induces differentiation of human colon cancer cells. The aim of our study was to determine the effect of mevastatin, alone or in combination with butyrate, on proliferation, the cell cycle and apoptosis in the human colorectal carcinoma cell line Caco-2. In this report we show that mevastatin combined with butyrate synergistically suppressed growth of Caco-2 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In addition, incubation with mevastatin arrested cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle after 24 h with a switch to the G2/M phase after 72 h. This was accompanied by a down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk) 4 and cdk 6 as well as cyclin D1, while cdk 2 and cyclin E protein levels remained unchanged during mevastatin treatment. Cell cycle inhibitors p21 and p27 were significantly upregulated by mevastatin. The proapoptotic properties of mevastatin were further enhanced by co-incubation with butyrate. Lastly, the effects of mevastatin could be reversed by addition of mevalonate, but not farnesyl- or geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, intermediate products of cholesterol synthesis, to the medium. These results suggest that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors like mevastatin may enhance the antiproliferative effect of butyrate in colon cancer cells via induction of apoptosis together with a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest.",

    "83": "An economic model was developed to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of alternative HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins)--atorvastatin, cerivastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin--to achieve target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in a population of secondary CHD prevention patients. By using a cholesterol target as the endpoint of interest and a dose titration approach, the model assumes that the statins demonstrate a class effect through cholesterol lowering. The model was used to estimate the proportion of patients achieving target LDL-C levels (< 3 mmol/l) under each scenario tested. Total costs and incremental cost-effectiveness relative to no treatment and to the lowest cost option were estimated for each scenario. Total costs were highest for pravastatin and lowest for cerivastatin. Compared with no treatment, the incremental cost per patient treated to target LDL-C varied between 383 Pounds (atorvastatin) and 1213 Pounds (pravastatin). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in comparison with the lowest cost treatment (cerivastatin) were 141 Pounds per additional patient achieving target LDL-C with atorvastatin, and 275 Pounds with simvastatin. Fluvastatin and pravastatin were both less effective and more expensive than the lowest cost therapy. Although cerivastatin was associated with lowest expected costs, therapy with atorvastatin achieved the lowest cost-effectiveness ratios. Hence atorvastatin would allow the largest number of patients to be treated to target LDL-C within a fixed drug budget. Choosing between drug therapies on the basis of price alone may be misleading if the effectiveness of therapies varies.",

We found that lovastatin modulates the signal transducing phosphorylation cascade in vascular smooth muscle cells in a mevalonate-independent manner. Lovastatin was found to distinctively increase total phosphotyrosine levels in smooth muscle cells, an effect which could not be restored by mevalonate. At a concentration of 5 micromol/L lovastatin had a highly specific effect on the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. The expression of p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was clearly reduced, but could be restored by addition of mevalonate, while the phosphorylation of p44 was mildly suppressed and the phosphorylation of p42 MAPK was reduced to non-detectable levels. While the phosphorylation of p44 MAPK could partially be restored by addition of mevalonate, the reduced phosphorylation of p42 MAPK could not be restored by addition of excessive doses of mevalonate or stimulation of the cells with basic fibroblast growth factor. Concurrently the expression of the GTP-binding Ras protein was significantly elevated at 5 and 20 micromol/L lovastatin, this effect being attenuated by addition of mevalonate to cell cultures.

Simvastatin's inhibitory effect was reversed by the cholesterol synthesis pathway intermediates mevalonate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate but not squalene, indicating the involvement of protein prenylation in this process. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that induction of class II transactivator (CIITA), and consequently, HLA-DRalpha mRNA, is abrogated by simvastatin. Although signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-1 is a critical CIITA gene transactivator, immunofluorescence studies, Western blotting, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that IFN-gamma-induced STAT-1 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding are not affected by simvastatin. However, simvastatin inhibited IFN-gamma-induced transactivation of a CIITA promoter IV reporter construct, indicating the involvement of this promoter in the inhibitory effect of simvastatin.",

    "110": "In vitro and in vivo evidence of a decrease in vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration induced by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors has been reported. When added to SMC cultures for 6 hours, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors fluvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin at 1 micromol/L resulted in a 48%, 50%, and 16% suppression, respectively, of human coronary SMC migration; these reductions mirrored the suppression in oxidative stress induced by 1 micromol/L lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC) of 50%, 53% and 19%, respectively. The hydroxylated metabolites of fluvastatin, M(2) and M(3), at 1 micromol/L also suppressed the enhancement of SMC migration by 58% and 45% and the increase in oxidative stress induced by lyso-PC of 58% and 49%, respectively. Lyso-PC activated phospholipase D and protein kinase C (PKC), and this activation was also suppressed by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. The inhibition of phospholipase D and PKC was reversed by 100 micromol/L mevalonate, its isoprenoid derivative, farnesol, and geranylgeraniol but not by 10 micromol/L squalene. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides at 5 micromol/L to PKC-alpha, but not those to the PKC-beta isoform, suppressed the lyso-PC-mediated increases in SMC migration and oxidative stress. These findings suggest that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have direct antimigratory effects on the vascular wall beyond their effects on plasma lipids and that they might exert such antimigratory effects via suppression of the phospholipase D- and PKC (possibly PKC-alpha)-induced increase in oxidative stress, which might in turn prevent significant coronary artery disease.",

A synergistic interaction between the two drugs was found. We have demonstrated that the interaction does not occur at the level of RAS but may involve lovastatin's effect of downregulating MAPK activity and preventing ara-C-induced MAPK activation. These studies represent the first description of a potentially beneficial interaction between lovastatin and ara-C that could be applied to the treatment of human leukemia.", 
    "112": "Plant sterols may be a useful additive therapy in the treatment of hypercholesterolaemic patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a fat spread enriched with vegetable oil sterols on plasma lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein concentrations. A randomised double blind placebo-controlled crossover trial with two consecutive periods of 8 weeks was conducted. 30 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia treated concurrently with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) and 32 patients with type IIa primary hypercholesterolaemia with a total cholesterol concentration >6.5 mmol/l not taking lipid-lowering drug therapy were recruited from a hospital lipid clinic. The active treatment was a fortified fat spread (25 g/day) providing 2.5 g of plant sterols. The control spread was indistinguishable in taste and appearance. Comparison at the end of the two 8-week trial periods showed a statistically significant reduction in total and LDL-cholesterol with use of the fortified spread but the results were confounded by a carry-over effect, which was partly explained by changes in the background diet. Because a carry-over effect was present, further analyses were restricted to the parallel arms of the first treatment period and were conducted on an intention to treat basis. After 4 weeks, LDL-cholesterol had decreased by 0.04 mmol/l ([0.8%] 95% confidence interval -0.44-0.37 NS) in the placebo group and decreased by -0.76 mmol/l ([15.0%] 95% CI -1.03--0.48, P<0.0001) in the active treatment group. After 8 weeks, the corresponding results were 0.0 mmol/l ([0.0%] 95% CI -0.26-0.24 NS) and -0.51 mmol/l ([10.0%] 95% CI -0.73--0.29 P<0.0001). There were no significant changes in apolipoprotein AI or B concentrations in the placebo group, but there was a small but statistically significant increase in apolipoprotein AI and a decrease in apolipoprotein B in the active treatment group. HDL cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were unchanged. There was no difference in response between patients with statin-treated familial hypercholesterolaemia and patients with type IIa hyperlipoproteinaemia. We conclude that a fortified fat spread enriched with vegetable oil sterols reduces LDL-cholesterol by 10-15% with no difference in response between hypercholesterolaemic patients prescribed statins and those not taking lipid-lowering drug therapy.", 
    "113": "We investigated the protective effects of the traditional Japanese herbal medicine Saiko-ka-ryukotsu-borei-to (Chai-Hu-Jia-Long-Gu-Mu-Li-Tang in Chinese) (SRBT) against hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerotic lesions. We focused on atherosclerosis using female heterozygous Kurosawa and Kusanagi-hypercholesterolemic (KHC) rabbits. The total plasma cholesterol levels increased for up to 12 weeks after beginning a diet containing 0.1% cholesterol and then reached a plateau of about 600 mg dl(-1). When SRBT was administered at a dose of 1.0 g kg(-1)per day for 24 weeks, total plasma cholesterol levels were significantly decreased after 20-24 weeks. On the other hand, pravastatin at a dose of 10 mg kg(-1)per day produced a significant decrease in total plasma cholesterol levels from 4 to 24 weeks (about 105-130 mg dl(-1)). Moreover, 1.0 g kg(-1)per day of SRBT significantly decreased plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels but did not change either very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), or high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. Animals that received pravastatin had significantly decreased LDL cholesterol levels and VLDL cholesterol levels after 8 weeks and at 24 weeks. We also examined the expression of apoB, E and LDL receptor mRNA levels in the liver at 24 weeks after beginning the administration of 1.0 g kg(-1)per day of SRBT. Both apoE and LDL receptor mRNA levels were significantly increased compared with those in rabbits receiving the 0.1% cholesterol diet. SRBT at a dose of 1.0 g kg(-1)per day significantly depressed the intimal surface area of the thoracic aortae involved with atheromatous plaques. The present results suggest that SRBT may protect against hypercholesterolemia and atheromatous lesions by affecting apoE and LDL receptor mRNA gene expression in the liver.", 
    "114": "Embryonic stem (ES) cells have the capacity to differentiate into various cell types in vitro. In this study, we show that retinoic acid is important for the commitment of ES cells into osteoblasts. Culturing retinoic acid treated ES cells in the presence of the osteogenic supplements ascorbic acid and beta-glycerophosphate resulted in the expression of several osteoblast marker genes, osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase, and osteopontin. However, there was only a slight amount of mineralized matrix secretion. Addition of bone morphogenic protein-2 or compactin, a drug of the statin family of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, resulted in a greatly enhanced formation of bone nodules. Compactin did not modify the expression of osteogenic markers, but at the late stage of differentiation promoted an increase in BMP-2 expression. These results establish ES-cell derived osteogenesis as an effective model system to study the molecular mechanisms by which the statin compactin promotes osteoblastic differentiation and bone nodule formation.", 
    "115": "Several studies have demonstrated that any beneficial effects of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins), of which simvastatin (Merck Sharp & Dohme) is an example, on coronary events are linked to their hypocholesterolemic properties. The in vivo effects of simvastatin treatment on lipase (GEH = glycerol ester hydrolase) and cholesterol esterase (CEase) activity in the serum of men with coronary heart disease (CHD) were examined. GEH and CEase activity in the serum of men with CHD, before simvastatin treatment, was lower than in the control subjects. In our study we have provided evidence that simvastatin increases GEH activity in a time-dependent manner, but has no effect on CEase activity. This suggests that simvastatin can directly affect acylglycerol metabolism by an increase in GEH activity and may therefore be suitable for the treatment of combined lipoprotein disorders characterized by elevation of triacylglycerols.", 
    "116": "A series of 3,5-dihydroxyheptenoic acid derivatives containing pyrazolopyridine, isoxazolopyridine, thienopyridine, and pyrazolopyrimidine as a key scaffold was synthesized from condensed pyridine and condensed pyrimidine carboxylic acid esters by homologation, aldol condensation with ethyl acetoacetate dianion, and stereoselective reduction of the 5-hydroxyketone. Several compounds in the series were found to have potent HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activities in vitro and marked cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitory activities in vivo. It has been shown that these scaffolds can be used as a suitable replacement for the hexahydronaphthalene ring present in naturally occurring HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.", 
    "117": "The fibrinolytic inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) plays a role in the development of atherothrombosis and is produced by macrophages that infiltrate the atherosclerotic vessel wall. Because statins are effective in reducing atherosclerosis, we investigated if they modulate the synthesis of PAI-1 in human monocytes/macrophages. To this end, we studied the effect of atorvastatin in different models of monocyte/macrophage differentiation, such as differentiated human promyelocytic cell line HL-60 and human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages. HL-60 cells were differentiated along monocyte lineage by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or a mixture of transforming growth factor-beta type 1 (TGF-beta1)/1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (D3). In these conditions, PAI-1 synthesis was strongly induced and atorvastatin upregulated this synthesis, especially during TGF-beta1/D3-induced differentiation. Recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) strongly upregulated PAI-1 synthesis in PMA- or TGF-beta1/D3-differentiated cells, and the potentiating effect of atorvastatin was of the same order as in the absence of TNF-alpha. Mevalonate reversed the enhancing effect of atorvastatin. In mature human monocyte-derived macrophages, atorvastatin, alone or in combination with TNF-alpha, TGF-beta1, or PMA, did not exert any significant effect on PAI-1 synthesis. Basal production of urokinase (uPA), which was below detection limits in HL-60 cells and very low in human monocyte-derived macrophages, was not altered by atorvastatin. These results show that atorvastatin upregulates PAI-1 synthesis during the early stages of monocyte/macrophage differentiation, but has no effect on PAI-1 and uPA synthesis in mature human monocyte-derived macrophages. Atorvastatin did not significantly interact with the upregulating action of TNF-alpha on PAI-1 synthesis during differentiation.", 
    "118": "Several studies have shown cardiovascular benefit in treating hypercholesterolemia with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. However, in addition to the lowering of cholesterol, the beneficial effects of this inhibitor reflect other pharmacological activities. Whether these beneficial effects are partly mediated by changes in fibrinolytic factors remains to be proven, since clinical studies on the effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on fibrinolytic factors have not yielded consistent results. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of fluvastatin on fibrinolytic factors in hypercholesterolemic patients. After 6 weeks on a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet, 23 outpatients known to have primary hypercholesterolemia with low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) > or = 130 mg/dl with at least 2 risk factors or fasting LDL-C > or = 160 mg/dl were selected for the study. Venous blood samples were collected at baseline and at 8 weeks after fluvastatin therapy (40 mg/day) to measure of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen activators inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), fibrinogen, D-dimer and lipid profile. After 8 weeks of therapy, fluvastatin reduced serum cholesterol by 11% (261.9 mg/dl vs 233.2 mg/dl, P < 0.01) and LDL-C by 22% (191.9 mg/dl vs 149.3 mg/dl, P < 0.01). D-dimer was significantly decreased (0.38 ng/L vs 0.28 ng/L, P = 0.02) and tPA, PAI-1 and fibrinogen tended to decrease after therapy. Fluvastatin therapy improved fibrinolytic profile; the result of this study may in part explain the benefit of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor on cardiovascular system other than lipid lowering.", 
    "119": "Ubiquitination is used to target both normal proteins for specific regulated degradation and misfolded proteins for purposes of quality control destruction. Ubiquitin ligases, or E3 proteins, promote ubiquitination by effecting the specific transfer of ubiquitin from the correct ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, or E2 protein, to the target substrate. Substrate specificity is usually determined by specific sequence determinants, or degrons, in the target substrate that are recognized by the ubiquitin ligase. In quality control, however, a potentially vast collection of proteins with characteristic hallmarks of misfolding or misassembly are targeted with high specificity despite the lack of any sequence similarity between substrates. In order to understand the mechanisms of quality control ubiquitination, we have focused our attention on the first characterized quality control ubiquitin ligase, the HRD complex, which is responsible for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) of numerous ER-resident proteins. Using an in vivo cross-linking assay, we directly examined the association of the separate HRD complex components with various ERAD substrates. We have discovered that the HRD ubiquitin ligase complex associates with both ERAD substrates and stable proteins, but only mediates ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme association with ERAD substrates. Our studies with the sterol pathway-regulated ERAD substrate Hmg2p, an isozyme of the yeast cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme HMG-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR), indicated that the HRD complex discerns between a degradation-competent \"misfolded\" state and a stable, tightly folded state. Thus, it appears that the physiologically regulated, HRD-dependent degradation of HMGR is effected by a programmed structural transition from a stable protein to a quality control substrate.", 
    "120": "Statins are inhibitors of the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. In addition to reducing LDL cholesterol, statin treatment increases the levels of the antiatherogenic HDL and its major apolipoprotein apoA-I. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of apoA-I regulation by statins. Treatment with statins increased apoA-I mRNA levels in human HepG2 hepatoma cells, and this effect was reversed by the addition of mevalonate, implicating HMG-CoA reductase as the relevant target of these drugs. Pretreatment with Actinomycin D abolished the increase of apoA-I mRNA, indicating that statins act at the transcriptional level. Indeed, statins increased the human apoA-I promoter activity in transfected cells, and we have identified a statin response element that coincides with a PPARalpha response element known to confer fibrate responsiveness to this gene. The statin effect could be abolished not only by mevalonate, but also by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, whereas inhibition of geranylgeranyl transferase activity or treatment with an inhibitor of the Rho GTP-binding protein family increased PPARalpha activity. Using dominant negative forms of these proteins, we found that Rho A itself mediates this response. Because cotreatment with statins and fibrates activated PPARalpha in a synergistic manner, these observations provide a molecular basis for combination treatment with statins and fibrates in coronary heart disease.", 
    "121": "3-Hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors are established anti-lipidemic agents. They also exert immunomodulatory effects. Two recent reports suggest that pravastatin may be useful in decreasing the incidence and severity of acute rejections (ARs) in heart and kidney transplant recipients. We undertook this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind trial to investigate the effect of lovastatin on acute renal allograft rejection. Sixty-five consecutive, one-haplotype-matched, living related first renal transplant recipients were randomized to receive either lovastatin 20 mg/d or placebo for 3 months, in addition to cyclosporine, azathioprine, and steroids. Lipid levels, AR episodes, and liver and muscle enzymes were followed for 3 months post-transplant. At the end of the study period, lovastatin had successfully controlled lipid levels. However, there was no effect on AR episodes (15.15% in the treatment group vs. 18.75% in the placebo group).", 
    "122": "Statin induced myopathy is the most commonly seen side effect in users of this family of drugs. Their different forms present with either creatine phosphokinase (CK) elevation or not, signs of in vivo oxidation injury or not or a combination of both. The pathogenetic background, however, still remains obscure. As MIBI, beside myocardial and tumour scintigraphy, is useful in detecting muscle metabolic abnormalities, an increased uptake of MIBI in the diseased muscular segments could be expected. We investigated seven patients (five males, two females; aged 36-56 years) with statin induced myopathy with either elevated CK, isoprostanes or muscle pains at varying combinations. MIBI whole-body imaging was done immediately, the patients still being on the respective statin. Sixteen patients (six males, 10 females) suffering from lung or breast cancer and being on statins served as controls. No uptake abnormalities in any muscular segment either in the patients or the control group were seen. Thus, MIBI scintigraphy is not useful, apparently, in diagnosing and eventually localizing statin induced myopathy. These findings indicate that MIBI scintigraphy is of no help for diagnosis and gaining further insight into statin induced myopathy.", 
    "123": "This study was directed at the effects of lovastatin on plasma glucose and insulin metabolism of patients with Type II B hyperlipemia. Thirty patients with Type II B hyperlipemia were observed. At the beginning, We detected the patients' TC, TG, HDL-C, VLDL-C with enzyme assay, calculated their LDL-C with formula, determined their plasmaglucose(PG) with oxidase assay and plasma insulin(PI) with immunoradioassay, and then we performed OGTT and insulin release test, these indices were detected again after the administration of 8 weeks' lovastatin therapy (20 mg per day). The results showed that, aftert the therapy, TC and LDL-C decreased significantly(P < 0.05), TG, HDL-C and VLDL-C had no significant change(P > 0.05). Fasting plasma glucose(FPG) and fasting plasma insulin(FPI) increased (the former, P < 0.05). Two hours after administration of glucose, the level of plasma glucose(2hPG) and plasma insulin(2hPI)increased(the latter, P < 0.05). 1/(FPG x FPI) had no significant change, but 1/(2hPG x 2hPI) decreased (P < 0.05). These data indicate that long-period use of lavastatin may cause insulin resistance. So we advise patients with Type II B hyperlipemia treated by statin to limit their glucose intake in case of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance.",

Pituitary GH is important for the normal regulation of hepatic LDL receptors (LDLR), for the enzymatic activity of bile acid regulatory cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (C7alphaOH), and for the maintenance of resistance to dietary cholesterol. The present study aimed to determine whether GH has beneficial effects on plasma lipids and hepatic cholesterol metabolism in mice devoid of LDLR. Compared with wild-type controls, LDLR-deficient mice had approximately 250% elevated plasma total cholesterol and approximately 50% increased hepatic cholesterol levels; hepatic HMG CoA reductase activity was reduced by 70%, whereas C7alphaOH activity was increased by 40%. In LDLR mice, GH infusion reduced plasma cholesterol and triglycerides up to 40%, whereas HMG CoA reductase and C7alphaOH activities were stimulated by approximately 50% and 110% respectively. GH also stimulated HMG CoA reductase and C7alphaOH activities in control mice, whereas hepatic LDLR and plasma lipoproteins were unchanged. The effects of cholestyramine and atorvastatin on C7alphaOH in LDLR-deficient mice were potentiated by GH, and this was associated with a further reduction in plasma cholesterol. GH treatment reduces plasma cholesterol and triglycerides and stimulates C7alphaOH activity in mice devoid of LDLR, particularly in combination with resin or statin treatment. The potential of GH therapy in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia should be evaluated.", 
    "125": "Lovastatin biosynthesis in Aspergillus terreus involves two unusual type I multifunctional polyketide syntheses (PKSs). Lovastatin nonaketide synthase (LNKS), the product of the lovB gene, is an iterative PKS that interacts with LovC, a putative enoyl reductase, to catalyze the 35 separate reactions in the biosynthesis of dihydromonacolin L, a lovastatin precursor. LNKS also displays Diels-Alderase activity in vitro. Lovastatin diketide synthase (LDKS) made by lovF, in contrast, acts non-iteratively like the bacterial modular PKSs to make (2R)-2-methylbutyric acid. Then, like LNKS, LDKS interacts closely with another protein, the LovD transesterase enzyme that catalyzes attachment of the 2-methylbutyric acid to monacolin J in the final step of the lovastatin pathway. Key features of the genes for these four enzymes and others, plus the regulatory and self-resistance factors involved in lovastatin production, are also described.", 
    "126": "The beta2 integrin leukocyte function antigen-1 (LFA-1) has an important role in the pathophysiology of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Here we report that statin compounds commonly used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia selectively blocked LFA-1-mediated adhesion and costimulation of lymphocytes. This effect was unrelated to the statins' inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase; instead it occurred via binding to a novel allosteric site within LFA-1. Subsequent optimization of the statins for LFA-1 binding resulted in potent, selective and orally active LFA-1 inhibitors that suppress the inflammatory response in a murine model of peritonitis. Targeting of the statin-binding site of LFA-1 could be used to treat diseases such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, ischemia/reperfusion injury and transplant rejection.", 
    "127": "Endothelial dysfunction is an early event in atherosclerosis and could be considered a response to the injury induced by major risk factors. There is evidence that endothelial dysfunction is intimately involved in the onset and the progression of cardiovascular disease through abnormalities in the production, release or degradation of endothelium-derived factors, mainly nitric oxide and endothelin 1. Several reports have shown that drugs of the statin class could have multiple beneficial effects related to endothelium-mediated vasoactive, antithrombotic, antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory actions. Thus, the question arises of whether endothelial cells are the main target of statin therapy, in the setting of both hypercholesterolemia and normocholesterolemia. Experimental and clinical studies are reported that could support this hypothesis.", 
    "128": "Reference pricing pharmaceuticals in New Zealand involves reimbursing drugs at the lowest price ruling in a given therapeutic subgroup, and has been argued to promote competition leading to equalised prices among similar drugs. Disappointment at the inability to contain public drug expenditures sufficiently has led to the augmentation of reference pricing with cross-product strategic agreements. These require firms seeking subsidisation of new drugs to significantly reduce their prices in unrelated markets, typically for relatively unpopular drugs. An examination of the markets for statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in New Zealand shows that in neither case has price matching voluntarily accompanied these agreements. Although imperfect drug substitutability appears to be an important factor in explaining some of these results, particularly for statins, intrafirm cross-subsidisation induced by agreements and industry concern about international benchmarking of drug prices are proposed as major likely sources of influence.", 
    "129": "In a 2-stage, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 dose-ranging trial evaluating the new statin rosuvastatin in men and postmenopausal women with hypercholesterolemia, the agent was found to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in a dose-related manner. With each doubling of the rosuvastatin dose (1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg/day), there was an additional 4.5% reduction in LDL-C. Reductions in LDL-C were statistically significant across all doses and ranged from 35% to 65%. The latter percent reduction surpasses the maximal reductions reported for all other statins when used for monotherapy and suggests that rosuvastatin might enable more patients with hypercholesterolemia to achieve target LDL-C levels. Across all doses, the new statin also had favorable effects on other lipid parameters and was well tolerated, with the incidence of adverse events similar to placebo.", 
    "130": "Statins have proved to be potent drugs for reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. However, because the response to current statin therapy regimens is not always sufficient to reach defined goal levels, additional drugs to lower LDL-C are needed. New drugs may soon be available to lower LDL-C levels by mechanisms that differ from those of the statins. Among these new agents are a bile acid binding resin, inhibitors of bile acid transport, inhibitors of cholesterol transport, inhibitors of cholesterol esterification, and triglyceride-lowering agents.", 
    "131": "The results of 5 major placebo-controlled trials evaluating the effects of statins in approximately 31,000 individuals with and without known coronary disease have demonstrated the following: statins reduce the incidence of coronary events, the reduction in relative risk for coronary events increases with the duration of therapy, the reduction in coronary events is proportional to the reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, and lower LDL-C levels are associated with lower event rates. The studies have also shown that statins are safe and effective in reducing the incidence of coronary events in women, individuals with diabetes, and patients older than 65 years of age and in reducing the risk of stroke and transient ischemic attacks in patients with coronary disease. Finally, studies indicate that statins ameliorate a variety of pathophysiologic processes that are associated with increased risk for atherosclerosis.", 
    "132": "The number of statins available to physicians continues to grow, leading to the question: Are all statins alike? Comparisons of side effects and safety profiles and the dose-response relationship among the different drugs show similar results. The cholesterol-lowering action of each depends on its ability to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). On the other hand, the molecular structures of the newer statins are not similar and could have an effect on the mechanism of action of the compounds. Differences in metabolism also suggest the possibility of serious drug-drug interactions, and differences in levels of lipid reduction at varying dosages among the statins point to clinical variation as well.", 
    "133": "With the strong correlation between the development of coronary heart disease and elevated levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), therapies that significantly lower lipid levels will be widely prescribed. Within the past 15 years, major studies have shown the statins to be very effective in lowering LDL-C levels. Are the effects of statin therapy powerful enough to justify administering one of these drugs to every patient with cardiovascular disease? Among the arguments favoring its general usage are its safety record, its high rate of patient compliance (especially in comparison to alternative therapies such as diet and exercise), and its cost effectiveness. On the other hand, elevated levels of LDL-C are not the only cause of atherosclerosis, so simply lowering the LDL-C level is not the sole answer to reducing the risk of mortality and morbidity from coronary heart disease."
