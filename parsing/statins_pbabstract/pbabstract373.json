    "1": "Lipid-lowering therapy reduces mortality in hypercholesterolemic women with CAD. In postmenopausal women HRT seems to increase survival, particularly those with ischemic heart disease, and this is partly due to changes in lipid levels.", 
    "2": "We studied 16 postmenopausal women with CAD and fasting total cholesterol <200 mg/dl and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol <130 mg/dl. We compared HRT (0.625 mg of conjugated estrogen and 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily) with simvastatin (20 mg daily) and their combination in a randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled study. Each treatment period was 8 weeks long with a 4-week washout interval between treatments.", 
    "3": "Simvastatin, HRT and their combination significantly reduced total and LDL cholesterol by 35%, 13%, and 33% and 45%, 20%, and 46%, respectively, compared to placebo (p < 0.001). However, simvastatin and the combination was superior to HRT (p < 0.001), and none of our patients had total cholesterol <180 mg/dl and LDL cholesterol <100 mg/dl on HRT alone. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol was not significantly affected by any of the active treatments, and triglycerides were lower during simvastatin therapy compared to placebo (p < 0.01). Apolipoprotein B was significantly reduced by simvastatin, alone and combined with HRT, by 39% and 35%, respectively, compared to placebo (p < 0.001). Alone and in combination with simvastatin, HRT significantly increased apolipoprotein A-I by 11% and 12%, respectively, compared to placebo (p < 0.05) and decreased lipoprotein (a) by 23% and 33%, respectively, compared to placebo (p < 0.05), whereas simvastatin had no significant effect on either of these parameters.", 
    "4": "In hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women with CAD, HRT exerts beneficial effects on plasma lipids but the levels currently recommended for secondary prevention are not achieved. Hormone replacement therapy combined with simvastatin is well tolerated and extremely effective, as the two therapies seem to be additive.", 
    "5": "Inhibition of 3-hydro-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibits the production of mevalonate and has been shown to suppress proliferation in many cell types. Therefore, 3-hydro-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors may have a beneficial effect in glomerular disease, because glomerular cell proliferation is a central feature in the active glomerular injury. This study examines the effect of simvastatin on glomerular pathology in a rat mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (GN) induced by anti-thymocyte antibody (anti-Thy 1.1 GN). There was no difference in the degree of the antibody and complement-mediated initial injuries between simvastatin-treated and control GN rats. The most pronounced feature of simvastatin-treated GN was the suppression of the early glomerular cell proliferation. The proliferative activity was maximal at day 4 after disease induction (26.5+/-7.0 of proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells/glomerulus); however, approximately 70% of proliferation was suppressed by simvastatin treatment. At day 4 after disease induction, simvastatin administration also decreased alpha-smooth muscle actin expression in the glomerulus, which is a marker for mesangial cell activation. Inhibition of monocyte/macrophage recruitment into glomeruli by simvastatin was also a prominent feature. There was a 30% decrease in the number of glomerular ED-1+ cells by simvastatin treatment at day 2 after disease induction. Furthermore, simvastatin remarkably suppressed subsequent mesangial matrix expansion and type IV collagen accumulation in glomeruli. We also found that the platelet-derived growth factor expression was reduced in simvastatin-treated nephritic rats, which might simply reflect the reduction in mesangial cell proliferation and mesangial cellularity. There was no significant difference in plasma cholesterol or triglyceride levels between simvastatin- and vehicle-treated nephritic rats at day 2 and day 4, which corresponded to the times when simvastatin treatment resulted in a reduction in mesangial cell proliferation. In conclusion, this is the first report to find that mesangial cell proliferation and matrix expansion have been blocked by simvastatin in vivo. The protective effect of simvastatin in the matrix expansion in anti-Thy1.1 GN was partly by inhibition of mesangial cell proliferation and monocyte/ macrophage recruitment into glomeruli, which were independent of a change in circulating lipids.", 
    "6": "In type 2 diabetes, it is not uncommon to find an elevated serum triglyceride and/or reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels; elevated total cholesterol levels often occur as well. To evaluate the short-term efficacy and tolerability of combination therapy with lovastatin and acipimox in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes who have mixed dyslipidemia, an open-label 6-month trial was conducted. All patients had type 2 diabetes (n = 33) with total cholesterol > or = 6.2 mmol/L and fasting triglyceride > or = 2.8 mmol/L, which had been confirmed twice and persisted for at least 12 weeks after introduction of diet control. After a 4-week run-in period, they were given lovastatin 40 mg daily at night for 12 weeks. Acipimox 250 mg three times a day was then added for a further 12 weeks. After 12 weeks of treatment with lovastatin alone, improvement was observed in total cholesterol (21% reduction), triglyceride (32% reduction), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (5.5% reduction), HDL cholesterol (11.6% elevation), apolipoprotein A-I (4.6% elevation), and apolipoprotein B (20.5% reduction). The addition of acipimox to lovastatin for an additional 12 weeks further reduced serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B, but this additional decrease was not statistically significant. However, HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I levels were significantly increased by the addition of acipimox (a 14.2% and 9.0% elevation, respectively). Serum creatine phosphokinase increased slightly after 12 weeks of lovastatin but decreased to a concentration similar to baseline after 12 weeks of combination treatment. No patients reported muscle pain or weakness or other side effects. Combination treatment with lovastatin and acipimox appears to be a safe and effective therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes and mixed dyslipidemia, and has particular benefit in elevating serum HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I levels.", 
    "7": "Sphingomyelin (SM) and cholesterol content is positively correlated in cellular membranes, and in several pathological and experimental conditions there is evidence for coregulation. The potential role of oxysterols and oxysterol binding protein (OSBP) in mediating the coregulation of cholesterol and SM was examined using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and cholesterol auxotrophic, sterol regulatory defective (SRD) 6 cells. SRD 6 cells grown in the presence or absence of cholesterol for 24 h displayed a 30-50% reduction in SM synthesis compared with control CHO 7 cells. SM synthesis in CHO 7 and cholesterol-supplemented SRD 6 cells was stimulated 2-fold by 25-hydroxycholesterol, but cholesterol-starved SRD 6 cells were unresponsive. Basal and 25-hydroxycholesterol-stimulated SM synthesis was also inhibited in lovastatin-treated wild-type CHO-K1 cells. Lack of 25-hydroxycholesterol activation of SM synthesis in cholesterol-starved SRD 6 and lovastatin-treated CHO-K1 cells was correlated with dephosphorylation of OSBP. In SRD 6 cells, this was evident after 12 h of cholesterol depletion, it occurred equally at all phosphorylation sites and was exacerbated by 25-hydroxycholesterol. Unlike CHO 7 cells, where OSBP was observed in small vesicles and the cytoplasm, OSBP in cholesterol-starved SRD 6 cells was constitutively localized in the Golgi apparatus. Supplementation with non-lipoprotein cholesterol promoted redistribution to vesicles and the cytoplasm. Similarly, OSBP in CHO-K1 cells grown in delipidated serum was predominantly in the Golgi apparatus. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) supplementation of CHO-K1 cells caused the redistribution of OSBP to the cytoplasm and small vesicles, and this effect was blocked by pharmacological agents \u00bf3-beta-[2-(diethylamino)ethoxy]androst-5-en-17-one and progesterone\u00bf, which inhibited LDL cholesterol efflux from lysosomes. The results showed that localization of OSBP between the Golgi apparatus and a cytoplasmic/vesicular compartment was responsive to changes in cholesterol content and trafficking. In cholesterol depleted SRD 6 cells, this was accompanied by dephosphorylation of OSBP and attenuation of 25-hydroxycholesterol activation of SM synthesis.", 
    "8": "Recent clinical trials have demonstrated beyond doubt that statins are effective in the prevention of acute coronary events. Critical analysis of these studies suggests that the benefits of statin therapy cannot be fully explained on the basis of reductions in plasma cholesterol levels. Accumulating knowledge of the actions of these drugs shows that they may prevent several processes that eventually lead to plaque rupture and the development of occlusive thrombosis, the basis of acute coronary events. Hence, statins may correct endothelial dysfunction (thus protecting against ischaemic injury), stabilise existing plaques and modify the coagulation pathway, thereby reducing the likelihood of a sudden vascular event. At a cellular level, these drugs inhibit the synthesis not just of cholesterol, but of other compounds important in cell proliferation. Antiproliferative effects have been demonstrated in vitro and may broaden the applications of statins to the treatment of noncardiovascular diseases. Finally, preliminary clinical studies indicate that as a result of immunosuppressive actions, statins may reduce the incidence of rejection following organ transplantation.", 
    "9": "Hyperlipidemia is a widely acknowledged side effect of thiazide diuretic therapy, but it is often dismissed as a short-term effect of high-dose therapy. Large clinical trials usually show no lipid change during late follow-up. These large trials use intention-to-treat analysis which masks the lipid effect. On-treatment analysis regularly reveals the persistence of hyperlipidemia during 4-5 years of treatment. Studies of low-dose thiazide therapy give conflicting results. Meta-analysis of these studies reveals hyperlipidemia of a milder degree than with high-dose thiazide treatment. However, a trade-off of effects is apparent because systolic blood pressure is lowered less well with low doses. Thus, thiazide effects on blood pressure and lipids are dose-dependent. Similar meta-analysis of indapamide 2.5 mg daily shows no adverse lipid effect and a lowering of blood pressure equivalent to 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. Regarding clinical events, low-dose thiazide treatment exerts primary prevention of coronary heart disease but provides less benefit against stroke and congestive heart failure than does high-dose therapy. Thus, an evidence-based therapeutic strategy for further reducing cardiovascular risk is as follows: initiate antihypertensive therapy with low-dose diuretics. Add beta-blockers and dihydropyridine-type calcium channel blockers for further antihypertensive effect, if needed. Hypertension resistant to a 3-drug regimen should be treated with high-dose thiazides. Lipids should be monitored at each step and treated with diet and statin drugs to maintain lipid goals. Risk factor control is an old concept that has yet to be effectively implemented.", 
    "10": "We have identified a novel fungal metabolite that is an inhibitor of human farnesyl-protein transferase (FPTase) by randomly screening natural product extracts using a high-throughput biochemical assay. Clavaric acid [24, 25-dihydroxy-2-(3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl)lanostan-3-one] was isolated from Clavariadelphus truncatus; it specifically inhibits human FPTase (IC50 = 1.3 microM) and does not inhibit geranylgeranyl-protein transferase-I (GGPTase-I) or squalene synthase activity. It is competitive with respect to Ras and is a reversible inhibitor of FPTase. An alkaline hydrolysis product of clavaric acid, clavarinone [2,24,25-trihydroxylanostan-3-one], lacking the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid side chain is less active as a FPTase inhibitor. Similarly, a methyl ester derivative of clavaric acid is also inactive. In Rat1 ras-transformed cells clavaric acid and lovastatin inhibited Ras processing without being overtly cytotoxic. Excess mevalonate reversed the effects of lovastatin but not of clavaric acid suggesting that the block on Ras processing by clavaric acid was due to inhibition of FPTase and not due to inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. Despite these results, the possibility existed that clavaric acid inhibited Ras processing by directly inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase. To directly examine the effects of clavaric acid and clavarinone on HMG-CoA reductase, cholesterol synthesis was measured in HepG2 cells. No inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase was observed indicating that the inhibition of Ras processing by this class of compounds is due to inhibition of FPTase. To date, clavaric acid is the second reported nitrogen-free compound that competes with Ras to inhibit FPTase activity. A series of related compounds derived from computer-based similarity searches and subsequent rational chemical synthetic design provided compounds that exhibited a range of activity (0.04 --> 100 microM) against FPTase. Modest changes in the structures of these inhibitors dramatically change the inhibitory activity of these inhibitors.", 
    "11": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (EC 1.1.1.88) inhibitors are the most effective drugs to lower cholesterol in transplant patients. However, immunosuppressants and several other drugs used after organ transplantation are cytochrome P4503A (CYP3A, EC 1.14.14.1) substrates. Pharmacokinetic interaction with some of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, specifically lovastatin and simvastatin, leads to an increased incidence of muscle skeletal toxicity in transplant patients. It is our objective to review the role of drug metabolism and drug interactions of lovastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, and cerivastatin. In the treatment of transplant patients, from a drug interaction perspective, pravastatin, which is not significantly metabolized by CYP enzymes, and fluvastatin, presumably a CYP2C9 substrate, compare favorably with the other statins for which the major metabolic pathways are catalyzed by CYP3A.", 
    "12": "Lovastatin, a fungal antibiotic used in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, is an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, the key regulatory enzyme in the mevalonate pathway of cholesterol synthesis. We examined the antitumor properties of lovastatin on the F3II sarcomatoid mammary carcinoma, a highly invasive and metastatic murine tumor model. Female BALB/c inbred mice were inoculated subcutaneously with F3II tumor cells and injected i.p. daily with 10 mg/kg body weight of lovastatin or administered p.o. at a level corresponding to the human dosage of 1-2 mg/kg/day. Treatment significantly prolonged tumor latency and reduced tumor formation and metastatic dissemination to the lungs from established mammary tumors. In vitro, antitumor properties of lovastatin were strongly associated with inhibition of tumor cell attachment and migration. These actions were prevented by addition of mevalonate but not by equivalent concentrations of farnesyl pyrophosphate. In accordance, Western blot assays showed that lovastatin effects did not appear to be related to modifications in Ras oncoproteins in our model. The present data indicate that lovastatin could be an antitumor agent with potentially useful clinical applications in breast cancer.", 
    "13": "We investigated the effect of 12 months' HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor treatment on plasma polyunsaturated fatty acid concentrations in 19 patients with hyperlipidemia. Arachidonic acid concentrations were significantly increased following treatment (from 110.1 +/- 20.4 mg/l to 129.2 +/- 31.6 mg/l, P < 0.05). The ratio of eicosapentaenoic acid to arachidonic acid was significantly decreased at the end of 12 months' treatment (from 0.702 +/- 0.370 to 0.541 +/- 0.204, P < 0.05). These results suggest that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may increase the synthesis of metabolites from arachidonic acid in patients with hyperlipidemia, and that the addition of fish oil is more effective for the prevention of coronary heart disease than HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors alone.", 
    "14": "Ischemic heart disease is a serious health problem because it causes considerable mortality and morbidity. Given the limited resources for health care, it is important to establish the costs associated with the benefits of its various treatment options. We therefore assessed the costs and benefits of medical treatment versus revascularization in a hypothetical cohort of 100 patients. A spreadsheet model was constructed using published data. The main outputs of this model were health-service costs per year and quality-adjusted survival estimates. In the United Kingdom, costs for treatments of less than 5,000 Pounds/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) are perceived as highly cost effective, whereas those over 10,000 Pounds/QALY are considered expensive. For patients with intractable symptoms, surgery is highly effective and has benefits on prognosis. In patients with well-controlled symptoms on medical therapy, the benefits of surgery are small and uncertain, and therefore medical therapy is the most cost-effective treatment. Overall, the preferred cost-effective option favored medical treatment.", 
    "15": "Cerivastatin, a novel HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, is exclusively cleared via cytochrome P450-mediated biotransformation and subsequent biliary and renal excretion of the metabolites. The presented study was performed to determine the influence of the gastric acid secretion inhibitor omeprazole on bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of cerivastatin.", 
    "16": "In a controlled, randomized, non-blind two-way crossover study single oral doses of 0.3 mg cerivastatin were administered in 12 healthy male subjects under fasting conditions either alone or together with 20 mg omeprazole following a 4-day pretreatment with oral 20 mg omeprazole once daily.", 
    "17": "The mean AUC and Cmax ratios (combination treatment versus monotherapy) including 90% confidence intervals were 1.00 (0.92 - 1.09) and 0.94 (0.80 - 1.16) for cerivastatin. Similar results were obtained for the metabolites of cerivastatin and for omeprazole.", 
    "18": "No metabolic inhibitory interaction was noted for either cerivastatin or its major active metabolites, nor for omeprazole, respectively. In addition, the change in gastric pH as consequence of the inhibition of gastric acid secretion exerted by omeprazole had no influence on cerivastatin absorption.", 
    "19": "We have reported that lovastatin attenuates the development of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The fall in arterial pressure is associated with an elevation in renal medullary blood flow, normalization of the pressure-natriuresis relationship, and diminished hypertrophy of renal arterioles. However, the mechanism by which lovastatin alters renal vascular tone is unknown. The present study examined the effects of lovastatin on renal vascular tone and the expression of G proteins. Four-week-old SHR were chronically treated with lovastatin (20 mg/kg/day) or vehicle by gavage for 4 weeks. At the end of the study, mean arterial pressure averaged 131 +/- 4 (n = 5) and 160 +/- 4 mm Hg (n = 6) in lovastatin- and vehicle-treated SHR, respectively. Renal arterioles isolated from lovastatin-treated SHR were significantly less responsive to norepinephrine and vasopressin than those obtained from vehicle-treated rats (ED50: 5.0 v 1.8 x 10(-7) mol/L for norepinephrine, and 8.0 v 5.2 x 10(-10) mol/L for vasopressin). The fall in renal vascular reactivity in lovastatin-treated SHR was associated with reduced levels of ras and rho proteins in renal arterioles, whereas the expressions of heterotrimeric G proteins (Gs Gq, Gi) were similar in renal arterioles from vehicle- and lovastatin-treated SHR. Overnight culture of renal arterioles with media containing lovastatin also diminished the expression of ras and rho proteins and the response to vasoconstrictors. These findings indicate that lovastatin diminishes the response to vasoconstrictors and the expression of small G proteins in the renal vasculature of SHR and suggest that a fall in the levels of ras and rho proteins in these vessels may contribute to the antihypertensive effects of lovastatin.", 
    "20": "Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase are very common and effective treatments for hyperlipidemia. Epidermal cholesterol synthesis has been shown to be essential for maintaining the cutaneous barrier function. We present two patients who experienced cheilitis after beginning treatment of hyperlipidemia with simvastatin (Zocor). The rash resolved after discontinuation of medication and subsequent treatment with topical moisturizers and topical corticosteroids. We suspect that skin barrier dysfunction may occur in the mucosa from inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase in a manner analogous to the epidermis.", 
    "21": "Lovastatin is oxidized by cytochrome P4503A to active metabolites but pravastatin is active alone and is not metabolized by cytochrome P450. Diltiazem, a substrate and a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P4503A enzymes, is commonly coadministered with cholesterol-lowering agents.", 
    "22": "This was a balanced, randomized, open-label, 4-way crossover study in 10 healthy volunteers, with a 2-week washout period between the phases. Study arms were (1) administration of a single dose of 20 mg lovastatin, (2) administration of a single dose of 20 mg pravastatin, (3) administration of a single dose of lovastatin after administration of 120 mg diltiazem twice a day for 2 weeks, and (4) administration of a single dose of pravastatin after administration of 120 mg diltiazem twice a day for 2 weeks.", 
    "23": "Diltiazem significantly (P < .05) increased the oral area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) of lovastatin from 3607 +/- 1525 ng/ml/min (mean +/- SD) to 12886 +/- 6558 ng/ml/min and maximum serum concentration (Cmax) from 6 +/- 2 to 26 +/- 9 ng/ml but did not influence the elimination half-life. Diltiazem did not affect the oral AUC, Cmax, or half-life of pravastatin. The average steady-state serum concentrations of diltiazem were not significantly different between the lovastatin (130 +/- 58 ng/ml) and pravastatin (110 +/- 30 ng/ml) study arms.", 
    "24": "Diltiazem greatly increased the plasma concentration of lovastatin, but the magnitude of this effect was much greater than that predicted by the systemic serum concentration, suggesting that this interaction is a first-pass rather than a systemic event. The magnitude of this effect and the frequency of coadministration suggest that caution is necessary when administering diltiazem and lovastatin together. Further studies should explore whether this interaction abrogates the efficacy of lovastatin or enhances toxicity and whether it occurs with other cytochrome P4503A4-metabolized 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, such as simvastatin, fluvastatin, and atorvastatin.", 
    "25": "Rupture of an instable plaque, characterized by a large lipid-rich central core, inflammatory cells, and a thin fibrous cap, causes sudden thrombus formation and acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Lipid lowering therapy by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors leads to reduction of cardiovascular complications, but has very small effect on the degree of stenosis of ACS. Oxidizing metabolites generated at the site of coronary angioplasty can induce chain reactions that may lead to restenosis. Probucol improves the restenosis rate after coronary angioplasty if given before PTCA (percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty). These results will provide a better understanding of drug action, help explain certain drug interactions, and facilitate the choice of a drug for ACS.",

In patients who have not met the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goal as recommended by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel II guidelines, atorvastatin 10-80 mg/d may be used as monotherapy or as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering agents and dietary modifications. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, atorvastatin 10-80 mg/d lowered LDL-C by 35-61% and triglyceride (TG) concentrations by 14-45%. In comparative trials, atorvastatin 10-80 mg/d showed a greater reduction of serum total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, TG concentrations, and apolipoprotein B-100 (apo B) compared with pravastatin, simvastatin, or lovastatin. In comparison, currently available HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (lovastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, cerivastatin) lower LDL-C concentrations by approximately 20-40% and TG concentrations by approximately 10-30%. In pooled placebo-controlled clinical trials of up to a duration of 52 weeks, atorvastatin in dosages up to 80 mg/d appeared to be well tolerated. The most common adverse effect of atorvastatin was gastrointestinal upset. The incidence of elevated serum hepatic transaminases may be greater at higher dosages of atorvastatin. The risk of myopathy and/or rhabdomyolysis is increased when an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor is taken concomitantly with cyclosporine, gemfibrozil, niacin, erythromycin, or azole antifungals.", 
    "31": "Atorvastatin appears to reduce TC, LDL-C, TG concentrations, and apo B to a greater extent than do currently available HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Atorvastatin may be preferred in patients requiring greater than a 30% reduction in LDL-C or in patients with both elevated LDL-C and TG concentrations, which may obviate the need for combination lipid-lowering therapy. Adverse effects of atorvastatin appear to be similar to those of other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and should be routinely monitored. Long-term safety data (> 1 y) on atorvastatin compared with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are still needed. Cost-effectiveness studies comparing atorvastatin with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors remain a subject for further investigation. Published clinical studies evaluating the impact of atorvastatin on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are still needed. Additionally, clinical studies evaluating the impact of lipid-lowering therapy in a larger number of women, the elderly (> 70 y), and patients with diabetes for treatment of primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease are needed.",

Moderate 5-7% average responses incorporated reductions of at least 0.6 mmol x (-1) in 40% of patients, consistent with a 25% fall in the risk of cardiac events if maintained for 2 years. Responses to medication were greater for up to 2194 patients who previously lost weight on diet, an effect not apparent for 291 patients on statins alone. Physicians worked with dieticians in most clinics, and with individually tailored diets but with incomplete appreciation of the differences between available dietary protocols.",

However, average responses are modest and physicians are not well informed of the dietary principles involved.", 
    "36": "A search for agents that can enhance low density lipoprotein (LDL) catabolism in Hep G2 cells has led to the identification of a fungal sesquiterpene ester, FR111142, as an active compound. The treatment of Hep G2 cells with 40 microM FR111142 at 37 degrees C for 18 h caused a 1.9- to 2.2-fold elevation of binding, internalization and degradation of 125I-LDL in the cells. The Scatchard analysis of the specific 125I-LDL binding demonstrated that the agent caused an increase in the maximum LDL binding along with a slight decrease in the apparent dissociation constant value. The effect of FR111142 was not seen in cells treated by the agent for shorter periods or in cycloheximide-treated cells, suggesting that the effect involves an induction of LDL binding sites. Unlike 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors, FR111142 affected neither cholesterol synthesis nor the level of LDL receptor in Hep G2 cells. These results suggest that FR111142 enhances LDL catabolism in Hep G2 cells by a mechanism that involves a receptor other than LDL receptor.", 
    "37": "Coronary atherosclerosis begins to develop in late adolescence and early adulthood. If intervention in coronary risk factors is delayed until middle-age, it is likely that a considerable number of patients will be lost to irreversible disease. Even with the dramatic cholesterol lowering that can be induced by statin drugs, coronary events can be reduced by only 25% to 40%, leaving most at-risk patients unprotected. Diet, exercise, and other nonpharmacological interventions have a role in the age of statins, not only to augment the effects of these drugs in high-risk patients, but also, by preventing atherogenesis in the first place, to reduce the number of at-risk patients.", 
    "38": "The Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) guidelines, published initially in 1988 and revised in 1993, are based on sentinel observations and early clinical trials in support of treating and preventing coronary artery disease by cholesterol lowering. With the conclusion of several large long-term trials using HMG CoA reductase inhibitors for primary and secondary coronary prevention, the ATP II recommendations, which remain remarkably accurate, can be supplemented with more evidence-based strategies. Increasing evidence suggests that thoughtful lipid management for coronary prevention should include a more complete assessment of lipoproteins with an emphasis on apolipoproteins, triglycerides, and very low-density (VLDL) remnant particles, LDL particle size, and lipoprotein(a). This review summarizes clinically relevant lipid metabolism with an emphasis on the concept of atherogenic plasma lipids, discusses the clinical benefits and specific uses of each of the lipid-lowering drug classes, and provides an analysis of recent cholesterol-lowering primary and secondary coronary prevention trials from which a new treatment strategy can be derived.",

Although benefit was first established in patients with severe hypercholesterolemia, more recent trials have extended the benefit to patients with mildly to moderately elevated cholesterol. In addition to improvements on the lipid profile, statins appear to confer nonlipid benefits, such as improved endothelial function, modification of plaque cellularity, and plaque stabilization.",

Pravastatin and R-416 in human plasma were isolated using solid phase extraction technique and analyzed by LC/APCI-MS. Selected ion monitoring was employed for selectivity and sensitivity, which enabled the quantification over a range of 0.625-80 mg/mL with acceptable precision and accuracy. No derivatization was required for these polar molecules. The retention times of the pravastatin, R-416 and the internal standard (R-1437) were 2.1, 2.5 and 3.9 min, respectively, with a total analysis time of 5 min. This method was validated and compared with the automated gas chromatography/negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry procedure.", 
    "41": "The increased risk of coronary artery disease in subjects with diabetes mellitus can be partially explained by the lipoprotein abnormalities associated with diabetes mellitus. Hypertriglyceridemia and low levels of high-density lipoprotein are the most common lipid abnormalities. In type 1 diabetes mellitus, these abnormalities can usually be reversed with glycemic control. In contrast, in type 2 diabetes mellitus, although lipid values improve, abnormalities commonly persist even after optimal glycemic control has been achieved. Screening for dyslipidemia is recommended in subjects with diabetes mellitus. A goal of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of less than 130 mg/dL and triglycerides lower than 200 mg/dL should be sought. Several secondary prevention trials, which included subjects with diabetes, have demonstrated the effectiveness of lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in preventing death from coronary artery disease. The benefit of lowering triglycerides is less clear. Initial approaches to lowering the levels of lipids in subjects with diabetes mellitus should include glycemic control, diet, weight loss, and exercise. When goals are not met, the most common drugs used are hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors or fibrates.", 
    "42": "Much diverse evidence suggests that the plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol play a causal role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic coronary heart disease. Until recently, clinical trials of LDL lowering, while showing significant reductions in coronary heart disease (CHD) rates, were not entirely convincing and left some questions of long-term toxicity unresolved. The results of a series of new trials using members of the powerful statin class of drugs are now being reported. Whether they are primary or secondary prevention studies, they have been uniformly successful in reducing mortality and morbidity from CHD and even total mortality, and have decreased the need for revascularization procedures. Their effectiveness is apparent in many different subgroups such as women, diabetics, hypertensives, and in stroke prevention. Statin drugs also have proven to be remarkably safe over the duration of the studies. Angiographic studies show an impact on coronary or carotid lesions.",

The benefits of statins in secondary prevention were clearer to them and the social and economic issues less complex than was the case for use in primary prevention. Respondents rarely said they appraised the methods and content of trials, rather they judged the trustworthiness of the source of trial evidence and interpreted it within the context of the economic and social factors which impinge on their practice. Moreover, trial data become relevant for routine practice only when underpinned by a consensus on these issues.",

Strategies such as teaching critical appraisal skills and guideline development may have little effect if they are separated from this process.", 
    "49": "Two novel point mutations in the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A lyase gene were found in a French patient with double heterozygous 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria. Amplification by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of the mRNA using five different pairs of oligonucleotides produced no differences in the fragments amplified with respect to the control. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis showed that only one amplified fragment was different in the patient vs. control. Sequencing of the amplified fragments showed two missense point mutations, A698G and T788C, each of them mixed with the wild-type sequence. These mutations produced the changes H233R and L263P, leading to changes in the enzyme activity, which was largely abolished. The father and one brother of the proband were heterozygous for the L263P mutation and the mother and one daughter were heterozygous for the H233R mutation, which confirms the double-heterozygous character of the patient. Another sibling was free of the mutations. An enzymatic restriction analysis has been proposed to screen the occurrence of these two mutations in future patients.", 
    "50": "HMG reductase inhibitors have significant desirable effects on patients with dyslipidemia. Multiple factors are involved in these desirable effects. Other factors that might play a role in the risk of coronary artery disease are fibrinogen concentration, homocysteine, Lp (a), small dense LDL, insulin resistance, and infection with chlamydia. High-dose reductase inhibitors may be indicated in select patients. The ideal end point may be 150 mg/dL for adults.", 
    "51": "3 beta-Hydroxycholest-5-en-7-one (I; 7-ketocholesterol) is an oxysterol of continuing interest in biology and medicine. In the present study, we have prepared a side-chain fluorinated analog, 3 beta-hydroxy-25,26,26,26,27,27,27-heptafluorocholest-5-en-7-one (VI), with the anticipation that the F7 substitution would block major metabolism of the 7-ketosterol, and thereby enhance its potential in vivo effects on serum cholesterol levels and other parameters. Chromium trioxide/dimethyl pyrazole oxidation of the acetate derivative of the previously described 25,26,26,26,27,27,27-heptafluorocholest-5-en-3 beta-ol (Swaminathan et al., 1993. J. Lipid Res. 34, 1805-1823) followed by mild alkaline hydrolysis gave VI. The effects of VI on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells, on acyl coenzyme A-cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) activity in rat jejunal microsomes, and on serum cholesterol levels and other parameters in male Sprague-Dawley rats were determined and compared with those obtained with I and with another alpha, beta-unsaturated ketosterol, i.e. 3 beta-hydroxy-5 alpha-cholest-8(14)-en-15-one (II). I and VI showed essentially the same potency, considerably less than that of II, in lowering the levels of HMG-CoA reductase activity in CHO-K1 cells. Whereas addition of II to rat jejunal microsomes inhibited ACAT activity (IC50 approximately 3 microM), I and VI had no effect under the conditions studied (from 1 to 16 microM). Dietary administration of I, at levels of 0.1 and 0.15%, had no effect on food consumption, gain in body weight, or serum cholesterol levels. At 0.2%, I caused a modest decrease in body weight gain and a slight decrease in serum cholesterol levels (relative to ad libitum but not pair-fed control animals). The F7-7-ketosterol VI, at 0.26% in diet (the molar equivalent of 0.2% I), had no effect on food consumption, body weight, or serum cholesterol levels. Administration of I (0.1, 0.15 or 0.2% in diet) caused increases in the weight of small intestine. In contrast, no effect of VI (0.26% in diet) on small intestinal weight was observed.", 
    "52": "The presence of the apolipoprotein E (apoE) allele epsilon4 is a major risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the molecular mechanism underlying the acceleration of AD development in individuals with epsilon4 remains to be determined. To investigate the isoform-specific effects of apoE on neurons, primary neuron cultures were prepared from fetal rat cerebral cortices. Inhibition by compactin, a 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor of de novo cholesterol synthesis, induced premature neuronal cell death in a dose-dependent manner. In the presence of compactin at a sublethal dose to the cells, rabbit beta-migrating very low density lipoprotein (beta-VLDL) with human apoE4 (the product of epsilon4) induced premature neuronal cell death, while that with apoE3 (the product of epsilon3) did not. Neurons cultured in the presence of apoE4, beta-VLDL, and compactin were shrunken and spherical, containing condensed chromatin and fragmented DNA, features characteristic of apoptosis. The addition of intermediate metabolites of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, including mevalonate and squalene, rescued neuronal cells incubated with apoE4 and beta-VLDL, in the presence of compactin. These results strongly suggest that a reduction in the level of endogenously synthesized cholesterol is a prerequisite for apoE4-induced neuronal cell death.", 
    "53": "Cardiovascular disease, including coronary heart disease, is the leading cause of death both in men and in women in the United States. The purpose of this review is to describe the effectiveness of lipid-lowering therapy in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, which has recently been extended to patients with mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia, and the cost of providing therapy, which would be prohibitive if all persons with hypercholesterolemia received treatment. Cost-effectiveness analysis provides a rational means of allocating limited health care resources by allowing the comparison of the costs of lipid-lowering therapy, in particular, therapy with beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl-CoA (coenzyme A) reductase inhibitors (statins), with the costs of atherosclerosis that could be prevented by lowering cholesterol. To extend the benefits of treatment to the large number of persons not receiving therapy, we need to implement more cost-effective treatment by improving risk assessment, increasing treatment effectiveness, and reducing the cost of therapy.", 
    "54": "A combination of electrophysiological, pathological, and biochemical studies were performed in myopathy induced by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors. Simvastatin (a lipophilic inhibitor) or pravastatin (a hydrophilic inhibitor) were administered by gavage to rabbits. In Group I (simvastatin-treated group, 50 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks), four rabbits showed muscle necrosis and high serum creatine kinase (CK) levels, and all six rabbits showed electrical myotonia. In Group II (pravastatin-treated group, 100 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks), no rabbit showed either condition. In Group III (pravastatin-treated group, 200 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks plus 300 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks), one rabbit showed muscle necrosis and high serum CK level and two rabbits showed electrical myotonia. The pathological findings were muscle fiber necrosis and degeneration with increased acid phosphatase activity by light microscopy, autophagic vacuoles and mitochondrial swelling, and disruption and hypercontraction of myofibrils by electron microscopy. Ubiquinone content decreased in skeletal muscle by 22 to 36% in Group I, by 18 to 52% in Group II, and by 49 to 72% in Group III. However, mitochondrial enzyme activities of respiratory chain were normal in all groups. These results indicate that myopathy was not induced by a secondary dysfunction of mitochondrial respiration due to low ubiquinone levels.", 
    "55": "INSUFFICIENT PROGRESS: The treatment of hyperlipidemia leads to a reduced risk of coronary disease. This has been displayed notably since clinical trials have used statins. However, despite these treatments, a risk of coronary ischemia remains, which is not insignificant. There are several causes of this persistent risk which need to be analyzed. THE QUALITATIVE ASPECT OF LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEINS: LDL are heterogeneous. This is displayed by a distribution of sizes varying from one subject to another. The predominance of small LDL is frequently found in coronary subjects detected during prospective or retrospective studies. The atherogenicity of small LDL can be explained by their physico-chemical characteristics. A remarkable fact is the predominance of small LDL in subjects with a mixed hyperlipidemia presenting a high risk of atherosclerosis. THE EFFECTS OF HYPOLIPIDEMIANTS: Statins greatly decrease LDL-cholesterol without changing LDL distribution according to size. Conversely, fibrates noticeably modify LDL distribution, reducing the percentage of small LDL. A PROPOSAL FOR THE TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS SUFFERING FROM MIXED HYPERLIPIDEMIA: If the concentration of LDL (reflected by LDL-cholesterol) and LDL distribution are two risk factors of atherosclerosis, hypolipidemic treatment should aim to act upon these two parameters, but no commercialized hypolipidemiant is effective enough as fas as they are both concerned. Therefore the combination of two hypolipidemiants, a statin and a fibrate, each having a predominant effect on one of the two factors, could be particularly effective in reducing coronary risk. This therapeutic association is effective on classic lipid parameters, does not entail more side effects than a monotherapy, and is not precluded by the RMO when there is a high vascular risk, which is often the case in mixed hyperlipidemia.", 
    "56": "The IST, CAPRIE and ESPS-2 have shown that large collaborative randomised trials can be conducted in stroke medicine and can provide statistically and clinically significant results. They, and other concurrent studies, have highlighted the potential hazards of early anticoagulation, and the effectiveness and safety of early (and continuous) antiplatelet therapy in limiting early stroke recurrence and its consequences. In addition, they have shown that antiplatelet agents with differing mechanisms of action can have different effects, and perhaps additive effects when combined. The ESPRIT trial should delineate the roles of oral anticoagulant therapy, and the combination of aspirin and dipyridamole, in the prevention of stroke due to arterial disease. Future trials will hopefully determine the role in secondary stroke prevention of inhibitors of the platelet GPIIb/IIIa complex (the final common pathway of platelet aggregation), the combination of anitplatelet agents with different mechanisms of action (e.g. aspirin and clopidogrel, aspirin and IIb/IIIa inhibitors), the combination of antiplatelet agents and oral anticoagulants (which may simultaneously modify platelet function and fibrin production), and the combination of antithrombotic and cholesterol-lowering (statin) medications.", 
    "57": "Little doubt remains about the value of lipid-lowering therapy since publication of the results of large, randomized, controlled trials that show decreased total, as well as coronary, mortality with the use of statins for primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease. All of the available statins are effective and safe, but they vary greatly in terms of cost-effectiveness. Fluvastatin has been determined to be a cost-effective therapeutic agent in the large proportion of the population with mild-to-moderate dyslipidemia who fit treatment guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP). Atorvastatin and simvastatin are cost-effective for the relatively smaller number of patients who require greater reductions in cholesterol.", 
    "58": "Studies of lipid-modifying therapy show that inhibition of cholesterol synthesis is required in at least 2 sites-in hepatic cells and in cells located in the walls of coronary arteries-if the progression of coronary atherosclerosis is to be decreased in patients with relatively normal levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. This is clinically important, because the majority of patients with coronary artery disease do not have severely elevated LDL cholesterol levels. Of the 2 angiographic trials of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors (\"statins\") in patients with coronary artery disease and average cholesterol levels, only the Lipoprotein and Atherosclerosis Study (LCAS) of fluvastatin reported slowed angiographic progression of coronary artery disease in these patients. The change in LDL cholesterol levels during treatment with fluvastatin did not predict the extent of change in coronary atherosclerosis or incidence of clinical cardiac events. Apparently, the metabolic effects of treatment with fluvastatin were more important than the extent to which blood cholesterol levels were lowered. The clinical benefits of treatment with statins should be directly compared in randomized controlled clinical trials among patients with average cholesterol levels.", 
    "59": "The exact mechanisms of action of antiresorptive bisphosphonate drugs remain unclear, although they may inhibit bone resorption by mechanisms that can lead to osteoclast apoptosis. These drugs also cause apoptosis in J774 macrophages, probably as a consequence of inhibition of protein prenylation. However, the molecular pathways that lead to apoptosis are not known. In some cells, apoptosis induced by statins (other inhibitors of protein prenylation) is dependent on protein synthesis. The aim of this study was to further characterize the kinetics and biochemical features of bisphosphonate-induced apoptosis, including the dependence on protein synthesis. Alendronate-induced apoptosis in J774 cells occurred after approximately 16 hr of treatment, although shorter exposures to the drug followed by incubation in bisphosphonate-free medium also committed cells to apoptosis. The appearance of apoptotic cells was associated with the appearance of caspase-3-like activity. Apoptosis induced by bisphosphonate or mevastatin was found to be dependent on protein synthesis because cycloheximide inhibited chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation and activation of caspase-3-like protease or proteases. Protein synthesis was required for events that lead to commitment to apoptosis but not for the execution phase because cycloheximide did not prevent apoptosis when added >/=15 hr after the start of alendronate treatment. Furthermore, staurosporine-induced caspase-3-like activity and apoptosis in J774 cells could not be prevented by cycloheximide. These observations demonstrate that activation of caspase-3-like proteases and inhibition of commitment to apoptosis by cycloheximide are common features of apoptotic cell death induced by inhibitors of protein prenylation such as bisphosphonates.", 
    "60": "Both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors have been shown to decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Results from clinical trials have suggested that HMG-CoA reductase inhibition might exert a beneficial effect independent of its lipid-lowering effect, and ACE inhibition may exert a benefit independent of blood-pressure lowering. To test the hypothesis that such an effect might be mediated by alteration in platelet reactivity, we studied 55 monkeys receiving both, 1, or neither of the ACE inhibitor fosinopril and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor pravastatin. Platelet responsiveness to collagen and to the thrombin receptor agonist (TRA) SFLRRN-NH2 was determined by aggregometry. For each agonist, the maximum rate and extent of aggregation were measured for each dose, and the concentration required for half-maximal response (C50) was determined. Each drug, when given alone, slightly decreased the dose of agonist required to produce 50% response in the rate and extent of platelet aggregation relative to control. The combination of the 2 drugs, however, produced a significant increase in the dose of TRA required to produce 50% response in the rate and extent of aggregation relative to either drug alone or the control group. This was not true for collagen. The magnitude of the change relative to the control group, 47% for rate and 30% for extent of aggregation, could confer considerable protection by changing the threshold for thrombin-induced platelet aggregation and, thus, decrease thrombosis.", 
    "61": "In vivo inhibition of 2,3-oxidosqualene:lanosterol cyclase (OSC, E.C. 5.4.99.7)--the enzyme which catalyzes the cyclization of monooxidosqualene to lanosterol--does not result in elevated 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGR) activity. This trait is attributed to increased levels of oxysterols, produced upon partial inhibition of OSC, that suppress HMGR and other sterol-responsive genes. The OSC inhibitor [4'-(6-allyl-ethyl-amino-hexyloxy)-2'-fluoro-phenyl]-(4-bromopheny l)-methanone (Ro 48-8071) was shown earlier to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in hamsters with no increase in hepatic HMGR, in contrast to simvastatin. To delineate the regulatory mechanism(s) by which Ro 48-8071 reduces cholesterol synthesis without raising HMGR levels, Syrian hamster C100 cells were incubated with either Ro 48-8071 or simvastatin, and their effects on cholesterol synthesis and LDL uptake, as well as on HMGR mRNA levels and rates of synthesis, were determined. Using RNase protection and radioimmunoprecipitation assays, we found that, in the absence of LDL in the culture medium, both HMGR mRNA levels and synthesis were reduced with concentrations of Ro 48-8071 inhibiting cholesterol synthesis by 50-75%, whereas LDL uptake was either reduced or unchanged. In contrast, simvastatin, at concentrations inhibiting cholesterol synthesis by the same 50-75%, increased both HMGR mRNA levels and synthesis, as well as LDL uptake. In the presence of LDL, HMGR mRNA levels and synthesis along with LDL uptake were little affected after incubation with Ro 48-8071. Still, simvastatin markedly increased both HMGR mRNA levels and synthesis in cells incubated in the presence of LDL, leaving LDL uptake unaffected. These data suggest that inhibition of OSC by Ro 48-8071 results in an indirect down-regulation of HMGR mRNA levels and synthesis.", 
    "62": "Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of healthy elderly people show increased plasma membrane viscosity compared to young subjects, that inversely correlates with lymphocyte proliferation after mitogen stimulation in vitro. Maintenance of a constant membrane viscosity, which is necessary for proper cell function, is crucially dependent on the membrane lipid composition. The cellular lipid metabolism, and thus lymphocyte function, may be subject to modulation by diet or drugs. To study the susceptibility of membrane viscosity to environmental conditions, we established an in vivo model using severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice: human peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy young and old subjects were engrafted for three days intraperitoneally into SCID mice to offer identical environmental conditions. First, we demonstrate that human lymphocytes can take up and utilize murine lipoproteins: engrafted human PBL can participate in the mouse lipid metabolism, and an exchange of membrane lipids in vivo is, therefore, possible. Second, plasma membrane viscosity was determined before and after engraftment: before engraftment, PBL from the elderly showed a significantly higher membrane viscosity than that from young controls, but this difference vanished during engraftment into SCID mice, wherein cells from both age groups exhibited nearly identical values. It was, therefore, concluded that lymphocyte membrane viscosity is influenced by environmental factors, and that the age-related increase is, in principle, reversible.", 
    "63": "Plasma membrane sphingomyelin (SM) is known to affect the cellular distribution of cholesterol. The aim of this work was to examine how SM homoeostasis in human skin fibroblasts is affected by alterations in the level of cholesterol in the cell. The cellular cholesterol level was decreased by exposing cells to 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin, and increased by exposing cells to cholesterol-methyl-beta-cyclodextrin inclusion complexes. A lowering of the cellular unesterified cholesterol content by 20% was shown to increase the incorporation of [14C]palmitic acid into SM by 70%. Subsequently, the cellular SM mass was shown to be increased (24% increase after a 24 h period). Since l-cycloserine completely abolished the increased incorporation of [14C]palmitic acid into SM in cholesterol-depleted cells, we concluded that the de novo synthesis of the sphingosine backbone of SM was activated in cholesterol-depleted cells. This conclusion was further verified by performing a cell-free assay of serine C-palmitoyltransferase (SPT) in cholesterol-depleted cells, which showed that the activity of the enzyme was increased by 30% after cholesterol depletion. Most of the newly synthesized SM in cholesterol-depleted cells was susceptible to degradation by sphingomyelinase, indicating that it was transported efficiently to the cell surface. Loading of fibroblasts with cholesterol had essentially the opposite effects on SM homoeostasis to those of cholesterol depletion, i.e. 20-30% decreased incorporation of [14C]palmitic acid into SM and decreased activity of SPT. The results of this study show that cellular cholesterol levels have marked effects on the homoeostasis of SM.", 
    "64": "We have developed an enzyme immunoassay for mevalonic acid (MVA), using a specific monoclonal antibody. The intra- and interassay coefficients of variation calculated on two urine samples were 3.3% and 3.4%, respectively, in the intraassay precision test and 3.5% and 6.9% in the interassay evaluation. Pravastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, was administered to nine healthy men, and in all cases, their MVA excretion rates then decreased. The more MVA that was excreted in the urine before the pravastatin administration, the greater a reduction of MVA excretion was observed. The daily MVA excretions in healthy men (n = 120) and women (n = 105) were 2.32 micromol/day (SD, 0.82 micromol/day) and 1.85 micromol/day (SD, 0.47 micromol/day), respectively. In streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (n = 14), the plasma cholesterol concentrations and MVA excretion rates were increased, and a positive correlation was observed between the plasma cholesterol and the urinary MVA concentrations.", 
    "65": "We performed a multicenter, open-label study to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of a new extended-release once-a-night niacin preparation, Niaspan, in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Niaspan, 0.5 to 3.0 g once a night at bedtime, was used alone or in combination with a statin (inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase), a bile acid sequestrant, or both. Patients included 269 hypercholesterolemic male and female adults enrolled in a 96-week study, and 230 additional adults for whom short-term safety data were available. The dosages of Niaspan attained by 269 patients were 1,000 mg (95% of patients), 1,500 mg (86%), and 2,000 mg (65%). After 48 weeks of treatment, Niaspan alone (median dose 2,000 mg) reduced low-density lipaprotein (LDL) cholesterol (18%), apolipoprotein B (15%), total cholesterol (11%), triglycerides (24%), and lipoprotein(a) (36%), and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (29%). Niaspan plus a statin lowered LDL cholesterol (32%), apolipoprotein B (26%), total cholesterol (23%), triglycerides (30%), and lipoprotein(a) (19%), and increased HDL cholesterol (26%). Reversible elevations of aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase more than twice the normal range occurred in 2.6% of patients. One patient discontinued Niaspan because of transaminase elevations. Intolerance to flushing, leading to discontinuation of Niaspan, occurred in 4.8% of patients. The overall rate of discontinuance due to flushing in this study combined with 2 previous randomized trials was 7.3%. In the long-term treatment of hypercholesterolemia, Niaspan produced favorable changes in LDL and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and lipoprotein(a). Adverse hepatic effects were minor and occurred at rates similar to those reported for statin therapy.", 
    "66": "Reference pricing has recently been introduced into New Zealand in an attempt to curb rising pharmaceutical costs. Although budget savings may be significant, the resulting alteration of established drug prescriptions has the potential to cause harm.

    "67": "The fasting lipid profiles of 262 patients in a defined geographic region were obtained after at least six weeks of fluvastatin therapy. These were compared to mean lipid levels obtained from laboratory databases for the patients while previously receiving simvastatin.", 
    "68": "There was a significant increase in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels (p < 0.01). The elevation was less pronounced where higher incremental doses of fluvastatin were used, although still significant for LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol (p < 0.01). Those receiving maximal therapy with fluvastatin experienced similar elevations in lipid as did those on lower doses.", 
    "69": "The lipid elevations seen in this audit relate both to the lesser potency of fluvastatin and underdosing. In this high risk population, significant lipid elevations may conceivably produce an excess of vascular events. The responsibility to the taxpayer should be weighed carefully against the ethical responsibility to the individual patient and the potential to do harm. Subtherapeutic treatment may prove more costly than all the savings from reference pricing.", 
    "70": "Butyrolactone I [alpha-oxo-beta-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-gamma-(p-hydroxy-m-3, 3-dimethylallyl-benzyl)-gamma-methoxycarbonyl-gamma-butyrolactone] is produced as a secondary metabolite by Aspergillus terreus. Because small butyrolactone-containing molecules act as self-regulating factors in some bacteria, the effects of butyrolactone I on the producing organism were studied; specifically, changes in morphology, sporulation, and secondary metabolism were studied. Threefold or greater increases in hyphal branching (with concomitant decreases in the average hyphal growth unit), submerged sporulation, and secondary metabolism were observed when butyrolactone I was added to cultures of A. terreus. Among the secondary metabolites whose production was increased by this treatment was the therapeutically important compound lovastatin. These findings indicate that butyrolactone I induces morphological and sporulation changes in A. terreus and enhances secondary metabolite production in a manner similar to that previously reported for filamentous bacteria.", 
    "71": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors (HRIs) have been recently shown to prevent atherosclerosis progression. Clinical benefit results from combined actions on various components of the atherosclerotic lesion. This study was designed to identify the effects of HRI on one of these components, the endothelial fibrinolytic system. Aortas isolated from rats treated for 2 days with lovastatin (4 mg/kg body wt per day) showed a 3-fold increase in tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) activity. In a rat aortic endothelial cell line (SVARECs) and in human nontransformed endothelial cells (HUVECs), HRI induced an increase in tPA activity and antigen in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. In SVARECs, the maximal response was observed when cells were incubated for 48 hours with 50 micromol/L HRI. An increase of tPA mRNA was also in evidence. In contrast, HRI inhibited plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity and mRNA. The effects of HRI were reversed by mevalonate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, but not by LDL cholesterol and farnesyl pyrophosphate, and were not induced by alpha-hydroxyfarnesyl phosphonic acid, an inhibitor of protein farnesyl transferase. C3 exoenzyme, an inhibitor of the geranylgeranylated-activated Rho protein, reproduced the effect of lovastatin on tPA and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity and blocked its reversal by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. The effect of HRI was associated with a disruption of cellular actin filaments without modification of microtubules. A disrupter of actin filaments, cytochalasin D, induced the same effect as lovastatin on tPA, whereas a disrupter of microtubules, nocodazole, did not. In conclusion, HRI can modify the fibrinolytic potential of endothelial cells, likely via inhibition of geranylgeranylated Rho protein and disruption of the actin filaments. The resulting increase of fibrinolytic activity of endothelial cells may contribute to the beneficial effects of HRI in the progression of atherosclerosis.", 
    "72": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are potent cholesterol-lowering drugs. Recent clinical trials and meta-analyses show a 30% stroke reduction after treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Subgroup analyses and experimental findings support the notion that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors improve endothelial function directly by mechanism(s) independent of cholesterol-lowering. They reduce inflammatory, proliferative and thrombogenic processes in atherosclerotic plaques and improve endothelial dysfunction. Recent findings demonstrate an enhanced production of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Endothelial NO is an important vasodilator and plays a beneficial role in cerebral ischemic injury. Prophylactic treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in mice selectively upregulates endothelial NO synthase expression and activity, increases cerebral blood flow at resting state and during ischemia, and reduces cerebral infarct size after experimental stroke. These findings provide a novel mechanism for the prophylactic treatment of ischemia-induced cerebral injury under non-hypercholesterolemic conditions.", 
    "73": "Those people who are to decide about health care systems are increasingly forced to identify unnecessary costs and achieve savings in health care. Especially for diseases with high prevalence like illnesses of the heart and the circulatory system preventive measures are very important. This economic analysis tries to clarify whether the secondary-preventive application of the HMG-CoA reductase-inhibitor pravastatin is, apart from the clinical benefit, economically justified in patients suffering from coronary heart disease with average cholesterol levels. In the case of this study, the underlying type of economic evaluation was an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis. The outcome was defined as costs per life-year saved. This retrospective study is based on the results of the CARE (Cholesterol And Recurrent Events) study which has been published elsewhere [21]. When calculating costs we took into account the perspective of 3rd party payers (public health insurance) in Germany. The calculation of cost-effectiveness was carried out for the whole study population in CARE as well as for all patients aged 60 or more years in the CARE study. This was done because the different groups vary by the numbers of avoided myocardial infarctions, strokes and loss of life years. Netcosts for pravastatin therapy, i.e. drug costs for pravastatin minus costs for avoided events, were about 9.54 Mio DM (referring to 1,000 patients treated for a period of 5 years). Net-costs for patients aged 60 or more years were 8.18 Mio DM. The effectiveness was defined as the number of life years saved and amounted to 216 years of life saved (YOLS) in the overall study group. For patients aged 60 or more years we found that 358 years were saved. The costs per life years saved (i.e. the net-costs of pravastatin therapy divided through the number of life years saved) turned out to be 44,000 DM per person in the study group. For patients over 60 the costs were 23,000 DM. Lipid-lowering with pravastatin in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease in Germany is cost-effective.

Serum stimulation of rat astrocytes in primary culture induces the expression of cyclin E followed by the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) during G1/S transition. The expression of p27, cyclin D1, and the activities of Cdk4 and Cdk-activating kinase (CAK), composed of Cdk7 and cyclin H, were not affected. Serum did, however, stimulate the expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase mRNA at mid-G1 phase. Moreover, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, pravastatin, reduced cyclin E expression and Cdk2 activation and caused G1 arrest in the astrocytes. In contrast, mevalonate and its metabolite, geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) but not farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP), reversed the inhibitory effects of pravastatin on cyclin E expression and Cdk2 activation and allowed G1/S transition. Rho small GTPase(s) were geranylgeranylated and translocated to membranes in the presence of GGPP during G1/S transition. The effect of GGPP on cyclin E expression was abolished by botulinum C3 exoenzyme, which specifically inactivates Rho. These data indicate that geranylgeranylated Rho small GTPase(s) are essential for the induction of cyclin E expression, Cdk2 activation, and G1/S transition in rat astrocytes.", 
    "75": "Atherosclerotic vessels are characterized by endothelial and structural abnormalities as indicated by an impaired vasodilation to metabolic requirements. To determine whether effective treatment of hypercholesterolemia may improve vasodilatory capacity of resistance vessels, the authors examined the impact of 12 and 24 weeks of lipid-lowering therapy with the hepatic hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA)-reductase inhibitor fluvastatin (40 to 80 mg/day) on the increment in forearm blood flow during reactive hyperemia in 24 hypercholesterolemic patients (mean age: 56 +/- 11 years; 15 men/9 women). Changes in forearm blood flow in response to reactive hyperemia were measured by venous occlusion plethysmography. Serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol fell from 213 +/- 32 to 125 +/- 27 mg/dL (P<0.001) after 12 weeks and remained stable at a level of 125 +/- 18 mg/dL after 24 weeks of treatment. Baseline forearm blood flow was similar before and after 12 and 24 weeks of therapy. In contrast, forearm blood flow at peak reactive hyperemia was greater at week 12 (37.0 +/- 22.9 mL/min/100 mL; P<0.05), and at week 24 (47.1 +/- 33.5 mL/min/100 mL; P<0.05) than at week 0 (30.5 +/- 18.1 mL/min/100 mL). Compared with week 0 (defined as 100%), the percent change in forearm blood flow in response to reactive hyperemia was augmented at week 12 (171 +/- 144%; P<0.05 vs week 0) and at week 24 (218 +/- 228%; P<0.05 vs week 0). Thus, the lowering of high serum LDL cholesterol after short-term treatment with fluvastatin increased the blood flow responses during reactive hyperemia in forearm resistance vessels. These data indicate a beneficial effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition on structural wall properties of peripheral arteries in human atherosclerosis.",

Administration of statins is complicated in patients after transplantation by concurrent imunosuppressive treatment, in particular by possible undesirable interaction with cyclosporin. In the presented study 15 patients after transplantation of the heart with hyperlipoproteinaemia were examined who were on a standard triple combination of immunosuppressive drugs. Fluvastatin was administered, 20 mg in the evening, and in intervals of 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after the onset of treatment the levels of cholesterol, LDL and HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, urea, creatinine, liver terts and cyclosporine were followed up. The mean cholesterol level declined from 7.66 mmol/l during the 6rd week (p < 0.002), to 6.01 mmol/l during 3rd month and to 5.83 mol/l after the 6rd month (p < 0.001), LDL-cholesterol declined from 4.82 mmol/l and then 3.46 mmol/l and 3.31 mmol/l (p < 0.001).

Several large trials published during recent years have clearly shown treatment with statins to reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality rates, the beneficial effects being manifest sooner than expected. Despite the smallness of changes in lumen diameter during statin treatment, as measured with coronary angiography, the decrease in clinical events has been impressive. The question has therefore arisen of whether statins have other beneficial effects in addition to their lipid-lowering property. Several studies have been made of the effects of statin treatment on such variables as endothelial function, cellular immunity, lipoprotein oxidation, rheological factors, and the stabilisation of atherosclerotic plaque. Although the various statins differ in structure, there is a lack of comparative studies. However, available data suggest the beneficial effects of statins on other variables to be probably dependent on their primary lipid-lowering property.",

    "93": "Cerivastatin is a third generation pure enantiomeric HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. It reduces low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol by 22 to 44% at doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg/day. The drug has been extensively evaluated for more than 5 years in clinical trials and is currently marketed in a number of countries at doses of 0.1 to 0.3 mg/day. Cerivastatin has been tested in more than 4000 patients during extensive phase II and III studies. About 40% of patients in these trials were women, and many participants were aged between 65 and 75 years. The trial populations had moderate to severe hypercholesterolaemia, with mean baseline LDL-cholesterol levels of approximately 5.2 mmol/L (200 mg/dl). In large phase III trials, cerivastatin, over the dosage range of 0.1 to 0.4 mg/day, reduced LDL-cholesterol by 22.4 to 36.1% from baseline. As with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, the log-linear dose-response curve of cerivastatin showed a 6% additional decrease in mean LDL-cholesterol levels for each doubling of the daily dose, with no plateau effect noted at the highest dosage yet tested (0.8 mg/day). High density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased by 4 to 10% during cerivastatin therapy. This effect, which was consistent with that of other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, was not dose related. As has been found with other statins, the triglyceride-lowering effects of cerivastatin are dependent on baseline triglyceride levels, with very small reductions occurring in patients with low initial levels [< 1.7 mmol/L (150 mg/dl)], and larger dose-dependent reductions of up to 36% with the 0.4 mg/day dose observed in patients with baseline triglyceride levels >2.8 mmol/L (250 mg/dl). Cerivastatin was well tolerated in all studies. Cerivastatin recipients and recipients of other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors experienced a similar incidence of adverse events (including hepatic transaminase elevations) in comparative studies. Cerivastatin is an effective and safe lipid-lowering agent for most patients with hypercholesterolaemia.", 
    "94": "Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions influence drug efficacy, tolerability, and compliance. Such interactions are both more common and of more clinical relevance than often appreciated. The US Food and Drug Administration and the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products have recently issued guidelines setting out in vitro and in vivo investigations to be conducted during drug development. These guidelines reflect the increasing interest of public health authorities in this topic. Cerivastatin is a novel, potent HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor that effectively reduces serum cholesterol levels at low daily doses. It is completely absorbed after oral administration, undergoes moderate first-pass metabolism and high plasma protein binding, and is cleared exclusively via hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP). Unlike other drugs of its class, cerivastatin has a dual metabolic pathway, with the involvement of more than one CYP isozyme. Metabolites are cleared via both biliary and renal excretion. On the basis of this pharmacokinetic profile and a knowledge of the target population, the formal in vivo interaction programme for cerivastatin investigated many important potential cerivastatin drug-drug interactions. Cerivastatin appears to lack clinically relevant interactions with digoxin, warfarin, antacid, cimetidine, nifedipine, omeprazole, erythromycin and itraconazole.",

In this study, the components contributing to IMT measurement variability in males with coronary artery disease were investigated by means of repeated B-mode ultrasound scans and repeated off-line video image analyses. For statistical analysis, a mixed-model analysis of variance was used. From sonographer data, it was shown that human subjects and their arterial wall segments contributed 75% of the total IMT measurement variability in this population. Inter-sonographer variance contributed 25%. The intra-sonographer variance was negligible (<1%). In off-line image analysis, variance components due to subjects and segments, inter-analyst variance, and residual fluctuation were 88%, < 1% and 11%, respectively. Intra-analyst variance was negligible (<1%). The major source of B-mode ultrasound IMT measurement variability finds its origin in subjects and their arterial walls. Although sonographers proved a lesser source of variability, in comparative studies they should enter a study well trained and should be randomly assigned to subjects. Follow-up examinations should preferably be done by the same sonographer. Off-line image analysis contributed little to IMT measurement variability.",

This report reviews the pivotal Phase IIb/III clinical trials in which the efficacy and safety of cerivastatin was compared with placebo and active comparator statins (lovastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin) after both short- and long-term administration. Overall, the studies showed that at doses of 0.025-0.4 mg/day, cerivastatin produced dose-dependent reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and total cholesterol, which were significantly greater than placebo. The greatest reductions were achieved with 0.4 mg/day cerivastatin. On this dose, >40% of patients achieved reductions in LDL cholesterol >40% and in a further 9% of patients, LDL cholesterol was decreased by >50%. At higher doses, cerivastatin also demonstrated potent triglyceride-lowering effects in a subgroup of patients with raised plasma triglycerides. Reductions in atherogenic lipids and lipoproteins were accompanied by significant increases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-I, and antiatherogenic lipoprotein A-I. Long-term administration of cerivastatin for periods of up to 2 years was associated with persistent reductions in LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B as well as increases in HDL cholesterol similar to those observed after initial administration. Long-term cerivastatin treatment was also well tolerated. There was no significant difference between the incidence of adverse effects with cerivastatin and comparator statins or between cerivastatin and other statins with respect to clinically significant increases in either hepatic enzymes or creatine phosphokinase. In conclusion, these studies indicate that cerivastatin is a safe and effective long-term treatment for patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and also suggest that higher doses should be investigated.", 
    "100": "Patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia are at especially high risk of premature coronary artery disease and usually require aggressive long-term lipid-lowering drug therapy to decrease plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations to normal levels. In the present study, the lipid-lowering effects of cerivastatin in combination with cholestyramine and probucol were investigated in 20 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia over a 20-week treatment period. After an initial 4-week treatment with once-daily 0.2 mg cerivastatin, serum total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels had decreased by a significant 22% and 25%, respectively (p <0.01). The addition of 8 g/day cholestyramine or 1 g/day probucol to ongoing cerivastatin therapy produced further significant reductions in total cholesterol of 16% and 16%, respectively, and in LDL cholesterol of 22% and 15%, respectively (p <0.01), over the 12-week combination therapy period. The potent lipid-lowering effects of combined treatment were accompanied by excellent toleration of study drugs. Only 2 patients experienced gastrointestinal side effects associated with cholestyramine therapy. There was no evidence of any abnormalities in creatine phosphokinase in either treatment group and only 2 patients exhibited minor increases in hepatic transaminases. This study has shown that cerivastatin can be safely combined with either cholesytramine or probucol to provide a safe and highly effective hypolipidemic treatment regimen for patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.",

Randomization to the first 16 weeks of treatment followed an initial 4-week washout period and subsequent 6-week diet-controlled, placebo run-in phase. Patients continued to receive study medication for a further 36 weeks, with those previously on placebo switched to 0.1 mg/day cerivastatin at the end of week 16. Additional cholestyramine therapy was permitted at week 36 in patients with uncontrolled low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Cerivastatin achieved significant dose-dependent reductions in LDL cholesterol of 15-24% after 16 weeks of treatment, compared with reductions of 7.5% with gemfibrozil. Over this period both cerivastatin (0.3 mg) and gemfibrozil (1,200 mg) significantly decreased levels of triglycerides (20.3% vs 50.3%, respectively) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol (30.8% vs 47.1%, respectively), as well as increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (11.3% vs 13.3%, respectively). The reductions in LDL cholesterol and other atherogenic lipids and lipoproteins at 16 weeks were sustained in the subsequent 36-week double-blind continuation phase, during which time <10% of patients received additional cholestyramine therapy. Both study drugs were well tolerated, with the incidence of adverse events similar to that of placebo treatment. Clinically significant increases in hepatic transaminases and creatine phosphokinase occurred at a similar low frequency of around 1%. This study demonstrated that cerivastatin is a safe, well-tolerated, and effective treatment for lowering elevated LDL cholesterol and triglycerides in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia.",

A global, pooled analysis of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of cerivastatin was performed on data obtained from all randomized, double-blind studies in which cerivastatin at doses of 0.025-0.4 mg/day was compared with either placebo or active comparator. All studies had a 10-week, diet-controlled run-in period, the last 6 weeks of which included administration of single-blind placebo. Efficacy analysis of the pooled data at 8 weeks postrandomization showed that in comparison with placebo, cerivastatin achieved significant dose-dependent reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, the primary efficacy parameter, of 14.2-36.1 %. Reductions in LDL cholesterol were accompanied by significant reductions in total cholesterol and triglycerides, together with increases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The magnitude of the reduction in plasma triglycerides was strongly related to baseline triglyceride levels. In patients with baseline plasma triglycerides of >250 mg/dL, treatment with 0.4 mg/day cerivastatin decreased these levels by 37%. Cerivastatin was well tolerated, with the type and incidence of clinical adverse effects comparable to that of placebo and comparator drugs. The incidence of biochemical adverse effects was also similar to that seen with either placebo or comparator drugs and was independent of the dose of cerivastatin. Less than 1% of patients treated with cerivastatin at doses of 0.025-0.4 mg/day experienced clinically significant increases in either hepatic transaminases (>3x the upper limit of normal) or creatine phosphokinase (>5x the upper limit of normal). The good tolerability of cerivastatin was reflected in a low rate of premature withdrawal from treatment, below or comparable to that of placebo-treatment. The pooled efficacy and safety analyses have shown that at doses equal to 1-3% of the doses of other statins, cerivastatin is a safe, well-tolerated, and highly effective HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor for the treatment of type IIa (triglycerides <250 mg/dL) and IIb (triglycerides >250 mg/dL) hypercholesterolemia.",

Both dose-ranging studies included a 10-week dietary run-in, to which placebo was added in the last 6 weeks, before patients (n = 385) were randomized to 1 of 6 4-week treatment groups: cerivastatin (0.025, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/day), 40 mg/day lovastatin (US), 20 mg/day simvastatin (Europe), or placebo. The dose-scheduling study also included a 10-week dietary run-in and 6-week single-blind placebo run-in phase, before patients (n = 319) were randomized to 4 weeks of treatment with either 0.1 mg cerivastatin twice daily, 0.2 mg cerivastatin with the evening meal, 0.2 mg cerivastatin at bedtime, or placebo in a 2:2:2:1 ratio. The 4-week dose-ranging studies showed that all 4 doses of cerivastatin produced significantly greater reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol than placebo. Cerivastatin 0.2 mg decreased LDL cholesterol by 30.5%. Cerivastatin also significantly decreased total cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B, and significantly increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Similar reductions in LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol occurred with 0.2 mg/day cerivastatin in the dose-scheduling study, although the reductions were significantly greater when cerivastatin was administered once daily with either the evening meal or at bedtime compared with 2 divided doses. LDL cholesterol reductions were similar when cerivastatin was taken with the evening meal and at bedtime. Cerivastatin was well tolerated, with the incidence of adverse events comparable to that of placebo treatment.

    "104": "Cerivastatin, a new, entirely synthetic, and enantiomerically pure 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, is pharmacologically potent and hepatically selective, with an uncomplicated pharmacokinetic profile. In vitro and acute in vivo studies in animals demonstrated that cerivastatin is markedly more pharmacologically potent than other statins. In rats and dogs, cerivastatin inhibited hepatic cholesterol synthesis at concentrations 100-150 times lower than lovastatin. Cerivastatin's potent inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase (the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis) is confirmed by its cholesterol-lowering properties, combined with significant triglyceride-decreasing effects, and dose-dependent increases in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor binding in the liver. The antiatherogenic effects of cerivastatin extend beyond serum lipid and lipoprotein reductions to potent inhibition of migration of smooth muscle cells in vitro and reductions in the accumulation of cholesterol ester in the arterial tissue of rabbits. The high pharmacologic potency of cerivastatin, coupled with high liver selectivity, enable cerivastatin to be administered at 1-5% of the dose of currently available HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. At ultra-low doses in the range 0.01-0.8 mg/day, cerivastatin proved to be both safe and well tolerated when administered to healthy volunteers in a series of ascending single- and multiple-dose studies. Cerivastatin has an uncomplicated pharmacokinetic profile; it can be administered to both young and elderly patients, male and female, without the need for dosage adjustments. Because no clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions occur with cerivastatin, it may be the preferred HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor for patients on multiple-drug therapy including warfarin and digoxin.",

It effectively decreases low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol at 1% of the doses of other currently available statins. The toxicology of cerivastatin was evaluated in a comprehensive program of studies including: (1) single- and multiple-dose toxicity studies in rats, mice, minipigs, dogs, and monkeys; (2) reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits; (3) in vitro and in vivo mutagenicity assays in rats and mice; and (4) carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice. In addition, studies were undertaken to investigate the effects of cerivastatin on lens opacity, testicular tissue, and hemorrhage in dogs. Oral administration of single and multiple doses of cerivastatin over periods ranging from 4 weeks to 24 months was generally well tolerated. Adverse effects were similar to those observed with other statins and primarily involved the liver and muscle tissue. At the high doses used in the toxicologic studies, cerivastatin caused elevations in serum transaminases and creatine phosphokinase levels as well as some degeneration of muscle fibers in rats, mice, dogs, and minipigs. In dogs, the species most sensitive to statins, cerivastatin caused erosions and hemorrhages in the gastrointestinal tract, bleeding in the brain stem with fibroid degeneration of vessel walls in the choroid plexus, and lens opacity. Apart from minor morphologic changes in the testicular tissue of dogs--the only organ for which a comparably low margin of safety was observed--cerivastatin had no significant effects on the male or female reproductive system. Cerivastatin also caused no primary embryotoxic or teratogenic effects. With the exception of cerivastatin-induced effects on the eyes and testicles, administration of mevalonic acid reversed the toxicologic effects of cerivastatin, indicating that the toxic effects were related to its mode of action and not to any intrinsic toxicity of the molecule itself. There was no evidence that cerivastatin had any mutagenic effects and, in contrast to other statins, high doses of cerivastatin did not induce tumors in rats. The main metabolite of cerivastatin was well tolerated systemically in all animals, including dogs. Overall, cerivastatin has a similar toxicologic profile to other statins and is a well-tolerated HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor.", 
    "106": "Hyperlipidemia is recognized as one of the major risk factors for the development of coronary artery disease and progression of atherosclerotic lesions. Dietary therapy together with hypolipidemic drugs are central to the management of hyperlipidemia, which aims to prevent atherosclerotic plaque progression, induce regression, and so decrease the risk of acute coronary events in patients with pre-existing coronary or peripheral vascular disease. In patients at high risk of coronary artery disease but without evidence of atherosclerosis, treatment is designed to prevent the premature development of coronary artery disease, whereas in those with hypertriglyceridemia, treatment aims to prevent the development of hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and pancreatitis. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statins, are the most potent lipid-lowering agents currently available, and their use in the treatment of hyperlipidemia provides the focus for this review. Particular emphasis is given to cerivastatin, a new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor that combines potent cholesterol-lowering properties with significant triglyceride-reducing effects. Recently completed primary and secondary intervention trials have shown that the significant reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol achieved with statins result in significant reductions in morbidity and mortality associated with coronary artery disease as well as reductions in the incidence of stroke and total mortality. Such benefits occur early in the course of statin therapy and have led to suggestions that these drugs may possess antiatherogenic effects over and above their capacity to lower atherogenic lipids and lipoproteins. Experimental studies have also shown statin-induced improvements in endothelial function, decreased platelet thrombus formation, improvements in fibrinolytic activity, and reductions in the frequency of transient myocardial ischemia.", 
    "107": "The mechanisms by which oxylanosterols regulate expression of hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and lower serum cholesterol levels were examined by using a novel nonmetabolizable oxylanosterol mimic, 15-oxa-32-vinyl-lanost-8-ene-3 beta, 32 diol (DMP 565). This compound, unlike other nonmetabolizable oxylanosterols, is not a substrate for lanosterol 14 alpha-methyl demethylase. Feeding rats a diet supplemented with 0.02% DMP 565 markedly decreased HMG-CoA reductase immunoreactive protein and enzyme activity levels without affecting mRNA levels. The rate of reductase protein degradation was unaffected. However, the rate of translation was reduced to less than 20% of control. Thus, DMP 565 appears to regulate hepatic HMG-CoA reductase gene expression primarily at the level of translation. The pronounced inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by DMP 565 resulted in a compensatory increase in the functioning of the hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, possibly by increased cycling, as evidenced by a marked increase in the rate of degradation of the LDL receptor. The half-life of the receptor was decreased from over 7 h to only 1 h in animals receiving DMP 565. This increase in the rate of degradation occurred without a change in the steady state level of the receptor. Addition of dietary cholesterol attenuated the increased turnover of the LDL receptor. These effects on the hepatic LDL receptor have also been observed with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (G. C. Ness et al., 1996, Arch. Biochem, Biophys. 325, 242-248). However, the effect of DMP 565 on the rate of degradation of the hepatic LDL receptor was of a greater magnitude when equal doses of the drugs were used. These regulatory actions of DMP 565 provide, in part, an explanation for the observed hypocholesterolemic action of this compound.", 
    "108": "Recent evidence suggests that apoptosis may be involved in the control of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) number in atherosclerotic lesions. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors have been reported to induce apoptosis in a variety of tumor cell lines. To evaluate whether these agents also induce apoptosis of VSMCs, cultured rat VSMCs were treated with increasing doses of atorvastatin in the presence of FBS as a survival factor. The presence of apoptosis was evaluated by morphological criteria, annexin V binding, and DNA fragmentation and quantified as the proportion of hypodiploid cells by flow cytometry. Atorvastatin induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, an effect also seen with simvastatin and lovastatin, but not with the hydrophilic drug pravastatin. The proapoptotic effect of statins was seen only when the inhibition of acetate incorporation into sterols was >95% and was fully reversed by mevalonate, farnesyl pyrophosphate, and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate but not by isopentenyl adenosine, ubiquinone, or squalene, suggesting a role for prenylated proteins in the regulation of VSMC apoptosis. To further assess the role of protein prenylation, VSMCs were exposed to the prenyl transferase inhibitors perillic acid and manumycin A. Both agents induced VSMC apoptosis as evaluated by the above-mentioned criteria. Finally, VSMC treatment with lipophilic statins was associated with decreased prenylation of p21-Rho B, further supporting the role of protein prenylation inhibition in statin-induced VSMC apoptosis. The present data suggest that interference with protein prenylation by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors or other agents may provide new strategies for the prevention of neointimal thickening.", 
    "109": "Hypolipidemic drugs that are efficacious in man are not always active in classical animal models of dyslipidemia. Inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase (statins) do not lower plasma cholesterol in rats, but yet this species was alone in providing activity for fibrate-type drugs. Nicotinic acid possesses many desirable features with regard to clinical use, but most of these actions are lacking in rats and monkeys. The metabolism of low density lipoproteins in hamsters is widely thought to be similar to that in humans, yet neither statins or fibrates lower plasma lipids in these species. With the advent of mouse models expressing specific human genes (or disruption of genes) it is now possible to re-examine the effect of established drugs and to characterize new hypolipidemic compounds with respect to site and mechanism of action. Drug responses observed in humans are now being seen in such mouse models (e.g. HDL elevation with fenofibrate in mice with the human apo A-I gene). Moreover, mice are now being screened for compounds that lower plasma (human) Lp(a), or lower plasma cholesterol in the absence of LDL receptors. It is proposed that these new genetic mouse models may afford a more focused examination of drug action and provide, for new compounds, better prediction of the human response.", 
    "110": "A prospective study of 500 consecutive persons (aged 60 years with Q-wave myocardial infarction admitted to a long-term health care facility) investigated the prevalence of the use of a lipid-lowering drug at the time of admission in persons with a fasting serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol >125 mg/dl measured the day after admission. The prevalence of a lipid-lowering drug in persons with myocardial infarction and an LDL cholesterol >125 mg/dl was 7% (11 of 153 persons) in persons 60 to 80 years of age and 3% (6 of 182 persons) in persons 81 to 100 years of age."
