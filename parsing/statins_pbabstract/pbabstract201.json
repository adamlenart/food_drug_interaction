This can be attributed to the toxicity of bromide for biocatalysis. Recently, we isolated cDNA that encodes Penicillium citrinum beta-keto ester reductase (KER) and the gene that encodes Leifsonia sp. alcohol dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the reduction of methyl 4-bromo-3-oxobutyrate to methyl (S)-4-bromo-3-hydroxybutyrate with high optical purity and productivity and expressed them in Escherichia coli. Moreover, protein engineering was performed using error-prone PCR-based random mutagenesis to improve the thermostability and enantioselectivity of KER. This review focuses on the establishment of a novel biotechnological process for the production of (S)-4-bromo-3-hydroxybutyrate using E. coli transformants. This process is suitable for industrial production of (S)-4-bromo-3-hydroxybutyrate, an intermediate for statin compounds.", 
    "1": "Several studies have shown that baseline levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in apparently healthy men and women are predictive of future cardiovascular events. In primary prevention, hs-CRP levels could indicate which primary prevention patients are at higher risk and might benefit from preventive statin therapy. Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) aimed to determine whether treatment with rosuvastatin 20 mg/d would reduce the rate of first major cardiovascular events among apparently healthy individuals with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels below 130 mg/dL, but with hs-CRP levels of 2 mg/L or higher. At the time of study closure, it was found that treatment with rosuvastatin significantly reduced the primary composite endpoint by 44% as compared with placebo. Results of the JUPITER trial clearly suggest that patients with elevated hs-CRP stand to benefit from statin therapy, regardless of their LDL-C level.",

All patients were free of cancer at baseline. Biological interactions were estimated using relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI), attributable proportion due to interaction (AP), and synergy index (S). RERI > 0, AP > 0, or S > 1 indicates biological interaction.",

    "10": "We investigated the additive therapeutic effect of the combination treatment of stroke with sub-therapeutic doses of Simvastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, and bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Rats were administered Simvastatin (0.5 mg/kg), BMSCs (1x10(6)) or combination of Simvastatin and BMSCs starting at 24 h after stroke. Combination treatment significantly improved neurological outcome, enhanced angiogenesis and arteriogenesis, and increased the number of engrafted-BMSCs in the ischemic brain. The number of engrafted-BMSCs and arteriogenesis was significantly correlated with functional outcome. Simvastatin significantly increased stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF1) expression in the ischemic brain and chemokine (CXC motif) receptor-4 (CXCR4) in BMSCs, and increased BMSC migration to RBMECs and astrocytes. Combination treatment of stroke upregulates the SDF1/CXCR4 axis and enhances BMSC migration into the ischemic brain, amplifies arteriogenesis and angiogenesis, and improves functional outcome after stroke.", 
    "11": "While cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or ALS-like conditions have arisen in apparent association with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors ('statins') and/or other lipid-lowering drugs (collectively termed 'statins' in this paper for brevity), additional information is needed to understand whether the connection may be causal. The University of California, San Diego (UCSD) Statin Effects Study is a patient-targeted adverse event surveillance project focused on lipid-lowering agents, whose aim is to capitalize on patient reporting to further define characteristics and natural history of statin adverse effects (AEs), and to ascertain whether a patient-targeted surveillance system might lead to presumptive identification of previously unrecognized AEs. ALS was a candidate 'new' AE identified through this process. The aim of the analysis presented here was to examine characteristics and natural history of reported statin-associated ALS-like conditions with attention to factors that may bear on the issue of causality.", 
    "12": "For the present analysis, we focused on cases of statin-associated ALS that were reported to our study group prior to publication of a possible statin-ALS association. Of 35 identified subjects who had contacted the UCSD Statin Effects Study group to report ALS or an ALS-like condition, 18 could not be reached (e.g. contact information was no longer valid). Six were unable to participate (e.g. due to progression of their disease). Of the 11 who could be contacted and were able to participate, one declined to give informed consent. The remaining ten, with either a formal or probable diagnosis of ALS in the context of progressive muscle wasting/weakness arising in association with lipid-lowering drug therapy, completed a mail or phone survey eliciting information about ALS symptom onset and change in association with drug use/modification and development of statin-associated AEs. We reviewed findings in the context of literature on statin antioxidant/pro-oxidant balance, as well as ALS mechanisms involving oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction.", 
    "13": "All ten subjects reported amelioration of symptoms with drug discontinuation and/or onset or exacerbation of symptoms with drug change, rechallenge or dose increase. Three subjects initiated coenzyme Q10 supplementation; all reported initial benefit. All subjects reportedly developed statin AEs (not indicative of ALS) prior to ALS symptom onset, strongly disproportionate to expectation (p < 0.001). Since this reflects induction of pro-oxidant effects from statins, these findings lend weight to a literature-supported mechanism by which induction by statins of oxidative stress with amplification of mitochondrial dysfunction, arising in a vulnerable subgroup, may propel mechanisms underlying both AEs and, more rarely, ALS.", 
    "14": "A theoretical foundation and preliminary clinical observations suggest that statins (and other lipid-lowering drugs) may rarely be associated with ALS in vulnerable individuals in whom pro-oxidant effects of statins predominate. Our observations have explanatory relevance extending to ALS causes that are not statin associated and to statin-associated neurodegenerative conditions that are not ALS. They suggest means for identification of a possible vulnerable subgroup. Indeed whether statins may, in contrast, confer ALS protection when antioxidant effects predominate merits examination.", 
    "15": "Aging is associated with a large increase in the prevalence and incidence of arteriosclerotic diseases including cerebrovascular disease and coronary artery disease. Prevention of arteriosclerosis is a major challenge in order to increase longevity of populations. Hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia are known as lifestyle-related diseases and risk factors for arteriosclerosis. The tight control of blood pressure, glucose and LDL cholesterol is important in preventing arteriosclerosis. Many clinical trials have been revealed pleiotropic effects among antihypertensive drugs, hypoglycemic drugs and statins, and these effects are useful for anti-aging. Selection of appropriate medicines to manage the risk factors would be a way to prevent senescence.", 
    "16": "We conducted a 24-month, open-label trial to evaluate the long-term effects of statins on vascular symptoms in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). Ten patients received 10 mg/day atorvastatin, but two dropped out to treat other organ involvement. Raynaud's phenomenon, global measures of health, and psychological scales were assessed in addition to circulating angiogenic factors and endothelial activation/injury markers in eight patients at 0 (pretreatment), 1, 3, 12, and 24 months of treatment. Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) were serially quantified by cell sorting and three-color flow cytometry. There were no adverse events. Raynaud's phenomenon improved during atorvastatin treatment, with significant reductions in the Raynaud's Condition Score (P = 0.01) and the patient assessment by visual analog scale (P = 0.0003). SSc-associated upregulation of angiogenic factors and vascular endothelial activation/injury markers were reduced (P < 0.01 for all comparisons). Improvement in these parameters was best at 12 and 24 months of treatment. The EPC number was increased at 1 month of treatment (P < 0.01), but soon dropped below baseline. This pilot study suggests that statins may be beneficial in treating vascular manifestations of SSc, through their pleiotropic effects. However, this treatment did not correct the defect in EPC recruitment.", 
    "17": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia in clinical practice. The understanding of the pathophysiology of AF has changed during the last several decades, and a significant role of inflammation and of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has been postulated both experimentally and clinically. There is emerging evidence of an association between inflammation and AF, and mounting evidence links increased C-reactive protein levels not only to already existing AF but also to the risk of developing future AF. The beneficial effects of statins on AF have been reported in several studies. Several randomized clinical and large observational studies have shown similar result that show the beneficial effect of statins in AF. In clinical studies, statins were considered effective in preventing AF after electrical cardioversion, post-ablation, and after permanent pacemaker and implantable cardioverter defibrillator insertion. The antiarrhythmic mechanisms of statins regarding AF prevention in patients with heart failure are still not clear. Perioperative statin use has been associated with favorable postoperative outcome in both cardiovascular and noncardiovascular conditions. Despite a growing body of evidence that drugs with anti-inflammatory properties such as statins may prevent AF, the observed positive effects of statins on the burden of AF appeared to be independent of their cholesterol-reducing properties. However, further data from large-scale randomized trials are clearly needed.", 
    "18": "This study investigated the effect of simvastatin on the expression of OX40 and OX40 ligand (OX40L) in vitro and in vivo. OX40 and OX40L mRNA and protein levels were measured in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, respectively, in response to simvastatin alone or given in combination with interferon-gamma, mevalonate or GW9662, a peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) antagonist. Simvastatin induced down-regulation of OX40 and OX40L mRNA and protein in a concentration-dependent manner, and antagonized the interferon-gamma-induced increase in OX40 and OX40L mRNA and protein levels. Mevalonate, but not GW9662, reversed the simvastatin-induced down-regulation of OX40 and OX40L expression, indicating that these effects were mediated through the mevalonate pathway. Serum levels of soluble OX40L and matrix metalloproteinase 9 levels were significantly reduced in patients with atherosclerotic cerebral infarction who were treated for 6 months with routine therapy plus simvastatin (n = 46) compared with patients receiving routine therapy alone (n = 30). These findings improve our understanding of the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of simvastatin treatment for atherosclerotic disorders.", 
    "19": "Epidemiological, experimental studies and post hoc analyses of randomized trials suggested that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and statins could be beneficial in chronic heart failure. Two double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials investigated the efficacy and safety of n-3 PUFA 1 g daily (R1) and rosuvastatin 10 mg daily (R2) in patients with heart failure. In total, 6975 and 4574 patients were randomized in R1 and R2, respectively; the main reason for excluding patients from R2 being the open-label administration of statin treatment. Primary end points were death, and death or admission to hospital for cardiovascular reasons. n-3 PUFA, but not rosuvastatin, significantly decreased the two coprimary end points: 56 and 44 patients needed to be treated with n-3 PUFA for a median duration of 3.9 years to avoid one death or one cumulative event. Both drugs were safe and were tolerated. A simple and safe treatment with n-3 PUFA provides a beneficial advantage in patients with heart failure in a context of usual care.",

We aimed at determining the genes and pathways involved in the protective effect of statin treatment during hypertension. Chronic inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis by Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) induced accelerated hypertension which was slightly reduced by cotreatment with atorvastatin (100 mg/kg/day). Gene expression profile of aortic media was strongly modified by atorvastatin cotreatment which prevented modulation of many genes regulated by L-NAME administration (described in Dupuis, M., Soubrier, F., Brocheriou, I., Raoux, S., Haloui, M., Louedec, L., Michel, J.B., Nadaud, S., 2004. Profiling of aortic smooth muscle cell gene expression in response to chronic inhibition of nitric oxide synthase in rats. Circulation 110, 867-873). The functional classification of these genes highlighted several major biological pathways modulated in aortic media by atorvastatin: effectors involved in smooth muscle tone; extracellular matrix; intracellular mediators of cell proliferation. Moreover, atorvastatin partially prevented arterial wall thickening, TGF-beta pathway activation, MCP-1 induction and smooth muscle cell proliferation induced by L-NAME treatment although blood pressure was only slightly reduced, suggesting mechanisms independent of blood pressure levels. The induction of PPARalpha mRNA expression by atorvastatin in L-NAME treated rats also suggests that this pathway could participate in the protective effect. In conclusion, our data show that atorvastatin specifically antagonizes a set of genes modulated by L-NAME-induced accelerated hypertension.",

Statins, as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors, have the potential to limit the growth of these tumors by limiting the isoprenylation of activated GTPases in Tsc2-null cells. We tested atorvastatin as a therapy for (a) ethylnitrosourea (ENU)-enhanced renal cystadenoma and (b) spontaneous liver hemangioma in 129Sv/Jae Tsc2(+/-) mice. ENU-treated Tsc2(+/-) mice were given atorvastatin chow (0.1%, w/w) for 1 or 3 months before sacrifice at 6 months; 129Sv/Jae Tsc2(+/-) mice were given atorvastatin chow (0.1%, w/w) for 6 months before sacrifice at 12 months.

Pathologic analyses revealed a predominance of renal cystadenoma in ENU-treated and liver hemangioma in non-ENU-treated 129Sv/Jae Tsc2(+/-) mice. In both cohorts, serum cholesterol levels and levels of phosphorylated S6 and GTP-RhoA in healthy tissue were significantly (>50%) reduced in atorvastatin-treated mice as compared with controls. Following atorvastatin treatment, no significant reduction in tumor size, morphology, or phosphorylated S6 levels was observed for either ENU-associated renal cystadenoma or spontaneous liver hemangioma as compared with the untreated groups. In conclusion, although the marked reduction in cholesterol levels indicates that atorvastatin was effective as an 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitor, it did not inhibit the growth of tumors that develop in these Tsc2(+/-) models, suggesting that it is unlikely to have benefit as a single-agent therapy for TSC-associated tumors.",

To address differences in outcome during pravastatin therapy (40 mg/day), plasma markers of cholesterol synthesis (desmosterol, lathosterol) and fractional cholesterol absorption (campesterol, sitosterol) were measured, baseline and on treatment, in the Prospective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk trial participants with (cases, n = 223) and without (controls, n = 257) a CHD event. Pravastatin therapy decreased plasma LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides and increased HDL-cholesterol concentrations to a similar extent in cases and controls.

These data suggest that decreases in cholesterol synthesis in response to pravastatin treatment were accompanied by modest compensatory increases in fractional cholesterol absorption. The magnitude of these alterations were similar between cases and controls and do not explain differences in outcomes with pravastatin treatment.", 
    "95": "The aetiology of aortic aneurysms (AAs) is the subject of intense clinical investigation. One of the critical points in their pathogenesis is the disruption of the balance between vascular extracellular matrix deposition and degradation. AAs are common features in some genetically determined diseases of the connective tissue, such as Marfan and Loeys-Dietz Syndromes. Acquired factors determining an enhanced inflammatory state of the arterial wall also play a key role. Previous studies have determined the role of TGF-beta as the principal mediator of the pathogenesis of the alterations of the arterial wall homeostasis in aneurysms. The current medical management of any AA is mainly focused on the use of pharmacological agents that reduce hemodynamic stress of aortic wall, since hypertension is the major risk factor for the enlargement and rupture of the AAs. Thus, this approach is useful to reduce the risk of aneurysm rupture but is far from being a comprehensive pathophysiology-based therapeutic approach. Drugs with the potential of reducing the action of TGF-beta, which activation and expression has been reported to have a major role in the molecular pathogenesis of the aneurysms, improving matrix repair, decreasing the proteolytic pattern and inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme as well as preventing angiotensin II-induced AT1R (angiotensin type 1 receptor) activation, can represent new options in the medical therapy of AAs. We propose that a combination of statins and PPAR-gamma agonist could be a useful adjunctive therapy in this condition. The new pathophysiology-based therapeutic approach, involving the pathological patterns and mechanisms leading to the rupture of the AAs, could represent an interesting additional tool in combination with the current established anti-hypertensive therapy.", 
    "96": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of wet milling on the solid state of indomethacin (IMC) and simvastatin (SIM). Wet milling was performed using high pressure homogenization (HPH). Polyvinylpyrrolidone-K25 (PVP) and poloxamer 407 (P407) were used as suspension stabilizers. Samples were characterized before and after wet milling using particle size analyzer, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), infrared (IR) spectroscopy and modulated temperature differential scanning calorimetry (MTDSC) techniques. After wet milling of IMC, physical appearance and IR spectra indicated surface amorphization; however, the solid state of SIM remained unaffected. MTDSC could not detect surface amorphization in IMC, suggesting that if present, it was only at very low levels. These results are in contradiction to the previous reports where dry milling of IMC and SIM resulted in amorphization of crystalline particles. Moreover, cryogrinding of IMC in the absence of water resulted in an amorphous form while presence of water using the same cryogrinding conditions resulted in a solid state similar to that obtained after wet milling. These results signify the role of water in inhibiting the amorphization during wet milling of crystalline drugs.",

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of pioglitazone on triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in patients from the Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events (PROactive) to determine whether pioglitazone-induced lipid effects were altered by different baseline antihyperglycemia medication or statin use. PROactive was a long-term, randomized, double-blind, cardiovascular outcomes study in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk who had pioglitazone or placebo added to existing treatment. The present post hoc study analyzed lipid results from patients who received different baseline antihyperglycemia regimens and the presence or absence of baseline statin use. Independent of antihyperglycemia medication and statin use, triglyceride levels decreased in all subgroups treated with pioglitazone (-9.9% to -12.3%), whereas little change was observed in placebo groups. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased nearly twice as much with pioglitazone (18.1% to 20.3%) as with placebo (8.1% to 11.8%) across all subgroups. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased moderately with pioglitazone (5.2% to 9.6%) compared with placebo (3.3% to 7.6%) (placebo-adjusted range 1.11% to 4.37%).

The causes of death were prospectively assessed by an end point committee unaware of the study treatment. A total of 225 patients (14.3%) died, 113 within the first 30 days and 112 between 31 days and 3 years. The mortality and causes of death did not differ between the 2 treatments. The causes of death were cardiogenic shock/congestive heart failure (41%), sudden death (17%), other cardiac death (10%), cancer (12%), and other noncardiac death (20%). Cardiac death was predominant during the first month only (86% of early deaths), and noncardiac death and cardiac death were equally frequent after 30 days (49% and 51% of late deaths, respectively). Independent predictors of death after discharge were age, left ventricular ejection fraction, diabetes, Killip class, and a lack of treatment with a beta blocker or statin. In conclusion, the causes of death did not differ between alteplase treatment and primary angioplasty with stent implantation. One half of the deaths within 3 years after ST-elevation myocardial infarction occurred during the first 30 days, and cardiac death was predominant during the first 30 days only.",

All patients had serial echocardiograms. Patients with mitral stenosis, aortic valve replacement, renal failure, calcium disorders, or left ventricular ejection fraction <40% were excluded. Aortic valve area (AVA) was calculated using the continuity equation. There was no significant difference in age, gender, renal function, hypertension, statin use, diabetes, or calcium level between the 2 groups. Mean baseline AVA was 1.33 cm(2) and not significantly different between groups. After a mean of 2.4 +/- 1.0 years, mean annual changes in AVA were -0.22 +/- 0.22 cm(2) in those not on OT and -0.10 +/- 0.18 cm(2) in patients receiving OT (p = 0.025). There was a graded association between AS progression rate and OT. In a multivariable analysis including age, gender, and statin use, only OT was associated with a change in AVA. In conclusion, OT is strongly and independently associated with decreased progression of AS. This association warrants investigation in a larger, prospective study.",

The efficacy and clinical safety of dalcetrapib 300, 600, and 900 mg or placebo were assessed (n = 838) in 4 pooled 4-week phase IIa trials (1 monotherapy, n = 193; 3 statin combination, n = 353) and 1 12-week phase IIb trial (with pravastatin, n = 292). Nonclinical safety, assessed by the induction of aldosterone production and aldosterone synthase (cytochrome P450 11B2) messenger ribonucleic acid, was measured in human adrenocarcinoma (H295R) cells exposed to dalcetrapib or torcetrapib. Dalcetrapib increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by up to 36% and apolipoprotein A-I by up to 16%. The incidence of adverse events (AEs) was similar between placebo (42%) and dalcetrapib 300 mg (50%) and 600 mg (42%), with more events with dalcetrapib 900 mg (58%) (p <0.05, pooled 4-week studies). Six serious AEs (3 with placebo, 1 with dalcetrapib 300 mg, and 2 with dalcetrapib 600 mg) were considered \"unrelated\" to treatment. Cardiovascular AEs were similar across treatment groups, with no dose-related trends and no clinically relevant changes in blood pressure or electrocardiographic results. Findings were similar in the 12-week study. In vitro, torcetrapib but not dalcetrapib increased aldosterone production and cytochrome P450 11B2 messenger ribonucleic acid levels. In conclusion, dalcetrapib alone or in combination with statins was effective at increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and was well tolerated, without clinically relevant changes in blood pressure or cardiovascular AEs and no effects on aldosterone production as assessed nonclinically.",

The rates of key safety end points, including death, hemorrhagic stroke, and liver and muscle enzyme elevations, and key efficacy end points (atheroma burden) were compared using chi-square testing or Fisher's exact testing. The analysis included 471 patients who had had their LDL cholesterol measured at 3 months, of whom 340 (72.2%) had LDL cholesterol of <70 mg/dl, exhibiting excellent achievement of even the most stringent guideline-based goals. Of these 471 subjects, 192 (40.8%) had LDL cholesterol > or =40 mg/dl but <60 mg/dl, and 57 (12.1%) had LDL cholesterol <40 mg/dl. Adverse events occurred infrequently during the trial, and no pattern appeared relating the frequency of any adverse event to the achieved LDL cholesterol. Similarly, the on-treatment atheroma volume, change in atheroma volume, and high percentage of subjects with atheroma regression did not differ by the achieved LDL cholesterol. In conclusion, although the power to detect such changes was limited, these data showed no clear relation between the LDL cholesterol achieved by intensive statin therapy with rosuvastatin and adverse effects. Atheroma regression occurred in most patients and was not linked to the LDL cholesterol achieved.",

However, patients often do not adhere to their statin therapy. Discontinuation rates, though improved over time, remain high not only in primary but also in secondary prevention patients in the clinical practice. Recent studies have found that discontinuing statins, particularly after acute events (e.g. acute myocardial infarction or stroke), has a harmful effect on cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality; patients who discontinued their statin therapy had worse outcomes than those who were never prescribed statins. This could be attributed to a biological rebound phenomenon.", 
    "116": "Statin therapy has a number of beneficial effects on patient outcomes and should be prescribed according to current cardiovascular disease guidelines. Importantly, statin discontinuation is associated with harmful outcomes. Clinicians should become more aware of these effects and counsel their patients to adhere to their statin therapy. Current evidence suggests that, unless contraindicated, statins should not be discontinued, especially after an acute vascular event.",

Low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C; <1.03 mmol/l or <40 mg/dl) are an independent risk factor for CVD, and raising levels of HDL-C is a major treatment strategy for regressing atherosclerosis and enhancing CVD risk reduction. This can be achieved by both nonpharmacological lifestyle measures and pharmacological treatment strategies.",

Extended-release nicotinic acid (or Niacin) remains the most effective pharmacological treatment currently available for elevating HDL-C, having recently been combined with simvastatin (as Simcor) and laropripant (as Cordaptive, to reduce flushing). Other HDL-C-raising agents in current clinical use or in clinical development are fibrates, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists, cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors, and HDL-C mimetics. Novel pharmacological targets for raising HDL-C also include the nuclear liver X and farnesoid X receptors and endothelial lipase.",

Available evidence suggests that an overly aggressive approach to lowering of glucose may contribute to complications; different hypoglycaemic agents may vary in the likelihood with which their use may give rise to complications. Thus, a decrease of glucose levels below that recommended in available guidelines is not recommended.",

The third group (control) received phosphate-buffered saline orally for 14 days. Neurological functional outcome was measured with modified neurological severity scores performed 1 day before TBI; on days 1, 4, 7, 14 after TBI; and biweekly thereafter. All animals were sacrificed 3 months after TBI. Brain tissues of half of the animals were processed for preparation of paraffin-embedded sections for immunohistological studies.

Simvastatin treatment of 1.0 mg/kg increased the number of morphologically intact neurons in the hippocampus, but treatment of 0.5 mg/kg had no significant effect. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay studies showed that 0.5 mg/kg simvastatin significantly increased BDNF levels within the hippocampus, but 1.0 mg/kg had no significant effect. Neither dose had any effect on BDNF levels within the cortex.",

Simvastatin was administered orally starting at day 1 after TBI until animals were killed at days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 35 after treatment. Functional outcome was measured using modified neurological severity scores. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemical staining were used to measure the expression of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha and to identify activated microglial cells and astrocytes.", 
    "129": "At days 1 and 3 after simvastatin or saline treatment, cytokine levels in the lesion boundary zone were significantly higher in the simvastatin- and saline-treated rats compared with the sham group, peaking at day 3. Simvastatin only reduced the level of IL-1beta but not IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, compared with the saline group. Also, simvastatin significantly reduced the number of activated microglial cells and astrocytes compared with the saline control animals. There was also a trend toward improvement of modified neurological severity score, reaching statistical significance (P = 0.003) toward the end of the trial.", 
    "130": "Our data demonstrate that TBI causes inflammatory reaction, including increased levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, as well as activated microglial cells. Simvastatin selectively reduces IL-1beta expression and inhibits the activation of microglial cells and astrocytes after TBI, which might be one of the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic benefits of simvastatin treatment of TBI.",

The study population consisted of 3516 patients who were prescribed statins and for whom full cholesterol results were available. After three months of treatment, there were significant reductions in CL (p<0.001) in the three treatment groups stratified by adherence (good adherents -24%, poor adherents -22%, and nonadherents -14%). Patients more likely to achieve the target CL were older, male and more adherent to the statins. The risk of first hospitalization was associated positively with increased age and male gender. Patients with co-treatments were more likely to be hospitalized. Surprisingly, better adherence to statin treatment increased the risk of hospitalization.",

Increased plasma levels of leptin are measurable in the plasma of obese individuals. However, the possible links between obesity and cardiovascular disease are not completely understood. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a predictor of future cardiovascular events and plays a role in atherothrombotic disease.

A polyclonal antibody against human PCSK9 was used to develop an ELISA that measures total plasma PCSK9 rather than only the mature form. A cross-sectional study evaluated plasma levels in normal (n = 254) and hypercholesterolemic (n = 200) subjects treated or untreated with statins or statin plus ezetimibe. In controls, mean plasma PCSK9 (89.5 +/- 31.9 ng/ml) correlated positively with age, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides, and fasting glucose. Sequencing PCSK9 from individuals at the extremes of the normal PCSK9 distribution identified a new loss-of-function R434W variant associated with lower levels of circulating PCSK9 and LDL-C. In hypercholesterolemic subjects, PCSK9 levels were higher than in controls (99.3 +/- 31.7 ng/ml, P < 0.04) and increased in proportion to the statin dose, combined or not with ezetimibe. In treated patients (n = 139), those with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH; due to LDL receptor gene mutations) had higher PCSK9 values than non-FH (147.01 +/- 42.5 vs. 127.2 +/- 40.8 ng/ml, P < 0.005), but LDL-C reduction correlated positively with achieved plasma PCSK9 levels to a similar extent in both subsets (r = 0.316, P < 0.02 in FH and r = 0.275, P < 0.009 in non-FH). The detection of circulating PCSK9 in both FH and non-FH subjects means that this assay could be used to monitor response to therapy in a wide range of patients.", 
    "147": "Statins are competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, a rate-limiting step of the mevalonate pathway. The pleiotropic effects of statins may be due to inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, as well as decreased availability of several biologically important intermediate components of the mevalonate pathway, including two substrates for isoprenylation (farnesyl pyrophosphate [FPP] and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate [GGPP]). Recently, we demonstrated statin-induced inhibition of ovarian theca-interstitial cell proliferation in vitro, as well as reduction of testosterone levels in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This study evaluates the relative contribution of inhibition of isoprenylation and/or cholesterol availability to the modulation of theca-interstitial proliferation. Rat theca-interstitial cells were cultured in chemically defined media with or without simvastatin, FPP, GGPP, squalene, and/or two membrane-permeable forms of cholesterol (25-hydroxycholesterol and 22-hydroxycholesterol). Simvastatin inhibited DNA synthesis and the count of viable cells. The effects of simvastatin were partly abrogated by FPP and GGPP but not by squalene or cholesterol. Inhibition of farnesyl transferase and geranylgeranyl transferase reduced cell proliferation. The present findings indicate that simvastatin inhibits proliferation of theca-interstitial cells, at least in part, by reduction of isoprenylation. These observations provide likely mechanisms explaining clinically observed improvement of ovarian hyperandrogenism in women with PCOS.",

Eight weeks later, all above parameters were remeasured and repeated again at days 1, 4 and 7 after atorvastatin withdrawal.",

Abrupt withdrawal of atorvastatin caused sharp increase of inflammatory markers and endothelial dysfunction at days 4 and 7 after atorvastatin withdrawal independent of the changes of blood lipids.", 
    "151": "High-fat diet could cause endothelial dysfunction associated with inflammation, and atorvastatin could counter-regulate it. Sudden withdrawal of statins could induce rebound of inflammatory response and endothelial dysfunction independent of changes of lipids, which may be responsible for increased cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease after withdrawing statins.", 
    "152": "The number of well-controlled hypertensives is unacceptably low worldwide. Respecting the circadian variation of blood pressure, nontraditional antihypertensives, and treatment in early stages of hypertension are potential ways to improve hypertension therapy. First, prominent variations in circadian rhythm are characteristic for blood pressure. The revolutionary MAPEC (Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring and Cardiovascular Events) study, in 3000 adult hypertensives investigates, whether chronotherapy influences the cardiovascular prognosis beyond blood pressure reduction per se. Second, melatonin, statins and aliskiren are hopeful drugs for hypertension treatment. Melatonin, through its scavenging and antioxidant effects, preservation of NO availability, sympatholytic effect or specific melatonin receptor activation exerts antihypertensive and anti-remodeling effects and may be useful especially in patients with nondipping nighttime blood pressure pattern or with nocturnal hypertension and in hypertensives with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Owing to its multifunctional physiological actions, this indolamine may offer cardiovascular protection far beyond its hemodynamic benefit. Statins exert several pleiotropic effects through inhibition of small guanosine triphosphate-binding proteins such as Ras and Rho. Remarkably, statins reduce blood pressure in hypertensive patients and more importantly they attenuate LVH. Addition of statins should be considered for high-risk hypertensives, for hypertensives with LVH, and possibly for high-risk prehypertensive patients. The direct renin inhibitor, aliskiren, inhibits catalytic activity of renin molecules in circulation and in the kidney, thus lowering angiotensin II levels. Furthermore, aliskiren by modifying the prorenin conformation may prevent prorenin activation. At present, aliskiren should be considered in hypertensive patients not sufficiently controlled or intolerant to other inhibitors of renin-angiotensin system. Third, TROPHY (Trial of Preventing Hypertension) is the first pharmacological intervention for prehypertensive patients revealing that treatment with angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker attenuates hypertension development and thus decreases the risk of cardiovascular events.",

We noted a similar trend in octogenarians, although the peak was somewhat earlier. The prescription of statins was found to have increased eightfold between 1992 and 2003.", 
    "181": "The rate of carotid intervention has declined significantly from a peak in the late 1990s. This peak was at least partly accounted for by North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial and Advances in Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial, [corrected] studies that were conducted largely before the advent of statins. The number of persons in the community on statins has increased enormously since that time. We ponder over the influence of statins on the natural history of carotid artery disease and the implication this has for future trials of carotid intervention in asymptomatic patients.", 
    "182": "Preoperative preparation of patients with cardiovascular disease is best initiated by the general practitioner. Updated Guidelines on Perioperative Cardiovascular Evaluation and Care for Noncardiac Surgery have been published by the American Heart Association und American College of Cardiology (2007). Individual cardiac evaluation must take into account active cardiac conditions, functional capacity, additional clinical risk factors and surgical risk. Stable, asymptomatic patients with normal functional capacity can proceed to elective anesthesia and surgery without further cardiac evaluation. Active cardiac conditions require evaluation and treatment by a cardiology service prior to elective surgery. In stable patients with poor (<4 metabolic equivalents, MET) or unknown functional capacity and clinical risk factors, who are scheduled for intermediate- or high-risk surgery, further cardiac evaluation and preparation is to be considered. Established indicated beta blocker and statin medication is to be continued; timely institution of beta blocker medication (target heart rate, <65 bpm) may be required depending on the risk of surgery, the presence of coronary heart disease, and the number of clinical risk factors present. Following percutaneous coronary intervention, specific waiting periods are required prior to elective surgery. In patients on antiplatelet therapy, the risk of stopping it should be weighed against the benefit of reduction in bleeding complications from the planned surgery.", 
    "183": "Hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) are the most common high-risk group to develop heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Recent reports have noted the favorable effect of statins on LVH. We evaluated the effect of rosuvastatin on cardiac remodeling, function, and progression to heart failure in a hypertensive rat model with established LVH. Dahl salt-sensitive rats were fed a high-salt diet until 13 weeks of age. After LVH was confirmed by echocardiography, rats were randomly assigned to control and statin treatment (n=18 each group). The statin-treated group was treated with rosuvastatin until 21 weeks of ages. Serial echocardiography, blood pressure monitoring, and miniaturized conductance catheter hemodynamic monitoring were performed at 21 weeks. Echocardiographic parameters were not significantly different between the groups. On hemodynamic monitoring, systolic performance parameters were similar between the groups, whereas end diastolic pressure-volume relationships were lower in the statin-treated group (0.014+/-0.008 versus 0.008+/-0.004 mm Hg/muL, P<0.05), suggesting improvement in myocardial stiffness. Pathological analysis showed attenuation of perivascular and interstitial fibrosis in the statin-treated group (P<0.02). Rosuvastatin therapy did not alleviate LVH in hypertensive rats with established LVH, but it attenuated myocardial fibrosis and LV stiffness. It seems that rosuvastatin has limited therapeutic value when used to prevent progression from LVH to heart failure in hypertensive hearts.", 
    "184": "Late endosomes (LEs) have characteristic intracellular distributions determined by their interactions with various motor proteins. Motor proteins associated to the dynactin subunit p150(Glued) bind to LEs via the Rab7 effector Rab7-interacting lysosomal protein (RILP) in association with the oxysterol-binding protein ORP1L. We found that cholesterol levels in LEs are sensed by ORP1L and are lower in peripheral vesicles. Under low cholesterol conditions, ORP1L conformation induces the formation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-LE membrane contact sites. At these sites, the ER protein VAP (VAMP [vesicle-associated membrane protein]-associated ER protein) can interact in trans with the Rab7-RILP complex to remove p150(Glued) and associated motors. LEs then move to the microtubule plus end. Under high cholesterol conditions, as in Niemann-Pick type C disease, this process is prevented, and LEs accumulate at the microtubule minus end as the result of dynein motor activity. These data explain how the ER and cholesterol control the association of LEs with motor proteins and their positioning in cells.", 
    "185": "The use of statins for secondary prevention after acute coronary syndrome is well established. In recent years, trials have investigated the dose of statins used and timing of administration. Initiation of statin therapy as early as 1 day after an acute coronary syndrome event has been shown to be effective in reducing major adverse cardiovascular events. The benefit of early statin use is linked to reduction in inflammation and increased compliance with therapy. In addition, intensive therapy further reduces events and inflammation, as reflected by decreased C-reactive protein. Given the findings of these recent studies, early and intensive lipid-lowering therapy with a statin is justified and safe.", 
    "186": "Beside their cholesterol lowering effect, statins exert pleiotropic effects, which include anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive and anti-proliferative actions. In higher concentrations, statins trigger apoptosis in primary cells and tumour cells. In particular, melanoma cells have been found to be susceptible to statin-induced apoptosis, although only after longer incubation times. The molecular mechanisms behind this delayed drug-induced apoptosis are still unclear.", 
    "187": "The human melanoma A375 and 518A2 cell lines were exposed to various statins in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner, and indicators of apoptosis, caspase activity and individual apoptotic pathways were analysed for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase dependent and independent effects.", 
    "188": "Kinetic analysis of statin-induced apoptosis revealed an apoptotic burst for exposure times longer than 24 h. While the extrinsic pathway was not activated within 24 h, longer incubation times corroborated amplification of the mitochondrial pathway with significant activation of caspase 8. Continuous refreshing of the simvastatin-containing medium abrogated the mitochondrial amplification loop via caspase 8. Moreover, conditional medium, supplemented with mevalonic acid in order to nullify a possible contamination by statins, significantly triggered caspase 8 activity. Fas ligand was excluded as a possible candidate to account for the statin-induced autocrine amplification loop.", 
    "189": "Simvastatin and atorvastatin are capable of triggering an 'autocrine' suicide factor, which amplifies apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway in human melanoma cells. This pro-apoptotic stimulus implies possible therapeutic potential and may guide feasibility for more potent statins in anti-cancer strategies.", 
    "190": "To investigate the impact of lipid lowering therapy by different means on skin microvascular function in patients with dysglycaemia and coronary artery disease (CAD).", 
    "191": "Thirty-six patients were randomized to simvastatin 80 mg daily (S80, n = 19) or ezetimibe 10 mg and simvastatin 10 mg daily (E10/S10, n = 17) for 6 weeks. Skin microvascular function was assessed by laser Doppler fluxmetry (LDF) at rest, following arterial occlusion (peak postocclusive LDF) and following local heating on the forearm (heat arm LDF) and foot (heat foot LDF). LDF parameters and serum lipids were evaluated at baseline and follow-up.", 
    "192": "At follow-up, LDL cholesterol had decreased from 3.1 (2.7-3.5) to 1.6 (1.5-1.8) (mmol L(-1)) and 3.0 (2.4-3.9) to 1.3 (1.1-1.8) (mmol L(-1)) in the E10/S10 and S80 groups respectively. In the entire study group (n = 32), LDF parameters increased significantly; postocclusive LDF from 22 (17-27) to 26 (21-32) perfusion units (PU) (P < 0.001), heat foot LDF from 61 (44-82) to 66 (45-83) PU (P < 0.001) and heat arm LDF from 60 (48-121) to 75 (54-125) PU (P < 0.01). The changes in LDF parameters did not differ between the E10/S10 and S80 groups.", 
    "193": "Lipid lowering improves microvascular function in patients with dysglycaemia and CAD. The data suggest that lipid lowering per se is more important than pleiotropic effects of statins for this effect."
