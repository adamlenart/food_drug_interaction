Important biomarkers of the vasculature are related to endothelial dysfunction, to inflammatory and coagulation processes, and to oxidative stress in DM. Several therapeutic strategies might exert favorable effects on the vasculature of diabetic patients, such as insulin analogues, antihypertensive agents, statins, and hypoglycemic agents, whereas in spite of the prominent role of oxidative stress in diabetes, antioxidant therapy remains controversial.

These conditions are caused by bacterial biofilms on teeth, which stimulate a chronic inflammatory response that leads to loss of alveolar bone and, ultimately, the tooth. Current treatment methods for periodontitis address specific parts of the disease, with no individual treatment serving as a complete therapy. The present research sought to demonstrate development of a multiple drug delivery system for stepwise treatment of different stages of periodontal disease. More specifically, multilayered films were fabricated from an association polymer comprising cellulose acetate phthalate and Pluronic F-127 to achieve sequential release of drugs. The four types of drugs used were metronidazole, ketoprofen, doxycycline, and simvastatin to eliminate infection, inhibit inflammation, prevent tissue destruction, and aid bone regeneration, respectively. Different erosion times and adjustable sequential release profiles were achieved by modifying the number of layers or by inclusion of a slower-eroding polymer layer. Analysis of antibiotic and anti-inflammatory bioactivity showed that drugs released from the devices retained 100% bioactivity. The multilayered CAPP delivery system offers a versatile approach for releasing different drugs based on the pathogenesis of periodontitis and other conditions.", 
    "12": "Mutations of the tumor suppressor genes tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)1 and TSC2 cause pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) and tuberous sclerosis (TS). Current rapamycin-based therapies for TS and LAM have a predominantly cytostatic effect, and disease progression resumes with therapy cessation. Evidence of RhoA GTPase activation in LAM-derived and human TSC2-null cells suggests that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor statins can be used as potential adjuvant agents. The goal of this study was to determine which statin (simvastatin or atorvastatin) is more effective in suppressing TSC2-null cell growth and signaling. Simvastatin, but not atorvastatin, showed a concentration-dependent (0.5-10 \u03bcM) inhibitory effect on mouse TSC2-null and human LAM-derived cell growth. Treatment with 10 \u03bcM simvastatin induced dramatic disruption of TSC2-null cell monolayer and cell rounding; in contrast, few changes were observed in cells treated with the same concentration of atorvastatin. Combined treatment of rapamycin with simvastatin but not with atorvastatin showed a synergistic growth-inhibitory effect on TSC2-null cells. Simvastatin, but not atorvastatin, inhibited the activity of prosurvival serine-threonine kinase Akt and induced marked up-regulation of cleaved caspase-3, a marker of cell apoptosis. Simvastatin, but not atorvastatin, also induced concentration-dependent inhibition of p42/p44 Erk and mTORC1. Thus, our data show growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic effects of simvastatin on TSC2-null cells compared with atorvastatin. These findings have translational significance for combinatorial therapeutic strategies of simvastatin to inhibit TSC2-null cell survival in TS and LAM.",

Despite their documented efficacy, there is considerable interindividual variation in effects of statins on CVD biomarkers.

    "14": "Tri-block poly(lactide)-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactide) (PLA-PEG-PLA) copolymers were synthesized and used to prepare polymersomes loaded separately by the hydrophobic and hydrophilic model drugs, atorvastatin and lisinopril, respectively. The resulting nanostructures were characterized by various techniques such as FTIR, DSC, PCS and AFM. The polymersomes exhibited high encapsulation efficiencies of almost 78% and 70.8% for atorvastatin and lisinopril, respectively. Investigation on FTIR and DSC results revealed that such a high encapsulation efficiency is due to strong interaction between atorvastatin and the copolymer. The impact of drug/copolymer ratio and copolymer composition on drug-loading efficiency and drug release behavior were also studied. The results showed that in case of lisinopril, polymersomes exhibited a triphasic drug release, while for atorvastatin a biphasic release profile was obtained. Overall, the results indicated that PLA-PEG-PLA polymersomes can be considered as a promising carrier for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs.", 
    "15": "The NLRP-3 (nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, pyrin domain-containing-3) inflammasome has recently emerged as a pivotal regulator of chronic inflammation. The aim of the present study was to determine whether NLRP3 inflammasome is expressed in patients with CAD (coronary artery disease) and whether statins (atorvastatin or rosuvastatin) might affect NLRP3 levels. In an in\u00a0vitro study, human THP-1 cells treated with statins were analysed for NLRP3 inflammasome levels. The present study included 60 patients with CAD and 30 subjects without CAD (non-CAD). Patients with CAD randomly received either 8 months of treatment with atorvastatin or rosuvastatin. PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) were obtained from peripheral blood at baseline and after 8 months of statin therapy. Levels of NLRP3 inflammasome, IL (interleukin)-1\u03b2 and IL-18 were measured by real-time RT-PCR (reverse transcription-PCR) and FACS. Levels of NLRP3 inflammasome were higher in the CAD group than in the non-CAD group. There was a positive correlation between NLRP3 inflammasome and cytokines (IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18) levels. A randomized clinical study has shown that atorvastatin markedly diminished NLRP3 inflammasome levels, whereas rosuvastatin had no impact on these levels. Levels of NLRP3 inflammasome decreased in THP-1 cells treated with statins compared with those treated with vehicle, and the fold changes in NLRP3 inflammasome were higher in THP-1 cells treated with atorvastatin compared with those treated with rosuvastatin. The present study suggests that atorvastatin down-regulates NLRP3 inflammasome expression in CAD, possibly contributing to the inhibitory effects of atorvastatin on chronic inflammation and atherogenic progression in this disorder.",

The effects of simvastatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) alone or in combination on the growth and apoptosis of the human cholangiocarcinoma cell line EGI-1 and the gallbladder carcinoma cell line Mz-ChA-1 cells were evaluated in vitro. Real-time PCR and western blot were used to determine E2F-1 and thymidylate synthase (TS) expressions in the treated cells. Tumoricidal efficacy of simvastatin and S-1 was further investigated in a subcutaneous bile duct cancer model in NOD/SCID mice. Simvastatin enhanced the cytotoxicity of 5-FU on bile duct cancer cells in vitro. IC50 of 5-FU alone was 4.34 \u03bcmol/l for EGI-1 and 13.9 \u03bcmol/l for MZ-ChA-1, whereas it decreased markedly to 0.90 and 2.95 \u03bcmol/l, respectively, when combined with simvastatin. The Chou and Talalay combination index of 5-FU and simvastatin was 0.41 and 0.40 at IC50 for EGI-1 and MZ-ChA-1, respectively. Simvastatin alone or plus 5-FU significantly suppressed E2F-1 and TS expressions in EGI-1 and MZ-ChA-1. Simvastatin plus 5-FU induced greater proportion of apoptotic cells on both EGI-1 and MZ-ChA-1, with an increase in cleaved caspase-3 levels, compared with simvastatin or 5-FU alone (all P < 0.05). Simvastatin plus S-1 induced greater tumor inhibition than simvastatin or S-1 alone with E2F-1/TS downregulation in vivo (all P < 0.05).

In 18 healthy participants individual CYP3A activity was quantified using midazolam metabolic clearance both alone and during CYP3A inhibition with 40\u2009mg ritonavir. Thereafter, simvastatin acid exposure was determined after a simvastatin standard dose (40\u2009mg) and doses adapted to individual CYP3A activity at baseline and during CYP3A inhibition. Interindividual variability of CYP3A activity and simvastatin acid AUC0-24 was large and both correlated (r(2) \u2009=\u20090.745, P\u2009<\u2009.001). The adapted simvastatin doses ranged from 25 to 80\u2009mg and their administration reduced simvastatin variability fivefold. Despite the low adapted simvastatin dose of 12\u2009mg during CYP3A inhibition with ritonavir, exposure increased (point estimate of 4.2 [90% CI: 3.15-5.61]) probably caused by additional OATP1B1 inhibition. CYP3A activity-based dose adaptation can be used to reduce interindividual variability in simvastatin exposure.", 
    "60": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of death from cancer. The incidence and mortality of HCC are increasing in most Western countries as a result of an ageing cohort infected with chronic hepatitis C, and are expected to continue to rise as a consequence of the obesity epidemic. Chemopreventive strategies aimed at decreasing the risk or delaying the onset of HCC are needed. Universal immunization against HBV and antiviral therapy against HBV and HCV in patients with established disease has consistently been associated with reduced HCC risk, especially in patients who achieve sustained virologic response. However, the cost-effectiveness of antiviral therapy for primary HCC prevention is not known. Several commonly prescribed medications seem promising as chemopreventive agents against HCC, including statins, antidiabetic medications and aspirin. Dietary agents such as coffee, vitamin E and fish oil as well as phytochemicals might also be associated with reduced risk of HCC. Though randomized controlled trials are ideally needed to firmly establish efficacy, such chemoprevention trials are logistically and ethically challenging. Well-designed, prospective, population-based cohort studies might provide the best evidence for chemopreventive efficacy of these agents.",

As such, risk assessment tools such as the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) often fail to classify these patients as high risk. In this study, we tested the ability of assessment of carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) to enhance the ability to identify patients who are at risk for STEMI, using a CIMT-derived \"vascular age\" in place of chronologic age in the calculation of FRS. We applied a CIMT-based vascular age to the assessment of FRS in a cohort of patients who presented with a first STEMI. Using CIMT-derived vascular age in place of chronologic age increased both the mean FRS and predicted 10\u00a0year cardiovascular event rate of the cohort. More importantly, the use of a CIMT-derived vascular age in the calculation of FRS significantly improved the ability to identify patients with STEMI as high risk and candidates for statin therapy based on ATPIII criteria (19.2% vs. 57.7%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.010). The use of CIMT to derive a vascular age may improve the ability of FRS to identify patients at risk for STEMI.", 
    "63": "The epidemiologic association between statin use and decreased risk of advanced prostate cancer suggests that statins may inhibit prostate cancer development and/or progression. Studies were performed to determine the effects of a model statin, atorvastatin (ATO), on the proliferation and differentiation of prostate cancer cells, and to identify possible mechanisms of ATO action. ATO inhibited the in vitro proliferation of both LNCaP and PC3 human prostate cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. The greater inhibitory activity of ATO in PC3 cells was associated with induction of autophagy in that cell line, as demonstrated by increased expression of LC3-II. miR-182 was consistently upregulated by ATO in PC3 cells, but not in LNCaP cells. ATO upregulation of miR-182 in PC3 cells was p53-independent and was reversed by geranylgeraniol. Transfection of miR-182 inhibitors decreased expression of miR-182 by >98% and attenuated the antiproliferative activity of ATO. miR-182 expression in PC3 cells was also increased in response to stress induced by serum withdrawal, suggesting that miR-182 upregulation can occur due to nutritional stress. Bcl2 and p21 were identified to be potential target genes of miR-182 in PC3 cells. Bcl2 was downregulated and p21 was upregulated in PC3 cells exposed to ATO. These data suggest that miR-182 may be a stress-responsive miRNA that mediates ATO action in prostate cancer cells.",

Modified Poisson regression models were constructed to adjust for cognitive function status at 3 months, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, case mix, stroke subtype, vascular risk factors, disability, and stroke recurrence. In patients with ischemic strokes without a history of atrial fibrillation (AF), there was a reduced risk of cognitive impairment associated with the use of different prevention treatments: (1) antihypertensives (relative risk, 0.7 [95% confidence interval, 0.57-0.82] for diuretics; relative risk, 0.8 [95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.98] for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; and relative risk, 0.7 [95% confidence interval, 0.55-0.81] for their combination), (2) a combination of aspirin and dipyridamole (relative risk, 0.8 [95% confidence interval, 0.68-1.01]), and (3) statin (relative risk, 0.9 [95% confidence interval, 0.76-1.06]) when clinically indicated. Protective effects against cognitive impairment were also observed in patients on the combination of antihypertensives, antithrombotic agents, and lipid-lowering drugs (relative risk, 0.55 [95% confidence interval, 0.40-0.77]). No significant associations were noted between poststroke cognitive impairment and antihypertensives among hemorrhagic stroke patients.",

It remains to be determined whether statins inhibit cardiac remodeling through interfering with TNF\u2011\u03b1\u2011JNK\u2011related signaling pathways. This study was designed to investigate the effect of pravastatin on the progression of hypertrophy to heart failure in transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and the associations with TNF\u2011\u03b1\u2011JNK signaling. Either pravastatin (5 or 20 mg/kg/day) or vehicle was orally administered to male C57BL/6J mice with TAC. Cardiac remodeling and left ventricular hemodynamics, as well as JNK-dependent apoptotic signals were analyzed 4 weeks following TAC. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were cultured to investigate the effect of pravastatin on TNF\u2011\u03b1\u2011induced JNK\u2011related apoptotic signals. Notably, pravastatin reduced the heart/body weight and lung/body weight ratios. In addition, a decrease of left ventricular (LV) echocardiographic dimensions, an increase of LV fractional shortening and diastolic index, a reduction of JNK activity, caspase\u201112 and Bax were observed in the pravastatin\u2011treated groups. The TNF\u2011\u03b1\u2011induced phosphorylation of JNK and upregulation of caspase\u201112 and Bax in cultured cardiomyocytes was inhibited by pravastatin. These results indicated that pravastatin attenuates cardiac remodeling by inhibiting JNK\u2011dependent pro\u2011apoptotic signaling.", 
    "72": "The positive health benefits of statins extend beyond the cardiovascular and include increased flow mediated dilation, decreased atrial fibrillation, modest antihypertensive effects and reduced risks of malignancies. Prominent among the statin side-effects are myalgia and muscular weakness, which may be associated with a rise in circulating creatine kinase values. In increasing severity and decreasing incidence, the statin-induced muscle related conditions are myalgia, myopathy with elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels with or without symptoms, and rhabdomyolysis. Statin use may increase CK levels without decreasing average muscle strength or exercise performance. In one large study, only about 2\u00a0% had myalgia that could be attributed to statin use. A novel current hypothesis is that statins optimize cardiac mitochondrial function but impair the vulnerable skeletal muscle by inducing different levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in these two sites. In an important observational study, both statins and exercise reduced the adverse outcomes of cardiovascular disease, and the effects were additive. The major unresolved problem is that either can cause muscular symptoms with elevation of blood creatine kinase levels. There is, as yet, no clearly defined outcomes based policy to deal with such symptoms from use of either statins or exercise or both. A reasonable practical approach is to assess the creatine kinase levels, and if elevated to reduce the statin dose or the intensity of exercise.", 
    "73": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects and explore the mechanism of a local injection of a single dose of simvastatin as a strategy to strengthen target bone. Simvastatin was injected into the femurs (5 or 10 mg) or caudal vertebrae (1 or 2 mg) of ovariectomized rats, with an equal volume of vehicle injected as a control. Bone mineral density (BMD), bone microstructure and strength were evaluated at 1 and 5 months post-injection for the femurs and at 12 days post-injection for the vertebrae. Bone mass, adipocyte numbers and Runx2 expression were also examined using histology and immunohistochemistry. Compared with controls, simvastatin significantly increased BMD, bone volume fraction (BV/TV), improved bone microstructural parameters and bone strength in the femurs at both time points (all P < 0.01). Simvastatin-treated femurs contained fewer adipocytes and a higher Runx2 expression. For the caudal vertebrae, simvastatin significantly improved BV/TV, bone microstructures, and bone strength (all P < 0.01) as compared with controls. In conclusion, local injection of a single dose of simvastatin induces early onset and long-lasting bone augmentation in osteoporotic bone, significantly improving BMD, and bone microstructure and biomechanical strength. Simvastatin induces Runx2 expression, which may function to induce osteogenesis and inhibit adipogenesis as an underlying mechanism to augment bone mass.", 
    "74": "Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated early reductions in cardiovascular events occurring independently of the lipid-lowering effects of statins. These pleiotropic effects have been attributed to antiinflammatory properties, to atherosclerotic plaque stabilization, and more recently to mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). Our aim was to evaluate the evidence supporting statin-induced EPC mobilization in humans. We, therefore, performed a computerized literature search and systematic review of randomized trials to determine the effect of statin therapy and statin dosing on circulating EPC numbers. Our literature search identified 10 studies including 479 patients which met inclusion criteria with publication dates ranging from 2005 to 2011. Seven studies compared statin to nonstatin regimens whereas 3 studied low versus high-dose statin therapy. Reported increases in EPC number ranged from 25.8% to 223.5% with a median reported increase of 70.2% when compared to nonstatin regimens with 7 of 10 studies reporting significant increases. Considerable heterogeneity exists in regard to patient population, statin regimens, and the definition of an EPC within the identified studies. In conclusion, randomized studies in humans suggest that statin therapy mobilizes EPCs into the circulation. Larger randomized studies using uniform definitions are needed to definitively establish this effect.",

    "79": "Recent studies demonstrated that simvastatin has antitumor properties in several types of cancer cells, mainly by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting growth. The arrest of proliferation is a feature of cellular senescence; however, the occurrence of senescence in melanoma cells upon simvastatin treatment has not been investigated until now. Our results demonstrated that exposure of human metastatic melanoma cells (WM9) to simvastatin induces a senescent phenotype, characterized by G1 arrest, positive staining for senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase assay, and morphological changes. Also, the main pathways leading to cell senescence were examined in simvastatin-treated human melanoma cells, and the expression levels of phospho-p53 and p21 were upregulated by simvastatin, suggesting that cell cycle regulators and DNA damage pathways are involved in the onset of senescence. Since simvastatin can act as a pro-oxidant agent, and oxidative stress may be related to senescence, we measured the intracellular ROS levels in WM9 cells upon simvastatin treatment. Interestingly, we found an increased amount of intracellular ROS in these cells, which was accompanied by elevated expression of catalase and peroxiredoxin-1. Collectively, our results demonstrated that simvastatin can induce senescence in human melanoma cells by activation of p53/p21 pathway, and that oxidative stress may be related to this process.", 
    "80": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a significant cause of death in Europe. In addition to patients with proven CVD, those with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are at a particularly high-risk of CVD and associated mortality. Treatment for dyslipidaemia, a principal risk factor for CVD, remains a healthcare priority; evidence supports the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) as the primary objective of dyslipidaemia management. While statins are the treatment of choice for lowering LDL-C in the majority of patients, including those with T2D, many patients retain a high CVD risk despite achieving the recommended LDL-C targets with statins. This 'residual risk' is mainly due to elevated triglyceride (TG) and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. Following statin therapy optimisation additional pharmacotherapy should be considered as part of a multifaceted approach to risk reduction. Fibrates (especially fenofibrate) are the principal agents recommended for add-on therapy to treat elevated TG or low HDL-C levels. Currently, the strongest evidence of benefit is for the addition of fenofibrate to statin treatment in high-risk patients with T2D and dyslipidaemia. An alternative approach is the addition of agents to reduce LDL-C beyond the levels attainable with statin monotherapy. Here, addition of fibrates and niacin to statin therapy is discussed, and novel approaches being developed for HDL-C and TG management, including cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors, Apo A-1 analogues, mipomersen, lomitapide and monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9, are reviewed.",

Demographic factors were observed at baseline. Major risk factors of LEA including peripheral neuropathy, peripheral artery disease, and foot ulcers were observed at baseline and were updated for each period. LEA and deaths were assessed in each period and their hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated.

Inhibition of PCSK9, apoB, and MTTP has been achieved mostly via fully humanized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), antisense oligonucleotides, and synthetic compounds, respectively. PCSK9 inhibitors increase the hepatic uptake of LDL-C, while apoB and MTTP inhibitors decrease the synthesis and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins. These 3 mechanisms lead to marked reductions in plasma LDL-C in patients with hypercholesterolemia at risk for ACS, particularly those with familial hypercholesterolemia. Moreover, these agents can exert additional benefits by decreasing plasma levels of apoB, triglycerides, and lipoprotein(a). Mipomersen and lomitapide have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for use in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. PCSK9 inhibitors are currently under final evaluation in clinical outcomes studies and are anticipated to find wide application either as monotherapy or as an adjunct to statins.

These effects are particularly relevant to high-risk individuals with marked hypercholesterolemia, such as those with familial hypercholesterolemia. Although the use of mipomersen and lomitapide is limited to severe familial hypercholesterolemia as a replacement for LDL-apheresis, PCSK9 inhibitors are likely to be more widely prescribed in patients at high risk for CVD, especially those who are resistant to or intolerant of high-intensity statin therapy. PCSK9 mAbs are efficacious and have an excellent safety profile, but their long-term impact on cardiovascular events is currently under investigation. Whether PCSK9 mAbs decrease the rates of recurrent cardiovascular events within 3 months following ACS is questionable; however, these agents, unlike statins, may not have pleiotropic benefits on the unstable plaque.",

In addition, there was no apparent prolongation of the elimination half-life of pitavastatin due to the decrease in both hepatic clearance and volume of distribution. These findings suggest that DDIs were caused by the inhibition of hepatic uptake of pitavastatin. CsA and RIF increased the AUC of orally administered pitavastatin by 10.6- and 14.8-fold, respectively, which was additionally caused by the effect of the CsA and RIF in the gastrointestinal tract. Hepatic contribution to the overall DDI for oral pitavastatin with CsA was calculated from the changes in hepatic availability and clearance, and it was shown that the magnitude of hepatic DDI was comparable between the present study and the clinical study. In conclusion, pharmacokinetic studies using pitavastatin as a probe in combination with drug candidates in cynomolgus monkeys are useful to support the assessment of potential clinical DDIs involving hepatic uptake transporters.",

Transport activities of DPV in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes and rodent multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (rMrp2; human, MRP2)-expressing membrane vesicles were similar to those of pravastatin. Rifampicin diminished the uptake of DPV and pravastatin by the hepatocytes, with similar inhibition potency.

Systemic elimination of [(11)C]DPV was delayed in rifampicin-treated rat and an Mrp2-deficient mutant rat, Eisai hyperbilirubinemic mutant rat (EHBR). Rifampicin treatment decreased both CLuptake,liver and CLuptake,kidney of [(11)C]DPV by 30% (P < 0.05), whereas these parameters were unchanged in EHBR.

Recently, we showed that simvastatin alters cholesterol distribution in synaptosomal membranes (SPM) in vivo. In the present study, we tested whether these changes in cholesterol membrane distribution affect APP-processing in vivo. Female APP751SL mice were force-fed with simvastatin (50 mg/kg b.wt.) by oral gavage over a time period of 3 weeks. Our data show that chronic simvastatin treatment decreased cholesterol levels in the brain and affected cholesterol distribution within SPM. Simvastatin significantly increased the levels of insoluble Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 but reduced levels of soluble Abeta1-40 in the brain. The reduction of soluble Abeta1-40 levels in the brain was associated with an increase of plasma-levels of AP31.40 in simvastatin-treated animals that may indicate enhanced Abeta1-40-clearance from the brain. Although the observed alteration in transbilayer cholesterol is likely to be involved in changes of APP processing by alpha-, beta- and gamma-secretase, we cannot exclude other potential mechanisms of statins such as lipid and non-lipid related, pleiotropic effects.

We investigate whether Simvastatin and Atorvastatin, the most commonly used alternative, can be considered equivalent in terms of lipid control for patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Priors were elicited from GPs, cardiologists and internists. A systematic review for studies comparing Simvastatin and Atorvastatin was performed.

Ritonavir, gemfibrozil, and erythromycin caused remarkable substrate-dependent inhibition with up to 117-, 14-, and 13-fold difference in their IC\u2085\u2080 values, respectively. Also, the clinically relevant OATP inhibitors rifampin and cyclosporin A exhibited up to 12- and 6-fold variation in their IC\u2085\u2080 values, respectively. Regardless of the inhibitors tested, the most potent OATP1B1 inhibition was observed when [\u00b3H]E\u2082G was used as a substrate. Mutual inhibition studies of OATP1B1 indicated that E\u2082G and E\u2081S competitively inhibited each other, whereas BSP noncompetitively inhibited E\u2082G uptake. In addition, BSP inhibited E\u2081S in a competitive manner, but E\u2081S caused an atypical kinetics on BSP uptake. This study showed substrate-dependent inhibition of OATP1B1 and demonstrated that E\u2082G was the most sensitive in vitro OATP1B1 probe substrate among three substrates tested.

Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of apoptotic and antiapoptotic genes were also evaluated by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for BAX, BCL2, and XIAP genes and quantitative Real-time PCR for CASP3, CASP8, and CASP9 genes. We showed that treatment with Mev alone and DAC followed by Mev resulted in apoptotic response in a time- and dose-dependent manner. We also found that pretreatment with DAC sensitized HL-60 cells to Mev and caused more apoptotic cell death than Mev-alone treatment via caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation. Moreover, sequential addition of Mev after DAC diminished DNA synthesis rate more effectively than Mev-alone treatment. Furthermore, DAC pretreatment significantly increased CASP3 and CASP9 mRNA expression even with lower doses of Mev. BAX, BCL2, and XIAP gene mRNA levels were also found to be changed in the presence of DAC and Mev. Determination of the exact molecular effects of statins and DAC would allow us to identify new molecular targets to develop more effective treatment regimens for cancer.",

Metabolic clearances of verapamil and norverapmil as well as their effects on CYP3A activity were firstly measured in pooled human liver microsomes. The results showed that S-isomers were more preferential to be metabolized than R-isomers for both verapamil and norverapamil, and their inhibitory effects on CYP3A activity were also stereoselective with S-isomers more potent than R-isomers. A semi-physiologically based pharmacokinetic model (semi-PBPK) characterizing mechanism-based auto-inhibition was developed to predict the stereoselective pharmacokinetic profiles of verapamil and norverapamil following single or multiple oral doses. Good simulation was obtained, which indicated that the developed semi-PBPK model can simultaneously predict pharmacokinetic profiles of S-verapamil, R-verapamil, S-norverapamil and R-norverapamil. Contributions of auto-inhibition to verapamil and norverapamil accumulation were also investigated following the 38th oral dose of verapamil sustained-release tablet (240mg once daily). The predicted accumulation ratio was about 1.3-1.5 fold, which was close to the observed data of 1.4-2.1-fold. Finally, the developed semi-PBPK model was further applied to predict drug-drug interactions (DDI) between verapamil and other three CYP3A substrates including midazolam, simvastatin, and cyclosporine A. Successful prediction was also obtained, which indicated that the developed semi-PBPK model incorporating auto-inhibition also showed great advantage on DDI prediction with CYP3A substrates.",

Significantly greater reductions from baseline in LDL-C were also seen in pediatric patients with heterozygous FH receiving colesevelam (alone or in combination with statins) compared with placebo.

THs act through two closely related TH receptors (TRs \u03b1 and \u03b2), which are conditional transcription factors. Recently, TH analogues or thyromimetics with varying degrees of TR subtype and liver uptake selectivity have been developed. These compounds exert beneficial effects of TH excess states without many undesirable TR-dependent side effects. Several selective TR modulators (STRMs) showed exceptionally promising results in lowering serum cholesterol in preclinical animal models and human clinical studies. Moreover, some first generation STRMs elicit other potentially beneficial effects on obesity, glucose metabolism, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). While it was initially thought that STRMs would be an effective long-term therapy to combat elevated cholesterol, possibly in conjunction with another cholesterol-lowering therapy, the statins, three major first generation STRMs failed to progress beyond early phase III human trials. The aim of this review is to discuss how STRMs work, their actions in preclinical animal models and human clinical trials, why they did not progress beyond clinical trials as cholesterol-lowering therapeutics, whether selective TR modulation continues to hold promise for dyslipidemias, and whether members of this drug class could be applied to the treatment of other aspects of metabolic syndrome and human genetic disease.",

Conversely, we found no effect on MMP-2, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 levels or on the MMP-2/TIMP-2 ratio (P\u2009>\u2009.05). The Framingham risk score and Castelli I and II indexes were significantly reduced in the simvastatin-treatment group (P\u2009<\u2009.05), while we found no effect on the placebo group.

    "179": "Hyperlipidemia is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events; reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), the primary target for cholesterol-lowering therapy, lowers the risk for such events. Although bile acid sequestrants were the first class of drugs to show a mortality benefit related to LDL-C lowering, statins are now considered first-line pharmacological therapy for reducing LDL-C levels because of their potency and their remarkable record of successful outcomes studies. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion of patients do not achieve LDL-C goals with statin monotherapy. In addition, because of adverse effects (primarily myopathy), some patients may be unwilling to use or unable to tolerate statin therapy at all or may not tolerate a full therapeutic statin dose. Also, statins may increase risk of new-onset diabetes in patients at high risk for diabetes. Thus, there remains a need for other lipid-lowering drugs to be used in combination with or in place of statins. The purpose of this article is to review available data from the literature on the use of colesevelam, a second-generation bile acid sequestrant, in combination with other lipid-lowering agents. Colesevelam has been studied in combination with statins, niacin, fibrates, and ezetimibe (including some three-drug combinations). An additive reduction in LDL-C was seen with all combinations. Other observed effects of colesevelam in combination with other lipid-lowering drugs include reductions in apolipoprotein (apo) B (with statins, fibrates, ezetimibe, statin plus niacin, or statin plus ezetimibe) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (with statins), and increases in apo A-I (with statins, ezetimibe, or statins plus niacin). Triglyceride levels remained relatively unchanged when colesevelam was combined with statins, fibrates, ezetimibe, or statin plus ezetimibe, and decreased with the triple combination of colesevelam, statin, and niacin. Colesevelam offset the negative glycemic effects of statins and niacin in subjects with insulin resistance or impaired glucose tolerance. Colesevelam was generally well tolerated when added to other lipid-lowering therapies in clinical trials, with gastrointestinal effects such as constipation being the predominant adverse events. Since colesevelam is not absorbed and works primarily in the intestine, it has a low potential for systemic metabolic drug-drug interactions with other drugs. Colesevelam has been shown to not interact with the lipid-lowering drugs lovastatin and fenofibrate; where interaction may be anticipated, separating dosing times by 4 h reduces the impact of any interaction. Available data confirms that colesevelam has additive cholesterol-lowering effects when used in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies. Furthermore, in some patient populations, the additional glucose-lowering effect of colesevelam may be beneficial in offsetting hyperglycemic effects of other lipid-lowering drugs.", 
    "180": "Apolipoprotein B (apoB) has a key role in the assembly and secretion of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) from the liver. Plasma apoB concentration affects the number of circulating atherogenic particles, and serves as an independent predictor of the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. While statins are the most potent apoB-lowering agents currently prescribed, their efficacy in achieving therapeutic targets for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in high-risk patients, such as those with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH), is limited. Resistance and intolerance to statins also occurs in a significant number of patients, necessitating new types of lipid-lowering therapies. Monoclonal antibodies against proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9; AMG 145 and REGN727), a sequence-specific antisense oligonucleotide against apoB mRNA (mipomersen) and a synthetic inhibitor of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP; lomitapide) have been tested in phase III clinical trials, particularly in patients with FH. The trials demonstrated the efficacy of these agents in lowering apoB, LDL-C, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lipoprotein(a) by 32-55\u00a0%, 37-66\u00a0%, 38-61\u00a0% and 22-50\u00a0% (AMG 145), 21-68\u00a0%, 29-72\u00a0%, 16-60\u00a0% and 8-36\u00a0% (REGN727), 16-71\u00a0%, 15-71\u00a0%, 12-66\u00a0% and 23-49\u00a0% (mipomersen) and 24-55\u00a0%, 25-51\u00a0%, 27-50\u00a0% and 15-19\u00a0% (lomitapide), respectively. Monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 have an excellent safety profile and may be indicated not only in heterozygous FH, but also in statin-intolerant patients and those with other inherited dyslipidemias, such as familial combined hyperlipidaemia and familial elevation in Lp(a). Mipomersen and lomitapide increase hepatic fat content and are at present indicated for treating adult patients with homozygous FH alone.",

The solid-state fermentation represents an alternative mode of fermentation, which is increasingly being employed as an alternative to submerged fermentation for metabolite production. The prospect of producing high-value product using low-value raw material offers a substantial premium to switch to these technologies. The cost of statins being one major factor, solid-state fermentation with agro-industrial residues as carbon, nitrogen and support matrix, promises to substantially lower the cost of production. Hence, newer approaches are required to exploit the agro-industrial residues for statin production. The development of these technologies offers an opportunity to exploit low-cost substrates without substantial investment in newer production methodologies. The emerging evidence of beneficial effect of statins in applications other than lipid lowering such as in Alzheimer disease, HIV, age-related dementia, and cancer chemotherapy makes it very important to develop methods for economic production of statins.",

Genetic factors are thought to contribute substantially to treatment outcome. Several candidate genes have been associated with statin dose requirements and treatment outcomes, but a clinically relevant pharmacogenomics test to guide statin therapy has not yet emerged. Here we define basic pharmacogenomics terminology, present strong candidate genes (CETP, HMGCR, SLCO1B1, ABCB1, and CYP3A4/5), and discuss the challenges in developing much-needed statin pharmacogenomics biomarkers for predicting treatment outcomes.",

Thirty-seven na\u00efve-to-treatment genotype 1 HCV patients were randomized to either a control group (n = 20) to receive peginterferon alfa plus ribavirin or an experimental group (n = 18) to similarly receive peginterferon alfa plus ribavirin as well as fluvastatin 20 mg/day. In addition, seven patients who presented for HCV treatment already were on simvastatin and could not be withdrawn.

There were no unique safety issues with fluvastatin or simvastatin when these drugs were given with peginterferon/ribavirin for 48 weeks. Thirteen of 25 statin patients achieved sustained viral response (SVR), while 5 of 20 control patients achieved SVR. Analysis of SVR by intention-to-treat showed P = 0.078. In this phase 2 study, there were no safety issues with the addition of fluvastatin or simvastatin to peginterferon and ribavirin for 48 weeks. There was a trend towards improvement in SVR when fluvastatin or simvastatin was administered with peginterferon/ribavirin.

Current risk estimation tools, such as Framingham Risk Score (FRS), based on evaluation of multiple standard risk factors, are limited in assessment of individual risk. The majority (about 70%) of the general population is classified as low FRS where the individual risk for CVD is often underestimated but, on the other hand, cholesterol lowering with statin is often excessively administered. Adverse effects of statin therapy, such as muscle pain, affect a large proportion of the treated patients and have a significant influence on their quality of life. Coronary artery calcification (CAC), as assessed by computed tomography, carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT), and especially presence of plaques as assessed by B-mode ultrasound are directly correlated with increased risk for cardiovascular events and provide accurate and relevant information for individual risk assessment. Absence of vascular pathology as assessed by these imaging methods has a very high negative predictive value and therefore could be used as a method to reduce significantly the number of subjects who, in our opinion, would not benefit from statins and only suffer from their side-effects. In summary, we suggest that in very-low-risk subjects, with the exception of subjects with low FRS with a family history of coronary artery disease (CAD) at young age, if vascular imaging shows no CAC or normal CIMT without plaques, statin treatment need not be administered.",

We found that at exogenous isoprenol concentrations >10 \u03bcM, this process can generate as much as 50% of the cellular isoprenoid diphosphate pool used for protein isoprenylation. Mutational activation of p53 in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells up-regulates the mevalonate pathway to promote tumor invasiveness. p53 silencing or pharmacological inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase in these cells decreases protein isoprenylation from endogenously synthesized isoprenoids but enhances the use of exogenous isoprenols for this purpose, indicating that this latter process is regulated independently of the mevalonate pathway.

    "209": "We analyzed data from 2770 patients with TIA from 11 centers, 387 with ipsilateral carotid stenosis. ABCD2 score, abnormal diffusion weighted imaging, medication pretreatment, and early stroke were recorded.", 
    "210": "In patients with carotid stenosis, 7-day stroke risk was 8.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.7-11.1) compared with 2.7% (CI, 2.0%-3.4%) without stenosis (P<0.0001; 90-day risks 17.8% and 5.7% [P<0.0001]). Among carotid stenosis patients, nonprocedural 7-day stroke risk was 3.8% (CI, 1.2%-9.7%) with statin treatment at TIA onset, compared with 13.2% (CI, 8.5%-19.8%) in those not statin pretreated (P=0.01; 90-day risks 8.9% versus 20.8% [P=0.01]). Statin pretreatment was associated with reduced stroke risk in patients with carotid stenosis (odds ratio for 90-day stroke, 0.37; CI, 0.17-0.82) but not nonstenosis patients (odds ratio, 1.3; CI, 0.8-2.24; P for interaction, 0.008). On multivariable logistic regression, the association remained after adjustment for ABCD2 score, smoking, antiplatelet treatment, recent TIA, and diffusion weighted imaging hyperintensity (adjusted P for interaction, 0.054).", 
    "211": "In acute symptomatic carotid stenosis, statin pretreatment was associated with reduced stroke risk, consistent with findings from randomized trials in acute coronary syndromes. These data support the hypothesis that statins started acutely after TIA symptom onset may also be beneficial to prevent early stroke. Randomized trials addressing this question are required.", 
    "212": "Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) are wealthy storehouses of patient information, to which data mining techniques can be prudently applied to reveal clinically significant patterns. Detecting patterns in drug-drug interactions, leading to adverse drug reactions is a powerful application of EMR data mining. Adverse effects of drug treatments can be investigated by mining clinical laboratory tests data which are reliable indicators of abnormal physiological functions. We report here the co-medication effects of pravastatin (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor) and paroxetine (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) anti-depressant) on significant clinical parameters, identified through a data mining analysis conducted on the Allscripts data warehouse. We found that the concomitant drug treatments of pravastatin and paroxetine increased the mean values of glucose serum from 113.2 to 132.1\u2009mg/dL and international normalized ratio (INR) from 2.18 to 2.52, respectively. It also decreased the mean values of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from 43 to 37\u2009mL/min/1.73\u2009m(3) and blood CO2 levels from 24.8 to 23.9\u2009mEq/L respectively. Our findings indicate that co-medication of pravastatin and paroxetine might have significant impact on blood anti-coagulation, kidney function, and glucose homeostasis. Our methodology can be applied to any EMR data set to reveal co-medication effects of any drug pairs.", 
    "213": "Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a dominantly inherited disorder characterized by marked elevation of plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations and premature coronary artery disease (CHD). In addition to impaired LDL receptor-mediated clearance of LDL particles, in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that hepatic oversecretion of apolipoprotein (apo) B may contribute to the hypercholesterolemia in FH. This may be due to an effect of the expanded hepatic pool of cholesterol (a consequence of increased receptor-independent uptake of LDL) and/or a direct effect of the LDL receptor on apoB secretion. Hepatic oversecretion of apoB may depend on the type and severity of the genetic mutation causing FH. FH can also increase plasma Lp(a) concentration by an undefined mechanism that may not directly involve the LDL receptor pathway. Decreased catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins could also be due to deficient LDL receptor function, accounting for postprandial dyslipidemia in FH. The metabolism of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in FH is poorly understood, but preliminary data suggest abnormal HDL composition and functionality, as well as altered transport of apoA-I. Beyond effects related to specific genetic defects in the LDL pathway, co-existing secondary causes, particularly obesity and insulin resistance, and other genetic variants may also perturb lipoprotein metabolism in individuals with FH. Furthermore, residual risk remains high in statin-treated FH. Knowledge of an extended metabolic framework will, therefore, provide the basis for judiciously selecting new pharmacotherapies to treat FH, including apoB antisense oligonucleotides, microsomal transfer protein (MTP) inhibitors and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors.", 
    "214": "Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) are neoplastic and normal/cancer stem cell markers and GSL/cholesterol-containing membrane rafts are increased in cancer cell plasma membranes. We define a novel means by which cancer cells can restrict tumor-associated GSL immunoreactivity. The GSL-cholesterol complex reorients GSL carbohydrate to a membrane parallel, rather than perpendicular conformation, largely unavailable for antibody recognition. Methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin cholesterol extraction of all primary human tumor frozen sections tested (ovarian, testicular, neuroblastoma, prostate, breast, colon, pheochromocytoma and ganglioneuroma), unmasked previously \"invisible\" membrane GSLs for immunodetection. In ovarian carcinoma, globotriaosyl ceramide (Gb3), the GSL receptor for the antineoplastic Escherichia coli-derived verotoxin, was increased throughout the tumor. In colon carcinoma, Gb3 detection was vastly increased within the neovasculature and perivascular stroma. In tumors considered Gb3 negative (neuroblastoma, Leydig testicular tumor and pheochromocytoma), neovascular Gb3 was unmasked. Tumor-associated GSL stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA)-1, SSEA-3, SSEA-4 and globoH were unmasked according to tumor: SSEA-1 in prostate/colon; SSEA-3 in prostate; SSEA-4 in pheochromocytoma/some colon tumors; globoH in prostate/some colon tumors. In colon, anti-SSEA-1 was tumor cell specific. Within the GSL-cholesterol complex, filipin-cholesterol binding was also reduced. These results may relate to the ill-defined benefit of statins on cancer prognosis, for example, prostate carcinoma. We found novel anti-tumor GSL antibodies circulating in 3/5 statin-treated, but not untreated, prostate cancer patients. Lowering tumor membrane cholesterol may permit immune recognition of otherwise unavailable tumor-associated GSL carbohydrate, for more effective immunosurveillance and active/passive immunotherapy. Our results show standard immunodetection of tumor GSLs significantly under assesses tumor membrane GSL content, impinging on the current use of such antigens as cancer vaccines.", 
    "215": "Researchers have proposed biological (inflammation) and psychological (depression) factors as potential mechanisms for poorer outcomes and readmissions in heart failure (HF) patients. However, studies investigating the link between inflammation and depressive symptoms in these patients are few. We examined the relationships between levels of the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (sTNR2) and depressive symptoms in HF outpatients.", 
    "216": "55 patients (74.5% men; 60% Whites; mean age 71.6 \u00b1 11.3 years) with New York Heart Association Class II, III, or IV HF (49%, 47%, and 4%, respectively) and mean ejection fraction (EF) 29.9 \u00b1 7.1% completed the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 as a measure of depressive symptoms. We also obtained height, weight, and CRP, IL-6, and sTNFR2 levels. We used multivariate regressions to assess the predictive value of PHQ-9 scores on each inflammatory marker.", 
    "217": "22 (40%) participants reported depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score \u2265 5). After controlling for age, gender, body mass index, HF etiology, EF, and statin use, we found significant relationships between levels of both sTNFR2 (\u03b2 = .35, p = .01) and IL-6 (\u03b2 = .30, p = .04), but not CRP (\u03b2 = -.96, p = .52), and depression scores.", 
    "218": "Our findings add to a growing body of evidence supporting the proposition that heightened inflammation explains the effect depression has on HF. Health care providers should screen for depression in HF patients, as they may be at higher risk of augmented inflammation and poor outcomes.", 
    "219": "Neurogenic bladder is a common complication of several central nervous system injuries. Statins and phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors are reportedly beneficial in neural injuries and urinary system dysfunction. The effect of simvastatin, sildenafil and tadalafil on several renal function indices of an animal model of neurogenic bladder was investigated.", 
    "220": "Forty male rats were assessed in five equal groups. Dura mater and the cord were injured with an aneurysmal clamp at the level of T9-T10 in all rats except in sham group. The sham and control groups (treated by normal saline), simvastatin (4 mg/kg), sildenafil (5 mg/kg), and tadalafil (2 mg/kg) groups received treatment (i.p.) for seven consecutive days following injury. Renal system and motor functions were assessed at day 28 following injury. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc test.", 
    "221": "Simvastatin improved both the renal and the motor function compared with the control group. However, sildenafil and tadalafil could only improve the motor function but could not make any significant differences in renal indices in comparison with the control group.", 
    "222": "Statins can effectively improve the motor and renal functions in a condition of renal dysfunction in a rat model of neurogenic bladder. PDE-5 inhibitors could help to improve motor function, but are not helpful in renal function, at least in short time."
