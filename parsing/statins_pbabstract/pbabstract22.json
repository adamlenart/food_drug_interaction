Inflammatory stress is a susceptibility factor for drug-induced liver injury. This study investigated whether inflammatory stress sensitized the liver to statin-induced toxicity in mice and explored the underlying mechanisms. We used casein injection in ApoE-/- mice to induce inflammatory stress. Half of the mice were orally administered atorvastatin (10mg/kg/d) for 8 weeks. The results showed that casein injection increased the levels of serum pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF\u03b1). Atorvastatin treatment increased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in casein injection mice. Moreover, atorvastatin treatment exacerbated hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis, as well as increased hepatic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde in casein injection mice. However, above changes were not observed in atorvastatin treated alone mice. The protein expression of liver nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and the mRNA expressions of Nrf2 target genes were increased, together with the enhancement of activities of hepatic catalase and superoxide dismutase in atorvastatin treated alone mice, but these antioxidant responses were lost in mice treated with atorvastatin under inflammatory stress. This study demonstrates that atorvastatin exacerbates the liver injury under inflammatory stress, which may be associated with the loss of adaptive antioxidant response mediated by Nrf2.", 
    "1": "Stroke and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are major causes of morbidity and mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), with disease burdens being amongst the highest worldwide. HIV infection has emerged as an important risk factor for stroke. The remarkable development in the treatment of HIV infection which occurred in recent decades has allowed the survival of a large number of patients. This therapeutic success which allows patients to live longer has facilitated the emergence of a new population of adults with increased risk for cardiovascular disease including stroke due to aging, the direct effects of HIV infection and combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART). Preventive strategies to decrease the burden of stroke amongst this specific patient population remain understudied in this region of the world. Lack of early diagnosis (CT scans) and poor record keeping make appreciation of the burden difficult. There is indisputable evidence that early diagnosis and early placement on cART therapy reduce HIV associated morbidity and mortality in this region of the world. However, the emergence of a new population of patients at risk for developing stroke (HIV patients) who fortunately live longer deserves a keener attention. Long term effects of cART regimens on cardiovascular and metabolic profiles remain uncertain, and specific cohort studies to properly ascertain its consequences are needed. The evidence and specific guidelines with regards to anti-platelet therapies and statin use, though potentially beneficial, in this patient sub group remains scarce. African specific cohort studies including HIV positive patients in our opinion should constitute a top research priority, to properly ascertain the potential roles of anti-platelet therapies and statins with regards to primary and secondary prevention of stroke, as well as long term effects of cART on their cardiovascular and metabolic profiles.", 
    "2": "3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are widely used drugs for lowering blood lipid levels and preventing cardiovascular diseases. However, statins can have serious adverse effects, which may be related to development of mitochondrial dysfunctions. The aim of study was to demonstrate the in vivo effect of high and therapeutic doses of statins on mitochondrial respiration in blood platelets. Model approach was used in the study. Simvastatin was administered to rats at a high dose for 4 weeks. Humans were treated with therapeutic doses of rosuvastatin or atorvastatin for 6 weeks. Platelet mitochondrial respiration was measured using high-resolution respirometry. In rats, a significantly lower physiological respiratory rate was found in intact platelets of simvastatin-treated rats compared to controls. In humans, no significant changes in mitochondrial respiration were detected in intact platelets; however, decreased complex I-linked respiration was observed after statin treatment in permeabilized platelets. We propose that the small in vivo effect of statins on platelet energy metabolism can be attributed to drug effects on complex I of the electron transport system. Both intact and permeabilized platelets can be used as a readily available biological model to study changes in cellular energy metabolism in patients treated with statins.", 
    "3": "This study examines whether exposure to direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCAs) for statin drugs is associated with non-pharmaceutical behaviors to prevent cardiovascular disease. We focus on the relationship between statin drug DTCA exposure and the frequency of (a) visits to fast-food restaurants and (b) exercise. We combine data on the televised broadcast availability of statin drug DTCAs in large media markets in the United States with 18 waves of the Simmons National Consumer Survey (NCS; n\u00a0=\u00a0120, 229) from 2001 to 2009. We find that statin drug DTCA exposure is associated, in a dose-response pattern, with modest increases in the frequency of exercise and large increases in the frequency of fast-food-restaurant visits. The relationship between statin DTCA exposure and fast-food-restaurant visits were largely consistent in direction but differed in magnitude between those without a previous diagnosis of high cholesterol and those treating high cholesterol with a statin. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of these results for future research on pharmaceutical DTCA and population health.",

    "7": "Proinflammatory cytokines are associated with the development of post-stroke depression (PSD). Statins are thought to possess anti-inflammatory properties but their interactions with cytokines regarding the risk of PSD have yet to be investigated. Thus, the present study aimed to determine whether interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-18 were associated with the development of depression at 2 weeks and 1year after stroke using a longitudinal post-stroke cohort. Furthermore, this study examined the potential interactions between statin use and cytokines on PSD. For this study, 286 patients were evaluated 2 weeks after stroke and 222 patients were followed-up 1year later. Depression was diagnosed using criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) and then categorized into no PSD or any PSD, which included diagnoses of both major and minor depression. The effects of IL-6 and IL-18 on PSD as well as their interaction with a statin at both examination time-points were investigated using a multivariate logistic regression model. Higher IL-6 and IL-18 levels were independently associated with depressive disorders within 2 weeks and at 1year after stroke. When stratified by statin use, these significant associations were more evident in patients who did not use a statin. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction between statin use and IL-6 on the presence of a depressive disorder at 1year. The present findings support the cytokine hypothesis of PSD and indicate that the preventive effects of statin use against PSD may be mediated by its interactions with IL-6.",

Over the years, clinical outcome studies with LDL-C lowering agents have revealed that reducing LCL-C levels is effective in reducing rates of major ASCVD events. Although secondary factors play a role in clinical expression, severe lipid disorders often have a strong genetic component. Genetic revelations have provided novel targets for improving LDL-C management in high-risk individuals. Most recently, researchers have explored how the inhibition of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) alters LDL metabolism and lowers LDL-C levels to achieve lipid goals and potentially reduce ASCVD risk in patients with severe lipid disorders, including familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). This CMHC Spotlight article summarizes the clinical evidence demonstrating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of PCSK9 inhibitors in lowering LDL-C levels. Reductions in LDL-C levels by PCSK9 inhibitors alone in patients who are statin intolerant or combined with maximally tolerated statins in patients with severe lipid disorders demonstrate the potential for reduced morbidity and mortality associated with ASCVD.",

The objective of this study was to assess the impact of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, pitavastatin, on macrophage miRNAs in the presence and absence of oxidized-LDL, a hallmark of a pro-atherogenic milieu. Treatment of human THP-1 cells with pitavastatin prevented the oxLDL-mediated suppression of miR-33a, -33b and -758 mRNA in these cells, an effect which was not uniquely attributable to induction of SREBP2. Induction of ABCA1 mRNA and protein by oxLDL was inhibited (30%) by pitavastatin, while oxLDL or pitavastatin alone significantly induced and repressed ABCA1 expression, respectively. These findings are consistent with previous reports in macrophages. miRNA profiling was also performed using a miRNA array. We identified specific miRNAs which were up-regulated (122) and down-regulated (107) in THP-1 cells treated with oxLDL plus pitavastatin versus oxLDL alone, indicating distinct regulatory networks in these cells. Moreover, several of the differentially expressed miRNAs identified are functionally associated with cholesterol trafficking (six miRNAs in cells treated with oxLDL versus oxLDL plus pitavastatin). Our findings indicate that pitavastatin can differentially modulate miRNA in the presence of oxLDL; and, our results provide evidence that the net effect on cholesterol homeostasis is mediated by a network of miRNAs.",

Identified RCTs exhibited methodological weaknesses: all but one failed to set inclusion parameters for medication adherence; nearly half lacked sufficient power to detect meaningful effects; and the majority had a risk of bias. Interventions were categorized into five classes (simplification of regimen, prescription cost coverage, reminders, education and information, and multi-faceted) and effects were pooled within each class. Prescription cost coverage, Hedges' g=0.15, 95%CI [0.11:0.21], simplification of drug regimen, Hedges' g=0.38, 95%CI [0.22:0.55], the provision of education, Hedges' g=0.19, 95%CI [0.01:0.37], and the use of multi-faceted interventions, Hedges' g=0.16, 95%CI [0.05:0.27], had small positive effects on statin adherence relative to usual care and reminders were promising, Hedges' g=0.0.27, 95%CI [-0.05:0.60].

Data from observational trials demonstrated that in daily practice only about 20\u2009% of treated high-risk patients reached this recommended LDL cholesterol goal. The therapeutic options are not yet exhausted; patients are treated mainly with low or at most average statin dosages. There should be more potent and high-dose statins used as well as the combination therapy of statin and ezetimibe to achieve the recommended LDL cholesterol goals. Specific cardiac rehabilitation and prevention programs with regular benchmarking could support improved goal-achievement. The new therapeutic option of PCSK9 inhibitors, which significantly and safely lower LDL cholesterol on top of statins and ezetimibe, is currently investigated in large randomized outcome trials.",

A total of 85,859 ever users and 85,859 never users matched on 8 digits of propensity score were followed for the first event of heart failure hospitalization until December 31, 2011. The treatment effect (for ever versus never users, and for tertiles of cumulative duration of therapy) was estimated by Cox regression incorporated with the inverse probability of treatment weighting using propensity score. Additionally, adjusted hazard ratios for heart failure were estimated for the baseline characteristics in sitagliptin ever users. Results showed that the incidence of heart failure hospitalization was 1,020.16 and 832.54 per 100,000 person-years, respectively, for ever and never users, with an overall hazard ratio (95% confidence intervals) of 1.262 (1.167-1.364). While compared to never users, the respective hazard ratio for the first, second, and third tertile of cumulative duration < 3.7, 3.7-10.3 and >10.3 months was 2.721 (2.449-3.023), 1.472 (1.318-1.645) and 0.515 (0.447-0.594). Older age, longer diabetes duration, male sex, and use of insulin, sulfonylurea, calcium channel blockers, aspirin, ticlopidine, clopidogrel and dipyridamole were significantly associated with a higher risk in sitagliptin users, but dyslipidemia and use of metformin and statin were protective. In conclusion, sitagliptin increases the risk of heart failure hospitalization within one year of its use, but reduces the risk thereafter. Some factors predisposing to sitagliptin-related heart failure are worthy of attention in clinical practice.", 
    "79": "Persuasive data from many randomized controlled trials and large, long-term observational studies indicate a modestly increased risk for the emergence of new diabetes after statin initiation. Several meta-analyses of many statin trials as well as longitudinal population-based studies suggest that the risk factors for diabetes in statin-treated persons include underlying risk for diabetes at baseline (specifically features of metabolic syndrome), the intensity of statin therapy, certain genetic traits independent of diabetes risk, and adherence to lifestyle factors. Limited data suggest statins modestly worsen hyperglycemia and A1c levels in those with pre-existing diabetes or glucose intolerance. The precise mechanism(s) of diabetogenesis with statin therapy are unclear, but impaired insulin sensitivity and compromised \u03b2 cell function via enhanced intracellular cholesterol uptake due to inhibition of intracellular cholesterol synthesis by statins, as well as other mechanisms, may be involved. Furthermore, while statins are known to have anti-inflammatory effects, it is hypothesized that, under dysmetabolic conditions, they might have pro-inflammatory effects via induction of certain inflammasomes. This concept requires further elucidation in the human. Finally, it is clear that the risk-benefit ratio for cardiovascular disease events is strongly in favor of statin therapy in those at risk, despite the emergence of new diabetes. Adherence to lifestyle regimen is critical in the prevention of new diabetes on statins.",

We sought to systematically identify, critically evaluate and concisely summarize the practice implications of 10 articles published in 2015 for the practicing perioperative clinician.", 
    "109": "Statins are the cornerstone of the management of dyslipidaemias and prevention of cardiovascular disease. Although statins are, overall, safe and well tolerated, adverse events can occur and constitute an important barrier to maintaining long-term adherence to statin treatment. In patients who cannot tolerate statins, alternative treatments include switch to another statin, intermittent-dosage regimens and non-statin lipid-lowering medications. Nonetheless, a high proportion of statin-intolerant patients are unable to achieve recommended low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goals, thereby resulting in substantial residual cardiovascular risk. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a protease implicated in LDL receptor degradation and plays a central role in cholesterol metabolism. In recent studies, PCSK9 inhibition by means of monoclonal antibodies achieved LDL cholesterol reductions of 50% to 70% across various patient populations and background lipid-lowering therapies, while maintaining a favourable safety profile. The efficacy and safety of the monoclonal antibodies alirocumab and evolocumab were confirmed in statin-intolerant patients, indicating that PCSK9 inhibitors represent an attractive treatment option in this challenging clinical setting. PCSK9 inhibitors recently received regulatory approval for clinical use and may be considered in properly selected patients according to current consensus documents, including patients with statin intolerance. In this review we summarise current evidence regarding diagnostic evaluation of statin-related adverse events, particularly statin-associated muscle symptoms, and we discuss current recommendations on the management of statin-intolerant patients. In view of emerging evidence of the efficacy and safety of PCSK9 inhibitors, we further discuss the role of monoclonal PCSK9 antibodies in the management of statin-intolerant hypercholesterolaemic patients.",

The first cerebral angiography was conducted before the first injection of sodium or autologous blood into the cisterna magna. The second angiography was done three days after the second injection. The ultrastructural pathology of the basilar artery was compared in three groups. The expression of platelet-derived growth factor-\u03b2 (PDGF-\u03b2), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) in VSMCs was analysed by RT-PCR.",

    "114": "Current guidelines for managing cholesterol to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk focus on providing the appropriate intensity of statin therapy to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level. There is very little evidence supporting the use of treatments aimed at raising high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level or reducing triglyceride levels. HIV-infected persons have excess risk of CVD compared with the general population. Statins are less effective at reducing LDL-C levels in HIV-infected persons who are also at greater risk for adverse effects from statin treatment. When selecting a statin to achieve desired lowering of LDL-C level, the potential for drug interactions with antiretroviral therapy must be considered. Information from ongoing research is expected to help identify optimal strategies for use of statin treatment in this population. This article summarizes a presentation by James H. Stein, MD, at the IAS-USA continuing education program, Improving the Management of HIV Disease, held in Chicago, Illinois, in May 201.", 
    "115": "The perioperative period is associated with alterations in the neuroendocrine, metabolic, and immune systems, referred to as \"stress response.\" The resultant increased sympathetic activity and elevated serum concentrations of catecholamines may adversely affect the cardiovascular system, resulting in cardiovascular instability (hypertension, tachycardia, and arrhythmia), morbidity (myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, and stroke), and mortality (cardiac death and fatal stroke), particularly in patients at an elevated cardiovascular risk and with reduced cardiovascular reserve. Various strategies have been used to ameliorate the adverse perioperative cardiovascular sequelae of the perioperative stress response. Effective pharmacologic blunting of the stress response plays a crucial role in perioperative cardiac risk reduction strategies. In this context, the role of beta-adrenoceptor blockers, alpha2-adrenoceptor agonists, and statins has been extensively examined. This chapter evaluates the available evidence with respect to treatment efficacy of these commonly prescribed drugs in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery.",

Here, a cohort of patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) was analyzed to further investigate associations between preoperative use of statins and recurrence, and progression free and overall survival. Patients who had surgery for GBM (N=284) were followed up for a median of 18.1months. Seventy-eight patients were taking statins preoperatively while the rest were not. Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for several covariates of interest were applied before and after propensity score matching. Compared with statin users, those not taking the lipid-lowering drugs had similar progression free survival before (hazard ratio [HR] 0.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70-1.26; p=0.68) and after propensity score matching (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.67-1.35; p=0.68). Mortality was similar between both groups of patients before (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.70-1.22; p=\u20090.73) and after propensity score matching (HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.78-1.64; p=0.49). Age and dexamethasone use were independent prognostic factors of survival. Contrary to previously published evidence, this study could not find an association between preoperative statin use and longer survival in GBM patients. Due to the small number of patients and retrospective nature of the study, further work is needed to understand the role of perioperative statins in GBM patients.", 
    "117": "Several lines of evidences support a possible involvement of serum cholesterol in the development of dementia/Alzheimer's disease (AD), with hypercholesterolemia as one of the risk factors that can be targeted by therapeutic interventions. It has also been suggested that statins, prescribed as lipid-lowering drugs to patients at risk for cardiovascular conditions, may be useful in both the prevention and treatment of AD. Currently, conflicting evidences from epidemiological studies indicate a controversial association between dyslipidemia and dementia/AD risk. In randomized clinical trials, virtually no beneficial effect of statin therapy has been observed. On the other hand, in vitro and in vivo animal experiments have revealed that statins suppress amyloid \u03b2 protein (A\u03b2) generation. All these findings suggest that statins can be potentially used as preventive or therapeutic agents for AD. In addition, currently the pathophysiological process of AD is thought to begin many years before the diagnosis of AD dementia. Then, statin treatment as well as some disease-modifying therapies may be more efficacious at an early stage of AD including preclinical AD or mild cognitive impairment due to AD.",

The most important advantage of developed method is that all seven statin drugs can be determined on a single chromatographic system without modification in detection wavelength. An organic modifier addition (25% v/v methanol) in the presence of buffer (20mM ammonium acetate; pH 4.0 adjusted with dilute acetic acid) played a key role in the resolution of statin drugs in gradient elution with acetonitrile. The drugs were separated on a Purospher Star 4.6mm \u00d7 25cm, 5\u03bcm, C18 column maintained at 25\u00b0C with 1mLmin(-1) flow rate using ultra violet detection at 240nm. Good separation (Rs > 2.5) was achieved in a short analysis allowing simultaneous determination of all seven statins. The effect of variation in flow rate, detection wavelength and column oven temperature was also studied.

Atorvastatin, or competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, is mainstay agent in hypercholesterolemia treatment. Beyond the cholesterol-lowering activity, exploration of neuroprotective properties of this statin indicates its potential benefit in central nervous disorders. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of atorvastatin in development and expression of morphine-induced analgesic tolerance in male mice and probable involvement of nitric oxide. Chronic and acute treatment with atorvastatin 10 and 20mg/kg, respectively, could alleviate morphine tolerance in development and expression phases. Chronic co-administration of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors including L-NAME (non selective NOS inhibitor; 2mg/kg), aminoguanidine (selective inducible NOS inhibitor; 50mg/kg) and 7-NI (selective neuronal NOS inhibitor; 15mg/kg) with atorvastatin blocked the protective effect of atorvastatin in tolerance reversal. Moreover, reversing the atorvastatin effect was also observed in acute simultaneous treatment of L-NAME (5mg/kg) and aminoguanidine (100mg/kg) with atorvastatin. Co-treatment of guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, ODQ (chronic dose: 10mg/kg and acute dose: 20mg/kg) was associated with prevention of atorvastatin anti-tolerance properties.

We added laboratory measurements, to our knowledge not included in previous investigations, to a case-control analysis of 2877 case patients and 142 850 matched control subjects enrolled in Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Addressing confounding by indication by restricting subjects to those with elevated cholesterol greatly attenuated the negative association; eg, the multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (OR) rose from 0.41 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.35 to 0.49) to 0.87 (95% CI\u2009=\u20090.55 to 1.39) for receipt of 18 or more prescriptions.

    "183": "Statin-induced skeletal muscle damage in rats is associated to the reduction of the resting sarcolemmal chloride conductance (gCl) and ClC-1 chloride channel expression. These drugs also affect the ClC-1 regulation by increasing protein kinase C (PKC) activity, which phosphorylate and close the channel. Also the intracellular resting calcium (restCa) level is increased. Similar alterations are observed in skeletal muscles of aged rats, suggesting a higher risk of statin myotoxicity. To verify this hypothesis, we performed a 4-5-weeks atorvastatin treatment of 24-months-old rats to evaluate the ClC-1 channel function by the two-intracellular microelectrodes technique as well as transcript and protein expression of different genes sensitive to statins by quantitative real-time-PCR and western blot analysis. The restCa was measured using FURA-2 imaging, and histological analysis of muscle sections was performed. The results show a marked reduction of resting gCl, in agreement with the reduced ClC-1 mRNA and protein expression in atorvastatin-treated aged rats, with respect to treated adult animals. The observed changes in myocyte-enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) expression may be involved in ClC-1 expression changes. The activity of PKC was also increased and further modulate the gCl in treated aged rats. In parallel, a marked reduction of the expression of glycolytic and mitochondrial enzymes demonstrates an impairment of muscle metabolism. No worsening of restCa or histological features was found in statin-treated aged animals. These findings suggest that a strong reduction of gCl and alteration of muscle metabolism coupled to muscle atrophy may contribute to the increased risk of statin-induced myopathy in the elderly.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS SD rats were obtained to construct AMI models by ligating their left anterior descending coronary arteries (LAD). We conducted echocardiography to check the 6 involved indexes: left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEF), fractional shortening (FS), left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVV), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVVd), cardiac output (CO), and heart rate (HR). Moreover, antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was carried out to determine MI markers: creatine kinase (CK), CK Isoenzyme (CK-MB), and Troponin I (cTn I). Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay was performed to confirm the targeting of miR-126 and VEGF-A. MTT assay provided insight into the proliferation of myocardial fibroblasts. Finally, RT-RCR and Western blot were used for the detection of miR-126 and VEGF-A expressions in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS Luciferase activity assay showed that miR-126 transfection significantly decreased the relative luciferase activity in HEK293T cells when it was bound to normal 3' UTR of VEGF-A (P<0.05). In comparison to the control group, rats in the AMI model group had significantly lower LVEF, FS, and CO, and substantially higher LVVs, LVVd, HR, CK/U, CK-MB/U, and cTn-1/U (all P<0.05). Down-regulated miR-126 and up-regulated VEGF-A were also observed in MI models (P<0.05).

Whether intravenous thrombolytic therapy decreases disability in minor stroke patients and whether acute endovascular intervention improves functional outcomes in patients with minor stroke and known large vessel occlusion remain controversial. Studies are ongoing to determine ideal antiplatelet therapy for stroke and TIA, while ongoing statin therapy, surgical management for patients with carotid stenosis, and anticoagulation for patients with atrial fibrillation have all been proven to decrease the rate of stroke recurrence and improve outcomes.

One hundred and sixty-one (4.4%) had a bleeding event during their index admission, and 271 (7.4%) patients were re-hospitalised with bleeding during follow-up. Sixty-one patients (37.9%) were transfused for bleeding in the index admission cohort, and 59 patients (21.8%) at a subsequent admission. Procedural bleeding was the most common event during the index admission, whereas gastrointestinal bleeding was the most common delayed bleeding presentation.", 
    "223": "One in ten ACS patients experienced a significant bleeding event within 2 years. The use of this ICD-10 bleeding definition in national ACS cohorts will facilitate the study of bleeding event incidence and type over time and between geographical regions, both nationally and internationally, and the impact of changes in anti-thrombotic therapy and interventional practice.", 
    "224": "INTRODUCTION\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Patients with established coronary artery disease (CAD) are at high risk of recurrent cardiovascular events. OBJECTIVES\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The aim of the study was to identify factors related to control of hypercholesterolemia in patients after hospitalization for CAD. PATIENTS AND METHODS\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The study included consecutive patients from 5 hospitals with cardiology departments serving one city in southern Poland. Patients were hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome or for a myocardial revascularization procedure. Interviews and examinations were conducted 6 to 18 months after hospitalization. RESULTS\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Overall, 83.6% of the patients were taking statins; 2.1%, fibrates; and 0.5%, ezetimibe. A statin at a high dose (\u226540 mg of atorvastatin or \u226520 mg of rosuvastatin) was taken by 36.1% of the participants. Younger age and index hospitalization in a teaching hospital were significantly associated with a higher probability of taking a statin. Overall, 28.1% of the patients had good control of hypercholesterolemia (low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol levels <1.8 mmol/l), whereas 71.9%, 38.6%, 24.4%, and 10.3% had LDL cholesterol levels of 1.8 mmol/l or higher, 2.5 mmol/l or higher, 3.0 mmol/l or higher, and 4.0 mmol/l or higher, respectively. Younger age, high blood pressure, and high fasting glucose levels were related to a higher probability of having LDL cholesterol levels of 1.8 mmol/l or higher, while younger age, shorter period of education, professional inactivity, lack of cardiac rehabilitation, and high blood pressure were related to the probability of LDL cholesterol levels of 4.0 mmol/l or higher. CONCLUSIONS\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The frequency of statin use is affected by age and health care-related factors, while control of hypercholesterolemia after hospitalization due to CAD is dependent mainly on patient-related and clinical factors.", 
    "225": "Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-7 mediates ischemic tolerance and anti-fibrotic effects in various organs such as kidney and heart. Recently, reno- and podocyte-protective effects of a potent HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, pitavastatin, were accompanied by BMP-7 upregulation.", 
    "226": "Here, we investigated the effect of simvastatin treatment on BMP-7 expression in major MHC-mismatched rat cardiac allografts subjected to ischemia-reperfusion injury and adaptive immune activation at 10 days.", 
    "227": "We localized Smad2 activity and Reca-1+ fibroblast specific protein-1+ immunoreactivity, suggesting endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, at fibrotic borderline of cardiac allografts at 10 days. Simvastatin donor and recipient combination treatment significantly upregulated cardiac allograft BMP-7 expression when compared to nontreated controls at 10 days.", 
    "228": "The beneficial effect of statin treatment on cardiac allograft may in part be mediated through the upregulation of BMP-7.", 
    "229": "There are some reports about the antitumor effects of statins in these days. Statins decrease the level of cholesterol in the blood by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase. Inhibition of this enzyme decreases intracellular cholesterol synthesis. Thus, the expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) is increased to import more cholesterol from the bloodstream. In this study, we assessed the effects of statins on the proliferation of prostate cancer cells, and studied the relationship between the expression of LDLr and the effects of statins.", 
    "230": "Simvastatin was used in the experiments. We studied the effect of simvastatin on PC-3 and LNCaP cell proliferation using the MTS assay, and evaluated the expression of LDLr after administration of simvastatin by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Intracellular cholesterol levels in the prostate cancer cells were measured after administration of simvastatin. Furthermore, small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to knockdown the gene expression of LDLr.", 
    "231": "In PC-3\u00a0cells, simvastatin inhibited cell proliferation. In LNCaP cells, only a high concentration of simvastatin (100\u03bcM) inhibited cell proliferation. In LNCaP cells, the protein level of LDLr was increased by simvastatin. In PC-3\u00a0cells, the protein levels of LDLr were unregulated. In PC-3\u00a0cells, but not in LNCaP cells, intracellular cholesterol levels were significantly decreased by simvastatin. After knocking down LDLr expression by siRNA, intracellular cholesterol levels were decreased, and cell proliferation was inhibited by simvastatin in LNCaP cells.", 
    "232": "Simvastatin inhibited prostate cancer cell growth by decreasing cellular cholesterol and could be more effective in androgen-independent prostate cancer, where there is loss of regulation of LDLr expression. LDLr was shown to play an important role in the statin-induced inhibition of prostate cancer cell proliferation. These results suggest that future studies evaluating the cholesterol-lowering effects of statin may lead to new approaches to the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer.", 
    "233": "The benefit-risk balance for drugs can alter post approval owing to additional data on efficacy or adverse events. This study developed a quantitative benefit-risk assessment (BRA) model for statins using multicriteria decision analysis with discrete choice experiments and compared a recent BRA with that at the time of approval.", 
    "234": "Following a systematic review of the literature, the benefit criteria within the statin BRA model were defined as a reduction in the plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and a reduction in myocardial infarction incidence; the risk criteria were hepatotoxicity (Liv) and fatal rhabdomyolysis (Rha). The scores for these criteria were estimated using mixed treatment comparison methods. Weighting was calculated from a discrete choice experiment involving 203 Korean patients. The scores and weights were integrated to produce an overall value representing the benefit-risk balance, and sensitivity analyses were conducted.", 
    "235": "In this BRA model, low-density lipoprotein (relative importance [RI]: 37.50%) was found to be a more important benefit criterion than myocardial infarction (RI: 35.43%), and Liv (RI: 16.28%) was a more important risk criterion than Rha (RI: 10.79%). Patients preferred atorvastatin, and the preference ranking of cerivastatin and simvastatin was switched post approval because of the emergence of additional risk information related to cerivastatin.", 
    "236": "A quantitative statin BRA model confirmed that the preference ranking of statins changed post approval because of the identification of additional benefits or risks.", 
    "237": "Periprocedural myocardial infarction (MI) is a frequent complication of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Statins might reduce its incidence. The aims of the present study\u00a0are to assess whether such benefit is a class-effect or whether differences exist between various lipid-lowering strategies and whether cardioprotection\u00a0is exerted by increasing circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs).", 
    "238": "The REMEDY study will enroll a total of 1080 patients submitted to elective PCI. Eligible patients will be randomized into 4 groups: 1) placebo; 2) atorvastatin (80\u00a0mg\u00a0+\u00a040\u00a0mg before PCI); 3) rosuvastatin (40\u00a0mg twice before PCI); and 4) rosuvastatin (5\u00a0mg) and ezetimibe (10\u00a0mg) twice before PCI. Peri-procedural MI is defined as an elevation of markers of cardiac injury (either CK-MB or troponin I or T) values >5x the upper reference limit estimated at the 99th percentile of the normal distribution, or a rise >20\u00a0% in case of baseline values already elevated. EPCs will be assessed before, at 24\u00a0h and - in a subset of diabetic patients - at 3\u00a0months after PCI (EPC-substudies). The primary endpoint of the main REMEDY study is the rate of peri-procedural MI in each of the 4 treatment arms. Secondary endpoints are the combined occurrence of 1-month major adverse events (MACE, including death, MI, or the need for unplanned revascularization); and any post-procedural increase in serum creatinine. Endpoints of the EPC-substudies are the impact of tested regimens on 1) early (24-h) and 3-month EPC levels and functional activity; 2) stent strut re-endothelialization and neointimal hyperplasia; 3) 1-year MACE. REMEDY will add important information on the cardioprotective effects of statins after PCI."
