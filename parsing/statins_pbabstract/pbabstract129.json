    "0": "Our study investigated whether metformin has an impact on haemostasis in patients with pre-diabetes receiving statin therapy. The study included 41 simvastatin-treated patients with impaired fasting glucose who were randomized to either metformin (3 g daily) or placebo. The international normalized ratio, the partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, factor VII coagulant activity, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and von Willebrand factor were assessed on the day of randomization and after 90 days of treatment. Metformin treatment reduced plasma levels/activity of the assessed haemostatic risk factors, and this effect correlated with the improvement in insulin sensitivity. The obtained results indicate that high-dose metformin produces a multi-directional beneficial effect on coagulation and fibrinolysis in patients with impaired fasting glucose already receiving statin therapy. The effect of metformin on haemostasis may play a role in the prevention of atherosclerosis-related disorders and acute vascular events in this pre-diabetic state.", 
    "1": "Statin therapy may improve responsiveness to erythropoietin-stimulating agents in patients with end-stage renal disease. Although statins increase hepatic iron uptake and storage capacity in cholestatic rats, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Therefore, we examined the effects of a statin (simvastatin) on the expression of hepcidin, erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) and erythropoietin (EPO) in cultured HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells (6-6.5 \u00d7 10(5) cells) were seeded in 6-cm dishes and incubated overnight. The cells were then treated with 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, or 10 \u03bcM simvastatin, and the mRNA expression of hepcidin, EPOR, and EPO was determined. Data were collected from three independent experiments. The cDNA extracted from the cells was used as a template for real-time polymerase chain reaction, and each sample was tested in duplicate. Significant differences (P < 0.05) among groups were determined using one-way analysis of variance with Fisher's least significant difference post hoc test. Data were adjusted using Bonferroni's method. The relative mRNA expression of hepcidin in HepG2 cells treated with 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 10 \u03bcM simvastatin, relative to the control group, was 0.7273, 0.3303, 0.2418, 0.4131, and 0.4064, respectively. The relative mRNA expression of EPOR was 0.5196, 0.2319, 0.2398, 0.4253, and 0.1245, respectively, while that of EPO was 0.9751, 0.4712, 0.4613, 0.4875, and 0.1654. There was a reverse dose-dependent effect of simvastatin. These results suggest that statins increase erythropoiesis by targeting hepcidin and iron regulatory pathways, independent of erythropoietin.",

    "8": "Strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk in primary and secondary prevention focus on optimization of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Since the 2004 update of the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III guidelines, developments in the field of preventive cardiology have included new guidelines for women and for familial hypercholesterolemia; a risk assessment algorithm incorporating the inflammatory marker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP); and clinical trial data confirming the efficacy of aggressive lipid management. Within secondary prevention in particular, there is a need for more widespread use of intensive statin therapy to achieve low LDL cholesterol levels to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients at high risk for recurrent events. Within primary prevention, individuals with diabetes mellitus, mixed dyslipidemia, or elevated hsCRP also are at increased risk and may warrant treatment with aggressive lipid-modifying therapy. In this article, we provide an update on recent guidelines, risk algorithms, and trials related to the prevention and treatment of coronary artery disease.", 
    "9": "Results from multiple clinical trials, primarily with the class of lipid-lowering agents known as statins, have shown that reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol are associated with reduced risk of coronary artery disease. Although LDL cholesterol is the primary target of cholesterol management strategies, increasing attention has focused on the role of inflammation, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides in atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. We review major trials with lipid-modifying therapies published since the 2004 update of the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III guidelines. A pivotal trial was the Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER), which demonstrated significant reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in healthy individuals without elevated LDL cholesterol but with high levels of the inflammatory marker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Additional trials demonstrated the efficacy of intensive statin therapy in secondary prevention, whereas other agents, including fibrates, omega-3 fatty acids, niacin, ezetimibe, and experimental cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors, have been evaluated for their ability to reduce residual cardiovascular risk.", 
    "10": "Currently, there is no completely effective therapy available for metastatic phaeochromocytomas (PCCs) and paragangliomas. In this study, we explore new molecular targeted therapies for these tumours, using one more benign (mouse phaeochromocytoma cell (MPC)) and one more malignant (mouse tumour tissue (MTT)) mouse PCC cell line - both generated from heterozygous neurofibromin 1 knockout mice. Several PCC-promoting gene mutations have been associated with aberrant activation of PI3K/AKT, mTORC1 and RAS/RAF/ERK signalling. We therefore investigated different agents that interfere specifically with these pathways, including antagonism of the IGF1 receptor by NVP-AEW541. We found that NVP-AEW541 significantly reduced MPC and MTT cell viability at relatively high doses but led to a compensatory up-regulation of ERK and mTORC1 signalling at suboptimal doses while PI3K/AKT inhibition remained stable. We subsequently investigated the effect of the dual PI3K/mTORC1/2 inhibitor NVP-BEZ235, which led to a significant decrease of MPC and MTT cell viability at doses below 50\u200anM but again increased ERK signalling. Accordingly, we next examined the combination of NVP-BEZ235 with the established agent lovastatin, as this has been described to inhibit ERK signalling. Lovastatin alone significantly reduced MPC and MTT cell viability at therapeutically relevant doses and inhibited both ERK and AKT signalling, but increased mTORC1/p70S6K signalling. Combination treatment with NVP-BEZ235 and lovastatin showed a significant additive effect in MPC and MTT cells and resulted in inhibition of both AKT and mTORC1/p70S6K signalling without ERK up-regulation. Simultaneous inhibition of PI3K/AKT, mTORC1/2 and ERK signalling suggests a novel therapeutic approach for malignant PCCs.", 
    "11": "We have developed a simple, precise, and ultrasensitive enzymatic method for measuring serum mevalonic acid (MVA) concentration, which is thought to be a good indicator of the in vivo cholesterol biosynthesis rate. This assay is based on an enzyme cycling reaction and makes use of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR), thio-NAD, NADH, and CoA. MVA participates in the HMGR cycling reaction, and its level is measured based on the production of thio-NADH, which is determined from the change in absorbance at 405 nm. To achieve high specificity, we used mevalonate kinase (MVK) in addition to HMGR. Only substrates able to participate in both the HMGR cycling reaction and the MVK reaction are measured as MVA. The detection limit for MVA is 0.4 ng/ml (2.7 nmol/l), and the calibration curve for MVA is linear up to 44 ng/ml (300 nmol/l). Regression analysis with 40 serum samples showed the accuracy of quantifying MVA with this enzymatic assay to be comparable to that using LC-MS/MS (correlation: y = 0.83x + 0.24; r = 0.97). This procedure is simple, precise, and robust. It is also rapid and has a high throughput, making it potentially useful for clinical applications.", 
    "12": "Lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a cornerstone for the prevention of atherosclerotic heart disease, improving clinical outcomes and reducing vascular mortality in patients with hypercholesterolemia. The clinical benefits of LDL-C reduction appear to extend even to patients starting with LDL-C as low as 60-80 mg/dL prior to initiating therapy. Statins are the first-line agents for treating hypercholesterolemia and are effective in reducing LDL-C, but many patients are unable to achieve their optimal lipid targets despite intensive statin therapy. Therefore, there has been a strong impetus for the development of novel pharmacologic agents designed to lower LDL-C further in patients already on statin therapy. Genetic mutations resulting in altered cholesterol homeostasis provide valuable information regarding novel approaches for treating hypercholesterolemia. To that end, mutations in proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) were linked to altered levels of LDL-C, illustrating this protein's role in lipid metabolism. PCSK9 promotes degradation of the LDL receptor, preventing its transport back to the cell surface and thereby increasing circulating LDL-C. Conversely, inhibition of PCSK9 can profoundly decrease circulating LDL-C, and thus is an attractive new target for LDL-C-lowering therapy. AMG 145 is a fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin G2 antibody that binds specifically to human PCSK9 and inhibits its interaction with the low-density lipoprotein receptor. In this manuscript, we describe the rationale and design of LDL-C Assessment with PCSK9 Monoclonal Antibody Inhibition Combined With Statin Therapy-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 57 (LAPLACE-TIMI 57; NCT01380730), a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, dose-ranging, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of AMG 145 when added to statin therapy in patients with hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "13": "Acute lung injury (ALI) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Despite improved understanding of the pathogenesis of ALI, supportive care with a lung protective strategy of mechanical ventilation remains the only treatment with a proven survival advantage. Most clinical trials in ALI have targeted mechanically ventilated patients. Past trials of pharmacologic agents may have failed to demonstrate efficacy in part due to the resultant delay in initiation of therapy until several days after the onset of lung injury. Improved early identification of at-risk patients provides new opportunities for risk factor modification to prevent the development of ALI and novel patient groups to target for early treatment of ALI before progression to the need for mechanical ventilation. This review will discuss current strategies that target prevention of ALI and some of the most promising pharmacologic agents for early treatment of ALI prior to the onset of respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation.",

    "18": "Obesity is often associated with chronic inflammatory state which contributes to the development of insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study investigated the effects of single and combined administration of atorvastatin (ATOR, lipid-lowering drug) and losartan (LOS, angiotensin receptor antagonist) on metabolic disorders and inflammatory status that are implicated in the development of T2DM with the use of pioglitazone (PIO) as a standard antidiabetic drug. T2DM was induced in male rats by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding for 16 weeks. Oral administrations of ATOR (10 mg/kg), LOS (20 mg/kg), PIO (3 mg/kg), their binary combinations, or vehicle were started in the last 4 weeks. Fasting serum glucose, oral glucose tolerance, fasting serum insulin, IR, serum lipid profile, serum TNF-\u03b1 and body composition index were determined. Results showed that all drugs and their combinations had positive impact effect on all measured parameters, and better results were achieved from binary drug combinations than administration of each drug alone. Combination of PIO with either ATOR or LOS provided better improvements on T2DM-associated metabolic abnormalities and inflammatory status with respect to each drug alone. However, the most pronounced effects of drugs and their combinations regarding the above parameters were attributed to LOS + PIO combination. In conclusion, this study indicates that combination of ATOR + PIO and, in particular, LOS + PIO can be used as promising effective therapies in the management of HFD-induced T2DM. This concept may be attributed to the combined effects of the respective monotherapies to improve lipid profile, insulin sensitivity, and TNF-\u03b1 level.", 
    "19": "Liver is the main detoxifying organ and therefore the target of high concentrations of genotoxic compounds, such as environmental carcinogens and anticancer drugs. Here, we investigated the usefulness of lovastatin, which is nowadays widely used for lipid lowering purpose, as a hepatoprotective drug following the administration of the anthracycline derivative doxorubicin in vivo. To this end, BALB/c mice were exposed to either a single high dose or three consecutive low doses of doxorubicin. Acute and subacute hepatotoxicities were analyzed with or without lovastatin co-treatment. Lovastatin protected the liver against doxorubicin-induced acute pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic stress responses as indicated by an attenuated mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), respectively. Hepatoprotection by lovastatin was due to a reduced induction of DNA damage following doxorubicin treatment. The statin also mitigated subacute anthracycline-provoked hepatotoxicity as shown on the level of doxorubicin- and epirubicin-stimulated CTGF mRNA expression as well as histopathologically detectable fibrosis and serum concentration of marker enzymes of hepatotoxicity (GPT/GLDH). Kidney damage following doxorubicin exposure was not detectable under our experimental conditions.Moreover, lovastatin showed multiple inhibitory effects on doxorubicin-triggered hepatic expression of genes involved in oxidative stress response, drug transport, DNA repair, cell cycle progression and cell death. Doxorubicin also stimulated the formation of ceramides. Ceramide production, however, was not blocked by lovastatin, indicating that hepatoprotection by lovastatin is independent of the sphingolipid metabolism. Overall, the data show that lovastatin is hepatoprotective following genotoxic stress induced by anthracyclines. Based on the data, we hypothesize that statins might be suitable to lower hepatic injury following anthracycline-based anticancer therapy.",

Besides this usage, evidence is increasing that statins might also be useful in therapy of viral infections or cancer. We investigated the effects of fluva-, simva-, atorva-, rosuva- and lovastatin on the viability of primary mouse and human hepatocytes as well as mouse (Hepa1-6) and human (Huh7, HepG2) hepatoma cell lines. Our results show selective cytotoxic effects of fluva-, simva- and lovastatin on hepatoma cells in comparison to primary hepatocytes. Using human hepatoma cells we found significant reduction of cell viability and induction of apoptosis in HepG2 cells, while statins did not affect Huh7 cells at concentrations not toxic for primary hepatocytes. Stable knockdown of endogenous p53, which is overexpressed in Huh7 cells, was able to restore susceptibility of Huh7 cells towards statin-induced toxicity. The anti-tumor effect of statins did not depend on a lack of cholesterol production, but was restored by supplementation of mevalonate or geranyl-geranyl pyrophosphate, prerequisites for prenylation of small G proteins. In conclusion, statins display a selective apoptotic effect on human hepatoma cells, with fluva-, simva- and lovastatin being both, most selective for tumor cells and most effective in inducing tumor cell apoptosis. Additionally, our results implicate that anti-tumor activity of statins requires cell proliferation and is reduced by p53 overexpression.",

The study group included 44 patients with dyslipidemia and was divided into subgroups according to triglyceride and cholesterol levels as hypercholesterolemic (n\u00a0=\u00a029) and mixed-type hyperlipidemic (n\u00a0=\u00a015).

Changes in serum lipid composition, lipid contents, Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity and osmotic fragility in erythrocytes and oxidative stress parameters of erythrocytes and plasma were studied. Atorvastatin therapy improved the serum lipid profile of both subgroups. This alteration was accompanied by a decreased level of cholesterol in erythrocyte membranes. Moreover, enhanced activity of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase in erythrocytes reflected the improvements in membrane lipids of both subgroups. However, a significant change was observed in osmotic fragility values of the mixed-typed dyslipidemic group. This treatment lowered the lipid peroxidation in plasma and erythrocytes and increased plasma total antioxidant capacity in all groups. The present study shows that the use of atorvastatin reversed the structural and functional features of erythrocyte membranes in dyslipidemic subjects. Also, hypolipidemic therapy had a beneficial impact on a balance between oxidant and antioxidant systems.",

Here, we report the characterization of prelamin A post-translational modifications in MADA cells that induce alterations in the chromatin arrangement and dislocation of nuclear envelope-associated proteins involved in correct nucleo-cytoskeleton relationships. We show that protein post-translational modifications change depending on the passage number, suggesting the onset of a feedback mechanism. Moreover, we show that treatment of MADA cells with the farnesyltransferase inhibitors is effective in the recovery of the chromatin phenotype, altered in MADA, provided that the cells are at low passage number, while at high passage number, the treatment results ineffective. Moreover, the distribution of the lamin A interaction partner SUN2, a constituent of the nuclear envelope, is altered by MADA mutations, as argued by the formation of a highly disorganized lattice. Treatment with statins partially rescues proper SUN2 organization, indicating that its alteration is caused by farnesylated prelamin A accumulation. Given the major role of SUN1 and SUN2 in the nucleo-cytoskeleton interactions and in regulation of nuclear positioning in differentiating cells, we hypothesise that mechanisms regulating nuclear membrane-centrosome interplay and nuclear movement may be affected in MADA fibroblasts.", 
    "44": "Many clinical trials and data from scientific investigations have suggested the effects of statins on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism, besides their actions in reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. These actions have been proposed as important anti-atherogenic properties that contribute to the additional reduction of risk for cardiovascular diseases. The regulation of genes involved in the reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) is very complex and the modulation exerted by statin treatment is poorly understood. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying the modulation of genes controlling the RCT with special emphasis on the reported tissue-specific effects of statins. The statin modulation of genes participating in the different stages of RCT (cholesterol efflux from peripheral tissues, HDL metabolism in the plasma and internalization by the liver) has been summarized. Recent reports on novel mechanisms of regulation by microRNAs are also discussed.",

For pharmacological experiments, inhibitors were added 30 min prior to addition of atorvastatin. Control cultures received a similar amount of DMSO. Following the treatment period, phase-contrast digital images were taken. Digital images of neurons were analyzed for total neurite branch length (TNBL), neurite number, terminal branch number, and soma area by SPOT Advanced Imaging software. After incubation with atorvastatin for 48 h, the levels of phosphorylated 3-phosphoinoside-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1), phospho-Akt, phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), phosphorylated 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), p70S6 kinase (p70S6K), and glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) in the cortical neurons were evaluated using Western blotting analyses.",

Atorvastatin (10 \u03bcmol/L) significantly increased the levels of phosphorylated PDK1, Akt and mTOR in the cortical neurons, which were prevented by LY294002 (30 \u03bcmol/L). Moreover, atorvastatin (10 \u03bcmol/L) stimulated the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and p70S6K, the substrates of mTOR, in the cortical neurons.

Oxidative stress generated and aggravated by prolonged hyperglycemia may interfere with and destroy the newly formed blood vessels. Angiogenic effect of simvastatin has been reported; however, its exact mechanism is yet to be evaluated. In addition, the exact role of antioxidant vitamins in diabetic peripheral arterial disease is still controversial. The present study was undertaken to investigate the therapeutic potential of simvastatin and antioxidant vitamins (E and C) and their combined effects on angiogenesis in diabetic hind-limb ischemia. Streptozotocin diabetic rats were treated for 6 weeks with simvastatin either alone or in combination with vitamin E or vitamin C. Parameters of angiogenesis, nitric oxide, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and oxidative stress markers were evaluated. CD31 immunostaining revealed an increased capillary density in ischemic gastrocnemious tissue of diabetic rats treated with either simvastatin or its combination with vitamin C. This effect was accompanied by up-regulated plasma levels of HO-1, nitric oxide, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its intra-muscular receptor type-2 (Flk-1). Tissue reduced glutathione and antioxidant enzymes activities were normalized in groups treated with antioxidant vitamins or their combination with simvastatin with concomitant blunting of lipid peroxidation. Vitamins E and C, through their antioxidant effects, evidently enhanced the angiogenic effect of simvastatin in ischemic diabetic muscle. Hence, the use of antioxidant vitamins combined with statins to induce therapeutic angiogenesis is a promising strategy in the management of diabetes-associated peripheral arterial disease.",

Both atorvastatin calcium (lipitor) as well as flavonoid rich fruit such as tart cherry demonstrate potent anti-inflammatory effects on IL-6 secretion. In this study, we investigated whether tart cherry extract or specific anthocyanins contained in the tart cherry show synergistic anti-inflammatory effects with lipitor. Results showed that LPS-induced adipose stem cell secretion of IL-6 reduced with the addition of tart cherry extract, a mixture of tart cherry anthocyanins, and pure tart cherry cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, lipitor and C3G exhibited synergistic effects in reducing LPS-induced IL-6 secretion from adipose stem cells.

Mutations of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene, the apolipoprotein B100 gene, or the PCSK9 gene may be responsible for the disease. The resulting LDL hypercholesterolemia results in premature atherosclerosis as early as childhood (homozygous FH) or in adulthood (heterozygous FH). Current treatment modalities include lifestyle modification, combination drug therapy (statin-based), and apheresis. Mipomersen is an antisense oligonucleotide which inhibits apolipoprotein B production independent of LDL receptor function and thus works in homozygous FH, heterozygous FH, and other forms of hypercholesterolemia. Mipomersen is given 200 mg/week subcutaneously. Phase III studies indicate that the LDL cholesterol concentration can be reduced by 25%-47%, lipoprotein(a) levels by 20%-40%, and triglyceride concentrations by approximately 10%. In general, mipomersen has no effect on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. Although there is considerable interindividual variability, the observed lipid effects are largely independent of age, gender, concomitant statin therapy, and underlying dyslipoproteinemia. The most common side effects are injection site reactions (70%-100%), flu-like symptoms (29%-46%), and elevated transaminases associated with an increased liver fat content (6%-15%).

The resultant pro-oxidant status imposed on the periodontium, exacerbated by episodic hyperinflammatory damage contributes to progression of periodontitis and tooth loss in susceptible subjects. Increasing documentation of bi-directional connections between periodontal and cardiometabolic disorders makes it an intriguing area of therapeutic intervention for mutual benefit. Periodontitis and associated comorbidities demonstrate similar risk markers of inflammation during disease progression. Depending on the extent and severity of the inflammatory response, periodontitis could impact significantly on systemic inflammatory loading and influence the progression of endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerotic plaque instability, dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance. Some of the common mechanisms involved are discussed, relevant to periodontal and cardiometabolic disorders which have been documented as having a bidirectional relationship with periodontal disease progression; abating in response to treatment. Periodontal disease may be a useful marker of a susceptible immune system, or directly affect the progression of systemic diseases due to inflammatory loading. These mechanisms mediated by coordinated actions of cytokines, acute phase proteins, enzymes and their sequelae are addressed in the context of conventional periodontal therapy and its outcome with a modulatory role on metabolic diseases. Applications for the role of nutritional and therapeutic antioxidants as adjuncts in diseases with a distinctly prooxidant profile are discussed.

All microspheres demonstrated acceptable biocompatibility in vivo, with increased proliferation, reduced apoptosis, and reduced inflammation while PDGF or simvastatin was encapsulated. The PS design significantly reduced apoptosis than control, whereby significant and persistent enhanced proliferation was noted in SP group. The thickness of fibrotic capsules surrounding microspheres significantly reduced in both SP and PS group at day 14.

In the present study, we used NIH 3T3 cells which express HO-1 to investigate the molecular mechanisms of HO-1 induction by statins. Simvastatin or fluvastatin induced a significant increase in HO-1 protein expression and mRNA levels. Both statins stimulated activity of a mouse HO-1 promoter (-1,287 to +73\u2009bp)/luciferase reporter gene, 3.25\u2009\u00b1\u20090.23 (Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.E.M., n\u2009=\u200915, P\u2009<\u20090.001, t-test) and 3.13\u2009\u00b1\u20090.33 (Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.E.M., n\u2009=\u20096, P\u2009<\u20090.001, t-test), respectively.

Genome-wide association studies have identified the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4149056 in the SLCO1B1 gene as being associated with an increased risk for statin-induced ADRs. By studying slow-channel syndrome transgenic mouse models, we determined that statins trigger ADRs in mice expressing the mutant allele of the rs137852808 SNP in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) \u03b1-subunit gene CHRNA1.

Here, we evaluated whether caveolin-1 associated with eNOS/Hsp70 expression may be involved in the mechanism by which rosuvastatin exerts tubulointerstitial fibrosis protection in neonatal unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). Neonatal rats subjected to UUO within 2 days of birth and controls were treated daily with vehicle or rosuvastatin (10 mg/kg/day) by oral gavage for 14 days. After UUO, morphometric evaluation of interstitial fibrosis showed increased interstitial volume (Vv) associated with reduced NO availability, increased mRNA and protein caveolin-1 expression as well as downregulation eNOS and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) expression. Conversely, rosuvastatin treatment attenuated the fibrotic response linked to high NO availability, decreased mRNA and protein caveolin-1 expression, and marked upregulation of eNOS and Hsp70 expression at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Moreover, protein-protein interactions determined by immunoprecipitation and by immunofluorescence co-localization have shown decreased caveolin-1/eNOS as well as increased Hsp70/eNOS interaction, after rosuvastatin treatment. A dose dependent effect of rosuvastatin on decreased caveolin-1 expression was shown in control cortex.

In particular, simvastatin induces the upregulation of integrin-\u03b24, which in turn inhibits EC inflammatory responses via attenuation of MAPK signaling. The role of integrin-\u03b24 in murine ALI protection by simvastatin, however, is unknown. We initially confirmed a time- and dose-dependent effect of simvastatin on increased integrin-\u03b24 mRNA expression in human lung EC with peak protein expression evident at 16 h. Subsequently, reciprocal immunoprecipitation demonstrated an attenuation of LPS-induced integrin-\u03b24 tyrosine phosphorylation by simvastatin (5 \u03bcM, 16 h). Increased expression of EC inflammatory cytokines [IL-6, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES)] by LPS (500 ng/ml, 4 h) was also significantly attenuated by simvastatin pretreatment (5 \u03bcM, 16 h), but this effect was reversed by cotreatment with an integrin-\u03b24-blocking antibody. Finally, although simvastatin (20 mg/kg) conferred significant protection in murine ALI as evidenced by decreased bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cell counts, protein, inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, MCP-1, RANTES), decreased Evans blue dye albumin extravasation in lung tissue, and changes on lung histology, these effects were reversed by the integrin-\u03b24-blocking antibody (IV, 1 mg/kg, 2 h before LPS). These findings support integrin-\u03b24 as an important mediator of ALI protection by simvastatin and implicate signaling by integrin-\u03b24 as a novel therapeutic target in patients with ALI.", 
    "169": "This study investigated the therapeutic effects of simvastatin administered by subarachnoid injection after spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats; explored the underlying mechanism from the perspective of mobilization, migration and homing of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) to the injured area induced by simvastatin. Green fluorescence protein labeled-bone marrow stromal cells (GFP-BMSCs) were transplanted into rats through the tail vein for stem cell tracing. Twenty-four hours after transplantation, spinal cord injury (SCI) was produced using weight-drop method (10g 4cm) at the T10 level. Simvastatin (5mg/kg) or vehicle was administered by subarachnoid injection at lumbar level 4 after SCI. Locomotor functional recovery was assessed in the 4 weeks following surgery using the open-field test and inclined-plane test. At the end of the study, MRI was used to evaluate the reparation of the injured spinal cord. Animals were then euthanized, histological evaluation was used to measure lesion cavity volumes. Immunofluorescence for GFP and cell lineage markers (NeuN and GFAP) was used to evaluate simvastatin-mediated mobilization and differentiation of transplanted BMSCs. Western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to assess the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Simvastatin-treated animals showed significantly better locomotor recovery, less signal abnormality in MRI and a smaller cavity volume compared to the control group. Immunofluorescence revealed that simvastatin increased the number of GFP-positive cells in the injured spinal cord, and the number of cells double positive for GFP/NeuN or GFP/GFAP was larger in the simvastatin treated group than the control group. Western blot and immunohistochemistry showed higher expression of BDNF and VEGF in the simvastatin treated group than the control group. In conclusion, simvastatin can help to repair spinal cord injury in rat, where the underlying mechanism appears to involve the mobilization of bone marrow stromal cells to the injured area and higher expression of BNDF and VEGF.",

    "173": "FDA drug safety communications for 4 drugs were chosen because of the potential clinical importance in older adults. A warning for citalopram was made because of potential problems with QT prolongation in patients taking less than 40 mg per day. The evidence suggests minor changes in QT interval. Given the flat dose-response curve in treating depression with citalopram, the new 20-mg/d maximum dose in older adults is sensible. Another warning was made for proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and an increased risk of Clostridium difficile infection. A dose-response relationship was found for this drug risk. With C. difficile infections on the rise in older adults, along with other safety risks of PPI therapy, PPIs should only be used in older adults indicated for therapy for the shortest duration possible. In addition, a warning about dabigatran was made. There is strong evidence from a large clinical trial, as well as case reports, of increased bleeding risk in older adults taking dabigatran, especially in older adults with decreased renal function. This medication should be used with caution in older adults. Finally, several warnings were made about statins. Routine periodic monitoring of liver enzymes does not appear to be effective in detecting or preventing serious liver injury from statin use; thus, liver enzymes are no longer recommended to be routinely monitored. Statin-induced cognitive changes are rare, and insufficient evidence is currently available to establish causality. Statins appear to moderately increase the risk of developing diabetes (versus placebo), and regular screening for diabetes should be considered, especially for patients taking high-dose statins and patients with multiple risk factors for diabetes.",

Population-based studies have suggested a positive role of statins in reducing depression risk. This study aimed at investigating the atorvastatin effect in the tail suspension test (TST) and in the forced swimming test (FST). The participation of NMDA receptors and L-arginine-NO-cGMP in an atorvastatin antidepressant-like effect in the TST was evaluated. Acute atorvastatin administration (0.1-30 mg/kg) reduced the immobility time both in TST and FST. A similar effect was observed by using imipramine as a positive control in the TST and FST (1 and 0.1-1 mg/kg, p.o., respectively). An atorvastatin (0.1 mg/kg) antidepressant-like effect was prevented by the pretreatment of mice with NMDA (0.1 pmol/site, i.c.v.), L-arginine (750 mg/kg, i.p.) or sildenafil (5 mg/kg, i.p.). The administration of MK-801 (0.001 mg/kg, i.p.), ketamine (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.), 7-nitroindazole (50 mg/kg, i.p.), methylene blue (20 mg/kg, i.p.), or ODQ (30 pmol/site i.c.v.) in combination with a subeffective dose of atorvastatin (0.01 mg/kg, p.o.) reduced the immobility time in the TST compared to drugs alone, showing the participation of the pathway L-arginine-NO-cGMP. The administration of drugs did not produce any significant alteration in locomotor activity in the open-field test. Acute atorvastatin treatment (0.1-10.0 mg/kg, v.o.) increased the hippocampal BDNF levels, which is an effect that has not been observed in imipramine-treated mice.

Leukostasis in vivo and ex vivo in retinal capillaries was increased after 2 weeks of diabetes (Hb A(1c), 14.2 \u00b1 1.2) when either donor or recipient mice were diabetic. Maximum leukostasis occurred when both donor and recipient were diabetic. CD11b(+), but not Gr1(+), cells were preferentially entrapped in retinal vessels (fivefold increase compared with nondiabetic mice). In diabetic mice, circulating CD11b(+) cells expressed high levels of CCR5 (P = 0.04), whereas spleen (P = 0.0001) and retinal (P = 0.05) cells expressed increased levels of the fractalkine chemokine receptor. Rosuvastatin treatment prevented leukostasis when both recipient and donor were treated but not when donor mice only were treated. This effect was blocked by treatment with mevalonate. We conclude that leukostasis in early diabetic retinopathy involves activated CCR5(+)CD11b(+) myeloid cells (presumed monocytes). However, leukostasis also requires diabetes-induced changes in the endothelium, because statin therapy prevented leukostasis only when recipient mice were treated. The up-regulation of the HMG-CoA reductase pathway in the endothelium is the major metabolic dysregulation promoting leukostasis.",

In this study, we used dengue virus (DENV) to study the role of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and sterol-regulatory-element-binding-protein-2 (SREBP-2) pathway in the rearrangement and expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) early after infection. Using laser scanning confocal and differential interference contrast microscopy, we demonstrate that rearrangement and expansion of the ER occurs early after DENV-2 infection. Through the use of mouse embryonic fibroblast cells deficient in XBP1 and ATF6, we show that ER rearrangement early after DENV infection is independent of the UPR. We then demonstrate that enlargement of the ER is independent of the SREBP-2 activation and upregulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme-A reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. We further show that this ER rearrangement is not inhibited by the treatment of DENV-infected cells with the cholesterol-inhibiting drug lovastatin. Using the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D and the translation elongation inhibitor cycloheximide, we show that de novo viral protein synthesis but not host transcription is necessary for expansion and rearrangement of the ER. Lastly, we demonstrate that viral infection induces the reabsorption of lipid droplets into the ER. Together, these results demonstrate that modulation of intracellular membrane architecture of the cell early after DENV-2 infection is driven by viral protein expression and does not require the induction of the UPR and SREBP-2 pathways. This work paves the way for further study of virally-induced membrane rearrangements and formation of cubic membranes.", 
    "211": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease, is a spirochetal pathogen with limited metabolic capabilities that survives under highly disparate host-specific conditions. However, the borrelial genome encodes several proteins of the mevalonate pathway (MP) that utilizes acetyl-CoA as a substrate leading to intermediate metabolites critical for biogenesis of peptidoglycan and post-translational modifications of proteins. In this study, we analyzed the MP and contributions of acetate in modulation of adaptive responses in B. burgdorferi. Reverse-transcription PCR revealed that components of the MP are transcribed as individual open reading frames. Immunoblot analysis using monospecific sera confirmed synthesis of members of the MP in B. burgdorferi. The rate-limiting step of the MP is mediated by HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR) via conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate. Recombinant borrelial HMGR exhibited a K(m) value of 132 \u00b5M with a V(max) of 1.94 \u00b5mol NADPH oxidized minute(-1) (mg protein)(-1) and was inhibited by statins. Total protein lysates from two different infectious, clonal isolates of B. burgdorferi grown under conditions that mimicked fed-ticks (pH 6.8/37\u00b0C) exhibited increased levels of HMGR while other members of the MP were elevated under unfed-tick (pH 7.6/23\u00b0C) conditions. Increased extra-cellular acetate gave rise to elevated levels of MP proteins along with RpoS, CsrA(Bb) and their respective regulons responsible for mediating vertebrate host-specific adaptation. Both lactone and acid forms of two different statins inhibited growth of B. burgdorferi strain B31, while overexpression of HMGR was able to partially overcome that inhibition. In summary, these studies on MP and contributions of acetate to host-specific adaptation have helped identify potential metabolic targets that can be manipulated to reduce the incidence of Lyme disease.",

In this evidence-based rebuttal to those claims, we review the evidence supporting the efficacy of statin therapy in primary prevention. Cardiovascular risk is a continuum in which those at an elevated risk of events stand to benefit from early initiation of therapy. Statins should not be reserved until after a patient suffers the catastrophic consequences of atherosclerosis. Contrary to the assertions of the statin opponent, this principle has been demonstrated through reductions in heart attacks, strokes, and mortality in numerous randomized controlled primary-prevention statin trials. Furthermore, data show that once a patient tolerates the initial treatment period, the few side effects that subsequently emerge are largely reversible. Accordingly, every major guidelines committee endorses statin use in secondary prevention and selectively in primary prevention for those with risk factors. The foundation for prevention remains increased physical activity, better dietary habits, and smoking cessation. However, prevention of heart attacks, strokes, and death from cardiovascular disease does not have to be all or none-all statin or all lifestyle. In selected at-risk individuals, the combination of pharmacotherapy and lifestyle changes is more effective than either alone. Future investigation in prevention should focus on improving our ability to identify these at-risk individuals.", 
    "213": "The aim was to investigate the local osteogenic effect of fluvastatin incorporated into a biodegradable gelatin-hydrogel (GH) scaffold. The GH scaffolds were prepared through crosslinking by ultraviolet irradiation followed by freeze-drying. Two circular defects were surgically created on fifteen-week-old male rats calvaria. All defects of each rat were randomly filled with two of three treatments, specifically: fluvastatin incorporated into a GH disk (Flu-GH), distilled water incorporated into a GH disk, and no treatment. New bone formation was quantitatively analyzed after 7, 14, and 28 days using a micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) system, and histologically observed. Evaluation by micro-CT revealed a significant difference in new bone formation among the three kinds of defect. A highly osteogenic effect was observed in the Flu-GH group. The results showed that the fluvastatin incorporated into a biodegradable GH scaffold promoted osteogenesis in rat calvarial bone, indicating its potential for bone regeneration.", 
    "214": "Combination therapies are gaining momentum over monotherapies in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). Suboptimal doses of atorvastatin and rapamycin prevented or reversed clinical and histologic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Secretion of proinflammatory Th1 and Th17 cytokines was reduced and Th2 and Treg cytokine secretion was increased in mice. Combination therapy promoted induction of Treg cells and attenuated the infiltration of inflammatory IL-17 cells in EAE. It appeared that rapamycin-reactivated ERK was blunted by addition of atorvastatin. Our results demonstrate that agents with different mechanisms of immune modulation can combine synergistically in treating CNS autoimmunity.", 
    "215": "1. Insulin resistance (IR) is crucially involved in the pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome (MS). The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of simvastatin on IR in rats with MS. 2. A rat model of MS was established and myocardial damage was examined by transmission electron microscopy. Twenty-two MS rats were divided into two groups of 11 rats each: (i) an MS group; and (ii) a simvastatin-treated MS. Ten Wistar rats were used as controls. The phosphorylation of myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT-1), insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and Akt were analysed by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. 3. Insulin resistance-induced MS was associated with a significant increase in Rho kinase (ROCK) activity and inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt pathway. Decreased levels of phosphorylated (p-) MYPT-1 and p-IRS-1 (Ser\u00b3\u2070\u2077) and increased levels of p-Akt were found in hearts from the MS + simvastatin compared with the MS group. These results suggest that simvastatin reduces ROCK activity and increases Akt activity. 4. Simvastatin exerts cardioprotective effects and improves IR, which can be attributed, at least in part, to the inhibition of ROCK and activation of PI3-K/Akt.", 
    "216": "Today, hematology is dependent on molecular biology for diagnosis, establishing the prognosis and treatment guidance in more and more diseases. One useful technique in this respect is the gene expression profiling, whose use is not yet a matter of routine. The discovery that the expression of LDL-receptor and cholesterol synthesis is increased in the cells of some leukemias and lymphomas and that some statins induced DNA damages and increased the level of reactive oxygen species, opens the possibility of using statins in the treatment of certain malignant hemopathies. Patents regarding their association with dipyridamole, retinoids, tipifarnib, cytostatics or chemotherapy programs contribute to increasing their effectiveness. Statins can increase the apoptosis of malignant cells and restore the chemosensitivity in patients with different malignant hemopathies. Techniques of molecular biology are useful for identifying patients who have indication for statins. The main adverse effects of statins are increased transaminase levels and myopathy. The last may be anticipated and treated today.", 
    "217": "Elimination of key risk factors such as dyslipidemia and hypertension is important for reducing cardiovascular events later in life. A medical history, physical examination, and laboratory determination of lipid and glycosylated hemoglobin levels provide a good assessment of cardiovascular risk. A statin is first-line therapy for reducing LDL-C, which is the primary lipid target in most patients. High-dose statin therapy may be required to reach desired target levels. The choice of initial antihypertensive therapy is based on patient comorbidities and drug side effects; however, most patients require combination antihypertensive therapy to reach goal. The combination of this multifactorial risk approach along with smoking cessation and modification of other risk factors should complement current and future cardiovascular care for men.", 
    "218": "The aim of this study was to investigate the risk factors for access site-related complications after transradial coronary angiography (CAG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Transradial PCI has been shown to reduce access site-related bleeding complications compared with procedures performed through a femoral approach. Although previous studies focused on risk factors for access site-related complications after a transfemoral approach or transfemoral and transradial approaches, it is uncertain which factors affect vascular complications after transradial catheterization. We enrolled 500 consecutive patients who underwent transradial CAG or PCI. We determined the incidence and risk factors for access site-related complications such as radial artery occlusion and bleeding complications. Age, sheath size, the dose of heparin and the frequency of PCI (vs. CAG) were significantly greater in patients with than without bleeding complications. However, body mass index (BMI) was significantly lower in patients with than without bleeding complications. Sheath size was significantly higher and the frequency of statin use was significantly lower in patients with than without radial artery occlusion. Multiple logistic analysis revealed that sheath size [odds ratio (OR) 5.5; P < 0.05] and BMI (OR 0.86; P < 0.01) were risk factors for bleeding complications; and sheath size (OR 5.2; P < 0.05) and the lack of statin pretreatment (OR 0.50; P < 0.05) were risk factors for occlusive complications. In conclusion, these findings indicate that down-sizing of the devices used in transradial procedures might attenuate access site-related complications after transradial CAG or PCI. Statin pretreatment might also be a strategy that could prevent radial artery occlusion after transradial procedures.", 
    "219": "Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is quite common genetic disorder resulting in high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, but homozygous FH is rare. The authors describe a Moroccan family where a 24-year-old man and his 13-year-old brother, born from a consanguineous union, showed characteristics of FH with large tendon, tuberous and planar xanthomas. They had already five deaths in the sibship before the age of 15 years. Blood analysis found high LDL cholesterol levels. Arterial assessment showed diffuse atherosis. Genetic study found that patients are homozygous for the mutation of G266C LDL receptor. Treatment with high doses of statins and ezetimibe was introduced reducing cholesterol up to 70%. Large xanthomas were removed surgically. The G266C mutation has been previously identified in Morocco. Early identification and adequate treatment of individuals with hypercholesterolaemia and their relatives are essential for prevention of early death in these populations."
