We investigated the effect of pravastatin on Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis in mice. Mice with or without H. pylori infection received intraperitoneal pravastatin daily for 1 week. Expression of eNOS mRNA and tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA and myeloperoxidase activity in gastric tissue was determined. Myeloperoxidase activity was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by pravastatin, with activity inhibited by 53.5 and 73.7% at doses of 0.3 and 1 mg/kg, respectively. At a dose of 1 mg/kg, pravastatin reduced the level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA by 52.7%, while it did not affect eNOS expression. Pravastatin had no effects on these inflammatory parameters in uninfected mice. Pravastatin did not affect the viability of H. pylori. In conclusion, pravastatin exerts an anti-inflammatory effect on H. pylori-induced gastritis in mice without affecting eNOS expression.",

Guidelines for the treatment of lipid disorders were revised to indicate that an LDL-C treatment goal of 70 mg/dl was optional (NCEP ATPIII). In these same guidelines, low levels of HDL-C are also suggested but not specifically proscribed as a target of therapy. Recently ARBITER 2 (Arterial Biology for the Investigation of the Treatment Effects of Reducing Cholesterol 2) has provided the first evidence of the potential of raising HDL-C with extended release niacin when added to statin monotherapy in secondary prevention. However, whether this approach would be superior to a strategy in which lower concentrations of LDL-C are targeted is unknown.",

Linear mixed models assessed changes in lipids and CRP, comparing pravastatin subjects to controls. After 1 month of pravastatin 10 mg a day, total cholesterol decreased by 16% (+/-12.1%) and LDL by 24% (+/-17%), compared with 1.8% (+/-7.5%) and 2.6% (+/-8.6%) decreases in controls (P < 0.001). CRP did not decline. Glucocorticoids appeared to decrease pravastatin effectiveness. Serum CPK increased in one subject. Pravastatin reduced LDL and total cholesterol levels approximately the same degree observed in normal individuals, but the effect appeared blunted in those on modest doses of glucocorticoids and those with higher BMI.",

    "9": "To elucidate mechanisms by which left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LVH) increases the risk of atherosclerotic heart disease, we sought to determine whether LVH is independently associated with coronary artery calcium (CAC) and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the general population. The Dallas Heart Study is a population-based sample in which 2633 individuals underwent cardiac MRI to measure LV structure, electron beam CT to measure CAC, and measurement of plasma CRP. We used univariate and multivariable analyses to determine whether LV mass and markers of concentric LV hypertrophy or dilation were associated with CAC and CRP. Increasing quartiles of LV mass indexed to fat-free mass, LV wall thickness, and concentricity, but not LV volume, were associated with CAC in both men and women (P<0.001). After adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors and statin use, LV wall thickness and concentricity remained associated with CAC in linear regression (P<0.001 for each). These associations were particularly robust in blacks. LV wall thickness and concentricity were also associated with elevated CRP levels (P=0.001 for both) in gender-stratified univariate analyses, although these associations did not persist in multivariable analysis. In conclusion, concentric LVH is an independent risk factor for subclinical atherosclerosis. LVH is also associated with an inflammatory state as reflected in elevated CRP levels, although this relationship appears to be mediated by comorbid conditions. These data likely explain in part why individuals with LVH are at increased risk for myocardial infarction.", 
    "10": "Lowering lipid levels in the cardiovascular prevention we confine ourselves to measure the cholesterol level and care less for the background effects. Namely blood cholesterol level beyond the amount consumed with the diet highly depends on balance of intestinal absorption/secretion and synthesis. Studying the rate of absorption and synthesis has come only recently into the foreground of interest. Many observations proved that using even the strongest cholesterol lowering drug - beyond reducing the synthesis in the liver - may be associated with an up to 50 percent increase of the intestinal cholesterol absorption. When studying the effectiveness of statins in everyday practice we measure only the decrease of serum cholesterol level as the final result, and do not examine the changes in the synthesis and absorption. The amount of cholesterol synthesized or absorbed can be determined in an indirect way by measuring that of the non-cholesterol sterols (phytosterols). The absorption markers are campesterol, sitosterol, avenasterol as well as cholestanol. The biosynthesis of cholesterol correlates with the level of lathosterol, cholestanol, desmostenol. In practice the concentration of lathosterol or lathosterol/cholesterol can be considered the marker of synthesis and the campesterol or campesterol/cholesterol ratio the marker of absorption. So recent study results show that while inhibiting the cholesterol synthesis with statin the cholesterol absorption increases and the absorption inhibitor ezetimibe is associated with boost of synthesis. The increase in absorption caused by statins can be reduced or prevented by combining with ezetimibe. These data confirm that combination of statin and ezetimibe, inhibiting simultaneously both the synthesis and absorption provides the most effective cholesterol-level lowering with the least side-effects.", 
    "11": "Despite all the progress made in diagnosis and treatment, cardiovascular diseases remain the no. 1 cause of death worldwide. In 2005, 27.9% of males and 24.1% of females (eight times more than for mammary carcinoma) in Germany died of coronary artery disease (CAD). Although mortality rates following acute myocardial infarction have considerably dropped, morbidity has increased--people are getting older, but they are getting older sick. The resulting need for reduction of CAD morbidity can only be achieved by truly early detection of patients at high coronary risk before occurrence of a coronary event. Modern imaging techniques like cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) and cardiac computed tomography (CT) are being increasingly utilized. The goal of this review is the practical application of evidence-based recommendations by relevantly and cost-effectively implementing cardiac MR and cardiac CT with special attention to current national and international guidelines and recommendations.", 
    "12": "The primary objective here is to ascertain if the described symptoms can be attributed to a stenosing CAD with inducible myocardial ischemia or if they are effected by extracardial sources. As always, patients' history, examination findings and the stress ECG play the major roles. The conventional approach prescribes that an abnormal resting ECG compromising the interpretation of a stress ECG, should immediately be followed by an imaging ischemia diagnosis technique, like stress echocardiography, myocardial scintigraphy or cardiac MR (recommendation I B). This also holds true when a stress ECG is assessable and the probability of a stenosing CAD is between 10% and 90% (recommendation I B or \"appropriate\"). Alternatively, \"modern\" procedures allow imaging ischemia diagnosis to be replaced by noninvasive coronary angiography using a CTA (recommendation IIa B). If the image quality by CTA is assessable (free of artifacts and no disruptive calcified plaques) and no coronary stenosis can be found, the coronary diagnosis process may at this point be terminated, avoiding superfluous cardiac catheterizations. If the CTA shows the possibility of a higher-grade coronary stenosis, a cardiac catheterization examination with stand-by PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) can be performed.", 
    "13": "The prim ary objective in cardiovascular primary prevention is the avoidance of a first myocardial infarction and/or a first stroke. Current guidelines for prevention of cardiovascular diseases recommend administration of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and a statin when risk>20%/10 years (recommendation I A). The coronary calcium score has a strong predictive power which is independent of conventional risk factors and thus offers the most relevant information in addition to Framingham, PROCAM or ESC scores regarding coronary risk. For patients initially showing \"intermediate\" coronary risk (10-20%), guidelines suggest the determination of the coronary calcium score, which leads to better risk assessment and to identification of patients needing more aggressive lipid lowering (recommendation IIb B). Thus, the cardiac CT, on the one hand, aims the intense risk reduction needed in primary prevention to the high-risk patients, on the other hand, it avoids \"superfluous\" cardiac catheterizations, unnecessary statin therapies and potentially harmful ASA administrations. However, the proof of coronary calcium must not be confused with the presence of coronary artery stenoses: a positive calcium score in an asymptomatic person does not by itself indicate the need for a cardiac catheterization.", 
    "14": "Statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and combination therapies have been shown to reduce the cardiovascular event rate in susceptible individuals, albeit with remaining significant residual risk. Some of the sources of residual risk, such as genetics and epigenetic phenomena, are not easily modifiable. Still, the risk imposed by these factors may be lowered by implementation of dietary, behavioral, and pharmacologic interventions. Abdominal obesity has emerged as one element in the cluster of factors linked to increased propensity for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. It is a potential therapeutic target to reduce residual cardiometabolic risk. Waist circumference has been shown to be a strong correlate of abdominal obesity, and measurement is a useful tool for the assessment of cardiometabolic risk.", 
    "15": "Several lines of evidence suggest that the cholesterol content of neuronal membranes influences amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing; however, its role in transcriptional regulation of the cofactors for gamma-secretase, the key enzyme for the production of the Abeta peptide, is poorly understood. This study investigates whether the changes in cellular cholesterol metabolism modulate the expression of genes involved in the gamma-secretase complex function. The abundance of mRNA transcripts for presenilin 1 and 2 (PS1 and PS2), APP, and nicastrin were evaluated in neuroblastoma cells exposed either to serum-depleted medium or to low-density lipoproteins (LDL). Cholesterol esterification was markedly inhibited by mevinolin and U18666A, but was not significantly affected by any other of the tested treatments. gamma-Secretase genes and cofactors were not co-regulated and were not influenced by statin inhibition of cholesterol synthesis. Nicastrin and the APP isoforms showed constitutive expression. In the absence of exogenous lipids, cell PS1 and PS2 expression was induced by LDL and by lysosomal sequestration of cholesterol. However, a different pattern of induction of presenilin gene expression was observed in the latter condition, suggesting that lysosomal cholesterol levels are strong inducers of PS2 transcription. Taken together, these results indicate that lipid metabolism has a complex influence on gamma-secretase transcriptional pathways and, in particular, exogenous cholesterol and compartmentalization in neuroblastoma cells play a relevant role in regulating the transcription of presenilins, while modulation of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway seems to exert a minor influence on the expression of gamma-secretase genes and cofactors.",

We assessed the impact of gender on temporal differences in these parameters. In men, atorvastatin decreased total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and small, dense LDL-cholesterol concentrations, and increased FMD after 3 months. In women, atorvastatin decreased TBARS, triglyceride, and total, LDL, small, dense LDL, and remnant-like lipoprotein particle-cholesterol concentrations, and increased FMD after 3 months. Fibrinolytic parameters did not change significantly in either men or women. With respect to the percent change in those parameters after 3 months, TBARS (-17.6+/-12.4 vs. -0.4+/-18.8%, p<0.01) and small, dense LDL-cholesterol (-96.7+/-8.3 vs. -68.6+/-29.7%, p<0.01) decreased to a greater degree in women, although the relative changes in other parameters were similar between men and women.",

    "24": "The discovery of statins caused a revolution in the field of lipid intervention. Statins are drugs with a good safety profile. Their clinical benefit has been extensively documented in primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. There is substantial evidence that the clinical outcome can be improved with aggressive statin treatment both in patients with unstable as well as with stable coronary heart disease. Also, early administration of statins in acute coronary syndromes is accompanied by rapid clinical benefits, mainly through their \"pleiotropic\" action (anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, improvement of endothelial function, etc) which is probably a lipid-independent effect. Moreover, emerging data indicate that statins can achieve additional benefit when low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction is coupled with C-reactive protein reduction (<2 mg/L). The prevailing message from the recent statin trials is that intensive LDL cholesterol lowering treatment with statins achieves further clinical benefit beyond that achieved with standard statin therapy. This should encourage the medical community to consider prescribing statins in every coronary patient, aiming at LDL cholesterol levels <100 mg/dL, preferably in the range of 70-80 mg/dL in stable coronary patients, while in coronary patients at very high risk, the optional target for LDL cholesterol levels should be in the range of 50-70 mg/dL.",

Eighty-three patients (52 men and 31 women) with an acute coronary syndrome (75 with acute myocardial infarction and 8 with unstable angina) were included. After diagnosis, patients received atorvastatin as secondary prevention. Serum vitamin D was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography at baseline and at 12 months. Atorvastatin treatment produced a statistically significant decrease in cholesterol and triglyceride levels and an increase in vitamin D levels (41+/-19 vs 47+/-19 nmol/L, p=0.003). Vitamin D deficiency was decreased by 75% to 57% at 12 months. In conclusion, atorvastatin increases vitamin D levels.

Cholesterol-lowering agents are generally considered to be cost effective for the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. There is growing evidence, however, that the effectiveness of statins varies from one individual to another. The Taq1B polymorphism is an example of a genetic polymorphism that is thought to influence the effectiveness of statins. The aim of the current analysis is to estimate the cost-effectiveness of genetically screening coronary heart disease and stroke patients for the Taq1B polymorphism, and prescribing statin treatment to those with the B1B2 or B2B2 forms of the gene. A health sector perspective was adopted with a maximum acceptable cost-effectiveness ratio set at AUS$50,000/disability-adjusted life year. There is an 89% probability that screening and prescribing statins to those with the B1B2 and B2B2 alleles is more cost effective than prescribing statins to all patients.

    "49": "The diagnosis of drug-induced acute pancreatitis often is difficult to establish. Although some medications have been shown to cause acute pancreatitis with a large body of evidence, including rechallenge, some medications have been attributed as a cause of acute pancreatitis merely by a single published case report in which the investigators found no other cause. In addition, some medications reported to have caused acute pancreatitis have obvious patterns of presentation, including the time from initiation to the development of disease (latency). There also appear to be patterns in the severity of disease. After reviewing the literature, we have classified drugs that have been reported to cause acute pancreatitis based on the published weight of evidence for each agent and the pattern of clinical presentation. Based on our analysis of the level of evidence, 4 classes of drugs could be identified. Class I drugs include medications in which at least 1 case report described a recurrence of acute pancreatitis with a rechallenge with the drug. Class II drugs include drugs in which there is a consistent latency in 75% or more of the reported cases. Class III drugs include drugs that had 2 or more case reports published, but neither a rechallenge nor a consistent latency period. Class IV drugs were similar to class III drugs, but only 1 case report had been published. Our analysis allows an evidence-based approach when suspecting a drug as causing acute pancreatitis.",

All patients were given a clopidogrel 600-mg loading dose. All patients received long-term atorvastatin treatment thereafter (40 mg/day). The main end point of the trial was a 30-day incidence of major adverse cardiac events (death, myocardial infarction, or unplanned revascularization).", 
    "53": "The primary end point occurred in 5% of patients in the atorvastatin arm and in 17% of those in the placebo arm (p = 0.01); this difference was mostly driven by reduction of myocardial infarction incidence (5% vs. 15%; p = 0.04). Postprocedural elevation of creatine kinase-MB and troponin-I was also significantly lower in the atorvastatin group (7% vs. 27%, p = 0.001 and 41% vs. 58%, p = 0.039, respectively).

    "55": "Cholesterol biosynthesis is an integral part of HCV RNA replication. Not only does HCV RNA replicate on lipid rafts, but it also requires cholesterol intermediates to replicate. In addition, it has been shown in vitro that several HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can decrease HCV RNA replication by > or = 1 log. Therefore, we designed a clinical trial to evaluate the effect of atorvastatin on HCV RNA levels. In this prospective clinical trial, where patients served as their own control, 10 HCV-infected patients who required treatment for high cholesterol were given 20 mg atorvastatin per day. Although serum cholesterol and LDL predictably decreased significantly, there was no statistically significant change in week 4 and week 12 HCV RNA levels compared to pretreatment HCV RNA levels by the paired Student t test. It is unclear whether the addition of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor to interferon or a more potent inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis may be required to inhibit HCV RNA replication in vivo. In conclusion, atorvastatin, and likely all HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, does not inhibit HCV RNA replication in vivo at conventional doses.", 
    "56": "The objective of the study was to evaluate potential benefits of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) rich fish oil supplementation as an adjunct to statin therapy for hyperlipidaemia. A total of 45 hyperlipidaemic patients on stable statin therapy with persistent elevation of plasma triglycerides (averaging 2.2 mmol/L) were randomised to take 4 g/day (n = 15) or 8 g/day (n = 15) of tuna oil or olive oil (placebo, n = 15) for 6 months. Plasma lipids, blood pressure and arterial compliance were assessed initially and after 3 and 6 months in 40 subjects who completed the trial. Plasma triglycerides were reduced 27% by 8 g/day DHA-rich fish oil (P < 0.05) but not by 4 g/day when compared with the placebo and this reduction was achieved by 3 months and was sustained at 6 months. Even though total cholesterol was already well controlled by the statin treatment (mean initial level 4.5 mmol/L), there was a further dose-dependent reduction with fish oil supplementation (r = -0.344, P < 0.05). The extent of total cholesterol reduction correlated (r = -0.44) with the initial total cholesterol levels (P < 0.005). In the subset with initial plasma cholesterol above 3.8 mmol/L, plasma very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were isolated and assayed for cholesterol and apolipoprotein B (apoB) at the commencement of the trial and at 3 months of intervention. Fish oil tended to lower cholesterol and apoB in VLDL and raise both in LDL. There were no changes in IDL cholesterol, IDL apoB and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The results demonstrate that DHA-rich fish oil supplementation (2.16 g DHA/day) can improve plasma lipids in a dose-dependent manner in patients taking statins and these changes were achieved by 3 months. Fish oil in addition to statin therapy may be preferable to drug combinations for the treatment of combined hyperlipidaemia.",

The therapeutic strategies in the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage induced vasospasm vasospasm include four groups: 1) prevention of vasospasm; 2) reversion of vasospasm; 3) improvement of cerebral perfusion; and 4) neuroprotection and rescue therapies. Recent experimental studies allowed the design of phase II clinical studies which demonstrated positive results with medications and compounds such as statins (simvastatin and pravastatin) and endothelin-1 receptor antagonists (clasozentan). Moreover, experimental and clinical evidences showed the advantages of early cerebrospinal fluid drainage, intrathecal administration of NO-donors, effects of Ca2+ protein kinase inhibitor (Fasudil) and catecholamines on the cerebral vessels. This review article summarizes the stage of investigation of these medications and therapeutic strategies which will be relevant in the treatment of cerebral vasospasm.", 
    "59": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway that provides essential intermediates for the membrane anchorage and biologic functions of growth-related proteins. Contrary to preclinical studies showing the growth-suppressive activity of statins, competitive inhibitors of HMG CoA reductase, clinical application of statins in cancer is precluded by their lack of activity at levels prescribed for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and by their dose-limiting toxicities at high doses. The dysregulated and elevated HMG CoA reductase activity in tumors retains sensitivity to the isoprenoid-mediated posttranscriptional down-regulation, an action that complements the statin-mediated inhibition and may lead to synergistic impact of blends of isoprenoids and lovastatin on tumor HMG CoA reductase activity and consequently tumor growth. d-gamma- and d-delta-tocotrienols, vitamin E isomers containing an isoprenoid moiety, and lovastatin-induced concentration-dependent inhibition of the 48-hr proliferation of murine B16 melanoma cells with IC50 values of 20 +/- 3, 14 +/- 3, and 1.5 +/- 0.4 microM respectively. A blend of lovastatin (1 microM) and d-gamma-tocotrienol (5 microM) totally blocked cell growth, an impact far exceeding the sum of inhibitions induced by lovastatin (12%) and d-gamma-tocotrienol (8%) individually. Synergistic impact of these two agents was also shown in human DU145 prostate carcinoma and human A549 lung carcinoma cells. C57BL6 mice were fed diets supplemented with 12.5 mg lovastatin/kg body weight, 62.5 mg d-delta-tocotrienol/kg body weight, or a blend of both agents for 22 days following B16 cell implantation; only the latter had significantly lower tumor weight than those with no supplementation. Co-administration of isoprenoids that posttranscriptionally down-regulate tumor reductase may lower the effective dose of statins and offer a novel approach to cancer chemo-prevention and/or therapy.", 
    "60": "This report describes a newly identified potential of grapefruit juice (GFJ) in mediating pharmacokinetic drug interactions due to its capability to inhibit esterase. The study demonstrates that GFJ inhibits purified porcine esterase activity toward p-nitrophenyl acetate and the prodrugs lovastatin and enalapril. In rat and human hepatic or gut S9 fractions and rat gut lumen, GFJ inhibited the hydrolysis of enalapril and lovastatin, which are known to be metabolized principally by esterases, lovastatin being metabolized also by CYP3A. In Caco-2 cells, with minimal CYP3A activity, permeability of these prodrugs was increased in the presence of GFJ. In rats, oral coadministration of GFJ or an esterase inhibitor, bis-(p-nitrophenylphosphate), with the prodrugs led to respective increases in plasma area under the curve by 70% or 57% for enalaprilat and 279% or 141% for lovastatin acid. In addition, portal vein-cannulated rats pretreated with GFJ at -15 and -2 h before lovastatin administration (10 mg/kg p.o.) as a solution, 1) in water and 2) in GFJ, showed, respectively, a 49% increase (CYP3A-inhibited) and a 116% increase (both CYP3A and gut esterase-inhibited) in the portal plasma exposure to the active acid, compared with a non-GFJ pretreatment group. Overall, along with the CYP3A inactivation by GFJ, the decreased esterase activity also played a significant role in increasing the metabolic stability and permeability of esters leading to enhancement of exposure to the active drugs in rats. These new esterase inhibition findings indicate that the potential of drug interaction between ester prodrugs and GFJ should also be considered in the clinic.", 
    "61": "Statins induce heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in several cell types, such as vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and macrophages. The present study assessed the role of statin-induced HO-1 up-regulation on circulating monocytes/macrophages and their contribution in preventing renal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury in a rat model. Cerivastatin was administered via gavage (0.5 mg/kg) for 3 days before IR injury; controls received vehicle. Statin pretreatment reduced renal damage and attenuated renal dysfunction (P < 0.05) after IR injury. The protective statin pretreatment effect was completely abolished by cotreatment with tin protoporphyrin IX (Sn-PP), a competitive HO inhibitor. IR increased HO-1 expression at the transcript and protein level in renal tissue. This effect was significantly more evident (P < 0.05) in the statin-pretreated animals 24 hours after IR injury. We identified infiltrating macrophages as the major source of tissue HO-1 production. Moreover, in ancillary cell culture (monocyte cell line) and in in vivo experiments (isolation of circulating monocytes), we confirmed that statins regulate HO-1 expression in these cells. We conclude that statin treatment up-regulates HO-1 in circulating monocytes/macrophages in vivo and in vitro. We hypothesize that local delivery of HO-1 from infiltrating macrophages exerts anti-inflammatory effects after IR injury and thereby may reduce tissue destruction.", 
    "62": "Salt-loaded, spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats show progressive increases in blood pressure and proteinuria and accumulate acute-phase proteins in body fluids, modeling events during renal damage. The aim of this study was to assess the pathological events occurring in the kidney of spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats over time and evaluate the effects of statin treatment, which is known to improve renal and cardiovascular outcomes. Kidneys of male spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats euthanized at different stages of proteinuria showed progressive inflammatory cell infiltration, the accumulation of alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive cells, degenerative changes in podocytes, and severe fibrosis. These were accompanied by an imbalance in the plasminogen/plasmin and metalloprotease systems characterized by the increased renal expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, tissue plasminogen activator, and urokinase plasminogen activator; the net result was an increase in plasmin and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and a reduction in MMP-9 activity. Chronic treatment with the hydrophilic rosuvastatin had renoprotective effects in terms of morphology and inflammation and prevented the changes in plasmin, MMP-2, and MMP-9 activity. These effects were independent of the changes in blood pressure and plasma lipid levels. Treatment with the lipophilic simvastatin was not renoprotective. These data suggest that rosuvastatin may have potential utility as a therapeutic option in renal diseases that are characterized by inflammation and fibrosis.", 
    "63": "In the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS), treatment of hypercholesterolemic men with pravastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, reduced their likelihood to progress to diabetes mellitus by 30%. However, the mechanism of this effect of pravastatin has not been investigated. In the current study, we examined the effect of pravastatin on the development of diabetes in obese diabetic mice, and on the insulin-induced glucose uptake and adiponectin production. Pravastatin treatment attenuated the development of diabetes in db/db and high fat/high sucrose diet-fed C57BL/6J mice. An in vivo glucose transport assay showed that pravastatin upregulated glucose uptake in adipose tissue. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was enhanced in primary adipocytes isolated from pravastatin-treated mice. Pravastatin treatment increased adiponectin production in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Plasma adiponectin levels were significantly increased in pravastatin-treated mice. Analyses of plasma samples from the WOSCOPS biobank indicated a significant increase of plasma adiponectin levels with pravastatin treatment (placebo -0.28+/-0.34 microg/ml versus pravastatin +1.47+/-0.33 microg/ml, p=0.0003). Taken together, our findings suggest that pravastatin may have beneficial effects on adipose tissue, which may partly explain the reduction of the development of diabetes by pravastatin treatment.", 
    "64": "The genes encoding the low-density lipoproteins receptor and its ligand apolipoprotein B, have been the only two genes classically implicated in autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia. We have identified in 2003, the third gene implicated in this disease: PCSK9 (Proprotein Convertase Subtilin Kexin 9). Several mutations (p.S127R, p.F216L, p.D374Y...) of this gene have been reported to cause hypercholesterolemia by a gain of function leading to a reduction of LDL receptor levels. Other variations of PCSK9 are conversely associated with hypocholesterolemia particularly the non-sense p.Y142X and p.C679X mutations found in 2% of black Americans and associated with a decrease of LDL levels and coronary heart diseases. PCSK9 substrates and exact role have not been elucidated yet, but it seems that PCSK9 is definitely a major actor in cholesterol homeostasis. PCSK9 inhibitors might constitute new therapeutic targets that would decrease plasma LDL cholesterol levels and be synergistic with statin drugs.", 
    "65": "We investigated the combined effect of dietary supplementation with L-arginine, which is the precursor of NO, and pharmacological treatment with atorvastatin, which is a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitor, on the development of atherosclerosis in homozygous Watanabe heritable hyperlipidaemic rabbits. Rabbits were fed either standard rabbit chow (group C; n 9) as control, a 1.5 % L-arginine diet (group A; n 9), standard rabbit chow plus atorvastatin (2.5 mg/kg per d) in drinking water (group S; n 8), or standard rabbit chow plus a 1.5 % L-arginine diet with atorvastatin (group SA; n 8). Blood was sampled at 2-week intervals. After 8 weeks (T8), the aorta was harvested for topographic and histological analysis. Only the SA group showed decreases in total area of lesions (21 %) and the area of abdominal lesions (44 %) compared with the control group (P = 0.019). Furthermore, plaques in the SA group were smaller and less thick than those observed in the S group. Unexpectedly, plasma nitrite + nitrate levels were not modified under either the L-arginine diet alone or under L-arginine plus atorvastatin. The present study is the first to demonstrate that diet supplementation with L-arginine associated with a statin (atorvastatin) is more efficient in reducing lesion size than treatment with L-arginine or a statin alone. This is a relatively novel therapeutic approach associating a macronutrient and a drug.",

    "72": "Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors are an effective therapy for the majority of men with erectile dysfunction (ED). However, many men with ED still report a suboptimal or partial response even after an adequate trial of oral PDE-5 therapy. Since ED is associated with impaired vascular function and both atorvastatin and quinapril have been previously shown to improve vascular function, we examined the effects of adjunctive treatment with these medications in men with vasculogenic ED who were suboptimal responders to 100 mg of sildenafil. Men with ED and suboptimal response to sildenafil were randomly assigned to 3 months of treatment with atorvastatin 40 mg (n = 12), quinapril 10 mg (n = 10), or placebo (n = 13), along with continued adjunctive sildenafil use. Measured variables included: International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire, brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), endothelium-independent dilation (EID) via nitroglycerin, penile Doppler blood flow, blood pressure (BP), lipids, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Compared to placebo, quinapril (p < 0.01) significantly improved symptoms of ED as measured by the IIEF-5 questionnaire. There was a trend toward a significant improvement in IIEF-5 with atorvastatin. Similarly, quinapril significantly improved the IIEF ED Domain (p < 0.05). Other peripheral and penile vascular parameters were unchanged with drug therapy as compared to placebo. In conclusion, treatment with quinapril, in combination with sildenafil, improved ED in men with suboptimal response to sildenafil alone. Atorvastatin demonstrated a trend toward improved ED in this group.",

The present study compares the effects of simvastatin versus levothyroxine (LT-4) treatment on lipid profile and endothelial function in patients with SCH. Fifty-nine patients with newly diagnosed SCH were enrolled. Patients were randomized into 3 groups to receive no treatment (n = 19), LT-4 (n = 20), or simvastatin (n = 20). We measured endothelium-dependent vasodilation (EDV) and endothelium-independent vasodilation (EIV) at baseline and after 8 months. Serum total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol were significantly lower following simvastatin. EDV increased significantly in simvastatin treatment group (7.5% +/- 3.3% vs 14.0% +/- 4.5% (P < 0.01). The improvement of EDV correlated with the percent decrease of LDL-cholesterol (rho = 0.68, P < 0.01). Although LT-4 therapy caused a trend towards an increase in EDV compared to baseline, statistical significance was not achieved. EIV remained unchanged in all three groups. Simvastatin but not LT-4 treatment significantly improves EDV of the brachial artery and dyslipidemia in patients with SCH. Improvement in brachial artery endothelial function may be related in part to a hypolipidemic effect of simvastatin treatment.", 
    "74": "The aim of the present study was to provide new mechanistic insight into the effect of pitavastatin at low dose on NF-kappaB activated by TNF-alpha in the human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7). We found that treatment of MCF-7 with 1 microM pitavastatin inhibited the proliferation and suppressed the nuclear expression of NF-kappaB p65 induced by TNF-alpha with Western blotting. Furthermore, EMSA showed that pitavastatin significantly reduced the DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB induced by TNF-alpha. Subsequently, luciferase assay revealed that pitavastatin (1 microM) inhibited the transcriptional activity of the NF-kappaB promoter, which was clearly related to the HMG-CoA reductase activity because addition of mevalonic acid (MEV) could elevate the NF-kappaB activity. Moreover, the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 abolished the effect of pitavastatin on NF-kappaB activity. Finally, the addition of TNF-alpha significantly increased IL-6 protein production, which was suppressed by the addition of pitavastatin. These results suggest that pitavastatin at low dose (1 microM) inhibits NF-kappaB activation and decreases IL-6 production induced by TNF-alpha. It is dependent on Rho kinase pathway in human breast cancer cells.",

Soluble Flt-1 (sFlt-1; also known as soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 [VEGFR-1]) and soluble endoglin (sEng) are elevated in preeclampsia, and their administration to pregnant rats elicits preeclampsia-like symptoms. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and its metabolite carbon monoxide (CO) exert protective effects against oxidative stimuli.

Adenoviral overexpression of HO-1 in endothelial cells inhibited VEGF-mediated sFlt-1 release and interferon-gamma- and tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced sEng release, whereas HO-1 inhibition potentiated sFlt-1 and sEng production from endothelial cells and placental villous explants. Consistent with these findings, mice lacking HO-1 produced higher levels of sFlt-1 and sEng compared with wild-type mice. Using selective ligands (VEGF-E and placental growth factor) and a receptor-specific inhibitor (SU-1498), we demonstrated that VEGF-induced sFlt-1 release was VEGFR-2 dependent. Furthermore, CO-releasing molecule-2 (CORM-2) or CO decreased sFlt-1 release and inhibited VEGFR-2 phosphorylation. Treatment of endothelial cells with statins upregulated HO-1 and inhibited the release of sFlt-1, whereas vitamins C and E had no effect.",

    "110": "These days apolipoproteins especially apo B and apo A I are thought to be better predictors of risk of coronary artery disease as compared to lipids and lipoprotein cholesterol. Lifestyle modification and use of lipid modifying drugs such as statins and fibrates have proven effective in reducing the risk of coronary artery disease. Statins and fibrates are known to possess anti-atherosclerotic properties in addition to lipid modifying effects. Extensive data is available regarding lipid modification especially lowering of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels by these drugs. But the data regarding the effect of statins and fibrates, on apolipoprotein levels is scanty. Hence the present study was aimed at assessing the effect of statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin) and fenofibrate on serum apo B and apo A I levels in addition to their lipid modifying effects in various age groups of coronary artery disease patients. One hundred patients suffering from coronary artery disease were randomly assigned to 10 mg atorvastatin, 10 mg simvastatin and 200 mg fenofibrate, separately (without any combination). All the patients were divided into three age groups; group I (35-45 years), group II (46-55 years) and group III (> 55 years). Significant modification was observed in lipid and lipoprotein profile of coronary artery disease patients when treated with these drugs (statins and fibrates). A significant increase in serum apo A I (p < 0.01) and decline in serum apo B levels (p < 0.01) was observed in case of coronary artery disease patients after 16 weeks treatment, though the effect started after 1 month. All the three drugs reduced serum apo B levels in a comparable manner. Fenofibrate increased serum high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and apo A I levels more as compared to statins. It had nearly, proportionate effect in increasing high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and apo A I levels and reducing serum low density lipoprotein-cholesterol and apo B levels while the effect was disproportionate in case of atorvastatin and simvastatin. All the three drugs not only corrected lipid and lipoprotein cholesterol levels but also modified, apolipoprotein levels in a positive direction in coronary artery disease patients. Advancing age had no appreciable effect on the efficacy of these drugs.",

During the study, average systolic blood pressure increased by 2.8 mm Hg in the torcetrapib-atorvastatin group, as compared with the atorvastatin-only group. The increase in maximum carotid intima-media thickness, the primary measure of efficacy, was 0.0053+/-0.0028 mm per year in the atorvastatin-only group and 0.0047+/-0.0028 mm per year in the torcetrapib-atorvastatin group (P=0.87). The secondary efficacy measure, annualized change in mean carotid intima-media thickness for the common carotid artery, indicated a decrease of 0.0014 mm per year in the atorvastatin-only group, as compared with an increase of 0.0038 mm per year in the torcetrapib-atorvastatin group (P=0.005).",

There may additional, unintended positive consequences of treatment with statin drugs, including potential improvements in symptoms of claudication and enhanced graft patency after infrainguinal bypass. For patients undergoing surgical or endovascular revascularization, aspirin remains the standard of care for antithrombotic therapy. Beyond this, use of warfarin should be reserved for patients with high-risk surgical bypass grafts to prolong graft patency, because it carries a significant risk of bleeding complications. The utility of clopidogrel after surgical and endovascular infrainguinal revascularization remains undefined but warrants additional study. At this time the only clear indication for clopidogrel in patients with infrainguinal arterial occlusive disease is for PAD patients who are intolerant of aspirin or have a history of coronary artery stenting within the past 6 months. Proper adjunctive pharmacotherapy for the patient with PAD has the potential to improve symptoms, graft patency, and survival in this challenging subset of patients.",

    "165": "This retrospective analysis was conducted at a publicly funded teaching institution whose predominant patient population consists of Hispanics and Asians. A computer-generated report was used to identify outpatients who received a prescription for maximum-dose simvastatin or atorvastatin between January 1, 2002, and January 1, 2004. Data evaluated included demographic information; metabolic syndrome elements; coronary heart disease (CHD) risk equivalents; clinical characteristics placing patients at very high risk of having a CHD event; 10-year Framingham risk score; documentation of hepatotoxicity, myalgia, myositis, or rhabdomyolysis during maximum-dose therapy; concomitant medication during maximumdose therapy; relevant laboratory test values; and physician response to biochemical abnormalities or adverse events associated with maximum-dose therapy.", 
    "166": "Of the 232 outpatients identified, 173 were eligible for study inclusion. A total of 135 patients were classified as having a high or very-high risk of developing CHD (68 and 67, respectively). The success rates for low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goal attainment by very-high-risk patients and high-risk patients were 19.4% and 44.1%, respectively. Thirteen patients developed myalgia. Alanine transaminase levels were monitored for 38.8% of the study patients. Approximately 9% of patients were prescribed one interacting medication while on maximum-dose simvastatin or atorvastatin. The most commonly prescribed interacting drug was gemfibrozil.",

    "169": "A 17-year-old Indian boy weighing 55 kg was admitted to the hospital after complaining of facial puffiness and pedal edema for four days. His medical history revealed a diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome when he was 2 years old. He had six relapses, the last of which occurred 10 years ago. He was not taking any medications on admission and had not for the past 9 years. His vital signs were normal on admission (day 1), but anasarca was noticed during general examination. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and abdominal examinations were normal. Relapse of nephrotic syndrome was considered, and his 24-hour urine protein value confirmed the diagnosis. Further laboratory tests revealed that the patient had high total and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol values (597 and 465 mg/dL, respectively), and atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. once daily was initiated on day 2. Prednisolone 60 mg p.o. once daily was initiated on day 3. On day 6, the patient complained of pain in both thighs and had difficulty walking. His creatine kinase (CK) concentration was then measured and found to be elevated (11,821 IU/L). Prednisolone and atorvastatin were then stopped, as statin-induced myopathy was suspected. The patient received i.v. hydration and sodium bicarbonate, and he began to show improvement by day 9. Follow-up three weeks later revealed a normal CK level and no myopathy-related complaints.", 
    "170": "Early-onset rhabdomyolysis was reported in a patient with nephrotic syndrome who was treated with atorvastatin. Concomitant use of prednisolone and the patient's underlying renal impairment may have predisposed the patient to this adverse reaction.",

    "173": "As assessed by flow cytometry, TLR4 and TLR2 were detected on CD14+ monocytes. Unstimulated monocyte TLR4 expression was significantly higher in CHF patients compared to controls (mean fluorescence intensity, 3.57+/-0.57 vs. 1.72+/-0.32, p<0.05). TLR2 expressions were similar in CHF patients and control subjects (p=0.5). TLR4 levels correlated with the severity of CHF (NYHA class I/II: 2.66+/-0.40, and NYHA class III/IV: 5.08+/-1.24, p<0.01) and with serum lipid levels (total cholesterol, r=-0.44, p<0.01 and high-density lipoprotein, r=-0.68, p<0.001). After stimulation of monocytes by lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 ng/ml, 3 h), activated TLR4 was higher in CHF patients (p<0.05). Pre-incubation with fluvastatin for 24 h inhibited dose-dependently ex vivo monocyte TLR4 and TLR2 expressions (p<0.001).", 
    "174": "This study suggests that upregulation of monocyte TLR4 may contribute to the pathophysiology of chronic heart failure. Fluvastatin may prevent excessive innate immune response in vitro in chronic heart failure by inhibition of monocyte Toll-like receptor signaling.", 
    "175": "Sudden cardiac death, which is mainly associated with the presence of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, is a common 'killer' among patients with coronary artery disease. Moreover, atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia encountered in the clinical practice. The beneficial effect of statins on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is well-established, while the exact role of this class of drugs against arrhythmias remains unclear. This review discusses the effect of statin treatment on arrhythmias that are commonly seen in the clinical setting. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are also overviewed. Compelling evidence from the majority of the studies reviewed shows that statins exhibit a protective effect against the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation.", 
    "176": "Although fracture healing is a well-optimized biological process that leads to healing, approximately 10-20% of fractures result in impaired or delayed healing and these fractures may benefit from the use of biotechnologies to enhance skeletal repair. Peptide signaling molecules such as the bone morphogenetic proteins have been shown to stimulate the healing of fresh fractures, nonunions, and spinal fusions and side effects from their use appear to be minimal. Other growth factors currently being studied for local application include growth and differentiation factor-5 (GDF-5), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Molecules such as prostaglandin E receptor agonists and the thrombin-related peptide, TP508, have shown promise in animal models of fracture repair. Gene therapy using various growth factors or combinations of factors might also aid in fracture repair, particularly as new methods for delivery that do not require viral vectors are developed. Systemic therapy with agents such as parathyroid hormone (PTH), growth hormone (GH), and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are also under investigation. As these and other technologies are shown to be safe and effective, their use will become a part of the standard of care in managing skeletal injuries.", 
    "177": "Neutrophils play a central role in systemic inflammatory reaction after cardiopulmonary bypass. Apoptosis is significantly delayed, and this might exacerbate systemic and myocardial damage. We tested the hypothesis of whether pretreatment with simvastatin increases the apoptotic rate of neutrophils and hence reduces the entity of inflammatory reaction.", 
    "178": "Thirty patients undergoing coronary surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were randomized to treatment with either simvastatin (40 mg/day) or placebo for 3 weeks before surgery. A group of 15 patients undergoing off-pump coronary surgery served as controls. Blood samples for detection of serum cytokine levels were obtained before anesthesia, at the end of surgery, and at 4, 24, 48, and 72 hours postoperatively. Apoptosis and indices of activation were assessed in cultured neutrophils.", 
    "179": "Simvastatin significantly reduced the postoperative peak values of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8. The neutrophil apoptotic rate was significantly higher among neutrophils obtained from patients pretreated with simvastatin (p < 0.05 at both 8 and 24 hours) compared with placebo. Neutrophils from the statin group had depressed functional activity, as underscored by significantly lower values of CD11b (p < 0.01 at 24 hours) and a significantly less percentage of cells positive for nitro-blue tetrazolium (p < 0.01 at 12 and 24 hours) compared with placebo.", 
    "180": "This randomized, double-blind study indicates that statin therapy before cardiopulmonary bypass is associated with reduction of circulating markers of inflammation and increased neutrophil apoptosis. These data support a routine inclusion of statins as an adjuvant pharmacologic therapy before cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.", 
    "181": "Recent observations suggest statin treatment may be associated with lower mortality in heart failure (HF). The SCD-HeFT was a study of 2521 functional class II and III HF patients with left ventricular ejection fractions < or = 35% and ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy followed up for a median of 45.5 months. The study length, size, and degree of background HF, including the use of implantable defibrillator therapy, provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the impact of statin use in HF with mechanistic insights from subgroup analyses.", 
    "182": "Statin use was reported in 965 (38%) of 2521 patients at baseline and 1187 (47%) at last follow-up. The relationships between statin use, randomization arm, disease category, and functional class and all cause mortality were assessed. Statin use was studied as a time-dependent covariate in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, adjusted for imbalances between statin and no-statin groups. Mortality risk was significantly lower in those taking a statin (HR [95% CI], 0.70 [0.58-0.83]). Mortality risk was lower with statin use in all prespecified subgroups: ischemic cardiomyopathy (0.69 [0.56-0.86]), nonischemic cardiomyopathy (0.67 [0.47-0.96]), implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) (0.66 [0.46-0.95], non-ICD (0.71 [0.57-0.87]), New York Heart Association II (0.62 [0.48-0.79]), and New York Heart Association III (0.79 [0.61-1.03]).",

    "184": "Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) are known to reduce mortality and cardiac events in patients with coronary artery disease who have not progressed to left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) and/or heart failure (HF). This study investigated the effect of changes in statin therapy and cholesterol level on mortality in patients with LVSD.", 
    "185": "Data from consecutive patients with LVSD enrolled in a single local hospital HF management program were analyzed. Patients were grouped according to changes in statin treatment within 4 months after their initial visit: groups NS (no statin), IS (initiation of statin), CS (continuation of statin), and SS (statin stopped).", 
    "186": "Nine hundred patients were followed for a median of 36 (28-43) months (range, 16-66 months). The 2-year mortality was 16.7%. Groups IS and CS had lower 2-year mortality than groups NS and SS (11.0% and 11.9% vs 22.0% and 34.8%, respectively; P < .001). This was independent of age, sex, severity of LVSD, HF medications, New York Heart Association functional class, and baseline cholesterol. The effect was mainly observed in patients with coronary artery disease. In 734 patients who had completed 1-year follow-up on stable HF treatment, neither baseline cholesterol nor change over 1 year predicted outcome.",

    "188": "Although numerous large-scale trials have firmly established the benefits of statins for primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease, the role of this class of agents in patients with impaired renal function remains unclear.", 
    "189": "In the following review, we evaluate current evidence regarding the role of statins in patients with both chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. Although statins do appear to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with CKD, it remains unclear whether such benefit extends to the ESRD population. Thus far, 1 randomized placebo-controlled trial failed to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in the primary endpoint of cardiovascular death, stroke, and nonfatal myocardial infarction among patients with ESRD on hemodialysis. This finding contrasts with observational analyses suggesting improved outcomes among patients with ESRD taking statins.", 
    "190": "Risk factors unique to the CKD population, which may not be modifiable with statins, could contribute to the increased cardiovascular morbidity among patients with ESRD. These include alterations in mineral metabolism, elevation in serum homocysteine, and increased oxidative stress. Larger prospective studies are needed to elucidate the role of statins in patients with chronic kidney disease, including those with ESRD on dialysis. Pending further data, we currently recommend using statins in patients with CKD.", 
    "191": "Low dietary intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids has been linked to several features of psychiatric symptomatology, including depression, disorders of impulse control, and hostility. Preliminary intervention trials of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation for clinical depression and other disorders have reported benefit. However, few studies have investigated the relationships between these fatty acids and normative variability in mood, behavior and personality. Participants were 105 hypercholesterolemic, but otherwise healthy, non-smoking adults. Fasting serum alpha-linolenic (alpha-LNA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were assayed with gas chromatography. Participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the NEO Five Factor Personality Inventory (NEO-FFI) and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS). In multivariate analyses, higher levels of the long chain omega-3 PUFAs, EPA and DHA, were associated with significantly reduced odds of scoring >or=10 on the BDI. Similarly, DHA and EPA covaried inversely with NEO-Neuroticism scores, whereas DHA was positively associated with NEO-Agreeableness. On the BIS, DHA was inversely related to cognitive impulsivity and alpha-LNA was inversely related to motor and total impulsivity. These findings suggest that omega-3 fatty acid status is associated with variability in affect regulation, personality and impulse control.", 
    "192": "Two men, aged 83 and 78 years, who received stable therapy with simvastatin 80 mg/day were hospitalized 1-2 weeks after completion of short-term treatment with erythromycin and clarithromycin, respectively. Both patients were admitted with myalgia, muscle weakness, functional disability (inability to raise arms and legs), and serum creatine kinase levels more than 60 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Substantial elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (> 30 times the ULN) and alanine aminotransferase (> 7 times the ULN) levels were also observed. Rhabdomyolysis was diagnosed in both patients. Both recovered, but the combined events resulted in almost 40 days of hospitalization, the cost of which is considerable. According to the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale, the likelihood that the rhabdomyolysis was secondary to a simvastatin-macrolide interaction was probable. Four cases of rhabdomyolysis after therapy with combined simvastatin and clarithromycin have been reported previously, but this is apparently the first report of rhabdomyolysis after coadministration of erythromycin. The interacting mechanism likely was inhibited cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 metabolism and possibly P-glycoprotein transport of simvastatin as well. Previous reports of simvastatin-clarithromycin-related events involved additional drugs that inhibited CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein. However, this was not the situation with our two patients. To prevent future events, it is crucial that clinicians recognize the interaction risk associated with concurrent use of simvastatin and clarithromycin or erythromycin. The risk could be managed by temporary interruption of simvastatin treatment or administration of a noninteracting antimicrobial agent.", 
    "193": "20 elderly patients with average age of 64 +/- 0.1, who had had their atherosclerotic ischemic stroke within the period from one month till one year, have taken Simvatin for two months in the dose of 10 mg. per day. Analysis of the central hemodynamics and lipid metabolism before and after the treatment with Simvatin showed that the medication improves central hemodynamics (linear systolic velocity in common carotid and vertebral arteries increases and peripheral resistance in complicated internal carotid artery and two vertebral arteries decreases, dimension of atherosclerosis plaques and intima-media of common carotid artery decrease. Simvatin lowers the content of cholesterin, lipoprotein and fibrinogens. Positive effect of treatment with Simvatin on the cerebral hemodynamics, intensity of atherosclerotic process and lipid methabolism proves the medication to be recommended in treatment of patients with ischemic stroke in anamnesis.", 
    "194": "Low HDL cholesterol level is an independent risk factor in the cardivascular diseases and the therapeutic aim is to increase this. In high risk patients (cardiovascular disease-, diabetic- or metabolic syndrome patients), the target value of HDL cholesterol is more than 1,0 mmol/l in males and 1,3 mmol/l in females. The PPARalpha receptor activity has an expressed impact on the HDL cholesterol metabolism. It has been proved that in addition to fibrates, statins also influence its functioning. Simvastatin, as compared to atorvastatin, increases the HDL cholesterol level in a better way which positive effect has also been proved by the clinical trials. On choosing a therapy the optimisation of the HDL cholesterol level is also important in addition to achieving an LDL cholesterol target value.", 
    "195": "In atherothrombotic internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusive disease, chronic hemodynamic compromise may increase the risk for cerebral ischemic damage. To determine whether selective neuronal damage demonstrated as a decrease in central benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) in the normal-appearing cerebral cortex is associated with increased oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) (misery perfusion).", 
    "196": "We measured BZR and OEF using positron emission tomography in 105 nondisabled patients with atherothrombotic internal carotid artery or MCA occlusive disease and no cortical infarction. By using three-dimensional stereotactic surface projections and the stereotactic extraction estimation method, without correction for partial volume effects, the abnormally decreased BZR index [(the extent of the pixels with Z-score more than 2 compared with controls) x (average Z-score in those pixels)] in the cerebral cortex of the MCA distribution with arterial disease was calculated, and it was found to be correlated with the mean hemispheric value of OEF and several clinical variables.", 
    "197": "All patients had pixels with abnormally decreased BZR, with the extent varying from 0.04 to 60.91%. Multivariate analysis showed that the abnormally decreased BZR index was positively correlated with the value of OEF and the history of stroke, whereas it was negatively correlated with the presence of hypercholesterolemia with statin treatment. Follow-up examinations of 17 patients without ischemic episode showed that a decrease of BZR was associated with an increase of OEF.", 
    "198": "In atherothrombotic internal carotid artery or MCA occlusive disease, misery perfusion may cause selective neuronal damage, and statins might have beneficial effects against neuronal damage.", 
    "199": "This review describes the clinical profile and rationale for the development of a single-pill formulation of the calcium channel blocker amlodipine besylate, a blood-pressure--lowering agent, and atorvastatin calcium, a statin with lipid-lowering antiatherosclerotic properties. Amlodipine and atorvastatin have been demonstrated in numerous clinical trials to be highly effective in lowering blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Furthermore, both amlodipine and atorvastatin have been demonstrated to reduce cardiovascular events in a broad range of patients' in hypertensive patients with three concomitant cardiovascular risk factors but normal to mildly elevated cholesterol levels, amlodipine combined with atorvastatin demonstrated a reduction in cardiovascular events. The amlodipine/atorvastatin single pill has been shown to improve patients; achievement of national-guideline-recommended blood pressure and lipid target levels and exhibits a safety profile consistent with its parent compounds. The combination pill is now available in parts of Europe in formulations containing either 5 or 10 mg amlodipine and 10 mg atorvastatin. Amlodipine combined with atorvastatin has been demonstrated to reduce cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients at high cardiovascular risk, and the single-pill formulation has the potential to improve adherence and decrease prescription costs. These potential benefits are associated with important implications because hypertensive patients with additional risk factors represent a large proportion of those at risk for cardiovascular events.", 
    "200": "While 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, also known as statins, have a well-established in role in the treatment and prevention of ischemic coronary artery disease, their utility in the setting of heart failure (HF) and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction remains under investigation. Although a reduction in LDL is the major effect of statin therapy, pleiotropic effects have been demonstrated, which could be responsible for the reduction in morbidity and mortality seen with statin use in patients with HF. Patients with both ischemic and nonischemic HF have been shown to have improved survival with statin therapy, and patients receiving statin therapy are less likely to develop HF. Studies have demonstrated that statins reduce inflammation, improve endothelial function, decrease thrombogenicity, and improve LV and autonomic function. In this Review, we present the literature supporting the pleiotropic effects of statin therapy in patients with HF or LV dysfunction, and discuss the mechanisms by which statins might elicit the improvements in morbidity and mortality seen in these patients."
