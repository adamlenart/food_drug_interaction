Statins treatment was established according to NCEP-ATP-III. In both groups, the antihypertensive treatment was optimized in order to achieve blood pressure (BP) control (< 140/90 mmHg). A lipid profile and high sensitivity CRP (analyzed by nephelometry) was performed at the beginning and at the end of follow up [14.3 (3.6) months].",

The T group was treated with more antihypertensive drugs than C (2.2 [2.3] vs. 2.5 [1.2]; p = 0.02). Patients treated with ECA inhibitors or angiotensin II antagonist showed a tendency to decreasing the CRP levels more (p = 0.08).",

They are increasingly associated with potential chemopreventive effects with respect to cancer. A recent case-control study reported a 47% relative reduction in the risk of colorectal cancer associated with statin use after adjustment for other known risk factors. There is evidence of an inhibitory effect of statins on colorectal carcinogenesis from in vitro studies, animal experiments, and observational and epidemiological reports in humans. Although statins seem promising as chemopreventive agents, it is still too early to recommend their use against colorectal cancer outside the context of clinical trials.",

Although generally well tolerated with few side effects, including headaches and gastrointestinal symptoms, concerns are raised regarding myopathy, which may lead to fatal rhabdomyolysis. This review examines current evidence on statin interactions, mechanism of injury and toxicity.", 
    "6": "Significant myopathy is rare with an incidence of less than 0.5% of patients. Statin side effects may be dose-related, associated with other drug interactions that interfere with statin metabolic pathways through cytochrome p450 pathways or glucuronidation, or related to co-morbidities. Several theories have suggested that statin myotoxicity may be due to intracellular cholesterol depletion, or interference with oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Exact mechanisms are yet to be fully defined. Individuals with mixed dyslipidaemia may require combination therapy to achieve target lipid levels. No large-scale randomized trials have yet reported on the safety of combination therapy, although more recent studies may shed some light when they report.", 
    "7": "As most individuals on statins are 'high-risk' patients, they tend to be on multiple agents for cardiovascular disease which may interact with their statin. Progression of myalgia or myositis to rhabdomyolysis is rare (one in 30-100,000 patient-years of exposure), but if progressive muscle symptoms are ignored then fatalities can occur. When prescribing statins, physicians should be alert to potential risks and educate patients to report any potentially significant symptoms.",

Statins are potent inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis, and in clinical trials, statins have been shown to be beneficial in the primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. However, the overall benefits observed with statins appear to occur much earlier and to be greater than what might be expected from changes in lipid levels alone, suggesting effects beyond cholesterol lowering.", 
    "12": "Recent studies indicate that some of the cholesterol-independent or 'pleiotropic' effects of statins involve improving endothelial function, enhancing the stability of atherosclerotic plaques, decreasing oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibiting the thrombogenic response. Many of these pleiotropic effects are mediated by inhibition of isoprenoids, which serve as lipid attachments for intracellular signaling molecules. In particular, inhibition of small GTP-binding proteins, Rho, Ras, and Rac, whose proper membrane localization and function are dependent upon isoprenylation, may play an important role in mediating the pleiotropic effects of statins.", 
    "13": "The potential clinical implications of statin pleiotropy suggests that perhaps other biomarkers, in addition to lipid levels, should be used to gauge the full efficacy of statin therapy in patients with cardiovascular risks or that statin therapy may be effective in disease states, such as inflammatory conditions, ischemic stroke or cancer, where elevated cholesterol levels have not been shown to be a strong epidemiological risk for these diseases.",

Randomized trials have confirmed that LDL lowering decreased the risk of stroke, in diabetic or hypertensive patients with 'normal' LDL cholesterol at baseline, and in patients with coronary artery disease, with respectively 48, 27 and 25% reduction in stroke incidence. A meta-analysis of trials showed that the greater the LDL cholesterol reduction, the greater the intima-media thickness and stroke risk reductions. Even if statins also have 'pleiotropic' effects, their main action seems to be through LDL reduction. The Heart Protection Study only included strokes that occurred 4.6 years before--a time when the stroke event rate is low and the cardiac event rate is high, and so may not have had the power to find a true effect of LDL cholesterol lowering in preventing recurrent stroke. The Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) trial may give a definite answer because SPARCL investigators included 4732 patients with brain infarction or transient ischemic attacks and no history of myocardial infarction within 6 months of their stroke event, at a time when the expected stroke rate is very high and the myocardial infarction rate is very low. The results should be announced by mid-2006.",

These reported data suggest that genetic variations influencing intestinal cholesterol absorption, cholesterol production, and lipoprotein catabolism may all play a role in modulating responsiveness, as well as genes involved in drug metabolism of statins. They also suggest that combined analysis of multiple variants in several genes, all of which have possible functional relations, is more likely to give significant results, especially when being performed with a larger number of participants.",

Evidence from large trials suggests that patients with type II diabetes compared with patients without diabetes have similar risk reductions from statins for cardiovascular events, but this benefit is not seen in patients with diabetes and end-stage renal disease. In patients with acute coronary syndrome, early treatment with high-dose atorvastatin reduces cardiovascular morbidity after the first 4 months following the event, but the impact on mortality endpoints remains less clear. Results from recent trials in patients with stable coronary artery disease or type II diabetes suggest that statins provide benefit at considerable low LDL cholesterol levels. Therefore, target values for LDL cholesterol of less than 1.8 mmol/l (<70 mg/dl) should be considered for all patients with coronary artery disease or equivalent coronary risk.",

HDLc was inversely associated with risk in subjects on placebo (P=0.0019) but not in those on pravastatin (P=0.24). Risk reduction on pravastatin treatment was unrelated to baseline LDLc (P=0.38) but exhibited a significant interaction with HDLc (P=0.012). Subjects in the lowest 2 quintiles of HDLc (<1.15 mmol/L) had a risk reduction of 33% (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence limits, 0.55, 0.81; P<0.0001), whereas those with higher HDLc showed no benefit (RR, 1.06; 95% confidence limits, 0.88, 1.27; P=0.53).

The rate of decline on the 3MS was 0.48 point/year less in those taking statins compared with the untreated group for which treatment was recommended (p = 0.069) and 0.49 point/year less in statin users compared with the group in which lipid-lowering treatment was not recommended (p = 0.009).

However, dose-dependent effects of short-term statin therapy on vascular function have not been demonstrated. We studied endothelial function and vascular responsiveness to angiotensin II in patients who had coronary artery diseased and were randomized to receive low- or high-dose atorvastatin (10 or 80 mg, respectively) or placebo. Internal thoracic artery segments were obtained during coronary bypass surgery and studied in vitro. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation was increased with atorvastatin therapy (p = 0.035) but was significantly increased further in patients who received 80 mg compared with those who received 10 mg of atorvastatin (p = 0.05).

We investigated the effect of lovastatin on the expression level of TNF receptors (TNFR) in primary human endothelial cells (HUVEC). ELISA, FACS and immunocytochemical analyses show that lovastatin selectively increases the cell surface expression of TNFR2 without affecting the expression level of TNFR1. This effect of lovastatin is independent from inhibition of cell-cycle progression since cells both in G1- and G2-phase showed elevated levels of TNFR2 after lovastatin treatment. To analyze the physiological relevance of lovastatin-mediated upregulation of TNFR2, we investigated the expression of the cell adhesion molecule E-selectin, which is inducible by TNFalpha. While lovastatin on its own did not change the number of HUVEC expressing E-selectin protein, it promoted the TNFalpha-stimulated increase in the percentage of E-selectin expressing endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner. This indicates that lovastatin sensitizes HUVEC towards TNFalpha-induced signaling by upregulation of TNFR2 expression. Based on the data, we suggest that statins have impact on endothelial responses to inflammatory stress by modulation of the expression of cytokine receptors.",

    "51": "The cholesterol hypothesis implies that reducing the intake of saturated fatty acids and cholesterol and increasing that of polyunsaturated fatty acid are effective in lowering serum total cholesterol (TC), and thereby reducing the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD). However, these dietary recommendations are essentially ineffective in reducing TC in the long run, but rather increase mortality rates from CHD and all causes. The reported \"apparent relative risk of high TC in CHD mortality\" (the ratio of mortality at the highest/lowest TC levels) varied several-fold among populations studied. The incidence of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) in a population was proposed to be a critical factor in the observed variability, which could be accounted for by assuming that 1) the high CHD mortality rate in high-TC groups is mainly a reflection of the incidence and severity of FH, and 2) high TC is not a causative factor of CHD in non-FH cases. This interpretation is supported by recent observations that high TC is not positively associated with high CHD mortality rates among general populations more than 40-50 years of age. More importantly, higher TC values are associated with lower cancer and all-cause mortality rates among these populations, in which relative proportions of FH are likely to be low (circa 0.2%). Although the effectiveness of statins in preventing CHD has been accepted in Western countries, little benefit seems to result from efforts to limit dietary cholesterol intake or to TC values to less than approximately 260 mg/dl among the general population and the elderly. Instead, an unbalanced intake of omega6 over omega3 polyunsaturated fats favors the production of eicosanoids, the actions of which lead to the production of inflammatory and thrombotic lipid mediators and altered cellular signaling and gene expression, which are major risk factors for CHD, cancers, and shorter longevity. Based on the data reviewed here, it is urgent to change the direction of current cholesterol-related medication for the prevention of CHD, cancer, and all-cause mortality.", 
    "52": "Heart rate recovery is the difference in heart rate at peak exercise and at a specific time interval following the onset of recovery. Attenuated heart rate recovery is an independent predictor of mortality in patients with a history of coronary artery disease. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a statin on heart rate recovery, particularly in patients with ischemic heart failure and hyperlipidemia. Twenty-nine consecutive hyperlipidemic, stable coronary artery disease patients with heart failure and 19 healthy subjects were enrolled. Heart rate recovery values at the 1st and 3rd minutes and lipid profiles of the patients were evaluated at baseline and following 3 months of treatment with fluvastatin. Compared with healthy subjects, the heart rate recovery values were significantly lower in the heart failure patients in both the 1st and 3rd minutes, respectively (31 +/- 6 versus 19 +/- 7, P < 0.0001; 66 +/- 7 versus 47 +/- 8, P < 0.0001). Heart rate recovery in the 1st and 3rd minutes increased from 19 +/- 7 to 24 +/- 9 and 47 +/- 8 to 57 +/- 11, respectively, following treatment (P < 0.001, P < 0.001). There were no significant correlations among the changes in lipid parameters or HRR in the first and third minutes in the recovery period. The results revealed an improvement in heart rate recovery in heart failure patients by fluvastatin treatment. If this association can be confirmed by other studies, it would be interesting to perform further studies into the mechanism underlying this finding.", 
    "53": "To prevent coronary artery disease, it is necessary for patients with familial hyper-cholesterolemia (FH) to maintain a low cholesterol level. Recently a combination therapy of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis and statins has been used for FH patients, but their long-term prognosis over 10 years is unknown. In this single center prospective report, 18 FH patients with severe coronary stenosis received LDL apheresis every 2 or 4 weeks and statin therapy for 9.8 +/- 3.0 years. Probucol was given to 17 of the 18 patients. We observed their clinical events as well as coronary stenosis findings and ejection fractions for 10.7 +/- 2.6 years. Total and LDL cholesterol levels before therapy were 345 +/- 46 and 277 +/- 48 mg/dL, respectively. Immediately following LDL-apheresis, these levels decreased to 104 +/- 7.5 and 66 +/- 16 mg/dL, respectively. There were no cardiac deaths and 4 patients were free from any coronary events. There was one noncardiac death. Nonfatal myocardial in-farction occurred in 2 patients and coronary bypass surgery was required in one patient. Twelve patients received additional coronary angioplasty. There was little change in coronary stenosis and ejection fraction following 10 years of the combination therapy. Univariate Cox regression analysis revealed that the calculated mean LDL cholesterol level was the predictive value of treatment efficacy (mean LDL cholesterol < 140 mg/dL, hazard ratio 0.23, P = 0.028). The combination therapy of LDL-apheresis and antilipid drugs delayed the progression of coronary atherosclerosis and prevented a major cardiac event, although complete inhibition was limited to a small group. Additional coronary angioplasty is likely to be required for a favorable clinical outcome in FH patients.", 
    "54": "We examined whether 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) improve glucose intolerance in spontaneously diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats or not. The fasting blood glucose, plasma insulin, and serum cholesterol levels were significantly higher in GK rats than those in age-matched Wistar rats. All rats were given orally once a day 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose, pravastatin 8 mg/kg, simvastatin 8 mg/kg, or atorvastatin 8 mg/kg. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed before and 3, 6 and 12 weeks after statin treatments. The hyperglycemic response to OGTT in GK rats significantly exceeded that in Wistar rats. The plasma insulin level in GK rats increased with age until 14-week-old (treated for 6 weeks), and then decreased. Glucose intake significantly increased the plasma insulin in almost all rats. The increment of plasma insulin due to OGTT in GK rats appeared to be less than that in Wistar rats, because the basal level was already high in GK rats. Pravastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin did not modify changes in blood glucose and plasma insulin induced by glucose intake. In conclusion, long-term treatments of GK rats with statins did not improve glucose intolerance observed during OGTT.", 
    "55": "The aim of this article is to clarify the relationships between aging or age-related diseases and magnesium (Mg). The mutation of mitochondrial DNA can occur in both aging and Mg deficiency, resulting in peroxidation, intracellular Ca(2+) accumulation and apoptosis. The capability against peroxidation decreases in aging and Mg deficiency. DNA polymerase I, RNA polimerase and DNA helicase require Mg for their activities. Under Mg deficiency the replication, transcription and translation of DNA become erroneous. The dysfunctions of vascular endothelial cell occur in aging and Mg deficiency. In comparison between adult and old rats using the rings of rat thoracic aortae, vasorelaxation by acetylcholine and isoproterenol is lower in old rats, but can be improved through high Mg concentration. Although women with menopause are suffered from osteoporosis due to estrogen deficiency, bone fragility increases with additive Mg deficiency. High Ca intake is recommended for women with menopause, but adequate Mg intake is necessary to lower dietary Ca/Mg ratio, because the high ratio prompts blood coagulation. About lipid metabolism Mg can play a statin-like activity. Mg deficiency is complicated with lifestyle-related diseases, osteoporosis, bone fragility, depression and elderly dementia.",

    "60": "Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a common neurological disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding Neurofibromin, a p21Ras GTPase Activating Protein (GAP). Importantly, NF1 causes learning disabilities and attention deficits. A previous study showed that the learning and memory deficits of a mouse model of NF1 (nf1+/-) appear to be caused by excessive p21Ras activity leading to impairments in long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular mechanism of learning and memory. Here, we identify lovastatin as a potent inhibitor of p21Ras/Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) activity in the brain. Lovastatin is a specific inhibitor of three-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, used commonly for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. We report that lovastatin decreased the enhanced brain p21Ras-MAPK activity of the nf1+/- mice, rescued their LTP deficits, and reversed their spatial learning and attention impairments. Therefore, these results demonstrate that lovastatin may prove useful in the treatment of Neurofibromatosis Type 1.", 
    "61": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are widely used to reduce plasma cholesterol concentration. However, statins are also known to induce various forms of muscular toxicity. We have previously shown that acute application of simvastatin on human skeletal muscle samples induced a cascade of cellular events originating from mitochondria and resulting in a global alteration of Ca2+ homeostasis. The present study was designed to further define the origin of the mitochondria impairment and to understand the apparent lack of deleterious effect on the heart. Using fluorescence imaging analysis and oxygraphy on human and rat skinned skeletal muscle samples, we show that the simvastatin-induced mitochondria impairment results from inhibition of the complex I of respiratory chain. Similar simvastatin-induced mitochondria impairment and alteration of Ca2+ homeostasis occur in permeabilized but not in intact ventricular rat cardiomyocytes. In intact rat skeletal muscle fibers from the flexor digitorum brevis muscle, the simvastatin-induced alteration of Ca2+ homeostasis is abolished when monocarboxylate transporter (MCT4) is inhibited. The impairment of complex I by simvastatin might be the primary step of its cellular deleterious effects leading to muscle fiber death. This mechanism is seen specifically in skeletal muscles. This specificity should be in part attributed to a preferential uptake of statins by MCT4 that is not expressed in cardiomyocytes.",

    "67": "An abundance of experimental, clinical, and epidemiologic data capped by stunning interventional results with the statins has established hypercholesterolemia as a major causative factor in atherogenesis. In familial hypercholesterolemia and in animal models it is a sufficient cause. Some degree of hypercholesterolemia, perhaps 30-50 mg/dL, may even be a necessary cause. It is equally clear that from the very beginning atherogenesis has a strong inflammatory component, i. e., it is characterized by penetration of monocytes and of T-cells into the developing lesion. These cells, through the secretion of cytokines and growth factors, through immune responses, and through complex cross-talk with elements of the artery wall modulate the growth of the lesion and affect its stability. But inflammation has to occur in response to something. What is that something? What is the \"injury\" in \"response-to-injury\"? The case will be made that oxidized lipids in oxidized LDL or generated in response to prooxidative changes in the cells of the artery wall should be considered a plausible candidate. There is no need to consider hypercholesterolemia and inflammation as alternative hypotheses. Both are very much involved. Optimal intervention and prevention will probably require attention to both.", 
    "68": "INSIGs are proteins that underlie sterol regulation of the mammalian proteins SCAP (SREBP cleavage activating protein) and HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR). The INSIGs perform distinct tasks in the regulation of these effectors: they promote ER retention of SCAP, but ubiquitin-mediated degradation of HMGR. Two questions that arise from the discovery and study of INSIGs are: how do they perform these distinct tasks, and how general are the actions of INSIGs in biology? We now show that the yeast INSIG homologs NSG1 and NSG2 function to control the stability of yeast Hmg2p, the HMGR isozyme that undergoes regulated ubiquitination. Yeast Nsgs inhibit degradation of Hmg2p in a highly specific manner, by directly interacting with the sterol-sensing domain (SSD)-containing transmembrane region. Nsg1p functions naturally to limit degradation of Hmg2p when both proteins are at native levels, indicating a long-standing functional interplay between these two classes of proteins. One way to unify the known, disparate actions of INSIGs is to view them as known adaptations of a chaperone dedicated to SSD-containing client proteins.",

Four groups of animals were examined. Group I-treated with pravastatin, group II--with simvastatin--both drugs in a dosage of 40 mg/kg daily, 5 days/week for a total of 3 weeks. Mice in group III received atorvastatin 5 mg/kg for the same time period. Group IV--untreated animals serving as controls. The phagocytic capacity of the peritoneal macrophages was evaluated by their ability to engulf latex particles. In addition, the mitogen response of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and splenocytes to Con A and PHA was examined. Compared to the controls, the percentage of phagocyting cells in pravastatin-treated mice was enhanced by 18%, with simvastatin--by 24% and in atorvastatin-treated animals by 8%. The three statins increased the phagocytic index by 79.5%, 88.8% and 62%, respectively. The mitogen response of splenocytes from mice treated with the three statins to Con A increased by 68%, 48% and by 40%, respectively. Compared with the controls the response to PHA was higher in animals treated with pravastatin (84%), simvastatin (73%) and atorvastatin (57%). The response of PBMC from statin-treated animals to both mitogens did not differ from that of the controls. The results suggest that statins, at least those hereby investigated, may exert a beneficial effect on the immune function of the macrophages.",

Limited data are available on the utility of the statins in children after renal Tx. This 12-month prospective study was undertaken to determine the efficacy of pravastatin in reducing dyslipidemia after renal Tx in children and to determine predictors of dyslipidemia after Tx. From August 2001 to April 2004, all 17 newly transplanted pediatric renal transplant recipients at our center were preemptively treated with pravastatin from the immediate post-transplant period. Fasting lipid profiles were obtained at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after Tx. Trends in the lipid profile were analyzed using the repeated measures general linear model (GLM). A historical cohort of pediatric renal-transplant recipients not treated with pravastatin was used as the control population. The mixed effects GLM was used for multivariable logistic regression analyses to determine the independent effect of age, pretransplant cholesterol (Chol), body mass index (BMI), creatinine clearance (CrCl), and corticosteroid and tacrolimus doses on the development of dyslipidemia. The mean age of the children at Tx was 8.7 yr. The GLM analysis showed that with time, there was a significant decline in the total Chol, serum triglyceride (TG), LDL and also HDL-Chol (p-value <0.05 for each). Compared with the controls, the mean serum Chol was lower at all time points post-transplant in the treated patients. However, despite treatment, the prevalence of hypercholesterolemia increased from 31% pretransplant to 53% at 1-month, but declined thereafter to 6% at 3 and 6 months and 0% at 1 yr. Multivariable regression analyses showed the prednisone dose, pretransplant Chol and age to be the most important risk factors for the development of dyslipidemia. No child developed complications related to therapy. In summary, pravastatin is safe in the post-transplant period in children and reduces serum Chol, LDL-Chol and TG. An unexpected finding in our study was the decline in HDL-Chol after Tx. Whether the preemptive use of the statins will result in lower cardiovascular morbidity, especially considering the concomitant reduction in HDL-Chol remains to be determined.",

Atorvastatin administration after brain injury significantly promoted the restoration of spatial memory but did not reduce sensorimotor functional deficits. Treatment of TBI with atorvastatin increased neuronal survival in the CA3 region and the lesion boundary zone and prevented the loss of neuronal processes of damaged neurons in the hippocampal CA3 region but not in the lesion boundary zone on Day 15 after TBI. The protective effect of atorvastatin on the injured neurons perhaps is mediated by increasing the density of vessels in the lesion boundary zone and the hippocampus after TBI.",

Since the publication of these guidelines numbers of new clinical trials and experimental results have been published. Recently completed clinical trials have indicated that reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to goals lower than the previously considered appropriate 2,6 mmol/l, produce further cardiovascular risk reduction in high risk individuals. There is growing evidence of the role of inflammation in the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Numerous studies have demonstrated that elevated C-reactive protein may be an independent cardiovascular risk factor. Statin therapy has produced a greater cardiovascular risk reduction in those patients whose C-reactive protein level was high.

In the Apolipoprotein E gene knockout (ApoE-KO) mouse, a model of the atherosclerotic process, altered cholesterol metabolism with associated increase in OPN expression is evident at 12-22 weeks in the aorta and at 22 weeks in the heart. In this study, we analyzed another animal model of hypothyroid mice created by ingestion of propylthiouracil (PTU). After 2 weeks of PTU ingestion, the animals had significant decreases in thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) and immediate increases in blood lipids/cholesterol. Hypothyroid mice showed 1.3-, 1.5-, 2-fold increases in blood levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol respectively. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that hypothyroid mice had 1.4- to 2-fold increases of OPN mRNA expression in the aorta and 1.5-fold increases in the heart. Hypothyroid animals treated with T3 (5 microg/day for 6 days) or statin (0.2 mg/30 g for 2 weeks) reduce blood lipids and aortic OPN mRNA expression. Data obtained with ELISA analyses showed 1.5- and 1.7-fold increases in OPN protein in the aorta (10 weeks) and the heart (22 weeks), respectively. This increase is close to the mRNA expression in both tissues of hypothyroid mice. In addition, western blots showed several variants of OPN protein expressed in the aorta and the heart. The decrease in the 70 kDa OPN is accompanied by an increase in 45 kDa OPN in the aorta of hypothyroid mice. In contrast, only 45 kDa OPN is found in the heart of control and hypothyroid mice.

    "90": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, also known as statins, are commonly prescribed medications that lower serum cholesterol and decrease cardiac morbidity and mortality. These agents inhibit the rate-limiting step of the mevalonate pathway, an effect that influences cholesterol homeostasis and other diverse cellular functions. Preclinical data suggest statins have pleiotropic antineoplastic effects in a variety of tumors, but clinical studies have provided conflicting data regarding whether statins may increase or decrease the risk of cancer. Abnormal cholesterol metabolism in cancer is poorly understood but should be considered when evaluating the antineoplastic effects of statins. Emerging evidence suggests that atherosclerosis and cancer have similar underlying molecular mechanisms, both having lipid abnormalities and a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, statins target lipid metabolism, have significant anti-inflammatory effects, and can influence cardiovascular mortality. Recent studies show that statins may have chemopreventive effects and may complement cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiotherapy as a biologic response modifier in established cancer, but current data do not support their use as monotherapy. The preclinical data supporting anticancer activity, their additional health benefits, and the safety and relative low cost of statins compared to other 'targeted' agents currently under development all favor conducting prospective clinical trials of these drugs in cancer chemoprevention and therapy.",

Progeria cells bearing the G608G LMNA mutation are characterized by accumulation of a mutated lamin A precursor (progerin), nuclear dysmorphism and chromatin disorganization. In cultured HGPS fibroblasts, we found worsening of the cellular phenotype with patient age, mainly consisting of increased nuclear-shape abnormalities, progerin accumulation and heterochromatin loss. Moreover, transcript distribution was altered in HGPS nuclei, as determined by different techniques. In the attempt to improve the cellular phenotype, we applied treatment with drugs either affecting protein farnesylation or chromatin arrangement. Our results show that the combined treatment with mevinolin and the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A dramatically lowers progerin levels, leading to rescue of heterochromatin organization and reorganization of transcripts in HGPS fibroblasts. These results suggest that morpho-functional defects of HGPS nuclei are directly related to progerin accumulation and can be rectified by drug treatment.",

This myopathy is strongly enhanced by the combination with statins and fibrates, another hypolipidaemic agent. We have evaluated the initial step of statin-induced apoptosis by the detection of membrane flip-flop using flow cytometric analysis. L6 rat myoblasts were treated with various statins (atorvastatin (3 microM), cerivastatin (3 microM), fluvastatin (3 microM), pravastatin (3 mM), or simvastatin (3 microM)) for 2, 4 or 6 h followed by reacting with FITC-conjugated annexin V for the detection of initial apoptosis signal (flip-flop). Various statin-treated myoblasts were significantly stained with FITC-annexin V at 6 h, whereas they were not detected at 2 h. Moreover, immunoblot analysis indicated that when the cells were treated with cerivastatin (3 microM), membrane-associated Ras protein was activated and detached until 6 h, resulting in cell death through the consequent activation of caspase-8. On the other hand, since cytosolic Ras activation did not activate, there is still an unknown mechanism in statin-related Ras depletion.

    "101": "The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of the transport mechanism of pitavastatin, a novel synthetic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. Experiments were performed using oocytes of Xenopus laevis expressing several solute carrier (SLC) transporters and recombinant membrane vesicles expressing several human ABC transporters. The acid form of pitavastatin was shown to be a substrate for human OATP1, OATP2, OATP8, OAT3 and NTCP, and for rat Oatp1 and Oatp4 with relatively low K(m) values. In contrast, these SLC transporters were not involved in the uptake of the lactone form. A significant stimulatory effect was exhibited by pitavastatin lactone, while the acid form did not exhibit ATPase hydrolysis of P-glycoprotein. In the case of breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP), the acid form of pitavastatin is a substrate, whereas the lactone form is not. Taking these results into consideration, several SLC and ABC transporters were identified as critical to the distribution and excretion of pitavastatin in the body. This study showed, for the first time, that acid and lactone forms of pitavastatin differ in substrate activity towards uptake and efflux transporters. These results will potentially contribute to the differences in the pharmacokinetic profiles of pitavastatin.", 
    "102": "The metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus are both becoming more prevalent, and both increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Many patients are not receiving appropriate treatment for the type of dyslipidemia that commonly occurs in these disorders--the so-called 'atherogenic lipid triad' of high serum triglyceride levels, low serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, and a preponderance of small, dense, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) particles. All of the processes involved in atherogenesis can be exacerbated by insulin resistance and/or the metabolic syndrome. Hypertriglyceridemia is a strong predictor of coronary heart disease. There is also an inverse relationship between serum levels of HDL-C and triglycerides in diabetic patients, with low serum HDL-C levels possibly representing an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Small, dense, LDL-C particles are also highly atherogenic as they are more likely to form oxidized LDL and are less readily cleared. Insulin resistance, which is central to the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus, leads to high levels of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), which contain a high concentration of triglycerides, resulting in high serum triglyceride levels and low serum HDL-C levels. Even though modification of the atherogenic lipid triad is probably one of the most effective methods of reducing cardiovascular risk, therapy for diabetic dyslipidemia is often directed to first lowering serum LDL-C levels with a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. This may leave substantial excess risk for cardiovascular disease in patients with these types of dyslipidemia. The results of recent trials evaluating HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have been mixed, with two showing no significant effect on cardiovascular outcomes in subgroups of diabetic patients. The recent CARDS (Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study) showed that atorvastatin can reduce cardiovascular events in a trial specifically designed for a diabetic population, though the population had to have at least one other risk factor in addition to diabetes mellitus. Fibric acid derivatives, such as fenofibrate, bezafibrate and gemfibrozil, are potentially well suited to the treatment of dyslipidemia that is generally associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and the metabolic syndrome, as they are usually more effective than HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors for normalizing serum levels of HDL-C and triglycerides. Promising results have been obtained from several trials of fibric acid derivatives including the BIP (Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention) study and the VA-HIT (Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program HDL-C Intervention Trial; gemfibrozil). The FIELD (Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes) trial, a clinical outcomes trial specifically designed to evaluate fenofibrate in a large population of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, many of whom have the metabolic syndrome, is underway. The FIELD trial results should shed light on the efficacy and safety of fenofibrate in reducing cardiovascular morbidity in diabetic and metabolic syndrome patients and on the safety profile of combination therapy with fenofibrate and a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor.",

In contrast to secondary prevention these drugs do not reach cost-efficiency in primary prevention; due to their high prices for the criteria of the randomized controlled studies values >60 000 or >100 000 [US dollars/YLS] are gained. Data from England and Scotland indicate that according to the inclusion criteria of the WOSCOPS- and AFCAPS/TexCAPS studies almost 20 and 60%, respectively, of the adult population had to be treated with a statin. Results of newer studies may even increase these numbers. These costs cannot be covered by any health care system. Primary prevention of CHD with statins reveals paradigmatically that for financial reasons evidence-based medicine can no longer be transferred into clinical practice. The limited resources of all health care systems make rationing with treatment allocation only to the high risk groups necessary. The American, European and German guidelines propose a > or =2% annual risk of CHD as the limit, for financial reasons the Britisch recommendations favor a limit of 3%; in order to save >50% of the costs. Despite the financial restraints of the German health care system, the limit of > or =2% annual risk of CHD as proposed by the German Cardiac Society may be realistic when the different preventive measures are applied following a step-by-step plan based on the costs. According to the Procam algorithms, persons without diabetes mellitus or familiar disposition, who in case of nicotine abuse have given up smoking and if hypertensive have blood pressure values within the therapeutic range, statins are only to be given under the following conditions: LDL-cholesterol > or =175 or > or =190 mg/dl, for a HDL-cholesterol < or =35 or < or =45 mg/dl, or triglyceride levels > or =200 or > or =175 mg/dl, respectively. Diabetics without CHD have the same risk as non-diabetics with CHD. Therefore, in diabetics the same measures should be taken for primary prevention as in non-diabetics for secondary prevention. Evaluation of cost-efficiency indicates that intensive blood sugar control as well as intensive antihypertensive treatment and application of statins are all cost-effective in primary prevention of diabetics.", 
    "104": "Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the US and a common cause of long-term disability worldwide. Ischemic strokes, which are often atherothrombotic, account for more than 80% of all strokes. Current stroke prevention focuses on optimizing the treatment of modifiable risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia. The epidemiologic association between serum cholesterol levels and adjusted stroke rates is not as strong as the link between serum cholesterol levels and coronary heart disease. Clinical trials of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), which are potent inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis, have demonstrated, however, a marked reduction in stroke risk in hypercholesterolemic and atherosclerotic individuals, with benefits extending to normocholesterolemic individuals. These findings suggest that statins might have additional effects in stroke protection beyond cholesterol reduction. Because statins inhibit the synthesis of isoprenoid intermediates in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, which are important lipid attachments for intracellular signaling molecules, they might have direct noncholesterol-dependent effects on inflammatory and endothelial cells. Here we discuss data from clinical trials assessing the effects of statins on stroke risk, as well as outline the mechanisms underlying the cholesterol-independent effects of statins and provide evidence-based recommendations for stroke prevention, based on achieved serum cholesterol levels in patients at risk of stroke.", 
    "105": "Statins decrease triglycerides (TGs) in addition to decreasing low density lipoprotein-cholesterol. Although the mechanism for the latter effect is well understood, it is still unclear how TG decrease is achieved with statin therapy. Because hypertriglyceridemia is common in obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, we studied triglyceride-rich lipoprotein triglyceride (TRL-TG) turnover in 12 such subjects using stable isotopically labeled glycerol. The diabetic subjects were studied after 12 weeks of placebo and after a similar course of therapy with simvastatin (80 mg daily) in a single-blind design. The results were compared with those from six nonobese nondiabetic control subjects. Simvastatin therapy reduced serum TGs by 35% in the diabetic subjects. Compared with the control subjects, TRL-TG secretion was almost 2-fold higher in the diabetic subjects (45.4 +/- 4.9 vs. 24.4 +/- 1.9 micromol/min; P < 0.002) and was unaffected by simvastatin therapy. However, TRL-TG clearance was significantly increased in the diabetic subjects during simvastatin treatment compared with placebo (0.25 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.16 +/- 0.02 pools/h; P < 0.002). This change was accompanied by a 49% increase in preheparin plasma lipase activity (P < 0.03) and a 21% increase in postheparin LPL activity (P < 0.01). Together, these findings provide strong evidence that the effect of statins on serum TGs is related to an increase in LPL activity, resulting in accelerated delipidation of TRL particles. The effect of high-dose simvastatin on triglyceride-rich lipoprotein metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.", 
    "106": "Atorvastatin (ATV) is primarily metabolized by CYP3A in the liver to form two active hydroxy metabolites. Therefore, the sequential transport system governed by hepatic uptake and efflux transporters is important for the drug disposition and metabolism. Here, we assessed the interaction of ATV with hepatic uptake transporter organic anion transporting polypeptide (Oatp) and efflux transporter multidrug resistance associated protein 2 (MRP2/Mrp2) in vitro and ex situ using the isolated perfused rat liver (IPRL). Rifampicin (RIF) was chosen as an inhibitor for Oatp in both uptake and IPRL studies. Its inhibitory effects on MRP2 and metabolism were also tested using MRP2-overexpressing cells and rat microsomes, respectively. Our results indicate that RIF effectively inhibits the Oatp-mediated uptake of ATV and its metabolites. Inhibition on MRP2-mediated efflux of ATV was also observed at a high RIF concentration. Compared with ATV alone in the IPRL, the area under the curve(s) (AUC) of ATV was significantly increased by RIF, whereas the AUC of both metabolites were also increased in a concentration-dependent manner. However, the extent of metabolism was significantly reduced, as reflected by the reduced amounts of metabolites detected in RIF-treated livers. In conclusion, inhibition of Oatp-mediated uptake seems to be the major determinant for interaction between ATV and RIF. Metabolites of ATV were subject to Oatp-mediated uptake as well, suggesting that they undergo a similar disposition pathway as the parent drug. These data emphasize the relevance of uptake transporter as being one of the major players in hepatic drug elimination, even for substrates that undergo metabolism.", 
    "107": "Hypertension and osteoporosis are two major chronic diseases affecting the elderly. A cross-sectional study of 3887 Chinese men (n = 1958) and women (n = 1929) was used to explore the association between angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) use and bone mineral density (BMD). The participants were aged 65 years and above, and were recruited using a combination of private solicitation and public advertising from community centers, housing estates, and the general community in Hong Kong. Demographic, medical, and lifestyle information was obtained from face to face interviews using standardized questionnaire, and physical examination measurements included anthropometry, tibial, and brachial systolic blood pressures, femoral neck, total hip, and lumbar spine BMD. In multiple regression analyses, after adjusting for age, weight, height, thiazide, beta-blocker, calcium channel blocker, statin, corticosteroid, and calcium supplement use, history of diabetes, heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, and physical activity level, ACEI use was associated with higher femoral neck BMD (+0.015 g/cm2, P = 0.035) in women, and higher femoral neck (+0.015 g/cm2, P = 0.017), total hip (+0.016 g/cm2, P = 0.021), and lumbar spine (+0.043 g/cm2, P < 0.001) BMD in men. Thiazide use was associated with higher BMD at all three sites in general, although associations with BMD increase at the total hip (P = 0.07) and femoral neck (P = 0.09) were weak in men. Calcium channel blocker use was only significantly associated with BMD increase at the lumbar spine (P = 0.03) in women, and beta-blocker use did not have significant associations with BMD at any site. This study suggests that in addition to thiazide diuretics ACEI may have possible benefits in treating not only hypertension but also osteoporosis among older Chinese.", 
    "108": "The management of children with hypercholesterolemia (HC) depends on the level of premature atherosclerosis - associated risk. Inherited autosomal-dominant forms of HC (Family HC, Familial deficiency of apolipoprotein B, Family combined dyslipidemia) are at high risk of premature cardiovascular disease. These inherited forms of HC need to be systematically screened during childhood in case of family history and require a long term follow-up in order to prevent adult coronary insufficiency. The first recommended therapy consists in dietary intervention. When necessary, treatment with statin can be used from 8 years old. Before this age, acid-binding resins remain the first step treatment. Plant sterol-esters enriched spreads could be an additional useful treatment.", 
    "109": "Despite the benefits of statin therapy, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) management remains suboptimal and many patients do not achieve their recommended target goals. The aim of combination lipid drug therapy in high-risk patients is to achieve LDL-C and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) goals with a minimum of serious adverse effects. Although statins are the drug of first choice, statin monotherapy may be limited by intolerance of dose escalation or failure to attain non-HDL-C goals in those with mixed hyperlipidemia. Statins plus bile acid resins or ezetimibe can achieve greater than 50% reduction in LDL-C, with little or no increase in adverse effects. Fibrates, niacin, and omega-3 fatty acids, when added to statins, can reduce triglycerides, increase HDL-C, and reduce non-HDL-C to a greater extent than statin monotherapy. The safety profile of combination lipid therapy is acceptable, if the global coronary heart disease risk of the patient is high, thus producing a favorable risk to benefit ratio. Careful surveillance of hepatic transaminases, avoidance of gemfibrozil in statin-fibrate combinations, and awareness of statin-concomitant drug interactions is key to safe and efficacious use of combination lipid drug therapy.",

This review examines the rationale and clinical trial evidence for the benefit of lipid drug therapy in the presence of these related high-risk conditions. In particular, the results of the more recent statin trials are discussed and contrasted with evidence from trials with fibrates, which, although fewer in number, appear to show that this particular therapy has selective benefit for the overweight individual with diabetes or features of the metabolic syndrome.", 
    "111": "The early lesions of atherosclerosis begin in childhood, and are related to antecedent cardiovascular disease risk factors. Environmental and genetic factors such as diet, obesity, exercise, and certain inherited dyslipidemias influence the progression of such lesions. The identification of youth at risk for atherosclerosis includes an integrated assessment of these predisposing factors. Treatment starts with a diet low in total and saturated fat and cholesterol, the use of water-soluble fiber and plant sterols, weight control, and exercise. Drug therapy, for example, with inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase, bile acid sequestrants, and cholesterol absorption inhibitors, can be considered in those with a positive family history of premature coronary artery disease and a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol above 160 mg/dL, after dietary and hygienic measures. Candidates for drug therapy often include those with familial hypercholesterolemia, familial combined hyperlipidemia, the metabolic syndrome, polycystic ovarian syndrome, type I diabetes, and the nephrotic syndrome. We review the safety and efficacy of dietary and drug therapy, and propose an updated diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm that includes the metabolic syndrome. The early identification and treatment of youth with dyslipidemias is likely to retard the atherosclerotic process.",

    "113": "A model of hypercholesterolemia (HC) was established by high-cholesterol diet and 24 immature rabbits were divided randomly and equally into control group, HC-diet group and fluvastatin group. At the beginning of the study and after 12 weeks, the body height (BH) and body weight (BW) of the rabbits were measured and their body mass index (BMI) was calculated. At the end of 12 weeks, serum total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels were examined. The intima-medial thickness of the abdominal aorta (aIMT) was measured by using non-invasive high-resolution (14 MHz) B-mode ultrasound imaging. Histological changes in abdominal arteries were studied by H&E-staining and histomorphometric analysis. The gene expression of LOX-1 in abdominal aorta was evaluated by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and its protein expression was examined by immunohistochemistry.", 
    "114": "High cholesterol diet induced hypercholesterolemia and early AS in immature rabbits. In HC-diet group serum TC and LDL levels in rabbits elevated. B mode echocardiography showed that aIMT was thickened and pathomorphology indicated that extensive aortic intima (I) and intima and media (I + M) became thickened and the ratio of the area of intima to media (S(I)/S(M)) was increased. Aortic intimal proliferation in HC-diet group was associated with a marked increase in LOX-1 expression (protein and mRNA) in endothelium and neointima of the abdominal aorta. Treatment with fluvastatin at a dosage of 10 mg/(kg.d) deduced serum lipid, attenuated artery intimal proliferation and markedly decreased the enhanced LOX-1 expression level in endothelium and neointima in immature rabbits. There were no significant differences of BH, BW or BMI among the three groups.",

    "119": "A major challenge in lead discovery is to detect well-known and trivial compounds rapidly, a process known as dereplication, so that isolation, structure elucidation, and pharmacological investigations can be focused on novel compounds. In this paper, we present a new algorithm, X-hitting, based on cross sample comparison of full UV spectra from HPLC analysis of highly complex natural product extracts/samples. X-Hitting allows automatic identification of known compounds but more important also allows finding of potentially new or similar compounds. We demonstrate this new algorithm by automatic identification of known structures, a task we call cross-hitting, and tentative identification of potentially new bioactive compounds, a task we call new-hitting, in HPLC data from analysis of fungal extracts. Both tasks are illustrated using 18 important reference compounds and complex fungal extracts obtained from isolates in the IBT Culture Collection held at BioCentrum-DTU, Technical University of Denmark. The receiver operating characteristics statistic is used to evaluate the performance of the compound predictor, and it was found that compounds could be identified with high confidence (AUC approximately 0.98). Based on high confidence in retrieving identical spectra, the method is extended to include similar but still different spectra.", 
    "120": "Epidemiological, biochemical and pharmacological investigations provide increasing number of evidences that altered cholesterol metabolism contributes to the development of Alzheimer's disease. The objective of the present paper is to review existing information about the links of cholesterol and amyloid metabolism from the clinical and proposed etiological viewpoints of the most frequent dementing disorder in Hungary. Beta-amyloid peptide, the major component of the senile plaques in the Alzheimer's disease brains is the end product of the abnormal post-translational processing of its precursor, called amyloid precursor protein. The compartmentation of the amyloid precursor protein molecule within the cell membrane is regulated by the cholesterol content of the bilayers. The amyloid precursor protein molecule could be present either in-, or outside of the membrane rafts. Any kind of process, which alters the compartmentation preference of the amyloid precursor protein molecule, by transferring it to the membrane rafts, favours beta- and gamma-secretase cleavage, and should be recognised as an amyloidogenic process. If the blood-brain barrier is intact, the brain is not able to take up the lipoprotein particles responsible for the transport of cholesterol. Instead of the active uptake, neurons and glial cells synthetize cholesterol de novo, in a process, where the rate limiting enzyme is 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A. On the other hand, the brain specific CYP46A1 enzyme is responsible for the degradation of cholesterol into a water soluble metabolite, called 24S-OH cholesterol. The decreased CYP46A1 activity in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients raises membrane cholesterol levels, and as a consequence the amyloid precursor protein is shifted and deposited in the cholesterol rich lipid rafts leading to beta-amyloid peptide specific metabolism. Among the polymorphic variants of the apolipoprotein E gene, the E4 allele is considered as a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. The E4 allele carrier Alzheimer's disease probands have increased amyloid burden, decreased beta-amyloid peptide degradation, and less effective neuronal repair mechanisms. Even as early as age 30, patients with Niemann-Pick Type C disease show clinical and neuropathological signs of Alzheimer's disease. The point mutation of the protein responsible for the endosomal transport of cholesterol is considered as a major cause of the beta-amyloid peptide deposition in the brain of Niemann-Pick Type C patients. One of the most exciting recent discovery, that Niemann-Pick Type C disease could be recognised as a disease model for Alzheimer's disease. New, promising cholesterol metabolism related therapeutic approaches are discussed, but it is emphasized that the clinical evidences regarding their efficacy in Alzheimer's disease are still missing.",

Treatment was continued for 6 months. CRP and IL-6 levels increased within 48 hours after PCI in all groups, in comparison with A and B, a more pronounced decrease in CRP (mg/l) and IL-6 (pg/ml) levels at 3- and 6-month follow-up was present in C: CRP at 6 months: 0.76 vs. 1.92 vs. 0.11, p<0.05; IL-6 at 6 months: 0.02 vs. 0.04 vs. 0.01, p<0.05. At 6-month follow-up the reduction in CRP level occurred in 70% of subjects with CRP higher than median (3.6mg/l) at baseline vs. 15% of patients with CRP lower than median (p<0.041).",

    "124": "Sixty-six patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (RAS) and serum creatinine < or =2.0 mg/dl were treated with antihypertensive therapy, a statin, and aspirin. Renal stenting was reserved for patients with injuries to the heart, brain, or kidneys. The primary end point was stenotic kidney glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at 21 months; secondary end points included major adverse clinical events, serum creatinine, total GFR, and blood pressure (BP). After baseline evaluation, 26 of 66 patients underwent renal stenting because of injuries to the heart, brain, or kidneys. After 21 months, 6 medical patients required renal stenting, and 5 patients experienced late clinical events (2 medical patients, 3 stent patients). There was no difference in final BP between groups. Whereas medical patients experienced 6% and 8% decreases in total and stenotic kidney GFR, stent patients experienced 7% and 11% increases in total kidney (p = 0.006) and stenotic kidney (p = 0.02) GFR. There was no difference in final serum creatinine. In conclusion, patients with atherosclerotic RAS and baseline creatinine < or =2.0 mg/dl can be safely managed with aggressive medical therapy, with a small decrease in GFR. For patients who develop injuries to the heart, brain, or kidneys, renal artery stenting may further reduce hypertension and improve renal function.",

Patients were randomized to rosuvastatin 10 mg/day (n = 48) or to no lipid-lowering treatment (n = 43) for 20 weeks. In contrast to patients not receiving rosuvastatin, patients receiving rosuvastatin tended to derive more favorable improvements from baseline values in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-43%, p <0.001, vs 7%, p = NS; p <0.001 for change with rosuvastatin treatment vs change with no antilipemic treatment), hs-CRP (-47%, p <0.001, vs 7%, p = NS; p <0.001 for change with rosuvastatin treatment vs change with no antilipemic treatment), and GFR (11%, p <0.05, vs 4%, p = NS; p = NS for change with rosuvastatin treatment vs change with no antilipemic treatment).",

    "127": "The time course and differential effects of statin regimens on endothelial function after acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) are unknown and could contribute to the superiority of a more intense strategy. A subset of subjects who were enrolled in the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 trial (n = 50) underwent evaluation of vascular reactivity by high-resolution brachial ultrasound. Endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and endothelium-independent sublingual nitroglycerin-mediated dilation (NMD) were measured at baseline and at 48 hours, 1 month, and 4 months after the initiation of 40 mg of pravastatin (n = 26) or 80 mg of atorvastatin (n = 24). After 4 months, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was decreased by 32% in the atorvastatin group but was not different from baseline after ACS in the pravastatin group. C-reactive protein decreased similarly in the 2 groups. Brachial artery diameters at rest were similar in the 2 groups and at each time point of the trial. FMD and NMD increased significantly after 4 months by 27% and 24%, respectively (p <0.05), with no difference between groups. There was no correlation between the change in FMD and the change in lipids or C-reactive protein. In subjects who had received previous statin therapy (n = 15), there was no significant variation in FMD (p = 0.140) and NMD (p = 0.129). In conclusion, initiation of statin therapy soon after ACS is associated with improvements in endothelium-dependent and independent vascular reactivities after 4 months.", 
    "128": "Statins have a good overall safety profile to date, with no increase in haemorrhagic stroke or cancer. They have favourable effects in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in high-risk young as well as elderly populations. Statins reduce the incidence of stroke in high-risk populations (mainly CHD patients, diabetics and hypertensives) even with a normal baseline blood cholesterol level, which argues for a global cardiovascular risk-based treatment strategy. As for CHD, stroke reduction was mainly observed in studies with large between-group LDL cholesterol difference. In patients with prior strokes, statins reduce the incidence of coronary events, but it is not yet proven that they actually reduce the incidence of recurrent strokes in secondary prevention. From a practical point of view, since there was a favourable treatment effect overall in stroke and TIA patients in HPS, it seems reasonable to treat stroke patients with a statin and total cholesterol >135 mg/dL (3.5 mmol/dL). On-going research is aiming to refine patient selection. As anticipated by current US recommendations, patients who are likely to benefit most are those with carotid atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, previous coronary heart disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, or cigarette smoking and LDL cholesterol > 100 mg/dL.", 
    "129": "Since receptor/transcription factor family especially peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors PPARs (alpha, gamma) and liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) have been recognized to play crucial role in both lipid metabolism and inflammation, the present study was addressed to explore the interrelationship between blood cellular genomic expression profile, serum lipid levels and severity of coronary heart disease (CHD) in human subjects. Based upon the demographic and laboratory data, the human subjects were divided into 4 groups. Genomic expression profile in the subjects belonging to these groups was determined by measuring the transcriptional expression of genes coding for PPARs (alpha, gamma), CD36, LXRalpha and low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) in their blood mononuclear cells. This genomic expression profile was correlated with serum lipid profile as well as with the severity of CHD (revealed by coronary angiography coupled with modified Gensini score) using standard statistical analytical methods. Further in vitro and in vivo effect of statins on such genomic profile was also explored. Although genes coding for PPARs (alpha, gamma), CD36, LDLR showed correlation with the severity of coronary atherosclerosis , blood cellular LXRalpha genomic profile showed conspicuous negative correlation with the severity of coronary atherosclerosis in subjects with or without hypercholesterolemia. This view was further confirmed in experiments directed to understand the effect of statins on the cellular genomic profile of PPARs (alpha, gamma) and LXRalpha. Based on these reported findings, we propose that blood cellular LXRalpha genomic profile has a protective effect against the development of CHD and hence may be of importance in devising synthetic therapeutic drugs for CHD in future.", 
    "130": "Formation of an acyl-CoA thioester has been proposed, but not directly demonstrated, to be a key step in mediating both lactonization and atypical beta-oxidation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors. Here, we describe studies to characterize formation of acyl-CoA thioesters in vitro in mouse liver preparations using the hydroxy acid form of simvastatin (SVA) as a model substrate. With an optimized chromatography method, three new products were detected in addition to the dehydration product (P1) and the lactone form of simvastatin, which have been characterized previously (Prueksaritanont et al., 2001). Based on high-pressure liquid chromatography analysis, UV spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and NMR spectral characterization, two metabolites were identified as acyl-CoA thioester conjugates of SVA and P1, respectively, whereas the third metabolite (M1) was confirmed to be the L-beta-hydroxy isomer of simvastatin. M1 was probably formed by stereospecific hydration, a previously reported reaction, and subsequent lactonization of P1-S-acyl CoA. Among all the mouse liver subcellular fractions, microsomes exhibited the highest capacity to catalyze the CoASH-dependent metabolism of SVA, whereas such activity was totally absent in cytosol. Together, these results provide direct experimental evidence that SVA (and conceivably other statins as well) is able to form an acyl-CoA thioester, possibly by microsomal long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase(s), leading to formation of two parallel metabolic pathways, one resulting in the two diastereomers of statin lactones (simvastatin and M1) and the other to the beta-oxidation pathway of statin hydroxy acids.", 
    "131": "Coronary artery calcification (CAC) reflects the anatomic presence of coronary atherosclerosis and the relative burden of coronary artery disease (CAD). Higher levels of CAC are seen in the presence of CAD risk factors, older age, and chronic kidney disease. The lipid profile (primarily low HDL cholesterol, elevated triglycerides, elevated LDL cholesterol, and elevated total cholesterol) are important factors in the calcification process. The annual progression of CAC can be reduced from 25 to 30% to 0 to 6% with LDL cholesterol reduction caused by statins and possibly sevelamer. At treated LDL cholesterol levels somewhere below 100 mg/dl, several sources of data suggest the anatomic burden of CAD, including CAC, regresses. Additional supportive studies indicate that carotid intimal medial thickness and the volume of coronary atheroma also can be reduced by LDL cholesterol reduction in concert with elevation of HDL cholesterol. This article reviews the data in support of altering the natural history of CAC with lipid modification.", 
    "132": "Although diabetes is a major cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD), limited data describe the cardiovascular benefit of hydroxymethyl glutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) in people with both of these conditions. This study sought to determine whether pravastatin reduced the incidence of first or recurrent cardiovascular events in people with non-dialysis-dependent CKD and concomitant diabetes, using data from three randomized trials of pravastatin 40 mg daily versus placebo. CKD was defined by estimated GFR <60 or 60 to 89.9 ml/min per 1.73 m2 with proteinuria. Of 19,737 patients, 4099 (20.8%) had CKD but not diabetes at baseline, 873 (4.4%) had diabetes but not CKD, and 571 (2.9%) had both conditions. The primary composite outcome was time to myocardial infarction, coronary death, or percutaneous/surgical coronary revascularization. Median follow-up was 64 mo. After adjustment for trial and random treatment assignment, the incidence of the primary outcome was lowest in individuals with neither CKD nor diabetes (15.2%), intermediate in individuals with only CKD (18.6%) or only diabetes (21.3%), and highest in individuals with both characteristics (27.0%). Pravastatin reduced the relative likelihood of the primary outcome to a similar extent in subgroups defined by the presence or absence of CKD and diabetes. For example, pravastatin was associated with a significant reduction in the relative risk of the primary outcome by 25% in patients with CKD and concomitant diabetes and by 24% in individuals with neither characteristic. However, the absolute reduction in the risk of the primary outcome as a result of pravastatin use was highest in patients with both CKD and diabetes (6.4%) and lowest in individuals with neither characteristic (3.5%). In conclusion, stage 2 or early stage 3 CKD and diabetes both are associated with higher cardiovascular risk, and pravastatin reduces cardiovascular event rates in people with neither, one, or both characteristics. Given the high absolute benefit of pravastatin in patient with diabetes and stage 2 or early stage 3 CKD, this population in particular should be targeted for widespread use of statins. Additional studies are needed to determine whether these benefits apply to patients with more severe CKD, and recruitment to such studies should be given high priority.",

    "136": "Compared with placebo, fluvastatin significantly improved flow-mediated vasodilatation to hyperemia, a hallmark of endothelial function [from 3.8% (-3.9 approximately 15.2) to 5.9% (-0.3 approximately 13.2), p = 0.001], and attenuated plasma levels of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) [from 1.3 (0.3 approximately 7.7) to 1.1 mg/l (0.2 approximately 3.5), p = 0.018], IL-18 [from 247.6 (145.4 approximately 378.4) to 196.4 pg/dl (90.7 approximately 380.2), p <0.001], total MMP-9 (from 58 +/- 46.3 to 39.4 +/- 22.4 ng/dl, p = 0.023), and MMP-9 activity [from 6.4 (3.6 approximately 27) to 5.6 ng/dl (3.1 approximately 13.7)]. However, no significant correlation was found between the degree of changes in lipid profile and flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and plasma concentration of IL-18 and MMP-9.", 
    "137": "Fluvastatin reduced plasma concentrations of IL-18 and MMP-9, and improved endothelial function in patients with hypercholesterolemia independent of its lipid-lowering effect.", 
    "138": "Almost half of first cardiovascular events occur in individuals with no known risk factors. Attempts in the last decade to predict cardiovascular risk more accurately have led to the emergence of a novel risk factor, C-reactive protein (CRP), which has proved to be as good a risk predictor as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. C-reactive protein is an index of inflammation that is now believed to promote directly all stages of atherosclerosis, including plaque rupture. As measured by high-sensitivity assays, high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) also independently predicts recurrent events in patients with known coronary artery diseases. Recent evidence implicates hs-CRP, and thus inflammation, in the metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus, particularly in women. As a clinical tool for cardiovascular risk assessment, hs-CRP testing enhances information provided by lipid screening or global risk assessment. Statin therapy and other interventions can lower hs-CRP. Whether or not such reductions can prevent cardiovascular events is under investigation.", 
    "139": "With improvements in diet and health care over the last several decades, the elderly have become the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population. Along with this progress, however, has come increasing morbidity, much of which is attributable to cardiovascular disease, and which is burdensome both to patients and to the health-care system. New medications, including HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have the potential to prevent or delay the progression of disease and vascular events. Large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials continue to show that elderly patients benefit from statin therapy and that aggressive therapy is generally very safe in this population; however, statins remain under-used in older individuals. This paper reviews the benefits of statin therapy in the elderly and discusses the reality versus the perception of risk, selection of appropriate patients, and ways in which any risks that may exist can be minimized further."
