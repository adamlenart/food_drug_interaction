Pharmacogenetic studies have identified multiple loci that potentially contribute towards the statin response, including the HMGCR gene. To examine, if a statin-resistant, catalytically-active isoform of the human HMGCR could be generated, we have rationally altered the protein to include additional residues in the flap domain, which has a role in statin binding. Comparative enzyme assays with purified wild-type and mutant isoforms reveal the alteration imposes a slight (38%) decrease in the K(app)(M) for the substrate, a near 2-fold increase in turnover number, and a 480% increase in the Ki for lovastatin. Thus, alterations in HMGCR could contribute towards the synergistic effects of multiple loci in the statin response.",

At the time of the clinical consultation the animal presented weight loss, anorexia and generalised lymphadenomegaly. After careful clinical observation and a detailed laboratory workup, the diagnosis of small cleaved cell lymphoma was established. It was classified as a stage III b multicentric lymphoma. Chemotherapy was initiated according to a classical COP protocol to which atorvastatin was added. After 34 months, the cat continues to enjoy an excellent quality of life with no clinical or haematological signs of lymphoma. This is the first report in clinical veterinary medicine about a new effective adjuvant therapy in feline multicentric lymphoma. Further studies are needed to confirm that the addition of atorvastatin can provide a regular, safe and improved treatment in feline lymphoma cases.", 
    "6": "The field of the potential applications of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) beyond their unambiguous cardiovascular beneficial effects is steadily increasing. In this regard, statins have also been shown to possess anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antioxidant and growth inhibitory properties. Regarding their role in carcinogenesis, both preclinical and clinical studies report conflicting results. Intriguingly, accumulating evidence suggests that statins may relate to decreased prostate cancer incidence and recurrence risk. However, data from clinical studies seem to be still weak and are confounded by several factors. Nonetheless, preclinical data suggest that statins might exert a chemopreventive role against prostate cancer by inhibiting the proliferation and inducing apoptosis of prostate cancer cells and also inhibiting angiogenesis, inflammation and metastasis. Cholesterol lowering as well as statin pleiotropy through inhibition of the synthesis of isoprenoids have both been implicated in their anticancer properties. In this review, we discuss the preclinical and clinical evidence supporting the preventive or potentially harmful effects of statins on prostate tumourigenesis and conclude that statins should not be recommended for the prevention of prostate cancer development or progression based on the current data.",

Despite the widespread availability of effective lipid-lowering agents, an unacceptably large proportion of patients fail to attain their target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level in clinical practice. Reasons for this include undertreatment, poor adherence/persistence with therapy and failure to address non-LDL-C residual risk factors such as high levels of triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations and raised apolipoprotein B: apolipoprotein A1 ratios. Pitavastatin is a novel, well-tolerated statin with a noninferior or superior lipid-lowering efficacy to comparable doses of atorvastatin, simvastatin, and prava-statin in a wide range of patients with hypercholesterolemia or combined dyslipidaemia. Compared with other statins, pitavastatin produces consistently greater increases in HDL-C levels that are sustained over the long term. In addition to pravastatin's potent effects on lipid profiles, a number of pleiotropic benefits have been identified that may contribute to a reduction in residual cardiovascular risk in people with dyslipidaemia and could partly account for pitavastatin's ability to regress coronary plaques in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Pitavastatin's unique metabolic profile results in a high efficacy at low (1-4 mg) doses and minimal drug interactions with cytochrome CYP3A4 substrates, making it an excellent choice for people requiring multiple medications. Although future trials are required to assess the impact of pitavastatin treatment on CV morbidity and mortality, studies to date suggest that pitavastatin will play an important role in the future management of dyslipidaemia and in the overall reduction of CV risk.",

P-gp-mediated drug efflux can contribute to chemotherapy failure. However, direct statin-mediated inhibition of P-gp in human MDR tumor cells at clinically achievable concentrations remains unexplored. An understanding of these interactions is crucial, both to appreciate differences in the anticancer potential of different statins and to safely and effectively integrate statins into traditional chemotherapy regimens that include P-gp substrates. Here we evaluate interactions between 4 statins (lovastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin and rosuvastatin) and P-gp, at both the molecular level using purified P-gp and at the cellular level using human MDR tumor cells. Lovastatin bound directly to purified P-gp with high affinity and increased doxorubicin accumulation in MDR tumor cells, potentiating DNA damage, growth arrest and apoptosis. By contrast, while atorvastatin inhibited substrate transport by purified P-gp in proteoliposomes, it had no effect on doxorubicin transport in MDR tumor cells. Finally, fluvastatin and rosuvastatin only interacted with P-gp in vitro at high concentrations and did not inhibit doxorubicin transport in MDR cells. These differential interactions should be considered when combining statins with traditional chemotherapeutic drugs.",

METHODS: Two hundred seventy-two patients who underwent cardiac workup and subsequently cardiac valvular surgery without AF and concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) at our hospital were selected. Preoperative drug use and postoperative AF were recorded. AF was defined as any episode of AF longer than 10\u00a0s. In addition, results from echocardiography and blood samples were retrieved. RESULTS: BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS WERE AS FOLLOWS: mean age was 65\u2009\u00b1\u200911\u00a0years, 142 (52%) patients were male, 189 (70%) had undergone aortic valve surgery and the mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 57\u2009\u00b1\u200912%. Statins were used by 79 patients (29%).

However, the factors associated with the decrease of HbA1c remain unclear. In present study, we retrospectively compared glycemic control between groups receiving colestimide (n=71), atorvastatin (n=99), pravastatin (n=85), and pitavastatin (n=95) until 3 months after the start of treatment. In the colestimide group, fasting plasma glucose decreased significantly from 169 \u00b1 59 to 138 \u00b1 29 mg/dL after 3 months (P<0.01), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) declined from 8.1 \u00b1 1.0% to 7.4 \u00b1 0.8% (an 8% reduction, P<0.01). Fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c did not change in the pravastatin and pitavastatin groups. On the other hand, both parameters increased significantly in the atorvastatin group. Multivariate analysis revealed that baseline HbA1c was the main determinant of the decrease of HbA1c in the colestimide group while age, sex, BMI, and baseline lipid levels were not correlated with the effect of colestimide treatment. The decrease of HbA1c showed a positive correlation with baseline HbA1c (r=0.60, P<0.0001), and patients with a larger change of HbA1c (>8.4%) displayed a better response to colestimide. In conclusion, since patients with type 2 diabetes often have hyperlipidemia as well, colestimide therapy may have a clinically useful dual action in such patients. Baseline HbA1c has the most important independent influence on the glucose-lowering effect of colestimide.",

In the IE-Cpr-null mouse, which has little P450 activities in the IE, the oral bioavailability of LVS was substantially higher than that in wild-type (WT) mice (15 and 5%, respectively). In control experiments, the clearance rates were not different between the two strains, either for intraperitoneally dosed LVS, which bypasses SI metabolism, or for orally administered pravastatin, which is known to be poorly metabolized by P450. Thus, our results demonstrate a predominant role of SI P450 enzymes in the first-pass clearance of oral LVS. The absence of IE P450 activities in the IE-Cpr-null mice also facilitated the identification of the molecular targets for orally administered grapefruit juice (GFJ), which is known to inhibit LVS clearance in humans. We found that pretreatment of mice with oral GFJ enhanced the systemic exposure of LVS in WT, but not in IE-Cpr-null mice, a result suggesting that the main target of GFJ action in the small intestine is P450, but not P-gp.",

An interquartile-range increase in 8-week BC exposure (0.30 \u03bcg/m3) was associated with a 1.58% increase in sICAM-1 (95% confidence interval, 0.18-3.00%). Overall associations between sVCAM-1 and BC exposures were suggestive but not statistically significant. We found a significant interaction with diabetes-where diabetics were more susceptible to the effect of BC-for both sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1. We also observed an interaction with statin use, which was statistically significant for sVCAM-1 and suggestive for sICAM-1. We found no evidence of an interaction with obesity.",

    "56": "Several randomized studies and meta-analyses have suggested that pretreatment with statins may decrease periprocedural myocardial infarction (MI) in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The purpose of this randomized study was to investigate the effect of a 2-day atorvastatin therapy before PCI on long-term clinical outcome. Two hundred statin-naive patients with stable angina pectoris referred for PCI were enrolled and randomized (ratio 1:1) to 2-day pretreatment with atorvastatin 80 mg/day and subsequent PCI (atorvastatin group), or immediate PCI (control group). The registry group comprised 182 consecutive patients on long-term statin therapy referred for immediate PCI during the same period as randomized patients. We compared the first occurrence of MI or death during long-term follow-up. There were no significant differences in most clinical characteristics and early results among the 3 groups. Median follow-up was 45 months (1 to 59). Incidences of death/MI were 11.4%, 12.9%, and 13.8% in the atorvastatin, control, and registry groups, respectively. In the same groups, age-adjusted estimated 4-year freedom from death/MI was 0.78 versus 0.75 versus 0.80, respectively (p=0.882, log-rank test). In multivariate analysis, only age of patients (odds ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.07, p<0.001) was identified as a significant predictor of death or MI during follow-up. In conclusion, these results suggest that 2-day therapy with high-dose atorvastatin before PCI did not influence occurrence of periprocedural MI or long-term clinical outcomes.",

    "61": "We previously reported that the level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was higher in patients receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) than in patients on hemodialysis (HD). One of the problems associated with reaching the LDL-C target during statin treatment of patients on CAPD is the emergence of laboratory or clinical side effects. The present study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of daily combined treatment with ezetimibe 10 mg and simvastatin 10 mg in patients receiving CAPD. Our study enrolled 12 CAPD patients who were experiencing adverse effects from statin therapy. Their existing statin therapy was suspended for 1 month (\"washout period\"), and the patients were then shifted to treatment with the ezetimibe-simvastatin combination. The patients were again monitored for adverse events such as asthenia and myalgia during the subsequent 12 months. Body mass index and levels of glycated hemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, LDL-C, triglycerides, alanine amino-transferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatinine phosphokinase were also assessed. The combination of ezetimibe and low-dose simvastatin significantly reduced levels of total cholesterol (by a mean of 27%), triglycerides (by 9%), and LDL-C (by 33%) and increased levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (by 15%). In 11 patients (92%), the target LDL-C level of less than 100 mg/dL was reached. No significant change in weekly creatinine clearance occurred, and no serious adverse effects were observed. No patient developed muscle pain or weakness, and no increase in creatinine kinase was found. Residual renal function declined, although not significantly when compared with initial values. In conclusion, the present study suggests that combined ezetimibe and low-dose statin treatment is a promising approach for safe and effective primary treatment of dyslipidemia in CAPD patients.", 
    "62": "A model-based strategy was used to inform the early clinical development of anacetrapib, a novel cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor under development for the treatment of hyperlipidemia. The objectives of this model-based approach were to enable bridging variable pharmacokinetic effects, differences among formulations used in development, and to identify an appropriate dose for the phase III confirmatory program. Nonlinear mixed effects PK/PD models were initially developed based on data obtained from multiple phase I studies and later were updated with data from a phase IIb study. The population pharmacokinetic model described differences between the liquid-filled capsule used in phase I and phase IIb and the hot-melt extruded (HME) tablet formulation introduced in phase III, allowing for bridging of the two formulations, and quantified the complex relationship of apparent anacetrapib bioavailability with subject meal intake. Proportional E(max) models quantified the relationships between anacetrapib trough concentration and lipoprotein effects (LDL-C and HDL-C), with covariate effects of study population (normal volunteers vs. patients), and co-administration with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (\"statin\"). The interaction between anacetrapib and atorvastatin suggested pharmacological independence, i.e., that when given together, each agent exerts the same proportional lipid effect observed from monotherapy. Clinical trial simulation was used to examine the robustness of the effects to random dietary indiscretion, and found that the results were robust as long as patients generally adhered to a low-fat diet. These results allowed the selection of the 100 mg dose with the HME formulation for phase III development even though this dose and formulation were not specifically studied in a phase IIb trial.",

Statin adherence was measured by proportion of days covered (PDC) for a 6-month interval prior to each LDL-C test date. Patient demographic and clinical characteristics were used as covariates for LDL-C control and predictors for statin adherence. From 4,350 eligible subjects, 25,596 6-month PDC and LDL-C level pairs were formed between 2001 and 2009. Rates of suboptimal adherence and suboptimal LDL-C control were 68.5% and 46.6%, respectively. Positive predictors for LDL-C control included adherence to statin (OR: 1.87, p<0.0001) and older age (OR: 1.11, p=0.01). Significant risk factors for non-adherence were young age, female gender, African American race and newly-treated status.

    "69": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is also a progressive disease secondary to continuous structural remodelling of the atria due to AF itself, to changes associated with ageing, and to deterioration of underlying heart disease. Current management aims at preventing the recurrence of AF and its consequences (secondary prevention) and includes risk assessment and prevention of stroke, ventricular rate control, and rhythm control therapies including antiarrhythmic drugs and catheter or surgical ablation. The concept of primary prevention of AF with interventions targeting the development of substrate and modifying risk factors for AF has emerged as a result of recent experiments that suggested novel targets for mechanism-based therapies. Upstream therapy refers to the use of non-antiarrhythmic drugs that modify the atrial substrate- or target-specific mechanisms of AF to prevent the occurrence or recurrence of the arrhythmia. Such agents include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), statins, n-3 (\u03c9-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids, and possibly corticosteroids. Animal experiments have compellingly demonstrated the protective effect of these agents against electrical and structural atrial remodelling in association with AF. The key targets of upstream therapy are structural changes in the atria, such as fibrosis, hypertrophy, inflammation, and oxidative stress, but direct and indirect effects on atrial ion channels, gap junctions, and calcium handling are also applied. Although there have been no formal randomized controlled studies (RCTs) in the primary prevention setting, retrospective analyses and reports from the studies in which AF was a pre-specified secondary endpoint have shown a sustained reduction in new-onset AF with ACEIs and ARBs in patients with significant underlying heart disease (e.g. left ventricular dysfunction and hypertrophy), and in the incidence of AF after cardiac surgery in patients treated with statins. In the secondary prevention setting, the results with upstream therapies are significantly less encouraging. Although the results of hypothesis-generating small clinical studies or retrospective analyses in selected patient categories have been positive, larger prospective RCTs have yielded controversial, mostly negative, results. Notably, the controversy exists on whether upstream therapy may impact mortality and major non-fatal cardiovascular events in patients with AF. This has been addressed in retrospective analyses and large prospective RCTs, but the results remain inconclusive pending further reports. This review provides a contemporary evidence-based insight into the role of upstream therapies in primary (Part I) and secondary (Part II) prevention of AF.", 
    "70": "Aims There is increasing evidence that immune mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of heart failure (HF). The relationship between neopterin and the risk of HF has yet to be investigated on a large scale. We assessed the relationship between neopterin, a novel marker of monocyte activation, and risk of hospitalization for HF. Methods and results Among the subjects of Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 22 trial, 3946 had neopterin levels measured at study entry, on average 7 days after acute coronary syndrome (ACS). We assessed the relationship between neopterin and hospitalization for HF, and for death or HF over 2 years mean follow-up in a post hoc analysis using Cox regression models. Unadjusted hospitalization rates for HF increased across quartiles of neopterin, from 0.66 to 3.97 per 100 person-years. Per 1SD increment in log (neopterin), the adjusted risk of HF increased by 34% [hazard ratio (HR) 1.34, CI 1.10-1.64; P = 0.004]. Even after excluding individuals with a prior history of HF or recurrent ischaemic events, the relationship between neopterin and HF hospitalization remained significant. When added to a multivariable Cox model of HF-risk containing traditional risk factors, C-reactive protein and brain natriuretic protein (BNP), the further addition of neopterin significantly improved the HF-risk prediction model by likelihood ratio test analysis (P = 0.005), C-statistic (increasing from 0.743 to 0.773; P = 0.027), integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) analysis (P = 0.001), but not net reclassification improvement (NRI) analysis (P = 0.406). Similar results were obtained for the endpoint of death or HF. Conclusion Neopterin levels are an independent predictor of HF hospitalization, and improve risk prediction over and above conventional biomarkers.", 
    "71": "We previously reported that 10 mg/day of simvastatin significantly reduced clinical scores of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in active RA patients with hypercholesterolemia. In this study, we have investigated the mechanism by which simvastatin inhibits the production of the mediators of inflammation, such as pentraxin 3 (PTX3) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), from fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) derived from patients with RA.", 
    "72": "FLS from RA patients were cultured with 0-10 \u03bcM simvastatin for 24 h. ELISA and real-time PCR were used to quantitate the protein level and the mRNA level of PTX3 and MCP-1, respectively.", 
    "73": "Simvastatin both reduced the secretion of PTX3 and MCP-1 in FLS cultures and inhibited their mRNA expression in these cells. The effects of simvastatin were all completely reversed in the presence of mevalonic acid or geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, but not in the presence of farnesyl-pyrophosphate. The geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor GGTI-298 and the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 inhibited the production of PTX3 but not of MCP-1.", 
    "74": "Although simvastatin inhibited the production of PTX3 and MCP-1 in RA FLS, the mechanisms were quite different. It inhibits PTX3 production in a Rho-dependent manner but MCP-1 production in a Rho-independent manner. These results shed light on novel aspects of the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of simvastatin and may prove its important role in the treatment of rheumatic diseases.", 
    "75": "HMG-coA reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, account for the great majority of cholesterol-lowering drug use. However, little is known about the association between long-term statin use and incidence of most types of cancers. We examined the association between long-term use of cholesterol-lowering drugs, predominantly statins, and the incidence of ten common cancers, as well as overall cancer incidence, among 133,255 participants (60,059 men and 73,196 women) in the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort during the period from 1997 to 2007. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate relative risks (RR). Current use status and duration of use were updated during follow-up using information from biennial follow-up questionnaires. Current use of cholesterol-lowering drugs for five or more years was not associated with overall cancer incidence (RR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.92-1.03), or incidence of prostate, breast, colorectal, lung, bladder, renal cell, or pancreatic cancer but was associated with lower risk of melanoma (RR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.66-0.96), endometrial cancer (RR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.45-0.94), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; RR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.62-0.89). These results suggest that long-term use of statins is unlikely to substantially increase or decrease overall cancer risk. However, associations between long-term statin use and risk of endometrial cancer, melanoma, and NHL deserve further investigation.",

However, not all patients with low LDL-C levels show similar reduction in event rates. The residual risk factors associated with ongoing vascular events despite achieving low LDL-C levels remain to be elucidated. New data suggest that beyond statin therapy, inflammatory mediators, high non-HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol or apolipoprotein B, small dense LDL-C, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and lifestyle features may have impact on residual vascular risk. In this review, we discussed the significance of identifying these residual risk factors and developing new treatment strategies to further decrease vascular events.

Risk for VTE was examined in non-warfarin treated pravastatin (n = 2834) and placebo (n = 2865) patients using a Cox's proportional hazard model, and the impact of other risk factors assessed in a multivariate forward stepwise regression analysis. Baseline clinical characteristics, blood biochemistry and hematology variables, plasma levels of lipids and lipoproteins, and plasma markers of inflammation and adiposity were compared.

In a nested case control study of definite VTE, plasma Factor VIII levels were associated with VTE [1.52 (1.01, 2.28), p = 0.044]. However no other measure of thrombosis and haemostasis was associated with increased risk of VTE.",

From direct DNA sequencing, six SNPs were identified in the SLC10A1 gene and 14 SNPs in the SLC10A2 gene. Three of seven coding variants were non-synonymous SNPs: two variants from SLC10A1 (A64T, S267F) and one from SLC10A2 (A171S). No linkage was analysed in the SLC10A1 gene because of low frequencies of genetic variants, and the SLC10A2 gene was composed of two separated linkage disequilibrium blocks contrary to the white population. The stably transfected NTCP-A64T variant showed significantly decreased uptakes of taurocholate and rosuvastatin compared with wild-type NTCP. The decreased taurocholate uptake and increased rosuvastatin uptake were shown in the NTCP-S267F variant. The allele frequencies of these functional variants were 1.0% and 3.1%, respectively, in a Korean population. However, NTCP-A64T was not found in Chinese and Vietnamese subjects. The frequency distribution of NTCP-S267F in Koreans was significantly lower than those in Chinese and Vietnamese populations. Our data suggest that NTCP-A64T and -S267F variants cause substrate-dependent functional change in vitro, and show ethnic difference in their allelic frequencies among Asian populations although the clinical relevance of these variants is remained to be evaluated.",

The presentations should be considered preliminary, as further analyses may be done, which could alter the final publication of the results of these studies. PROTECT (ProBNP Outpatient Tailored Chronic Heart Failure Therapy) was designed to test the hypothesis that adjustment of intensity of chronic heart failure (HF) therapy on the basis of NT-proBNP plasma level monitoring would improve outcomes. The results provided some support of this concept, but needs further evaluation in larger, blinded trials. REVEAL (Reduction of Infarct Expansion and Ventricular Remodeling with erythropoietin after large myocardial infarctions) evaluated in the clinical setting of ischemia-reperfusion following STEMI that erythropoietin could salvage ischemic myocardium. The results did not show a reduction in infarct size, but, in contrast, an increase in adverse event rates in the erythropoietin group. GRAVITAS (Gauging Responsiveness with a VerifyNow assay-Impact on Thrombosis and Safety trial) investigated the effect of a standard vs. high maintenance clopidogrel dose in patients with stable myocardial ischemia or NSTEMI and drug-eluting stent insertion. Patients with high PRU values as determined by VerfyNow assay were randomized to 75 mg or 150 mg clopidogrel daily. The study did not show a significant difference in primary event rate between both groups. The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration Studies group evaluated the concept proposed in the JUPITER study that HDL levels on statin treatment may not provide useful prognostic information. The CTTC in a large sample size of statin-treated patients observed, on the contrary, a significantly increased risk of CV events, even in patients with low LDL cholesterol levels. DEFINE (Determining the Efficacy and Tolerability of CETP inhibition with Anacetrapib) evaluated possible safety aspects with the CETP inhibitor anacetrapib (increase in blood pressure). The study did not show adverse safety aspects, but significantly reduced LDL cholesterol and increased HDL cholesterol levels. ASSERT, a phase 2 dose-ranging study, investigated whether RVX-208 would increase Apo-A1 production. Apo-A1 may induce cholesterol efflux from macrophages and facilitate atherosclerosis regression. The study did not meet its primary endpoint, but significant prominent effects on lipids were found. ASCEND-HF was a large trial of nesiritide in >7000 patients with acute heart failure. The study did not show convincing symptom benefit, but on the other hand did not show harmful effects of nesiritide. EMPHASIS-HF evaluated the long term effects of eplerenone in patients with mild (NYHA class II) heart failure and systolic dysfunction. The study was prematurely ended because of highly significant beneficial effects. CUPID (Calcium Up-regulation by Percutaneous administration of gene therapy In cardiac Disease) is the first human study with gene transfer of SERCA2a (AVV1/SERCA2a: Mydicar).

    "94": "Children who appear healthy, even if they have one or more recognized cardiovascular risk factors, do not generally have outcomes of cardiovascular or other vascular disease during childhood. Historically, pediatric medicine has not aggressively screened for or treated cardiovascular risk factors in otherwise healthy children. However, studies such as the P-Day Study (Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth), and the Bogalusa Heart Study, indicate that healthy children at remarkably young ages can have evidence of significant atherosclerosis. With the increasing prevalence of pediatric obesity, can we expect more health problems related to the consequences of pediatric dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and atherosclerosis in the future? For many years, medications have been available and used in adult populations to treat dyslipidemia. In recent years, reports of short-term safety of some of these medications in children have been published. However, none of these studies have detailed long-term follow-up, and therefore none have described potential late side-effects of early cholesterol-lowering therapy, or potential benefits in terms of reduction of or delay in cardiovascular or other vascular end-points. In 2007, the American Heart Association published a scientific statement on the use of cholesterol-lowering therapy in pediatric patients. In this review paper, we discuss some of the current literature on cholesterol-lowering therapy in children, including the statins that are currently available for use in children, and some of the cautions with using these and other cholesterol-lowering medications. A central tenet of this review is that medications are not a substitute for dietary and lifestyle interventions, and that even in children on cholesterol-lowering medications, physicians should take every opportunity to encourage children and their parents to make healthy diet and lifestyle choices.",

However, both procedures are quite time-consuming and need relatively high volume of solvent/sample, which is impractical for the routine analyses of many biological samples. The aim of this work was to develop and validate more suitable sample preparation method for the determination of atorvastatin and its metabolites in biological samples using MEPS (microextraction by packed sorbent). The optimal conditions of MEPS extraction were using C8 sorbent and only 50 \u03bcl of the sample. The analytes were eluted by 100 \u03bcl of the mixture of acetonitrile:0.1 M ammonium acetate pH 4.5 (95:5, v:v). The analytical method was validated and demonstrated good linearity (r(2)>0.9990), recovery (89-115%) and intra-day precision (RSD<10%). Total time of the sample preparation was three times shorter (7 min) compared to SPE. The volume of sample was twenty times lower and the volume of solvents about ten times lower compared to SPE.

Lipids, inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, soluble CD40 ligand and oxidized LDL), and platelet aggregation (platelet function analyzer [PFA]-100) changes were determined. Baseline lipids, inflammatory markers and PFA-100 were similar between groups.

Both hemoglobinemia and myoglobinemia are independent predictors of postoperative AKI. Release of free hemeproteins into the circulation is known to cause oxidative injury to the kidneys. This study tested the hypothesis that postoperative AKI is associated with both enhanced intraoperative hemeprotein release and increased lipid peroxidation assessed by measuring F\u2082-isoprostanes and isofurans. In a case-control study nested within an ongoing randomized trial of perioperative statin treatment and AKI, we compared levels of F\u2082-isoprostanes and isofurans with plasma levels of free hemoglobin and myoglobin in 10 cardiac surgery AKI patients to those of 10 risk-matched controls. Peak plasma free hemoglobin concentrations were significantly higher in AKI subjects (289.0 \u00b1 37.8 versus 104.4 \u00b1 36.5mg/dl, P = 0.01), whereas plasma myoglobin concentrations were similar between groups. The change in plasma F\u2082-isoprostane and isofuran levels (repeated-measures ANOVA, P = 0.02 and P = 0.001, respectively) as well as the change in urine isofuran levels (P = 0.04) was significantly greater in AKI subjects. In addition, change in peak plasma isofuran levels correlated not only with peak free plasma hemoglobin concentrations (r\u00b2 = 0.39, P = 0.001) but also with peak change in serum creatinine (r\u00b2 = 0.20, P = 0.01). Postoperative AKI is associated with both enhanced intraoperative hemeprotein release and enhanced lipid peroxidation. The correlations among hemoglobinemia, lipid peroxidation, and AKI indicate a potential role for hemeprotein-induced oxidative damage in the pathogenesis of postoperative AKI.",

We report the effects of high-dose atorvastatin therapy on cerebral vasomotor reactivity (VMR) in patients with controlled hypertension and dyslipidemia. We prospectively enrolled 36 patients with controlled hypertension and a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration >100 mg/dL. Atorvastatin 80 mg was given daily for 6 months and then discontinued. VMR was assessed by hypercapnic and hypocapnic transcranial Doppler challenge in both the right and left middle cerebral artery (MCA) at baseline, and after 3 and 6 months of therapy. Forty-five days after statin cessation, a repeat VMR was performed. VMR impairment was defined as \u226470%. Blood pressure, lipid levels, liver function, and creatine kinase level were monitored. Mean patient age was 60 years, 16 were men, and 13 had a previous history of subcortical infarction. Mean LDL cholesterol level before treatment was 154 \u00b1 30 mg/dL. Atorvastatin lowered LDL by 53% at 3 months and by 46% at 6 months. Baseline VMR was 71% \u00b1 21% in the right MCA and 70% \u00b1 19% in the left MCA. No significant effect of atorvastatin on VMR was seen at 3 months and 6 months in the study population as a whole. In the subgroup of patients with baseline VMR impairment, atorvastatin therapy was associated with significantly improved VMR at both 3 and 6 months. This effect persisted for at least 45 days after discontinuation of therapy. Our findings indicate that high-dose atorvastatin therapy can significantly improve impaired cerebral VMR, and that the effects of atorvastatin on VMR persist for 1.5 months after discontinuation of therapy. We found no benefit of atorvastatin therapy in patients with preserved baseline vasoreactivity.",

Atorvastatin, a widely used statin, is presently inadequately investigated in vivo with regard to effects on CYP2C9 activity in human beings. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of atorvastatin on the activity of CYP2C9 in a group of Turkish hypercholesterolaemic patients. We prospectively investigated the atorvastatin effect on CYP2C9 activity in a sample of Turkish hypercholesterolaemia patients (11 women, 7 men) who commenced atorvastatin (10 mg/day). Losartan was used as a probe drug to determine CYP2C9 metabolic activity. A single 25-mg oral dose of losartan was given to the patients before, on the first day and after the fourth week of the atorvastatin treatment. Urinary concentrations of losartan and its metabolite, E3174, were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Urinary losartan/E3174 ratios were used as an index of CYP2C9 activity. As the baseline enzyme activity may influence the extent of drug-drug interactions, the CYP2C9*2 and 2C9*3 alleles were identified by using PCR-RFLP. In the patients with the CYP2C9*1*1 genotype (n = 12), atorvastatin treatment did not cause a significant change in losartan/E3174 ratios (medians; 95% CI) neither after the first day (0.73; 0.34-1.61) nor at the fourth week (0.71; 0.36-1.77) of the treatment as compared with the baseline activity (0.92; 0.57-1.74, p = 0.38).

Biomarkers can additionally be used to increase accuracy in predicting complications and mortality. Etiologic diagnosis of pneumonia continues to pose a challenge to clinicians. With the experience acquired in the 2009 AH1/N1 influenza pandemic, virological diagnosis of pneumonia by rapid polymerase chain reaction techniques has recently begun to be used. Experience has also been gained in antiviral treatment and complications, especially bacterial superinfection as the main unfavorable event in viral pneumonias.

Herein, we hypothesized that simvastatin may attenuate neutrophil activation and lung damage in abdominal sepsis. Male C57BL/6 mice were pretreated with simvastatin (0.5 or 10 mg/kg) before CLP. In separate groups, mice received an anti-CD40L antibody or a CXCR2 antagonist (SB225002) prior to CLP. BALF and lung tissue were harvested for analysis of neutrophil infiltration, as well as edema and CXC chemokine formation. Blood was collected for analysis of Mac-1 and CD40L expression on neutrophils and platelets, as well as soluble CD40L in plasma. Simvastatin decreased CLP-induced neutrophil infiltration and edema formation in the lung. Moreover, Mac-1 expression increased on septic neutrophils, which was significantly attenuated by simvastatin. Inhibition of CD40L reduced CLP-induced up-regulation of Mac-1 on neutrophils. Simvastatin prevented CD40L shedding from the surface of platelets and reduced circulating levels of CD40L in septic mice. CXC chemokine-induced migration of neutrophils in vitro was decreased greatly by simvastatin. Moreover, simvastatin abolished CLP-evoked formation of CXC chemokines in the lung, and a CXCR2 antagonist attenuated pulmonary accumulation of neutrophils. Our data suggest that the inhibitory effect of simvastatin on pulmonary accumulation of neutrophils may be related to a reduction of CD40L secretion into the circulation, as well as a decrease in CXC chemokine formation in the lung. Thus, these protective mechanisms help to explain the beneficial actions exerted by statins, such as simvastatin, in sepsis.",

The primary endpoint was changes in non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C) levels. Study participants were randomly allocated to receive rosuvastatin 40 mg (n = 30, R group), rosuvastatin 10 mg plus fenofibrate 200 mg (n = 30, RF group) or rosuvastatin 10 mg plus n-3 fatty acids 2 g (n = 30, RN group). Non-HDL-C levels were reduced in all groups: in R group by 54%, in RF group by 42% and in RN group by 42%. Significant reductions in total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein (LDL)-C and triglyceride levels were observed in all groups. The reductions in total and LDL-C were greatest in the R group while a more pronounced reduction of triglycerides in the RF group compared with that in the R and the RN group was observed. HDL-C levels were significantly increased only in the RF group. In conclusion, high doses of rosuvastatin and small doses of rosuvastatin plus either fenofibrate or n-3 fatty acids exhibit favorable effects on both LDL-C and non-HDL-C levels. However, rosuvastatin monotherapy more potently reduces these parameters. The combination of rosuvastatin plus fenofibrate leads to a greater decrease in triglyceride levels and a greater increase in HDL-C levels compared with the other two treatments. While awaiting the results of ongoing trials high doses of rosuvastatin may represent the treatment of choice in individuals with mixed dyslipidemia.",

Whereas a farnesylated polypeptide is normally removed from the carboxyl-terminus of prelamin A during endoproteolytic processing to lamin A, progerin lacks the cleavage site and remains farnesylated. Cultured cells from human subjects with HGPS and genetically modified mice expressing progerin have nuclear morphological abnormalities, which are reversed by inhibitors of protein farnesylation. In addition, treatment with protein farnesyltransferase inhibitors improves whole animal phenotypes in mouse models of HGPS. However, improvement in nuclear morphology in tissues after treatment of animals has not been demonstrated. We therefore treated transgenic mice that express progerin in epidermis with the protein farnesyltransferase inhibitor FTI-276 or a combination of pravastatin and zoledronate to determine if they reversed nuclear morphological abnormalities in tissue. Immunofluorescence microscopy and \"blinded\" electron microscopic analysis demonstrated that systemic administration of FTI-276 or pravastatin plus zoledronate significantly improved nuclear morphological abnormalities in keratinocytes of transgenic mice. These results show that pharmacological blockade of protein prenylation reverses nuclear morphological abnormalities that occur in HGPS in vivo. They further suggest that skin biopsy may be useful to determine if protein farnesylation inhibitors are exerting effects in subjects with HGPS in clinical trials.",

The use of inhibitors of prenylation has proven to be a useful tool in the activation of apoptotic pathways in tumor cell lines. Rab geranylgeranyl transferase (Rab GGT) is responsible for the prenylation of the Rab family. Overexpression of Rab GGTbeta has been identified in CHOP refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Using a cell line-based model for CHOP resistant DLBCL, we show that treatment with simvastatin, which inhibits protein farnesylation and geranylgeranylation, sensitizes DLBCL cells to cytotoxic treatment. Treatment with the farnesyl transferase inhibitor FTI-277 or the geranylgeranyl transferase I inhibitor GGTI-298 indicates that the reduction in cell viability was restricted to inhibition of geranylgeranylation. In addition, treatment with BMS1, a combined inhibitor of farnesyl transferase and Rab GGT, resulted in a high cytostatic effect in WSU-NHL cells, demonstrated by reduced cell viability and decreased proliferation. Co-treatment of BMS1 or GGTI-298 with CHOP showed synergistic effects with regard to markers of apoptosis.

On the basis of this clinical trial evidence, progressively lower LDL-C goals for increasing numbers of patients, stratified by absolute CVD risk, have been recommended in guidelines for cholesterol management and CVD prevention. Some notable exceptions have been made, however, such as patients with end-stage renal disease or heart failure. To achieve low LDL-C goals, statins are first-line pharmacological therapy and can be combined with other agents to provide additional reductions in LDL-C levels as well as improvements in other lipoprotein fractions. Investigational agents that reduce LDL-C levels by other mechanisms are under development and could provide additional therapeutic strategies to achieve optimal LDL-C levels.

    "200": "Pulmonary fibrosis was induced by intratracheal administration of bleomycin in 30 female rats, which were further divided into two groups: Group M (without treatment) and Group A (treated with atorvastatin 10 mg/kg); control group (n = 5, Group C) was intratracheally administrated with same volume of saline. Five animals were sacrificed at 2 weeks (M2 and A2), 4 weeks (M4 and A4) and 6 weeks (M6 and A6) after model establishment, respectively. Lung tissue samples were harvested and prepared for HE and Masson's trichrome staining. Concentrations of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in BALF and serum were measured by ELISA.", 
    "201": "The severity of inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis was significantly reduced in Group A than that in Group M, especially at week 6. No significant difference was noted in the serum concentrations of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 among the Group M, A and Group C. The BALF concentrations of MMP-9 in Group M2 and M6 were significantly higher than those in Group C (P < 0.01 and 0.05), whereas those in the atorvastatin groups (A2, A4 and A6) were lower than those in M2, M4 and M6. Although the MMP-9 was still higher in Groups A2 and A4 than in the Group C, there was no significant difference in MMP-9 between Group A6 and Group C. TIMP-1 levels in BALF were significantly higher in M4 and M6 than Group C (P < 0.01 and 0.05), there were no significant differences between Group M2 and Group C. The TIMP-1 levels in BALF of atorvastatin groups were significantly lower than those of model groups and control group (P < 0.01 and 0.05), which resulted in a significantly increased ratio of MMP-9 to TIMP-1 in the atorvastatin groups.", 
    "202": "Atorvastatin inhibits the synthesis and release of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in the lung tissue of rats with bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and has no significant effect on circulating MMP-9 and TIMP-1, which may be associated with the attenuation of experimental pulmonary fibrosis in rats.",

    "207": "Although there has been tremendous improvement in managing chronic kidney disease (CKD) with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in the last 15 years, CKD still progresses. Therefore, new emerging strategies are needed. The gold standard still lies with optimum renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade, although many questions remain about how this is best achieved, such as regarding the efficacy of combinations of ACE inhibitor and ARBs, supramaximal doses of ARBs alone and combinations of either ACE inhibitor or ARBs with direct renin inhibitors, antialdosterone agents. Other promising molecules currently being tested are endothelin receptor antagonists and glitazones. Also, the role of other current therapies being used during CKD, including statins, vitamin D and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, will be discussed, as these may also exert nephroprotective effects.", 
    "208": "Midlife cardiovascular risk factors, including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipemia, and an unhealthy lifestyle, have been linked to subsequent incidence, delay of onset, and progression rate of Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia. Conversely, optimal treatment of cardiovascular risk factors prevents and slows down age-related cognitive disorders. The impact of antihypertensive therapy on cognitive outcome in patients with hypertension was assessed in large trials which demonstrated a reduction in progression of MRI white matter hyperintensities, in cognitive decline and in incidence of dementia. Large-scale database correlated statin use and reduction in the incidence of dementia, mainly in patients with documented atherosclerosis, but clinical trials failed to reach similar conclusions. Whether a multitargeted intervention would substantially improve protection, quality of life, and reduce medical cost expenditures in patients with lower risk profile has not been ascertained. This would require appropriately designed trials targeting large populations and focusing on cognitive decline as a primary outcome endpoint.", 
    "209": "Statins may be important for the prevention and management of sepsis; however, through their impact on ubiquinone synthesis, they may impair mitochondrial and organ function in the septic patient. Here we provide a narrative review of the function and roles of ubiquinone in cellular metabolism, the interactions with statins, and the potential consequences in the critically ill.", 
    "210": "Literature search using the PubMed database. Search terms included statins, mitochondria, ubiquinone, and sepsis.", 
    "211": "Statins are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors and act by decreasing mevalonate levels, a precursor for cholesterol synthesis. However, mevalonate is also a precursor for ubiquinone, an integral component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and an important antioxidant. Plasma ubiquinone is inversely related to statin levels, and impaired statin metabolism or excretion can decrease ubiquinone levels markedly. This is potentially important as critical illness markedly impairs statin metabolism. As mitochondrial dysfunction may be a major contributor to sepsis-induced organ failure, it is plausible that low ubiquinone levels may exacerbate mitochondrial and organ dysfunction. Furthermore, although the clinical relevance of low ubiquinone levels is currently unknown in the critically ill, this is often cited as a possible cause of the myopathy and rhabdomyolysis associated with statin use.", 
    "212": "In the present study, we tested our hypothesis that atorvastatin exerts its anti-inflammation effect via suppressing LPS-induced rapid upregulation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) mRNA and its downstream p38, ERK, and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways in human umbilical-vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). TLR4 mRNA expression and its downstream kinase activities induced by LPS alone or atorvastatin + LPS in endothelial cells were quantified using quantitative real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Preincubation of LPS-stimulated endothelial cells with TLR4 siRNA was conducted to identify the target of the anti-inflammatory effects of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin incubation resulted in the reduction of LPS-induced TLR4 mRNA expression, ERK1/2 and P38 MAPK phosphorylation, and NF-\u03baB binding activity. Pretreatment with MEK/ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 attenuated atorvastatin + LPS-induced NF-\u03baB activity but had no effect on P38 MAPK phosphorylation. In contrast, pretreatment with P38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 resulted in upregulation of atorvastatin + LPS-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation but had no significant effects on NF-\u03baB activity. On the other hand, blocking NF-\u03baB with SN50 produced no effects on atorvastatin + LPS-induced ERK1/2 and P38 MAPK phosphorylation. Moreover, TLR4 gene silencing produced the same effects as the atorvastatin treatment. In conclusion, atorvastatin downregulated TLR4 mRNA expression by two distinct signaling pathways. First, atorvastatin stabilized I\u03ba-B\u03b1, which directly inhibited NF-\u03baB activation. Second, atorvastatin inactivated ERK phosphorylation, which indirectly inhibited NF-\u03baB activation. Suppression of p38 MAPK by atorvastatin upregulates ERK but exerts no effect on NF-\u03baB.", 
    "213": "Cyr61 is associated with growth and progression of many types of tumors and is an independent poor prognostic indicator for oral cancer patients. Areca nut (AN) chewing is the most important etiological factor in the pathogenesis of oral cancer in India and many Southeast Asian countries. Yet, the molecular mechanisms involved in the AN-induced oral cancer remain largely unknown. In this study, we show that arecoline, a main alkaloid found in AN, stimulated Cyr61 synthesis in human gingival epithelial S-G cells. Constitutive overexpression of Cyr61 protein in oral epithelial cells during AN chewing may play a role in the pathogenesis of oral cancer. ERK inhibitor PD98059, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) selective inhibitor Y-27632 and a geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor reduced the arecoline-stimulated levels of Cyr61 protein by \u223c31%, 47%, 65% and 100%, respectively. Lovastatin also completely inhibited arecoline-induced Cyr61 synthesis and the inhibition is dose-dependent. Decreased of geranylgeranylated proteins could be the mechanism that lovastatin regulates Cyr61 synthesis and lovastatin could serve as a useful agent in controlling AN-induced oral cancer.", 
    "214": "There is increasing evidence that renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may play a major role in the actively regulated fibrocalcific process in aortic valve stenosis (AS), but the gene expression or function of (pro)renin receptor ((P)RR), prorenin and renin or angiotensin converting enzyme 2(ACE2)/angiotensin-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis in calcific aortic valve disease is not known.", 
    "215": "We characterized expression of (P)RR, ACE2 and Mas receptor as well as renin, prorenin and angiotensin II type 2 (AT(2)) receptors in human aortic valves, and compared normal control valves (n = 11) with valves obtained from patients with aortic regurgitation (AR, n = 14), AR with fibrosis (n = 20) and AS (n = 61). By immunohistochemistry (P)RR positive staining was seen in the valvular endothelial cells of control and in the neovessels of stenotic valves. By RT-PCR, renin mRNA levels were 72% (P = 0.001) and prorenin mRNA levels 64% lower (P = 0.002) in stenotic aortic valves compared to control valves. ACE2, Mas receptor and AT(2)-receptor mRNA levels were 69% (P < 0.001), 58% (P = 0.008) and 75% (P = 0.001) lower, respectively, in stenotic valves. ACE2 positive staining, existing to lesser extent in stenotic aortic valves, was localized mainly to stromal area in spongiosa layer in control valves.",

    "217": "Increasing evidence indicates that phospholipid oxidation plays important roles in atherosclerosis. Here, we investigated the involvement of Rho-family GTPases inphosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide (PCOOH)-induced THP-1 cell adhesion to ICAM-1. Isoprenoid depletion by fluvastatin and geranylgeranyltransferase inhibition by GGTI-286 suppressed PCOOH-induced cell adhesion to ICAM-1 and F-actin-rich membrane protrusion formation. Pull-down assays demonstrated the activation of Rac1 and Rac2 in PCOOH-treated cells. Pan-Rho-family GTPase inhibitor Clostridium difficile toxin B, Rac-specific inhibitor NSC23776, and RNA interference of the Rac isoforms suppressed the cell adhesion. These findings indicate the involvement of Rac GTPase activation in PCOOH-induced cell adhesion to ICAM-1 via actin reorganization.",
