Whether the effect of statins is due to a local inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in the brain or whether it is mediated by the reduced levels of cholesterol in the circulation is not known. In the present work, we tested the possibility that high doses of lipophilic and hydrophilic statins, simvastatin and pravastatin, respectively, or a diet high in cholesterol could affect cholesterol homeostasis in the brain of guinea pigs. The total brain cholesterol levels were not affected by high-dose simvastatin or pravastatin treatment. Significantly lower levels of the cholesterol precursor lathosterol and its ratio to cholesterol were found in the brains of simvastatin and pravastatin-treated animals. 24S-Hydroxycholesterol, the transportable form of cholesterol across the blood-brain barrier, was significantly lower in the brain of pravastatin-treated animals. Excessive cholesterol feeding resulted in higher serum cholesterol levels but did not affect total brain cholesterol level. However, de novo cholesterol synthesis in the brain seemed to be down-regulated, as indicated by lower absolute levels and cholesterol-related ratios of lathosterol compared with controls. The passage of deuterium-labeled cholesterol across the blood-brain barrier in one animal was found to be approximately 1%. Our results suggest that brain cholesterol synthesis in guinea pigs can be slightly, but significantly, influenced by high doses of lipophilic and hydrophilic statins as well as by high dietary cholesterol intake, while total brain cholesterol content and thus, cholesterol homeostasis is maintained.",

Carotid plaques retrieved at CEA from patients taking statins revealed significantly lower concentrations of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (p = 0.0176), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (p = 0.0018), and interleukin-6 (p = 0.0005).",

LIPS was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial undertaken in 77 centres (predominantly in Europe). Patients included in the trial had moderate hypercholesterolaemia and had successfully undergone their first PCI. Fluvastatin (Lescol) 40 mg twice daily plus dietary counselling was given to the intervention group for up to 4 years; the control group received dietary counselling only. A Markov model was used to estimate the incremental costs per QALY gained over a 10-year period, with cost data drawn from the UK NHS (2002 values). Monte Carlo simulations and multivariate analysis were used to assess uncertainty. Costs were discounted at 6% per annum, and health outcomes at 1.5% per annum.",

The incremental cost per QALY gained with fluvastatin versus the control group was pound 3207 (SD pound 5,497) [euro 4,527; SD euro 7,759]. Fluvastatin was dominant (better outcomes and lower costs) in 15.9% of the simulations and was dominated in 2.9%. The key determinants of cost effectiveness were: the effectiveness of fluvastatin in reducing acute myocardial infarction, subsequent PCI, coronary artery bypass graft and cardiac deaths; the utility weight associated with a subsequent post-PCI state; the cost of fluvastatin; and the time horizon evaluated.",

Experimental studies demonstrate inhibitory effects of natural estrogens on the progression of atherosclerosis. In contrast, results from recent hormone replacement trials using conjugated equine estrogens and medroxyprogesterone acetate in postmenopausal women showed no effects or even an increase in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality such as thrombosis or stroke. Therefore, conjugated equine estrogens alone or in combination with medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be recommended for the prevention or treatment of cardiovascular disease.

At 18 weeks, LDL-C reductions were also significantly greater in both rosuvastatin groups than in the atorvastatin group (52% [P <.01], 59% [P <.001] vs 47%). Consequently, more patients receiving rosuvastatin achieved LDL-C goals. Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), non-HDL-C, apolipoproteins B and A-I, and all lipid ratios were more favorably modified by rosuvastatin at 24 weeks (P <.01).

Here we look whether immediate endothelial effect of statins is associated with mobilization of intracellular calcium ions [Ca2+]i in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). We analyzed the effects of various statins (atorvastatin, cerivastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin and pravastatin at concentration of 10-30 microM) on [Ca2+]i in BAEC in comparison to responses induced by bradykinin (Bk) (10 nM), adenosine diphosphate (1 microM), acetylcholine (100 nM), adrenaline (10 microM), serotonin (10 microM) or calcium ionophore A 23187 (0.1 microM) using FURA-2 according to fluorimetric method of Grynkiewicz et al. Basal [Ca2+]i level in BAEC was between 60 and 100 nM. Bk was the most potent to induce [Ca2+]i response. Delta[Ca2+]i induced by Bk was 331.9 +/- 19.49 nM (n = 36). Delta[Ca2+]i induced by statins (30 microM), i.e. atorvastatin, cerivastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin and pravastatin were 66.4 +/- 7.38% (n = 6), 54.8 +/- 10.12% (n = 5), 58.8 +/- 13.9% (n = 8), 27.7 +/- 7.19% (n = 5) and 0% (n = 5) of the response induced by Bk (10 nM), respectively. In summary, all statins tested, except pravastatin, induce immediate increase in [Ca2+]i in endothelium. This pleiotropic activity of statins in endothelium, most likely not related to the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, may represent an intracellular correlate for the immediate release of NO and PGI2 by these drugs that was reported by us previously.",

    "22": "Recent experimental observations have suggested that statins may exert modulatory effects on a number of pathobiological processes beyond their cholesterol-lowering properties. Some of the pleiotropic effects of statins seem to be mediated by their ability to block the synthesis of isoprenoid intermediates, which serve as important lipid attachments required for the proper function and activation of the small GTP-binding proteins. The current study explored the modulatory effects of simvastatin (SMV) on the angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced Rac1-mediated, upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27. Ang II (100 nM) stimulation of rat mesangial cells induced a significant increase in p27 protein expression. Co-treatment of cells with SMV (1 microM) inhibited Ang II-induced upregulation of p27 protein. Addition of mevalonate (200 microM) or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (5 microM) reversed the inhibitory effect of SMV on p27 protein expression, suggesting that the effect of SMV is geranylgeranyl dependent. This study also provides evidence for a sequential link between Ang II stimulation and downstream activation of Rac1, intracellular H2O2 production, and Akt kinase leading to upregulation of p27 protein in mesangial cells. It was also shown that SMV, by inhibiting Rac1 activity, reversed Ang II-induced increase in intracellular H2O2 production, Akt activation, and p27 protein expression. The data presented in this study not only elucidate Ang II-mediated signaling cascade in mesangial cells but also demonstrate for the first time the modulatory effects of SMV on Ang II-induced signaling pathway at the cell cycle level.", 
    "23": "In August 2001, cerivastatin was removed from European and USA markets because of a higher risk of rhabdomyolysis associated with its use in comparison with other statins. The objective of this study was to compare cholesterol-lowering drug use in Italy before and after the withdrawal of cerivastatin from the market, and to evaluate if the withdrawal influenced patients compliance and physicians prescribing habits. After August 2001, 48% of cerivastatin users discontinued any statin treatment. The major risk factor for discontinuation was a concomitant use of fibrate during the first 7 months of 2001 (OR = 2.3; 95% CI = -2.9). Comparing the discontinuation of statin therapy between 2001 and 2000 we can estimate that there was a 5% increase, corresponding to about 200,000 patients, who discontinued statin therapy during autumn 2001 because of cerivastatin emergency.", 
    "24": "Mechanisms for the regulation of intracellular cholesterol levels in various types of brain and vascular cells are of considerable importance in our understanding of the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases, particularly atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is increasingly clear that conversion of brain cholesterol into 24-hydroxycholesterol and its subsequent release into the periphery is important for the maintenance of brain cholesterol homeostasis. Recent studies have shown elevated plasma concentrations of 24-hydroxycholesterol in patients with AD and vascular dementia, suggesting increased brain cholesterol turnover during neurodegeneration. The oxygenases involved in the degradation and excretion of cholesterol, including the cholesterol 24-hydroxylase and the 27-hydroxylase, are enzymes of the cytochrome P-450 family. This review focuses on the newly recognized importance of cholesterol and its oxygenated metabolites in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke and AD. The reduction in stroke and AD risk in patients treated with cholesterol-lowering statins is also discussed.", 
    "25": "The anti-atherogenic properties of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have been well established in several circulatory beds. Increasing evidence suggests that statins may help attenuate ischemia-reperfusion injury, a beneficial effect that may be related to the antioxidant capabilities of statins; however, this remains controversial. We performed this study to determine whether the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor cerivastatin can prevent oxidative stress-induced injury in cultured human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC). The HAEC were subjected to oxidative stress in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of cerivastatin (50 nM-1,000 nM). Oxidative stress was induced by increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide or endogenous superoxide anions generated by the inhibition of superoxide dismutase using diethylthiocarbamate (10 mM). Cell viability and mitochondrial activity were measured by mitochondria-dependent 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) conversion. Cell morphology was also examined using light microscopy. Exposing HAEC to cerivastatin for 24 hours had no effect on cell viability using both cell morphology and MTT conversion: the HAEC incubated in 100 nM cerivastatin had 90% +/- 2.2% viability of the control. As expected, hydrogen peroxide produced a concentration-dependent decrease in cell viability. Varying concentrations of cerivastatin pretreatment for < or = 18 hours showed no protection of HAEC against hydrogen peroxide-induced injury. As a positive control, the prototype antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine was cytoprotective even with the highest hydrogen peroxide concentration. Neither cerivastatin nor N-acetyl-L-cysteine protected HAEC against diethylthiocarbamate-induced oxidative injury at any concentration. In this study, cerivastatin did not protect cultured HAEC against oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide or diethylthiocarbamate.",

Today, we know that although treatment of CHD may reduce some of those deaths, it is the prevention that is the real answer to eliminating this national scourge. The key to prevention lies in identifying those persons who are at risk for developing CHD and reducing the primary risk factor--hyperlipidemia. Preventing or controlling hyperlipidemia involves therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) and antilipidemic medications. In part 1, two useful medications--niacin and fibric acid derivatives--were discussed; in this second section, three other classes of drugs used as antilipidemics--bile-acid binding resins, the newer intestinal sterol absorption inhibitors and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (the statins)--are reviewed. Knowledgeable nurses will be able to help educate patients about these drugs and their importance in preventing or controlling hyperlipidemia.", 
    "27": "Advances in vascular biology have shown that inflammation plays an integral role in the development of cardiovascular disease. Extensive study of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) has demonstrated that this measure of inflammation predicts cardiovascular risk not reflected by traditional risk factors, adds prognostic information to traditional risk assessment, and predicts long-term cardiovascular risk in individuals with no prior evidence of cardiovascular disease. Patients with elevated hs-CRP levels in the absence of elevated cholesterol appear to derive preventive benefit from statin therapy that is similar in magnitude to that in patients with elevated cholesterol. The large-scale Justification for the Use of statins in Primary prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosvastatin (JUPITER) trial represents a critical study to determine the utility of a strategy for targeting statin therapy to prevent incident cardiovascular disease in patients at increased cardiovascular risk on the basis of elevated hs-CRP who would not be considered candidates for therapy on the basis of hypercholesterolemia or traditional risk assessment. Inclusion of hs-CRP measurement in risk screening and use of this information to guide preventive therapy could result in a marked improvement in prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.", 
    "28": "Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction with statin treatment remains the cornerstone of lipid-lowering therapy to reduce risk of coronary heart disease. Combination therapy with a statin poses advantages in certain settings and may allow use of lower doses of multiple drugs rather than maximum doses of a single drug. Bile-acid sequestrants or the cholesterol-absorption inhibitor ezetimibe can be added to a statin to achieve greater LDL cholesterol reductions. Niacin or fenofibrate can be added to a statin for treatment of mixed dyslipidemia. Differences in statin efficacy in reducing LDL cholesterol and meeting recommended LDL cholesterol targets as well as differences among these agents in beneficial effects on other lipid parameters can affect whether and how these agents are prescribed in monotherapy and combination therapy.", 
    "29": "Reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol with statins have been shown to significantly reduce risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in the primary- and secondary-prevention settings. Benefit has been observed even in high-risk patients whose baseline LDL cholesterol levels were below the drug initiation levels recommended by current treatment guidelines. Levels of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or total apolipoprotein B more accurately reflect circulating levels of atherogenic particles than does LDL cholesterol concentration, and may provide a surrogate marker that correlates better to CHD event reduction after statin therapy than LDL cholesterol level. More effective lipid-lowering therapy than that currently practiced may be needed in many patients to achieve optimal CHD risk reduction.", 
    "30": "In vitro inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase causes the suppression of liver X receptor (LXR) activity. Because LXR regulates the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC) A1, which is involved in the high-density lipoprotein-related reverse cholesterol transport pathway, we examined the effects of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor pravastatin on ABCA1 expression in vitro and in vivo. Pravastatin (10 microM) significantly reduced the transcript levels of murine ABCA1 gene by 35% in RAW264.7 macrophages under a lipoprotein-deficient condition. The inhibition was due to the decreased mevalonic acid production because addition of exogenous mevalonic acid restored ABCA1 mRNA levels. In addition, cholesterol and 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol thoroughly blunted the inhibition. Furthermore, pravastatin did not decrease ABCA1 mRNA and protein levels in HepG2 hepatocytes even in the absence of exogenous LXR agonists. Oral dosing of pravastatin (0.1% concentration in drinking water) for 24 h or 2 weeks to mice did not decrease ABCA1 mRNA and protein levels in the liver and leukocytes. Interestingly, pravastatin significantly increased both hepatic and leukocyte LXRalpha mRNA levels. Thus, although HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors suppress ABCA1 mRNA expression in the absence of LXR agonists, in vivo inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase is unlikely to cause such suppression.",

The consanguineous parents of the boy had normal cholesterol concentrations, which indicated an autosomal recessive disorder rather than autosomal dominant familial hypercholesterolaemia. The diagnosis of autosomal recessive hypercholesterolaemia (ARH) was confirmed by the presence of a mutation in the phosphotyrosine binding domain of a putative adaptor protein, which prevents normal internalisation of the LDL receptor (LDLR) in the liver. The clinical phenotype of ARH is similar to that of classical homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia caused by defects in the LDLR gene, but it is more variable, generally less severe, and more responsive to lipid-lowering therapy. The patient's complaints of chest pain were not caused by ischaemia as was tested by an exercise and 24-hour electrocardiogram and by a myocardial perfusion scan.

Remarkable therapeutic advances in the treatment of ACS have been made during the past decade with antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapy. However, these therapies alone do not appear to completely stabilize the unstable plaque. Results from several clinical trials suggest that early administration of a statin following an ACS may reduce both short-term and longterm adverse outcomes such as subsequent cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction and revascularization. The potential mechanisms of benefit include improvements in endothelial function and vasomotion, reduction of platelet aggregability and thrombus formation, fibrinolytic and antioxidant activity as well as reduction of inflammation within plaques, reducing matrix degradation due to reduction of macrophage metalloproteinase production and increasing collagen content. Based upon the current knowledge, it might be concluded that patients hospitalized for ACS should be given a statin and the treatment should be initiated as soon as possible.",

DAS28 EULAR response was achieved in 18 of 58 (31%) patients allocated atorvastatin compared with six of 58 (10%) allocated placebo (odds ratio 3.9, 95% CI 1.42-10.72, p=0.006). C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate declined by 50% and 28%, respectively, relative to placebo (p<0.0001, p=0.005, respectively). Swollen joint count also fell (-2.69 vs -0.53; mean difference -2.16, 95% CI -3.67 to -0.64, p=0.0058).

    "59": "Fas is a member of the tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily. Fas-mediated apoptosis is an essential mechanism protecting against skin cancer. Activation of Fas by specific ligand or agonistic antibodies leads to the formation of a membrane associated death-inducing signalling complex comprising aggregates of Fas, the Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD), and caspase-8. It has recently been suggested that activity of Fas is not only regulated by its cognate ligand but also by the association of this receptor with cholesterol-enriched lipid domains in the plasma membrane (lipid rafts). We report here that disruption of lipid rafts by cholesterol-depleting compounds (methyl-beta-cyclodextrin, filipin III, cholesterol oxidase, and mevastatin) leads to a spontaneous clustering of Fas in the non-raft compartment of the plasma membrane, formation of Fas-FADD complexes, activation of caspase-8, and apoptosis. We propose that in some cell types exclusion of Fas from lipid rafts leads to the spontaneous, ligand-independent activation of this death receptor, a mechanism that can potentially be utilized in anticancer therapy.",

The absolute number of EMPs was enumerated using a novel two-color flow cytometric immunostaining technique with TruCount beads as an internal reference. EMPs are defined as EC membrane vesicles (1-2 microm in size) with a characteristic immunophenotype. The addition of fluvastatin to TNF-alpha-activated HCAECs significantly suppressed EMP release. Fluvastatin suppressed TNF-alpha-induced Rho activation. The Rho-kinase inhibitor, Y-27632, reproduced the effect of statin.",

The statin class of drugs is the preferred class for reducing low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Different statins have different potencies and different dose ranges. It is of interest to simulate clinical trials in which subjects are titrated through the dose ranges of various statins in accordance with local guidelines, in order to estimate the proportion of subjects who reach treatment goal of LDL-C at any particular dose of any particular statin.", 
    "68": "Patients with widely differing degrees of cardiovascular risk can derive benefit from effective lipid-lowering therapy with statins, including patients with normal or low cholesterol levels. Clinical trials with fluvastatin have shown that it is effective in patients across a broad spectrum of cardiovascular risk. The lipid-lowering effects of fluvastatin are smaller than some statins, but major clinical outcome studies have consistently demonstrated morbidity and mortality benefits with reductions of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of <30%. As treatment with statins is generally life-long and patients often receive multiple concomitant medications, optimal statin therapy should be well tolerated and serious consideration should be given to the avoidance of drug interactions. Although serious side-effects of statins are very rare, it is important that fluvastatin is less susceptible to drug interactions than other statins, because serious side-effects of statin therapy are generally associated with concomitant medications affecting statin metabolism. In addition, an extended-release formulation of fluvastatin has been developed to provide liver selectivity with a sustained exposure to the drug, thus improving its efficacy, and safety and tolerability profiles.", 
    "69": "The use of HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors (statins) has been associated with decreased risk of bone fractures in epidemiological studies. In vitro evidence suggests that statins may stimulate bone formation, but the data are still preliminary. We assessed the effects of the HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor atorvastatin on biochemical parameters of bone metabolism in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted between October 2001 and October 2002 in three hospital-based outpatient metabolism clinics. Forty-nine postmenopausal women, mean age 61 +/- 5 years, mean time postmenopause 12.6 +/- 8.8 years, were treated with atorvastatin, 20 mg per day ( n=24) or matching placebos ( n=25) for 8 weeks. Comparing the differences to baseline between the groups, there were no statistically significant effects of atorvastatin either on the bone formation markers intact osteocalcin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase or on the bone resorption markers C-telopeptide and intact parathyroid hormone. The marker of bone fractures, undercarboxylated osteocalcin, was also unchanged. When analyzed in dependence of age, atorvastatin increased C-telopeptide and osteocalcin in the younger subjects, while it decreased them in older subjects. Most interestingly, in older subjects, atorvastatin caused a significant decrease in the ratio of C-telopeptide to osteocalcin, an indicator of bone remodeling, while the ratio was increased in younger subjects, suggesting beneficial effects on bone turnover exclusively in older individuals (approx. >63 years). In summary, the present data suggest that short-term treatment with atorvastatin may have age-dependent effects on biochemical markers of bone turnover in postmenopausal women.", 
    "70": "Based on animal studies, statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) have been suggested as potential agents in the treatment of osteoporosis. In some epidemiological studies, statins have been associated with a reduced fracture risk. Our objective was to examine associations between statin treatment and risk of hip fracture in a population-based case-control study. A total of 6660 subjects with hip fracture and 33,274 gender- and age-matched population controls were identified from 1 January 1994 to 31 December 2001 using the Hospital Patient Register in North Jutland County, Denmark, and the Danish Central Personal Registry, respectively. Data on redeemed prescriptions for statins within the last 5 years before the index date were retrieved from a population-based prescription database. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (OR) for hip fracture according to use of statin prescriptions adjusted for potential confounding factors, i.e. gender, other diseases, and use of other drugs known to affect bone metabolism and fracture risk. After adjustment for potential confounders, statin treatment was associated with a reduced risk of hip fracture (OR=0.68; 95% confidence interval: 0.50-0.93) for those who had redeemed more than three prescriptions for a statin drug. We found that risk of hip fracture decreased with the number of statin prescriptions. Stratified analyses on gender and age did not reveal any major differences between men and women or among different age groups on the estimates between use of statins and hip fracture risk. Our findings support an association between statin treatment and a reduced hip fracture risk. However, it is unclear whether this association is causal.", 
    "71": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors have been developed as lipid-lowering drugs, and are well recognized to reduce morbidity and mortality from coronary artery disease. Several recent experimental studies have focused on the inhibitory effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor on tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo, dependent on a direct effect on cancer cells. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the potential anti-angiogenic effect of pravastatin and its mechanism of action. Using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as a model of angiogenesis, we investigated the effect of pravastatin on the various steps of angiogenesis, including endothelial cell proliferation and adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins. Pravastatin induced a dose-dependent decrease in the proliferative activity of endothelial cells, which was dependent on the cell cycle arrest to the G1 phase and not on cell apoptosis. G1 arrest was due to the decrease of cyclin D, cyclin E and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 levels. In addition, pravastatin inhibited tube formation on Matrigel and adhesion to extracellular matrix, but did not affect matrix metalloproteinase production. The present results demonstrate the anti-angiogenic activity of pravastatin and its potential use as an anticancer drug is suggested.", 
    "72": "In the early drug discovery process, metabolic stability and cytochrome P450 inhibition are often used as an early selection tool to identify useful compounds for further development. The reliability of the data in this process is therefore crucial. In the present study, in vitro enzyme kinetic data were used to predict the in vivo clearance and drug-drug interaction potential of four well known CYP2C9 substrates (tolbutamide, fluvastatin, ibuprofen and diclofenac) that are frequently used as benchmark substances in screening programs. Quantitative predictions of hepatic clearance using the well stirred prediction model and CL(int) calculated from enzyme kinetic measurements were not useful. Including and excluding protein binding resulted in under- and overestimation, respectively, of in vivo clearance. The only predicted in vivo clearance that fell into the range of reported measured values was for fluvastatin when protein binding was not included. In an open, randomized, seven-armed, crossover study in healthy volunteers, tolbutamide, ibuprofen, and fluvastatin were investigated as inhibitors of the metabolism of diclofenac, and vice versa. None of the combinations was found to interact with each other in vivo. The in vitro drug-drug interaction potential was investigated by K(i) determinations of the same combinations. In contrast to clearance predictions, the interaction potential in vivo was best predicted when plasma protein binding was included in the various models used. This study points to the uncertainty in calculating in vivo kinetics from in vitro enzyme kinetic data. The in vitro metabolic screening can thus be questioned as a compound selection tool without a proven in vitro-in vivo correlation.",

The binary angiographic in-stent restenosis (ISR; stenosis > or = 50% of vessel diameter) rate was 19% in patients with CRP values within the reference interval (< or = 3 mg/L) and 22% in patients with CRP >3 mg/L [odds ratio (OR) = 1.2; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.73-2.09]. Statin therapy in a univariate analysis significantly reduced both angiographic and clinical ISR rates. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified unstable angina, smoking, and stent length, but neither CRP concentration nor statin therapy as independent predictors for angiographic ISR. Patients with an abnormal CRP value showed a trend toward a higher risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction (3.8% vs 0.5%; OR = 7.43; 95% CI, 0.87-61.65). Target lesion revascularization rates did not differ between the two groups (9.6% vs 10.6%; OR = 1.13; 95% CI, 0.56-2.28). In multivariate analysis, male sex (OR = 0.44, 95% CI, 0.19-0.97) and statin therapy (OR = 0.26; 95% CI, 0.09-0.68) were independent predictors for the occurrence of target lesion revascularization.",

On multivariate analyses, D-dimer retained a significant association with coronary risk (relative risk, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.24 to 2.80), whereas IL-6 (1.47; 0.95 to 2.28) and C-reactive protein (1.33; 0.85 to 2.08) did not. Neither factor VII nor factor XIIa antigens were predictors of coronary events.",

Their beneficial effects may be mediated partly by favourable changes in serum lipids and particular on HDL phospholipid composition. In the present study, individual administration of either raloxifene (Group A) or atorvastatin (Group B) or both (Group C) was compared for a period of 3 months and their effects on total lipids and HDL phospholipids were evaluated. The combined treatment of raloxifene and atorvastatin resulted in profound changes in the majority of serum lipids, including a significant reduction in total cholesterol and triglycerides (P<0.001), a rise in total phospholipids (P<0.01) and a reduction in LDL-C and Apo B levels (P<0.001). Furthermore, Apo A-I was elevated (P<0.001) whereas total HDL phospholipids were significantly increased (P<0.05). Specifically, HDL phosphatidylcholine levels were markedly increased (P<0.001) and HDL lysophosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin and phosphatidylinositol levels were reduced (P<0.05).

    "84": "The graft survival rates of sensitized kidney recipients have been shown to be lower than non-sensitized patients. Therefore, panel reactive antibody (PRA) and cross-match determination is accepted as mandatory screening for renal transplantation candidates. Our recent previous study has shown that simvastatin had a significant immunosuppressive effect in PRA-positive and/or crossmatch-positive patients. We present the pre and post-transplantation follow-up outcomes of simvastatin treatment in the highly sensitized dialysis patients. Thirty patients were followed for a mean period of 26 months. The PRA and flow cytometric measurements were performed at monthly intervals. Ten patients underwent successful kidney transplantation (eight living-related and two cadaveric). None of the patients developed hyperacute or acute rejection, and there was no graft loss during 19.8+/-6.2 months of post-transplantation follow-up. Of the 18 patients who stayed on dialysis throughout the study with PRA positivity, six were lost to follow-up and three spontaneously stopped taking the simvastatin. In the latter three cases, the PRA levels rose significantly after the drug was discontinued. Eight of the remaining nine PRA-positive patients showed significant drops in mean PRA level over the study period, and entered the range considered acceptable for transplantation. Only one patient showed persistently high PRA levels throughout the study. In one patient, the drug had to be discontinued due to acute toxic hepatitis. In conclusion, the results indicate that continuous simvastatin therapy effective in immunized and highly sensitized dialysis patients. Meanwhile, it has beneficial effect on 1-year graft survival in sensitized renal transplantation group.",

Aim were to present the lipids status structure in patients with acute myocardial infarction and on the basis of that to suggest corresponding statin in treatment. Our research involved 202 patients with acute myocardial infarction, patients were both gender and from 37 to 89 year. Out of total number of patients, 100 of them were with anterior myocardial infarction (group I) and 102 with inferior myocardial infarction (group II). Whole cholesterol, low density lipoproteins, high density lipoproteins and triglycerides were followed. Hi square test and variance analysis were used to prove statistically significant difference. In the sample of group I increased LDL was found in 92 patients and increased TGL in 46 patients while decreased HDL was found in 61 patients. In the sample of group II increased LDL was found in 64 patients, increased TGL in 44 patients, while decreased HDL was found in 51 patients. We analysed the next combinations in both groups: LDL > with HDL <; LDL > with TGL >; HDL < with TGL >; LDL >, TGL > with HDL <. Combination decreased HDL with increased TGL was found in group I in 5 patients, and in group II in 12 patients. Other combinations in both groups were similarly values. On the basis of the obtained results we found statistically significant difference between the two groups of patients. Patients in group I have more frequently increased values of LDL in comparison to patients in group II (p < 0.00005). In patients in group II who had decreased HDL and increased TGL statistically significant difference was found in comparison to the patients in group I (p < 0.02). On the basis of the obtained results and up to now studies on statins effects we suggest Atorvastatin for treatment the patients with anterior myocardial infarction, increased LDL with normal values of HDL and Simvastatin for treatment the patients with inferior myocardial infarction, decreased HDL.",

    "90": "Oxidative stress during sepsis induces tissue damage, leading to organ dysfunction and high mortality. The antioxidant effects of vitamin E have been reported in several diseases, but not in sepsis. Statins have cholesterol-independent anti-inflammatory effects that are related to a decrease of isoprenoid proteins and oxidative stress. Therefore, we evaluated superoxide anion (O2- degree) production and ex vivo effects of vitamin E and simvastatin in sepsis. Fourteen healthy volunteers, 14 intensive care unit (ICU) nonseptic, and 14 ICU patients with sepsis were included in this prospective study. Plasma cholesterol, triglyceride, and vitamin E levels were determined by routine laboratory tests. Superoxide anion production was measured in the venous blood by chemiluminescence technique after phorbol myristate acetate stimulation. Effects of vitamin E and simvastatin on O2- degree production was investigated ex vivo. Luminescence was indexed to the leukocyte count. We also investigated the in vitro effect of simvastatin on translocation of NADPH oxidase p21 Rac2 subunit in THP-1 monocytic cell line. The ratio of vitamin E/cholesterol + triglycerides was significantly decreased in septic as compared with nonseptic patients and volunteers. The O2- degree production was significantly higher in the group of septic patients than in the others, regardless of the polymorphonuclear leukocyte count. Vitamin E and simvastatin induced ex vivo an inhibition of O2- degree production of 20% and 40% respectively. In vitro, simvastatin inhibited phorbol myristate acetate-induced- O2- degree production by monocytes through NADPH oxidase inactivation. We conclude that sepsis is associated with a significant decrease in vitamin E and an overproduction of O2- degree. Vitamin E and simvastatin lessen this phenomenon through NADPH oxidase inactivation.",

In this parallel comparison study there was an apparent decrease in lovastatin exposure, however, the reduction in lovastatin or beta-hydroxylovastatin concentrations was not related to the ezetimibe dose and is not considered to be clinically important. Ezetimibe 5, 10, or 20 mg combined with lovastatin 20 mg caused a significantly (p < 0.01) greater reduction in LDL-C than lovastatin 20 mg alone, with no apparent effect on HDL-C or triglycerides. LDL-C was reduced by 51.0% with ezetimibe 10 mg plus lovastatin 20 mg, 56.0% with ezetimibe 10 mg plus lovastatin 40 mg, 33.2% with lovastatin alone, and 17.3% with placebo.",

Further incremental reductions in LDL-C from the co-administration of ezetimibe and lovastatin are expected only when the dose of lovastatin is increased. The co-administration of ezetimibe and lovastatin has the potential to produce clinically significant reductions in LDL-C compared to either drug alone, with favorable safety and tolerability.",

A decrease of the posttranslational modification of RhoA by geranylgeranyl moieties was detected, supporting a role for RhoA as mediator of statin effects. Induction of apoptosis, determined by activation of caspase-3 and DNA fragmentation, and necrosis only occurred at later time points, when the morphology of the cells was strongly altered and the cells detached from the surface due to changes in the actin cytoskeleton. Basically, the same results were obtained with a human mesangial cell line. Furthermore, statin effects were mimicked by inhibition of the geranylgeranyltransferase.", 
    "106": "Most of the cellular effects of the lipophilic statins occurred within the same time and concentration range, suggesting a common molecular mechanism. Only apoptosis and necrosis were observed at later time points or with higher concentrations of simvastatin and thus seem to be secondary to the changes in gene expression and alterations of the actin cytoskeleton.", 
    "107": "Therapy with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) has been shown to significantly reduce major coronary events and death in a wide range of individuals at risk for these events. In addition, recent observations suggest that some of the clinical benefits associated with statin therapy may be pleiotropic; that is, independent of their cholesterol-inhibiting action. It is clear that the clinical benefits associated with statin therapy far outweigh the risks; however, there may be important clinical differences among agents within the class, related to both benefits and drug safety. Evaluation of the benefit-to-risk profile for each available statin should include considering the results of randomised clinical outcome trials, the safety record of each agent, effect on lipoproteins and evidence of beneficial pleiotropic properties.Recently, data from several clinical outcome trials have shown that substantial benefits are associated with treatment with fluvastatin in diverse populations. In particular, data from two large, randomised clinical trials have demonstrated that fluvastatin is effective for secondary prevention of cardiac events in patients following coronary intervention procedures, and for primary prevention of cardiac events in renal transplant recipients. Pleiotropic benefits for fluvastatin have been shown in experimental and clinical studies as well. Fluvastatin was the first statin available as an extended-release product (fluvastatin XL 80mg); both formulations have demonstrated efficacy and safety in a wide range of patients. Taken together, these clinical outcomes and safety data suggest a strong benefit-to-risk profile for fluvastatin.", 
    "108": "A 69 year old man complained of general myalgia, arthralgia and muscle weakness in two weeks after he started to take 10 mg per day pravastatin. Symptoms progressed at least for 3 months after withdrawal of the medication. The muscle weakness was more in distal upper extremities and the iliopsoas muscle. Serum CK was 943IU/L. The anti-nuclear and Jo-1 antibody were positive. EMG examinations disclosed fibrillation potentials at rest and myopathic discharges by a voluntary contractor. Symptoms as well as serum CK values improved promptly by treatment with prednisolone. From these clinical and laboratory results, it was speculated that this patient suffered from subacute polymyositis, although pathological studies were not performed. Because of continuing hypercholesterolemia, the patient was retreated with atorvastatin, presenting similar, but less serious symptoms. So far, three cases of statin-associated polymyositis or dermatomyositis were reported. Statins could influence the immune system, but it is still unsettled if statins cause autoimmune polymyositis. This problem warrants further study.",

    "113": "During recent years, multidisciplinary studies in epidemiology and molecular biology have contributed to our understanding of the etiology of colorectal cancer; more importantly they have enabled us to approach its prevention. An impressive body of epidemiological data suggests an inverse relationship between colorectal cancer risk and consumption of diets rich in omega (omega)-3 fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) or the regular use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin. The development of strategies for the chemoprevention of colorectal cancer have been facilitated by the use of relevant animal models mimicking the neoplastic processes that occur in humans, including similarities in histopathology and molecular and genetic lesions during both the early and promotion/progression stages of carcinogenesis. Studies with the azoxymethane-F344 rat model indicate that diets rich in n-3 PUFAs, NSAIDs, selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitors, and curcumin can reduce the incidence of colon cancer. Advances in the knowledge of the mechanisms by which chemopreventive agents act offer opportunities to use combinations of specific chemopreventive agents, having clinically beneficial aggregate activity with minimal toxicity. This approach is extremely important when a promising chemopreventive agent demonstrates apparent efficacy but may produce toxic effects at high doses. Our studies show that a combination of very low doses of piroxicam (NSAID) and difluoromethylornithine, a specific inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, or very low doses of COX-2 and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are more effective in inhibiting colon carcinogenesis than administration of these compounds as single agents even at higher levels. The natural history of colorectal cancer, from dysplastic aberrant crypts to adenomas and adenocarcinomas, offers multiple opportunities for assessment and intervention. Of further importance is to identify whether the molecular targets that are critical in the growth and survival of the malignant colorectal cell are modulated by n-3 PUFAs, NSAIDs, or COX-2 and iNOS inhibitors.", 
    "114": "Patients who survive an acute coronary syndrome of unstable angina or myocardial infarction are at much higher risk of a recurrent event within the following year than patients with stable coronary syndromes. Statin therapy is justified for many of these patients, not only for long-term benefit but also to reduce the risk of recurrent events within weeks of the primary event. The mechanisms that underlie this benefit are probably related to improvements in endothelial function, a decrease in vascular inflammation, and reduced prothrombotic factors. The effects of statins may be mediated by cholesterol reduction, cholesterol-independent effects (particularly decreasing isoprenoids), and mechanisms that are independent of inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase. Observational studies consistently show an early reduction in mortality with statin therapy started before discharge from hospital after an acute coronary syndrome. Several randomized controlled trials also support an early benefit of risk reduction from statins started during the hospital admission for an acute coronary syndrome. Early statin therapy is also related to improved compliance and use of statins several years after a coronary event. Thus, early statin therapy may improve both early and long-term secondary prevention efforts.", 
    "115": "Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is associated with pronounced atherosclerosis leading to premature cardiovascular disease and untimely death. Despite the availability of effective preventative drug treatments, many affected individuals remain undiagnosed and untreated until they become symptomatic with cardiovascular disease. To assess the cost-effectiveness of systematic genetic screening of family members of persons diagnosed with FH, an analysis was conducted using data from a nationwide screening program for the identification of individuals with FH, instituted in The Netherlands in 1994, and from other sources. There was DNA testing of families with a known genetic defect to identify new cases of FH in the presymptomatic stage of the disease. After identification, most newly identified patients were started on cholesterol-lowering statin treatment. On average, new cases diagnosed by the screening program gained 3.3 years of life each. Twenty-six myocardial infarctions would be avoided for every 100 persons treated with statins between the ages of 18 and 60 years. The average total lifetime incremental costs, over all age ranges and both sexes, including costs for screening and testing, lifetime drug treatment, and treatment of cardiovascular events, was US dollars 7500 per new case identified. Cost per life-year gained was US dollars 8700. Therefore, systematic genetic screening of family members of persons diagnosed with FH is cost-effective in The Netherlands and should be considered for other settings.",

Current smokers were less likely to use aspirin (OR 0.59, CI 0.4-0.89). Statin use was associated with reported high cholesterol (OR 24.4, CI 8.4-32.4), management by a cardiologist (OR 2.3, CI 1.8-3.0), and the use of calcium channel-blockers. Patients reporting hypertension or heart failure, in addition to high cholesterol, were less likely to use statins. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were the most commonly prescribed agents for management of hypertension (59%) and were more frequently used among patients with diabetes and those with symptoms of heart failure. Overall 42% of patients were on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and 36% on beta-blockers.",

Our objective was to explore the degree to which high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level changes explain cardiovascular risk reduction.", 
    "121": "A systematic review identified trials of lipid-lowering agents reporting changes in HDL-C and LDL-C levels and the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD). The observed relative risk reduction (RRR) in CHD morbidity and mortality rates was calculated. The expected RRR, given the treatment effect on total cholesterol level, was calculated for each trial with logistic regression coefficients from observational studies. The difference between observed and expected RRR was plotted against the change in HDL-C level, and a least-squares regression line was calculated.", 
    "122": "Fifty-one trials were identified. Nineteen statin trials addressed the association of HDL-C with CHD. Limited numbers of trials of other therapies precluded additional analyses. Among statin trials, therapy reduced total cholesterol levels as much as 32% and LDL-C levels as much as 45%. HDL-C level increases were <10%. Treatment effect on HDL-C levels was not a significant linear predictor of the difference in observed and expected CHD mortality rates, although we observed a trend in this direction (P =.08). Similarly, HDL-C effect was not a significant linear predictor of the difference between observed and expected RRRs for CHD morbidity (P =.20).", 
    "123": "Although a linear trend toward greater risk reduction was observed with greater effects on HDL-C, differences were not statistically significant. The narrow range of HDL-C level increases in the statin trials likely reduced our ability to detect a beneficial HDL-C effect, if present.",

However, on the basis of Food and Drug Administration post-marketing surveys, the rate of cerivastatin-induced rhabdomyolysis appeared to be 10-fold greater than that of the other statins, despite safe pre-clinical profiles. However, no clinical trials have been performed directly comparing the rates of myotoxicity of all commercially available statins. The mechanism of statin-induced myopathy remains unclear. The prevailing theory is that lipophilic statins lead to depletion of intermediates normally formed after cholesterol synthesis within myocytes. Risk factors for the development of myopathy include drug interactions (especially with fibrates) and the coexistence of conditions known to predispose patients to rhabdomyolysis.",

    "132": "Two common and tightly linked SNPs (linkage disequilibrium r2 = 0.90; heterozygote prevalence = 6.7% for both) were significantly associated with reduced efficacy of pravastatin therapy. Both of these SNPs were in the gene coding for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the target enzyme that is inhibited by pravastatin. For example, compared with individuals homozygous for the major allele of one of the SNPs, individuals with a single copy of the minor allele had a 22% smaller reduction in total cholesterol (-32.8 vs -42.0 mg/dL [-0.85 vs -1.09 mmol/L]; P =.001; absolute difference, 9.2 mg/dL [95% confidence interval [CI], 3.8-14.6 mg/dL]) and a 19% smaller reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (-27.7 vs -34.1 mg/dL [-0.72 vs -0.88 mmol/L]; P =.005; absolute difference, 6.4 mg/dL [95% CI, 2.2-10.6 mg/dL]). The association for total cholesterol reduction persisted even after adjusting for multiple tests on all 33 SNPs evaluated in the HMG-CoA reductase gene as well as for all 148 SNPs evaluated was similar in magnitude and direction among men and women and was present in the ethnically diverse total cohort as well as in the majority subgroup of white participants. No association for either SNP was observed for the change in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (P>.80) and neither was associated with baseline lipid levels among those actively treated or among those who did not receive the drug. Among the remaining genes, less robust associations were found for squalene synthase and change in total cholesterol, apolipoprotein E and change in LDL cholesterol, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein and change in HDL cholesterol, although none of these met our conservative criteria for purely pharmacogenetic effects.",

The most important adverse effects associated with statins are myopathy and an asymptomatic increase in hepatic transaminases, both of which occur infrequently. Because statins are prescribed on a long-term basis, however, possible interactions with other drugs deserve particular attention, as many patients will typically receive pharmacological therapy for concomitant conditions during the course of statin treatment. This review summarizes the pharmacokinetic properties of statins and emphasizes their clinically relevant drug interactions.", 
    "135": "The occurrence of stroke increases with age, particularly affecting the older elderly, a population also at higher risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). Epidemiological and observational studies have not shown a clear association between cholesterol levels and all causes of stroke. Nonetheless, large, long-term statin trials in patients with established CHD or at high risk for CHD have shown that statins decrease stroke incidence in these populations. Combined data from 9 trials including 70,070 patients indicated relative and absolute risk reductions for stroke of 21% and 0.9%, respectively, with statins. The number of strokes prevented per 1000 patients treated for 5 years in patients with CHD is 9 for statins, compared with 17.3 for antiplatelet agents. Statins have not yet been shown to reduce stroke risk in the typical general population without known CHD, nor have they been shown to prevent recurrent stroke in patients with prior stroke. Potential reasons for the effects of statins on stroke and the non-cholesterol-lowering mechanisms that may be involved are discussed. Treatment strategies based on global cardiovascular risk may be most effective. Additional studies in patients representative of the typical stroke population are needed.", 
    "136": "Pleiotropic effects of a drug are actions other than those for which the agent was specifically developed. These effects may be related or unrelated to the primary mechanism of action of the drug, and they are usually unanticipated. Pleiotropic effects may be undesirable (such as side effects or toxicity), neutral, or, as is especially the case with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), beneficial. Pleiotropic effects of statins include improvement of endothelial dysfunction, increased nitric oxide bioavailability, antioxidant properties, inhibition of inflammatory responses, and stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques. These and several other emergent properties could act in concert with the potent low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering effects of statins to exert early as well as lasting cardiovascular protective effects. Understanding the pleiotropic effects of statins is important to optimize their use in treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "137": "As the major regulator of vascular homeostasis, the endothelium exerts a number of vasoprotective effects, such as vasodilation, suppression of smooth muscle cell growth, and inhibition of inflammatory responses. Many of these effects are largely mediated by nitric oxide, the most potent endogenous vasodilator. Nitric oxide opposes the effects of endothelium-derived vasoconstrictors and inhibits oxidation of low-density lipoprotein. A defect in the production or activity of nitric oxide leads to endothelial dysfunction, signaled by impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Accumulating evidence suggests that endothelial dysfunction is an early marker for atherosclerosis and can be detected before structural changes to the vessel wall are apparent on angiography or ultrasound. Many of the risk factors that predispose to atherosclerosis can also cause endothelial dysfunction, and the presence of multiple risk factors has been found to predict endothelial dysfunction. A number of clinical trials have shown that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) improve endothelial dysfunction in patients with coronary risk factors beyond what could be attributed to their impact on plasma lipids. Studies have elucidated several possible mechanisms by which statin therapy may improve endothelial dysfunction, including upregulation of nitric oxide production or activity and reduction of oxidative stress.", 
    "138": "The attenuation of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by Lovastatin (LOV) has now been well established. The present study was designed to explore the global effect of LOV treatment on expression of immune-related genes in lumbar spinal cord (LSC) during acute EAE by using Affymetrix DNA microarrays. LOV treatment demonstrated the limited infiltration of inflammatory cells into the LSC, and microarray analysis further validated those interpretations by demonstrating relatively less alteration in expression of immune response genes in LOV-treated EAE rats on peak clinical day and recovery vs. untreated EAE counterparts. There was significant change in expression of about 158 immune-related genes (including 127 genes reported earlier) in LOV-treated vs. untreated EAE (>1.5 or <-1.5 fold change; P </=.05), of which 140 genes were suppressed and only 18 genes were up-regulated. These altered genes encode for leukocyte-specific markers and receptors, histocompatibility complex, cytokines/receptors, chemokines/receptors, adhesion molecules, components of the complement cascade, cellular activation, and transcription factors and signal transduction-related molecules. Interestingly, T(H)2 phenotype cytokines such as interleukin-4, interleukin-10, and transforming growth factor-beta1 and transcription factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma were up-regulated in LSC by LOV treatment as further revealed by real-time PCR and immunoblotting. These findings indicate that PPARs may be mediating the antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of LOV. Together, these findings provide new insight into the molecular events associated with the protection provided by statins during treatment of demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of statins on the proliferation of endothelial cells derived from human umbilical cord veins (HUVEC). Cerivastatin, simvastatin and fluvastatin caused a dose-dependent inhibition of endothelial cell growth (n=12; P<.01) when using cell counts and [3H]-thymidine incorporation, respectively. The strongest inhibition of HUVEC proliferation was achieved at statin concentrations of 0.1 micromol/l (cerivastatin), 2.5 micromol/l (simvastatin) and 1 micromol/l (fluvastatin). Cell counts were significantly reduced from 22937+/-280.6 (control) to 7791+/-133.6 (cerivastatin), 7292+/-146.6 (simvastatin) and 6792+/-135.5 (fluvastatin) (n=12; P<.01). Interestingly, cell proliferation induced by oxLDL (10 microg/ml) and LPC (20 micromol/l) could be effectively prevented using statins at concentrations between 0.01 and 0.1 micromol/l (cerivastatin), 1 and 2.5 micromol/l (simvastatin) and 0.25 and 1 micromol/l (fluvastatin). This effect of the statins was abolished by preincubation with mevalonate (500 micromol/l). Our results demonstrate an interesting direct effect of statins on the proliferation of human endothelial cells induced by oxLDL and LPC, which may be beneficial to prevent vascular effects of these atherogenic lipids.", 
    "148": "Cardiac allograft vasculopathy is one of the major causes of mortality late after heart transplantation. This disease process occurs to a lesser extent in patients with other donor organs; however, a long-term graft dysfunction is similarly described in kidney, liver and lung transplant recipients. There are multiple immune and nonimmune risk factors associated with this vasculopathic disease process, one of which includes hyperlipidemia. Use of lipid lowering agents, specifically HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) was initially reported to have possible immunosuppressive effects in a single center study of heart transplant recipients. This has not been observed in kidney transplant recipients; however, a large randomized trial demonstrated a significant cardiovascular risk reduction in fluvastatin-treated kidney transplant patients, outcome similar to the numerous nontransplant clinical trials of statins in atherosclerosis. In two recent in vitro studies, statins have been reported to repress induction of MHC-II by interferon-gamma and selectively block leukocyte function antigen-1, both of which decrease T-lymphocyte activation. In conclusion, statins appear to have outcome benefits in heart and kidney transplant patients; however, firm evidence for a clinical immunosuppressive effect is lacking. Further studies in humans will be needed to demonstrate this potential effect of statins. Overall, the outcome benefits of statins from the heart and kidney clinical studies provide a firm rationale to support the use of statins in organ transplantation.",

After a dietary run-in period of 2 weeks, patients received either rosuvastatin 10 mg once daily or atorvastatin 10 mg once daily, for 6 weeks. The fall in the mean LDL-C levels after 6 weeks of treatment in rosuvastatin group (40.1%) was significantly more as compared to the fall in atorvastatin group (29.8%). Other secondary lipid parameters like total cholesterol (TC), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides, apo-B, apo-AI, and TC/HDL-C ratio also showed more beneficial changes from the baseline in rosuvastatin group than in atorvastatin group. Rosuvastatin 10 mg shows significantly better efficacy than atorvastatin 10 mg in reducing LDL-C levels and produces greater improvements in other elements of the lipid profile.",

Uptake studies showed that GEM and GEM-1-O-glu significantly inhibited the OATP2-mediated uptake of CER with IC(50) values of 72 and 24 microM, respectively. They also inhibited the CYP2C8-mediated metabolism of CER with IC(50) values of 28 and 4 microM, respectively, whereas M3 had no effects. GEM and GEM-1-O-glu minimally inhibited the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of CER. The IC(50) values of GEM and GEM-1-O-glu for the uptake and the metabolism of CER obtained in the present study were lower than their total, and not unbound, plasma concentrations. However, considering the possibly concentrated high unbound concentrations of GEM-1-O-glu in the liver and its relatively larger plasma unbound fraction compared with GEM itself, the glucuronide inhibition of the CYP2C8-mediated metabolism of CER appears to be the main mechanism for the clinically relevant drug-drug interaction. Previously reported clinical drug interaction studies showing that coadministration of GEM with pravastatin or pitavastatin, both of which are known to be cleared from the plasma by the uptake transporters in the liver, only minimally (less than 2-fold) increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of these statins, also supported our present conclusion.", 
    "155": "Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) produced by chondrocytes play a role in the development of cartilage degradation in joint diseases. Moreover, inhibition of MMP secretion by macrophages accumulating in arteriosclerotic plaques would account for the plaque stabilising activity of statins in cardiovascular patients. Recently, simvastatin has been shown to inhibit both developing and established collagen induced arthritis in a murine model. We thus decided to investigate the effect of simvastatin on the production of MMP-3 from cultured interleukin (IL)1 stimulated human chondrocytes.", 
    "156": "Cells from human cartilage, obtained from eight subjects with osteoarthritis undergoing surgery for total hip prostheses, were cultured in the presence of different concentrations of simvastatin (5, 10, and 50 micromol/l) with and without IL1beta (5 ng/ml). MMP-3 level was measured in the culture medium after 48 h of incubation.", 
    "157": "IL1beta stimulation of chondrocytes increased MMP-3 concentration in the cultures (from 0.69 (0.09) to 1.94 (0.12) ng/microg protein). Incubation with simvastatin was associated with a dose dependent reduction in MMP-3 increase, both in the presence (-15%, -17%, and -26% with 5, 10, and 50 micromol/l, respectively) and in the absence (-32% with 50 micromol/l) of IL1beta. The inhibiting effect of simvastatin was completely reversed by the addition of mevalonate (100 micromol/l) or farnesol (10 micromol/l).", 
    "158": "Our data show that simvastatin, by blocking HMGCoA-reductase and interfering in the prenylation processes, is able to inhibit MMP-3 production from cultured human chondrocytes that have been either unstimulated or stimulated with IL1beta, thus suggesting a possible additional mechanism for statins in counteracting chronic joint disease related cartilage damage.", 
    "159": "Based on recent advances, this article aims to review the biological basis for the use of either radiation or drug-eluting stents for the prevention of restenosis, and to elucidate the complementary role that they may play in the future. Vascular restenosis is a multifactorial process primarily driven by the remodeling of the arterial wall, as well as by the hyperproliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMC). These pathophysiological features are the target of therapeutic strategies aimed at inhibiting constrictive remodeling as well as inhibiting SMC proliferation. The success of radiation as well as anti-proliferative drugs such as paclitaxel and sirolimus lies in the primary and/or multifactorial inhibition of cell proliferation. Radiation has the additional feature of preventing constrictive remodeling while sirolimus has the potential property of being anti-inflammatory, which may be a desirable feature. The effects of radiation are not reliant on any uptake and \"metabolism\" by the target cells, as in the case with drugs, and thus radiation potentially may be more effective as a result of its more-direct action. However, radiation does have some significant drawbacks compared to drug-eluting stents, including a much delayed re-endothelialization resulting in the need for prolonged anti-platelet therapy. Based on recent clinical data, drug-eluting stents have been shown to markedly reduce the likelihood of restenosis, which actually favors this approach for the prevention of restenosis. From a biological perspective, drug-eluting stents and radiation have certain differences, which are reviewed in this article.", 
    "160": "We investigated the effect of statin therapy on T-cell activation in patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention by using flow cytometric analysis. The increased frequency of interferon-gamma-positive CD4(+) T cells after percutaneous coronary intervention was significant in the group treated without statins but not in the group treated with statins.", 
    "161": "Of 6,302 consecutive patients with acute non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, 42.8% presented with ST depression, 31.9% showed no significant electrocardiographic changes, and 25.3% presented with T inversion. In comparison with patients with T inversion or no significant electrocardiographic changes, patients with ST depression more often had 3-vessel coronary disease, received less acute therapy despite a strong benefit in a subgroup analysis, and had a worse clinical outcome even after adjustment in a multivariate analysis. Patients with T inversion received a high rate of acute therapy and had a better outcome than did patients without significant electrocardiographic changes and patients with ST depression.", 
    "162": "This study compared the efficacy and safety of co-administered ezetimibe + simvastatin with atorvastatin monotherapy in adults with hypercholesterolemia. Seven hundred eighty-eight patients were randomized 1:1:1 to 3 treatment groups; each group was force-titrated over four 6-week treatment periods: (1) 10 mg of atorvastatin as the initial dose was titrated to 20, 40, and 80 mg; (2) co-administration of 10 mg of ezetimibe and 10 mg of simvastatin (10/10 mg) was titrated to 10/20, 10/40, and 10/80 mg of ezetimibe + simvastatin; and (3) co-administration of 10/20 mg of ezetimibe + simvastatin was titrated to 10/40 mg (for 2 treatment periods) and 10/80 mg of ezetimibe + simvastatin. Key efficacy measures included percent changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) from baseline to the ends of (1) treatment periods 1 and 2 (for LDL cholesterol) comparing co-administration of 10/20 mg and 10/10 mg of ezetimibe + simvastatin with 10 mg of atorvastatin and (2) treatment period 4 (for LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol) comparing co-administration of 10/80 mg of ezetimibe + simvastatin with 80 mg of atorvastatin. Baseline LDL and HDL cholesterol levels were comparable between treatment groups. At the end of treatment period 1, the mean decrease of LDL cholesterol was significantly (p </=0.001) greater for co-administration of 10/10 mg and 10/20 mg of ezetimibe + simvastatin than for 10 mg of atorvastatin. At the end of treatment period 4 and after comparing maximum doses, co-administration of 10/80 mg of ezetimibe + simvastatin was superior to 80 mg of atorvastatin in the percent LDL cholesterol decrease (-59.4% vs -52.5%, p <0.001) and HDL cholesterol increase (12.3% vs 6.5%; p <0.001). All treatments were well tolerated. Thus, a greater LDL cholesterol decrease and HDL cholesterol increase were attained by treating patients with co-administration of ezetimibe and simvastatin than with atorvastatin.", 
    "163": "This study assessed whether the co-administration of ezetimibe and simvastatin would be more effective than simvastatin monotherapy in allowing high-risk patients to achieve a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goal of <100 mg/dl. Men and women with LDL cholesterol >/=130 mg/dl and meeting National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria for coronary heart disease (CHD) or CHD risk equivalent were randomized to 1 of 4 daily treatments for 23 weeks: simvastatin 20 mg (n = 253), ezetimibe 10 mg plus simvastatin 10 mg (n = 251), ezetimibe 10 mg plus simvastatin 20 mg (n = 109), and ezetimibe 10 mg plus simvastatin 40 mg (n = 97). In all groups, patients not at goal had their simvastatin doses doubled at weeks 6, 12, and/or 18, up to a maximum of 80 mg. The primary efficacy objective was LDL cholesterol goal attainment (<100 mg/dl) after 5 weeks of treatment. Ezetimibe plus any dose of simvastatin produced greater reductions in LDL cholesterol and allowed more patients to achieve goal after 5 weeks (p <0.001) and at the end of the study (p <0.001) than simvastatin 20 mg alone. At 5 weeks, 75%, 83%, and 87% of patients receiving ezetimibe plus simvastatin 10, 20, and 40 mg had LDL cholesterol <100 mg/dl compared with 46% of patients receiving simvastatin 20 mg. In patients who started on ezetimibe plus simvastatin 10, 20 and 40 mg, 33%, 22%, and 12%, respectively, required simvastatin titration during the study compared with 68% of patients who started on simvastatin 20 mg. The corresponding median simvastatin doses used were 10, 20, 40, and 40 mg, respectively. Ezetimibe plus simvastatin was well tolerated, with an overall safety profile similar to that of simvastatin monotherapy. Thus, through the dual inhibition of cholesterol absorption and synthesis, ezetimibe plus simvastatin allowed more patients to reach LDL cholesterol <100 mg/dl at a lower simvastatin dose and with fewer dose titrations than simvastatin monotherapy.", 
    "164": "Hydroxymethyl-glutaryl-CoA-reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce cardiovascular events by cholesterol lowering as well as non-lipid related actions. Among them, the modulation of fibrinolysis could play a relevant role in vascular protection. Atorvastatin is able of reducing platelet activity and thrombin generation before low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) decrease in hypercholesterolemic subjects in which coagulation and fibrinolysis are linked by the activation of thrombin activable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI). The aim of our study was to evaluate whether atorvastatin could modulate fibrinolysis by interactions with endothelial mechanisms and thrombin generation.", 
    "165": "Forty-four pure hypercholesterolemic subjects (26 M, 18 F, mean age 52.7+/-13.7, LDL-C 194.8+/-9.3t mg/dl) were evaluated for plasmin-antiplasmin complexes (PAP), tissue-plasminogen acivator (t-PA) and its inhibitor (PAI-1) (ELISA), TAFI activity (HPLC), platelet P-selectin (P-sel) (cytofluorymetric detection), platelet-dependent thrombin generation (PDTG, coagulative-chromogenic method) and lipid profile at baseline and after 7, 14, 28 and 90 days of atorvastatin (10 mg/die) treatment.", 
    "166": "PAP were significantly reduced at baseline in hypercholesterolemic versus control subjects (P<0.05) and were related to P-sel (P<0.01), PDTG (P<0.01) and its inhibitor (PAI-1) after venous occlusion (VO) (P<0.05). Atorvastatin induced a significant increase of PAP at T(2) related to modifications of P-sel (P<0.01) and PDTG (P<0.01) before significant LDL-C reduction (P=0.132). PAI-1 was significantly changed at T(3) with relation to LDL-C (P<0.01), Von Willebrand factor (VWF) (P<0.01) and sE-sel (P<0.05).", 
    "167": "The profibrinolytic activity of atorvastatin in hypercholesterolemic subjects is related, initially, to the positive effects exerted on platelet function and thrombin generation which can modulate fibrinolysis by TAFI activity."
