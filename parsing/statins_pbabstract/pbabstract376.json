Over the median follow-up period of 5.4 years, one or more major coronary events (MCEs) occurred in 622 (28%) of the 2223 patients in the placebo group and 431 (19%) of the 2221 patients in the simvastatin group (34% risk reduction, P<.00001). Simvastatin produced substantial changes in several lipoprotein components, which we have attempted to relate to the beneficial effects observed.", 
    "1": "The Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the relationship between lipid values (baseline, year 1, and percent change from baseline at year 1) and MCEs. The reduction in MCEs within the simvastatin group was highly correlated with on-treatment levels and changes from baseline in total and LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and less so with HDL cholesterol, but there was no clear relationship with triglycerides. We estimate that each additional 1% reduction in LDL cholesterol reduces MCE risk by 1.7% (95% CI, 1.0% to 2.4%; P<.00001).", 
    "2": "These analyses suggest that the beneficial effect of simvastatin in individual patients in 4S was determined mainly by the magnitude of the change in LDL cholesterol, and they are consistent with current guidelines that emphasize aggressive reduction of this lipid in CHD patients.", 
    "3": "Although LDL lowering has been shown to reduce recurrent coronary events in patients with coronary heart disease, little direct information is available on the extent of LDL lowering required to achieve this outcome.", 
    "4": "The Cholesterol and Recurrent Events (CARE) trial compared pravastatin and placebo in patients who had experienced myocardial infarction (MI) who had average concentrations of total cholesterol <240 mg/dL (baseline mean, 209 mg/dL) and LDL cholesterol (LDL) 115 to 174 mg/dL (mean, 139 mg/dL). Pravastatin reduced coronary death or recurrent MI by 24%. In multivariate analysis, the LDL concentration achieved during follow-up was a significant, although nonlinear, predictor of the coronary event rate (P=.007), whereas the extent of LDL reduction was not significant, whether expressed as an absolute amount (P=.97) or a percentage (P=.76). The coronary event rate declined as LDL decreased during follow-up from 174 to approximately 125 mg/dL, but no further decline was seen in the LDL range from 125 to 71 mg/dL. In multivariate analysis, triglyceride but not HDL concentrations during follow-up were weakly but significantly associated with the coronary event rate.", 
    "5": "The LDL concentrations achieved during treatment with pravastatin or placebo were associated with reduction in coronary events down to an LDL concentration of approximately 125 mg/dL. LDL concentrations <125 mg/dL during treatment were not associated with further benefit. Absolute or percentage reduction in LDL had little relationship to coronary events.", 
    "6": "The West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study was a primary prevention trial that demonstrated the effectiveness of pravastatin (40 mg/d) in reducing morbidity and mortality from coronary heart disease (CHD) in moderately hypercholesterolemic men. The present analysis examines the extent to which differences in LDL and other plasma lipids both at baseline and on treatment influenced CHD risk reduction.", 
    "7": "Relationships between baseline lipid concentrations and incidence of all cardiovascular events and between on-treatment lipid concentrations and risk reduction in patients taking pravastatin were examined by use of Cox regression models and by division of the cohort into quintiles. Variation in plasma lipids at baseline did not influence the relative risk reduction generated by pravastatin therapy. Fall in LDL level in the pravastatin-treated group did not correlate with CHD risk reduction in multivariate regression. Furthermore, maximum benefit of an approximately 45% risk reduction was observed in the middle quintile of LDL reduction (mean 24% fall); further mean decrements in LDL (up to 39%) were not associated with a greater decrease in CHD risk. Comparison of event rates between placebo- and pravastatin-treated subjects with the same LDL cholesterol level provided evidence for an apparent treatment effect that was independent of LDL.", 
    "8": "We conclude that the treatment effect of 40 mg/d of pravastatin is proportionally the same regardless of baseline lipid phenotype. There is no CHD risk reduction unless LDL levels are reduced, but a fall in the range of 24% is sufficient to produce the full benefit in patients taking this dose of pravastatin. LDL reduction alone does not appear to account entirely for the benefits of pravastatin therapy.", 
    "9": "In the present study it was examined if the common marmoset was susceptible to pravastatin (CAS 81131-70-6, CS 514, Mevalotin), an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. It has been reported that serum lipid levels in common marmosets resemble those in humans. First serum total cholesterol and lipoprotein cholesterol levels of common marmosets were examined in comparison with those in seven different experimental animals including cynomolgus monkeys, beagle dogs, Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits, Japanese White Rabbits, Sprague Dawley rats, Wistar-Imamichi rats and golden hamsters. The animals were fed normal chow diets, and total- and lipoprotein-cholesterol levels were determined under identical conditions. The quantitative and polyacrylamide electrophoresis studies indicated that among animals examined serum lipid and lipoprotein profiles in common marmosets were similar to those in humans. When pravastatin at 1-30 mg/kg was orally administered to common marmosets for 28 days, total, low density lipoprotein (LDL)- and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels were decreased in a dose dependent manner, whereas triglycerides and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol did not change. These findings confirm that common marmosets have serum lipid and lipoprotein profiles similar to those in humans suggesting that they are susceptible to lipid lowering effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.",

After a 4-week placebo run-in period, they were randomly assigned to simvastatin or gemfibrozil. The simvastatin group (n = 47) received 10 mg once nightly for 8 weeks, 20 mg for the next 8 weeks, and 40 mg for the third 8-week period. The gemfibrozil group (n = 49) received 600 mg twice daily throughout the 24 weeks. The lipid-lowering efficacies of both drugs were compared in all patients as well as separately in patients with CHL and IHC.", 
    "12": "In all patients, simvastatin reduced LDL and total cholesterol and the LDL-to-HDL cholesterol ratio more effectively, whereas gemfibrozil was more effective in elevating HDL cholesterol and decreasing triglyceride levels. The drug effects differed according to lipid phenotype at baseline. Simvastatin decreased LDL cholesterol levels by 30-40% in both phenotypes. Gemfibrozil caused a 15% reduction in LDL cholesterol in IHC but no change in CHL patients. Simvastatin produced 15-30% reductions in triglyceride levels in CHL but no change in IHC patients. Gemfibrozil caused reductions in triglycerides in CHL (50% and more) and in IHC (40%) patients, with 12-18% increases in HDL cholesterol in these groups.", 
    "13": "Simvastatin is useful in both CHL and IHC patients, whereas gemfibrozil can be used in patients with high triglyceride and low or normal LDL cholesterol levels.", 
    "14": "We analyzed the effect of isoprenoid depletion by fluvastatin on bradykinin (BK)- and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-mediated Ca2+ mobilization and prostaglandin E2 production, in the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT. BK and EGF stimulated Ca2+ mobilization in an agonist-dependent manner. The synthesis of prostaglandin E2 paralleled the level of Ca2+ mobilization induced by BK and EGF. Treatment with fluvastatin increased the EGF-promoted but not the BK-promoted Ca2+ mobilization and prostaglandin E2 production in Ca(2+)-containing medium. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, fluvastatin treatment led to an increase in intracellular Ca2+ release by both agonists. This effect was abolished by depleting the intracellular pool of Ca2+ with thapsigargin. Our findings showed that the intracellular Ca2+ release was dependent on the metabolism of mevalonate and that the Ca2+ mobilization modulated prostaglandin E2 synthesis in human keratinocytes.", 
    "15": "Endothelial dysfunction is an important early event in atherogenesis. Changes in arterial endothelial physiology were studied in patients with severe primary hypercholesterolaemia participating in an ongoing clinical trial evaluating atorvastatin and simvastatin. Endothelial function was assessed non-invasively using brachial ultrasound and the primary outcome measure was flow-mediated endothelium-dependent dilatation (FMD) in response to reactive hyperaemia. Patients were studied upon entry while still using simvastatin 40 mg daily and again after a 10-week washout (baseline). Over the next 30 weeks, 20 patients received atorvastatin titrated up to 80 mg daily and 12 patients received simvastatin titrated up to 40 mg daily (plus cholestyramine 4 g daily in 10/12), followed by a final ultrasound study. During simvastatin washout, total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol rose by a median 23-29% and 30-34%, respectively. During atorvastatin therapy, total and LDL cholesterol fell by a median of 41 and 46%, respectively, triglycerides fell by 45%, and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol rose by 10%. During simvastatin plus cholestyramine therapy, the respective median changes were - 32, - 39, - 44 and + 11%. Patients at baseline showed evidence of impaired FMD and this improved significantly on either treatment, from a median + 2.2 to + 5.5% on atorvastatin and from + 1.8 to + 4.5% on simvastatin plus cholestyramine (P < 0.01 for both treatments). Typical response in healthy subjects would be from + 8 to + 9%. FMD at baseline was correlated with HDL cholesterol (r=0.49, P < 0.01). Change in FMD was inversely correlated with baseline FMD (r=-0.54, P < 0.001). Endothelial dysfunction in primary hypercholesterolaemia was improved by treatment with atorvastatin or simvastatin plus cholestyramine and this effect may result in the prevention of future coronary events.",

    "18": "As expected Simvastatin (20 mg day[-1]) reduced serum total cholesterol, triacylglycerols, apolipoproteins B and E and increased HDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1. Addition of omega-3 fatty acids (4 g day[-1]) further decreased serum triacylglycerols (P = 0.007), total cholesterol (P = 0.052) and apolipoprotein E (P = 0.035). No significant changes attributable to supplementation of polyunsaturated fatty acids on the content of lipid peroxides in plasma and in the various lipoprotein fractions were observed.",

    "20": "The present study was addressed to understand the interrelationship between Receptor-Ck activation, mevalonate pathway and primary response genes such as c-fos, c-myc and cyclin 'D' involved in the cell cycle. The results reported here unambiguously revealed that the phosphatidic acid (generated through the activation of Receptor-Ck by cholesterol) regulates mevalonate pathway, DNA synthesis as well as expression of genes coding for c-fos, c-myc and cyclin 'D'. By using the specific blockers of ras farnesylation as well as phospholipase D, it became apparent that phosphatidic acid regulates two processes: (a) activation of Gap-ras pathway leading to the expression of c-fos, c-myc proto-oncogenes probably through the activation of NF1 transcription factor; (b) cleavage of 125 kDa endoplasmic reticulum protein leading to the generation of 47 kDa protein factor which not only regulates mevalonate pathway but also has an ability to heterodimerize with Receptor-Ck protein and this heterodimer may be responsible for the regulation of cyclin 'D' expression probably by binding to the SRE like sequence present in the promoter region of this gene. On the basis of these findings, we propose a pathway through which Receptor-Ck upon endocytosis regulate these primary response genes (c-fos, c-myc, cyclin 'D') involved in the cell cycle.",

    "22": "To assess the effect of the lipidosterolic extract of Serenoa repens (LSESr) on in vitro cell proliferation in biopsies of human prostate", 
    "23": "Cell proliferation was assessed by incorporation of [3H]thymidine followed by historadiography.", 
    "24": "Basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) induced a considerable increase in human prostate cell proliferation (from +100 to +250%); the glandular epithelium was mainly affected, minimal labeling being recorded in the other regions of the prostate. Similar results were observed with epidermal growth factor (EGF), although the increase in cell proliferation was not recorded in some cases. Lovastatin, an inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A, antagonized both the basal proliferation and the growth factor-stimulated proliferation of human prostate epithelium (EGF, mean inhibition approximately 80-95%; b-FGF, mean inhibition approximately 40-90%). Geraniol, a precursor of both farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, and farnesol, the precursor of farnesyl pyrophosphate, increased cell proliferation only in some prostate specimens, this effect being antagonized by lovastatin. LSESr did not affect basal prostate cell proliferation, with the exception of two prostate specimens in which a significant inhibition of basal proliferation was observed with the highest concentration of LSESr (30 micrograms/ ml). In contrast, LSESr inhibited b-FGF-induced proliferation of human prostate cell cultures; this effect was significant for the highest concentration of LSESr (30 micrograms/ml). In some prostate samples, a similar inhibition was also noted with lower concentrations. Unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), in the range 1-30 ng/ml), did not affect the basal prostate cell proliferation, only a slight increase in cell proliferation was noted in 1 prostate specimen. UFA (1, 10 or 30 micrograms/ml) markedly inhibited the b-FGF-induced cell proliferation down to the basal value. Lupenone, hexacosanol and the unsaponified fraction of LSESr markedly inhibited the b-FGF-induced cell proliferation, whereas a minimal effect on basal cell proliferation was noted.", 
    "25": "Despite the large variability in the response of the prostate samples to b-FGF, these results indicate that LSESr and its components affect the proliferative response of prostate cells to b-FGF more than their basal proliferation.", 
    "26": "A number of recent clinical trials have clearly demonstrated the efficacy of cholesterol lowering as a risk-reduction strategy for the primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD). The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S), the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS), and the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events (CARE) trial, as well as numerous other investigations, have established that decreasing elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol will result in a reduction in CAD risk. This has been reported since the 1980s, when the first of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (\"statins\") became available. These drugs were an important advance because they showed better patient compliance due to fewer side effects when compared with other lipid-lowering agents. Nonetheless, many physicians, for various reasons, have not done an adequate job of ensuring that the millions of patients who could benefit from lipid-lowering therapy actually receive the treatment they require.", 
    "27": "Bisphosphonates are currently the most important class of antiresorptive drugs used for the treatment of metabolic bone diseases. Although the molecular targets of bisphosphonates have not been identified, these compounds inhibit bone resorption by mechanisms that can lead to osteoclast apoptosis. Bisphosphonates also induce apoptosis in mouse J774 macrophages in vitro, probably by the same mechanisms that lead to osteoclast apoptosis. We have found that, in J774 macrophages, nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (such as alendronate, ibandronate, and risedronate) inhibit post-translational modification (prenylation) of proteins, including the GTP-binding protein Ras, with farnesyl or geranylgeranyl isoprenoid groups. Clodronate did not inhibit protein prenylation. Mevastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutatyl (HMG)-CoA reductase and hence the biosynthetic pathway required for the production of farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, also caused apoptosis in J774 macrophages and murine osteoclasts in vitro. Furthermore, alendronate-induced apoptosis, like mevastatin-induced apoptosis, could be suppressed in J774 cells by the addition of farnesyl pyrophosphate or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, while the effect of alendronate on osteoclast number and bone resorption in murine calvariae in vitro could be overcome by the addition of mevalonic acid. These observations suggest that nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate drugs cause apoptosis following inhibition of post-translational prenylation of proteins such as Ras. It is likely that these potent antiresorptive bisphosphonates also inhibit bone resorption by preventing protein prenylation in osteoclasts and that enzymes of the mevalonate pathway or prenyl protein transferases are the molecular targets of the nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates. Furthermore, the data support the view that clodronate acts by a different mechanism.", 
    "28": "To differentiate effects of lovastatin on low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor activity from effects on LDL metabolic properties, LDL apolipoprotein B (apoB) turnover was studied in eight hyperlipidemic subjects during baseline and lovastatin treatment, in the latter case with LDL tracers isolated during both baseline (CLDL) and drug treatment (Rx-LDL) conditions. Lovastatin (40 mg/day) significantly lowered total plasma and LDL cholesterol levels (27% and 25%, respectively) as well as plasma triglyceride levels (30%). Using contemporaneous tracers (C-LDL before and Rx-LDL during treatment), lovastatin caused a modest increase in LDL fractional catabolic rate (FCR) (0.410+/-0.113 vs. 0.339+/-0.108 pools/day, P < 0.04 by paired t). The increase in LDL tracer FCR was higher when C-LDL tracer isolated during the untreated period was injected during lovastatin treatment (0.496+/-0.177 vs. 0.339+/-0.108 pools/day, P < 0.02). These in vivo studies in humans were confirmed by injecting LDL tracers from two patients into five guinea pigs. The C-LDL tracer was cleared consistently faster than the Rx-LDL tracer (0.082+/-0.018 vs. 0.057+/-0.015 pools/h, P< 0.001). The results demonstrate three important outcomes of lovastatin treatment in these subjects: LDL receptor activity increased by 49% (P < 0.02); LDL apoB production rate decreased by 17% (P < 0.03), and LDL particle in vivo affinity for the LDL receptor decreased by 15% (P < 0.01). The decrease in LDL particle affinity partially negated the expected effect of increased LDL receptors on LDL clearance. The present study provides an explanation for earlier observations by several investigators using contemporaneous tracers that treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors resulted in only modest increases in low density lipoprotein functional catabolic rate.", 
    "29": "Some patients with coronary artery disease experience continued progression of one or more coronary lesions despite treatment with drugs that inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity and markedly lower plasma cholesterol levels. We examined relationships between the progression of coronary artery lesions and plasma lipoproteins, in particular intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) and its composition, in 38 patients with coronary artery disease who had been treated with simvastatin for 2 years. Patients were given lipid-lowering dietary advice; 3 months later they were started on simvastatin therapy (10 mg/d) for 1 month, and after review of their plasma cholesterol levels, the dose was increased to 20 mg/d and later to 40 mg/d if the target level of plasma cholesterol had not been attained. Progression of lesions was determined by serial quantitative coronary angiography (variability of 5.5%) and was defined as an increase in percent diameter stenosis (%S)> or =10%; regression was defined as a decrease in %S > or =10%. The proportions of cholesteryl esters (CEs) and free cholesterol decreased significantly (P<.001), and proportions of protein and triglycerides increased significantly (P<.001) in IDL during simvastatin therapy. The CE content of IDL decreased significantly (-7.2 weight [wt]%, n=20, P<.001) in nonprogressors (patients who did not show progression of any lesions) and did not change significantly (-1.8 wt%, n=14, P=.36) in progressors (patients who showed progression of one or more lesions without regression of any lesion). This decrease in IDL CE content in nonprogressors was significantly (P=.01) different compared with the corresponding change in patients classified as progressors. Mean plasma cholesterol concentration tended to increase in progressors (0.47 mmol/L) and tended to decrease in nonprogressors (-0.39 mmol/L) during the initial 3-month diet period, and these changes were significantly different (P=.02). Furthermore, this change in plasma cholesterol level during the initial diet period was correlated significantly with the change in IDL CE content during the entire study (r=.348, n=38, P=.03). These data suggest that IDL CE content may be a determinant of progression of coronary lesions and may be influenced by compliance with or metabolic response to lipid-lowering dietary advice in patients with coronary artery disease during simvastatin treatment.", 
    "30": "Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a congenital metabolic disorder predisposing to severe atherosclerosis resulting in coronary heart disease sometimes even at early adult age. Children with FH lack the stigmata at physical examination and measuring the cholesterol level does not always enable the clinician to make the diagnosis. In about 70% of the cases, the diagnosis of FH in childhood can be made by means of molecular-biological examination, by demonstrating the underlying defect of the LDL cholesterol receptor gene. In the remaining cases, the combination of the positive family history for cardiovascular diseases and increased total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels should suggest the diagnosis of FH. Pharmaceutical agents inhibiting the cholesterol synthesis have been researched very little in children and are not registered in the Netherlands. Nevertheless, drug treatment of children with FH is advisable because of the better possibilities to make a definite diagnosis and the early occurrence of coronary heart disease. If this treatment were indicated before patients reach adult age, the question arises whether screening for FH of children in families in which this disorder prevails, should not be promoted more strongly.",

    "32": "Twelve healthy subjects participated in a randomized two-way crossover study. Each subject received atorvastatin 10 mg every morning for 2 weeks and atorvastatin 10 mg every morning with cimetidine 300 mg four times a day for 2 weeks, separated by a 4-week washout period. Steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters (based on an enzyme inhibition assay) and lipid responses were compared.", 
    "33": "Pharmacokinetic parameters and lipid responses were similar following administration of atorvastatin alone and atorvastatin with cimetidine. Mean values for Cmax (the maximum concentration) were 5.11 ng eq.ml(-1) and 4.54 ng eq.ml(-1), for tmax (the time to reach maximum concentration) 2.2 h and 1.3 h, for AUC0-24 (area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 h to 24 h) 58.6 ng eq.h.ml(-1) and 58.5 ng eq.h.ml(-1), and for t1/2 (terminal half-life) 10.1 h and 17.0 h, respectively, following administration of atorvastatin alone and atorvastatin with cimetidine. Following treatment with atorvastatin alone and atorvastatin with cimetidine, mean values for the percentage change from baseline for total cholesterol were -29.5% and -29.9%, for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol -41.0% and -42.6%, for high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol 6.3% and 5.8%, and for triglycerides -33.8% and -25.8%, respectively.",

    "35": "Cerivastatin is a novel, synthetic, highly potent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor that effectively reduces serum cholesterol levels at very low doses. It is exclusively cleared from humans via cytochrome P450-mediated biotransformation (demethylation M1; hydroxylation M23) and subsequent biliary/renal excretion of the metabolites. The influence of concomitant administration of erythromycin, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, on cerivastatin bioavailability and pharmacokinetics was investigated.", 
    "36": "Twelve healthy young male subjects received single oral doses of 300 microg cerivastatin alone or on the 4th day of a 4-day pre- and co-treatment with erythromycin 500 mg t.i.d. in a randomised, non-blind crossover study. Plasma and urine samples were analysed for cerivastatin and its major metabolites by validated specific high-performance liquid chromatography assays.", 
    "37": "Cerivastatin was safe and well tolerated. No clinically relevant treatment-emergent changes in laboratory parameters were observed. The pre- and co-treatment with erythromycin 500 mg t.i.d. had a modest influence on cerivastatin clearance, leading to a mean increase in the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of 13% and a slightly increased terminal half-life (approximately 10%), resulting in a mean elevation of the area under the curve (AUC) of 21%; time to peak (tmax) remained unchanged. While the mean AUC of the metabolite M1 following the combined dosing was decreased by 60% compared with mono-dosing, the mean AUC of M23 exhibited an increase of approximately 60%. The respective Cmax results paralleled these pronounced effects, whereas the influence on mean terminal half-lives was small (i.e. for M23, an approximate 20% increase) or not observable (i.e. for M1).", 
    "38": "Concomitant administration of erythromycin 500 mg t.i.d. affects, to a certain extent, the metabolism of cerivastatin, administered as a single oral dose of 300 microg, resulting in a slightly increased exposure of the parent drug and active metabolites which, however, does not need dose adjustment. In addition, the small increase in cerivastatin half-life does not predict an accumulation beyond steady state. The pharmacokinetic data for the major metabolites suggest that the M1 metabolic pathway is more sensitive to CYP3A4 inhibition than the parallel M23 pathway, supporting recent in vitro findings that further cytochrome P450 isozymes are differently involved in the metabolic pathways of cerivastatin.", 
    "39": "The benefits of cholesterol lowering for primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD) have been well established. However, to accurately assess a patient's risk for CAD, clinicians must be aware of their patients' specific levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides, and not just total serum cholesterol. Clinicians must also evaluate other factors in assessing a patient's risk profile. These include smoking, weight, family history of CAD, age, hypertension, and others. Absolute risk, rather than relative risk, can then be determined. Although LDL cholesterol may be the most potent predictor of risk, triglycerides are also an important indicator of CAD risk. Currently, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (\"statins\") are first-line therapy for the reduction of elevated levels of LDL cholesterol. All statins are effective in achieving some level of LDL cholesterol lowering. However, atorvastatin, which was recently introduced in the United States, has greater efficacy at maximal dosage in lowering LDL cholesterol, and also has a more beneficial effect on elevated levels of triglycerides, than other statins.", 
    "40": "Hypercholesterolemia, particularly an elevated level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, is an unarguably established risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD). It is equally well established that lowering LDL cholesterol levels will decrease CAD-related morbidity and mortality in patients with established CAD. Although lipid-lowering therapy is known to retard the progression of atherosclerosis in patients with native coronary arteries, its effect in patients with coronary bypass grafts, which are particularly vulnerable to occlusion, is less well understood. Moreover, whereas several major clinical trials have documented the benefits of lowering LDL cholesterol in a variety of patient subpopulations, there has been far less clarity surrounding the question of whether aggressive lowering of LDL cholesterol is of greater benefit than moderate lowering of LDL cholesterol. The Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (Post-CABG) trial, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial comprising 1,351 patients with elevated levels of LDL cholesterol and a history of bypass surgery was designed to determine whether aggressive lowering of LDL cholesterol levels with therapy based on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (\"statins\") is more effective than moderate lowering in delaying the progression of atherosclerosis in bypass grafts. Quantitative computer-assisted angiography was conducted at baseline and again at an average of 4.3 years. The primary angiographic outcome was the mean percentage per patient of grafts with a decrease of > or = 0.6 mm in lumen diameter. Patients who received aggressive therapy were significantly more likely than their moderate-treatment counterparts to achieve and maintain LDL cholesterol levels within the National Cholesterol Education Program's (NCEP's) recommended target of < or = 100 mg/dL (< or = 2.59 mmol/L). Moreover, the mean percentage of grafts with progression of atherosclerosis was 27% for aggressively treated patients, compared with 39% for those who were randomized to the moderate-treatment group (p < 0.001). This study demonstrates that aggressive lipid lowering is practical and worthwhile in at-risk patients. Aggressive treatment is far more effective than moderate treatment in lowering LDL cholesterol levels to the NCEP target level of < or = 100 mg/dL (< or = 2.59 mmol/L), and this intervention decreases the progression of atherosclerosis.", 
    "41": "Atherosclerotic vascular disease is the major cause of death and disability in adult men and women living in the United States, where 13-14 million adults have a history of coronary artery disease (CAD). One-third of the 1.5 million individuals who experience a myocardial infarction (MI) each year will die and one half of these deaths will occur within 60 minutes of the event. The relation between elevated serum lipids and CAD has been corroborated by epidemiologic as well as pathologic evidence. Approximately 96 million people have total cholesterol levels > 200 mg/dL, with 38 million of these individuals having values > 240 mg/ dL. The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) identified elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol as a primary risk factor for CAD in 1988. This conclusion, along with recommendations for assessment and treatment, was reaffirmed in 1993. The NCEP also recommended that high-risk patients, with or without clinical manifestations of coronary atherosclerosis, should substantially lower their serum cholesterol levels. Specifically, the NCEP recommends that patients with CAD need to maintain serum LDL cholesterol levels of < or = 100 mg/dL; this means that the vast majority of patients need to decrease LDL cholesterol levels by > or = 30%. Aggressive dietary and/or drug therapy are recommended to achieve these reductions. In recent years, clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (\"statins\") in lowering elevated levels of LDL cholesterol and decreasing the risk for clinical coronary events.",

Nineteen subjects with calculated creatinine clearances ranging from 13 mL/min to 143 mL/min were administered 10 mg atorvastatin daily for 2 weeks. Pharmacokinetic parameters and lipid responses were analyzed by regression on calculated creatinine clearance. Correlations between steady-state atorvastatin pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic parameters and creatinine clearance were weak and, in general, did not achieve statistical significance. Although the elimination rate constant, lambda z (0.579), was significantly correlated with creatinine clearance, neither maximum plasma concentration (Cmax, -0.361) nor oral clearance (Cl/F, 0.306) were; thus, steady-state exposure is not altered. Renal impairment has no significant effect on pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin.",

In both studies, 10 healthy volunteers received either 200 mg itraconazole or placebo orally once a day for 4 days. On day 4, each subject ingested a single 40 mg dose of simvastatin (study I) or pravastatin (study II). Serum concentrations of simvastatin, simvastatin acid, pravastatin, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, itraconazole, and hydroxyitraconazole were determined.",

The Cmax and AUC(0-infinity) of total simvastatin acid (naive simvastatin acid plus that derived by hydrolysis of the lactone) were increased 17-fold and 19-fold (p < 0.001), respectively, and the half-life (t1/2) was increased by 25% (p < 0.05). The AUC(0-infinity) of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors was increased fivefold (p < 0.001) and the Cmax and t1/2 were increased threefold (p < 0.001). In study II, itraconazole slightly increased the AUC(0-infinity) and Cmax of pravastatin, but the changes were statistically nonsignificant (p = 0.052 and 0.172, respectively). The t1/2 was not altered. The AUC(0-infinity) and Cmax of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were increased less than twofold (p < 0.05 and p = 0.063, respectively) by itraconazole. There were no differences in the serum concentrations of itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole between studies I and II.",

    "47": "The mechanism by which depletion of hepatic cholesterol levels, achieved by inhibition of squalene synthase, alters hepatic LDL receptor, HMG-CoA reductase, and cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase gene expression was investigated by measuring transcription rates, mRNA stability, rates of translation, translational efficiency, and levels of sterol response element binding proteins. It was found that the transcription of both hepatic LDL receptor and HMG-CoA reductase were increased about twofold. The increase in LDL receptor transcription occurred within 2 h after giving 2 mg/kg zaragozic acid A, a potent inhibitor of squalene synthase. This preceded the increase in transcription of HMG-CoA reductase that occurred at 4 h. Increases in the stability of both of these mRNAs were also observed. These changes account for the increases in LDL receptor and HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels previously observed. The rate of transcription of hepatic cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase was decreased to about 25% of control within 3 h after administration of zaragozic acid A, which correlates with the decrease in this mRNA. The rates of translation, as determined by pulse labeling, of both hepatic HMG-CoA reductase and LDL receptor were increased two- to threefold. The translational efficiency of these two mRNAs was also increased as judged by polysome profile analysis. There was an increase in mRNA associated with the heaviest polysome fraction and a decrease in that associated with monosomes. No significant change was observed in the levels of sterol response element binding protein 2, the form that mediates induced transcription, in response to zaragozic acid A treatment, indicating that this protein might not be involved in mediating the observed transcriptional changes. An increase in sterol response element binding protein -1 was observed 30 min after giving zaragozic acid A. The results suggest that compensatory responses to depletion of squalene-derived products involve alterations in the rates of transcription, mRNA stability, and translational of key proteins involved in cholesterol homeostasis.", 
    "48": "The Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a common birth defect-mental retardation syndrome caused by a defect in the enzyme that reduces 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol. Because of this block, patients' plasma cholesterol levels are generally low while 7-dehydrocholesterol concentrations are markedly elevated. In addition, plasma total sterols are abnormally low and correlate negatively with the percent of 7-dehydrocholesterol (r = -0.65, P < 0.0001) suggesting that 7-dehydrocholesterol might inhibit the activity of HMG-CoA reductase. Cultured skin fibroblasts from SLOS patients grown in fetal bovine serum or for 1 day in delipidated medium contain little 7-dehydrocholesterol (3 +/- 1% of total sterols) and HMG-CoA reductase activities are indistinguishable from that measured in control cells. However, raising the 7-dehydrocholesterol concentration to 20 +/- 3% of total sterols, equal to the mean proportion in plasma of SLOS patients, by either growing cells for 1 week in delipidated medium or adding 20 microg/ml 7-dehydrocholesterol directly to the cells reduced HMG-CoA reductase activities from 74 +/- 7 to 9 +/- 2 pmol/min per mg protein, or from 92 +/- 22 to 16 +/- 4 pmol/min per mg protein, respectively (P < 0.01). In contrast, adding 20 microg/ml cholesterol evoked a 2- to 4-fold lesser suppression of activity (39 +/- 8 pmol/min per mg protein, P < 0.05, vs. 7-dehydrocholesterol). HMG-CoA synthase and LDL binding were inhibited equally by 7-dehydrocholesterol and cholesterol. Ketaconazole prevented the down-regulation of HMG-CoA reductase by 7-dehydrocholesterol, suggesting that an hydroxylated derivative of 7-dehydrocholesterol may be especially important in suppressing cholesterol synthesis. These results demonstrate that 7-dehydrocholesterol, perhaps as an hydroxylated derivative(s), is a very effective feedback inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase.",

    "58": "Besides its pharmacological effect on cholesterol biosynthesis, lovastatin inhibits p21ras proteins by substrate depletion for post-translational protein farnesylation and geranylation. This inhibition has previously been used to reverse cell proliferation after cellular transformation by the mutant p21ras oncogene. We investigated the biological effects of lovastatin on two pancreatic carcinoma cell lines. The SW-850 cell line contained the k-ras wild-type gene and the A818-4 cell line contained the mutant gene with a point mutation at codon 12 (GGTZCGT; glyZarg). Lovastatin inhibited the proliferation of pancreatic carcinoma cells dose-dependently showing an IC20-30 at 5 microM and IC40-50 at 10 microM. Proliferation of both cancer cell lines, A818-4 (p21ras-M) and SW-850 (p21ras-WT) were inhibited to a very similar extent. After 24 h of drug exposure, cell cycle arrest in G1 and G2/M-phase occurred in a large proportion of cells. At this time, neither cell line showed alteration of protein phosphorylation and did not undergo apoptosis. However, after 72 h of drug exposure, lovastatin significantly decreased protein phosphorylation on tyrosine, serine and threonine residues in A818-4 (p21ras-M) cells. Only a minute reduction of protein phosphorylation was detected in SW-850 (p21ras-WT) cells. Apoptosis occurred in both cell lines, but the SW-850 (p21ras-WT) showed a higher percentage of apoptotic cells than the A818-4 (p21ras-M). In conclusion, there is further evidence for a growth inhibitory effect on cancer cells regardless of the ras mutation status. However, as the effects on protein phosphorylation and induction of apoptosis differed between the mutant and wild-type cell lines, the mechanism of action of lovastatin may depend on partially different mechanisms.", 
    "59": "Although epidemiologic studies proved that a causal relationship exists between elevated serum cholesterol levels and coronary heart disease, it is only recently that cholesterol-lowering strategies have shown significant reductions in total mortality. In the last few years, three landmark coronary artery disease-reduction trials with HMG-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) showed significant reductions in coronary heart disease and mortality. Statins have beneficial effects on coronary heart disease and overall mortality in primary and secondary prevention, including in women and the elderly. Angiographic studies reveal the potential mechanisms through which statins exert their clinical benefits.", 
    "60": "The relationship between molecular defect and clinical phenotype has been examined in 42 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) and premature coronary heart disease. The defined defects included mutations in the low density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor gene (23/42) or the apolipoprotein B Arg3500Gln mutation (5/42). Mean LDL-cholesterol was higher, both before and during treatment with simvastatin and bile acid sequestrants, in patients predicted as having a 'severe' mutation than in those with a 'mild' mutation (8.72 +/- 2.02 mmol/l vs 6.63 +/- 1.8, P = 0.05 before and 4.51 +/- 0.90 mmol/l vs 3.19 +/- 0.58, P = 0.05 during treatment). Maximum inducible LDL-receptor activity in cultured lymphoblasts was inversely correlated with LDL-cholesterol before (r2 = 0.499, P = 0.002) and during (r2 = 0.478, P = 0.004) treatment in patients with a defined mutation in the LDL-receptor gene, but not in the 14 patients with no detectable molecular defect. LDL-cholesterol concentrations before and during treatment were significantly correlated in patients with a defined LDL-receptor gene mutation (r2 = 0.548, P = 0.0001), but not in those with no detectable genetic defect. All these correlations were weak, however and there were no differences in the response to treatment in terms of either relative reduction or absolute decrease in LDL-cholesterol concentration between patients with different LDL-receptor defects. We conclude that only part of the variable phenotype of heterozygous FH patients is explained by different LDL-receptor defects and that other factors determine the severity of their hypercholesterolaemia and the onset of coronary disease.", 
    "61": "To investigate whether fluvastatin lowers cholesterol and blood pressure in hypertensives and hypercholesterolemic patients, 23 patients followed by their medical practitioner received 40 mg fluvastatin once a day for 12 weeks.

Lowering of blood pressure is independent of lowering of cholesterol.", 
    "62": "Subjects with diabetes have a greatly increased risk of CHD, which is only partially related to their elevated glucose. Other factors such as insulin resistance and dyslipidemia are likely to be important. The type of dyslipidemia that is most characteristic of type 2 diabetic subjects is elevated triglycerides and decreased HDL cholesterol levels, although all lipoproteins have compositional abnormalities. Surprisingly few good prospective studies of lipoprotein levels in relation to CHD have been done in diabetic subjects. Available studies suggest that low HDL cholesterol may be the most important risk factor for CHD in observational studies. In studies in which total cholesterol and triglyceride were done, cholesterol and triglycerides were risk factors for CHD, although triglycerides were often a stronger predictor. However, the strength of triglyceride as a risk factor for CHD may depend partially on its association with other variables (e.g., hypertension, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 [PAI-1], etc.). In clinical trials in diabetic subjects, LDL reduction with statins has led to significant reductions in CHD incidence. In addition, overall mortality was reduced with statin therapy, although the results were not statistically significant. Gemfibrozil has led to reductions in CHD incidence in diabetic subjects, although the results were not statistically significant perhaps because of low sample size. Regarding lipoproteins and CHD risk in diabetic patients, the very positive results of statin trials point to LDL cholesterol being more important than previous realized. Apparently, having a borderline high LDL cholesterol (between 130 and 160 mg/dl) in a diabetic patient is equivalent to a much higher LDL cholesterol in terms of CHD risk for a nondiabetic subject. Therefore, the primary target of therapy in diabetic patients is lowering LDL cholesterol (or possibly, non-HDL cholesterol). Statins are the preferred pharmacological agent in this situation. Once LDL cholesterol levels have been lowered, attention can be given to treatment of residual hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL. The goal here is weight reduction and increased exercise. However, for selected patients, combining a fibric acid (or low-dose nicotinic acid) with a statin also can be considered. Reduction of LDL levels should take priority over reduction of triglycerides in combined hyperlipidemia because of the proven safety of the statin class of drugs as well as greater reduction in CHD incidence.", 
    "63": "Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) causes endothelial dysfunction in part by decreasing the availability of endothelial nitric oxide (NO). Although HMG CoA reductase inhibitors restore endothelial function by reducing serum cholesterol levels, it is not known whether they can also directly upregulate endothelial NO synthase (ecNOS) activity.", 
    "64": "Human saphenous vein endothelial cells were treated with ox-LDL (50 microg/mL thiobarbituric acid reactive substances 12 to 16 nmol/mg) in the presence of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors simvastatin and lovastatin. In a time-dependent manner, ox-LDL decreased ecNOS mRNA and protein levels (91+/-4% and 67+/-8% reduction after 72 hours, respectively). Both simvastatin (1 micromol/L) and lovastatin (10 micromol/L) upregulated ecNOS expression by 3.8-fold and 3.6-fold, respectively, and completely prevented its downregulation by ox-LDL. These effects of simvastatin on ecNOS expression correlated with changes in ecNOS activity. Although L-mevalonate alone did not affect ecNOS expression, cotreatment with L-mevalonate completely reversed ecNOS upregulation by simvastatin. Actinomycin D studies revealed that simvastatin stabilized ecNOS mRNA (tau1/2, 43 versus 35 hours). Nuclear run-on assays and transient transfection studies with a -1.6 kb ecNOS promoter construct showed that simvastatin did not affect ecNOS gene transcription.",

Lett., 220 (1996) 21-24]. In the present paper, we examined whether the induced nitric oxide (NO) in the simvastatin-treated PC12 cells is involved in the growth arrest and differentiation as reported in nerve growth factor (NGF) treated PC12 cells. Treatment of PC12 cells with simvastatin caused peripherin formation and enhanced NO production just like NGF-treated PC12 cells. Different from NGF, however, NO synthase inhibitors could not affect the growth arrest and differentiation in simvastatin-treated PC12 cells. In conclusion, NO had nothing to do with cell division and differentiation in simvastatin-treated PC12 cells.",

Since endothelial NO release is intimately involved in the anti-atherosclerotic effects of the endothelium, we studied the effect of short-term lipid-lowering therapy on NO-mediated vasodilatation in patients with FCH. In view of only moderate LDL elevations, we evaluated whether alterations in other lipid fractions upon therapy correlated to changes in NO-mediated vasodilatation.",

FBF response to serotonin improved significantly upon lipid-lowering therapy (from 3.0 (0.3) to 5.7 (0.5); p < 0.05 treated vs. untreated). The level of improvement in endothelial function was significantly correlated to the absolute reduction of intermediate density lipoproteins upon lipid-lowering therapy (r = -0.64; p < 0.05), whereas it did not correlate to changes in VLDL- or LDL-cholesterol, nor to Lp(a).",

    "71": "Several recent pieces of clinical evidence have demonstrated that reduction of cholesterol levels positively affects outcomes in both primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic vascular disease. The mechanism for the beneficial effects of cholesterol-lowering interventions has been attributed to decreased progression or actual regression of plaques as a consequence of reduced circulating LDL concentrations. Other mechanisms can be hypothesized, including a \"stabilizing\" effect on plaques, which would decrease chances of rupture, and an improvement of endothelial dysfunction, which would slow-down the progression of the disease. This review is aimed at offering an update on such mechanisms. The hypothesis of a direct action of cholesterol-lowering agents, in particular of statins, on endothelial functions, independently of LDL-lowering effects, will be discussed.", 
    "72": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase is the major rate-limiting enzyme in sterol and non-sterol isoprenoid synthesis. Isoprenoids are involved in the mechanisms of cell proliferation and transformation leading notably to crucial post-translational maturation of small G-proteins of the Ras superfamily. HMG-CoA reductase is among the most highly regulated enzymes. It is controlled by several feedback regulation mechanisms induced by sterol and non-sterol metabolites. The present results show that tyrosine kinase activity is also involved in the regulation of HMG-CoA reductase activity in the human breast cancer cell line SKBR-3. Incubation of SKBR-3 cells with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, herbimycin A, induces a concentration-dependent reduction of HMG-CoA reductase activity with an IC50 of 80nM. The inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity by herbimycin A is also time-dependent. A similar effect of herbimycin A was obtained on the steady-state level of the HMG-CoA reductase protein. The effect of herbimycin A is probably specific as it abolished the stimulation of reductase activity by epidermal growth factor. To elucidate the molecular basis of the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity and protein level by herbimycin A, we performed experiments to study the metabolic turnover of this enzyme using [35S]methionine and [35]cysteine. Herbimycin A (1 microM) did not have any significant effect on the rate of HMG-CoA reductase protein degradation but did affect its rate of synthesis and mRNA levels. The decrease in protein synthesis rate correlates with the lower reductase protein level but is more pronounced than the decrease in mRNA levels. Taken together, the results reveal a novel pathway of regulation of HMG-CoA reductase expression and activity by cellular tyrosine kinase activities.", 
    "73": "Cerivastatin is a synthetic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor with high liver selectivity, which lowers plasma cholesterol levels by inhibiting endogenous cholesterol synthesis. In vitro, the affinity of cerivastatin for HMG-CoA reductase was higher than that of lovastatin, simvastatin and pravastatin. This higher enzyme affinity was reflected in vivo, with a lower ED50 (dose causing 50% inhibition) for cerivastatin in rats and beagle dogs compared with lovastatin. Cerivastatin 0.2 mg/day significantly reduced low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and increased high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels, in patients with type IIa hypercholesterolaemia. Available data indicate that cerivastatin has a tolerability profile similar to that of other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. No drug interactions were observed when cerivastatin was coadministered with digoxin, warfarin, cimetidine or the antacid magnesium/aluminium hydroxide.",

The reductions in coronary heart disease (CHD) and total mortality risk observed for the statins fell near the predictions from our earlier meta-analysis. Including the statin trial findings into the calculations led to a prediction that for every 10 percentage points of cholesterol lowering, CHD mortality risk would be reduced by 15% (P<.001), and total mortality risk would be reduced by 11% (P<.001), as opposed to the values of 13% and 10%, respectively, reported previously. Cholesterol lowering in general and by the statins in particular does not increase non-CHD mortality risk.", 
    "76": "Adding the results from the statin trials confirmed our original conclusion that lowering cholesterol is clinically beneficial. The relationships (slope) between cholesterol lowering and reduction in CHD and total mortality risk became stronger, and the standard error of the estimated slopes decreased by about half. Use of statins does not increase non-CHD mortality risk. The effect of the statins on CHD and total mortality risk can be explained by their lipid-lowering ability and appears to be directly proportional to the degree to which they lower lipids.",

Patients were randomly assigned to receive atorvastatin 10 mg once daily (n=55) or immediate-release niacin 1 g three times daily for 12 weeks (n=53). Patients were stratified based on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C): Patients with LDL-C > or =135 mg/dL were considered to have combined hyperlipidemia and patients with LDL-C <135 mg/dL were considered to have isolated hypertriglyceridemia. The primary outcome measure was percent change from baseline in LDL-C. Other lipid levels were evaluated as secondary parameters.",

There was a significant difference in LDL-C reduction, the primary efficacy parameter, between the two treatment groups (P <0.05, favoring atorvastatin), as well as a significant difference in the improvement in HDL-C (P <0.05, favoring niacin).

    "81": "The present two studies were designed to determine whether oxidized LDL contributes to the tubulointerstitial changes seen in rats during the acute phase of acute puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis (PAN). In the single-dose study, rats were given one injection of puromycin aminonucleoside (PA; 15 mg/100 g body wt) and killed 1, 2, or 3 wk thereafter. The four animal groups were saline controls, PAN controls, PAN plus probucol, and PAN plus lovastatin. This study showed that the addition of probucol significantly reduced the mean levels of serum cholesterol and renal lipid-peroxidation products, an effect not seen with lovastatin therapy. Compared with saline controls, PAN controls had a significant increase in total kidney collagen (7.9 +/- 1.2 versus 5.9 +/- 0.6 mg/kidney at 3 wk). Neither probucol nor lovastatin therapy attenuated the interstitial inflammation or fibrosis. In the multidose study, rats were given the same initial PA dose and were uninephrectomized on day 12. They were killed on day 35 after two smaller PA doses were given on days 16 and 23. Animal groups were saline controls, PAN controls, PAN plus probucol, and PAN plus vitamin E. Hepatic lipid-peroxidation products were significantly lower in the probucol-treated, but not in the vitamin E-treated, PAN groups when compared with the PAN controls. Neither probucol nor vitamin E prevented the increase in total kidney collagen that was observed in the PAN control group (7.4 +/- 0.7, 10.1 +/- 2.6, and 9.3 +/- 1.8 mg of collagen/kidney, respectively, versus 5.4 +/- 0.5 mg/kidney for the saline controls). Renal cortical mRNA levels for matrix-encoding genes and protease inhibitors were similar in the three nephrotic groups. Transforming growth factor-beta1 mRNA levels were highly variable within each group and not significantly different at day 35, but showed a significant positive correlation with the degree of albuminuria (r = 0.70). The present results demonstrate that the treatment of acutely nephrotic rats with antioxidant therapy did not attenuate interstitial inflammation or fibrosis. We speculate that other factors, possibly a consequence of proteinuria itself, are the predominant pathogenetic mediators of the tubulointerstitial damage in acute nephrotic syndrome.", 
    "82": "Trial evidence shows that effective lowering of serum total cholesterol and particularly of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is important for the prevention of total mortality, coronary artery disease mortality, and major coronary events. The role of serum triglyceride reduction in achieving clinical benefit is unclear and poorly documented. On the other hand, no specific trials have studied the importance of triglyceride lowering among patients with marked hypertriglyceridemia. One of the problems in assessing patients with high serum triglyceride levels may be the heterogeneous background of the molecular mechanisms that result in hypertriglyceridemia.", 
    "83": "In 1996, the first 2 studies using 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (\"statin\") therapy in hypertriglyceridemic subjects were published. In subjects with isolated triglyceride elevations who were treated with atorvastatin 5, 20, and 80 mg/day, large and dose-related reductions were noted. In subjects with combined hyperlipidemia treated with 10 mg simvastatin, triglyceride reduction similar to that reported for the 5 mg atorvastatin dose was seen. In response to these findings, we conducted comparative assessments to determine whether all statins are effective in lowering triglyceride levels and whether their effect on triglycerides is related to factors such as drug, dose, and baseline triglyceride levels. To standardize these assessments, we devised a ratio that related changes in triglyceride levels to the known predictable response of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to statins. This triglyceride/LDL cholesterol ratio was obtained by dividing the percent change from baseline in the triglyceride level by the percent change from baseline in the LDL cholesterol level. The triglyceride/LDL cholesterol ratio was initially applied to several published studies, and found to be approximately 1.0 and 0.5 in hypertriglyceridemic and nonhypertriglyceridemic populations, respectively. We then assessed the effect of various statins on triglycerides using a pooled laboratory database of 2,689 subjects who had participated in 7 separate studies with similar designs. All of the studies had a placebo run-in followed by a randomized, double-blind, active treatment phase of at least 4 weeks with a statin. Entry into these studies required a triglyceride level of <400 mg/dL. In subjects with baseline triglyceride >250 mg/dL, significant and dose-dependent reductions in triglyceride of 22-45% were seen with all statins. When baseline triglyceride was <150 mg/dL, no significant or dose-dependent effect on triglyceride was seen. The triglyceride/LDL cholesterol ratio was evaluated using a linear model that included baseline triglyceride level, drug, and dose. Only the baseline triglyceride level was significantly (p <0.001) related to this ratio. Moreover, the triglyceride/LDL cholesterol ratio was fairly constant across all statins and doses for patients with baseline triglyceride levels of <150 mg/dL, 150-250 mg/dL, and >250 mg/dL, at 0.0+/-0.3, 0.5+/-0.2, and 1.2+/-0.3, respectively. We conclude that all statins are effective in decreasing triglyceride levels, but only in hypertriglyceridemic patients. Due to the relatively constant triglyceride/LDL cholesterol ratio, our analysis indicates that the more effective the statin is in decreasing LDL cholesterol, the more effective it will also be in decreasing triglyceride levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia.", 
    "84": "To assess the long-term efficacy and use of fenofibrate together with a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (\"statin\") in the treatment of elevated levels of triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, we conducted a study that compared a before- and after-case series. The study involved 80 patients with a diagnosis of combined hyperlipidemia and existing coronary artery disease (81% of patients) or outpatients with > or = 3 risk factors for coronary artery disease who had been receiving treatment at a tertiary care center. Fasting biochemical measures were obtained at baseline during monotherapy with a statin consisting of pravastatin 20 mg once daily or simvastatin 10 mg once daily (39 patients) or fenofibrate 300 mg once daily (41 patients), and during a 2-year period of combination therapy. This combination therapy comprised fenofibrate 300 mg once daily or micronized fenofibrate 200 mg once daily taken together with pravastatin 20 mg once daily (63 patients) or simvastatin 10 mg once daily (17 patients). The main outcome measures were: (1) absolute and percent change in total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol; (2) percentage of patients with alanine aminotransferase > or = 2x the upper limits of normal on any occasion; (3) percentage of patients with creatinine kinase > or = 3 times the upper limits of normal on any occasion; (4) absolute changes in alanine aminotransferase and creatinine phosphokinase; and (5) months on combination therapy. Patients receiving combination therapy had a mean total cholesterol (+/- standard error of the mean [SEM]) that was significantly decreased by 26+/-1%, triglycerides by 41+/-3%, and LDL cholesterol by 28+/-2%, and mean HDL cholesterol that was significantly increased by 22+/-6%. These changes correspond to mean absolute changes of total cholesterol: -75+/-5 mg/dL; triglycerides: -94+/-13 mg/dL; LDL cholesterol: -52+/-5 mg/dL; and HDL cholesterol: 5+/-1 mg/dL. During combination treatment, alanine aminotransferase increased by 2+/-2 U/liter (not significant) and creatinine phosphokinase decreased by 4+/-13 U/liter (not significant). During treatment, 8 patients (10%) had transitory isolated elevations in alanine aminotransferase levels > or = 2 times the upper limits of normal and 2 patients (2.5%) had an isolated and transitory elevation of creatinine kinase (> or = 3x but < 6x upper limits of normal) without associated muscle symptoms. Patient-years on combination therapy equaled 220.6 (average 2.06 years per patient). The results demonstrated that combination treatment with fenofibrate and low-dose simvastatin or pravastatin is generally safe and effective for the treatment of combined hyperlipidemia in patients with normal hepatic and renal function.", 
    "85": "Patients in the original Familial Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (FATS) cohort were subgrouped into those with triglyceride levels < or = 120 mg/dL (n = 26) and those with triglyceride levels > or = 190 mg/dL (n = 40). Their therapeutic responses to niacin plus colestipol, lovastatin plus colestipol, colestipol alone, or placebo were determined. Therapeutic response was also determined in the same 2 triglyceride subgroups (n = 12 and n = 27, respectively) of patients selected for low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and coronary artery disease. These triglyceride criteria were chosen to identify patient subgroups with high likelihood of \"pattern A\" (normal-size low-density lipoprotein [LDL] particles and triglyceride < or = 120 mg/dL) or \"pattern B\" (small dense LDL and triglyceride > or = 190 mg/dL). Our findings in these small patient subgroups are consistent with the emerging understanding that coronary artery disease patients presenting with high triglyceride levels have lower HDL-C, smaller less buoyant LDL-C, and greater very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol and VLDL apolipoprotein B, and are more responsive to therapy as assessed by an increase in HDL-C and reduction in triglycerides, VLDL-C, and VLDL apolipoprotein B. In the FATS high-triglyceride subgroup with these characteristics, a tendency toward greater therapeutic improvement in coronary stenosis severity was observed among those treated with either of the 2 forms of intensive cholesterol-lowering therapy. This improvement is associated with therapeutic reduction of LDL-C and elevation of HDL-C, but also appears to be associated with drug-induced improvement in LDL buoyancy.", 
    "86": "Patients with diabetes mellitus have an increased risk for coronary artery disease due to hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and other risk factors. The diabetic dyslipidemia in these patients is characterized by moderately high levels of (1) serum cholesterol and triglycerides; (2) small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles; and (3) low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cho-lesterol concentrations. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated the benefits of cholesterol-lowering therapy in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients, thus supporting aggressive treatment of diabetic dyslipidemia for coronary artery disease prevention. A 3-step approach is recommended for the treatment of diabetic dyslipidemia. First, modification of diet and lifestyle, including decreased intakes of cholesterol, cholesterol-raising fats, and total energy, and increased physical activity should be advised. Second, good glycemic control should be achieved with diet and hypoglycemic drugs, if needed. Third, lipid-lowering drugs should be used, if necessary. Non-HDL cholesterol levels, which include both very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL cholesterol, should be the target of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The use of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (the \"statins\") has become the first-line drug therapy for diabetic dyslipidemia. Bile acid sequestrants are effective cholesterol-lowering agents in normotriglyceridemic patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia may require fibric acids or n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Nicotinic acid worsens hyperglycemia; therefore, it should be avoided in most cases. The efficacy and safety of estrogen-replacement therapy in postmenopausal women with diabetes needs to be determined. The combination of two lipid-lowering agents may be appropriate for some NIDDM patients but should be used judiciously.", 
    "87": "Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) is a heterogeneous genetic disorder characterized by multiple lipoprotein phenotypes. The genetic defect is unknown, although linkage to the region of the apolipoprotein (apo) A-I-apoC-III-apo A-IV gene cluster on chromosome 11 has been suggested. The metabolic abnormality in many affected individuals is overproduction of apoB-containing lipoproteins causing elevated levels of plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, or both. Low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and an abundance of dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles are other features contributing to the high association of this disorder with premature coronary artery disease. Many affected individuals need drug therapy to lower their lipid levels. The hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or \"statins,\" offer a potent therapeutic option in patients with FCHL. These drugs significantly decrease levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and apoB, although their effects on HDL cholesterol and triglycerides are limited. The mechanisms by which statins exert their beneficial effects in patients with FCHL remain controversial. We studied 7 patients with FCHL and 5 genetically uncharacterized patients with mixed lipemia during treatment with pravastatin 20 mg/day. Metabolic parameters of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-apoB and LDL-apoB were studied using endogenous labeling with stable isotopes. In all patients pravastatin caused an increase in fractional catabolic rates of LDL-apoB without a significant effect on the production rates of apoB-containing lipoproteins. We cannot exclude the possibility that higher doses of statins may decrease VLDL and LDL production.", 
    "88": "Our investigations indicate that most patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia have marked defects in the metabolism of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apolipoprotein B. Moreover, these patients have 2 major defects in the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, i.e., an accumulation of remnant lipoproteins (due in part to delayed hepatic clearance) and increased fractional conversion of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) to LDL. Defective triglyceride-rich lipoprotein metabolism has been associated with insulin resistance. Statin therapy in hypertriglyceridemic patients improves the lipoprotein profile by decreasing both LDL cholesterol and remnant lipoproteins. However, statin therapy does not normalize LDL apolipoprotein B metabolism, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels remain low. Therefore, consideration may be given to combining a statin with a drug that alters triglyceride metabolism (e.g., fibrate or nicotinic acid) in high-risk patients with hypertriglyceridemia.", 
    "89": "Hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or \"statins,\" have been extremely efficacious in decreasing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia and in treating patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia, a relatively rare form of hyperlipidemia. Clinical trials have indicated that statins can significantly lower very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglyceride levels, although the central mechanism of action of statins-i.e., increasing the number of LDL receptors-would appear to suggest that they would have no significant effect on VLDL levels. Through a review of published data from animal and human studies, this article addresses the important clinical question of how drugs that inhibit the rate-limiting enzyme for cholesterol can affect triglyceride metabolism.", 
    "90": "The importance of high serum cholesterol, especially a high level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, as a risk factor for coronary artery disease is well established. Likewise, efficacy for decreasing risk for coronary artery disease by LDL-lowering therapy has recently been documented through clinical trials. However, many high-risk patients manifest elevated serum triglyceride levels, and the role of hypertriglyceridemia in causation of coronary artery disease remains to be elucidated. Nonetheless, there is growing evidence that hypertriglyceridemia is a marker for increased risk for coronary artery disease; in fact, it can serve as a marker for several atherogenic factors. These factors include increased concentrations of atherogenic triglyceride-rich lipoproteins; the atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype, or lipid triad; and the metabolic syndrome. The lipid triad consists of elevated serum triglycerides, small LDL particles, and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The metabolic syndrome includes the coexistence of the lipid triad, elevated blood pressure, insulin resistance (plus glucose intolerance), and a prothrombotic state. Many previous studies indicate that hypertriglyceridemia is strongly associated with all of these atherogenic factors. The clinical approach to treatment of patients with hypertriglyceridemia thus requires a broad-based strategy that includes reduction of atherogenic triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, reversal of the lipid triad, and favorable modification of the metabolic syndrome. The development of therapeutic regimens to effect these changes poses a challenge for future research on the problem of hypertriglyceridemia.", 
    "91": "Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is known as a potent mitogen for a variety of cell types, including colon cancer cell lines. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of IGF-I on cell death induced by cytotoxic agents actinomycin D (Act-D), lovastatin (LOV), and doxorubicin (DOX) in the MCLM mouse colon cancer cell line, and the mechanisms involved. Subconfluent monolayer MCLM cells were treated with IGF-I (25 ng/ml) for 12 h in serum-free media. Various concentrations of cytotoxic agents then were added to the cells that were incubated continually at 37 degrees C for 24 h. Cell survival was determined with the MTT (3-[4-5-dimenthylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, which assesses mitochondrial function in living cells. The mRNA expression for multidrug resistance gene-1 (mdr-1), c-H-ras, and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in cells treated with IGF-I was examined by Northern blot or RNase protection assays. The levels of p-glycoprotein, a drug efflux pump encoded by the mdr-1 gene, were assessed by Western immunoblotting. Results demonstrated that 1) IGF-I significantly inhibited the cell death and apoptosis of MCLM cells treated with Act-D, LOV, or DOX; 2) IGF-I increased mRNA expression for mdr-1, c-H-ras, and MnSOD; 3) the p-glycoproteins in cells treated with IGF-I or stably transfected with c-H-ras were elevated when compared with control. These results suggest that IGF-I protects MCLM cells against death induced by cytotoxic agents; this acquired drug resistance may be mediated by multiple mechanisms, including promoting expression of mdr-1, c-H-ras, and MnSOD; whereas, the p-glycoprotein level stimulated by IGF-I may result partly from the increase of c-H-ras in the cells.", 
    "92": "The aim of this study was to examine the suppressive effect of simvastatin on intramural coronary arterial lesions in cholesterol-fed rabbits. In one experiment, six groups of rabbits were fed laboratory chow alone or with added 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.5% or 1.0% cholesterol for 16 weeks. In another experiment, four groups of rabbits were fed a 0.5% cholesterol diet and treated with simvastatin at 1, 3, or 5 mg/kg/day or placebo. In each rabbit, the levels of serum total cholesterol (TC) were determined at 1-week intervals to calculate the integrated values. The lesion induction ratio was defined as the ratio of intramural coronary arteries 50-150 microm in diameter with arterial lipoidosis to the total number of arteries of the same diameter. In the two experiments, there were positive correlations between the lesion induction ratio and integrated TC (r=0.785, P<0.0001 and r=0.763, P<0.0001, respectively). The slopes of the regression lines for integrated TC obtained in the two experiments were similar, but the lesion induction ratio in the simvastatin-treated group was always lower, by about 14%, in comparison with that in the non-simvastatin-treated group. These findings suggest that simvastatin induces lesion reduction not only by reducing the levels of circulating cholesterol but also by directly suppressing the development of lipoidosis.",

    "95": "Data were pooled for 21 completed (2502 patients) and 23 ongoing (1769 patients) clinical trials of atorvastatin conducted in US and international community- and university-based research centers. In these trials, patients with lipid disorders received atorvastatin at dosages of 10 to 80 mg/d. The majority of patients had moderate to severe hypercholesterolemia and were treated from 4 weeks to more than 24 months.", 
    "96": "Transaminase and creatine phosphokinase levels and adverse events were recorded.", 
    "97": "Atorvastatin was well tolerated; fewer than 2% of the atorvastatin-treated patients withdrew due to drug-attributable adverse events. The overall adverse event profile for atorvastatin was similar to that observed with other statins. The most common adverse events with atorvastatin as well as with other statins tested were constipation, flatulence, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain. Approximately 5% of atorvastatin-treated patients had serious adverse events; only 2 of these events were possibly associated with treatment. Thirty patients (0.7%) had confirmed transaminase elevations greater than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range. Most elevations occurred within 16 weeks of beginning treatment. No patients had a conclusive characterization of drug-induced myopathy.", 
    "98": "The safety profile of atorvastatin was consistent with that of all statins tested and was similar to that seen in all compounds of this class.", 
    "99": "Atorvastatin is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate and constitutes the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol. Steroid hormones derived from cholesterol, as well as mevalonate and its isoprenoid derivatives, provide important contributions to the maternal animal during pregnancy and lactation, as well as to the growth and development of the offspring; these contributions may potentially be influenced by inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. To investigate the effects of atorvastatin on various aspects of reproduction and development, female Sprague-Dawley rats received 0, 20, 100, or 225 mg/kg daily by gavage from gestation day 7 through lactation day 20. Maternal toxicity, characterized by morbidity/mortality (13%), reduced body weight gain and food consumption, and pathologic lesions in the nonglandular mucosa of the stomach, occurred at 225 mg/kg. Offspring survival at birth and during the neonatal period at 225 mg/kg was reduced relative to control by up to 45%, and 28% of litters had no viable offspring by 10 days postpartum. Additional effects on offspring included reduced body weight during the neonatal and maturation periods (100, 225 mg/kg), delayed appearance of pinnae detachment and incisor eruption (225 mg/kg), impaired rotorod performance (females only; 100, 225 mg/kg), reduced acoustic startle responding (males only; 20, 100, 225 mg/kg), and transient effects on shuttle avoidance (females only; 225 mg/kg). No treatment-related effects were observed on offspring reproduction. In a separate experiment, a single dose of 10 mg/kg atorvastatin administered to female Wistar rats on gestation day 19 or lactation day 13 provided evidence of placental transfer and excretion into the milk. Results of this study indicate that pre- and postnatal administration of atorvastatin to female rats produces developmental toxicity in their offspring via in utero and/or lactational exposure, and in the presence or absence of maternal toxicity.", 
    "100": "The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) was a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled multi-centre clinical trial of long-term Simvastatin therapy in patients with coronary heart disease who had total cholesterol levels between 5.5 and 8.0 mmol/l, comprising 4444 patients, equally distributed to a Simvastatin and a placebo group. Patients achieved a significant 30% relative reduction in overall mortality with Simvastatin therapy through a 42% relative reduction in coronary heart disease mortality. Lp(a) lipoprotein levels in Scandinavian coronary heart disease patients were strikingly higher than in healthy controls. Numbers of deaths in the Simvastatin group differed significantly between quartiles of Lp(a) lipoprotein levels, the reduction in deaths being most pronounced in the second (next to lowest) quartile. Subjects with major coronary events had significantly higher Lp(a) lipoprotein levels than subjects without such events, in all groups. The relationship between Lp(a) lipoprotein level and total mortality as well as between Lp(a) lipoprotein level and major coronary events was significantly different from zero, in logistic regression analyses. The findings show that Lp(a) lipoprotein predicts major coronary events as well as death in secondary prevention with Simvastatin. This prospective study provides independent confirmation that a high Lp(a) lipoprotein level is a significant coronary heart disease risk factor.",

    "102": "VLDL and LDL samples were obtained from patients with Familial Combined Hyperlipidaemia included in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study, with 8 weeks of active treatment (gemfibrozil, 600 mg twice daily, or lovastatin, 40 mg daily) and a 4-week wash-out period. Oxidation related analytes after Cu-induced oxidation of VLDL and LDL have been investigated. Further, in order to relate possible changes in oxidative behaviour to lipoprotein composition, the proportion of the lipid species transported by lipoproteins (triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesteryl esters), the molar composition of fatty acids for each lipoprotein lipid, and the content of antioxidant vitamins in plasma (vitamin C) and lipoproteins (vitamin E) have been studied.", 
    "103": "Both drugs reduced the plasma concentration of apo-B lipoproteins (-23% gemfibrozil, -26% lovastatin), but whereas lovastatin affected mainly LDL-cholesterol (-30%), gemfibrozil reduced triglycerides (-49%) and VLDL-cholesterol (-48%). Lovastatin treatment had no effect on the lipid and protein composition, the fatty acid profile, or the vitamin E content of either VLDL or LDL; likewise, lipoprotein oxidation markers (Cu-induced conjugated dienes, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances formation, and lysine residues) were similar before and after lovastatin treatment. Gemfibrozil therapy also had no effect on lipoprotein oxidation; nevertheless, it consistently: a) decreased the proportion of LDL-triglycerides (-32%), and b) increased the proportion (molar%) of 18:3 n-6 in VLDL triglycerides (+140%), phospholipids (+363%) and cholesteryl esters (+53%).", 
    "104": "Based on these results, lovastatin and gemfibrozil do not adversely affect lipoprotein oxidation in patients with mixed dyslipidaemia. In the case of gemfibrozil, this occurs in spite of an increased proportion of some polyunsaturated fatty acids in VLDL. In the context of a fixed dietary intake, such modifications suggest that the drug influences liver enzyme activities involved in fatty acid chain synthesis (elongases and desaturases).",

    "106": "Beginning with the description of clofibrate in 1962, derivatives of fibric acid (fibrates) have been used clinically to treat dyslipidaemias. Subsequently, gemfibrozil, fenofibrate, bezafibrate, ciprofibrate and long-acting forms of gemfibrozil, fenofibrate and bezafibrate have been developed. Clinically, this class of drugs appears to be most useful in lipoprotein disorders characterised by elevations of very low density lipoprotein and plasma triglycerides, which are often accompanied by reductions in high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. The principal effects are a reduction in triglyceride and increase in HDL levels, with increases in the activity of hepatic lipase and lipoprotein lipase. There is some reduction of low density lipoprotein (LDL), lipoprotein (a), fibrinogen and uric acid. As a class, these drugs are generally well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (immediate-acting fenofibrate being the exception) and display a high degree of binding to albumin. Fibrates are metabolised by the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. All members of this class are primarily excreted via the kidneys and display some increase in plasma half-life in individuals with severe renal impairment. The long-acting forms of gemfibrozil and bezafibrate have pharmacokinetic properties similar to those of their immediate-acting parent compounds. The long-acting form of fenofibrate, produced by the process of micronisation, has increased oral bioavailability with less variability in absorption compared with the immediate-acting form of fenofibrate. Drug interactions are seen with other drugs that share a high degree of binding to albumin or are metabolised by CYP3A4. Clinically the most important and most commonly reported drug interactions are with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (lovastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin and fluvastatin), warfarin, cyclosporin and oral hypoglycaemic agents [including metformin, tolbutamide and glibenclamide (glyburide)]. The main potential for drug interactions is with drugs or compounds that are metabolised by or affect CYP3A4, including imidazoles, grapefruit juice, erythromycin, mibefradil and others.",

Investigators enrolled 534 hypercholesterolemic patients (low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol > or = 160 mg/dl [4.2 mmol/L] and triglycerides < or = 400 mg/dl [4.5 mmol/L]). The efficacy end points were mean percent change in plasma LDL cholesterol (primary), total cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations from baseline to the end of treatment (week 8). Atorvastatin 10, 20, and 40 mg produced greater (p < or = 0.01) reductions in LDL cholesterol, -38%, -46%, and -51%, respectively, than the milligram equivalent doses of simvastatin, pravastatin, lovastatin, and fluvastatin. Atorvastatin 10 mg produced LDL cholesterol reductions comparable to or greater than (p < or = 0.02) simvastatin 10, 20, and 40 mg, pravastatin 10, 20, and 40 mg, lovastatin 20 and 40 mg, and fluvastatin 20 and 40 mg. Atorvastatin 10, 20, and 40 mg produced greater (p < or = 0.01) reductions in total cholesterol than the milligram equivalent doses of simvastatin, pravastatin, lovastatin, and fluvastatin.

Within 1 to 4 days of hospitalization for one of these conditions, 2,100 patients will be randomly assigned to receive atorvastatin, 80 mg/day, or placebo in a double-blind design. Both groups receive dietary counseling. Over a 16-week follow-up period, the primary outcome measure is the time to occurrence of an ischemic event, defined as death, nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest with resuscitation, or recurrent symptomatic myocardial ischemia requiring emergency rehospitalization. Secondary outcome measures are the time to occurrence and incidence of each of the primary outcome components, as well as nonfatal stroke, worsening angina, congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization, and need for coronary revascularization not anticipated before randomization. The sample size of 1,050 patients in each group is expected to provide 95% power to detect a 30% reduction in the primary outcome measure with a 5% level of significance.

    "110": "The subcritical fluid extraction of lovastatin from tablet powder mixtures prepared in this laboratory and MEVACOR tablets is successfully demonstrated. Methanol modifier percentage, additive type (acidic, basic, or neutral), and additive concentration on the extraction efficiency are examined. The extraction recoveries of lovastatin from MEVACOR tablets are shown to be highly dependent on methanol concentration and additive type. Isopropylamine is shown to be the most successful additive investigated. An optimized extraction method is developed, and lovastatin recoveries of 99.5% were achieved with a relative standard deviation of 1.2% from MEVACOR tablets with 15% (v/v) (1.0% [v/v] isopropylamine) methanol-modified CO2.", 
    "111": "The peroxisome proliferator ciprofibrate induces hypergastrinemia without inhibiting acid secretion. The present study was carried out to assess the effect of ciprofibrate on serum gastrin and gastrin (G) cells in different strains of rats and to compare the effect of ciprofibrate with other lipid-reducing agents (lovastatin and simvastatin) which have a different mechanism of action. Serum gastrin was determined by a radioimmunoassay method, G cell density by histomorphometry after immunostaining for G cells, and gastrin, somatostatin and histidine decarboxylase (HDC) mRNA abundance by Northern blot analysis. Ciprofibrate (100 mg/kg/day for three weeks) induced a marked hypergastrinemia (P < 0.01) in male and female Fischer rats as well as in female Wistar rats. Simvastatin and lovastatin did not affect serum gastrin. Antral G cell density increased significantly in female Wistar rats (P < 0.05) and non-significantly in the other rats after ciprofibrate. Both gastrin and somatostatin mRNA abundance in antral mucosa increased markedly and significantly (P < 0.01) after ciprofibrate treatment. The present study shows that the peroxisome proliferator ciprofibrate induces hypergastrinemia secondary to an increased storage and synthesis of antral gastrin. Since somatostatin mRNA abundance also increased, the present study suggests that ciprofibrate and possibly other peroxisome proliferators in sufficient concentrations have a stimulatory effect on endocrine cells.", 
    "112": "The effects of treatment with low-dose 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor pravastatin on the changes of chemical composition and in vitro oxidative susceptibility of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were studied in 20 type Ila hyperlipidemic patients with a plasma total cholesterol level > 240 mg/dL at the end of a diet control period for 3 months using the American Heart Association recommended step I diet. Treatment with pravastatin in a dose of 5 mg twice daily for 4 weeks resulted in lowering plasma total and LDL cholesterol levels by 17.0% and 22.9%, respectively. There was no further decline in plasma lipid thereafter. Chemical composition analysis showed that LDL particles did not contain significantly less cholesterol and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) until the end of 8 weeks (130.6 +/- 17.8 vs. 106.6 +/- 37.1 mg/mg protein, P < 0.05 and 0.16 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.08 +/- 0.02 nmol/mg protein, P < 0.005, respectively). Vitamin E, phospholipid, and triglyceride contents remained at the same levels throughout the study. In terms of oxidative kinetics, lag time and time to maximal diene concentration were not prolonged during the treatment period for 12 weeks, while total diene concentration and reaction rate were not significantly reduced until 8 weeks of treatment. Plasma enzyme activity of glutathione reductase and peroxidase, as well as the whole blood level of reduced and oxidized glutathione, remained similar during the study. In conclusion, pravastatin, at the low dose of 5 mg twice daily, produced a significant decline in plasma lipid levels to a steady-state range by 4 weeks; however, 8-weeks treatment is necessary to reduce the cholesterol and TBARS content, as well as to attenuate the oxidative susceptibility of LDL. These effects are not related to the antioxidant glutathione.",

The two drugs exhibited similar IC50's for inhibition of either rat or human reductase, and single oral dosing in rats showed the compounds to be nearly equipotent at inhibiting hepatic cholesterol synthesis. Treatment of rats with Simva or Atorva in the feed for four days yielded comparable inductions of hepatic reductase activity and reductase protein. For example, 0.05% Simva induced reductase activity 27.3 +/- 9.1 fold and 0.05% Atorva induced activity 26.9 +/- 4.7 fold. This adaptive response was also studied in HepG2 cells, a human hepatoblastoma line, cultured for 24 h in delipidated serum and then for an additional 24 h with Simva or Atorva. Over a broad range (10 nM-10 microM), both drugs caused similar inductions of reductase activity, reductase protein, and reductase mRNA. Under all conditions, the drugs induced similar changes in the ratio of mRNA/protein suggesting that Simva and Atorva have similar effects on both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory machinery. Moreover, reductase in cells treated with Simva or Atorva for 22 h responded similarly to subsequent challenge with 25-hydroxycholesterol. Finally, we measured the ability of the two reductase inhibitors to reduce ApoB secretion by HepG2 cells. Simva and Atorva at 0.5 microM inhibited ApoB secretion nearly identically, 38% and 42% respectively. We conclude that these two drugs induce similar adaptive responses in cells and that their actions are qualitatively and mechanistically identical. Human studies have shown that plasma is cleared of Atorva much more slowly than it is of Simva. The large pharmacokinetic difference in man, rather than some difference in mechanism, is the most likely explanation for the finding that the equipotent dose ratio for cholesterol lowering in humans of Simva to Atorva is about 2/1.", 
    "114": "The aim of this study was to determine whether 12 months of therapy with Simvastatin, an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, would dissolve gallstones. Twenty-seven subjects entered the study, all had a fasting oral cholecystogram, ultrasound examination, and fasting serum lipids prior to therapy. In addition, 22 subjects had their gallbladder ejection fraction, after CCK, determined by radionucleotide scanning. Eleven subjects had the cholesterol saturation index (CSI) of bile calculated before and at the end of 12 months of therapy. Of the 27 subjects, 26 completed 12 months of treatment with Simvastatin 20 mg daily. There was a significant fall in the total serum cholesterol (27%, P < 0.0001), LDL cholesterol (31%, P < 0.0001), triglyceride (34%, P < 0.0001) but no change in HDL after 12 months of therapy. Simvastatin treatment resulted in a 28% fall in the CSI of bile at the end of therapy (P < 0.01). The concentrations of individual bile acids did not change with therapy, and apart from a slight but significant increase in arachidonate, there were no other significant changes in the fatty acid composition of the biliary phospholipids. After 12 months of Simvastatin therapy there was a small decrease in the gallstone diameter but complete dissolution of gallstones was not achieved in any subjects. In conclusion 12 months of therapy with Simvastatin was effective in lowering the serum lipids and the CSI of bile but was not effective in dissolving gallstones.", 
    "115": "Actinomadura sp. strain 2966 can effectively convert compactin to pravastatin. The degree of conversion observed was 65% to 78% of compactin added and 65% to 88% of compactin taken up, depending on the concentration of compactin and duration of the experiment. Increasing the compactin concentration resulted in a higher final pravastatin concentration especially when compactin was added intermittently. Higher glucose concentrations had no effect on the bioconversion although uptake of compactin was inhibited. The conversion was linear over 16 hours. The system requires no induction and thus appears to be different from previously studied hydroxylases from actinomycetes.", 
    "116": "1. Lovastatin (1, 1.5, and 2 mg/kg) decreased systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and did not modify the basal values of blood pressure in normotensive rats. 2. Lovastatin decreased heart rate in a dose-dependent manner, and significant effects were observed in SHRs 180 min after lovastatin administration. 3. Lovastatin did not act as a diuretic drug at any of the doses used. 4. Lovastatin (10[-6] M-3 x 10[-4] M) depresses contractions evoked by KCl (80 mM) in isolated thoracic aorta from SHRs and WRs and had almost no relaxant effects on NA-induced (10[-5] M) contractions. 5. It is concluded that the main antihypertensive mechanism of lovastatin is due to the relaxation of rat aorta by inhibiting Ca2+ influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels.", 
    "117": "The recent development of specific competitive inhibitors of the hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase such as lovastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin and fluvastatin has provided an important new and effective approach to the treatment of hyperlipidaemia and atherosclerosis. These agents are designed to be hepatoselective because the primary site of cholesterol synthesis is the liver and peripheral inhibition of cholesterol synthesis would be more likely to cause adverse drug effects. In this review, Bettina Hamelin and Jacques Turgeon discuss how specific physico-chemical and pharmacological properties (first-pass effect or carrier-mediated uptake) confer hepatoselectivity to either lipophilic or hydrophilic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.", 
    "118": "1) Repeated administration of pravastatin significantly increased serum and liver cholesterol in rats. Hepatic LDL receptor activity was not changed and VLDL cholesterol secretion from the liver was increased. Net cholesterol synthesis in rat liver was increased after 7 days of repeated pravastatin administration. These results suggest that for rats, unlike other animals for which serum cholesterol is decreased, induced HMG-CoA reductase activity due to pravastatin treatment might overcome the inhibitory capability of pravastatin. 2) In the course of screening for squalene synthase inhibitors, novel zaragozic acids-F10863A, B, C and D-containing zaragozic acid D3 were isolated. F10863A was most potent and selectively inhibited cholesterol synthesis in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes among several cultured and isolated cells. It also showed in vivo serum cholesterol-lowering effects in hamsters and marmosets. However, the inhibition for squalene synthase proved to cause acidosis due to the accumulation of farnesol-derived dicarboxylic acids in urines. 3) A novel acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitor, designated epi-cochlioquinone A, a stereoisomer of cochlioquinone A, which has been previously reported as a nematocidal agent, was isolated from the fermentation broth of Stachybotrys bisbyi. It inhibited in vivo cholesterol absorption in rats by 50% at 75 mg/kg.", 
    "119": "The present study was conducted to investigate the inhibitory effect of F-1394, a potent and selective inhibitor of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), on incorporation of 14C-oleic acid into cholesteryl ester in cultured Caco-2 cells, a human intestinal cell line, and compare its effect to those of other ACAT inhibitors and hypolipidemic agents. The cholesterol esterification in Caco-2 cells was strongly inhibited by F-1394 in a concentration-dependent manner with the estimated IC50 value of 71 nM. In contrast, the estimated IC50 values of the other ACAT inhibitors such as YM-17E, CI-976, CL-277,082 and DL-melinamide are 121 nM, 702 nM, 21.5 microM and 20.9 microM, respectively. Simvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor, also inhibited the ACAT activity in Caco-2 cells with an IC50 value of 22.5 microM, whereas pravastatin Na, probucol and clofibrate did not affect the activity. Furthermore, F-1394 at a concentration of 100 nM inhibited the basolateral secretion of cholesteryl ester by 90% from differentiated Caco-2 cells that were cultured on a membrane filter. These results demonstrate that F-1394 strongly inhibits human intestinal ACAT activity and basolateral secretion of cholesterol from Caco-2 cells. Therefore, F-1394 may have a therapeutic potential for dietary hyperlipidemic subjects.", 
    "120": "This study examined the direct effects of pravastatin on the artery wall of atherosclerotic monkeys after dietary lipid lowering.", 
    "121": "Clinical trials suggest that hepatic hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease out of proportion to their effect on angiographically assessed lumen stenosis.", 
    "122": "Thirty-two cynomolgus monkeys were fed an atherogenic diet for 2 years (progression phase) and then fed a lipid-lowering diet either containing (n = 14) or not containing (n = 18) pravastatin in the diet for an additional 2 years (treatment phase). As designed, total plasma cholesterol and high density lipoprotein concentrations did not differ between groups at the beginning of or during the treatment phase of the experiment (p > 0.05).", 
    "123": "Quantitative angiography revealed that coronary arteries of the pravastatin-treated monkeys dilated 10 +/- 3%, whereas those from untreated control monkeys constricted -2 +/- 2% in response to acetylcholine (p < 0.05). There were no treatment effects on plaque size of coronary arteries measured at the end of the treatment phase of the study (0.110 +/- 0.048 mm2 [untreated] vs. 0.125 +/- 0.051 mm2 [pravastatin]; p > 0.05) or on the amount of reduction in plaque size in common iliac arteries during the treatment phase of the study (48 +/- 5% [untreated] vs. 45 +/- 6% [pravastatin]; p > 0.05). However, histochemical analysis of the atherosclerotic lesions indicated that the arteries from pravastatin-treated monkeys had significantly fewer macrophages in the intima and media, less calcification and less neovascularization in the intima (p < 0.05).", 
    "124": "We conclude that compared with control monkeys, the arteries of pravastatin-treated monkeys had better dilator function and plaque characteristics more consistent with plaque stability than those of monkeys not receiving pravastatin. These beneficial arterial effects of pravastatin occurred independently of plasma lipoprotein concentrations and despite similar changes in plaque size between the groups.", 
    "125": "Effects of long-term high-dose ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and simvastatin treatments on cholesterol metabolism and biliary lipid compositions were compared in patients with cholesterol gallstones. Absorption and synthesis of cholesterol, serum and biliary noncholesterol sterols and lipids were determined in 14 patients randomized to UDCA (23-25 mg/kg/d) or simvastatin (40 mg/d) for 1 year. Simvastatin reduced serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 55%, and UDCA, by 9%. Cholesterol absorption was decreased (35%) by UDCA, but nonsignificantly increased by simvastatin (P < .05 for difference of changes caused by the two drugs). Whole-body synthesis and biliary output of cholesterol were both significantly decreased only by UDCA. In addition, UDCA inconsistently increased the proportions of serum and biliary precursor sterols of cholesterol, known to reflect cholesterol synthesis, but did not affect their biliary secretions. Simvastatin, however, dramatically reduced serum and also biliary cholesterol precursor sterol proportions and their biliary secretions and increased proportions of serum and biliary plant sterols and cholestanol, known to reflect cholesterol absorption, but had no effect on their biliary secretion. Only UDCA significantly decreased the molar percentage of cholesterol, the lithogenic index, and the cholesterol/phospholipid (CH/ PL) ratio in bile, whereas both treatments inconsistently decreased the vesicular CH/PL ratio (P < .07 in both groups). It is concluded that both drugs decreased serum cholesterol and inhibited cholesterol synthesis, but had a differing influence on precursor sterols and the absorption of cholesterol. UDCA had more beneficial effects than simvastatin on the antilithogenic properties of bile.", 
    "126": "Twelve patients chronically maintained on warfarin were administered 80 mg atorvastatin for 2 weeks. Mean prothrombin times decreased slightly, but only for the first few days of the two-week treatment period. Thus atorvastatin had no consistent effect on the anticoagulant activity of warfarin and adjustment in warfarin dosing should not be necessary.", 
    "127": "Oxidative stress and dyslipidaemia are key features of diabetes mellitus and may be involved in mediating the vascular endothelial dysfunction associated with this disease. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of dietary lipid-lowering and antioxidant agents on vascular endothelial function and oxidative stress. Diabetic male Sprague-Dawley rats (i.v. streptozotocin, 45 mg/kg) were fed for 4 weeks on a standard diet or on a diet supplemented with either the lipid-lowering antioxidant probucol (1% w/w in diet) or the 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor simvastatin (0.01% w/w in diet). Responses to noradrenaline, acetylcholine, and sodium nitroprusside were assessed in small mesenteric arteries (mean internal diameter 300+/-5 microm, n = 80) mounted on a small vessel myograph. Plasma concentrations of total cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly raised in standard-fed diabetic rats and significantly reduced in probucol and simvastatin-fed diabetic rats 8-epi-prostaglandin (PG)F2alpha, an indicator of oxidative stress, was raised in liver and aorta from diabetic rats compared to controls. Probucol supplementation reduced 8-epi-PGF2alpha in aorta and liver of diabetic rats but increased 8-epi-PGF2alpha content in plasma and aorta from control animals. The abnormal relaxation to acetylcholine in arteries from the diabetic rats (pEC550 diabetic 6.763+/-0.172 vs control 7.541+/-0.175; p < 0.05) was not improved by probucol or simvastatin. These data, therefore, do not support a role for oxidative stress or dyslipidaemia in mediating the impaired ACh-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation of small mesenteric arteries from the streptozotocin-diabetic rat.", 
    "128": "A patient who had taken lovastatin for 7 years received erythromycin before dental procedures. Multiple organ toxicity developed, manifested as rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, pancreatitis, ileus, livedo reticularis, and elevated aminotransferase values, without liver injury. No previous reports have identified multiple organ injury of this magnitude. A computer literature search identified only three other reported instances of erythromycin and lovastatin interaction. Manifestations in these previous cases consisted of rhabdomyolysis in all three, as well as elevated aminotransferase values and acute renal failure in two cases. In all the cases, the clinical presentation of organ toxicity occurred after the cessation of erythromycin therapy between day 1 and day 5. Advanced age and chronic renal insufficiency were identified as potential risk factors for drug interaction. Health care professionals should be aware of the potential interaction between these two commonly prescribed drugs, which can mimic sepsis.", 
    "129": "To investigate the effects of cholesterol and cholesterol-lowering agents on cholesterol metabolism and tumor growth, 0.5% cholesterol, 2% cholestyramine, or 0.01% simvastatin was fed to hamsters with transplanted Simian virus40 transformed tumor cells. Tumor weight, tissue cholesterol and DNA concentrations, and HMG-CoA reductase activities were determined. Cholesterol or cholestyramine feeding did not affect the tumor growth, however, the tumor weight and DNA concentration were decreased and tumor HMG-CoA reductase activity was increased in the simvastatin group. In conclusion, simvastatin may inhibit the DNA synthesis and growth of the Simian virus40 transformed tumor cells possibly through the inhibition of cholesterol and isoprenoids synthesis in the hamster."
