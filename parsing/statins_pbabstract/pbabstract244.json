HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have been shown to reduce oxidative stress in the vasculature as well as albuminuria in animal models and in human studies. The glomerular filtration barrier is emerging as a critical determinant of albumin filtration. We investigated the effects of insulin resistance and rosuvastatin or placebo on the glomerular filtration barrier.",

    "2": "In the Zucker obese rats, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance index, oxidative markers (NADPH oxidase activity, reactive oxygen species, and urine isoprostane formation), podocyte foot process effacement, and albuminuria were increased as compared with Zucker lean controls, independent of increases in systolic blood pressure. Albuminuria correlated with podocyte foot process effacement (r(2) = 0.61) and insulin level (r(2) = 0.69). Rosuvastatin treatment improved albuminuria, filtration barrier indices, and oxidative stress via copper/zinc superoxide dismutase.", 
    "3": "These data indicate that hyperinsulinemia together with insulin resistance is associated with podocyte injury and albuminuria independent of the systolic blood pressure. Further, rosuvastatin modulates filtration barrier injury and albuminuria and improves oxidative stress measures via copper/zinc superoxide dismutase.", 
    "4": "For a number of years, coenzyme Q (CoQ10 in humans) was known for its key role in mitochondrial bioenergetics; later studies demonstrated its presence in other subcellular fractions and in plasma, and extensively investigated its antioxidant role. These two functions constitute the basis on which research supporting the clinical use of CoQ10 is founded. Also at the inner mitochondrial membrane level, coenzyme Q is recognized as an obligatory co-factor for the function of uncoupling proteins and a modulator of the transition pore. Furthermore, recent data reveal that CoQ10 affects expression of genes involved in human cell signalling, metabolism, and transport and some of the effects of exogenously administered CoQ10 may be due to this property. Coenzyme Q is the only lipid soluble antioxidant synthesized endogenously. In its reduced form, CoQH2, ubiquinol, inhibits protein and DNA oxidation but it is the effect on lipid peroxidation that has been most deeply studied. Ubiquinol inhibits the peroxidation of cell membrane lipids and also that of lipoprotein lipids present in the circulation. Dietary supplementation with CoQ10 results in increased levels of ubiquinol-10 within circulating lipoproteins and increased resistance of human low-density lipoproteins to the initiation of lipid peroxidation. Moreover, CoQ10 has a direct anti-atherogenic effect, which has been demonstrated in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice fed with a high-fat diet. In this model, supplementation with CoQ10 at pharmacological doses was capable of decreasing the absolute concentration of lipid hydroperoxides in atherosclerotic lesions and of minimizing the size of atherosclerotic lesions in the whole aorta. Whether these protective effects are only due to the antioxidant properties of coenzyme Q remains to be established; recent data point out that CoQ10 could have a direct effect on endothelial function. In patients with stable moderate CHF, oral CoQ10 supplementation was shown to ameliorate cardiac contractility and endothelial dysfunction. Recent data from our laboratory showed a strong correlation between endothelium bound extra cellular SOD (ecSOD) and flow-dependent endothelial-mediated dilation, a functional parameter commonly used as a biomarker of vascular function. The study also highlighted that supplementation with CoQ10 that significantly affects endothelium-bound ecSOD activity. Furthermore, we showed a significant correlation between increase in endothelial bound ecSOD activity and improvement in FMD after CoQ10 supplementation. The effect was more pronounced in patients with low basal values of ecSOD. Finally, we summarize the findings, also from our laboratory, on the implications of CoQ10 in seminal fluid integrity and sperm cell motility.", 
    "5": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with a highly atherogenic lipid profile, characterized by elevated triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and accumulation of small dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. Diverse mechanisms are responsible: uraemia, dialysis, immunosuppressive drugs and concomitant diseases exert their effect on the activity of key enzymes, transfer proteins and receptors involved in lipid metabolism. Post hoc analyses from large scale randomized controlled trials suggest a benefit of statin therapy with respect to cardiovascular and renal endpoints in patients with early CKD comparable to the effect in people without renal disease. Observational studies found a reduction in the risk of contrast media induced nephropathy and a reduction in the risk of hospitalization for sepsis in patients who had CKD and were treated with statins. In contrast, prospective, randomized, controlled statin trials in patients with diabetes on haemodialysis and in renal transplant recipients have not conclusively shown improvements in hard cardiovascular endpoints. This review will focus on lipid disturbances in renal disease, their impact on cardiovascular disease, existing endpoint studies and current treatment guidelines.", 
    "6": "New evidence about diabetic microangiopathy has enabled us to identify an integrated pathogenesis of diabetic complications, including classic metabolic pathways induced by hyperglycaemia, insulin-resistance, hyperinsulinaemia, hormonal alterations and growth factors. Oxidative stress is the most important cause of endothelial damage inducing leukocyte adhesion, altered coagulation and inflammation. Adhesion molecules are a marker of endothelial damage and a potential therapeutic target. Changes in the extracellular matrix induced by TGFbeta1 and lower levels of eparan-sulfate, increased thickness of basement membranes and loss of pericytes are early events of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy. Capillary rarefaction produced by genetic factors or by fetal undernourishment contributes to the beginning of insulin-resistance and hypertension. Psychophysical tests, electroretinogram and evoked potentials show retinal functional alterations; fundoscopy and retinal fluorescein angiography show retinal anatomic alterations. The diagnosis of diabetic neuropathy is based not only on traditional neurological examination and electroneurograms, but also on neurothesiometry for sensory testing. Medical treatment of diabetic microangiopathy is based on control of glycaemia, lipemia and blood pressure using glytazones, ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and statins. New knowledgeabout microangiopathy pathogenesis suggests potential drugs for its therapy (ruboxistaurin, AGE-inhibitors, angiopoietin-1 and anti-VEGF, etc.), not yet on sale.", 
    "7": "Statins belong to a class of drugs known to inhibit 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, and block hepatic cholesterol synthesis. Statins have been found to be highly effective in primary and secondary stroke prevention among medically managed patients with cardiovascular disease, and it appears that this benefit is largely owing to the non-cholesterol-lowering, so called pleiotropic, effects of statins. Over the past decade, agents such as beta-blockers, aspirin, or other antiplatelet medications have proven to reduce the incidence of adverse postoperative outcomes among vascular surgical patients and have rightfully assumed a place in our overall therapeutic armamentarium. There is growing evidence that statins may be especially effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and improving outcome following major vascular surgery. A recent study from Johns Hopkins Hospital demonstrated a threefold reduction in the rate of perioperative stroke (P < .05) and fivefold reduction of perioperative mortality (P < .05) among 1566 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA). This benefit was confirmed in a series of 3360 CEAs performed at multiple hospitals throughout western Canada. Statin use was independently associated with a 75% reduction (OR: 0.25; 95%CI: 0.07-0.90) in the odds of death and a 45% reduction (OR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.32-0.95) in the odds of ischemic stroke or death among patients with symptomatic carotid disease. A number of the pleiotropic effects of statin medications may be responsible for these clinical observations. Further work is necessary to better elucidate these mechanisms, as well as to determine the optimal agents, dosing, and timing of drug administration among patients undergoing carotid interventions. Nevertheless, in light of these data a strong case can be made to start patients on statin medications prior to CEA if time permits.", 
    "8": "Systemic sclerosis (SSc) has the highest case-specific mortality among the rheumatic diseases. Vascular dysfunction and structural wall abnormalities are among the earliest and fundamental alterations in SSc. Statins have a number of immunomodulating effects on vascular wall cells, which may modify the progression of vascular injury. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential efficacy of statin therapy in ameliorating endothelial dysfunction (ED) in SSc by investigating the effect of statins on some markers that reflect endothelial activation in SSc. Forty patients with SSc were randomized into two groups to receive 6 months' treatment with atorvastatin (n = 20; dose, 40 mg/day) or placebo (n = 20) as an adjuvant to existing therapy. Markers of ED including ET-1, plasma nitrate levels, and thrombomodulin (TM) were evaluated by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. Fibrinogen, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), ESR, lipid peroxide (LP), and malonylaldehyde (MDA) levels were also assessed. Brachial flow-mediated vasodilatation was assessed by ultrasonography. Patients were studied at base line and after 6 months of statin therapy. After 6 months of therapy, ET-1, ICAM-1, sE-selectin, vWF, fibrinogen, ESR, hsCRP as well as LP and MDA levels declined and NO increased significantly in the statin-treated SSc group when compared to the placebo-treated group. Endothelium-dependent vasodilatation (EDV) improved significantly in the atorvastatin-treated group. The findings of this study demonstrated statin-mediated improvements in the endothelial function of SSc patients as well as immunomodulating effects. Statins may thus prove to be an invaluable addition to the therapy of the vasculopathy of SSc.",

Other significant (p < 0.03) predictors were the first and second warfarin doses (+7% and +6%, respectively, per 1 mg), and statin use (-15.0%).

Addition of amlodipine (0.01-1 micromol/l) to the calcification medium did not affect VSMC calcification. However, atorvastatin (2-50 micromol/l) stimulated calcium deposition dose-dependently. Combining treatments stimulated calcification to a degree similar to that observed with atorvastatin alone. Both atorvastatin and amlodipine inhibited VSMC proliferation at the highest concentration used. Only atorvastatin (50 micromol/l) induced considerable apoptosis of VSMCs.",

    "28": "The ageing brain becomes increasingly less able to destroy or eject toxic amyloid (A) beta42 peptide byproducts of normal neuronal activity that consequently accumulate to induce Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, the various components of the Abeta-clearing machinery are prime targets for AD therapeutics. In this connection, there are reports that taking statins to lower circulating cholesterol to prevent cardiovascular disease can also prevent late-onset AD (LOAD) the most common form of the disease. However, it seems unlikely that statins would prevent LOAD by lowering the very long-lived brain cholesterol that is controlled independently from the very much shorter-lived circulating cholesterol. In fact, reducing the ability of the brain astrocytes to make cholesterol for their closely associated neuron clients' synaptogenesis could damage the brain rather than protect it. However, a plausible way statins might prevent LOAD is to target a main component of the clearance machinery, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), the brain's powerful Abeta-efflux driver. This is indicated by a reported ability of micromolar concentrations of lovastatin and simvastatin to strongly stimulate brain vascular endothelial cells to make this Abeta ejector. Therefore, if this holds up, taking a statin over the years would prevent the normal decline of LRP1 in the ageing brain and a LOAD-driving accumulation of Abeta.", 
    "29": "Hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with dysfunction and an independent risk factor of cardiovascular diseases. Cholestin (Monascus purpureus-fermented rice), contains a naturally-occurring statin, which has lipid-modulating and anti-inflammatory effects. We investigated the effects of Cholestin extract on the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) by homocysteine (HCY)-treated human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). Supplement of HAECs with Cholestin extract significantly suppressed cellular binding between the human monocytic cells U937 and HCY-stimulated HAECs. Quantitative PCR and immunoblot analysis showed that Cholestin extract significantly attenuated HCY-induced expression of VCAM-1 mRNA and protein, respectively. Gel shift assays showed that Cholestin treatment reduced HCY-activated transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). Furthermore, Cholestin also attenuated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in vitro and in HCY-treated HAECs. Supplement with statins including simvastatin and parastatin gave similar results as compared with Cholestin. In conclusion, Cholestin reduces HCY-stimulated endothelial adhesiveness as well as downregulating intracellular ROS formation, NF-kappaB activation, and VCAM-1 expression in HAECs, supporting the notion that the natural compound Cholestin may have potential implications in clinical atherosclerosis disease.", 
    "30": "Statin treatment improves insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. Thus this study assessed whether statin may affect the myocardial expression levels of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, receptors of adiponectin that enhance insulin sensitivity, and whether statin may improve insulin resistance in cardiomyocytes. Myocardial infarction (MI) was created by the ligation of the left coronary artery in male mice. Expression levels of mRNA and protein levels of AdipoR1 but not of AdipoR2 were significantly decreased in the remote area as well as in the healed infarcted area in the left ventricles 4 wk after MI. Oral administration of pravastatin (50 mg.kg(-1).day(-1) for 4 wk after MI) reversed the decrease in myocardial expression levels of AdipoR1 independently of changes in serum lipid profiles and insulin levels. With the use of cultured cardiomyocytes, incubation with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, a mediator of postinfarction myocardial dysfunction, inhibited AdipoR1 mRNA and protein expression levels. Coincubation of the cells with pravastatin reversed the inhibitory effects of TNF-alpha on AdipoR1 expression. In parallel, pravastatin reversed the TNF-alpha-induced decrease in globular adiponectin-induced 2-deoxy-d-[(3)H]glucose uptake in insulin-treated cultured cells. Moreover, this effect of pravastatin was inhibited by the suppression of AdipoR1 expression by small-interfering RNA specific for AdipoR1. Incubation with H(2)O(2) reduced AdipoR1 expression in cultured cardiomyocytes that were attenuated by N-acetyl-l-cysteine or pravastatin. Pravastatin suppressed TNF-alpha-induced intracellular oxidants in cultured cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, pravastatin reversed the reduction of AdipoR1 expression in postinfarction mouse myocardium and in TNF-alpha-treated cardiomyocytes partly through an antioxidative mechanism in association with improved glucose uptake.",

The records of 370 consecutive patients seen at a stroke clinic over a 4-year period were reviewed, and information regarding neurologic diagnosis, lipid profile, and use and type of cholesterol-lowering medication was abstracted. Hyperlipidemia was defined as a total cholesterol level equal to or more than 200 mg/dL. Forty-eight patients meeting specific criteria were further analyzed to monitor the effects of statins. Cholesterol testing was obtained in 324 patients (88%) and 178 (55%) were hyperlipidemic, but only 86 (48%) patients received treatment. The mean cholesterol level of the 48 patients dropped from 246.2 mg/dL to 197.1 mg/dL (P < .0001) after the initiation of statin therapy, and significant reductions were present in subgroups with pretreatment levels of 200 to 249 mg/dL and 250 to 299 mg/dL. Of the 21 patients with repeated cholesterol testing more than 6 months after the first posttreatment test, only 11 (52%) maintained a level below 200 mg/dL.

Statins may have a wide range of beneficial biological effects in addition to lipid lowering, a phenomenon commonly termed a 'pleiotropic effect'. However, the dose-dependency of these effects remains unclear. The present study evaluated whether atorvastatin, a potent statin, ameliorates the serum markers of pleiotropic effects, with a focus on dose-dependency. The pleiotropic effects of treatment with atorvastatin 5 mg/day and 10 mg/day for six months each in 15 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia were assessed in a prospective, randomized, open-label, crossover, single-centre study. Atorvastatin treatment dose-dependently decreased a serum marker of oxidative stress as well as the serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level. However, serum markers of inflammation and fibrinolysis decreased independently of dose. In conclusion, the dose-dependency of atorvastatin's pleiotropic effects differs among individual biological effects.",

    "42": "Dyslipidemia and the contributions of oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ox-LDL) are independent cardiovascular risk factors. There is growing evidence that dyslipidemia contributes not only to cardiovascular disease but also to the progressive decline of renal function in diabetic and non-diabetic kidney disease. Ox-LDL, by generating inflammation and oxidative stress, contributes to a pro-atherogenic mileu and leads to endothelial dysfunction, subsequent glomerular filtration barrier damage, and progressive renal injury. Chronic kidney disease (CKD), in turn, induces deleterious effects on lipid metabolism. Therefore, by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis and reducing ox-LDL, HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are attractive therapeutic options to preserve renal function. Current evidence demonstrates a reduction in cardiovascular risk and improved renal outcomes especially in patients with mild to moderate impairment of renal function. Evidence supports a beneficial role of statins thought to extend beyond their lipid-lowering effect, referred to as pleiotropic actions. These actions include modulatory effects on inflammation, oxidative stress and thrombosis, derived from their ability to prevent the formation of isoprenoid intermediates involved in cellular signaling, posttranslational modification of proteins and cellular function. This translates to potential reductions in the rate of decline in GFR in CKD and adverse effects of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the kidney. This review examines the role of statins for reno-protection as well as cardiovascular benefit in patients with CKD.", 
    "43": "Heme oxygenase (HO) has a central role in cellular antioxidant defences and vascular protection, and it may mediate pleiotropic actions of drugs used in cardiovascular therapy. We investigated whether long-term use of statins upregulates HO activity and increases carbon monoxide (CO) and bilirubin levels in vivo. Adult FvB mice were given atorvastatin or rosuvastatin (5 mg/kg) daily by i.p. injections for 1, 2, or 3 weeks. HO activity, tissue CO, bilirubin, and antioxidant levels, total plasma bilirubin, and carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) were measured. Fold changes in heart HO activity significantly increased after 1, 2, and 3 weeks of atorvastatin (1.24 +/- 0.06 (p < or = 0.05); 1.29 +/- 0.26 (p < or = 0.03); 1.33 +/- 0.08 (p < 0.01), respectively) and 2 and 3 weeks of rosuvastatin (1.23 +/- 0.20 (p < or = 0.03); 1.63 +/- 0.42 (p < 0.01), respectively). Heart tissue CO and COHb levels also increased after 3 weeks with atorvastatin (1.30 +/- 0.24 (p < or = 0.05); 1.92 +/- 0.17 (p < or = 0.001), respectively) and rosuvastatin (1.47 +/- 0.13 (p < or = 0.004); 1.63 +/- 0.12 (p < or = 0.001), respectively). Significant increases in heart antioxidant levels were observed after statin treatment and corroborated by heart bilirubin content elevations. Antioxidant level increases were abolished by treatment with an HO inhibitor. These findings suggest that the induction of HO and the production of its products, CO and bilirubin, may be a mechanism by which statins exert antioxidant actions and confer cardioprotection in vivo.",

In this study, we wanted to evaluate whether endoglin is expressed in normocholesterolemic and hypercholesterolemic C57BL/6J mice as well as whether it is affected by atorvastatin treatment in these mice. C57BL/6J mice were fed with chow diet or an atherogenic diet for 12 weeks after weaning. In 2 atorvastatin-treated groups, mice were fed the same diets (chow or atherogenic) as described above except atorvastatin was added at the dosage of 10 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) for the last 8 weeks before euthanasia. Biochemical analysis of blood samples revealed that administration of atherogenic diet significantly increased levels of total cholesterol, VLDL, LDL, and decreased levels of HDL. Atorvastatin treatment resulted in a significant decrease in total cholesterol and VLDL only in mice fed by atherogenic diet. Quantitative stereological analysis revealed that atorvastatin significantly decreased endothelial expression of endoglin in C57BL/6J mice fed the atherogenic diet. In conclusion, we demonstrated that endothelial expression of endoglin is upregulated by hypercholesterolemia and decreased by the hypolipidemic effect of atorvastatin in C57BL/6J mice, suggesting that endoglin expression could be involved in atherogenesis.",

While clinical efficacy for most of the compounds still has to be proven in large clinical trials, there is considerable hope that cystic fibrosis therapy will move from addressing the downstream sequelae of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator defect to a more causal approach in the near future.", 
    "48": "A number of epidemiologic studies suggest an association between plasma total cholesterol and risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Additionally, it has been suggested that treatment with statins, drugs that block cholesterol biosynthesis, lower the incidence and prevalence of AD and of vascular dementia. This review provides an overview of cholesterol transport within the central nervous system and the impact of statins on brain cholesterol metabolism in subjects with AD. Brain cholesterol is converted to 24-S-hydroxycholesterol, a reaction catalyzed by CYP46. The oxysterol traverses the blood-brain barrier and is transported to the liver by plasma lipoproteins. The levels of 24-S-hydroxy-cholesterol are a reflection of brain cholesterol turnover. Subjects with AD reportedly have high levels of the oxysterol possibly reflecting neuronal death with release of cell membrane cholesterol. We show gender dimorphism in plasma levels of 24-S-hydroxycholesterol in subjects with AD and significant reductions in plasma levels of the oxysterol during treatment with standard doses of statins (lovastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin). Polymorphisms of apolipoprotein E and CYP46 do not influence the effect of statins on plasma levels of 24-S-hydroxycholesterol. There were no untoward effects of the standard doses of statin for the duration of treatment. Statins are currently in trial to determine their effect on the course of AD.", 
    "49": "Genetic analysis has shown that the slower than normal rhythmic defecation behavior of the clk-1 mutants of Caenorhabditis elegans is the result of altered lipoprotein metabolism. We show here that this phenotype can be suppressed by drugs that affect lipoprotein metabolism, including drugs that affect HMG-CoA reductase activity, reverse cholesterol transport, or HDL levels. These pharmacological effects are highly specific, as these drugs affect defecation only in clk-1 mutants and not in the wild-type and do not affect other behaviors of the mutants. Furthermore, drugs that affect processes not directly related to lipid metabolism show no or minimal activity. Based on these findings, we carried out a compound screen that identified 190 novel molecules that are active on clk-1 mutants, 15 of which also specifically decrease the secretion of apolipoprotein B (apoB) from HepG2 hepatoma cells. The other 175 compounds are potentially active on lipid-related processes that cannot be targeted in cell culture. One compound, CHGN005, was tested and found to be active at reducing apoB secretion in intestinal Caco-2 cells as well as in HepG2 cells. This compound was also tested in a mouse model of dyslipidemia and found to decrease plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Thus, target processes for pharmacological intervention on lipoprotein synthesis, transport, and metabolism are conserved between nematodes and vertebrates, which allows the use of C. elegans for drug discovery.", 
    "50": "Cardioprotective bradykinin type-2 receptors (BK-2Rs) are downregulated in the myocardial endothelium of both human and rat failing hearts. Statins are cardioprotective drugs that reduce the level of plasma cholesterol but also exert cholesterol-independent pleiotropic effects. Here we examined the effect of lovastatin on BK-2R expression in cultured human coronary artery endothelial cells. The effect of lovastatin on the expression of BK receptors in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) was examined by real-time PCR, Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry. Lovastatin induced a time- and concentration-dependent increase in both BK-2R and BK-1R mRNA expression in the cultured HCAECs. Also, the number of functional BK-2Rs capable of inducing BK-mediated NO production and cGMP signaling was increased in the lovastatin-treated HCAECs. Mevalonate, the direct metabolite of HMG-CoA reductase, reversed the effect of lovastatin. Furthermore, lovastatin inhibited Rho activation and a selective inhibitor of Rho-associated kinases, Y-27632, induced a similar increase in BK-2R expression as lovastatin. In contrast, a specific inhibitor of COX-2, NS398, significantly inhibited the lovastatin-induced expression of BK-2Rs. Here we show for the first time that lovastatin induces the expression of BK-2Rs in cultured human coronary artery endothelial cells through a novel cholesterol-independent pleiotropic mechanism that involves RhoA kinase inhibition and COX-2 activation. Thus, reported beneficial effects of statins in cardiovascular diseases may be partly mediated by an increased expression of cardioprotective BK-2Rs in the endothelial cells of the coronary tree. Moreover, the use of COX-2 inhibitors may affect the level of endothelial BK-2Rs in a negative fashion.", 
    "51": "The fermentation products of Monascus, especially those produced by solid-state fermentation of rice, have been used as food and health remedies for over 1000 years in China. Monascus rice products (MRPs) are currently being used as health foods in the United States and many Asian countries such as Japan, Taiwan, China, Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia. Many studies have shown that Monascus spp. produce commercially viable metabolites, including food colorants, cholesterol-lowering agents, and antibiotics. The most important bioactive compound isolated from Monascus is monacolin K, which is identical to the potent cholesterol-lowering, antiatherosclerotic drug lovastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor. Several species of the genus Monascus also produce citrinin, a mycotoxin harmful to the hepatic and renal systems. Monacolin K and citrinin are polyketide fungal metabolites. The biosynthetic pathways leading to the formation of polyketides, including monacolin K and citrinin, have been elucidated in Aspergillus and Monascus. The concern for safety is, therefore, high for the development of MRPs as health foods. Other attractive applications for MRPs are likely, as supported by recent studies that indicate that MRPs contain other substances (flavonoids, polyunsaturated fats, phytosterols, pyrrolinic compounds, and others) with a wide variety of biological activities and pharmacological potentials. Their effects in lowering blood sugar and triacylglycerol while raising HDL-C are more pronounced than those of monacolin K alone. Beyond cholesterol lowering, MRP may also be an ideal candidate for the treatment of metabolic syndrome.",

    "53": "In the last years, new actions of statins have been described (pleiotropics). The statins seem to originate neuroprotector effects, such as up-regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase; creation of a fibrinolytic profile with suppression of the intravascular stability of the clot; immunomodulation by regulation of cytokines and cellular adhesion molecules; anti-oxidation by reduction of lipidic peroxidation; induction of neuroplasticity by increment of neurotrophic factors and protection of neuroexcitotoxicity, maybe by regulation of intracellular calcium or depletion of intracellular sterols. All these actions can be explained by decreament of isoprenoids synthesis.",

    "56": "A post hoc analysis of the recently completed Treating to New Targets (TNT) study assessed the predictive value of HDL cholesterol levels in 9770 patients. The primary outcome measure was the time to a first major cardiovascular event, defined as death from coronary heart disease, nonfatal non-procedure-related myocardial infarction, resuscitation after cardiac arrest, or fatal or nonfatal stroke. The predictive relationship between HDL cholesterol levels at the third month of treatment with statins and the time to the first major cardiovascular event was assessed in univariate and multivariate analyses and was also assessed for specific LDL cholesterol strata, including subjects with LDL cholesterol levels below 70 mg per deciliter (1.8 mmol per liter).", 
    "57": "The HDL cholesterol level in patients receiving statins was predictive of major cardiovascular events across the TNT study cohort, both when HDL cholesterol was considered as a continuous variable and when subjects were stratified according to quintiles of HDL cholesterol level. When the analysis was stratified according to LDL cholesterol level in patients receiving statins, the relationship between HDL cholesterol level and major cardiovascular events was of borderline significance (P=0.05). Even among study subjects with LDL cholesterol levels below 70 mg per deciliter, those in the highest quintile of HDL cholesterol level were at less risk for major cardiovascular events than those in the lowest quintile (P=0.03).",

    "59": "The emerging recognition that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex disorder, characterized not only by local pulmonary inflammation, but also by systemic inflammation that might have an adverse impact on various extrapulmonary organs, such as the blood vessels and the heart, among others, emphasizes the need for new and more effective forms of therapy for this debilitating disorder. Fortunately, many of the 'standard' therapeutic options used to treat COPD have the potential to influence systemic inflammation. Moreover, several new therapeutic strategies aimed at controlling the underlying inflammatory processes of COPD more specifically are under development. Unfortunately, we still do not know whether treatment of lung inflammation decreases, for example, the risk of acute cardiac events, progression of atherosclerosis or thrombotic events. It is also unclear whether, alternatively, treatment of heart disease can affect the progression of lung disease. Nonetheless, initial data seem to indicate that drugs, such as statins, ACE inhibitors, AT1 receptor blockers and PPAR agonists, used to treat a co-morbid condition have the potential to benefit COPD patients.", 
    "60": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, statins, are widely prescribed to lower cholesterol. High doses of orally administered simvastatin has previously been shown to improve fracture healing in a mouse femur fracture model. In this study, simvastatin was administered either subcutaneously or directly to the fracture area, with the goal of stimulating fracture repair at acceptable doses.", 
    "61": "Femur fractures were produced in 70 mature male Balb-C mice and stabilized with marrow-nailing. Three experiments were performed. Firstly, 20 mice received subcutaneous injections of either simvastatin (20 mg) or vehicle. Secondly, 30 mice were divided into three groups of 10 mice receiving continuous subcutaneous delivery of the vehicle substance, the vehicle with 5 mg or with 10 mg of simvastatin per kg bodyweight per day. Finally, in 20 mice, a silicone tube was led from an osmotic mini-pump to the fracture area. In this way, 10 mice received an approximate local dose of simvastatin of 0.1 mg per kg per day for the duration of the experiment and 10 mice received the vehicle compound. All treatments lasted until the end of the experiment. Bilateral femurs were harvested 14 days post-operative. Biomechanical tests were performed by way of three-point bending.

Cholesterol metabolism is significantly altered in both obesity and metabolic syndrome in that cholesterol synthesis is increased and absorption reduced and this has important implications for the treatment of lipid disorders in both obesity and the metabolic syndrome. In the present review we discuss these changes in detail especially in the context of a more standardized approach for cholesterol reduction like the TARGET LDL trial. Customized care is topical in lipidology as we strive to achieve LDL cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol targets in every patient.", 
    "65": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are sentinels of innate immunity that recognize pathogenic molecules and trigger inflammatory response. Because inflammatory mediators are detrimental to the host, the TLR response is regulated by feedback inhibition. Statins, the inhibitors of isoprenoid biosynthesis, have been shown to be potent modulators of TLR activity, and this modulation may provide insight regarding mechanisms of the feedback inhibition. In the present study, we examined feedback mechanisms that regulate TLR4 activity in astrocytes using statins to perturb postligational signaling. Astrocytic cultures established from newborn rat brains were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the ligand for TLR4. The up-regulation of expression of genes encoding interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) was determined by real-time RT-PCR. Pretreatment of the cells with either atorvastatin or simvastatin enhanced the LPS-induced up-regulation of cytokine gene expression. The most profound enhancement of approximately 17-fold was observed for the Il-6 gene. The enhancements for the Tnfa and Il-1b genes were approximately 5- and 3.5-fold, respectively. Mevalonate fully reversed the effects of statins, indicating that these drugs act through the inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis. The inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation, but not protein farnesylation, mimicked the effects of statins, strongly indicating that the enhancement is mediated by the Rho proteins. In support of this notion, pretreatment of cells with toxin B, a specific inhibitor of the Rho proteins, also enhanced LPS-triggered up-regulation of the cytokine genes. These results indicate that the Rho proteins are involved in the activation of negative feedback inhibition of TLR4 signaling in astrocytes.", 
    "66": "The prevention of type 2 diabetes and of cardiovascular diseases is a major public health objective. Obviously life-style changes play a major role in this strategy. The Finnish Prevention Study recently demonstrated that the remarkable diabetes prevention observed after a 4-year lifestyle intervention is maintained after a further 3-year period of follow-up without prolongation of the active intervention. Such a reminiscent effect may also be observed in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases with various pharmacological interventions: an ACE inhibitor (HOPE), a statin (4S), a fibrate (Helsinki Heart Study) or an intensive insulin therapy in type I diabetic patients (DCCT-EDIC). These intriguing results argue for a long-term memory of previous therapeutic interventions in cardiovascular prevention.",

    "68": "Rabbits underwent 30 min of coronary occlusion followed by 48 h of reperfusion. Pravastatin (1 or 5 mg/kg) or saline was intravenously administered 10 min before ischemia. Pravastatin (5 mg/kg) was also administered 10 min before reperfusion. N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME, 10 mg/kg), chelerythrine (5 mg/kg) or 5-hydroxydecanoic acid sodium salt (5-HD, 5 mg/kg) was intravenously administered 10 min before pravastatin injection. The infarct size was determined. The myocardial interstitial levels of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) and nitrogen oxide (NOx), and the intensity of myocardial dihydroethidium staining were measured. Pre-ischemic treatment with pravastatin reduced the infarct size (34+/-5% and 24+/-4%, 1 and 5 mg/kg, respectively), but not pre-reperfusion treatment (42.1+/-3.7%), compared with the control (45+/-3%). This effect was blocked by L-NAME (42.6+/-4%), chelerythrine (50.9+/-3%) and 5-HD (52.7+/-2%). Pre-ischemic treatment with pravastatin increased myocardial NOx levels, and attenuated both the 2,5-DHBA level and the intensity of dihydroethidium staining during reperfusion. Chelerythrine abolished the increase in NOx levels by pravastatin.",

The study included 3059 MI patients in phase 1 and an additional 611 diabetic patients in phase 2. Altogether, 53% of the patients had a final diagnosis of Q wave MI and 47% had non Q wave MI. Patients with Q wave MI were more likely to be men, younger, more frequently with a family history or a history of smoking. Patients with non Q wave MI had worst baseline demographic and clinical characteristics mainly explained by their older age. Time from symptom onset to hospital admission was less than three hours for 22% of the patients with Q wave MI and for 14% of the non Q wave MI patients. Among patients with Q wave MI, 64% received reperfusion therapy, 35% with primary percutaneous coronary interventions, 19% with pre-hospital thrombolysis and 10% with in-hospital thrombolysis. Over 70% of patients received statin therapy during the hospital stay and over 90% anti platelet agents. In-hospital mortality was 5.8% in patients with Q wave MI and 4.9% in patients with non Q Wave MI. At discharge beta-adrenergic blockers and statins and, to a lesser extent, medications of the renin angiotensin system were commonly prescribed. Over 90% received antiplatelet agents.",

In the allogeneic transplantation model, donor treatment with atorvastatin reduced renal inflammation in grafts harvested after 5 days, but no improvement of long-term graft survival (24 weeks) could be observed. A genome wide gene expression profile of donor kidneys from atorvastatin treated or vehicle treated rats revealed a fivefold downregulation of aldose reductase in all atorvastatin treated animals (P<0.01). Donor treatment with an aldose-reductase inhibitor improved kidney function and reduced renal inflammation after prolonged cold storage and isogeneic transplantation.",

    "80": "CRP is a marker of coronary heart disease and other disease states. Its release from the liver activates endothelial dysfunction and contributes to atherothrombosis. In healthy persons, CRP was found to be an independent risk marker for cardiovascular disease when compared with low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. In 2003, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Heart Association published a statement regarding CRP's use in clinical practice and public health. In a primary prevention study, statins were shown to reduce CRP, and patients with a low concentration of LDL cholesterol and high CRP may benefit from statin therapy. The results of a secondary prevention study confirmed that CRP reduction was not related to the lipid-lowering effects of the statins and that pravastatin reduced coronary events regardless of inflammation status designated by the CRP value. Another study demonstrated that intensive pharmacotherapy was more effective than moderate therapy in reducing CRP, but it found no difference in clinical outcomes among statin regimens once the goal CRP value was attained. In atheroma ultrasound studies, a reduced CRP level was related to reductions in atheroma volume regardless of the statin regimen used.", 
    "81": "The correct use of CRP in pharmacotherapeutic monitoring of statins has not been fully elucidated. Until more data regarding CRP and statin use are available, pharmacists must continue to focus on risk factors other than CRP, such as cholesterol levels, medical history, social history, and lifestyle characteristics, when making clinical decisions regarding statin therapy.", 
    "82": "The receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) is overexpressed at sites of vascular pathology. A soluble RAGE isoform (sRAGE) neutralizes the ligand-mediated damage by acting as a decoy. We hypothesized that in hypercholesterolemia up-regulation of the ligand-RAGE axis may bridge impairment of nitric oxide biosynthesis with oxidative stress. We measured in 60 hypercholesterolemic patients and 20 controls plasma total sRAGE levels, urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin (PG) F(2alpha) excretion, and plasma levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). The effects of two structurally different statins (pravastatin and atorvastatin) on these parameters were analyzed in 20 hypercholesterolemic subjects free of vascular disease. Plasma sRAGE was significantly lower, ADMA and urinary 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) were higher, in hypercholesterolemic versus normocholesterolemic patients. Patients on statin treatment with previous myocardial infarction had lower 8-iso-PGF(2alpha), higher sRAGE, and unchanged ADMA levels compared to subjects free of vascular disease. On multivariate regression analysis only 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) and ADMA predicted sRAGE levels. An 8-week treatment with either statin was associated with a significant reduction in urinary 8-iso-PGF(2alpha), whereas only atorvastatin raised sRAGE levels near to normal values, with no change in ADMA levels. sRAGE might serve as an endogenous protecting factor for accelerated atherosclerosis mediated by oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in hypercholesterolemia.",

    "86": "The variation in CK activity within the population is wider than previously suggested in smaller, nonrandom samples, and relatively high values occur frequently in all subgroups studied after rest. Therefore, we infer that upward adjustment of the upper reference limit is necessary for all population subgroups studied. The use of appropriately established reference intervals may improve the use of statins and particularly benefit the control of dyslipidemia in those with relatively high baseline CK activity.", 
    "87": "The use of statins as therapy for heart failure remains controversial. Nevertheless, many of the pleiotropic effects of statins are potentially applicable in heart failure. Although early statin trials excluded patients with heart failure because of concerns that lowering serum cholesterol could worsen an already poor prognosis, statin treatment has not been shown to have adverse effects on either cardiovascular events or mortality, and recent experimental and clinical studies have shown promise of benefit. Two large, ongoing trials should provide definitive evidence of the value of statin therapy for patients with heart failure. Pending those results, it is reasonable to follow current National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines in this high-risk population.",

However, very few studies, to date, have systematically examined the level of drug apparent solubility in o/w microemulsion formed by self-microemulsifying. In this study, a mixture experimental design was used to simulate the influence of the compositions on simvastatin apparent solubility quantitatively through an empirical model. The reduced cubic polynomial equation successfully modeled the evolution of simvastatin apparent solubility. The results were presented using an analysis of response surface showing a scale of possible simvastatin apparent solubility between 0.0024 ~ 29.0 mg/mL. Moreover, this technique showed that simvastatin apparent solubility was mainly influenced by microemulsion concentration and, suggested that the drug would precipitate in the gastrointestinal tract due to dilution by gastrointestinal fluids. Furthermore, the model would help us design the formulation to maximize the drug apparent solubility and avoid precipitation of the drug.",

On the basis of current lipid guidelines, the majority of renal transplant recipients should have plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels <100 mg/dL. Even with statin (HMG-CoA [3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA] reductase inhibitor) therapy, a significant number of renal transplant recipients have LDL-C levels >100 mg/dL. We report that ezetimibe, a novel inhibitor of intestinal cholesterol absorption, was well tolerated and effectively reduced the LDL-C level to <100 mg/dL in our cohort of renal transplant recipients with persistently elevated LDL-C levels during treatment with maximally tolerated statin medications.", 
    "95": "We assessed whether pravastatin attenuates cardiac sympathetic reinnervation after myocardial infarction through the activation of ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channels. Epidemiological studies have shown that men treated with statins appear to have a lower incidence of sudden death than men without statins. However, the specific factor for this has remained disappointingly elusive. Twenty-four hours after ligation of the anterior descending artery, male Wistar rats were randomized to groups treated with either vehicle, nicorandil (a specific mitochondrial K(ATP) channel agonist), pinacidil (a nonspecific K(ATP) channel agonist), pravastatin, glibenclamide (a K(ATP) channel blocker), or a combination of nicorandil and glibenclamide, pinacidil and glibenclamide, or pravastatin and glibenclamide for 4 wk. Myocardial norepinephrine levels revealed a significant elevation in vehicle-treated rats at the remote zone compared with sham-operated rats (2.54 +/- 0.17 vs. 1.26 +/- 0.36 mug/g protein, P < 0.0001), consistent with excessive sympathetic reinnervation after infarction. Immunohistochemical analysis for tyrosine hydroxylase, growth-associated factor 43, and neurofilament also confirmed the change of myocardial norepinephrine. This was paralleled by a significant upregulation of tyrosine hydroxylase protein expression and mRNA in vehicle-treated rats, which was reduced after the administration of either nicorandil, pinacidil, or pravastatin. Arrhythmic scores during programmed stimulation in vehicle-treated rats were significantly higher than those treated with pravastatin. In contrast, the beneficial effects of pravastatin were reversed by the addition of glibenclamide, implicating K(ATP) channels as the relevant target. The sympathetic reinnervation after infarction is modulated by the activation of K(ATP) channels. Chronic use of pravastatin after infarction, resulting in attenuated sympathetic reinnervation by the activation of K(ATP) channels, may modify the arrhythomogenic response to programmed electrical stimulation.",

In the 3CPO study, non-invasive ventilation produced a more rapid resolution of symptoms in patients hospitalised with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema; but had no effect on survival, compared to standard oxygen therapy. The ALOFT study showed that the selective oral renin inhibitor aliskiren reduces plasma BNP levels and is well tolerated in patients with heart failure receiving ACE inhibitors or ARBs, although the study was not powered to show clinical benefit. In the PROSPECT study, no echocardiographic measure of mechanical dyssynchrony was identified that was useful for identifying patients more or less likely to respond to CRT. Low dose atorvastatin reduced the incidence of sudden cardiac death in a small placebo controlled study of patients with advanced chronic heart failure.",

Statins are effective drugs to treat dyslipidemia in HT recipients, but control is suboptimal in some patients. Ezetimibe acts through inhibition of the enterohepatic recirculation, a mechanism different from but complementary to statins. Our objective was to assess the effect of the addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy among a population of HT patients.",

Statin therapy, used for cholesterol reduction, has shown a renoprotective effect in animal models, particularly in cases of proteinuria. This may occur through lipid-independent mechanisms, such as improved endothelial dysfunction/vascular biology, reduced inflammatory cytokine production (transforming growth factor-beta 1 [TGF-beta1]), and regulation of fibrogenic responses. We studied mechanisms of action of agents, such as statins, to change proteinuria, inflammatory parameters, and TGF-beta1 plasma levels in relation to vascular tone.",

    "112": "Atherosclerosis is a chronic disease triggered by lipid disturbances, endothelial injury and sustained by inflammation. Dendritic cells (DCs) are critical for the cell-mediated arm of an immune response and are known to initiate inflammatory immunity. We investigated the role of statins and the mevalonate pathway on DC invasion. DC incubation with atorvastatin (ATV; 0.05-1 microM) for 24h decreased DC adhesion capacity. DC invasion (adhesion/transmigration) was decreased after exposing DCs to low and moderate concentrations of statins, which was reversible by mevalonate (but not geranyl- or farnesyl-pyrophosphate) and cholesterol. Inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (with wortmannin) and inhibition of the NO-synthase (with asymmetric dimethyl ADMA) partially reversed statin-mediated effects. High-dose statins markedly decreased DC invasion, which was reversible by adding geranyl pyrophosphate and cholesterol. Inhibition of geranylgeranyltransferase but not inhibition of farnesyltransferase significantly decreased DC invasion. Statin-mediated alteration in DC-cholesterol synthesis and subsequent activation of the Akt/NOS pathway accounts for the statin-induced decrease in DC invasion at low-moderate concentrations (0.05-0.5 microM). Additionally, at high statin concentrations (1 microM) DC invasion is reduced by inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation. As DCs control immunity, regulating DC/endothelial cell interaction by statins may have relevance to inflammation and atherogenesis.",

Degenerative aortic valve disease (DAVD) has become the most common cause of valvular heart disease in the Western world, causing significant morbidity and mortality. No longer considered a benign consequence of aging, valve calcification is the result of an active process that, much like atherosclerotic vascular disease, is preceded by basement membrane disruption, inflammatory cell infiltration, and lipid deposition and is associated with diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and tobacco use. These realizations, in addition to pathological insights gained from emerging imaging modalities, have lead to the exploration of a variety of therapeutic interventions to delay or prevent the progression of DAVD. Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and matrix metalloproteinase have all been studied as potential disease modifiers. Moreover, tissue engineering, aided by emerging stem cell technology, holds immense potential for the treatment of valvular heart disease as adjuncts to surgical interventions. Here we review the epidemiology and pathophysiology of DAVD, in addition to highlighting emerging therapeutic interventions for this growing problem.",

To increase the monacolin K-producing activity of the strain, spore suspensions of the strain were subjected to gamma-irradiation. One thousand mutants were generated via gamma-irradiation and screened using bioassay and high performance liquid chromatography analysis. Several mutants with higher productivities of monacolin K than that of the parent strain were primarily selected. Mutant KU609 was finally selected because of its characteristics of high monacolin K production and non-citrinin-producing activity under our test conditions. Response surface methodology was used to analyze the effect of culture medium on the production of monacolin K in mixed solid-state cultures. The optimal values of nutritional ingredients for the maximal production were soytone, glucose, MgSO4, and barley at concentrations of 0.5 g, 0.48 g, 0.053 g, and 9 g, respectively. The final monacolin K production of Monascus KU609 was increased almost 100-fold compared to that of the parent strain.",

We also investigated possible associations between the foregoing parameters and cardiovascular comorbidity, peritoneal transport rate, statin and antihypertensive treatments, and ultrafiltration volume. Our study enrolled 24 patients (17 men, 7 women; mean age: 56 +/- 12 years) who had started PD at our hospital between 1998 and 2004. Patients who had been hospitalized or had had peritonitis before the study were excluded. Nutrition status, inflammation, anemia, RRF and dialysis adequacy were assessed after 1-2 months. We found that RRF was positively correlated with normalized protein equivalent of nitrogen appearance (nPNA: r = 0. 52, p = 0. 03) and negatively correlated with C-reactive protein (CRP: r = -0.47, p < 0.01) and peritoneal ultrafiltration (r = -0.42, p < 0.05). Only the nPNA and CRP correlations remained statistically significant on multivariate logistic regression analysis (CRP: r = 0.8, p = 0.011; nPNA: p = 0.013). Moreover, as compared with patients without inflammation, patients with inflammation had significantly lower hemoglobin (Hgb) levels (11.8 +/- 1.1 g/dL vs. 13.2 +/- 1.2 g/dL, p < 0.02), serum prealbumin levels (27.3 +/- 8 mg/dL vs. 36.6 +/- 9 mg/dL, p < 0.05), and serum transferrin levels (168 +/- 34 mg/dL vs. 202 +/- 31 mg/dL, p < 0.05), and a higher erythropoietin resistance index (ERI: 10 +/- 4 vs. 6 +/- 3.5, p < 0. 02). We observed no differences in RRF or nutrition status between the patients with high and with low peritoneal transport. Regarding comorbidity, patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease had higher CRP levels (0.8 +/- 0.4 mg/dL vs. 0.4 +/- 0.4 mg/dL, p < 0.05) and lower mean Hgb levels (13.3 +/- 1 g/dL vs. 14.4 +/- 1 g/dL, p < 0.05) than did patients without such pre-existing disease. A strong, predictable association exists between RRF and inflammation and nutrition status in incident patients on PD. Serum CRP is a good indicator of inflammation, which correlates well with nutrition status, anemia, and responsiveness to erythropoietin therapy.",

    "122": "Stenotic aortic valves are characterized by atherosclerosis-like lesions, consisting of activated inflammatory cells, including T lymphocytes, macrophages, and mast cells, and of lipid deposits, calcific nodules, and bone tissue. Active mediators of calcification and cells with osteoblast-like activity are present in diseased valves. Extracellular matrix remodeling, including collagen synthesis and elastin degradation by matrix metalloproteinases and cathepsins, contributes to leaflet stiffening. In experimental animals, hypercholesterolemia induces calcification and bone formation in aortic valves, which can be inhibited by statin treatment. The potential of statins to retard progression of aortic valve stenosis has also been recognized in clinical studies; however, further prospective trials are needed. Angiotensin II-forming enzymes are upregulated in stenotic valves. Angiotensin II may participate in profibrotic progression of aortic valve stenosis and may serve as a possible therapeutic target.", 
    "123": "Recent findings regarding the interaction of inflammatory cells, lipids, mediators of calcification, and renin-angiotensin system in stenotic valves support the current opinion of aortic valve stenosis being an actively regulated disease, potentially amenable to targeted molecular therapy. Evidence from prospective clinical studies is eagerly awaited.",

A CRP value of >5 mg/L was considered to be elevated. The frequency of stroke and death within 30 days was compared between patients with and without elevated baseline CRP levels using chi(2) and multivariate logistic regression analysis.",

The 30-day stroke and death rate was significantly higher in patients with elevated CRP values (8/36; 22.2%) than in those without (3/94; 3.2%; P < .01). After adjusting for demographic characteristics, degree of carotid stenosis, and use of cerebral protection devices and/or statin therapy, an elevated CRP value before CAS remained a significant and independent predictor of stroke and death within 30 days after CAS (odds ratio, 7.7; 95% confidence interval: 1.8-32.8, P = .006).",

Little is known about the temporal trends and racial differences in such use after discharge. This study assessed temporal trends and racial differences in the use of statins, BBs, and ACEIs or ARBs after MI discharge in community-dwelling seniors. Administrative data from pharmacy assistance programs and Medicare in 2 states (1995 to 2004) were used to identify all patients hospitalized for MI who survived > or =90 days after discharge. Age, gender, race, co-morbidities, and MI-specific procedures during hospitalization were assessed. The study outcomes were filled prescriptions for any statin, BB, or ACEI or ARB <90 days after discharge. Multivariate regression was used for trend and racial difference analyses. Of 19,368 patients identified, 6,577 (34.0%) filled prescriptions for statins, 12,387 (64.0%) for BBs, and 9,934 (51.3%) for ACEIs or ARBs <90 days after MI discharge. The use of these drugs increased from 1995 to 2004, most steeply for statins (11% to 61%), less so for BBs (47% to 80%), and least for ACEIs or ARBs (46% to 58%) (all p for trend <0.001). Black patients were 14% and 5% less likely to receive statins and BBs, respectively (all p <0.05). No evidence of an interaction between race and time trend was found. In conclusion, the use of cardiovascular medications after discharge from MI hospitalization in older patients may still be inadequate but has increased over time. The underuse of statins and BBs was marked in black patients and did not improve over time.", 
    "129": "Compared with moderate lipid lowering with standard-dose statin therapy, intensive lipid lowering with high-dose statin therapy after acute coronary syndromes (ACS) significantly reduces cardiovascular events. However, the 2 trials of high-dose versus standard-dose statin therapy in patients with ACS, Aggrastat to Zocor (A to Z) and Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 22 (PROVE-IT-TIMI 22), were not individually powered to evaluate the impact on mortality alone. In this study, a pooled, patient-level analysis of these trials of 8,658 post-ACS patients was performed to provide a more robust estimate of the impact of intensive statin therapy on mortality. By 8 months, achieved low-density lipoprotein levels were lower in the group with intensive statin therapy (median 64 mg/dl, interquartile range 51 to 81) than in the group with moderate statin therapy (median 87 mg/dl, interquartile range 71 to 107) (p <0.001). All-cause mortality was significantly reduced in the group with intensive statin therapy compared with the group with moderate statin therapy (3.6% vs 4.9%, hazard ratio 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.63 to 0.95, p = 0.015), without significant interaction by trial (interaction p = 0.63). The reduction in all-cause mortality with intensive statin therapy was consistent across key subgroups. In conclusion, in this analysis of >8,600 patients, intensive lipid lowering with high-dose statin therapy after ACS was associated with reduced mortality compared with moderate lipid lowering with standard-dose statin therapy. On the basis of these findings, 1 death was prevented for every 95 patients treated with high-dose statin therapy for 2 years. The results of this pooled analysis provide further evidence for early intensive statin therapy after ACS.",

Clinical trials have confirmed that statin decreases the incidence of major coronary and cerebrovascular events and this may be due to its hypolipidemic and antiinflammatory effects. Since a good Pu-erh tea needs longer storage (10 years or more) of fermentation to enhance the flavor and fragrance, we screened microorganisms from two Pu-erh teas, 20 and 25 years old. Species of fungi and bacteria strains that contributed to a good taste of Pu-erh tea were isolated. The effect of fermentation was investigated by inoculating fresh tea leaves with individual strains of isolated microorganisms. Results showed that statin, total polyphenol content, and the scavenging activities of alpha,alpha-diphenyl-beta-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals increased during fermentation. Tea leaves inoculated with Streptomyces bacillaris strain R9 had the highest polyphenol content (3.3 mg/100 g) and scavenging ability to DPPH radicals (92%). Streptomyces cinereus strain Y11 was equally good for polyphenol content but yielded the highest amount of statin (1012 ng/g) after 42 days of fermentation. Interestingly, the statin content of fresh tea leaves fermented with strain R9 or Y11 after 180 days was much higher (4- and 8-fold, respectively) than that of the 25-year-old Pu-erh tea (513 ng/g) as measured by the HPLC method. Similarly, these two strains also increased the content of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) 5.7- and 4.7-fold in tea fermented for 180 days as compared with the fresh leaves (1270 microg/g) and that were higher than that of the Pu-erh tea (4900 microg/g).

Sprague-Dawley rats infused with AngII (200 ng/kg per minute for 17 days) were concomitantly treated or not for the last 7 days with simvastatin, apocynin, tempol, and hydralazine (60, 60, 30, and 15 mg/kg per day, respectively). Only hydralazine lowered AngII hypertension. Simvastatin and apocynin lowered cardiac hypertrophy by 52% and 54% and reversed the marked rise in albuminuria by 25% and 70%. Neither tempol nor hydralazine affected cardiac mass or albuminuria. None of the treatments modified the AngII-induced increase in carotid media thickness. The rise in cardiac superoxide anion production (lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence method) induced by AngII was reversed by all treatments. Enhanced plasma concentration of advanced oxidation protein products (spectrophotometry using chloramine T) was unaffected by simvastatin and tempol, but it was reversed by apocynin and hydralazine. Our results indicate that simvastatin reverse established cardiac and renal alterations in AngII hypertension independently of arterial pressure. It is suggested that oxidative stress participates in the maintenance of target organ damage and that antioxidant properties are involved in the beneficial influence of the statin.",

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma, an important nuclear transcriptional factor, can be predominately detected in adipocytes and exert several biological properties, including antiinflammatory effects. The authors investigated the effects of 2-week atorvastatin treatment on CRP secretions by adipocytes in hypercholesterolemic rabbits. CRP concentrations in serum and adipocytes culture supernatants were measured by latex particle-enhanced immunoturbidometric method. RT-PCR was used to evaluate PPARgamma mRNA expression. Two weeks of atorvastatin treatment resulted in significant reductions of circulating CRP concentrations, which were associated with CRP secretions in adipocytes (r = 0.688, P = 0.007). Meanwhile, CRP secretions in adipocytes were intimately related to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels (r = 0.869, P < 0.001) and PPARgamma mRNA expressions in adipocytes (r = -0.857, P < 0.001). These data demonstrate that hypercholesterolemia may induce CRP secretions in adipocytes; short-term atorvastatin treatment reduces CRP secretions in adipocytes, possibly through lowering blood cholesterol levels and upregulating PPARgamma expressions in adipocytes. These findings enrich the pharmacological effects of statins and also enlighten the relationship between adipocytes and hypercholesterolemia.",

Here, we demonstrate that cholesterol treatment suppresses or attenuates TGF-beta responsiveness in all cell types studied as determined by measuring TGF-beta-induced Smad2 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, TGF-beta-induced PAI-1 expression, TGF-beta-induced luciferase reporter gene expression and TGF-beta-induced growth inhibition. Cholesterol, alone or complexed in lipoproteins (LDL, VLDL), suppresses TGF-beta responsiveness by increasing lipid raft and/or caveolae accumulation of TGF-beta receptors and facilitating rapid degradation of TGF-beta and thus suppressing TGF-beta-induced signaling. Conversely, cholesterol-lowering agents (fluvastatin and lovastatin) and cholesterol-depleting agents (beta-cyclodextrin and nystatin) enhance TGF-beta responsiveness by increasing non-lipid raft microdomain accumulation of TGF-beta receptors and facilitating TGF-beta-induced signaling. Furthermore, the effects of cholesterol on the cultured cells are also found in the aortic endothelium of ApoE-null mice fed a high-cholesterol diet. These results suggest that high cholesterol contributes to atherogenesis, at least in part, by suppressing TGF-beta responsiveness in vascular cells.", 
    "143": "Diabetes is a highly prevalent disease in the United States and is increasing in both incidence and prevalence. Atherosclerotic vascular disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance and frequently co-exists with a variety of cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, and physical inactivity. Hygienic measures such as weight loss and exercise should form the basis of therapeutic interventions in the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes. The role of dyslipidemia as a causal factor in vascular disease associated with diabetes was previously downplayed because total cholesterol was frequently normal or minimally elevated. However, diabetic dyslipidemia is characterized by elevated triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein, and small, dense low-density lipoprotein, the combination of which has been termed the \"lipid triad.\" The role of lipid modification as a means to decrease cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes has recently been clarified by a number of clinical trials. Subgroup analysis in early studies implied the potential for benefit of lipid modification in diabetes. The results of these early studies prompted the design of large-scale intervention trials in diabetes patients that employed statin and fibric acid derivatives. The preponderance of data from the statin trials implicates significant clinical benefit in cardiovascular risk reduction. The fibric acid derivatives have theoretic advantages in diabetic dyslipidemia. However, the robust bulk of clinical data obtained from prospective statin studies is lacking for the fibric acid derivatives, and the results of the major trials are equivocal.", 
    "144": "The incidence and prevalence of dementia are increasing. Dementia is a major cause of disability. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia. There are no good prevention or treatment options. Experimental animal and laboratory studies have suggested that cholesterol metabolism in the brain is important in the causal pathway for dementia, possibly by modifying amyloid metabolism. A few studies have showed a possible relationship between mid-life blood cholesterol levels and risk of dementia, including AD. Case-control studies report that patients with AD were less likely to use lipid-lowering drugs, especially statins. Longitudinal epidemiology studies have not demonstrated a decreased risk of AD among statin users versus nonusers. Two clinical trials of statin therapy to reduce cardiovascular disease have not shown any reduction in risk of cognitive decline or dementia. The results of two secondary prevention trials will be reported shortly. In spite of negative studies, the possibility remains that statin therapy may reduce risk of dementia and AD. Primary prevention trials are difficult and expensive and will likely not be done in the United States.", 
    "145": "Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) is an enzyme that belongs to the superfamily of phospholipase A2 enzymes. Although initial studies showed that Lp-PLA2 might be protective against atherosclerosis, emerging data seem to suggest that Lp-PLA2 may be proatherogenic, which is an effect thought to be mediated by lysophosphatidylcholine and oxidized nonesterified fatty acids, two mediators generated by Lp-PLA2. This article reviews the potential mechanisms by which Lp-PLA2 may participate in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and its clinical manifestations, namely, coronary artery disease and stroke.", 
    "146": "This study compared effectiveness of rosuvastatin (RSV) with other statins on lowering LDL-C and LDL-C goal attainment among Medicare-eligible patients (age >or= 65 years) and patients with age < 65 years treated in usual clinical practice to provide evidence of real-world effectiveness of statins.", 
    "147": "Retrospective cohort study was conducted in patients, newly prescribed statin therapy during August 2003 to May 2005. Patient inclusion criteria: no prior prescription for dyslipidaemic medication in the preceding 12 months, continuously enrolled for >or= 15 months and >or= 90-day supply of statin. Effectiveness of RSV in reducing LDL-C and attaining LDL-C goal when compared with other statins was evaluated using multivariate regression, adjusting for baseline LDL-C, age, gender, smoking, hypertension, coronary heart disease (CHD), systolic blood pressure and therapy duration.", 
    "148": "Adjusted per cent LDL-C reduction was significantly greater (p < 0.05) with RSV (24.3% for >or= 65 and 28.5% for < 65) compared with ATV (17.5%, 21.3%), SMV (14.8%, 18.4%), PRV (11.3%, 15.8%), FLV (10.7%, 20.6%) and LOV (13.3%, 14.4%). Among patients in both age groups at high or moderate CHD risk, a greater proportion of RSV patients attained LDL-C goal (76.0% for age group >or= 65 years and 78.4% for age group < 65 years) vs. 50.5-73.0% for >or= 65 and 51.3-71.5% for < 65 years of age on other statins (p < 0.0001).", 
    "149": "Rosuvastatin is more effective in lowering LDL-C in Medicare-eligible patients and patients < 65 years of age when compared with other statins in usual clinical practice. Moreover, RSV patients had higher LDL-C goal attainment rates when compared with other statins in high- and moderate-risk patients. The study results have implications for clinicians in selecting the optimal statin to meet individual patient care needs.", 
    "150": "Statins, or 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, have been shown to reduce elevated serum cholesterol resulting in a reduced risk of coronary artery disease and its complications. Rosuvastatin is the latest of the class of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and has the most potent reduction of low-density lipoprotein and elevation of high-density lipoprotein in the class. Questions have been raised about its safety. In a careful examination of the data, rosuvastatin has the same rate of elevations of hepatic enzymes as the other statins. Whether any of the statins actually cause significant liver injury is doubtful, and this raises questions about the usefulness of routine monitoring of liver enzymes in statin patients. Rosuvastatin has been noted to produce low levels of transient proteinuria. However, transient proteinuria is seen with other comparable statins. Long-term administration of rosuvastatin and other statins have been shown not to be associated with any decline in renal function, but instead have been shown to produce modest but clear improvement in glomerular filtration rate. Therefore, it is clear that rosuvastatin, and other statins, are very safe and useful agents and do not appear to present significant risks to hepatic or renal safety.", 
    "151": "To investigate the effects and mechanisms of atorvastatin and celecoxib administered individually or in combination on human prostate cancer PC-3 cells cultured in vitro or grown as xenograft tumors in immunodeficient mice.", 
    "152": "Human prostate cancer PC-3 cells in culture were treated with atorvastatin and celecoxib alone or in combination. Severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice were injected s.c. with PC-3 cells. The mice received daily i.p injections starting 2 days before tumor cell inoculation and continuing during the course of treatment with atorvastatin (10 microg/g body weight/d), celecoxib (10 microg/g/d), a combination of atorvastatin (10 microg/g/d) and celecoxib (10 microg/g/d), or a combination of atorvastatin (5 microg/g/d) and celecoxib (5 microg/g/d).", 
    "153": "Atorvastatin in combination with celecoxib had stronger effects on growth inhibition and apoptosis of PC-3 cells than either agent used individually. Atorvastatin and celecoxib in combination also had a stronger inhibitory effect on activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 in PC-3 cells than either agent alone. Treatment of SCID mice with combinations of atorvastatin and celecoxib more effectively inhibited the formation and growth of PC-3 tumors in the mice than either agent administered alone.", 
    "154": "A combination of atorvastatin and celecoxib had a more potent inhibitory effect on the growth of PC-3 cells cultured in vitro or grown in SCID mice than either agent alone. A combination of atorvastatin and celecoxib may be an effective strategy for the prevention of prostate cancer.", 
    "155": "Intestinal complications after radiotherapy are caused by transmural fibrosis and impair the quality of life of cancer survivors. Radiation fibrosis was considered permanent and irreversible, but recently, its dynamic nature was shown, providing new opportunities for the development of antifibrotic therapies. Among these new targets, we identified the Rho/ROCK pathway and thought to investigate whether pravastatin treatment inhibits Rho pathway activation and elicits an antifibrotic action.", 
    "156": "Rho and ROCK activities were monitored in human explants presenting radiation fibrosis remodeling after incubation with pravastatin. Subsequent modulation of CCN2, type I collagen, and fibronectin expression were assessed ex vivo and in intestinal smooth muscle cells derived from radiation enteropathy. Then, the therapeutic relevance of the antifibrotic action of pravastatin was explored in vivo in a rat model of chronic radiation fibrosis (19 Gy X-rays) treated with 30 mg/kg/d pravastatin in the drinking water.", 
    "157": "The results obtained with human explants show that pravastatin specifically inhibits Rho activity in submucosal mesenchymal cells. Pravastatin also elicits ROCK inhibition, and subsequent CCN2 production in human explants and smooth muscle cells isolated from radiation enteropathy. Inhibition of type I collagen and fibronectin does occur, showing that pravastatin modulates the secretory phenotype of mesenchymal cells. Lastly, curative pravastatin administration improves radiation enteropathy in rats. This structural improvement is associated with decreased deposition of CCN2 and subsequent decreased extracellular matrix deposition.", 
    "158": "Targeting established fibrosis with pravastatin is an efficient and safe antifibrotic strategy in radiation-induced enteropathy, and is easily transferable into the clinic.", 
    "159": "Ancient Indian physicians used the powdered tree bark of Terminalia arjuna Wight & Arn. for alleviating \"hritshool\" (angina) and other cardiovascular conditions. Its stem bark possesses glycosides, large quantities of flavonoids, tannins and minerals. Flavonoids have been detected to exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and lipid lowering effects while glycosides are cardiotonic, thus making Terminalia arjuna unique amongst currently used medicinal plants. In this review an attempt has been made to discuss various aspects of its ethnomedical, pharmacognostical, phytochemical, pharmacological and clinical relevance to cardiovascular conditions. Experimental studies have revealed its bark exerting significant inotropic and hypotensive effect, increasing coronary artery flow and protecting myocardium against ischemic damage. It has also been detected to have mild diuretic, antithrombotic, prostaglandin E(2) enhancing and hypolipidaemic activity. There is ample clinical evidence of its beneficial effect in coronary artery disease alone and along with statin. However, toxicological studies in experimental animals are lacking. Considering its anti-ischemic activity and its potential to correct dyslipidemia, reduce left ventricular mass and increase left ventricular ejection fraction, it is essential to examine the molecular mechanism of its action and its core constituents. Proposition to administer Terminalia arjuna along with statins deserves to be explored in depth for defining its place in the over all management and prevention of coronary artery disease.", 
    "160": "In human monocytes 100 ng/mL leptin increased both statin-inhibitable free radical and cholesterol production in vitro. In our recent study, we aimed to elucidate the concentration dependence of observed leptin-effect. Following leptin stimulation cholesterol synthesis was measured in the presence of inhibitors to determine affected signal pathways. Leptin at low (10-100 ng/mL) concentrations increased [(14)C]acetate incorporation, whereas at 250 ng/mL and higher concentrations it suppressed cholesterol synthesis. HMG CoA reductase, phosphatidyl-3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) were involved in mediating leptin effects at low concentrations, whereas the cholesterol synthesis suppression was abolished by inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC) and PI3K.", 
    "161": "Increased blood levels of the omega-3 fatty acids (FA) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have been inversely associated with risk for sudden cardiac death, but their relationship with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is unclear.", 
    "162": "We hypothesized that the EPA+DHA content of blood cell membranes, as a percent of total FAs, is reduced in ACS patients relative to matched controls.", 
    "163": "We measured the content of EPA+DHA in 768 ACS patients and 768 age-, sex- and race-matched controls. The association with ACS case status of blood cell EPA+DHA [both by a 1 unit change and by category (low, <4%; intermediate 4.1-7.9%; and high, > or =8%)] was assessed using multivariate conditional logistic regression models adjusting for matching variables and smoking status, alcohol use, diabetes, body mass index, serum lipids, education, family history of coronary artery disease, personal histories of myocardial infarction and hypertension, and statin, aspirin, and other antiplatelet drug use.", 
    "164": "The combined groups had a mean age of 61+/-12 years, 66% were male, and 92% were Caucasian. The EPA+DHA content was 20% lower in cases than controls (3.4+/-1.6 vs. 4.25+/-2.0%, p<0.001). The multivariable-adjusted odds for case status was 0.77 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.85, p<0.001) for a 1 unit increase in EPA+DHA content. Compared with the lowest EPA+DHA group, the odds ratio for an ACS event was 0.58 (95% CI 0.42-0.80), in the intermediate EPA+DHA group and was 0.31 (95% CI 0.14-0.67; p for trend <0.0001) in the highest EPA+DHA group.", 
    "165": "Odds for ACS case status increased incrementally as the EPA+DHA content decreased suggesting that low EPA+DHA may be associated with increased risk for ACS."
