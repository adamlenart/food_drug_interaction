First, the ability of AVA to enhance DHA efficacy by improving the survival rate for CM and also decreasing signs of CM was evaluated in a murine model of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM), which was designed in C57BL6/N mice. Second, the inflammatory biomarkers were assessed at D6 and D10 in mice treated by DHA and in untreated mice in which clinical signs of CM appear rapidly and death occurs before D12. Both experiments were designed with seven days of treatment with 40 mg/kg AVA combined with five days of 3 mg/kg DHA administered intraperitoneally.",

Serum levels of lipids, soluble CD40L, platelet factor 4, and interleukin-6 were assayed with commercial kits. The number of platelets expressing surface P-selectin, CD40, and CD40L were determined by flow cytometry. Aortas were examined for fatty streaks. In the HC group, we observed a significant increase in serum lipid levels and platelet activation markers compared with the control group. Rats in the HCS group had a significant decrease in lipid levels and downregulation in the number of platelets expressing surface P-selectin, CD40, and CD40L compared with the HC group. We observed decreased fatty streak formations in aortas in HCS rats. A positive correlation was found for platelet activation markers and atherosclerotic fatty streak formations. Regression analysis revealed that the predictor of atherosclerosis was CD40L. Our study suggests that in a rat hypercholesterolemic model, statin treatment may influence the CD40-CD40L dyad, and that this effect is parallelled by a suppression of progression of atherosclerotic plaque formation.",

The actual 5-year survival was 73%. Logistic regression yielded the following predictors of mortality: age (by decade) (odds ratio [OR] = 1.8, P < 0.0001), CAD (OR = 1.5, P = 0.0007), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 2.5; P < 0.0001), diabetes (OR = 1.7, P < 0.0001), neck radiation (OR = 2.6, P = 0.005), no statin (OR = 2.1, P < 0.0001), and creatinine more than 1.5 (OR = 2.6, P < 0.0001). These variables were then assigned a hierarchal point scoring system in accordance with the OR value. The 5-year survival based on the scoring system was as follows: 0 to 5 points = 92.5%, 6 to 8 points = 83.6%, 9 to 11 points = 63.7%, 12 to 14 points = 46.5%, and more than 15 points = 33.8%. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test validated the scoring system (P = 0.26) and there was no difference in the ROC curves (C statistic = 0.74 vs 0.73).", 
    "60": "This validated scoring system can be a useful tool for determining which patients are likely to benefit most from CEA based on the probability of long-term survival. Given that the 5-year survival of patients in the medical arm of the asymptomatic CEA trials was 60% to 70%, it is reasonable to conclude that patients who score 0 to 8 points are excellent candidates for CEA whereas most patients with \u226512 points should be managed with medical therapy alone.", 
    "61": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy is associated with increased oxidative stress and vascular endothelial dysfunction, which lead to coronary microangiopathy. We tested whether statin-induced redox imbalance improvements could ameliorate diabetic cardiomyopathy and improve coronary microvasculature in streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus (DM). Fluvastatin (10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle was orally administered for 12 weeks to rats with or without DM. Myocardial oxidative stress was assessed by NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase subunit p22(phox) and gp91(phox) mRNA expression, and myocardial 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2\u03b1) (PGF(2\u03b1)) levels. Myocardial vascular densities were assessed using anti-CD31 and anti-\u03b1-smooth muscle actin (SMA) antibodies. Fluvastatin did not affect blood pressure or plasma cholesterol, but attenuated increased left ventricular (LV) minimum pressure and ameliorated LV systolic dysfunction in DM rats in comparison with vehicle (LV dP/dt, 8.9 \u00b1 1.8 vs 5.4 \u00b1 1.0 \u00d7 10(3) mmHg/s, P < 0.05). Myocardial oxidative stress increased in DM, but fluvastatin significantly reduced p22(phox) and gp91(phox) mRNA expression and myocardial PGF(2\u03b1) levels. Fluvastatin enhanced myocardial endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein levels and increased eNOS, vascular endothelial growth factor, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 mRNA expression. CD31-positive cell densities were lower in DM rats than in non-DM rats (28.4 \u00b1 13.2 vs 48.6 \u00b1 4.3/field, P < 0.05) and fluvastatin restored the number (57.8 \u00b1 18.3/field), although there were no significant differences in SMA-positive cell densities between groups. Fluvastatin did not affect cardiac function, oxidative stress, or vessel densities in non-DM rats. These results suggest that beneficial effects of fluvastatin on diabetic cardiomyopathy might result, at least in part, from improving coronary microvasculature through reduction in myocardial oxidative stress and upregulation of angiogenic factor.", 
    "62": "Despite the clinical benefit of statin therapy and the numerous strategies used to improve adherence, no strategy has used direct communication of genetic test results to the patient as an adherence and persistence motivator. We investigated in a real-world setting the effect of a process of providing KIF6 test results and risk information directly to 647 tested patients on 6-month statin adherence (proportion of days covered (PDC)) and persistence compared with concurrent non-tested matched controls. Adjusted 6-month statin PDC was significantly greater in tested patients: 0.77 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72-0.82) vs controls 0.68 (95% CI 0.63-0.73), P<0.0001. Significantly more tested patients were adherent (PDC\u2a7e0.80) (63.4% (59.6-67.1%) vs 45.0% (41.1-48.8%), P<0.0001) and persisted on therapy (69.1% (65.4-72.5%) vs 53.3% (49.4-57.1%), P<0.0001). Similar results were observed in a secondary comparison with 779 unmatched patients who declined testing. The Additional KIF6 Risk Offers Better Adherence to Statins trial provides the first evidence that pharmacogenetic testing may modify patient adherence.", 
    "63": "Some of lipophilic statins have been reported to enhance toxicities induced by antineoplastic agents but the underling mechanism is unclear. The authors investigated the involvement of Cx43-mediated gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) in the effect of simvastatin on the cellular toxicity induced by etoposide in this study. The results showed that a major component of the cytotoxicity of therapeutic levels of etoposide is mediated by gap junctions composed of connexin 43(Cx43) and simvastatin at the dosage which does not induce cytotoxicity enhances etoposide toxicity by increasing gap junction coupling. The augmentative effect of simvastatin on GJIC was related to the inhibition of PKC-mediated Cx43 phosphorylation at ser368 and subsequent enhancement of Cx43 membrane location induced by the agent. The present study suggests the possibility that upregulation of gap junctions may be utilized to increase the efficacy of anticancer chemotherapies.",

From May 2011 to April 2013, a total of 12,440 patients were enrolled, 40.5% with acute HF and 59.5% with chronic HF. Intravenous treatments for acute HF were heterogeneously administered, irrespective of guideline recommendations. In chronic HF, with reduced EF, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers, beta-blockers, and mineralocorticoid antagonists (MRAs) were used in 92.2, 92.7, and 67.0% of patients, respectively. When reasons for non-adherence were considered, the real rate of undertreatment accounted for 3.2, 2.3, and 5.4% of the cases, respectively. About 30% of patients received the target dosage of these drugs, but a documented reason for not achieving the target dosage was reported in almost two-thirds of them. The more relevant reasons for non-implantation of a device, when clinically indicated, were related to doctor uncertainties on the indication, patient refusal, or logistical/cost issues.",

Observations regarding the real possibility to adhere fully to current guidelines in daily clinical practice should be seriously considered when clinical practice guidelines have to be written.", 
    "67": "There is compelling experimental and clinical evidence suggesting a crucial role for inflammation in the initiation and also the progression of atherosclerosis. Numerous biomarkers involved at various levels of the inflammation cascade have been shown to be associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Yet, to date, it is not clear whether inflammation simply accompanies the atherosclerotic process or represents a major driver. Among all blood biomarkers, C-reactive protein (CRP), the classical acute phase reactant that can be measured with high-sensitivity (hs) assays seems to be the most promising candidate. It has already found its way into the guidelines in primary prevention. Hs-CRP can also be used to identify a high-risk group for recurrent events in patients with manifest atherosclerosis. Several post hoc analyses of large-scale randomized clinical trials testing various statins have indicated that, besides low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, hs-CRP levels might also further aid in tailoring statin treatment. The large JUPITER trial has prospectively confirmed these findings in primary prevention in patients with elevated hs-CRP but normal LDL cholesterol levels. Still, statin therapy is not a specific anti-inflammatory regime acting on the inflammation cascade. Thus, to directly test the inflammation hypothesis, a novel, more proximally located cytokine-based approach is needed. Canakinumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against interleukin-1\u03b2, might represent a promising compound in this regard and provide a proof of concept. If successful, this may become a novel strategy to treat high-risk patients with stable atherosclerotic disease to prevent recurrent events on top of standard medical care.",

Cardiovascular events are the leading cause of death in this patient population, therefore reducing the risk of these events has become a major focus. The aim of this review is to assess current literature on the use of statins in CKD and end-stage renal disease. Cholesterol reduction is important in preventing the development and progression of coronary heart disease and its negative effects. Statins have been widely studied and proven to reduce cardiovascular risk in the general population. The information gained from trials has been extrapolated to special populations, including CKD, despite these patients often being excluded. However, recent studies have begun to focus on CKD, hemodialysis, and transplant patients and the use of cholesterol-lowering agents and the potential association with decreased cardiovascular events. In addition, due to the unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes that occur in these patients, choosing the appropriate cholesterol-lowering agent becomes important for both safety and efficacy. The complexity of CKD patients is an important consideration when choosing cholesterol-lowering medication. Patients with CKD are often on medications that may interact with many of the cholesterol-lowering agents. Ensuring drug interactions are minimized is essential to the prevention of adverse events from the medications.",

Recently, we reported that statins might have a potential benefit for TNBCs associated with ets-1 overexpression. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of PTEN loss in the effects of statin on TNBC cells. In addition, we analyze the relationship between AKT downstream pathways and the effects of statin on TNBC cells. We investigated the effect of a statin on TNBC cells and analyzed the association of PI3K pathways using various TNBC cells in terms of PTEN loss and AKT pathways. Simvastatin treatments resulted in decreased cell viabilities in various TNBC cell lines. Compared with PTEN wild-type TNBC cells, PTEN mutant-type TNBC cells showed a decreased response to simvastatin. Expressions of phosphorylated Akt and total Akt showed an inverse relationship with PTEN expression. The TNBC cell lines, which showed increased expression of p-Akt, appeared to attenuate the expression of p-Akt by PTEN loss in simvastatin-treated TNBC cells. The Akt inhibitor, LY294002, augmented the effect of simvastatin on PTEN wild-type TNBC cells. Simvastatin induces inhibition of TNBC cells via PI3K pathway activation.", 
    "75": "Hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, increasing the incidence of myocardial infarction and death. Statin-induced lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, many individuals treated with statins do not achieve their target levels of LDL-C, and thus, LDL-associated residual risk remains. Gain-of-function mutations of the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) are associated with hypercholesterolemia and increased risk of cardiovascular events. Conversely, loss-of-function mutations are linked to low plasma LDL-C levels and a reduction of cardiovascular risk without known unwanted effects on individual health. Experimental studies have revealed that PCSK9 reduces the hepatic uptake of LDL-C by increasing the endosomal and lysosomal degradation of LDL receptors (LDLR). Low intracellular cholesterol levels in response to statin treatment activate the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2), resulting in coexpression of LDLR and PCSK9. Although this self-regulatory mechanism contributes to maintain cholesterol homeostasis preventing excessive cholesterol uptake, it may limit the therapeutic effect of statins. A number of clinical studies have demonstrated that inhibition of PCSK9 alone and in addition to statins potently reduces serum LDL-C concentrations. Moreover, experimental studies indicate that PCSK9 might accelerate atherosclerosis by promoting inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and hypertension by mechanisms independent of the LDLR. Further research is needed to characterize the potential therapeutic and to rule out unwanted off-target effects of PCSK9 inhibition. In this review we elucidate the role of PCSK9 in lipid homeostasis, highlight the impact of PCSK9 on atherosclerosis, and summarize current therapeutic strategies targeting PCSK9.",

    "99": "Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare segmental premature aging disorder that recapitulates some biological and physical aspects of physiological aging. The disease is caused by a sporadic dominant mutation in the LMNA gene that leads to the expression of progerin, a mutant form of lamin A that lacks 50 amino acids and retains a toxic farnesyl modification in its carboxy-terminus. However, the mechanisms underlying cellular damage and senescence and accelerated aging in HGPS are incompletely understood. Here, we analyzed fibroblasts from healthy subjects and HGPS patients using SILAC (stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture). We found in HGPS cells a marked downregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation proteins accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction, a process thought to provoke broad organ decline during normal aging. We also found mitochondrial dysfunction in fibroblasts from adult progeroid mice expressing progerin (Lmna(G609G/G609G) knock-in mice) or prelamin A (Zmpste24-null mice). Analysis of tissues from these mouse models revealed that the damaging effect of these proteins on mitochondrial function is time- and dose-dependent. Mitochondrial alterations were not observed in the brain, a tissue with extremely low progerin expression that seems to be unaffected in HGPS. Remarkably, mitochondrial function was restored in progeroid mouse fibroblasts treated with the isoprenylation inhibitors FTI-277 or pravastatin plus zoledronate, which are being tested in HGPS clinical trials. Our results suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to premature organ decline and aging in HGPS. Beyond its effects on progeria, prelamin A and progerin may also contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction and organ damage during normal aging, since these proteins are expressed in cells and tissues from non-HGPS individuals, most prominently at advanced ages.", 
    "100": "Mutations in LMNA or defective processing of prelamin A causes premature aging disorders, including Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). Most HGPS patients carry in heterozygosis a de-novo point mutation (c.1824C>T: GGC>GGT; p.G608G) which causes the expression of the lamin A mutant protein called progerin. Despite the importance of progerin and prelamin A in accelerated aging, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. To tackle this question, we compared the proteome of skin-derived dermal fibroblast from HGPS patients and age-matched controls using quantitative stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC). Our results show a pronounced down-regulation of several components of the mitochondrial ATPase complex accompanied by up-regulation of some glycolytic enzymes. Accordingly, functional studies demonstrated mitochondrial dysfunction in HGPS fibroblasts. Moreover, our expression and functional studies using cellular and animal models confirmed that mitochondrial dysfunction is a feature of progeria which develops in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Finally, we demonstrate improved mitochondrial function in progeroid mouse cells treated with a combination of statins and aminobisphosphonates, two drugs that are being evaluated in ongoing HGPS clinical trials. Although further studies are needed to unravel the mechanisms through which progerin and prelamin A provoke mitochondrial abnormalities, our findings may pave the way to improved treatments of HGPS. These studies may also improve our knowledge of the mechanisms leading to mitochondrial dysfunction during normal aging, since both progerin and prelamin A have been found to accumulate during normal aging.",

The combination therapy significantly suppressed AngII-induced increase in maximal aortic diameter as compared with sham, whereas each monotherapy had no inhibitory effects. The combination therapy significantly reduced AngII-induced apoptosis and elastin degradation at the AAA lesion, whereas each monotherapy did not. Moreover, Rho-kinase activity, as evaluated by the extent of phosphorylation of myosin-binding subunit (a substrate of Rho-kinase) and matrix metalloproteinase activity were significantly increased in the AngII-induced AAA lesion as compared with sham, both of which were again significantly suppressed by the combination therapy.

    "104": "The beneficial effects of statin therapy in the reduction of cardiovascular pathogenesis, atherosclerosis, and diabetic complications are well known. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) plays an important role in the progression of these diseases. In contrast, soluble forms of RAGE act as decoys for RAGE ligands and may prevent the development of RAGE-mediated disorders. Soluble forms of RAGE are either produced by alternative splicing [endogenous secretory RAGE (esRAGE)] or by proteolytic shedding mediated by metalloproteinases [shed RAGE (sRAGE)]. Therefore we analyzed whether statins influence the production of soluble RAGE. Lovastatin treatment of either mouse alveolar epithelial cells endogenously expressing RAGE or HEK cells overexpressing RAGE caused induction of RAGE shedding, but did not influence secretion of esRAGE from HEK cells overexpressing esRAGE. Lovastatin-induced secretion of sRAGE was also evident after restoration of the isoprenylation pathway, demonstrating a correlation of sterol biosynthesis and activation of RAGE shedding. Lovastatin-stimulated induction of RAGE shedding was completely abolished by a metalloproteinase ADAM10 inhibitor. We also demonstrate that statins stimulate RAGE shedding at low physiologically relevant concentrations. Our results show that statins, due to their cholesterol-lowering effects, increase the soluble RAGE level by inducing RAGE shedding, and by doing this, might prevent the development of RAGE-mediated pathogenesis.", 
    "105": "A model for drug interaction between amlodipine and simvastatin was developed using concentration data obtained from a multiple-dose study consisting of single- and co-administration of amlodipine and simvastatin conducted in healthy Koreans. Amlodipine concentrations were assumed to influence the clearance of simvastatin and simvastatin acid, which as well as the oral bioavailability was allowed to vary depending on genetic polymorphisms of metabolic enzymes. Covariate effects on drug concentrations were also considered. The developed model yielded a 46% increase in simvastatin bioavailability and a 13% decrease in simvastatin clearance when amlodipine 10 mg was co-administered. When CYP3A4/5 polymorphisms were assessed by a mixture model, extensive metabolizers yielded a decrease in simvastatin bioavailability of 81% and a decrease in simvastatin clearance by 4.6 times as compared to poor metabolizers. Sixty percent of the usual dose was the optimal simvastatin dose that can minimize the interaction with amlodipine 10 mg. Age and weight had significant effects on amlodipine concentrations. In conclusion, this study has quantitatively described the pharmacokinetic interaction between simvastatin and amlodipine using a modeling approach. Given that the two drugs are often prescribed together, the developed model is expected to contribute to more efficient and safer drug treatment when they are co-administered.", 
    "106": "It is unclear whether levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) or apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) remain inversely associated with cardiovascular risk among patients who achieve very low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol on statin therapy. It is also unknown whether a rise in HDL-C or apoA-I after initiation of statin therapy is associated with a reduced cardiovascular risk.", 
    "107": "We performed a meta-analysis of 8 statin trials in which lipids and apolipoproteins were determined in all study participants at baseline and at 1-year follow-up. Individual patient data were obtained for 38,153 trial participants allocated to statin therapy, of whom 5387 suffered a major cardiovascular event. HDL-C levels were associated with a reduced risk of major cardiovascular events (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81-0.86 per 1 standard deviation increment), as were apoA-I levels (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.72-0.82). This association was also observed among patients achieving on-statin low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels <50 mg/dL. An increase of HDL-C was not associated with reduced cardiovascular risk (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.94-1.01 per 1 standard deviation increment), whereas a rise in apoA-I was (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.90-0.97).", 
    "108": "Among patients treated with statin therapy, HDL-C and apoA-I levels were strongly associated with a reduced cardiovascular risk, even among those achieving very low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. An apoA-I increase was associated with a reduced risk of major cardiovascular events, whereas for HDL-C this was not the case. These findings suggest that therapies that increase apoA-I concentration require further exploration with regard to cardiovascular risk reduction.", 
    "109": "Erectile dysfunction (ED) is usually associated with cardiovascular disease and reduced endothelial function. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of tadalafil and statin on the endothelial function of cavernous and brachial arteries in healthy men and in patients with ED. The cases included in the study were as follows: 150 men with ED complaints for at least 6 months, and 50 healthy volunteers without sexual problems. Patients were randomly divided into four groups of equal numbers. Group 1 received 20 mg of tadalafil on alternate days, Group 2 received 10 mg of statin a day, Group 3 received tadalafil on alternate days and 10 mg of statin a day, and the last group served as controls. Noninvasive evaluation of brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and percentage of increase in cavernosal arteries diameter (PICAD) was conducted via ultrasound at baseline and 4 weeks after administration of tadalafil or atorvastatin. Before drug administration, FMD and PICAD values did not significantly differ among the three treatment groups. After drug administration, FMD and PICAD values significantly increased in patients receiving tadalafil and tadalafil+statin (P < 0.001), but not in patients receiving only statin. These findings suggested that use of tadalafil alone and tadalafil combined with statin improved endothelial function of cavernous and brachial arteries.", 
    "110": "No indices are currently available to facilitate clinicians to identify patients who need either statin monotherapy or statin-ezetimibe combined treatment. We aimed to investigate whether cholesterol synthesis and absorption markers can predict the cholesterol-lowering response to statin. Total 306 statin-na\u00efve patients with high risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) were treated with atorvastatin 20 mg/day for 1 month. Cholesterol synthesis and absorption markers and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were measured before and after treatment. Atorvastatin decreased LDL-C by 36.8% (range: decrease of 74.5% to increase of 31.9%). Baseline cholesterol synthesis marker lathosterol and cholesterol absorption marker campesterol codetermined the effect of atorvastatin treatment. The effect of cholesterol lowering by atorvastatin was significantly associated with baseline lathosterol levels but modified bidirectionally by baseline campesterol levels. In patients with the highest baseline campesterol levels, atorvastatin treatment decreased cholesterol absorption by 46.1%, which enhanced the effect of LDL-C lowering. Atorvastatin treatment increased cholesterol absorption by 52.3% in those with the lowest baseline campesterol levels, which attenuated the effect of LDL-C reduction. Especially those with the highest lathosterol but the lowest campesterol levels at baseline had significantly less LDL-C reduction than those with the same baseline lathosterol levels but the highest campesterol levels (27.3% versus 42.4%, P = 0.002). These results suggest that combined patterns of cholesterol synthesis/absorption markers, rather than each single marker, are potential predictors of the LDL-C-lowering effects of atorvastatin in high-risk CHD patients.", 
    "111": "Aging with comorbidities, obesity, and rapid recovery from operation may increase the need for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, but long-term use of statins may be associated with a decreased risk of gallstones. This population-based cohort study presents the changing rate and causative factors of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in Finland during the era of statin use.", 
    "112": "Age structure of the population, changes in body mass index and diabetes, and the number of all cholecystectomies in 1995-2009 were retrieved from the registers of National Institute for Health and Welfare. Additionally, these results were supplemented by a population-based retrospective cohort (1581 laparoscopic cholecystectomy) in one community-based hospital area. The risk factors for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, use of statins, and surgical outcome were analyzed.", 
    "113": "During the 15 years, 123,794 cholecystectomies were performed in Finland, of which 94,740 (76.5%) were performed using laparoscopic technique. The median rate of laparoscopic cholecystectomy varied between 110 and 140 operations per 100,000 inhabitants. In 1995-2009, the annual number of cholecystectomies decreased from 8600 to 7500, the number of laparoscopic cholecystectomies increased by 10%, and the number of open cholecystectomies declined by 60%. In a cohort of 1581 laparoscopic cholecystectomies, the proportion of elderly (>65 years of age), obese (body mass index > 30 kg/m(2)), and diabetic patients increased from 17% to 28%, 9% to 34%, and 4% to 8%, respectively. Use of statins increased more than fourfold during the 15 years.", 
    "114": "The rates of all cholecystectomies decreased despite marked increase in laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed. The increase in risk factors for gallstones in Finland implied more marked increase in laparoscopic cholecystectomies. The possible role of statins on gallstone disease is discussed.",

    "116": "The Cochrane databases, MEDLINE and EMBASE, were systematically searched. The eligibility of prospective studies that assigned CHF patients to receive statin treatment and a control (no statin treatment), had defined prognostic outcomes as primary endpoint, and had a minimal follow-up of 12 months was determined.", 
    "117": "Fifteen studies involving 45,110 patients were included in the analysis. Additional statin treatment was associated with reduced all-cause mortality (risk ratios [RR] = 0.71, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.61-0.83) and reduced rehospitalisation rate for heart failure (RR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.74-0.96). Statin treatment, however, had little impact on pump failure mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and sudden cardiac death. Atorvastatin treatment appeared to facilitate to reduce all-cause mortality (lnRR = 0.61, p = 0.05) and rehospitalisation for heart failure (lnRR = 0.44, p = 0.04) compared with non-atorvastatin therapy.", 
    "118": "Based on the available data, statins persistently decreased all-cause mortality and the incidence of rehospitalisation for heart failure in CHF patients, and the benefits might be partially associated with use of specific statin.", 
    "119": "Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) represent a major class of compounds for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia due to their ability to inhibit de novo cholesterol synthesis. In addition to their hypolipidemic effects, chemoprotective properties have been attributed to statins as well. These effects involve multiple mechanisms, which, however, are not known in detail. The aim of our study was to assess in non-malignant as well as cancer cells the impact of simvastatin on the amount of cytosolic lipid droplets (LDs) implicated in many biological processes including proliferation, inflammation, carcinogenesis, apoptosis, necrosis or growth arrest.", 
    "120": "Human embryonic kidney cells HEK-293T and human pancreatic cancer cells MiaPaCa-2 were treated with simvastatin (6 and 12\u00a0\u03bcM) for 24 and 48\u00a0hours respectively. Neutral lipid probe Nile Red was used for detection of LDs by fluorescence microscopy. Cellular cholesterol content was determined by HPLC. Changes in expression of genes related to lipid metabolism in simvastatin-treated MiaPaCa-2 cells were examined by DNA microarray analysis. Validation of gene expression changes was performed using quantitative RT-PCR.", 
    "121": "The treatment of the cells with simvastatin increased their intracellular content of LDs in both non-malignant as well as cancer cells, partially due to the uptake of cholesterol and triacylglyceroles from medium; but in particular, due to enhanced synthesis of triacylglyceroles as proved by significant overexpression of genes related to de novo synthesis of triacylglyceroles and phospholipids. In addition, simvastatin also markedly influenced expression of genes directly affecting cell proliferation and signaling.", 
    "122": "Simvastatin treatment led to accumulation of cytosolic LDs within the examined cells, a phenomenon which might contribute to the antiproliferative effects of statins.", 
    "123": "Statins are an established class of drugs with proven efficacy in cardiovascular risk reduction. The concern over statin safety was first raised with the revelation of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with the use of now withdrawn cerivastatin. Enhanced understanding of the mechanisms behind adverse effects of statins including an insight into the pharmacokinetic properties have minimised fear of statin use among clinicians. Studies reveal that occurrence of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are rare 1/100000 patient-years. The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis varies between statins due to varying pharmacokinetic profiles. This explains the differing abilities of statins to adverse effects and drug interaction potentials that precipitate adverse effects. Higher dose of rosuvastatin (80 mg/day) was associated with proteinuria and hematuria while lower doses were devoid of such effects. Awareness of drugs interacting with statins and knowledge of certain combinations such as statin and fibrates together with monitoring of altered creatine kinase activity may greatly minimise associated adverse effects. Statins also asymptomatically raise levels of hepatic transaminases but are not correlated with hepatotoxicity. Statins are safe and well tolerated including more recent potent statins such as, rosuvastatin. The benefits of intensive statin use in cardiovascular risk reduction greatly outweigh risks. The present review discusses underlying causes of statin-associated adverse effects including management in high risk groups.", 
    "124": "A 57-year-old man presented with symptoms of intermittent claudication and was diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease. He was advised to stop smoking and start a walking programme. He had a background history of hypercholesterolaemia and erectile dysfunction, for which he was taking simvastatin and phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor sildenafil, respectively. After starting his exercise programme, he noted that his walking distance was more than doubled on the mornings after taking sildenafil, and he has been using sildenafil primarily for shopping trips since that time. Although this single-patient self-experiment has the potential for placebo confounding, the patient was not led to expect this benefit, and there is evidence that reduced nitric oxide bioactivity plays an important role in the pathophysiology of peripheral arterial disease. Given the biological plausibility of this effect, we feel that a randomised, blinded and placebo-controlled clinical study is warranted to confirm the benefit of phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors in peripheral arterial disease.", 
    "125": "We previously demonstrated that propofol interacted with the leukocyte adhesion molecule leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) and inhibited the production of interleukin-2 via LFA-1 in a dependent manner. However, the binding site(s) of propofol on LFA-1 remains unknown.", 
    "126": "First, the inhibition of LFA-1's ligand binding by propofol was confirmed in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) ELISA-type assay. The binding site of propofol on LFA-1 was probed with a photolabeling experiment using a photoactivatable propofol analog called azi-propofol-m. The adducted residues of LFA-1 by this compound were determined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. In addition, the binding of propofol to the ligand-binding domain of LFA-1 was examined using 1-aminoanthracene (1-AMA) displacement assay. Furthermore, the binding site(s) of 1-AMA and propofol on LFA-1 was studied using the docking program GLIDE.", 
    "127": "We demonstrated that propofol impaired the binding of LFA-1 to its ligand intercellular adhesion molecule-1. The photolabeling experiment demonstrated that the adducted residues were localized in the allosteric cavity of the ligand-binding domain of LFA-1 called \"lovastatin site.\" The shift of fluorescence spectra was observed when 1-AMA was coincubated with the low-affinity conformer of LFA-1 ligand-binding domain (wild-type [WT] \u03b1L I domain), not with the high-affinity conformer, suggesting that 1-AMA bound only to WT \u03b1L I domain. In the 1-AMA displacement assay, propofol decreased 1-AMA fluorescence signal (at 520 nm), suggesting that propofol competed with 1-AMA and bound to the WT \u03b1L I domain. The docking simulation demonstrated that both 1-AMA and propofol bound to the lovastatin site, which agreed with the photolabeling experiment.", 
    "128": "We demonstrated that propofol bound to the lovastatin site in LFA-1. Previously we showed that the volatile anesthetics isoflurane and sevoflurane bound to this site. Taken together, the lovastatin site is an example of the common binding sites for anesthetics currently used clinically.", 
    "129": "Statins are widely used for preventing cardiovascular disease, yet recent reports suggest an increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). We estimated the one-year risk of AKI associated with statin initiation and determined the comparative safety of individual statin formulations.",

We estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) with adjusted and propensity score (PS)-matched Cox-proportional hazards models. Models were run separately in insurance groups and adjusted for cardiovascular and renal risk factors, markers of healthcare utilization, and other medication use.", 
    "131": "We identified 3,905,155 statin initiators and 2,817,621 eligible non-users. The adjusted HR of AKI in statin initiators compared to non-users was: commercial, HR\u2009=\u20091.04 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.09); Medicare, HR\u2009=\u20090.72 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.75).

Among those with high CRP, there was an increased frequency of high CCS (C100) as compared with their counterparts (71 vs 50 %, p = 0.001). The association between CRP and CCS persisted even after adjustment for age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors and statin therapy. The area under the receiver-operating curve for CRP was 0.606 using CCS C100 as a binary outcome. The sensitivities for CCS C100 were 40 and 74 % for the cutoff points of CRP C3 or 1 mg/L, respectively.",

    "137": "Since contradictory findings have been reported on potential effects of statins in modulating the inflammatory response, we have analysed the biological activity of lovastatin both in vitro using the Raw 264.7 murine macrophagic cell line and in vivo using BALB/c mice. When added to Raw 264.7 cells in combination with lipopolysaccharide, lovastatin significantly potentiated the release of interleukin-1\u03b2, interleukin-6 and interleukin-12 with respect to lipopolysaccharide alone and showed an additive effect on the release of nitric oxide. Similarly, when lovastatin was intraperitoneally administrated to BALB/c mice, it did not induce any pro-inflammatory effect when used alone, but it significantly potentiated the pro-inflammatory activity of lipopolysaccharide, in terms of number of intraperitoneal cells and serum levels of serum amyloid A, interleukin-1\u03b2, interleukin-6 and interleukin-12. A potential clinical implication of our study is that lovastatin might exert a pro-inflammatory activity in subjects affected by inflammatory processes, with clinically evident or subclinical infections.",

Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that statin therapy was beneficial for all patients undergoing isolated valve surgery, n = 5013, P = 0.03 and isolated aortic valve surgery, n = 3220, P = 0.03, but not isolated mitral valve surgery n = 1793, P = 0.4. Cox regression analysis of the study cohort revealed that statin therapy was a significant factors determining long-term survival in the study cohort, postisolated aortic valve replacement and postisolated biological aortic valve replacement. Statins therapy was not associated with an increased long-term survival post-mitral valve replacement or repair. Propensity matching resulted in 1555 patients receiving statins being matched 1:1 with those not receiving statins. The results after propensity matching concurred with that of the Cox regression analyses, demonstrating that statin therapy was significantly associated with reduced in-hospital mortality, hospital length of stay and postoperative creatinine kinase, muscle-brain isoenzyme release.",

    "142": "Statins are a family of drugs used in hypercholesterolemia. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of statins on body and liver fat accumulation in obese Zucker rats. Seventy Zucker (fa/fa) rats were divided into seven groups. Rats from six statin groups were treated with pravastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, fluvastatin and lovastatin respectively, at a dose of 0.6 mg/kg body weight/day. After 6 weeks, liver and white adipose tissue from intra-abdominal and subcutaneous locations were dissected and weighed. Subcutaneous adipose tissue from rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin and lovastatin treated rats was significantly increased. Fatty acid synthase (FAS) activity was increased by the administration of fluvastatin and lovastatin, as was glucose-6-P dehydrogenase (G6PDH) by the administration of atorvastatin and lovastatin. No changes were observed in malic enzyme (ME) activity. Furthermore, heparin-releasable lipoprotein lipase (HR-LPL) was increased in all groups where the subcutaneous depot was increased, and total LPL increased only in rosuvastatin and fluvastatin-treated groups. With regard to liver, there were no changes in weight but the amount of triacylglycerols was increased in rosuvastatin group, as well as its liver damage was higher. In this group FAS and G6PDH activities were increased and no changes were observed in ME, acyl CoA oxidase (ACO) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1a (CPT-1a) activities. All statins, with the exception of simvastatin, worsen insulin resistance. These results show that statins have different effects on body fat accumulation. Moreover, rosuvastatin also shows a prosteatotic effect. These results should be taken into account for statin choice in prescription.", 
    "143": "The widespread clinical use of statins has contributed to significant reductions in the rate of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality over the past 3 decades, and statins are considered first-line therapy for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Nevertheless, various other lipid-lowering agents can provide clinical benefit by supplementing or augmenting statin therapy in patients with severe hypercholesterolaemia or mixed dyslipidaemia, or by providing an alternative for patients who are intolerant to statins. Bile acid resins and niacin were prescribed for lipid modification for years before the introduction of the statins, and new data continue to emerge regarding their use in different patient groups and for specific conditions. Ezetimibe can be appropriate for patients whose primary lipid abnormality is an elevated LDL-cholesterol level, whereas the fibrates seem to be most beneficial in patients with low levels of HDL cholesterol and elevated triglycerides. At the end of 2012 and the beginning of 2013, the first microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor, lomitapide, and the first antisense therapy to target apolipoprotein B, mipomersen, were approved for the treatment of individuals with extremely elevated LDL-cholesterol levels caused by homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. Although two agents in the experimental class of cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors have failed to show a benefit in clinical trials, newer drugs in this class could provide an additional strategy to address residual cardiovascular risk in patients treated with statins.",

These observations lead us to suspect survivor bias. To identify this bias, results were stratified on time between bleeding event and inclusion, and repeated for a negative control (an exposure not related to survival): blood group non-O. The ORs for exposure to statins increased gradually to 1.37 with shorter time between outcome and inclusion, whereas ORs for the negative control remained constant, confirming our hypothesis.",

In addition to lifestyle and dietary counselling, treatment priorities are (i) in children, statins, ezetimibe, and bile acid binding resins, and (ii) in adults, maximal potent statin dose, ezetimibe, and bile acid binding resins.

Muscle biopsy demonstrated a predominantly necrotizing myopathy with minimal lymphocytic infiltrates, MHC class I expression in necrotic muscle fibers, and complement deposition on scattered non-necrotic muscle fibers. Muscle protein analysis by western blot was normal. The patient did not improve with steroid and methotrexate and required monthly intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy. Muscle strength gradually improved, CK levels normalized and IVIG were stopped 1 year later. Screening for anti-HMGCR antibodies, not available at the time of presentation, was highly positive. Identification of anti-HMGCR antibodies in statin-exposed patients with myopathy appears to be helpful both for differential diagnosis and for treatment strategy.

The aims of this study were to review the surgical outcomes of patients with CSDH and assess the risks of antiplatelet in their surgical management. METHODS. We retrospectively analysed 448 consecutive patients with CSDH treated by one burr hole surgery at our institution. Among them, 58 patients had been on antiplatelet therapy. We discontinued the antiplatelet agents before surgery for all 58 patients. For 51 of these 58 patients (87.9%), early surgery was performed within 0-2 days from admission. We analysed the association between recurrence and patient characteristics, including history of antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy; age (< 70 years or \u2265 70 years); side; history of angiotensin receptor II blocker, angiotensin converting enzyme blocker, or statin therapy; and previous medical history of head trauma, infarction, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, haemodialysis, seizure, cancer, or liver cirrhosis. RESULTS. Recurrence occurred in 40 patients (8.9%), which was one of the lowest rates in the literature. Univariate analysis showed that only the presence of bilateral haematomas was associated with increased recurrence rate while antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy did not significantly increase recurrence risk. Also, the recurrence rate from early surgery (0-2 days from drug cessation) for patients on antiplatelet therapy was not significantly higher than that from elective surgery (5 days or more after drug cessation). However, multivariate analysis revealed that previous history of cerebral infarction was an independent risk factor for CSDH recurrence. CONCLUSIOns. Our overall data support the safety of early surgery for patients on the preoperative antiplatelet therapy without drug cessation or platelet infusion. Patients with a previous history of infarction may need to be closely followed regardless of antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy.",

    "212": "Niacin (nicotinic acid) has been used for decades as a lipid-lowering drug. The clinical use of niacin to treat dyslipidemic conditions is limited by its side effects. Niacin, along with fibrates, are the only approved drugs which elevate high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) along with its effects on low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) and triglycerides. Whether niacin has a beneficial role in lowering cardiovascular risk on the background of well-controlled LDLc has not been established. In fact, it remains unclear whether niacin, either in the setting of well-controlled LDLc or in combination with other lipid-lowering agents, confers any therapeutic benefit and if so, by which mechanism. The results of recent trials reject the hypothesis that simply raising HDLc is cardioprotective. However, in the case of the clinical trials, structural limitations of trial design complicate their interpretation. This is also true of the most recent Heart Protection Study 2-Treatment of HDLc to Reduce the Incidence of Vascular Events (HPS2-THRIVE) trial in which niacin is combined with an antagonist of the D prostanoid (DP) receptor. Human genetic studies have also questioned the relationship between cardiovascular benefit and HDLc. It remains to be determined whether niacin may have clinical utility in particular subgroups, such as statin intolerant patients with hypercholesterolemia or those who cannot achieve a sufficient reduction in LDLc. It also is unclear whether a potentially beneficial effect of niacin is confounded by DP antagonism in HPS2-THRIVE."
