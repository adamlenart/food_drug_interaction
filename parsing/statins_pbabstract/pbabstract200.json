    "4": "Multivariate conditional logistic regression was used to identify predictors of a recurrent coronary event. Although classic cardiac risk factors and drug therapies were similar for both groups at the time of the incident event, the mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) level, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL) level, and LDL:HDL ratio were higher and HDL levels were lower in the case patients compared with control patients (p<0.001) at the time of the case patients' recurrent events. More case patients received a statin but at a lower dose, defined as less than 40 mg of simvastatin equivalent (cases 45% vs controls 31%, p<0.001). Factors associated with a recurrent event included higher chronic disease score (odds ratio [OR] 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-1.2), higher LDL:HDL ratio (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.5-3.3), and statin dose less than 40-mg simvastatin equivalent (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.8-4.9).",

The simvastatin-loaded cubic nanoparticles were prepared through fragmentation of the GMO/poloxamer 407 bulk cubic-phase gel using high-pressure homogenization. The internal structure of the cubic nanoparticles was identified by cryo-transmission electron microscopy. The mean diameter of the cubic nanoparticles varied within the range of 100-150 nm, and both GMO/poloxamer 407 ratio and theoretical drug loading had no significant effect on particle size and distribution. Almost complete entrapment with efficiency over 98% was achieved due to the high affinity of simvastatin to the hydrophobic regions of the cubic phase. Release of simvastatin from the cubic nanoparticles was limited both in 0.1 M hydrochloride solution containing 0.2% sodium lauryl sulfate and fasted-state simulated intestinal fluid with a total release of <3.0% at 10 h. Pharmacokinetic profiles in beagle dogs showed sustained plasma levels of simvastatin for cubic nanoparticles over 12 h. The relative oral bioavailability of simvastatin cubic nanoparticles calculated on the basis of area under the curve was 241% compared to simvastatin crystal powder. The enhancement of simvastatin bioavailability was possibly attributable to facilitated absorption by lipids in the formulation rather than improved release.", 
    "11": "Statins have been demonstrated to significantly affect the prognosis and outcome of patients with cardiac diseases. Several studies have suggested pleiotropic effects of the statins in these patients. The present study was designed to examine the effects of atorvastatin on inflammation, endothelial function, cardiac performance and exercise tolerance in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM).", 
    "12": "Sixty-four patients with IDCM were divided randomly into an atorvastatin treatment group (atorvastatin 10 mg/d orally) and a placebo control group. Before and 12 weeks after the treatment, circulating soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), Von Willebrand factor (vWF) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery was measured, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and the 6-min walk test (6MWT) evaluated.", 
    "13": "After atorvastatin treatment, LVEF increased from 34.5 +/- 5.7% to 41.4 +/- 4.5% (P < 0.05), and from 32.8 +/- 4.0% to 36.9 +/- 5.2% (P < 0.05) in the placebo group. Also, the distances covered in the 6MWT increased from 358 +/- 61 m to 431 +/- 66 m in the atorvastatin group, and from 351 +/- 70 m to 382 +/- 74 m in the placebo group (both p < 0.05 vs. baseline). The increases in LVEF and 6MWT distances were significantly greater in the atorvastatin than in the placebo group. sICAM-1, CRP and vWF levels decreased and FMD increased significantly in the atorvastatin group, but not in the control group. Correlation analysis showed that the baseline sICAM-1 level was positively correlated with plasma CRP and vWF levels (r = 0.554 and 0.628, respectively); FMD was inversely correlated with serum sICAM-1 and plasma vWF levels (r = -0.579 and -0.590, respectively) and positively correlated with LVEF and distance attained in 6MWT (r = 0.536 and 0.522, respectively).", 
    "14": "Twelve weeks of treatment with atorvastatin significantly decreased serum sICAM-1, CRP and vWF levels, and improved the FMD, LVEF and 6MWT outcomes. Inhibition of inflammation, alleviating endothelium damage and endothelial dysfunction might comprise part of the underlying mechanisms leading to the improvement of LV function and exercise tolerance in patients with IDCM.", 
    "15": "Many patients who receive statin therapy for hyperlipidemia-such as patients with diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome--have residual cardiovascular risk. These patients often have dyslipidemia, including low levels of HDL cholesterol and elevated levels of triglycerides and small, dense LDL. For such patients, combination treatment with statins and fibrates is a potentially useful strategy to improve lipid and lipoprotein profiles and reduce cardiovascular risk. However, statin-fibrate combination regimens have potential adverse effects on skeletal muscle, including myopathy. To date, no large-scale, prospective, randomized, controlled trial has evaluated the safety and efficacy of statin-fibrate combination therapy; one such trial is underway but will not report data until 2010. Until then, clinicians need to consider pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, metabolic, pathophysiologic and other factors that can increase the systemic exposure of statins and/or fibrates and hence heighten the risk of toxic effects on muscles, as well as data from clinical trials and recommendations of consensus panels to optimize the safety of such combination regimens. On the basis of currently available data, fenofibrate or fenofibric acid is the fibrate of choice when used in combination with a statin because each is, in theory, associated with a lower risk of myopathy than gemfibrozil.", 
    "16": "Although brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) predicts recurrent cardiovascular events, its predictive value for incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in adults free of CVD is not well established. We assessed the predictive value of FMD for incident CVD events in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA).", 
    "17": "Brachial artery FMD was measured in a nested case-cohort sample of 3026 of 6814 subjects (mean+/-SD age, 61.2+/-9.9 years) in MESA, a population-based cohort study of adults free of clinical CVD at baseline recruited at 6 clinic sites in the United States. The sample included 50.2% female, 34.3% white, 19.7% Chinese, 20.8% black, and 25.1% Hispanic subjects. Probability-weighted Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to examine the association between FMD and 5 years of adjudicated incident CVD events, including incident myocardial infarction, definite angina, coronary revascularization (coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, or other revascularization), stroke, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and CVD death. Mean (SD) FMD of the cohort was 4.4% (2.8). In probability-weighted Cox models, FMD/unit SD was significantly associated with incident cardiovascular events in the univariate model (adjusted for age and sex) (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.65 to 0.97; P=0.01), after adjustment for the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.62 to 0.97; P=0.025), and in the multivariable model (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.71 to 0.99; P=0.04) after adjustment for age, sex, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking status, systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, heart rate, statin use, and blood pressure medication use. The c statistic (area under the curve) values of FMD, FRS, and FRS+FMD were 0.65, 0.74, and 0.74, respectively. Compared with the FRS alone, the addition of FMD to the FRS net correctly reclassifies 52% of subjects with no incident CVD event but net incorrectly reclassifies 23% of subjects with an incident CVD event, an overall net correct reclassification of 29% (P<0.001).", 
    "18": "Brachial FMD is a predictor of incident cardiovascular events in population-based adults. Even though the addition of FMD to the FRS did not improve discrimination of subjects at risk of CVD events in receiver operating characteristic analysis, it improved the classification of subjects as low, intermediate, and high CVD risk compared with the FRS.", 
    "19": "New highly sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) has been developed and validated for the determination of pravastatin (PRV) in human plasma samples. PRV was coupled to keyhole limpt hemocyanin (KLH) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) via its terminal carboxylic acid group by carbodiimide reagent. PRV-KLH conjugate was used as an immunogen for raising anti-PRV polyclonal antibody in rabbits. The generated anti-PRV antibody recognized PRV with high affinity and selectivity. PRV-BSA conjugate was immobilized onto microwell plates and used as a solid phase. The assay involved a competitive binding reaction between PRV, in plasma sample, and the immobilized PRV-BSA for the binding sites on a limited amount of the anti-PRV antibody. The anti-PRV antibody bound to the plate wells was quantified with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-immunoglobulin second anti-rabbit IgG antibody and 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine as a substrate for the peroxidase enzyme. The concentration of PRV in the sample was quantified by its ability to inhibit the binding of the anti-PRV antibody to the immobilized PRV-BSA and subsequently the color development in the assay wells. The conditions of the proposed EIA were investigated and the optimum conditions were employed in the determination of PRV in plasma samples. The assay limit of detection was 0.2 ng mL(-1) and the effective working range at relative standard deviation (RSD) of <or=5% was 0.5-20 ng mL(-1). The mean analytical recovery of PRV from spiked plasma was 100.9+/-2.98%. The precision of the assay was satisfactory; RSD was 2.61-3.70 and 3.96-4.17% for intra- and inter-assay precision, respectively. The analytical procedure is convenient, and one can analyze approximately 200 samples per working day, facilitating the processing of large-number batch of samples. The proposed EIA has a great value in the routine analysis of PRV in plasma samples for its therapeutic monitoring and pharmacokinetic studies.",

The primary endpoint of the study was the change from baseline to 52 weeks of carotid arterial wall volume, reflecting plaque burden, as measured by carotid cardiovascular magnetic resonance. Rosiglitazone or placebo was allocated to 28 and 29 patients respectively. Patients were managed to have equivalent glycemic control over the study period, but in fact the rosiglitazone group lowered their HbA1c by 0.88% relative to placebo (P < 0.001). Most patients received a statin or fibrate as lipid control medication (rosiglitazone 78%, controls 83%). Data are presented as mean +/- SD. At baseline, the carotid arterial wall volume in the placebo group was 1146 +/- 550 mm3 and in the rosiglitazone group was 1354 +/- 532 mm3. After 52 weeks, the respective volumes were 1134 +/- 523 mm3 and 1348 +/- 531 mm3.

    "23": "Numerous modifiable factors have been associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer, including the chronic use of NSAIDs.

    "35": "We have recently reported that transgenic (mRen2)27 rats (Ren2 rats) exhibit pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), which is, in part, mediated by oxidative stress. Since 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) exhibit beneficial vascular effects independent of cholesterol synthesis, we hypothesized that rosuvastatin (RSV) treatment ameliorates PAH and pulmonary vascular remodeling in Ren2 rats, in part, by reducing oxidative stress. Six-week-old male Ren2 and Sprague-Dawley rats received RSV (10 mg x kg(-1) x day(-)1 ip) or vehicle for 3 wk. After treatment, right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured. To evaluate treatment effects on pulmonary arteriole remodeling, morphometric analyses were performed to quantitate medial thickening and cell proliferation, whereas whole lung samples were used to quantitate the levels of 3-nitrotyrosine, superoxide, stable nitric oxide (NO) metabolites [nitrates and nitrites (NO(x))], and expression of NO synthase isoforms. In the Ren2 rat, RVSP is normal at 5 wk of age, PAH develops between 5 and 7 wk of age, and the elevated pressure is maintained with little variation through 13 wk. At 8 wk of age, left ventricular function and blood gases were normal in the Ren2 rat. Ren2 rats exhibited elevations in medial hypertrophy due to smooth muscle cell proliferation, 3-nitrotyrosine, NO(x), NADPH oxidase activity, and endothelial NO synthase expression compared with Sprague-Dawley rats. RSV significantly blunted the increase in RVSP but did not reduce MAP in the Ren2 rat; additionally, RSV significantly attenuated the elevated parameters examined in the Ren2 rat. These data suggest that statins may be a clinically viable adjunct treatment of PAH through reducing peroxynitrite formation.",

    "42": "Studies show reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an important independent predictor of cardiovascular death and is characterised by both pulmonary and systemic inflammation. Evidence shows statins have important anti-inflammatory effects in both the lungs and arteries. Although randomised control trials are yet to be reported, non-randomised studies have consistently shown benefit in COPD patients taking statins compared with those not. These include reductions in both cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity/mortality. Other potential benefits include a reduced decline in FEV(1) and reduced risk of lung cancer. It is argued that confounding by a \"healthy user effect\" is unlikely to explain the observed benefit.

Cytostatic/cytotoxic effects were measured using crystal violet or MTT reduction assays. Cell cycle regulation was investigated using flow cytometry and Western blotting. The combination of lovastatin and sorafenib (but not sunitinib) produced synergistic cytostatic/cytotoxic effects against all tested tumor cell lines. In this study, an impairment of the protein prenylation, especially geranylgeranylation, resulted predominantly in the potentiation of the cytostatic/cytotoxic activity of sorafenib, in cell cycle arrest in G1 phase, and, in poor induction of apoptosis. Moreover, due to the fact that it has been well documented that sorafenib compromises the heart function, we studied the interaction of lovastatin and sorafenib using rat cardiomyoblast line H9c2. The combination showed strong synergistic cardiotoxic effects. Statins and tyrosine kinase inhibitors were used at doses that are achievable clinically, which makes the combination promising for future studies, especially in urooncology, bearing in mind possible cardiotoxic effects.",

After controlling for confounders, the strongest association with hypoadiponectinemia was observed with family history of FCHL, followed by HDL-C (negatively) and age (positively). These variables jointly explained 15% of the total variance of serum adiponectin levels. After 24-week of treatment, adiponectin was increased by 12.5% (p<0.05) by atorvastatin and was reduced by 10% by fenofibrate, resulting in a treatment difference of 22.5% in favor of atorvastatin (p<0.017).",

In the present study, we used PET to investigate the association between serum total cholesterol levels and cerebral metabolic rate for glucose metabolism (CMRgl) in 117 cognitively normal late middle-aged APOE epsilon4 homozygotes, heterozygotes and non-carriers. Higher serum total cholesterol levels were associated with lower CMRgl bilaterally in precuneus, parietotemporal and prefrontal regions previously found to be preferentially affected by AD, and in additional frontal regions previously found to be preferentially affected by normal aging. The associations were greater in APOE epsilon4 carriers than non-carriers in some of the AD-affected brain regions. We postulate that higher midlife serum total cholesterol levels accelerate brain processes associated with normal aging and conspire with other risk factors in the predisposition to AD. We propose using PET in proof-of-concept randomized controlled trials to rapidly evaluate the effects of midlife cholesterol-lowering treatments on the brain changes associated with normal aging and AD.",

    "60": "Male C57Bl/6 mice underwent 68% hepatectomy and exposed to LPS after 24h. Animals were pretreated with simvastatin (0.02 and 0.2mg/kg). Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) as well as leukocyte infiltration and hepatocyte apoptosis were examined 6h after LPS challenge. An in vitro endothelial cell adhesion assay was used to study the mechanisms of simvastatin on leukocyte adhesion and the role of P-selectin and lymphocyte function antigen-1 (LFA-1).", 
    "61": "Partial hepatectomy increased the sensitivity of the remnant liver tissue to LPS-provoked tissue injury. Simvastatin pretreatment reduced the LPS-induced increase in serum levels of ALT by 65% in hepatectomized animals. Moreover, simvastatin decreased leukocyte infiltration and hepatocyte apoptosis in the liver remnant of endotoxemic mice. LPS-provoked serum levels of TNF-alpha were decreased by 83% in hepatectomized animals treated with simvastatin. TNF-alpha-induced leukocyte adhesion as well as P-selectin expression in endothelial cells and LFA-1 function were inhibited by simvastatin in vitro.", 
    "62": "These novels findings demonstrate that simvastatin protects the remnant liver against endotoxemic injury following major hepatectomy. Thus, simvastatin reduced LPS-induced leukocyte recruitment and hepatocyte apoptosis in the liver remnant. One key mechanism appears to be related to the inhibition of TNF-alpha formation and function (P-selectin expression) as well as to direct actions on LFA-1 function. Thus, simvastatin may represent a novel therapeutic approach to prevent septic liver damage after partial liver resection.", 
    "63": "Insulin resistance, a key feature of obesity, the metabolic syndrome and Type 2 diabetes mellitus, results in an array of metabolic and vascular phenomena which ultimately promote the development of atherosclerosis. Endothelial dysfunction is intricately related to insulin resistance through the parallel stimulatory effects of insulin on glucose disposal in metabolic tissues and NO production in the endothelium. Perturbations characteristic of insulin resistance, including dyslipidaemia, inflammation and oxidative stress, may jeopardize the structural or functional integrity of the endothelium. Recent evidence suggests that endothelial damage is mitigated by endogenous reparative processes which mediate endothelial regeneration. EPCs (endothelial progenitor cells) are circulating cells which have been identified as mediators of endothelial repair. Several of the abnormalities associated with insulin resistance, including reduced NO bioavailability, increased production of ROS (reactive oxygen species) and down-regulation of intracellular signalling pathways, have the potential to disrupt EPC function. Improvement in the number and function of EPCs may contribute to the protective actions of evidence-based therapies to reduce cardiometabolic risk. In the present article, we review the putative effects of insulin resistance on EPCs, discuss the underlying mechanisms and highlight potential therapeutic manoeuvres which could improve vascular repair in individuals with insulin resistance.",

The present article discusses some limitations of the GALA trial. Firstly, the expected stroke and death rates following CEA is so low, that it was unlikely that the GALA trial would show any significant difference between local and general anesthesia. Secondly, preoperative statin use was not recorded. Thirdly, intraoperative shunt usa ge rates (a possible parameter for the development of stroke) varied considerably between the 2 groups (43% vs. 14%, for general vs. local anesthesia, respectively; P < .0001), as well as between UK and non-UK surgeons who always (73.6% vs. 20.8%, respectively; P < .0001), never (4.2% vs. 26%, respectively; P < .0002), or selectively (22.2% vs. 53.2%, respectively; P < .0001) used a shunt. Furthermore, no information was provided regarding the type of shunts used; for example, atraumatic shunts may be associated with lower perioperative stroke rates. These limitations could influence the interpretation of the results of the GALA trial. Due to lack of differences between the 2 groups and the presence of the above limitations, it seems likely that this trial will have little effect on clinical practice.",

    "93": "Cardiovascular disease is as common in individuals with chronic liver disease as in the general population. Moreover, recent data suggest that patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may have a cardiovascular risk greater than that conferred by the conventional risk factors. There is unequivocal evidence that cardiovascular disease is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in this patient population and thus requires consideration of aggressive therapy with lipid-lowering agents such as statins. Because all statins are hepatically cleared and can cause elevations in liver biochemistries, there is a concern that patients with underlying liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatotoxicity. However, recent data, along with an assessment of statin safety by the Liver Expert Panel, suggest that statins are generally well tolerated in patients with chronic liver disease such as NAFLD, primary biliary cirrhosis, and hepatitis C virus. These drugs also appear to be safe in patients with stable/compensated cirrhosis. However, decompensated cirrhosis and acute liver failure should be considered contraindications for lipid-lowering therapy as these patients are unlikely to benefit because of their generally grave prognosis. Although routine hepatic biochemical test monitoring is recommended, the cost-effectiveness of this approach has been questioned. The benefit of statins in patients with underlying liver disease who are otherwise important candidates for statin therapy far outweighs the risk of a very rare event of serious liver injury.", 
    "94": "Although the long- and short-term safety of statin therapy is well established, statin intolerance is common in clinical practice. Muscle symptoms are the most common side effect of statin therapy and are potentially the most hazardous and the most likely to reduce patient adherence. Clinicians can establish office protocols/procedures that will reduce the number of patients with statin intolerance. Genomic variations that result in statin-associated myopathy are likely. We await diagnostic and treatment options for this group. Alternative dosing options and the use of alternative statins are useful strategies for those with muscle symptoms. Therapeutic lifestyle changes are critical to achieving maximal risk reduction but remain difficult to implement. Presently available nonstatin lipid-lowering drugs (alone or in combination) do not have the established benefit of statins but do have potential benefit in select patients.", 
    "95": "It is unknown whether statin use improves survival in patients with advanced chronic heart failure (HF) receiving cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT).

In a multivariable analysis controlling for significant baseline characteristics and use of CRT-P/CRT-D, statin use was associated with a 23% relative risk reduction in mortality (HR, 0.77; CI, 0.61-0.97; P=.03). Statin use is associated with improved survival in patients with advanced chronic HF receiving CRT. No survival benefit was seen in patients receiving statins and optimal pharmacologic therapy without CRT.", 
    "96": "Small studies have suggested that honey benefits patients with high cholesterol concentrations. The present study aimed to confirm this finding in a larger group of subjects. Sixty volunteers with high cholesterol, stratified according to gender and hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) treatment (yes/no), were randomized to receive 75 g of honey solution or a honey-comparable sugar solution once daily over a period of 14 days. Baseline measurements, including body mass index (BMI) and lipid profile, were obtained, and subjects also completed dietary questionnaires and the Inventory for the Assessment of Negative Bodily Affect-Trait form (INKA-h) questionnaire. Measurements were repeated 2 weeks later. BMI and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol values were significantly correlated (r = -0.487; P < .001) as were BMI and a lower ratio of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to HDL cholesterol (r = 0.420; P < .001), meaning that subjects with a high BMI had a lower HDL cholesterol value. INKA-h scores and LDL cholesterol values were also significantly correlated (r = 0.273, P = .042). Neither solution influenced significantly cholesterol or triglyceride values in the total group; in women, however, the LDL cholesterol value increased in the sugar solution subgroup but not in the women taking honey. Although ingesting honey did not reduce LDL cholesterol values in general, women may benefit from substituting honey for sugar in their diet. Reducing the BMI lowers the LDL cholesterol value, and psychological interventions also seem important and merit further investigation.", 
    "97": "Statins, the inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, are most frequently used drugs in the prevention of coronary artery disease due to their cholesterol-lowering activity. However, it is not exactly known whether these effects of statins or those independent of cholesterol decrease account for the protection against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. In this study, we investigated the effect of 5-day treatment with simvastatin (10 mg/kg) in Langendorff-perfused hearts of healthy control (C) and diabetic-hypercholesterolemic (D-H; streptozotocin + high fat-cholesterol diet, 5 days) rats subjected to 30-min global ischemia followed by 40-min reperfusion for the examination of postischemic contractile dysfunction and reperfusion-induced ventricular arrhythmias or to 30-min (left anterior descending) coronary artery occlusion and 2-h reperfusion for the infarct size determination (IS; tetrazolium staining). Postischemic recovery of left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) in animals with D-H was improved by simvastatin therapy (62.7+/-18.2 % of preischemic values vs. 30.3+/-5.7 % in the untreated D-H; P<0.05), similar to the values in the simvastatin-treated C group, which were 2.5-fold higher than those in the untreated C group. No ventricular fibrillation occurred in the simvastatin-treated C and D-H animals during reperfusion. Likewise, simvastatin shortened the duration of ventricular tachycardia (10.2+/-8.1 s and 57.8+/-29.3 s in C and D-H vs. 143.6+/-28.6 s and 159.3+/-44.3 s in untreated C and D-H, respectively, both P<0.05). The decreased arrhythmogenesis in the simvastatin-treated groups correlated with the limitation of IS (in % of risk area) by 66 % and 62 % in C and D-H groups, respectively. However, simvastatin treatment decreased plasma cholesterol levels neither in the D-H animals nor in C. The results indicate that other effects of statins (independent of cholesterol lowering) are involved in the improvement of contractile recovery and attenuation of lethal I/R injury in both, healthy and diseased individuals.", 
    "98": "The synergistic actions of atorvastatin (ATST) with gamma-tocotrienol (gamma-TT) and celecoxib (CXIB) were studied in human colon cancer cell lines HT29 and HCT116. The synergistic inhibition of cell growth by ATST and gamma-TT was demonstrated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and isobologram analysis. delta-TT exhibited a similar inhibitory action when combined with ATST. Mevalonate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate eliminated most of the growth inhibitory effect of ATST, but only marginally decreased that of gamma-TT; whereas farnesyl pyrophosphate and squalene exhibited little effect on the inhibitory action of ATST and gamma-TT, indicating protein geranylgeranylation, but not farnesylation are involved in the inhibition of colon cancer cell growth. Both mevalonate and squalene restored the cellular cholesterol level that was reduced by ATST treatment, but only mevalonate eliminated the cell growth inhibitory effect, suggesting that the cholesterol level in cells does not play an essential role in inhibiting cancer cell growth. Protein level of HMG-CoA reductase increased after ATST treatment, and the presence of gamma-TT attenuated the elevated level of HMG-CoA reductase. ATST also decreased membrane-bound RhoA, possibly due to a reduced level of protein geranylgeranylation; addition of gamma-TT enhanced this effect. The mediation of HMG-CoA reductase and RhoA provides a possible mechanism for the synergistic action of ATST and gamma-TT. The triple combination of ATST, gamma-TT and CXIB showed a synergistic inhibition of cancer cell growth in MTT assays. The synergistic action of these three compounds was also illustrated by their induction of G(0)/G(1) phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.",

The mean and standard deviation of the difference scores in the control group were used to generate Z scores. We used a previously described point system to transform negative Z scores into injury points for each neuropsychometric test. Global performance is presented as average deficit score (sum of injury points divided by the number of completed tests). All patients underwent the procedures with mild sedation. Results were analyzed in 2 ways: group-rate and event-rate analysis. Outcome was dichotomized by defining moderate to severe CD as average deficit score at least 1.5 standard deviations worse than the control group. Fisher tests and multivariate logistic regression models were used to analyze group performance.",

One day after surgery, 41% of patients (10 of 24) treated with CAS developed moderate to severe CD (P = 0.0422). Average deficit score was also significantly higher in the CAS group at 1 day (P = 0.0265). These differences were independent of age and history of stroke/transient ischemic attack. Interestingly, we found that the absence of oral statin medication may increase the probability of CD. By 1 month, 9% of patients (1 of 11) treated with CAS presented with CD. Other patients were lost to follow-up.",

HAART-associated dyslipidaemia features fundamental proatherogenic changes such as increased plasma triglycerides (TGs), increased total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as well as decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). The current guidelines for managing HIV-associated dyslipidaemia recommend diet and exercise counselling, alteration of HAART regimen or addition of lipid-lowering medications such as statins, fibrates and omega-3 (OM-3) fatty acids. Given that cardiovascular risk significantly increases with elevated lipid levels, selecting a drug to manage dyslipidaemia is particularly important. A case is described of an HIV patient who had severe hypertriglyceridaemia and bad metabolic parameters treated with rosuvastatin and OM-3 fatty acids. So we obtained a more marked reduction of TG levels than has never been described before in the literature, associated with a significant increase in HDL-C levels.",

Diabetes predisposes to multiple microvascular and macrovascular complications, including cardiovascular disease, the number 1 cause of mortality in the United States. The third report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel in 2001 identified diabetes as a coronary heart disease (CHD) risk equivalent, in light of the evidence that CHD risk in persons with diabetes is similar to that of nondiabetic persons with established CHD. Diabetic dyslipidemia is characterized by a constellation of lipid derangements-hypertriglyceridemia, a low concentration of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and a high concentration of small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles-that accelerate the progression of atherosclerotic disease and the development of atherothrombotic events.", 
    "108": "Statin trials have demonstrated significant reductions in morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular diseases, including in patients with diabetes. Nevertheless, many patients who achieve their LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) goal still have residual CHD risk. Diabetic dyslipidemia contributes to this residual risk because of the increased concentration of atherogenic apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins that can persist despite normalized LDL-C levels and low HDL-C levels. Recent clinical trials emphasize the importance of intensive lipid lowering to achieve recommended goals for LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and apolipoprotein B.",

Human articular osteoarthritic chondrocytes were cultured in the presence and absence of atorvastatin (10 and 50 micromol/L) for 24 h. Metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13), collagen type II (COL2A1), and aggrecan (AGC) mRNA expression levels were evaluated by real-time PCR, and protein expression levels by Western blot analysis. IL-1beta levels in culture medium was analyzed with ELISA. The effect of the treatment with the mevalonate isoprenoid derivatives farnesol and geranylgeraniol, or the cholesterol precursor squalene, was evaluated in the atorvastatin osteoarthritic chondrocyte cultures. Incubation of osteoarthritic chondrocyte cultures with atorvastatin produced a significant dose-dependent reduction in IL-1beta production. Atorvastatin supplementation in cultures produced a decrease in MMP-13 mRNA and protein expression levels, which was reversed by the addition of farnesol. Regarding AGC and COL2A1 mRNA expression, a significant increase was observed only in chondrocytes cultures treated with 50 micromol/L atorvastatin. Our findings suggest that atorvastatin may have potential chondroprotective effects mostly by reducing cartilage degradation.",

When applied to a complex chemogenomic assay, Bar-seq quantitatively identifies drug targets, with performance superior to the benchmark microarray assay. We also show that Bar-seq is well-suited for a multiplex format. We completely re-sequenced and re-annotated the yeast deletion collection using deep sequencing, found that approximately 20% of the barcodes and common priming sequences varied from expectation, and used this revised list of barcode sequences to improve data quality.

The animals were allocated to H. pylori + N-methyl-N-nitrosourea administration (gerbils, 52 weeks) or H. pylori infection alone groups (gerbils and mice, 12 weeks). After H. pylori infection, they were fed basal diets containing 0 to 10 ppm of pitavastatin. The incidences of H. pylori-associated gastric adenocarcinomas and degrees of chronic gastritis were not decreased by pitavastatin compared with those of control values. Expression of interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNAs in the pyloric mucosa was markedly up-regulated in pitavastatin-treated animals. Furthermore, in the H. pylori-infected groups, serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein levels were significantly increased by pitavastatin treatment, contrary to expectation. In the short-term study, H. pylori-infected gerbils and mice also showed significant up-regulation of serum triglyceride levels by pitavastatin, whereas total cholesterol was markedly reduced and low-density lipoprotein exhibited a tendency for decrease in noninfected animals. These findings indicate pitavastatin to be ineffective for suppressing gastritis and chemoprevention of gastric carcinogenesis in H. pylori-infected gerbils. Our serologic results also suggest that the H. pylori infection and consequent severe chronic gastritis interfere with the cholesterol-lowering effects of pitavastatin.", 
    "112": "134 fungal cultures isolated from different soil samples were screened for lovastatin production. Of these, 38 isolates produced different levels of lovastatin. An Aspergillus terreus strain GD13, producing 190 mg/l of lovastatin was selected and subjected to a rational mutation-selection programme based on the resistance to lovastatin and fatty acid synthase (FAS) inhibitors, viz., iodoacetamide and N-ethylmaleimide. After three cycles of mutagenesis, a hyper-producing mutant (EM19) exhibiting 7.5-fold (1424 mg/l) higher levels of lovastatin when compared to wild type parent strain was obtained.", 
    "113": "Several trials have demonstrated beneficial effects of statins in some biological activities that go beyond lipid lowering, suggesting that statins might have other therapeutic benefits. However, it remains to be determined whether statin use is correlated with upper gastrointestinal diseases.

    "117": "Statins, hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, are the most effective medication for lowering cholesterol, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. On the basis of our previous in vitro experimental results on an anaplastic thyroid cancer cell line, we designed a nude mouse model in which cancer cells were seeded subcutaneously to examine the potential anticancer effects of lovastatin in vivo. As expected, tumor growth was significantly reduced in the mice treated with 5 or 10 mg/kg/day of lovastatin compared with the positive control group. However, the tumor grew much faster in the mice treated with 1 mg/kg/day of lovastatin than in the positive control group. We suspect this result might be related to vascular endothelial growth factor. In this model, we found that lovastatin inhibits tumor growth at a high dosage (5 or 10 mg/kg/day), suggesting it could be used as an effectively adjuvant chemotherapy for cancer. However, it also promotes tumor growth at a low dosage (1 mg/kg/day). This duality effect should be further studied for patients treated with various dosages of statins.", 
    "118": "A novel solid-state fermentation (SSF) process, using high-density polyurethane foam (PUF) as an inert support, was developed for the production of lovastatin. Results indicated that forced aeration is not conducive to metabolite production since it reduces the solid medium's moisture content. The highest level of production was achieved in closed flasks (CF), in which 7.5 mg of lovastatin was generated per gram of dry culture, equivalent to 493 mug/mg dry mycelium. However, since mycelial growth is aeration-dependent, the CF cultures presented the lowest level of growth: 15.19 mg/gdc (milligrams per gram of dry culture). It was possible to increase the biomass concentration to 24.4 mg/gdc by increasing the culture medium concentration to 2.5x and the initial moisture content of the solid medium to 85%. Results also revealed that the density of the culture support is a key parameter in determining lovastatin production; high yields were only obtained on PUF at a density of 17 or 20 kg/m(3). SSF using the latter reached a lovastatin level of 19.95 mg/gdc, with specific production of 815 mug/mg dry mycelium. A comparative study showed that lovastatin production during PUF SSF was two-fold higher than that of the better-known system of bagasse SSF. Moreover, lovastatin yields on PUF were 30 times higher than those of liquid submerged fermentation (SmF; 0.57 mg/ml) and lovastatin biomass was almost 15 times more productive.",

Total expenses of statins increased during the same period from LTL6.186 million in 2005 to LTL12.418 million in 2007. Approximately 68 percent of the estimated costs for statins in 2007 were for atorvastatin. Provided that the calculated reference prices were fixed, the estimated savings would amount to a minimum of LTL1.371 million per year and could reach yearly savings in the order of LTL3.163 million. The total expenses would drop by at least 11 percent, and the decrease in costs could be as high as 25 percent (1 euro = LTL3.4528).",

Deaths occurred in 3 of 121 patients (2%) on statins and in 9 of 88 patients (10%) not on statins (P = .017). Stepwise Cox regression analysis showed that significant independent prognostic factors for appropriate shocks were use of statins (risk ratio = 0.46), smoking (risk ratio = 3.5), and diabetes (risk ratio = 0.34). Significant independent prognostic factors for the time to mortality were use of statins (risk ratio = 0.05), use of digoxin (risk ratio = 4.2), systemic hypertension (risk ratio = 14.2), diabetes (risk ratio = 4.3), and left ventricular ejection fraction (risk ratio = 1.1).",

However, the need to measure CRP in making this treatment decision has not been evaluated. Using data from 887 older US men and women (men > or =50 years old, women > or =60 years old) not currently on or recommended statin therapy participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003 to 2006, we determined the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of patient characteristics in identifying the presence of CRP > or =2 mg/L. If CRP > or =2 mg/L were included as an indication for statin therapy, then 90% of older US adults would be recommended treatment. Patients with CRP > or =2 mg/L were more likely (p <0.05) to be current smokers, obese, and have chronic kidney disease. However, characteristics (including demographics, cigarette smoking, obesity, chronic kidney disease, and metabolic syndrome) had low positive predictive values (<70%) for identifying patients with CRP > or =2 mg/L and negative predictive values (<60%) for those with CRP <2 mg/L. In conclusion, these findings suggest patient characteristics cannot be easily used to identify patients with CRP > or =2 mg/L. Given the demonstrated benefits of statin therapy, cost of measuring CRP, and large percentage of older US adults with high CRP, universal statin therapy for older US adults warrants investigation.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel statin/caffeine combination against H5N1, H3N2 and H1N1 virus infection in a murine model. In H5N1-, H3N2- and H1N1-infected BALB/c mice, 50mug statin/200mug caffeine effectively ameliorated lung damage and inhibited viral replication and was at least as effective as oseltamivir and ribavirin. The statin/caffeine combination also appeared to be more effective when administered preventatively rather than as treatment. These findings provide justification for further research into this novel antiviral formulation.", 
    "139": "Statins, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, have been shown to induce both angiogenic and angiostatic responses. We attempted to resolve this controversy by studying the effects of two different statins, rosuvastatin and simvastatin, in two different assay systems. In the matrigel angiogenesis assay, both statins enhanced tube formation by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs, p<0.01 vs. control). In the ex vivo mouse aortic ring sprouting assay, both statins virtually abolished new vessel formation (p<0.01). As a basic difference between the two models of angiogenesis is dispersed state of endothelial cells vs. compact monolayer, we analyzed influence of statins on endothelial junction proteins. RT-PCR analysis and cytoimmunostaining of HUVECs treated with simvastatin revealed increased expression of VE-cadherin (p<0.05). The blockade of VE-cadherin with a specific antibody reversed simvastatin-induced tube formation (p<0.002). These data suggest that statins through VE-cadherin stimulation modulate cell-cell adhesion and diminish the ability of cells to proliferate and migrate. The observations of reduced angiogenesis in the intact vessel may relate to anti-atherosclerotic and anti-cancer effects of statins, and provide a feasible explanation for conflicting data under different experimental conditions.", 
    "140": "Methods were developed for the preparation and isolation of four oxidative degradation products of atorvastatin. ATV-FX1 was prepared in the alkaline acetonitrile solution of atorvastatin with the addition of hydrogen peroxide. The exposition of aqueous acetonitrile solution of atorvastatin to sunlight for several hours followed by the alkalization of the solution with potassium hydroxide to pH 8-9 gave ATV-FXA. By the acidification of the solution with phosphoric acid to pH 3 ATV-FXA1 and FXA2 were prepared. The isolation of oxidative degradation products was carried out on a reversed-phase chromatographic column Luna prep C18(2) 10 microm applying several separation steps. The liquid chromatography coupled with a mass spectrometer (LC-MS), high resolution MS (HR-MS), 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy methods were applied for the structure elucidation. All degradants are due to the oxidation of the pyrrole ring. The most probable reaction mechanism is intermediate endoperoxide formation with subsequent rearrangement and nucleophilic attack by the 5-hydroxy group of the heptanoic fragment. ATV-FX1 is 4-[1b-(4-Fluoro-phenyl)-6-hydroxy-6-isopropyl-1a-phenyl-6a-phenylcarbamoyl-hexahydro-1,2-dioxa-5a-aza-cyclopropa[a]inden-3-yl]-3-(R)-hydroxy-butyric acid and has a molecular mass increased by two oxygen atoms with regard to atorvastatin.

The study included all subjects who (a) filled a statin prescription within selected community pharmacies between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2005; (b) had no record of statin prescriptions during the year prior to the first statin prescription, according to the records of the Saskatchewan Drug Plan and Extended Benefits; and (c) demonstrated active utilization in the drug plan database for at least 1 year after the first statin prescription. The proxy criterion for activity was any dispensing record for statin or nonstatin medications at least 1 year following the index claim. Statin adherence level was estimated as tablets per day, defined as the total number of tablets dispensed divided by the total number of days of observation. Each subject's observation period began on the index date and ended on the earlier of (a) 30 days after the last recorded fill for any type of prescription medication (statin or nonstatin), or (b) December 31, 2005.

Additional adherence calculations were performed for each of 3 time periods, beginning on the index date and ending on days 365, 729, and 1094 (i.e., 1, 2, and 3 years). Patients were included in the analysis for each time period if they met a proxy criterion for availability for observation, defined as the dispensing of any drug at least 1 day after the end date of each period. Pearson chi square tests were used to assess the significance of differences in baseline characteristics and adherence proportions, comparing pharmacy categories. Logistic regression analysis estimated the odds of an adherence level of at least 80% during the individual observation period, adjusting for pharmacy category, sex, age 65 years or older, known low-income drug coverage, number of distinct drug classes filled concurrently during the first year of observation, loyalty to index pharmacy, and length of observation.

In the present study, the effects of atorvastatin on TM expression in the aorta of cholesterol-fed rabbits and in TNFalpha-treated human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were investigated. When rabbits were fed a 0.5% cholesterol diet with and without supplementation with atorvastatin for 9 weeks, the neointimal area in the thoracic aorta of the atorvastatin-treated group was significantly reduced and there was significant induction of TM protein expression. In HAECs, TNFalpha treatment decreased the expression of TM in a time- and dose-dependent manner and atorvastatin pretreatment upregulated the expression of TM mRNA and protein in HAECs with or without TNFalpha treatment. Atorvastatin also inhibited monocyte adhesion to control and TNFalpha-treated HAECs via TM expression. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was significantly reduced by 24 h pretreatment with atorvastatin, whereas TNFalpha increased the phosphorylation of the MAPKs, p38, JNK, and ERK1/2. Blocking the transcriptional activation of NF-kappaB and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB p65 prevented the TNFalpha-induced downregulation of TM. Atorvastatin regulated TM expression in control and TNFalpha-treated HAECs by inhibiting the activation of ERK and NF-kappaB. The increase in endothelial TM activity in response to atorvastatin constitutes an important pleiotropic effect of this commonly used compound and may be of clinical significance in cardiovascular disorders in which deficient endothelial TM plays a pathophysiological role.",

CRP values were dichotomized as <7 or \u22657 mg/L. The full range of CRP values was used to detect a possible level-risk relationship. We studied the relation between CRP values and poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale score >2) or death at 3 months. A multiple logistic regression model was applied to adjust for age, sex, NIHSS score, current cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, statin use, and stroke subtype. After adjustment for potential confounders, patients with CRP levels \u22657 mg/L had a significantly increased risk of poor outcome (adjusted OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1\u20132.4) or death (adjusted OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.0\u20132.9) at 3 months. In addition, the risk of poor outcome or death at 3 months increased with higher levels of CRP. CRP within 12 h of ischemic stroke is an independent prognostic factor of poor outcome at 3 months.",

Thirty of the 33 patients (90.9%) completed at least 11 of 12 doses. Two patients at the 6-mg/kg dose level experienced transient mild elevations in transaminases without clinical sequelae. After an initial dose reduction, the dose was re-escalated to 8 mg/kg, and no further patients reached safety outcomes.

We retrospectively assessed the long-term efficacy of combination therapy with pravastatin (10 mg/day) and enalapril (5 mg/day) in addition to antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) for maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with AF. This study included 319 patients (221 men, 98 women, mean age, 68+/-10 years, mean follow-up period, 50+/-34 months) who were divided into 4 groups: group I (n=191) without combination therapy--namely pravastatin(-) and enalapril(-); group II (n=81) with combination therapy--pravastatin (-) and enalapril (+) (n=81); group III (n=29) with combination therapy--pravastatin (+) and enalapril (-); and group IV (n=18) with combination therapy--pravastatin (+) and enalapril (+). The percentages of patients free from conversion to permanent AF at 12, 36, 60, 90, and 120 months were as follows: group I 88, 83, 78, 75, and 73%, respectively; group II 96, 88, 79, 77, and 75%, respectively; group III 100, 97, 91, 91, and 86%, respectively; group IV 100, 100, 100, 94, and 94%, respectively. The actuarial rate free from conversion to permanent AF at 120 months was significantly higher in group IV than in group I (P<0.05). The results suggest that in patients with paroxysmal AF, the addition of both pravastatin and enalapril to AAD was more effective for maintaining sinus rhythm in terms of an upstream therapy.", 
    "165": "The introduction of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors, i.e., statins, constitutes a milestone in the prevention of cardio- and cerebrovascular disease. The effects of statins extend far beyond their effects on cholesterol levels: pleiotropic effects include vasoprotective mechanisms, comprising improved endothelial function, increased bioavailability of nitric oxide, immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory properties, stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques, as well as antioxidant and stem cell-regulating capacities. Large clinical trials have clearly demonstrated that statins reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. Recent experimental and clinical data have demonstrated that in addition to risk reduction, statins may also improve outcome after stroke and myocardial infarction, even when statins were administered after the event. Moreover, abrupt discontinuation of statin therapy after acute cardio- or cerebrovascular events may impair vascular function and increase morbidity and mortality. Beyond stroke, statin treatment also has been shown to provide protective effects in critically ill patients, e.g., after major surgery, sepsis, or in patients at high-vascular risk. However, although large randomized controlled trials are missing, ongoing trials will clarify the impact of acute statin treatment in these conditions. Although evidence is presently limited, acute statin therapy is emerging as a new therapeutic avenue for the treatment of the critically ill. Until now, statins were only available as oral drugs. An IV formulation may be warranted for acute treatment of severely ill patients, for example, those who are unable to swallow or scheduled for surgery. Hydrophilic statins would be suitable for an IV formulation and have been safely tested in healthy volunteers.",

The clinician should suspect a toxic myopathy when a patient without a pre-existing muscle disease develops myalgia, fatigue, weakness or myoglobinuria, temporally connected to the administration of a drug or exposure to a myotoxic substance. This review provides an update on the drugs with well-documented myocytoxicity and cautions the clinicians to be alert for the potential toxicity of newly marketed drugs; highlights the clinical features and pathomechanisms of the induced muscle disease; and offers guidance on how best to treat and distinguish toxic myopathies from other acquired or hereditary muscle disorders.

Of these, 30 papers met the inclusion criteria for the review, describing 28 trials. The Bayesian mixed treatment meta-analysis demonstrated a clear dose-response relationship in terms of reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), with rosuvastatin 40 mg/day achieving the greatest percentage reduction (56%) from baseline, followed by atorvastatin 80 mg/day (52%), simvastatin 80 mg/day (45%) and simvastatin 40 mg/day (37%). Although serious adverse events with statins are rare, their incidence is likely to be greater with higher doses. Several clinical scenarios were used to explore the effect of adherence on the cost-effectiveness of the treatment regimens. Using a threshold of 20,000 pounds per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and assuming that the benefits and adherence rates observed in the clinical trials are generalisable to a clinical setting and that individuals who do not tolerate the higher-dose statins are prescribed simvastatin 40 mg/day, then simvastatin 80 mg/day, atorvastatin 80 mg/day and rosuvastatin 40 mg/day would be considered cost-effective compared with simvastatin 40 mg/day in individuals with ACS. Simvastatin 80 mg/day is not well tolerated because of the high incidence rates of less severe adverse events such as myopathy (26-fold higher than rates in those receiving simvastatin 20 mg/day), which are likely to affect adherence levels in clinical practice. The reference case shows that rosuvastatin is the optimal treatment for individuals with a recent history of ACS using a threshold of 20,000 pounds per QALY. However, this is based on the assumption that the additional incremental reductions in LDL-c observed in patients treated with rosuvastatin 40 mg/day compared with atorvastatin will transfer into corresponding changes in relative risks of cardiovascular events.",

Previous data suggested that lowering cholesterol concentrations in individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease improved clinical outcomes. Xuezhikang, a partial extract of red yeast rice containing statin, has a marked impact on lipids. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to evaluate the impact of Xuezhikang on reducing cardiovascular events and mortality in elderly Chinese hypertensive patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) enrolled in the Chinese Coronary Secondary Prevention Study. In this randomized trial, 1530 elderly hypertensive patients (> or = 65-years-old) with previous MI were assigned either to placebo (n = 758) or to Xuezhikang (n = 772) daily for an average of 4.5 years. The primary endpoint was recurrent coronary events; the secondary endpoint was all-cause mortality and other clinical events, including adverse effects. There were 68 cases of coronary events (8.8%) detected in the Xuezhikang group and 108 cases (14.3%) in the placebo group (38.2% risk reduction by Xuezhikang therapy). Death from coronary heart disease (CHD) totaled 49 cases in the Xuezhikang group (6.4%) and 68 cases in the placebo group (9.0%), indicating that Xuezhikang significantly decreased the risk of CHD death by 29.2%. Our study demonstrated that Xuezhikang therapy could effectively and safely reduce cardiovascular events and all-cause death in Chinese elderly hypertensive patients with previous MI. This finding may have an important implication for the treatment of elderly hypertensive patients with CHD.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of pravastatin, simvastatin and lovastatin on the osteoblastic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in vitro. Cell number, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, matrix mineralization and gene expression pattern were determined. Pravastatin did not affect cell differentiation. Simvastatin and lovastatin enhanced bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) mRNA levels. In contrast, ALP activity and mRNA levels were suppressed by statins, as well as the DNA content and cell activity (MTT). An increase in apoptotic events was observed at high concentrations of statins, along with high Ca-45 incorporation. Lower concentrations of statins did not increase apoptotic staining, but also failed to induce calcification. When statin-induced calcification did occur, the morphology of the deposits was very different from the conventional nodule formation; the calcium was laid down along the membranes of the rounded cells suggesting it was as a result of cell death. Our results indicate that statins are not able to differentiate human MSCs into osteoblasts and that high concentrations of statins (>1 microM) have a cytotoxic effect.", 
    "189": "Atherosclerosis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Statins are established as first choice drugs for the management of hyperlipidaemia and cardiovascular risk. However, a residual cardiovascular risk, partially attributable to lipids, remains even after statin treatment. This risk appears to be associated with both high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride lipid fractions. Several novel therapeutic approaches have been proposed to reduce lipid levels. Microsomal transfer protein (MTP) is involved in the assembly of very-low-density lipoprotein and chylomicron lipoprotein particles in the liver and the gut, respectively. In the preclinical setting, various agents that affect activity of MTP have shown that inhibition can result in profound reductions in blood triglycerides and cholesterol. Similarly, evidence of efficacy using the target has been confirmed in man with small molecule inhibitors and antisense oligonucleotides. Unfortunately, despite their efficacy in reducing lipids, the clinical utility of small molecule inhibitors has been restricted by their potential to induce hepatic steatosis. Continuing attempts to utilise this clinical target (to decrease cholesterol, triglycerides and weight) have involved the use of lower doses or non systemically absorbed MTP inhibitors.",

The reasons for this and previous negative findings are discussed. In contrast, there is evidence that statins exert a nephroprotective action in less advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). There is need for further trials to establish if patients at various stages of CKD will benefit from statin treatment in terms of both nephroprotection and reduction in vascular events.",

The assay was used to determine the extent of phosphopantetheinylation of ACP domains of the erythromycin precursor polyketide synthase, 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS), expressed in a heterologous Escherichia coli polyketide production strain. The data showed that greater than 99.9% of DEBS is phosphopantetheinylated. The assay was also used to interrogate the extent of phosphopantetheinylation of the lovastatin nonaketide synthase (LNKS) heterologously expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The data showed that LNKS was efficiently phosphopantetheinylated in S. cerevisiae and that lack of production of the lovastatin precursor polyketide was not due to insufficient phosphopantetheinylation of the expressed synthase.",

Mevalonate (200 microM) reversed the inhibition of ox-PAPC-stimulated mRNA and protein levels by lovastatin, indicating the inhibitory effect of lovastatin was due to inhibition of mevalonate synthesis. Addition of the geranylgeraniol (GGOL, 10 microM) but not farnesol (FOL, 10 microM), reversed the inhibitory effect of lovastatin on interleukin-8 mRNA and protein levels stimulated by ox-PAPC, indicating that lovastatin exerted its effect by inhibiting stores of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) which are necessary for geranylgeranylation of proteins.

    "211": "Fluvastatin, but not atorvastatin or simvastatin, inhibited MDC expression induced by interferon (IFN)-gamma and NF-kappaB activation. A NF-kappaB inhibitor, but not a STAT1 inhibitor, suppressed MDC expression in HaCaT cells. Further, inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) significantly suppressed IFN-gamma-induced MDC expression and NF-kappaB activation. Interestingly, fluvastatin suppressed IFN-gamma-induced NF-kappaB activation in parallel with p38 MAPK phosphorylation.", 
    "212": "These results indicate that fluvastatin inhibited expression of the CC chemokine MDC induced by IFN-gamma in HaCaT cells, by inhibiting NF-kappaB activation via the p38 MAPK pathway. This blockade of a Th2 chemokine by fluvastatin may suppress the infiltration of Th2 cells into skin lesions and lessen the skin inflammation seen in atopic dermatitis, suggesting a potential therapeutic use of fluvastatin for this condition.", 
    "213": "To present information about cardiac syndrome X (CSX) including its (a) definition, (b) etiology and pathology, (c) epidemiology, (d) symptomatology, (e) diagnosis, (f) treatment, and (g) prognosis. Clinical recommendations will also be presented.", 
    "214": "Articles used in this review were found by searching CINAHL, Medline, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science (ISI), Academic Search Premier, and Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition.", 
    "215": "The causes of CSX remain unknown; however, CSX is easy to diagnose and can be treated. Medication therapy and risk factor modification can greatly improve the quality of life by decreasing pain occurrence and lessening pain intensity.", 
    "216": "Too often, providers reassure patients of a healthy heart because of normal coronary arteries despite persistent chest pain and ST segment changes on the electrocardiogram. Chest pain, one of the primary signs and symptoms of CSX, can be reduced through common medications and interventions if the diagnosis of CSX is initiated.", 
    "217": "The statins are a group of inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase that are used extensively in medical practice because of their ability to reduce cardiovascular mortality and stroke. Although this protective activity was initially ascribed to the inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver, clinical trials and basic research studies indicate that, beyond their cholesterol-lowering activity, statins might affect the function of different cell types in extrahepatic tissues. Here we will review the different mechanisms by which the statins exert their immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory functions. We propose that statin pleiotropism is a key to the explanation of these activities, as it enables statins to act cooperatively in various steps of the inflammatory reaction, including terminal differentiation of immune cells, endothelial cell function, and regulation of the molecules that steer these cells to the sites at which they exert their immunomodulatory activity.", 
    "218": "The aim of our investigation was to assess the influence of rosuvastatin therapy and myocardial revascularization on angiogenic growth factors in coronary artery disease patients.", 
    "219": "Two main groups were examined: group one consisted of patients with successful percutaneous coronary intervention and group two consisted of patients 3 months on rosuvastatin therapy.Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptor Flt-1 (sVEGF-R1) and transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta1) levels were measured in healthy volunteers and CAD patients before and 6 days after myocardial revascularization.VEGF and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) levels were measured before and 3 months after rosuvastatin therapy, as well as total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and endothelium-dependent vasodilation. VEGF levels did not differ, but beta-TGF levels were significantly lower in CAD patients in comparison with healthy subjects, P < 0.0001. Myocardial revascularization caused changes of VEGF levels from 192.4 +/- 166.1 pg/ml to 264.7 +/- 226.6 pg/ml (P = 0.0066). There were positive changes in lipid levels, lowering of CRP and IL-6 concentrations, improving of endothelial function and decreasing of VEGF levels from 382 +/- 249 pg/ml to 297 +/- 220 pg/ml (P = 0.006) 3 months after rosuvastatin treatment.", 
    "220": "There is an elevation of VEGF levels early after myocardial revascularization that may reflect a transient ischaemia and potentially may provoke atherosclerotic plaque neovascularization. Rosuvastatin leads to a decrease of VEGF levels that can be a reflection of the influence on endogenous angiogenesis. There was no correlation between inflammatory factors and VEGF that gives a suggestion about an absence of direct CRP and IL-6 impact on VEGF decreasing during statin treatment."
