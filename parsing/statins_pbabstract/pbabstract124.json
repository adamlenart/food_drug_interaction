Therapies that can halt the progression of CKD are limited, and the identification of new strategies for CKD treatment is therefore important. Pitavastatin, one of the newest statins introduced to the market, has been shown to exhibit some beneficial effects on renal and endothelial function.", 
    "1": "We enrolled 12 healthy volunteers for our study. With or without pitavastatin administration, creatinine clearance (Ccr), urinary albumin excretion, lipid status, and oxidative stress markers were evaluated in acute and early phases after administration of the drug.", 
    "2": "A single pitavastatin administration increased Ccr and reduced oxidative stress parameters, such as 8-OHdG levels and isoprostane production, within 6 h, without altering lipid status in healthy participants. A two-week treatment with pitavastatin lowered total and LDL cholesterol and triglycerides but not HDL cholesterol at 7 and 14 days. This change in lipid profile is associated with enhanced Ccr and the suppression of oxidative stress parameters. Urinary albumin excretion was reduced after either acute or chronic administration of pitavastatin, although this effect was not yet significant.", 
    "3": "We found that pitavastatin augmented Ccr and reduced oxidative stress parameters in healthy subjects. These data suggest that pitavastatin affects renal outcomes in both lipid status-dependent and -independent manners. These observations suggest that pitavastatin treatment could be beneficial for CKD patients.",

A subset of these patients is classified as having autoimmune urticaria defined by the presence of a functional IgG antibody to the \u03b1 subunit of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRIa) or to IgE. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the drug atorvastatin in patients with chronic urticaria compared to the placebo.In this single-blind study, 50 patients suffering from chronic urticaria (15-45 years old) were selected and divided into two groups by simple randomization method. The first group was treated with atorvastatin and antihistamines and the second group (control group) was treated with placebo and antihistamines for 3 months. Urticaria severity was measured by score index, before and after the treatment course: ASST (autologous serum skin test) was performed for all patients and sera were collected to measure cytokines. In cases, IL-5 decreased and IL-10 increased after treatment compared to the time point before treatment (p<0.05). All patients with severe utricaria according our scoring, had positive ASST.The patients with severe urticaria identified by urticaria score and ASST positivity had chronic idiopathic urticaria. By prescribing the atorvastatin plus antihistamines in severe and resistant forms of urticaria, the use of more toxic medications like cytotoxic drugs may be avoided.",

The incidence of bladder carcinoma was: control 0/8 (0%); Atorva 0/8 (0%); BBN 13/20 (65%) and Atorva + BBN 1/8 (12.5%). The number and volume of tumors were significantly lower in the Atorva + BBN group, with a marked reduction in hyperplasia, dysplasia and carcinoma in situ lesions. An anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant profile was also observed in the preventive Atorva group. p53 and ki67 immunostaining were significantly increased in the BBN-treated rats, which was prevented in the Atorva + BBN group.

We now report that the harm caused by torcetrapib was confined to those in the 10 mg atorvastatin subgroup for both ACM [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.68, 95% CI (1.58, 4.54), P < 0.0001] and MCVEs [HR = 1.41, 95% CI (1.14, 1.74), P = 0.002], with no evidence of harm when torcetrapib was coadministered with higher doses of atorvastatin. In the atorvastatin 10 mg subgroup, age, prior heart failure and stroke were significantly associated with ACM, independent of torcetrapib treatment, whereas low apoA-I, smoking, hypertension, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke were independently associated with MCVEs. After adjusting for these factors, the HR associated with torcetrapib treatment in the 10 mg atorvastatin subgroup remained elevated for both ACM [HR = 2.67, 95% CI (1.57, 4.54), P < 0.001] and MCVE [HR = 1.36, 95% CI (1.10, 1.69), P = 0.005]. Thus, the harm caused by torcetrapib was confined to individuals taking atorvastatin 10 mg. The harm could not be explained by torcetrapib-induced changes in lipid levels, blood pressure, or electrolytes. It is conceivable that higher doses of atorvastatin protected against the harm caused by torcetrapib.", 
    "47": "In the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, excess energy intake on the background of genetic predisposition and lifestyle factors leads to the dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism and acquired insulin resistance. These initial metabolic defects are reflected to both lipoprotein and glucose metabolism and contribute to increased risk for cardiovascular disease. However, even after controlling for the traditional cardiovascular risk factors, subjects with the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes remain at high residual cardiovascular risk despite of low/normal LDL-cholesterol concentration. For 2 decades, statin therapy has been the cornerstone of treatment of dyslipidemia in these disorders. In the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, only statin treatment has demonstrated consistently a significant reduction in cardiovascular and all cause mortality in clinical trials. Lately, increased incidence of diabetes especially in the high-risk populations using statins has raised the debate whether statins are indicated for primary prevention especially in the metabolic syndrome. Guidelines recommend intensified lifestyle intervention to those in high risk groups on statin therapy to reduce the residual risk. Despite of the proven efficacy on plasma lipids, fibrate, or niacin as monotherapy, or in combination with statins has failed in reducing cardiovascular mortality. This underlies the fact that improvement in dyslipidemia or other biomarkers is not equal to the reduction in cardiovascular events. However, fibrates in combination with statins seem to be beneficial to reduce CVD events in subjects with low HDL-cholesterol (< 0.9-1.1 mmol/L) and elevated triglycerides (> 2.3 mmol/L), but the data are derived from subgroup analysis of clinical trials. The position of niacin and ezetimibe and omega-3 fatty acids in treatment of dyslipidemia in the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes is even less clear and remains to be established in future clinical trials.", 
    "48": "Exposure of erythrocytes to hypotonic lysis creates pores in the cell membrane, through which pravastatin can enter and become trapped, after resealing them with a suitable buffer. We investigated the effects of tonicity, incubation time and drug concentration on drug loading into erythrocytes. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of pravastatin on erythrocyte oxidative stress markers and osmotic fragility behavior. Encapsulation was achieved using buffer solutions of different tonicities (0.5, 0.6 and 0.7% NaCl) and different drug concentrations (2, 4, 8 and 10 mg/mL) for a range of incubation times (15, 30, 60 and 120 min). The results demonstrated that controlled hypotonic lysis could entrap pravastatin in human erythrocytes, with acceptable loading parameters. The highest loading (34%) was achieved at 0.6% NaCl and 10 mg/mL pravastatin for 60 min incubation. At this pravastatin concentration, oxidative stress markers were similar to those seen in controls, and fragility and hematological parameters were unaffected in drug-loaded erythrocytes. These results indicate that the loading process and pravastatin concentration had no deleterious effects on the structure of pravastatin-loaded erythrocytes, suggesting that they may therefore have a similar life span to normal cells. Pravastatin-loaded erythrocytes may thus provide an effective extended-release-delivery system for pravastatin.",

A high number of medications were tested in preclinical models of endometriosis due to their theoretic capacity of disrupting important pathophysiologic pathways of the disease, such as inflammatory response, angiogenesis and cell survival, proliferation, migration, adhesion, and invasion. Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1-blockers, nuclear factor \u03baB inhibitors, antiangiogenic agents, statins, antioxidants, immunomodulators, flavonoids, histone deacetylase inhibitors, matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, metformin, novel modulators of sex steroids expression, and apoptotic agents were all effective in in\u00a0vitro/animal models.

Atorvastatin and simvastatin showed intermediate risks, while pravastatin and lovastatin appeared to have the lowest risk rates. Relative risk of muscle-related AEs, therefore, approximately tracked with per milligram LDL-lowering potency, with fluvastatin an apparent exception. Incorporating all muscle categories, rates for atorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, and lovastatin were, respectively, 55%, 26%, 17%, and 7.5% as high, as rosuvastatin, approximately tracking per milligram potency (Rosuvastatin>Atorvastatin>Simvastatin>Pravastatin \u2248 Lovastatin) and comporting with findings of other studies.

    "81": "The pathways inducing the critical transition from compensated hypertrophy to cardiac dilation and failure remain poorly understood. The goal of our study is to determine the role of Rac-induced signaling in this transition process. Our previous results showed that Thyroxin (T4) treatment resulted in increased myocardial Rac expression in wild-type mice and a higher level of expression in Zea maize RacD (ZmRacD) transgenic mice. Our current results showed that T4 treatment induced physiologic cardiac hypertrophy in wild-type mice, as demonstrated by echocardiography and histopathology analyses. This was associated with significant increases in myocardial Rac-GTP, superoxide and ERK1/2 activities. Conversely, echocardiography and histopathology analyses showed that T4 treatment induced dilated cardiomyopathy along with compensatory cardiac hypertrophy in ZmRacD mice. These were linked with further increases in myocardial Rac-GTP, superoxide and ERK1/2 activities. Additionally, there were significant increases in caspase-8 expression and caspase-3 activity. However, there was a significant decrease in p38-MAPK activity. Interestingly, inhibition of myocardial Rac-GTP activity and superoxide generation with pravastatin and carvedilol, respectively, attenuated all functional, structural, and molecular changes associated with the T4-induced cardiomyopathy in ZmRacD mice except the compensatory cardiac hypertrophy. Taken together, T4-induced ZmRacD is a novel mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy that shares many characteristics with the human disease phenotype. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show graded Rac-mediated O(2)\u00b7(-) results in cardiac phenotype shift in-vivo. Moreover, Rac-mediated O(2)\u00b7(-) generation, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and myocardial fibrosis seem to play a pivotal role in the transition from cardiac hypertrophy to cardiac dilation and failure. Targeting Rac signaling could represent valuable therapeutic strategy not only in saving the failing myocardium but also to prevent this transition process.",

In the present study, the drug-drug interaction potential of multi-dose ATV co-administration with CLZ on both pharmacokinetics and the anti-thrombotic property of CLZ is demonstrated. The pharmacokinetic parameters of CLZ (6 mg/kg, twice daily) were determined in male Wistar rats after 7 days co-administration with ATV (5 mg/kg, once daily) in order to assess the interaction potential between CLZ and ATV on chronic treatment. In vitro metabolic inhibition and everted gut sac studies were conducted to elucidate the mechanism of this interaction. Pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction was evaluated on anti-thrombotic models including time to occlusion, platelet aggregation and rat tail bleeding time. A validated LC-MS/MS method was employed simultaneously to quantify both ATV and CLZ in rat plasma matrix. A statistically significant increase in systemic exposure (Css(max) by ~1.75 fold; AUC by ~3.0 fold) to CLZ was observed in ATV pre-treated rats. In vitro metabolism studies using liver microsomes (RLM and HLM) demonstrated statistically significant inhibition of CLZ metabolism when co-incubated with ATV. No change in apparent permeability of CLZ was observed in the presence of ATV. Atorvastatin showed a significant delay in artery occlusion time without altering CLZ's bleeding time and platelet aggregation profile. Collectively the results of these studies provide metabolic insight into the nature of drug-drug interaction between the selected drugs. Co-administration with ATV influences the pharmacokinetics and anti-thrombotic property of CLZ. A thorough clinical investigation is required before extrapolation of data to humans.",

Similarly, when combining individually ineffective concentrations of atorvastatin or losartan (0.01 and 0.1 \u00b5M, respectively), significantly increased coronary flow and a decreased extent of myocardial injury were observed. By using a nitric oxide-synthase inhibitor, we demonstrated that the vasodilatory effects obtained were nitric oxide-dependent.

Plasma lipids, glucose homoeostasis markers, plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein as well as lymphocyte release of pro-inflammatory cytokines were determined on the allocation day and after 90 days of therapy. Compared with placebo, fenofibrate reduced lymphocyte release of interleukin-2, interferon-\u03b3 and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1, which was accompanied by a reduction in plasma C-reactive protein levels. The results obtained indicate that fenofibrate inhibits lymphocyte secretory function and reduces low-grade inflammation in patients with both impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance.

Simvastatin was injected into the vitreous in the simvastatin intervention group, but not in the diabetic positive control group. Seven days later, after the examination of electroretinogram (ERG), all rats were sacrificed, and their eyeballs were enucleated. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry method were performed to determine the expression of CTGF in the vitreous and retina. Terminal DNA transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method was used to detect apoptosis of retina cells. Concentration of CTGF in the vitreous, retinal expression of CTGF, retinal cellular apoptosis index, ERG-b wave and oscillatory potentials (OPs) of rats in each group were compared using analysis of variance LSD test methods.",

    "101": "We examined the effects of fenofibrate and atorvastatin on very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) apolipoprotein (apo)E metabolism in the metabolic syndrome (MetS). We studied 11 MetS men in a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial. VLDL-apoE kinetics were examined using stable isotope methods and compartmental modeling. Compared with placebo, fenofibrate (200 mg/day) and atorvastatin (40 mg/day) decreased plasma apoE concentrations (P < 0.05). Fenofibrate decreased VLDL-apoE concentration and production rate (PR) and increased VLDL-apoE fractional catabolic rate (FCR) compared with placebo (P < 0.05). Compared with placebo, atorvastatin decreased VLDL-apoE concentration and increased VLDL-apoE FCR (P < 0.05). Fenofibrate and atorvastatin had comparable effects on VLDL-apoE concentration. The increase in VLDL-apoE FCR with fenofibrate was 22% less than that with atorvastatin (P < 0.01). With fenofibrate, the change in VLDL-apoE concentration was positively correlated with change in VLDL-apoB concentration, and negatively correlated with change in VLDL-apoB FCR. In MetS, fenofibrate and atorvastatin decreased plasma apoE concentrations. Fenofibrate decreased VLDL-apoE concentration by lowering VLDL-apoE production and increasing VLDL-apoE catabolism. By contrast, atorvastatin decreased VLDL-apoE concentration chiefly by increasing VLDL-apoE catabolism. Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms of action of two different lipid-lowering therapies on VLDL-apoE metabolism in MetS.", 
    "102": "Atherosclerosis begins in childhood, and these early lesions are related to cardiovascular risk factors, including non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Genetic disorders of lipid metabolism, principally familial hypercholesterolemia, have a high frequency in the population (about 1:300-1:500), and cause cardiovascular morbidity beginning in the third decade of life. The current obesity epidemic in children has worsened cardiovascular risk status. Cardiovascular risk factors present in youth often track into adulthood and are more predictive of future subclinical atherosclerosis than risk factors measured in young adulthood. Further, modification of risk factors beginning in childhood and young adulthood can lead to restoration to normal or improvement in measures of subclinical atherosclerosis measures both in those with genetic dyslipidemias and those with dyslipidemia secondary to obesity. Prior recommended selective lipid screening strategies based on family history or presence of other cardiovascular risk factors have failed to capture many with genetic dyslipidemia. Medium-term clinical trials of statin therapy for inherited dyslipidemias are safe and effective in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Cholesterol screening in childhood is necessary to prevent cardiovascular morbidity in those with genetic dyslipidemias and to increase awareness of the need for behavioral intervention in those with multiple cardiovascular risk factors, often a result of the obesity epidemic.",

This observation has been attributed in part to the palliative effect of statins on cerebral hemodynamics and cerebral autoregulation (CA), which are mediated mainly through the upregulation of endothelium nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Several animal studies indicate that statin pretreatment enhances cerebral blood flow after ischemic stroke, although this finding is not further supported in clinical settings. Cerebral vasomotor reactivity, however, is significantly improved after long-term statin administration in most patients with severe small vessel disease, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, or impaired baseline CA.",

We have validated the uptake of pravastatin with different amounts of hepatocytes and the impact of the oil layer used in separation. The time- and concentration-dependent uptake profiles of several anionic and cationic charged drugs were evaluated. The results with our method compare favourably with the literature for pravastatin, atorvastatin and estrone 3-sulfate. 2.\u2002Two approaches for kinetic determination (temperature difference and fitting the linear and non-saturable passive diffusion rate in the equation, i.e. V = (V(max) \u00d7 S)/(K(m) + S) + P(dif) \u00d7 S) have been evaluated. Kinetic studies indicate that the different approaches for determining passive diffusion can affect K(m) and V(max), but not the clearance of active uptake (V(max)/K(m)). 3.\u2002Using pravastatin as a probe substrate, species differences were observed in the organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 and 1B3 activities. Plasma protein significantly reduced the uptake of atorvastatin, but not pravastatin. 4.\u2002Our data suggests that evaluation of the role of active uptake in hepatic clearance in humans should consider the relative ratio of active uptake to passive diffusion, species differences and plasma protein binding when applying in vitro uptake data.", 
    "105": "Studies in diverse organisms have revealed a surprising depth to the evolutionary conservation of genetic modules. For example, a systematic analysis of such conserved modules has recently shown that genes in yeast that maintain cell walls have been repurposed in vertebrates to regulate vein and artery growth. We reasoned that by analyzing this particular module, we might identify small molecules targeting the yeast pathway that also act as angiogenesis inhibitors suitable for chemotherapy. This insight led to the finding that thiabendazole, an orally available antifungal drug in clinical use for 40 years, also potently inhibits angiogenesis in animal models and in human cells. Moreover, in vivo time-lapse imaging revealed that thiabendazole reversibly disassembles newly established blood vessels, marking it as vascular disrupting agent (VDA) and thus as a potential complementary therapeutic for use in combination with current anti-angiogenic therapies. Importantly, we also show that thiabendazole slows tumor growth and decreases vascular density in preclinical fibrosarcoma xenografts. Thus, an exploration of the evolutionary repurposing of gene networks has led directly to the identification of a potential new therapeutic application for an inexpensive drug that is already approved for clinical use in humans.", 
    "106": "Activation of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) contributes importantly to inflammation and atherogenesis. We previously reported that apolipoprotein CIII (apoCIII), found abundantly on circulating triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, enhances adhesion of human monocytes to ECs in vitro. Statins may exert lipid-independent anti-inflammatory effects. The present study examined whether statins suppress apoCIII-induced EC activation in vitro and in vivo.",

This process mainly depends on vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), as a blocking VCAM-1 antibody abolished apoCIII-induced monocyte adhesion. ApoCIII significantly increased VCAM-1 expression in HSVECs and HCAECs. Pre-treatment with statins suppressed apoCIII-induced VCAM-1 expression and monocyte adhesion, with two lipophilic statins (pitavastatin and atorvastatin) exhibiting inhibitory effects at lower concentration than those of hydrophilic pravastatin. Nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) mediated apoCIII-induced VCAM-1 expression, as demonstrated via loss-of-function experiments, and pitavastatin treatment suppressed NF-\u03baB activation. Furthermore, in the aorta of hypercholesterolaemic Ldlr(-/-) mice, pitavastatin administration in vivo suppressed VCAM-1 mRNA and protein, induced by apoCIII bolus injection. Similarly, in a subcutaneous dorsal air pouch mouse model of leucocyte recruitment, apoCIII injection induced F4/80+ monocyte and macrophage accumulation, whereas pitavastatin administration reduced this effect.",

    "109": "FLT3 is frequently mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but resistance has limited the benefit of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). We demonstrate that statins can impair FLT3 glycosylation, thus leading to loss of surface expression and induction of cell death, as well as mitigation of TKI resistance. Immunofluorescence microscopy confirms a reduction in surface localization and an increase in intracellular FLT3/internal tandem duplication (ITD) accumulation. This aberrant localization was associated with increased STAT5 activation but inhibition of both MAPK and AKT phosphorylation. Growth inhibition studies indicate that FLT3/ITD-expressing cells were killed with an IC(50) within a range of 0.2-2\u03bcM fluvastatin. Several mechanisms of resistance could be circumvented by fluvastatin treatment. An increase in the IC(50) for inhibition of phosphorylated FLT3/ITD by lestaurtinib caused by exogenous FLT3 ligand, resistance to sorafenib caused by the D835Y or FLT3/ITD N676K mutations, and activation of the IL-3 compensatory pathway were all negated by fluvastatin treatment. Finally, fluvastatin treatment in vivo reduced engraftment of BaF3 FLT3/ITD cells in Balb/c mice. These results demonstrate that statins, a class of drugs already approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, might be repurposed for the management of FLT3 mutant acute myeloid leukemia cases either alone or in conjunction with FLT3 TKI.", 
    "110": "Atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease are the leading cause of death worldwide. Atherosclerosis is a complex inflammatory disease that results from lipid accumulation and oxidation in the arterial wall combined with an active inflammatory reaction involving transmigration of monocytes and other inflammatory cells from the blood stream into the vessel wall. Many therapeutic approaches have been tested to treat atherosclerosis and prevent its complications, with statins being the most efficient therapy by reducing the levels of atherogenic lipoproteins and preventing major cardiovascular events. However, the risk of atherothrombotic complications still remains high, causing millions of deaths around the world each year. Extensive research has shed light on the cascade of cellular and molecular events that lead from atherosclerotic plaque formation to its rupture and have highlighted promising new therapeutic targets, each being implicated at different stages of the atherosclerotic plaque formation and progression. In this review, we briefly discuss the potential of high-density lipoprotein-based therapies, given the anti-inflammatory properties of high-density lipoprotein. We then present different approaches that tackle inflammation, including inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase, blockade of P-selectin, use of a viral-derived serpin, and interleukin-1\u03b2 inhibition. All these targets have shown encouraging results in clinical trials and support the idea that targeting inflammation could reduce cardiovascular complications in patients with coronary artery disease.",

FH is the most common and serious monogenic disorder of lipid metabolism that leads to premature coronary heart disease. However, most cases remain undetected or inadequately treated in our community. We provide an overview of FH, with emphasis on evidence for treatment, new models of care (MoCs) and health economic evaluations. Evidence for treatment is based on cohort studies; while this is a low level class of evidence, MoCs concur in recommending early intervention and lowering of plasma low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels by at least 40% with statins. Preliminary health economic evaluations suggest that detecting and treating FH is cost-effective, but further studies based on high-quality international data and standardised costing methods are needed. If the recommendations in the published MoCs are followed, there is likely to be significant improvement in the health and quality of life of patients with FH and their families, as well as major cost savings in healthcare for end-organ damage, including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes and possibly stroke, but this requires to be verified.",

    "128": "One of the most important complications of total joint arthroplasty is failure associated with periprosthetic osteolysis, a process mainly initiated by the biological response to wear-derived products from the biomaterials in service. The inflammatory mediator interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays a key role in the establishment and progression of aseptic loosening. Metal particles specifically up-regulate IL-6 production in bone-forming cells and implant-bone interfacial tissues. The use of statins has been recently associated with a significantly reduced risk of revision in patients that undergo total hip arthroplasty. We hypothesized that simvastatin (Simv) could modulate the osteoblastic response to titanium particles (Ti) by attenuating the production of IL-6. Pre-treatment of human osteoblastic cells with Simv down-regulated Ti particle-induced IL-6 gene expression at mRNA and protein levels. The effect of Simv on Ti-induced IL-6 production in osteoblastic cells could not be explained by inhibition of the internalization of metal particles. The mechanism involved in this down-regulation is based in the inhibition of the HMG-CoA/GGPP/RhoA/ROCK pathway, independently of Simv effects in the cholesterol synthesis. The cytokine-lowering property of Simv has been observed in Saos-2 cells and human primary osteoblasts (hOBs) exposed to Ti particles, and was further enhanced when hOBs were co-cultured with macrophages.",

The present study measured hippocampal sterol levels in a model of unilateral hippocampal injury triggered by focal-onset status epilepticus, and in chronically epileptic mice. Status epilepticus was induced by intra-amygdala microinjection of kainic acid and ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampus analyzed. No significant changes were found for ipsilateral or contralateral hippocampal levels of desmosterol or lathosterol at any time after SE as measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. 24S-hydroxycholesterol and cholesterol levels were unchanged up to 24h after status epilepticus but were decreased in the ipsilateral hippocampus during early epileptogenesis and in chronically epileptic mice. Levels of cholesterol were also reduced in the contralateral hippocampus during epileptogenesis and in chronic epileptic mice. Treatment of mice with the anti-inflammatory cholesterol synthesis inhibitor lovastatin did not alter seizures during status epilepticus or seizure-induced neuronal death.

Small-molecule inhibitors of fascin block tumor metastasis in animal models. Conversely, fascin deficiency might underlie the pathogenesis of some developmental brain disorders. To identify fascin-pathway modulators we devised a cell-based assay for fascin function and used it in a bidirectional drug screen. The screen utilized cultured fascin-deficient mutant Drosophila neurons, whose neurite arbors manifest the 'filagree' phenotype. Taking a repurposing approach, we screened a library of 1040 known compounds, many of them FDA-approved drugs, for filagree modifiers. Based on scaffold distribution, molecular-fingerprint similarities, and chemical-space distribution, this library has high structural diversity, supporting its utility as a screening tool. We identified 34 fascin-pathway blockers (with potential anti-metastasis activity) and 48 fascin-pathway enhancers (with potential cognitive-enhancer activity). The structural diversity of the active compounds suggests multiple molecular targets. Comparisons of active and inactive compounds provided preliminary structure-activity relationship information. The screen also revealed diverse neurotoxic effects of other drugs, notably the 'beads-on-a-string' defect, which is induced solely by statins. Statin-induced neurotoxicity is enhanced by fascin deficiency. In summary, we provide evidence that primary neuron culture using a genetic model organism can be valuable for early-stage drug discovery and developmental neurotoxicity testing. Furthermore, we propose that, given an appropriate assay for target-pathway function, bidirectional screening for brain-development disorders and invasive cancers represents an efficient, multipurpose strategy for drug discovery.",

The new guidelines provide general and specific recommendations as to how family history and additional risk factors and risk conditions should be incorporated in decisions regarding initiation of statin therapy at LDL-cholesterol cutpoints.

Given the continued interest in the relationship between cholesterol, statin use, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD), investigating the role of KIF6 719Arg carrier status in these relationships may be of importance. Data from 86 patients (36 aMCI, 50 AD) with an average age of 76.87 \u00b1 8.22 years were used for this study. Total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglycerides were the outcome variables. 719Arg carriers taking statins had significantly lower TC (p < 0.001) and LDL (p < 0.001) levels than 719Arg carriers not taking statins. In addition, 719Arg carriers not taking statins had significantly higher TC (p = 0.004) and LDL (p < 0.001) than 719Arg non-carriers taking statins. Additional analyses indicated that ApoE \u03b54 carrier status and statin use interaction is also associated with lower TC (p = 0.04), but not LDL (p = 0.06). The interaction between 719Arg and ApoE \u03b54 carrier status on TC and LDL was not significant. This study is the first to demonstrate an association between lower cholesterol levels and statin use among KIF6 719Arg allele carriers with aMCI and AD.

This study investigated the efficacy and safety of a proactive, multifactorial CV risk factor-management strategy based on single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin (SPAA) versus continuing physicians' usual care (UC) over 52 weeks in patients with and without DM. Patients with hypertension and \u2265 3 additional CV risk factors from the Cluster Randomized Usual Care vs Caduet Investigation Assessing Long-Term-Risk (CRUCIAL) trial--an open-label, cluster-randomized trial conducted in 19 countries--were enrolled and randomized to receive proactive intervention (based on SPAA 5/10 to 10/20 mg) or UC (based on investigators' best clinical judgment). Patients were analyzed according to baseline DM status. Six hundred patients had DM. Patients with DM in the SPAA and UC arms had mean ages of 61.8 and 61.5 years, respectively, and an absolute coronary heart disease (CHD) risk of 25.2% and 21.5%, respectively. Among non-DM patients, mean ages were 58.6 and 59.5 years, respectively, and CHD risk was 16.0% vs 15.7%, respectively. Least-squares mean treatment differences in percentage change from baseline in calculated 10-year Framingham CHD risk were -26.3% vs -27.3% among DM and non-DM patients (adjusted for respective baseline values) (both P < 0.0001). Among DM and non-DM patients, adverse events were reported in 52.8% versus 45.6% in the SPAA and 49.6% versus 41.6% in the UC arms, respectively. This global risk-management approach, simultaneously targeting blood pressure and lipids, was more effective for reducing calculated 10-year Framingham CHD risk than UC in patients with DM. While blood pressure changes were of smaller magnitude among patients with DM, this strategy reduced overall risk to an extent comparable with that observed in non-DM patients. Further studies are thus warranted to study this proactive risk factor intervention on CV or mortality endpoints in patients with and without DM.",

Both ischemia-reperfusion injury and mechanisms of cardioprotection have been studied for more than 50 years. It is known that the physiopathological mechanism of myocardial ischemia involves several factors that are closely related to its development, of which hypercholesterolemia is one of the main ones. Therefore, the objective of this review was to elucidate the effects of a high-cholesterol diet on normal ventricular function and ischemia-reperfusion injury associated phenomenon such as post-ischemic ventricular dysfunction (stunned myocardium). Although there exist many studies considering several aspects of this physiopathological entity, the majority were carried out on normal animals. Thus, experiments carried out on hypercholesterolemic models are controversial, in particular those evaluating different mechanisms of cardioprotection such as ischemic preconditioning and postconditioning, and cardioprotection granted by drugs such as statins, which apart from exerting a lipid-lowering effect, exert pleiotropic effects providing cardioprotection against ischemia-reperfusion injury. These controversial results concerning the mechanisms of cardioprotection vary according to quality, composition, and time of administration of the high-cholesterol diet, as well as the species used in each experiment.

Using a clinical repository of over 800,000 patients, we narrowed this theoretical set of DDIs to 3670 drug pairs actually taken by patients.

Five pairs were identified with their p-values less than 1E-06: loratadine and simvastatin (relative risk or RR\u200a=\u200a1.69); loratadine and alprazolam (RR\u200a=\u200a1.86); loratadine and duloxetine (RR\u200a=\u200a1.94); loratadine and ropinirole (RR\u200a=\u200a3.21); and promethazine and tegaserod (RR\u200a=\u200a3.00). When taken together, each drug pair showed a significantly increased risk of myopathy when compared to the expected additive myopathy risk from taking either of the drugs alone. Based on additional literature data on in vitro drug metabolism and inhibition potency, loratadine and simvastatin and tegaserod and promethazine were predicted to have a strong DDI through the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes, respectively.

This study demonstrated that a commonly used cholesterol-lowering statin medication, simvastatin, which increases HuNoV replication in an in vitro replicon system, also enhances HuNoV infectivity in the gnotobiotic (Gn) pig model. In contrast, oral treatment with interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 reduces HuNoV infectivity. Young piglets, all with A or H1 histo-blood group antigens on enterocytes, were treated orally with 8 mg/kg/day of simvastatin; 5 days later, the pigs were inoculated orally with a GII.4 HuNoV (HS194/2009/US strain) and then treated with simvastatin for 5 more days. Simvastatin induced significantly earlier onset and longer duration of HuNoV fecal shedding in treated pigs, frequently with higher fecal viral titers. Simvastatin impaired poly (I:C)-induced IFN-\u03b1 expression in macrophages or dendritic cells, possibly due to lowered toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 expression; however, the mechanisms were not related to interferon regulatory factor 3 or nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway. Thus, the enhanced, earlier infectivity of HuNoV in simvastatin-treated pigs coincided with the inhibitory effect of simvastatin on innate immunity. In contrast to the increased HuNoV shedding that simvastatin induced, viral shedding during the treatment period was reduced or curtailed in the HuNoV-inoculated pigs pre-treated/treated with human IFN-\u03b1. Our findings are the first to indicate that IFN-\u03b1 has potential as antiviral therapy against HuNoV. Based on these intriguing and novel findings using the Gn pig model, we confirmed that HuNoV infectivity is altered by treatment with simvastatin or IFN-\u03b1. Collectively, these findings indicate that Gn pigs are a useful model to test immunomodulators or efficacy of antivirals against HuNoV.",

    "204": "Adding the birth cohort dimension to AP analysis is valuable for academic and professional practice as trends can be more accurately described and explained and it can help improve projections of future trends.", 
    "205": "In addition to reducing the serum level of cholesterol, statins have various pleiotropic effects such as increasing nitric oxide and reducing oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neurotoxicity. Increasing evidence indicates that statins are neuroprotective in several conditions, including stroke, cerebral ischemia and traumatic brain injury. However, only a few studies have investigated whether statins modulate seizure activity.", 
    "206": "In the current study, we investigated whether acute treatment with atorvastatin alters the seizures induced by electroshock or pentylenetetrazole in mice. We also evaluated whether nitrergic system is involved in the effects of acute atorvastatin on seizure.", 
    "207": "The results of the present study demonstrate that acute atorvastatin (10 and 20 mg/kg) treatment decreased the incidence of tonic seizure and death in electroshock-induced seizure model. We also showed that acute atorvastatin (10 mg/kg) treatment increased the clonic seizure threshold in pentylenetetrazole-seizure model. Acute L-NAME (5 mg/kg), a non-selective inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, or aminoguanidine (100 mg/kg), a selective inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase, administration prevented the anti-convulsant effect of atorvastatin in electroshock-induced seizure model. We also demonstrated that acute L-NAME (5 mg/kg) or aminoguanidine (100 mg/kg) administration decreased the enhanced clonic latency of clonic seizure threshold induced by atorvastatin in mice in pentylenetetrazole model.", 
    "208": "In conclusion, anti-convulsant effect of atorvastatin was demonstrated in two seizure models of electroshock and intraperitoneal pentylenetetrazole. Nitric oxide release, probably through inducible nitric oxide synthase at least in part is responsible for this effect.", 
    "209": "In recent years, combination therapy has received growing popularity as a powerful therapeutic tactic for the treatment of diseases. The justifications and benefits of combination therapy are far-reaching, including but not limited to addressing unmet medical needs such as cancer, malaria, and HIV/AIDS, improved clinical efficacy and safety with reduced dosage of a single medication, understanding the underlying science of the disease, alleviating pharmaco-economic impacts, and better drug life-cycle management. Using the ezetimibe/simvastatin combination therapy as a case study, a comprehensive overview of the successful discovery and development of the single-pill combination, Vytorin, is presented in this review. A cursory introduction to combination therapy and the rationale for the ezetimibe/simvastatin combination for the treatment of hyperlipidemia provides an instructive entry point. The discovery and mode of action of simvastatin and ezetimibe monotherapies set the scene for a detailed discussion on the discovery and development of Vytorin, with emphasis on bioequivalency studies, clinical efficacy and safety profile studies, and the economic consequences of the single-pill combination therapy. Large-scale outcome clinical trials are also discussed to demonstrate the long-term effects of Vytorin.", 
    "210": "Polymorphisms in genes encoding drug metabolizing enzymes, drug transporters, and drug targets can influence drug effects and contribute to inter-individual differences in drug response. Genotype for drug metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters can influence drug disposition in the body (pharmacokinetics), whereas genotype for drug targets may influence sensitivity to a drug (pharmacodynamics). In some cases, response to a particular drug is contingent on genotype for both drug disposition and drug target proteins. For example, warfarin dose requirements are influenced by both cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) and vitamin K epoxide reductase complex 1 (VKORC1) genotypes. The goal of pharmacogenetics is to maximize drug effectiveness while limiting drug toxicity, based on an individual's DNA. Over 80 drugs now contain genetic information in their FDA-approved labeling. In addition to influencing warfarin dose requirements, genotype contributes to the efficacy of clopidogrel in coronary artery disease, risk for hypersensitivity reactions to abacavir in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus, risk for statin-induced myopathy, and responses to numerous other drugs. Genetic information is routinely integrated into decisions regarding cancer chemotherapy and treatment for human immunodeficiency virus. Clinical implementation of pharmacogenetics is becoming a reality in other therapeutic areas, such as for patients requiring dual antiplatelet therapy following coronary artery stent implantation. In the future, it is possible that individuals will be broadly genotyped so that genetic information can guide drug therapy decisions throughout their lifetime.", 
    "211": "There are now ample data that demonstrate that inhibition of PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) can safely lower LDL cholesterol synergistically with statins. Considering that PCSK9 was first identified less than a decade ago, the last few years have shown rapid and remarkable advancements in our understanding and knowledge of the structure and function of PCSK9.", 
    "212": "Therapeutic developments have not lagged far behind with some monoclonal antibodies currently entering phase III trials. Of the many approaches to PCSK9 inhibition, these compounds are the furthest advanced in their clinical development while small molecule oral inhibitors seem a distant prospect.", 
    "213": "This review summarizes the discovery and history of PCSK9 and in particular its mode of action as an inhibitor of the LDL receptor. It also recapitulates key studies that have demonstrated the potential of inhibiting PCSK9 to further decrease LDL-cholesterol levels safely and synergistically with statins. Finally, we review the strategies that are currently in development to inhibit PCSK9, with a special emphasis on the spectacular results from recent phase-I and phase-II clinical trials.", 
    "214": "Statins are associated with adverse skeletal muscle effects. Our objective was to determine if muscular adaptations following exercise training prevented deleterious effects of atorvastatin in glycolytic skeletal muscle.", 
    "215": "Twenty rats were divided into 2 groups: a control group (n = 10; Cont) and a 10 days of training group (n = 10; Training). Using the permeabilized fibers technique, we explored mitochondrial function.", 
    "216": "Exercise training increased V(max) and H(2)O(2) production without altering the free radical leak, and mRNA expression of SOD2 and Cox1 were higher in trained muscle. In the Cont group, atorvastatin exposure increased H(2)O(2) production and decreased skeletal muscle V(max). The decreased V(max) effect of atorvastatin was dose dependent. Interestingly, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) was higher in the Training group. H(2)O(2) production increased in trained muscle after atorvastatin exposure.", 
    "217": "These results suggest that improvements in mitochondrial respiratory and antioxidant capacities following endurance training protected mitochondria against statin exposure.", 
    "218": "Magnesium is an ubiquitous element and its formulation determines its efficacy and administration. It is used for gastrointestinal and obstetric disease and recently cardiovascular and neurological indications have also been explored. The role of serum/dietary magnesium intake on cardiovascular disease, carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), hypertension (HTN) and cholesterol synthesis has been investigated. Despite differences in patient populations, some observational and interventional studies have suggested that low serum/dietary magnesium is associated with higher CIMT and more cardiovascular risk factors. A few clinical and basic science interventional studies have also shown the benefits of magnesium administration in cardiovascular disease prevention and as a neuroprotective agent. Low magnesium levels have been implicated in inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. Hypomagnesemia results in increased C-reactive protein and cytokine exaggeration, increased nuclear factor kappa B and platelet dysfunction, which can lead to thrombosis. Magnesium appears to play a vital function in cardiovascular stability and health, but an optimal dose and formulation has not been defined. Potentially promising avenues include the combination of magnesium with a statin to reduce cholesterol, C-reactive protein and CIMT, and its early use to reduce stroke morbidity and mortality. Understanding the role of magnesium in inflammation and mineralization and how it has the potential for playing a role in modulating cardiovascular and neurological disease can be a new frontier in medicine.", 
    "219": "Endovascular recanalization therapies are an increasingly used strategy for acute cerebral ischemia with heterogeneous clinical outcomes. We aimed to determine the impact of previous medication on ischemic stroke following intra-arterial revascularization therapy.", 
    "220": "Consecutive patients receiving intra-arterial reperfusion therapy after an acute intracranial occlusion were analyzed. Premorbid use of antiplatelets, statins, oral antidiabetic drugs, antihypertensive drugs and oral anticoagulants were recorded. Collateral pial circulation (CPC) was scored on initial angiogram.", 
    "221": "118 patients were included (mean age 70.4 \u00b1 11 years, 45% female). 66 patients (56%) were cardioembolic, 30 (25%) atherothrombotic, and 22 (19%) other/unknown etiologies. No significant impact of medication was detected in all the series or cardioembolic strokes. However, relevant differences were found among atherothrombotic strokes. The previous use of antiplatelets was associated with smaller infarct volume (64 vs. 170 ml; p = 0.043) whereas premorbid statin predicted reduced infarct volume (64 vs. 215 ml; p = 0.019), clinical improvement (79 vs. 29%; p = 0.016) and good CPC (100 vs. 20%; p = 0.04). Statins were the only medication independently predicting reduced infarct volume and clinical improvement and this effect depended on CPC.", 
    "222": "Previous use of statins may preferentially benefit patients with atherothrombotic strokes by favoring the development of CPC.", 
    "223": "This study evaluated the relation between apolipoprotein B (apoB) decrease and coronary heart disease, stroke, and cardiovascular disease risk. Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis was used to evaluate the association of mean absolute apoB decrease (milligrams per deciliter) with relative risk of coronary heart disease (nonfatal myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease death), stroke (nonfatal stroke and fatal stroke), or cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease, stroke, and coronary revascularization). Analysis included 25 trials (n = 131,134): 12 on statin, 4 on fibrate, 5 on niacin, 2 on simvastatin-ezetimibe, 1 on ileal bypass surgery, and 1 on aggressive versus standard low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and blood pressure targets. Combining the 25 trials, each 10-mg/dl decrease in apoB was associated with a 9% decrease in coronary heart disease, no decrease in stroke, and a 6% decrease in major cardiovascular disease risk. Non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol decrease modestly outperformed apoB decrease for prediction of coronary heart disease (Bayes factor [BF] 1.45) and cardiovascular disease (BF 2.07) risk decrease; apoB decrease added to non-HDL cholesterol plus LDL cholesterol decrease slightly improved cardiovascular disease risk prediction (1.13) but did not improve coronary heart disease risk prediction (BF 1.03) and worsened stroke risk prediction (BF 0.83). In the 12 statin trials, apoB and non-HDL cholesterol decreases similarly predicted cardiovascular disease risk; apoB improved coronary heart disease prediction when added to non-HDL cholesterol/LDL cholesterol decrease (BF 3.33) but did not improve stroke risk prediction when added to non-HDL cholesterol/LDL cholesterol decrease (BF 1.06). In conclusion, across all drug classes, apoB decreases did not consistently improve risk prediction over LDL cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol decreases. For statins, apoB decreases added information to LDL cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol decreases for predicting coronary heart disease but not stroke or overall cardiovascular disease risk decrease.", 
    "224": "Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in postmenopausal women. Among statins, pravastatin has been shown to significantly reduce fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events in primary and secondary prevention trials. The aim of the present research was to investigate whether treatment with pravastatin can modify some indices of cardiovascular risk in healthy postmenopausal women such as significant reductions in total and LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels.", 
    "225": "20 patients were randomized in double-blind fashion to treatment for eight weeks with either pravastatin 40 mg/day or placebo, and subsequently, after one-week wash-out, crossed-over to the alternative treatment (placebo or pravastatin) for the following eight weeks. We performed clinical and laboratory investigations, before and at the end of each treatment period, to evaluate patient response to the treatment with pravastatin.", 
    "226": "After eight weeks pravastatin therapy reduced the median low density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterol (p < 0.01 in both cases). In contrast, insulin level and insulin sensitivity did not show any difference with regard to values observed after placebo treatment. The absolute number of endothelial progenitor cells-colony forming unit (EPC-CFU) was significantly increased by pravastatin treatment (30.6% increase, p < 0.05) and the number of senescent cells was significantly decreased. However pravastatin did not increase tube-like formation by EPC and did not improve endothelial function.", 
    "227": "Despite beneficial effect on lipids and EPC, short term pravastatin does not seem to improve other cardiovascular risk factors, at least in healthy postmenopausal women.", 
    "228": "Statin drugs are prescribed primarily for their ability to lower cholesterol, but may also exert beneficial side effects unrelated to cholesterol metabolism. Previous work has described a \"statin paradox,\" where statin treatment decreased osteoblastic markers in valve myofibroblasts while increasing those same markers in preosteoblasts. However, valvular interstitial cells (VICs) themselves are a multipotent cell type, capable of differentiating into activated, myofibroblastic VICs (aVICs) and osteoblastic VICs (obVICs), motivating the question of whether the statin paradox can exist within an individual valve containing these phenotypically distinct VIC subpopulations. In the current study, a heterogeneous initial population of porcine VICs was differentiated into aVICs or obVICs and treated with simvastatin. Gene expression analysis was conducted daily over an 8-day time course to capture temporally dynamic changes in cell phenotype induced by statin treatment. These studies demonstrated that the two VIC populations, aVICs and obVICs, exhibited differential responses to statin treatment. Specifically, simvastatin increased the expression of osteoblastic markers in obVICs, but not in aVICs, while also suppressing the myofibroblastic phenotype in both aVICs and obVICs. These results indicate that the statin paradox can exist within the heterogeneous VIC population of an individual diseased valve and that statin efficacy in the context of calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) may be dependent upon the cellular composition of the valve. These findings may have implications for clinical usage of statins, shedding light on how statin efficacy in CAVD may be dependent upon the disease stage or why some individuals exhibit better responsiveness to statin therapy.", 
    "229": "Statins are a class of drugs mostly used for treating hyperlipidemia, and rosuvastatin is the newest drug in the market belonging to this class. In this present work, a method was developed based on the molecular fluorescence technique, with the objective to quantify rosuvastatin in urine samples. For this purpose, the study of several parameters was made to achieve the maximum analytical signal (under reaction with sulfuric acid during 40 min). Also, a previous step to avoid matrix interference was carried out (liquid-liquid extraction). The limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) were 0.38 and 1.28 mg L(-1), respectively. Linear relationship between rosuvastatin concentration and it's fluorescence intensity was found until 5.0 mg L(-1). The proposed method was tested in several samples spiked with rosuvastatin and recovery was found in the range of 90 \u00b1 10%.", 
    "230": "Isolated rat hepatocytes are widely used to assess the metabolism and toxicity of xenobiotics. The choice of digestion enzyme used to prepare the cells has been shown previously to influence their metabolic capability. This study investigates the effect of the digestion enzyme (collagenase II, collagenase A/trypsin inhibitor, or collagenase plus dispase) on the uptake of xenobiotics into, and efflux from, hepatocytes. The choice of digestion enzymes used in this study does not affect uptake of either pravastatin (an organic anion probe substrate for Oatp transporter) or metformin (an organic cation probe substrate for Oct transporter). With regard to efflux transporters, hepatocyte differentiation was better maintained when cells were isolated using collagenase II alone.", 
    "231": "The debate whether statins, 3-hydroxymethyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, are safe to use has been raging since their introduction in 1987. Statins are generally well tolerated and are believed to have minimal adverse effects. However, individual, specific rare adverse events have been reported, such as elevations of liver enzymes, muscle aches, and very rarely, rhabdomyolysis. Discontinuation and/or reduction in the dose of the statin usually leads to resolution of these side effects. Recently, however, debate has focused on the possible negative long-term effects of statin treatment on cognitive decline, the incidence of cancer, and the development of diabetes mellitus. Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has expanded the warning for statins with a statement that statin use may lead to cognitive impairment. In this review, we discuss all levels of evidence, from case reports to large randomized controlled clinical trials, for the possible adverse effects of statins on cognitive decline, cancer, and diabetes. After careful consideration of all discussed scientific evidence, we conclude that there is no increased risk of cognitive decline or cancer with statin use. However, statin use is related to a small increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. In view of the overwhelming benefit of statins in the reduction of cardiovascular events, we believe the small absolute risk for development of diabetes is outweighed by the cardiovascular benefits in patients for whom statin therapy is recommended. We, therefore, suggest that clinical practice for statin therapy should not be changed on the basis of the most recent Food and Drug Administration informational warnings.", 
    "232": "Many patients remain at high risk for future cardiovascular events despite levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) at, or below, target while taking statin therapy. Much effort is therefore being focused on strategies to reduce this residual risk. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is a strong, independent, inverse predictor of coronary heart disease risk and is therefore an attractive therapeutic target. Currently available agents that raise HDL-C have only modest effects and there is limited evidence of additional cardiovascular risk reduction on top of background statin therapy associated with their use. It was hoped that the use of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors would provide additional benefit, but the results of clinical outcome studies to date have been disappointing. The results of ongoing trials with other CETP inhibitors that raise HDL-C to a greater degree and also lower LDL-C, as well as with other emerging therapies are awaited."
