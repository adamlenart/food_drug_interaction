We determined Lp-PLA(2) responses to statin and fibrate administration in type 2 diabetes mellitus, and assessed relationships of changes in Lp-PLA(2) with subclinical inflammation and lipoprotein characteristics.", 
    "1": "A placebo-controlled cross-over study (three 8-week treatment periods with simvastatin (40 mg daily), bezafibrate (400mg daily) and their combination) was carried out in 14 male type 2 diabetic patients. Plasma Lp-PLA(2) mass was measured by turbidimetric immunoassay.", 
    "2": "Plasma Lp-PLA(2) decreased (-21 \u00b1 4%) in response to simvastatin (p<0.05 from baseline and placebo), but was unaffected by bezafibrate (1 \u00b1 5%). The drop in Lp-PLA(2) during combined treatment (-17 \u00b1 3%, p<0.05) was similar compared to that during simvastatin alone. The Lp-PLA(2) changes during the 3 active lipid lowering treatment periods were related positively to baseline levels of high sensitive C-reactive protein, non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, the total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio and less LDL electronegativity (p<0.02 to p<0.01), and inversely to baseline Lp-PLA(2) (p<0.01). LpPLA(2) responses correlated inversely with changes in non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and the total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio during treatment (p<0.05 to p<0.02).", 
    "3": "In type 2 diabetes mellitus, plasma Lp-PLA(2) is likely to be lowered by statin treatment only. Enhanced subclinical inflammation and more severe dyslipidemia may predict diminished LpPLA(2) responses during lipid lowering treatment, which in turn appear to be quantitatively dissociated from decreases in apolipoprotein B lipoproteins. Conventional lipid lowering treatment may be insufficient for optimal LpPLA(2) lowering in diabetes mellitus.", 
    "4": "Women with coronary heart disease (CHD) are consistently less likely than men with CHD to be at low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goals, and the reasons for the gender gap are not established. We studied 2,190 patients with CHD or equivalent (34% women, 42% racial/ethnic minority) who participated in the Family Cardiac Caregiver Investigation to Evaluate Outcomes (FIT-O) Study and had baseline lipid data to determine whether having a paid or informal caregiver was independently associated with adherence to LDL cholesterol goals (<100, <70 mg/dl) and statin use and to determine if the association varied by gender. Caregiver status was assessed by standardized questionnaire and lipid levels/statin use were obtained from a hospital-based informatics system. Associations between caregiving and LDL cholesterol and statin use were assessed in univariate and multivariable models and the interaction was evaluated in gender stratified models. Men with CHD were more likely to be at LDL cholesterol goals <100 and <70 mg/dl and on statins than women with CHD (79% vs 69%, p <0.001; 48% vs 36%, p <0.001; 73% vs 67%, p = 0.004, respectively). No significant association was observed between LDL cholesterol <100 mg/dl and informal caregiving or between paid caregiving and lipid goals or statin use. Having an informal caregiver was associated with having an LDL cholesterol <70 mg/dl (p = 0.016), which remained significant after adjustment in multivariable models (odds ratio 1.25, 95% confidence interval 1.00 to 1.56). Multivariable association between informal caregiving and LDL cholesterol was significant in men (odds ratio 1.37, 95% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.80) but not women. In conclusion, there was a significant association between informal caregiving and LDL cholesterol control that was limited to men with informal caregivers.", 
    "5": "In patients aged \u226580 years without previous coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, or cerebrovascular disease, no evidence has shown a benefit from statin therapy. We examined the prevalence of statin use in patients aged \u226580 years for the indication of primary prevention. We reviewed the comprehensive electronic health records at the Geisinger Health System in Pennsylvania for all patients aged >55 years with \u22651 primary care encounter from January 24, 2004 and December 31, 2009. The records were scrutinized for the use of a statin, active medical diagnoses, and laboratory values. Patients without a previous diagnosis of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, or cerebrovascular disease were considered to have a primary prevention indication for statin therapy. The prevalence of statin use was examined, and a multivariate analysis was conducted to determine the predictors of use. A total of 89,086 patients were included in the analysis, with 22,646 patients aged \u226580 years. Of all the patients, 26% were prescribed a statin, of whom, 71% (n = 16,687) received it for primary prevention. Of the 14,604 patients aged \u226580 years with a primary prevention indication, 3,145 (22%) received a statin. A plot of 5-year age cohorts from 55 to >90 years demonstrated an n-shaped relation between age and statin use for primary prevention (18%, 23%, 27%, 29%, 28%, 26%, 21%, and 12%, p <0.001). Compared to patients aged <65 years, the ratio of statin prescription for secondary to primary prevention was 31% lower in patients aged \u226580 years (1.3 vs 1.9). Those aged \u226580 years with a primary prevention indication had, with treatment, a mean low-density lipoprotein level of 84 \u00b1 26 mg/dl. In conclusion, many patients aged \u226580 years receive statin therapy for primary prevention and are treated to aggressive low-density lipoprotein levels. Because the efficacy is uncertain and the potential adverse effects are many, we urgently need to define the cost, benefit, and risk of statin use in the very elderly.", 
    "6": "Statins, hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, have been reported to have antiinflammatory and/or immunomodulatory effects and prophylactic and therapeutic effects in collagen-induced arthritis, an experimental model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The authors undertook to determine the effect of atorvastatin on the expressions of osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor activator of nuclear factor \u03baB ligand (RANKL) in RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs), to identify the mechanisms responsible for these effects, and to determine whether the statin inhibits osteoclastogenesis.", 
    "7": "FLSs isolated from five RA patients were cultured in the presence of 20 ng/ml of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) with or without atorvastatin. RANKL expressions were assayed with Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RANKL, RANK, and OPG expression were assayed with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Osteoclast formation was assayed by counting cells after staining for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase in cocultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and RA FLSs.", 
    "8": "Atorvastatin inhibited the expression of RANKL in RA FLSs in a dose-dependent manner, and the suppression of RANKL was prevented by mevalonate. However, OPG expression was not affected by atorvastatin in RA FLSs, and atorvastatin did not affect RANK expression in CD14\u207a cells. Conversely, atorvastatin suppressed TNF-\u03b1-induced p38 phosphorylation in RA FLSs and significantly reduced TRAP-positive multinucleated osteoclast formation in the coculture of PBMCs and RA FLSs.",

    "10": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) can effectively reduce serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in the majority of patients at increased cardiovascular risk. However, some patients at increased cardiovascular risk have a high peripheral leukocyte count and this inflammatory marker has correlated with an increased incidence of coronary events. Recently, in a large clinical trial-based cohort, an increasing on-statin cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) mass was inversely related to coronary events, particularly among those with a low serum LDL-C level. However, the role of the CETP mass in the development of atherosclerosis is still unclear.", 
    "11": "We investigated the possibility of whether the CETP mass was associated with the peripheral leukocyte count after intensive statin therapy, and whether the CETP mass was changed by switching statins.", 
    "12": "This study was an open-label lipid interventional study switching from atorvastatin to pitavastatin without a washout period. Between 1 April 2010 and 31 March 2011, 32 patients (mean age 64.0 \u00b1 9.0 years, 63% male) with hypercholesterolemia receiving atorvastatin (10 mg/day) were enrolled. Next, they were switched to pitavastatin (2 mg/day) for 6 months. The peripheral leukocyte count, the CETP mass measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and lipid parameters were measured at baseline and at follow-up. The type and dosage of concomitant drugs were not changed during the study periods.", 
    "13": "The on-atorvastatin LDL-C level was well controlled with 94.4 \u00b1 23.1 mg/dL, and peripheral leukocyte count was 6209 \u00b1 1142 cells/\u03bcL. On atorvastatin therapy, the CETP mass correlated negatively with the peripheral leukocyte count (r = -0.418, p = 0.02). In univariate regression analysis, on-atorvastatin peripheral leukocyte count was significantly correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (\u03b2 = -42.1, p = 0.008), triglycerides (\u03b2 = 8.2, p = 0.005), and the CETP mass (\u03b2 = -1296.3, p = 0.02). In a multivariate analysis after adjusting for traditional risk factors, the CETP mass remained an independent negative determinant of the peripheral leukocyte count (\u03b2 = -1162, p = 0.02). By switching atorvastatin to pitavastatin, the CETP mass was significantly increased from 1.9 to 2.1 \u03bcg/mL (8.8%, p = 0.007), and the peripheral leukocyte count was significantly decreased from 6209 to 5778 cells/\u03bcL (-5.9%, p = 0.005). As a result, the relationship between CETP mass and peripheral leukocyte count after pitavastatin treatment was diminished (r = -0.276, p = 0.13). Moreover, the change in peripheral leukocyte count was negatively correlated with the change in the CETP mass (r = -0.39, p = 0.03), suggesting that a decreased CETP mass may be closely associated with an elevated peripheral leukocyte count in atorvastatin-treated patients.", 
    "14": "The results suggest that residual cardiovascular risk after atorvastatin treatment may be associated with the CETP mass, which may be increased by switching to pitavastatin. Furthermore, a CETP mass-activating strategy may assist the therapeutic efficacy of statins.", 
    "15": "Tetrahydropalmatine (THP), with one chiral centre, is one of the major constituents of Rhizoma corydalis. THP is considered to possess analgesic, sedative, hypnotic actions and cardiac protection. The aim of this study was to elucidate the stereoselective interaction between THP and ABC transporters. The present study investigated three most important ABC transporters, including P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). The intracellular accumulation and bidirectional transport suggested THP enantiomers were inhibitors of P-gp, but not of MRP1 or BCRP. The IC(50) values of (-)-THP and (+)-THP on rhodamine 123 (P-gp substrate) efflux were 48.6 and 20.0 \u00b5M, respectively, which showed obvious stereoselective difference. In the bidirectional transport, THP enantiomers showed high passive permeability and the contribution of P-gp could not be testified. The western blot and real-time RT-PCR assays showed that THP enantiomers reduced the protein expression of P-gp, but did not affect its mRNA expression. In in vitro cytotoxicity test, THP enantiomers showed the potential of increasing the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in P-gp-mediated multidrug resistant tumour cells. The present study showed the stereoselective interaction between THP enantiomers and P-gp, which should be considered in clinical practice.", 
    "16": "In the recent years, some clinical and experimental studies have suggested that the use of statins may protect against atrial fibrillation (AF). A relation between inflammation and the development of AF has been described, and the potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of statins may make them effective in preventing the development of AF. A global analysis of the literature suggests that the use of statins is associated with a decreased risk of incidence or recurrence of AF in some cases. However, this beneficial effect is not seen for all types of AF in all the patients. The use of statins seems associated 1) with a lack of benefit in primary prevention of AF, 2) with a significant but heterogeneous decreased risk of recurrence of AF in secondary prevention, and 3) with a very significant and homogeneous reduction for the risk of post operative AF. An intensive lipid lowering statin regimen does not provide greater protection against AF. Patients with coronary heart disease are curr ently treated with statins in most cases, and this may not have an impact on their treatment. In contrast, it remains to determine more accurately if statins may bring a significant benefit for some AF patients without any type of established atherosclerotic disease or with a low risk of atherogenesis. Since it remains uncertain whether the suppression of AF in these patients is beyond doubt beneficial, prescribing statins for this purpose alone should not be recommended at the present time.",

All trials evaluated patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Most trials enrolled patients taking interferon beta therapy either twice or three times weekly. The mean baseline EDSS scores ranged from 1.2 to 3.4. Evaluated statins included simvastatin and atorvastatin. No significant difference was found between the statin and control groups in the incident rate ratio for clinical relapse (0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17 to 3.11), risk of relapse (relative risk [RR], 0.99; 95% CI, 0.53 to 1.85], disease progression (RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.73 to 2.36), or difference in the change in the EDSS score from baseline (weighted mean difference, -0.06; 95% CI, -0.30 to 0.19).",

Of 11,783 possible SNP pairs examined, we detected a single significant interaction between rs12130333, located within the ANGPTL3 gene region, and rs4240705, within the RXRA gene, on ApoB reduction after statin-FNA therapy (P = 4.0 \u00d7 10(-6)). ApoB response to therapy gradually reduced with the increasing number of T alleles in the rs12130333 but only in the presence of the GG genotype of rs4240705. Individuals doubly homozygous for the minor alleles at rs12130333 and rs4240705 showed a paradoxical increase of 1.8% in ApoB levels after FNA-statin combination therapy. No gene-gene interaction was identified other than an interaction between SNPs in the ANGPTL3 and RXRA regions, which results in the inhibition of ApoB reduction in response to statin-FNA therapy.

Thirdly, oxLDL increased mRNA levels of BAFFR, TRAILR1 and TRAILR4 in PBMCs ex vivo from individuals with FH. Fourthly, OX40, acting through OX40L, enhanced the oxLDL-induced expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in THP-1 monocytes in vitro.

Recent data suggest that mature macrophages differentiate into dendritic-like cells when exposed to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL). The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of atorvastatin on the differentiation of macrophages to DCs and the molecular mechanisms of this transition. Mouse macrophage-like RAW264.7 cell was differentiated into a dendritic-like phenotype by incubation with oxLDL in the absence or presence of atorvastatin. The results showed that atorvastatin suppressed DC-like morphologic changes in vitro as assessed by decreased expression of DC maturation markers (CD83, CD11c, CD86, major histocompatibility complex class II, and CD1d). Atorvastatin also inhibited other oxLDL-induced functional changes including endocytic activity, ability to induce T cell proliferation, and cytokine secretion. Western blot analysis showed that oxLDL treatment of RAW264.7 cells induced phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). However, blocking p38 MAPK with SB203580 significantly downregulated the expression of DC maturation markers, accompanied by decreased cytokine secretion.

    "71": "Increased vascular contractility plays an important role in the development of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Increased vascular contractility can be attributed to either endothelial dysfunction or increased contractility of vascular smooth muscle. Endothelial damage and dysfunction cause impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the cerebral artery after SAH. In addition to endothelial damage and dysfunction, receptor upregulation in vascular smooth muscle contributes to the induction and enhancement of contractile responses to agonists. Our recent data revealed that feedback regulation of the activity of the G protein-coupled receptor and myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity is impaired after SAH. This impaired feedback regulation is suggested to cause a sustained contractile response to various agonists, thereby contributing to increased vascular contractility. In addition, three current topics are reviewed: endothelin type A receptor antagonists, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors for treatment, and cortical spreading depolarization for the mechanism of cerebral vasospasm.",

Atorvastatin treatment inhibits proliferation, apoptosis and cytokine production of MFB in bile duct-ligated (BDL) rats in vivo. Here, we have further investigated the underlying mechanisms. Primary rat hepatic stellate cells (HSC) were isolated and culture-activated to hepatic MFB. Following 3 days of incubation with atorvastatin (10(-4), 10(-5) and 10(-6) M), transcription levels of profibrotic cytokines (transforming growth factor-\u03b21, connective tissue growth factor and TIMP1) and procollagen Ia were analyzed by real time PCR. Proliferation was investigated by 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine assays. \u03b1-Smooth muscle actin protein expression was examined by western blotting. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of Annexin V and propidium iodide were used to measure apoptosis. Furthermore, p21 western blotting and \u03b2-galactosidase staining were investigated in MFB as senescence markers. Subsequently, hepatic expression of desmin and senescence markers were analyzed in the livers of rats receiving atorvastatin (15 mg/kg*d) for 1 week starting 3 and 5 weeks after BDL. Atorvastatin inhibited the activation of HSC to MFB and decreased cytokine and collagen production in MFB in vitro. In addition, proliferation, cytokine and collagen production of MFB were reduced by atorvastatin. Atorvastatin initiated apoptosis at 10(-4) M and attenuated it at 10(-5) M. Atorvastatin induced p21 protein expression and \u03b2-galactosidase staining of MFB in vitro and in vivo. Atorvastatin elicits similiar effects on MFB as previously seen in vivo: it decreases MFB turnover and fibrogenesis. We suggest that a further mechanism explaining these effects is senescence of cells.",

Yet, many questions remain unanswered. Can these novel markers be used to identify adults who will benefit from statin therapy? How will novel markers affect medication adherence?

Despite this fact, females are still under-represented in the majority of clinical trials. At the present time, only limited evidence is available with respect to the female-specific aspects of pathogenesis, management, and outcomes in acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Women less frequently undergo coronary intervention, and a lower proportion of women receive evidence-based pharmacotherapy, compared with men. It has been shown that women benefit from an invasive approach and coronary intervention in ACS as much as men, despite their advanced age and higher rate of bleeding complications. Also, administration of beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors, and intensive statin therapy is associated with a comparable reduction of cardiovascular event rates in women and men. On the other hand, women may profit less than men from fibrinolytic or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor therapy. Both sexes benefit equally from aspirin therapy, whereas contradictory data are available on the efficacy of clopidogrel in women.

We conducted a retrospective analysis of outpatient electronic health records and the most recent lipid profile, lipid-lowering medications and doses were collected. Results. We identified 9950 coronary artery disease patients. Only 37% on a statin alone achieved an LDL-cholesterol of <70\u2009mg/dL, and most were on moderate-to-high-potency statins. The intensity of statin therapy did not improve LDL-cholesterol goal attainment. Among patients on combination therapy, 41% on statin plus ezetimibe and 46% on statin plus niacin achieved an LDL-cholesterol of <70\u2009mg/dL (P = 0.01 and <0.0001 versus statin alone). If patients were switched to a high-potency statin LDL-cholesterol goal attainment of <70\u2009mg/dL would increase to 46% and would increase up to 72% with combination therapy. Conclusions. Most coronary artery disease patients in clinical practice do not attain an LDL-cholesterol of <70\u2009mg/dL, even among patients on high potency statins. The combination of statin plus either ezetimibe or niacin is the most effective regimen to achieve an LDL-cholesterol of <70\u2009mg/dL, however, these drug combinations are used infrequently in clinical practice.",

Furthermore, pravastatin alone limited basal HTR8 cell migration (P< 0.01), and did not mitigate the adverse effect of aPL on trophoblast migration. Pravastatin also had no impact on the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and angiogenic factors by primary human first trimester trophoblast cells exposed to aPL.",

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are functionally intertwined with the c-Myc network as multiple miRNAs are regulated by c-Myc, while others directly suppress c-Myc expression. In this work, we identified miR-33b as a primate-specific negative regulator of c-Myc. The human miR-33b gene is located at 17p11.2, a genomic locus frequently lost in medulloblastomas, of which a subset displays c-Myc overproduction. Through a small-scale screening with drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), we found that lovastatin upregulated miR-33b expression, reduced cell proliferation and impaired c-Myc expression and function in miR-33b-positive medulloblastoma cells. In addition, a low dose of lovastatin treatment at a level comparable to approved human oral use reduced tumour growth in mice orthotopically xenografted with cells carrying miR-33b, but not with cells lacking miR-33b.

In the present study, we hypothesized that treatment with pravastatin (an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase) would normalize the ET-1-induced contraction in aortas isolated from type 2 diabetic Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty (OLETF) rats. Contractile responses were examined by measuring isometric force in endothelium-denuded aortic helical strips from four groups: Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO; genetic control), OLETF (type 2 diabetic), pravastatin-treated LETO, and pravastatin-treated OLETF rats. Both immunoblot analysis and immunoprecipitation assays were used to examine Src, protein phosphatase (PP)2A, kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR)1, and ERK signaling pathway protein levels and activities. In endothelium-denuded aortas isolated from OLETF rats at the chronic stage of diabetes (56-60 wk) (vs. those from age-matched LETO rats), we found the following: 1) ET-1-induced contraction was enhanced, 2) ERK1/2 phosphorylation was increased, 3) phosphorylations of KSR1 and PP2A were reduced (i.e., enhancement of the kinase active state), 4) ERK1/2-KSR1 complexes were increased, and 5) Src tyrosine kinase activity was diminished. Endothelium-denuded aortas isolated from OLETF rats treated with pravastatin (10 mg/kg po, daily for 4 wk) exhibited normalized ET-1-induced contractions and suppressed ET-1-stimulated ERK phosphorylation, with the associated phosphorylated KSR1 and phosphorylated PP2A levels being increased toward normal levels. These results suggest that in type 2 diabetic rats, pravastatin normalizes ET-1-induced contraction in aortic smooth muscle via a suppression of PP2A/KSR1/ERK activities after an enhancement of Src kinase activity.",

Product I, an intermediate product, was found in the fermentation broth, and the structure analysis showed that product I had an additional hydroxyl group at the methyl group attached to C3 compared to lovastatin, which indicates that product I is one isomer of wuxistatin. Isotope tracing experiment proved that hydroxyl group of wuxistatin was provided by product I and the reaction from product I to wuxistatin was an intramolecular transfer. Hydroxylation reaction established in a cell-free system could be inhibited by CO and enhanced by ATP, Fe(2+), and ascorbic acid, which were consistent with the presumption that the hydroxylase was an induced cytochrome P450. Study on proteomics of Amycolatopsis sp. CGMCC 1149 suggested that three identified proteins, including integral membrane protein, Fe-S oxidoreductase, and GTP-binding protein YchF, were induced by lovastatin and required during hydroxylation reaction. In conclusion, bioconversion mechanism of wuxistatin by Amycolatopsis sp.

We have previously demonstrated that whisker stimulation promotes angiogenesis in the penumbra of the ischemic barrel cortex. The aim of this study was to examine whether atorvastatin and whisker stimulation can act synergistically in enhancing angiogenesis in the barrel cortex following ischemia. Rats were divided into sham-operation, control, atorvastatin-treatment, whisker stimulation and combination therapy groups. And they were trained continuously for 10 trials per half day until the rat fulfilled 80% correct choices for continuous thirty trials, which were considered to reach the criteria. The number was significantly less in the combination therapy group than that in the whisker stimulation group (P<0.01). Immunofluorescence was used to detect angiogenesis 14 d following focal ischemia. These data showed that the combination therapy was more effective in enhancing VEGF and BDNF expression than whisker stimulation (P<0.01). Our study indicated that atorvastatin can improve the discrimination ability of whisker stimulation in rats and amplify post-ischemic angiogenesis induced by whisker stimulation, potentially via enhanced expression of VEGF and BDNF in the peri-infarct region.",

Using simvastatin (SIM) as a positive control, berberine from Coptidis Rhizoma was identified as the active component which could act on the hPDLC. The MTT colorimetric assay, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and staining tests revealed that berberine could promote hPDLC growth, increase the secretion of ALP in the culture medium, and enhance the formation of mineralized nodule, thus it is a potential osteoplastic ingredient. This hPDLC/CMC-online-LC/MS method can be applied for screening active components acting on hPDLC from traditional Chinese medicines exemplified by Coptidis Rhizoma and will be of great utility in drug discovery using natural medicinal herbs as a source of leading compounds.",

Short-term clinical benefit of statin therapy has been recently evaluated by randomized clinical trials in the setting of vascular surgery, coronary bypass surgery and percutaneous coronary interventions. According to the trial scheme, statin therapy was started either few weeks or few hours before the intervention. In the field of vascular surgery, the clinical benefit of preprocedure statin administration has been supported by DECREASE III trial. Fluvastatin significantly decreased the incidence of periprocedural myocardial ischemia as defined by ECG changes or troponin elevation. However, this study has methodological flaws, including primary endpoint modification during the trial and the lack of clinical relevance of this endpoint. The administration of statins before a coronary bypass could reduce the occurrence of postoperative atrial fibrillation, according to 4 randomized trials. This finding is discordant with the result of a recent meta-analysis of long-term published and unpublished long-term trials that showed no significant beneficial effects of statins on atrial fibrillation. Several trials have evaluated the usefulness of statin pretreatment before PCI. Most of them have found that statin pretreatment prevents periprocedural myocardial infarctions or major cardiac events. However, most of these events were isolated enzymatic elevations. Moreover, myocardial infarction definition was at odds with the recommendations in some of these trials. A recent meta-analysis of these trials has found that statin pretreatment leads to a 44% reduction in the incidence of major cardiac events at 30 days. The magnitude of this decrease is not consistent with the results of previous long-term trials evaluating statins after acute coronary syndromes. Current evidence does not strongly support short-term clinical benefit of pre-procedural statin administration.",

The findings from the individual studies when comparing the different statins were less clear. A higher statin dosage and risk factors associated with diabetes appeared to predict this phenomenon. There have been many studies investigating the effects of statins on glycaemic control, but again no clear conclusion is apparent. Despite the increase in new onset diabetes observed, the risk is clearly out-weighed by the CVD benefits observed in nearly all the statin trials. Thus, no change is required to any of the prevention guidelines regarding statins. However, it may be prudent to monitor glycaemic control after commencing statin therapy.

The 110 patients with HTN who needed statin therapy (HTN with statin group) were started on pitavastatin (1-2 mg/day), and both groups continued with appropriate medication for HTN. LV and LA structure and function were examined by conventional and speckle-tracking echocardiography at baseline and after 1 year. LA volume and function in the HTN with statin group improved more than in the HTN without statin group. There was a significant difference in survival free of new-onset AF in the patients with and without statin therapy during the 2-year follow-up (hazard ratio: 0.32, P=0.027).",

In patients without known CHD, cardiovascular risk factors were abundant (52.1% had hypertension, 43.6% had dyslipidemia, 41.4% had a family history of CHD, 58.5% were current or former smokers, and 14.9% were diabetic). Despite the high prevalence of risk factors, only 24.1% were on aspirin, 16.1% were on a statin, and only 7.8% were taking an aspirin and statin.

The study population was 202,648 enrollees aged 21 or older who purchased at least 1 pack of statin medication from 1998 to 2006. The follow-up period was from the date of first statin dispensation (index date) to the date of first cancer diagnosis, death, leaving the HMO, or September 1, 2007, whichever occurred first.

To examine whether nonadherence to statins in 126,903 patients on stable statin therapy is associated with subsequent treatment intensification, we conducted a retrospective analysis using an integrated pharmacy and medical claims database. Pharmacy claims were analyzed to determine whether nonadherence, as measured by proportion of days covered on statins <80%, was associated with intensification of statin treatment over a 360-day follow-up. Of 11,361 patients who had treatment intensification, 44% were previously nonadherent to statins. Patients whose treatment was intensified had slightly lower adherence to statin therapy than those without intensification (76% vs 78%, p <0.0001) and were more likely to be nonadherent as defined by proportion of days covered <80% (44% vs 37%, p <0.0001). After controlling for confounding factors, patients nonadherent to statins were 30% more likely to have treatment intensification compared to adherent patients (odds ratio 1.30, 95% confidence interval 1.25 to 1.36). In addition, patients with statin intensification were more likely to be younger, women, and have coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, stroke, peripheral arterial disease, heart failure, or depression. Primary care physicians were more likely to escalate therapy than cardiologists. In conclusion, nearly 1/2 of patients with therapy escalation were nonadherent to statins. Clinicians should inquire about adherence and consider adherence before escalating statin therapy.",

The main objective is to improve solubility of simvastatin beta-CD complex (1:2) by co-precipitation method and then to deliver the same in sustained release dosage form. Sustained-release simvastatin microcapsules were prepared by the ionic gelation technique, using carbopol 941 as swellable floating polymer. A 3(3) full factorial design was used to study the effect of polymer concentration, drug complex and sodium alginate by plotting main effect plot and 3D surface plots. The formed microcapsules were subjected to various evaluation tests such as drug encapsulation efficiency, in vitro drug release and surface morphology by scanning electron microscopy. Powdered X-ray diffractometry and FTIR were used to investigate the complexation of simvastatin in the microcapsules. As the carbopol 941 is self swellable polymer, immediate floating was observed. The in vitro release studies and floating behavior were performed in HCI buffer of pH 1.2. The release profile and dissolution kinetic showed that drug release from the microcapsules follows zero order kinetics. It was concluded from the present investigation that porous carbopol 941 microcapsules are promising sustained release system as well as stomach specific carriers for delivery of simvastatin.", 
    "174": "Fairly soluble drugs in gastrointestinal (GI) media exhibit complete oral absorption, and thus good bioavailability. About 40% of drugs are not soluble in water in practice and therefore are slowly absorbed, which results in insufficient and uneven bioavailability and GI toxicity. Thus, most exigent phase of drug development practice particularly for oral dosage forms is the enhancement of drug solubility and thereby its oral bioavailability. Solubility, an important factor to achieve desired plasma level of drug for pharmacological response, is the phenomenon of dissolution of solid in liquid phase resulting in a homogenous system. This review describes various traditional and novel methodologies proposed for solubility enhancement of simvastatin, and ultimately improvement in its bioavailability. For simvastatin, solubility is a crucial rate limiting factor to achieve its desired level in systemic circulation for pharmacological response. Thus, problematic solubility of simvastatin is a main challenge for dosage form developing researchers. Various procedures, illustrated in this review, have been successfully employed to improve the simvastatin solubility for its bioavailability enhancement; however, successful improvement essentially depends on the assortment of technique. Among all the solubility enhancement techniques, solid dispersion method, in terms of ease and efficiency is most promising and routinely employed technique to resolve the solubility problems of simvastatin.",

Carotid atherosclerosis was established by balloon-induced injury to the endothelium of the carotid artery in conjunction with consumption of a high-cholesterol diet. After 8 weeks, all rabbits were killed to evaluate the expression of MCP-1 and VCAM-1 by immunohistochemical staining.",

    "183": "Periprocedural myocardial infarction (PMI) is a common complication associated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), occurring in approximately 15% to 20% of patients undergoing the procedure. The established diagnostic criteria for PMI is an increase in cardiac biomarkers, specifically creatine kinase-MB levels > 3 times the upper limit of normal. As PMI has been associated with an increased risk of mortality after PCI, investigative efforts have been directed at therapies that can potentially decrease PMI. One such therapy is the use of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) administered as a loading dose before PCI. Multiple small, randomized, controlled trials have demonstrated significant reductions in the incidence of PMI with statin loading before PCI. The risk reduction was seen in patients with stable and unstable coronary artery disease, as well in statin-naive patients or those on chronic statin therapy. Potential mechanisms for the rapid benefits of statin loading include: anti-inflammatory effects, reversal of endothelial dysfunction, decrease in oxidative stress, and inhibition of the thrombotic system. None of the current studies were of sufficient power or duration to detect benefits on mortality, though a recent meta-analysis did demonstrate a reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events. In addition to long-term effects, several additional questions remain with regard to statin loading, such as statin type, dose, and optimal timing of administration. However, given the current evidence of benefit and the low risk of adverse events, it can be recommended that all patients undergoing PCI be considered for statin loading before the procedure.",

With the use of a comparator with incident CAD alone (n=154 183), we assessed temporal trends and comparative use of cardioprotective medications. Relative differences in medication use were examined by using multivariable logistic regression. Use of medications improved temporally among both groups: for PAD alone, any antiplatelet use increased from 29% to 59% from 2000 to 2007 (P<0.0001), whereas statin use increased 6-fold (9%-56%; P<0.0001). However, use of these therapies by 18 months after incident diagnosis for both PAD groups remained modest and lower in comparison with CAD alone (any antiplatelet, 53% versus 66%; statins, 40% versus 52%; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, 20% versus 29%). Relative to CAD alone, patients with PAD alone were less likely to use any antiplatelet (adjusted odds ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.49-0.52), statins (adjusted odds ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.52), or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (adjusted odds ratio, 0.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.49-0.53) by 18 months.",

    "198": "Morbidities related to atherosclerosis, such as acute coronary syndromes (ACS) including unstable angina and myocardial infarction, remain leading causes of mortality. Unstable plaques are inflamed and infiltrated with macrophages and T lymphocytes. Activated dendritic cells interact with T cells, yielding predominantly Th1 responses involving interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), while the role of interleukin 17 (IL-17) is questionable. The expansion of CD28nullCD4 or CD8 T cells as well as pattern recognition receptors activation (especially Toll-like receptors; TLR2 and TLR4) is characteristic for unstable plaque. Inflammation modifies platelet and fibrin clot characteristics, which are critical for ACS. Understanding of the inflammatory mechanisms of atherothrombosis, bridging inflammation, oxidative stress and immune regulation, will allow for the detection of subjects at risk, through the use of novel biomarkers and imaging techniques including intravascular ultrasound, molecular targeting, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). Moreover, understanding the specific inflammatory pathways of plaque rupture and atherothrombosis may allow for immunomodulation of ACS. Statins and anti-platelet drugs are anti-inflammatory, but importance of immune events in ACS warrants the introduction of novel, specific treatments directed either on cytokines, TLRs or inflammasomes. While the prime time for the introduction of immunologically inspired diagnostic tests and treatments for atherosclerosis have not come yet, we are closer than ever before to finally being able to benefit from this vast body of experimental and clinical evidence. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the role of the immune system and inflammation in ACS.", 
    "199": "Vascular oxidative stress is a key feature of atherogenesis, and targeting vascular redox signalling is a rational therapeutic goal in vascular disease pathogenesis. 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors or statins are potent lipid-lowering drugs that improve cardiovascular outcomes. It is now widely accepted that cardiovascular disease prevention by statins is dependent not only on their lipid lowering effects, but also on their beneficial effects on vascular redox signalling. Cell culture and animal models have provided important findings on the effects of statins on vascular redox and nitric oxide bioavailability. Recent evidence from studies on human vessels has further enhanced our understanding of the \"pleiotropic\" effects of statins on vascular wall. Reversal of endothelial dysfunction in human vessels by statins is dependent on the mevalonate pathway and Rac1 inhibition. These critical steps are responsible for reducing NADPH-oxidase activity and improving tetrahydrobiopterin bioavailability and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) coupling in human vessels. However, mevalonate pathway inhibition has been also held responsible for some of the side effects observed after statin treatment. In this review we summarise the existing knowledge on the effects of statins on vascular biology by discussing key findings from basic science as well as recent evidence from translational studies in humans. Finally, we discuss emerging aspects of statin pleiotropy, such as their effects on adipose tissue biology and adipokine synthesis that may light additional mechanistic links between statin treatment and improvement of clinical outcome in primary and secondary prevention.", 
    "200": "CETP is the target of CETP inhibitors such as anacetrapib and the modulator dalcetrapib. Both molecules have entered Phase III clinical trials, with the ultimate goal of reducing cardiovascular events by raising HDL cholesterol. At the 600-mg dose selected for the dal-OUTCOMES study, dalcetrapib is expected to inhibit CETP activity by approximately 30% and raise HDL-C by approximately 30% with limited effects on LDL cholesterol. Importantly, dalcetrapib does not raise blood pressure or aldosterone levels, two effects previously associated with the CETP inhibitor torcetrapib. Dalcetrapib has been well tolerated at the 600-mg dose. In the dal-PLAQUE atherosclerosis imaging study, dalcetrapib reduced the enlargement of total vessel area over time. In May 2012, following the results of the second interim analysis of dal-OUTCOMES, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board recommended stopping the study owing to a lack of clinically significant benefit, which was followed by Roche's (Basel, Switzerland) decision to terminate the study and the dalcetrapib program (dal-HEART). Contrary to anacetrapib, a potent CETP inhibitor that markedly increases HDL cholesterol and significantly reduces LDL cholesterol, dalcetrapib has allowed us to test the hypothesis that an isolated, moderate elevation in HDL cholesterol prevents cardiovascular events.",

Simvastatin inhibited the decrease of cell viability induced by MPP+ in PC12 cells. The damage of PC12 cells in morphology was alleviated and the apoptotic rates were decreased due to simvatatin pretreatment against MPP+ cytotoxicity. The reactive oxygen species production exposure to MPP+ was inhibited by simvatatin in PC12 cells. So simvastatin may be of therapeutic benefit for PD patients.",

The most important adverse effects associated with statins are myopathy and an asymptomatic increase in hepatic transaminases, both of which occur infrequently.

    "205": "A stability-indicating ultra-performance liquid chromatography method was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of a fixed dose combination of atorvastatin and ezetimibe in bulk drugs. The developed method was successfully applied to the simultaneous quantitative analysis of the combination drugs in tablet. The chromatographic separation was performed on a Kromasil Eternity C18 UHPLC column (2.5 \u00b5m, 2.1 \u00d7 50 mm) using a gradient elution of acetonitrile and ammonium acetate buffer (pH 6.70; 0.01M) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min with column oven temperature of 40\u00b0C. Ultraviolet detection was performed at 245 nm. Total run time was 5 min, within which the primary compounds and their degradation products were separated. The method was validated for accuracy, repeatability, reproducibility and robustness. Linearity, limit of detection and limit of quantitation were established for atorvastatin and ezetimibe.", 
    "206": "There are various opinions regarding the different functions of original and generic drugs. We used the paddle method to perform dissolution tests on pravastatin sodium tablets (10 mg) to investigate the causes for these differences. We used water and buffer solutions adjusted to pH 1.2 (JP1) and pH 6.8 (JP2), which are described in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia. The pravastatin concentration was measured by UV spectroscopy and HPLC. There were significant differences in the percentages dissolved of original and generic drugs after 5 and 10 min. On the other hand, the dissolution behaviors using water and JP2 measured by HPLC were similar to the results obtained by UV spectroscopy. However, the percentage dissolved of pravastatin using JP1 decreased with time because pravastatin degraded in JP1. There were also significant differences in the pravastatin concentrations of the original and generic drugs at 5, 15, 30, and 45 min. Based on the above results, since the original drug has a slower dissolution rate than the generic drugs, it is necessary to be cautious about the degradation of pravastatin in the stomach and the bioavailability of pravastatin due to the different dissolution rates and the different residual amount of pravastatin in the stomach.",

    "210": "A morbidly obese, diabetic, hypertensive patient, with severe intracranial left middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis, suffered recurrent stereotyped transient ischemic attacks over 2 months, despite taking daily antiplatelet agents, high dose statin, insulin and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. A left MCA (M1) Wingspan stent-assisted angioplasty was performed after standard loading, and daily doses of clopidogrel were given 3 days prior to the procedure. Immediately after the procedure, the patient developed a left hemispheric ischemic stroke syndrome. Urgent re-angiography identified an acute intracranial in-stent thrombosis. This complication was immediately treated successfully with abciximab and balloon angioplasty. The patient had persistent residual stroke despite complete recanalization of the thrombosed stent within 3 h of occlusion. The patient was subsequently found to have incomplete inhibition of platelet activity despite being on clopidogrel 150 mg and aspirin 81 mg daily and having a normal CYP-2C19 genotype, suggesting that suboptimal antiplatelet inhibition, secondary to morbid obesity, contributed to his in-stent thrombosis. Obese patients undergoing coronary artery stenting routinely receive larger loading and maintenance doses of clopidogrel. Our case suggests that obese patients undergoing intracranial stenting may also benefit from higher than conventional clopidogrel doses prior to intracranial stenting, to decrease risk of acute in-stent occlusion.", 
    "211": "Gymnopilin is one of the substances produced by the hallucinogenic mushroom, Gymnopilus junonius. In this study, we examined effects of gymnopilins purified from wild fruiting bodies of G. junonius on contractile activity of aorta preparations and blood pressure in rats. Gymnopilins at lower concentrations than 5\u2009mg/mL did not evoke contraction of helical strips of the thoracic aorta. In contrast, gymnopilins (5\u2009mg/mL) applied to the aorta strips pre-contracted by norepinephrine (100\u2009nM) caused relaxation. This relaxing action did not depend on the activity of the endothelium cells. The relaxing effect of 5-mg/mL gymnopilins was observed in aorta strips contracted by angiotensin II (10\u2009nM) and the high K+ solution (60\u2009mM). Moreover, the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor, SQ-22536, significantly inhibited the relaxing effect of gymnopilins at 1\u2009mg/mL on the norepinephrine-contracted strips. These results suggested that gymnopilins acted directly on smooth muscle cells of the aorta and activated the cAMP-dependent cascade to cause the vasodilation. Paradoxically, gymnopilins injection into the jugular vein transiently increased blood pressure without affecting the heart rate. This result suggests that gymnopilins increase cardiac output and/or tension of the artery through the excitation of the vasomotor nerve that overcame the direct relaxing effect on the vascular smooth muscle.", 
    "212": "gp78 is a membrane-anchored ubiquitin ligase mediating the degradation of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) and Insig-1. As a rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, HMGCR undergoes rapid sterol-promoted degradation. In contrast, destruction of Insig-1 releases its inhibition on SREBP and stimulates the expression of lipogenic genes. Thus, gp78 has opposite effects on lipid biosynthesis. We here generated liver-specific gp78 knockout (L-gp78(-/-)) mice and showed that although the degradation of HMGCR was blunted, SREBP was suppressed due to the elevation of Insig-1/-2, and therefore the lipid biosynthesis was decreased. The L-gp78(-/-) mice were protected from diet-/age-induced obesity and glucose intolerance. The livers of L-gp78(-/-) mice produced more FGF21, which activated thermogenesis in brown adipocytes and enhanced energy expenditure. Together, the major function of gp78 in liver is regulating lipid biosynthesis through SREBP pathway. Ablation of gp78 decreases the lipid levels and increases FGF21, and is beneficial to patients with metabolic diseases.",

Yet, it is unknown whether those at higher CVD risk - i.e. individuals in lower socio-economic position (SEP) - are adequately reached by this high-risk strategy. We aimed to examine whether the Danish implementation of the strategy to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD) by initiating statin (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor) therapy in high-risk individuals is equitable across socioeconomic groups.",

    "217": "Stratified by gender, 5-year age-groups and socioeconomic position (SEP), incidence of MI was applied as a proxy for statin need. Need-standardized statin incidence rates were calculated, applying MI incidence rate ratios (IRR) as need-weights to adjust for unequal needs across SEP.Horizontal equity in initiating statin therapy was tested by means of Poisson regression analysis. Applying the need-standardized statin parameters and the lowest SEP-group as reference, a need-standardized statin IRR\u2009>\u20091 translates into horizontal inequity favouring the higher SEP-groups.",

According to the regression analyses, the need-standardized statin incidence increased in men aged 40-64 by 17%, IRR 1.17 (95% CI: 1.14-1.19) with each increase in income quintile. In women the proportion was 23%, IRR 1.23 (1.16-1.29). An analogous pattern was seen applying education as SEP indicator and among subjects aged 65-84.",

The addition of fluvastatin to SOC treatment has been suggested to be effective for better outcome in retrospective pilot analyses. We investigated whether the combination of fluvastatin with PEG-IFN/ribavirin could actually improve sustained viral response (SVR) in patients with HCV genotype 1b and high viral load. A randomized, open-labeled, controlled study was conducted between July 2008 and December 2009 in 101 chronic hepatitis C patients allocated to PEG-IFN/ribavirin combination therapy with or without fluvastatin. SVR rates were calculated in groups, stratifying host and viral factors. We also analyzed predictive factors for SVR among patients on fluvastatin with multivariate regression analysis. Rapid and early virological, and end of treatment response rates in the fluvastatin group were not significantly different from those in the non-fluvastatin group. Notwithstanding, SVR rate was significantly higher in the fluvastatin group than in the non-fluvastatin group (63.0%vs 41.7%, P = 0.0422). Comparison of the two groups stratifying demographic data and HCV characteristics showed significantly higher SVR rates to more than 80% in males, more than two mutations in the interferon sensitivity determining region (ISDR), and a history of relapse among the fluvastatin group than the non-fluvastatin group. Being male and major genotype IL28B single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were independent predictive factors for SVR among patients on fluvastatin with multivariate analysis. Fluvastatin-combined with PEG-IFN/ribavirin therapy significantly improves SVR rates in patients with HCV genotype 1b and high viral load. Male and major genotype IL28B SNPs were independent predictors for SVR among patients on fluvastatin combination therapy.",

However, the expression of PUMA in cardiomyocytes under mechanical stress is little known. We aimed to investigate the regulation mechanism of PUMA expression and apoptosis induced by mechanical stress in cardiomyocytes.",

    "223": "PUMA protein and mRNA were up-regulated in the shunt group as compared with sham group. The increased PUMA protein expression and apoptosis induced by shunt was reversed by treatment with atorvastatin at 30 mg/kg/ day orally for 7 days. TUNEL assay showed that treatment with atorvastatin inhibited the apoptosis induced by volume overload. Cyclic stretch significantly enhanced PUMA protein and gene expression. Addition of c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP600125, JNK small interfering RNA (siRNA) and interferon-\u03b3 (INF-\u03b3) antibody 30 min before stretch reduced the induction of PUMA protein. Gel shift assay demonstrated that stretch increased the DNA binding activity of interferon regulatory factor-1. Stretch increased, while PUMA-Mut plasmid, SP600125 and INF-\u03b3 antibody abolished the PUMA promoter activity induced by stretch. PUMA mediated apoptosis induced by stretch was reversed by PUMA siRNA and atorvastatin.",

Similarly, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) has significant beneficial effects on endothelial function. A stressful lifestyle is a well-known risk factor for the presence and progression of atherosclerosis. This study investigated the effect of AGE plus CoQ10 on vascular elasticity measured by pulse-wave velocity (PWV) and endothelial function measured by digital thermal monitoring (DTM) in firefighters.",

The firefighters were randomized to four tablets of AGE (300 mg/tablet) plus CoQ10 (30 mg/tablet) or placebo. The participants underwent quarterly visits and 1-year follow-up. PWV and DTM were measured at baseline and at the 1-year follow-up.", 
    "231": "There were no significant differences in age, cardiovascular risk factors, PWV, and DTM between the AGE/CoQ10 and placebo groups at baseline (P > 0.5). At 1-y, PWV and DTM significantly improved in the AGE/CoQ10 compared with the placebo group (P < 0.05). After an adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors and statin therapy, the mean decrease in vascular stiffness (PWV) was 1.21 m/s in the AGE/CoQ10 compared with the placebo group (P = 0.005). Similarly, the mean increase in the area under the temperature curve, the DTM index of endothelial function, was 31.3 in the AGE/CoQ10 compared with the placebo group (P = 0.01).",
