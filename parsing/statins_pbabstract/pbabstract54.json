In addition, adults with diabetes frequently exhibit the pattern of elevated triglycerides, small dense LDL, and reduced levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), also known as diabetic dyslipidemia. The role of combination therapy with an additional agent such as niacin, ezetimibe, fenofibrate, and n-3 fatty acids have been extensively studied with disappointing results. Review of key trials assessing benefit of combination therapy to reduce CVD risk from dyslipidemia is performed. While combination therapy frequently results in an improvement in lipid profile, to date, no consistent improvement in clinical outcomes has been observed. Therefore, current guidelines do not recommend combination therapy in individuals with diabetes, highlighting the role of intensifying statin therapy and lifestyle interventions. The recently released The IMProved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial (IMPROVE IT) demonstrated a small but significant improvement in clinical endpoints with addition of ezetimibe to statins in high-risk patients. Although this trial was not specifically targeted towards patients with diabetes, the results may influence the future role of a combination therapy in such a population.", 
    "5": "Despite the efficacy of statins in reducing cardiovascular events in both primary and secondary prevention, the adherence to statin therapy is not optimal, mainly due to the occurrence of muscular adverse effects. Several risk factors may concur to the development of statin-induced myotoxicity, including patient-related factors (age, sex, and race), statin properties (dose, lipophilicity, and type of metabolism), and the concomitant administration of other drugs. Thus, the management of patients intolerant to statins, particularly those at high or very high cardiovascular risk, involves alternative therapies, including the switch to another statin or the use of intermittent dosage statin regimens, as well as nonstatin lipid lowering drugs (ezetimibe and fibrates) or new hypolipidemic drugs such as PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies, the antisense oligonucleotide against the coding region of human apolipoprotein B mRNA (mipomersen), and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor lomitapide. Ongoing clinical trials will reveal whether the lipid-lowering effects of alternative therapies to statins can also translate into a cardiovascular benefit.",

Targets of these miRNAs were predicted by algoritms: Targetscan, Miranda and Diana microT, then clustered according to functions and cell types by using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). To reveal the enriched function pathways in human atherosclerotic plaque, we analyzed microarray data from GEO database, Coronary atherosclerotic plaque (n\u2009=\u200980); macrophages in ruptured plaque (n\u2009=\u200911); carotid atheroma plaque (n\u2009=\u200964); advanced carotid atherosclerotic plaque (n\u2009=\u200929) using Reactome database. Integrated analysis indicated that statin induced miRNAs mainly regulate the signaling pathways of Rho GTPase and hemostasis in human atherosclerotic lesion. In vulnerable plaque, additional immune system signaling was also targeted.",

Whether suboptimal calibration will lead to overtreatment with statins is unknown. We investigated the numbers of people eligible for statin treatment in the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort, based on the 2013 cholesterol guidelines, and estimated the proportion that may be overtreated as a result of potential miscalibration of the ASCVD estimator.",

Hosmer-Lemeshow chi-square statistics were 16.3 in men (340 predicted versus 285 observed events) and 29.1 in women (166 predicted versus 112 observed events). Overprediction predominantly occurred among women in the highest risk decile and among men in the \u22657th risk deciles, for which observed ASCVD event rates were \u22657.5%. In total, 2615 participants (36%; 867 women) were eligible for statins based on the new guidelines. Of these, 171 women (20%) and 154 men (9%) were reclassified downward (as not eligible for statin therapy) using a recalibrated ASCVD estimator. In the latter group, 18 women (10.5%; 95% CI 5.9% to 15.2%) and 11 men (7.1%; 95% CI 3.0% to 11.3%) experienced ASCVD.",

The association between initial LDL-C and statin treatment in patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)/unstable angina pectoris (UAP) has not been well characterized. We explored detailed LDL-C levels and statin treatment in 22,938 patients with NSTEMI/UAP enrolled in the Can Rapid Risk Stratification of Unstable Angina Patients Suppress Adverse Outcomes With Early Implementation of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines Registry (2003 to 2006). Patients reporting home statin use or previous cardiovascular disease were excluded. We examined statin receipt at discharge across 4 categories of baseline LDL-C: very low (<70\u00a0mg/dl), low (70 to 99\u00a0mg/dl), high (100 to 129\u00a0mg/dl), and very high (\u2265130\u00a0mg/dl). The largest proportion of patients had LDL-C \u2265130\u00a0mg/dl (32.6%), followed by LDL-C 100 to 129\u00a0mg/dl (32.1%), LDL-C 70 to 99\u00a0mg/dl (24.9%), and LDL-C <70\u00a0mg/dl (10.4%). Compared with high LDL-C categories, patients in the lowest LDL-C category had their first NSTEMI/UAP event at a significantly older age and had higher rates of other cardiovascular risk factors (including hypertension and diabetes) but were less likely to have a family history of coronary artery disease. Overall, 80.3% of eligible patients with NSTEMI/UAP received statins at discharge, ranging from 63.8% in those with very low LDL-C (<70\u00a0mg/dl) to 88.1% in those with very high LDL-C (>130\u00a0mg/dl). In conclusion, >1/3 of patients with NSTEMI/UAP had an LDL-C level <100. Those with low LDL-C were older, had more co-morbidities, and were less likely to be prescribed a statin at discharge than those with higher LDL-C.",

High-intensity statins, such as atorvastatin 80\u200amg and rosuvastatin 20\u200amg, are associated with a higher excess risk of diabetes than moderate-intensity statins, such as atorvastatin 10\u200amg, simvastatin 20-40\u200amg, or pravastatin 40\u200amg.", 
    "83": "Multiple mechanisms have been proposed for statin-associated diabetes risk, primarily related to increased insulin resistance or impaired insulin secretion. Genetic polymorphisms with reduced HMG CoA reductase function are associated with weight gain, insulin resistance, and diabetes. Animal models have shown that HMG CoA inhibition has multiple downstream effects that may increase diabetes risk. Statin impairment of insulin signaling, decreased adipocyte differentiation, decreased pancreatic \u03b2-cell insulin secretion, and other effects have also been found. The excess risk of diabetes appears to be confined to those who are already at risk for developing diabetes. Diabetes is diagnosed only 2-4 months earlier in statin-treated patients and therefore is unlikely to have no long-term adverse consequences.",

One large trial demonstrated that simvastatin/ezetimibe reduced cardiovascular events in a broad spectrum of CKD patients. A recent meta-analysis concluded that CKD patients benefit from statins, and that the relative benefit decreases as the severity of CKD worsens. In large trials, statin-treated patients have slightly less worsening of renal function overtime, and there are data to suggest that statins actually do not only preserve, but also increase renal function. Recent guidelines recommend a statin for CKD patients aged 50 years or older, for younger patients with known vascular disease, diabetes, or a 10-year risk greater than 10%, and for adult renal transplant recipients.",

Patients in the control group receive a brief extract of recommendations of the German National Disease Management Guideline on the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. Primary outcome measure is adherence to blood pressure treatment and statin treatment at 6 months follow-up. Secondary outcome measures comprise informed choice and the achievement of patients' treatment goals. Analyses will be carried out on intention-to-treat basis. Concurrent qualitative methods will be used to explore the implementation processes.",

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) was used to investigate mRNA expressions of pro-inflammatory genes (ICAM-1, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1). Conditioned medium (CM) from PA-treated PRHs was applied to cultured rat hepatic stellate cell line, HSC-T6, with or without Flu-pretreatment for 2 h. Pro-fibrogenic gene expressions (COL1, TIMP-1, TGF-\u03b21, \u03b1-SMA) and protein expression of \u03b1-SMA were analyzed. In vivo study using choline-deficient L-amino acid defined (CDAA) diet-induced rat NASH model was performed by randomly assigning Wistar rats (n = 28) to normal controls (n = 4), CDAA diet with vehicles, and CDAA diet with Flu (5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg) (n = 8 each) through gavage for 4 or 8 weeks.

Moreover, \u03b1-SMA protein expression was significantly decreased in HSC-T6 cultured with CM from PA-Flu-treated PRHs compared to those cultured with CM from PA-treated PRHs. Flu also reduced steatosis and fibrosis scores, \u03b1-SMA protein expression, mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic genes in livers of CDAA rats.",

    "96": "Stroke is the second most common cause of death in people over 45 years of age in Colombia and is the leading cause of permanent disability worldwide. Cerebral ischemia is a stroke characterized by decreased blood flow due to the occlusion of one or more cerebral arteries, which can cause memory problems and hemiplegia or paralysis, among other impairments. The literature contains hundreds of therapies (invasive and noninvasive) that exhibit a neuroprotective effect when evaluated in animal models. However, in clinical trials, most of these drugs do not reproduce the previously demonstrated neuroprotective property, and some even have adverse effects that had not previously been detected in animal experimentation.Statins are drugs that inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. Several studies have shown that statin therapy in an animal model of focal cerebral ischemia reduces infarct volume, as well as markers of neurodegeneration, activates neuronal survival pathways, and improves performance on learning and memory tests. Given the implied therapeutic benefit and the limited understanding of the mechanism of action of statins in brain repair, it is necessary to address the biochemical and tissue effects of these drugs on synaptic proteins, such as NMDA receptors, synaptic adhesion proteins, and cytoskeletal proteins; these proteins are highly relevant therapeutic targets, which, in addition to giving a structural account of synaptic connectivity and function, are also indicators of cellular communication and the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, which are widely affected in the long term post-cerebral infarct but, interestingly, are protected by statins when administered during the acute phase.",

The in vitro HMGR inhibition and enzyme kinetic assay was determined using HMG-CoA as substrate. In addition, antioxidant activity of the new isolated compound, was measured using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay and FRAP value. In-silico molecular informatics of HMGR enzyme type inhibition and pharmacokinetics data of the new compound was further evaluated through molecular docking and ADME-T studies.

This inhibitor exhibited not only higher free radical scavenging activity but also marked HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 84\u00b12.8 ng/ml. This inhibitory activity concurred with kinetic study that showed inhibition constant (K i) of 84 ng/ml via an uncompetitive mode of inhibition. The inhibition was also corroborated by molecular docking analysis and in silico pharmacokinetics data. The in vivo study revealed that administration of FVBM extract (at higher dose, 100 mg/rat) and the inhibitor (1 mg/rat) to Triton WR-1339-induced hyperlipidemic rats significantly ameliorated the altered levels of plasma lipids and lipoproteins including hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity; this effect was comparable to the effect of standard drug atorvastatin.",

Visit-to-visit LDL-C variability was evaluated from 3 months into random assignment through the use of various measurements of LDL-C variability: SD, average successive variability (ASV), coefficient of variation, and variation independent of mean, with the first 2 measurements used as the primary measurements. Primary outcome was any coronary event, and secondary outcomes were any cardiovascular event, death, myocardial infarction, or stroke.",

    "137": "Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is an autosomal co-dominant disorder that markedly raises plasma low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration, causing premature atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD). FH has recently come under intense focus and, although there is general consensus in recent international guidelines regarding diagnosis and treatment, there is debate about the value of genetic studies. Genetic testing can be cost-effective as part of cascade screening in dedicated centres, but the full mutation spectrum responsible for FH has not been established in many populations, and its use in primary care is not at present logistically feasible. Whether using genetic testing or not, cholesterol screening of family members of index patients with an abnormally raised LDL-C must be used to determine the need for early treatment to prevent the development of CAD. The metabolic defects in FH extend beyond LDL, and may affect triacylglycerol-rich and high-density lipoproteins, lipoprotein(a) and oxidative stress. Achievement of the recommended targets for LDL-C with current treatments is difficult, but this may be resolved by new drug therapies. Lipoprotein apheresis remains an effective treatment for severe FH and, although expensive, it costs less than the two recently introduced orphan drugs (lomitapide and mipomersen) for homozygous FH. Recent advances in understanding of the biology of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) have further elucidated the regulation of lipoprotein metabolism and led to new drugs for effectively treating hypercholesterolaemia in FH and related conditions, as well as for treating many patients with statin intolerance. The mechanisms of action of PCSK9 inhibitors on lipoprotein metabolism and atherosclerosis, as well as their impact on cardiovascular outcomes and cost-effectiveness, remain to be established.", 
    "138": "The present study aimed to investigate the possible influence of several inhibitors and blockers on the vascular effect produced by the acute in vitro application of rosuvastatin to phenylephrine-precontracted aortic rings from rats with a semi-solid, cafeteria-style (CAF) diet. It also aimed to examine the effects of rosuvastatin on the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), inducible nitric oxide synthase, constitutive cyclooxygenase, and inducible cyclooxygenase in aortic rings from rats with a CAF diet. From comparisons of the effect on phenylephrine-precontracted aortic rings extracted from rats with two different diets (a standard and a CAF diet), it was found that 10(-9) -10(-5) -mol/L rosuvastatin produced lower concentration-dependent vasorelaxation on rings from the CAF diet group. The vasorelaxant effect was unaffected by the vehicle, but it was significantly attenuated by 10(-5) -mol/L N(G) -nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, 10(-2) -mol/L tetraethylammonium, 10(-3) -mol/L 4-aminopyridine, 10(-7) -mol/L apamin plus 10(-7) -mol/L charybdotoxin, 10(-5) -mol/L indomethacin, or 10(-5) -mol/L cycloheximide. Moreover, in aortic rings from rats with a CAF diet, rosuvastatin enhanced the expression of eNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase, constitutive cyclooxygenase, and inducible cyclooxygenase. The acute in vitro application of rosuvastatin to phenylephrine-precontracted aortic rings from rats with a CAF diet had a vasorelaxant effect. Overall, the present results suggest that the stimulation of eNOS, the opening of Ca(2+) -activated and voltage-activated K(+) channels, the stimulation of prostaglandin synthesis and enhanced protein levels of eNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase, constitutive cyclooxygenase, and inducible cyclooxygenase are involved in this relaxant effect.",

This publication bias is more prominent in non-industry sponsored studies. Industry and non-industry funded researchers may have different incentives for publication. Industry may have a financial interest to publish all preclinical animal studies to maximize the success of subsequent trials in humans, whereas non-industry funded academics may prefer to publish high impact statistically significant results only. Differences in previously published effect estimates between industry- and non-industry sponsored animal studies may be partially explained by publication bias.",

    "169": "RAS proteins require membrane association for their biologic activity, making this association a logical target for anti-RAS therapeutics. Lipid modification of RAS proteins by a farnesyl isoprenoid is an obligate step in that association, and is an enzymatic process. Accordingly, farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTI) were developed as potential anti-RAS drugs. The lack of efficacy of FTIs as anticancer drugs was widely seen as indicating that blocking RAS membrane association was a flawed approach to cancer treatment. However, a deeper understanding of RAS modification and trafficking has revealed that this was an erroneous conclusion. In the presence of FTIs, KRAS and NRAS, which are the RAS isoforms most frequently mutated in cancer, become substrates for alternative modification, can still associate with membranes, and can still function. Thus, FTIs failed not because blocking RAS membrane association is an ineffective approach, but because FTIs failed to accomplish that task. Recent findings regarding RAS isoform trafficking and the regulation of RAS subcellular localization have rekindled interest in efforts to target these processes. In particular, improved understanding of the palmitoylation/depalmitoylation cycle that regulates RAS interaction with the plasma membrane, endomembranes, and cytosol, and of the potential importance of RAS chaperones, have led to new approaches. Efforts to validate and target other enzymatically regulated posttranslational modifications are also ongoing.

As a result, many of these patients lose weight intentionally in an effort to gain candidacy on the transplant waiting list. This frequently produces a panniculus encompassing the lower abdominal surgical site used for renal transplantation. These patients are declined for renal transplantation secondary to predictable wound-healing complications.",

Since that time, we have successfully performed 21 panniculectomies in renal transplant candidates (5 men and 16 women) with an average age of 55 years (range, 27-67 years) and an average body mass index of 30.2 kg/m2 (range, 24.5-38.7 kg/m2) after significant weight loss, with an average maximum weight loss before panniculectomy of 37.7 kg (range, 5.5-83.2 kg), and median body mass index decrease before panniculectomy of 14 kg/m (range, 2.0-23.6 kg/m2).",

Seventeen patients have been relisted on the transplant waiting list. Of the patients who have not been relisted on the transplant waiting list, no patient had his or her candidacy delayed secondary to complications of their panniculectomy.

    "195": "Plasticity of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) plays a central role in the onset and progression of proliferative vascular diseases. In adult tissue, VSMCs exist in a physiological contractile-quiescent phenotype, which is defined by lack of the ability of proliferation and migration, while high expression of contractile marker proteins. After injury to the vessel, VSMC shifts from a contractile phenotype to a pathological synthetic phenotype, associated with increased proliferation, migration and matrix secretion. It has been demonstrated that PDGF-BB is a critical mediator of VSMCs phenotypic switch. Atorvastatin calcium, a selective inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl l coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, exhibits various protective effects against VSMCs. In this study, we investigated the effects of atorvastatin calcium on phenotype modulation of PDGF-BB-induced VSMCs and the related intracellular signal transduction pathways. Treatment of VSMCs with atorvastatin calcium showed dose-dependent inhibition of PDGF-BB-induced proliferation. Atorvastatin calcium co-treatment inhibited the phenotype modulation and cytoskeleton rearrangements and improved the expression of contractile phenotype marker proteins such as \u03b1-SM actin, SM22\u03b1 and calponin in comparison with PDGF-BB alone stimulated VSMCs. Although Akt phosphorylation was strongly elicited by PDGF-BB, Akt activation was attenuated when PDGF-BB was co-administrated with atorvastatin calcium. In conclusion, atorvastatin calcium inhibits phenotype modulation of PDGF-BB-induced VSMCs and activation of the Akt signaling pathway, indicating that Akt might play a vital role in the modulation of phenotype.", 
    "196": "Atorvastatin, traditionally used to treat hyperlipidemia, belongs to a class of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors. This study investigated the antineuroinflammatory and antihyperalgesic effects of atorvastatin in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and spinal cord for chronic constriction injury (CCI) neuropathic pain in rats. Fifty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups including sham, CCI, and CCI+atorvastatin. Rats were orally administered atorvastatin (10 mg/kg/day) once daily for 2 weeks after surgery and sacrificed at days 3, 7, and 14. All animals were assessed for mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in both hindpaws. Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to detect inflammatory proteins and proinflammatory cytokines at day 7 after surgery. Pain behaviors were significantly reduced in the CCI+atorvastatin group compared to the CCI group. Atorvastatin attenuated CCI-induced inflammatory mediators (pAkt/Akt, COX-2, iNOS, EP1, and EP4) and reduced proinflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 levels in DRG and spinal cord. Atorvastatin also inhibited nuclear pNF\u03baB activation. Double immunofluorescent staining further demonstrated that pNF\u03baB proteins were decreased by atorvastatin in DRG satellite cells and spinal microglia. Atorvastatin may primarily inhibit the nuclear translocation of pNF\u03baB to prevent CCI-induced peripheral neuropathic pain. Atorvastatin exhibits antineuroinflammatory and antinociceptive properties in the central and peripheral nerve systems.", 
    "197": "Activation of macrophage adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (FABP4) induces development of atherosclerosis in animal models. We previously reported that statin inhibited while dexamethasone activated macrophage FABP4 expression. However, co-treatment of macrophages with statin and dexamethasone induced FABP4 expression in a synergistic manner, which implies that this co-treatment may exacerbate high-fat diet (HFD)-induced atherosclerosis. In this study, we fed apoE-deficient (apoE) mice with HFD or HFD containing dexamethasone or pitavastatin or both for 16 weeks. Compared with HFD alone, pitavastatin or dexamethasone had little effect on lesions in both en face aortas and aortic root cross sections. However, the co-treatment exacerbated HFD-induced lesions. In addition, the co-treatment decreased collagen content and disturbed the integrity of lesion caps. Both serum total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels were reduced by pitavastatin and increased by dexamethasone, respectively. However, the co-treatment had little effect on both total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels, indicating that the exacerbation of lesions is independent of total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol levels. FABP4 expression in aortic lesion area was significantly induced by the co-treatment, suggesting that activation of FABP4 expression is a main contributor to lesions. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that co-treatment of pitavastatin and dexamethasone exacerbates HFD-induced atherosclerosis and defines a potential risk to use the dual treatment for patients in clinics.", 
    "198": "Statins are widely used hypocholesterolemic drugs that block the mevalonate pathway, responsible for the biosysnthesis of cholesterol. However, statins also have pleiotropic effects that interfere with several signaling pathways. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are a heterogeneous mixture of cells that can be isolated from a variety of tissues and are identified by the expression of a panel of surface markers and by their ability to differentiate in vitro into osteocytes, adipocytes and chondrocytes. MSC were isolated from amniotic membranes and bone marrows and characterized based on ISCT (International Society for Cell Therapy) minimal criteria. Simvastatin-treated cells and controls were directly assayed by CFSE (Carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester) staining to assess their cell proliferation and their RNA was used for microarray analyses and quantitative PCR (qPCR). These MSC were also evaluated for their ability to inhibit PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) proliferation. We show here that simvastatin negatively modulates MSC proliferation in a dose-dependent way and regulates the expression of proliferation-related genes. Importantly, we observed that simvastatin increased the percentage of a subset of smaller MSC, which also were actively proliferating. The association of MSC decreased size with increased pluripotency and the accumulating evidence that statins may prevent cellular senescence led us to hypothesize that simvastatin induces a smaller subpopulation that may have increased ability to maintain the entire pool of MSC and also to protect them from cellular senescence induced by long-term cultures/passages in vitro. These results may be important to better understand the pleiotropic effects of statins and its effects on the biology of cells with regenerative potential.", 
    "199": "Statins are widely used to prevent cardiovascular disease. In addition to their inhibitory effects on cholesterol synthesis, statins have beneficial effects in patients with sepsis and pneumonia, although molecular mechanisms have mostly remained unclear. Using human airway epithelial cells as a proper in vitro model, we show that prior exposure to physiological nanomolar serum concentrations of simvastatin (ranging from 10-1,000 nM) confers significant cellular resistance to the cytotoxicity of pneumolysin, a pore-forming toxin and the main virulence factor of Streptococcus pneumoniae. This protection could be demonstrated with a different statin, pravastatin, or on a different toxin, \u03b1-hemolysin. Furthermore, through the use of gene silencing, pharmacological inhibitors, immunofluorescence microscopy, and biochemical and metabolic rescue approaches, we demonstrate that the mechanism of protection conferred by simvastatin at physiological nanomolar concentrations could be different from the canonical mevalonate pathways seen in most other mechanistic studies conducted with statins at micromolar levels. All of these data are integrated into a protein synthesis-dependent, calcium-dependent model showing the interconnected pathways used by statins in airway epithelial cells to elicit an increased resistance to pore-forming toxins. This research fills large gaps in our understanding of how statins may confer host cellular protection against bacterial infections in the context of airway epithelial cells without the confounding effect from the presence of immune cells. In addition, our discovery could be potentially developed into a host-centric strategy for the adjuvant treatment of pore-forming toxin associated bacterial infections.", 
    "200": "The effect of statins occur in several stages: 1) inhibition in hepatocytes of synthesis of functionally specific pool of spirit cholesterol, polar mono-layer of lipoproteins of very low density; 2) activation of hydrolysis of triglycerides in lipoproteins of very low density, formation of apoE/B-100-ligand and absorption of lipoproteins of very low density by insulin-depended cells; 3) decreasing of content of and spirit cholesterol-lipoproteins of very low density in blood plasma; 4) activation of hydrolysis of triglycerides in lipoproteins of low density, formation of apoB-100-ligand and absorption of lipoproteins of low density by insulin-independent cells; 5) decreasing of level of and increasing of content of lipoproteins of high density. During first weeks of effect of statins occurs decreasing of concentration of triglycerides and unesterified spirit cholesterol-lipoproteins of very low density in blood plasma. Then, slower and more durational decreasing of level of spirit cholesterol-lipoproteins of low density occurs. The value of spirit cholesterol-lipoproteins of low density is primarily determined by content of palmitic saturated fatty acid in food, its endogenous synthesis from glucose and concentration of palmitic triglycerides and lipoproteins of very low density of the same name in blood plasma. The effect of preparations is biologically valid and corresponds to alternative hypolipidemic preparations. All these preparations have an effect following a common algorithm: they activate, using different mechanisms, receptor absorption of lipoproteins of very low density or lipoproteins of low density by cells. The level of spirit cholesterol-lipoproteins of low density in full measure depends on content of triglycerides in blood. The concentration of spirit cholesterol in blood plasma has a reliable diagnostic significance only under physiological content of triglycerides. The main criterion of diagnostic and control of hypolipidemic therapy biologically is content of triglycerides. The comprehension of differences in effect of hypolipidemic preparations within framework of common algorithm permits rationally combine them under treatment of both primary inheritable phenotypes of glucolipoproteins and secondary symptomatic types of glucolipoproteins under obligatory observation of strict dietary treatment.",

We analyzed sex differences in pharmacotherapy strategies and attainment of goals for hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), blood pressure (BP), and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients with type 2 diabetes and established coronary artery disease enrolled into the BARI 2D trial. Results. Similar numbers of drugs were prescribed in both women and men. Women were less frequent on metformin or sulfonylurea and more likely to take insulin and to be on higher doses of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) than men. After adjusting for baseline differences and treatment prescribed, women were less likely to achieve goals for HbA1c (OR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.57, 0.88) and LDL-C (OR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.53, 0.78). More antihypertensives were prescribed to women, and yet BP \u2264 130/80\u2009mmHg did not differ by sex. Conclusions. Women entering the BARI 2D trial were as aggressively treated with drugs as men. Despite equivalent treatment, women less frequently met targets for HbA1c and LDL-C. Our findings suggest that there may be sex differences in response to drug therapies used to treat diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.",

    "249": "The majority of patients were aged \u226540 years (93.1%), had a body mass index of \u226530 (58.7%), had hypertension (65.6%), and did not have hyperlipidemia (54.0%). A low percentage of patients were prescribed a statin (35.1%), but it appears that this percentage is on the rise. During 2005-2007, 31.9% of patients received a statin, whereas 37.7% of patients received a statin during 2008-2010. After adjustment for covariates included in the multivariate logistic regression model, those with hypertension (vs none [reference]: OR = 1.31; 95% CI, 1.12-1.53) and/or hyperlipidemia (vs none [reference]: OR = 4.44; 95% CI, 3.70-5.33) were significantly more likely to have been prescribed a statin, whereas those in age group 18-<40 years (vs 40-<65 years [reference]: OR = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.31-0.65) and Hispanic/Latino patients (vs non-Hispanic/Latino patients [reference]: OR = 0.77; 95% CI, 0.61-0.97) were significantly less likely to have been prescribed a statin.", 
    "250": "Despite the call in the latest ADA recommendations for prescribing statins in many diabetic patients, an unexpectedly low percentage of patients were receiving them. Health disparities in age and ethnicity were also evident. The findings from this study highlight the need for further research into low statin prescribing rates.", 
    "251": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG Co-A) reductase inhibitors have preconditioning effects involving up-regulation of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. We investigated the effect of selective and non-selective COX inhibition on rosuvastatin-mediated protection against ischemia-reperfusion (IR)-induced endothelial dysfunction in the human forearm. Healthy volunteers (n=66) were allocated to placebo, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 81mg daily, ASA 325mg daily, celecoxib 200mg twice daily or 400mg ibuprofen four times daily, each administered for 5 to 7days. On the last day of study drug therapy, subjects received a single dose of 40mg rosuvastatin. Twenty-four hours later flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the radial artery was evaluated before and after IR. In the placebo group, FMD was similar before and after IR (8.1\u00b11.0 vs 7.2\u00b10.8%; P=NS) indicating a significant protective effect of rosuvastatin. There was also no effect of IR on FMD in the ASA 81mg group (6.7\u00b10.6 vs 6.1\u00b10.7%; P=NS). In contrast, following IR there was a significant decrease in FMD in the ASA 325mg group (7.2\u00b10.8 vs 3.3\u00b10.7%, P<0.001), the celecoxib group (7.3\u00b11.5 vs 2.6\u00b11.5%, P<0.01) as well as the ibuprofen group (6.8\u00b10.7 vs 2.6\u00b10.8%; P<0.01). Therefore, nonselective COX inhibition with ASA 325mg and ibuprofen completely inhibit the protective effects of rosuvastatin in the setting of IR injury, as does therapy with the specific COX-2 antagonist celecoxib. In contrast, therapy with low dose ASA (81mg daily) does not have such inhibitory effects.", 
    "252": "We have recently reported that pre-treatment, but not the post-treatment with atorvastatin showed survival benefit and improved hemodynamic functions in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model of sepsis in mice. Here we examined whether combined treatment with atorvastatin and imipenem after onset of sepsis can prolong survival and improve vascular functions. At 6 and 18h after sepsis induction, treatment with atorvastatin plus imipenem, atorvastatin or imipenem alone or placebo was initiated. Ex vivo experiments were done on mouse aorta to examine the vascular reactivity to nor-adrenaline and acetylcholine and mRNA expressions of \u03b11D AR, GRK2 and eNOS. Atorvastatin plus imipenem extended the survival time to 56.00\u00b14.62h from 20.00\u00b11.66h observed in CLP mice. The survival time with atorvastatin or imipenem alone was 20.50\u00b11.89h and 27.00\u00b14.09h, respectively. The combined treatment reversed the hyporeactivity to nor-adrenaline through preservation of \u03b11D AR mRNA/protein expression and reversal of \u03b11D AR desensitization mediated by GRK2/G\u03b2\u03b3 pathway. The treatment also restored endothelium-dependent relaxation to ACh through restoration of aortic eNOS mRNA expression and NO availability. In conclusion, combined treatment with atorvastatin and imipenem exhibited survival benefit and improved vascular functions in septic mice.", 
    "253": "Critical limb ischemia (CLI) encompasses the most extreme end of the peripheral artery disease (PAD) spectrum leading to significant morbidity and mortality. CLI is defined as greater than 2 weeks of extremity rest pain, ulcers or extremity gangrene, secondary to objectively proven peripheral artery disease. Corresponding to Fontaine Stages III/IV and Rutherford category IV through VI, CLI is a complex disease comprising of both macrovascular and microvascular systems with inconsistent historical data on optimal treatment. CLI is distinct from intermittent claudication with different goals of treatment, however in both groups risk factor modification is of the utmost importance involving tobacco cessation, and treatment of underlying conditions like diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia and hypertension. In CLI, medical therapy involves wound care and also consists of antiplatelet therapy, anti-inflammatory therapy including statin use or ACE inhibitors. Surgical therapies include distal bypass surgery, thromboendartectomy and amputation. Endovascular techniques include percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, bare metal stents, atherectomy, drug-coated balloon and drug-eluting stents. CLI is considered the end-stage of PAD, requiring a thoughtful and multidisciplinary approach, risk-benefit analysis and treatment of comorbid conditions. Conservative and surgical treatments, along with endovascular techniques, have allowed excellent opportunities for treating complicated patients for wound healing and limb salvage.", 
    "254": "Lovastatin, composed of secondary metabolites produced by filamentous fungi, is the most frequently used drug for hypercholesterolemia treatment due to the fact that lovastatin is a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. Moreover, recent studies have shown several important applications for lovastatin including antimicrobial agents and treatments for cancers and bone diseases. Studies regarding the lovastatin biosynthetic pathway have also demonstrated that lovastatin is synthesized from two-chain reactions using acetate and malonyl-CoA as a substrate. It is also known that there are two key enzymes involved in the biosynthetic pathway called polyketide synthases (PKS). Those are characterized as multifunctional enzymes and are encoded by specific genes organized in clusters on the fungal genome. Since it is a secondary metabolite, cultivation process optimization for lovastatin biosynthesis has included nitrogen limitation and non-fermentable carbon sources such as lactose and glycerol. Additionally, the influences of temperature, pH, agitation/aeration, and particle and inoculum size on lovastatin production have been also described. Although many reviews have been published covering different aspects of lovastatin production, this review brings, for the first time, complete information about the genetic basis for lovastatin production, detection and quantification, strain screening and cultivation process optimization. Moreover, this review covers all the information available from patent databases covering each protected aspect during lovastatin bio-production.", 
    "255": "In Estonia, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are widely used to modify lipid levels but there are no current data on additional medicines prescribed alongside the statins. The aim of this study was to identify the frequency of potential clinically relevant interactions at a national level among an outpatient population treated with statins between January and June 2008, based on the prescription database of the Estonian Health Insurance Fund. This retrospective prevalence study included 203,646 outpatients aged 50 years or older, of whom 29,367 received statin therapy. The study analysed individuals who had used at least one prescription medicine for a minimum of 7 days concomitantly with statins. Potential drug interactions were analysed using Epocrates online, Stockley's Drug Interactions, and the drug interaction database developed in Estonia. Statins metabolised by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme were prescribed to 64% of all statin users. Medicines known to have potentially clinically significant interactions with statins were prescribed to 4.6% of patients. The drugs prescribed concomitantly most often with simvastatin were warfarin (5.7%) and amiodarone (3.9%), whereas digoxin (1.2%) and ethinylestradiol (2%) were prescribed with atorvastatin. Potential interactions were not detected in the treatment regimens of rosuvastatin, pravastatin, and fluvastatin users.", 
    "256": "Atherosclerotic diseases are common in pet psittacine birds, in particular Amazon parrots. While hypercholesterolemia and dyslipidemia have not definitely been associated with increased susceptibility to atherosclerosis in parrots, these are important and well-known risk factors in humans. Therefore statin drugs such as rosuvastatin constitute the mainstay of human treatment of dyslipidemia and the prevention of atherosclerosis. No pharmacologic studies have been performed in psittacine birds despite the high prevalence of atherosclerosis in captivity. Thirteen Hispaniolan Amazon parrots were used to test a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg of rosuvastatin with blood sampling performed according to a balanced incomplete block design over 36 hours. Because low plasma concentrations were produced in the first study, a subsequent pilot study using a dose of 25 mg/kg in 2 Amazon parrots was performed. Most plasma samples for the 10 mg/kg dose and all samples for the 25 mg/kg dose had rosuvastatin concentration below the limits of quantitation. For the 10 mg/kg study, the median peak plasma concentration and time to peak plasma concentration were 0.032 \u03bcg/mL and 2 hours, respectively. Our results indicate that rosuvastatin does not appear suitable in Amazon parrots as compounded and used at the dose in this study. Pharmacodynamic studies investigating lipid-lowering effects of statins rather than pharmacokinetic studies may be more practical and cost effective in future studies to screen for a statin with more ideal properties for potential use in psittacine dyslipidemia and atherosclerotic diseases.", 
    "257": "We examined a cohort of Australian patients with statin exposure who developed a necrotizing autoimmune myopathy (NAM) associated with a novel autoantibody against 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) and describe the clinical and therapeutic challenges of managing these patients and an optimal therapeutic strategy.", 
    "258": "Clinical, laboratory, EMG, and histopathologic results and response to immunomodulation are reported in 6 Australian patients with previous statin exposure and antibodies targeting HMGCR.", 
    "259": "All patients presented with painless proximal weakness following statin therapy, which persisted after statin cessation. Serum creatine kinase (CK) levels ranged from 2,700 to 16,200 IU/L. EMG was consistent with a myopathic picture. Muscle biopsies revealed a pauci-immune necrotizing myopathy. Detailed graphical representation of the clinical course of these patients showed a close association with rising CK and an increase in clinical weakness signifying relapses, particularly upon weaning or ceasing steroids. All 6 patients were responsive to initial steroid therapy, with 5 relapsing upon attempts to wean steroids. Both CK and clinical strength improved with the reinstitution of immunotherapy, in particular steroids and IV immunoglobulin (IVIg). All patients required treatment with varying multiagent immunosuppressive regimens to achieve clinical remission, including prednisone (n = 6), IVIg (n = 5), plasmapheresis (n = 2), and additional therapy including methotrexate (n = 6), cyclophosphamide (n = 2), rituximab (n = 2), azathioprine (n = 1), and cyclosporine (n = 1).", 
    "260": "Recognition of HMGCR antibody-associated NAM is important because these patients are responsive to immunosuppression, and early multiagent therapy and a slow and cautious approach to withdrawing steroids may improve outcomes.", 
    "261": "This is the third update of a planning-table for use in cholesterol-lowering therapy, so as to obtain LDLc objectives. This is an easy to use laptop tool to help choose the best statin or combination therapy (statin plus ezetimibe) depending on the current LDL concentration of the patient, and the LDLc objective to achieve. It is based on a colour code that indicates the drugs that are efficient enough to help patients to achieve their LDL goal. Along with the table, recommendations are given for the best strategy in order to implement the optimal therapy in a maximum of two clinical encounters.", 
    "262": "Interview with Professor Chris Packard, MD, PhD by Tanya Stezhka (Commissioning Editor) The IMPROVE-IT trial, launched 9 years ago, has finally provided physicians with long-term efficacy and safety evidence for ezetimibe. The large-scale study in acute-coronary-syndrome patients showed a clear benefit in reducing cardiovascular events when added to simvastatin in this population. The size of the benefit was proportionate to the reduction in LDL cholesterol. We spoke to Professor Chris Packard (University of Glasgow, UK) about his interest in the trial, and the importance of lowering LDL and research in the wider clinical context.", 
    "263": "We conducted an observational study of 30 heart transplant recipients with serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) >100\u00a0mg/dl despite previous statin therapy, who were treated with rosuvastatin 10\u00a0mg daily (5\u00a0mg in case of renal dysfunction). Serum lipids, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), bilirubin, and hepatic enzymes were prospectively measured 2, 4, and 12\u00a0weeks after the initiation of the drug. Clinical outcomes of patients who continued on long-term rosuvastatin therapy beyond this 12-week period were reviewed in February 2015. Over the 12-week period following rosuvastatin initiation, serum levels of total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-c and the ratio TC/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) decreased steadily (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Average absolute reductions of these three parameters were -48.7\u00a0mg/dl, -46.6\u00a0mg/dl, and -0.9, respectively. Seventeen (57%) achieved a serum LDL-c\u00a0<\u00a0100\u00a0mg/dl. No significant changes from baseline were observed in serum levels of triglycerides, HDL-c, hepatic enzymes, bilirubin, or CPK. Twenty-seven (90%) patients continued on long-term therapy with rosuvastatin over a median period of 3.6\u00a0years, with no further significant variation in lipid profile. The drug was suspended due to liver toxicity in 1 (3.3%) patient and due to muscle toxicity in 2 (6.7%) patients. All adverse reactions resolved rapidly after rosuvastatin withdrawal. Our study supports rosuvastatin as a reasonable alternative for heart transplant recipients with hypercholesterolemia and therapeutic failure of other statin regimens.", 
    "264": "This study evaluated whether statin therapy increases the risk of herpes zoster (HZ) infection in Asia. This retrospective cohort study used the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database (LHID2000). From the LHID2000, patients aged 20\u00a0years were divided into two cohorts according to their statin use and were matched at a 1:1 ratio according to propensity scores, which were calculated using a logistic regression for estimating the probability of treatment assignment. The primary outcome was HZ infection. All patients were followed from the index date until the date of HZ infection, withdrawal from the insurance system, or the end of 2011. The study included 53,069 patients receiving statin therapy as a statin cohort and 53,069 patients without statin therapy as a nonstatin cohort. The mean follow-up durations for the statin cohort and nonstatin cohort were 4.89 [standard deviation (SD)\u2009=\u20092.86] years and 4.75 (SD\u2009=\u20092.90) years, respectively. The patients in the statin cohort had a 21\u00a0% higher risk of contracting HZ infection than the patients in the nonstatin cohort [95\u00a0% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u20091.13-1.29]. The incidence of HZ infection increased with the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score in both cohorts. A high mean defined daily dose of the six types of statins considered in this study was associated with a significantly increased risk of HZ infection. Statin therapy can increase HZ infection in Asia. More benefit-risk evaluations for statin use are necessary in Asia."
