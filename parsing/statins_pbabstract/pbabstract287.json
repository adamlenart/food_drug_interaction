Arginine has been shown to have a wide variety of effects on the body, including impact on the cardiovascular system, the immune system, and wound healing. Recently it has also been shown to interact with popular pharmaceutical therapies (ie, statin drugs) in a positive way. Research indicates that arginine is safe and has positive effects on the body when used for relatively short periods of time. Data regarding arginine's safety with long-term use in pharmaceutical amounts is still not available for select patient populations (ie, cancer patients).", 
    "1": "Results of previous randomised trials have shown that interventions that lower LDL cholesterol concentrations can significantly reduce the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) and other major vascular events in a wide range of individuals. But each separate trial has limited power to assess particular outcomes or particular categories of participant.", 
    "2": "A prospective meta-analysis of data from 90,056 individuals in 14 randomised trials of statins was done. Weighted estimates were obtained of effects on different clinical outcomes per 1.0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol.", 
    "3": "During a mean of 5 years, there were 8186 deaths, 14,348 individuals had major vascular events, and 5103 developed cancer. Mean LDL cholesterol differences at 1 year ranged from 0.35 mmol/L to 1.77 mmol/L (mean 1.09) in these trials. There was a 12% proportional reduction in all-cause mortality per mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol (rate ratio [RR] 0.88, 95% CI 0.84-0.91; p<0.0001). This reflected a 19% reduction in coronary mortality (0.81, 0.76-0.85; p<0.0001), and non-significant reductions in non-coronary vascular mortality (0.93, 0.83-1.03; p=0.2) and non-vascular mortality (0.95, 0.90-1.01; p=0.1). There were corresponding reductions in myocardial infarction or coronary death (0.77, 0.74-0.80; p<0.0001), in the need for coronary revascularisation (0.76, 0.73-0.80; p<0.0001), in fatal or non-fatal stroke (0.83, 0.78-0.88; p<0.0001), and, combining these, of 21% in any such major vascular event (0.79, 0.77-0.81; p<0.0001). The proportional reduction in major vascular events differed significantly (p<0.0001) according to the absolute reduction in LDL cholesterol achieved, but not otherwise. These benefits were significant within the first year, but were greater in subsequent years. Taking all years together, the overall reduction of about one fifth per mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction translated into 48 (95% CI 39-57) fewer participants having major vascular events per 1000 among those with pre-existing CHD at baseline, compared with 25 (19-31) per 1000 among participants with no such history. There was no evidence that statins increased the incidence of cancer overall (1.00, 0.95-1.06; p=0.9) or at any particular site.", 
    "4": "Statin therapy can safely reduce the 5-year incidence of major coronary events, coronary revascularisation, and stroke by about one fifth per mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol, largely irrespective of the initial lipid profile or other presenting characteristics. The absolute benefit relates chiefly to an individual's absolute risk of such events and to the absolute reduction in LDL cholesterol achieved. These findings reinforce the need to consider prolonged statin treatment with substantial LDL cholesterol reductions in all patients at high risk of any type of major vascular event.", 
    "5": "This pooled analysis of 30 completed clinical trials assessed the efficacy and safety of fluvastatin in patients <65 (n = 8,037) and patients > or =65 years of age (n = 3,717). The results demonstrated that in patients > or =65 years of age, lipid changes with fluvastatin therapy are equivalent to or slightly better than those observed in patients <65 years of age. Treatment with fluvastatin produced a significantly lower incidence of major cardiovascular clinical end points (major adverse cardiac events [MACEs]) and an increase in the time to a first MACE in the older population. The incidence of adverse events, particularly those of concern with statin therapy, was similar between the placebo- and fluvastatin-treated patients and between the different age groups. In conclusion, data derived from the pooled analysis with fluvastatin demonstrate that cardiovascular events are reduced in older high-risk patients to a greater extent compared with younger patients. Furthermore, this pooled analysis supports the use of fluvastatin to lower cholesterol levels in older high-risk patients.", 
    "6": "We hypothesized that a reduction in atherogenic malondialdehyde-modified low-density lipoprotein (MDA-LDL) levels, which may antagonize the action of atheroprotective high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, leads to coronary plaque regression. This study investigated the effects of pravastatin on the serum levels of MDA-LDL and coronary atherosclerosis. In a 6-month prospective study, 75 patients with stable coronary artery disease were randomly assigned to a pravastatin-treatment group (n = 52) or a control group (n = 23). Volumetric analyses were performed in matched coronary artery segments by 3-dimensional intravascular ultrasound. Pravastatin therapy for 6 months resulted in a decrease in coronary plaque volume (14.4%, p <0.0001) and a corresponding reduction in serum MDA-LDL levels (12.7%, p = 0.0001). In the pravastatin treatment group, the percentage of change in plaque volume correlated with changes in the MDA-LDL and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (r = 0.52 and -0.55, respectively, p <0.0001) but not with the changes in any other lipid levels. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that a reduced MDA-LDL level is an independent predictor of plaque regression, as was an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In conclusion, these results suggest that the reduction in the MDA-LDL levels induced by pravastatin may serve as a novel marker of coronary atherosclerosis regression.", 
    "7": "The aim of this study was to study the effect of adding polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) n-3 or placebo (containing oleic acid) to a combined statin-fibrate treatment on plasma lipoproteins, lipoperoxidation, glucose homeostasis, total homocysteine (tHcy) and microalbuminuria (MA) in patients with diabetic dyslipidemia (DDL). Twenty-four patients, who did not fulfill the recommended target lipid values with combined hypolipidemic therapy (pravastatin 20 mg+micronized fenofibrate 200 mg daily), were supplemented with 3.6 g PUFA n-3 daily for 3 months or placebo (olive oil) for the next 3 months. The concentrations of plasma lipids, fatty acid (FA) profiles of phosphatidylcholine (PC), cholesteryl esters (CE) and triglycerides (TG), tHcy levels, concentrations of conjugated dienes (CD) in low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and MA were determined in baseline state, after the PUFA n-3 and placebo treatment period. Supplementation with PUFA n-3 led to a significant decrease in plasma tHcy (-29%, P < .01) and TG (-28%, P < .05) levels, as well as to a significant decrease in MA (-24%, P < .05). The decrease in MA correlated significantly with the increase in total PUFA n-3 (r = -.509, P < or = .05) and docosahexaenoic acid (r = -.52, P < .01) in TG. The concentrations of CD in LDL increased significantly (+15%, P < .05). The supplementation with PUFA n-3 to the combined statin-fibrate treatment in patients with DDL decreased the TG and tHcy levels as well as MA. It could lead to decreased risk of atherothrombosis and delay of diabetic nephropathy onset and progression.", 
    "8": "Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in heme catabolism, which confers cytoprotection against oxidative injury and provides a vital function in maintaining tissue homeostasis. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) possess several anti-inflammatory mechanisms and may be beneficial in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Our previous study has shown that statins can inhibit iNOS gene expression in murine RAW264.7 macrophages. In this study, we showed that lovastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin, mevastatin and pravastatin are able to upregulate the mRNA expression of HO-1 gene. This effect of lovastatin was attenuated by farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), a protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor (KT5823), a soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor (ODQ), a p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580), and MEK inhibitors (U0126 and PD98059), but not by inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC), protein kinase A (PKA), c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and Rho kinase. Consistent with this notion, our previous study has reported the ability of statins to activate ERK and p38 MAPK in RAW264.7 macrophages. Here we further found the participation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)/PKG pathway for ERK activation in cells stimulated with statin and the ability of statin to induce AP-1 activity, which is an essential transcription factor in the regulation of HO-1 gene expression. In addition, a Ras inhibitor (manumycin A) treatment also caused a marked induction of HO-1 mRNA followed by a corresponding increase in HO-1 protein; instead, inhibition of Rho activity by toxin B only led to a transient and weak induction of HO-1. The involvement of signal pathways in manumycin A-induced HO-1 gene expression was associated with p38 MAPK, JNK and ERK activation. Taken together, these results demonstrate for the first time that statins might activate PKG to elicit activations of ERK and p38 MAPK pathways and finally induce HO-1 gene expression, which provides a novel anti-inflammatory mechanism in the therapeutic validity.", 
    "9": "Recent identification of several mechanisms by which statins decrease recruitment of monocytes and T cells into the arterial wall and inhibit both T-cell and B-cell activation and proliferation in vitro prompted us to study the immunomodulatory effects of statins. In this study, we examined the effect of simvastatin therapy on lymphocyte cross-match positivity in kidney transplantation candidates.", 
    "10": "Simvastatin therapy (20 mg/d) was administered to 25 patients (18 men, 7 women of mean age 34 +/- 11.7 years who displayed positive lymphocyte cross-matches between July 2002 and October 2004.

    "13": "The mitotic inducer gene from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Spcdc25, was used as a tool to investigate regulation of G2/M in higher plants using the BY-2 (Nicotiana tabacum) cell line as a model. Spcdc25-expressing BY-2 cells exhibited a reduced mitotic cell size through a shortening of the G2 phase. The cells often formed isodiametric double files both in BY-2 cells and in cell suspensions derived from 35S::Spcdc25 tobacco plants. In Spcdc25-expressing cells, the tobacco cyclin-dependent kinase, NtCDKB1, showed high activity in early S phase, S/G2 and early M phase, whereas in empty vector cells CDKB1 activity was transiently high in early S phase but thereafter remained lower. Spcdc25-expressing cells also bypassed a block on G2/M imposed by the cytokinin biosynthetic inhibitor lovastatin (LVS). Surprisingly, cytokinins were at remarkably low levels in Spcdc25-expressing cells compared with the empty vector, explaining why these cells retained mitotic competence despite the presence of LVS. In conclusion, synchronised Spcdc25-expressing BY-2 cells divided prematurely at a small cell size, and they exhibited premature, but sustained, CDKB1 activity even though endogenous cytokinins were virtually undetectable.", 
    "14": "Statins are mainly known for their plasma cholesterol-lowering properties and are widely used for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. They however also exert pleiotropic effects through a variety of mechanisms, among which several immunosuppressive effects that are unrelated to their cholesterol-lowering activity. Interestingly, there has been recent evidence of antiviral effects, including preliminary studies on the efficacy of statins against HIV-1. This paper more particularly focuses on the specific inhibition of the binding of leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) to intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) by statins, independently of the inhibition of HMGCoA reductase. Targeting the statin-binding site within LFA-1 or regulating LFA-1 affinity by inhibiting prenylation of the small GTPases could prove useful to treat inflammatory, autoimmune diseases and possibly viral infections, including HIV-1.", 
    "15": "Cardiovascular complications are the leading cause of death in diabetes. Over the past decade a number of studies have addressed the underlying mechanisms. Derangements of endothelial function, also referred to as endothelial dysfunction, have emerged to be the crucial early step in the development of atherosclerosis and are also involved in plaque progression and clinical emergence. Endothelial dysfunction is a condition of impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation and most important of \"endothelial activation\", characterized by a proinflammatory, proliferative, and procoagulatory milieu that promotes initiation and complications of atherogenesis. A synergistic cross-talk among the conventional cardiovascular risk factors associated with diabetes contributes to disruption of endothelial integrity and accelerated atherosclerosis. This review will focus on the multifactorial nature of endothelial dysfunction in diabetes, the relationship between endothelial dysfunction, conventional cardiovascular risk factors and atherosclerosis, and the therapeutic options to improve endothelial function.", 
    "16": "Apart from their lipid lowering activity, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) impair numerous cellular functions associated with metastasis, e.g. gene expression, angiogenesis, cell adhesion, cell motility and invasiveness. Furthermore, statins have impact on apoptotic cell death and modulate cellular susceptibility to cell killing by anticancer drugs and ionizing radiation. Part of the effects provoked by statins are due to the inhibition of the prenylation of low molecular weight GTPases, in particular Ras and Rho, which play key roles in signaling evoked by stimulation of cell surface receptors. C-terminal lipid modification of Ras/Rho GTPases is essential for their correct intracellular localization and function. By depletion of the cellular pool of isoprene precursor molecules, statins reduce the level of membrane-bound active Ras/Rho proteins, thereby impairing corresponding functions. Since broad clinical experience already exists for statins, their incorporation into established tumor-therapeutic regimens would be realizable in a rather short period of time. Here, data available at present arguing for the usefulness of statins in anticancer therapy are summarized and discussed.",

    "22": "Thirty-four consecutive patients with successful reperfusion following AMI were assigned to either pravastatin group (group P, n=12) or non-pravastatin group (group NP, n=22). Serum MMP-2 and tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP)-2 were measured immediately after reperfusion, on days 2, 3, 7, 30, and at 6 months after MI. Left ventriculography was performed after reperfusion and at 4 weeks and 6 months.",

Left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVI) at 6 months correlated with MMP-2 levels on day 30 (r=0.47, p<0.01) and at 6 months (r=0.56, p<0.001). MMP-2 levels at 6 months were significantly lower in group P than group NP. Further, LVEDVI at 6 months tended to be smaller and DeltaLVEDVI was significantly smaller in group P when compared with group NP.", 
    "24": "Serum MMP-2 varied in a time-dependent manner following AMI and correlated with late changes in LVEDVI. Serum MMP-2 levels were significantly lower in treatment group than in non-treatment group and DeltaLVEDVI was significantly smaller in treatment group after long-term pravastatin administration. Use of statins in AMI patients may provide beneficial effects in terms of preventing heart failure over and above its lipid-lowering effects.", 
    "25": "Although the immunomodulatory properties of statins are in part independent of their lipid-lowering effects, cholesterol is a major component of lipid rafts. We therefore studied the effects of atorvastatin (AS) on the raft enrichment of the interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) beta chain previously described by us and on early IL-2R signaling events in activated human T cells. We found that concomitant AS exposure during a 3-day stimulation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) attenuates activation-associated events, such as the enhanced surface expression of the raft marker GM-1 and the induced expression of the activation marker CD25 (the IL-2R alpha chain). In contrast, brief AS treatment after PHA stimulation increased GM-1 surface expression and virtually abolished the selective raft enrichment of the IL-2R beta chain. Although this AS-associated increase in GM-1 expression resembled that seen in the presence of the raft-disrupting cholesterol chelator methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MBCD), the two agents had contrasting effects on the tyrosine phosphorylation of the IL-2R beta chain by exogenous IL-2: MBCD essentially abolished this event, whereas AS tended to enhance it and shifted its occurrence out of rafts. We conclude that AS affects IL-2R signaling by altering the raft enrichment of the IL-2R beta chain and propose that this effect is one mechanism underlying the immunomodulatory properties of statins.",

    "30": "Adherence was measured by the fill frequency (number of prescriptions filled during the observation period divided by months of observation). Patients with a fill frequency of 80% or greater were classified as adherent (661 patients); those with a fill frequency of 60% or less were classified as nonadherent (395 patients). The remaining 165 patients who had adherence rates of 61-79% were excluded from the analysis. The primary end point included a composite of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, PTCA, CABG, and death. Among 1056 patients, adherence was not associated with a reduction of the primary end point. However, patients in the adherent group were half as likely to experience a subsequent myocardial infarction as the patients in the nonadherent group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.20-0.99, p=0.047). In patients younger than 65 years (both adherent and not), the associated reduction in myocardial infarction was even more profound (HR 0.14, 95% CI 0.04-0.46, p=0.001) and was accompanied by a trend for a lower frequency of unstable angina (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.13-1.03, p=0.06). In patients 65 years or older (301 patients), adherence was not associated with significant changes in cardiovascular end points.",

The effects of statin treatment on brain cells, however, are hardly understood. We therefore evaluated the effects of simvastatin treatment on the migratory capacity of brain microglial cells, key elements in the pathogenesis of MS. It is shown that exposure of human and murine microglial cells to simvastatin reduced cell surface expression of the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR3. In addition, simvastatin treatment specifically abolished chemokine-induced microglial cell motility, altered actin cytoskeleton distribution, and led to changes in intracellular vesicles. These data clearly show that simvastatin inhibits several immunological properties of microglia, which may provide a rationale for statin treatment in MS.",

The controversial issue of the statin/coenzyme Q10 relationship has been investigated in preliminary studies in which the two substances were administered simultaneously. Work on different neurological diseases, involving mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, highlights some of the neuroprotective mechanisms of coenzyme Q10. A 4-year follow-up on 10 Friedreich's Ataxia patients treated with coenzyme Q10 and vitamin E showed a substantial improvement in cardiac and skeletal muscle bioenergetics and heart function. Mitochondrial dysfunction likely plays a role in the pathophysiology of migraine as well as age-related macular degeneration and a therapy including coenzyme Q10 produced significant improvement.

Epo stimulation of factor-dependent 32D cells results in phosphorylation of many proteins, including Janus kinase (Jak) 2, signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) 5, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk). Some of Epo-activated signaling proteins require isoprenylation, either farnesylation or geranylgeranylation, for post-translational modification. In this study, we sought to characterize the interplay between protein isoprenylation and Epo signal transduction. Using two different Epo-responsive cell lines, we found that depletion of mevalonate and its isoprenoid derivatives using the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin impairs Epo signaling as assessed by phosphorylation of cellular substrates and inhibition of apoptosis. Interestingly, the effect of mevalonate depletion was prevented by adding back geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate but not farnesyl pyrophosphate. Furthermore, selective inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation mimicked the effect of lovastatin, whereas selective inhibition of farnesylation had no effect. These results indicate that protein geranylgeranylation and not farnesylation is important for proper Epo signal transduction.", 
    "45": "Sexually selected traits like complex vocalizations or vibrant colors communicate reliable information about mate quality when they are costly to display. Although several general condition-dependent mechanisms underlying the acquisition of mating advertisements have been identified, we rarely know the precise physiological and molecular challenges that animals must meet to develop their sexual ornaments. The flashy pigment-based colors commonly displayed by birds are ideal candidates for investigating the pathways and demands of sexual-signal expression, because we know the biochemical currency with which the trait is produced. Carotenoid colors in birds, for example, are derived from pigments that are acquired from the diet and assimilated into feathers and bare parts. In previous work, we showed that variation in the sexually attractive red carotenoid-colored beak of male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) was predicted not by the amount of food or pigments ingested, but by the levels of carotenoids that birds circulated in blood. Here we elucidate a novel physiological mechanism by which birds are able to accumulate high levels of carotenoids in the body and develop a colorful bill. Carotenoids are transported through the bloodstream bound to lipoproteins. We assayed a critical component of lipoprotein particles-cholesterol-and found that males with higher cholesterol levels circulated more carotenoids and displayed redder beaks. Experimental supplementation of dietary cholesterol elevated carotenoid levels in the blood and beak hue. Experimental reductions in blood cholesterol, using the human lipid-lowering agent atorvastatin, diminished blood carotenoids and faded the beak; carotenoid and cholesterol levels were restored, however, by subsequent addition of dietary cholesterol. These results suggest that the production of circulating lipoproteins critically regulates the development of a colorful sexually selected trait in zebra finches.", 
    "46": "Familial hypercholesterolemia is an autosomal dominant disease defined at the molecular level mainly by the presence of mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene and is characterized by elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, tendon xanthomas and increased risk of early cardiovascular disease. The type of mutation in the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene has been associated with different phenotype expression and response to statins. Several studies have been undertaken to assess the efficacy of statins and evaluate the influence of mutations on the response to treatment with statins. Not all patients respond to statin therapy with a reduction in cardiovascular disease. In this review paper, we will discuss the results available to date that correlate the low-density lipoprotein receptor genotype to the response to statins, and the interest in developing diagnostic systems which will allow identification of patients at increased risk of adverse drug reactions or patients in which a therapeutic effect is lacking.", 
    "47": "NSTE-ACS is a complex clinical event characterized by a variable degree of myocardial ischemia and triggered, in most patients, by a rupture of a vulnerable plaque that leads to acute intraluminal nonocclusive thrombosis. Traditionally, acute management strategies for NSTE-ACS have been aimed at identification of vascular areas with discrete atheroma and revascularization of the affected myocardium. Studies that have evaluated invasive strategies in NSTE-ACS suggest that the rates of hard clinical events are similar for both intensive medical treatment and early invasive management strategies. As shown recently in the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project study, intensive therapy with beta-blockers appears to be a viable management option that has comparable outcomes in most patients with NSTE-ACS. Although several different treatment strategies have been advocated in the management of NSTE-ACS, the available evidence-based information does not fully support some of these traditional approaches. Future prospective, well-controlled trials are needed to fully ascertain the role of invasive and other medical management strategies in patients with NSTE-ACS.

Besides their specific cholesterol-lowering effect, these agents exert various pleiotropic effects, which probably contribute to the cardiovascular protection, but may also play a favourable effect in various other pathologies. Some recent data suggested that statins may play a positive effect in the prevention of Alzheimer disease and colorectal cancer. In contrast, after some initial hope, recent observations in the field of osteoporosis prevention provided discordant and finally rather disappointing results. New prospective studies are mandatory before accepting such new potential indications of statins.", 
    "49": "Despite meaningful progress in the identification of risk factors and the development of highly effective clinical tools, deaths from cardiovascular disease continue to increase worldwide. Sparked by an obesity epidemic, the metabolic syndrome and the rising incidence of type 2 diabetes have led to an upsurge of cardiovascular risk. Although pharmacologic treatments with the statin class of drugs have reduced cholesterol levels and lowered mortality rates, several large controlled clinical trials, including the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study, the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events trial, the Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention studies, and Long-term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease study, have indicated that cardiovascular events continue to occur in two thirds of all patients. Follow-up studies, such as the Heart Protection Study and the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy/Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction-22 trials, reinforced these earlier results. Although therapy with gemfibrozil, a fibric acid derivative, showed reduced occurrence of cardiovascular events in the Helsinki Heart Study and the Veterans Affairs HDL Intervention Trial, results of other studies, e.g., the Bezafibrate Intervention Program and the Diabetes Atherosclerosis Intervention study, showed less encouraging results. Although lifestyle modifications, such as improved diet and increased exercise levels, benefit general health and the metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance in particular, most people continue to resist changes in their daily routines. Thus, physicians must continue to educate their patients regarding an optimal balance of drug therapy and personal behavior.",

After treatment, the RT values of 14C-cholesteryl ester in the FH group approached the NL values (P = 0.58), but the RT of 3H-cholesterol was still greater than those for the NL group (P = 0.01). The removal of LDE cholesteryl esters and free cholesterol was delayed in FH patients.

    "73": "Statins are a remarkably safe and efficacious class of medications that have proved to be invaluable in the fight against heart disease. Statins have been prescribed to millions of patients for nearly 20 years; thus there have been hundreds of millions of patient-years of use, with relatively few adverse effects and incalculable benefits. Results from large-scale clinical trials have shown that statins are associated with dramatic decreases in cardiovascular risk. It seems certain that statins will remain a valuable and essential part of the lipid-lowering landscape, but combinations of statins with other lipid-lowering agents are increasingly important. Even with the most potent statins, the desired low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal might not be attained with statin monotherapy. Furthermore, because of the increasing prevalence of diabetes and the metabolic syndrome, along with their attendant multiple lipid abnormalities, combinations of statins with medications targeted toward multiple lipoprotein particles will emerge.", 
    "74": "Current guidelines for the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) focus on lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) as the primary target of lipid-modifying therapy. However, there is increasing interest in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) as a secondary target of therapy. A wealth of epidemiologic data demonstrate that low levels of HDL-C are associated with an increased risk of CHD events, and data from large-scale clinical trials with statins and fibrates indicate that observed clinical benefits are related, at least in part, to improvements in HDL-C levels. Raising HDL-C levels with therapeutic lifestyle changes and pharmacologic intervention might afford opportunities to further reduce the risk of CHD beyond LDL-C lowering. Statins are first-line pharmacotherapy for dyslipidemia and can also improve HDL-C levels, although the extent to which they modify HDL-C varies. Combining a fibrate or niacin with statin therapy raises HDL-C more than a statin alone but might be associated with reduced tolerability and increased adverse reactions. Several new therapeutic approaches to raising HDL-C are in development, including an HDL mimetic and inhibitors of cholesteryl ester transfer protein. Although lowering LDL-C remains the primary target of lipid-modifying therapy, dyslipidemia therapies that are efficacious for both LDL-C reduction and raising HDL-C might offer further improvements in CHD risk reduction.",

It is vital particularly in case of elderly people who usually suffer from many different diseases which have numerous common pathogenetic pathways. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, also known as statins, are a widely prescribed drug class for treatment of dyslipidemias and their complications such as coronary artery disease, stroke and peripheral arteriosclerosis. Now, there is accumulating evidence that statins also have beneficial pleiotropic effects that may make them useful in treatment of such diseases as dementia, osteoporosis, some forms of cancer, diabetes mellitus and its microangiopathic complications, hypertension and prevent deep vein thrombosis.

    "81": "The goal of this paper is to report on the study of the mechanism of neural damage in neonatal cerebral cortex and hippocampus when hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) occurs and the neural protective effects of simvastatin. One hundred forty-four 7-day-old SD rats of were randomly divided into four groups, i.e., sham operation group (sham group), normal saline control group (HIBD group), citicoline control group (CDPC group), and simvastatin-treated group. Each group was divided into six time points (0 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 7 days after HIBD or sham operation), and each time point included six rats. The expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) mRNA was determined semiquantitively by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the cortex and hippocampus of neonatal rats at different times to determine the differences. The expression of ICAM-1 mRNA rose obviously 12 h after HIBD in the ischemic hemisphere, peaked at 24 h, and then decreased gradually. There was a remarkably lower expression in the CDPC group and simvastatin group compared with the HIBD group at 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. At 7 days, there was no significant difference between the simvastatin group and the sham group (P > 0.05), and at 72 h, simvastatin down-regulated the expression of ICAM-1 mRNA in cortex significantly more than did citicoline (P < 0.05). Both simvastatin and CDPC can relieve the damages of the brain in rats with HIBD. The protective mechanisms of simvastatin and citicoline are associated with their regulative effect on ICAM-1, and simvastatin is superior to citicoline.", 
    "82": "It is known that coadministration of a statin and certain drugs that inhibit cytochrome P-450 may inhibit catabolism of statin, resulting in an increased concentration of statin in the blood and consequently, increased risk of certain side effects, e.g. myopathy. The aim of this study was to establish, for the first time, how many patients in Croatia concomitantly take statins with other drugs, and which drugs. Also, the aim was to determine how often statins are administered concomitantly with cytochrome P-450 inhibitors, and how many patients taking statin are therefore at increased risk of interactions and/or side effects. The data were collected from general practitioners' health records all over Croatia during July and August 2004. The data for patients who were prescribed any statin between June 1, 2003 and June 1, 2004 were analysed. The records of 882 patients were analysed, 446 (50.6%) women, 422 (47.8%) men and 14 (1.6%) of unidentified sex. The average age of women on statin was 65 years and of men 60 years. Of 882 patients, 772 patients (82%) were taking at least one more drug concurrently with statin. Of that number, 24% of patients concomitantly were taking one more drug, 20% two more drugs, 16% three more drugs, 10% four more drugs, 8% five more drugs and 3% six more drugs. The average number of other drugs prescribed together with statin was 2.1 +/- 1.59 in men and 2.2 +/- 1.71 in women. The average age of patients who were taking another drug together with a statin did not significantly differ from that of patients receiving only statin. There were regional differences in the number of drugs prescribed together with a statin. In Osijek, the average number of drugs prescribed with a statin was 2.4 +/- 1.80, in Zagreb 2.2 +/- 1.64, in Rijeka 2.0 +/- 1.60, and in Split 1.8 +/- 1.44. The number of drugs prescribed with a statin in rural areas was 2.0 +/- 1.58, in urban areas 2.1 +/- 1.63 and in semi-urban areas 2.8 +/- 1.85. The therapeutic groups of drugs that are most frequently prescribed with a statin in Croatia are ACE inhibitors and their fixed combinations (32%), beta-receptor blockers and their fixed combinations (23%), selective calcium channel blockers (18%), anxiolytics (18%), vasodilators and organic nitrates (16%), antirheumatic drugs (11%), oral antidiabetics (11%), vitamin K antagonists, analgesics-antipyretics, diuretics (10%), antibiotics (8%), and angiotensin II antagonists and their fixed combinations (5%). All other drugs accounted for less than 5%. Four percent of the patients take cytochrome P-450 inhibitors concomitantly with a statin. The most frequently used drug is verapamil, combination of verapamil and trandolapril, clarithromycin and diltiazem. Consequently, 3% of men and 5% of women are at increased risk of side effects. This sex difference is, however, not statistically significant. Patients between 70 and 74 years of age taking statins are in Croatia at the highest risk of interactions because 8% of them take concomitantly cytochrome P 450 inhibitors.",

    "84": "The authors investigated the effects of rosuvastatin, beyond its lipid-lowering activity, on several nonlipid metabolic variables, along with its safety and tolerability, in patients treated for primary hyperlipidemia. Patients (n = 55) with primary hyperlipidemia were open-label assigned to the recommended starting dose of rosuvastatin 10 mg/day, and serum metabolic variables were measured at baseline and after 8 and 20 weeks. Treatment with rosuvastatin produced significant reductions in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B, nonhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non HDL-C), and triglyceride concentrations, whereas HDL-C, apolipoprotein A-I, and lipoprotein(a) levels did not change significantly from baseline. The LDL-C treatment target was achieved in 71% of patients. No significant variations in renal function parameters (serum creatinine and creatinine clearance), insulin resistance estimates, and serum concentrations of uric acid, total homocysteine, vitamin B12, and folic acid were observed during the period of treatment. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels were significantly lowered by rosuvastatin therapy (median values, 3.1 vs 2.0 vs 1.9 mg/L, at 0, 8, and 20 weeks, respectively; p < 0.0001). In conclusion, rosuvastatin at 10 mg/day is a highly effective, safe, and well-tolerated monotherapy option for patients with primary hyperlipidemia, with a favorable antiinflammatory potential and nondeteriorating effects on renal function.", 
    "85": "The exact mechanism underlying regional cerebral hypoperfusion in the early phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not understood. We have shown in isolated porcine cerebral arteries that stimulation of sympathetic alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (alpha7-nAChRs) causes release of nitric oxide in parasympathetic nitrergic nerves and vasodilation. We therefore examined if beta-amyloid peptides (Abetas), which play a key role in pathogenesis of AD, blocked sympathetic alpha7-nAChRs leading to reduced neurogenic nitrergic dilation in isolated porcine basilar arteries, using in vitro tissue bath, calcium image, and patch clamping techniques. The results indicated that Abeta(1-40), but not Abeta(40-1), blocked relaxation of endothelium-denuded basilar arterial rings induced by nicotine (100 micromol/L) and choline (1 mmol/L) without affecting that induced by sodium nitroprusside or isoproterenol. In cultured superior cervical ganglion (SCG) cells, Abeta(1-40), but not Abeta(40-1), blocked choline- and nicotine-induced calcium influx and inward currents. The Abeta blockade of the nitrergic vasodilation and inward currents, but not that of calcium influx, was prevented by acute pretreatment with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors mevastatin and lovastatin. These results suggest that Abeta(1-40) blocks cerebral perivascular sympathetic alpha7-nAChRs, resulting in the attenuation of cerebral nitrergic neurogenic vasodilation. This effect of Abeta may be responsible in part for cerebral hypoperfusion occurred in the early phase of the AD, which may be prevented by statins most likely because of their effects independent of cholesterol lowering. Statins may offer an alternative strategy in the prevention and treatment of AD.", 
    "86": "The authors compared five methods of studying survival bias associated with time-to-treatment initiation in a drug effectiveness study using medical administrative databases (1996-2002) from Quebec, Canada. The first two methods illustrated how survival bias could be introduced. Three additional methods were considered to control for this bias. Methods were compared in the context of evaluating statins for secondary prevention in elderly patients post-acute myocardial infarction who initiated statins within 90 days after discharge and those who did not. Method 1 that classified patients into users and nonusers at discharge resulted in an overestimation of the benefit (38% relative risk reduction at 1 year). In method 2, following users from the time of the first prescription and nonusers from a randomly selected time between 0 and 90 days attenuated the effect toward the null (10% relative risk reduction). Method 3 controlled for survival bias by following patients from the end of the 90-day time window; however, it suffered a major loss of statistical efficiency and precision. Method 4 matched prescription time distribution between users and nonusers at cohort entry. Method 5 used a time-dependent variable for treatment initiation. Methods 4 and 5 better controlled for survival bias and yielded similar results, suggesting a 20% risk reduction of recurrent myocardial infarction or death events.", 
    "87": "Lipid-modified proteins are classified based on the identity of the attached lipid, a post- or co-translational modification required for their biological function. At least five different lipid modifications of cysteines, glycines and other residues on the COOH- and NH(2)-terminal domains have been described. Cysteine residues may be modified by the addition of a 16-carbon saturated fatty acyl group by a labile thioester bond (palmitoylation) or by prenylation processes that catalyze the formation of thioether bond with mevalonate derived isoprenoids, farnesol and geranylgeraniol. The NH(2)-terminal glycine residues may undergo a quite distinct process involving the formation of an amide bond with a 14-carbon saturated acyl group (myristoylation), while glycine residues in the COOH-terminal may be covalently attached with a cholesterol moiety by an ester bond. Finally, cell surface proteins can be anchored to the membrane through the addition of glycosylphosphatidylinositol moiety. Several lines of evidence suggest that lipid-modified proteins are directly involved in different steps of the development of lesions of atherosclerosis, from leukocyte recruitment to plaque rupture, and their expression or lipid modification are likely altered during atherogenesis. This review will briefly summarize the different enzymatic pathways of lipid modification and propose a series of lipid-modified proteins that can be used as biomarkers for cardiovascular disease.", 
    "88": "A pivotal role for cholesterol influence on production of the putative AD toxin, amyloid beta (Abeta), has been amply demonstrated. More importantly, this relationship has consistently been identified in both in vivo and in vitro studies. Lowering cholesterol levels has been shown to cause a beneficial effect on Abeta levels in animal models, and epidemiological data indicate a beneficial effect on the risk of AD with prior statin use. Blinded, placebo-controlled clinical investigations assessing the benefit of statins on cognitive indices in mild to moderate AD are ongoing and one will be reported on soon. A prospective study assessing the effect of statin use on the risk of AD is under way as an observational component of a placebo-controlled primary prevention trial testing anti-inflammatory agents. Nevertheless, the foregoing suggests that routine monitoring and intervention for elevated cholesterol levels among the elderly could promote more than a healthy heart.", 
    "89": "The high incidence of cardiac and vascular disease in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients has heightened interest in many investigations concerning the serum lipid levels of these patients. The prevalence and laboratory characteristics of serum lipid concentrations in MHD patients, however, are far from clear. We hypothesized that serum lipids are significantly lower in MHD patients compared to their matched nondialysis counterparts. We compared 2-year averaged serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and triglycerides in 285 MHD patients to the same averaged measurements during the same period of time in 285 nondialyzed outpatients from the same geographic area, whose lipid panels were measured in the same laboratory. Matching factors were sex, race and/or ethnicity, diabetes mellitus, and age (+/- 5 years). The MHD patients and their matched controls were 55.6 +/- 13.5 (SD) and 56.3 +/- 13.0 years old, respectively. Each group contained 51% women, 31% African Americans, 52% Hispanics, and 37% diabetics; 16% of MHD patients and 38% of controls were receiving statins. Body mass index (BMI) was significantly lower in MHD patients than in controls (26.2 vs. 31.5 kg/m2; p < 0.001). Serum cholesterol levels were significantly lower in MHD patients than in control subjects including after adjustment for BMI and statin use (TC, -51; LDL, -39; and HDL, -10 mg/dL; p < 0.001). Using conditional logistic regression for matched data and after controlling for BMI and statins, all odds ratios for predetermined hypercholesterolemic, but not hypertriglyceridemic, levels were significantly and substantially lower than 1.00, indicating much lower likelihood of hypercholesterolemia in MHD patients. Total and LDL hypercholesterolemia, although very common in nondialysis ambulatory outpatients, are substantially less prevalent in the MHD population, whereas hypertriglyceridemia is approximately equally prevalent between these populations.", 
    "90": "Simvastatin, a widely used 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, effectively reduced cardiac death and ischemic events in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and diabetes mellitus (DM). The mechanism of cardiovascular benefits of statins in DM remains unclear. We examined how simvastatin influences the levels of several in vivo markers for coagulation and fibrinolysis in 26 Type 2 DM patients. The diabetic patients received 20 mg/day of simvastatin up to 12 months. The levels of total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c) and triglycerides in peripheral circulation of patients were significantly reduced after > or =6 weeks of simvastatin treatment. Levels of prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2), factor VII, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) antigens, but not tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) antigen, in the pre-simvastatin plasmas of the diabetic patients were significantly higher than the levels found in plasmas of healthy subjects. Significant reductions in F1+2 and PAI-1 levels were evident > or =6 weeks after the diabetic patients received simvastatin. Levels of total tPA, TFPI, FVII, hemoglobin A1c, fasting blood glucose, and insulin in the diabetic patients' plasma were not significantly altered by simvastatin treatment. Positive correlations were found between PAI-1 versus TC, PAI-1 versus LDL-c, and FVII versus triglycerides in the plasmas of simvastatin-treated patients. The results suggest that simvastatin reduces in vivo prothrombinase activity and PAI-1 levels in type 2 DM patients. These actions may contribute to the protective properties of simvastatin against ischemic events in diabetic patients.", 
    "91": "Utilization rates of aspirin, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins singly and as part of a multidrug regimen before hospitalization were measured in 109,540 patients with a history of coronary artery disease presenting with acute myocardial infarction to 1,283 hospitals participating in the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction-4. The profile of patients receiving none or only 1 of these therapies was compared with that of patients receiving any 3 or all 4 agents. Most patients (58%) with a history of coronary artery disease presenting with acute myocardial infarction were on none or only 1 of these effective medications at hospital admission. Only 21% of patients were on >or=3 of these therapies. Older age, female gender, and Medicare or no insurance coverage was significantly associated with previous receipt of <or=1 agent. Patients from New England or with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia were more likely to have received >or=3 of these therapies. In conclusion, data from this large national registry have indicated that most patients with a history of CAD were not receiving the recommended combination of cardiac medications before their AMI.", 
    "92": "Diabetic retinopathy is a common and potentially devastating microvascular complication in diabetes and is a leading cause of acquired blindness among the people of occupational age. However, therapeutic options for the treatment of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, photocoagulation and vitrectomy, are limited by considerable side effects. Therefore, to develop novel therapeutic strategies that specifically target diabetic retinopathy is desired for patients with diabetes. In diabetes mellitus, the formation and accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) progress. There is a growing body of evidence to show that AGEs-their receptor (RAGE) interactions are involved in the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy. Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, have been recently shown to reduce the risk for cardiovascular events in diabetic patients with or without coronary artery disease. However, the efficacy of statin therapy for diabetic retinopathy is not fully investigated. We have recently found that protein prenylation is crucial for the AGE-RAGE signaling in microvascular endothelial cells. By blocking the protein prenylation, cerivastatin completely prevented the AGE-RAGE-elicited angiogenesis via suppression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These observations let us to speculate that statins might be a promising remedy for treating patients with diabetic retinopathy by acting as a potential inhibitor of the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in microvascular endothelial cells. In this paper, we would like to propose the possible ways of testing our hypotheses. (1) Does treatment with statins decrease the risk for the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy in patients with normocholesterolemia? (2) If the answer is yes, is this beneficial effect of statins superior to that of other cholesterol-lowering agents with equihypolipidemic properties? (3) Does statin treatment suppress retinal VEGF expression in diabetic patients? (4) Does treatment with pyridoxamine, a post-Amadori inhibitor of AGE formation, attenuate the beneficial effects of statins on diabetic retinopathy? These clinical studies could clarify whether the use of statins is of benefit in patients with AGE-RAGE-related disorders such as diabetic retinopathy, even in the absence of hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "93": "Microsomal transfer protein inhibitors (MTPi) have the potential to be used as a drug to lower plasma lipids, mainly plasma triglycerides (TG). However, studies with animal models have indicated that MTPi treatment results in the accumulation of hepatic TG. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether JTT-130, a unique MTPi, targeted to the intestine, would effectively reduce plasma lipids without inducing a fatty liver.", 
    "94": "Male guinea pigs (n = 10 per group) were used for this experiment. Initially all guinea pigs were fed a hypercholesterolemic diet containing 0.08 g/100 g dietary cholesterol for 3 wk. After this period, animals were randomly assigned to diets containing 0 (control), 0.0005 or 0.0015 g/100 g of MTPi for 4 wk. A diet containing 0.05 g/100 g of atorvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor was used as the positive control. At the end of the 7th week, guinea pigs were sacrificed to assess drug effects on plasma and hepatic lipids, composition of LDL and VLDL, hepatic cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism.", 
    "95": "Plasma LDL cholesterol and TG were 25 and 30% lower in guinea pigs treated with MTPi compared to controls (P < 0.05). Atorvastatin had the most pronounced hypolipidemic effects with a 35% reduction in LDL cholesterol and 40% reduction in TG. JTT-130 did not induce hepatic lipid accumulation compared to controls. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity was reduced in a dose dependent manner by increasing doses of MTPi and guinea pigs treated with atorvastatin had the lowest CETP activity (P < 0.01). In addition the number of molecules of cholesteryl ester in LDL and LDL diameter were lower in guinea pigs treated with atorvastatin. In contrast, hepatic enzymes involved in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis were not affected by drug treatment.",

As of April 2005, phase III trials were ongoing.", 
    "98": "The recently identified lipid-regulated group of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters acts in various cells and tissues that are important for total body lipid homeostasis. ABCA1 and ABCG1 are key regulators of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism, acting as protective factors against the development of atherosclerosis. Recent data regarding how these ABC transporters control cholesterol and phospholipid homeostasis have provided valuable insights into the mechanisms of mRNA and protein expression, intracellular trafficking, surface membrane localization and interaction with binding partners and lipoproteins. These studies have identified several potential new targets, including nuclear receptors, ABCA1-interactive proteins and apolipoprotein A-I mimetics, which could be promising tools for raising HDL levels and improving the pharmacological treatment of cardiovascular disease.",

    "100": "In 2002, we studied prescribing patterns of beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin-II antagonists and statins in the County of Funen, Denmark (180 general practices, 472,000 inhabitants). For each practice, we distinguished between an incident drug formulary consisting of prescriptions for new users and an ongoing drug formulary including prescriptions for patients already in treatment. Prescription data were retrieved from the Odense University Pharmacoepidemiologic Database (OPED). Four different formulary measures were evaluated and used for comparing incident and ongoing drug use.", 
    "101": "General practitioners' (GPs') incident drug formularies comprised significantly fewer drugs than their ongoing drug formularies for all drug groups except angiotensin-II antagonists. The difference in the total number of drugs used was between 1.8 and 3.3. We found differences between 0.5 and 1.6 analogues in the DU 90% (number of analogues accounting for 90% of the prescribed volume measured in defined daily doses) segment and the formulary selectivity index between 0.05 and 0.12. The preference for the most prescribed analogue was 9-18% higher among incident patients. The formulary selectivity index was highly correlated with the other formulary measures and quantified both range and skewed distribution of drug choice.",

    "103": "Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2) (Lp-PLA(2)), also known as platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase, is a plasma enzyme that circulates bound to lipoproteins. The association between Lp-PLA(2) and atherosclerosis is ambiguous, as it can both degrade and generate potentially damaging vasoactive molecules. In this article, we speculate that Lp-PLA(2) associated with HDL might have cardioprotective properties, whereas the same enzyme bound to LDL might contribute directly to atherosclerosis at all stages, from lipoprotein oxidation to endothelial dysfunction, and plaque initiation and growth. Genetic and animal model studies give varying indications as to the contribution of Lp-PLA(2) to atherogenesis and tend to support the view that higher Lp-PLA(2) levels are cardioprotective. By contrast, a series of population studies point clearly to a positive association between plasma Lp-PLA(2) levels or activity levels and risk of coronary heart disease or stroke. Typically, people with Lp-PLA(2) levels in the highest quintile of the population have about a twofold greater risk than those in the lowest quintile. It is, perhaps, too early to introduce Lp-PLA(2) as a population-wide biomarker for coronary heart disease risk; however, with accumulating evidence, it might find a place in a stepwise risk assessment of individuals who require more aggressive intervention to prevent vascular disease.",

According to evidence from the literature, covariates that would affect the risk of fractures were included in the final model, as were medications that were clinically meaningful and significant in univariate models and the Charlson Comorbidity Index as a surrogate for general health. We also conducted a similar analysis among new statin users. We used pooled logistic regression to assess for significant associations.", 
    "106": "Of the 91 052 patients in the final cohort, 28 063 were prescribed statins and 2195 were prescribed nonstatin lipid-lowering medications. In the adjusted analyses, statin use was associated with a 36% (odds ratio, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.58-0.72) reduction in fracture risk when compared with no lipid-lowering therapy and a 32% (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.50-0.91) reduction when compared with nonstatin lipid-lowering therapy. Similar findings were found for the new statin user group.",

    "108": "Statins may have favorable effects on endothelial barrier function. The effect of rosuvastatin and simvastatin therapy (10 mg/kg) for 5 weeks on blood-brain barrier (BBB), blood-retinal barrier (BRB), and cardiac muscle permeability of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats was studied. The size-selective permeability of different vascular beds to a group of fluorescein isothiocyanate dextrans of varying molecular weights was measured. The volume of distribution of 250-, 70-, and 40-kDa dextrans in the cerebral tissue of diabetic rats were significantly increased. The volume of distribution of these dextrans in cerebral tissue was normalized by both statins. Diabetes did not significantly alter the BRB, but both statins decreased the volume of distribution of 70- and 40-kDa dextrans in the retina. The volume of distribution of 40 kDa in cardiac muscle was increased in diabetes, and this change was prevented with statin treatment. Treatment with rosuvastatin and mevalonate (150 mg/kg in drinking water for 5 weeks) did not alter the volume of distribution measurements. We concluded that 1) diabetes in rats is associated with significant changes in the BBB permeability; 2) statin treatment improves the endothelial barrier function in cerebral tissue, retina, and cardiac muscle; and 3) this statin effect could not be attributed to HMGCoA reductase inhibition.",

Patients with two or fewer characteristics (n = 1,877) were classified as not having metabolic syndrome and had a 14% incidence of a primary end point event. In univariate analysis, the individual characteristics that bore a significant relation to risk were diabetes and low HDL cholesterol.

A close correlation (r=0.89, p<0.001) was found between reduction of sd LDL and that of LDL-C, in patients with phenotype B. Although high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) was not affected by atorvastatin treatment, plasma triglycerides decreased by 27.4% (p<0.0001).

As an oxidative stress model of human disease, we used hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to study effect of ROS on C6 glioma cells as a surrogate for astrocytes. H2O2 induced dose- and time-dependent apoptotic cell death which was preceded by growth arrest, and transiently activated the signalling proteins ATF-2, ERK1/2 and AKT in C6 glioma cells. While several antioxidants failed to block H2O2-induced apoptosis of these cells, Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb) totally prevented the cell death and growth inhibition induced by H2O2. Interestingly, EGb did not prevent the activation of ATF-2, ERK1/2 and AKT induced by H2O2 excluding the role of these factors in the pro-apoptotic effect of H2O2. We have previously shown that the lipid-lowering drug, simvastatin, causes apoptotic cell death in C6 glioma cells [Koyuturk M, Ersoz M, Altiok N. Simvastatin induces proliferation inhibition and apoptosis in C6 glioma cells via c-jun N-terminal kinase. Neurosci Lett 2004;370(2-3):212-7]. However, in parallel experiments with H2O2, EGb was unable to prevent cell death induced by simvastatin suggesting the involvement of separate signalling pathways between H2O2 and simvastatin. Thus, EGb and other plant flavonoids might have potential as protective agents against apoptosis through scavenging ROS upon cerebral or myocardial diseases associated with free radical generation.",

Control group (n=5) was fed with normal diet for 14 weeks. Subcutaneous adipose was collected for adipocyte culture. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to evaluate adipocytes SR-BI mRNA expression. Cholesterol efflux rate was determined through measuring release of radioactivity from (3)H-cholesterol prelabeled cells into medium containing high-density lipoprotein (HDL).

    "132": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among adults in the United States, in Europe, and in much of Asia. Despite advances in primary prevention of coronary artery disease, including early detection and treatment of dyslipidemia, one half of all myocardial infarctions and strokes occur in patients with normal serum cholesterol levels. Observations like this prompt the search for new risk factors and improved identification of individuals at high risk. One proposed risk factor is an elevated level of C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation independent of other risk factors. The CRP assay is desirable in terms of standardization and cost. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are indicated for the treatment of dyslipidemias, but data support their protective role against cardiovascular disease beyond their effects on lipids. Statins directly affect inflammatory markers, and nearly 2 dozen randomized studies have demonstrated statins' effects on CRP. Because information regarding the role of CRP in cardiovascular disease is compelling but sometimes contradictory and because the need to reduce CRP levels is unclear, the American Heart Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention presented a panel statement on the topic. Ongoing trials will assist in determining the need to reduce CRP levels to lower cardiovascular risk. An understanding of these issues is important for improving the prediction of cardiovascular risk and for intervening to reduce this risk.", 
    "133": "The disease-modifying agents currently used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) are not completely effective and are associated with adverse effects and high costs. Thus, alternative treatment options are highly desirable. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), widely prescribed as cholesterol-lowering agents, may be a future treatment option for MS--either in an add-on therapy regimen or alone--as they have been shown to exhibit potent immunomodulatory effects. Several recent reports have demonstrated that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors prevent and reverse chronic and relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of MS. Furthermore, in vitro experiments with human immune cells have shown an immunomodulatory mode of action of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that is comparable to that of interferon-beta, an established treatment for MS. An open-label clinical trial assessing simvastatin treatment in patients with MS revealed a significant decrease in the number and volume of new lesions, as assessed using magnetic resonance imaging, and a favourable safety profile. A large multicentre, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial assessing atorvastatin in patients with a clinically isolated syndrome (i.e. a single clinical event that is indicative of demyelination, and that predisposes to the development MS) has recently been initiated. However, prospective placebo-controlled trials of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in definite MS are difficult to perform because of ethical and financial issues. Furthermore, overly optimistic reports in the popular media, as well as the often uncontrolled access to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors by patients with MS, complicate the evaluation of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors as a realistic future treatment option for MS.",

We tested different statins in cell culture against HIV and conducted a pilot study in HIV-positive patients receiving simvastatin.

In the present study, individual administration of either raloxifene (Group A) or atorvastatin (Group B) or both (Group C) was compared for a period of 3 months and their effects on total lipids and fatty acids composition was evaluated. Postmenopausal women receiving both raloxifene and atorvastatin showed significant changes in the majority of serum lipids with important reductions in total cholesterol (p < 0.001), triglycerides (p < 0.001), LDL-C (p < 0.001) and Apo B levels (p < 0.001). Phospholipids concentrations (p < 0.01) as well as Apo A-I were also significantly raised (p < 0.001). Furthermore, oleic acid (18:1) and linoleic acid (18:2) levels were significantly increased (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001 respectively) followed by a marked reduction in palmitic acid (16:0) and arachidonic acid (20:4) concentrations (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001 respectively). The results of the study indicate that the serum lipid and fatty acid composition in postmenopausal women is influenced by the combined treatment of raloxifene and atorvastatin and a further attempt to evaluate the significance of these results is discussed.", 
    "136": "Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) is responsible for the assembly of the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) and is increased in diabetic animal models. Human intestinal MTP expression has not been previously reported. This study examined the relationship between intestinal MTP gene expression and postprandial TRL composition in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. Since the MTP promoter region has a sterol response element the effect of statins on intestinal MTP mRNA was analysed.", 
    "137": "Twenty-seven diabetic and 24 non-diabetic subjects were examined. Duodenal biopsies were taken during gastroscopy and MTP mRNA was measured by RNase protection assay. Postprandial lipoprotein composition was determined.", 
    "138": "Diabetic subjects had significantly higher MTP mRNA than non-diabetic subjects. Statin therapy was associated with lower MTP mRNA in both groups. In the untreated diabetic patients compared to the untreated non-diabetic patients MTP mRNA was 25.0 +/- 25.1 amol/microg versus 13.1 +/- 5.6 amol/microg total RNA (p < 0.05). In the statin-treated diabetic group compared to statin-treated non-diabetic group MTP mRNA was 17.7 +/- 8.6 amol/microg versus 5.8 +/- 4.1 amol/microg total RNA (p < 0.05). In the whole group there was a positive correlation between the MTP mRNA and postprandial chylomicron cholesterol/B48 (r = 0.36, p < 0.01).", 
    "139": "This is the first study to demonstrate increased MTP expression in diabetic subjects. MTP mRNA expression was lower in statin-treated patients confirming the suggestion that the insulin and sterol response elements of the MTP gene are important regulators of MTP transcription in diabetes. Our results show that MTP plays a central role in regulating the cholesterol content of the chylomicron particle.",

    "141": "Twenty-eight bone defects were created in the parietal bone of 14 New Zealand White rabbits. In the Statin Group of 7 rabbits, the defects were grafted with collagen matrix carriers mixed with statin solution. In the Collagen Matrix Group of 7 rabbits, the defects were grafted with collagen matrix carriers mixed with water for injection. The Statin Group and the Collagen Matrix Group were killed on day 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 14 after surgery. Bone defects with surrounding tissues were prepared for histologic assessment. Bone defects of day 14 were also prepared for ultrastructural assessment.", 
    "142": "New bone was formed on day 5 in the defects grafted with statin. No cartilage intermediate stage was detected. This occurred 1 day earlier than for those grafted with the carrier alone. The bone defects of day 14 showed that an abundance of bone was formed in the Statin Group and osteocytes were identified ultrastructurally.", 
    "143": "This study supported statin-induced and accelerated bone formation locally.", 
    "144": "Cardiac syndrome X is defined as a typical angina pectoris, positive treadmill exercise test, negative intravenous ergonovine test and normal coronary angiography. The pathogenesis of cardiac syndrome X has previously ascribed to myocardial ischemia that may be caused by microvascular dysfunction and increased sensitivity to intracardiac pain. Despite the extensive studies, the pathophysiological mechanisms in cardiac syndrome, however, remain unclear. More recently, the data has been suggested that chronic inflammation has been associated with cardiac syndrome X. The evidence for the hypotheses included that inflammatory marker are increased, and associated with the disease activity in patients with cardiac syndrome X. And also, statin, a lipid-lowering as well as anti-inflammatory drug, has significantly modified the disease process in this special syndrome. Despite the good prognosis of cardiac syndrome X, the chronic, frequent nature of the persistent angina and reduced exercise tolerance can significantly impair quality of life. Thus, lowering inflammatory response by, for example, use of statin and/or aspirin, might improve coronary microvascular dysfunction. Whether this is a valid approach, however, is still unknown and deserves further investigation. Indeed, as mediators of inflammation are multiple, the strategy of identifying triggers and mechanisms of inflammation in each special clinical setting and directing treatment at the special triggers or to rate limiting steps in effector pathways appears more reasonable or a promising strategy.", 
    "145": "Extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 were reported to be expressed at the macrophage-rich area in human coronary atherosclerotic plaque. We examined whether C-reactive protein (CRP) activates macrophages to express EMMPRIN and MMP-9 in vitro and whether statins inhibit it.", 
    "146": "Rat peritoneal macrophages were collected by peritoneal lavage, and were incubated in the presence or absence of CRP. CRP at 5 microg/ml increased the gene expression of EMMPRIN relative to GAPDH, measured by RT-PCR, by 1.67+/-0.07 fold at 24 h and by 1.85+/-0.49 fold at 48 h (both p<0.05). The gene expression of MMP-9 in the presence of CRP at 5 microg/ml was followed by 1.36+/-0.11 fold increase at 24 h and by 3.95+/-0.81 fold at 48 h (both p<0.05). CRP at 5 microg/ml for 48 h increased by 6 fold MMP-9 activity, measured by zymography, without affecting tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1. Boiled CRP at 5 mug/ml for 48 h unaffected MMP-9 activity. Fluvastatin blocked the CRP-induced increases in EMMPRIN and MMP-9 expression and activity. Diphenylene iodonium, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, had a similar effect on MMP-9 activity. Fluvastatin suppressed the CRP-induced increases in 8-epi-prostaglandin F(2alpha) levels in the condition media.", 
    "147": "CRP is an activator for macrophages to enhance EMMPRIN and MMP-9 expression. Fluvastatin inhibits them presumably through its antioxidant effect.", 
    "148": "Absorption enhancers (AEs) have been shown to be specific in permeation enhancement capabilities because of which they increase absorption of some drug molecules more than others. Present study was designed to investigate the relationship between lipophilicity of drug molecules and the absorption enhancement potential of AEs. Four drug molecules of different lipophilicity were selected as model compounds, namely, cefotaxime sodium, ceftazidime pentahydrate, lovastatin and cyclosporin A. Their apparent permeability coefficients in the absence and presence of three classes of AEs (fatty acids, cyclodextrins, and bile salts) were determined using in vitro everted rat intestinal sac absorption model. Significant relationship was observed between log P of drug and absorption enhancement ratios by AEs. This relationship was found to be functionally directly or indirectly proportional depending upon nature of AE and explain the mechanism of permeation enhancement.", 
    "149": "In major statin trials, the relative risk reduction is typically in the range 25-35%, thus indicating that the majority of cardiac events continues to occur despite statin therapy. Hence, there is a considerable interest in identifying novel therapies capable of further reducing cardiovascular disease risk. One such potential therapeutic target is a low level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Emerging targets involved in HDL metabolism are: (i) liver X receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists; (ii) cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors; (iii) HDL mimetics (ETC-216); (iv) apolipoprotein A-I synthetic peptides; and (v) HDL delipidation and reinfusion. Although they are at various stages of development, each of these therapies has promise for the treatment of cardiovascular disease in humans.", 
    "150": "Over the past decade, a large number of studies reported a prominent role of inflammation and immune response in atherosclerosis. Thus, therapeutic strategies to reduce inflammation could exert beneficial effects in the prevention of atherosclerosis progression. Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (statins) have demonstrated their capacity to greatly reduce coronary morbidity and mortality in both primary and secondary intervention trials. Furthermore, originally described as the most efficient drugs to reduce serum cholesterol, recent reports suggest that statins also confer cardiovascular benefits by their ability to modulate immuno-inflammatory processes. This review summarizes in vitro and in vivo evidence of immunomodulatory properties of statins.",

    "152": "Medical and ethical databases. Workshops with stakeholders.", 
    "153": "Literature was reviewed on exclusions in healthcare research and three workshops were held with stakeholders. Twenty-seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of statins use for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) and 25 NSAIDs trials for pain in osteoarthritis (OA) were analysed. Using a Scottish cohort with record-linkage, profiling was carried out for 3188 people needing secondary prevention for CHD (1993-1996), ascertaining the independent effects of statins, and 131,410 people dispensed NSAIDs (1989-1996), examining adverse effects. Routine data sources were accessed to profile the need for secondary prevention of CHD in England and usage was estimated by consulting published surveys. The Somerset and Avon Survey of Health (SASH) 1996-97 and published data were accessed for information on potential need and usage of NSAIDs in OA. For both drugs, the socio-demographic profiles of trial samples, the population in potential need and those on treatment were compared. An evidence synthesis was produced to clarify the effects of statins on women and older people and the relationship of absolute effectiveness outcomes with underlying risk levels of disease events was modelled, examining the likely effects of trial exclusions.", 
    "154": "The average age of statins trial participants was 58.5 years; only 16.3% were women. Statins reduced cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence by about 25% in both men and women. Older people up to 75 years of age also benefited. Meta-analysis and two landmark trials confirmed these results. The average age of NSAIDs trial participants was 61.9 years and women were well represented (68.5%). Gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events were commonly reported, but renal side-effects were not. Outcomes were seldom reported according to socio-demographic group. For both drugs, USA trials were more inclusive than UK/European trials. Ethnicity was not well reported for either drug. Some 23% of the cohort were treated with statins. Users were younger than non-statins users (but no more likely to be male) and had superior outcomes. High current exposure to NSAIDs elevated the risk of GI side-effects by about 50% versus no current exposure and renal impairment risk by nearly 140%. Side-effect risk increased with age; being female diminished risk. Approximately 537,000 incident cases of CVD would qualify for statins use in England each year. Women constitute 45% of this population with need, two-thirds of whom are aged 65 years or over. Need varies by ethnic group. No sex bias in prescribing statins was detected, but use was commoner in younger people. For NSAIDs, 6.3% of adults aged 35+ years reported hip and/or knee pain associated with OA; 3.9% of adults used prescribed analgesics for this and they were more likely to be women and to be >65 years old. For statins, women formed almost half of the 'with need' and 'on treatment' populations, but were markedly under-represented in trials. Those aged 65+ years formed nearly two-thirds of the 'with need' population, but only one-fifth of trial samples, and were less likely to be treated than younger subjects. For NSAIDs, women formed similar proportions. Associations of side-effects with socio-demographic factors was revealed in cohort data but not in trials.", 
    "155": "The issue of exclusion from trials of women, older people and ethnic minorities has been relatively neglected in the UK research community, and there is confusion about diversity issues. Under-representation occurs, but in drug trials at least this may not always affect the external validity of relative effect estimates. However, measures of absolute effectiveness, absolute harm and cost-effectiveness are associated with underlying risk levels in different socio-demographic groups. Under-representation will therefore bias absolute effect estimates. The following areas are suggested for future research: multi-disciplinary assessment of realistic options for trialists to address the issue of exclusions; clarification of the use of ethnic categories in health research and of the implications of the different dimensions of ageing and sex/gender; identification of barriers and facilitators to the involvement of different population groups in research, further investigation of the susceptibility of older men to NSAID adverse events, and the development of a 'register of registries and databases' and exploration of how linked health information systems in the UK could be improved.", 
    "156": "Elevated blood levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are associated with an increased risk for atherosclerotic coronary heart disease (CHD). Atorvastatin is a statin drug that inhibits 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (the rate-limiting step of cholesterol production) and primarily lowers LDL-C levels. Atorvastatin has also been shown to significantly reduce CHD events. However, as with all statins (and all other monotherapy lipid-altering drugs), atorvastatin alone reduces the risk of CHD in only a minority of patients relative to placebo. Conversely, it is low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol that are associated with increased CHD risk. Torcetrapib is a cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor that primarily raises high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibition has generally been shown to reduce atherosclerosis in rabbits. Taken together, atorvastatin and torcetrapib provide striking improvements in lipid levels, and complementary actions upon important lipid parameters. This review examines the chemistry, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, safety/tolerability and efficacy of the combination torcetrapib/atorvastatin agent that is currently in development and that provides complementary lipid benefits towards the goal of reducing CHD risk beyond that of atorvastatin alone.", 
    "157": "Atherosclerotic carotid artery disease is a major contributor to the incidence of stroke, particularly in the elderly. Atherosclerosis is a systemic illness and patients often present with multisystem involvement of several vascular beds including coronary, cerebral, and peripheral vascular territories. The majority of strokes related to carotid artery disease are embolic in nature, not occlusive. Non-invasive screening tests including ultrasound, CT angiography and MR angiography are helpful in identifying pathology. However, the gold standard, for diagnosis and treatment allocation remains invasive angiography. Medical therapy to reduce the risk of stroke includes antiplatelet agents, primarily aspirin in doses of 81 mg to 325 mg per day. Control of blood pressure and the use of statin therapy is effective in reducing the incidence of stroke. Carotid endarterectomy is more effective for preventing stroke in symptomatic (transient ischemic attack or stroke) patients with = or >50% diameter stenosis and asymptomatic patients with = or >60% diameter stenosis, than aspirin therapy. In patients at increased risk for surgical complications during stroke prevention surgery (carotid endarterectomy), carotid stents have been shown to be as good or better than surgery at improving outcomes.",

Outcomes of patients on statins versus those not on statins were compared using logistic regression to account for differences in patient characteristics, and propensity score methods to account for factors influencing patient allocation to statins.", 
    "160": "Eight hundred and fifteen of 2031 symptomatic patients and 665 of 1252 asymptomatic patients were on a statin at the time of hospital admission. Statin use by symptomatic patients was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality and in-hospital ischemic stroke or death, but not in-hospital cardiac outcomes (adjusted odds ratio 0.25 [CI, 0.07 to 0.90], 0.55 [CI, 0.32 to 0.95], 0.87 [CI, 0.49 to 1.54], respectively). The improvement in outcomes was robust when tested using propensity score matching. This association was not seen in asymptomatic patients on statins (adjusted odds ratio, in-hospital mortality 0.54 [CI, 0.13 to 2.24]; in-hospital ischemic stroke or death 1.34 [CI, 0.61 to 2.93]; in-hospital cardiac outcomes 1.37 [CI, 0.73 to 2.58]).",

    "162": "Three general classes of small, nonpeptide \"antigens\" activate Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells: pyrophosphomonoesters, such as isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (N-BPs), and alkylamines. However, we have shown recently that N-BPs indirectly activate Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells as a consequence of inhibition of farnesyl diphosphate synthase (a key enzyme of the mevalonate pathway) and the intracellular accumulation of IPP. We now show that alkylamines activate Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells by the same mechanism. Alkylamines were found to be weak inhibitors of farnesyl diphosphate synthase and caused accumulation of unprenylated Rap1A in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and macrophages, indicative of inhibition of the mevalonate pathway. Furthermore, as with N-BPs, the stimulatory effect of the alkylamines on Vgamma9Vdelta2T cells was abrogated by simultaneous treatment with mevastatin. These findings suggest that only pyrophosphomonoesters such as IPP are true Vgamma9Vdelta2 T-cell agonists, whereas alkylamines and N-BPs indirectly activate Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells through a common mechanism involving the accumulation of IPP."
