Cholesterol synthesis was determined by the conversion of [(14)C]-acetate to [(14)C]-cholesterol.", 
    "6": "Resveratrol potentiated the simvastatin-induced inhibition on cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. Inhibitory effects of resveratrol were partly abrogated by the addition of mevalonic acid, farnesyl pyrophosphate, and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Resveratrol reduced HMGCR expression and activity, and decreased cholesterol synthesis. In contrast, simvastatin inhibited HMGCR activity with a compensatory increase in HMGCR expression. Resveratrol counteracted this effect of simvastatin on HMGCR expression but augmented the simvastatin-induced inhibition on HMGCR activity and cholesterol synthesis.", 
    "7": "Resveratrol inhibits the mevalonate pathway via distinctly different mechanisms than statins. These observations demonstrate a novel mechanism of action of resveratrol and underscore the potential translational/clinical relevance of resveratrol interactions with simvastatin.", 
    "8": "Previously, we demonstrated that lovastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, induced apoptosis, differentiation, and inhibition of invasiveness of human anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cells (ATCs). Here, we further examined the effect of lovastatin on the growth of ARO cells. Lovastatin (0-20\u03bcM) concentration-dependently decreased cell number in cultured ATC and arrested the cell at the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Western blot analysis revealed that lovastatin caused an increase of the protein level of p27 and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4 and a decrease of the protein level of cyclin A2, cyclin D3, and phosphorylated Rb (pRb), but did not significantly change the protein levels of p21, cyclins D1 and E, and CDK2, in ARO cells. The formation of the CDK2-p27 complex was increased and the CDK2 activity was decreased in the lovastatin-treated ARO cells. Pretreatment of ARO cells with a p27, but not p21, antisense oligonucleotide prevented the lovastatin-induced G0/G1 arrest in ARO cells. The lovastatin-induced growth inhibition and translocation of RhoA and Rac1 in ARO cells were completely prevented by mevalonate and partially by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Treatment of ARO cells with Y27632, an inhibitor of Rho-associated kinase, abolished the GGPP-mediated prevention of lovastatin-induced anti-proliferation and up-regulation and prolonged degradation of p27. Taken together, these data suggest that lovastatin treatment caused a reduction of Rho geranylgeranylation, which in turn increased the expression and stability of p27, and then inhibited ARO cell proliferation. These data suggest that lovastatin merits further investigation as multipotent therapy for treatment ATC.",

Patients receiving statins were generally older (68.8 vs 61.1 years; P <.001) and more likely to be receiving a beta-blocker (50.3% vs 21.6%; P < .001). Statin use was associated with a lower unadjusted rate of POAF (2.6% vs 3.0%; P < .001). After adjustment for patient risk factors and surgery type, odds for POAF remained significantly lower among statin-treated patients (adjusted odds ratio = 0.79; 95% confidence interval = 0.71-0.87; P < .001). Statin use was not associated with differences in cost, length of stay, or mortality among patients who developed POAF.",

    "14": "Infrainguinal autogenous vein grafts are especially prone to narrowing and failure, and both inflammatory and thrombotic pathways are implicated. Platelets and monocytes are the key thrombo-inflammatory cells that arrive first at sites of vascular injury. These cells have potent interactions that recruit and activate one another, propagating thrombotic and inflammatory responses within the vessel wall. We therefore hypothesized that elevated levels of platelet-monocyte aggregates (PMA) might be associated with stenosis, and could possibly discriminate between patients with or without vein graft stenosis.", 
    "15": "Thirty-six vascular surgery patients were studied, in a stable quiescent period after infrainguinal autogenous vein graft bypasses for occlusive disease. Eighteen patients had hemodynamically significant graft stenoses confirmed by imaging, and 18 were free from stenosis. The level of PMA in whole blood was quantified after blood draw using two-color flow cytometry. Three measurements were made per sample: the basal, in-vivo level of aggregates (baseline PMA); the predisposition to spontaneously generate PMA (spontaneous PMA); and PMA generation by the addition of exogenous thrombin receptor-activating peptide (stimulated PMA). The baseline, in-vivo level of PMA was estimated by immediate flow analysis. The predisposition to spontaneously generate PMA was measured after in vitro incubation. Responsiveness to thrombin stimulation of the blood was quantified by the in vitro dose response to an exogenous thrombin receptor-activating peptide (sfllrn).", 
    "16": "Baseline PMA levels were similar in patients with vein graft stenosis vs nonstenosis (14.8% \u00b1 3.2 vs 10.1% \u00b1 1.5, respectively, mean \u00b1 SEM). However, patients with stenosis showed higher spontaneous PMA levels (58.5% \u00b1 4.5 vs 28.3% \u00b1 4.3; P < .001) and higher stimulated PMA levels (P < .001; analysis of variance). Covariables of smoking, diabetes, statin, or antithrombotic therapy could not account for these differences.", 
    "17": "Platelet-monocyte reactivity may play a role in the development of vein graft stenoses. Those with/without stenosis differed primarily in their threshold, or predisposition to form aggregates (spontaneous PMA), while their basal circulating levels of PMA (baseline PMA) were similar. These measurements may unmask pathologic differences in thrombo-inflammatory responsiveness that are not apparent in basal measurements. Understanding the causes and mechanisms leading to abnormal platelet-monocyte responses may improve approaches to predicting or preventing vein graft stenosis.", 
    "18": "Statins are selective inhibitors of 3-hydroxyl-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway for cholesterol biosynthesis. Increasing evidence indicates that statins, particularly atorvastatin, are neuroprotective in several conditions, including stroke, cerebral ischemia, traumatic brain injury, and excitotoxic amino acid exposure. However, only a few studies have investigated whether statins modulate seizure activity. In the current study we investigated whether atorvastatin or simvastatin alters the seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), a classical convulsant.", 
    "19": "Adult male Wistar rats were treated with atorvastatin or simvastatin for 7 days (10 mg/kg/day). Seizure activity was induced by PTZ (60 mg/kg, i.p.), and evaluated by behavioral and electrographic methods. Cholesterol levels were determined by a standard spectrophotometric method. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability was assessed by the fluorescein method. Atorvastatin levels in the plasma and cerebral cortex were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.", 
    "20": "We found that oral atorvastatin treatment increased the latency to PTZ-induced generalized seizures. In contrast, when the 7-day atorvastatin treatment was withheld for 1 day (i.e., atorvastatin withdrawal), PTZ-induced seizures were facilitated, as evidenced by a decrease in the latency to clonic and generalized tonic-clonic seizures induced by PTZ. In contrast, simvastatin treatment for 7 days (10 mg/kg/day, p.o.), with or without withdrawal, did not alter PTZ-induced seizures. Interestingly, the effects of atorvastatin treatment and withdrawal were not accompanied by changes in plasma or cerebral cortex cholesterol levels or in the BBB permeability. Atorvastatin levels in the plasma and cerebral cortex after 7 days of treatment were above the half maximal inhibitory concentration for inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, whereas atorvastatin was not detectable in the plasma or cerebral cortex following a 24 h washout period (atorvastatin withdrawal).", 
    "21": "We conclude that atorvastatin treatment and withdrawal have differential effects on pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures, which are not related to changes in plasma or cerebral cortex cholesterol levels or in BBB permeability. Additional studies are necessary to evaluate the molecular mechanisms underlying our findings as well as its clinical implications.", 
    "22": "New prognostic models are traditionally evaluated using measures of discrimination and risk reclassification, but these do not take full account of the clinical and health economic context. We propose a framework for comparing prognostic models by quantifying the public health impact (net benefit) of the treatment decisions they support, assuming a set of predetermined clinical treatment guidelines. The change in net benefit is more clinically interpretable than changes in traditional measures and can be used in full health economic evaluations of prognostic models used for screening and allocating risk reduction interventions. We extend previous work in this area by quantifying net benefits in life years, thus linking prognostic performance to health economic measures; by taking full account of the occurrence of events over time; and by considering estimation and cross-validation in a multiple-study setting. The method is illustrated in the context of cardiovascular disease risk prediction using an individual participant data meta-analysis. We estimate the number of cardiovascular-disease-free life years gained when statin treatment is allocated based on a risk prediction model with five established risk factors instead of a model with just age, gender and region. We explore methodological issues associated with the multistudy design and show that cost-effectiveness comparisons based on the proposed methodology are robust against a range of modelling assumptions, including adjusting for competing risks.", 
    "23": "Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, have been used clinically as a cholesterol-lowering drug to treat hyperlipidemia. In recent years, accumulating evidence indicates the possible beneficial effect of statins on osteoporosis. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of simvastatin on cell viability, apoptosis, and alkaline phosphatase activity in murine osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells treated by hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2), 100 \u03bcM). It was shown that simvastatin suppressed H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative stress and attenuated H(2)O(2)-induced cell injury including increasing osteoblastic viability, inhibiting apoptosis, and promoting differentiation. Then, we examined the effects of simvastatin (10(-7) M) on Nox1, Nox2, and Nox4 expressions in osteoblastic cells treated by H(2)O(2) (100 \u03bcM). We found that in MC3T3-E1 cells, H(2)O(2)-induced upregulation of Nox4 expression was inhibited by simvastatin, which was restored by farnesyl pyrophosphate (5 \u03bcM) as well as geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (5 \u03bcM). RNAi approach was used to reduce Nox4 protein levels in osteoblastic cells to explore its biological effects against H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative damage. When Nox4 expression was reduced in osteoblastic cells, H(2)O(2)-induced cell injury was attenuated markedly. We concluded that simvastatin protected osteoblast against H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative damage, at least in part, via inhibiting the upregulation of Nox4.", 
    "24": "Few studies have examined the early effects of statins on carotid artery elasticity, a potential surrogate marker of cardiovascular risk. This study examined the short-term effects of atorvastatin 80 mg daily on carotid elasticity measured by high-resolution B-mode ultrasound.", 
    "25": "The study included 40 stroke-free and statin-naive subjects older than age 45 (mean age, 70\u00b17 years; 55% men; 64% Caribbean-Hispanic). Outcome measures included carotid stiffness indices at 14 and 30 days after initiation of treatment. The systolic and diastolic diameters of the right common carotid artery were averaged from multiple B-mode imaging frames. Absolute and relative changes of strain [(systolic diameter-diastolic diameter)/diastolic diameter], stiffness (\u03b2) [ln (systolic/diastolic blood pressure)/strain], and distensibility (1/\u03b2 adjusted for wall thickness) from baseline were compared by the repeated measures t test and were considered significant at \u03b1=0.05.", 
    "26": "Baseline mean stiffness was 0.08 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.06-0.10). It significantly decreased at day 30 to 0.05 (CI, 0.04-0.06; P<0.01). Mean baseline distensibility was 15.25 (CI, 13.18-17.32), increasing significantly at day 30 to 17.23 (CI, 14.01-20.45; P<0.05). An improvement in distensibility of \u226510% from baseline was observed in 29 (73%) subjects. Changes in stiffness and distensibility were maximal among subjects with baseline low-density lipoprotein levels<130 mg/dL.", 
    "27": "Short-term treatment with high-dose atorvastatin was associated with improvement in the carotid elasticity metrics. Carotid artery elasticity measured by B-mode ultrasound is a simple noninvasive measure of arterial wall function and may be a useful surrogate end point in clinical trials targeting individuals at increased risk for atherosclerosis.", 
    "28": "Statins and nitrogenous bisphosphonates (NBP) inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme-A reductase (HMGCR) and farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPS), respectively, leading to depletion of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) and disruption of protein prenylation. Squalene synthase (SQS) utilizes FPP in the first committed step from the mevalonate pathway toward cholesterol biosynthesis. Herein, we have identified novel bisphosphonates as potent and specific inhibitors of SQS, including the tetrasodium salt of 9-biphenyl-4,8-dimethyl-nona-3,7-dienyl-1,1-bisphosphonic acid (compound 5). Compound 5 reduced cholesterol biosynthesis and lead to a substantial intracellular accumulation of FPP without reducing cell viability in HepG2 cells. At high concentrations, lovastatin and zoledronate impaired protein prenylation and decreased cell viability, which limits their potential use for cholesterol depletion. When combined with lovastatin, compound 5 prevented lovastatin-induced FPP depletion and impairment of protein farnesylation. Compound 5 in combination with the NBP zoledronate completely prevented zoledronate-induced impairment of both protein farnesylation and geranylgeranylation. Cotreatment of cells with compound 5 and either lovastatin or zoledronate was able to significantly prevent the reduction of cell viability caused by lovastatin or zoledronate alone. The combination of an SQS inhibitor with an HMGCR or FDPS inhibitor provides a rational approach for reducing cholesterol synthesis while preventing nonsterol isoprenoid depletion.", 
    "29": "Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) has been recently implicated in inflammatory pathways involved in carotid plaque destabilization. Given that statins have plaque stabilization and inflammation reduction effects, we investigated whether TLR4 expression on carotid atherosclerotic plaques correlates with statin intake. Carotid atherosclerotic plaques were obtained on 140 patients (preoperative statin intake, n = 70). TLR4 immunohistochemical expression was investigated in endothelial cells (ECs), macrophages (MACs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) of carotid atheroma. TLR4 positivity, over-expression and intensity of immunostaining were compared in statin versus no-statin users. The results of this study showed that statin users had a significantly lower expression of TLR4 in ECs (P = 0.02, 0.001, 0.006 for TLR4 positivity, increased intensity and over-expression, respectively). Similarly, TLR4 positivity was less pronounced in carotid plaque MACs of statin users (P = 0.03). No carotid specimen with increased EC TLR4 intensity or over-expression was observed among statin users. The prevalence of any cerebrovascular accident was 61.4% in the 'no statin' versus 18.6% in the 'statin' group (odds ratio for statin use: 0.14, 95% CI: 0.07-0.31, P < 0.001). In conclusion, statin treatment is associated with attenuated TLR4 expression on human carotid atherosclerotic plaques and a reduced risk of carotid-related cerebrovascular events. TLR4 may potentially mediate statins' plaque stabilization effects. Further investigation is necessary.", 
    "30": "Statins have been widely used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, and recent studies have shown that these drugs also affect bone metabolism. The aim of this experiment was to follow the effect of atorvastatin on bone metabolism in male albino Wistar rats.", 
    "31": "Our study was carried out on 16 rats (240 +/- 10g) which were randomly divided into 2 groups of 8 animals. The control group (CO) was given aqua pro injectione (0.2 mL/100 g BW; gavage) and the experimental group atorvastatin suspension (AT; 0.3 mg in 0.2 mL aqua pro inj./100 g BW; gavage) daily for 8 weeks. We examined serum markers of bone turnover using ELISA - C-terminal crosslinking telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-I), total osteocalcin (total OC), procollagen type I N propeptide (PINP) and bone alkaline phosphatase (bone ALP). We investigated bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) in the proximal tibia using Western blot analysis. Additionally, we measured bone mineral density (BMD). The femurs were used for a three-point bending test and compression test of the femoral neck.", 
    "32": "After 8 weeks of atorvastatin administration, a significant decrease was found in serum level of bone ALP to 30% vs. CO (p = 0.005). PINP, CTX-I and OC did not change significantly. The expression of BMP-2 was increased. There were no significant differences in BMD measurements, three-point bending test or compression test of the femoral neck.", 
    "33": "Our results suggest that atorvastatin has a positive effect on bone metabolism in rats by maintenance of BMD and the biomechanical characteristics of bone. Atorvastatin influenced bone metabolism by decreasing bone ALP, and probably in consequence increasing expression of BMP-2 in rats.",

    "35": "The Swiss Health Surveys (SHS, N = 49,245) and CoLaus study (N = 6,710) were used. Immigrant groups from France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, former Yugoslavia, other European and other countries were defined.", 
    "36": "Immigrants from Italy, France, Portugal, Spain and former Yugoslavia presented a higher prevalence of smoking than Swiss nationals. Immigrants reported less hypertension than Swiss nationals, but the differences were reduced when blood pressure measurements were used. The prevalence of dyslipidaemia was similar between immigrants and Swiss nationals in the SHS. When eligibility for statin treatment was assessed, immigrants from Italy were more frequently eligible than Swiss nationals. Immigrants from former Yugoslavia presented a lower prevalence of diabetes in the SHS, but a higher prevalence in the CoLaus study. Most differences between immigrant groups and Swiss nationals disappeared after adjusting for age, leisure-time physical activity, being overweight/obesity and education.", 
    "37": "Most CVRFs are unevenly distributed among immigrant groups in Switzerland, but these differences are due to disparities in age, leisure-time physical activity, being overweight/obesity and education.", 
    "38": "To study the whole-body cholesterol metabolism in man, cholesterol synthesis and absorption need to be measured. Because of the complicated methods of the measurements, new approaches were developed including the analysis of serum non-cholesterol sterols. In current lipidologic papers and even in intervention studies, serum non-cholesterol sterols are frequently used as surrogate markers of cholesterol metabolism without any validation to the absolute metabolic variables. The present review compares serum non-cholesterol sterols with absolute measurements of cholesterol synthesis and absorption in published papers to find out whether the serum markers are valid indicators of cholesterol metabolism in various conditions.", 
    "39": "During statin treatment, during interventions of dietary fat, and in type 2 diabetes the relative and absolute variables of cholesterol synthesis and absorption were frequently but not constantly correlated with each other. In some occasions, especially in subjects with apolipoprotein E3/4 and E4/4 phenotypes, the relative metabolic markers were even more sensitive than the absolute ones to reflect changes in cholesterol metabolism during dietary interventions. Even in general population at very high absorption the homeostasis of cholesterol metabolism is disturbed damaging the validity of the serum markers.", 
    "40": "It is worth using several instead of only one precursor and absorption sterol marker for making conclusions of altered synthesis or absorption of cholesterol, and even then the presence of at least some absolute measurement is valuable. During consumption of plant sterol-enriched diets and in situations of interfered cholesterol homeostasis the relative markers do not adequately reflect cholesterol metabolism. Accordingly, the validity of the relative markers of cholesterol metabolism should not be considered as self-evident.", 
    "41": "Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 signal plays an important role in immunity in coronary artery disease (CAD). A recent report has demonstrated that one of the let-7 family microRNAs, let-7i, directly regulates Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression and contributes to immune response. The aim of this study was to determine whether let-7i is expressed with TLR4 in patients with CAD, and whether statins (atorvastatin or rosuvastatin) might affect these levels. To determine the effects of let-7i on TLR4 expression, human THP-1 cells transfected with let-7i were analyzed for TLR4 levels. This study included 98 patients with CAD and 48 subjects without CAD (non-CAD). Patients with CAD were randomized to 12 months of treatment with atorvastatin or rosuvastatin. Monocytes were obtained from peripheral blood at baseline and after 12 months of each type of therapy. Levels of let-7i and TLR4 were measured by real-time RT-PCR and FACS. Functional approaches to let-7i showed that transfection of let-7i into human THP-1 cells resulted in regulation of TLR4 expression. Levels of let-7i were lower in the CAD group than in the non-CAD group (0.98\u00b10.42 vs. 4.65\u00b11.21, P<0.01). There was a negative correlation between let-7i and TLR4 levels in patients with CAD (let-7i vs. TLR4 mRNA: r=-0.60, P<0.01; let-7i vs. TLR4 MFI: r=-0.32, P<0.01). The atorvastatin group had markedly increased let-7i levels and diminished TLR4 levels (all P<0.01), whereas the rosuvastatin group showed no change in these levels. This study suggests that atorvastatin down-regulates TLR4 signal via let-7i expression in CAD patients, possibly contributing to the beneficial effects of atorvastatin on let-7i-mediated TLR4 signal in this disorder.",

Noncoronary atherosclerosis was defined as coexistent, clinically recognized arterial disease other than coronary artery disease (CAD) (cerebral, aortic, or lower extremity). Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) was performed to assess non-culprit coronary atherosclerosis at baseline and at 8-12 months follow-up. Serial IVUS examinations were obtained in 252 patients. Atheroma volume and percent change in atheroma volume of the target plaque was assessed.",

Although the baseline plaque volume was similar in the two groups (59 vs. 57 mm(3)), patients of the CAD+PVD group showed milder regression of atherosclerosis than those of the CAD-only group (-8.9% vs. -18.2%, p = 0.005). This difference remained significant even after adjustment for coronary risk factors including age and serum LDL-C (p = 0.047).",

    "46": "Cholesterol is highly enriched in the brain, and plays a key role in synapse formation and function. The brain does not derive cholesterol from the circulation; instead, the majority of cholesterol is made in glia and secreted in form of lipoproteins. Neurons can synthesize cholesterol, but the extent of neuronal cholesterol biosynthesis in the adult brain is unknown. Cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors of the statin family are widely used to lower circulating cholesterol and cardiovascular risk. Lipophilic statins can cross the blood brain barrier and inhibit brain cholesterol biosynthesis with possible consequences for synaptic cholesterol homeostasis. We have investigated the effects of lovastatin on synapse maturation and synaptic vesicle release. Treatment of primary hippocampal neurons with low levels of lovastatin for one week reduced synapse density and impaired synaptic vesicle release. Neither lipoproteins nor geranylgeraniol fully counteracted the lovastatin-induced decrease of synaptic vesicle exocytosis, even when cholesterol depletion was prevented. In contrast, restoration of neuronal cholesterol synthesis with mevalonate prevented defects in vesicle exocytosis without fully normalizing neuronal cholesterol content. These results raise the possibility that chronic exposure of neurons to lipophilic statins may affect synaptic transmission, and indicate that hippocampal neurons need a certain level of endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis.",

The aim of this study was to describe discontinuation among patients with type 2 diabetes prescribed statins prior to and after initiation of oral anti-diabetics and to compare statin discontinuation with discontinuation of oral anti-diabetics.", 
    "49": "We report an observational cohort study among patients initiating treatment with statins prior to or after initiation of oral anti-diabetics between 1999 and 2007. Patients were classified as starting statins prior to initiation (Prior users) or after initiation (After users) of anti-diabetics.

Discontinuation rates for statins were higher compared with oral anti-diabetics (52.1 vs 15.0%). After users discontinued statin therapy more frequently compared to prior users (62.8 vs 48.2%). Discontinuation of statins is higher compared with anti-diabetic discontinuation. Patients starting statins after the initiation of oral anti-diabetic treatment are more likely to discontinue treatment than patients who initiate statins before the start of oral anti-diabetics.",

Experimental studies and some clinical studies have shown that statin therapy can reduce central sympathetic activity. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which is standard treatment for CKD, is known to lower sympathetic activity. We hypothesized that adding a statin for 6 weeks to RAS blockade would further lower sympathetic activity in hypertensive stage 2-4 CKD patients.",

In this meta-analysis, one additional patient developed diabetes for every three patients protected from a major cardiovascular event. The observation of higher diabetes risk remains unexplained at present, although studies in animal models suggest the possibility of impaired peripheral insulin signalling induced by statin therapy.",

Despite widespread recognition of significant adverse outcomes, pharmacologic approaches to prevent or treat delirium during critical illness remain unproven. We hypothesize that commonly prescribed statin medications may prevent and treat delirium by targeting molecular pathways of inflammation (peripheral and central) and microglial activation that are central to the pathogenesis of delirium. Systemic inflammation, a principal mechanism of injury, for example, in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and other critical illnesses, can cause neuronal apoptosis, blood-brain barrier injury, brain ischemia, and microglial activation. We hypothesize that the known pleiotropic effects of statins, which attenuate such neuroinflammation, may redirect microglial activation and promote an antiinflammatory phenotype, thereby offering the potential to reduce the public health burden of delirium and its associated long-term cognitive injury.",

Niacin is a lipid-altering drug that has been used to lower cholesterol since the 1950s. In addition to its LDL-C-lowering effects, niacin is the most effective agent currently available for raising HDL-C. Despite its long history as a lipid-altering drug, only limited data are available regarding its clinical benefit alone and in combination with other agents, and the majority of studies investigating its impact on clinical outcomes are from the pre-statin area. Several studies have demonstrated a beneficial effect of treatment with niacin in combination with statin therapy on surrogate cardiovascular markers (e.g. carotid intima-media thickness). However, the clinical significance of these surrogate markers has been questioned. Two large randomized trials will address whether niacin-statin combination therapy is an appropriate therapeutic alternative to statin monotherapy.",

Taken the advantage of high homology between DKR and human heart 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HAD), a molecular model was created to compare the tertiary structures of DKR and HAD. In addition to the possible participation of His-143 in the enzyme catalysis by pH profile, three key amino acid residues, Ser-122, His-143 and Glu-155, were identified and mutated to explore the possibility of involving in the catalytic process. The catalytic activities for mutants S122A/C, H143A/K and E155Q were below detectable level, while their binding affinities to the diketo ester substrate and cofactor NADH did not change obviously. The experimental results were further supported by molecular docking, suggesting that Ser-122 and His-143 were essential for the proton transfer to the carbonyl functional groups of the substrate. Moreover, Glu-155 was crucial for maintaining the proper orientation and protonation of the imidazole ring of His-143 for efficient catalysis.", 
    "73": "Nitric oxide (NO), the smallest signalling molecule known, is produced by three isoforms of NO synthase (NOS; EC 1.14.13.39). They all utilize l-arginine and molecular oxygen as substrates and require the cofactors reduced nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), flavin mononucleotide (FMN), and (6R-)5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)). All NOS bind calmodulin and contain haem. Neuronal NOS (nNOS, NOS I) is constitutively expressed in central and peripheral neurons and some other cell types. Its functions include synaptic plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS), central regulation of blood pressure, smooth muscle relaxation, and vasodilatation via peripheral nitrergic nerves. Nitrergic nerves are of particular importance in the relaxation of corpus cavernosum and penile erection. Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil) require at least a residual nNOS activity for their action. Inducible NOS (NOS II) can be expressed in many cell types in response to lipopolysaccharide, cytokines, or other agents. Inducible NOS generates large amounts of NO that have cytostatic effects on parasitic target cells. Inducible NOS contributes to the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases and septic shock. Endothelial NOS (eNOS, NOS III) is mostly expressed in endothelial cells. It keeps blood vessels dilated, controls blood pressure, and has numerous other vasoprotective and anti-atherosclerotic effects. Many cardiovascular risk factors lead to oxidative stress, eNOS uncoupling, and endothelial dysfunction in the vasculature. Pharmacologically, vascular oxidative stress can be reduced and eNOS functionality restored with renin- and angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors, with angiotensin receptor blockers, and with statins.",

We investigated changes of lipid profiles, biochemical markers, adverse events, and clinical outcomes up to 12 months. During the study 318 events overall occurred in 220 patients (21.2%) who reported \u22651 treatment emergent adverse event, although 20 events in 14 patients (1.4%) were treatment-related adverse events. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol percent change was -25.6% and LDL cholesterol target attainment was 70.5% at 12-month follow-up. Levels of creatinine phosphokinase, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, glutamic pyruvic transaminase, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein decreased significantly during the first 1 month of pitavastatin treatment and were sustained to 12-month follow-up. Major adverse cardiac events occurred in 66 patients (7.3%). All-cause deaths occurred in 32 patients (3.5%) including 19 (2.1%) cardiac deaths and recurrent MIs occurred in 14 (1.6%) and target lesion revascularizations in 42 (4.7%).

Increase in GIR induced by pravastatin was not abolished by NO synthase inhibitor, l-NAME, indicating that this effect did not result from the improvement of endothelial function. Atorvastatin increased fasting insulin, HOM-IR, NEFA and glycerol levels as well as reduced GIR. Statins had no effect on leptin, HMW adiponectin, resistin, visfatin, interleukin-6 and TNF-\u03b1. Pravastatin increased plasma concentrations of 25-hydroxy- and 1,25-dyhydroxyvitamin D(3) (25-OH-D(3) and 1,25-(OH)(2)-D(3)), and its effect on insulin sensitivity was mimicked by exogenous 1,25-(OH)(2)-D(3). Atorvastatin reduced plasma 25-OH-D(3) but had no effect on 1,25-(OH)(2)-D(3).

To investigate the effects of atorvastatin on experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN), an animal model of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), atorvastatin was administered to Lewis rats immunized with bovine peripheral myelin in complete Freund's adjuvant. We found that atorvastatin ameliorated the clinical symptoms of EAN, decreased the numbers of inflammatory cells as well as IFN-\u03b3(+) and IL-17(+) cells in sciatic nerves, decreased the CD80 expression and increased the number of CD25(+)Foxp3(+) cells in mononuclear cells (MNC), and decreased the levels of IFN-\u03b3 in MNC culture supernatants. These data provide strong evidence that atorvastatin can act as an inhibitor in EAN by inhibiting the immune response of Th1 and Th17, decreasing the expression of co-stimulatory molecule, and up-regulating the number of T regulatory cells. These data demonstrated that statins could be used as a therapeutic strategy in human GBS in future.", 
    "93": "Pharmacologic treatment of hyperlipidemia in conjunction with therapeutic lifestyle changes can be used for both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Statins have the most convincing data for primary prevention, especially for higher risk patients. Therefore, risk stratification is essential. Statin therapy is also recommended for secondary prevention in all patients with known cardiovascular disease or the risk equivalent. High-dose statins should be initiated in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Omega-3 fatty acids may be a good alternative after myocardial infarction for patients who cannot tolerate statins. Fibrates and niacin have not been shown to reduce all-cause mortality in secondary prevention, but may be useful adjuncts when statins alone cannot adequately control lipid levels. Other cholesterol-lowering medications used for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease have not been shown to consistently improve patient-oriented outcomes.

Two compounds, diallyl disulphide (DADS), an important component of garlic oil, and lovastatin, an inhibitor of a key enzyme of methanogenic Archaea, were selected on the basis of their in vitro anti-methanogenic potential. In three 23-day experimental runs, six sheep received hay and concentrate in a duplicate 3 x 3 Latin square design. The concentrate was either not supplemented or supplemented with either 4 g DADS or 80 mg lovastatin per kg of total dietary dry matter. There were no refusals of concentrate for any treatment. Respiratory measurements were conducted on experimental days 7/8 (Period 1) and days 17/18 (Period 2). Relative to the control, digestibility of neutral detergent fibre (NDF) tended to increase (p = 0.09) with DADS by 14%. This was associated with an increased (p = 0.07) body energy retention of the animals. Effects on nitrogen balance and ruminal fermentation traits were never significant. No influence of supplements or period was found on total daily CH4 production which averaged at 28.6 g per sheep. However, across both periods the amount of CH4 produced per kg NDF digested was lower (-8%; p = 0.02) with DADS than without supplementation, and the lovastatin treatment ranged in between. In conclusion, the study demonstrated a certain potential of DADS to improve fibre digestion and body energy retention and to limit CH4 formation in relation to digestible fibre intake, while lovastatin remained ineffective.", 
    "95": "The effect of Monascus purpureus red mould rice (RMR) on modulation of lipid metabolism and oxidative stress was studied in hypercholesterolemic rats. Cholesterol feeding for 14 weeks caused a significant increase in the lipid peroxides and total thiols and antioxidant enzymes, viz. glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GRd), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in serum and liver in comparison to the control group. However, supplementation of RMR to hypercholesterolemic rats at 8, 12 and 16% significantly increased the GRd, GPx, SOD and CAT activities in serum and liver tissues. Furthermore, RMR feeding significantly decreased total thiols and lipid peroxides and also increased other antioxidant molecules such as glutathione and ascorbic acid in high-cholesterol fed rats. The efficiency of RMR (16%) in modulating the antioxidant molecules and antioxidant enzymes is comparable to standard drug-lovastatin. Thus, this study suggests that the long-term administration of RMR may play an important role in suppressing oxidative stress and, thus, may be useful for the prevention and/or early treatment of hypercholesterolemia.",

These effects may contribute to the protective effect of statins against ischemia and reperfusion (IR). Interestingly, pleiotropic effects have been shown to differ between hydrophilic and lipophilic statins. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) represents a largely nitric oxide-mediated, endothelium-dependent dilation and has been shown to decrease after exposure to IR in humans. FMD has been validated to study (pharmacological) interventions in IR injury. We examined the effect of a short-term (3-7 days) statin pretreatment on brachial artery endothelial function before and after IR, and whether the effect on brachial artery endothelial function differs between rosuvastatin (hydrophilic statin) and atorvastatin (lipophilic statin). Our results show that IR significantly decreases FMD; however, statin pretreatment did not alter the effect of IR on FMD (irrespective of treatment duration or type of statin used). This experiment suggests that the cardioprotective effects of statins (both lipophilic and hydrophilic) against IR are not mediated through preservation of endothelial function.",

This article reviews some commonly used adaptive strategies in early-phase stroke trials and discusses their associated costs. Specifically, we illustrate the trade-offs in several clinical contexts, including dose-finding in the Neuroprotection with Statin Therapy for Acute Recovery Trial (NeuSTART), futility analyses and internal pilot in Phase 2 proof-of-concept trials, and sample size considerations in an imaging-based dose-selection trial. Through these illustrations, we demonstrate the potential tension between the perspectives of an individual investigator and that of the broader community of stakeholders. This understanding is critical to appreciate the limitations, as well as the full promise, of adaptive designs, so that investigators can deploy an appropriate statistical design--be it adaptive or not--in a clinical study.", 
    "115": "The aim of this review is to provide useful information not only for studying the effect of OATP1B1 and/or BCRP gene mutation on pharmacokinetics of novle statins of pitavastatin and rosuvastatin but also for studying drug-drug interactions (DDI) between the novle statins and other substrates of OATP1B1 and/or BCRP. Intra- and inter-ethnic differences in pharmacokinetic profiles of clinically relevant drugs are important issues reported in many papers not only for scenes of appropriate drug used in clinical settings but also for those of the drug development. Pharmacogenomics is extremely useful for understanding these racial differences. Recent pharmacogenetics study have disclosed important roles of drug transporters in the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of some clinically relevant drugs. In this presentation, we introduce single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of OATP1B1 and BCRP and review the contribution of genetic polymorphisms of the transporters to the pharmacokinetics of dual substrates as pitavastatin and rosuvastatin from recent study. At the same time, the DDIs between pitavastatin or rosuvastatin and other drug have been extensively concerned because of inhibiting OATP1B1-mediated hepatic uptake or BCRP-mediated hepatic efflux of pitavastatin and rosuvastatin. This review summarized the current studies about the role of OATP1B1 and BCRP in DDIs between pitavastatin or rosuvastatin and other clinically relevant drugs. The role of OATP1B1 and BCRP gene mutation can affect the PK profiles of pitavastatin and rosuvastatin. The DDIs between the novle statins and other substrates of OATP1B1 or BCRP may occur and cause change in the pharmacokinetic of the novle statins.",

Atorvastatin is known to exert pleiotropic effects on cardiovascular system. This study was designed to examine the effect of atorvastatin on homocysteine (Hcy)-induced activation of ER stress and the potential mechanisms regarding AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).", 
    "117": "Apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE(-/-)) mice were administrated with methionine or atorvastatin and sacrificed 2 months later for plasma tests and immunohistochemical analysis. To further study the mechanisms, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated with various concentrations of Hcy for 1 h, or 500 \u03bcmol/L Hcy for 1-24 h. Furthermore, we challenged HUVECs with Hcy in the presence or absence of atorvastatin, 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside-l-beta-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR), an AMPK agonist, and AMPK-DN that expressed a dominant-negative mutant of AMPK. Expression levels of ER stress markers were measured by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. Our data revealed that atorvastatin prevented Hcy-induced ER stress in the aortic roots of hyperhomocysteinemic mice. In vitro study showed atorvastatin suppressed Hcy-induced ER stress in HUVECs as well. AICAR is found to have the same effect as that of atorvastatin, which could be antagonized by AMPK-DN.",

    "119": "Endothelial dysfunction is a marker for development and progression of atherosclerosis. Statin therapy improves endothelial function in cardiovascular patients by reducing LDL-cholesterol and by pleiotropic effects. B-group vitamin supplementation restores endothelial function mainly by reducing homocysteine-induced oxidative stress. Thus, we evaluated the effect of rosuvastatin, B-group vitamins and their combination on endothelial function in high-risk cardiovascular patients.", 
    "120": "Thirty-six patients with cardiovascular disease were randomly, double-blinded assigned to either rosuvastatin 10 mg (group R, n = 18) or vitamin supplementation consisting of folic acid 1 mg, vitamin B12 0.4 mg, and B6 10 mg (group V, n = 18) for 6 weeks. After 6 weeks all patients received rosuvastatin and vitamin supplementation in combination for additional 6 weeks. Endothelial function was assessed by flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) at baseline and after 6- and 12-week treatment.", 
    "121": "At baseline, FMD, plasma lipids, vitamins, and homocysteine were comparable between both groups. After 6 weeks, FMD improved in both groups (from 4.4 \u00b1 1.6 to 6.9 \u00b1 1.4% group R, P= 0.0004 and from 4.9 \u00b1 1.8 to 6.4 \u00b1 1.8% group V, P= 0.0002). This improvement in FMD was mainly associated with a decrease of plasma lipids in group R and a decrease of homocysteine in group V. After 12 weeks, the combined therapy with rosuvastatin and vitamins further improved FMD to the normal range in 26/33 patients compared to 5/36 at baseline (P < 0.0001).", 
    "122": "In conclusion, both treatments, rosuvastatin and B-group vitamin supplementation, improved endothelial function in high-risk cardiovascular patients. The combination of both therapies had an additive effect on endothelial function suggesting different mechanisms of action.", 
    "123": "Statin myopathy is a generally encountered side effect of statin usage. Both muscle symptoms and a raised serum creatine kinase (CK) are used in case definition, but these are common manifestations of other conditions, which may not be statin related. Statin rechallenge assuming no contraindication in selected cases is an option before considering a different class of lipid-lowering agent.", 
    "124": "We aim to characterize retrospectively the patients referred to our Lipid Clinic with a diagnosis of statin myopathy. The tolerability of different statins was assessed to determine a strategy for rechallenging statins in such patients in the future.",

They are predominantly female (62.0%), Caucasian (63.9%), with a mean age of 58.3 years and mean body mass index (BMI) of 29.3 kg/m(2). The serum CK and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were statistically higher compared to patients with statin intolerances with no muscular component or CK elevations. Secondary causes of statin myopathy were implicated in 2.7% of cases. Following statin myopathy to simvastatin we found no statistical difference between the tolerability rates between atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, and fluvastatin. Fibrates, cholestyramine, and ezetimibe were statistically better tolerated in these patients.", 
    "126": "Statin rechallenge is a real treatment option in patients with statin myopathy. Detailed history and examination is required to exclude muscle diseases unrelated to statin usage. In patients developing statin myopathy on simvastatin, we did not find any statistical difference between subsequent tolerability rates to rosuvastatin, pravastatin, and fluvastatin.", 
    "127": "Alpha-secretase-mediated cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) releases the neuroprotective APP fragment s\u03b1APP and prevents amyloid \u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) generation. Moreover, \u03b1-secretase-like cleavage of the A\u03b2 transporter 'receptor for advanced glycation end products' counteracts the import of blood A\u03b2 into the brain. Assuming that A\u03b2 is responsible for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), activation of \u03b1-secretase should be preventive. \u03b1-Secretase-mediated APP cleavage can be activated via several G protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases. Protein kinase C, mitogen-activated protein kinases, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, cAMP and calcium are activators of receptor-induced \u03b1-secretase cleavage. Selective targeting of receptor subtypes expressed in brain regions affected by AD appears reasonable. Therefore, the PACAP receptor PAC1 and possibly the serotonin 5-HT(6) receptor subtype are promising targets. Activation of APP \u03b1-secretase cleavage also occurs upon blockade of cholesterol synthesis by statins or zaragozic acid A. Under physiological statin concentrations, the brain cholesterol content is not influenced. Statins likely inhibit A\u03b2 production in the blood by \u03b1-secretase activation which is possibly sufficient to inhibit AD development. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) acts as \u03b1-secretase on APP. By targeting the nuclear retinoic acid receptor \u03b2, the expression of ADAM10 and non-amyloidogenic APP processing can be enhanced. Excessive activation of ADAM10 should be avoided because ADAM10 and also ADAM17 are not APP-specific. Both ADAM proteins cleave various substrates, and therefore have been associated with tumorigenesis and tumor progression.", 
    "128": "Mevinolin (MVN) has been used clinically for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia with very good tolerance by patients. Based on epidemiological evidences, MVN was suggested strongly for the treatment of neoplasia. Early experimental trials suggested the mixed apoptotic/necrotic cell death pathway was activated in response to MVN exposure. Herein, the cytotoxic profile of MVN was evaluated, compared to the robust and frequently used anti-cancer drug doxorubicin (DOX), against breast (MCF-7), cervical (HeLa) and liver (HepG(2)) transformed cell lines. MVN was showed comparable results in cytotoxic profile with DOX in all tested solid tumor cell lines. In addition, the MVN-induced cytotoxicity was inferred to be multi-factorial and not solely dependent on p53 expression. It was concluded that molecular and genetic assessment of MVN-induced cell death would be useful for developing cancer therapeutic treatments.",

It is associated with a specific metabolic syndrome, HCV-associated dysmetabolic syndrome (HCADS), consisting of steatosis, hypocholesterolemia and insulin resistance/diabetes. These metabolic derangements contribute to a decrease in sustained virological response (SVR) to pegylated-interferon-\u03b1-ribavirin as standard of care (SOC), and are associated with progression of liver fibrosis.", 
    "130": "The review, highlighting the impact of HCADS and metabolic syndrome components of HCV disease progression and SOC, discusses current knowledge and perspectives on metabolic therapeutic strategies aimed at improving SVR rate of SOC for chronic hepatitis C.", 
    "131": "HCV, features of HCADS and of metabolic syndrome may coexist in the same patient, thus all components of the metabolic syndrome must be assessed to individualize treatment. The results of therapeutic trials evaluating metabolic strategies combined with current SOC indicate that weight loss is a critical part of treatment which will improve both disease outcome and therapeutic response to SOC. Similarly, statins seem to improve response rate to SOC representing, once confirmed to be safe, an important therapeutic tool for HCV-infected patients. Findings from studies using insulin sensitizers combined with SOC are not conclusive and do not justify the use of this class of drugs in clinical practice.", 
    "132": "This study is to report the effect of OATP1B1 gene mutation in the 521T --> C in Chinese human on the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin and guide the reasonable clinical application of rosuvastatin by the feature of genetic polymorphism of OATP1B1. Plasma samples were determined with LC-MS: the analyte and internal standard pitavastatin were both analyzed by MS in the ESI, m/z was 480.0 for rosuvastatin and 420.0 for the IS, separately. Genotyping of OATP1B1 was determined with the method of polymerase chain reaction--amplification refractory mutation system targeted at 40 healthy volunteers and showed that there were 7 subjects with 521T --> C mutant, accounting to 17.5% of total and wild type homozygote accounted to 82.5%. It was found that there were significant differences between OATP1B1 mutation in the 521T --> C and wild type homozygote for rosuvastatin pharmacokinetic process in Chinese human. In contrast to OATP1B1 wild type group, OATP1B1 mutation group's absorption degree increased, elimination process decreased. The OATP1B1 mutation should be noted for guiding the reasonable application of rosuvastatin during its clinical use.", 
    "133": "Among several beneficial cardiovascular actions of statins, experimental studies have suggested that statins may also induce a mild blood pressure (BP) reduction. However, clinical data were controversial and the potential hypotensive statin effect remains uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the effect of atorvastatin on ambulatory BP in patients with mild hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia. A total of 50 patients with mild hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia participated in this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Patients were randomized to either 10 mg atorvastatin or placebo for 26 weeks. Background antihypertensive treatment, if any, remained unchanged during follow-up. At baseline and study-end (26 weeks), ambulatory BP monitoring and blood sampling for determination of standard biochemical and safety parameters were performed in all participants. BP loads were defined as the percentage of BP measurements exceeding the hypertension threshold of 140/90 mm\u2009Hg for daytime and 125/75 mm\u2009Hg nighttime period. Atorvastatin significantly reduced 24-h systolic and diastolic BP (DBP; median (range)) as compared with placebo (-5.0 (-21.0, 4.0) vs +1.0 (-6.0, 7.0) mm\u2009Hg, P<0.001 and -3.0 (-16.0, 2.0) vs +0.1 (-7, 4) mm\u2009Hg, P<0.01, respectively). Reductions in systolic and DBP loads during follow-up were also evident in the atorvastatin, but not in the placebo group. BP-lowering effects of atorvastatin were consistent in both daytime and nighttime periods. This study shows a mild, but consistent throughout the 24-h period BP-lowering effect of atorvastatin in patients with mild hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia. This beneficial effect of atorvastatin on BP may represent another pathway through which this drug class provides cardiovascular risk reduction.",

    "135": "Human mesangial cells (HMCs) grown at 5.5 (normal glucose) or 22\u200ammol/l (high glucose) glucose or exposed to FFA were treated with angiotensin-II in the presence or absence of rosuvastatin. We measured MMP-2, MMP-9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), and TIMP-2 expression and activity, and quantified the fibrotic factors transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), fibronectin, and collagen IV.", 
    "136": "At normal glucose, angiotensin-II induced a dose-dependent downregulation of MMP-2; rosuvastatin reversed this effect. On the contrary, TIMP-2 and MMP-9 were upregulated by angiotensin-II and downregulated by rosuvastatin; the effects on TIMP-1 were negligible. Some of the angiotensin-II effects were potentiated in the presence of high glucose and FFA; under both conditions, rosuvastatin was able to reverse these effects. MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity followed the same trend of expression, with rosuvastatin able to upregulate MMP-2 activity. The modulation of the MMP/TIMP system was paralleled by an increase in TGF-\u03b21, fibronectin, and collagen-IV; all were reduced by rosuvastatin treatment. Silencing the MMP-2 gene confirmed its role in modulating some of these angiotensin-II effects.", 
    "137": "Angiotensin-II induces a pro-fibrotic response in HMCs mainly via a dysregulation of the MMP-2/TIMP-2 pattern.

Patients were divided into two groups to examine the influence of statins: those with preoperative statin therapy (Statin group, n = 77) and those without it (Non-statin group, n = 126). In addition, patients were divided into two groups to determine the independent predictors for postoperative AF: those with postoperative AF (AF group, n = 54) and those without it (Non-AF group, n = 149).

    "144": "Forty of the 412 VKA-treated patients (9.7%) exhibited oral anticoagulant related overcoagulation. VKA overcoagulation was associated with high morbidity, leading to major bleeding in 27.5% of cases; moreover, 12.5% of these patients died, death being mainly due to major bleeding. Under multivariate analysis, significant factors for VKA-related overcoagulation were as follows: previous medical history of VKA therapy-related hemorrhage (P=0.00001) and INR levels over therapeutic range (P=0.0006), chronic liver disease (P=0.03), therapy with amiodarone (P=0.009); in contrast, statin therapy was found to be a protective factor of VKA overcoagulation (P=0.008).", 
    "145": "The knowledge of predictive factors of VKA-related overcoagulation seems of utmost importance to improve patients' management. Our study underlines the fact that the potential of drug interaction should be taken into account when choosing amiodarone for patients receiving VKAs. Interestingly, long-term (>6 month) statin therapy may be a protective factor of VKA overcoagulation. Our findings, therefore, suggest that there may be no need to switch long-term users of VKA and statin to a safer alternative therapy.", 
    "146": "The Arab Middle East is a unique region of the developing world where little is known about the outcomes of patients hospitalized with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), despite playing an important role in the global burden of cardiovascular disease. The primary objectives of this observational study were to compare patients with ACS hospitalized in the Arab Middle East to patients enrolled in a multinational non-Arabian ACS registry. The study cohort consisted of patients hospitalized in 2007 with an ACS including 4,445 from the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) and 6,706 from the Gulf Registry of Acute Coronary Events (Gulf RACE). Average age of patients in Gulf RACE was nearly a decade younger than that in GRACE (56 vs 66 years). Patients in Gulf RACE were more likely to be men, diabetic, and smoke and less likely to be hypertensive compared to patients in GRACE. Patients in Gulf RACE had higher odds of receiving aspirin and a lower likelihood of receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, \u03b2 blockers, and clopidogrel during their index hospitalization. Although most eligible patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction in Gulf RACE received thrombolytics, most of their counterparts in GRACE underwent a primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Multivariable adjusted in-hospital case-fatality rates were not significantly different between patients in Gulf RACE and those in GRACE. In conclusion, despite differences in patient characteristics and treatment practices, short-term mortality rates were comparable in patients with ACS enrolled in these 2 registries. Future studies should explore the effects of these differences on long-term prognosis and other pertinent patient outcomes.", 
    "147": "Oral bioavailability of atorvastatin calcium (ATC) is very low (only 14%) due to instability and incomplete intestinal absorption and/or extensive gut wall extraction. When ATC is packed in the form of tablets, powders, etc., it gets destabilized as it is exposed to the oxidative environment, which is usually present during the production process, the storage of the substance, and the pharmaceutical formulation. Therefore, stabilized gastro-retentive floating tablets of ATC were prepared to enhance bioavailability. Water sorption and viscosity measurement studies are performed to get the best polymer matrix for gastro-retention. A 3(2) factorial design used to prepare optimized formulation of ATC. The selected excipients such as docusate sodium enhanced the stability and solubility of ATC in gastric media and tablet dosage form. The best formulation (F4) consisting of hypromellose, sodium bicarbonate, polyethylene oxide, docusate sodium, mannitol, crosscarmellose sodium, and magnesium stearate, gave floating lag time of 56\u2009\u00b1\u20094.16 s and good matrix integrity with in vitro dissolution of 98.2% in 12 h. After stability studies, no significant change was observed in stability, solubility, floating lag time, total floating duration, matrix integrity, and sustained drug release rates, as confirmed by DSC and powder X-ray diffraction studies. In vivo pharmacokinetic study performed in rabbits revealed enhanced bioavailability of F4 floating tablets, about 1.6 times compared with that of the conventional tablet (Storvas\u00ae 80 mg tablet). These results suggest that the gastric resident formulation is a promising approach for the oral delivery of ATC for improving bioavailability.", 
    "148": "The aim of study was to evaluate the effect of commonly used lisinopril, rosuvastatin and their combined action on site-specific nephrotoxicity in rats using clusterin and microalbumin nephrotoxic biomarkers and other related parameters using oral gavage. Rosuvastatin at 2 different doses showed increase in urinary microalbumin levels whereas lisinopril and its combination with rosuvastatin at 2 different doses did not show urinary microalbumin excretion indicating beneficial effects of lisinopril in terms of reducing microalbumin. Urinary clusterin levels significantly increased in high-dose treated animals of lisinopril and rosuvastatin. The use of lisinopril plus rosuvastatin at low dose also led to worsened renal function by raising urinary clusterin levels (217 \u00b1 4.6 ng/ml) when compared with the control (143 \u00b1 3.3 ng/ml). Renal histopathology showed multifocal regeneration of tubules indicating proximal tubule damaged. These results indicate that lisinopril (50 mg/kg), rosuvastatin (100 mg/kg), lisinopril+rosuvastatin (20+40 mg/kg) and lisinopril+rosuvastatin (50+100 mg/kg) showed toxicity only on proximal tubules.",

    "153": "Obesity is the most common cause of secondary hyperlipidemia. Atherogenic dyslipidemia refers to elevated triglycerides, low HDL-cholesterol and small dense LDL associated with visceral obesity and metabolic syndrome. Obesity may also be associated with isolated low HDL-cholesterol or high triglycerides and postprandial hyperlipidemia. While some obese patients have high LDL cholesterol concentrations, obesity has a more pronounced effect on other atherogenic lipids and lipoproteins. Obesity may aggravate familial lipid disorders. Lipid disorders in obesity are responsive to weight loss, pharmacotherapy and weight loss surgery. Statins are the lipid-lowering drug of choice, together with lifestyle change. Hard clinical end point data to support combinations of statins with other drugs is lacking. After weight loss surgery, the absolute risk of cardiovascular disease should be reassessed, but tools to facilitate risk assessment need to be developed.", 
    "154": "Recent epidemiology attests that hypertriglyceridemia may be a causal risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The specific atherogenicity of hypertriglyceridemia relates to the accumulation in plasma of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein remnants. Hypertriglyceridemia also drives a 'global' atherogenic dyslipidemic profile, which is frequent in high-risk cardiovascular patients, such as Type 2 diabetics. Elevated triglyceride in fasting or nonfasting blood samples should be a trigger for assessing atherogenic components of the lipid profile, particularly HDL-cholesterol, non-HDL-cholesterol and apoB. Residual risk of CVD remains high in statin-treated diabetic patients owing to persistent atherogenic dyslipidemia, which is not fully corrected by these agents nor by the addition of ezetimibe. Hypertriglyceridemia may then be targeted with niacin, fibrates or n-3 fatty acids, after correcting aggravating factors, especially obesity and hyperglycemia. Fibrates consistently decrease coronary events in dyslipidemic patients in outcome studies. New evidence supports adding fenofibrate to a statin in Type 2 diabetics with residual hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL-cholesterol; extrapolating from a recent meta-analysis, a 15% reduction in triglycerides could translate into a further 15% reduction in coronary events. Ongoing clinical trials may provide new evidence for adding niacin to a statin. The value of higher doses of n-3 fatty acids in reducing CVD risk remains to be demonstrated. The high triglyceride/low HDL nexus is an under-recognized risk factor for CVD that merits more detailed clinical assessment and treatment, particularly in patients with Type 2 diabetes already receiving a statin.",

    "174": "In this article, we compare two strategies for atherosclerosis treatment: drugs and healthy lifestyle. Statins are the principal drugs used for the treatment of atherosclerosis. Several secondary prevention studies have demonstrated that statins can significantly reduce cardiovascular events including coronary death, the need for surgical revascularization, stroke, total mortality, as well as fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction. These results were observed in both men and women, the elderly, smokers and non-smokers, diabetics and hypertensives. Primary prevention studies yielded similar results, although total mortality was not affected. Statins also induce atheroma regression and do not cause cancer. However, many unresolved issues remain, such as partial risk reduction, costs, several potential side effects, and long-term use by young patients. Statins act mainly as lipid-lowering drugs but pleiotropic actions are also present. Healthy lifestyle, on the other hand, is effective and inexpensive and has no harmful effects. Five items are associated with lower cardiac risk: non-smoking, BMI \u226425, regular exercise (30 min/day), healthy diet (fruits, vegetables, low-saturated fat, and 5-30 g alcohol/day). Nevertheless, there are difficulties in implementing these measures both at the individual and population levels. Changes in behavior require multidisciplinary care, including medical, nutritional, and psychological counseling. Participation of the entire society is required for such implementation, i.e., universities, schools, media, government, and medical societies. Although these efforts represent a major challenge, such a task must be faced in order to halt the atherosclerosis epidemic that threatens the world.",

However, the side effects of statins on immunity, and particularly on DC immunobiology, have not been analyzed in-depth. Here, we have investigated the impact of lovastatin treatment during monocyte differentiation into DCs on the responsiveness of the resulting monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) to TLR-mediated activation. Lovastatin positively regulated TLR4 signaling in LPS-stimulated moDCs, leading to strong activation of p38 MAP-kinase paralleled by increased proinflammatory cytokine and IFN-\u03b2 production. In contrast, lovastatin promoted negative regulation of IFN-\u03b2-mediated autocrine signaling through the IFN-\u03b1\u03b2 receptor, paralleled by low expression of the transcription factor IRF-1, leading to the inhibition of the enzymes iNOS and HO-1. Defective activation of iNOS/HO-1 resulted in limited cytoprotective capacity against ROS and reduced microbicidal potential. These data were validated using an in vivo model of Listeria monocytogenes infection, which revealed that iNOS activation by splenic inflammatory moDCs, specialized in NO and TNF-\u03b1 production, was strongly reduced in lovastatin-treated, Listeria-infected mice. Statin treatment could have severe implications in immunity against pathogens due to defective iNOS/HO-1 metabolism activation in inflammatory moDCs that might lead to immune failure.",

    "192": "Peritoneal carcinomatosis describes cancer metastasis onto the surface of the peritoneum. It is frequently caused by ovarian and colorectal cancer. Once a tumor has penetrated the peritoneum, cancer cells disseminate into the abdominal cavity. Additionally, surgery can account for the spread of free tumor cells. Their subsequent adhesion to mesothelial cells (HMCs) initiates peritoneal carcinomatosis. Therefore, this study analyzed the effect of simvastatin on tumor cell adherence. HMCs were isolated from human greater omentum. Fluorescence-labeled tumor cells (SKOV-3, OvCar-29, OAW42, FraW\u00fc; ovarian/HT29; colorectal) were incubated on confluent mesothelial monolayers with 10 \u00b5M simvastatin for 48 h. Adhesion was quantified using a fluorescence reader. Expression of the adhesion molecules VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and \u03b21 integrin chain under the influence of simvastatin 0.1-100 \u00b5M for 24-72\u00a0h was analyzed using flow cytometry. Simvastatin significantly reduced the adhesion of all ovarian cancer cells and HT29 to HMCs (P\u22640.001). Concomitantly simvastatin decreased the expression of VCAM-1 on HMCs. ICAM-1 and \u03b21 integrin chain expression on ovarian cancer cells was also clearly reduced. By contrast, the expression of the analyzed adhesion molecules on HT29 cells remained unchanged. Simvastatin clearly inhibits tumor cell adhesion to HMCs. In the case of ovarian cancer cell lines it appears to be mediated by decreased expression of both VCAM-1 on HMCs and the integrin \u03b14\u03b21 on tumor cells. As an example of adhesion molecule down-regulating drugs, simvastatin may provide a novel therapeutic approach to the prevention of peritoneal carcinomatosis.",

ASCOT-LLA was stopped prematurely after a median 3.3-year follow-up because of a 36% relative risk reduction (RRR) in non-fatal myocardial infarction and fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) (the primary outcome) in favour of atorvastatin and a non-significant reduction in CV deaths (16%) and all-cause mortality (13%). After a further 2.2 years at the end of ASCOT-BPLA, despite extensive crossovers from and to statin usage, the RRR in all endpoints remained essentially unchanged.

In rAP patients, coronary angiography revealed that statins suppressed restenosis but not new lesions.", 
    "213": "For Japanese CAD patients treated with PCI and stent implantation, statin therapy reduced the incidence of recurrent cardiovascular events, particularly rAP. Discretionary statin treatment to achieve LDL-C levels <100 mg/dl effectively reduced restenosis causing rAP.", 
    "214": "Bioassay guided fractionation of the ethanolic extract of Polyalthia longifolia var. pendula, led to the discovery of the clerodane diterpene, 16\u03b1-hydroxycleroda-3, 13 (14) Z-dien-15, 16-olide (1), as a new structural class of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. Importantly, the in vivo effects of 1 corroborated well with its molecular docking analysis and also with its hamster plasma pharmacokinetics.", 
    "215": "The role of autophagy, a process in which the cell self-digests its own components, was investigated in glioma cell death induced by the hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase-inhibiting drug simvastatin. Induction of autophagy and activation of autophagy-regulating signalling pathways were analyzed by immunoblotting. Flow cytometry/fluorescent microscopy was used to assess autophagy-associated intracellular acidification and apoptotic markers (phosphatidylserine exposure, DNA fragmentation and caspase activation). Cell viability was determined by crystal violet, MTT or LDH release assay. Simvastatin treatment of U251 and C6 glioma cell lines caused the appearance of autophagolysosome-like intracytoplasmic acidic vesicles. The induction of autophagy in U251 cells was confirmed by the upregulation of autophagosome-associated LC3-II and pro-autophagic beclin-1, as well as by the downregulation of the selective autophagic target p62. Simvastatin induced the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its target Raptor, while simultaneously downregulating activation of Akt. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a major AMPK/Akt downstream target and a major negative autophagy regulator, and its substrate p70 S6 kinase 1 were also inhibited by simvastatin. Mevalonate, the product of HMG-CoA reductase enzymatic activity, AMPK siRNA or pharmacological inactivation of AMPK with compound C suppressed, while the inhibitors of Akt (10-DEBC hydrochloride) and mTOR (rapamycin) mimicked autophagy induction by simvastatin. Inhibition of autophagy with bafilomycin A1, 3-methyladenine and LC3\u03b2 shRNA, as well as AMPK inhibition with compound C or AMPK siRNA, markedly increased apoptotic death of simvastatin-treated U251 cells. These data suggest that inhibition of AMPK-dependent autophagic response might sensitize glioma cells to statin-induced apoptotic death.", 
    "216": "Atorvastatin is a statin that inhibits the 3-hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. Several landmark clinical trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of statin therapy for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. It is assumed that the beneficial effects of statin therapy are entirely due to cholesterol reduction. Statins have an additional activity (pleiotropic effect) that has been associated to their anti-inflammatory effects. The aim of the present study was to assess the antinociceptive activity of atorvastatin in five animal pain models. The daily administration of 3-100mg/kg of atorvastatin by oral gavage induced a significant dose-dependent antinociception in the writhing, tail-flick, orofacial formalin and formalin hind paw tests. However, this antinociceptive activity of atorvastatin was detectable only at high concentrations in the hot plate assay. The data obtained in the present study demonstrates the effect of atorvastatin to reduce nociception and inflammation in different animal pain models.", 
    "217": "We investigated whether KIF6 Trp719Arg genotypes affect cardiovascular outcomes and efficacy of statin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus undergoing hemodialysis.", 
    "218": "We conducted a post hoc analysis of the 4D-study, a randomized trial including 1255 patients. Patients were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with either 20mg of atorvastatin (n = 619) or placebo (n = 636) once daily and followed for 4 years (median). DNA was available for 1232 patients and we assessed KIF6 Trp719Arg genotypes by PCR and subsequent restriction digest. Carriers of the Arg719 allele showed no increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease. The incidence of cardiac death, MI, and stroke did not differ across KIF6 genotypes, irrespective of whether the patients were treated with atorvastatin or not.", 
    "219": "In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus on hemodialysis, KIF6 Trp719Arg genotypes were not associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes during follow-up or with the efficacy of atorvastatin therapy.", 
    "220": "In 2004 the British Cardiac Society redefined myocardial infarction by cardiac troponin I (cTnI) concentration: \u2264 0.06 \u03bcg/L (unstable angina), >0.06 to < 0.5 \u03bcg/L (myocardial necrosis), and \u2265 0.5 \u03bcg/L (myocardial infarction). We investigated the effects of this classification on all-cause mortality in 1,285 patients from the Evaluation of the Methods and Management of Acute Coronary Events (EMMACE)-2 registry. There were 528 deaths (6.6-year all-cause mortality 41.1%). Survival was greatest in the cTnI \u2264 0.06-\u03bcg/L subgroup at 30 days (p = 0.005), 6 months (p = 0.015), 1 year (p = 0.002), and 6.6 years (p = 0.045). After adjustment there was no significant difference in survival between the cTnI >0.06- to < 0.5-\u03bcg/L and \u2265 0.5-\u03bcg/L subgroups. Increased mortality (hazard ratio, 95% confidence interval) was associated with ages 70 to 80 years (2.58, 1.17 to 3.91) and >80 years (3.30, 3.50 to 5.06), peripheral vascular disease (1.50, 1.16 to 1.94), heart failure (1.36, 1.05 to 1.83), diabetes mellitus (1.68, 1.36 to 2.07), severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (1.50, 1.00 to 2.21), and creatinine per 10 \u03bcmol/L (1.65, 1.02 to 1.08), whereas ages 50 to 60 years (0.55, 0.32 to 0.96), \u03b2 blockers (0.53, 0.44 to 0.64), aspirin (0.80 0.65 to 0.99), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (0.67, 0.56 to 0.80), statins (0.73, 0.59 to 0.90), and revascularization (0.33, 0.12 to 0.92) were associated with a lower risk of death. In conclusion, although quantitative evaluation of cTnI concentration in patients with acute coronary syndrome with cTnI > 0.06 \u03bcg/L was associated with no added prognostic information, the dichotomization of patients by cTnI status (\"positive\" and \"negative\") facilitates acute coronary syndrome risk stratification.", 
    "221": "This is a case report of adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), the adult variant of adrenoleukodystryphy (ALD). The diagnoses in the patient, aged 34, was confirmed via increased serum very long chain fatty acid concentration (VLCFA). Treatment started with the cholesterol lowering drug, atorvastatin, followed by add-on therapy with Lorenzo's oil (LO) and finally supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the AMN patient before DHA treatment, already showed abnormal white matter in the brain. Although the MRI showed no neurological improvement after 6 months of DHA treatment, no selective progression of demyelination was detected in the AMN patient. Contrary to what was expected, LO failed to sustain or normalize the VLCFA levels or improve clinical symptoms. It was however, shown that DHA supplementation in addition to LO, increased DHA levels in both plasma and red blood cells (RBC). Additionally, the study showed evidence that the elongase activity in the elongation of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) to docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) might have been significantly compromised, due to the increased DHA levels.", 
    "222": "Because of the potential for serious adverse effects, patients treated with amiodarone must be carefully screened and routinely monitored for potential liver, thyroid, and pulmonary toxicity. However, laboratory and pulmonary monitoring rates have been found to be substantially lower than recommended in guidelines, including those of the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology (NASPE, 2007).", 
    "223": "To (a) assess rates of laboratory monitoring of liver, thyroid, and pulmonary function and adverse events in a pharmacist-managed amiodarone monitoring program compared with usual care in an integrated health care system and (b) estimate return on investment (ROI) from this intervention.", 
    "224": "This retrospective cohort study used clinic and enrollment data to identify those patients in the pharmacist-managed program and usual care who received at least 100 days of amiodarone therapy with the first prescription for amiodarone (index) from June 1, 2007, through May 31, 2009 (index date). Laboratory test monitoring was recorded at baseline (up to 6 months before the index date), from 1-6 months after the index date, 7-12 months after the index date, and at any time during the year (months 1-12). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was evaluated for liver function. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and, for patients with abnormal TSH ( less than 0.4 micro international units [uIU] per mL or greater than 4.0 uIU per mL), free thyroxine (T4) were evaluated for thyroid function. Rates of pulmonary function testing (PFT) were measured by the diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide tests (DLCO) and annual chest x-rays (CXR); electrocardiograms were not counted. Monitoring rates were compared using Pearson chi-square tests, and logistic regression was used to compare the odds of testing (ALT, TSH, T4, CXR, PFT) between the 2 groups at any time during the year after the index date. Concomitant uses of amiodarone with high-dose statins and of amiodarone with digoxin were compared using Pearson chi-square tests. Hospitalizations and emergency room (ER) visits during the 12-month follow-up period were counted for (a) interstitial lung disease; (b) rhabdomyolysis for patients who received amiodarone with high-dose statins (either lovastatin greater than 40 mg per day or greater than 20 mg per day of simvastatin or atorvastatin); and (c) for patients with abnormal digoxin, ALT, TSH, or T4 levels, if the hospitalization occurred within 2 days of the abnormal laboratory value.", 
    "225": "There were 2,292 patients who received at least 100 days of amiodarone therapy and met the other inclusion criteria, of whom 181 patients (7.9%) were in the pharmacist-managed group and 2,111 received usual care. There were 90 (49.7%) new amiodarone users in the pharmacist-managed group and 990 (46.9%) in usual care. The 2 groups had similar demographic characteristics except race, with more whites and fewer African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics in usual care. Laboratory monitoring rates for ALT, TSH, and T4 were significantly higher in the pharmacist-managed group than usual care at the first and second 6 months and at baseline for ALT and TSH but not T4. Baseline CXR rates were significantly higher for the pharmacist-managed group than usual care (59.1% vs. 49.3%; P=0.011). Few patients in either group received PFT tests at baseline, 6.6% versus 3.6% (P=0.042). After controlling for covariates (age, gender, race, new vs. continuing use, and comorbidities), pharmacist-managed patients were significantly more likely to have at least 1 ALT test within the year after the index prescription (odds ratio [OR]=3.13, 95% CI=1.12-8.71), as well as a TSH test (OR=8.13, 95% CI=3.27-20.21) and T4 (OR=2.51, 95% CI=1.67-3.75). PFTs were also more likely to be given to these patients (OR=5.89, 95% CI=3.86-8.99). A higher percentage of patients in the pharmacist-managed group than in usual care were taking a high-dose statin during the 12-month follow-up period (47.5% vs. 36.2%, P=0.003), but of those patients, a greater proportion were switched to another statin (14.0% [n=12] vs. 7.5% [n=57], P=0.037) or a lower dose (9.3% [n=8] vs. 3.9% [n=30], P=0.022). Six patients in the usual care group (0.79% of patients on high-dose statins) developed rhabdomyolysis, and 5 (0.24% of all patients in usual care) had an admission for interstitial lung disease. The proportions of patients using amiodarone and digoxin concomitantly were similar in the 2 groups (35.9% vs. 31.3%, P=0.197). Among patients with abnormal laboratory results for ALT, TSH, and T4, or digoxin, there were 2 all-cause hospitalizations and 1 ER visit in the pharmacist-managed group and 34 all-cause hospitalizations and 18 ER visits in the usual care group during the follow-up year. Assuming that all hospitalizations and ER visits incurred in the usual care group were avoid- able, approximately $2.14 could be saved for every dollar spent on the pharmacist-managed amiodarone monitoring program.",

The Lp-PLA(2) Studies Collaboration showed the relationship between Lp-PLA(2) levels and activity with coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke. Levels and activity of Lp-PLA(2) are reduced by statins. There have been limited studies focused on dietary factors and effects on LpPLA(2). A recent article from the Nurses' Health Study (HNS) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) has provided interesting insights. In this cross sectional study, a lower LpPLA(2) activity was found to be related to several dietary factors including higher percentage of energy consumed as protein instead of carbohydrate, mild to moderate intake of alcohol, higher mono-unsaturated fat intake instead of carbohydrate, and not being overweight. It is unknown whether changes in Lp-PLA(2) by diet alter cardiovascular risk.",
