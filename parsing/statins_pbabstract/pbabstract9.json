The evolution of drug development and randomized clinical trials in cardiovascular medicine has resulted in the conclusion that lower cholesterol concentrations result in greater benefit. However, how aggressive one should be in lowering cholesterol levels and to what level has not been definitively established. In this brief review I aim to defend the hypothesis that lower is better on the basis of the evidence to date. This will include indirect evidence from randomized clinical trials with statins and novel lipid-modifying drugs. In addition, there is a wealth of epidemiology and Mendelian randomization genetic data to support this. Also, on-treatment low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations show a robust relationship with cardiovascular disease events. Finally, most national guidelines groups around the world continue to advocate for a treat to target philosophy. As such, the prevailing philosophy is that lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to very low levels is our best preventative strategy particularly for those at the highest risk. We eagerly await the results of ongoing clinical trials that will more firmly establish if this concept will ultimately be proven correct.",

The risk of delayed hypercalcemia during the recovery of renal function is not well appreciated as this varies in severity and can be caused by multiple mechanisms. We present a patient with high dose simvastatin induced rhabdomyolysis leading to late onset of severe hypercalcemia due to calcium phosphate deposition in muscles diagnosed by distinctive bone scintigraphy. A 60-year-old Asian male was admitted to the hospital for profound weakness one week following the initiation of simvastatin 80 mg daily post myocardial infarction. His clinical course was complicated by contrast nephropathy. One week later, he developed progressive weakness in all his extremities and inability to raise his head and eat. Simvastatin was discontinued at this point. CPK elevation to greater than 425,000 U was found, consistent with rhabdomyolysis. He became oliguric requiring hemodialysis. Muscle biopsy showed severe muscle necrosis and type 2 fiber atrophy. One month later, he developed hypercalcemia with suppressed intact PTH and 1, 25(OH) D levels. Whole body bone scintigraphy showed calcium phosphate deposition throughout his musculature. His calcium levels normalized in 1 week on hemodialysis. This patient's experience illustrates the marked risk of delayed severe hypercalcemia from rhabdomyolysis due to dissolution of myocellular calcium phosphate deposits. It also provides an opportunity to review the different mechanisms of hypercalcemia especially in statin induced rhabdomyolysis.

    "48": "Statins are effective drugs to reduce cardiovascular events secondary to dyslipidemia; however, they cause frequent undesirable side effects. The incidence of statin-induced myotoxicity (SIM) is presented by 7 to 29% of patients, depending upon the report. SIM may develop in presence of abnormally high concentrations of statins in the myocyte and/or in presence of muscular conditions that may predispose to SIM. High concentrations of statins in the myocyte may occur whenever the activity of liver influx membrane transporters, namely OATP1B1, of drug metabolizing enzymes, and of liver and muscular efflux transporters, MDR1 and BCRP, is reduced. In the muscle, conditions that may predispose to SIM include mitochondrial damage with disruption of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and decreased production of ATP, increase of ROS, and leak of cytochrome c and Ca(2+). In the sarcoplasma, statins activate MAPK and diminish the RhoA/AKT/mTOR/PGC-1\u03b1 pathway. All these effects contribute to activate apoptosis, proteolysis, and muscle remodeling. Moreover, in the sarcoplasma, statins can reduce the resting chloride channel conductance, as well as lactate efflux. These changes will be responsible of fatigue, cramps, myalgia and elevation of serum CK. To date, besides avoiding drug-drug interactions and alcohol consumption, and correcting hypothyroidism, two strategies could be useful to prevent/diminish SIM, e.g. gradual dose titration with statins less prone to produce SIM, and high supplements of vitamin D in subjects with low plasma concentrations of 25(OH) D3.", 
    "49": "L-thyroxine (LT4) treatment of hypothyroidism, particularly in patients with thyroid- stimulating hormone (TSH) >10mU/L, results in improved lipid profile, as LT4 stimulates low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) degradation and the conversion of cholesterol in bile acids by inducing LDL-receptor and 7 alpha hydroxylase expression, respectively. Statins decrease total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C mainly by suppressing 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A activity. Therefore, the addition of statins to LT4 treatment, following the reversal of hypothyroidism, acts synergistically and forms a powerful treatment modality in patients with this condition whose serum lipids have not achieved the target. Statin add-on therapies, such as ezetimibe (EZE) and the recently approved proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, in conjunction with LT4 therapy, produce an even more favorable profile. Ezetimibe blocks the intestinal absorption of cholesterol, while in patients with heterozygous familiar hyperlipidemia, PCSK9 inhibitors suppress PCSK9, thereby promoting LDL-C degradation. The synergy of these drugs results in a far better lipidemic profile than when each drug is administered alone, with LT4 treatment clearly enhancing, in many respects, the efficacy of therapy.",

The histopathological examination of rat bladder revealed the presence of tumors and the absence of apoptotic bodies in sections from N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine group, while tumors were absent and apoptotic bodies were clearly observed in sections from rat groups treated with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, atorvastatin, or both drugs. The study of the molecular mechanisms illustrated downregulation of COX-2 and P53 (mutant) genes and suppression of transforming growth factor beta-1 and the lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde in serum of rats of the three treated groups. This chemopreventive effect was confirmed by and associated with lower level of bladder tumor antigen in urine. However, the combined treatment with both drugs exhibited the major protective effect and nearly corrected the dyslipidemia that has been induced by N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine.

AE characteristics, experience with (their own) physicians, and impact of AE was ascertained. We inquired whether or how their experience altered their own attitude toward statins or statin AEs. Patient A: Atorvastatin 40 then 80\u00a0mg was followed by cognitive problems, neuropathy, and glucose intolerance in a Radiologist in his 50s (Naranjo criteria:\u00a0probable causality). Patient B: Atorvastatin 10\u00a0mg was followed\u00a0in 2 months by muscle weakness and myalgia in an Internist in his 40s (probable causality). Patient C: Atorvastatin, ezetimibe/simvastatin, rosuvastatin at varying doses was followed shortly after by irritability, myalgia, and fatigue in a Cardiac Surgeon in his 40s (probable causality). Patient D: Simvastatin 20 then 40\u00a0mg was followed in 4\u00a0years by mitochondriopathy, myopathy, neuropathy,\u00a0and exercise intolerance in an Emergency Medicine physician in his 50s (definite causality). Patient E: Simvastatin 20\u00a0mg and niacin 1000\u00a0mg was followed in one month by muscle weakness and myalgia in a Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation physician in his 50s (probable causality). Patient F: Lovastatin 20\u00a0mg then simvastatin 20\u00a0mg, atorvastatin 20\u00a0mg, rosuvastatin 5\u00a0mg, niacin 20\u00a0mg and ezetimbe 10\u00a0mg was followed by muscle weakness and myalgia in an Obstetrician/Gynecologist in his 70s (definite causality). Patient G: Ezetimibe/simvastatin and atorvastatin (dose unavailable) was followed shortly after by cognitive problems in a Radiologist in her 80s (probable causality). Thus AEs affected multiple quality-of-life relevant domains, often in combination, encompassing muscle (N\u00a0=\u00a05), fatigue (N\u00a0=\u00a02), peripheral neuropathy (N\u00a0=\u00a02), cognitive (N\u00a0=\u00a02), dysglycemia (N\u00a0=\u00a01) and behavioral manifestations (N\u00a0=\u00a01). In five, the AEs affected the physician professionally. Five physicians experienced dismissive attitudes in some of their own healthcare encounters. One noted that his experience helped not only his own attention to statin AEs, but that of other physicians in his community. Several stated that their experience altered their understanding of and/or attitude toward statin AEs, and/or their view of settings in which statin use is warranted. Statin AEs can have profound impact in high functioning professionals with implications to the individual, their professional life, and those whom they serve professionally.",

When untreated in childhood, familial hypercholesterolemia is associated with a premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in adulthood. According to the results of clinical studies in children with familial hypercholesterolemia conducted in the last two decades, as well as statements of American Heart Association (AHA), American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and Polish Statement called Stanowisko Ekspert\u00f3w Lipidowych, the recommendations of treatment were published. In children with familial hypercholesterolemia aged 8 years and more statins are one of the first-line medications, thanks to their hypolipemic and pleiotropic activities and well established position in treatment of adult patients with hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular disease prevention. This paper provides data on pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of statins, as well as overview of clinical studies in children with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, regarding efficacy and safety of statins. The studies have revealed significant lowering of LDL cholesterol level (20-50%) and total cholesterol level (20-30%) by statins used in the lowest recommended dose (compared to placebo) in children aged 8 years and more, in a period from 8 weeks to 24 months. In addition to the fact that statin treatment is efficacious, the safety was also confirmed by the meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials in children. The results showed that statin therapy did not impair growth and sexual development in children. The adverse effects were generally mild and did not differ as compared to placebo. However, it should be emphasized that efficacy and safety assessment of statins is limited to 24 months only. Large long-term clinical studies are needed to establish the long-term safety issues of statins in children.",

ECG showed that the decline of cardiac functions including the elevated left ventricular systolic/diastolic internal dimension (LVIDs/d) and fractional shortening (FS) in mice with cold exposure was also inhibited by Atv treatment. Transmission electronic microscopy uncovered that Atv attenuated mitochondrial injury induced by cold exposure in mice. In addition, systolic blood pressure was gradually increased in mice exposed to cold temperature, and Atv treatment significantly inhibited the elevation of blood pressure in cold-treated mice. Mechanistically, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal was not altered in mice exposed to cold, and Atv did not affect MAPK signal in cold-treated mice.

This study aimed to compare the effects of tocotrienol and lovastatin co-supplementation with individual treatments on bone dynamic histomorphometric indices and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) gene expression in ovariectomized rats. Forty-eight female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized equally into six groups. The baseline was sacrificed upon receipt. All other groups were ovariectomized, except for the sham group. The ovariectomized groups were administered orally daily with (1) lovastatin 11 mg/kg/day alone; (2) tocotrienol derived from annatto bean (annatto tocotrienol) 60 mg/kg/day alone; (3) lovastatin 11 mg/kg/day, and annatto tocotrienol 60 mg/kg/day. The sham and ovariectomized control groups were treated with equal volume of vehicle. After eight weeks of treatment, the rats were sacrificed. Their bones were harvested for bone dynamic histomorphometry and BMP-2 gene expression. Rats supplemented with annatto tocotrienol and lovastatin concurrently demonstrated significantly lower single-labeled surface, but increased double-labeled surface, mineralizing surface, mineral apposition rate and bone formation rate compared to individual treatments (p < 0.05). There was a parallel increase in BMP-2 gene expression in the rats receiving combined treatment (p < 0.05). The combination of annatto tocotrienol and lovastatin exerted either additively or synergistically on selected bone parameters. In conclusion, tocotrienol can augment the bone formation and mineralization in rats receiving low-dose statins. Supplementation of tocotrienol in statin users can potentially protect them from osteoporosis.", 
    "78": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rated as the fifth most common malignancy and third in cancer-related deaths worldwide. Statins, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, are potent cholesterol-lowering drugs, and recent epidemiologic evidence suggests that statins prevent aggressive HCC development. Previous experiments revealed that statins downregulate phosphorylated Akt (pAkt). Here, it is demonstrated that atorvastatin decreases nuclear pAkt levels in pancreatic and lung cancer cell lines within minutes, and this rapid effect is mediated by the purinergic P2X receptors. Akt is upregulated by hepatitis viruses and has oncogenic activity in HCC; therefore, we tested the possibility that the P2X-Akt pathway is important for the anticipated anticancer effects of statins in hepatocytes. Atorvastatin decreased hepatitis B virus X protein- and insulin-induced pAkt and pGsk3\u03b2 (Ser9) levels. Furthermore, Akt-induced lipogenesis was counteracted by atorvastatin, and these statin-induced effects were dependent on P2X receptors. Statin also decreased proliferation and invasiveness of hepatocytes. These data provide mechanistic evidence for a P2X receptor-dependent signaling pathway by which statins decrease pAkt, its downstream phosphorylation target pGsk3\u03b2, and lipogenesis in hepatocytes.Implications: The Akt pathway is deregulated and may act as a driver in HCC development; the P2X-Akt signaling pathway may have a role in anticancer effects of statins.

They inhibit the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-R), an enzyme involved in cholesterol synthesis in higher organisms and in isoprenoid biosynthesis in some bacteria. We hypothesized that statins may influence the microbial community in the gut through either direct inhibition or indirect mechanisms involving alterations to host responses. We therefore examined the impact of rosuvastatin (RSV) on the community structure of the murine gastrointestinal microbiota. RSV was orally administered to mice and the effects on the gut microbiota, host bile acid profiles, and markers of inflammation were analyzed. RSV significantly influenced the microbial community in both the cecum and feces, causing a significant decrease in \u03b1-diversity in the cecum and resulting in a reduction of several physiologically relevant bacterial groups. RSV treatment of mice significantly affected bile acid metabolism and impacted expression of inflammatory markers known to influence microbial community structure (including RegIII\u03b3 and Camp) in the gut. This study suggests that a commonly used statin (RSV) leads to an altered gut microbial composition in normal mice with attendant impacts on local gene expression profiles, a finding that should prompt further studies to investigate the implications of statins for gut microbiota stability and health in humans.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This work demonstrates that rosuvastatin administration in mice affects the gastrointestinal microbiota, influences bile acid metabolism, and alters transcription of genes encoding factors involved in gut homeostasis and immunity in the gastrointestinal tract.",

They act as competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. This inhibition not only leads to the depletion of cholesterol and its fatty acid esters, but also to the depletion of the intermediates of this metabolic pathway (mainly pyrophosphates), which can play an important role in tumor proliferation. The aim of the current study was to establish a versatile multi-analyte method capable of quantitative determination of various currently-used statins, together with free cholesterol (FC), cholesterol esters (CEs), and some key intermediates of the mevalonate pathway occurring in human serum. Various methods of sample preparation were examined in order to minimize the content of potentially interfering serum proteins, and simultaneously to assure acceptable recovery of the target analytes. Following protein precipitation with 2-propanol, separation of the sample components using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem high resolution mass spectrometry (U-HPLC-HRMS/MS) was performed, employing a hyphenated quadrupole Orbitrap mass analyzer.

Male C57BL/6J wildtype mice were subjected to 6-weeks of voluntary wheel running or normal cage activities with or without simvastatin treatment (20 mg/kg/d, n = 7-8 per group). Adaptations in in vivo fatigue resistance were determined by a treadmill running test, and by ankle plantarflexor contractile assessment. The tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, and plantaris muscles were evaluated for exercised-induced mitochondrial adaptations (i.e., biogenesis, function, autophagy). There was no difference in weekly wheel running distance between control and simvastatin-treated mice (P = 0.51). Trained mice had greater treadmill running distance (296%, P<0.001), and ankle plantarflexor contractile fatigue resistance (9%, P<0.05) compared to sedentary mice, independent of simvastatin treatment. At the cellular level, trained mice had greater mitochondrial biogenesis (e.g., ~2-fold greater PGC1\u03b1 expression, P<0.05) and mitochondrial content (e.g., 25% greater citrate synthase activity, P<0.05), independent of simvastatin treatment. Mitochondrial autophagy-related protein contents were greater in trained mice (e.g., 40% greater Bnip3, P<0.05), independent of simvastatin treatment.

    "97": "Some observational studies raised concern that statins may cause memory impairment, leading to a US Food and Drug Administration warning. Similar questions were raised regarding proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin-type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) and neurocognitive function. No prospectively designed study has evaluated the relationship between long-term PCSK9i use and cognition changes. Patients with prior cardiovascular disease treated with maximally tolerated statin enrolled in FOURIER (the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcome study of the PCSK9i evolocumab) could participate in this prospective assessment of cognitive function (EBBINGHAUS). Key additional exclusion criteria for EBBINGHAUS were dementia, cognitive impairment, or other significant mental or neurological disorder. Cognitive testing was performed using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery, a tablet-based tool assessing executive function, working memory, memory function, and psychomotor speed at baseline, weeks 24 and 48, every 48 weeks thereafter, and study end. The primary endpoint was spatial working memory strategy index of executive function (SWMSI). The primary hypothesis was that evolocumab would be noninferior to placebo in the mean change from baseline over time in SWMSI. Fifteen hundred cognitively normal patients completing the assessments provided approximately 97% power to demonstrate that the upper 95% confidence interval for the treatment difference in mean change from baseline in SWMSI over time is <20% of the SD of the mean change in the placebo group. An exploratory analysis will compare neurocognitive function in patients with post-baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol <25 mg/dL. EBBINGHAUS will evaluate whether the addition of evolocumab to statin therapy affects cognitive function over time in patients with stable cardiovascular disease.", 
    "98": "Different cancer chemopreventive agents may act synergistically and their combination may produce enhanced protective effects against carcinogenesis than each individual agent alone. Herein, we investigated the chemopreventive effects of nobiletin (NBT, a citrus polymethoxyflavone) and atorvastatin (ATST, a lipid-lowering drug) in colon cancer cells/macrophages and an azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colon carcinogenesis rat model. The results demonstrated that co-treatments of NBT/ATST produced enhanced growth inhibitory and anti-inflammatory effects on the colon cancer cells and macrophages, respectively. Isobologram analysis confirmed that these interactions between NBT and ATST were synergistic. NBT/ATST co-treatment also synergistically induced extensive cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in colon cancer cells. Oral administration of NBT (0.1%, w/w in diet) or ATST (0.04%, w/w in diet) significantly decreased colonic tumor incidence and multiplicity in AOM-treated rats. Most importantly, co-treatment of NBT/ATST at their half doses (0.05% NBT + 0.02% ATST, w/w in diet) resulted in even stronger inhibitory effects on colonic tumor incidence and multiplicity than did NBT or ATST alone at higher doses. Statistical analysis confirmed that the enhanced chemopreventive activities against colon carcinogenesis in rats by the NBT/ATST combination were highly synergistic. Our results further demonstrated that NBT/ATST co-treatment profoundly modulated key cellular signaling regulators associated with inflammation, cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, angiogenesis and metastasis in the colon of AOM-treated rats. In conclusion, for the first time, our results demonstrated a strong synergy in inhibiting colon carcinogenesis produced by the co-treatment of NBT and ATST, which provided a scientific basis for using NBT in combination with ATST for colon cancer chemoprevention in humans.",

    "100": "COMBO II was a 104-week, double-blind study (n\u2009=\u2009720) enrolling patients with documented atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and baseline LDL-C \u226570\u2009mg/dL (1.8\u2009mmol/L), and patients without documented ASCVD at high cardiovascular risk with LDL-C \u2265100\u2009mg/dL (2.6\u2009mmol/L). Patients receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy were randomized (2:1) to alirocumab 75\u2009mg every 2\u2009weeks (Q2W; 1\u2009mL subcutaneous injection) or oral ezetimibe 10\u2009mg daily. Alirocumab dose was increased to 150\u2009mg Q2W (also 1\u2009mL) at Week 12 if Week 8 LDL-C was \u226570\u2009mg/dL.",

At Week 24, alirocumab consistently reduced LDL-C from baseline in patients with (-49.1%) or without DM (-51.2%) to a significantly greater extent than ezetimibe (-18.4% and -21.8%, respectively). Occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar between groups. Efficacy results at 104\u2009weeks were similar to those at 24\u2009weeks.", 
    "102": "Over a 104-week double-blind study period, alirocumab provided consistently greater LDL-C reductions than ezetimibe, with similar LDL-C results in patients with or without DM. Safety of alirocumab was similar regardless of baseline DM status.", 
    "103": "Cellular cholesterol levels are intricately controlled to maintain homeostasis. Here, we describe ways in which cellular cholesterol status can be manipulated for the study of cholesterol homeostasis, including sterol starvation (by culturing cells in lipoprotein-deficient serum and pretreating/treating with the cholesterol-lowering drug, statin) and sterol enrichment (using cholesterol complexed to cyclodextrin, and low-density lipoprotein). We also describe how to prepare lipoprotein-deficient serum and complex cholesterol to cyclodextrin.", 
    "104": "Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type\u00a09 (PCSK9) impedes low\u2011density lipoprotein\u00a0(LDL) receptor (LDLR)-mediated LDL-cholesterol uptake and has hence emerged as a critical regulator of serum cholesterol levels and a new therapeutic target for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Statins have been shown to elevate circulating PCSK9 levels by stimulating PCSK9 gene transcription, which reduces the clinical efficacy of statin in LDL\u2011cholesterol reduction. The transcription of PCSK9 is partially controlled by the hepatocyte nuclear factor\u00a01\u00a0(HNF1) binding site embedded in the proximal region of its promoter. In this study, we utilized adenoviral shRNA delivery vectors to generate liver-specific knockdown of HNF1\u03b1 (Ad\u2011shHNF1\u03b1) or HNF1\u03b2\u00a0(Ad\u2011shHNF1\u03b2) in hamsters to examine the impact of reduced hepatic expression of HNF1 transcription factors on statin\u2011induced elevation of PCSK9 expression and serum cholesterol levels. We showed that the administration of rosuvastatin\u00a0(RSV) to normolipidemic hamsters significantly augmented hepatic PCSK9 expression and serum PCSK9 levels. In addition, RSV treatment increased hepatic HNF1\u03b1 protein levels without a clear effect on HNF1\u03b1 mRNA expression. Injection of Ad-shHNF1\u03b1 or Ad\u2011shHNF1\u03b2 into hamsters both blunted RSV\u2011induced elevation of PCSK9 serum concentration and hepatic mRNA and protein levels, which led to significant increases in liver LDLR protein abundance. Furthermore, hepatic depletion of HNF1 factors lowered circulating total cholesterol and non\u2011high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in RSV\u2011treated hamsters. Our study demonstrates that both HNF1\u03b1 and HNF1\u03b2 are positive regulators of hepatic PCSK9 transcription in hamster species and that transient, liver-specific knockdown of either HNF1\u03b1 or HNF1\u03b2 could antagonize the RSV\u2011induced elevation of serum PCSK9 and reduce circulating cholesterol levels.", 
    "105": "Patients with high total cholesterol have increased risk of cardiovascular disease. National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines recommend cholesterol lowering with statin medications; however, statin adherence remains poor. We hypothesized that patient-centered education on the 10-year risk for each of the major constituents of cardiovascular disease would increase statin adherence and achievement of the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goal.", 
    "106": "Veterans within the Salt Lake City Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center initiating statin therapy from October 2008 to December 2011 were randomized in a pragmatic design to receive either an educational mailer or usual care. The mailer outlined their 10-year global cardiovascular risk, separated into coronary heart disease, stroke, and congestive heart failure. The study was unblinded and followed an intention-to-treat analysis where outcome measures were obtained during normal care process. The primary outcome measure was the achievement of the LDL-C goal during the 12-month follow-up.", 
    "107": "Two hundred and seven patients were randomly assigned to either the intervention arm (95) or the control arm (112). No differences in the proportion of patients meeting the LDL-C goal were detected during 12-months [Relative Risk (RR): 0.95 (95 percent confidence interval (CI): 0.77-1.17)] or 18-months [RR: 1.03 (95 percent CI: 0.84, 1.25)]. Patients in the intervention arm had higher adherence on average, e.g., intervention patients were more likely to have 70 percent or more days of statin therapy compared to patients who received standard care-though this did not reach statistical significance-RR: 1.33 (95 percent CI: 1.00, 1.78). There were no statistical differences in cardiovascular outcomes or mortality.", 
    "108": "Patient education mailers sent to patients starting statin treatment did not have a clear impact on LDL-C goal achievement or adherence to statin therapy.", 
    "109": "The aim of pharmacological lipid modification is to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) as a means of either secondary or primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Statins are the first-line therapy for pharmacological lipid modification. Ezetimibe is a drug which reduces LDL-C by selectively inhibiting intestinal cholesterol absorption. This provides an alternative pharmacological approach to that of statin therapy to reduce LDL-C. Ezetimibe has been shown to significantly reduce levels of LDL-C and recently, as demonstrated in the IMPROVE-IT trial, to reduce the rate of cardiovascular events in high-risk patients. Ezetimibe therefore has an important role in pharmacological lipid modification. In this paper, we examine the body of research behind ezetimibe and assess its current clinical applications in different patient subgroups.", 
    "110": "Statins may offer protective effects in sepsis through anti-inflammatory, mitochondrial protection and other actions. We thus evaluated the effects of simvastatin on survival, organ and mitochondrial function, tissue and plasma ubiquinone levels and liver transcriptomics in a 3-day rat model of sepsis. Comparisons of rat plasma simvastatin and ubiquinone levels were made against levels sampled in blood from patients with acute lung injury (ALI) enrolled into a trial of statin therapy. Animals received simvastatin by gavage either pre- or post-induction of faecal peritonitis. Control septic animals received vehicle alone. Seventy-two-hour survival was significantly greater in statin pre-treated animals (43.7%) compared with their statin post-treated (12.5%) and control septic (25%) counterparts (P<0.05). Sepsis-induced biochemical derangements in liver and kidney improved with statin therapy, particularly when given pre-insult. Both simvastatin pre- and post-treatment prevented the fall in mitochondrial oxygen consumption in muscle fibres taken from septic animals at 24\u00a0h. This beneficial effect was paralleled by recovery of genes related to fatty acid metabolism. Simvastatin pre-treatment resulted in a significant decrease in myocardial ubiquinone. Patients with ALI had a marked variation in plasma simvastatin acid levels; however, their ubiquinone/low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ratio did not differ regardless of whether they were receiving statin or placebo. In summary, despite protective effects seen with statin treatment given both pre- and post-insult, survival benefit was only seen with pre-treatment, reflecting experiences in patient studies.",

There is considerable debate about the benefits conferred by statin drugs in patients with COPD. This study evaluates the association of statin drug use with all-cause and lung-related mortality in patients with COPD.", 
    "112": "This study uses population-based administrative data for the province of British Columbia, Canada. A cohort of patients with COPD was identified based on individual patient prescription records. Statin drug exposure was ascertained in the 1-year period after the COPD diagnosis. The primary and secondary outcomes, all-cause and lung-related mortality, respectively, were evaluated in the 1-year period thereafter using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models and several definitions of medication exposure.", 
    "113": "There were 39,678 patients with COPD that met the study inclusion criteria. Of them, 7,775 (19.6%) had received at least one statin drug dispensed in the exposure ascertainment window. There were 1,446 all-cause deaths recorded in the cohort in the 1-year period after exposure ascertainment. In multivariate analysis, the estimated hazard ratio (HR) for statin drug exposure was 0.79 (95%\u00a0CI, 0.68-0.92; P\u00a0= .0016), suggesting a 21%\u00a0reduction in the risk from statin drug use on all-cause mortality.

Logistic regression models examined racial-ethnic differences in acute stroke performance measures and defect-free care (intravenous tissue plasminogen activator treatment, in-hospital antithrombotic therapy, deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, discharge antithrombotic therapy, appropriate anticoagulation therapy, statin use, smoking cessation counseling) and temporal trends. Among ischemic stroke cases, 63% were non-Hispanic white (NHW), 18% were non-Hispanic black (NHB), 14% were Hispanic living in Florida, and 6% were Hispanic living in Puerto Rico. NHW patients were the oldest, followed by Hispanics, and NHBs. Defect-free care was greatest among NHBs (81%), followed by NHWs (79%) and Florida Hispanics (79%), then Puerto Rico Hispanics (57%) (P<0.0001). Puerto Rico Hispanics were less likely than Florida whites to meet any stroke care performance metric other than anticoagulation. Defect-free care improved for all groups during 2010-2014, but the disparity in Puerto Rico persisted (2010: NHWs=63%, NHBs=65%, Florida Hispanics=59%, Puerto Rico Hispanics=31%; 2014: NHWs=93%, NHBs=94%, Florida Hispanics=94%, Puerto Rico Hispanics=63%).",

We aim to identify medical and psychosocial (study) factors associated with unfavourable LDL-C control in coronary patients. Methods A cross-sectional explorative study used logistic and linear regression analysis to investigate the association between study factors and LDL-C in 1095 patients, hospitalized with myocardial infarction and/or a coronary revascularization procedure. Data were collected from hospital records, a comprehensive self-report questionnaire, clinical examination and blood samples after 2-36 months follow-up. Results Fifty-seven per cent did not reach the LDL-C target of 1.8\u2009mmol/l at follow-up. Low socioeconomic status and psychosocial factors were not associated with failure to reach the LDL-C target. Statin specific side-effects (odds ratio 3.23), low statin adherence (odds ratio 3.07), coronary artery by-pass graft operation as index treatment (odds ratio 1.95),\u2009\u2265\u20091 coronary event prior to the index event (odds ratio 1.81), female gender (odds ratio 1.80), moderate- or low-intensity statin therapy (odds ratio 1.62) and eating fish\u2009<\u20093 times/week (odds ratio 1.56) were statistically significantly associated with failure to reach the LDL-C target, in adjusted analyses. Only side-effects (standardized \u03b2 0.180), low statin adherence ( \u03b2 0.209) and moderate- or low-intensity statin therapy ( \u03b2 0.228) were associated with LDL-C in continuous analyses. Conclusions Statin specific side-effects, low statin adherence and moderate- or low-intensity statin therapy were the major factors associated with unfavourable LDL-C control. Interventions to improve LDL-C should ensure adherence and prescription of sufficiently potent statins, and address side-effects appropriately.", 
    "123": "Background Cognitive ability (CA) is positively related to later health, health literacy, health behaviours and longevity. Accordingly, a lower CA is expected to be associated with poorer adherence to medication. We investigated the long-term role of CA in adherence to prescribed statins in male patients after a first myocardial infarction (MI). Methods CA was estimated at 18-20 years of age from Military Conscript Register data for first MI male patients (\u226460 years) and was related to the one- and two-year post-MI statin adherence on average 30 years later. Background and clinical data were retrieved through register linkage with the unselected national quality register SWEDEHEART for acute coronary events (Register of Information and Knowledge about Swedish Heart Intensive Care Admissions) and secondary prevention (Secondary Prevention after Heart Intensive Care Admission). Previous and present statin prescription data were obtained from the Prescribed Drug Register and adherence was calculated as \u226580% of prescribed dispensations assuming standard dosage. Logistic regression was used to estimate crude and adjusted associations. The primary analyses used 2613 complete cases and imputing incomplete cases rendered a sample of 4061 cases for use in secondary (replicated) analyses. Results One standard deviation increase in CA was positively associated with both one-year (OR 1.15 (CI 1.01-1.31), P\u2009<\u20090.05) and two-year (OR 1.14 (CI 1.02-1.27), P\u2009<\u20090.05) adherence to prescribed statins. Only smoking attenuated the CA-adherence association after adjustment for a range of\u2009>\u200920 covariates. Imputed and complete case analyses yielded very similar results. Conclusions CA estimated on average 30 years earlier in young adulthood is a risk indicator for statin adherence in first MI male patients aged \u226460 years. Future research should include older and female patients and more socioeconomic variables.",

    "128": "Hyperlipidemia is a group of disorders characterized by excessive lipids in the bloodstream. It is associated with the incidence of cardiovascular diseases and recognized as the most important factor underlying the occurrence of atherosclerosis. This study was conducted to investigate whether pretreatment with quercetin can protect against possible memory impairment and deterioration of the cholinergic system in hyperlipidemic rats. Animals were divided into ten groups (n=7): saline/control, saline/quercetin 5mg/kg, saline/quercetin 25mg/kg, saline/quercetin 50mg/kg, saline/simvastatin (0.04mg/kg), hyperlipidemia, hyperlipidemia/quercetin 5mg/kg, hyperlipidemia/quercetin 25mg/kg, hyperlipidemia/quercetin 50mg/kg and hyperlipidemia/simvastatin. The animals were pretreated with quercetin by oral gavage for a period of 30days and hyperlipidemia was subsequently induced by intraperitoneal administration of a single dose of 500mg/kg of poloxamer-407. Simvastatin was administered after the induction of hyperlipidemia. The results demonstrated that hyperlipidemic rats had memory impairment compared with the saline control group (P<0.001). However, pretreatment with quercetin and simvastatin treatment attenuated the damage caused by hyperlipidemia compared with the hyperlipidemic group (P<0.05). Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the cerebral hippocampus was significantly (P<0.001) reduced in the hyperlipidemic group compared with the control saline group. Pretreatment with quercetin and simvastatin treatment in the hyperlipidemic groups significantly (P<0.05) increased AChE activity compared with the hyperlipidemic group.

Thus, of all HOA cases in our study population, 3.6% may have been attributable to the presence of hyperlipidaemia (population attributable risk). Most patients with HOA were elderly, but the strength of the association between HOA and hyperlipidaemia inversely correlated with increasing age, with the highest OR of 1.72 (95% CI 1.24-2.38) in patients aged 29-49 years.

Impact was defined as relative % reduction in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in the US population for the given strategy compared to current statin treatment patterns; and efficiency as the number needed to treat over 10\u00a0years (NNT10, average and maximum) to prevent each atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease event. Benefit-targeted moderate-intensity statin therapy at a treatment threshold of 2.3% expected 10-year absolute risk reduction could produce a 5.7% impact (95% confidence interval, 4.8-6.7). This is approximately equivalent to the potential impact of risk-targeted therapy at a treatment threshold of 5% 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk (5.6% impact [4.7-6.6]). Whereas the estimated maximum NNT10 is much improved for benefit-targeted versus risk-targeted therapy at these equivalent-impact thresholds (43.5 vs 180), the average NNT10 is nearly equivalent (24.2 vs 24.6). Reaching 10% impact (half the Healthy People 2020 impact objective, loosely defined) is theoretically possible with benefit-targeted moderate-intensity statins of persons with expected absolute risk reduction >2.3% if we expand age eligibility and account for treatment of all persons with diabetes mellitus or with low-density lipoprotein >190\u00a0mg/dL (impact=12.4%; average NNT10=23.0).",

Moreover, we showed that EGCG induced a significant early reduction of the extracellular PCSK9 protein level.

A mechanism-based drug-target binding model was developed, accounting for bococizumab, PCSK9, and LDL-C concentrations and the effects of concomitant administration of statins. This model was utilized to better understand the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) data obtained from 3 phase 1 and 2 phase 2a clinical studies. First, simulations performed with this model demonstrated that the conventional method of the area-under-the-curve ratio for bioavailability determination underestimated the subcutaneous bioavailability of bococizumab due to its target-mediated disposition. Second, a covariate model component for statin effects on bococizumab PK/PD was characterized, including a description of the decreased baseline LDL-C, increased baseline PCSK9, and increased LDL-C lowering with concomitant use of statins.

Thus, it can be considered as a model disease for hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). For the diagnosis of hetero-FH, the detection of Achilles tendon xanthomas by palpation or on X-ray is an indispensable diagnostic skill in clinical lipidology. To prevent the under-diagnosis and under-treatment of FH, the diagnostic criteria should be more convenient and user-friendly. For a patient with cutaneous or tendon xanthomas, the probability of FH is very high; however, an absence of xanthoma does not rule out FH.Brown and Goldstein elucidated the pathogenesis of FH by their work on LDL-receptor (LDL-R), for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1985. In the 1950s, FH patients were divided into heterozygous (hetero-) and homozygous (homo-) FH, and diagnosing homo- and hetero-FH based on the phenotypic features of ASCVD or xanthomas frequently became difficult without the DNA analysis of FH genes. It is estimated that heterozygous mutations in the LDL-R or the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) gene will be found at a combined frequency of 0.005, which corresponds to 1/199 people in the general population in Japan.Statins and anti-PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies are highly specific and efficient drugs for treating hetero- or homo-FH patients. Most clinical studies have reported an amelioration of ASCVD using long-term statin therapy. Clinical results using anti-PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies will emerge in a few years. In homo-FH patients, mipomersen and lomitapide are expected to yield good results. It is important to sequentially unravel the unrecognized pathogenetic mechanisms of FH to reduce its under-recognition and develop new management strategies for it.",

One hundred and forty-three patients were randomized to placebo or Berberol(\u00ae) K, once a day, during the dinner, for 3 months, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. We recorded a significant reduction of fasting plasma glucose with Berberol(\u00ae) K compared to placebo (-12.2%, p < 0.05). Moreover, we recorded an increase of fasting plasma insulin with Berberol(\u00ae) K both compared to baseline and to placebo (+9.9%, p < 0.05). Accordingly, the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index obtained after treatment with Berberol(\u00ae) K was lower than the one in the placebo group (-2.8%, p < 0.05). No variations of lipid profile were observed with placebo, while there was a significant decrease of total cholesterol (-20.5%, p < 0.05), triglycerides (-17.7%, p < 0.05), and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholestero (-27.8%, p < 0.05) with Berberol(\u00ae) K, compared to placebo. There was a decrease of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (-30.8%, p < 0.05), and interleukin-6 (-25.0%, p < 0.05), with Berberol(\u00ae) K compared to placebo. In conclusion, combining different hypocholesterolemic nutraceutical agents such as Berberis aristata, Silybum marianum and monacolin K and KA could be effective and safe to obtain a reduction of lipid profile and an improvement of inflammatory parameters.",

Therefore, new treatments must be developed to achieve viral clearance and prevent the risk of HCV-related\u00a0diseases. In particular, the use of pitavastatin together with DAAs may improve the antiviral efficacy as well as decrease the progression of liver fibrosis and the incidence of HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma. To investigate the management methods for HCV-related diseases using pitavastatin and DAAs, clinical trials should be undertaken. However, concerns have been raised about potential drug interactions between statins and DAAs. Therefore, pre-clinical trials using a replicon system, human hepatocyte-like cells, human neurons and human cardiomyocytes from human-induced pluripotent stem cells should be conducted. Based on these pre-clinical trials, an optimal direct-acting antiviral agent could be selected for combination with pitavastatin and DAAs. Following the pre-clinical trial, the combination of pitavastatin and the optimal direct-acting antiviral agent should be compared to other combinations of DAAs ( e.g., sofosbuvir and velpatasvir) according to the antiviral effect on HCV infection, HCV-related diseases and cost-effectiveness.",

This study was undertaken to assess the effects of melatonin (an antioxidant), 4PBA (an ER stress inhibitor), and simvastatin on the expression of ER Stress markers as well as on matrix and mitochondrial markers. HGF incubated with cyclosporine, or without melatonin/4PBA/statin.

Compared to the control cyclosporine significantly augmented ER Stress and matrix proteins, which decreased significantly with the use of melatonin, 4PBA, and simvastatin. The mitochondrial proapoptotic molecule cyclophilin D, as well as Bcl2 expression also decreased after PBA treatment, paralleling an increase in cytochrome c expression.

Accordingly, statins represent the cornerstone of lipid-lowering treatment. However, there are still unmet clinical needs in the management of dyslipidemia. Indeed, it is difficult to achieve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets in many patients, particularly in those at very high cardiovascular risk or in those with very high baseline LDL-C levels [e.g. with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)]. Moreover, a sizable proportion of patients are not able to tolerate high doses of statins, mostly due to muscle-related adverse effects.

Statin therapy impairs insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion based on clinical and epidemiologic studies. In vitro studies demonstrate that the most diabetogenic statins impair insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion by multiple mechanisms. Recent genetic studies suggest that the increased risk of type 2 diabetes may be partially explained by gene variants in the target genes for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering drugs. Population-based studies report higher incidence rates for diabetes in individuals on statin treatment compared with clinical trials. Incident diabetes has not been a prespecified endpoint in statin trials and glucose and/or HbA1c have not been routinely measured. Therefore, it is possible that the risk of diabetes in individuals on statin treatment has been underestimated in previous statin trials. Accumulating evidence from several statin trials, population-based studies, clinical studies, and in vitro studies suggests that pravastatin is the least diabetogenic statin, and simvastatin, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin the most diabetogenic statins. In vitro studies have reported new findings on mechanisms how statin treatment affects insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. In spite of diabetogenicity of different statins, the consensus is that the benefits of statins in reducing cardiovascular events clearly outweigh the risk of diabetes.",

We therefore sought to identify chemical probes that disrupt the normal function and/or integrity of the fungal vacuole to provide tools for the functional analysis of this organelle as well as potential experimental therapeutics.

Quantitative analysis of vacuolar morphology revealed that (excluding the azoles) a sub-set of 14 VDAs significantly alter vacuolar number, size and/or shape. Many C. albicans mutants with impaired vacuolar function are deficient in the formation of hyphal elements, a process essential for its pathogenicity. Accordingly, all 14 VDAs negatively impact C. albicans hyphal morphogenesis.
