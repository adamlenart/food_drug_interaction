The appropriate conditions were determined after solubility tests using different media, and sink conditions were established. The conditions used were equipment paddle at 50 rpm and 900 mL of potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.0 as dissolution medium. In vivo release profiles were obtained from the bioequivalence study of RP and the generic candidate PB. The fraction of dose absorbed was calculated using the Loo-Riegelman method. It was necessary to use a scale factor of time similar to 6.0, to associate the values of absorbed fraction and dissolved fraction, obtaining an in vivo-in vitro correlation level A. The dissolution method to quantify the amount of drug dissolved was validated using high-performance liquid chromatography and ultraviolet spectrophotometry, and validated according to the USP protocol.

Hepatic damage in rat was induced by SV (20 and 40 mg/kg/day, po for 30 days). The protective effect of NRG (50 mg/kg/day, po) was identified by estimating liver functions and oxidative stress markers such as lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, glutathion s-transferase, and catalase as well as protein profile. DNA fragmentation and histopathological study were carried out to confirm the hepatic damage. An in vitro study was conducted to further evaluate the effect of SV and/or NRG administration on the activities of two microsomal CYP isoenzymes including CYP2E1 and CYP3A1/2. SV exerted an oxidative stress which may contribute to the hepatotoxicity. Administration of NRG in combination with SV significantly improved the liver functions, state of oxidative stress, protein profile, DNA fragmentation, and the histopathological changes. SV and/or NRG have a potential to inhibit CYP3A1/2 and CYP2E1. This study concluded that concurrent administration of NRG with SV provided a protection of liver tissue against the SV-induced hepatic damage. The inhibition of CYP2E1 and CYP3A1/2 by the SV and NRG should be taken into account in order to adjust doses to avoid interaction between SV and NRG and adverse effects of SV.",

Atorvastatin evoked significant protection from hippocampal interleukin-1\u03b2 production, but not systemic interleukin-1\u03b2 production, accompanied by a marked reduction in hippocampal endothelial COX-2, NF-\u03baB activation and decreased microglial reactivity. Surgery triggered an acute decline in synapsin-1, paralleled by an increase in postsynaptic COX-2 that was partially attenuated by atorvastatin. Furthermore, phosphorylation and inactivation of neuronal GSK3\u03b2 was significantly enhanced after atorvastatin treatment.",

    "30": "In recent years, it became evident that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are implicated in the thrombotic process. Statins are lipid-lowering agents able to lower serum cholesterol levels and retard atherosclerotic complications and their clinical sequelae. There is evidence that, among statins, atorvastatin may exert antiplatelet effects by interfering with redox signaling. Recent studies demonstrated that atorvastatin possesses antiplatelet activity via inhibition of platelet formation of NADPH oxidase-derived ROS. This effect results in down-regulation of isoprostanes, which are pro-aggregating molecules, and up-regulation of nitric oxide, which is a platelet inhibitor; such changes occurred immediately after atorvastatin administration and were independent from lipid-lowering property. Experimental and clinical studies documented that statins possess antithrombotic effects, which may account for the reduction of thrombotic-related vascular outcomes. This has been evidenced in different cardiovascular clinical settings such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), myocardial infarction (MI), and venous thrombosis. Future studies should be addressed to analyze if the antiplatelet effect of atorvastatin may preferentially occur at high dosage. Interestingly, the antiplatelet effects of statins could be useful in clinical settings where the clinical efficacy of aspirin and other antiplatelet drugs is still uncertain.",

The mechanism of pleiotropic actions of cholesterol-lowering drugs, statins, against HCV and multiple cancers are not well understood. We investigated effects of fluvastatin (FLV) on microtubule-associated and cancer stem cell marker (CSC), doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) during HCV-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. HCV replication models, cancer cell lines and normal human hepatocytes were used to investigate the antiviral and antitumor effects of statins. FLV treatment resulted in induction of microtubule bundling, cell-cycle arrest and alterations in cellular DCLK1 distribution in HCV-expressing hepatoma cells. These events adversely affected the survival of liver-derived tumor cells without affecting normal human hepatocytes. FLV downregulated HCV replication in cell culture where the ATP pool and cell viability were not compromised. Pravastatin did not exhibit these effects on HCV replication, microtubules and cancer cells. The levels of miR-122 that regulates liver homeostasis and provides HCV genomic stability remained at steady state whereas DCLK1 mRNA levels were considerably reduced during FLV treatment. We further demonstrated that HCV replication was increased with DCLK1 overexpression. In conclusion, unique effects of FLV on microtubules and their binding partner DCLK1 are likely to contribute to its anti-HCV and antitumor activities in addition to its known inhibitory effects on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutary-CoA reductase (HMGCR).",

Therefore, both rosuvastatin 20 mg daily and pioglitazone 15 mg daily were started simultaneously to potentially blunt the early increase in transaminases seen with rosuvastatin. At 2 weeks, the patient's alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) had decreased 57% and 56% from baseline, respectively.

TG was reduced by 19.7% in those taking 2 g/day. The ANCHOR study showed a placebo-corrected decrease in TG of 21.5% with a 6.3% decrease in LDL-C for patients taking 4 g/day icosapent ethyl as add-on to statin therapy. TG was reduced by 10.1% in those taking 2 g/day. The main adverse effect observed was joint pain (2.3%).",

    "69": "Statins, a group of drugs used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, have adverse effects on skeletal muscle. The symptoms of these effects range from slight myalgia to severe rhabdomyolysis. The number of patients currently taking statins is estimated to be several millions worldwide. However, the mechanism of statins' myotoxic effects is unclear. Statins inhibit biosynthesis of mevalonate, a rate-limiting step of cholesterol synthesis, by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase. Mevalonate is also an essential precursor for producing isoprenoids such as farnesylpyrophosphate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate. These isoprenoids are especially important for anchoring small GTPases to the membrane before they function; e.g., Ras GTPases modulate proliferation and apoptosis, Rho GTPases control cytoskeleton formation, and Rab GTPases are essential for intracellular vesicle trafficking. Inactivation of these small GTPases alters cellular functions. Recently, we successfully reproduced statin-induced myotoxicity in culture dishes using in vitro skeletal muscle systems (e.g., skeletal myotubes and myofibers). This review summarizes our findings that statins induce depletion of isoprenoids and inactivation of small GTPases, especially Rab, which are critical for statin-induced myotoxicity. Although further study is required, our findings may contribute to the prevention and treatment of statins' adverse effects on skeletal muscle and development of safer anti-hypercholesterolemia drugs.",

At the end of 90 days, the coronary flow reserve was improved in the three groups (fluvastatin-treated group: 23.2%; diltiazem-treated group: 12.4%; fluvastatin+diltiazem-treated group: 29.1%, all P<0.05). The time to 1 mm ST segment depression increased significantly in the fluvastatin-treated group (from 241\u00b197 to 410\u00b1140 s, P<0.05), the diltiazem-treated group (from 258\u00b191 to 392\u00b1124 s, P<0.05), and the fluvastatin+diltiazem-treated group (from 250\u00b1104 to 446\u00b1164 s, P<0.05). The improvement in coronary flow reserve and prolonged time to 1 mm ST segment depression in the combination treatment group were more remarkable than in those who received monotherapy.

    "84": "High prevalence of atherosclerosis and arterial calcification in chronic kidney disease is far beyond the explanation by common cardiovascular risk factors such as aging diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia. The magnitude of coronary artery calcification is independently and inversely associated with renal function. In addition to cardiovascular risk factors, other chronic kidney disease-related risks such as phosphate retention, excess of calcium and prolonged dialysis vintage also contribute to the development of vascular calcification. Strategies to lower vascular calcification burden in chronic kidney disease population should include minimizing chronic kidney disease and atherosclerotic risk factors. Current therapies available are non-calcium containing phosphate binders, low dose active vitamin D and calcimimetic agent. The role of bisphosphonates in vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease population remains unclear. Preliminary data on sodium thiosulfate are promising, however, larger studies on efficacy and patient outcomes are necessary. Several large randomized controlled trials have confirmed the lack of benefit of statin in attenuating the progression of vascular calcification.",

Patients with diabetes (n=394) were divided into two groups, comprising 161 patients who received 20 mg/day atorvastatin (statin group), and 233 patients who did not receive statins (statin-free group). The results showed that atorvastatin treatment of patients with diabetes was not associated with changes in leptin, adiponectin, the leptin/adiponectin (L/A) ratio or homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). However, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG) and total cholesterol (Tchol) were positively correlated with leptin and L/A ratio in the statin group only (P<0.05). By contrast, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) showed a significant positive correlation with adiponectin in the statin and statin-free groups (P<0.05). Additionally, a positive correlation was found between HOMA-IR and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and TG, in both groups, whereas Tchol was positively correlated with HOMA-IR in the statin group only (P<0.05). When multivariate analysis was performed with HOMA-IR as the dependent variable, and with adjustment for age, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference, HbA1c was found to be a significant predictor of HOMA-IR or insulin resistance. In conclusion, atorvastatin treatment may have several effects on the interaction between leptin and adiponectin, and on clinical parameters in patients with type II diabetes.",

HUVECs were stimulated with HGF, statins and farnesylpyrophosphat ammonium salt (FPP) or geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate (GGPP), respectively. Cell proliferations were counted 48 hours after initial stimuli and distances between migration fronts were used in migration analyses.", 
    "92": "All types of statins showed significant anti-migrative and anti-proliferative characters. Simvastatin and fluvastatin but not cerivastatin, were able to inhibit the HGF-depending migration and showed a significant effect on the inhibition of the isoprenylation (GGPP). Only simvastatin influenced the HGF-depending migration via inhibiting the isoprenylation process through GGPP. Cerivastatin significantly decreased the proliferation and Fluvastatin significantly enhanced the migration behaviors of HUVECs when they were co-incubated with methyl-8-cyclodextrin (MCD).", 
    "93": "Statins countermand the proproliferative and as well as the promigrative effect of HGF on HUVECs. The mechanisms which provoke this effect are dependent on the type of statin. Direct interactions of statins with lipid rafts play a significant role in the endothelial cell mechanisms.",

Modulation of membrane transporters for drug efflux, operated by substrates, can also affect drugs' tissue levels. We report rhabdomyolysis in an elderly patient, in multitreatment with different potentially myotoxic medications, taking place seven months after atorvastatin discontinuation. Affected by ischaemic heart disease, arterial hypertension and dementia-related behaviour disturbances, the patient was receiving angiotensin 2-receptor inhibitors, beta-blockers, vasodilators, diuretics, salycilates, allopurinol, proton pump inhibitors, antipsychotics and antidepressants. He had taken atorvastatin for 14 years, with constantly normal creatine-kinase plasma levels. Two months after addition of the antianginal drug ranolazine, creatine-kinase mildly increased and atorvastatin was withdrawn. Nonetheless, creatine-kinase progressively rose, with severe weakness and rhabdomyolysis developing seven months later. Muscle biopsy showed a necrotizing myopathy with no inflammation or autoimmune changes. After ranolazine withdrawal, creatine-kinase and myoglobin returned to normal levels and strength was restored. Several psychotropic and cardiovascular medications prescribed to the patient share either cytochrome P450 biotransformation and permeability-glycoprotein efflux transport.

The pharmacological interactions produced by RPV are due to its effects on the CYP450 system; RPV is a substrate and mild inducer of CYP3A4. Moreover, in vitro, RPV inhibits glycoprotein-P. RPV has clinically significant pharmacological interactions, especially with protease inhibitors (except boosted darunavir and lopinavir) and the NNRTIs efavirenz and nevirapine. Coadministration of RPV with drugs that increase gastric pH, such as omeprazole, or those inducing CYP3A4, such as rifampicin, can significantly reduce RPV concentrations and is contraindicated.

The serum levels of the cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2, and the levels of the chemokines IL-8 (CXCL8) and MCP-1 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and tested for their association with cardiovascular disease. The suppression of circulating levels of TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1 and IL-8 and their enhancing effect on IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 production were more pronounced in male patients. Female patients treated with statins who had a previous myocardial infarction presented higher median levels of both TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 (P<0.05) and a lower median level of IL-10 than female patients without MI (P<0.05).

Although evidence to support the use of beta blockers in this setting has been primarily derived from retrospective studies or subgroup analyses, they are generally recommended in most patients with ALVD, especially those with ischemic etiology. Statins are associated with improvements in both major adverse cardiovascular events and heart failure events among patients with a history of acute myocardial infarction.

Atorvastatin reduced HMGCoA-R enzymatic activity and intracellular cholesterol synthesis in vitro. However, inflammatory stress weakened these suppressive effects. Atorvastatin at concentrations of 16 \u03bcmol/L inhibited HMGCoA-R activity by 50% in vascular smooth muscle cells, but the same concentration resulted in only 30% of HMGCoA-R activity in vascular smooth muscle cells in the presence of interleukin-1\u03b2. Knocking down sterol regulatory element binding protein cleavage-activating protein prevented statin resistance induced by interleukin-1\u03b2, and overexpression of sterol regulatory element binding protein cleavage-activating protein induced statin resistance even without inflammatory stress. In vivo, the amount of atorvastatin required to lower serum cholesterol and decrease aortic lipid accumulation rose from 2 to 10 mg/kg per day in the presence of inflammatory stress.",

Whether simvastatin can sensitize the gastric cancer to the antitumor effects of capecitabine in vitro and in vivo was investigated. The effect of simvastatin on the proliferation of gastric cancer cells was examined by mitochondrial dye-uptake 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method, apoptosis by esterase staining, NF-\u03baB activation by DNA binding assay, and protein expression by western blot analysis. The effect of simvastatin on the tumor growth in xenograft mouse model of human gastric cancer was also examined. Simvastatin suppressed the proliferation of gastric cancer cells, enhanced the apoptotic effects of capecitabine, suppressed the constitutive activation of NF-\u03baB, and abrogated the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), cyclin D1, Bcl-2, survivin, CXC motif receptor 4, and MMP-9 proteins. In a xenograft mouse model, we observed that the administration of simvastatin alone (5 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneal thrice/week) significantly suppressed the growth of the tumor and this effect was further potentiated by capecitabine treatment. As compared to the vehicle control, simvastatin also suppressed the expression of NF-\u03baB-regulated gene products such as cyclin D1, COX-2, ICAM-1, MMP-9, survivin, Bcl-xL, and XIAP in tumor tissues. Overall, our results demonstrate that simvastatin can enhance the effects of capecitabine through suppression of NF-\u03baB-regulated markers of proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis.",

Various treatments for presumed musculoskeletal diagnoses did not help. When reviewing his medications, the patient concluded that the only new one before the appearance of his symptoms was tadalafil. He stopped taking it, and his pain resolved immediately thereafter. On review, it was noted that the patient was also on pravastatin. There have been a few previous reports of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with the concomitant use of a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (PDE5I), such as tadalafil and a statin. We report a case where such processes may have been occurring and may have resolved shortly after discontinuing concomitant use, in turn resulting in decreased pain.

Statins, long known to be beneficial in conditions where dyslipidemia occurs by lowering serum cholesterol levels, also have been proposed for use in neurodegenerative conditions, including AD. However, it is not clear that the purported effectiveness of statins in neurodegenerative disorders is directly related to cholesterol-lowering effects of these agents; rather, the pleiotropic functions of statins likely play critical roles. The aim of this review is to provide an overview on the new discoveries about the effects of statin therapy on the oxidative and nitrosative stress levels as well as on the modulation of the heme oxygenase/biliverdin reductase (HO/BVR) system in the brain. We propose a novel mechanism of action for atorvastatin which, through the activation of HO/BVR-A system, may contribute to the neuroprotective effects thus suggesting a potential therapeutic role in AD and potentially accounting for the observation of decreased AD incidence with persons on statin.",

However, evidence from various studies indicates existence of many statin-induced side effects such as myopathies, rhabdomyolysis, hepatotoxicity, peripheral neuropathy, impaired myocardial contractility, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, and erectile dysfunction (ED). Physician awareness of these side effects is reported to be very low even for the adverse effects (AEs) most widely reported by patients. This can lead to incorrect treatment decisions, compromised patient care, and an increase in patient morbidity.

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched through December 2012 using Web-based search engines (PubMed and OVID). The search terms included \"apolipoprotein,\" \"rosuvastatin,\" \"atorvastatin,\" \"randomized,\" \"randomly,\" and \"randomization.\" Of 42 potentially relevant studies initially screened, 25 reports of randomized trials enrolling 14,283 patients were included. A pooled analysis for the percentage of changes in ApoA-I demonstrated a benefit of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin in the comparison of all rosuvastatin/atorvastatin dose ratios (mean difference 2.97%, 3.39%, 5.77%, and 6.25%). For the percentage of changes in ApoB, a benefit was seen for rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin in the 1/1 (-6.06%) and 1/2 dose ratio (-1.80%). However, a benefit was seen for atorvastatin versus rosuvastatin in the 1/4 (2.38%) and 1/8 dose ratio (6.59%). The pooled analysis for the percentage of changes in the Apo B/A-I ratios demonstrated a benefit for rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin in the 1/1 (-7.22%) and 1/2 dose ratio (-3.51%), with no difference in the 1/4 dose ratio. In contrast, a benefit was seen for atorvastatin versus rosuvastatin in the 1/8 dose ratio (4.03%). In conclusion, rosuvastatin might increase Apo A-I levels at all dose ratios and decrease ApoB levels and ApoB/A-I ratios in the 1/1 and 1/2 dose ratio versus atorvastatin. Only higher dose atorvastatin appeared to be more effective for the reduction in ApoB levels (1/4 and 1/8 dose ratio) and Apo B/A-I ratios (1/8 dose ratio).",

Account 3 viewed the healthcare professional role to be one of educator, emphasising the provision of information. Account 4 perceived lifestyle change to be difficult for patients and emphasised the need for healthcare professionals to be role models. Account 5 was inconsistent about the value of lifestyle change, or the role of healthcare professionals in promoting it, a finding that may be due to ambivalence about the health check or to lack of engagement with the Q sort task.

This review includes only the domains of the management of blood pressure, lipid control, glycemic control, and use of aspirin. Over the last 10 years, new randomized controlled trials (RCT) designed to study different blood pressure treatment targets did not find evidence that intensive systolic blood pressure control (<130 mmHg) resulted in lower rates of myocardial infarction and mortality than less-intensive control. There are risks of side effects with achieving systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mmHg. Lipid-lowering statins are effective in reducing cardiovascular events in middle-aged and older adults, but data on niacin and fibrates is limited. Trials of statins and other lipid-lowering agents do not evaluate the cardiovascular effects on outcomes from treating lipids to different low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets. No RCTs of lipid-lowering drugs enrolled significant numbers of adults aged 80 and older with or without DM. Three major RCTs that investigated intensive glycemic control did not find reductions in primary cardiovascular endpoints, and one study reported greater mortality with glycosylated hemoglobin of less than 6%. Two recently published RCTs were designed to study the cardiovascular benefits of aspirin use by individuals with DM. Neither trial found significantly fewer primary cardiovascular endpoints with aspirin than in control groups. Overall, RCTs enrolled few adults aged 80 and older or with significant comorbidities.

The adjusted likelihood of vitamin D (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.07, 95% CI 1.19-3.59) and especially erythrocyte-stimulating agents (aOR 19.94, 95% CI 7.01-56.00) rose in a graded manner to peak with eGFR <15 versus >90, whereas statin use was most common with eGFR 30-59 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Black race was independently associated with increased use of all classes of antihypertensives and vitamin D, but lower adjusted statin use. Rapamycin-based immunosuppression was associated with increased use of statins and erythrocyte-stimulating agents.", 
    "241": "Integrated registry and pharmacy fill data provide a novel tool for pharmacoepidemiologic investigations of delivered post-transplant care. Transplant recipients with reduced renal function have increased requirements for pharmaceutical care of comorbidities. Causes of racial variation in medication fills warrant further investigation.", 
    "242": "Data on atorvastatin pretreatment in Asian patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are limited. However, there have been studies in other populations in Asia which demonstrated that statins can reduce the risk of periprocedural myocardial infarction (MI).", 
    "243": "Statin-na\u00efve patients with non-ST-segment-elevation (NSTE)-ACS scheduled for PCI were randomized to usual care or atorvastatin preloading groups. All patients received usual care including atorvastatin 40 mg/day. The atorvastatin group received atorvastatin 80 mg 12 h and 40 mg 2 h pre-PCI. Of 499 patients randomized, 247 were assigned to atorvastatin preloading. Following coronary angiography, 335 patients (163 atorvastatin) received PCI. During the 30 days post-PCI, major adverse cardiac events (death, MI, and target vessel revascularization) occurred in 24 (15%) atorvastatin and 27 (16%) usual care patients (p=NS). Post hoc analyses showed that at 8 h post-PCI, 3.82% of the atorvastatin group and 7.22% of the usual care group had a post-procedural creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) above 3 times the upper limit of normal (p=0.27) and at 24 h post-PCI, the rate was 7.64% versus 9.47% (p=1.0). Safety profile suggests that high-dose atorvastatin (40 mg) for up to 1 month, in conjunction with usual care, is relatively safe and well tolerated.", 
    "244": "This study of statin-na\u00efve Korean and Chinese patients with NSTE-ACS who received additional atorvastatin loading doses of 80 mg at 12 h, and 40 mg at 2 h, pre-PCI did not find a beneficial effect compared with usual post-PCI atorvastatin 40 mg/day treatment. Atorvastatin was found to be well tolerated in Asian patients with NSTE-ACS undergoing PCI. Results of the current study merit further investigation of the early use of statins in patients with NSTE-ACS to delineate patient subgroups who may benefit from this therapy.", 
    "245": "Statins are safe but have a significant potential for pharmacological interactions. The objective of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of potential interactions throughout the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4) system in a large sample of statin-treated subjects and to determine which factors, from the patient and the physician, were associated with a higher risk of interactions.", 
    "246": "This is an observational, cross-over, population study that included 7,880 subjects treated with statins. Both data from patients and from the1,681 participating physicians were recorded and analyzed.", 
    "247": "Fifty-nine percent of the participants were receiving a statin metabolized by the CYP3A4, and 21.5% of all participants received a drug, different from a statin, metabolized by the CYP3A4. There were no differences in the frequency of utilization of statins metabolized or not by the CYP3A4 in relation to the simultaneous prescription of drugs metabolized by the same pathway (22 vs. 21%, respectively). Globally, 12.9% of all participants were at risk of an interaction. These patients were older, received a higher number of drugs and had more comorbidity. Sixty percent of the physicians mentioned that the possibility of an interaction greatly conditioned their selection of a particular statin. Likewise, 56% of them had software that alerted of possible interactions. These aspects, however, did not influence the number of patients at risk of interactions.", 
    "248": "The proportion of statin-treated patients at risk of interaction is elevated. Physicians do not usually pay attention to this possibility despite having available alert software and therapeutic alternatives.", 
    "249": "Lipid core expansion is partly responsible for the conversion of a stable atherosclerotic lesion to a rupture-prone plaque. Intraplaque hemorrhage contributes to the accumulation of cholesterol within unstable plaques. In the present study, we investigated, using a rabbit model of atherosclerosis, the extent to which diet-induced increases in cholesterol content of erythrocyte membranes (CEM) contribute to lipid core expansion and the modulatory effect of rosuvastatin use.", 
    "250": "Rabbits fed with atherogenic diet (0.75% cholesterol) for 5 months exhibited advanced atherosclerotic lesions (mean plaque area, 0.39 \u00b1 0.03 mm(2)), and lipid core size was associated with the concentration-time integral (CTI) of CEM levels (r=0.567, P=0.004) independent of other established predictors of lipid core size. Further experiments were performed by feeding rabbits atherogenic diet (1% cholesterol) for 3 months, followed by either normal diet or normal diet plus rosuvastatin for the next 3 months. Although no differences were observed in total plaque area between both groups, administration of rosuvastatin was associated with significantly smaller lipid cores, fewer macrophages within the lipid core, less microvessels as well as with lower CTI of CEM levels compared to normal diet alone. Moreover, intraplaque erythrocyte membranes covered a smaller lipid core area in rabbits under rosuvastatin plus normal diet as opposed to rabbits under diet alone.", 
    "251": "Increased CEM levels, induced by high-cholesterol diet, are associated with lipid core growth. Ingestion of a potent HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (rosuvastatin) may decrease CEM levels, and this effect may contribute to regression of the lipid core.", 
    "252": "It has been hypothesized that statins, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, may be used to treat fungal infections. Here we review data on antifungal properties of statins, effects on the host inflammatory response as well as available clinical evidence. We conclude that: statins exhibit antifungal properties in vitro although at supraphysiological concentrations; statins appear to have anti-inflammatory effects on host cells in vitro; statins have effects on fungal physiology beyond direct growth inhibition; clinical studies are scarce (n = 5), and their design is retrospective and observational, which is associated with a high risk of bias. Given the limited evidence for a beneficial effect of statins in fungal infection, randomized and controlled trials are highly warranted in this field.", 
    "253": "Pitavastatin is the last marketed statin. Different studies have shown that pitavastatin is more potent than pravastatin and simvastatin in reducing LDL-cholesterol levels, and equivalent to atorvastatin and rosuvastatin. Moreover, pitavastatin provides a significant and sustained increase of HDL-cholesterol levels. Remarkably, as pitavastatin is minimally metabolized by CYP, the risk of interactions with other drugs is low. Additionally, pitavastatin does not interfere with glucose metabolism in diabetics and non-diabetics, and exerts a beneficial effect in patients with renal dysfunction. However, although available information may suggest that pitavastatin can improve cardiovascular prognosis, data coming from specifically designed clinical trials are still warranted. The aim of this review was to update the available evidence about efficacy and safety of pitavastatin, and to analyze the place of pitavastatin in the current armamentarium for the treatment of patients with hypercholesterolemia."
