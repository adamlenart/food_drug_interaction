    "0": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in the United States. In high-risk patients, statin therapy has become the standard of care. In fact, statins are the most efficacious drugs for decreasing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels; they reduce both primary and secondary cardiovascular risk in the general population. However, less is known about the safety of statin use in patients with liver disease. Results from studies of statin therapy in patients with elevated liver enzyme levels, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, hepatitis C, cirrhosis, liver transplants, and hepatocellular carcinoma show benefit without increased risk of adverse effects. Thus, based on available evidence, statin therapy should not be withheld in this patient population; however, more robust, prospective clinical trials are needed to confirm the safety and efficacy.", 
    "1": "Statins effectively lower plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and reduce the risk of vascular events. However, this benefit might be improved by dealing with other vascular risk factors such as high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). It follows that there has been an interest in drugs that raise plasma HDL-C levels. Among these drugs are the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors. The first CETP inhibitor to be evaluated in an event-based trial was torcetrapib. This drug can considerably elevate serum HDL-C levels (e.g., by 72%). However, a recently published trial (ILLUMINATE) showed that torcetrapib used in combination with atorvastatin was associated with significantly more vascular events and deaths than atorvastatin alone. This finding resulted in the discontinuation of the torcetrapib development programme. The cause(s) of the adverse outcome remain speculative. It has been suggested that a significant rise in systolic blood pressure and possibly the quality of the HDL produced may be relevant. Despite this disappointing outcome it seems to be too early to close the book on CETP inhibitors because two other members of this class are being evaluated. These drugs (JTT-705 and anacetrapib) may be devoid of the adverse effect on systolic blood pressure. Eventually only appropriately designed, event-based trials, will settle the issue of whether CETP inhibitors are clinically useful.",

    "3": "This study was a multicenter, open-label, prospective trial of atorvastatin therapy in hyperlipidemic patients with type 2 diabetes. The patients were divided into three groups according to initial LDL-C levels (130-149, 150-159 and > or = 160 mg/dL), and 10, 20, and 40 mg of atorvastatin was administered to each group, respectively. If LDL-C did not reach the 100 mg/dL target level at four weeks after initiation of treatment, the doses were increased by one step.

    "6": "Hemodialyzed patients with chronic kidney disease are prone to atherosclerosis, which occurs due mainly to lipid abnormalities. Abnormal lipid metabolism could result, among others, from increased formation of free radicals and, consequently, oxidative stress in these patients. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the influence of therapy with lovastatin or with a hypolipemic diet only on oxidative stress in hemodialyzed patients. We addressed the issue by measuring the total antioxidant status (TAS) and the level of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), an oxidative DNA damage metabolite, in the serum. The study group consisted of 71 patients. They were divided into 3 groups: treated with lovastatin (20 mg/day, n=30), with a hypolipemic diet alone (n=28), and untreated controls (n=13). Serum levels of TAS and 8-OHdG (8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine) were determined. Blood samples were collected at the beginning of the study and then after a 6 months' therapy. We found that the level of 8-OHdG decreased considerably only in the lovastatin-treated group; the decrease was from 15.6+/-8.1 to 12.5+/-4.8 ng/ml (P=0.04). In the other two groups changes in 8-OHdG were insignificant. The level of TAS increased significantly in the lovastatin-treated group from 1.28+/-0.20 to 1.37+/-0.116 mmol/l (P=0.011), decreased in the diet-treated group from 1.55+/-0.14 to 1.45+/-0.11 mmol/l (P=0.007), and remained unchanged in the untreated group (1.42+/-0.11 vs. 1.40+/-0.12 mmol/l). We conclude that lovastatin, but not a hypolipemic diet alone, exerts an antioxidant effect in hemodialyzed patients. However, the determinants of the antioxidant effect of statins in patients with chronic renal failure are unclear and their resolution would require alternative study designs.", 
    "7": "Fluvastatin, the first entirely synthetic statin, has a significant cholesterol-lowing effect comparable with other statins. In addition, it has been shown to inhibit oxidative stress and improve vascular endothelial function. The aim of this study was to clarify the pretreatment effects of fluvastatin on liver function after massive hepatectomy in rats. Six-week-old male Wister rats were divided into two groups: a fluvastatin group (group F), pretreated with oral administration of fluvastatin (20 mg/kg per day) for 2 days before 90% hepatectomy; and a control group (group C), pretreated with vehicle for 2 days before hepatectomy. Animals were sacrificed at 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after hepatectomy. The liver regeneration rate, liver function tests, and hepatic stellate cell activation were examined. The liver regeneration rate in group F was significantly higher at 72 h after hepatectomy (P < 0.05). The serum level of total bilirubin in group F was significantly lower at 48 h after hepatectomy (P < 0.05). Sinusoidal area in group F was maintained histologically. Furthermore, the expression of alpha smooth-muscle actin (alpha-SMA) protein in the liver was inhibited in group F at 48 h after hepatectomy. This study demonstrated the beneficial effects of fluvastatin in a lethal massive hepatectomy model using rats, with improved hepatic regeneration and microcirculations, by inhibiting the activation of hepatic stellate cells.",

LV systolic and diastolic functions were evaluated by measuring transmitral flow velocity, mitral annular motion velocity, and the myocardial strain and strain rate profiles using pulsed Doppler, tissue velocity, and ultrasonic strain imaging. Subclinical atherosclerosis also was determined by measuring the intima - media thickness (IMT) and stiffness beta of the left and right common carotid arteries using B- and M-mode ultrasonography. During the follow-up period, the mean peak systolic strains of the LV posterior and inferior walls increased from 39.2+/-15.9% to 51.5+/-17.7% (p<0.01) and 46.0+/-12.2% to 57.5+/-10.3% (p<0.01), respectively, in the pitavastatin group compared with the no statin group.

    "22": "Rosuvastatin is a relatively new member of the statin family (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), with superior lipid-lowering effects and a pattern of clinical side effects, including a low incidence of myopathy, similar to other widely prescribed statins. This article describes investigations of myopathy in the rat following administration of very high doses of rosuvastatin. The nature of the changes were found to be entirely consistent with those seen with other statins, including a differential sensitivity of muscle fibers (with glycolytic fibers [type IIB] the most sensitive and oxidative fibers [type I] the least), a delay of approximately 10 days after the start of oral dosing before necrosis was apparent, and ultrastructural alterations appearing first in mitochondria. In addition, the development of myopathy was prevented by coadministration of mevalonate, the product of HMG-CoA reductase. The findings illustrate a pattern of induced myopathy in the rat directly attributable to inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase that is entirely consistent between the various statins, with the oral dose required to produce the changes being a differentiating feature (based on these new data and a previously reported study from the same laboratory): cerivastatin dose less than simvastatin, and simvastatin dose less than rosuvastatin.",

However, evidence for statin treatment in patients with HF remains a subject of debate. Thus, a study was initiated to examine the effects of pitavastatin on cardiac function evaluated by echocardiographic findings and plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels in patients with HF. Twenty-three patients with HF were treated with pitavastatin 1-2 mg/day in addition to standard therapy for 7.5 +/- 3.8 months. Left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVDd) and left ventricular end-systolic dimension (LVDs) were determined by echocardiography. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was calculated using Teichholz's formula. Serum lipid and plasma BNP levels were also measured. During the follow-up period, LVEF was increased from 42 +/- 11 to 48 +/- 13% (P = 0.002). LVDs was reduced from 43 +/- 10 to 40 +/- 10 mm (P < 0.001), while there was no change in LVDd. E/A (n = 10) and deceleration time (n = 7), obtained in some patients, did not change significantly (0.89 +/- 0.33 to 0.77 +/- 0.17%, and 215 +/- 46 to 227 +/- 72 msec, respectively). In addition, the plasma BNP level was moderately, but significantly decreased from 94 +/- 78 to 70 +/- 56 pg/mL (P = 0.005). In subgroup analysis, LVEF was improved in both patients with ischemic and nonischemic HF. There was no significant correlation between the percent change in serum total cholesterol and the percent change in LVEF by pitavastatin treatment. Serum total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides decreased by 21%, 30%, and 15%, respectively, and HDL-cholesterol increased by 12%. Pitavastatin improved cardiac function in patients with HF, which generally worsens with time. The results suggest that pitavastatin may be beneficial for treatment of HF.", 
    "33": "The aim of this study was to investigate whether atorvastatin inhibits epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation in cardiomyocytes in vitro and slows the progression of cardiac remodeling induced by pressure overload in mice. Either atorvastatin (5 mg/kg/day) or vehicle was orally administered to male C57BL/6J mice with transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Physiological parameters were obtained by echocardiography or left ventricular (LV) catheterization, and morphological and molecular parameters of the heart were also examined. Furthermore, cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were studied to clarify the underlying mechanisms. Four weeks after TAC, atorvastatin reduced the heart/body weight and lung/body weight ratios (8.69+/-0.38 to 6.45+/-0.31 mg/g (p<0.001) and 10.89+/-0.68 to 6.61+/-0.39 mg/g (p<0.01) in TAC mice with and without atorvastatin, respectively). Decrease of LV end-diastolic pressure and the time constant of relaxation, increased fractional shortening, downregulation of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)12, ADAM17 and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor genes, and reduction of the activity of EGFR and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were observed in the atorvastatin group. Phenylephrine-induced protein synthesis, phosphorylation of EGFR, and activation of ERK in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were all inhibited by atorvastatin. These findings indicated that atorvastatin ameliorates cardiac remodeling in mice with pressure overload, and its actions are associated with inhibition of the EGFR signaling pathway.", 
    "34": "Statins have been shown to be cardioprotective; however, their interaction with endogenous cardioprotection by ischemic preconditioning and postconditioning is not known. In the present study, we examined if acute and chronic administration of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin affected the infarct size-limiting effect of ischemic preconditioning and postconditioning in rat hearts. Wistar rats were randomly assigned to the following three groups: 1) vehicle (1% methylcellulose per os for 12 days), 2) chronic lovastatin (15 mg.kg(-1).day(-1) per os for 12 days), and 3) acute lovastatin (1% methylcellulose per os for 12 days and 50 micromol/l lovastatin in the perfusate). Hearts isolated from the three groups were either subjected to a nonconditioning (aerobic perfusion followed by 30-min coronary occlusion and 120-min reperfusion, i.e., test ischemia-reperfusion), preconditioning (three intermittent periods of 5-min ischemia-reperfusion cycles before test ischemia-reperfusion), or postconditioning (six cycles of 10-s ischemia-reperfusion after test ischemia) perfusion protocol. Preconditioning and postconditioning significantly decreased infarct size in vehicle-treated hearts. However, preconditioning failed to decrease infarct size in acute lovastatin-treated hearts, but the effect of postconditioning remained unchanged. Chronic lovastatin treatment abolished postconditioning but not preconditioning; however, it decreased infarct size in the nonconditioned group. Myocardial levels of coenzyme Q9 were decreased in both acute and chronic lovastatin-treated rats. Western blot analysis revealed that both acute and chronic lovastatin treatment attenuated the phoshorylation of Akt; however, acute but not chronic lovastatin treatment increased the phosphorylation of p42 MAPK/ERK. We conclude that, although lovastatin may lead to cardioprotection, it interferes with the mechanisms of cardiac adaptation to ischemic stress.",

    "39": "Five models are proposed to describe the relations among statins, pleiotropic effects, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowering, and cardiovascular risk reduction. On the basis of the evidence available, the pleiotropic effects of statins do not appear to reduce cardiovascular risk more than would be predicted from LDL cholesterol lowering alone, which suggests that model 1 is not a valid model. Although most attention has focused on models 2 through 4, most data to date support model 3 for describing the relation between statins, inflammation, and cardiovascular risk. Stronger consideration should also be given to model 5, in which pleiotropic effects are the result of cardiovascular risk reduction in and of itself. It may be that other models are operative for nonatherosclerotic inflammatory disorders. However, beneficial effects of statins on rheumatologic or other noncardiovascular may still be due to effects of cholesterol reduction on the immune system, as in model 3. More high-quality research is needed to determine the role of statin pleiotropic effects in cardiovascular risk reduction. Well-designed animal studies can help elucidate potential mechanisms, which will then require confirmation in human studies with cardiovascular event outcomes. Substudies of cardiovascular end point trials and mechanistic studies should be methodologically sound and designed to test specific models. To sort out the independence of pleiotropic effects from LDL cholesterol lowering, studies will need to achieve similar LDL cholesterol reductions in each treatment group. It may be that the biologic impact of a specific pleiotropic effect is mediated by >1 model. Ultimately, once a predominant model has been identified for a given pleiotropic effect, long-term studies would be needed to evaluate the relative contributions of various pleiotropic effects to cardiovascular risk reduction. These findings may reveal new targets for the development of new agents that will prove effective for reducing cardiovascular events when added to LDL cholesterol lowering. To date, little evidence supports consideration of statin pleiotropic effects in clinical decision making. In conclusion, LDL cholesterol is currently the only reliable marker for statin effects on cardiovascular risk reduction. The focus should remain on closing the treatment gap and improving adherence to therapies directed at lowering LDL cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "40": "Although low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a well-established atherogenic factor for coronary heart disease, it does not completely represent the risk associated with atherogenic lipoproteins in the presence of high triglyceride (TG) levels. Constituent lipoproteins constituting non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) include atherogenic TG-rich lipoproteins, cholesteryl ester-enriched remnants of TG-rich lipoproteins, and lipoprotein(a). Recent observational and intervention studies suggest that the predictive value of non-HDL-C for cardiovascular risk and mortality is better than low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and that non-HDL-C correlates highly with plasma apolipoprotein B levels. Currently, the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines identify non-HDL-C as a secondary target of therapy in patients with TG elevation (> or =200 mg/dl) after the attainment of LDL-C target goals. In patients with coronary heart disease or coronary heart disease risk equivalents, an optional non-HDL-C goal is <100 mg/dl. To achieve the non-HDL-C goal, statin therapy may be intensified or combined with ezetimibe, niacin, a fibrate, or omega-3 fatty acids. In conclusion, non-HDL-C remains an important target of therapy for patients with elevated TGs, although its widespread adoption has yet to gain a foothold among health care professionals treating patients with dyslipidemia.", 
    "41": "Hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) decrease serum cholesterol. Dyslipidemia is believed to be associated with the development of renal dysfunction. It was postulated that statins may reduce the development of renal dysfunction. The effect of statin use on the development of renal dysfunction in 197,551 patients (Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Integrated Service Network 16 [VISN16] database) was examined. Of these patients, 29.5% (58,332 patients) were statin users and 70.5% (139,219 patients) were not. Development of renal dysfunction was defined as doubling of baseline creatinine or increase in serum creatinine > or =0.5 mg/dl from the first to last measurement with a minimum of 90 days in between. During 3.1 years of follow-up, 3.4% of patients developed renal dysfunction. After adjustment for demographics, diabetes mellitus, smoking, hypertension, and other medications (mainly angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and aspirin), use of statins decreased the odds of developing renal dysfunction by 13% (odds ratio [OR] 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82 to 0.92, p <0.0001). The beneficial effect of statins appeared to be independent of the decrease in cholesterol. Other variables that affected the development of renal dysfunction were age (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.04, p <0.0001), diabetes (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.68 to 1.86, p <0.0001), hypertension (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.2, p = 0.0153), and smoking (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.24, p = 0.0244). In conclusion, statin use may retard the development of renal dysfunction. The beneficial effect of statins in preventing the development of renal dysfunction appears to be independent of their lipid-lowering effect.", 
    "42": "In this work, amorphous atorvastatin calcium nanoparticles were successfully prepared using the supercritical antisolvent (SAS) process. The effect of process variables on particle size and distribution of atorvastatin calcium during particle formation was investigated. Solid state characterization, solubility, intrinsic dissolution, powder dissolution studies and pharmacokinetic study in rats were performed. Spherical particles with mean particle size ranging between 152 and 863 nm were obtained by varying process parameters such as precipitation vessel pressure and temperature, drug solution concentration and feed rate ratio of CO2/drug solution. XRD, TGA, FT-IR, FT-Raman, NMR and HPLC analysis indicated that atorvastatin calcium existed as anhydrous amorphous form and no degradation occurred after SAS process. When compared with crystalline form (unprocessed drug), amorphous atorvastatin calcium nanoparticles were of better performance in solubility and intrinsic dissolution rate, resulting in higher solubility and faster dissolution rate. In addition, intrinsic dissolution rate showed a good correlation with the solubility. The dissolution rates of amorphous atorvastatin calcium nanoparticles were highly increased in comparison with unprocessed drug by the enhancement of intrinsic dissolution rate and the reduction of particle size resulting in an increased specific surface area.

Among these, the Atorvastatin Landmarks program - a group of 32 major atorvastatin trials - has assessed the efficacy and safety of atorvastatin across its full dose range and has helped illustrate its effectiveness in treatment of cardiovascular disease and its related disorders and also in non-cardiovascular outcomes.", 
    "44": "This paper will review the major atorvastatin clinical trials and report the important findings and their clinical significance.", 
    "45": "Clinical trials with atorvastatin have established significant reductions in cardiovascular events in patients with and without CHD. Studies show that high-dose atorvastatin will reduce LDL to approximately 70 mg/dL in many patients and improve cardiac outcomes. Current evidence suggests that high-dose atorvastatin can halt and, in some cases, reverse atherosclerotic progression. A study of diabetic patients showed atorvastatin decreased the occurrence of acute CHD events, coronary revascularizations, and stroke. Atorvastatin has been found to be effective for reducing nonfatal myocardial infarctions and fatal CHD in hypertensive patients with three or more additional risk factors. High-dose atorvastatin was found to be effective in reducing risk of recurrent stroke in patients with prior cerebrovascular events, has been shown to benefit patients suffering a recent acute coronary syndrome, and to slow cognitive decline in preliminary studies of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Atorvastatin has been associated with reduced progression of mild chronic kidney disease; however, in a randomized trial of patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis, atorvastatin showed no statistically significant benefit. Limitations of this review include lack of generalizability of the atorvastatin trial data to other statins, lack of head to head outcome trials involving the newer more potent statins, and the relatively short study durations (none exceeded 5 years) when atherosclerosis is typically a decades-long disease.",

    "48": "A group of 96 patients (pts), of both sexes, aged 34-59, with primary hyperlipidemia and coronary heart disease were monitored at baseline and 12 times within 12 months by the measurement of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1), apolipoprotein B (apoB), and lipoprotein (a) were monitored at baseline, after 6 months and after 12 months of atorvastatin therapy. The analyses were performed in the laboratory of the Clinical Biochemistry Institute of the Clinical Centre in Skopje. Serum levels of TC were evaluated using the calorimetric method, LDL was calculated according to Friedewald's formula, and HDL was determined with a precipitation test. Serum levels of apoA1, apoB and lipoprotein (a) were measured by the immunoturbidimetric method. The therapeutic doses of atorvastatin used were 40 mg. Liver enzymes, alanine aminotransferase (AST), aspartate aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CPK) level were also monitored in our patients.", 
    "49": "According to our results, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and apolipoprotein B (apoB) levels decreased after treatment by 43.58%, by 41.46%, and by 6,8%; high-density lipoprotein (HDL) increased insignificantly by 4%, apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) and lipoprotein (a) remained unchanged.", 
    "50": "The significant reduction of total serum cholesterol, LDL, and apoprotein B levels achieved represents the good result of the atorvastatin therapy, as opposed to the effects on HDL values, which showed no significant increase. Serum apolipoprotein A1 levels and serum lipoprotein (a) levels remainned unchanged at baseline and after 12 months of atorvastatin therapy, and they remained stable over time. This probably means that atorvastatin has no therapeutic effect on the two parameters investigated. Elevation in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels greater than twice the upper limit of normal were seen in only one patient, after 12 months of atorvastatin therapy. Creatine kinase levels remained stable over time.",

Three-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors reduce vascular inflammation and induce angiogenesis. This study examined whether simvastatin stimulates VEGF expression in endothelial cells as well as the nature of its underlying mechanism.", 
    "52": "Simvastatin induced mRNA expression and protein secretion of VEGF in endothelial cells that were reversed by pretreatment with mevalonate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate but not by farnesylpyrophosphate. Adenovirus-mediated expression of the dominant-negative mutant of RhoA induced VEGF mRNA and protein. Simvastatin increased hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) protein level without changing its mRNA expression. Inhibition of RhoA had similar effects to simvastatin on VEGF expression. Inhibition of RhoA caused the translocation of HIF-1alpha to the nuclear fraction. Depletion of HIF-1alpha by RNA interference blocked simvastatin-induced VEGF mRNA expression.", 
    "53": "Simvastatin stimulates VEGF expression by RhoA downregulation and HIF-1alpha upregulation in endothelial cells. These data indicate a novel role for RhoA as a negative regulator of HIF-1alpha.", 
    "54": "Ruptures of macrophage-rich atherosclerotic plaques in the coronary arteries are the main reason for heart attack. Targeted therapeutic interventions with an inhibitory effect on the macrophages promise to be beneficial, but currently available drugs such as statins achieve event reductions of only 30%. Dose-limiting adverse effects in remote organs prohibit achieving higher drug levels known to have strong inhibitory effects on macrophages. Receptor-specific targeting using statin-loaded nanometer-sized triblock copolymer vesicles with targeting moieties might allow high-dose treatment for improved efficacy, while minimizing toxicity in other cells. Vesicle uptake by target cells but not other cell types and slow intracellular content release was observed. A major improvement in biologic efficacy was observed for polymer vesicles compared to free drug, whereas no increased cytotoxicity was observed in muscle cells. Such high-dose, targeted therapy of statins through cell-specific polymer vesicles allows novel treatment paradigms not only for atherosclerosis, but appears promising for a wide range of drugs and diseases.", 
    "55": "Although acute myocardial infarction (MI) and acute ischemic stroke share similarities, physicians need to recognize important differences in pathophysiology and how these differences affect acute treatment and prevention to provide optimal patient care. Potential causes of acute ischemic stroke are substantially more heterogeneous than for acute MI, and available acute therapies are substantially more limited. In acute ischemic stroke patients, diagnostic evaluation is paramount in determining eligibility for treatment with the only approved therapy, which must be administered within 3 hours after stroke onset. For patients having acute MI, reperfusion therapy by percutaneous intervention or thrombolytic drug therapy is well established. Because atherosclerosis is a common pathway to acute MI and acute ischemic stroke, modifying associated known risk factors is required for primary and secondary prevention of both conditions. Pharmacologic therapies recommended for secondary prevention include beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for MI, oral anticoagulants for stroke, and statins and antiplatelet agents for both conditions. Aspirin is recommended for preventing recurrence of both MI and stroke; agents inhibiting the adenosine diphosphate pathway of platelet activation, such as ticlopidine and clopidogrel, are also beneficial. Recent studies suggest the benefits associated with adding aspirin to clopidogrel do not outweigh the significant increase in bleeding risk. The synergistic effects of aspirin plus extended-release dipyridamole make this combination twice as effective than aspirin alone in secondary prevention of ischemic stroke. An ongoing study is directly comparing the combination of aspirin plus extended-release dipyridamole with clopidogrel for the prevention of recurrent stroke.", 
    "56": "The potential of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors ('statins') to reduce the incidence and/or progression of certain malignancies remains uncertain. Some investigators have concluded that statins have no effects on malignancies of any kind. However, results of several epidemiologic studies, including four recent prospective cohort studies, suggest that long-term statin therapy inhibits the progression of prostate cancer. We argue that the principal mechanism of any anticancer effects from statin use arises from prolonged lowering of circulating cholesterol. Evidence suggests that prostate cancer might be particularly sensitive to this intervention. Our hypothesis provides a perspective from which mechanistic studies of cholesterol-lowering drugs and cancer, in addition to prospective trials in patients, might be designed.",

Mutations in the PCSK9 gene have been shown to cause either hypo- or hypercholesterolemia. Here we investigated the effect of berberine, a natural plant extract, on PCSK9 expression in HepG2 cells.", 
    "58": "Berberine decreases PCSK9 mRNA and protein levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This was not due to increased degradation of PCSK9 mRNA but most likely due to a decreased transcription of the PCSK9 gene. We also show that a combination of berberine and mevastatin increases LDLR mRNA and protein levels, while suppressing the increase in PCSK9 mRNA levels caused by mevastatin alone.",

When the antacid was given 2 h after rosuvastatin, the antacid reduced the rosuvastatin AUC(0-t) by 22% (90% CI 0.68-0.90) and the C(max) by 16% (90% CI 0.70-1.01). The effect of repeated antacid administration was not studied and it cannot be discounted that this may have resulted in a stronger interaction than that observed here.",

Despite 77% of patients claiming to be satisfied with information on high cholesterol, only 26% were aware that heart attack was a possible consequence, and only 35% of patients thought they had achieved their cholesterol goals. Virtually all physicians (99%) claimed to inform patients of their cholesterol level, while 18% of patients reported that they were not informed. Although patients and physicians were selected at random, limitations of this survey relate typically to the reliability of physician and patient responses and the possibility that the survey population may not represent the overall population. A broad range of patients' backgrounds and a high response rate (83%) suggest these effects would be minimal in the patient population.",

    "71": "From 2001 to 2003, the annual prevalence of use of statins and ACE-inhibitors/ARBs ranged from 44 to 59%, with rates increasing each year. Being female, having certain cardiovascular conditions, and having a greater number of outpatient visits for diabetes increased the odds of receiving statins and ACE-inhibitors/ARBs. More frequent contact with the mental health system was associated with a lower likelihood of receipt of both medication classes; having a substance use disorder was associated with reduced use of statins. African-Americans were less likely than Caucasians to receive statins, but more likely to receive prescriptions for ACE-inhibitors/ARBs.", 
    "72": "Although the use of cardioprotective medications in individuals with Type 2 diabetes and SMI increased over the study period, a considerable proportion of patients remained inadequately managed despite their considerable cardiac risk. Further study should focus on observed racial variations and strategies to increase the capacity of mental health contacts to improve prescribing of these agents.", 
    "73": "We evaluated the efficacy and the safety of combining high doses of statins and ezetimibe in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (hFH) patients. Seventy patients with hFH, received 10 mg of ezetimibe, in addition to their current statin therapy and were followed up for twelve months. The co-administration of statins and ezetimibe improved total cholesterol (p<0.05), LDL-c(p<0.05), triglycerides (p<0.05) and apolipoprotein-B (p<0.05) in comparison to statin monotherapy. There were no changes in high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), apolipoprotein-A, lipoprotein (a), fibrinogen and C-reactive protein (CPR). In conclusion the combination of 10 mg of ezetimibe with high dose statin therapy is effective in hFH, offering a further reduction of LDL-c throughout the 12 months of follow up.",

In the pravastatin group the TC level reached its lowest level 24 h after operation, then gradually increased, however, still lower than that before operation, and recovered to the baseline level 28 days after operation; and the TG level reached the lowest level 24 h after operation (P < 0.05), and then gradually increased 3 d after operation (P > 0.05). The TC, TG, and LDL-C levels 7, 10, 14, and 28 d after operation of the pravastatin group were all significantly lower than those of the control group (all P < 0.05).

We asked whether the newly developed 3-hydroxymethyl-3-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, pitavastatin, could prevent steroid-induced ON in rabbits. We injected 65 adult male Japanese white rabbits once with 20 mg/kg of methylprednisolone acetate into the right gluteus medius muscle. The rabbits were divided into two groups; one group of 35 rabbits received pitavastatins (PS), and the other group of 30 rabbits received no prophylaxis (CTR). Hematological examinations were performed just before the steroid injection (0 weeks) and at 1 and 2 weeks after steroid injection; both the femora and the humeri were histologically examined 2 weeks postinjection. The incidence of histologic changes consistent with early ON in the PS group (13 of 35; 37%) was lower in comparison to the CTR group (21 of 30; 70%). The size of the bone marrow fat cells in the PS group (56.6 +/- 10 microm) was smaller than those in the CTR group (60 +/- 4 microm). The data suggest pitavastatin has the potential to lower the incidence of steroid-induced ON in rabbits.", 
    "79": "In 15-20% of cases, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presents before the age of 18 years, and such early-onset SLE seems to be particularly severe. SLE is an independent risk factor for premature atherosclerosis and death in young, premenopausal women with SLE, even after controlling for traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Children and adolescents with SLE are particularly susceptible to this long-term threat to their cardiovascular health because they have an increased disease severity and a lengthy disease burden. Factors that contribute to premature atherosclerosis include the inflammatory and immune abnormalities that are intrinsic to SLE, primary dyslipidemias, and the secondary effects of treatments such as corticosteroids. However, few rheumatologists provide appropriate preventive or management strategies for the increased atherosclerosis risk in this age-group. Screening should be performed on a regular basis, including evaluation of, and counseling for, traditional risk factors. Studies of treatment in pediatric patients are limited, and treatment strategies are often extrapolated from adult studies. Statins hold promise because they have both lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory effects. There have been few studies of the use of statins in adults or adolescents with SLE; however, trials are currently underway to address the safety and efficacy of statin use in pediatric SLE.", 
    "80": "Despite concerns about potential risks associated with the presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the environment, few toxicological data address the effects of these compounds. In aquatic systems, which often represent the final repository for PPCPs, increasing toxicological information regarding aquatic biota is improving our capacity to assess potential risks. However, responses of key biota, such as benthic invertebrates, have not been investigated as widely. In the present study, we examined the toxicity of four PPCPs -- the lipid regulator atorvastatin (ATO), the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ), the synthetic hormone 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE(2)), and the antimicrobial triclosan (TCS) -- to the midge Chironomus tentans and the freshwater amphipod Hyalella azteca in 10-d waterborne exposures. The toxicity of the four compounds varied between 0.20 and 47.3 mg/L (median lethal concentration), with a relative toxicity ranking of TCS > EE(2) > ATO > CBZ. Hyalella azteca was more sensitive than C. tentans to these compounds. The toxicity data were used in a hazard quotient approach to evaluate the risk posed by the four PPCPs to benthic invertebrates and other aquatic organisms. For each compound, a hazard quotient was calculated by dividing the lowest toxicity value by the highest exposure value found in the literature, to which an uncertainty factor was applied. With hazard quotients of 3.55 to 11.5, we conclude that potential risks exist toward benthic invertebrates for the toxicity of TCS and CBZ and that further investigations of these compounds are required to characterize more completely the risks to benthic organisms. In contrast, our data also indicate that considering the low concentrations currently detected in the environment, ATO and EE(2) pose negligible risks to benthic invertebrates.", 
    "81": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS). An approach to improve MS treatment is to identify a rational combination of new medications or existing therapies that impact different aspects of the disease process. Statins are effective in the treatment of MS animal models and are promising candidates for future treatment. Minocycline ameliorates clinical severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and exhibits several anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities. In this study, we tested whether the combination of these two drugs could produce beneficial effects in EAE mice immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte protein (MOG). Our findings show that combined treatment, compared to using the medications alone, resulted in a significant reduction in disease severity, in both the acute and chronic phases of the disease, along with attenuation of inflammation, demyelination and axonal loss. Stereological analysis revealed that the combined treatment significantly guarded against neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Moreover, a significant suppression of anti-MOG antibody production in animals treated with the two medications was found. In conclusion, our findings prove that this combination of drugs is neuroprotective and suppresses the severity of EAE. Furthermore, this pharmacological approach appears to be promising as a future therapeutic strategy to control MS.",

To address this issue, the University of California, Los Angeles, Cardiovascular Hospitalization Atherosclerosis Management Program was implemented in 1994. This hospital-based system focused on initiation of antiplatelet therapy, beta-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and statin therapy (irrespective of baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) in conjunction with diet and exercise counseling in patients hospitalized with coronary artery and other atherosclerotic vascular disease. Preprinted orders, critical pathways, discharge forms, physician and nursing education, pocket cards, patient educational material, and treatment utilization reports facilitated program implementation. Statin use at the time of discharge increased from 6% before initiation of the program to 86% after the Cardiovascular Hospitalization Atherosclerosis Management Program was implemented (P < 0.001). Improved use of aspirin, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was also observed. Importantly, in-hospital initiation of cardiovascular protective therapies had a dramatic effect on long-term treatment rates and patient compliance. The improved use of cardiovascular protective therapies was associated with a significant reduction in clinical events the first year after discharge: the death and nonfatal myocardial infarction rate decreased from 14.8% to 6.4% (odds ratio, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-0.59; P < 0.01). These improved treatment rates have been sustained over an 8-year period. Compared with conventional care, the Cardiovascular Hospitalization Atherosclerosis Management Program has been associated with a significant increase in treatment utilization of evidence-based medications, more patients achieving low-density lipoprotein cholesterol less than 100 mg/dL, and improved clinical outcomes in patients hospitalized for cardiovascular disease. Hospital-based atherosclerosis treatment systems are an important step to help eliminate the cardiovascular treatment gap and dramatically reduce the death and disability caused by atherosclerotic vascular disease.",

Furthermore, LDL-C of < or =100 mg/dL was achieved in fewer then 50% of acute coronary syndrome patients receiving statins at time of presentation. These data suggest that, in addition to previously documented underutilization of statins in clinical practice, there is also underdosing of this important class of drugs.", 
    "144": "Risk stratification is crucial in guiding the acute management of non-ST-segment elevation (NSTE) acute coronary syndromes (ACS). An early invasive strategy (catheterization/revascularization) in conjunction with aggressive antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy offers the most effective means of reducing ischemic complications in intermediate- and high-risk patients. In low-risk patients, stress testing serves to indicate whether a secondary prevention strategy or elective catheterization/percutaneous coronary intervention and GP IIb/IIIa inhibition is more appropriate. NSTE ACS also confers a long-term risk of recurrent cardiovascular events, regardless of whether initial management follows a medical or interventional approach. Combination aspirin and clopidogrel therapy is effective for secondary prevention across the spectrum of NSTE ACS patients, regardless of risk or initial treatment strategy (conservative or invasive). Long-term aspirin and clopidogrel therapy addresses the thrombotic component of atherothrombosis, while combined beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, and statin therapy is directed against the atheroma.",

During gallstone surgery, a liver biopsy was obtained and hepatic protein and mRNA expression of rate-limiting steps in cholesterol metabolism were assayed and related to serum lipoproteins. A marked induction of LDL receptors and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG) coenzyme A (CoA) reductase was positively related to the degree of cholesterol synthesis inhibition (ChSI). The activity, protein, and mRNA for ACAT2 were all reduced during ChSI, as was apoE mRNA.

With the efficient purification system by fibrin column, macroporous adsorption resin and high performance liquid chromatography, pravastatin was purified from the culture supernatant with an overall recovery of 45.06% and purity of 99.02%. It is the first report in the world to produce pravastatin by converting compactin using Streptomyces xanthochromogenes under optimized conditions, the conversion of compactin to pravastatin was higher than other methods reported. The recovery and purity were improved by the three-step purification of pravastatin from the culture supernatant.",

Although antitumor effects on a variety of cell types have been reported for statins, the effect of simvastatin (one of the statins) on human melanoma cell lines is not known. Here, we report antitumor effects of simvastatin on human melanoma cell lines. We treated human melanoma cell lines, A375M, G361, C8161, GAK, and MMAc with simvastatin in various concentrations for 1 to 3 days. To investigate the antitumor effect of simvastatin, we analyzed cell viability, morphologic changes, reversibility of inhibition by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate, apoptosis and the cell cycle. Simvastatin treatment reduced cell viability in all five melanoma cell lines. The different melanoma cell lines, however, displayed different sensitivities to simvastatin. The addition of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate to A375M and G361 cells in the presence of simvastatin completely restored the viability of cells, but the addition of farnesyl pyrophosphate did not. DNA fragmentation assay showed that simvastatin induced apoptosis in A375M and G361 cells. Simvastatin caused a G1 arrest in G361 and MMAc cells. Consistent with the cell cycle arrest, simvastatin caused an increase in the mRNA levels of p21 and p27 on G361 and MMAc cells. We conclude that simvastatin has an antitumor effect on human melanoma cells in vitro via apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. These results suggest that simvastatin may be an effective anticancer drug for malignant melanoma.",

Clinical arthritis activity was evaluated and radiographs, type II collagen antibody titers, cytokine/chemokine levels, and HDL function analysis were obtained. There was significant reduction in clinical severity scores in the high and medium dose D-4F + pravastatin groups compared to controls (p< or =0.0001). Reduction in erosive disease occurred in the medium/high dose combination groups compared to non-combination groups (p< or =0.01). Favorable changes in cytokines/chemokines were noted with treatment, and response to combination D-4F/pravastatin therapy was associated with improvement in HDL's anti-inflammatory properties. Combination D-4F/pravastatin significantly reduced clinical disease activity in CIA, and may have dual therapeutic potential in other autoimmune diseases with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.",

The most powerful class of lipid-lowering drugs available-statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors)--have additional actions, unrelated to cholesterol reduction, including anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. This study sought to determine if atorvastatin affects monocyte and lymphocyte activation in patients with unstable angina and mild primary hypercholesterolemia. Following a 4-weeks hypolipemiant-free baseline period, 22 patients-12 with unstable angina (UA) and 10 patients with stable coronary heart disease (SCHD) - were treated with Atorvastatin 20 mg/day. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-receptor (CD14) and HLA-DR expression on monocytes and beta-integrins (CD11b, 11c, 49d) on monocytes and lymphocytes were measured by flow cytometry before and after treatment with atorvastatin for 8 weeks. Monocyte CD11b, 11c and CD14 expression and T lymphocytes CD11b expression were significantly (p < 0.001) higher in UA patients before treatment when compared with that in SCHD patients. In patients with UA, they decreased markedly with atorvastatin treatment. The reduction in expression of adhesion molecule on monocytes and lymphocytes and the concentrations of CRP and sICAM-1 may crucially contribute to the clinical benefit of atorvastatin in coronary artery disease, independent of cholesterol lowering effects.", 
    "178": "The ability to modify the enzymatic processes involved in promoting atherosclerotic plaque disruption and to serially monitor atherosclerotic evolution could provide novel information in the management of patients with atherosclerosis. We studied the effects of a statin (atorvastatin) and its combination with an acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitor (avasimibe) on atherosclerotic regression and plaque stability as measured by matrix metalloproteinase 1 and 3 (MMP-1 and MMP-3) levels. Watanabe Heritable Hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits treated with atorvastatin alone experienced an attenuated increase in atherosclerotic burden versus controls as determined by MR imaging. The mean vessel wall area (VWA) prior to drug therapy was 5.57 +/- 0.01 mm2. The VWA increased to 6.71 +/- 0.03 and 7.16 +/- 0.03 mm2, respectively, in atorvastatin-treated and control groups (p < 0.0001 for both). The combination of atorvastatin and avasimibe induced a significant regression of the previously established atherosclerotic lesions, with the VWA decreasing to 4.54 +/- 0.04 mm2 (p = 0.009). Atorvastatin alone induced a nonsignificant reduction in the percent staining of MMP-1 in atherosclerotic lesions, but the combination treatment with avasimibe led to a significant reduction versus controls (p = 0.005). However, a reduction in MMP-3 staining was significant for rabbits treated with both atorvastatin alone (p = 0.007) and in combination with avasimibe (p = 0.04) versus controls. In this animal model, the addition of avasimibe to atorvastatin has beneficial effects on both atherosclerotic plaque regression and stabilization.", 
    "179": "The effects of treatment with pitavastatin on inflammatory and platelet activation markers and adiponectin in 117 patients with hyperlipidemia were investigated to determine whether pitavastatin may prevent the progression of atherosclerotic changes in hyperlipidemic patients. Adiponectin levels prior to pitavastatin treatment in hyperlipidemic patients with and without diabetes were lower than levels in normolipidemic controls. Both total cholesterol and the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased significantly after pitavastatin administration. Additionally, hyperlipidemic patients with or without type 2 diabetes exhibited a significant increase in adiponectin levels 6 months after pitavastatin treatment (diabetes: 3.52 +/- 0.80 vs. 4.52 +/- 0.71 microg/ml, p < 0.001; no diabetes: 3.48 +/- 0.71 vs. 4.23 +/- 0.82 microg/ml, p < 0.05). However, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, platelet-derived microparticle and soluble P-selectin did not exhibit any differences before or after pitavastatin administration. Levels of adiponectin significantly increased after pitavastatin administration in the group of lower soluble P-selectin (soluble P-selectin before pitavastatin treatment <200 ng/ml). These results suggest that pitavastatin possesses an adiponectin-increasing effect in patients with hyperlipidemia and this effect is influenced by intensive platelet activation.",

In addition, several studies have suggested that AS and atherosclerosis share a number of risk factors, such as hypercholesterolemia, elevated lipoprotein (a), smoking, hypertension and diabetes. These findings suggest that statin therapy could be beneficial in AS by its lipid-lowering and/or anti-inflammatory effects, as is the case in atherosclerosis. Although this concept has been supported by experimental work and by four retrospective clinical studies observing significantly slower rates of hemodynamic progression in statin-treated patients, a prospective randomized trial (Scottish Aortic Stenosis and Lipid Lowering Trial, Impact on Regression [SALTIRE]; 80mg of atorvastatin vs placebo) yielded a negative result. In contrast to the retrospective analyses, according to the study protocol, patients with hyperlipidemia had to be excluded in this trial. A recent prospective study (Rosuvastatin Affecting Aortic Valve Endothelium [RAAVE]) treating hypercholesteremic patients with rosuvastatin, found a significantly slower rate of progression in these patients compared with patients with normal cholesterol levels who were left untreated, suggesting that statin therapy may only be beneficial in patients with hyperlipidemia.

Athymic nude mice were divided into four groups (n = 10/group): vehicle administration plus PBS injection (control), simvastatin administration plus PBS injection (simvastatin), vehicle administration plus EPC transplantation (EPC), and simvastatin administration plus EPC transplantation (combination). The combination therapy had the greatest laser Doppler blood perfusion imager (LDPI) index and capillary density among the four groups. Importantly, this combination therapy significantly reduced apoptosis of ischemic skeletal muscle cells in part through downregulation of Bax and upregulation of Bcl-2 compared with the other groups. Moreover, the combination therapy exhibited the highest efficacy of increasing the ratio of phospho-Akt to Akt among the four groups. Taken together, the simvastatin and EPC combination therapy promotes powerful angiogenesis in hindlimb ischemia. The combination therapy not only inhibites apoptosis of ischemic skeletal muscle cells partially via downregulation of Bax and upregulation of Bcl-2, but also activates Akt phosphorylation significantly. These efficacies may be mediated by the angiogenic potency of simvastatin, EPCs, and by the beneficial effects of simvastatin on transplanted EPCs as well."
