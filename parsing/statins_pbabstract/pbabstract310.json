However, the implementation of this evidence into routine clinical practice is suboptimal. We hypothesised that the speciality of the attending physician (cardiologist or not) would affect the use of evidence-based strategies.", 
    "1": "Over a 3-month period (1st September to 30th November 1995), 3684 consecutive potential cases of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in 20 adjacent hospitals in the Yorkshire Region were identified from coronary care registers, clinical coding and biochemistry records of cardiac enzyme assay requests. There were 2153 consecutive cases of AMI identified, of which 1643 patients were alive at discharge. We compared the admission use of aspirin and thrombolysis, and the use of aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and statins at discharge between cardiologists and other physicians.", 
    "2": "AMI patients under the care of cardiologists are more likely to receive aspirin and thrombolysis on the day of their event and to be prescribed aspirin, beta-blockers and statins on discharge. After correction for contraindications to their use, the above findings were broadly confirmed.", 
    "3": "Cardiologists are more likely than general physicians to use evidence-based treatment strategies recognised to improve AMI patient outcome. It is likely that this will translate into a reduction of mortality or other hard endpoints in patient outcomes.",

Inheritance of a mutant allele of BRCA1 leads to increased risk of developing breast,and ovarian cancers. Lovastatin, as a potent inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase),is the main rate-limiting enzyme of endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. This study was to evaluate the effect and mechanism of combined application of BRCA1 and lovastatin on cell cycle distribution of MCF-7 cells.", 
    "5": "MCF-7 cells were transfected with expression vector pcDNA3-beta-HA-hsBRCA1 containing full-length BRCA1, and named MCF-7BRCA1 cells. The expression of BRCA1 gene was examined with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. After cultured with 8 micromol/L lovastatin, growth curve and MTT assay were used to determine cell proliferation capacity; the cell cycle distribution was measured with flow cytometry (FCM). Meanwhile,the protein expression of Cyclin D1 and retinoblastoma (Rb) were analyzed by Western blot analysis.", 
    "6": "The pcDNA3-beta-HA-hsBRCA1 plasmids were successfully transfected into MCF-7 cells and expressed stably. The growth curve and MTT assay results showed that cell proliferation capacity decreased in the cells cultured with lovastatin for 4 days. FCM showed that S phase, and G2/M phase of BRCA1-infected cells decreased,while G0/G1 phase increased after cultured with lovastatin, the cells were blocked in G0/G1 phase at 72 h post-treatment by lovastatin. Ectopic expression of BRCA1 leads to decrease of the Rb protein and Cyclin D1 protein. Overall data showed that the effects of Lovastatin were more obviously in MCF-7BRCA1 cells than MCF-7 cells.",

    "8": "The inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) by hypercholesterolemia may be mediated, in part, by interactions with caveolin-1 (Cav-1). Because of the facilitatory effects of statins on endothelial function and the adverse effects of rapamycin (RAPA) on plasma lipids, we compared the effects of simvastatin (SMV) and RAPA on endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and Cav-1 protein expression and phosphorylation in the aortas of apolipoprotein E (Apo-E) knockout (-/-) mice.", 
    "9": "Apo-E -/- mice (n = 38) fed a high-cholesterol diet were given SMV (100 mg/kg/day po), RAPA (3 mg/kg/day ip), or no treatment for 10 weeks. Blood was drawn for serum lipid analysis, and protein was extracted for Western immunoblotting. Selected aortic specimens from 2 animals in each group were examined by histology and immunohistochemistry. The data are expressed as the mean +/- SEM and compared by the Student t test and ANOVA. Significance was established as P < .05.", 
    "10": "Lipid levels at 10 weeks were similar in the 3 groups except for higher triglyceride levels in RAPA-treated animals. eNOS expression was highest in RAPA-treated mice, but the p-eNOS to eNOS protein expression ratio was significantly greater in the SMV treatment group compared to both RAPA and controls (P < .05). Both Cav-1 and p-Cav-1 expression was significantly lower in the SMV-treated animals (P < .05) compared to mice treated with RAPA.", 
    "11": "Although eNOS expression was greatest in the RAPA-treated mice, the expression of p-eNOS was similar in the RAPA- and SMV-treated animals. The increase in eNOS induced by RAPA and the inverse relationship between p-eNOS and Cav-1 protein expression observed with SMV treatment suggest different mechanisms for the regulation of aortic eNOS expression in Apo-E mice by these 2 agents.", 
    "12": "Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a potent profibrotic mediator, acts downstream and in concert with transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta to drive fibrogenesis. Significant upregulation of CTGF has been reported in fibrogenic diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and is partly responsible for associated excessive fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition, but no effective therapy exists for averting such fibrogeneic events. Simvastatin has reported putative antifibrotic actions in renal fibroblasts; this study explores such actions on human IPF-derived and normal lung fibroblasts and examines associated driving mechanisms. Simvastatin reduces basal CTGF gene and protein expression in all fibroblast lines, overriding TGF-beta induction through inhibition of the cholesterol synthesis pathway. Signaling pathways driving simvastatin's effects on CTGF/TGF-beta interaction were evaluated using transient reporter transfection of a CTGF promoter construct. Inhibition of CTGF promoter activity by simvastatin was most marked at 10 muM concentration, reducing activity by 76.2 and 51.8% over TGF-beta-stimulated cultures in IPF and normal fibroblasts, respectively. We also show that geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP), but not farnesylpyrophosphate, induces CTGF promoter activity following simvastatin inhibition by 55.3 and 31.1% over GGPP-negative cultures in IMR90 and IPF-derived fibroblasts, respectively, implicating small GTPase Rho involvement rather than Ras in these effects. Indeed, the specific Rho inhibitor C3 exotoxin significantly (P < 0.05) suppressed TGF-beta-induced CTGF promoter activity in transfected lung fibroblasts, a finding further supported by transfection of dominant-negative and constitutively active RhoA constructs, thus demonstrating that simvastatin through a Rho signaling mechanism in lung fibroblasts can modulate CTGF expression and interaction with TGF-beta.", 
    "13": "We describe the case of a 69-year-old man with a history of muscular symptoms dating back to his childhood; McArdle's disease (glycogen-storage disease V) was diagnosed following an episode of myositis in which a statin and physical exertion appear to have been precipitating factors. This case demonstrates that the ischaemic lactate-ammonia test still has a place in screening patients with symptoms suggestive of McArdle's disease and emphasizes the importance of carrying out glycogen phosphorylase histochemistry on the skeletal muscle biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. In patients who develop a raised plasma creatine kinase level or muscular symptoms during lipid-lowering therapy, the clinician should be alert to the possibility of an underlying myopathy.", 
    "14": "The Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) of the National Cholesterol Education Program issued an evidence-based set of guidelines on cholesterol management in 2001. Since the publication of ATP III, 5 major clinical trials of statin therapy with clinical end points have been published. These trials addressed issues that were not examined in previous clinical trials of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The present document reviews the results of these recent trials and assesses their implications for cholesterol management. Therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) remain an essential modality in clinical management. The trials confirm the benefit of cholesterol-lowering therapy in high-risk patients and support the ATP III treatment goal of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) <100 mg/dL. They support the inclusion of patients with diabetes in the high-risk category and confirm the benefits of LDL-lowering therapy in these patients. They further confirm that older persons benefit from therapeutic lowering of LDL-C. The major recommendations for modifications to footnote the ATP III treatment algorithm are the following. In high-risk persons, the recommended LDL-C goal is <100 mg/dL, but when risk is very high, an LDL-C goal of <70 mg/dL is a therapeutic option, ie, a reasonable clinical strategy, on the basis of available clinical trial evidence. This therapeutic option extends also to patients at very high risk who have a baseline LDL-C <100 mg/dL. Moreover, when a high-risk patient has high triglycerides or low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), consideration can be given to combining a fibrate or nicotinic acid with an LDL-lowering drug. For moderately high-risk persons (2+ risk factors and 10-year risk 10% to 20%), the recommended LDL-C goal is <130 mg/dL, but an LDL-C goal <100 mg/dL is a therapeutic option on the basis of recent trial evidence. The latter option extends also to moderately high-risk persons with a baseline LDL-C of 100 to 129 mg/dL. When LDL-lowering drug therapy is employed in high-risk or moderately high-risk persons, it is advised that intensity of therapy be sufficient to achieve at least a 30% to 40% reduction in LDL-C levels. Moreover, any person at high risk or moderately high risk who has lifestyle-related risk factors (eg, obesity, physical inactivity, elevated triglycerides, low HDL-C, or metabolic syndrome) is a candidate for TLC to modify these risk factors regardless of LDL-C level. Finally, for people in lower-risk categories, recent clinical trials do not modify the goals and cutpoints of therapy.", 
    "15": "The elderly (men aged 65 years and older and women aged 75 years and older) constitute a population at high absolute risk for the morbidity and mortality of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Statins have been shown in multiple large trials to reduce the burden of atherosclerotic disease in both middle-aged and elderly patients at elevated risk for coronary events, stroke, and death. We reviewed the major statin trials with particular emphasis on the significant number of elderly subjects. The impact of statins on the elderly, both positive and negative, is tabulated. In addition, we briefly discuss risk assessment in the elderly because selection of elderly patients for intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction with statins requires clinical judgment that must weigh the need for subclinical measures of atherosclerosis. We also consider negative aspects, risks, and costs of such therapy.", 
    "16": "The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial--Lipid Lowering Trial (ALLHAT-LLT) compared 40 mg/d of pravastatin with usual care among 10,355 men and women aged 55 years or older with stage 1 or 2 hypertension, at least one additional coronary heart disease risk factor, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels of 120 to 189 mg/dL. After a mean of 4.8 years of treatment and follow-up, the difference in total cholesterol between the two arms was 9.6%, whereas in a small, nonrandomized subsample, the LDL cholesterol differential was 16.7%. No differences were observed between the pravastatin and usual-care groups with respect to all-cause mortality, cardiovascular deaths, noncardiovascular deaths, and a composite endpoint of fatal coronary heart disease plus nonfatal myocardial infarction. Despite these null findings, the results of ALLHAT-LLT are not inconsistent with previous trials because of the very small lipid differences in the two arms. This indirectly supports the hypothesis that LDL cholesterol lowering is central to the cardiovascular benefits associated with statin therapy, with greater clinical impacts observed when there are greater differences between treatment and control arms. ALLHAT-LLT underscores the difficulty of conducting an open-label trial in an era of rapidly changing professional and public understanding of the possible benefits of lipid-lowering therapy and highlights the substantial gap between actual care in clinical practice and optimal care based on the best knowledge from randomized clinical trials.", 
    "17": "The Prospective Pravastatin Pooling (PPP) Project was a prospectively defined collaboration of three randomized, placebo-controlled, long-term, monotherapy (40 mg/d) trials of the lipid-lowering agent pravastatin. A pooled database of 19,768 participants with a mean of 5.2 years of follow-up was created, providing the investigators with over 100,000 patient-years of experience to address questions on total and cause-specific mortality, coronary incidence, stroke, and safety. One trial (West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study) was primary prevention and two (Cholesterol and Recurrent Events and Long-term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease) were secondary prevention. Pravastatin was shown to safely reduce all-cause mortality, fatal and nonfatal coronary events, and stroke events in patients with a broad range of patient characteristics.", 
    "18": "Although each revision of the US National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines has made increasing provision for the use of global risk assessment in determining need for and intensity of therapy, the guidelines' continued focus on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol may result in inadequate or no treatment for individuals at high risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) who do not have substantially elevated LDL cholesterol. However, recent clinical trial evidence has shown that high-risk patients benefit from lipid-regulating therapy regardless of LDL cholesterol level. In the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial--Lipid Lowering Arm, high-risk hypertensive patients had reductions in clinical events despite not having substantially elevated LDL cholesterol at baseline. These results suggest that all hypertensive patients with additional risk factors should receive lipid-regulating statin therapy to prevent CAD events.", 
    "19": "Cardiovascular disease and its clinical sequelae remain the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in many regions of the world. Dyslipidemia is a critical risk factor to intercept in both the primary and secondary prevention of acute cardiovascular events. The prospective, placebo-controlled clinical trials conducted with statins over the course of the past 15 years have conclusively demonstrated that these drugs significantly reduce risk for fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, unstable angina, and frequency of myocardial ischemia, as well as cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Of considerable interest is the fact that, even under the exquisitely controlled circumstances of a clinical trial, endpoint reductions in these trials typically occur in the range of 20% to 35%. Understandably, much attention is now being focused on deriving the pharmacologic means by which to further increase the magnitude of endpoint reduction. Epidemiologic investigation has demonstrated that the relationship between cholesterol and risk for atherosclerotic disease is a continuous one. Consequently, it is reasonable to assume that more aggressive reductions of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol might result in even greater reductions of cardiovascular event rates and atheromatous plaque progression than heretofore observed. Two recent clinical trials, Reversal of Atherosclerosis with Aggressive Lipid Lowering (REVERSAL) and Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy (PROVE IT), prospectively tested and confirmed the validity of more aggressive LDL cholesterol lowering in high-risk patients with established coronary artery disease.", 
    "20": "Lipoprotein disorders in HIV-positive patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) are becoming a major concern in HIV treatment, since there is growing evidence for an association between HAART-induced hyperlipidemia and increased cardiovascular risk. Yet relatively few data are available on the possible interactions of HAART and treatment with statins.", 
    "21": "In this prospective study, 25 HIV-positive, treatment-experienced patients (five female, 20 male, all Caucasian) were treated with either fluvastatin or pravastatin. Total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, and serum triglycerides were determined at regular intervals, as well as therapeutic drug monitoring to assess possible drug interactions.", 
    "22": "In 13 pravastatin-treated patients, a decrease in total cholesterol levels (from 7.12 mmol/l to 6.29 mmol/l) after 12 weeks of therapy was seen. In 12 patients treated with fluvastatin, a permanent reduction of total cholesterol (from 6.46 mmol/l to 5.31 mmol/l) after 12 weeks was observed. The reduction of LDL levels was 30.2% in the fluvastatin group and 14.4% in the pravastatin group. In eight patients receiving an indinavir-containing HAART, indinavir plasma levels were not significantly influenced. No effect on triglycerides or HDL was observed.", 
    "23": "Fluvastatin and pravastatin are efficient in lowering total and LDL cholesterol levels in HIV-positive patients receiving HAART. Furthermore, no influence on indinavir plasma levels could be observed. Therefore, both compounds seem to be a viable treatment option in HAART-induced hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "24": "The actin cytoskeleton has been increasingly implicated in endocytic events that are involved in the reabsorption of filtered protein by the proximal tubule. Isoprenylated small G proteins have emerged as key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. This study examines the role of isoprenoid intermediates in organization of the cytoskeleton, and the effect of modification of the cytoskeleton on albumin endocytosis.", 
    "25": "The effect of lovastatin on cytoskeleton morphology of opossum kidney cells (OK cells) was determined by staining with fluorescent isothiocyanate (FITC)-phalloidin followed by examination using confocal microscopy. Quantitative effects on albumin binding and uptake were determined using a well-established method.", 
    "26": "Inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis by lovastatin led to morphological disruption of the cytoskeleton with a concentration-dependent decrease in albumin uptake into OK cells. Addition of mevalonate, but not cholesterol, ameliorated the effects of lovastatin on the cytoskeleton and albumin uptake. Selective inhibition of isoprenoid intermediates with a farnesyltransferase inhibitor suggests that geranylgeranylated proteins mediate cytoskeleton organization.", 
    "27": "These results confirm the importance of cytoskeleton integrity in albumin endocytosis in renal proximal tubules. While the present data suggest that synthesis of isoprenoids via the mevalonate pathway is a critical step in maintenance of the cytoskeleton, the role of individual small G proteins in control of the cytoskeleton and other endocytic events is yet to be defined.", 
    "28": "Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors, are frequently used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. The present study aimed to examine the involvement of organic anion transporters in the efflux transport of pravastatin and pitavastatin across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Transport studies using cDNA-transfected cells revealed that these statins are substrates of multispecific organic anion transporters expressed at the BBB (rOat3:Slc22a8 and rOatp2:Slco1a4). The efflux of these statins across the BBB was characterized using the brain efflux index method. The efflux clearance of pitavastatin across the BBB, obtained from the elimination rate constant and the distribution volume in the brain, was greater than that of pravastatin (364 versus 59 microl/min/g brain). The efflux of pravastatin and pitavastatin was saturable (apparent Km values: 18 and 5 muM, respectively) and inhibited by probenecid but unaffected by tetraethylammonium. Furthermore, an inhibitor of the efflux pathway for hydrophilic organic anions across the BBB (p-aminohippurate), and inhibitors of the efflux pathway for amphipathic organic anions (taurocholate and digoxin) inhibited the efflux of both statins. The degree of inhibition by p-aminohippurate was similar and partial for the efflux of pravastatin and pitavastatin. Taurocholate and digoxin completely inhibited the efflux of pitavastatin, whereas their effect was partial for the efflux of pravastatin. The results of the present study suggest the involvement of multiple transporters, including rOat3 and rOatp2, in the efflux transport of pravastatin and pitavastatin across the BBB, each making a different contribution.", 
    "29": "We investigated inflammatory biomarkers in plasma and in circulating monocytes obtained from patients with Crohn's disease and healthy individuals. Additionally, we assessed the effects of atorvastatin, 10 microM, ex vivo on monocytes cultured for 18 hours from the same subjects. Plasma and blood monocytes from eight patients with active Crohn's disease and eight healthy individuals were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent and electrophoretic mobility assays. Patients with active Crohn's disease had increased plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (7.7-fold;p < 0.05), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 (1.3-fold; p < 0.05), and oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) (1.2-fold; p < 0.05). Monocytes from patients with Crohn's disease showed enhanced secretion of MCP-1 (4.8-fold; p < 0.05) and a markedly suppressed secretion of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) (93%; p < 0.001). Transcriptional activation of nuclear factor-kappaB did not differ between the groups. Treating monocytes with atorvastatin resulted in the suppression of MCP-1 (42%; p < 0.05) and TNF-alpha (45%; p < 0.05) secretion. These results show increased levels of certain proinflammatory biomarkers, including oxLDL, in plasma and indicate that peripheral blood monocytes in active Crohn's disease are sensitized to chemotaxis. Treatment with atorvastatin may be a potential strategy to reduce oxLDL and inhibit monocyte migration to inflamed tissue, thus attenuating the inflammatory response.", 
    "30": "Cyclosporine (INN, ciclosporin) increases the systemic exposure of all statins. Therefore rosuvastatin pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed in an open-label trial involving stable heart transplant recipients (> or =6 months after transplant) on an antirejection regimen including cyclosporine. Rosuvastatin has been shown to be a substrate for the human liver transporter organic anion transporting polypeptide C (OATP-C). Inhibition of this transporter could increase plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin. Therefore the effect of cyclosporine on rosuvastatin uptake by cells expressing OATP-C was also examined.", 
    "31": "Ten subjects were assessed while taking 10 mg rosuvastatin for 10 days; 5 of these were then assessed while taking 20 mg rosuvastatin for 10 days. Rosuvastatin steady-state area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 24 hours [AUC(0-24)] and maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) were compared with values in controls (historical data from 21 healthy volunteers taking 10 mg rosuvastatin). Rosuvastatin uptake by OATP-C-transfected Xenopus oocytes was also studied by use of radiolabeled rosuvastatin with and without cyclosporine.", 
    "32": "In transplant recipients taking 10 mg rosuvastatin, geometric mean values and percent coefficient of variation for steady-state AUC(0-24) and Cmax were 284 ng. h/mL (31.3%) and 48.7 ng/mL (47.2%), respectively. In controls, these values were 40.1 ng. h/mL (39.4%) and 4.58 ng/mL (46.9%), respectively. Compared with control values, AUC(0-24) and Cmax were increased 7.1-fold and 10.6-fold, respectively, in transplant recipients. In transplant recipients taking 20 mg rosuvastatin, these parameters increased less than dose-proportionally. Rosuvastatin had no effect on cyclosporine blood concentrations. The in vitro results demonstrate that rosuvastatin is a good substrate for OATP-C-mediated hepatic uptake (association constant, 8.5 +/- 1.1 micromol/L) and that cyclosporine is an effective inhibitor of this process (50% inhibition constant, 2.2 +/- 0.4 micromol/L when the rosuvastatin concentration was 5 micromol/L).", 
    "33": "Rosuvastatin exposure was significantly increased in transplant recipients on an antirejection regimen including cyclosporine. Cyclosporine inhibition of OATP-C-mediated rosuvastatin hepatic uptake may be the mechanism of the drug-drug interaction. Coadministration of rosuvastatin with cyclosporine needs to be undertaken with caution.", 
    "34": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are lipid-lowering drugs that also exert pleiotropic vasculoprotective effects via activation of the endothelial NO synthesis. NO induces S-nitrosylation of target proteins. S-Nitrosylation of the antioxidant enzyme thioredoxin was recently shown to enhance its activity, thereby reducing intracellular reactive oxygen species. Therefore, we investigated whether statins may exert an antioxidant activity in endothelial cells via S-nitrosylation of thioredoxin.", 
    "35": "Statins dose- and time-dependently increased the overall level of S-nitrosylated proteins in endothelial cells (atorvastatin 0.1 micromol/L, 206+/-30% increase; simvastatin 1 micromol/L, 214+/-19% increase; mevastatin 1 micromol/L, 191+/-10% increase). The increased S-nitrosylation was blocked by an NO-synthase inhibitor and mevalonate. Moreover, S-nitrosylation of thioredoxin was also significantly augmented after atorvastatin treatment. The atorvastatin-mediated increase in S-nitrosylation was associated with an enhanced enzymatic activity of thioredoxin (atorvastatin, 157+/-9% increase). This resulted in a significant reduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species within the endothelial cells. In contrast, in endothelial cells overexpressing a thioredoxin construct in which the S-nitrosylation acceptor amino acid cysteine 69 was replaced by serine [TRX(C69S)], atorvastatin did not activate the redox-regulatory activity of thioredoxin. Moreover, overexpression of the non-nitrosylatable thioredoxin TRX(C69S) abolished atorvastatin-mediated reduction of reactive oxygen species.", 
    "36": "Here, we demonstrate a novel antioxidant mechanism by which statins reduce reactive oxygen species in endothelial cells. Statin-mediated S-nitrosylation of thioredoxin enhanced the enzymatic activity of thioredoxin, resulting in a significant reduction in intracellular reactive oxygen species.", 
    "37": "Statins have anti-inflammatory properties that are independent of their lipid-lowering abilities. We hypothesized that statin therapy before the onset of an acute bacterial infection may have a protective effect against severe sepsis. The aim of this study was to determine whether patients treated with statins develop severe sepsis less frequently.", 
    "38": "In this prospective observational cohort study, consecutive patients admitted with presumed or documented acute bacterial infection were enrolled. The primary outcomes were the rate of severe sepsis and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Of the 361 patients enrolled, 82 (22.7%) were treated with statins before their admission. Both groups had a similar severity of illness on admission. Severe sepsis developed in 19% of patients in the no-statin group and in only 2.4% of the statin group (P<0.001). Statin treatment was associated with a relative risk of developing severe sepsis of 0.13 (95% CI, 0.03 to 0.52) and an absolute risk reduction of 16.6%. The overall ICU admission rate was 10.2% (37/361): 12.2% of the no-statin group required ICU admission, whereas in the statin group only 3.7% were admitted to the ICU (P=0.025), reflecting a relative risk of ICU admission of 0.30 (95% CI, 0.1 to 0.95).", 
    "39": "Prior therapy with statins may be associated with a reduced rate of severe sepsis and ICU admission. If supported by prospective controlled trials, statins may have a role in the primary prevention of sepsis.", 
    "40": "Besides their cholesterol-lowering effect, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) show antiproliferative behaviour, which has been suggested as a promising anticancer strategy. However, the signalling cascades leading to statin-induced death of cancer cells are poorly characterized. Here we show that statins activate the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis in rhabdomyosarcoma RD cells via translocation of Bax from the cytosol to mitochondria. The prototypical representative of statins, simvastatin, induced consecutive activation of caspase 9 and 3 in a concentration-dependent manner. The permeability transition pore inhibitor bongkrekic acid was capable of completely preventing simvastatin-induced caspase 9 and 3 activity, corroborating the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis as the sole mechanism of statin action. Alternative pathways via death receptors, that is, caspase 8 or calpain activation, were not triggered by simvastatin. Simvastatin-treated RD cells could be completely rescued from apoptosis by the co-application of mevalonic acid, indicating that deprivation of cholesterol precursors is essential for statin-induced apoptosis. However, pretreatment with subthreshold concentrations of simvastatin was sufficient to augment doxorubicin toxicity via the mitochondrial apoptotic machinery. Moreover, the presence of doxorubicin increased the potency of simvastatin to trigger caspase activation. Taken together, these data highlight the therapeutic anticancer potential of statins and their additivity and mutual sensitization, in combination with doxorubicin in human rhabdomyosarcoma cells.", 
    "41": "The risk of coronary heart disease is increased for any given low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level in patients with high levels of triglycerides because some triglyceride-rich lipoproteins are atherogenic. This paper reports the results of a pilot clinical trial aimed to evaluate a novel triglyceride-lowering drug in combination with pravastatin to treat combined hyperlipidemia. Twenty-six patients with type 2b hyperlipoproteinemia were randomized to receive pravastatin 40 mg/day or pravastatin 40 mg/day plus piperazine-sultosilate 1000 mg/day for 12 weeks if their cholesterol levels, but not triglyceride levels, had responded to therapeutic lifestyle changes and treatment with 40 mg/day of pravastatin. Concentrations of triglycerides, cholesterol and apolipoproteins A and B were measured in duplicate before and after the intervention. There were no significant differences between groups in the change from baseline in the concentration of serum triglycerides. Conversely, significant differences were found for LDL cholesterol, which increased slightly with pravastatin alone but decreased with the combination (12.605+/-22.777% vs. -6.396+/-13.157%, respectively; p=0.022). Apolipoprotein-B levels increased with pravastatin alone but remained stable with the combined treatment (10.464+/-8.446% vs. 0.767+/-12.335%; P=0.028). The increase in the pravastatin group was significant. Although sultosilate was not efficacious in reducing triglycerides, it helped to decrease the concentration of small, dense, atherogenic LDL particles that are less receptor-sensitive and which could accumulate during long-term statin therapy in patients with high levels of triglycerides.", 
    "42": "The intensive interactions of myeloma cells (multiple myeloma, MM) with microenvironmental components of the bone marrow contribute significantly to their proliferation and survival. It has been shown that these signals confer drug resistance, delineating their circumvention as a primary objective in disease treatment. This study was designed to assess the effect of some major extracellular factors on the previously established anti-neoplastic response of myeloma cells to simvastatin (Sim).", 
    "43": "RPMI8226, U266, and ARH77 seeded in culture plates precoated with fibronectin (FN)/agarose/none were treated with Sim, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), interleukin-6 (IL-6) or combinations for 5 d. Then we assessed cell morphology, viability (WST1), cell cycle (propidium iodide, PI, staining and flow cytometric analysis), total cell count, and cell death (trypan blue exclusion), and DNA fragmentation.", 
    "44": "Reduced viability was demonstrated with Sim in all treated cell lines with and without co-administration of IGF-I or IL-6 (P < 0.05). The extent of inhibition did not vary between Sim only and combinations (NS). FN did not influence cell response to Sim alone or combined with IL-6/IGF-I (NS). We conclude that IL-6, IGF-I, and FN do not afford myeloma cell lines protection from Sim modulation.", 
    "45": "Studies of metabolism of the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (APP) have focused much recent attention on the biology of juxta- and intra-membranous proteases. Release or 'shedding' of the large APP ectodomain can occur via one of two competing pathways, the alpha- and beta-secretase pathways, that are distinguished both by subcellular site of proteolysis and by site of cleavage within APP. The alpha-secretase pathway cleaves within the amyloidogenic Abeta domain of APP, precluding the formation of toxic amyloid aggregates. The relative utilization of the alpha- and beta-secretase pathways is controlled by the activation of certain protein phosphorylation signal transduction pathways including protein kinase C (PKC) and extracellular signal regulated protein kinase [ERK/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase)], although the relevant substrates for phosphorylation remain obscure. Because of their apparent ability to decrease the risk for Alzheimer disease, the effects of statins (HMG CoA reductase inhibitors) on APP metabolism were studied. Statin treatment induced an APP processing phenocopy of PKC or ERK activation, raising the possibility that statin effects on APP processing might involve protein phosphorylation. In cultured neuroblastoma cells transfected with human Swedish mutant APP, atorvastatin stimulated the release of alpha-secretase-released, soluble APP (sAPPalpha). However, statin-induced stimulation of sAPPalpha release was not antagonized by inhibitors of either PKC or ERK, or by the co-expression of a dominant negative isoform of ERK (dnERK), indicating that PKC and ERK do not play key roles in mediating the effect of atorvastatin on sAPPalpha secretion. These results suggest that statins may regulate alpha-secretase activity either by altering the biophysical properties of plasma membranes or by modulating the function of as-yet unidentified protein kinases that respond to either cholesterol or to some intermediate in the cholesterol metabolic pathway. A 'phospho-proteomic' analysis of N2a cells with and without statin treatment was performed, revealing changes in the phosphorylation state of several protein kinases plausibly related to APP processing. A systematic evaluation of the possible role of these protein kinases in statin-regulated APP ectodomain shedding is underway.", 
    "46": "The five-carbon metabolic intermediate isopentenyl diphosphate constitutes the basic building block for the biosynthesis of all isoprenoids in all forms of life. Two distinct pathways lead from amphibolic intermediates to isopentenyl diphosphate. The Gram-positive cocci and certain other pathogenic bacteria employ exclusively the mevalonate pathway, a set of six enzyme-catalyzed reactions that convert 3 mol of acetyl-CoA to 1 mol each of carbon dioxide and isopentenyl diphosphate. The survival of the Gram-positive cocci requires a fully functional set of mevalonate pathway enzymes. These enzymes therefore represent potential targets of inhibitors that might be employed as antibiotics directed against multidrug-resistant strains of certain bacterial pathogens. A rapid throughput, bioreactor-based assay to assess the effects of potential inhibitors on several enzymes simultaneously should prove useful for the survey of candidate inhibitors. To approach this goal, and as a proof of concept, we employed enzymes from the Gram-positive pathogen Enterococcus faecalis. Purified recombinant enzymes that catalyze the first three reactions of the mevalonate pathway were immobilized in two kinds of continuous flow enzyme bioreactors: a classical hollow fiber bioreactor and an immobilized plug flow bioreactor that exploited a novel method of enzyme immobilization. Both bioreactor types employed recombinant acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase, HMG-CoA synthase, and HMG-CoA reductase from E. faecalis to convert acetyl-CoA to mevalonate, the central intermediate of the mevalonate pathway. Reactor performance was monitored continuously by spectrophotometric measurement of the concentration of NADPH in the reactor effluent. Additional potential applications of an Ni(++) affinity support bioreactor include using recombinant enzymes from extremophiles for biosynthetic applications. Finally, linking a Ni(++) affinity support bioreactor to an HPLC-mass spectrometer would provide an experimental and pedagogical tool for study of metabolite flux and pool sizes of intermediates to model regulation in intact cells.", 
    "47": "In this randomized, 2-way crossover study, the potential for interaction was investigated between atorvastatin and ximelagatran, an oral direct thrombin inhibitor. Healthy female and male volunteers (n = 16) received atorvastatin 40 mg as a single oral dose and, in a separate study period, ximelagatran 36 mg twice daily for 5 days plus a 40-mg oral dose of atorvastatin on the morning of day 4. In the 15 subjects completing the study, no pharmacokinetic interaction was detected between atorvastatin and ximelagatran for all parameters investigated, including melagatran (the active form of ximelagatran) area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration, atorvastatin acid AUC, and AUC of active 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors. Atorvastatin did not alter the melagatran-induced prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time, and both drugs were well tolerated when administered in combination. In conclusion, no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction between atorvastatin and ximelagatran was observed in this study.", 
    "48": "Grapefruit juice can modify the pharmacokinetic parameters of many drugs, in particular simvastatin, an orally active cholesterol-lowering agent. The exact components in grapefruit juice responsible for drug interactions are not perfectly known. However, it seems that bergamottin, a furocoumarin derivative, is one of the main active components within grapefruit juice. The objective of this paper was to quantify and to characterize in-vitro the inhibitory effect of bergamottin on simvastatin metabolism by using rat and human liver microsomes. In rat liver microsomes, the incubation conditions (+/-NADPH) of bergamottin were found to influence its inhibiting capacity. In co-incubation with simvastatin, the Ki value (the equilibrium dissociation constant for the enzyme-inhibitor complex) was higher (Ki = 174 +/- 36 microM) than in pre-incubation (Ki = 45 +/- 6 microM and 4 +/- 2 microM, without and with NADPH, respectively). It thus seems that the pre-incubation of bergamottin (in particular with NADPH) increases its inhibiting capacity on simvastatin metabolism. Bergamottin metabolism study in rat liver microsomes showed the formation of two metabolites that were CYP-450 dependent. In contrast, in human liver microsomes, the incubation conditions of bergamottin did not influence its inhibiting capacity of simvastatin metabolism (Ki = 34 +/- 5 microM, Ki = 22 +/- 5 microM, Ki = 27 +/- 11 microM in coincubation and pre-incubation without and with NADPH, respectively). In rat and man, bergamottin was found to be a mixed-type inhibitor of simvastatin hepatic metabolism. However, in rat, bergamottin was partially a mechanism-based inhibitor by involvement of either bergamottin alone or one of its metabolites. The results highlight the importance of validating in-vitro models to help verify the suitability of the in-vitro model for predicting the nature and degree of metabolic drug interactions.", 
    "49": "Adverse drug reactions are common; they are responsible for a number of debilitating side effects and are a significant cause of death following drug therapy. It is now clear that a significant proportion of these adverse drug reactions, as well as therapeutic failures, are caused by genetic polymorphism, genetically based interindividual differences in drug absorption, disposition, metabolism, or excretion. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are generally very well tolerated and easy to administer with good patient acceptance. There are only two uncommon but potentially serious adverse effects related to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor therapy: hepatotoxicity and myopathy. The occurrence of lethal rhabdomyolysis in patients treated with cerivastatin has prompted concern on the part of physicians and patients regarding the tolerability of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Apart from pravastatin and rosuvastatin, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are metabolized by the phase I cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily of drug metabolizing enzymes. The best-characterized pharmacogenetic polymorphisms are those within this enzyme family. One of these enzymes, CYP2D6, plays an important role in the metabolism of simvastatin. It has been shown that the cholesterol-lowering effect as well as the efficacy and tolerability of simvastatin is influenced by CYP2D6 genetic polymorphism. Because the different HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors differ, with respect to the degree of metabolism by the different CYP enzymes, genotyping may help to select the appropriate HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and the optimal dosage during the start of the treatment and will allow for more efficient individual therapy. A detailed knowledge of the genetic basis of individual drug response is potentially of major clinical and economic importance.",

In the LIPS trial, patients with normal-to-moderate hypercholesterolaemia who had undergone a first PCI were randomised to receive either fluvastatin 40 mg twice-daily plus dietary counselling or dietary counselling alone. A Markov model was used to estimate the incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and life year gained (LYG). Costs were based on prices and reimbursed charges, utility data were drawn from literature. Monte Carlo simulations and multivariate analysis were used to assess uncertainty.",

Medical therapy consists of vasodilators. Surgery may be appropriate for patients with symptoms, left ventricular dilatation or diminished left ventricle systolic function. Aortic stenosis (AS) can be evaluated with the same modalities as AR. There is evidence that statin therapy may slow the progression of AS. Contrary to conventional wisdom, vasodilators are safe and effective in certain patients. Surgical valve replacement is performed for symptoms and in certain asymptomatic patients.", 
    "55": "Individuals expressing the polymorphic CYP3A5 enzyme might show a more than average efficiency in the metabolism of lovastatin, simvastatin and atorvastatin. We studied whether the expression of CYP3A5 is associated with an impaired lipid-lowering response to statins in 69 Caucasian patients. Lovastatin, simvastatin and atorvastatin were significantly less effective in CYP3A5 expressors than in non-expressors. The mean serum total cholesterol concentration at 1 year was 23% higher (P = 0.0014) and the mean serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was 24% higher (P = 0.036) in subjects possessing the CYP3A5*1 allele (CYP3A5 expressors, n = 7) than in subjects homozygous for the CYP3A5*3 allele (non-expressors, n = 39). The mean percentage reduction in serum total cholesterol from baseline was significantly smaller in CYP3A5 expressors than in non-expressors (17% versus 31%, P = 0.026). No association between hypolipidemic efficacy and CYP3A5 polymorphism was observed among 23 subjects taking statins that are not dependent on CYP3A5 (fluvastatin, pravastatin). These findings suggest that CYP3A5 may be a genetic determinant of interindividual differences in response to certain statins.", 
    "56": "A series of studies was conducted to determine the best animal model for human CYP and UGT activities. The investigation focused primarily on the interactions occurring in the CYP- or UGT-mediated metabolism of pitavastatin, and involved in vitro and in vivo experiments. We found that the best animal models for human CYP-mediated hydroxylation and UGT-mediated lactonization of pitavastatin were rats and dogs, respectively. In addition, a large difference in the metabolic properties of pitavastatin was found between monkeys and humans. In the presence of gemfibrozil, the CYP- or UGT-mediated metabolism of pitavastatin was inhibited in vitro. However, gemfibrozil treatment had no inhibitory effect on the AUC of pitavastatin and its lactone form in rats and dogs. We conclude that the plasma level of pitavastatin would not be increased by co-administration of gemfibrozil in humans.", 
    "57": "The role of maternal toxicity in lovastatin-induced developmental toxicity in rats was examined in a series of studies. The first study administered lovastatin at 100, 200, 400, or 800 mg/kg/day (mkd) orally to mated rats from Gestation Day (GD) 6 through 20. Maternal toxicity was observed as transient dose-related body weight losses at the initiation of dosing; there were also deaths and/or morbidity at 400 and 800 mkd. These toxicities occurred in conjunction with forestomach lesions. Mean fetal weights were decreased in all groups (-5 to -16%), and the incidence of skeletal malformations, variations, and incomplete ossifications was increased. The 2 highest doses produced the most severe maternal and developmental effects. Using the same dosages, the second study avoided gestational maternal weight losses and morbidity by starting treatment 14 days before mating with dosing continued to GD 20. There were transient dose-related body weight losses after the start of dosing and deaths in the 400- and 800-mkd groups; however, there was no evidence of maternal toxicity during gestation. Developmental toxicity was evident only as slight, but generally significant (p< or =0.05) decreases in mean fetal weights in groups given > or =200 mkd (-2 to -5%). Significantly, no skeletal abnormalities were observed. A third study administered the pharmacologically active metabolite of lovastatin subcutaneously at dose levels that matched oral maternal drug exposures. In the high-dose group, maternal weight gain and mean fetal weight were slightly decreased but there were no treatment-related skeletal abnormalities. Finally, a series of toxicokinetic studies assessed whether the 2 different developmental toxicity profiles were due to differences in drug exposure between the developmentally toxic and non-toxic dosing regimes. The data showed that groups with no skeletal abnormalities had maternal and embryonic/fetal drug concentrations similar to or even greater than the groups with fetal abnormalities. These results indicate that fetal skeletal abnormalities observed at lovastatin dose levels > or =100 mkd are not due to a direct teratogenic effect, but are the result of excessive maternal toxicity, which most likely involves a nutritional deficiency associated with forestomach lesions and reduced maternal food intake.", 
    "58": "Alpha-synuclein contributes to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), but its precise role in the disorder and its normal function remain poorly understood. Consistent with a presumed role in neurotransmitter release and its prominent deposition in the dystrophic neurites of PD, alpha-synuclein localizes almost exclusively to the nerve terminal. In brain extracts, however, alpha-synuclein behaves as a soluble, monomeric protein. Using a binding assay to characterize the association of alpha-synuclein with cell membranes, we find that alpha-synuclein binds saturably and with high affinity to characteristic intracellular structures that double label for components of lipid rafts. Biochemical analysis demonstrates the interaction of alpha-synuclein with detergent-resistant membranes and reveals a shift in electrophoretic mobility of the raft-associated protein. In addition, the A30P mutation associated with PD disrupts the interaction of alpha-synuclein with lipid rafts. Furthermore, we find that both the A30P mutation and raft disruption redistribute alpha-synuclein away from synapses, indicating an important role for raft association in the normal function of alpha-synuclein and its role in the pathogenesis of PD.",

Studies have demonstrated elevated CD40L levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia and ACS, and elevated sCD40L levels have been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events. Statins, glitazones, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, and clopidogrel have been demonstrated to effectively reduce CD40L levels both in vitro and in vivo.

    "64": "Chronic renal failure (CRF) is associated with increased risk of arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease and profound alteration of plasma lipid profile. Uremic dyslipidemia is marked by increased plasma concentration of ApoB-containing lipoproteins and impaired high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-mediated reverse cholesterol transport. These abnormalities are, in part, due to acquired LCAT deficiency and upregulation of hepatic acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT). ACAT catalyzes intracellular esterification of cholesterol, thereby promoting hepatic production of ApoB-containing lipoproteins and constraining HDL-mediated cholesterol uptake in the peripheral tissues. In view of the above considerations, we tested the hypothesis that pharmacological inhibition of ACAT may ameliorate CRF-induced dyslipidemia. 5/6 Nephrectomized rats were treated with either ACAT inhibitor IC-976 (30 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) or placebo for 6 wk. Sham-operated rats served as controls. Key cholesterol-regulating enzymes, plasma lipids, and creatinine clearance were measured. The untreated CRF rats exhibited increased plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very LDL (VLDL) cholesterol, unchanged plasma HDL cholesterol, elevated total cholesterol-to-HDL cholesterol ratio, reduced liver microsomal free cholesterol, and diminished creatinine clearance. This was accompanied by reduced plasma LCAT, increased hepatic ACAT-2 mRNA, ACAT-2 protein and ACAT activity, and unchanged hepatic HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase. ACAT inhibitor raised plasma HDL cholesterol, lowered LDL and VLDL cholesterol, and normalized total cholesterol-to-HDL cholesterol ratio without changing total cholesterol concentration (hence, a shift from ApoB-containing lipoproteins to HDL). This was accompanied by normalizations of hepatic ACAT activity and plasma LCAT. In conclusion, inhibition of ACAT reversed LCAT deficiency and improved plasma HDL level in CRF rats. Future studies are needed to explore the efficacy of ACAT inhibition in humans with CRF.",

    "71": "We previously demonstrated statins to enhance cytokine-mediated nitric oxide (NO) synthesis in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). To clarify the mechanism by which this occurs, we evaluated the effects of fluvastatin in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated VSMC. NO production induced by LPS was dose-dependently enhanced by fluvastatin, as were iNOS mRNA levels and iNOS protein expression. Exogenous mevalonate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) dampened the stimulatory effect of fluvastatin. A pull-down assay demonstrated fluvastatin to decrease levels of GTP-bound Rho A. Moreover, a Rho-kinase inhibitor, Y-27632, was observed to enhance LPS-induced NO production. We recently demonstrated that disrupting F-actin formation dramatically potentiates the ability of LPS to induce iNOS mRNA and protein expression. In the present study, staining of F-actin with nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD)-phallacidin demonstrated that fluvastatin significantly impairs F-actin stress fiber formation. In light of these results, the ability of statins to increase NO production is due, at least in part, to their ability to block the biosynthesis of mevalonate, thereby preventing isoprenoid biosynthesis. This inhibits Rho/Rho-kinase signalling and, in turn, disrupts the actin cytoskeleton. Further analysis of the signalling pathway by which the actin cytoskeleton affects iNOS expression might yield new insight into mechanisms of regulation of NO production.",

    "73": "The effects of atorvastatin on levels of the CD40 ligand (CD40L or CD154) and P-selectin on platelets were investigated in patients with hypercholesterolemia. The major finding was that short-term atorvastatin treatment (8 weeks) in a group of hypercholesterolemic patients resulted in significant suppression of CD40L and P-selectin expression. Moreover, there was a significant correlation between the magnitude of CD40L downregulation and that of very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, the ratio of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides. In hypercholesterolemic patients, in addition to its effects on decreasing cholesterol, atorvastatin can intervene in the interaction of CD40-CD40L and the expression of P-selectin on platelets. Thus, interference of CD40-CD40L can be recognized as an integral part of the anti-inflammatory activity of atorvastatin in hypercholesterolemia.",

The decision to treat hypertension and prevent cardiovascular complications has, for many years, been based on the level of blood pressure. The present review, based on a cross-sectional and careful analysis of major trials, emphasises the need to assess the cardiovascular risk for each patient in order to make appropriate treatment decisions. Evaluation of cardiovascular risk in untreated hypertensive subjects indicates that coronary risk is two to three times higher than cerebrovascular risk. The same results have been observed in outcome trials where hypertensive patients were treated with antihypertensive drugs. Even though the results of outcome trials for antihypertensive drugs can be explained by blood pressure differences between randomised groups, antihypertensive drugs are, for the same reduction in blood pressure, more efficient in preventing cerebrovascular events than in preventing (CAD). Meta-analysis indicates that each reduction of 2 mmHg in systolic blood pressure levels is associated with a 25% reduction in stroke events, but a difference of at least 5 mmHg for systolic pressure between groups is necessary to obtain prevention of coronary events. A number of controlled trials using statins have shown that these drugs were particularly effective in preventing coronary disease. An appropriate therapeutic strategy for cardiovascular risk reduction in hypertensive patients should therefore include both antihypertensive therapy and prescription of a statin. The efficacy of this strategy was recently reported in the ASCOT trial, which estimated that for 100 hypertensive patients with a high cardiovascular risk and followed up for 10 years, the number of coronary events is 13, 10 and 7 for those without antihypertensive treatment, with antihypertensive therapy only and with both antihypertensive therapy and statin therapy, respectively.",

Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is the rate-limiting enzyme of triglyceride removal from plasma and has been implicated in atherosclerosis. Since treatment with statins significantly reduces cardiovascular morbidity in diabetes, we analyzed the lipid profile and LPL activities in 61 patients with type 2 diabetes before and 8 weeks after initiation of atorvastatin (40 mg) or placebo treatment. Lipid parameters and LPL activity were unchanged under treatment with placebo.

Compared to baseline, LPL activity was increased by 25% after atorvastatin treatment (213.0 +/- 28.1 nmol/mL/min versus 171.9 +/- 17.7 nmol/mL/min, P < 0.01). Our data demonstrate that atorvastatin induces a significant improvement of diabetic dyslipidemia and a significant increase of LPL activity.

Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 23 (2003) 802], it is possible that lipid-lowering agents such as statins, which reduce the prenylation of Ras, could decrease such tube formation. Therefore, we investigated whether this event occurs through inhibition of the Ras/Raf/ERK pathway. We developed an in vitro model of EC tube formation on a matrix gel. Simvastatin inhibited serum-induced endothelial tube formation after 18 h. The inhibition of ERK activity suppressed serum-induced tube formation. Farnesylpyrophosphate (Fpp), which translocates Ras from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane, rescued this inhibition. In addition, farnesyltransferase I inhibitor, which inhibits Ras farnesylation, and dominant-negative Ras (N17) also inhibited serum-induced tube formation. Although Fpp activated Ras assessed by a Ras pull-down assay and phospho(p)-ERK1/2, Fpp-induced p-ERK1/2 activation was not inhibited by simvastatin. In conclusion, simvastatin-induced Ras/Raf/ERK inactivation is a potent signal in the anti-angiogenic phenotype of HCECs. Fpp counteracted simvastatin-induced Ras/Raf/ERK inactivation.", 
    "136": "There is currently intense research interest in the properties of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) beyond their well-documented lipid-lowering action. Studies have consistently demonstrated that administration of statin therapy decreases levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. This effect appears to be independent of the extent of reduction in total or LDL-cholesterol. Statins also appear to improve endothelial dysfunction by increasing endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. There is also evidence that statins inhibit fibrin formation and thrombus development, an effect that which would be clinically beneficial following plaque fissure or rupture. Early preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that there are quantitative differences between statin regimens in terms of their cholesterol-independent properties. Trials comparing equipotent doses of different statins, based on lipid-lowering efficacy, have not reported any differences in cholesterol-independent properties. However, the current evidence base indicates that more aggressive statin regimens are associated with an enhanced anti-inflammatory effect. Intensive lipid-lowering using statin therapy generates a greater reduction in mortality than standard lipid management, and it is possible that enhanced cholesterol-independent effects may account for some of this excess benefit.",

    "138": "Coronary artery disease with its accompanying complication of acute myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the major causes of death in the modern world. A variety of both primary and secondary prevention strategies have been developed for the treatment of acute MI. One of the more important of these strategies is the prescription of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have the potential to positively affect the outcome of acute MI in a variety of ways including the reduction of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels and stabilisation of the atherosclerotic plaque. Multiple large randomised clinical trials have documented the potential of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors to reduce both short- and long-term mortality after acute MI. This benefit exists regardless of age, gender, clinical presentation, or even baseline lipid levels. However, despite this overwhelming amount of evidence supporting the use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in the post-MI setting, multiple studies have documented the presence of a significant 'treatment gap'. Indeed, often, less than half of acute MI patients who would benefit from HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor therapy actually receive it. The reasons for the low utilisation of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in the acute MI patient are many, but may include poor communication, the high cost of treatment, the lack of associated symptoms and confusion regarding appropriate lipid levels to target. One approach that has been tried to address these issues is the development of institutional programmes specifically targeted to increase the use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in acute MI patients. These programmes, often managed by nurses or pharmacists, have been piloted in several institutions. They have been effectively implemented in both inpatient and outpatient settings. In most cases they have been implemented without a great increase in expense. They have often increased the use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors to >90%. Most importantly, they have documented a significant improvement in the long-term survival of acute MI patients. Based on these preliminary studies, it is recommended that the implementation of these strategies be considered by most healthcare institutions.",

The levels of triglyceride (TG), cholesterol (Chol), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were measured after 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks on fluvastatin and after 4 weeks washout period. Lipid percentage changes (delta) were not associated with apoE phenotype for any treatment time. Cholesterol decreased by 14% after 12 weeks and HDL-C increased by 14-16% after 12 weeks for three phenotype groups. deltaTG, deltaChol, deltaLDL-C were associated positively, while negatively for deltaHDL-C, with the corresponding basal lipid values for the three groups. The positive deltaTG values occurred at a low basal TG0 level and became negative at TG0 > 1.6-1.9 mM. For E3 and E4+ groups, only a single parameter contributed significantly into a variation of lipid percentage changes. For the E2+ group, TG0 and Chol0 contributed in a reciprocal manner into deltaTG12/0, both positively into deltaChol8/0; Chol0 and HDL-C0 both negatively contributed into deltaHDL-C12/0. HDL-C0 contributed reciprocally into LDL-C variability for E2+ and E4+ groups.

Unfortunately, the low treatment and control rates, combined with the high prevalence of both conditions, still contribute to the high burden of cardiovascular disease in Western countries. In the past 5 years, many studies evaluating the benefit of combined antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatment on endothelial dysfunction, coronary atherosclerosis, hypertension control, and on primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events have been published. In this article, we discuss and critically evaluate the available evidence on the potential benefits of combined antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatment.", 
    "142": "The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is strongly associated with insulin resistance and consists of a constellation of factors that raise the risk for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus. Therefore, the primary goals of treating MetS are prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular events. Three levels of intervention may be considered for individuals with MetS : 1) management of underlying risk conditions by controlling weight excess, enhancing regular physical exercise and promoting healthy diet; 2) management of individual risk factors such as dyslipidaemia, hypertension, hyperglycaemia and prothrombotic state; and 3) targeting insulin resistance by using specific insulin sensitizers such as thiazolidinediones. The most important therapeutic intervention effective in subjects with MetS should focus on modest weight reduction and regular leisure-time physical activities. Although lifestyle modification is the first-line therapy, drug therapy may be necessary in many patients to achieve recommended goals regarding lipid profile, blood pressure and blood glucose control. Rather than to use a magic bullet that might fully reverse the underlying cause of the syndrome, one appealing alternative would be to use a so-called \"polypill\" targeting each of the components of MetS. However, such a polypill should ideally contain numerous molecules that all have shown a potential interest for the management of MetS such as metformin, acarbose, a thiazolidinedione, a statin, a fibrate, an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system, aspirin. The growing prevalence and high-risk nature of MetS highlights the need to identify individuals with this condition and to treat them with an aggressive multitargeted approach.", 
    "143": "GENERAL PRINCIPLES: The general progression throughout the world in type 2 diabetes has lead medical Authorities to develop mass screening but also prevention measures, notably for \"high-risk\" subjects such as those exhibiting a metabolic syndrome. Studies on the topic have shown that preventing type 2 diabetes was possible via lifestyle changes, possibly in association with pharmacological therapy (metformine, acarbose, thiazolidinediones, orlistat). The other therapeutic stakes in the context of the metabolic syndrome also concern the management of all identified cardiovascular risk factors. REGARDING HYPERTENSION: there are currently no specific recommendations available in the framework of metabolic syndrome, with regard to lowering blood pressure and how to obtain it. However there is evidence that patients may benefit from the strict control of blood pressure (< or =130/85 mm Hg). REGARDING DYSLIPIDEMIA: LDL cholesterol remains the main target, with a goal depending on individual cardiovascular risk (<1 or 1.30 g/l in the case of metabolic syndrome). Statins are of major interest in this context. However, it is also established that normalisation of triglycerides and HDL cholesterol contributes to the improvement of cardiovascular Issues. The respective indications for fibrates or fibrate/statin associations still need to be defined in primary as in secondary prevention.", 
    "144": "Rosuvastatin is a new statin that has been shown to produce substantial dose-dependent reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in Western and Japanese hypercholesterolemic patients. Rosuvastatin efficacy and safety were assessed in an open-label, dose-titration trial of 37 Japanese patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. After an 8-week dietary lead-in period, patients received rosuvastatin on the following schedule: 10 mg/day during weeks 0-6; 20 mg/day during weeks 6-12, and 40 mg/day for weeks 12-18. Mean percentage reductions from baseline in LDL-C (49.2-56.7%), total cholesterol (39.4-45.4%), and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) (46.7-54.3%) were highly significant at each dose (p < 0.0001). Similar significant reductions in triglycerides (18.2-25.0%; p < 0.006) and increases in HDL-C (9.6-13.6%; p < 0.005) were observed. Rosuvastatin was well tolerated. Two patients withdrew from the study because of adverse events unrelated to the study treatment. No patients had clinically significant elevations in liver transaminases. Two patients exhibited a single increase in creatine kinase (one unrelated to study treatment, the other possibly related) with no muscle symptoms. Rosuvastatin produced significant beneficial changes in all lipid parameters in Japanese patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and was well tolerated.", 
    "145": "Lipid-lowering therapy was shown to have several beneficial effects in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).", 
    "146": "The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of atorvastatin on platelet aggregation in patients with CAD.", 
    "147": "Twenty-five hypercholesterolaemic patients who had angiographically proven CAD and 16 normal subjects were enrolled. All patients received 10 mg/day atorvastatin for two months. Anti-platelet agents were discontinued 15 days prior to blood sampling at the beginning and at the end of the atorvastatin therapy. Aggregometric curves of the platelets in response to ADP, collagen and epinephrine were obtained using the aggregometry (turbidimetric) technique.", 
    "148": "In patients with CAD, total cholesterol (TC) and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) basal levels were measured (230 +/- 49 mg/dl, 140 +/- 41 mg/dl, respectively). Following lipid-lowering therapy, TC and LDL-C decreased significantly (p < 0.05). The activation measurements of aggregometric curves decreased significantly compared with basal parameters in response to ADP but not in response to collagen and epinephrine.", 
    "149": "Lipid-lowering therapy with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, atorvastatin, had a marked reduction effect on platelet aggregation.", 
    "150": "Considering acute myocardial infarctions (AMI), data demonstrate that C-reactive protein (CRP) levels reflect the severity of myocardial damage and that high CRP level is associated with a worse outcome. This study evaluates the prognostic value of CRP and the determinants of its increase during AMI.", 
    "151": "A retrospective observational study of 126 patients with a ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI); 101 patients had reperfusion therapy (93 thrombolysis, 8 PTCA). Peak CRP (median: 3.5 mg/dl) was achieved the third day. A correlation existed between this peak and age (r = 0.1838; p = 0.0408). Diabetic patients not requiring insulin showed peaks double those of other patients (10.4 versus 6.1 mg/dl; p = 0.0165). The peak was higher in anterior infarctions (anterior: 8.4, lateral: 6.9, inferior: 6.4, posterior: 3.9 mg/dl; p = 0.0206) and for those showing a Q-wave (7.5 versus 3.9 mg/dl; p = 0.0020). It was correlated with the CK (r = 0.246; p = 0.0188) and troponin Ic (r = 0.242; p = 0.0224) peaks among thrombolysed patients. There was an increasing relationship between the occurrence of cardiac failure and the magnitude of the CRP peak. An inverse linear relationship existed between the ejection fraction of the left ventricle and the CRP peak (r = -0.4187; p = 0.0000). CRP peak was lower with statins (3.8 versus 7.0 mg/dl; p = 0.0446). Fibrates were only associated with lower CRP levels at admission (0.6 versus 0.9 mg/dl; p = 0.0010).", 
    "152": "CRP is an indicator of the severity of STEMI. It is also an indicator for the occurrence of complications during hospitalization. The effect of statins and fibrates on CRP levels in AMI should be studied further.", 
    "153": "Hypercholesterolaemia is associated with a loss of endothelium-dependent vasodilation, which may facilitate the occurrence of myocardial ischaemia in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The improvement of endothelial dilator function after 4 to 6 weeks of oral lipid-lowering therapy has been documented. Whether this early restoration of endothelial function by statins translates into anti-ischaemic effects is unknown. This study was designed to determine the effect of 4 weeks' treatment with 80 mg atorvastatin daily on exercise-induced ischaemia in patients with stable ischaemic heart disease (IHD) receiving standard anti-anginal drug therapy.", 
    "154": "A total of 41 patients with documented CAD, exercise-induced ischaemia and LDL-cholesterol > 130 mg/dl underwent exercise ECG, angina score and lipid level assessment at baseline, after 4 weeks of placebo treatment, and after 4 weeks of therapy with atorvastatin 80 mg. Primary endpoint was the change in time to 1 mm ST-segment depression (= ischaemic threshold) between placebo and treatment period. Atorvastatin treatment resulted in a 55% reduction of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (from mean of 162 (SD 32) to 72 (20) mg/dl). For a comparable rate-pressure product, the average time to 1 mm ST-segment depression was 295 (112) s at baseline, 314 (149) s after placebo and 301 (131) s after atorvastatin, indicating that the ischaemic threshold was not significantly modulated after 4 weeks of atorvastatin treatment. There was also no significant change in global angina score or in time to maximal ST-segment depression.", 
    "155": "High-dose atorvastatin treatment for 4 weeks drastically reduced LDL-cholesterol. However, the present study did not demonstrate a significant effect on the ischaemic threshold in patients with stable IHD already under treatment with anti-ischaemic agents.", 
    "156": "Atorvastatin, a beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, improves neurological functional outcome, reduces cerebral cell loss, and promotes regional cellular plasticity when administered after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in rats.", 
    "157": "Autologous blood was stereotactically injected into the right striatum in rats, and atorvastatin was administered orally beginning 24 hours after ICH and continued daily for 1 week. At a dose of 2 mg/kg, atorvastatin significantly reduced the severity of neurological deficit from 2 to 4 weeks after ICH. The area of cell loss in the ipsilateral striatum was also significantly reduced in these animals. Consistent with previous study data, higher doses of atorvastatin (8 mg/kg) did not improve functional outcome or reduce the extent of injury. Histochemical stains for markers of synaptogenesis, immature neurons, and neuronal migration revealed increased labeling in the region of hemorrhage in the atorvastatin-treated rats.", 
    "158": "Analysis of the data in this study indicates that atorvastatin improves neurological recovery after experimental ICH and may do so in part by increasing neuronal plasticity."
