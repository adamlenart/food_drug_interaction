UPLC uses columns packed with 1.7 microm particles and enables elution of sample components in much narrower, more concentrated bands, resulting in better chromatographic resolution and increased peak height. The typical peak width was 5-10s at base, permitting very good separation of all compounds in 10 min, which represented an approximate three-fold reduction in the analysis time in comparison to conventional high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Unequivocal identification of target pharmaceutical compounds was based on accurate mass measurement of the molecular ions in the TOF mode and by performing collision induced dissociation (CID) in the Q-TOF mode in order to generate accurate mass measurement of the product ions. Using lock mass correction the accurate masses calculated for the product ions deviated from the theoretical masses by 0.2 to 1.3 mDa (root mean square (RMS) value=0.67) and 0.7-6.4 ppm (RMS=3.53), respectively. Quantitation was carried out working in the TOF mode using the narrow window extracted ion chromatograms (nwXICs) of each compound (extracted using a 20 mDa window) yielding relative standard deviation (RSD) from 0.5 to 5.3% (run-to-run) and from 2.1 to 9.1% (day-to-day) and instrumental detection limits (IDLs) from 1 to 200 pg. Analysis of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) samples gave method detection limits (MDLs) ranging from 10 to 500 ng/L. The UPLC-Q-TOF method was successfully applied to analyze pharmaceutical residues in WWTP samples.",

    "2": "Fifteen subjects with hypercholesterolemia and no obvious CHD and 29 subjects with hypercholesterolemia and stable angina received 40 mg of simvastatin daily for 12 weeks. Serum total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were determined by automated enzymatic assays whereas LDL-cholesterol was calculated using the Friedwald formula. The ox-LDL levels were determined by a commercially available ELISA kit. Free radicals were assessed by the Free Radical Analytical System (FRAS).", 
    "3": "Both in primary and secondary prevention, subjects had borderline levels of free radicals but in neither group there was a significant reduction of free radicals after simvastatin treatment. In subjects undergoing primary prevention of CHD, ox-LDL levels were reduced by 31.1+/-5.0% (P < 0.001) whereas in secondary prevention were reduced by 6.5+/-5.2% (P < 0.02) after simvastatin treatment. The reduction of ox-LDL levels did not correlate with the reduction of total cholesterol levels in either group studied. In both groups, ox-LDL levels were not associated with free radical levels either before or after simvastatin treatment.",

Polymyositis and other myopathies have also been reported in post-marketing data and in the medical literature in association with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use. We wished to follow-up these signals and investigate the evidence of causality for the association of polymyositis and other myopathy with PPI use.", 
    "6": "Spontaneously reported ADRs from national monitoring centres are sent to the WHO ADR database (VigiBase). VigiBase was searched for case reports of the PPIs, omeprazole, pantoprazole, lansoprazole, esomeprazole and rabeprazole, with terms indicative of myopathy, and further information was elicited from the national centres to help establish causality. Literature sources were reviewed for the occurrence of the above terms in combination with PPIs.", 
    "7": "In total, there were 292 reports of various myopathies with PPIs, excluding 868 cases of 'myalgia'. In this analysis, 69 patients recovered when the drug was withdrawn and, in 15 patients, the reaction re-occurred when the drug was reinstated. In one-third of the 292 cases, the PPI was the single administered drug, and the PPI was the single suspected drug by the reporter in 57% of reports where concomitant medication was used. In this analysis, three index cases are documented. One involves the same patient taking three different PPIs (lansoprazole, esomeprazole and rabeprazole) at different time periods, with myalgia and muscle weakness occurring with all three drugs. In the two other index cases, myopathies with esomeprazole and omeprazole were reported with positive rechallenge, and causality was assessed as 'possible' and 'certain' by the reporting centres. In 27 cases myositis or polymyositis was reported. Other myopathies were reported, including 35 cases with rhabdomyolysis. In 9 of these cases, the PPI was withdrawn and the reaction abated. The PPI was reinstated in one patient, but the reaction did not re-occur. Time to onset was given in 17 of the rhabdomyolysis cases, rhabdomyolysis occurred with the first week in 9 cases, and in 3 cases the reaction occurred between 14 days to 3 months of treatment. In 12 of these patients, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) was taken concomitantly.",

Eighteen healthy Caucasian smokers and non-smokers, genotyped as CYP2C9*1/*1 or CYP2C9*1/*2, received warfarin 10 mg plus vitamin K 10 mg to measure baseline CYP2C9 activity.

There was no difference in S-warfarin AUC(0-infinity) during baseline (p = 0.45) or inhibition (p = 0.19) periods for smokers versus non-smokers. Fluvastatin increased the AUC of S-warfarin by 42+/-29% and 26+/-18% in smokers and nonsmokers, respectively. Linear regression analyses showed significant but weak correlations between peak concentrations (C(at 1 h)) or (-) 3S,5R-fluvastatin AUC(0-12 h) and extent of warfarin inhibition. For (+) 3R,5S-fluvastatin, a weak correlation was found between C(at 1 h) and extent of warfarin inhibition.",

    "13": "Statins are drugs that inhibit HMG Co-A reductase and have been shown to enhance bone formation in vitro and in vivo in rodents. However, the statins currently used for cholesterol-lowering have been selected for their capacity to target the liver where their effects on cholesterol synthesis are mediated and they undergo first pass metabolism. When given in lipid-lowering doses, these agents do not likely reach sufficient blood concentrations to reliably cause substantial increases in bone formation in humans. Moreover, statins are inactivated by cytochrome P450 enzymes, resulting in even less peripheral distribution of the biologically active moieties beyond the liver.", 
    "14": "To investigate whether an alternate method of administration might produce beneficial effects on bone formation, we administered lovastatin by dermal application to rats to circumvent the first-pass effects of the gut wall and liver.", 
    "15": "We found that the statin blood levels measured by HMG Co-A reductase activity were higher, maintained longer and less variable following transdermal application than those following oral administration. Also the increased circulating statin levels were associated with significantly enhanced biological effects on bone. After only 5 days of administration of transdermal lovastatin to rats, there was a 30-60% increase in trabecular bone volume, and 4 weeks later, we observed more than a 150% increase in bone formation rates. There was also a significant increase in serum osteocalcin, a marker of bone formation. We also found that lovastatin administered transdermally produces these profound effects at doses in the range of 1% of the oral dose, without any evidence of the hepatotoxicity or myotoxicity that can occur following oral statin administration. Several doses (0.01-5 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) and dosage schedules were examined, and collectively the data strongly suggest a powerful anabolic effect but with an unusually flat dose-response curve.",

    "17": "Diabetic patients are often treated with a lipid lowering statin and an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor antagonist against hypertension or albuminuria. These drugs may also improve glucose tolerance, but the mechanism for this remains elusive. We now studied whether these drugs and the fatty acid palmitate influence insulin secretion in vivo in rats through effects on islet blood perfusion. Whole pancreatic blood flow was markedly increased by captopril and irbesartan, and decreased by palmitate. Islet blood flow was significantly and preferentially enhanced by captopril, irbesartan, and pravastatin, and suppressed by palmitate. Both captopril and irbesartan raised serum insulin concentrations significantly. However, glycemia was not affected in any group. In conclusion, the present study suggests that a local pancreatic RAS and pravastatin may be selectively controlling pancreatic islet blood flow and thereby influencing insulin secretion. The antidiabetic actions of statins and RAS inhibitors might in part occur through the beneficial direct islet effects shown here. Conversely, free fatty acids that are elevated in type 2 diabetic patients may contribute to an impaired nutritive islet blood flow and thereby further aggravate the diabetic state by limiting the supply of insulin needed to curb hyperglycemia.", 
    "18": "In addition to their lipid-lowering action, it has been demonstrated that statins can exert direct anti-inflammatory effects.

Changes in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality were the primary outcomes of interest. For lifestyle interventions, blood pressure (BP) lowering was accepted as a primary outcome given the lack of long-term morbidity/mortality data in this field. For treatment of patients with kidney disease, the development of proteinuria or worsening of kidney function was also accepted as a clinically relevant primary outcome.",

Treatment thresholds and targets should take into account each individual's global atherosclerotic risk, target organ damage and comorbid conditions. BP should be lowered to less than 140/90 mmHg in all patients, and to less than 130/80 mmHg in those with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease (regardless of the degree of proteinuria). Most adults with hypertension require more than one agent to achieve these target BPs. For adults without compelling indications for other agents, initial therapy should include thiazide diuretics. Other agents appropriate for first-line therapy for diastolic hypertension with or without systolic hypertension include beta-blockers (in those younger than 60 years), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (in nonblack patients), long-acting calcium channel blockers or angiotensin receptor antagonists. Other agents for first-line therapy for isolated systolic hypertension include long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers or angiotensin receptor antagonists. Certain comorbid conditions provide compelling indications for first-line use of other agents: in patients with angina, recent myocardial infarction or heart failure, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors are recommended as first-line therapy; in patients with diabetes mellitus, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists (or in patients without albuminuria, thiazides or dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers) are appropriate first-line therapies; and in patients with nondiabetic chronic kidney disease, ACE inhibitors are recommended. All hypertensive patients should have their fasting lipids screened, and those with dyslipidemia should be treated using the thresholds, targets and agents recommended by the Canadian Hypertension Education Program Working Group on the management of dyslipidemia and the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Selected patients with hypertension, but without dyslipidemia, should also receive statin therapy and/or acetylsalicylic acid therapy.",

This study asked whether these LPL haplotypes influence response to lipid-lowering therapy among 829 subjects from the Post-Coronary Artery Bypass Graft trial. Lipid profiles were obtained at baseline and 4-5 years after treatment with lovastatin. Haplotypes were based on 12 SNPs. The fourth most frequent haplotype, 12-4, was associated with a decreased increment in high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) following treatment. Haplotypes 12-6, 12-7 and 12-8 were each associated with increased HDL-C response to therapy, and haplotype 12-2 with decreased TG response. The most common haplotype, 12-1, was protective against graft worsening or occlusion. Haplotype 12-4 reduced HDL-C response to lovastatin, possibly consistent with our prior observations of this haplotype as predisposing to coronary artery disease. LPL may influence atherosclerosis risk through pleiotropic effects on each aspect of the metabolic syndrome.",

The Treating to New Targets and the Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering trials demonstrated the incremental benefit of more aggressive low-density cholesterol lowering in stable coronary heart disease. The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of statin trials supported the importance of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction, irrespective of initial lipid profile, in reducing cardiovascular events.

This predominantly reflects excessive proliferation/impaired apoptosis of smooth muscle and endothelial cells, rather than vasoconstriction. To exclude confounding effects of cardiac output and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, the diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension should require a pulmonary vascular resistance >3 Wood-units, not simply a mean pulmonary arterial pressure >25 mmHg. A 'positive' response (20% fall in pulmonary arterial pressure/pulmonary vascular resistance PAP/PVR) to acute, selective, pulmonary vasodilators (e.g. inhaled nitric oxide), occurs in 20% of patients, portends a favorable prognosis and justifies a trial of calcium channel blockers. Randomized controlled trials support treatment of NYHA class III pulmonary arterial hypertension with oral endothelin antagonists or phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. Prostacyclin analogues (inhaled/subcutaneous) are useful adjunctive therapies. Intravenous epoprostenol remains the therapeutic mainstay for class IV PAH.

    "35": "Treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with nicotinic acid and statin results in a pronounced increase of protective high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and reduces morbidity/mortality. Addition of prolonged-release nicotinic acid to ongoing treatment with statin raises high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and induces regression of atherosclerosis that otherwise would progress during statin treatment. Several new high-density lipoprotein-raising drugs in clinical trials are reported. New proposed mechanisms for the broad-spectrum lipid effects of nicotinic acid are described.", 
    "36": "Low plasma concentration of high-density lipoprotein is an important risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Nicotinic acid has the uncomfortable but harmless side effect of flush. Prolonged-release nicotinic acid gives rise to less flush than immediate-release nicotinic acid.

The purported superiority of specific drug classes, notably angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers, is increasingly debated. Conversely, the benefits of calcium channel blockers are increasingly recognized. Irrespective of differences, all three agents are frequently required to achieve blood pressure targets. Beyond blood pressure reduction, statin therapy is undoubtedly the single most important risk factor intervention.

Plasma APOA5 (R (s)=0.40), APOC3 (R (s)=0.72) and APOE (R (s)=0.45) were positively correlated with plasma triglyceride levels (all p<0.001). In multiple linear regression analysis, adjusted for age and sex, the variation in plasma triglycerides was explained mostly by APOC3 (52%) and only to a small extent by APOA5 (6%) and APOE (1%). Atorvastatin treatment decreased plasma triglycerides, APOA5, APOC3 and APOE (all p<0.0001). After treatment, APOC3 remained the major determinant of plasma triglyceride levels (59%), while the contributions of APOA5 and APOE were insignificant (2 and 3%).",

    "47": "Statins are potent, cholesterol-lowering agents with newly appreciated, broad anti-inflammatory properties, largely based upon their ability to block the prenylation of Rho GTPases, including RhoA. Because phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) is a pivotal regulator of inflammation, which is inhibited by RhoA, we sought to determine whether statins enhanced efferocytosis. The effect of lovastatin on efferocytosis was investigated in primary human macrophages, in the murine lung, and in human alveolar macrophages taken from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In this study, we show that lovastatin increased efferocytosis in vitro in an 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase-dependent manner. Lovastatin acted by inhibiting both geranylgeranylation and farnesylation, and not by altering expression of key uptake receptors or by increasing binding of apoptotic cells to phagocytes. Lovastatin appeared to exert its positive effect on efferocytosis by inhibiting RhoA, because it 1) decreased membrane localization of RhoA, to a greater extent than Rac-1, and 2) prevented impaired efferocytosis by lysophosphatidic acid, a potent inducer of RhoA. Finally, lovastatin increased efferocytosis in the naive murine lung and ex vivo in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease alveolar macrophages in an HMG-CoA reductase-dependent manner. These findings indicate that statins enhance efferocytosis in vitro and in vivo, and suggest that they may play an important therapeutic role in diseases where efferocytosis is impaired and inflammation is dysregulated.",

Linear and logistic regression were used to control for potential demographic and clinical characteristics.",

The likelihood of having a complete HUI response set decreased with higher age (P<0.001) but not with the other variables studied. A complete utility score could be calculated for 3390 participants. Of these, 2755 (81.3%) had no history of MI, 546 (16.1%) had an MI>3 months previously, and 89 (2.6%) had an MI within 3 months. The mean (median) utilities were virtually identical for these states: 0.75 (0.84), 0.74 (0.84), and 0.74 (0.84), respectively. From multivariate analyses, utilities decreased with higher age and the presence of several other comorbidities (diabetes, stroke, peripheral vascular disease); women had lower utilities than men (all P<0.01).", 
    "52": "In this large implementation of the HUI in elderly patients, the instrument did not detect any differences in estimated utilities related to having a MI. Potential causes of nondiscrimination for MI include the possibility that competing comorbidities may reduce the impact of MI on quality of life in this age group, as well as the possibility that a standard instrument derived from and validated in younger populations may not perform as well in elderly people.", 
    "53": "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are a group of cholesterol lowering agents that have become the largest selling drugs in the world. They are of proven clinical benefit in coronary heart disease, at least in those patients who do not have overt chronic heart failure (CHF). Co-administration of statins with angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) is most common, since there is strong synergy between hypertension and hypercholesterolemia in terms of risk factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases. In present paper, we describe the in vitro availability of atorvastatin, a potent HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, in presence of losartan potassium, which is a non-peptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist. These studies were carried out at 37, 48 and 60 degrees C in different pH environments simulating human body compartments. It was observed that in pH 1, 7.4 and 9 the availability of atorvastatin was very high while losartan was not at all available. However in pH 4 these effects were reversed and atorvastatin was not available at all. At 48 degrees C the availability of atorvastatin was high and that of losartan was depressed at pH 9, whereas the later was not available at pH 1, 4 and 7.4 at all. Likewise at 60 degrees C, the availability of atorvastatin at pH 7.4 and 9 was high, whereas the charge-transfer complex formed between the two drugs was broken at pH 1 at this temperature and the entire drug was available. On the other hand the availability of losartan at pH 4 and 9 was high while it was not available at pH 1 and 7.4. The availability of atorvastatin was maximum in simulated gastric juice as compared to buffer of pH 7.4 and 9. This high availability of one drug in presence of other is attributed to the formation of a charge-transfer complex, which was stable at elevated temperatures, except at 60 degrees C in pH 1.",

In contrast to the detrimental role of T cells and macrophages, B cells appear to be atheroprotective. These basic experimental findings have partly been confirmed in studies of the human carotid artery system. Inflammation is not only instrumental in the development of human atheromatous plaques, but, importantly, plays a crucial role in the destabilization of internal carotid artery plaques, thus converting chronic atherosclerosis into an acute thrombo-embolic disorder. Humoral factors involved in internal carotid artery destabilization include cytokines, cyclooxygenase-2, matrix metalloproteinases, and tissue factor.

Twenty-nine type 2 diabetic patients with dyslipidemia were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive atorvastatin orally at 10 mg (A10; n = 10), 20 mg (A20; n = 10), or 40 mg (A40; n = 9) daily for 12 weeks. Levels of plasma total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (C) in all three studied groups were significantly decreased after treatment with atorvastatin for 12 weeks (all groups, P < 0.001). However, the greatest LDL-C lowering effect and the highest percentage of subjects achieving the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) LDL-C goal were observed in the A20 group. All diabetic subjects had a higher plasma ET-1 concentration (A10, 1.02 +/- 0.37 pg/ml, mean +/- SD; A20, 1.17 +/- 0.55 pg/ml; and A40, 0.87 +/- 0.45 pg/ml) than that of age- and sex-matched normal control subjects (0.64 +/- 0.15 pg/ml; all groups, P < 0.001). Plasma ET-1 levels showed a borderline significant decrease at the end of study, by 22% in diabetic subjects treated with 10 mg atorvastatin (P = 0.05 compared with baseline), and by 30% in subjects treated with 20 mg atorvastatin (P = 0.06, compared with baseline). Paradoxically, the 40-mg dose of atorvastatin provided an increase of 2% in plasma ET-1 levels at the end of study, which is significantly different (P < 0.05) and marginally significant (P = 0.057) from the levels of the 10- and 20-mg doses, respectively. Similarly, although insignificantly, plasma concentrations of CRP also tended to decrease by 12% and 48%, and paradoxically increased by 18% in diabetic patients treated with 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg atorvastatin, respectively.

There was no difference in the potency of ET-1 to contract aorta from the two groups (C57BL/6/J pD2 = 8.74 +/- 0.30; ApoE-/- pD2 = 8.50 +/- 0.15, P > 0.05). This increased response was specific to ET-1, as it was not observed with phenylephrine or U46619, nor was it due to a non-receptor mediated increase in contractile sensitivity, as there was no change in response to KCl between the two groups. [125I]ET-1 bound with subnanomolar affinity (K(D)) to aorta (K(D) = 0.018 +/- 0.002 nM, n = 4) and, with an order of magnitude lower affinity, to heart (K(D) = 0.47 +/- 0.05, n = 5) of C57BL/6/J mice with binding densities (B(MAX)) of 9.3 +/- 2.4 fmol mg(-1)protein and 100 +/- 14 fmol mg(-1) protein, respectively. Alterations in vascular reactivity to ET-1 could not be explained by increased endothelin receptor density or affinity, as these were not altered in aorta (K(D) = 0.011 +/- 0.003 nM; B(MAX) = 10.1 +/- 3.9 fmol mg(-1), n = 4) and heart (K(D) = 0.43 +/- 0.04 nM; B(MAX) = 115 +/- 26 fmol mg(-1), n == 6) of ApoE-/- animals. The ratio of ET(A) to ET(B) receptors in heart of control and ApoE-/- mice was similar, comprising 89% and 85% ET(A) receptors, respectively. In isolated aorta from ApoE-/- mice on the Western diet, which more closely resembled more advanced stages of the disease in man, the augmented ET-1 vasoconstrictor response was maintained (E(MAX) = 25.2% +/- 6.8% KCl, n = 9); however, it was completely prevented in animals that had received 10 weeks of oral atorvastatin (30 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) (E(MAX) = 4.0% +/- 1.5% KCl, n = 5), a concentration that was chosen because it did not affect plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Therefore, this protective prevention of enhanced ET-1 vasoconstriction in ApoE-/- mice by atorvastatin was independent of its lipid-lowering properties.", 
    "82": "It has been reported that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) produce a variety of cardiovascular protective effects independent of their ability to lower total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Recent studies have also reported that statins produce pleiotropic effects through improved endothelial function, enhanced fibrinolysis, and antithrombotic actions. In the present study, we examined the effects of pitavastatin, pravastatin, atorvastatin, and cerivastatin on endothelin (ET)-1 production in cultured porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAECs). Treatment with cerivastatin but not pitavastatin, pravastatin, or atorvastatin decreased basal and TNF-alpha-stimulated ET-1 release from PAECs in a dose-dependent manner (1-10 microM). Northern blot analysis showed that cerivastatin markedly suppressed prepro ET-1 mRNA expression in both conditions. In addition, these inhibitory effects of cerivastatin on ET-1 release and prepro ET-1 mRNA expression were completely abolished by simultaneous treatment with 200 microM mevalonate. Furthermore, cerivastatin did not have any effects on endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein levels, but induced eNOS phosphorylation at Ser1177. From these findings, it is most likely that cerivastatin suppresses ET-1 production, possibly through an increase in eNOS activity and the subsequent nitric oxide production in PAECs. These findings also suggest that cerivastatin may have beneficial effects on ET-1-related diseases.",

This pilot study was performed to evaluate the safety and the low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-C and C-reactive protein lowering efficacy of atorvastatin (A) and of the association of A plus E in five renal transplant patients with hypercholesterolemia and mild renal functional impairment receiving cyclosporine-A (CsA). Patients received for three periods, each of 3 weeks, A at a dose of 20 mg/day; A at a dose of 10 mg/day and finally, A 10 mg plus E 10 mg daily.

Here we demonstrate that the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin potentiates TNFalpha-mediated apoptosis and TNFalpha signaling in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). While 2.5 microM simvastatin or 40 ng/ml TNFalpha alone had only a small effect on apoptosis in HUVECs, co-incubation with simvastatin and TNFalpha markedly increased apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner as measured by FACS analysis of propidium iodide-stained cells. Geranylgeraniol, which serves as a substrate for the geranylgeranylation of small GTP binding proteins such as RhoA, which is required for the function and membrane localization of Rho, reversed the effect of simvastatin on apoptosis. GGTI, an inhibitor of protein geranylgeranylation, mimicked the effect of simvastatin on apoptosis and interfered with the membrane localization of RhoA. Furthermore, simvastatin increased the expression of the TNFalpha type I receptor (TNFalphaRI) with a dose dependence and a dependence on geranylgeranylation similar to that demonstrated for the potentiation of TNFalpha-mediated apoptosis. Adenoviral expression of a dominant-negative RhoA mimicked the effect of simvastatin on the expression of TNFalphaRI, while adenoviral expression of a dominant-activating RhoA mutant reversed the effect of simvastatin on the expression of TNFalphaRI. Simvastatin also potentiated TNFalpha signaling as determined by increased TNFalpha-mediated E-selectin expression. These data support the conclusion that TNFalpha signaling is under the negative control of RhoA and that statins potentiate TNFalpha signaling at least in part via interference with RhoA inhibition of TNFalpha type I receptor expression.",

Here we treated Chinese hamster ovary cell lines with lovastatin (a hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor) and mevalonate (a precursor for isoprenoids) to block endo-CHOL synthesis and then examined its effects on the fate of cholesterol liberated from low density lipoprotein (LDL-CHOL). The results showed that blocking endo-CHOL synthesis for 2 h or longer does not impair the hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters but partially impairs the transport of LDL-CHOL to the plasma membrane. Blocking endo-CHOL synthesis for 2 h or longer also alters the localization patterns of the late endosomes/lysosomes and retards their motility, as monitored by time-lapse microscopy. LDL-CHOL overcomes the effect of blocking endo-CHOL synthesis on endosomal localization patterns and on endosomal motility. Overexpressing Rab9, a key late endosomal small GTPase, relieves the endosomal cholesterol accumulation in Niemann-Pick type C1 cells but does not revert the reduced endosomal motility caused by blocking endo-CHOL synthesis. Our results suggested that endo-CHOL contributes to the cholesterol content of late endosomes and controls its motility, in a manner independent of NPC1.

Simvastatin treatment resulted in an increase of GPx activity by 38% (p<0.0001), but did not have a significant effect on TAS.

Hyperglycemia has emerged as an important marker of outcome in the operating room. Intensive insulin therapy promises to reduce health risk in the surgical and critical care setting. Perioperative beta-blocker and statin therapy are likely to reduce cardiac morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. Promotility therapy (with metoclopromide) intended to reduce the aspiration risk of diabetic gastroparesis is likely over-utilized and may only be indicated for diabetics with poor glucose control and high hemoglobin A1c levels.",

A pleiotropic proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-18 (IL-18), is reported to exhibit significant antitumor activities through the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells and the inhibition of angiogenesis. Previously, we found that pravastatin, fluvastatin, and simvastatin induced the production of IL-18 in human monocytes. The addition of mevalonate abolished the IL-18 production induced by pravastatin, fluvastatin, and simvastatin, indicating that the IL-18 production might be a result of the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. We present a new hypothesis that the production of IL-18 might play roles in the action of statins on cancer.",

Nevertheless, there are rare occasions when adverse events (AEs), sometimes serious, may occur. Rosuvastatin is the newest statin to be approved in the USA and many other countries. As part of the continued assessment of the benefit-risk profile of rosuvastatin, AstraZeneca has developed a progressive, comprehensive pharmacoepidemiology programme to complement safety data obtained from randomised clinical trials and spontaneous reporting systems, which have demonstrated that rosuvastatin has a safety profile in line with comparator statins. This programme comprises nine studies conducted in recognised centres of excellence assessing over 50,000 patients treated with rosuvastatin. It consists of three components: patient characteristics studies (four studies), safety evaluation studies (four studies); and review of data generated from the Prescription-Event Monitoring (PEM) study, designed and run by an independent third party. Patient characteristics studies are designed to describe the characteristics and drug utilisation patterns of new users of rosuvastatin compared with new users of other statins in automated databases. Safety evaluation studies will examine the rates of specific AEs in different cohorts of statin users and determine risk factors for these events using data recorded prospectively in automated databases with case adjudication via medical record review. The independent PEM study will monitor any significant events recorded by general practitioners since starting rosuvastatin treatment.

However, a marked deterioration of glycemic control has been reported in some patients treated with atorvastatin. No study has been done to determine whether atorvastatin adversely affects glycemic control. In this study, we retrospectively compared an atorvastatin-treated group (Group A, n = 76) with a pravastatin-treated group (Group P, n = 78) to examine the effects of the 2 statins on glycemic control from the onset of administration to 3 months thereafter. No change occurred in the antidiabetic drug dose in 62 patients of Group A and 68 patients of Group P. In those patients, arbitrary blood glucose levels increased from 147 +/- 50 (mean +/- SD) mg/dL to 177 +/- 70 mg/dL in Group A and from 140 +/- 38 mg/dL to 141 +/- 32 mg/dL in Group P.

We have determined the predictive power of the same methodology for angiographically defined CAD using plasma samples from groups of male patients, classified by statin treatment, who had normal coronary arteries (NCAs) or CAD. Predictions for NCA and CAD groups were only 80.3% correct for patients not treated with statins and 61.3% for treated patients, compared with random correct predictions of 50%. A confidence limit of >99% was achieved for 36.2% of predictions for untreated groups and 6.2% for treated groups. Detection of CAD by 1H-NMR with >99% confidence was therefore very weak compared with angiography.",

However, microvessel density in the infarcted myocardium was increased only by implantation of bone marrow mononuclear cells, and not by administration of pravastatin. Pravastatin resulted in significant decreases in the serum levels of interleukin 1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and also in the infiltration of CD45-positive cells, but not CD117-positive stem cells, in infarcted myocardium.

In this study, we first tested whether atorvastatin treatment enhances neurological functional outcome and neuronal differentiation after stroke in retired breeder 12 month rats. Rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion and treated with or without atorvastatin (3 mg/kg) for 7 days. Atorvastatin significantly increased expression of mammalian achaete-scute homologue-1, beta-tubulin III, and vascular endothelial growth factor in the ischemic brain, and concomitantly improved functional outcome compared with middle cerebral artery occlusion control rats. Increased neurogenesis significantly correlated with functional recovery after stroke. To further investigate the mechanisms of atorvastatin-induced neuronal differentiation, experiments were performed on neurospheres derived from retired breeder rat subventricular zone cells. Atorvastatin increased neuronal differentiation and upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor and mammalian achaete-scute homologue-1 gene expression in cultured neurospheres. Vascular endothelial growth factor-treated neurospheres significantly increased mammalian achaete-scute homologue-1 and beta-tubulin III expression. Inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor decreased atorvastatin-induced mammalian achaete-scute homologue-1 and beta-tubulin III expression. These data indicate that atorvastatin increases neuronal differentiation in retired breeder rats. In addition, atorvastatin upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor expression, influences mammalian achaete-scute homologue-1 transcription factor, which in turn, facilitates an increase in subventricular zone neuronal differentiation. These atorvastatin-mediated molecular events may contribute to the improved functional outcome in retired breeder rats subjected to stroke.", 
    "134": "Therapeutic reference pricing is one of the potential cost containment methods for pharmaceuticals. The most critical question of reference pricing is how to select reference product(s) if their efficacy is different, especially if different strengths of the same substance are available. Authors describe the Hungarian experience related to the introduction of therapeutic reference pricing for statin therapies as of 1 September 2003. The National Health Insurance Fund selected the reference products based on their low price per DDD. Therapeutic reference pricing was expected to reduce the expenditure on statins by switching therapy to cheaper alternatives and therefore decreasing the average price per prescribed unit. The National Health Insurance Fund expected price erosion not only for branded products directly affected by generics but even for patented ones. Despite generic price erosion of simvastatin, the average unit price of statins was reduced by only 3% at 7 months after the introduction of the reference pricing system. During the same period the average DDD per prescription was increased from 1.14 to 1.65. The price of patented statins did not change over this period. Introduction of therapeutic reference pricing neglected evidence-based medicine results and ultimately increased the expenditure on statins in Hungary. Selection of the cheapest DDD per unit as the reference product resulted in growth of DDD per prescription, and consequently increased price per prescribed unit of statins. The failure of the system could have been even more dramatic if increased utilisation of generic statins had not reduced the negative effect of therapeutic reference pricing. Based upon the first experiences of the Hungarian implementation, the method described in this paper for the extension of generic reference pricing to therapeutic categories is not justifiable.", 
    "135": "Patients with increased cholesterol levels are at increased risk to experience cardiovascular events and to die from vascular disease. Statins have been proven to effectively reduce cholesterol levels and subsequently reduce cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease or at increased risk to develop coronary artery disease. However, in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), not high, but low levels of cholesterol are related to increased mortality. This phenomenon of reverse epidemiology is not unique to CHF, but also exists in other critical diseases and in the elderly in general as well. An important rationale has been provided by the endotoxin hypothesis, which suggests that cholesterol has an important scavenger function regarding harmful endotoxins. Indeed, these lines of evidence predict a harmful effect of statin treatment in patients with CHF. However, statins not only lower cholesterol, but also have been reported to exhibit a plethora of pleiotropic effects, including reduction of inflammation and improvement of endothelial function. In order to reconcile these contradictory lines of evidence, it is necessary to examine the pharmacological mechanisms of effects of statin treatment. Understanding the pharmacology of statin intervention in CHF models and patients may facilitate the development of therapeutic strategies. In this review, we provide an overview of the known associations between serum cholesterol and CHF in human subjects. In addition, we review the available lines of evidence in animal models and humans predicting both harmful and beneficial effects of statin treatment in CHF. We emphasize the importance of additional research specifically in CHF models and patients.", 
    "136": "Hypertension is associated with an increase in cardiovascular events. Pathophysiological mechanisms of this include endothelial damage/dysfunction, inflammatory activation, insulin resistance, platelet activation and alterations in the coagulation cascade leading to a prothrombotic state. Dyslipidaemia acts synergistically with hypertension in increasing cardiovascular risk. HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are lipid-lowering drugs and more recently have been shown to have a significant pleiotropic effect on endothelial function, inflammation, platelet activation and coagulation. Statins affect the whole pathophysiology of atherogenesis from deposition to plaque rupture and thrombogenesis because of its pleiotropic effects. Therefore it is intuitive that statins may be of benefit in hypertensive patients with conventionally normal lipid levels by preventing the pathological effects of hypertension. There is an increasing clinical evidence base for statins use in patients with hypertension. In this article, the novel pleiotropic and conventional mechanisms of statins, and clinical data of statin therapy in patients with hypertension are reviewed.",

Simvastatin and lovastatin were equipotent in reducing BBB permeability in vitro, with median effective concentration (EC(50)) of 9.5 x 10(-8) and 1.0 x 10(-7)M, respectively. We further demonstrate that lovastatin and simvastatin treatment of BBB-ECs significantly restricts the migration of clinically isolated syndrome-derived and MS-derived monocytes and lymphocytes across the human BBB in vitro, through a specific reduction in the secretion of the chemokines monocyte chemotactic protein-1/CCL2 and interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10/CXCL10 by BBB-ECs.",

Variables indicating the extent of Raynaud's phenomenon improved significantly, and up-regulated levels of angiogenic factors and vascular endothelial activation/injury markers decreased significantly during atorvastatin treatment.

Thirteen studies comprising 3,956 rosuvastatin-treated patients were selected based on a serum creatinine measurement at 6 or 8 weeks after initiation of rosuvastatin treatment, randomization to approved and marketed rosuvastatin doses (5 to 40 mg), and unchanged rosuvastatin dose from treatment initiation (baseline) through 6 to 8 weeks of treatment. eGFR was determined with the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula. eGFR significantly increased for each dose of rosuvastatin individually and for all doses combined compared with baseline (range +0.9 to +3.2 ml/min/1.73 m2). Further analysis of 5 blinded, placebo-controlled trials comprising 525 patients showed an increase in eGFR of +0.8 ml/min/1.73 m2 (95% confidence interval +0.1 to +1.5) for all rosuvastatin-treated patients, which was significantly different from baseline (p <0.04) and from a change of -1.5 ml/min/1.73 m2 in the placebo-treated patients (95% confidence interval -2.5 to -0.5, p <0.001). The increase in eGFR for rosuvastatin-treated patients was consistent across all major demographic and clinical subgroups of interest, including patients with baseline proteinuria, baseline eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2, and in patients with hypertension and/or diabetes. In conclusion, these results are consistent with previous rosuvastatin studies that showed an upward trend in eGFR with long-term treatment (> or =96 weeks) and with the hypothesis that statins may have pleiotropic mechanisms of action that include beneficial renal effects.", 
    "149": "The effect of obesity on atherosclerotic burden and its modulation by lipid-lowering therapy is unknown. The Reversal of Atherosclerosis with Aggressive Lipid Lowering (REVERSAL) study was analyzed to determine the influence of increasing body mass index (BMI) on plasma lipids, C-reactive protein, plaque burden as determined by intravascular ultrasound, and the serial change in these parameters with a moderate or intensive lipid-lowering strategy. Patients with a higher BMI were younger, more likely to be women, and had a greater prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome. Although a higher BMI was associated with a lower high-density lipoprotein level and higher triglyceride and C-reactive protein levels, there was no apparent influence of BMI on plaque burden. However, with the intensive lipid-lowering strategy, a greater BMI was associated with a lower proportionate decrease in low-density lipoprotein (49.1 +/- 21.4% vs 43.0 +/- 22.4%, p = 0.008) and a greater proportionate decrease in C-reactive protein (39.7% vs 33.3%, p <0.04). Further, although moderate and intensive lipid-lowering strategies halted plaque progression in subjects with a lower BMI (median progression rates +1.5% and +1.2%, respectively), a significant effect on plaque progression rates was seen only with adoption of an intensive lipid-lowering strategy in the most obese subjects (median progression rate -1.88% vs +6.5% with the moderate lipid-lowering strategy, p = 0.01). In conclusion, plaque progression in obese patients is attenuated using an intensive, but not moderate, lipid-lowering strategy. These results highlight the need for aggressive risk factor modification and a decrease in vascular inflammation in obese patients.",

Additional features of these analogs that are of value in treating such GEP tumors include their antiproliferative potential, which is in the process of being verified, and, above all, their anti-secretory action, so effective in symptom control.

The merits of radiometabolic therapy, on the other hand, were unclear, a finding reported elsewhere in the literature, and in the only case treated by prolonged OCT treatment, no antiproliferative action was observed. The diagnostic usefulness of SRS was thus confirmed and it appears likely that radiolabeled analogs used intraoperatively for tumor localization will prove equally of value. The effectiveness of receptor-mediated radionuclide therapy is still in the process of being verified. Based on the expectation of analogs with an universal affinity for SST receptors (sst), it is reasonable to look forward to a significant increase in the efficacy of this type of therapy.", 
    "154": "Serious side effects of statins, including severe myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, are rare but important in general practice. Hypothyroidism can cause secondary hypercholesterolemia and myopathy. There have been few reports on the risk of statins in patient with unnoticed hypothyroidism. We analyzed the characteristics of 77 patients with primary hypothyroidism in our hospital. Nine patients (11%) accidentally received statins in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia without diagnosis of hypothyroidism. In such patients, free T4 (FT4) levels were lower, and those of LDH, CK were higher than those in patients not receiving statins. In patients accidentally receiving statins, an inverse correlation between CK and FT4 could not be shown (which was recognized in patients not receiving them). Even after FT4 levels were matched, levels of CK were still higher in the patients accidentally receiving statins. Patients with high CK levels over 1000 U/L were 5 times more frequent (56%) in patients accidentally receiving statins than in those not receiving statins (11%). The present study confirms that statins enhances levels of CK in patients with hypothyroidism. We must not begin and continue to use these drugs without checking the possibility of hypothyroidism.", 
    "155": "Many cardiovascular studies have suggested that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl co-enzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) have anti-inflammatory effects independent of cholesterol lowering. As a chronic inflammatory disease, periodontitis shares some mechanisms with atherosclerosis. Since oral epithelial cells participate importantly in periodontal inflammation, we measured simvastatin effects on interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 production by cultured human epithelial cell line (KB cells) in response to interleukin-1alpha. Simvastatin decreased production, an effect reversed by adding mevalonate or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, but not farnesyl pyrophosphate. Simvastatin was found to reduce NF-kappaB and AP-1 promoter activity in KB cells. Dominant-negative Rac1 severely inhibited interleukin-1alpha-induced NF-kappaB and AP-1 promoter activity. Our results may indicate an anti-inflammatory effect of simvastatin on human oral epithelial cells, apparently involving Rac1 GTPase inhibition.",

    "167": "Mevalonic aciduria (MVA) and hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome (HIDS) represent the two ends of a clinical spectrum of disease caused by deficiency of mevalonate kinase (MVK), the first committed enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis. At least 30 patients with MVA and 180 patients with HIDS have been reported worldwide. MVA is characterized by psychomotor retardation, failure to thrive, progressive cerebellar ataxia, dysmorphic features, progressive visual impairment and recurrent febrile crises. The febrile episodes are commonly accompanied by hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, abdominal symptoms, arthralgia and skin rashes. Life expectancy is often compromised. In HIDS, only febrile attacks are present, but a subgroup of patients may also develop neurological abnormalities of varying degree such as mental retardation, ataxia, ocular symptoms and epilepsy. A reduced activity of MVK and pathogenic mutations in the MVK gene have been demonstrated as the common genetic basis in both disorders. In MVA, the diagnosis is established by detection of highly elevated levels of mevalonic acid excreted in urine. Increased levels of immunoglobulin D (IgD) and, in most patients of immunoglobulin A (IgA), in combination with enhanced excretion of mevalonic acid provide strong evidence for HIDS. The diagnosis is confirmed by low activity of mevalonate kinase or by demonstration of disease-causing mutations. Genetic counseling should be offered to families at risk. There is no established successful treatment for MVA. Simvastatin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, and anakinra have been shown to have beneficial effect in HIDS.",

M. pilosus required a suitable concentration of organic nitrogen peptone for high lovastatin production. As sole carbon source with peptone, although glucose strongly repressed lovastatin production, maltose was responsible for high production. Interestingly, glycerol combined with maltose enhanced lovastatin production, up to 444 mg/l in the most effective case. Moreover, an isolated mutant, in which glucose repression might be relieved, easily produced the highest level of lovastatin, 725 mg/l on glucose-glycerol-peptone medium. These observations indicate that lovastatin production by M. pilosus is regulated by strict glucose repression and that an appropriate release from this repression by optimizing medium composition and/or by a mutation(s) is required for high lovastatin production.",

Dyslipidemia significantly increases risk for atherosclerotic disease and all of its various clinical manifestations. Identifying patients with dyslipidemia and initiating therapies aimed at normalizing the lipid profile has been demonstrated to significantly reduce the risk for myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular mortality in both the primary and secondary prevention settings. Guidelines in Europe, Canada and the USA emphasize the need to reduce the burden of atherogenic lipoproteins in serum and to raise levels of high-density lipoproteins in patients at risk for cardiovascular events. Statins have emerged as front-line therapy for managing dyslipidemia, especially in patients with elevated serum levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. As guidelines emphasize the need to reduce serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to lower levels, goal attainment can be challenging. The use of combination therapy increases the likelihood of therapeutic success for many patients. Furthermore, a significant percentage of patients with dyslipidemia either cannot achieve goals on statin monotherapy, choose not to take a statin or do not tolerate these drugs due to adverse side effects, such as myalgias, weakness or hepatotoxicity. This article summarizes the pharmacology, clinical efficacy and safety of colesevelam hydrochloride, a bile acid-binding resin. Bile acid-binding resins are orally administered anion-exchange resins that are not absorbed systemically. These agents bind bile acids and reduce their reabsorption at the level of the terminal ileum and prevent their enterohepatic recirculation. Colesevelam has a favorable side effect and toxicity profile and significantly impacts serum levels of lipoproteins when used as monotherapy or when used in combination with either statins or ezetimibe.",

ABI was measured in 5,646 Chinese patients at high CV risk, and PAD was defined as an ABI<0.9 in either leg. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with PAD. A total of 5,263 patients were analyzed, 52.9% male, mean age 67.3 years, mean body mass index (BMI) 24.2 kg/m2, mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) 139/80.7 mmHg. The prevalence of PAD in the total group of patients was 25.4%, and the prevalence was higher in females than in males (27.1% vs. 23.9%; odds ratio [OR]: 1.64). Patients with PAD were older than those without PAD (72.3+/-9.9 years vs. 65.6+/-11.7 years; OR: 1.06), and more frequently had diabetes (43.3% vs. 31.3%; OR: 2.02), coronary heart disease (CHD) (27.0% vs. 18.8%; OR: 1.67), stroke (44.4% vs. 28.3%; OR: 1.78), lipid disorders (57.2% vs. 50.7%; OR: 1.3) and a smoking habit (42.7% vs. 38.6%; OR: 1.52). The ORs for the PAD group compared with the non-PAD group demonstrated that these conditions were inversely related to ABI. Statin, angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors and antiplatelet agents were only used in 40.5%, 53.6% and 69.1% of PAD patients, respectively. The data demonstrated the high prevalence and low treatment of PAD in Chinese patients at high CV risk. A lower ABI was associated with generalized atherosclerosis. Based on these findings, ABI should be a routine measurement in high risk patients. Aggressive medication was required in these patients.",

Prospectively collected data on 400 consecutive patients with stable angina pectoris or evidence of inducible myocardial ischemia were analyzed. The incidence of myocardial infarction based on postinterventional release of troponin I>1.5 ng/ml was 12% in the statin pretreated patients and 20% in those not pretreated with statin therapy (P=0.04, odds ratio 1.84, 95% confidence interval 1.06-3.21). Of the patients experiencing a post-PCI troponin elevation>1.5 ng/ml, those pretreated with a statin pre-PCI had a lesser troponin elevation compared with those not receiving a statin pre-PCI (median: 2.9 ng/ml [1.9-11.5] vs 5.0 ng/ml [3.1-8.8]; P<0.001). In the multivariate model, preprocedural statin therapy was identified as the only independent negative predictor of procedure-related myocardial necrosis based on postprocedural troponin elevation. In the 21-month follow-up period, statin pretreated patients were observed to have fewer deaths, revascularizations, or myocardial infarction; however, this difference was not statistically significant. These results suggest that pretreatment with statins in patients undergoing PCI for stable angina pectoris reduces the risk and extent of procedure-related myocardial injury measured by troponin release.",
