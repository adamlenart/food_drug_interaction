    "0": "Statins are microorganism derived drugs that greatly impair the cell synthesis of cholesterol by competitively inhibiting the activity of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. Statins, however lower the blood level of cholesterol chiefly by increasing the number of high affinity receptors that recognize plasma LDL and by diminishing the VLDL synthesis rate in the liver. The latter explains the mild triglyceride reducing effect of these drugs. Statins efficiency in lowering the plasma cholesterol concentration is comparable to that of the bile acid binding polymers, but is better than that of the fibrates and nicotinic acid. Statins are better tolerated than the latter two drugs but are less efficient in lowering plasma triglycerides and in increasing the HDL-cholesterol concentrations. Tissue selectivity varies for the different statins but this is a secondary issue when the rarity of side effects is taken into account. Statins should be prescribed considering solely their pharmacologic efficiency and cost. Coronary angiography studies in coronary heart disease patients treated with placebo as compared to statins alone, or combined to other lipid lowering drugs, indicate that coronary artery disease regression can be achieved by pharmacological means.", 
    "1": "Experimental studies have suggested that the dyslipidemia that frequently accompanies models of progressive renal injury contributes to glomerular and interstitial injury. This concept is supported by experiments demonstrating that while dietary-induced hypercholesterolemia is associated with modest renal injury, in the presence of hypertension or proteinuria, there is a synergistic effect. In addition, strategies to reduce circulating lipids by the use of different classes of antilipemic agents have also significantly ameliorated glomerular injury. The mechanisms whereby lipids contribute to renal injury are still incompletely understood. However, a direct effect of lipids on the biology of mesangial cells has been demonstrated. In addition, evidence supporting a pathogenetic role for oxidatively-modified low density lipoprotein has been developed. Recent experimental studies have also suggested that antilipemic agents, particularly the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A inhibitor class, modify the proliferative response to various mitogenic substances. Together these data provide compelling support that lipids participate in the pathogenesis of progressive renal disease.", 
    "2": "2082 hypercholesterolemic subjects were treated with simvastatin for 12 weeks. In 530 patients the dose was increased after 6 weeks from 10 to 20 mg because of persistently high cholesterol concentrations. Total cholesterol (TC) in the 1552 patients taking 10 mg fell by 1.61 mmol.l-1 (18.4%), LDL cholesterol (LDLC) by 1.53 mmol.l-1 (25.2%), and triglycerides (TG) by 0.13 mmol.l-1 (5.5%); HDL cholesterol (HDLC) significantly increased by 0.05 mmol.l-1 (3.6%). In the 530 patients taking 20 mg TC fell by 1.89 mmol.l-1 (19.9%), LDLC by 1.78 mmol.l-1 (26.0%), and TG by 0.13 mmol.l-1 (5.5%); HDLC increased by 0.05 mmol.l-1 (3.7%). The reductions in TC, LDLC, and TG were positively correlated and the increase in HDLC negatively correlated with their respective baseline values. There were independent significant correlations of the fall in LDLC with sex (MANOVA), baseline TG, and adherence to a lipid-lowering diet. The falls in TG significantly correlated with baseline fructosamine concentrations and dietary adherence. There were 571 adverse events in 16.6% of the patients but no case of myopathy. These results show that simvastatin is usually well tolerated and that its effects on TC and LDLC depend on their baseline concentrations.", 
    "3": "The high prevalence of hypercholesterolemia in kidney transplant recipients probably contributes to the high cardiovascular mortality in these patients. Except for diet, there is no generally recommended cholesterol-lowering treatment. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study with low-dose simvastatin in 40 ciclosporin (CS)-treated kidney transplant recipients during 16 weeks, focusing on side effects and dose finding. In the simvastatin group, the mean serum total and LDL cholesterol concentrations decreased by 23 and 33%, respectively, and the mean serum HDL cholesterol concentration increased by 12%, after 4 weeks of treatment with simvastatin 10 mg daily. Increasing the dose to 20 mg daily in a few patients only resulted in marginal further reductions of the serum cholesterol concentrations at the expense of doubling the plasma simvastatin 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitory activity concentrations. The differences between the changes in the serum cholesterol concentrations in the simvastatin group and the negligible changes in the placebo group were statistically significant. There was no case of proximal myopathy and the serum creatine kinase concentrations did not differ between treatment groups. In conclusion, low-dose simvastatin appears to be a well tolerated and efficacious cholesterol-lowering treatment in CS-treated kidney transplant recipients. Simvastatin 10 mg daily seems to be the most suitable dose for the majority of these patients.", 
    "4": "Simvastatin and pravastatin, two 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, were compared in a multinational, randomized, double-blind trial. Patients demonstrating moderate hypercholesterolemia after 10 weeks on a lipid-lowering diet received 6 weeks of treatment with 5 mg/day simvastatin (n = 143) or 10 mg/day pravastatin (n = 138); the simvastatin dose was increased to 10 mg for an additional 6 weeks while the pravastatin dose remained at 10 mg. When administered at lower or equivalent daily doses, simvastatin was significantly more effective than pravastatin in reducing total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Reductions in plasma total and LDL cholesterol were significantly greater with 5 mg simvastatin (16 and 23%) compared to 10 mg pravastatin (12 and 18%; p < or = 0.01). The efficacy of 10 mg simvastatin in lowering these lipid parameters was also superior (19 vs. 11% and 27 vs. 17%, respectively; p < or = 0.01). At 6 and 12 weeks, a significantly higher percentage of simvastatin patients (45 and 59%, respectively) achieved a desirable LDL cholesterol level of < 130 mg/dl (< 3.4 mmol/l) compared to pravastatin patients (32-33%; p < or = 0.05). Both drugs were well tolerated and had comparable safety profiles.", 
    "5": "Epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between apolipoprotein-(apo)-B containing particles [lipoprotein (Lp) (a), LpE:B; LpC-III:B] and coronary heart disease (CHD). The effect of fluvastatin, a novel competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, on these plasma lipoprotein levels was studied in patients with hypercholesterolaemia after 14 weeks of standard dietary therapy. The results of a placebo-controlled, dose-response study and of the combined data of the European double-blind, controlled studies on the effect of fluvastatin are presented. The patients were selected according to the following criteria of inclusion: plasma low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels > 160 mg dL-1 and premature CHD and/or two associated risk factors, or LDL cholesterol > 190 mg dL-1 and no CHD, plus triglycerides < 300 mg dL-1. All measurements were performed at the Pasteur Institute Central Laboratory. Lp(a), LpE:B and LpC-III:B particles were measured by double-site ELISA. In the placebo-controlled, dose-response study, 429 subjects were randomly assigned to one of the following treatment groups: placebo, fluvastatin 2.5 mg q.p.m., 5 mg q.p.m., 10 mg q.p.m. and 20 mg q.p.m. Treatment with fluvastatin for 6 weeks was associated with a dose-dependent reduction of LDL cholesterol, apoB, LpE:B and LpCIII:B levels. In addition, treatment with fluvastatin 5 mg and 20 mg q.p.m. was associated with a significant reduction in median Lp(a) concentrations (3.2%, P < 0.05 and 6.4%, P < 0.05 respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "6": "In this preliminary report of a 20-week trial, 66 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and hyperlipidaemia who remained eligible after an 8-week dietary stabilization phase were randomly allocated to receive 20 mg of fluvastatin or placebo once daily for 6 weeks. Fluvastatin was subsequently increased to 20 mg twice daily and administered according to the same schedule, versus placebo, for a further 6 weeks. Both dosages of fluvastatin substantially improved serum lipid profiles compared with baseline and placebo. Both dosages of fluvastatin significantly reduced low-density- and very-low-density-lipoprotein (LDL, VLDL), cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) compared with placebo, and both dosages significantly elevated high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The ratio of LDL to HDL was also significantly decreased. Amongst the 58 patients who completed the study, there was no evidence either of myopathy or of hepatotoxicity; mean creatine kinase values remained stable in the fluvastatin arm. Fasting glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin, and fructosamine levels were not markedly affected by active treatment. No serious adverse events attributable to the drug were reported. In conclusion, both dosages of fluvastatin appear to be effective and safe in the management of hyperlipidaemia in this outpatient, maturity-onset, diabetic population.", 
    "7": "The aim of this study was to investigate the new synthetic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, fluvastatin, for efficacy, safety and tolerability in comparison to cholestyramine. One hundred fifty one primary hypercholesterolaemic patients participated in this double-blind, parallel-group, randomized study. During the first 12 weeks of the study, fluvastatin (20 mg and 40 mg daily) was compared with cholestyramine (16 g per day). In the subsequent, 6-week part of the study, the comparative efficacy, safety and tolerability of 20 mg fluvastatin, combined with cholestyramine (4 g, 8 g, or 16 g) were assessed. Fluvastatin (40 mg) reduced LDL cholesterol by 28.0%, triglycerides by 10.5% and increased HDL cholesterol by 3.7%. Cholestyramine (16 g) reduced LDL cholesterol by 35.0%, but raised triglycerides and HDL cholesterol by 12.3% (p < 0.01) and 3.7% respectively. The combination of fluvastatin 20 mg and cholestyramine (4 g, 8 g and 16 g) induced the following reductions in LDL cholesterol: 30.4%, 35.6% and 46.6% respectively. There was no significant change in triglycerides in either group although HDL cholesterol was raised by 4.9%, 8.3% and 7.2% respectively. One patient treated with fluvastatin and two treated with cholestyramine were withdrawn from the study due to elevation of liver transaminases. The most frequent subjective adverse effects in both treatment groups were mild, transient gastrointestinal complaints. Thus, fluvastatin was effective as a lipid-lowering agent; the effect was further enhanced when fluvastatin was combined with cholestyramine.", 
    "8": "Serum ubiquinone levels were studied during long- and short-term treatment with 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors in 17 men with primary non-familial hypercholesterolaemia. The serum ubiquinone levels were determined after the patients had received simvastatin (20-40 mg per day) for 4.7 years, after a 4 week treatment pause and again after they had resumed treatment with lovastatin (20-40 mg per day) for 12 weeks. During the treatment pause the average serum ubiquinone levels increased by 32%; resumption of treatment caused a reduction of 25%. The changes in the levels of ubiquinone and serum total cholesterol as well as those of ubiquinone and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were closely parallel. This suggested that changes in serum ubiquinone reflected changes in cholesterol-containing serum lipoproteins which could serve as carrier vehicles for ubiquinone. After long-term simvastatin treatment and after short-term lovastatin treatment, average serum ubiquinone levels (1.16 and 1.22 mg.l-1, respectively) were similar to that observed in a group of apparently healthy middle-aged men (1.16 mg.l-1).", 
    "9": "The number of investigations involving cell proliferation has increased rapidly in the last years. One of the major difficulties in studying cell-cycle-related events is obtaining highly synchronous cell populations without metabolic imbalance. This study demonstrates that the Madin Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells, a commonly used cell line in veterinary research, can be effectively synchronized using lovastatin (Lov), a drug used to treat hypercholesteremia in humans. This was demonstrated by the following results: (i) Lov inhibits cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner; (ii) Lov synchronizes MDBK cells mainly in the G1 and secondarily in the G2+M cell-cycle phases; (iii) the cytostatic effect of Lov can be specifically inhibited by addition of mevalonate (Mev) (Lov inhibits the synthesis of Mev); (iv) removal of Lov from G1-arrested cultures, followed by addition of Mev, resulted in the synchronous recovery of DNA synthesis; and (v) 5-bromo2'-deoxyuridine incorporation experiments revealed that MDBK cells synchronization by Lov can be followed for at least 3 cycles after removal of Lov and addition of Mev. Furthermore, as an application of investigations based on the availability of synchronized MDBK, we showed that bovine herpesvirus-1 gene expression is independent on the cell cycle.", 
    "10": "A multi-centre, non-randomized clinical study of 12-months' duration was performed in 112 patients with hyperlipidaemia associated with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus to evaluate the clinical efficacy and tolerability of pravastatin and to assess its effect on glycaemic control. Patients were eligible for this trial if they fulfilled the following criteria; a high plasma total cholesterol level greater than 220 mg/dl associated with stable glycaemic control for at least 3-months' observation period. On entry, patients received 10 mg pravastatin per day (5 mg twice daily) for 12 months. Clinical efficacy was evaluated in 108 patients. The results showed that pravastatin induced a significant decrease in serum cholesterol level mainly with LDL-cholesterol. Total cholesterol levels were decreased significantly from 275 +/- 3 mg/dl to 222 +/- 4 mg/dl within 3 months of the start of treatment, and LDL-cholesterol decreased from 192 +/- 4 mg/dl to 137 +/- 4 mg/dl. After 12 months' treatment, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels were 216 +/- 4 mg/dl (p < 0.001) and 137 +/- 5 mg/dl (p < 0.001), respectively. HDL-cholesterol levels were increased from 51 +/- 2 mg/dl to 56 +/- 2 mg/dl at 3 months (p < 0.001) and 55 +/- 2 mg/dl at 12 months (p < 0.01). Triglyceride concentrations were also decreased from 173 +/- 11 mg/dl to 156 +/- 13 mg/dl at 3 months and 137 +/- 10 mg/dl at 12 months (p < 0.01). Fasting plasma glucose and glycated haemoglobin levels were not affected by pravastatin. Adverse events observed in 5 cases were always mild and reversible. These results indicate a clinical usefulness of pravastatin with high compliance in patients with hyperlipidaemia associated with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.", 
    "11": "Twenty two healthy males participated in a randomised, placebo-controlled, double blind, cross-over study to investigate the influence of simvastatin on the pharmacokinetics of ramipril and its active metabolite (ramiprilat), and on the ACE-inhibiting effect of ramiprilat. During two study periods, each of 7 days, subjects received daily either simvastatin 20 mg at 19.00 h or placebo; ramipril (5 mg) was given on Day 5 of each of the periods. Plasma concentrations of ramipril and ramiprilat and ACE-activity were measured in sequential blood specimens, and ramipril and ramiprilat concentrations were measured in urine. Blood and urine collections for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessment were made up to 72 h after the dose of ramipril. The mean AUC of ramipril for ramipril+placebo (R+P) and ramipril+simvastatin (R+S) was 22.2 and 21.3 ng.h.ml-1, respectively; for ramiprilat the corresponding figures were 61.3 and 57.6 ng.h.ml-1. The urinary excretion of ramipril+metabolites for (R+P) and (R+S) was 25.2 and 24.1% of dose. The maximum percentage inhibition of ACE-activity for (R+P) was 94.6%, and for (R+S) it was 94.1%. It is concluded that concomitant administration of simvastatin and ramipril has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics or ACE-inhibition of the latter drug and its metabolites.", 
    "12": "In vitro incubation of human erythrocytes and platelets with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor pravastatin in the concentration range 1 nM to 10 microM did not affect the activity of the Na(+)-K(+)-pump, Na(+)-K(+)-cotransport or Na(+)-Li(+)-countertransport, or the ground membrane leak for Na+ and K+. The data indicate that pravastatin has no direct effect on transmembrane cationic transport systems in red blood cells or platelets.", 
    "13": "Unprocessed p21 Ras proteins microinjected into Xenopus oocytes were radiolabeled by coinjected [3H]farnesyl pyrophosphate, a direct farnesyl donor substrate for all known mammalian farnesyltransferases. Mevinolin, an inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase which reduces the levels of mevalonate and thus farnesyl pyrophosphate, blocked oncogenic H-Rasva112 induced germinal vesicle breakdown in oocytes. This mevinolin caused block was completely reversed by co-injected farnesyl pyrophosphate. The putative farnesyltransferase in Xenopus oocytes was identified to be similar to those found in mammalian cells in that it requires an intact CAAX box motif in addition to the conserved cysteine residue at the fourth position from the C-terminus of Ras proteins for its farnesylating activity. Peptide inhibitors of farnesyltransferase such as CVIM and TKCVIM were shown to inhibit farnesylation of microinjected Ras proteins thereby blocking its function namely the induction of oocyte maturation. These results demonstrate that Xenopus oocytes process bacterially produced mammalian Ras proteins in a manner similar to, if not identical with that in mammalian cells, thus validating the continued use of the Xenopus oocyte system for unraveling the functions of Ras proteins. Furthermore, our results indicate that the oocyte system may be a useful in vivo model for studying the farnesylation of human Ras proteins, its regulation, and the effects of farnesyltransferase inhibitors.", 
    "14": "Serum cholesterol values were insufficiently reduced by pravastatin in two different patient populations. Therefore, we studied whether further cholesterol reduction could be achieved by inhibiting both cholesterol synthesis (by pravastatin) and absorption (by neomycin or sitostanol ester). Thus, we measured serum cholesterol, cholesterol precursors (reflecting cholesterol synthesis), cholestanol and plant sterols (reflecting cholesterol absorption and biliary secretion) for up to 6 weeks in pravastatin-treated patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH, n = 13) and with and without ileal bypass during addition of neomycin (1.5 g per day) and in another patient population of non-FH (n = 14) subjects during addition of sitostanol ester (1.5 g per day). Addition of neomycin lowered serum total, LDL and HDL cholesterol by a further 20%, and increased the pravastatin-lowered precursor:cholesterol ratios by 20% (irrespective of ileal bypass). It also reduced by 20% the plant sterol:cholesterol ratio (irrespective of ileal bypass) which was markedly increased by pravastatin alone. Pravastatin and neomycin in combination lowered total, LDL and HDL cholesterol by 45%, 53% and 17%, respectively. This combined regimen reduced the serum lathosterol:cholesterol ratio to about half of the reduction caused by pravastatin, while the elevation of the plant sterols:cholesterol ratio was less with the combination than with pravastatin alone. Changes in serum cholesterol precursor:cholesterol and plant sterol:cholesterol ratios during the combined treatment were smaller in the subgroup with ileal bypass. Addition of sitostanol ester did not lower serum total or LDL cholesterol nor the precursor:cholesterol ratios significantly, while the reduction observed in the plant sterols:cholesterol ratios was similar to that achieved with neomycin addition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "15": "The therapeutic effects of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor pravastatin on plasma lipids were assessed in an open, prospective, multicenter trial over a treatment period of 3 months. Of a total of 1111 patients, the overall results were calculated from 715 evaluable patients (352 men and 363 women, mean age: 56.1 +/- 11.3 years) with primary isolated hypercholesterolemia (hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa according to Fredrickson) being at high risk for cardiovascular disease according to the classification of the national cholesterol consensus, whose guidelines are distinguishing between three risk levels (low, moderate, and high, respectively) of total-cholesterol (total-c) as well as LDL-c. The treatment period was preceded by a 3-month dietary counselling phase. Treatment with pravastatin significantly reduced total-c (23.8%, p < 0.001), LDL-c (31.9%, p < 0.001) and triglyceride (16.9%, p < 0.001) levels, concomitantly those of HDL-c were significantly raised (15%, p < 0.001). Pravastatin lowered the total-c/HDL-c ratio by nearly 36% from a mean of 8.1 +/- 2.5 to a mean of 5.2 +/- 1.6. At the end 476 patients (66.6%) received the standard dosage of 10 mg/day whereas 140 patients (19.6%) were recorded to take a dose of 20 mg/day. When comparing those patients (n = 456) having maintained consistently a dose of 10 mg pravastatin per day from week 0 to week 12 with patients (n = 113) who received 20 mg/day from week 4 to 12 similar efficacy was observed in both groups (reduction of total-c: 24.5% vs. 22.2%, n.s., reduction of LDL-c: 33.0% vs. 30.0%, n.s.).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "16": "Ubiquinone is a carrier of the mitochondrial respiratory chain which regulates oxidative phosphorylation: it also acts as a membrane stabilizer preventing lipid peroxidation. In man the quinone ring originates from tyrosine, while the formation of the polyisoprenoid lateral chain starts from acetyl CoA and proceeds through mevalonate and isopentenylpyrophosphate; this biosynthetic pathway is the same as the cholesterol one. We therefore performed this study to evaluate whether statins (hypocholesterolemic drugs that inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase) modify blood levels of ubiquinone. Thirty unrelated outpatients with primary hypercholesterolemia (IIa phenotype) were treated with 20 mg of simvastatin for a 3-month period (group S) or with 20 mg of simvastatin plus 100 mg CoQ10 (group US). The following parameters were evaluated at time 0, and at 45 and 90 days: total plasma cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, triglycerides, Apo A1, Apo B and CoQ10 in plasma and in platelets. In the S group, there was a marked decrease in total cholesterol low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and in plasma CoQ10 levels from 1.08 mg/dl to 0.80 mg/dl. In contrast, in the US group we observed a significant increase of plasma CoQ10 (from 1.20 to 1.48 mg/dl) while the hypocholesterolemic effect was similar to that observed in the S group. Platelet CoQ10 also decreased in the S group (from 104 to 90 ng/mg) and increased in the US group (from 95 to 145 ng/mg).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "17": "The side-chain moiety of coenzyme Q is synthesized by a trans-prenyltransferase present in microsomes. Condensation of this moiety with the precursor ring takes place in the Golgi system. The enzymes involved, as well as the cytosolic geranylgeranyl-PP synthase, are regulated in an independent fashion. When the size of the farnesyl-PP pool is decreased or increased by employing appropriate inhibitors, the rate of CoQ synthesis is modified accordingly, indicating the dependence of trans-prenyltransferase activity on the level of intracellular substrate concentrations. Administration of peroxisome proliferators elevates CoQ concentrations not only in blood, but also in various tissues. Thus, it may be possible in the future to selectively increase CoQ concentrations in certain organs, without increasing the level of cholesterol.", 
    "18": "Alcohol metabolism may result in oxidant stress and free radical injury through a variety of mechanisms. Lovastatin may also produce oxidant stress by reducing levels of an endogenous antioxidant, coenzyme Q (CoQ). The separate and combined effects of ethanol, 20 EN% in a total liquid diet, and lovastatin, 67 mg/kg diet, on alpha-tocopherol, retinol palmitate, CoQ9 and thiobarbituric acid reactive (TBAR) material in liver from rats were determined. The effect of exogenous CoQ10 on these treatment groups was also determined. Food consumption, weight gain, liver lipid and TBAR material were similar between treatment groups. Compared to control animals, ethanol reduced retinol palmitate significantly, from 143 to 90 micrograms/g wet weight. Lovastatin had no effect on retinal palmitate nor did it act additively with ethanol. Ethanol decreased liver alpha-tocopherol from 28 to 12 micrograms/g wet weight and lovastatin diminished it to 12 micrograms; no additive effect was evident. Ethanol had no effect, but lovastatin decreased CoQ9 from 83 to 55 micrograms/g wet weight. Supplementation with CoQ10 did not modulate the effect of ethanol on retinal palmitate, but it did reverse the effect of lovastatin on CoQ9. Supplementary CoQ10 did not alter control levels of alpha-tocopherol, but it appeared to reverse most of the decrease in alpha-tocopherol attributable to ethanol or lovastatin separately. It only partially reversed the effect of ethanol and lovastatin combined on alpha-tocopherol, however. As expected, lovastatin had no effect on CoQ10 levels in supplemented animals. Ethanol, either separately or in combination with lovastatin, diminished liver stores of CoQ10 by almost 40%. We conclude that 20 EN% ethanol given in a liquid diet for 5 weeks is sufficient to lower retinol palmitate and that lovastatin reduces CoQ9. Both diminish alpha-tocopherol, an effect largely overcome by CoQ10 supplementation with either drug alone, but not with the combination. Since many individuals chronically consume the levels of ethanol represented by this experiment, and since a certain number of those also take lovastatin, further research into the possible clinical significance of these observations is warranted.", 
    "19": "The biosynthetic pathway of the CoQ polyisoprenoid side chain, starting from acetyl-CoA and proceeding through mevalonate and isopentenylpyrophosphate, is the same as that of cholesterol. We performed this study to evaluate whether vastatins (hypocholesterolemic drugs that inhibit HMG-CoA reductase) modify blood levels of ubiquinone. Thirty-four unrelated outpatients with hypercholesterolemia (IIa phenotype) were treated with 20 mg of simvastatin for a 6-month period (group S) or with 20 mg of simvastatin plus 100 mg CoQ10 (group US). The following parameters were evaluated at time 0, 45, 90, 135 and 180 days: total plasma cholesterol (TC), HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG), apo A1, apo B and CoQ10 in plasma and platelets. In the S group, there was a marked decrease in TC and LDL-C (from 290.3 mg/dl to 228.7 mg/dl for TC and from 228.7 mg/dl to 167.6 mg/dl for LDL-C) and in plasma CoQ10 levels from 1.08 mg/dl to 0.80 mg/dl. In contrast, in the US group we observed a significant increase of CoQ10 in plasma (from 1.20 to 1.48 mg/dl) while the hypocholesterolemic effect was similar to that observed in the S group. Platelet CoQ10 also decreased in the S group (from 104 to 90 ng/mg) and increased in the US group (from 95 to 145 ng/mg). This study demonstrates that simvastatin lowers both LDL-C and apo B plasma levels together with the plasma and platelet levels of CoQ10, and that CoQ10 therapy prevents both plasma and platelet CoQ10 decrease, without affecting the cholesterol lowering effect of simvastatin.", 
    "20": "The effects of pravastatin, a potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, on serum lipids and lipoproteins were studied in 86 patients (36 premenopausal and 50 postmenopausal women) suffering from primary hypercholesterolemia. The effects of this lipid-lowering drug on serum gonadotropins and sex steroids are also reported. Pravastatin produced a mean reduction in serum total cholesterol (T-CHO) of 24.7%, triglyceride (TG) of 30.0%, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-CHO) of 36.0% after treatment for three months. The drug also produced a mean increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-CHO) of 1.4% after three months. Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), and testosterone (T) levels were not significantly changed from pre-therapy levels in either pre- or post-menopausal women after treatment for six months. Pravastatin is well-tolerated for six months and is a very effective lipid lowering agent with no effects on the biosynthesis of sex steroids. These findings suggest that pravastatin can be used for treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia in women around menopause.", 
    "21": "Lipid abnormalities have been implicated in the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis in experimental models of kidney disease. In previous studies it has been shown that Adriamycin-induced nephropathy is associated with reduced activities of glomerular proteinases. This observation led to the hypothesis that reduced proteolytic activities may be responsible for mesangial protein accumulation, which ultimately leads to global sclerosis of the glomerular tuft. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether lovastatin treatment, which prevents progressive glomerulosclerosis in experimental nephrotic syndrome, would also have an effect on glomerular proteinase activities. Adriamycin administration resulted in a persistent nephrotic syndrome with gross proteinuria (377 +/- 26 mg/24 h), hypoalbuminemia (2.1 +/- 0.12 vs. 2.8 +/- 0.02 g/dl), hypercholesterolemia (575 +/- 74 vs. 68 +/- 1.5 mg/dl) and elevated triglyceride levels (1,155 +/- 78 vs. 57 +/- 8 mg/dl). Glomerular azocaseinolytic activities both at pH 5.4 (-21%) and 7.4 (-37%) were significantly reduced. In contrast to human subjects, nephrotic rats that were treated with lovastatin displayed reduced triglyceride levels (767 +/- 134 mg/dl); their serum cholesterol, however, remained unchanged. In terms of glomerular proteolytic enzyme activities, the decline in azocaseinolysis at both pH values was, at least partly, prevented by lovastatin. On the basis of these data, it appears that the beneficial effect of lovastatin on the evolution of glomerulosclerosis in the nephrotic rat is associated with the conservation of glomerular proteolytic activities.", 
    "22": "150 patients suffering from primary hypercholesterolemia were divided into three different groups receiving (1) lovastatin, (2) simvastatin, or (3) fenofibrate as controls. The aim of the study was to detect possible drug-induced ocular side effects, especially in the lens. The study period was 2 years. Ophthalmological examination and Scheimpflug photography were performed at the beginning and every 6 months. Increases or decreases in the visual acuity were distributed very similarly in the three groups. Definite evidence of side effects was not found, nor was there evidence of deleterious effects on refraction. The intraocular pressure revealed intraindividual fluctuations without clinical significance. Many changes were observed in the lens, all were minimal, including those of the extreme lens periphery which had no effect on visual acuity. The present study shows the great value of Scheimpflug photography with densitometric image analyses because of its objectivity when compared with other methods. Our observations provide good evidence that lovastatin and simvastatin have no undesirable toxic effects on the lens and other ocular tissues, compared with fenofibrate.", 
    "23": "Familial xanthomatous hypercholesterolemia is a metabolic disorder associated with high LDL levels attributed to a familial defect in LDL receptor activity. We have previously shown that hyperlipoproteinemia of WHHL rabbits, considered to be a model for heritable hypercholesterolemia, was at least partly of exogenous origin. We have though studied retinyl palmitate (RP) levels 12 h after a standardized mixed meal as a simple test to detect abnormalities of intestinal-derived lipoprotein clearance in 22 familial hypercholesterolemic patients with xanthomatosis (13 of them treated by simvastatin, an HMGCoA reductase inhibitor, and 9 not treated), as compared to a control group (n = 12). Total and LDL cholesterol, plasma triglyceride and apo B levels were significantly higher in patients when compared to controls. Mean RP levels appeared higher in familial hypercholesterolemic patients, when compared to controls, with 6 among 22 patients showing clearly high vitamin A levels and 4 borderline values, whereas high triglyceride levels (> 2 g/l) were detected in only 1 patient. No patients within the group with high vitamin A levels showed an apo E2/E2 phenotype. Vitamin A levels correlated with plasma triglycerides in the whole group of subjects (r = 0.50, p < 0.05). No difference was observed in vitamin A distribution between treated and untreated hypercholesterolemic patients. Our results indicate that the clearance of RP-labeled intestinal lipoproteins is delayed in some xanthomatous familial hypercholesterolemic patients as compared with that of controls. These findings suggest that familial xanthomatous hypercholesterolemia may be heterogenous concerning physiopathological mechanisms inducing hyperlipidemia.",

In this report we confirmed that the endogenous synthesis of cholesterol within cells was markedly increased in NPC fibroblasts and those transformed by origin-defective simian virus 40. The transformed fibroblasts and those of the primary culture were hypersensitive to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors as a consequence of their dependence on endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis. The transformed fibroblasts should help further biochemical and genetic research in this condition.",

Seven other groups were shifted to a normal diet and received a drug(s) or placebo for the second 12 weeks. The high dose of etidronate (3 mg/kg/day) with lovastatin (6 mg/kg/day) significantly reduced the percent of aortic atherosclerotic lesions [56 +/- 21 vs. 77 +/- 17% (mean +/- SD), p < 0.05] in the regression study. Compared to the control groups for etidronate and lovastatin, the high or low dose (0.15 mg/kg/day) of etidronate significantly reduced aortic standardized plaque volume per unit (18.7 +/- 7.9 or 18.8 +/- 9.1 vs. 28.4 +/- 11.8 mm.%, p < 0.05). Lovastatin reduced pulmonary artery maximum plaque thickness (0.13 +/- 0.10 vs. 0.23 +/- 0.11 mm, p < 0.05). There were no differences in serum lipid and calcium levels in the control and treated groups. The high dose of etidronate inhibited bone mineralization as expected, whereas the low dose of etidronate did not. These data suggest that etidronate with lovastatin can regress aortic atherosclerosis in the cholesterol-fed rabbit placed on a normal diet.", 
    "26": "The effect of pravastatin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, on the metabolism of human low density lipoprotein (LDL) was examined in guinea pigs. Pravastatin treatment significantly reduced plasma levels of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol by 15.6 mg/dl (38.8%) and 12.7 mg/dl (42.9%), respectively. We investigated the metabolism of LDL in pravastatin-treated and untreated guinea pigs using the simultaneous intravenous injection of 131I-labeled LDL and 125I-labeled, galactose-treated LDL to quantify the LDL receptor pathway. Pravastatin increased the fractional catabolic rate (FCR) of the LDL receptor-dependent pathway. The treatment with pravastatin did not alter the FCR of the LDL receptor-independent pathway. The FCR of the LDL receptor-dependent pathway was higher for LDL isolated from pravastatin-treated subjects than for LDL isolated from control subjects. These findings suggest that pravastatin mainly reduced plasma cholesterol levels by accelerated FCR of the LDL receptor-mediated pathway.",

These drugs were given under different trade names and reintroduced successively leading to acute episodes. Total withdrawal of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors was followed by clinical normalization.", 
    "29": "This case confirmed the theoretical contraindication for the use of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors in patients with porphyria. The risk of revealing porphyria with this type of cholesterol lowering drugs is emphasized. Since these drugs are used very frequently, similar cases may well be reported soon.",

To this purpose, sterol synthesis from 14C-acetate, cell multiplication and reverse transcriptase activity have been measured in parallel at various times after cell infection by HIV-1. It was found that nine days after viral loading, lovastatin inhibited both sterol synthesis and viral multiplication as assessed by the reverse transcriptase activity. Since HIV infection has been shown to induce alterations in membrane cholesterol content, suggesting that the virus cycle may be partially dependent upon cellular cholesterol, inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis could be an interesting way of research in order to slower HIV propagation.", 
    "31": "Women with primary hypercholesterolaemia are often considered for lipid-lowering drug therapy at a later age than men. With regard to the prevention of cardiovascular morbidity, women can expect to receive the same benefits from lipid-lowering treatment as men. Thus, it is of interest to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the new lipid-lowering agent fluvastatin in women. A retrospective analysis was made on the basis of data from controlled clinical trials in which 1815 patients were treated with fluvastatin at a daily dose of > or = 20 mg, and 783 patients received placebo. 782 of the fluvastatin-treated patients (43.1%) and 315 patients on placebo (40.2%) were women. Within these groups, 577 patients (73.8%) treated with fluvastatin and 183 patients receiving placebo (78.4%) were at least 50 years of age. The effect of fluvastatin 40 mg/day on low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was more favourable in women than in men. In women, the change from baseline was -26.7% for LDL cholesterol and 5.3% for HDL cholesterol. In men, the equivalent changes from baseline were -23.8% and 4.0%, respectively. All changes from baseline were highly significant (p < 0.001). Fluvastatin lowered triglycerides to a similar extent in women and men (7.1% vs 6.9%, respectively). More women than men experienced a confirmed increase in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) when receiving fluvastatin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

After a 4-week single-blind placebo period, 22 elderly women (mean age 68 +/- 5 years) with primary hypercholesterolaemia [low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol > 160 mg/dl] were enrolled in the trial. Fluvastatin 40 mg was administered once in the evening. At baseline, and after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoproteins B (apo B) and A-I (apo A-I) were measured. Safety and tolerability were assessed by monitoring routine laboratory parameters and by recording spontaneously reported side effects. The mean (+/- SD) baseline total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL cholesterol, apo B and apo A-I levels were 325 +/- 43, 236 +/- 43, 128 +/- 56, 61 +/- 16, 221 +/- 60 and 164 +/- 28 mg/dl, respectively. After 6 weeks, fluvastatin significantly (p < 0.001, ANOVA test) reduced total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and apo B levels by 22%, 29% and 23%, respectively. These significant reductions were already reached at week 3 (total cholesterol, -21%; LDL cholesterol, -27%). The total cholesterol: HDL cholesterol ratio was reduced by 22% at week 3 and by 21% at week 6 (from 5.3 to 4.2). 78% of the patients showed a reduction > or = 20% for LDL cholesterol.

    "33": "Hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors are potent cholesterol reducing agents that have been successfully used for the treatment of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). A recent investigation revealed that several constitutional and genetic factors significantly determined the response of plasma lipids and lipoproteins to the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor fluvastatin. Gender has been identified through multivariate analysis as a major determinant of the plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol response. The current analysis was undertaken to determine possible gender-related fluvastatin dose-response differences. The analysis revealed that for HDL cholesterol, gender-related differences reach statistical significance only at the highest fluvastatin dose of 40 mg/day (females 22.9%, males 12.9%, p < 0.01). In parallel, the change in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol: HDL cholesterol ratio, an indicator of ischaemic heart disease risk, was also found to be affected by gender (females -38.4%, males -32.2%, p < 0.01). For LDL cholesterol, no consistent gender-related differences were found. In conclusion, the response of plasma lipid levels to fluvastatin in heterozygote FH patients is significantly affected by gender, with females achieving a more marked overall response, as indicated by higher HDL cholesterol levels and a lower LDL cholesterol: HDL cholesterol ratio.", 
    "34": "We assessed the antiproliferative effect of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and lovastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, alone and in combination, on two murine tumor cell lines. Recombinant TNF-alpha inhibited proliferation of murine MmB16 melanoma cells in a concentration-dependent fashion but stimulated growth of murine L1210 leukemia cells at 0.1 ng/ml concentration. Lovastatin inhibited proliferation both of murine MmB16 melanoma cells and of murine L1210 leukemia cells in a concentration-dependent fashion. In combination with tumor necrosis factor alpha lovastatin inhibited synergistically growth of both cell lines as assessed by isobologram analysis. Our data show that lovastatin, a cholesterol synthesis inhibitor, introduced to the clinic to treat hypercholesterolemia, used either as a single or in combination with TNF-alpha inhibits growth of MmB16 melanoma and L1210 leukemia cells.", 
    "35": "The effects of the protein-synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide on 25-hydroxycholesterol-mediated suppression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase mRNA levels were evaluated in the baby-hamster kidney cell line C100. Cells cultured in medium supplemented with delipidized fetal bovine serum and 25 microM lovastatin for 12-24 h had a 5-fold higher level of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA than cells grown in medium supplemented with non-delipidized fetal bovine serum (FBS). The higher level was due to increased transcription, as determined by run-on assays with isolated nuclei. Addition of 25-hydroxycholesterol to lovastatin-treated cells lowered HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels within 4 h of treatment to those of cells grown in FBS-supplemented medium. This decrease was due in part to a decrease in gene transcription. Cycloheximide added in conjunction with 25-hydroxycholesterol to lovastatin-treated cells blocked the suppression of mRNA levels, but did not block oxysterol-mediated suppression of transcription. In addition, cycloheximide added to cells grown in FBS-supplemented medium rapidly increased mRNA levels by 10-fold relative to untreated cells, with no comparable increase in transcription. No comparable increase in either the mRNA level or rate of transcription for beta-actin was observed under such conditions. These results indicate that cycloheximide specifically stabilizes HMG-CoA reductase mRNA in the presence of oxysterols and suggests that continuous synthesis of a short lived protein regulator is required for oxysterol-mediated suppression of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA at a post-transcriptional level.", 
    "36": "The role of isoprenylation in formyl peptide receptor-mediated G protein activation was studied using plasma membranes isolated from normal HL-60 granulocytes and from cells in which isoprenylation was inhibited with mevastatin. Plasma membrane expression of formyl peptide receptors and G protein beta subunits, but not alpha i2 and alpha i3, was significantly reduced by inhibition of isoprenylation. This reduced expression resulted in impaired basal and fMet-Leu-Phe-stimulated G protein activation.", 
    "37": "Data delineating the relationship between disorders of cholesterol metabolism and elevated blood pressure (BP) do not exist. We postulated that mevalonate, the metabolic precursor of endogenous cholesterol and the direct product of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, was a contributing factor for the maintenance of vascular tone and systemic BP. We conducted in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro experiments in normotensive and hypertensive rats, where exogenous mevalonate and lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, were used, respectively, to increase or limit mevalonate availability. Mevalonate decreased BP in the whole animal without significant change in plasma cholesterol. Incubation of aortas with mevalonate attenuated their reactivity to norepinephrine and increased their response to endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxing factors. Lovastatin, in contrast, had the opposite effect in vivo and in vitro: it increased BP, enhanced vascular response to norepinephrine, and impaired endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxations. Neither agent modified cholesterol vascular content. Alteration of vascular reactivity was also observed in resistance vessels from animals pretreated with lovastatin. Our findings suggest that mevalonate availability is an unrecognized metabolic contributor to vascular tone and BP. They imply that (i) metabolites of the mevalonate pathway other than cholesterol could potentially control vascular functions and cardiovascular hemodynamics, (ii) elevated arterial pressure could be in part the consequence of primary disorders of this pathway, and (iii) pharmacological inhibition of mevalonate production as a means to lower plasma cholesterol may have an adverse impact on other cardiovascular risk factors, such as BP.", 
    "38": "Lovastatin is a widely used anticholesterolemic drug which exercises its effect by inhibiting hepatic cholesterol synthesis and up-regulating low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors. In the present study, we determined that the drug has no adverse effects on the expression of three cell surface antigens of human monocytes, i.e. high affinity Fc receptors (Fc gamma RI), low affinity Fc receptors (Fc gamma RII) and CD14 antigen. We have shown previously these antigens are regulated by cholesterol and lipoproteins. At 0.5 micrograms/mL of culture medium, lovastatin did not reduce the percentage of receptor-positive cells or the average number of receptor molecules per cell. These observations add to the attractiveness of the drug as an anticholesterolemic agent and also indicate that endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis by monocytes is not required for expression of Fc gamma RI, Fc gamma RII, or CD14.", 
    "39": "Previous reports have suggested that the rate of de novo cholesterol synthesis in the adult vertebrate retina is extremely slow. We investigated cholesterol biosynthesis in the adult rat retina in vivo, following intravitreal injection of [3H]acetate. HPLC analysis of retinal non-saponifiable lipid extracts revealed co-elution of radioactivity with endogenous cholesterol mass within 4.5 h post-injection. Incorporation of [3H]acetate into cholesterol was markedly reduced by co-injection of known inhibitors of the cholesterol pathway. In contrast to previous results with retinas from other species, no radiolabel or mass corresponded to squalene, except in lipid extracts from retinas treated with NB-598, a squalene epoxidase inhibitor. These results demonstrate, for the first time, the capacity of the adult vertebrate retina to rapidly synthesize cholesterol de novo.", 
    "40": "Very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) are heterogeneous, triglyceride-rich particles that are precursors of low density lipoproteins (LDL). Before conversion to LDL, the majority of VLDL are irreversibly cleared from plasma by uncertain mechanisms. To investigate one potential mechanism for VLDL clearance, we studied the ability of LDL receptors to mediate VLDL uptake in vitro. Small, intermediate, and large VLDL from normolipidemic humans were found to bind and undergo catabolism via LDL receptors on normal human fibroblasts. Binding to cell surfaces was up-regulated by lovastatin, an inducer of LDL receptors. Both LDL and a monoclonal antibody against the LDL receptor (IgG-C7) prevented binding of 125I-VLDL. Also, VLDL binding to mutant fibroblasts lacking LDL receptors was low. Thus, LDL receptors mediated VLDL interactions with cells. Binding affinity decreased near saturation, and the apparent number of high affinity sites decreased with increasing VLDL particle size. Because LDL receptors are small (M(r) 115,000) relative to VLDL (M(r) 9-24 x 10(6)) and are clustered in clathrin-coated pits, these findings suggest that steric hindrance becomes an important binding determinant near saturation and are consistent with a lattice model for LDL receptor-ligand interactions. The capacity for cellular catabolism of VLDL decreased with increasing particle size, consistent with a lattice model. The lattice model was also supported by differences between 125I-VLDL binding to cell surfaces and binding to partially purified LDL receptors in solid-phase assays in which steric constraints resulting from clustering in clathrin-coated pits are not present. In both cell-surface and solid-phase assays, VLDL bound via apoE, not apoB-100. Our studies establish that normal VLDL interact with LDL receptors and that steric hindrance due to crowding of particles on clustered LDL receptors is an important determinant of their binding and catabolism. These findings suggest that LDL receptors may participate in normal VLDL clearance in vivo.", 
    "41": "There is a presumed association between cellular cholesterol and sphingomyelin metabolism. To study this relationship in the intestine, the activity of the rate controlling enzyme of sphingolipid synthesis, serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), and the biosynthesis of long-chain bases were characterized in cultured human intestinal cells, CaCo-2. Cells were then incubated with substances known to alter cholesterol biosynthesis, and the effect of these mediators on SPT activity and long-chain base synthesis was determined and compared with their effects on HMG-CoA reductase activity and cholesterol synthesis. The polar sterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, the squalene epoxide inhibitor, U18666A, and the inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, lovastatin, all significantly inhibited the synthesis of cholesterol without altering either SPT activity or long-chain base synthesis. Mevalonate, which increased cholesterol production 3-fold, also had no affect on SPT activity or sphingoid base synthesis. Serine, which significantly increased the synthesis of long-chain bases, did not alter cholesterol biosynthesis. Moreover, the suicide inhibitors of SPT, beta-chloroalanine and cycloserine, did not alter cholesterol synthesis while markedly decreasing long chain base synthesis. Cells were incubated with palmitic, oleic, linoleic, and eicosapentaenoic acids. Only palmitic acid, the preferred substrate for SPT, increased the production of long-chain bases. Both palmitic and oleic acids, however, increased the synthesis of cholesterol. Cells enriched in sphingomyelin had higher rates of synthesis of both cholesterol and long-chain bases compared to their controls. In contrast, cholesterol and long-chain base syntheses were significantly decreased in cells enriched in cholesterol. Control cells incubated with phospholipid liposomes alone had higher rates of synthesis of both lipids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "42": "The transport mechanism of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors through the blood-brain barrier was studied in vitro by using primary cultures of bovine brain capillary endothelial cells (BCEC). The uptake of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors with the lactone form, [14C]lovastatin and [14C]simvastatin, was slightly decreased to 65% of the control uptake (37 degrees C) at low temperature (4 degrees C) and was not affected by pretreatment of the BCEC with metabolic inhibitors (2,4-dinitrophenol and rotenone). [14C]Simvastatin acid (the lactone ring-opened form) was taken up in a markedly temperature- and concentration-dependent fashion, whereas the uptake of [14C] pravastatin was negligible. At pH below 7.4, the uptake rate of [14C]simvastatin acid by the BCEC increased markedly with decreasing medium pH, whereas almost pH-independent uptake was observed in the presence of 1 mM simvastatin acid. Additional studies using an in situ rat brain perfusion method showed that the in vivo cerebrovascular permeation of [14C]simvastatin acid in rats was significantly inhibited in the presence of 1 mM simvastatin acid, demonstrating that the transport system for the acid forms of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors functions under in vivo conditions. Several monocarboxylic acids significantly inhibited the uptake of [14C]simvastatin acid by the BCEC, whereas dicarboxylic acids did not. The uptake of [14C]simvastatin acid by the BCEC was competitively inhibited by 15 mM acetic acid. Accordingly, we concluded that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in lactone form are transported via simple diffusion, whereas those having an acid form are transported across the blood-brain barrier via a carrier-mediated transport mechanism for monocarboxylic acids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "43": "Oncogenes and oncosuppressors can deregulate cell replication in tumours, and recently have been shown to influence the probability of apoptosis. The effects of human c-myc and mutated (T24) Ha-ras oncogenes on susceptibility to apoptosis were investigated by introducing them into immortalised rat fibroblasts. The resulting family of transfectants showed closely similar measures of proliferation, but widely divergent rates of apoptosis, differing by up to fifteen-fold, that correlated inversely with population expansion rates in vitro. T24-ras transfectants with moderate or high p21ras expression showed reduced apoptosis, and this was reversed by pharmacological inhibition of membrane localisation of p21ras by mevinolin. In contrast, c-myc stimulated apoptosis, and this was further enhanced by serum deprivation. Inducibility of effector proteins represents one possible mechanism of genetic control of the susceptibility to apoptosis, and its investigation showed that c-myc was associated with expression by viable cells of latent calcium/magnesium sensitive endonuclease activity characteristic of apoptosis. In contrast, endonuclease activity was not detected in viable cells of a T24-ras transfectant expressing high levels of p21ras. Thus, there appeared to be differential regulation of susceptibility to apoptosis, positively by c-myc and negatively by activated ras, and this was associated with availability of endonuclease activity. Genetic modulation of apoptosis in human neoplasms is likely to influence net growth rate, retention of cells acquiring new mutations and response to certain chemotherapeutic agents.", 
    "44": "The interaction of LDL and LDL subfractions from a patient homozygous for familial defective apoB-100 (FDB) has been studied. His LDL cholesterol ranged from 2.65 to 3.34 g/liter. In cultured fibroblasts, binding, internalization, and degradation of the patient's LDL was diminished, but not completely abolished. The patient's apolipoprotein E concentration was low, and the amount of apolipoprotein E associated with LDL was not elevated over normal. LDL were separated into six subfractions: LDL-1 (1.019-1.031 kg/liter), LDL-2 (1.031-1.034 kg/liter), LDL-3 (1.034-1.037 kg/liter), LDL-4 (1.037-1.040 kg/liter), LDL-5 (1.040-1.044 kg/liter), and LDL-6 (> 1.044 kg/liter). LDL-5 and LDL-6 selectively accumulated in the patient's plasma. Concentrations of LDL-1 to 3 were normal. The LDL receptor-mediated uptake of LDL-1 and LDL-2 could not be distinguished from normal LDL. LDL-3 and LDL-4 displayed reduced uptake; LDL-5 and LDL-6 were completely defective in binding. When apolipoprotein E-containing particles were removed by immunoabsorption before preparing subfractions, LDL-3 and LDL-4, but not LDL-1 and LDL-2, retained some receptor binding activity. We conclude that in FDB, LDL-1 and LDL-2 contain sufficient apolipoprotein E to warrant normal cellular uptake. In LDL-3 and LDL-4, the defective apoB-100 itself displays some receptor binding; LDL-5 and LDL-6 are inable to interact with LDL receptors and accumulate in plasma.",

The maximal relaxation induced by bradykinin was 80 +/- 38% in the controls and 103 +/- 40% in subjects with hypercholesterolemia (P = .08). Responsiveness to bradykinin was also determined after infusion of indomethacin (5.4 micrograms/min), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, to block the contribution of prostaglandins; maximal responsiveness was greater in hypercholesterolemic subjects (112 +/- 41%) than in controls (81 +/- 31%) (P = .03). Hypercholesterolemic subjects were more sensitive to bradykinin, with an ED50 of 4.2 ng/min versus 10.9 ng/min in controls (P = .05); a similarly increased sensitivity was found in the presence of indomethacin. The response to a maximally effective dose of nitroglycerin was greater in hypercholesterolemic subjects (142 +/- 31%) versus 106 +/- 28% in controls (P = .007).

All were counseled in diet and randomized to intensive therapy: colestipol 10 g TID plus either niacin 1 g QID or lovastatin 20 mg BID or to conventional therapy: placebos, or colestipol if low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was elevated. End points included quantitative arteriographic disease change and clinical events over a 2.5-year interval. At baseline, symptomatic and asymptomatic patients had comparable risk profiles, but proximal stenosis severity averaged 36% for symptomatic and 23% for asymptomatic patients (P < .001). Among the 91 symptomatic patients, those in the intensive group experienced definite (> or = 10%S) proximal lesion progression less frequently than conventional (24% of intensive versus 48% of conventional) and definite regression more frequently (36% of intensive versus 15% of conventional) (P = .009). Similarly, among the 29 asymptomatic patients, 19% of intensive versus 38% of conventional had progression and 31% of intensive versus 0% of conventional, regression (P = .04). Ischemia on baseline exercise tolerance testing was associated with significantly greater proximal disease progression among the asymptomatic patients.

    "51": "Signals that modulate LH-releasing hormone (LHRH) pulse frequency are fundamental mechanisms for regulating important reproductive processes. Gonadal steroids are presently considered to account for the entire gonadal feedback mechanism that modulates LHRH secretion. However, we have previously suggested that a testicular protein(s) present in charcoal-treated rete testis fluid (ctRTF) can suppress LH pulsatility in the ram. The present experiments were aimed at determining whether the disappearance of LH pulses induced by ctRTF administration implicate a hypothalamic or a pituitary site of action. Thus, we have examined the effects of ctRTF peripheral administration on 1) the LH response to LHRH, 2) LHRH portal blood levels, and 3) LHRH content in hypothalamic tissue. Finally, the effects of ctRTF administered into the third ventricle on plasma LH levels were assessed. The present results show that a testicular protein(s) is able to suppress LHRH pulse frequency without affecting amplitude and without any effect on the LH response to LHRH (LHRH Statin). The observation that an active dose administered by the intracerebroventricular route is 0.0005 the active dose needed by the peripheral route reinforces this evidence. These data lead to the new concept that the testicular signals that govern LHRH pulse frequency may be not only steroids, but also proteins.",

The values of serum cholesterol decreased (from 242 +/- 12 to 207 +/- 22; mg/dl), and of high density lipoprotein (HDL) increased (from 42.3 +/- 8.8 to 45.3 +/- 9.2; mg/dl) significantly (p < 0.05, respectively) 10.2 weeks in mean after medication with pravastatin sodium. The whole blood viscosity, at every shear rate examined, corrected blood viscosity, for the standard hematocrit level of 45%, and plasma fibrinogen decreased significantly (p < 0.05, respectively) at the same time, without showing significant differences any more 10.2 weeks in mean after medication with those in 14 elderly normal subjects (mean age: 56.7 y.o.), which suggested that the hemorheological parameters in patients with primary hyperlipoproteinemia had improved significantly by medication with pravastatin sodium.", 
    "54": "Patients with ischemic heart disease are often affected by a mixed hyperlipoproteinemia, where a hypercholesterolemia of various severity is accompanied by slight or moderate hypertriglyceridemia (type IIb dyslipidemia). Current epidemiologic evidence suggests that hypertriglyceridemia has not to be disregarded, particularly in certain subgroups of patients. We evaluated the effect of the association of simvastatin 10 mg/day [an hydroxymethyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor] and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n3-PUFA) in comparison with simvastatin 10 mg/day alone. The subjects undergoing the study were affected by coronary artery disease and showed hypercholesterolemia (LDL-cholesterol > 160 mg/dl) and moderate hypertriglyceridemia (serum triglycerides 200-400 mg/dl) after 2 months of moderate dietary therapy for hyperlipidemia (Step 1 of the National Cholesterol Education Program [NCEP]). Thirty-nine patients were randomized to have 1 of 2 scheduled treatments. At the same time the patients underwent severe dietary therapy for hyperlipidemia (Step 2 of the NCEP). After 3 months of treatment, total-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides were significantly lower than basal values in both groups (p < 0.05). Total-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides were lower in the group treated with n3-PUFA and simvastatin compared to simvastatin alone. However, only for triglycerides was the difference significant (-39.99% in patients treated with n3-PUFA and simvastatin versus -25.65% in patients treated with simvastatin alone, particularly in the first group of 35.85%; p < 0.05). With regard to HDL-cholesterol, the differences between the basal values and the 2 groups of treatments were non significant. Remarkable side effects were not observed in the 2 groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "55": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors simvastatin, fluvastatin and fluvastatin enantiomers (0.1 to 5 microM) were utilized to block both mevalonate formation and cholesterol esterification in mouse peritoneal macrophages in the presence of a large excess of cholesterol supplied by acetylated LDL. Supplementation of cultures with mevalonate fully reversed, in a dose-dependent manner, the inhibitory effect of the drugs on cholesterol esterification. Mevalonate alone, in the range of the tested concentrations, did not affect cholesterol esterification in the absence of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, indicating that its effect was linked to the restoration of the endogenous pool depleted by the pharmacological block of HMG-CoA reductase. The inhibitory effect of fluvastatin was also prevented by the non-sterol mevalonate isoprenoid derivative geranylgeraniol. Evaluation of fluvastatin enantiomers demonstrated the stereospecificity of drug action with most of the effect associated to the antipode with the highest inhibitory activity of HMG-CoA reductase. We conclude that mevalonate or a mevalonate product(s), possibly a non-sterol derivative(s), are required in cholesterol esterification induced by acetylated LDL in macrophages.", 
    "56": "Recent studies demonstrated that inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase lower plasma triglyceride primarily by decreasing hepatic secretion of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). A possible mechanism is that inhibition of cholesterol synthesis interferes with the assembly of VLDL particles. Since one molecule of apolipoprotein (apo) B is required for the proper assembly and secretion of each VLDL and secretion of apo B may be regulated by various lipid components of the lipoproteins, question arises whether HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors also decrease the secretion of apo B. To address this issue, we investigated the effect of lovastatin on the secretion rate of VLDL-apo B and on the composition of VLDL in the Zucker obese rat; a model for genetic hypertriglyceridemia. Lovastatin treatment (4 mg/kg day x 13 days), as compared with placebo, decreased the concentrations of fasting plasma triglyceride (1740 +/- 170 vs. 3130 +/- 790 micrograms/ml) and VLDL-triglyceride (1379 +/- 59 vs. 3082 +/- 715 micrograms/ml). There was a small but non-significant decrease in VLDL-apo B (19 +/- 2 micrograms/ml vs. 26 +/- 7 micrograms/ml). Thus, lovastatin significantly decreased the ratio of triglyceride to apo B in VLDL (76 in lovastatin vs. 124 in placebo group). Secretion rates of VLDL-lipids and VLDL-apo B were measured after intravenous injection of Triton WR-1339.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "57": "The effect of simvastatin treatment on the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) subfraction profile was studied in 26 patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia. Before treatment LDL consisted of three LDL subfractions, using density-gradient ultracentrifugation (LDL1, LDL2 and LDL3) present in a relatively narrow density range (d = 1.030-1.045 g/ml). Simvastatin did not influence this profile with respect to the number and density range of the LDL subfractions. However, the composition of the isolated LDL subfractions changed after treatment, as evidenced by the reversal towards normal of the increased cholesterol/protein ratio (mean 1.51 before vs. 1.38 after therapy, p < 0.01; mean 1.36 in normolipidaemic subjects). When the subjects were stratified by their plasma triglyceride levels or the change in plasma triglycerides during simvastatin therapy, a strong dependence of the LDL subfraction profile and its composition on plasma triglyceride levels was observed; increasing plasma triglyceride levels were associated with a more dense LDL subfraction profile, characterized by a high relative contribution of dense LDL3 to total LDL and changes in LDL composition, reflected by a relatively low cholesterol/protein ratio. Our results indicate that in patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia: (1) plasma triglyceride levels have an important role in determining the properties of LDL and (2) simvastatin treatment results in changes in composition of LDL, which may affect the intrinsic metabolic characteristics and thus the atherogenic potential of LDL.", 
    "58": "Hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors are a class of lipid-lowering medications, with a major activity on plasma cholesterol levels, now enjoying a vast popularity among physicians and patients. These drugs, affecting a very early and key step of sterol biosynthesis, differ to a large extent in their physicochemical properties, tissue distribution and side effects in animals, possibly in humans. Some of these agents (namely lovastatin and simvastatin) are strikingly lipophilic and require enzymatic conversion from the lactone to the open-ring forms, whereas pravastatin, active per se, is hydrophilic. Liver uptake of pravastatin is regulated by a carrier-mediated mechanism. Other HMG CoA reductase inhibitors have been designed, with the objective of obtaining high levels of hepato-selectivity. Evaluation of available data in terms of potential advantages in tissue, namely liver selectivity, of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, suggests, that, indeed, altered sterol biosynthesis in a number of tissues may potentially result in the appearance of significant side effects. While there is no clear-cut relationship between tissue selectivity and lipophilicity, the presence of this latter feature seems, in general, to dictate a lesser absorption to peripheral tissues vs the liver. At present, the toxicological profile of major HMG CoA reductase inhibitors appears safe; it is, however, possible that in selected patient groups liver selectivity may offer a considerable therapeutic advantage.", 
    "59": "The in vitro and in vivo effects of lovastatin on fatty acid metabolism were studied in isolated rat hepatocytes. When added in vitro to cell incubations, lovastatin stimulated de novo fatty acid synthesis and acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity, whereas fatty acid synthase activity was unaffected. Lovastatin depressed palmitate, but not octanoate, oxidation. This may be attributed to the lovastatin-induced increase in intracellular malonyl-CoA levels, as no concomitant change of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-I) specific activity was detected. Lovastatin had no effect on the synthesis and secretion of triacylglycerols and phospholipids in the form of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). When rats were fed a diet supplemented with 0.1% (w/w) lovastatin for one week, both acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity and de novo fatty acid synthesis were reduced compared to pair-fed controls, whereas fatty acid synthase activity was unaffected. Palmitate oxidation was enhanced in the lovastatin-fed group. There was an increase in CPT-I activity but no change in intracellular concentration of malonyl-CoA. Lovastatin feeding had no significant effect either on the esterification of exogenous palmitic acid into both cellular and VLDL triacylglycerols and phospholipids or on hepatic lipid accumulation. The in vitro and in vivo effects of lovastatin were not significantly different between periportal and perivenous hepatocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

High density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol increased from 60.1 +/- 13.9 to 63.1 +/- 17.0 (p = 0.0264). The HDL-cholesterol: HDL-triglycerides ratio increased from 3.91 +/- 1.14 to 4.91 +/- 1.65 (p = 0.0029).

There was a negative correlation between LTP/LCAT ratio and HDL-C levels. These results suggested that the changes in plasma HDL-cholesterol concentrations during treatment with pravastatin may be related to the decreases in LTP and LCAT activity due to this drug.", 
    "61": "We examined the effects of pravastatin and simvastatin, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, on stunned myocardium in vivo. Pravastatin and simvastatin were given orally 2 mg/kg for 3 weeks. After 3 weeks of administration, pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs were subjected to 15-min left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery occlusion followed by 2-h reperfusion. Myocardial segment function was determined by sonomicrometry. The tissue energy and carbohydrate metabolites were determined in the 2-h-reperfused hearts. Administration of pravastatin and simvastatin for 3 weeks decreased serum cholesterol level and blood pressure (BP). Simvastatin resulted in a worsening of segment shortening in the reperfused myocardium as compared with control and pravastatin groups. The level of ATP in the simvastatin group was significantly lower as compared with that in the control group. The other metabolite levels were not significantly altered by either pravastatin or simvastatin. These results suggest that simvastatin enhances stunning of the myocardium in association with ATP reduction after reperfusion subsequent to ischemia.", 
    "62": "Tamoxifen is known to inhibit the growth of some human mammary carcinoma cells; this effect is accompanied by a decrease in the proportion of cells synthesizing DNA. In this work, flow cytometry of DNA and of bromodeoxyuridine labeling and the evaluation of the cell cycle-related antigens Ki-67, PCNA, and statin were used to investigate the changes in the proliferation kinetics of MCF-7 cells before and after treatment with 10(-7) M TAM. The treatment with TAM induced a significant decrease in the fraction of S-phase cells and an increase in those with a DNA content typical of G0/1 phase. The TAM-induced block in G0/1 is paralleled by a decrease in the frequency of cells expressing Ki-67 and PCNA, and by an increase in statin-positive (G0) cells. These results confirmed that the TAM-induced inhibition of cell growth is associated with major changes in the cell cycle parameters of MCF-7 cells, and provide the first experimental evidence that two main mechanisms are operating: the accumulation of cells in G1, before the onset of S-phase, and the exit of some cells from the cycling compartment.",

In addition, members of this family are potent inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis in rats on intravenous and oral dosing, as well as cholesterol lowering agents in rats and hamsters. Significant inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis in rats by lovastatin occurs with a concomitant inhibition of dolichol and coenzyme-Q9 synthesis.

    "64": "Pravastatin and pravastatin-lactone are not taken up into extrahepatic cells such as fibroblasts, or hepatoma cells such as AS-30D ascites hepatoma cells or FAO cells. In contrast, pravastatin is taken up into isolated rat hepatocytes by a carrier mediated, saturable, temperature-dependent and energy-dependent mechanism. The kinetic parameters for the saturable uptake are Km 27 microM, Vmax 537 pmol/mg per min. The permeability coefficients were determined to be 9.829 x 10(-7) cm/s at 4 degrees C, 1.76 x 10(-6) cm/s at 7 degrees C, 3.85 x 10(-6) cm/s at 17 degrees C and 5.82 x 10(-6) cm/s at 37 degrees C. The activation energy is 60 kJ/mol for 100 microM pravastatin at 37 degrees C. The Q10 values are between 1.7 and 2.8. In the presence of metabolic inhibitors and in the absence of oxygen, transport is inhibited. Uptake of pravastatin is not dependent on an extracellular to intracellular sodium-gradient. Replacement of chloride by sulfate, nitrate, gluconate or thiocyanate significantly inhibits the uptake of pravastatin. Uptake is competitively inhibited by cholate and taurocholate in the presence and absence of sodium. Pravastatin, however, competitively inhibits the uptake of cholate and taurocholate only in the absence of sodium. In addition, pravastatin-lactone enters liver cells via an energy-dependent, carrier-mediated uptake system. For the saturable energy-dependent part of the hepatocellular uptake a Km value of 9 microM and a Vmax value of 621 pmol/mg per min was determined. The permeability coefficient of pravastatin-lactone uptake is calculated to be 5.41 x 10(-6) cm/s at 37 degrees C. The uptake of pravastatin-lactone is competitively-noncompetitively inhibited by pravastatin and by lovastatin and vice versa. These results indicate that the hepatoselectivity of pravastatin is due to its carrier-mediated uptake into rat hepatocytes via a sodium-independent bile acid carrier. Pravastatin-lactone resembles pravastatin-sodium in its hepatoselectivity.",

Changing the size of the saturated ring of the tetrahydroindazole nucleus did not improve potency, but incorporation of substituents at the 7-position resulted in up to 1700-fold improvement in inhibitory potency. Structure-activity studies revealed that the most potent compounds possess a substituted benzyl group at the 7-position, with a preference for steric bulk at the para position of the benzene ring. The most potent enzyme inhibitor (18t, IC50 = 3.0 nM) is approximately 3-fold more potent than lovastin sodium salt (2). The most potent cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor in HEP-G2 cells (18q, IC50 = 0.078 microM) is slightly less potent than 2 (sodium salt). Molecular modeling studies suggested that, when compared to the parent compound (18b) lacking the appropriate 7-substituent, 18t overlaps better with 2 and literature inhibitors 5 and 6 in a hydrophobic binding region adjacent to the enzyme active site.",

Maintaining a 5-(1-methylethyl) substituent found to be optimal in related studies, structure-activity relationships were established for compounds modified at positions 2, 3, and 4 of the pyrrole ring. The 4-fluorophenyl group was preferred at the pyrrole 2-position, while incorporation of a range of substituted phenyl groups and pyridyl substituents at the 3-position provided compounds with equivalent enzyme inhibitory activities and widely different lipophilicities.

Structure-activity studies show that the 7-(N-imidazolyl)heptenoates 5 are more active than the corresponding heptanoates 4. For both imidazolyl series, the 4-fluorophenyl group is preferred at C-5, and a broad range of aryl substituents which promote widely different lipophilicities is tolerated at C-4. While the CF3 group is preferred at C-2 in the heptanoate series, the 2-(1-methylethyl) substituent is optimal in the heptenoate series. The 2-(1-methylethyl) and 5-(4-fluorophenyl) groups can be interchanged in the latter series as exemplified by 5ab. Enzyme inhibitory activity resides principally in the 3R,5S series. These potent HMGR inhibitory activities by members of the heptenoate series translated well into whole cell activities in HepG2 cells. X-ray crystallographic studies on the active enantiomer 28 reveal noncoplanarity of the heptenoate C-C double bond with the imidazole ring; this finding provides an explanation for the high acid stability of the heptenoate series.", 
    "77": "The trans-prenyltransferase activity present in rat liver microsomes was investigated using an in vitro system. Geranyl-PP, but not farnesyl-PP is utilized as substrate. The pH optimum is at 8.0, and Mn2+ and Mg2+ activate, while Zn2+ completely inhibits the enzyme. Digitonin, taurodeoxycholate, and Tween 80 increase this activity, whereas deoxycholate and SDS are inhibitory. In contrast to the cis-prenyltransferase, the trans-prenyltransferase is not dependent on cytosolic protein factors. The trans-prenyltransferase is present at the cytoplasmic surface of rough and smooth microsomes. Solanesyl-PP and all-trans-geranylgeranyl-PP inhibit the transferase activity but poly-cis-polyprenyl-12-PP, an intermediate in the cis-prenyltransferase reaction, does not. The enzyme reaction gives rise to two products, solanesyl-PP and an unidentified polyprenyl metabolite. Mevinolin treatment distinguishes this enzyme from the cytoplasmic geranylgeranyl-PP synthase. The results demonstrate that rat liver microsomes synthesize solanesyl-PP via a trans-prenyltransferase, which is distinct from cis-prenyltransferase and geranylgeranyl-PP synthase.",

After 6 weeks of treatment there was no evidence of reduced exercise capacity, or of reduced cortisol or catecholamine responses.

    "79": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors reduce plasma cholesterol in different forms of hyperlipoproteinemia. Although an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor activity is the proven mechanism of this therapy in familial hypercholesterolemia, the mechanism remains controversial in mixed hyperlipoproteinemia. A decreased production of apolipoprotein B (apoB) and/or an increased removal of lipoproteins could mediate the hypocholesterolemic effect of these drugs. The effect of pravastatin on the metabolism of apoB was evaluated in a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, cross-over study in five men with mixed hyperlipoproteinemia. Metabolic parameters for apoB were determined using endogenous labeling with [1-13C]leucine and [15N]glycine and multicompartmental modeling. During pravastatin therapy cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, apoB, and LDL apoB levels were significantly reduced (P < 0.01) by 18%, 20%, 27%, and 29%, respectively, while triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels remained unchanged. Pravastatin therapy increased the fractional catabolic rate of very low density lipoprotein apoB from 3.9 +/- 0.6 to 5.1 +/- 1.7 per day (P = 0.08) and that of LDL apoB from 0.37 +/- 0.09 to 0.46 +/- 0.10 per day (P < 0.01). The apoB production (placebo 35.2 +/- 11.9 mg/kg per day; pravastatin 25.8 +/- 8.7 mg/kg per day) and conversion of very low density lipoprotein apoB to LDL apoB (placebo 65%, pravastatin 57%) remained stable.

The LDL/HDL ratio was reduced from 4.0 to 2.8 (prior to any therapy the ratio was 13.4). The increase in LDL cholesterol between weekly treatments was less steep under the combined therapy. At the same time the treated plasma volume during LDL apheresis could be decreased from 5070 +/- 960 to 4370 +/- 1200 ml. We conclude that in patients with severe familial heterozygous hypercholesterolemia LDL apheresis should be combined with HMG CoA reductase inhibitors.",

Absorption of fluvastatin is complete and unaffected by the presence of food. Systemic exposure is limited because of extensive sequestration by the liver and/or first-pass metabolism, a plasma half-life of approximately 30 min, no circulating active metabolites, and no accumulation of drug during chronic dosing. Approximately 95% of a single dose of fluvastatin is excreted via the biliary route with less than 2% as the parent compound. Studies investigating the effect of food on fluvastatin pharmacokinetics have demonstrated marked reductions in the rate of bioavailability (Cmax) of 40% to 60%. A comparison of drug administration with the evening meal or at bedtime revealed no significant differences in either the extent of bioavailability (area under the curve; AUC) or pharmacodynamic effect [reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)]. Relative to the general population, plasma fluvastatin concentrations do not vary as a function of either age or gender. Administration of a single 40-mg dose to a patient population with hepatic insufficiency resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in both AUC and Cmax. Drug interaction studies with fluvastatin and cholestyramine (CME) demonstrated a lower rate and extent of fluvastatin bioavailability; no impact on efficacy was demonstrated when CME was given 4 h before fluvastatin dosing in clinical trials.

Thus, it is interesting to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fluvastatin, a new 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA)-reductase inhibitor, in such a patient population. A retrospective analysis of the clinical efficacy and safety of fluvastatin was based on the data from 1815 patients who received fluvastatin at daily doses of > or = 20 mg compared with 783 patients taking placebo. The results showed that 332 (18.3%) of the fluvastatin-treated and 124 (15.8%) of the placebo-treated patients were identified as having hypertension.

The high plasma cholesterol of familial hypercholesterolemic subjects was shown to be related to a low in vivo LDL receptor activity; cells from a homozygote had virtually no activity and those from 24 heterozygotes expressed 45% of the activity of cells from 35 normals. The average receptor activity of cells from 18 polygenic hypercholesterolemic (PH) subjects was not significantly different from normal but a low expression may have been a factor in six of these subjects. Simvastatin increased the LDL receptor activity of cells from the PH subjects by 70% while lowering their plasma cholesterol by 26%, but reducing the fat intake from 38% to 20% of energy and cholesterol from 239 to 96 mg/day had no effect on the receptor despite a 10% reduction in plasma cholesterol. Upregulation of the LDL receptor may therefore have been involved in the lowering of plasma cholesterol by simvastatin but not by the reduction in dietary fat and cholesterol.", 
    "85": "In 3-month-old homozygous Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits the effect of treatment with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor pravastatin was studied for 9 months and related to the endothelial function of the coronary arteries of isolated hearts and rings of the distal abdominal aorta. Oral administration of pravastatin in doses up to 40 mg/kg per day significantly decreased plasma cholesterol by 51% in comparison to untreated WHHL rabbits. Basal coronary flow and bradykinin-induced increase in coronary flow in Langendorff hearts of the pravastatin-treated animals were significantly greater than the flow in the control animals, whereas the metacholine-induced relaxation of abdominal aortic rings was not different and attenuated in comparison to New Zealand white rabbits. The incidence of atherosclerotic lesions in four main coronary arteries and the aorta was significantly lower in the pravastatin treated animals (25.0% and 52.8% respectively) than in untreated WHHL rabbits (34.1% and 80.0% respectively). The mean percentage of narrowing in the aorta was also significantly lower in the pravastatin-treated group (12.0%) than in the controls (25.2%). Significant correlations were found between the extent of atherosclerotic lesions and the bradykinin-induced increase in coronary flow versus plasma total cholesterol levels. Thus, in this model, long term cholesterol lowering treatment with pravastatin starting at an early age retards the progression of plaque formation and preserves the endothelium-dependent relaxation of the coronary arteries.", 
    "86": "Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is caused by mutations in the gene for the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. It is generally believed that homozygous FH patients do not respond well to lipid-lowering drug therapy with inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase because they cannot respond to an increased demand for hepatic cholesterol by up-regulation of LDL-receptor activity. In this paper we show that serum cholesterol in a homozygous FH patient with a receptor-negative LDL-receptor phenotype was reduced by 30% after treatment with simvastatin alone and by a further 11% with simvastatin in combination with probucol and nicotinic acid. The patient was a true homozygote, with two identical alleles of the LDL receptor gene in which a previously undescribed point mutation in exon 11 introduces a premature termination codon at residue 540 in the protein; the mutant protein is predicted to be truncated in the domain with homology to the epidermal growth factor precursor. Cultured cells from the patient were unable to bind, internalise or degrade LDL by the receptor pathway and there was no immunodetectable LDL receptor protein in the cells. Thus the lipid lowering effect of simvastatin in this individual must involve mechanisms other than stimulation of LDL receptors.", 
    "87": "Seven sustained/controlled-release dosage forms were designed for gastrointestinal delivery of lovastatin or simvastatin, two potent HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. The in vivo performance of these formulations was evaluated in dogs and healthy volunteers in terms of the cholesterol lowering efficacy and/or systemic concentrations of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Results from the present and previous studies suggest that, through the controlled release of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, sustained lower plasma concentrations of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may result in an equal or better therapeutic efficacy.", 
    "88": "Suppression of cholesterol synthesis by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, such as lovastatin, has been shown to inhibit mitogen stimulated proliferation of natural killer (NK) cells and other lymphocytes in vitro. This effect is only partially overcome by provision of exogenous free or lipoprotein cholesterol but is reversed by mevalonate, suggesting that proliferating lymphocytes have a specific requirement for a nonsterol isoprenoid product of mevalonate. The effect of lovastatin (20 mg bid) on a range of immune function parameters was determined in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind ex vivo study in 52 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia. No significant differences (P < 0.05) were found between lovastatin and placebo groups for basal NK or interleukin-2 (IL-2)-induced cell-mediated cytotoxicity, PHA-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation, or relative numbers of T lymphocytes (CD3+), B lymphocytes (CD19+), total NK cells (CD3-, CD16+, CD56+) and CD57+ NK cells or in immunoglobulin levels after 4 or 8 weeks of treatment. In contrast to previous in vitro data, no statistically or clinically significant changes were observed in any parameter of lymphocyte function in patients treated with lovastatin.", 
    "89": "Fungi of the genus Pleurotus were shown to produce the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor mevinolin. Crude methanol extracts and the purified inhibitor from three different species, P. sapidus, P. saca and P. ostreatus, were tested using the solubilized microsomal HMGCoA reductase from Chinese hamster ovary cells. The identity of the inhibitor was also confirmed by thin layer chromatography, high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy.", 
    "90": "Experimental evidence suggests that lipid lowering therapy could slow the progression of renal disease in humans. We have conducted a double-blind, placebo controlled trial of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin in patients with the nephrotic syndrome or significant proteinuria (> 1 g/day) and hypercholesterolemia (> or = 6.5 mmol/liter). Patients were placed on a lipid lowering diet for at least 10 weeks before randomization. After a four-week placebo run-in, 30 adults were randomized to simvastatin or placebo therapy (10 mg/day, increasing to 20 to 40 mg/day as required) for 24 weeks. There were seven dropouts, none of whom were \"definitely\" related to drug therapy. Total and LDL cholesterol levels fell by a mean of 33 and 31%, respectively, in simvastatin treated patients, compared with only 5 and 1% in patients on placebo (P < 0.001, P = 0.002, respectively). Apolipoprotein B100 levels fell by a mean of 31% in the simvastatin group but rose 0.3% in the placebo group (P = 0.014). There were no significant changes in HDL levels. There were no significant differences between the groups in their urine protein levels, their rise in plasma creatinine, or decline in plasma inulin clearance. Simvastatin is a safe, effective therapy for hypercholesterolemia in proteinuric states. A much larger trial is needed to show if potent lipid-lowering therapy slows progression of hypercholesterolemic proteinuric diseases.", 
    "91": "The ability to measure the total concentration of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in hepatic tissues is of crucial importance to understanding changes in hepatic cholesterol metabolism. Such measurements can be made in conjunction with estimates of LDL receptor transcriptional activity, cell surface LDL receptor number, and rates of hepatic LDL uptake to evaluate the mechanisms controlling cellular LDL receptor expression. Current methods for assessing hepatic LDL receptor levels use microsomes as a source of LDL receptor, and thus rely on consistent contamination of the microsomal preparation with LDL receptor-containing plasma membranes, endocytic vesicles, and/or secretory vesicles. Because this contamination is variable, and may vary with alterations in either the distribution of LDL receptors among the various cellular membrane fractions or in the composition of the intracellular membranes, measurement of LDL receptor concentration in microsomal fractions may not accurately reflect the total compliment of LDL receptors within the cell. We have developed the methodology for isolating the full complement of hepatic LDL receptor containing membranes by discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and for quantitating LDL receptor concentration using a Western immunoblotting procedure that uses an anti-C-terminal LDL receptor peptide polyclonal antiserum and assesses the intensity of color formation by reflectance densitometry. Using this methodology, we observed a 126 kDa immunoreactive band for the bovine adrenal cortex LDL receptor that also exhibited LDL binding activity as visualized by biotinylated LDL-ligand blotting, and a doublet of 140 kDa for the hamster liver LDL receptor. These bands were not observed when ligand blotting was conducted in the presence of either 10 mM EDTA or a 5-fold excess of unlabeled LDL, or when immunoblotting was conducted using either preimmune serum or antiserum that had been preabsorbed with LDL receptor peptide. The intensity of color formation was a linear function of the amount of membrane extract separated by electrophoresis. Intra-assay variation averaged 7%, and inter-animal variation averaged 20%. Cholestyramine, tiqueside, CP-88488, 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol, mevinolin, and the combination of cholestyramine plus mevinolin, pharmacological interventions known to increase LDL receptor activity in experimental animals, produced the predicted increases in hamster total hepatic LDL receptor concentration that were highly correlated with concomitant increases in HMG-CoA reductase activity and reductions in serum cholesterol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "92": "A noninvasive method for visualizing the uptake of low density lipoprotein (LDL) was used to investigate the effect of hypolipidemic drugs on LDL uptake by the human liver in vivo. Fourteen hypercholesterolemic patients (six with familial hypercholesterolemia and eight with common hypercholesterolemia) were studied. Autologous LDL particles were isolated and divided into two aliquots; one was labeled with 99mTC and the other with 131I, and both preparations were reinjected simultaneously. The labeled LDL was visualized 24 h later by scanning the thorax and abdomen with a gamma camera, and the liver/heart ratio was calculated as an estimate of the hepatic uptake of LDL. The results of 99mTC-labeled LDL scintigraphy were compared with conventional determinations of the fractional catabolic rate (FCR) for 131I-labeled LDL. The latter correlated best with the liver/heart ratio (r = 0.80, P < 0.001). Lovastatin treatment increased the liver/heart ratio (15%, P < 0.01) in the patients with polygenic hypercholesterolemia and the FCR for LDL in both groups (22%, P < 0.05, for those with familial hypercholesterolemia and 37%, P < 0.01 for those with polygenic hypercholesterolemia). Scanning of the liver using the 99mTC-labeled LDL method provides a noninvasive method for visualizing the hepatic uptake of LDL in vivo in humans. This study also provides direct proof that lovastatin, a drug that enhances LDL receptor activity in the liver, also increases the hepatic uptake of LDL in humans.", 
    "93": "Plasma coenzyme Q (CoQ) was measured in 20 hyperlipidaemic patients treated with diet and simvastatin (an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase); 22 hyperlipidaemic patients treated with diet with alone; and 20 normal controls. Patients treated with simvastatin had a significantly lower plasma CoQ and CoQ: cholesterol ratio than either patients receiving diet alone or normal controls. Use of simvastatin was inversely and independently correlated with both CoQ (p < 0.0001) and CoQ: cholesterol ratio (p < 0.01). There was a significant inverse association between CoQ and dose of simvastatin (p < 0.001). It is concluded that simvastatin may lower the plasma CoQ concentration and this may be greater than the reduction in cholesterol. The possible adverse effect of simvastatin on the metabolism of CoQ may be clinically important and requires further study.", 
    "94": "The effect of the sulfur-substituted fatty acid analogue 1,10 bis(carboxymethylthio)decane, also known as 3-thiadicarboxylic acid, on puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrotic hyperlipidemia was studied in rats. Treatment with 3-thiadicarboxylic acid (250 mg/kg) for 5 days reduced plasma levels of triglycerides from 5.8 to 2.7 mmol/L and cholesterol from 11.0 to 7.7 mmol/L. This was accounted for by decreases in very-low-density lipoprotein triglycerides, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, without any major changes in the composition of plasma lipoproteins. The activities of two enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis (ATP:citrate lyase and fatty acid synthetase) were inhibited by 3-thiadicarboxylic acid treatment, whereas acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase activity was unchanged. In contrast, treatment with the sulfur-substituted fatty acid analogue induced the peroxisomal beta-oxidation of fatty acids ninefold and the mitochondrial beta-oxidation by 54% to 73%, depending on the substrate used. This was accompanied by a 26% reduction in hepatic triglyceride secretion rate. The hepatic phosphatidate phosphohydrolase activity was unchanged. 3-Thiadicarboxylic acid treatment suppressed the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, by 58%, whereas hepatic LDL receptor expression was unaltered. The activities of lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase were unchanged by treatment. These results demonstrated that treatment with 3-thiadicarboxylic acid ameliorates hyperlipidemia in experimental nephrosis primarily by decreasing the overproduction of very-low-density lipoprotein present. The data also indicate that hepatic very-low-density lipoprotein synthesis and secretion is strongly influenced by the availability of the fatty acid substrate under the same hyperlipidemic conditions."
