Atorvastatin also decreased the GSH/GSSG ratio, but only in glycolytic skeletal muscle. Cotreatment with the antioxidant, quercetin, at 25\u2009mg/kg/day abolished these effects in plantaris. An in vitro study with L6 myoblasts directly demonstrated the link between mitochondrial oxidative stress following atorvastatin exposure and activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis signaling pathway.",

Recently published cholesterol treatment guidelines emphasize the use of statins as the preferred treatment strategy for both primary and secondary prevention of CVD. However, the optimal treatment strategy for patients who cannot tolerate statin therapy or those who need additional lipid-lowering therapy is unclear in light of recent evidence that demonstrates a lack of improved cardiovascular outcomes with combination therapy. The purpose of this review is to summarize and interpret evidence that evaluates nonstatin drug classes in reducing cardiovascular outcomes, to provide recommendations for use of nonstatin therapies in clinical practice, and to review emerging nonstatin therapies for management of dyslipidemia.",

There is a lack of data that evaluates bile acid sequestrant in combination with statin therapy on reducing cardiovascular events. Ezetimibe-statin combination therapy can reduce cardiovascular outcomes in those with chronic kidney disease and following vascular surgery or acute coronary syndrome. Long-term effects of emerging nonstatin therapies (CETP and PCSK9 inhibitors) are currently being evaluated in ongoing Phase III trials.",

In certain clinical situations, such as patients who are unable to tolerate statin therapy or recommended intensities of statin therapy, those with persistent severe elevations in triglycerides, or patients with high cardiovascular risk, some nonstatin therapies may be useful in reducing cardiovascular events. Future research is needed to evaluate the role of nonstatin therapies in those who are unable to tolerate guideline-directed statin doses.",

This study investigated the differences of angiogenesis in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic PHT with special emphasis on the canonical (Shh/Gli) and non-canonical (Shh/RhoA) hedgehog pathway. Cirrhotic (bile duct ligation/BDL; CCl4 intoxication) and non-cirrhotic (partial portal vein ligation/PPVL) rats received either atorvastatin (15 mg/kg; 7d) or control chow before sacrifice. Invasive hemodynamic measurement and Matrigel implantation assessed angiogenesis in vivo. Angiogenesis in vitro was analysed using migration and tube formation assay. In liver and vessel samples from animals and humans, transcript expression was analyzed using RT-PCR and protein expression using Western blot. Atorvastatin decreased portal pressure, shunt flow and angiogenesis in cirrhosis, whereas atorvastatin increased these parameters in PPVL rats. Non-canonical Hh was upregulated in experimental and human liver cirrhosis and was blunted by atorvastatin. Moreover, atorvastatin blocked the non-canonical Hh-pathway RhoA dependently in activated hepatic steallate cells (HSCs). Interestingly, hepatic and extrahepatic Hh-pathway was enhanced in PPVL rats, which resulted in increased angiogenesis. In summary, statins caused contrary effects in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. Atorvastatin inhibited the non-canonical Hh-pathway and angiogenesis in cirrhosis. In portal vein obstruction, statins enhanced the canonical Hh-pathway and aggravated PHT and angiogenesis.", 
    "32": "Statins are cholesterol-lowering drugs that have proven to be effective in lowering the risk of major cardiovascular events. Although well tolerated, statin-induced myopathies are the most common side effects. Compared to their pharmacologically active acid form, statin lactones are more potent inducers of toxicity. They can be formed by glucuronidation mediated by uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), but a systematic characterization of subtype specificity and kinetics of lactonization is lacking. Here, we demonstrate for six clinically relevant statins that only UGT1A1, 1A3, and 2B7 contribute significantly to their lactonization. UGT1A3 appeared to have the highest lactonization capacity with marked differences in statin conversion rates: pitavastatin \u226b atorvastatin > cerivastatin > lovastatin > rosuvastatin (simvastatin not converted). Using in silico modeling we could identify a probable statin interaction region in the UGT binding pocket. Polymorphisms in these regions of UGT1A1, 1A3, and 2B7 may be a contributing factor in statin-induced myopathies, which could be used in personalization of statin therapy with improved safety.",

While a primary infertile couple with oligoasthenospermia was preparing for an in vitro fertilization program, the male partner had been diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia in a medical check-up and prescribed four-week oral administration of rosuvastatin. No motile spermatozoa were found in the ejaculated semen and urine on the day of follicular aspiration. Azoospermia was confirmed by reexamination in weeks 3 and 7. Spermatozoa appeared in the ejaculated semen in two weeks of drug withdrawal. In week 16, the sperm count and motility increased to the level where intracytoplasmic sperm injection was available.", 
    "34": "Simvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, is known to promote osteogenic differentiation. However, the mechanism underlying simvastatin-induced osteogenesis is not well understood. In this study, we hypothesize that the estrogen receptor (ER) mediates simvastatin-induced osteogenic differentiation. ER antagonists and siRNA were used to determine the involvement of the ER in simvastatin-induced osteogenesis in mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (D1 cells). Osteogenesis was evaluated by mRNA expression, protein level/activity of osteogenic markers, and mineralization. The estrogen response element (ERE) promoter activity and the ER-simvastatin binding affinity were examined. Our results showed that the simvastatin-induced osteogenic effects were decreased by treatment with ER\u03b1 antagonists and ER\u03b1 siRNA but not by an antagonist specific for the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER-1). The simvastatin-induced osteogenic effects were further increased by E2 treatment and were reversed by ER\u03b1 antagonists or siRNA treatment. Luciferase reporter gene assays demonstrated that simvastatin increase ER\u03b1-dependent transcriptional activity that was suppressed by ER\u03b1 antagonists. Furthermore, the ER\u03b1-simvastatin binding assay showed that IC50 value of simvastatin is 7.85 \u03bcM and that of E2 is 32.8 nM, indicating that simvastatin is a weak ligand for ER\u03b1. These results suggest that simvastatin-stimulated osteogenesis is mediated by ER\u03b1 but not GPER-1. Moreover, this is the first report to demonstrate that simvastatin acts as an ER\u03b1 ligand and a co-activator to enhance ER\u03b1-dependent transcriptional activity and thus promotes osteogenesis. These results indicate that simvastatin-induced osteogenesis is mediated via an ER\u03b1-dependent pathway.",

We assessed the association between AP or statin use and in-hospital postoperative MI and MI/death. Multivariable logistic analyses were performed to identify the patient, procedure, and preoperative medication factors associated with postoperative MI and MI/death across procedures and patient cardiac risk strata. Secondary end points included bleeding, transfusion, and thrombotic complications.", 
    "41": "Most patients were taking both AP and statin preoperatively (56% both agents vs 19% AP only, 13% statin only, and 12% neither agent). Use of both agents was more common for patients in the highest cardiac risk stratum (low, 54%; intermediate, 59%; high, 61%; P < .01). Increased cardiac risk was associated with higher MI rates (1.8% vs 3.8% vs 6.5% for low, intermediate, and high risk; P < .01). By univariate analysis, MI rate was paradoxically higher for patients taking both agents (3.7%, vs statin only 2.8%, AP only 2.6%, or neither AP nor statin 2.4%; P = .003). After multivariable adjustment, rates of MI in patients taking preoperative AP only (odds ratio [OR], 0.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-1.2) and statin only (OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.6-1.2) were not different from those in patients taking either or neither medication (neither agent compared with taking both agents: OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.7-1.4; P > .05 for all). Similarly, rates of MI/death were not associated with medication status after multivariable adjustment. Estimated blood loss >1 liter (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.6-3.7; P < .01) and transfusions of 1 or 2 units (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 2.0-3.3; P < .01) and \u22653 units (OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 3.1-5.3; P < .01) were highly associated with MI, with similar findings related to composite MI/death in multivariable analysis. Rates of blood loss were slightly higher with AP use for all procedures; however, increased transfusions occurred only for infrainguinal bypass with AP use. Rates of reoperation for bleeding, graft thrombosis, or graft revision did not differ by preoperative AP use.", 
    "42": "Preoperative AP and statin medications as used in VQI were not associated with the rate of in-hospital MI/death after major open vascular operations. Rather, predicted cardiac risk and operative blood loss were significantly associated with in-hospital MI or MI/death. AP and statin medications appear to be more useful in reducing late mortality than early postoperative MI/death in VQI. However, they were not harmful, so their long-term benefit argues for continued use.",

We detected RhoA expression in vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC) tissue, measured RhoA expression in the VSCC cell phenotype, and measured the expression of the relevant molecules after RhoA small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection in SW962 cells. RhoA has a higher expression level in VSCC than normal vulva skin tissue and was positively associated with the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage and differentiation; besides, VSCC patients with lymph node metastasis had higher positive RhoA expression. RhoA messenger RNA and protein expression was significantly reduced in the RhoA siRNA transfectants as compared with the negative control (NC) and mock-transfected cells (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The RhoA siRNA transfectants lead to low growth, G1 arrest, high apoptosis, low migration and invasion (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and suppressed lamellipodia formation as compared to NC and mock-transfected cells. Besides, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2), MMP9, and cyclinA1 protein expression was downregulated, while that of Bax was upregulated in the RhoA siRNA transfectants (p\u2009<\u20090.05). SW962 cell proliferation rates were significantly lovastatin dose-dependent. Lovastatin caused G1 arrest, high apoptosis, low migration and invasion (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and suppression of lamellipodia formation. Similar to the RhoA siRNA transfectants, lovastatin treatment downregulated RhoA, MMP2, MMP9, and cyclinA1 protein expression, while upregulating that of Bax as compared to that of the NC (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Abnormal RhoA expression in vulvar carcinoma is involved in tumor proliferation and invasion and may be a treatment target. The RhoA inhibitor lovastatin alters VSCC cell migration and proliferation and may be effective for treating VSCC.",

    "55": "Nicotine is a parasympathomimetic alkaloid present in tobacco which can induce hyperlipidemia and has a direct effect on neural functions. Statins, competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxymethyl-3-glutaryl-coenzyme-A reductase, are cholesterol lowering drugs. It has some neuroprotective effects. Hence we analysed the combined effect of nicotine and statin on the learning behaviour of male albino rats. We employed Y-Maze conditional discrimination task. Rats were divided into 4 groups with six rats in each group. (1) Control, (2) Atorvastatin (10mg/kgb.wt), (3) Nicotine (0.6mg/kgb.wt) and (4) Atorvastatin (10mg/kgb.wt)+Nicotine (0.6mg/kgb.wt). After 30days of treatment rats from each group were selected for behavioural study and they were observed for 30days. At the end of the experimental period rats were sacrificed, and brain and liver were dissected out for further biochemical analysis. Nicotine treated group showed least performance in learning in comparison with control, atorvastatin and atorvastatin+nicotine treated groups. Co-administration of atorvastatin and nicotine improved learning behaviour compared to nicotine treated group. Reactive oxygen species level was significantly increased in nicotine group compared to control. The level of neurotransmitter serotonin which has a significant role in learning was found to be decreased in nicotine treated group compared to the control group. Activity of Na(+) K(+) ATPase, Ca(2+) ATPase and glutathione content was significantly reduced in nicotine treated group compared to control. The activity of acetylcholine esterase was significantly increased in the nicotine treated group. Expression studies showed significant decrease in N-methyl D-aspartate receptors and increase in mono amine oxidase-A and mono amine oxidase-B in nicotine treated group and was reversed in atorvastatin + nicotine treated group. It can be concluded that co-administration of nicotine with statin ameliorates the neural functional alterations caused by nicotine to a significant level.",

At a genome-wide significance level, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PCSK9 and HMGCR have been implicated in this differential response. However, the influence of these variants is uncertain in the Chilean population. Hence, we aimed to evaluate the contribution of PCSK9 rs7552841 and HMGCR rs17671591 SNPs as genetic determinants of atorvastatin response in Chilean hypercholesterolaemic individuals. One hundred and one hypercholesterolaemic patients received atorvastatin 10 mg/day for 4 weeks. Plasma lipid profile (TC, HDL-C, LDL-C and TG) was determined before and after statin treatment, and SNPs were identified by allelic discrimination using TaqMan(\u00ae) SNP Genotyping Assays. Adjusted univariate and multivariate analyses' models were used for statistical analyses, and a p-value <0.05 was considered significant. From baseline (week 0) to the study end-point (week 4), significant reductions were observed in plasma TC, LDL-C and TG (p < 0.001), while HDL-C levels were increased (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed no association between lipid levels and atorvastatin therapy for the PCSK9 variant. However, the HMGCR rs17671591 T allele contributed to basal HDL-C concentration variability along with a higher increase in this lipid fraction after statin medication. In addition, this allele determined greater plasma LDL-C reductions after therapy with atorvastatin. Our data suggest that the HMGCR rs17671591 polymorphism can constitute a genetic marker of lower plasma LDL-C and enhanced HDL-C concentration after atorvastatin therapy in the Chilean population.",

One hundred and forty nine mild to moderate hypertensive, normocholesterolemic, overweight or obese outpatients with hepatic steatosis were enrolled. They were treated with perindopril 5mg/day, or barnidipine, 20mg/day, for 6 months; subsequently simvastatin, 20mg/day was added to both treatments for further 6 months. Blood pressure variation was recorded. Patients also underwent an ultrasound examination, at baseline and after 6, and 12 months. We also assessed: fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting plasma insulin (FPI), lipid profile, adiponectin (ADN), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (\u03a4\u039dF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), high-sensitivity C reactive protein (Hs-CRP). Both perindopril and barnidipine reduced blood pressure, with barnidipine being more effective. Barnidipine, but not perindopril, slightly decreased total cholesterol and triglycerides after 6 months compared to baseline; lipid profile improved in both groups when simvastatin was added. Regarding inflammatory parameters, barnidipine reduced TNF-a, IL-6, and Hs-CRP, both in monotherapy, and after simvastatin addition. Hepatic steatosis parameters improved only when simvastatin was added. We can conclude that barnidipine better reduced blood pressure compared to perindopril and inflammatory parameters.

However, coil embolization is associated with a higher risk of recurrence than clip ligation. In this study, the authors explore a new approach through the promotion of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) to optimize endothelialization of the aneurysm neck and reduce the risk of recurrence. METHODS A coiled aneurysm model was created in 48 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats via microsurgery. Half of these animals were treated with rosuvastatin (20 mg/kg) in saline via gavage for 10, 20, or 30 days. The other half were administered saline without rosuvastatin. An additional 15 rats underwent \"mock surgery\" (identical anesthesia and saline gavage but no surgery). The endothelial repair process in the coiled aneurysms was evaluated via flow cytometry, im-munostaining, and electronic microscopy. The mock surgery group was used for comparison in flow cytometry studies. The effects of rosuvastatin on viability and functioning of Sprague-Dawley rat bone marrow-derived EPCs were also explored via MTT, migration, and tube formation assays. RESULTS The aneurysm neck repair score was significantly higher in the rosuvastatin-treated rats than in the untreated rats (p < 0.05). The circulating EPC count was increased and maintained at a higher level in rosuvastatin-treated rats compared with the aneurysm rats that did not receive rosuvastatin (p < 0.05). Immunostaining showed that the aneurysm neck endothelium was more integrated and the number of kinase insert domain receptor-positive cells was increased in the rosuvastatin-treated rats. Further study demonstrated that rosuvastatin promoted EPC proliferation, migration, and tube formation. CONCLUSIONS Rosuvastatin promoted endothelialization of the coiled aneurysm neck via induction of EPCs, suggesting that promoting endothelialization provides an additional therapeutic opportunity during vascular endothelium repair.",

Using data on 174,000 patients (including 46,000 women) collected up to 2010, a meta-analysis was performed using individual patient data, separately analyzing results for men and women and adjusting for baseline risk and nongender related risk factors. Over a median duration of follow-up of 4.9 years, statins reduced the risk of major vascular events by 21% for each mmol/l reduction of LDL cholesterol (relative risk: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.77-0.81; p < 0.001), reducing risk by 22% for men and 16% for women. There was no significant overall heterogeneity for the benefit achieved in men versus that achieved in women after adjusting for baseline risk. Baseline risk substantially affected the absolute number of events prevented, but did not affect the proportional benefit attributed to the use of statins. Total mortality was similarly and significantly reduced in men (10%) and women (9%). This study adds to existing literature in confirming that statins have demonstrable benefit in men and women.",

We now show an effect of these drugs to induce profound changes in the step-wise synthesis of glycosphingolipids (GSLs) in the Golgi. Glucosylceramide (GlcCer) was increased several-fold in all cell lines tested, demonstrating a widespread effect. Additionally, de novo or elevated lactotriaosylceramide (Lc3Cer; GlcNAc\u03b21-3Gal\u03b21-4GlcCer) synthesis was observed in 70%. Western blot showed that GlcCer synthase (GCS) was elevated by statins, and GCS and Lc3Cer synthase (Lc3S) activities were increased; however, transcript was elevated for Lc3S only. Supplementation with the isoprenoid precursor, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), a downstream product of HMG Co-A reductase, reversed statin-induced glycosyltransferase and GSL elevation. The Rab geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor 3-PEHPC, but not specific inhibitors of farnesyl transferase, or geranylgeranyl transferase I, was sufficient to replicate statin-induced GlcCer and Lc3Cer synthesis, supporting a Rab prenylation-dependent mechanism. While total cholesterol was unaffected, the trans-Golgi network (TGN) cholesterol pool was dissipated and medial Golgi GCS partially relocated by statins. GSL-dependent vesicular retrograde transport of Verotoxin and cholera toxin to the Golgi/endoplasmic reticulum were blocked after statin or 3-PEHPC treatment, suggesting aberrant, prenylation-dependent vesicular traffic as a basis of glycosyltransferase increase and GSL remodeling. These in vitro studies indicate a previously unreported link between Rab prenylation and regulation of GCS activity and GlcCer metabolism.",

This study aims to investigate effects of PTH+SIM on osseous integration of the implant in OVX rats. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were used for this study. Twelve weeks after bilateral ovariectomy, all animals were randomly divided into four groups: group control; group SIM; group PTH and group PTH+SIM. Afterwards, all OVX rats received hydroxyapatite (HA)-coated titanium rods (external diameter and length are 1.5mm and 20mm) in the femoral medullary canal. Subsequently, the animals from group SIM, group PTH and group PTH+SIM received human parathyroid hormone 1-34 (60\u03bcg/kg, three times a week), SIM (5mg/kg daily), or both for 12 weeks. Implants were inserted bilaterally in all animals until death at 12 weeks. The bilateral femurs of rats were harvested for evaluation. All groups increased new bone formation around the surface of titanium rods and push-out force; group PTH+SIM showed the strongest effects on new bone formation and biomechanical strength. Additionally, these are significant difference observed in bone formation and push-out force between groups SIM and PTH. This finding suggests that intermittent administration of PTH or SIM alone has an effect to increase new bone formation on the surface of HA-coated implants in the osteoporotic condition, and the additive effects of combination PTH and SIM on osseous integration of the implant in OVX rats.",

    "112": "Qualitative data from 94 semi-structured interviews (47 healthcare providers (pharmacists, general practitioners, Aboriginal health workers; 47 patients) conducted for the process evaluation of Kanyini GAP was used. Data coded to 'trial impact', 'research motivation' and 'real world' were explored and triangulated with data extracted from study materials (e.g. Emails, memoranda of understanding and financial statements).", 
    "113": "PRCT implementation was facilitated by an extensive process of relationship building at the trial outset including building on existing relationships between core investigators and service providers. Health providers' and participants' altruism, increased professional satisfaction, collaboration, research capacity and opportunities for improved patient care enabled implementation. Inadequate research infrastructure, excessive administrative demands, insufficient numbers of adequately trained staff and the potential financial impact on private practice were considered implementation barriers. These were largely related to this being the first experience of trial involvement for many sites. The significant costs of addressing these barriers drew study resources from the task of achieving recruitment targets.", 
    "114": "Conducting PRCTs is crucial to generating credible evidence of intervention effectiveness in routine practice. PRCT implementation needs to account for the particular challenges of implementing collaborative research across diverse stakeholder organisations. Reliance on goodwill to participate is crucial at the outset. However, participation costs, particularly for organisations with little or no research experience, can be substantial and should be factored into PRCT funding models. Investment in a pool to fund infrastructure in the form of primary health research networks will offset some of these costs, enabling future studies to be implemented more cost-effectively.",

Lipid variables were compared with a primary focus on LDL-C and with secondary focuses on the percentage of patients who reached the LDL-C targets and changes in the levels of RLP-C (remnant like particle cholesterol) and sd-LDL-C, two characteristic atherogenic risks of DM.", 
    "118": "The reduction of LDL-C (%), the primary endpoint, differed significantly between the two groups (-24.6 in EAT vs. -10.9 in DST). In the analyses of the secondary endpoints, EAT treatment brought about significantly larger reductions in sd-LDL-C (-20.5 vs. -3.7) and RLP-C (-19.7 vs. +5.5). In total, 89.4% of the patients receiving EAT reached the optimized treatment goal compared to 51.0% of the patients receiving DST. The changes in TC (-16.3 vs. -6.3) and non-HDL-C (-20.7 vs. -8.3) differed significantly between the two groups.",

    "130": "It is well known that inflammation contributes to the development of coronary artery disease (CAD) and depressive symptoms. Previous studies have shown that long-term application of statin reduces the occurrence of depression in patients with CAD. However, the mechanism remains unclear. We hypothesized that inflammation contributes to depression in patients with CAD and statin function as an anti-inflammation therapy for those depressive patients. Patients with confirmed CAD hospitalized in the Department of Cardiology of Tongji Hospital in Shanghai, China, were enrolled. Depression was identified as none (ND), mild (MiD), moderate (MoD), or severe (SD) on the basis of scores of the patient health questionnaire with 9 items. Inflammatory factors in peripheral blood were measured using a chemiluminescence immunoassay and Bio-plex. Luciferase expression level was detected using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System for IL-1\u03b2 or NF-\u03baB expression by transfection in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and patient serum was added. Data obtained from 217 patients with CAD were analyzed. The IL-1\u03b2 level of CAD with SD was 14.70, which was significantly higher than that of CAD with ND 7.52, MiD 7.73, or MoD 8.63. Luciferase reporter gene analysis showed that IL-1\u03b2 or NF-\u03baB expression level was upregulated by the serum of CAD and depression patients. After the addition of atorvastatin, IL-1\u03b2 or NF-\u03baB luciferase reporter expression level decreased. It suggested that depression in patients with CAD is associated with inflammation. Statin may function as an anti-inflammation therapy for depression in patients with CAD by downregulation of IL-1\u03b2.",

For high intensity statins, the difference in percentage change from baseline was in favor of dual therapy versus equivalent statin monotherapy for triglycerides (-17%; SE 2.6%) and for HDL-C (8.7%; SE 1.9%). The difference in percentage change from baseline for LDL-C was 6% (SE 1.7%), implying a greater reduction in LDL-C with statin monotherapy. For moderate intensity statins, the difference in percentage change from baseline was in favor of dual therapy versus equivalent statin monotherapy for triglycerides (-24.2%; SE 1.2%) and HDL-C (8.2%; SE 0.9%). LDL-C decreased 2.2% (SE 1.4%) more with dual therapy.", 
    "134": "When aiming to change HDL-C or triglycerides, dual therapy is to be preferred to doubling the statin dose; conversely, doubling the statin dose is to be preferred when aiming to reduce LDL-C. If the aim is both to change HDL-C or triglycerides and to reduce LDL-C, the importance of the three outcomes may need to be weighed depending on the intensity of the statin. Combining high intensity statin therapy with fenofibrate improves the effect on HDL-C and triglycerides, but lowers the effect on LDL-C. Combining a moderate intensity statin with fenofibrate improves the effect on HDL-C and triglycerides without reducing the effect on LDL-C. There is a need for long-term randomized clinical trials to compare dual therapy versus doubling the statin dose to assess the importance of improvement in HDL-C and triglycerides versus improvement in LDL-C in terms of cardiovascular outcomes. Further, the addition of ezetimibe to statin/fenofibrate therapy may be of interest.", 
    "135": "The aim of this study is to prepare fluvastatin nanostructured lipid carriers (FLV-NLCs) in order to find an innovative way to alleviate FLV-associated disadvantages. The limitations include poor solubility and extensive first-pass metabolism, resulting in low (30%) bioavailability and short elimination half-life (1-3 hours). FLV-NLCs were prepared by hot emulsification-ultrasonication method. Ten runs were created by three-level factorial design (32) to optimize FLV-NLCs formulation process. In this study, two factors, four responses, and three-level factorial design were endorsed. The studied variables were lipid:oil ratio (X1) and sonication time (X2). However, the responses parameter determined the particle size (Y1, nm), entrapment efficiency percent (EE%, Y2), particles zeta potential (Y3), and 80% of the drug release after 24 hours (X4). Furthermore, stability and in vivo pharmacokinetics were studied in rats. The optimized consisted formula had an average particle size of 165 nm with 75.32% entrapment efficiency and 85.32% of drug released after 24 hours, demonstrating a sustaining drug release over 24 hours. An in vivo pharmacokinetic study revealed enhanced bioavailability by >2.64-fold, and the mean residence time was longer than that of FLV. We concluded that NLCs could be promising carriers for sustained/prolonged FLV release with enhanced oral bioavailability.", 
    "136": "The efficacy of phytosterols and phytostanols added to foods and food supplements to obtain significant non-pharmacologic serum and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction is well documented. Irrespective of age, gender, ethnic background, body weight, background diet, or the cause of hypercholesterolemia and, even added to statin treatment, phytosterols and phytostanols at 2 g/day significantly lower LDL cholesterol concentration by 8%-10%. They do not affect the concentrations of high density lipoprotein cholesterol, lipoprotein (a) or serum proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9. In some studies, phytosterols and phytostanols have modestly reduced serum triglyceride levels especially in subjects with slightly increased baseline concentrations. Phytosterols and phytostanols lower LDL cholesterol by displacing cholesterol from mixed micelles in the small intestine so that cholesterol absorption is partially inhibited. Cholesterol absorption and synthesis have been carefully evaluated during phytosterol and phytostanol supplementation. However, only a few lipoprotein kinetic studies have been performed, and they revealed that LDL apoprotein B-100 transport rate was reduced. LDL particle size was unchanged, but small dense LDL cholesterol concentration was reduced. In subjects with metabolic syndrome and moderate hypertriglyceridemia, phytostanols reduced not only non- high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration but also serum triglycerides by 27%, and reduced the large and medium size very low density lipoprotein particle concentrations. In the few postprandial studies, the postprandial lipoproteins were reduced, but detailed studies with apoprotein B-48 are lacking. In conclusion, more kinetic studies are required to obtain a more complete understanding of the fasting and postprandial lipoprotein metabolism caused by phytosterols and phytostanols. It seems obvious, however, that the most atherogenic lipoprotein particles will be diminished.",

(1 , 2) Supportive therapy is needed to improve both morbidity and mortality associated with this condition. In an accompanying paper, we have demonstrated that in the Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) rodent model, CM can be effectively prevented by a treatment combining sub-lethal doses of lipopolysaccharide S (LPS) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Since LPS is not suitable for human therapy, we investigated whether lovastatin would represent a suitable substitute. This compound, widely used to lower cholesterol levels in plasma, shares with LPS the ability to elicit an anti-inflammatory response by activating the Nrf-2 gene, and when given to P. berghei-infected mice prevents to some extent the onset of CM. We show here that lovastatin- and VEGF-treated mice did not develop CM and showed few signs, if any, of endothelial damage and systemic inflammation. The combination treatment was much more effective than lovastatin and VEGF alone. Immunohistochemistry and gene expression analysis indicated that VEGF and LPS together overturned the two pathogenic mechanisms responsible for the development of CM: endothelial damage and disregulated activation of the inflammatory response. These findings provide the rationale for investigating the therapeutic potential of these compounds in human CM as well as in other inflammatory pathologies that respond poorly to steroid and non-steroid anti-inflammatory therapy.", 
    "142": "Statin therapy is known to increase blood glucose levels in humans. Statins utilize pregnane X receptor (PXR) and serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 2 (SGK2) to activate phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PEPCK1) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) genes, thereby increasing glucose production in human liver cells. Here, the novel statin/PXR/SGK2-mediated signaling pathway has now been characterized for hepatic gluconeogenesis. Statin-activated PXR scaffolds the protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) and SGK2 to stimulate PP2C to dephosphorylate SGK2 at threonine 193. Non-phosphorylated SGK2 co-activates PXR-mediated trans-activation of promoters of gluconeogenic genes in human liver cells, thereby enhancing gluconeogenesis. This gluconeogenic statin-PXR-SGK2 signal is not present in mice, in which statin treatment suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis. These findings provide the basis for statin-associated side effects such as an increased risk for Type 2 diabetes.",

This could potentially improve adherence for those patients currently taking many separate tablets and also allow ready tailoring of a particular drug combination/drug release for the needs of an individual. The polypill here represents a cardiovascular treatment regime with the incorporation of an immediate release compartment with aspirin and hydrochlorothiazide and three sustained release compartments containing pravastatin, atenolol, and ramipril. X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) were used to assess drug-excipient interaction.

    "144": "Statins (HMGCR/HMG-CoA reductase [3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase] inhibitors) are widely used to lower blood cholesterol levels but have been shown to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the molecular mechanism underlying diabetogenic effects remains to be elucidated. Here we show that statins significantly increase the expression of key gluconeogenic enzymes (such as G6PC [glucose-6-phosphatase] and PCK1 (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 [soluble]) in vitro and in vivo and promote hepatic glucose output. Statin treatment activates autophagic flux in HepG2 cells. Acute suppression of autophagy with lysosome inhibitors in statin treated HepG2 cells reduced gluconeogenic enzymes expression and glucose output. Importantly, the ability of statins to increase gluconeogenesis was impaired when ATG7 was deficient and BECN1 was absent, suggesting that autophagy plays a critical role in the diabetogenic effects of statins. Moreover autophagic vacuoles and gluconeogenic genes expression in the liver of diet-induced obese mice were increased by statins, ultimately leading to elevated hepatic glucose production, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance. Together, these data demonstrate that chronic statin therapy results in insulin resistance through the activation of hepatic gluconeogenesis, which is tightly coupled to hepatic autophagy. These data further contribute to a better understanding of the diabetogenic effects of stains in the context of insulin resistance.",

The absolute short-term mortality was 27.3% in statin users and 33% in nonusers that represented a significant risk reduction of mortality (OR, .73; 95% CI, .54-.97). For long-term mortality, the effect was less evident (OR, .71; 95% CI, .43-1.15).

In addition the serum sLox-1 and hs-CRP levels were lower in the loading-dose rosuvastatin-treated group than in the control-treated group at 30\u00a0days after PCI. However, the decreased values of sLox-1and hs-CRP from 24\u00a0h after PCI to 30\u00a0days after PCI did not show any significant difference between the two groups.

The inverse association between statin or statin plus aspirin use and risk of Barrett's was significantly greater with longer duration of use. Meta-analysis of pooled data (1098 Barrett's, 2085 controls) showed that statin use was significantly associated with a reduced risk of Barrett's esophagus [pooled adjusted OR 0.63 (95 % CI 0.51-0.77)].",

The reduction in event recurrence has since been demonstrated across all levels of risk and in elderly patients. As a result, it is now accepted practice for statins to be prescribed universally in secondary prevention unless contraindicated. The extension of this policy into the primary prevention setting is more problematic, with moral and financial issues arising from the long-term treatment of many young apparently healthy individuals. For these reasons it is necessary to prove not only the financial sustainability of such a strategy but also the long-term safety of statins and the degree of benefit that might be expected.", 
    "183": "Atorvastatin has protective effects against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injuries and ischemia-reperfusion arrhythmia. This study was designed to investigate whether atorvastatin is able to protect against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury by enhancing the expression of Connexin 43 (Cx43) via the activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway and mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels. Isolated perfused rat hearts were treated with classic ischemia postconditioning (IPOST), atorvastatin, and atorvastatin combined with inhibitor of PI3K and K(ATP) channels, respectively, after 30min of LAD ischemia and then subjected to reperfusion for 120min. The QRS duration and the ischemia-reperfusion ventricular arrhythmia were assessed. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB) levels were measured and the Cx43 expression was assessed by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. After 120min of reperfusion, atorvastatin and IPOST significantly decreased the QRS duration and inhibited ventricular arrhythmia. They also decreased the levels of LDH and CK-MB. Meanwhile, atorvastatin and IPOST also significantly enhanced the Cx43 expression and the phosphorylation of Cx43. Such protective effects were abolished in the presence of the inhibitor of PI3K or the inhibitor of mitochondrial K(ATP) channels. This study suggests that atorvastatin protected against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury and enhanced the expression of Cx43 by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway and mitochondrial K(ATP) channels.",

This study evaluated the efficacy of low-density lipoprotein apheresis (LDL-A) in patients with CCE. Patients with CCE who showed renal deterioration after vascular interventions were studied retrospectively. Information on demographic variables, clinical measurements, and medication use was collected. The outcomes were incidence of maintenance dialysis and mortality at 24 weeks. A total of 49 patients with CCE were included, among whom 37 (76%) were diagnosed pathologically and the remainder were diagnosed clinically. The median estimated GFR at baseline and at diagnosis were 40.5 and 13.4\u2009mL/min per 1.73\u2009m(2) , respectively. Corticosteroids were used in 42 patients (86%), statins in 30 patients (61%), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in 29 patients (59%). LDL-A was performed in 25 patients (LDL-A group), and not in 24 patients (control group). Smoking (100% vs. 72%, P\u2009=\u20090.02), white blood cell count (8900/mm(3) vs. 7000/mm(3) ) and corticosteroid use (96% vs. 75%) were higher in the LDL-A group compared with the control group, but there were no differences in other demographic and clinical parameters between the groups. Patients in the LDL-A group had a lower incidence of maintenance dialysis (2/25 (8%) vs. 8/24 (33%), P\u2009<\u20090.05), and a trend towards lower mortality (2/25 (8%) vs. 7/24 (29%), P\u2009=\u20090.074).

Atorvastatin is the most prescribed statin and has obtained generic status. We recently had a clinical development program evaluating a combination of atorvastatin with a GPR119 agonist as a treatment for dyslipidemia, where toxicological evaluations in dogs were completed. There were several challenges related to selecting doses for atorvastatin, including understanding the dose-exposure relationship from different drug forms used by the innovator in their general toxicology studies, bioanalytical assays that did not separate and quantify parent from metabolites, and high variability in the systemic exposures following oral dosing. The studies in this report characterized the toxicokinetics and toxicity of atorvastatin in the dog for up to 13-weeks. Overall, there were no notable differences in the toxicokinetics of atorvastatin or the two active hydroxylated metabolites between the sexes at Week 13. However, systemic exposures were markedly lower at Week 13 compared to that observed at Week 4, suggesting induction of metabolism or reduced absorption from the gastrointestinal tract following oral dosing. Changes in laboratory chemistries included increased liver enzyme levels and lower cholesterol levels. Histopathologic evaluation revealed multifocal minimal to slight hemorrhages in the submucosa of the gallbladder; all findings were reversible. The information from these studies along with the existing clinical experience with atorvastatin can be used to design robust toxicology studies in dogs and reduce animal use.",

    "227": "We retrospectively identified patients with symptomatic internal carotid artery occlusion. Clinical characteristics and ultrasound parameters, including collateral networks, were analyzed. Predictors for recurrent ipsilateral ischemia were investigated by Cox regression analysis.", 
    "228": "Of 68 patients, at least 1 recurrent ischemic event within the same vascular territory was observed in 14 patients (20.6%) within 2 to 92 days (median, 29.5 days). The median follow-up period was 6 months. Diabetes mellitus and previous transient ischemic attack were associated with recurrence, as was activation of the maximum number of collateral pathways on transcranial ultrasound (28.6% versus 5.6%; P=0.03). Furthermore, flow in the posterior cerebral arteries was higher in patients with recurrence in ipsilateral and contralateral posterior cerebral artery P2 segments (76 IQR 37.5 versus 59, IQR 22.5 cm/s and 68, IQR 35.6 versus 52, IQR 21 cm/s; P<0.01 and 0.02).", 
    "229": "Flow increases in both posterior cerebral artery P2 segments suggest intensified compensatory efforts when other collaterals are insufficient. Together with the presence of diabetes mellitus and a history of transient ischemic attack, this duplex parameter indicates that patients with internal carotid artery are at particular risk of recurrent ischemia.", 
    "230": "Loss of sexual desire is increasingly recognized as a consequence of many disease processes, and one that can have a significant negative impact on quality of life. This review explores the biological and psychological aspects of desire, as well as the aetiology and therapeutic options for loss of desire.", 
    "231": "Discoveries have been made in terms of the physiology of desire in men, in that it is affected by estradiol as well as testosterone. It has also been shown that desire is less gender specific in androphilic women than in androphilic men and gynaephilic men and women. Fatigue has been described as the most common self-reported cause of loss of desire, with communication as the most common method for addressing this. In men, a clear distinction has been shown between disorders of arousal and disorders of desire, suggesting that they should remain as separate conditions in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria. Loss of desire has been proven to be a significant consequence of diabetes, multiple sclerosis and polycystic ovary syndrome and can occur as a side-effect of statins and 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors. Testosterone therapy may be an effective treatment for loss of desire in both men and women, and is safe in the treatment of men who have been treated for prostate cancer. It also has a significant impact on desire when used in the treatment of individuals with gender dysphoria. Nonhormonal treatments including flibanserin and new methods of therapy may also be effective.", 
    "232": "Loss of desire is underrecognized as a symptom of disease or as a complaint in its own right. As further developments in treatment options, both therapies based and pharmacological, are made, it is increasingly important that clinicians enquire about sexual dysfunction, including loss of desire, at every consultation.", 
    "233": "HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid (MVA); this is the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway that synthesizes cholesterol. Statins, HMGCR inhibitors, are widely used as cholesterol-reducing drugs. However, statin-induced myopathy is the most adverse side effect of statins. To eludicate the mechanisms underlying statin the myotoxicity and HMGCR function in the skeletal muscle, we developed the skeletal muscle-specific HMGCR knockout mice. Knockout mice exhibited postnatal myopathy with elevated serum creatine kinase levels and necrosis. Myopathy in knockout mice was completely rescued by the oral administration of MVA. These results suggest that skeletal muscle toxicity caused by statins is dependent on the deficiencies of HMGCR enzyme activity and downstream metabolites of the mevalonate pathway in skeletal muscles rather than the liver or other organs.",

    "236": "Sixty two consecutive subjects, under 50 years of age, who underwent coronary angiography (CAG) with the aspect of CAD, were included in this case control study. They were divided into two groups of 31 subjects, namely CAD (cases) and non-CAD (controls) group, according to CAG data. Presence of conventional coronary risk factors, drug history, and anthropometric data were recorded. Then, each subject underwent standard transthoracic echocardiography for measuring EFT in the proximal part of right ventricular outflow tract in the parasternal long axis view at end diastole, as well as other parameters of systolic and diastolic function, and left ventricle (LV) mass. Images were stored for offline analysis when the echocardiocardiographers were blind to CAG data.", 
    "237": "Among baseline characteristics, waist circumference, triglyceride levels, cigarette smoking and history of statin use were significantly higher in the CAD group. The body mass index (BMI) was significantly higher in the non-CAD group. According to echocardiographic data, the EFT with a cut off value of 2.95 mm could well differentiate subjects in each group. The LV mass and E/e were significantly higher in CAD group, in addition to EFT. Also, there was a significant correlation between EFT and waist circumference, as well as LV mass. However, no significant relation was between EFT and LV systolic and diastolic function.",

    "239": "Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) is a multifunctional protein that has important roles in inflammation and wound healing. Its aberrant regulation may contribute to many disease processes such as heart disease. The PAI-1 promoter is responsive to multiple inputs including cytokines, growth factors, steroids and oxidative stress. The statin drugs, atorvastatin, mevastatin and rosuvastatin, increased basal and stimulated expression of the PAI-1 promoter 3-fold. A statin-responsive, nuclear hormone response element was previously identified in the PAI-1 promoter, but it was incompletely characterized. We characterized this direct repeat (DR) of AGGTCA with a 3-nucleotide spacer at -269/-255 using deletion and directed mutagenesis. Deletion or mutation of this element increased basal transcription from the promoter suggesting that it repressed PAI-1 transcription in the unliganded state. The half-site spacing and the ligand specificity suggested that this might be a pregnane X receptor (PXR) responsive element. Computational molecular docking showed that atorvastatin, mevastatin and rosuvastatin were structurally compatible with the PXR ligand-binding pocket in its agonist conformation. Experiments with Gal4 DNA binding domain fusion proteins showed that Gal4-PXR was activated by statins while other DR + 3 binding nuclear receptor fusions were not. Overexpression of PXR further enhanced PAI-1 transcription in response to statins. Finally, ChIP experiments using Halo-tagged PXR and RXR demonstrated that both components of the PXR-RXR heterodimer bound to this region of the PAI-1 promoter.",

    "241": "A multistaged (prefecture-county-township-village) stratified cluster random sampling method was used to select participants in southern Xinjiang. Twelve villages in Jiangbazi Township in Jiashi County were chosen. These villages were randomly divided into six intervention groups and six control groups, and local Uyghur aged 18 years or older residing in the village for at least 6 months were interviewed for a baseline prevalence study and to select participants for two years of comprehensive intervention including low dose simvastatin and the effects of the interventions were observed.", 
    "242": "A total of 655 participants (347 participants in the intervention groups, 308 participants in the control groups) were randomly selected from 12 villages in Jiangbazi Township, follow-up rate is 87.0%. Compared to baseline mean levels of TG and LDL-C were reduced by 1.39 mmol/L (p < 0.01) and 2.12 mmol/L (p < 0.01) respectively and levels of HDL-C increased by1.22 mmol/L (p < 0.01) in the intervention group. Lipids were controlled in 38.61% of the intervention groups vs. 3.57% of the control groups (p < 0.01). Compared with baseline lipid levels, TG, TC, LDL-C and HDL-C was significantly improved, compared with it was in control groups.", 
    "243": "Blood lipid levels of Uygur patients with dyslipidemia can be effectively improved through health education combined with low-dose statin administration. This suggests that national strategies in public health be developed to improve the treatments to low-income rural minorities with dyslipidemia.", 
    "244": "Statins are used in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular episodes. Most of recent studies regard ischemic stroke. There are more emerging results of studies suggesting usefulness of these drugs in the other types of stroke e.g. intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Searching for new methods of treatment is important, because both ICH and SAH lead to poor prognosis and severe psychomotor disability. The unquestionable role of inflammatory factors in the pathogenesis of these disorders justifies considering statin treatment. Previous results are contradictory, thus in present study we review results of studies and try to explain the potential pathomechanism of statin use in hemorrhagic strokes.", 
    "245": "Pharmacological reduction of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol using statin drugs is foundational therapy to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Here, we consider the place of nonstatin therapies that also reduce LDL cholesterol in prevention of CVD. Among conventional nonstatins, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials showed that bile acid sequestrants, niacin, and fibrates given as monotherapy each reduce CVD end points. From trials in which patients' LDL cholesterol was already well controlled on a statin, adding ezetimibe incrementally reduced CVD end points, whereas adding a fibrate or niacin showed no incremental benefit. Among emerging nonstatins, monoclonal antibodies against proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 added to a statin and given for \u226478 weeks showed preliminary evidence of reductions in CVD outcomes. Although these promising early findings contributed to the recent approval of these agents in Europe and in North America, much larger and longer duration outcomes studies are ongoing for definitive proof of CVD benefits. Other nonstatin agents recently approved in the United States include lomitapide and mipomersen, which both act via distinctive LDL receptor independent mechanisms to substantially reduce LDL cholesterol in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. We also address some unanswered questions, including measuring alternative biochemical variables to LDL cholesterol, evidence for treating children with monitoring of subclinical atherosclerosis, and potential risks of extremely low LDL cholesterol. As evidence for benefit in CVD prevention accumulates, we anticipate that clinical practice will shift toward more assertive LDL-lowering treatment, using both statins and nonstatins initiated earlier in appropriately selected patients.", 
    "246": "Statin-related myopathy is an important adverse effect of statin which is classically unpredictable. The evidence of association between solute carrier organic anion transporter 1B1 (SLCO1B1) gene T521C polymorphism and statin-related myopathy risk remained controversial. This study aimed to investigate this genetic association. Databases of PubMed, EMBASE, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Scientific Journals Database, and Wanfang Data were searched till June 17, 2015. Case-control studies investigating the association between SLCO1B1 gene T521C polymorphism and statin-related myopathy risk were included. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used for assessing the quality of included studies. Data were pooled by odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Nine studies with 1360 cases and 3082 controls were included. Cases of statin-related myopathy were found to be significantly associated with the variant C allele (TC\u200a+\u200aCC vs TT: OR\u200a=\u200a2.09, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.27-3.43, P\u200a=\u200a0.003;\u200aC vs T: OR\u200a=\u200a2.10, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.43-3.09, P\u200a<\u200a0.001), especially when statin-related myopathy was defined as an elevation of creatine kinase (CK) >10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or rhabdomyolysis (TC\u200a+\u200aCC vs TT: OR\u200a=\u200a3.83, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.41-10.39, P\u200a=\u200a0.008;\u200aC vs T: OR\u200a=\u200a2.94, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.47-5.89, P\u200a=\u200a0.002). When stratified by statin type, the association was significant in individuals receiving simvastatin (TC\u200a+\u200aCC vs TT: OR\u200a=\u200a3.09, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.64-5.85, P\u200a=\u200a0.001;\u200aC vs T: OR\u200a=\u200a3.00, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.38-6.49, P\u200a=\u200a0.005), but not in those receiving atorvastatin (TC\u200a+\u200aCC vs TT: OR\u200a=\u200a1.31, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a0.74-2.30, P\u200a=\u200a0.35;\u200aC vs T: OR\u200a=\u200a1.33, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a0.57-3.12, P\u200a=\u200a0.52). The available evidence suggests that SLCO1B1 gene T521C polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of statin-related myopathy, especially in individuals receiving simvastatin. Thus, a genetic test before initiation of statins may be meaningful for personalizing the treatment.",

Only one study reported death; none of the included studies reported cardiovascular events or fractures. There was insufficient reporting of design and methodological aspects among the included studies to enable robust assessment of risk of bias.There was limited and low-quality evidence to indicate that calcium-enriched bread increased serum calcium (1 study, 53 participants: MD -0.16 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.31), decreased serum phosphorus (53 participants: MD -0.41 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.31) and decreased the calcium \u00d7 phosphate product (53 participants: MD -0.62 mmol\u00b2/L\u00b2, 95% CI -0.77 to -0.47).Very low protein intake was not superior to conventional low protein intake in terms of effect on serum phosphorus (2 studies, 41 participants: MD -0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.50 to 0.25), serum calcium (MD 0.00 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.17), or alkaline phosphatase (MD -22.00 U/L, 95% CI -78.25 to 34.25). PTH was significantly lower in the very low protein intake group (2 studies, 41 participants: MD -69.64 pmol/L, 95% CI -139.83 to 0.54).One study reported no significant difference in the number of deaths between low phosphorus intake and normal diet (279 participants: RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.82). Low phosphorus intake decreased serum phosphorus (2 studies, 359 participants: MD -0.18 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.29 to -0.07; I(2) = 0%).One study reported post-haemodialysis supplements did not increase serum phosphorus compared to normal diet (40 participants: MD 0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.49).One study reported low phosphorus intake plus lanthanum carbonate significantly decreased FGF-23 (19 participants: MD -333.80 RU/mL, 95% CI -526.60 to -141.00), but did not decrease serum phosphorus (19 participants: MD -0.10 mg/dL, 95% CI -0.38 to 0.58) or PTH (19 participants: MD 31.60 pg/mL, 95% CI -29.82 to 93.02).",

An essential part of treatment should be non-pharmacological approach - lifestyle changes (weight loss, change in eating habits, increased physical activity). In patients in primary prevention without diabetes decision about pharmacotherapy depend on their risk of fatal cardiovascular events in the perspective of 10 years (table SCORE). In diabetic patients and in patients in secondary prevention is pharmacotherapy indicated, unless their LDL-cholesterol does not reach its target values. The primary goal of treatment is LDL-cholesterol, so pharmacotherapy should be started with statins. If the target of LDL-cholesterol is reached and hypertriglyceridemia and/or low HDL-cholesterol persist, it is recommended to add fenofibrate to statin.",

Concurrent negative effects of hyperglycemia, hypertension and hyperlipidemia on the vascular system reinforce one another. Consistent prevention of cardiovascular risk parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2T) has brought significant decline in mortality and morbidity due to cardiovascular diseases. Still there is \"residual risk\" remaining. The full use of the potential of statins and their combination with ezetimibe may lower the CV risk even more and extend the life of patients with DM2. The importance of an intervention by means of PCSK9 inhibitors for the cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with diabetes mellitus is the subject of study.", 
    "256": "Lung is one of the vital organs which is affected during the sequential development of multi-organ dysfunction in sepsis. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether combined treatment with atorvastatin and imipenem could attenuate sepsis-induced lung injury in mice. Sepsis was induced by caecal ligation and puncture. Lung injury was assessed by the presence of lung edema, increased vascular permeability, increased inflammatory cell infiltration and cytokine levels in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Treatment with atorvastatin along with imipenem reduced the lung bacterial load and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1) level in BALF. The markers of pulmonary edema such as microvascular leakage and wet-dry weight ratio were also attenuated. This was further confirmed by the reduced activity of MPO and ICAM-1 mRNA expression, indicating the lesser infiltration and adhesion of inflammatory cells to the lungs. Again, expression of mRNA and protein level of iNOS in lungs was also reduced in the combined treatment group. Based on the above findings it can be concluded that, combined treatment with atorvastatin and imipenem dampened the inflammatory response and reduced the bacterial load, thus seems to have promising therapeutic potential in sepsis-induced lung injury in mice.",

We also examined the capacity of HDL to protect LDL from in vitro oxidation and the percentage cholesterol efflux mediated by apoB depleted serum. ERN/LRP was associated with an 18% increase in HDL-C levels compared to placebo (1.55 versus 1.31 mmol/L, P<0.0001). There were significant reductions in total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, total serum apoB, lipoprotein (a), CETP activity, oxLDL, Lp-PLA2, lyso-PC, MCP1, and SAA, but no significant changes in glyc-apoB or sdLDL-apoB concentration.

Herein, we summarize epidemiologic and preclinical evidence for an association between obesity and increased risk of breast and prostate cancer incidence and mortality. Moreover, we describe data from observational studies of weight change in humans and from calorie-restriction studies in mouse models that support a potential role for weight loss in counteracting tumor-promoting properties of obesity in breast and prostate cancers. Given that weight loss is challenging to achieve and maintain, we also consider evidence linking treatments for obesity-associated co-morbidities, including metformin, statins and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with reduced breast and prostate cancer incidence and mortality. Finally, we highlight several challenges that should be considered when conducting epidemiologic and preclinical research in the area of obesity and cancer, including the measurement of obesity in population-based studies, the timing of obesity and weight change in relation to tumor latency and cancer diagnosis, and the heterogeneous nature of obesity and its associated co-morbidities. Given that obesity is a complex trait, comprised of behavioral, epidemiologic and molecular/metabolic factors, we argue that a transdisciplinary approach is the key to understanding the mechanisms linking obesity and cancer. As such, this review highlights the critical need to integrate evidence from both epidemiologic and preclinical studies to gain insight into both biologic and non-biologic mechanisms contributing to the obesity-cancer link.", 
    "262": "OATP1B1 is an influx transporter known to mediate the uptake of various endogenous compounds and xenobiotics. Several sequence variations have been discovered in the SLCO1B1 gene encoding OATP1B1. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of SLCO1B1 polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin in healthy volunteers of Macedonian origin. Twenty three participants, genotyped for SLCO1B1 c.388A > G, c.521T > C, c.571T > C, c.597C > T, c.1086C > T, c.1463G > C and c.*439T > G polymorphisms using TaqMan allelic discrimination assay, ingested a single 80 mg dose of atorvastatin. The plasma concentrations of atorvastatin were measured for 48 h using Tandem Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry, LC-MS-MS, and the peak plasma concentration (C(max)), time to peak plasma concentration (T(max)), elimination half-life (t1/2), constant rate of elimination (k(el)), mean residence time (MRT, expo), volume of distribution (Vd/kg), clearance (CL/kg), area under curve AUC(0.48h) and AUC(0-\u221e), were determined. Our data confirmed that the SLCO1B1 gene is highly polymorphic, with a frequency of the c.521T > C single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) being the lowest (app. 15%) and of all other SNPs alleles above 40%. Exceptions were c.1463G > C and c.1086C > T SNPs for which variant alleles were not identified. The strongest correlation was observed between the c.521T > C and c.571T > C SNPs pair. The haplotype analysis revealed 10 different haplotypes, with *1J/*1K/*1L being the dominant, with a frequency of app. 40%. The haplotype *15/*16/*17, containing both variant alleles of the functionally most distinguished SNPs, c.388A > G and c.521T > C, occurred with a frequency of 13%. However, *15/*16/*17 homozygotes were not identified in the study group. In this study, no significant differences in the k(el), t1/2, C(max), T(max), AUC(0-48h), AUC(0-\u221e), MRT expo, Vd and CL between the carriers of different c.388A > G, c.597C > T and c.*439T > G genotypes were observed. Subject with a variant allele C in the c.521T > C SNP, c.521CC genotype, had markedly higher values for C(max) and AUC(0.48h), 140% and 67%, respectively, in comparison with the carriers of the c.521TT genotype. Also, the carriers of the variant allele C at c.571T > C SNP, c.571 CC genotype, had 55% and 43% lower mean C(max) and AUC(0-48h) in comparison with the carrier of c.571TT. These differences lacked statistical significance due to the size of the sample. In addition, no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of atorvastatin between the *15/*16/*17 heterozygotes and *15/*16/*17 non-carriers were observed. In conclusion, this extensive analysis of the effect of SLCO1B1 polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetic profile of atorvastatin showed that c.521T > C and c.571T > C SNPs may affect the inter-individual response to atorvastatin. Additional studies, with a large sample size, are needed to confirm this finding."
