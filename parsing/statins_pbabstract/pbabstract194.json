PVD was defined as being present if it was detected in patient history as well as by nailfold capillaromicroscopy. PVD was defined as being absent if the patient history for PVD was negative and the results of nailfold capillaromicroscopy were negative. Scanning laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) was used to measure ONH and finger blood flow. Finger temperature was measured in all subjects using a contact sensor.", 
    "2": "ONH blood flow is significantly related to finger blood flow in subjects with PVD (p<0.01), but not in subjects without a PVD. Subjects with PVD had a significantly lower finger skin temperature in comparison to those without PVD (p<0.01)",

    "5": "Primary care practices in Northern Ireland and England. Method Northern Ireland practices were matched with practices in England, statin prescribing data and QOF achievement scores (for the first year post-QOF) were obtained. Crude prescribing data from matched practices were manipulated to provide a data set of Defined Daily Doses (DDDs)/1,000 patients and cost/DDD/1,000 patients for each statin drug entity covering 1 year before and after the introduction of QOF. QOF achievements were converted into percentage scores for matched practices.",

    "9": "Statins are well-tolerated, mainstay drugs in cardiovascular risk management. In addition to their cholesterol-lowering properties, statins also have anti-inflammatory, vasculoprotective, and antioxidant effects. They have also been associated in some epidemiologic studies with reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and a link between cholesterol and late-onset AD has been documented. Experimental studies in cell culture systems and animal models show that statins have neuroprotective effects that may ameliorate the damage inflicted by stroke and AD. Human studies have garnered compelling evidence that treatment with statins reduces ischemic stroke incidence independent of their lipid-lowering effects. There is also the possibility that statins and extremely low cholesterol levels may increase the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. In this review, we discuss the potential reasons for the effect of statins on stroke and AD, and the multiple mechanisms of action of this class of lipid-lowering drugs.",

    "14": "Beneficial effects of statins on cardiovascular diseases have been attributed to decreased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We tested the hypothesis that atorvastatin protects against the development of hypertension by reducing levels of NADPH oxidase-derived ROS in two hypertensive animal models. Atorvastatin was given to mice chronically infused with angiotensin (Ang) II or to apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-deficient mice fed a high-fat diet. Increased mean blood pressure (MBP) demonstrated in both animal models was significantly suppressed by atorvastatin with reduced ROS production in the aorta. Treatment with atorvastatin did not alter the mRNA level of NOX1, a catalytic subunit of NADPH oxidase, but decreased the levels of other NOX isoforms, NOX2 and NOX4, in the ApoE-deficient mice fed a high-fat diet. In the Ang II-infused model treated with statin, only the NOX4 mRNA level was reduced. Membrane translocation of Rac1 was significantly reduced in the Ang II-infused mice treated with atorvastatin. Finally, atorvastatin administered to Ang II-infused mice lacking the Nox1 gene elicited an additional decline in MBP compared to Nox1-deficient mice treated with vehicle. Together, these findings suggest that reduced expression and activity of the isoforms of NADPH oxidase, involving NOX1, NOX2, and possibly NOX4, mediate the anti-hypertensive effect of atorvastatin.", 
    "15": "Statins have been shown to have a wide range of anti-inflammatory effects on cells and tissues involved in inflammation that are unrelated to their lipid-lowering abilities. In the progression of osteoarthritis (OA), mediators of inflammation from synovial tissue and cartilage play important roles in initiating or amplifying cartilage degradation in OA. Therefore, we examined the therapeutic efficacy of intra-articularly injected statin in rabbit OA. Intra-articular injections of statin during OA development reduced the infiltration of inflammatory cells and the expression of matrix-degrading enzymes, thus limiting cartilage degradation. Intra-articular injections of statin can be promising as a disease-modifying therapy for human OA.", 
    "16": "Atherosclerosis constitutes the underlying disease to the clinical manifestations of myocardial infarction, stroke, and gangrene. Despite the success of statins, prevention of clinical events of atherosclerosis remains a major challenge in current-day cardiology. Research into the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis has led to improved mechanistic understanding of its pathogenesis and to the identification of novel therapeutic targets discussed in this review. Recent genetic and epidemiological data document shared pathologies of chronic inflammatory diseases and atherosclerosis. Anti-inflammatory treatment regimens used in these diseases, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha blockade, IL-1 receptor antagonism, and leukotriene blockade may be beneficial also in patients with coronary artery disease. Enhancing inherent atheroprotective immunity by expansion of regulatory T cells may emerge as a future therapeutic strategy. Immunization strategies directed against atherosclerosis-related antigens such as epitopes within the low-density lipoprotein particle have been extensively studied in animal models and may enter the clinical stage. Success of these novel therapies will be critically dependent on the adequate identification of patients and choice of appropriate clinical endpoints.", 
    "17": "Several observational and experimental studies have investigated the potential anabolic effects of statins on undisturbed bone but only a few recent studies have examined the effect of statins on skeletal repair. The goal of the study is to investigate any potential early anabolic effect of the systemic administration of simvastatin in low doses (based on earlier safety and efficacy studies on undisturbed bone) on fracture healing. Fifty-four skeletally mature male New Zealand White rabbits were used for the study. The rabbits were assigned to one of three experimental groups: a control group, and two groups that were orally administrated a diet with 10 and 30 mg/kg/day of simvastatin, respectively. A complete biochemical blood count was performed to exclude drug-induced complications. Half of the animals of each group were sacrificed at 15 days and the other half at 30 days after surgery at which time intervals healing quality was assessed. The bones were subjected to biomechanical testing, histomorphometric analysis and peripheral quantitative computed tomography. In animals received simvastatin of 30 mg/kg/day a significant reduction of BMD, stiffness, and energy absorbed to failure were observed. At 15 days, the amount of cartilaginous callus formation was reduced, and the void space was significantly increased, in the animals of both groups that received simvastatin when compared to the control group (p<.05). Our results suggest that simvastatin doses of 30 mg/kg/day may have a negative anabolic effect on callus formation in rabbits, whereas doses of 10 mg/kg/day seem not to produce a significant positive or a negative effect, especially at the early stages of fracture remodeling.",

    "19": "About seven million people die of cancer every year. This is largely due to development of drug resistance, particularly multidrug resistance, in the tumor cells. Multidrug resistance (MDR) arises due to over-expression of MDR proteins in the cancer cells, which cause efflux of anticancer drugs from the cells using ATP. MDR proteins are members of the family of ABC transporters that occur universally, and are structurally and functionally conserved during evolution. In Drosophila, the germ cell attractant peptide is secreted by an ABC transport protein, mdr49. Recently, the peptide has been shown to undergo conjugation with the lipid geranylgeranyl before secretion. If conjugation with the lipid is inhibited, mdr49 protein is unable to transport the peptide. Similarly, in the case of yeast mating factor pheromone, farnesylation is required to occur before the export of the pheromone by ste6 protein, an ABC transporter. In view of the homology of mdr49 and ste6 proteins with mammalian MDR proteins, we postulate that the drug transporters also require their ligands to be conjugated to a lipid. This view finds support from the studies with synthetic inhibitors of geranylgeranyl-/farnesyl-diphosphate synthetase or transferase: The inhibitors are reported to overcome multidrug resistance in cancer cell lines or xenografts in animals. Thus, the MDR transporters also appear to require their substrates to be conjugated with a lipid. Statins are the widely used inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase. By depleting precursors of the mevalonate pathway, statins can prevent the formation of lipids like geranylgeranyl and farnesyl. Accordingly, they should also be able to overcome multidrug resistance in cancer. A few reports in the literature indicate that they appear to do so. Statins are in wide clinical use, and their pharmacology is well known. Besides, statins per se have mild beneficial effect on the outcome of the disease. We propose that statins should be seriously investigated for their ability to overcome multidrug resistance in cancer. This should be done after careful standardization of the protocol of simultaneous treatment with anticancer drugs and a statin.",

All then received open-label colesevelam 3.75 g/d for 18 weeks (period III), with follow-up 2 weeks later. The primary endpoint was percent change in low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol from baseline to week 8. Secondary endpoints included percent change in other lipoprotein variables, including non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL)-cholesterol. Adverse events were also evaluated.",

    "24": "Use of common guidelines for primary prevention of cardiovascular events based on 10-year risk results in undertreatment of younger individuals, especially women, since age and sex are major determinants of global risk. Women in their late 40s have a 10-year risk lower than the 10% threshold used for cholesterol-lowering treatment even in the presence of marked elevations of blood pressure or cholesterol. Removal of age from risk algorithms and use of lifetime global risk to treat individuals according to the degree of their modifiable risk factors rather than demographics has been proposed. Initiation of therapy at younger ages, aiming at \"primordial\" prevention of atherosclerotic disease rather than focusing on cardiovascular events, will result in saving more quality-adjusted life-years. Generic medications can be obtained at an affordable cost, and concerns about long-term safety and efficacy can be tested in a clinical trial of younger individuals at low 10-year risk but high lifetime risk.", 
    "25": "Statins are the most commonly prescribed drugs in the world and are established first-line therapy for cardiovascular disease. Statin toxicity is related to dose, age, gender, ethnicity, body mass, renal and endocrine function and also to concomitant medications - particularly those that inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4.", 
    "26": "This review describes the tests used before initiation of statin therapy, to establish their efficacy and to monitor their principal side effects. Lipids and apolipoproteins are used to measure efficacy and compliance, whereas transaminases and creatine kinase are used to measure toxicity. Guidelines agree in general, but differ in the details of measurement of baseline levels, action limits and management strategies for statin toxicity. Genetic factors are relevant to both the efficacy and the toxicity of statin therapy, with efficacy being associated with polymorphisms in lipid-related genes, whereas a function-related polymorphism in the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1; SLCO1B1) is associated with 60% of the cases of myopathy with high-dose simvastatin.",

    "28": "Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a rare but life-threatening disease characterized by significant increases in pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) and right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), therefore early diagnosis and proper treatment of PH is very important. Statins confer cardiovascular benefits beyond the reduction of serum cholesterol through antiproliferative and antiinflammatory mechanisms and induction of endothelial nitric oxide expression. In pneumonectomized rats injected with monocrotaline, simvastatin reversed established pulmonary hypertension and conferred a 100% survival advantage.",

    "30": "In this prospective before-after pilot trial, 19 patients with primary and secondary causes of PH referred to Khorrami Hospital in Qom, Iran were recruited. Patients were treated with simvastatin, beginning at 20 mg/daily for 2 months, then increasing to 40 mg/daily for another 4 months. Echocardiographic Doppler estimates of systolic pulmonary artery pressures (SPAP) were measured for each patient before prescribing simvastatin and at the end of treatment. Also demographic data, history of smoking and heart functional class (NYHA) before and after treatment were recorded.", 
    "31": "Out of 19 patients with PH, fifteen were males (78.95%) and four were females (21.1%) with the mean age of 66 (SD=15.28) yr, range between 18 to 83 years. The commonest cause of PH was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in 15 patients (78.9%). Simvastatin significantly ameliorated PH from 74.79 (SD=23.52) mmHg to 67.21 (SD=20.55) mmHg (P<0.001). Whereas, heart functional class changes were not statistically significant (P=0.157).", 
    "32": "In this study, we demonstrated that simvastatin treatment decreased SPAP in patients with PH. As the pathogenesis of PH involves inappropriate proliferation and constriction of vascular smooth-muscle cells, and deficiencies of endogenous vasodilators such as prostacyclin and endothelial-derived nitric oxide, the antiproliferative, antiinflammatory and antithrombogenic effect of simvastatin seems to be useful. This study has led physicians to believe that simvastatin may be beneficial for the treatment of PH.", 
    "33": "1. Obesity is increasingly common among liver transplantation (LT) recipients and donors. Outcomes following LT for selected patients with class I-III obesity are similar to those for nonobese recipients. In patients who are otherwise satisfactory candidates for LT, a high body mass index, as long as it does not present a technical barrier, should not be considered to be an absolute contraindication to LT. 2. The most common causes of death beyond the first year of LT are, in descending order of frequency, graft failure (especially secondary to hepatitis C virus recurrence), malignancy, cardiovascular disease, infections, and renal failure. Metabolic syndrome is an important risk factor for each of these etiologies of posttransplant death. Posttransplant diabetes, posttransplant hypertension, and an original diagnosis of cryptogenic cirrhosis, which is commonly associated with metabolic syndrome, are all associated with an increased risk of post-LT mortality. Features of metabolic syndrome should be screened for and treated in LT recipients. 3. Because of the physiological mechanism of post-LT hypertension, which includes renal arteriolar constriction secondary to calcineurin inhibition, calcium channel blocking agents are a good pharmacological treatment modality and have been shown to be effective in renal protection in randomized controlled trials of posttransplant hypertension. 4. It is rare for dietary changes and weight reduction to result in normalization of the lipid profile. Statins should thus be initiated early in the course of management of post-LT dyslipidemia. Forty milligrams of simvastatin per day, 40 mg of atorvastatin per day, and 20 mg of pravastatin per day are reasonable starting doses for post-LT hypercholesterolemia. It is important to remember that the effects of statin therapy are additive to those of a controlled diet (eg, a Mediterranean diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids, fruits, vegetables, and dietary fiber). 5. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, an increasingly common etiology of cirrhosis and liver failure, recurs commonly after LT and may also arise de novo. Treatment should be directed at managing obesity and complications of metabolic syndrome. Optimal immunosuppression in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is still evolving but should include steroid minimization.", 
    "34": "Intimal hyperplasia is a major cause of restenosis after the interventional or surgical treatment of occlusive arterial disease. We investigated the effects of clopidogrel, calcium dobesilate, nebivolol, and atorvastatin on the development of intimal hyperplasia in rabbits after carotid venous bypass surgery. We divided 40 male New Zealand rabbits into 4 study groups and 1 control group. After occluding the carotid arteries of the rabbits, we constructed jugular venous grafts between the proximal and the distal segments of the occluded artery. Thereafter, group 1 (control) received no medication. We administered daily oral doses of clopidogrel to group 2, calcium dobesilate to group 3, nebivolol to group 4, and atorvastatin to group 5. The rabbits were killed 28 days postoperatively. The arterialized jugular venous grafts were extracted for histopathologic examination. Intimal thicknesses were 42.87 +/- 6.95 microm (group 2), 46.5 +/- 9.02 microm (group 3), 34.12 +/- 5.64 microm (group 4), and 48.37 +/- 6.16 microm (group 5), all significantly less than the 95.12 +/- 9.93 microm in group 1 (all P < 0.001). Medial thicknesses were 94 +/- 6 microm (group 2), 101.5 +/- 13.52 microm (group 3), 90.5 +/- 9.69 microm (group 4), and 101.37 +/- 7.99 microm (group 5), all significantly thinner than the 126.62 +/- 13.53 microm in group 1 (all P < 0.001). In our experimental model of carotid venous bypass grafting in rabbits, clopidogrel, calcium dobesilate, nebivolol, and atorvastatin each effectively reduced the development of intimal hyperplasia. Herein, we discuss our findings and review the medical literature.", 
    "35": "Hypertension in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) strongly associates with cardiovascular events. Among patients with CKD, reducing the accumulation of uremic toxins may protect against the development of hypertension and progression of renal damage, but there are no established therapies to accomplish this. Here, overexpression of human kidney-specific organic anion transporter SLCO4C1 in rat kidney reduced hypertension, cardiomegaly, and inflammation in the setting of renal failure. In addition, SLCO4C1 overexpression decreased plasma levels of the uremic toxins guanidino succinate, asymmetric dimethylarginine, and the newly identified trans-aconitate. We found that xenobiotic responsive element core motifs regulate SLCO4C1 transcription, and various statins, which act as inducers of nuclear aryl hydrocarbon receptors, upregulate SLCO4C1 transcription. Pravastatin, which is cardioprotective, increased the clearance of asymmetric dimethylarginine and trans-aconitate in renal failure. These data suggest that drugs that upregulate SLCO4C1 may have therapeutic potential for patients with CKD.",

However, the meta-analysis was criticized for its methodology, and several retrospective studies found no beneficial effect. We present the results of a new systematic review, which differs from the previous systematic review in its methodology, and by inclusion of the results of a fourth randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Summary of Review- All randomized, placebo-controlled trials investigating the effect of statins on vasospasm, delayed cerebral ischemia, and functional outcome in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were included. Outcomes were the number of patients with transcranial Doppler vasospasm, delayed cerebral ischemia, poor outcome, and mortality during follow-up. Effect sizes were expressed in (pooled) risk ratio estimates. Data were pooled using random-effects models.",

    "39": "The in vitro antifungal activities of primycin (PN) and various statins against some opportunistic pathogenic fungi were investigated. PN completely inhibited the growth of Candida albicans (MIC 64 microg ml(-1)) and Candida glabrata (MIC 32 microg ml(-1)), and was very effective against Paecilomyces variotii (MIC 2 microg ml(-1)), but had little effect on Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus or Rhizopus oryzae (MICs >64 microg ml(-1)). The fungi exhibited different degrees of sensitivity to the statins; fluvastatin (FLV) and simvastatin (SIM) exerted potent antifungal activities against a wide variety of clinically important fungal pathogens. Atorvastatin, rosuvastatin and lovastatin (LOV) had a slight effect against all fungal isolates tested, whereas pravastatin was completely ineffective. The in vitro interactions between PN and the different statins were investigated using a standard chequerboard titration method. When PN was combined with FLV, LOV or SIM, both synergistic and additive effects were observed. The extent of inhibition was higher when these compounds were applied together, and the concentrations of PN and the given statin needed to block fungal growth completely could be decreased by several dilution steps. Similar interactions were observed when the variability of the within-species sensitivities was investigated.", 
    "40": "Elucidation of the rate-determining process in the overall hepatic elimination of drugs is critical for predicting their intrinsic hepatic clearance and the impact of variation of sequestration clearance on their systemic concentration. The present study investigated the rate-determining process in the overall hepatic elimination of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors pravastatin, pitavastatin, atorvastatin, and fluvastatin both in rats and humans. The uptake of these statins was saturable in both rat and human hepatocytes. Intrinsic hepatic clearance obtained by in vivo pharmacokinetic analysis in rats was close to the uptake clearance determined by the multiple indicator dilution method but much greater than the intrinsic metabolic clearance extrapolated from an in vitro model using liver microsomes. In vivo uptake clearance of the statins in humans (pravastatin, 1.44; pitavastatin, 30.6; atorvastatin, 12.7; and fluvastatin, 62.9 ml/min/g liver), which was obtained by multiplying in vitro uptake clearance determined in cryopreserved human hepatocytes by rat scaling factors, was within the range of overall in vivo intrinsic hepatic clearance (pravastatin, 0.84-1.2; pitavastatin, 14-35; atorvastatin, 11-19; and fluvastatin, 123-185 ml/min/g liver), whereas the intrinsic metabolic clearance of atorvastatin and fluvastatin was considerably low compared with their intrinsic hepatic clearance. Their uptake is the rate-determining process in the overall hepatic elimination of the statins in rats, and this activity likely holds true for humans. In vitro-in vivo extrapolation of the uptake clearance using a cryopreserved human hepatocytes model and rat scaling factors will be effective for predicting in vivo intrinsic hepatic clearance involving active uptake.", 
    "41": "The benefits of statins in patients with stable coronary syndrome is indisputable, however their early use in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is under debate. There are few existing clinical trials and meta-analysis results on this and their results provide little clarification. However, most of the registries have found them to be efficient. There are no studies that show this therapy to be unsafe, so its inclusion in treatment guidelines during the acute phase of ACS could be studied.", 
    "42": "Enzymes from natural product biosynthetic pathways are attractive candidates for creating tailored biocatalysts to produce semisynthetic pharmaceutical compounds. LovD is an acyltransferase that converts the inactive monacolin J acid (MJA) into the cholesterol-lowering lovastatin. LovD can also synthesize the blockbuster drug simvastatin using MJA and a synthetic alpha-dimethylbutyryl thioester, albeit with suboptimal properties as a biocatalyst. Here we used directed evolution to improve the properties of LovD toward semisynthesis of simvastatin. Mutants with improved catalytic efficiency, solubility, and thermal stability were obtained, with the best mutant displaying an approximately 11-fold increase in an Escherichia coli-based biocatalytic platform. To understand the structural basis of LovD enzymology, seven X-ray crystal structures were determined, including the parent LovD, an improved mutant G5, and G5 cocrystallized with ligands. Comparisons between the structures reveal that beneficial mutations stabilize the structure of G5 in a more compact conformation that is favorable for catalysis.",

    "53": "Despite the initial enthusiasm, the significant number of patients in whom sildenafil is contraindicated or ineffective is a major challenge to all urologists. Our aim was to determine the safety and efficacy of adjunctive atorvastatin in restoring normal erectile function in hypercholesterolemic (low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol >120 mg per 100 ml) sildenafil nonresponders. The study comprised 131 men with ED not responding to sildenafil citrate. They were randomized either to 40 mg atorvastatin daily (n=66, group 1) or matching placebo (n=65, group 2) for 12 weeks while they were taking on-demand 100 mg sildenafil. Erectile function was subjectively assessed using the 5-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) questionnaire and response to the global efficacy question (GEQ). Serum biochemical and lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) analyses were performed at baseline and repeated at post-treatment weeks 6 and 12. Compared with the placebo group (59 patients, mean age+/-s.d. 61.9+/-6.1, mean years ED 3.9+/-1.8), the atorvastatin group (59 patients, mean age+/-s.d. 63.9+/-6.9, mean years ED 3.7+/-1.6) had significantly greater improvements in all IIEF-5 questions (P=0.01) and GEQ (P=0.001). Subgroup analyses did reveal trends in the atorvastatin group to indicate that a change in the IIEF-5 score is affected by age, severity of ED and baseline serum levels of LDL. Patients with moderate (r=0.28, P=0.01) and severe (r=0.20, P=0.01) ED had better positive response rates to adjunctive atorvastatin than patients with mild to moderate ED. None of the patients taking atorvastatin achieved a response of 5 to the IIEF-5 questions and none of the patients regained normal erectile function as defined by the IIEF-5 score >21. Subjects experienced a statistically significant but modest improvement in erectile function. Further investigation is needed to test the usefulness of long-term atorvastatin administration to restore erectile function in sildenafil nonresponders.", 
    "54": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is second only to Alzheimer's disease as the most common devastating human neurodegenerative disorder. Despite intense investigation, no interdictive therapy is available for PD. We investigated whether simvastatin, a Food and Drug Administration-approved cholesterol-lowering drug, could protect against nigrostriatal degeneration after 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) intoxication to model PD in mice. First, MPP(+) induced the activation of p21(ras) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in mouse microglial cells. Inhibition of MPP(+)-induced activation of NF-kappaB by Deltap21(ras), a dominant-negative mutant of p21(ras), supported the involvement of p21(ras) in MPP(+)-induced microglial activation of NF-kappaB. Interestingly, simvastatin attenuated activation of both p21(ras) and NF-kappaB in MPP(+)-stimulated microglial cells. Consistently, we found a very rapid activation of p21(ras) in vivo in the substantia nigra pars compacta of MPTP-intoxicated mice. However, after oral administration, simvastatin entered into the nigra, reduced nigral activation of p21(ras), attenuated nigral activation of NF-kappaB, inhibited nigral expression of proinflammatory molecules, and suppressed nigral activation of glial cells. These findings paralleled dopaminergic neuronal protection, normalized striatal neurotransmitters, and improved motor functions in MPTP-intoxicated mice. Similarly, pravastatin, another cholesterol-lowering drug, suppressed microglial inflammatory responses and protected dopaminergic neurons in MPTP-intoxicated mice, but at levels less than simvastatin. Furthermore, both the statins administered 2 d after initiation of the disease were still capable of inhibiting the demise of dopaminergic neurons and concomitant loss of neurotransmitters, suggesting that statins are capable of slowing down the progression of neuronal loss in the MPTP mouse model. Therefore, we conclude that statins may be of therapeutic benefit for PD patients.", 
    "55": "Rosuvastatin (RST) and atorvastatin (ATO) are prescription drugs and members in the statin family used for the treatment of elevated cholesterol levels. A method using solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for the determination of ATO, RST and its metabolite rosuvastatin lactone (RSTL) in sewage and surface water samples has been developed. In the influent and effluent samples collected from 11 sewage treatment plants located in Ontario, Canada, ATO, RST, and RSTL were detected in all samples with median concentrations of 166 ng L(-1) (influent) and 77 ng L(-1) (effluent) for ATO, 448 ng L(-1) (influent) and 324 ng L(-1) (effluent) for RST, as well as 158 ng L(-1) (influent) and 41 ng L(-1) (effluent) for RSTL. Due to the inter-conversion between RST and RSTL, the total concentration of RST and RSTL in a sewage sample should be reported. The median removal rate by wastewater treatment was 66% for ATO and 22% for RST and RSTL combined. These statins were quite persistent in sewage. After a storage period of 21 and 62 days, there was only a slight decrease in ATO concentration and no change in the total RST concentrations. These three compounds were also detected in a number of surface water samples at low ng L(-1) concentrations. This is the first reported occurrence and fate of RST and RSTL in the Canadian aquatic environment.", 
    "56": "Although assessment of traditional coronary heart disease risk factors can often stratify individuals into low- or high-risk categories, additional means are needed to more precisely classify people clinically defined as intermediate-risk, to guide the intensity of risk-reducing therapies. The recognition that inflammatory pathways are important in the progression of atherosclerosis and its complications has prompted investigation to identify circulating risk markers that may be useful in risk stratification. This article summarizes recent studies on the current use of an emerging group of inflammatory markers: soluble CD-40 ligand, interleukin-18, myeloperoxidase, B-type natriuretic peptides, secretory phospholipase A(2), lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2), and C-reactive protein. The demonstration that lowering C-reactive protein along with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with statins reduces events beyond cholesterol lowering alone suggests that titration of therapies using other emerging inflammatory markers may further reduce the toll of atherosclerosis in adult populations.",

Without aggressive management of the disease as well as comorbidities and risk factors, peripheral arterial disease may progress and place patients at risk for amputation of the affected limb. In addition, patients affected by peripheral arterial disease are at increased risk for death from both cardiovascular and noncardiovascular causes. Although traditionally felt to be a disease of Caucasian men, women compose a significant portion of patients with peripheral arterial disease, especially among the elderly. Increased prevalence of asymptomatic disease in women can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment. Without the appropriate medical and or surgical intervention, women are at risk of poor procedural outcomes and increased mortality. This review will focus on the differences in peripheral arterial disease based on gender and how these differences can affect the presentation, diagnosis and treatment of peripheral arterial disease in women.", 
    "58": "We evaluated the association of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with modifiable risk factors such as smoking and prescription medications, and investigated possible risk factors unique to patients who had never smoked. The UK General Practice Research Database was used to identify a cohort of patients with a first diagnosis of COPD (n = 1927) along with age- and sex-matched controls without COPD (n = 16 546). The incidence of COPD diagnoses and the risks associated with medication use, co-morbidities, and demographic factors, were estimated. The incidence of COPD was 2.6 per 1000 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.5-2.7) among 40-89 year-olds. The risk significantly increased in current and former smokers (OR: 6.15 [95% CI: 5.41-7.00] and 3.45 [95% CI: 2.96-4.02]), respectively. The risk was significantly lower in former smokers than current smokers (OR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.52-0.71). Current statin use was significantly associated with a reduced risk (OR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.25-0.80). In never smokers, risk factors included advanced age and obesity. The risk in never smokers was more strongly related to paracetamol use (OR: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.33-2.49) than in current and former smokers (OR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.18-1.86). In summary, COPD is associated with a range of cardiovascular and respiratory conditions and the risk is influenced by current and past medications. While the risk factors are similar in smokers and never smokers, some were unique to never smokers. Moreover, subjects who stopped smoking had a substantially lower COPD risk than those who continued smoking.", 
    "59": "3-Hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase is the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-determining step in cholesterol synthesis; it is also the target for statin drugs, which are competitive inhibitors of the enzyme. We examine potentially important enzyme-ligand interactions currently not incorporated into statin drug design: weak, induction/dispersion interactions between ligands and residue tyrosine 479 in the HMGCoA reductase active site. HMGCoA is a large molecule with a long coenzyme A \"tail\", and in order to study the interactions of interest, it was necessary to find the smallest possible portion of the HMGCoA molecule that would serve as a reasonable model for the entire molecule. Using this minimal model, we calculated BSSE-corrected electronic interaction energies between the residue and the ligand molecule using several DFT methods (local, hybrid, and gradient-corrected DFT methods) as well as MP2. We also performed several in silico mutations of the tyrosine 479 residue to determine the potential effects of these changes on protein-ligand interaction energies. Our work shows that this previously unexploited protein-ligand interaction between tyrosine residue 479 and HMGCoA can be important in the design of future statin drugs. Per our previous work, our results show that local DFT methods more closely match MP2 energy values for aromatic binding than do hybrid or gradient-corrected DFT methods.", 
    "60": "Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a condition caused by mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene. Expression of LDLR is highly regulated and excess receptor expression is cytotoxic. To incorporate essential gene regulation into a gene therapy vector for FH, we generated vectors in which the expression of therapeutic human LDLR gene, or luciferase reporter gene, is driven by 10 kb of human LDLR genomic DNA encompassing the promoter region including elements essential for physiologically regulated expression. Using luciferase expression and specific LDL binding and internalization assays, we have shown in vitro that the genomic promoter element confers long-term, physiologically regulated gene expression and complementation of receptor deficiency in culture for 240 cell-generations. This was demonstrated in the presence of sterols or statins, modifiers of LDLR promoter activity. In vivo, we demonstrate efficient liver-specific delivery and expression of luciferase following hydrodynamic tail-vein injection and confirm that expression from the LDLR promoter element is sensitive to statin administration. We also demonstrate long-term LDLR expression from the 10-kb promoter element up to 9 months following delivery. The vector system that we describe provides the efficient delivery, long-term expression, and physiological regulation required for a successful gene therapy intervention for FH.", 
    "61": "In Hungary the life expectancy have increased by 4.14 years between 1993 and 2006 and the improvement of cardiovascular mortality contributed to this with 1.85 years. Lipid lowering therapy and achievement of target lipid levels have become recently a crucial point of cardiovascular prevention. Despite the improving tendency the rate of achieving LDL-cholesterol goal is not higher than 1/3 and its main cause seems to be the fact that greater part of the physicians (56% of them in year 2007) - seeing the results with not convenient lipid levels - yield to it, do not modify the current treatment. However, there is growing evidence that the lower LDL-cholesterol level improves not only the clinical outcome but it is cost-effective as well. The most important trial performed recently using statin was the JUPITER study, in which patients with normal lipid levels and high hs-CRP level without known atherosclerotic disease were treated with 20 mg rosuvastatin or placebo. The primary endpoint (cardiovascular mortality, stroke, non fatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina and revascularization) decreased significantly by 44% and total mortality decreased by 20%. For the prevention of one primary event 23 patients for 5 years were necessary to be treated. The results raise the need for reconsidering principles and target levels of the primary prevention and warn that in the lipid lowering therapy a greater emphasis should be placed on the hs-CRP level.",

For those subjects with longitudinal assessment of HCV viremia prior to and while on statins, there were no significant differences between pre- and post-HCV viral titers. Additionally, no differences in HCV titers were observed at any dose level of the most prescribed statin, simvastatin.

Since their introduction in the 1980s, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have emerged as the one of the best-selling class of medications to date, with numerous trials demonstrating powerful efficacy in preventing cardiovascular diseases. Although statins have been shown to modestly raise or not alter HDL-cholesterol, their effect on HDL subfractions and on HDL-associated enzymes including human paraoxonase-1 (PON1) has not yet been fully explored.

Current standards of care reduce but do not eliminate the risk of diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy or neuropathy in these patients. Correction of atherogenic dyslipidemia, which is characterized by elevated triglyceride levels and low levels of HDL cholesterol, might provide additional benefit. Whereas promising data have been published with respect to fibrate therapy for maculopathy, fenofibrate for diabetic retinopathy, and statin or fibrate therapy for diabetic nephropathy, further studies are warranted to define optimal management strategies for reducing the residual microvascular risk. Such strategies are especially relevant in cases of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, where even optimal care fails to affect disease progression. Identification of those factors that are most relevant to residual diabetes-related microvascular risk is a priority of an ongoing multinational epidemiological study. In this Review, we highlight an urgent need to address the issue of microvascular residual risk in patients with or at risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus.", 
    "68": "When the 'lipid nephrotoxicity hypothesis' was proposed in 1982, it brought together several disparate experimental findings in hyperlipidemia and renal disease to suggest that concomitant hyperlipidemia and proteinuria would cause self-perpetuating renal disease once the initial glomerular insult was no longer present. This process would be analogous to atherosclerosis. Since 1982, increasing evidence has supported the hypothesis that lipid abnormalities contribute to both atherosclerosis and glomerulosclerosis. In this Review, we discuss research developments that are relevant to the lipid nephrotoxicity hypothesis. We describe how inflammatory stress accompanying chronic kidney disease modifies lipid homeostasis by increasing cholesterol uptake mediated by lipoprotein receptors, inhibiting cholesterol efflux mediated by the ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 and impairing cholesterol synthesis in peripheral cells. As a result of these events, cholesterol relocates to and accumulates in renal, vascular, hepatic and possibly other tissues. The combination of increased cellular cholesterol influx and reduced efflux causes injury in some tissues and lowers the plasma cholesterol level. In addition, inflammatory stress causes a degree of statin resistance via unknown mechanisms. These phenomena alter traditional understanding of the pathogenesis of lipid-mediated renal and vascular injury and could influence the clinical evaluation of renal and cardiovascular risk and the role of lipid-lowering treatment in affected patients.",

The reported effects of statins on the serum level of adiponectin include significant increases in the adiponectin levels caused by pravastatin (CAS 81131-70-6). In this study, increasing the dosage of pravastatin was investigated to determine whether it had a clearly favorable effect on the adiponectin level in hypercholesterolemic patients. A total of 26 mild hypercholesterolemic and hypertensive patients were enrolled in this study. The patients were initially treated with pravastatin 10 mg/day for 6 months or more, and then increased to pravastatin 20 mg/day. Serum adiponectin, cholesterol fractionated components, and lipoprotein components were evaluated after 6 months. Increasing the dose of pravastatin from 10 to 20 mg/day caused the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels to decrease (from 130 to 104 mg/dL, p < 0.001), and thereafter the serum adiponectin levels, particularly the high-molecular-weight adiponectin levels significantly increased (from 10.9 to 12.6 microg/mL, p = 0.022; from 6.6 to 7.6 microg/mL, p = 0.022, respectively). Pravastatin increased the serum adiponectin level after increasing the dosage from 10 to 20 mg/day. It remains possible, however, that the difference was due not only to pharmacologic effects, but also to other specific characteristics such as the subject characteristics, viz.; race, body size, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, etc.",

So far, controversial and insufficient data are available concerning transporters involved in the elimination process. This study was designed to elucidate, which transporters take part in the biliary clearance of rosuvastatin using sandwich-cultured primary rat hepatocytes. The canalicular efflux of rosuvastatin was measured in the presence of inhibitors: Ko 134, mitoxanthrone, novobiocin for breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp); verapamil for multidrug resistance protein (Mdr1); benzbromarone, sulfasalazine, probenecid for multidrug resistance associated protein (Mrp 2); and cyclosporine A, glibenclamide, troglitazone for bile salt export pump (Bsep). Mrp2 inhibitors decreased the biliary efflux of rosuvastatin most potently by 78.9%, 35%, 54.1%; benzbromarone, probenecid, sulfasalazine, respectively, while Bcrp and Bsep inhibitors showed much less effect (29.1%, 23.0% ,30.0%; Ko 134, mitoxanthrone, novobiocin, respectively, and 32.6%, 29.3%, 20.6%, glibenclamide, cyclosporine A, troglitazone, respectively).

Whereas dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD), its role in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke is less clear. Epidemiological studies have provided conflicting findings regarding the association of dyslipidemia with ischemic stroke. Overall, elevated LDL-C levels appear to increase the risk of ischemic stroke. Low HDL-C levels also appear to be associated with a greater risk whereas the importance of high triglyceride levels is less clear. The discordant results of observational studies might result from the heterogeneity of stroke, since dyslipidemia is less likely to play a major role in the pathogenesis of some ischemic stroke subtypes (e.g. lacunar and cardioembolic strokes) and elevated LDL-C levels might increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. In clinical trials, statins consistently reduced the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with or without CHD whereas the data on the effects of other lipid modifying drugs on stroke risk are limited. In patients with a previous stroke, statins reduce the risk of both ischemic stroke and other vascular events but also increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Accordingly, current guidelines recommend the same lipid targets for the primary and secondary prevention of both stroke and CHD. In addition, stroke and transient ischemic attacks of carotid origin are considered CHD risk equivalents. Nevertheless, more trials are required to identify which patients with stroke but without CHD will benefit more from statin treatment.",

The level of GATA-6 mRNA and protein were markedly decreased in these pneumonectomy and MCT-treated rats, and they were significantly up-regulated in these rats after receiving simvastatin.

    "154": "GM caused a marked reduction in renal functions and increased oxidative stress parameters. Histopathological examination revealed tubular necrosis especially in the renal cortex in GM rats. On immunohistochemical evaluation, GM rat showed more intense expressions of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) compared with control. Kidney function tests and tissue oxidative stress parameters were normalized in the GM + ATO group. Histopathological and immunohistochemical pictures were also greatly ameliorated.",

    "156": "Statins may confer renal protection in a variety of glomerular diseases, including diabetic nephropathy (DN). However, various glomerular lesions have different etiologies and may have different responses to statins. This study was performed to determine the differential effects of simvastatin (SMV) on glomerular pathology including mesangial expansion and podocyte injury in a mouse model of early stage type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Type 2 DM was induced in male C57BL/6 mice by feeding a high fat diet (HF; 45 kcal% fat). After 22 weeks, one group of HF mice was treated with SMV (HF-SMV; 7 mug/day/g BW) and another group was treated with vehicle (HF-vehicle) for 4 weeks via osmotic mini-pump. A third group served as age-matched normal diet vehicle controls (ND-vehicle; 10 kcal% fat). At the end of treatment, glomerular morphology was evaluated in a blind manner to determine the progression of DN. Body weight, blood glucose, insulin, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides, but not LDL-cholesterol, were increased in HF mice. Over the course of treatment, the 24-hour urinary albumin excretion (UAE) was unchanged in ND-vehicle. HF mice exhibited elevated UAE, which decreased with SMV, but was unchanged with vehicle. The absolute mesangial volume and the relative mesangial volume per glomerular volume increased in HF-vehicle and remained elevated with SMV treatment. The immuno-staining of nephrin, a protein marker of the integrity of podocyte slit diaphragms, was decreased in HF-vehicle; however, the nephrin quantity of the HF-SMV group was not different from ND-vehicle. It is concluded that SMV reverses podocyte damage, but does not affect mesangial expansion in the kidneys of early stage proteinuria of type 2 DM.",

Treatment of MIDs is based on five main columns, including symptomatic measures, application of supportive agents, dietary measures, physiotherapy, and the avoidance of drugs known to be toxic for mitochondrial functions. This review aims to give an overview about those agents that interfere with mitochondrial functions.",

These agents should be avoided or given only under close monitoring, although some of them also exhibit beneficial effects, possibly due to the peculiarities of mitochondrial genetics. Typical side effects may be steroid myopathy, propofol syndrome, statin/fibrate myopathy, neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal signs, or zidovudine myopathy.",

Vascular calcification inhibitors, known osteopontin (OPN) and osteoprotegerin (OPG), have emerged as novel cardiovascular biomarkers. This open-label, prospective study aimed to examine whether aggressive lipid-lowering therapy with atorvastatin is more effective than moderate lipid-lowering in increasing carotid plaque echogenicity, assessed by Gray-Scale Median (GSM) score and suppressing serum OPN and OPG levels in patients with moderate carotid stenosis.", 
    "177": "One hundred forty patients (64 males, 76 females), aged 50 to 75 years, with carotid stenosis (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial [NASCET]: 30%-60% for symptomatic and 30%-70% for asymptomatic), but without indications for surgical intervention, were enrolled. Patients with coronary heart disease, renal failure, hypothyroidism, osteoporosis, and ongoing use of statins were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned to: Group A (N = 70): Moderate lipid-lowering therapy with low-dose of atorvastatin (10 mg-20 mg) to target LDL-C <100 mg/dL. Group B (N = 70): Aggressive lipid-lowering therapy with high-dose of atorvastatin (80 mg) to target LDL-C <70 mg/dL. Blood pressure, lipid and glycemic indexes, hsCRP, serum OPN, and OPG were measured at baseline and after 12 months as well as the GSM score. Independent samples t test, paired samples t test, Pearson correlation, and multiple regression analysis were used (P < .05).", 
    "178": "There were no significant differences between groups at baseline. Three patients in group A experienced either cerebrovascular or cardiac ischemic attacks, while two patients in group B underwent coronary angioplasty during follow-up. Group B showed a more pronounced improvement in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol compared with group A (P < .05). Moreover, atorvastatin treatment suppressed serum hsCRP, OPN, and OPG levels from baseline in both groups (P < .001). Notably, aggressive treatment decreased OPN (P = .012) and OPG (P = .025) levels to a greater degree compared with moderate treatment. Similarly, GSM score was remarkably increased in both groups, but that augmentation was greater in group B (from 66.39 +/- 23.66 to 100.4 +/- 25.31) than in group A (from 64.4 +/- 23.62 to 85.39 +/- 20.21) (P = .024). No change in the degree of carotid stenosis was noted in both treatment arms. Importantly, the aforementioned reduction in OPN (r = -0.517, P = .024) and OPG (r = -0.312, P = .008) levels was inversely associated with GSM score changes in univariate and standard multiple regression analysis (R(2) = 0.411, P = .021).", 
    "179": "Among patients with moderate carotid stenosis, an aggressive atorvastatin regimen enhanced carotid plaque echogenicity and reduced serum OPN and OPG levels to a greater extent than respective moderate atorvastatin therapy. Most importantly, those atorvastatin-induced effects were associated with OPN and OPG suppression in a dose-dependent manner.", 
    "180": "A simple and sensitive methodology based on liquid-liquid-liquid microextraction (LLLME) followed by high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) has been successfully developed for the determination of atorvastatin (AT) in human plasma. AT was first extracted from 4.5 mL acidic aqueous sample (diluted plasma, donor phase, pH 1) at temperature 45 degrees C through 400 microL 1-octanol for 4.5 min, while being agitated by a stirring bar at 1250 rpm. Then, a 5.5 microL free suspended basic aqueous droplet (acceptor phase, pH 10) was delivered to the top-center position of the organic membrane. The mixture was stirred at 650 rpm for 7.5 min and the analyte was back-extracted into the droplet. Finally, the acceptor phase was taken into a microsyringe and injected directly into the HPLC. An enrichment factor of 187 along with substantial sample clean up was obtained under the optimized conditions. The calibration curve showed linearity in the range of 1-500 ng mL(-1) with regression coefficient corresponding to 0.996. Limits of detection (S/N=3) and quantification (S/N=10) were 0.4 and 1 ng mL(-1), respectively. A reasonable relative recovery (91%) and satisfactory intra-assay (4.4-7.0%, n=6) and inter-assay (4.9-7.7%, n=8) precision illustrated good performance of the analytical procedure. This technique was eventually applied for the determination of AT in human plasma after oral administration of 40 mg single dose of drug. The protocol proved to be highly cost-effective and reliable for the screening purpose.", 
    "181": "Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are a subtype of hematopoietic stem cells, which contribute to the repair of injured endothelium. Treatment with atorvastatin has been shown to increase EPC count in patients with coronary artery disease. Therefore, we investigated whether atorvastatin augments the number of EPCs after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery. We conducted a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-way crossover trial in 50 patients undergoing elective coronary surgery. Patients received either 3-week treatment with atorvastatin or placebo. EPCs were quantitated by flow cytometric phenotyping on blood samples. Levels of interleukin, IL-6 and IL-8; tumor necrosis factor alpha; SDF-1alpha; granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; and vascular endothelial growth factor were determined at recruitment, preoperatively, post-CPB, and 6, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively. The atorvastatin group showed a significantly higher amount of EPCs both pre- and postoperatively compared with the placebo, with a >4-fold increase compared with the baseline values. CPB induced an increase in all cytokines, but the levels of proinflammatory cytokines were significantly lower in the atorvastatin group (P < 0.05). Statin did not affect levels of SDF-1alpha, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor. However, no correlation was found between plasma levels of any cytokine and number of EPCs, with the exception of SDF-1alpha. Pretreatment with atorvastatin significantly increases the amount of EPCs after CPB, by a mechanism independent of plasma levels of cytokines and cholesterol.", 
    "182": "This study investigated the role of a multispecific organic anion transporter, Oatp1a4/Slco1a4, in drug transport across the blood-brain barrier. In vitro transport studies using human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing mouse Oatp1a4 identified the following compounds as Oatp1a4 substrates: pitavastatin (K(m) = 8.3 microM), rosuvastatin (K(m) = 12 microM), pravastatin, taurocholate (K(m) = 40 microM), digoxin, ochratoxin A, and [d-penicillamine(2,5)]-enkephalin. Double immunohistochemical staining of Oatp1a4 with P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or glial fibrillary acidic protein demonstrated that Oatp1a4 signals colocalized with P-gp signals partly but not with glial fibrillary acidic protein, suggesting that Oatp1a4 is expressed in both the luminal and the abluminal membranes of mouse brain capillary endothelial cells. The brain-to-blood transport of pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, and taurocholate after microinjection into the cerebral cortex was significantly decreased in Oatp1a4(-/-) mice compared with that in wild-type mice. The blood-to-brain transport of pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, taurocholate, and ochratoxin A, determined by in situ brain perfusion, was significantly lower in Oatp1a4(-/-) mice than in wild-type mice, whereas transport of pravastatin and [D-penicillamine(2,5)]-enkephalin was unchanged. The blood-to-brain transport of digoxin was significantly lower in Oatp1a4(-/-) mice than in wild-type mice only when P-gp was inhibited by N-(4-[2-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6,7-dimethoxy-2-isoquinolinyl)ethyl]-phenyl)-9,10-dihydro-5-methoxy-9-oxo-4-acridine carboxamide (GF120918). Taken together, these results show that Oatp1a4 can mediate the brain-to-blood and blood-to-brain transport of its substrate drugs across the blood-brain barrier. The brain-to-plasma ratio of taurocholate, pitavastatin, and rosuvastatin was close to the capillary volume in wild-type mice, and it was not affected by Oatp1a4 dysfunction. Whether Oatp1a4 can deliver drugs from the blood to the brain remains controversial.",

(18)F-4V uptake colocalized with atherosclerotic plaques on Oil Red O staining and correlated to mRNA levels of VCAM-1 measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (R = 0.79, p = 0.03). Atherosclerotic mice receiving an atorvastatin-enriched diet had significantly lower lesional uptake (p < 0.05). Furthermore, (18)F-4V imaging in myocardial ischemia after coronary ligation and in transplanted cardiac allografts undergoing rejection showed high in vivo PET signal in inflamed myocardium and good correlation with ex vivo measurement of VCAM-1 mRNA by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.",

We defined a composite adverse event (CAE) as discontinuation for any side effect, myalgia, or CK >3x upper limit of normal during follow-up. We sequenced CYP2D6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and SLCO1B1 and tested 7 reduced function alleles for association with the CAE.", 
    "191": "The CAE occurred in 99 subjects (54 discontinuations, 49 myalgias, and 9 CK elevations). Sex was associated with CAE (percent female in CAE vs. no CAE groups, 66% vs. 50%, p < 0.01). SLCO1B1*5 was associated with CAE (percent with > or = 1 allele in CAE vs. no CAE groups, 37% vs. 25%, p = 0.03) and those with CAE with no significant CK elevation (p < or = 0.03). Furthermore, there was evidence for a gene-dose effect (percent with CAE in those with 0, 1, or 2 alleles: 19%, 27%, and 50%, trend p = 0.01). Finally, the CAE risk appeared to be greatest in those carriers assigned to simvastatin.",

    "193": "We report the intercalation and characterization of pravastatin and fluvastatin drugs in Mg(II)/Al(III) layered double hydroxides (LDHs) to form novel nanohybrid hydroxides through the coprecipitation technique. powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and thermal analysis techniques reveal that the drugs are accommodated within the brucite layers. Structural characterization, computed results, and atomic force microscopy image analysis demonstrate that the fluvastatin anions are attached with the brucite as a monolayer, whereas the pravastatin anions form a multilayer. The shift in the stretching frequency of carboxylate anion of statin drugs provides evidence that the drugs are electrostatically bonded to LDHs. X-ray diffraction and thermal analysis studies performed after keeping the nanohybrid particles at 75 +/- 10% relative humidity atmosphere, indicate their physical stability due to proper confinement of drugs within the layers. In-vitro release study of developed nanohybrid particles suggests that the significant reduction in release rate of fluvastatin anions from fluvastatin intercalated LDHs is due to its hydrophobic nature and it can be further controlled by varying the concentration in physiological medium. After release, the data were fitted to the dissolution-diffusion kinetic model. The mechanism of drugs diffusion in hydrophobic nanohybrid is probably due to heterogeneous diffusion via anion exchange, while in a hydrophilic nanohybrid, it is due to intraparticle diffusion via anion exchange with the anions in the physiological medium."
