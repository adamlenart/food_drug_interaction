In the Angioplasty Compared with MEdical therapy (ACME) and Randomized Intervention Treatment of Angina 2 (RITA-2) studies, a medical strategy was associated with significantly fewer adverse cardiovascular events, but percutaneous revascularization was associated with greater functional improvement. In the Atorvastatin VErsus Revascularization Treatment (AVERT) study, aggressive lipid-lowering therapy with atorvastatin was more effective than angioplasty at reducing the total number of ischemic events; however, angioplasty was superior in terms of functional improvements. Thus, to prevent ischemic events in this population, coronary artery disease is best treated systemically; if better symptom control is required, angioplasty is still necessary. In the effects of QUinapril On Vascular ACE and Determinants of ISchemia (QUO VADIS) study, treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor quinapril was associated with significantly fewer ischemic events than placebo at one year following coronary artery bypass graft surgery. However, no significant differences were found between treatments in terms of primary and other secondary outcomes. For patients who have undergone bypass surgery, long term ACE inhibitor therapy may be of benefit, although further studies are warranted.",

    "9": "Although the mechanism by which dietary cholesterol is absorbed from the intestine is poorly understood, it is generally accepted that cholesterol is absorbed from bile acid micelles in the jejunum. Once inside the enterocytes, cholesterol is esterified by the action of acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), assembled into chylomicrons, and secreted into the lymph. In this work, mechanistic aspects of cholesterol absorption were probed using compounds that block cholesterol absorption in hamsters. Sterol glycoside cholesterol absorption inhibitors, exemplified by L-166,143, (3 beta, 5 alpha,25R)-3-[(4\", 6\"-bis[2-fluoro-phenylcarbamoyl]-B-D-cellobiosyl)oxy]-spirostan -11-on e, potently blocked absorption of radioactive cholesterol, and the potencies of several analogs correlated with their ability to lower plasma cholesterol. Each molecule of L-166,143 blocked the uptake of 500 molecules of cholesterol, rendering it unlikely that the inhibitor interacts directly with the cholesterol or bile acid. Radiolabeled L-166,143 bound to the mucosa and binding was blocked by active, but not inactive, cholesterol absorption inhibitors. Subtle changes in the structure of sterol glycosides yielded large changes in their ability to block both cholesterol absorption and binding of radiolabeled L-166,143. Large species-to-species variation in potency was also observed. These lines of evidence support the interpretation that dietary cholesterol is absorbed via a specific transporter found in the intestinal mucosa.",

Patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia were randomized, after 10 weeks' dietary stabilization on an American Heart Association (AHA) Step I diet, to treatment with cerivastatin 0.8 mg (n = 776), cerivastatin 0.4 mg (n = 195) or placebo (n = 199) once daily for 8 weeks. Cerivastatin 0.8 mg reduced mean low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) by 41.8% compared with cerivastatin 0.4 mg (-35.6%, P < 0.0001) or placebo. In 90% of patients receiving cerivastatin 0.8 mg LDL-C was reduced by 23.9 -58.4% (6th - 95th percentile). Overall attainment of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) goal was achieved by 84% of patients receiving cerivastatin 0.8 mg and by 59% of those with coronary heart disease (CHD). In the sub-population meeting the NCEP criteria for pharmacological therapy for LDL-C reduction, 74.6% of patients, including the 59% with CHD, reached the goal with cerivastatin 0.8 mg. Cerivastatin 0.8 mg also reduced mean total cholesterol by 29.9%, apolipoprotein B by 33.2% and median triglycerides by 22.9% (all P < 0.0001). Mean high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein A1 were elevated 8.7% (P < 0.0001) and 4.5% (P < 0.0001), respectively, by cerivastatin 0.8 mg. Reductions of triglyceride and elevation in HDL-C were dependent upon triglyceride baseline levels; in patients having baseline triglyceride levels 250 - 400 mg/dl, cerivastatin 0.8 mg reduced median triglycerides by 29.5% and elevated HDL-C by 13.2%. Cerivastatin 0.8 mg was well tolerated. The most commonly reported adverse events included headache, pharyngitis and rhinitis (4 - 6%). Symptomatic creatine kinase elevations > 10 times upper limit of normal occurred in 0%, 1% and 0.9% of patients receiving placebo, cerivastatin 0.4 mg or cerivastatin 0.8 mg, respectively.

    "15": "Elevated levels of serum lipids and lipoproteins are known to play a major role in the development of atherosclerosis and subsequent coronary heart disease (CHD). In controlled clinical studies, atorvastatin (Sortis), a new 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA)-reductase inhibitor, proved to be a very effective and safe lipid-lowering agent. The aim of this open-label, multicentre study (without a control group) was to confirm the efficacy and safety of atorvastatin in a private practice group, including 181 Swiss cardiologists, internists, and general practitioners. A total of 877 hyperlipidaemic patients requiring treatment participated in this study. To evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment with atorvastatin over a period of 12 weeks, total plasma cholesterol (TC), HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides (TG) were determined every 4 weeks. The initial atorvastatin dose was 10 mg in 78% of patients and 20 mg in 22%. The dose was doubled every 4 weeks until the target values of TC < or = 5.2 mmol/l and TC/HDL < or = 5 were reached. After 12 weeks of treatment with atorvastatin the mean reduction in TC, TC/HDL, LDL and TG compared to baseline levels was 33, 37, 42, and 25% respectively. At the same time the HDL concentration was increased by 9%. These results were evidenced in patients with existing coronary heart disease, in high risk patients without manifest coronary heart disease and in patients with significantly elevated lipid levels (TC > 7.8 mmol/l, TC/HDL > 6.5). After treatment with atorvastatin for 12 weeks, 59% of patients had reached the therapeutic target of TC < or = 5.2 mmol/l. The target of TC/HDL < or = 5 was reached by 79%. Atorvastatin was almost without exception well tolerated, the most frequently reported side effects being nausea, myalgia, and headache. In this open-label multicentre study atorvastatin was found to be effective and well tolerated. The observed reduction in the lipid and lipoprotein concentration is in accordance with the results of published controlled studies. The lipid and lipoprotein concentrations were decreased significantly in patients with slight to moderate elevation of lipid levels as well as in those with significantly raised values.", 
    "16": "Although the levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol remain the main therapeutic goal when treating dyslipidaemias, there is a need to consider high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations. This conclusion is based on the findings of epidemiological surveys and appropriately designed trials using statins or fibrates. The importance of HDL, as a 'protective' lipoprotein fraction, has been recognised by major treatment guidelines. This review considers the differences in HDL-raising capacity of two of the most commonly prescribed statins--atorvastatin and simvastatin. When compared with simvastatin, atorvastatin is associated with progressively decreasing rises in the levels of HDL as the dose increases (negative dose response), an effect not reported with other statins. In contrast, simvastatin shows a positive dose response (increasing concentrations of HDL with increasing dose). This effect is paralleled by changes in apolipoprotein A-I levels. Apolipoprotein A-I is the main apolipoprotein associated with HDL. This dissimilarity in HDL response is an example of several differences that have been reported when comparing various statins. If 'all statins are not created equal', we should focus prescribing on those statins that have end point evidence originating from appropriately designed trials.",

Exploratory analysis in this study suggested a gender difference in the 0.4 mg group: mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) decreased by 44.4 +/- 8.9% in women, compared with a mean decrease of 37.0 +/- 0.9% in men (p < 0.046). This paper reports the results of further sub-analyses from this study. Overall in the per-protocol (PP) population, 71.5% (n = 73) of women taking cerivastatin 0.4 mg had an LDL-C decrease of > 40%, compared with 38.0% (n = 76) of men taking the same dose. In the cerivastatin 0.2 mg PP population, 34% (n = 17) of women had an LDL-C decrease of > 40%, compared with 19% (n = 18) of men. Mean LDL-C/HDL-C ratio decreased by 43% from baseline to the end of the study in the cerivastatin 0.4 mg PP group: -41.3% in males vs. -48.3% in females. In the cerivastatin 0.2 mg group, the decrease in LDL-C/HDL-C ratio from baseline to endpoint did not markedly differ between genders: -37.0% for males vs. -37.3% for females. Categorial analysis of the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio found that 90% of PP patients taking cerivastatin 0.4 mg, and 84% of PP patients taking cerivastatin 0.2 mg, had a low CHD risk (defined as a LDL-C/HDL-C ratio < or = 3) after 8 weeks of treatment. The 6th and 95th percentiles of the distribution of LDL-C reduction from baseline revealed that 90% of PP patients taking cerivastatin 0.4 mg had an LDL-C reduction of between 22% and 56%. The mean LDL-C reduction for this 90% subset of patients was 40.1%. The same analysis for PP patients taking cerivastatin 0.2 mg found that 90% had an LDL-C reduction of between 13% and 49%. The mean LDL-C reduction in this 90% subset of patients was 31.5%. Of the patients taking cerivastatin 0.4 mg and valid for treatment according to National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) criteria, 71% (149/211) achieved NCEP targets for LDL-C at Week 16.", 
    "18": "Comparison of the inferred amino acid sequence of orf AF1736 of Archaeoglobus fulgidus to that of Pseudomonas mevalonii HMG-CoA reductase suggested that AF1736 might encode a Class II HMG-CoA reductase. Following polymerase chain reaction-based cloning of AF1736 from A. fulgidus genomic DNA and expression in Escherichia coli, the encoded enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity and its enzymic properties were determined. Activity was optimal at 85 degrees C, deltaHa was 54 kJ/mol, and the statin drug mevinolin inhibited competitively with HMG-CoA (Ki 180 microM). Protonated forms of His390 and Lys277, the apparent cognates of the active site histidine and lysine of the P. mevalonii enzyme, appear essential for activity. The mechanism proposed for catalysis of P. mevalonii HMG-CoA reductase thus appears valid for A. fulgidus HMG-CoA reductase. Unlike any other HMG-CoA reductase, the A. fulgidus enzyme exhibits dual coenzyme specificity. pH-activity profiles for all four reactions revealed that optimal activity using NADP(H) occurred at a pH from 1 to 3 units more acidic than that observed using NAD(H). Kinetic parameters were therefore determined for all substrates for all four catalyzed reactions using either NAD(H) or NADP(H). NADPH and NADH compete for occupancy of a common site. k(cat)[NAD(H)]/k(cat)[NADP(H)] varied from unity to under 70 for the four reactions, indicative of slight preference for NAD(H). The results indicate the importance of the protonated status of active site residues His390 and Lys277, shown by altered K(M) and k(cat) values, and indicate that NAD(H) and NADP(H) have comparable affinity for the same site.", 
    "19": "Lovastatin is a lipid lowering agent that acts by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, a key regulatory enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. In this study the pattern of gene network regulation induced in hepatic proteins as a response to lovastatin treatment was analyzed by proteomics. In livers of male F344 rats treated with 1.6 mg/kg/day lovastatin or 150 mg/kg/day lovastatin for seven days, 36 proteins were found to be significantly altered (p<0.001) in relation to treatment. The changed proteins were classified according to their cellular function and participation in biochemical pathways. The following observations were made: (i) inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase provoked a regulatory response in the cholesterol synthesis pathway including the induction of cytosolic HMG-CoA synthase and of isopentenyl-diphosphate delta-isomerase, (ii) manipulation of the lipid metabolism triggered alterations in key enzymes of the carbohydrate metabolism, and (iii) lovastatin treatment was associated with signs of toxicity as reflected by changes in a heterogeneous set of cellular stress proteins involved in functions such as cytoskeletal structure, calcium homeostasis, protease inhibition, cell signaling or apoptosis. These results present new insights into liver gene network regulations induced by lovastatin and illustrate a yet unexplored application of proteomics to discover new targets by analysis of existing drugs and the pathways that they regulate.",

Thus, no relevant influence of food could be detected, although the presence of food increased the Cmax of cerivastatin on average by 12% (90% confidence interval: 1.04 - 1.21) under morning, but not evening dosing. With respect to the effect of daytime on cerivastatin pharmacokinetics, AUCs were bioequivalent for all treatment conditions, with Cmax values slightly lower (8 - 19%) following evening dosing, irrespective of food intake. Cerivastatin was well tolerated by the subjects in the study.",

    "24": "A review of the cost-effectiveness literature indicated that the hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A-reductase inhibitor fluvastatin is more cost-effective for achieving minor-to-moderate reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels than 3 other statins: lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin. The main goal of this study was to verify the applicability of these conclusions to Spanish health care costs and patterns of resource consumption related to the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. A stochastic simulation model was used to predict both the costs and effects of treating high-risk hypercholesterolemic patients with fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, or simvastatin. Epidemiologic data were used to find a suitable theoretic probability distribution model for baseline LDL-C values in high-risk hypercholesterolemic patients. The model was then used to generate 10,000 random observations of baseline LDL-C values; the corresponding LDL-C values after a 2-year treatment period were predicted as a function of the baseline value and the percentage reduction expected with a particular statin and dose, according to the results obtained in 2 meta-analyses. The probability of treatment discontinuation was also taken into account using estimates obtained in usual practice. The effects of treatment were expressed as the rate of success in achieving the goal level of LDL-C, as defined in the current Spanish recommendations for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. The average costs of treatment were computed from both the social and public-financing perspectives, including the cost of lipid-lowering drugs, physician visits, laboratory tests, and days off work, as appropriate. The occurrence of nonscheduled visits and workdays lost because of side effects were taken into account to compute indirect costs relevant to the social perspective. The potential costs of treating side effects were ignored. A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to compare the cost-effectiveness ratios obtained with each of the 4 statins considered in this study. Model-based predictions of the effects, total costs, and cost-effectiveness ratios were made. Cost-effectiveness ratios were interpreted as the cost per patient meeting the goal of therapy, according to current Spanish recommendations. The data showed that fluvastatin had the lowest cost-effectiveness ratios when LDL-C levels required reduction to < or =25% of baseline levels. In this situation, fluvastatin was more cost-effective than lovastatin, pravastatin, or simvastatin from public-financing and social perspectives.", 
    "25": "Atorvastatin is an established HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor which effectively reduces the plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol level in hyperlipidemic patients. The present study was designed to investigate whether atorvastatin treatment can modify the biochemical content of oxidized LDL in hyperlipidemic patients and the ability of oxidized LDL to impair the endothelium-dependent relaxation of blood vessels. With atorvastatin (10 mg/day) treatment for 4 weeks in 19 type IIa hyperlipidemic patients, total cholesterol level was lowered by 23%, LDL-cholesterol was lowered by 32% and triacylglycerol was lowered by 19% as compared with dietary therapy alone. High density lipoprotein levels increased by approximately 9%. The ability of oxidized LDL from hyperlipidemic patients after atorvastatin treatment to impair the endothelium-dependent relaxation was significantly reduced as compared with dietary intervention alone. Analysis of the biochemical contents of oxidized LDL from this group revealed that there was an 11% reduction in lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) as compared with the group that received only dietary counseling. A decrease in the C16:0 moiety with a corresponding increase in the C18:0 moiety of LPC in the oxidized LDL was also observed in the atorvastatin treated group. We propose that the observed reduction and the change in composition of acyl groups in LPC in the oxidized LDL of the atorvastatin-treated group results from a combination of the continued dietary treatment as well as drug therapy. In view of an observation that both C16:0 and C18:0 LPC species are equally potent in the impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation of the aortic rings, we feel that the reduced level of LPC in the oxidized LDL produced by atorvastatin treatment is partially responsible for the improvement in endothelium control of vascular tone.", 
    "26": "The insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) has been shown to be of critical importance for tumor development and tumor cell survival of various types of malignancies. We have previously demonstrated that an adequate N-linked glycosylation of IGF-1R is required for its translocation to the cell surface in melanoma cells. This raises the possibility of using glycosylation inhibitors as therapeutic agents against IGF-1R-dependent malignancies. In this study we show that inhibition of N-linked glycosylation using tunicamycin or the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor lovastatin resulted in down-regulation of IGF-1R at the cell surface in Ewing's sarcoma cell lines (RD-ES and ES-1 cells). The down-regulation of plasma membrane-bound IGF-1R was correlated with a drastic decrease in IGF-1R autophosphorylation, suggesting biochemical inactivation of the receptor. Whereas RD-ES and ES-1 cells responded differently with regard to DNA synthesis, the decrease in IGF-1R expression was accompanied by a rapid and substantial decrease in survival of both cell lines. Our data suggest that relatively untoxic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (e.g. lovastatin) could have therapeutic significance in IGF-1R-dependent neoplasms like Ewing's sarcoma.", 
    "27": "Squalene synthase (SQS; EC 2.5.1.21) plays an important role in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. We discovered ER-28448, 5-(N-[2-butenyl-3-(2-methoxyphenyl)]-N-methylamino)-1, 1-penthylidenebis(phosphonic acid) trisodium salt, as a potent and selective inhibitor of SQS. ER-28448 inhibited SQS in rat liver microsome with an IC(50) value of 3.6 nm. We also prepared ER-27856, the tripivaloyloxymethyl ester prodrug of ER-28448. Although less active than ER-28448 in a liver microsome assay, ER-27856 more potently inhibited cholesterol biosynthesis in rat hepatocytes; and ER-27856 orally inhibited de novo cholesterol biosynthesis in Sprague-Dawley rats, with an ED(50) value of 1.6 mg/kg. In HepG2 cells, ER-27856 upregulated low density lipoprotein receptor activity to 2.1 times that of control. A time-course study indicated that the inhibitory effect of ER-27856 on cholesterol biosynthesis in rats continued for up to 8 h. In a study of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (HMGRIs), atorvastatin actively suppressed cholesterol biosynthesis for 8 h, whereas the effect of pravastatin and simvastatin diminished at 4 and 8 h, respectively. In rhesus monkeys, 4 days of oral administration of ER-27856 lowered plasma total cholesterol (TCHO) more potently than did these HMGRIs. Whereas atorvastatin significantly elevated plasma alanine aminotransferase, a marker of hepatotoxicity, to 3.7 times at 100 mg/kg, ER-27856 increased the level only 1.4 times at 10 mg/kg, at which doses the hypocholesterolemic effect was equivalent. During 28 days of administration, ER-27856 reduced TCHO and non-high density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol by 72 and 95%, respectively. These results demonstrate that ER-27856 had more potent hypocholesterolemic activity and less hepatotoxic effect than HMGRIs. ER-27856 may contribute to the treatment of hypercholesterolemic patients.",

In the patient without established heart disease however, conventional risk assessment is imprecise and determining which patients are at highest versus lowest risk is a common clinical conundrum. It is well established that the most powerful determinant to risk is the overall extent/severity of coronary disease. Electron beam tomography (EBT) and quantification of coronary artery calcium has been shown to provide a valid non-invasive surrogate to atherosclerotic plaque burden. Screening patients who are considered to be at traditional intermediate to high risk by first using EBT can refine the broad-based population risk to a more individual basis.

At each clinic visit, the following parameters were measured: weight, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), HDL, LDL, apo A-1, apo B, glucose and uric acid. These biochemical parameters were measured by routine automated analyzer techniques. The pre-Ramadan values comprised the means of two measurements taken at about 3 month and 1 month before commencement of Ramadan. Post-Ramadan values were obtained within 1 month of the end of the Ramadan fast.

Weight did not change and the other lipid parameters-TC, TG, LDL, apo B-did not worsen. These observations, more consistent in the men than in the women, and in subjects treated with a fibrate or a statin rather than on diet alone, indicate a favorable coronary heart disease (CHD) risk profile. In the diabetic patients, these changes in the apo A-1 level and its ratio to HDL and apo B were also present, but TC and apo B levels increased, the latter significantly (P<0.05). These divergent effects in diabetic patients could variably influence CHD risk liability.

    "41": "When pre- and post-Ramadan lipid and lipoprotein profiles were compared in stable hyperlipidaemic subjects attending a Lipid Clinic in Kuwait, the most consistent changes post-Ramadan were increased levels of apo A-1 and apo A-1/apo B and apo A-1/HDL ratios and reduced uric acid levels. Body weight remained essentially unchanged and the other lipoprotein and lipid parameters were not worsened. These results suggest that Ramadan fasting in hyperlipidaemic subjects might favorably influence CHD risk.", 
    "42": "Simvastatin belongs to a class of lipid-lowering drugs which completely inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl co-enzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase. The commonest adverse effects of therapy with simvastatin HMG CoA reductase inhibitors are gastro-intestinal disturbance, myositis and myopathy. Rhabdomyolysis leading to renal failure has been reported, but it appears to be very rare, except in patients also receiving cyclosporin, nicotinic acid or gemfibrozil. Here we report the case of an elderly lady who was known to have chronic renal failure, but who developed rhabdomyolysis following simvastatin therapy. Her symptoms of muscle pain, fatigue, myoglobulinuria, oliguria and pulmonary oedema appeared 48 h after the first dose of simvastatin. Simvastatin was immediately stopped, and the patient was dialysed for 1 week. Her renal function improved and came back. We suggest that extreme care should be exercised in prescribing this drug, particularly for the elderly with renal impairment.", 
    "43": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors specifically inhibit HMG-CoA reductase in the liver, thereby inhibiting the biosynthesis of cholesterol. These drugs significantly reduce plasma cholesterol level and long term treatment reduces morbidity and mortality associated with coronary heart disease. The tolerability of these drugs during long term administration is an important issue. Adverse reactions involving skeletal muscle are not uncommon, and sometimes serious adverse reactions involving skeletal muscle such as myopathy and rhabdomyolysis may occur, requiring discontinuation of the drug. Occasionally, arthralgia, alone or in association with myalgia, has been reported. In this article we review scientific data provided via Medline, adverse drug reaction case reports from the Swedish Drug Information System (SWEDIS) and the World Health Organization's International Drug Information System (INTDIS) database, focusing on HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor-related musculoskeletal system events. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 is the main isoenzyme involved in the metabolic transformation of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Individuals with both low hepatic and low gastrointestinal tract levels of CYP3A4 expression may be at in increased risk of myotoxicity due to potentially higher HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor plasma concentrations. The reported incidence of myotoxic reactions in patients treated with this drug class varies from 1 to 7% and varies between different agents. The risk of these serious adverse reactions is dose-dependent and may increase when HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are prescribed concomitantly with drugs that inhibit their metabolism, such as itraconazole, cyclosporin, erythromycin and nefazodone. Electrolyte disturbances, infections, major trauma, hypoxia as well as drugs of abuse may increase the risk of myotoxicity. It is important that the potentially serious adverse reactions are recognised and correctly diagnosed so that the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor may at once be withdrawn to prevent further muscular damage.",

    "45": "Inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (statins) increase new bone formation in rodents and in human cells in vitro. Statin use is associated with increased bone mineral density of the femoral neck. We undertook a population-based case-control study at six health-maintenance organisations in the USA to investigate further the relation between statin use and fracture risk among older women.", 
    "46": "We investigated women aged 60 years or older. Exposure, outcome, and confounder information was obtained from automated claims and pharmacy data from October, 1994, to September, 1997. Cases had an incident diagnosis of non-pathological fracture of the hip, humerus, distal tibia, wrist, or vertebrae between October, 1996, and September, 1997. Controls had no fracture during this period. We excluded women with records of dispensing of drugs to treat osteoporosis.", 
    "47": "There were 928 cases and 2747 controls. Compared with women who had no record of statin dispensing during the previous 2 years, women with 13 or more statin dispensings during this period had a decreased risk of non-pathological fracture (odds ratio 0.48 [95% CI 0.27-0.83]) after adjustment for age, number of hospital admissions during the previous year, chronic disease score, and use of non-statin lipid-lowering drugs. No association was found between fracture risk and fewer than 13 dispensings of statins or between fracture risk and use of non-statin lipid-lowering drugs.",

    "49": "Cerebral blood flow is regulated by endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO), and endothelial NO synthase-deficient (eNOS-deficient; eNOS(-/-)) mice develop larger cerebral infarctions following middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. We report that disruption of Rho-mediated endothelial actin cytoskeleton leads to the upregulation of eNOS expression and reduces the severity of cerebral ischemia following MCA occlusion. Mice treated with the Rho inhibitor Clostridium botulinum C3 transferase (10 microgram/d) or the actin cytoskeleton disrupter cytochalasin D (1 mg/kg) showed a two- to fourfold increase in vascular eNOS expression and activity. This increase in eNOS expression was not due to increases in eNOS gene transcription, but to prolongation of eNOS mRNA half-life from 10 +/- 3 hours to 24 +/- 4 hours. Indeed, endothelial cells overexpressing a dominant-negative Rho mutant (N19RhoA) exhibited decreased actin stress fiber formation and increased eNOS expression. Inhibition of vascular Rho guanosine-5'-triphosphate binding activity by the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor simvastatin increased cerebral blood flow to ischemic regions of the brain, and mice treated with simvastatin, C3 transferase, or cytochalasin D showed smaller cerebral infarctions following MCA occlusion. No neuroprotection was observed with these agents in eNOS(-/-) mice. These findings suggest that therapies which target the endothelial actin cytoskeleton may have beneficial effects in ischemic stroke.", 
    "50": "Process control of bioprocess has been carried out by the judgment of the experts, who are the skilled operators and have lots of experiences for the control of the process. In almost all cases, those experiences are described linguistic IF-THEN rules. Fussy inference is one of the powerful tools to incorporate the linguistic rules to the computer for process control. Fuzzy control are divided into two types; one is the direct fuzzy control of process variables such as sugar feed rate in fed-batch culture and fermentation temperature in batch operation. The other is the indirect control of bioprocess, in which at first the phase recognition is carried out by fuzzy inference and the control strategies constructed in each phase are used for the control of process variables. In Japan, the fuzzy control has already been applied to practical industrial productions, such as pravastatin precursor, vitamin B2, and Japanese sake mashing process. In this review, these industrial approaches of fuzzy control are introduced.", 
    "51": "HepG2 cells stably transfected with cDNA-encoding single fibrinogen chains overexpress fibrinogen and have increased (4-fold) secretion of apolipoprotein B. Overexpression of fibrinogen does not affect the secretion of three representative acute-phase proteins but causes a small increase in albumin secretion. Enhanced apolipoprotein B secretion is due to less intracellular degradation and not to increased expression. The increased secretion of apolipoprotein B is independent of the acute-phase response, since stimulation of fibrinogen gene expression by interleukin 6 did not affect secretion. HepG2 cells overexpressing fibrinogen chains had increased 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase mRNA levels, enhanced cholesterol production but normal levels of triglyceride and phospholipid synthesis and of sterol response binding proteins. These results, that associate overexpression of fibrinogen with enhance apolipoprotein B secretion, may be significant since epidemiological studies indicate that elevated levels of fibrinogen and lipids are independent risk factors in coronary artery disease.", 
    "52": "We have developed a previously published paradigm concerning causation of coronary heart disease, based on the probability that the fundamental cause is a microbe, probably Chlamydia pneumoniae, and that the progress of the disease is influenced by number of accelerating and inhibiting factors. We propose that cigarette smoking acts via respiratory infection, this itself being influenced by immunocompetence resulting from sunlight exposure. We also propose an immuno-enhancing effect of oestrogen and an anti-inflammatory effect of statin therapy. In respect of the geographical variation of coronary heart disease, we emphasize that this must be viewed as part of the bigger picture of a high mortality from all causes in countries of North-west Europe that have a particularly low level of sunlight exposure. Finally, we draw attention to the Albanian, French, Italian, Northern Ireland and Scottish paradoxes which should lead to a major review of the conventional wisdom concerning the aetiogenesis of coronary heart disease.", 
    "53": "X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a progressive demyelinating disorder whose neurological signs and symptoms can manifest in childhood as cerebral ALD or in adulthood in the form of a progressive myelopathy (AMN). The consistent metabolic abnormality in all forms of X-ALD is an inherited defect in the peroxisomal beta-oxidation of very long chain (VLC) fatty acids (>C(22:0)) which may in turn lead to a neuroinflammatory process associated with demyelination of the cerebral white matter. The current treatment for X-ALD with Lorenzo's oil aims to lower the excessive quantities of VLC fatty acids that accumulate in the patients' plasma and tissues, but does not directly address the inflammatory process in X-ALD. We have previously demonstrated that lovastatin and other 3-HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are capable of normalizing VLC fatty acid levels in primary skin fibroblasts derived from X-ALD patients. Lovastatin can block the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase and proinflammatory cytokines in astrocytes, microglia, and macrophages in vitro. In a preliminary report, we demonstrated that lovastatin therapy can normalize VLC fatty acids in the plasma of patients with X-ALD. Here we report our clinical and biochemical observations on 12 patients with X-ALD who were treated with lovastatin for up to 12 months. Our results show that the high plasma levels of hexacosanoic acid (C(26:0)) showed a decline from pretreatment values within 1 to 3 months of starting therapy with 40 mg of lovastatin per day and stabilized at various levels during a period of observation up to 12 months. The percentage decline from pretreatment values varied and did not correlate with the type of ALD gene mutation (point mutation versus gene deletion). In 6 patients, in whom red cell membrane fatty acid composition was studied, a mean correction of 50% of the excess C(26:0) was observed after 6 months of therapy suggesting sustained benefit. In a few patients who discontinued lovastatin therapy plasma C(26:0) levels reverted to pretreatment values suggesting a cause and effect relationship between these events. Two patients dropped out of the study claiming no clinical benefit, 1 was withdrawn due to adverse effects, and an adult patient with cerebral involvement died during the study. A 10-year-old boy with severe cerebral involvement showed worsening of his neurological status. All patients with AMN remained neurologically stable or showed modest subjective improvement. All patients who did not have Addison's disease at the time of enrollment maintained normal adrenal function throughout the study. The implications of our findings for developing an effective therapy for X-ALD are discussed.", 
    "54": "We analyzed the urinary acylglycine excretion in 26 patients with mitochondrial energy metabolism disorders and in 55 patients with organic acidurias by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS), monitoring precursor ions of m/z 90. Urinary concentrations of the different acylglycines were quantified using deuterated internal standards. Normal values for the most important acylglycines were established. In MCAD and MAD (neonatal form) deficiencies, typical excretion patterns of urinary acylglycines were found in all the samples. In isovaleric aciduria, propionic aciduria, and 3-methylcrotonylglycinuria typical glycine conjugates were always found. Methylmalonic aciduria (mutase deficiency), multiple carboxylase deficiency, and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria revealed pathological acylglycine profiles, even if not specific for the disease. In all these diseases acylglycine excretion seems to be less influenced by the clinical status than organic acid excretion. This method is a useful diagnostic tool for these metabolic disorders, complementary to organic acids and acylcarnitine profiles.", 
    "55": "The objective of this study is to determine the relationships between plasma atorvastatin concentrations, LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol reduction, and atorvastatin dose; the earliest time at which lipid levels change when atorvastatin treatment is initiated or discontinued; and alterations in LDL particle composition. Twenty-four subjects with elevated LDL-cholesterol were treated with escalating daily doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg atorvastatin for 6 weeks each. Serial plasma lipid and lipoprotein analyses were performed during the initiation and discontinuation of atorvastatin therapy, as well as at steady state. LDL-apolipoprotein B and LDL-cholesterol were measured directly after ultracentrifugation, and LDL-cholesterol also was estimated by the method of Friedewald. Steady-state atorvastatin pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated on the last day of each dosing period. LDL-cholesterol (Friedewald) reductions of 34%, 43%, and 57% were produced by atorvastatin doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg, respectively. The mean dose-response relationship was log linear, and almost all individual dose-response curves paralleled the mean curve. LDL-apolipoprotein B reductions were slightly less than those of LDL-cholesterol. Atorvastatin area under the curve (AUC(0-24) values increased proportionally with dose, while values of Cmax (maximum concentration) increased more than proportionally, and Cmin (minimum concentration) increased less than proportionally. Following initiation of dosing, statistically significant decreases in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol (beta quant), and LDL-apolipoprotein B were observed within 24 hours and in LDL-C (Friedewald) within 72 hours. Following discontinuation of drug dosing, statistically significant increases were observed in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol (Friedewald) within 48 hours and in LDL-cholesterol (beta quant) and LDL-apolipoprotein B within 72 hours. At each dose, an individual's LDL-cholesterol response was not correlated with AUC(0-24). In conclusion, atorvastatin produces marked LDL-cholesterol reductions, the mean dose-response relationship is log linear, almost all individual dose-response curves parallel the mean dose-response curve, onset and cessation of action are rapid, the estimated and measured LDL-cholesterol are the same, LDL-cholesterol and LDL-Apo B reductions are similar, and plasma concentrations are not correlated with LDL-cholesterol reduction at a given dose.", 
    "56": "Prior studies of cardiac transplant recipients have shown that pravastatin reduces 12-month rejection and mortality after cardiac transplantation and simvastatin reduces 4-year mortality, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, and intimal thickening. In a 12-month observational study, cardiac transplant recipients received open-label pravastatin 40 mg (n = 42) or simvastatin 20 mg daily (n = 45) on an alternating basis from the time of transplantation. Lipid levels, safety, and post-transplant outcomes were compared. We found no significant differences in total LDL or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, linearized infection or rejection rates, liver function tests, or immunosuppressant dosages between groups at 1, 3, 6, or 12 months. Rhabdomyolysis or myositis occurred only in patients on simvastatin (n = 6, 13.3%) with no episodes for patients on pravastatin (p = 0. 032). Survival at 12 months on an actual treatment basis was 97.6% for patients on pravastatin and 83.7% for those on simvastatin (p = 0.078). Immunosuppression-related deaths occurred in only 2.4% (1 patient) on pravastatin vs 15.6% (n = 7) on simvastatin (p = 0.06). Pravastatin and simvastatin resulted in comparable lipid profiles. Pravastatin use was however free from the high rates of rhabdomyolysis and myositis seen with simvastatin use. Pravastatin was additionally associated with a trend toward superior survival, attributable to fewer immunosuppression-related deaths. For safety and pharmacokinetic reasons, pravastatin should be considered the statin of choice after heart transplantation.", 
    "57": "This study compares the effect of plant stanol ester spread with a placebo spread on cholesterol in patients taking statin therapy, but who still had elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, with 67 women and 100 men with LDL cholesterol >/=130 mg/dl and triglycerides </=350 mg/dl who had been taking a stable dose of a statin drug for at least 90 days before the start of the study. For 8 weeks, participants consumed 3 servings/day of the plant stanol ester spread that provided 5.1 g/day of plant stanol ester or a placebo. The addition of plant stanol ester spread significantly reduced total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol at 2, 4, and 8 weeks when compared with placebo spread. Plant stanol ester spread reduced total cholesterol at 8 weeks by 12% compared with a placebo reduction of 5% (-7% difference; p <0.0001). Plant stanol ester spread reduced LDL cholesterol at 8 weeks by 17% compared with a 7% reduction in the placebo group (-10% difference, p <0.0001). The absolute reduction in LDL cholesterol at 8 weeks was 24 and 10 mg/dl in the stanol ester and placebo groups, respectively. The plant stanol ester spread group also had greater reductions in both serum total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol than the placebo group at 2 and 4 weeks (p <0.001 for all comparisons). Both spreads were well tolerated by study participants, and no significant adverse events were noted. Consumption of spread that provided 5.1 g/day of plant stanol esters effectively reduced elevated total and LDL cholesterol levels in participants on a stable regimen of a statin.", 
    "58": "In this study, we sought to determine the rate of progression of atherosclerosis using coronary calcium scores derived from electron beam tomography (EBT). We studied a variety of disease states (hypertension, high cholesterol, tobacco use, diabetes mellitus) followed for 1 to 6.5 years. We evaluated 299 asymptomatic persons (227 men and 72 women) who underwent 2 consecutive EBT scans at least 12 months apart. The average change in the calcium score (Agatston method) for the entire group was 33.2 +/- 9.2%/year. The treated group (receiving statins) demonstrated an average increase in calcium scores of 15 +/- 8%/year compared with 39 +/- 12%/year for untreated patients (p <0.001). Among the 60 patients on statin monotherapy, 37% had a decrease in the calcium score from baseline to follow-up scan. The relative increase in calcium scores did not vary significantly by gender or risk factors, with the exception of statin-treated hypercholesterolemic subjects. Scores of zero on the initial scan portend a low likelihood of significant calcific deposits on repeat scanning. Only 2 of 81 participants (2%) with scores of zero at baseline had scores >10 on repeat study. In this study, statin therapy induced a 61% reduction in the rate of coronary calcium progression. This study demonstrates that EBT may be a useful tool in assessing efficacy of different interventions to retard progression of atherosclerosis, noninvasively, over relatively short time periods.", 
    "59": "Lipoproteins originating from axon and myelin breakdown in injured peripheral nerves are believed to supply cholesterol to regenerating axons. We have used compartmented cultures of rat sympathetic neurons to investigate the utilization of lipids from lipoproteins for axon elongation. Lipids and proteins from human low density lipoproteins (LDL) and high density lipoproteins (HDL) were taken up by distal axons and transported to cell bodies, whereas cell bodies/proximal axons internalized these components from only LDL, not HDL. Consistent with these observations, the impairment of axonal growth, induced by inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, was reversed when LDL or HDL were added to distal axons or when LDL, but not HDL, were added to cell bodies. LDL receptors (LDLRs) and LR7/8B (apoER2) were present in cell bodies/proximal axons and distal axons, with LDLRs being more abundant in the former. Inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis increased LDLR expression in cell bodies/proximal axons but not distal axons. LR11 (SorLA) was restricted to cell bodies/proximal axons and was undetectable in distal axons. Neither the LDL receptor-related protein nor the HDL receptor, SR-B1, was detected in sympathetic neurons. These studies demonstrate for the first time that lipids are taken up from lipoproteins by sympathetic neurons for use in axonal regeneration.", 
    "60": "Almost 13 million American adults require drug therapy to meet the low-density lipoprotein goals set by the National Cholesterol Education Program. Attempts to achieve these goals through diet and exercise are often unsuccessful. Major studies in recent years have demonstrated that statins decrease low-density lipoprotein levels, coronary events and overall mortality. Statins are the most commonly prescribed lipid-lowering agents because they are effective, well tolerated and easy to administer. Niacin has beneficial effects on all of the main lipid components, and new extended-release tablets have fewer adverse effects. Fibrates remain the most effective agents in lowering triglyceride levels and should be limited to this use. Bile acid sequestrants are seldom prescribed because of their adverse gastrointestinal effects and cumbersome administration.",

Treatment with statin medications for patients who have coronary artery disease with or without hyperlipidemia. Routine use of antiplatelet medication has no proven role in primary stroke prevention, although aspirin is often prescribed for patients with vascular risk factors who have not yet had symptoms of either stroke or ischemic heart disease. The major strategies for secondary stroke prevention are: Appropriate evaluation to identify the mechanism of the initial stroke. Carotid endarterectomy for patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis of 50% or more. Oral anticoagulation with warfarin for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.

We studied the ability of statins to modulate modified LDL-induced cholesterol esterification, metalloproteinase secretion by macrophages, and arterial myocyte migration and proliferation.

This in vitro inhibition was completely prevented by mevalonate and partially by all-trans farnesol and all-trans geranylgeraniol, confirming the specific role of isoprenoid metabolites (probably through prenylated protein[s]) in regulating these cellular events. The inhibitory effect of statins on SMC proliferation has been shown in different models of proliferating cells, such as cultured arterial myocytes and rapidly proliferating carotid and femoral intimal lesions in rabbits, independently of their ability to reduce plasma cholesterol.

Three trials have conducted post hoc analyses of their diabetic subgroups. One of these was a primary intervention trial with gemfibrozil (Helsinki Heart Study).

The two other trials (the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study [4S] and Cholesterol and Recurrent Events Trial [CARE]) were secondary intervention trials conducted with hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors, simvastatin, and pravastatin. Both of these trials found a reduction in coronary events. Although these two trials present the strongest evidence in support of the clinical benefits of lipid reduction in diabetes, they must be interpreted with caution. They are post hoc subgroup analyses, they looked at mainly hypercholesterolemic populations, and they are secondary intervention studies. Four studies aimed at testing the \"lipid hypothesis\" specifically in diabetes are currently under way. Three of these studies (Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes [FIELD], Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study [CARDS], and Lipids in Diabetes Study [LDS]) are primary prevention trials, with clinical events as the primary end point. FIELD uses micronized fenofibrate, CARDS uses atorvastatin, and LDS uses both micronized fenofibrate and cerivastatin alone or in combination.

Their hypocholesterolaemic action results from the inhibition of the intracellular synthesis of cholesterol via the mevalonate pathway. Recent studies have demonstrated that cholesterol is not the only intracellular target of statins. Indeed, statins have been shown to inhibit protein isoprenylation, a post-translational modification involved in membrane localization and protein activity. By inhibiting isoprenylation of Ras protein, statins induce the inhibition of the Ras-AP1 pathway and the decrease in cell proliferation. Similarly, inhibition of Rho protein insoprenylation leads to the disorganization of the cytoskeleton and the induction of the fibrinolytic system. All these effects need to be confirmed in vivo and in the human, and open new areas for these therapeutics agents.",

    "86": "The aim of this study was to investigate whether cerivastatin (BAYw6228), a new potent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, was able to prevent atherogenesis in heterozygous Watanabe heritable-hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits, a model never tested before using this HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. The heterozygous WHHL rabbits of our breeding developed mild hypercholesterolemia along with focal atherosclerotic lesions in the thoracic aorta. A 9-week treatment with cerivastatin at doses comparable to those used in humans (50 microg/kg/day) reduced serum total cholesterol levels (from 94.4 +/- 10.9 to 43.6 +/- 10.5 mg/dl, p < 0.005) and prevented aortic lesion development (intima/media ratio: 0.058 +/- 0.032 vs 0.946 +/- 0.282 in the placebo group, p < 0.0005). Using a panel of monoclonal antibodies specific to macrophages and able to recognize different smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotypes, we observed that cerivastatin treatment affected the differentiation properties of SMCs and drastically reduced SMC and macrophage accumulation in the intima of the thoracic aorta. These data show that in the presence of moderate atherosclerotic lesions, such as those of heterozygous WHHL rabbits, low doses of cerivastatin exert an antiatherogenic effect.", 
    "87": "In eukaryotes the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase catalyses the synthesis of mevalonic acid, a common precursor to all isoprenoid compounds. Here we report the isolation and overexpression of the gene coding for HMG-CoA reductase from Leishmania major. The protein from Leishmania lacks the membrane domain characteristic of eukaryotic cells but exhibits sequence similarity with eukaryotic reductases. Highly purified protein was achieved by ammonium sulphate precipitation followed by chromatography on hydroxyapatite. Kinetic parameters were determined for the protozoan reductase, obtaining K(m) values for the overall reaction of 40.3+/-5.8 microM for (R,S)-HMG-CoA and 81.4+/-5.3 microM for NADPH; V(max) was 33.55+/-1.8 units x mg(-1). Gel-filtration experiments suggested an apparent molecular mass of 184 kDa with subunits of 46 kDa. Finally, in order to achieve a better understanding of the role of this enzyme in trypanosomatids, the effect of possible regulators of isoprenoid biosynthesis in cultured promastigote cells was studied. Neither mevalonic acid nor serum sterols appear to modulate enzyme activity whereas incubation with lovastatin results in significant increases in the amount of reductase protein. Western- and Northern-blot analyses indicate that this activation is apparently performed via post-transcriptional control.", 
    "88": "In clinical trials, all lipid-lowering agents have been associated with mild, asymptomatic elevations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and asparate aminotransferase enzymes. This, along with the fact that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors are hepatotoxic in some animals, led the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to recommend monitoring of liver enzymes for all lipid-lowering agents, except the bile acid sequestrants. Because the drugs act by different mechanisms, ALT elevations may be a pharmacodynamic effect related to lipid lowering, rather than a direct effect of the drug. Animal studies support this assumption. ALT elevations of 3 times the upper limit of normal occur in <3% of patients in clinical trials of lipid-lowering drugs. The elevations are transient and often dose-related, and they usually revert to normal while continuing therapy and have never been associated with hepatotoxicity. Confounding factors include alcohol, acetaminophen, and pre-existing liver disease, such as chronic hepatitis C and type II diabetes with fatty liver, which are both associated with mild, intermittent elevations of ALT. The more important issue is whether or not lipid-lowering agents are hepatotoxic. There are case reports of hepatotoxicity (cholestasis, jaundice, hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, fatty liver, cirrhosis and acute liver failure) with all of the drugs, except cholestyramine. To date there are just 5 cases of documented liver failure linked to lovastatin. There is no evidence that monitoring reduces the rate of hepatotoxicity. Mild elevations of ALT that occur with many drugs, including HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, do not predict hepatotoxicity. Liver enzyme elevations appear to be a class characteristic of lipid-lowering agents. Hepatotoxicity is a rare idiosyncratic reaction, occurring only with sustained released nicotinic acid.", 
    "89": "The expansion of therapeutic options for management of dyslipidemia is a potentially valuable avenue for the optimal treatment of most patients at low-to-moderate risk for coronary artery disease (CAD). In primary prevention, this population is closely approximated by that of the landmark Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study (AFCAPS/TexCAPS). In AFCAPS/TexCAPS, 6,605 men and women without evidence of CAD and with average total cholesterol (180-264 mg/dL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (130-190 mg/dL) concentrations and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels (< or =45 mg/dL for men, < or =47 mg/dL for women) were treated with either lovastatin or placebo for a mean of 5.2 years. With few exceptions, the characteristics of the AFCAPS/TexCAPS cohort were similar to the profile of the majority of people in the United States and that of a potential over-the-counter (OTC)-type subgroup. The dosage of lovastatin used was 20-40 mg/day, titrated to achieve an LDL-cholesterol target of < or =110 mg/dL. Treatment reduced the combined incidence of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and sudden cardiac death by 37% (p<0.001). The risk for fatal and nonfatal heart attack was reduced by 40% (p<0.002), and the need for coronary revascularization procedures was reduced by 33% (p = 0.01). Post hoc analysis of data from a subgroup of the AFCAPS/TexCAPS cohort resembling those in the general population who may benefit from OTC statins indicates similar benefits. The results have important implications for the identification and treatment of persons at risk for coronary disease.", 
    "90": "The leading cause of death and disability in the United States today is cardiovascular disease (CVD). The main risk factor, hypercholesterolemia, is grossly undertreated, although it is widely appreciated that lowering cholesterol levels is key to reducing the incidence of CVD. Cholesterol-lowering therapy decreases total mortality, cardiovascular events, the need for revascularization procedures, and hospitalization costs. A 25-35% reduction of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) indicates significant benefits with regard to morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, most patients who are candidates for cholesterol-lowering treatment do not receive it. Wider use of lipid-lowering agents could, in fact, make a significant difference in patient outcomes. There is strong interest on the part of consumers in over-the-counter (OTC) cholesterol-lowering products that may help them reduce their risk of developing heart disease and live healthier lives. Surveys estimate that half of all patients with high cholesterol would like to have an OTC statin product made available. Increased availability of cholesterol-lowering therapies as well as changes in physician prescribing practices could benefit a broad spectrum of the population that is currently untreated or undertreated. Current prescribing practices and guidelines have not resulted in widespread use of these therapies; therefore, outcomes for CVD prevention remains suboptimal. The proposed advantages of making statins available over-the-counter include their known efficacy, dose consistency, and proven safety profile.", 
    "91": "Plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) plays a central role in atherogenesis, and elevated levels of LDL are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Studies have now revealed that LDL is structurally heterogeneous, based on its size and density. Patients with combined hyperlipidemia exhibit a lipid profile - the so-called atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype - that is associated with elevated triglyceride levels, low levels of high density lipoprotein and a preponderance of atherogenic, small, dense LDL particles. Such individuals are at an increased risk of CHD events, regardless of their total LDL circulating mass. Evidence suggests that when plasma triglycerides exceed a critical threshold of approximately 133 mg/dl (1.5 mmol/l), this favours the formation of small, dense LDL from larger, less dense species. Lipid-lowering agents that are capable of lowering triglyceride levels below this threshold value will cause a shift to a less dense and, therefore, less atherogenic LDL profile. This effect has been demonstrated for the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor atorvastatin which, in addition to its ability to markedly decrease the total LDL circulating mass, can also shift the LDL profile towards less dense, larger species. This suggests that atorvastatin may also affect the atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype found in patients with combined hyperlipidemia.", 
    "92": "Preliminary data suggest that fluvastatin may be safely combined with fibrates. The Fluvastatin Alone and in Combination Treatment Study examined the effects on plasma lipids and safety of a combination of fluvastatin and bezafibrate in patients with coronary artery disease and mixed hyperlipidaemia. A total of 333 patients were randomly allocated in this multicentre double-blind trial to receive 40 mg fluvastatin alone (n=80), 400 mg bezafibrate (n=86), 20 mg fluvastatin+400 mg bezafibrate (n=85) or 40 mg fluvastatin+400 mg bezafibrate (n=82) for 24 weeks. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol decreased >20% in all fluvastatin-containing regimens, with significantly greater decreases compared with bezafibrate alone (P<0.001). Bezafibrate alone and fluvastatin+bezafibrate combinations resulted in greater increases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and decreases in triglycerides compared with fluvastatin alone (P<0.001). Fluvastatin (40 mg)+bezafibrate was the most effective for all lipid parameters with a decrease from baseline at endpoint in LDL-cholesterol of 24%, a decrease in triglycerides of 38% and an increase in HDL-cholesterol of 22%. All treatments were well tolerated with no increase in adverse events for combination therapy versus monotherapy, or between combination regimens. No clinically relevant liver (aspartate aminotransferase [ASAT] or alanine aminotransferase [ALAT]) greater than three times the upper limit of normal) or muscular (creatine phosphokinase (CPK) greater than four times the upper limit of normal) laboratory abnormalities were reported. This large study shows 40 mg fluvastatin in combination with 400 mg bezafibrate to be highly effective and superior to either drug given as monotherapy in mixed hyperlipidaemia, and to be safe and well tolerated.", 
    "93": "Patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HoFH) have markedly elevated low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels that are refractory to standard doses of lipid-lowering drug therapy. In the present study we evaluated the effect of atorvastatin on steady state concentrations of plasma lipids and mevalonic acid (MVA), as well as on 24-h urinary excretion of MVA in patients with well characterized HoFH. Thirty-five HoFH patients (18 males; 17 females) received 40 mg and then 80 mg atorvastatin/day. The dose of atorvastatin was increased further to 120 mg/day in 20 subjects and to 160 mg/day in 13 subjects who had not achieved LDL cholesterol goal, or in whom the dose of atorvastatin had not exceeded 2.5 mg/kg body wt per day. LDL cholesterol levels were reduced by 17% at the 40 mg/day and by 28% at the 80 mg/day dosage (P<0.01). Reduction in LDL cholesterol in the five receptor negative patients was similar to that achieved in the 30 patients with residual LDL receptor activity. Plasma MVA and 24-h urinary excretion of MVA, as markers of in vivo cholesterol synthesis, were elevated at baseline and decreased markedly with treatment. Urinary MVA excretion decreased by 57% at the 40 mg/day dose and by 63% at the 80 mg/day dosage (P<0. 01). There was a correlation between reduction in LDL cholesterol and reduction in urinary MVA excretion; those patients with the highest basal levels of MVA excretion and thus the highest rates of cholesterol synthesis having the greatest reduction in LDL cholesterol (r=0.38; P=0.02). Increasing the dose of atorvastatin to 120 and 160 mg/day did not result in any further reduction in LDL cholesterol or urinary MVA excretion suggesting a plateau effect with no further inhibition of cholesterol synthesis at doses of atorvastatin greater than 80 mg/day.", 
    "94": "We investigated the influence of lovastatin, simvastatin and pravastatin on proliferation and viability of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) in vitro and studied the effects of lovastatin on a mouse SMC line transgenic for a temperature-sensitive mutant of SV40 large T antigen (TAg), known to inhibit the function of p53 and pRb family members. We found that lovastatin and simvastatin inhibited cell proliferation by provoking G0/G1 phase arrest with concomitant depression of the proliferation antigen Ki-67/MIB-1. Lovastatin at high concentrations of 20 micromol/l caused cell death in the presence of serum but not under serum starved conditions, which was verified on the basis of increased DNA strand breaks, decreased DNA content and morphological alterations seen by electron microscopy. Cell death was also found for simvastatin, whereas pravastatin did not exhibit antiproliferative or cytotoxic effects. Mouse SMC transgenic for TAg did not show any impaired sensitivity to the antiproliferative and cell death inducing effect of lovastatin, but both effects could be antagonized by the supplementation of mevalonate. The data indicate that antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects of lovastatin are caused by the using up of products of mevalonate metabolism and do not require the presence of p53 or pRb.", 
    "95": "A meta-analysis of the 7 available randomized cholesterol lowering trials (2 on statins, 2 on fibrates, 2 on resins and 1 on diet) demonstrates a significant 24% relative reduction in the frequency of fatal and non-fatal coronary events, leading to a significant 14% relative reduction in coronary disease related mortality. For total mortality, the statin trials were not comparable with other treatments where there was a trend to overmortality. With the 2 statin trials, there was a nonsignificant 13% reduction in total mortality.", 
    "96": "A meta-analysis of the 13 available randomized trials (3 with clofribrate, 1 with gemfibrozil, 2 with nicotinic acid, and 4 with diet) showed a significant 21% reduction in the frequency of fatal and non-fatal coronary events, coronary mortality and total mortality. For total mortality, only the result of the 2 statin trials was significant (-20%). BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF STATINS, ABSOLUTE VALUES: Measured as the number of patients to treat for 5 years in order to avoid 1 event (NNT), there is a clinically pertinent benefit of secondary prevention (NNT = 15 for events, NNT = 30 for coronary mortality). The absolute value is weaker when patients with minimally elevated cholesterol levels are included. For primary prevention, the absolute value is low with NNT = 44 for events and NNT = 300 for coronary mortality. In addition, as these results were obtained in trials including populations with a much higher risk than the general French population, the absolute beneficial effect may not be pertinent in France except in high-risk patients who present, in addition to a high cholesterol level, other cardiovascular risk factors.",

The steady-state pharmacokinetics of cerivastatin, including the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)0-24, peak plasma concentration (Cmax), time to reach Cmax (tmax) and elimination half-life (t1/2), were determined on day 1 and day 7. The logarithm of the pharmacokinetic variables was analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Safety assessments included physical examination, fundoscopy, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), adverse events, and laboratory safety indices.", 
    "99": "The day-1 AUC in patients with mild renal impairment was similar to that of patients with normal function (19.6 microg/h/l vs 19.2 microg/h/l, respectively). However, the AUC for cerivastatin patients with moderate or severe renal impairment was 40-60% higher (30.8 microg/h/l and 29.0 microg/h/l, respectively). Cmax values for patients with normal, mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment were 3.3, 3.4, 4.6, and 5.2 microg/l, respectively. This modest increase in plasma cerivastatin levels is nearly equivalent to a 0.4-mg daily dose, which has been recently approved in the United States. The mean t1/2 of cerivastatin was less than 4.5 h in all patients, indicating that renal dysfunction did not promote cerivastatin accumulation. This observation was confirmed by the finding that the cerivastatin plasma levels on day 1 and day 7 were similar in all patient groups. Furthermore, the mean AUC and Cmax values for both demethylated and hydroxylated cerivastatin were similar in the patients with the most severe renal dysfunction to the corresponding values in healthy subjects. Cerivastatin was well tolerated in all patients irrespective of renal function. Adverse events were observed in 37% of the subjects; nearly all were mild and generally of short duration, and most resolved without intervention. Incidence of adverse events was similar across all three renal groups and the control group. There were no clinically significant laboratory changes other than those consistent with renal disease.",

It has already been demonstrated that products of the mevalonate pathway play an important role in the progress of the cell cycle and cell survival. Lovastatin (LOV) competitively inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, blocking the synthesis of mevalonic acid and the generation of non-sterol isoprenoids, such as farnesyl residues. The posttranslational farnesylation of p21ras protein is essential for its binding to the membrane and, therefore, for its transforming activity. Considering that p21ras protein was reported to have a significant rol in metastatic behavior of tumor cells, we decided to study LOV as an antimetastatic agent on a rat fibrosarcoma. We demonstrated that a short treatment with LOV diminished primary tumor growth and the number and size of lung experimental metastasis.", 
    "102": "Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is upregulated in arterial injury and plays a role in regulating VSMC proliferation and restenosis. Inflammatory cytokines [e.g., interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta)] released during vascular injury induce iNOS. Small GTP-binding proteins of the Ras superfamily play a major role in IL-1beta-dependent signaling pathways. In this study, we examined the role of Rho GTPases in regulating iNOS expression in VSMCs. Treatment of VSMCs with mevastatin, which inhibits isoprenylation of Rho and other small GTP-binding proteins, produced significantly higher amounts of IL-1beta-evoked NO and iNOS protein compared with control. Similarly, bacterial toxins [Toxin B from Clostridium difficile and C3 ADP-ribosyl transferase (C3) toxin from Clostridium botulinium] that specifically inactivate Rho proteins increased NOS products (NO and citrulline) and iNOS expression. Toxin B increased the activity of iNOS promoter-reporter construct in VSMCs. Both toxins enhanced IL-1beta-stimulated iNOS expression and NO production. These data demonstrate for the first time that inhibition of Rho induces iNOS and suggest a role for Rho protein in IL-1beta-stimulated NO production in VSMCs.", 
    "103": "Despite the availability of various lipid lowering drugs, the treatment of hyperlipidemia, one of the most important risk factors for morbidity and mortality after organ transplantation, remains a therapeutic challenge. We investigated the safety and efficacy of a new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, atorvastatin, in renal transplant patients whose serum lipids were insufficiently controlled by diet and treatment with other lipid lowering drugs. Twenty-four patients (14 males/10 females; mean age 51.2 +/- 2.3 years) were converted to low dose atorvastatin (10 mg/day) at a mean of 67.7 +/- 8.6 months after renal transplantation and prospectively followed for 3 months after initiation of the study drug. HDL, LDL, and total cholesterol, triglycerides, serum creatinine and CPK levels were evaluated pre (-3, -1, 0 months) and post conversion (+1, +3 months). In the eighteen patients who completed the study, low dose atorvastatin therapy led to a significant reduction in total cholesterol (304.6 +/- 13.2 vs. 247.6 +/- 12.0 mg/dl; p = 0.007) and LDL cholesterol (191.9 +/- 9.0 vs. 141.8 +/- 14.7 mg/dl; p < 0.0001) and a modest reduction in serum triglyceride levels at three months after conversion. We conclude that low dose atorvastatin (10 mg/day) can be successfully used and appears to be safe in the treatment of posttransplant hyperlipidemia. Its long-term effects on patient morbidity and mortality as well as graft survival should be investigated in larger and more prolonged prospective trials.",

Despite having good overall safety and efficacy profiles, these medications can still cause significant adverse effects including transient elevation of hepatic transaminases, myopathy, and rhabdomyolysis. Preclinical studies have demonstrated a potential of neoplasia in rats. However in clinical trials HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have not been found to be neoplastic in humans. The dosage used in humans is also significantly lower and therefore it is expected to have a good safety margin. But this may not be entirely true considering the mechanism of neoplastic transformation, which is thought to be different in humans as compared to other species. We report a patient, who developed follicular adenoma with prominent Hurthle cell changes after being on simvastatin for three months but not during one year of pravastatin therapy. In elderly female patients with hyperlipidemia requiring pharmacologic treatment, especially those with a prior history of multinodular goiter, one should consider using an agent which has not been shown to cause thyroid tumors even in animal models. Patients should continue to be followed with frequent periodic thyroid palpation in addition to the usual biochemical monitoring required while on these agents.", 
    "109": "Coronary artery disease is still associated with high morbidity and mortality in Western countries. Lipid blood levels have a tight correlation with the risk of coronary events, and the results of many trials on lipid-lowering therapy (and particularly on simvastatin) demonstrated a significant reduction in total and cardiac mortality, and in the incidence of myocardial infarction and coronary events; even the progression of coronary stenosis has been reduced by treatment with statins. Beyond cholesterol reduction, simvastatin exerts many favorable effects on endothelial function, inflammatory activity, expression of pro-thrombotic factors and oxidative stress, yielding a rational basis for its important clinical positive effects, both in primary and secondary prevention of coronary disease. Future developments, which are the subjects of many planned or ongoing clinical trials, are related to the treatment of high-risk patients, the evaluation of the efficacy of elevated simvastatin dosages and of a deep reduction in cholesterol blood levels, the interaction between simvastatin and other drugs (antioxidant compounds, vitamins, antiplatelet drugs) or interventional procedures (percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty). Particularly, the Heart Protection Study, the A to Z trial, and the SEARCH and SMART studies will provide important data on a wider, earlier and greater use of simvastatin, which has been demonstrated effective both in the prevention and treatment of acute coronary syndromes.",

Beyond their lipid-lowering activity, statins appear to modify many characteristics of the arterial wall, resulting in protection against the progression of plaque growth and/or the precipitation of acute events. The so called \"pleiotropic\" effects of statins, such as the restoration of endothelial activity, the antioxidant potential or the antiproliferative effect on smooth muscle cells, have been investigated mainly in in vitro experiments. In the near future, it will be necessary to unravel the biological significance and the clinical relevance of these effects, which also involve other pathological conditions such as cancer and osteoporosis. Furthermore, lessons from the trials with statins have allowed a better understanding of the mechanisms leading to atherosclerosis which is now considered as an inflammatory process affecting the vascular wall. This has opened new perspectives in the search for the development of newer and more targeted anti-atherogenic drugs.", 
    "111": "The inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (or statins) are the most powerful drugs affecting lipid and lipoprotein levels in plasma. Results obtained from large controlled trials using simvastatin, pravastatin and lovastatin for the primary or secondary prevention of coronary heart disease have demonstrated that treatment with statins is associated with a significant reduction in coronary morbidity and mortality and in total mortality. This is probably due to a more general anti-atherogenic effect of these drugs beyond their lipid-lowering activity. Meta-analysis of data from these large trials indicates that statins have an impact also on the incidence of cerebrovascular events. Currently, six statins have been approved for therapeutic use in different countries. In spite of the similarities in their chemical structure and mechanisms of action, statins may differ in many aspects such as pharmacological properties (hydrophilic vs lipophilic, elimination half-life, cytochrome P450 metabolism, etc.), effects on lipid and other biochemical variables, or pleiotropic effects on different metabolic processes related to atherosclerosis (endothelial function, platelet aggregation, immune function, etc.).

We analyzed a systematic probability sample of 180 newspaper articles (60 for each drug) and 27 television reports that appeared between 1994 and 1998.", 
    "120": "Of the 207 stories, 83 (40 percent) did not report benefits quantitatively. Of the 124 that did, 103 (83 percent) reported relative benefits only, 3 (2 percent) absolute benefits only, and 18 (15 percent) both absolute and relative benefits. Of the 207 stories, 98 (47 percent) mentioned potential harm to patients, and only 63 (30 percent) mentioned costs. Of the 170 stories citing an expert or a scientific study, 85 (50 percent) cited at least one expert or study with a financial tie to a manufacturer of the drug that had been disclosed in the scientific literature. These ties were disclosed in only 33 (39 percent) of the 85 stories.",

    "122": "1. Fluvastatin has been reported to have not only a hypocholesterolaemic effect, but also a protective effect on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) from oxidation. We functionally evaluated the anti-oxidant effect of fluvastatin on oxidation of LDL by copper ions in vitro using mouse macrophages and rabbit aorta preparations. 2. After native LDL (N-LDL) from rabbit plasma had been pre-incubated in the presence or absence of fluvastatin (10 micromol/L) for 4 h, the N-LDL was mildly oxidized by incubation with 5 micromol/L CuCl2 for 5 h and two oxidized LDL, fluvastatin-pretreated (Flu-OxLDL) and -non-treated (OxLDL), were prepared. The level of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in Flu-OxLDL and OxLDL markedly increased compared with N-LDL. The degree of increment was significantly less in Flu-OxLDL than OxLDL. 3. When macrophages were incubated with Flu-OxLDL or OxLDL, the amount of cholesteryl ester that accumulated in the macrophages markedly increased compared with N-LDL. The degree of increment was significantly less in Flu-OxLDL than OxLDL. 4. Acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxations in rabbit aortic rings were impaired in the presence of either Flu-OxLDL or OxLDL. The degree of impairment was significantly less in Flu-OxLDL. 5. The increased TBARS level, facilitated cholesteryl ester accumulation in macrophages and impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation elicited by OxLDL were not affected by simultaneous treatment with fluvastatin (10 micromol/L). 6. These findings indicate that fluvastatin can protect plasma LDL from oxidative modification and, thereby, prevent cholesterol accumulation in macrophages and endothelial dysfunction in blood vessels. This additional anti-oxidative effect of fluvastatin may be beneficial for preventing the progression of atherosclerosis.", 
    "123": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors have been shown to reduce cardiac allograft failure and to lower the incidence of transplant coronary artery disease. These effects result from as yet unknown mechanisms not clearly attributable to lipid lowering. We here report that low-dose simvastatin treatment inhibits excessive expression of monocyte tissue factor (TF) and reduces the persistent hypercoagulability state seen in cardiac transplant recipients.", 
    "124": "Fifteen consecutive heart transplant recipients receiving standard oral immunosuppression were newly assigned to a 10 mg daily simvastatin therapy. Levels of TF activity in both unstimulated and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells drawn from transplant recipients before and under simvastatin therapy were evaluated by one-stage clotting assay.", 
    "125": "Monocyte TF activity was found to be significantly increased in cardiac transplant recipients when compared with healthy controls. Excessive monocyte procoagulant activity was reduced in cardiac transplant recipients during simvastatin treatment. This effect occurred independently of the reduction of serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. As demonstrated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, monocyte TF reduction by simvastatin, observed in 13 of the 15 transplant recipients investigated, could be ascribed to an inhibition of monocyte TF gene transcription. The reduction of monocyte TF activity during treatment with simvastatin paralleled with the normalization of elevated levels of thrombin-antithrombin complex, prothrombin fragment F1+2, and D-dimer, which are markers of thrombin and fibrin formation indicating coagulation activation after cardiac transplantation.", 
    "126": "Inhibition of monocyte TF expression and attenuation of the persistent hypercoagulable state observed in cardiac transplant recipients during treatment with simvastatin may represent an important mechanism by which HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors protect against the development of transplant coronary artery disease.", 
    "127": "Atherosclerosis has many features of a chronic inflammatory disease. Atherosclerotic lesions contain inflammatory cells like activated T-lymphocytes and macrophages. Systemic markers of inflammation such as white blood cells, C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, interleukin 6 and soluble adhesion molecules are predictive of future cardiovascular events, even after adjustment for the contribution of established cardiovascular risk factors. Atherogenic lipoprotein particles, in particular modified low-density lipoproteins (LDL), elicit pro-inflammatory responses of cellular elements of the vessel wall, including endothelial dysfunction and activation of monocyte-derived macrophages. Treatment, with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors has proven the most successful strategy to reduce the concentration of LDL in the circulatory system. These compounds lower LDL cholesterol by inhibiting the mevalonate pathway in the liver, which in turn depletes the regulatory pool of cholesterol and enhances the activity of LDL receptors. Five prospective clinical trials have convincingly demonstrated that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can effectively lower the incidence of cardiovascular events in primary and secondary prevention. Post hoc analyses of these trials suggest that the clinical benefit brought about by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may not entirely be due to their effect on the levels of circulating lipoproteins. In-vitro observations of anti-inflammatory actions of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on vascular cells have been suggested to explain effects beyond lipid-lowering. It is, however, not clear whether these findings are relevant to the in-vivo situation. Further investigation is now necessary in order to determine the relative significance of cholesterol lowering and of ancillary effects to the overall clinical benefit of statin treatment.", 
    "128": "Despite some indications to the contrary, evidence continues to accumulate that controlling cholesterol levels with drug therapy in older persons is a worthwhile goal. Older persons with hypercholesterolemia have an elevated risk of coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality, and this risk increases as they age. Recent clinical trials have suggested that older persons benefit from lipid-lowering therapy as much as younger patients do. Therefore, intervention appears to be justified--as is greater vigilance in identifying untreated patients.", 
    "129": "There is little evidence to show that strict dietary modification alone confers any significant impact on cardiac events in primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. Given the efficacy of the statins, the need for strict dietary modification in patients on statin therapy has been questioned. This study was performed to assess 1) the added benefit on serum lipid levels of a strict low-fat dietary regimen in patients with hypercholesterolaemia already treated with simvastatin; 2) the efficacy of simvastatin on the lipid profile of our sample Asian population; and 3) the tolerability and side-effect profile of simvastatin. This study was a prospective evaluation of 60 patients with hypercholesterolaemia treated with simvastatin who were subjected to either a normal diet or a dietitian guided low-fat diet. Assessment of the effects on serum lipid levels, side-effects, biochemical and haematological markers were performed. After 24 weeks of treatment, a strict dietitian guided low-fat diet conferred no additional benefit over and above what was achieved by simvastatin alone. Furthermore, a higher dose of simvastatin was needed in the dietitian guided diet group to achieve the target LDL-cholesterol level. Simvastatin resulted in a significant positive alteration of lipid profiles in all patients. The drug was well tolerated, with no significant change in either haematological or biochemical indices. Simvastatin is a highly effective cholesterol-lowering drug with a beneficial effect on the entire lipid spectrum in a cross-section of Asian patients, and is well tolerated. A dietitian guided dietary approach confers no additional advantage once statin therapy has been initiated.", 
    "130": "Lipid-lowering with statins reduces blood thrombogenicity. However, it is unknown whether this is purely due to LDL-cholesterol reduction, or it is related to a statin or agent specific effect. We investigated the relationship between reduction in blood thrombogenicity and the magnitude of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) during pravastatin therapy. We prospectively followed for 6 months 57 hyperlipidemic patients who initiated therapy with pravastatin, and 36 patients who were randomized into placebo plus diet. Pravastatin-treated patients were grouped according to the LDL-C reduction at 6 months; (i) \"adequate LDL-C reduction\": LDL-C reduction >30% from baseline or LDL-C<125 mg/dl (n = 38; LDL-C reduction 74 +/- 4 mg/dl; 6-month LDL-C 119 +/- 5 mg/dl); (ii) \"inadequate LDL-C reduction\": neither of the above criteria (n = 19; LDL-C reduction 31 +/- 5 mg/dl; 6-month LDL-C 158 +/- 6 mg/dl). Placebo patients were divided into those \"with LDL-C reduction\" (n = 17, mean reduction 21 +/- 5 mg/dl) and those \"without LDL reduction\" (n = 19). The following parameters were altered at 6 months in both patients with \"adequate\" and \"inadequate\" LDL-C reduction: (1) tissue plasminogen activator decreased by 1.4 +/- 0.4 and 1.5 +/- 0.5 ng/ml respectively (p = NS); (2) plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 decreased by 8.7 +/- 2.0 and 10.1 +/- 2.7 ng/ml respectively (p = NS); (3) thrombus formation under dynamic flow conditions decreased by 3.5 +/- 0.9 and 2.8 +/- 1.2 microm2 x 10(3) respectively (p = NS). In contrast, no significant changes from baseline were noted in placebo-treated patients, regardless of their LDL-C reduction category, and multivariate analysis eliminated LDL-C reduction as an independent predictor of reduction in thrombogenicity. Therefore, the reduction in thrombogenicity was not proportional to the magnitude of LDL-C reduction suggesting that a class or agent specific property is primarily responsible for the pro-fibrinolytic/antithrombotic effects observed.", 
    "131": "Secondary coronary prevention with lipid lowering drugs have become a major issue in health policy formulation due to the large upfront investment in drug therapy. The recently completed LIPID trial with pravastatin in secondary prevention immediately raise the question whether pravastatin might be cost-effective in Switzerland.", 
    "132": "We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis from the perspective of third party payers. The following costs were included in the analysis: daily treatment costs of pravastatin, non fatal myocardial infarction, coronary bypass operations and stroke. Life years gained was obtained by applying the declining exponential approximation of life expectancy. All calculations were standardized to 1000 treated patients.", 
    "133": "The net costs of treating 1000 patients (i.e. drug costs minus the costs of sequelae and interventions) are Fr. 3.6 Mio. In addition, a total of 430 life-years may be saved through treatment. The corresponding cost-effectiveness of pravastatin treatment is Fr. 8341 (nominal) Fr. 6985 (discounted).", 
    "134": "The results suggest that the cost-effectiveness of pravastatin in secondary prevention lie well within the threshold of other commonly accepted medical interventions and may be considered an economically viable approach for secondary coronary prevention."
