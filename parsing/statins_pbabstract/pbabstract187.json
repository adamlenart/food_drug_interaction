    "2": "Fifty-six patients (aged 44-80 years) with stable COPD (a mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] 55%), were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive simvastatin 40 mg/day or to receive no statin treatment. Blood samples were collected before, 2 weeks, and 3 months after statin administration. The levels of fibrinogen, C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin 6 (IL-6), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 were measured.", 
    "3": "The groups did not differ significantly in terms of demographic data, clinical symptoms, pharmacological treatment, spirometry, and lipid profile at baseline. Among comorbidities only arterial hypertension was more frequent in the statin group (32.1% vs. 17.9%, P = 0.03). After 2 weeks as well as 3 months of simvastatin treatment, no significant reduction of any measured inflammatory markers was observed. There was a nonsignificant reduction of CRP and IL-6 in the subgroup with FEV1 >50% during simvastatin treatment. There was a decrease in total cholesterol (from 5.7 to 4.7 mmol/l, P = 0.0018) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (from 3.46 to 2.47 mmol/l, P = 0.000037) in the statin group.",

The study of miRNAs is a rapidly emerging field; recent findings have revealed a significant role for miRNAs in atherosclerosis and lipoprotein metabolism, which will be described in this review.", 
    "6": "The discovery of miRNA gene regulatory mechanisms contributing to endothelial integrity, macrophage inflammatory response to atherogenic lipids, vascular smooth muscle-cell proliferation, and cholesterol synthesis are described. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that miRNAs may play a role in mediating the beneficial pleiotropic effects observed with statin-based lipid-lowering therapies. New modifications to miRNA mimetics and inhibitors, increasing targeting efficacy and cellular uptake, will likely enable future therapies to exploit miRNA gene regulatory networks.", 
    "7": "At this time, the applicability and full potential of miRNAs in clinical practice is unknown. Nonetheless, recent advances in miRNA delivery and inhibition hold great promise of a tremendous clinical impact in atherosclerosis and cholesterol regulation.", 
    "8": "Diltiazem increases systemic exposure to simvastatin via inhibition of CYP3A. This study assessed the impact of this interaction on the lipid-lowering effects of simvastatin. Chinese patients with hypercholesterolemia were randomized to receive simvastatin 20 mg daily alone or together with diltiazem 60 mg 3 times daily for 4 weeks with a washout period of 4 weeks in an open-label, crossover study. Blood pressure, fasting serum lipid profile, and safety tests were determined at baseline and after each treatment period. Trough serum diltiazem was measured at the end of the 4-week combination treatment. In the 30 patients who completed the study, simvastatin treatment significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by mean (\u00b1 standard error) 41.0% \u00b1 2.2% (P < .001), and the combination with diltiazem showed an additional reduction of 1.66% (95% confidence interval: -4.63 to 7.96, P > .05). The additional change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with diltiazem showed a nonsignificant positive correlation with the trough serum diltiazem concentration (R(2) = 0.142, P = .058). Co-administration of diltiazem 60 mg 3 times daily with simvastatin 20 mg daily tended to increase the changes in lipid parameters in these Chinese subjects, but the effects did not reach significance.", 
    "9": "The effect of a single intrajejunal dose of gemfibrozil (600 mg) on the plasma pharmacokinetics and biliary excretion of a single intrajejunal dose of rosuvastatin (20 mg) was investigated by using a multichannel catheter positioned in the distal duodenum-proximal jejunum in 8 healthy volunteers. Bile and plasma samples were collected every 20 minutes for 200 minutes, with additional plasma samples being drawn for up to 48 hours. Gemfibrozil did not affect the bioavailability of rosuvastatin, although it increased the apparent absorption phase during the initial 200 minutes (AUC(plasma,200min)) by 1.56-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.14-2.15). The interaction was less pronounced in this single-dose study than in a previous report when gemfibrozil was administered repeatedly; nevertheless, the interaction coincided with the highest exposure to gemfibrozil. The plausible reason why the interaction in this investigation was only minor is the low exposure to gemfibrozil (and its metabolites), suggesting that the total plasma concentration of gemfibrozil needs to be above 20 \u00b5M to affect the disposition of rosuvastatin. This study demonstrates the value of monitoring the plasma pharmacokinetics of the inhibitor, and not only the drug under investigation, to improve the mechanistic interpretation.", 
    "10": "A large body of evidence suggests that, besides their cholesterol-lowering effect, statins exert anti-inflammatory action. Consequently, statins may have therapeutic potential in immune-mediated disorders such as multiple sclerosis. Our objectives were to determine safety, tolerability and efficacy of low-dose atorvastatin plus high-dose interferon beta-1a in multiple sclerosis patients responding poorly to interferon beta-1a alone. Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients, aged 18-50 years, with contrast-enhanced lesions or relapses while on therapy with interferon beta-1a 44 microg (three times weekly) for 12 months, were randomized to combination therapy (interferon + atorvastatin 20 mg per day; group A) or interferon alone (group B) for 24 months. Patients underwent blood analysis and clinical assessment with the Expanded Disability Status Scale every 3 months, and brain gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging at screening, and 12 and 24 months thereafter. Primary outcome measure was contrast-enhanced lesion number. Secondary outcome measures were number of relapses, EDSS variation and safety laboratory data. Forty-five patients were randomized to group A (n = 21) or B (n = 24). At 24 months, group A had significantly fewer contrast-enhanced lesions versus baseline (p = 0.007) and significantly fewer relapses versus the two pre-randomization years (p < 0.001). At survival analysis, the risk for a 1-point EDSS increase was slightly higher in group B than in group A (p = 0.053). Low-dose atorvastatin may be beneficial, as add-on therapy, in poor responders to high-dose interferon beta-1a alone.",

In mice with human-like lipoprotein metabolism (APOE*3-Leiden.CETP transgenic mice), a decrease in hepatic triglyceride content is associated with a decrease in plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) mass and an increase in HDL levels. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess the effects of pioglitazone on CETP mass in patients with type 2 diabetes.",

At baseline and after 24 weeks of treatment plasma HDL cholesterol levels and CETP mass were measured, and hepatic triglyceride content was assessed by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. RESULTS Pioglitazone decreased hepatic triglyceride content (5.9 [interquartile range 2.6-17.4] versus 4.1 [1.9-12.3]%, P < 0.05), decreased plasma CETP mass (2.33 +/- 0.10 vs. 2.06 +/- 0.10 microg/ml, P < 0.05), and increased plasma HDL cholesterol level (1.22 +/- 0.05 vs. 1.34 +/- 0.05 mmol/l, P < 0.05). Metformin did not significantly change any of these parameters.",

Men had greater triglyceride and non-HDL cholesterol reductions than women, and black/Hispanic patients had less favorable lipid effects than other races/ethnicities. Increasing baseline LDL cholesterol was associated with improvements in most lipids; higher baseline non-HDL cholesterol with improved HDL cholesterol and triglycerides; higher baseline HDL cholesterol with greater non-HDL cholesterol and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) reductions; and higher baseline hs-CRP with smaller LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B reductions. Patients with high baseline non-HDL cholesterol or triglycerides less frequently attained LDL cholesterol targets. Obesity was inversely related to HDL cholesterol and hs-CRP changes, and higher baseline A1C to smaller apolipoprotein B reductions. Metabolic syndrome was not a significant predictor.",

This study has investigated the efficacy of statins, which inhibit activation of RhoA, in opposing the thrombin-induced loss of barrier integrity of monolayers of cultured bovine corneal endothelium.", 
    "19": "Myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, a biochemical measure of actomyosin contraction, was assayed by urea-glycerol gel electrophoresis, followed by western blot analysis. The locus of MLC phosphorylation and changes in the organization of the PAMR were visualized by immunostaining. Phosphorylation of MYPT1, a regulatory subunit of myosin light-chain phosphatase (MLCP), was assessed by Western blot analysis to determine down-regulation of RhoA. The barrier integrity was assessed in terms of trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TER), and further confirmed by determining permeability to FITC dextran (10 kDa) and distribution of ZO-1, a marker of tight junctional assembly.", 
    "20": "Lovastatin, a prototype of lipophilic statins, induced MLC dephosphorylation under basal conditions. It opposed increase in phosphorylation of MLC and MYPT1 in response to thrombin and nocodazole, agents known to activate RhoA in the endothelium. Pretreatment with the statin opposed the thrombin- and nocodazole-induced disruption of the PAMR and the thrombin-induced decline in TER. Lovastatin also opposed the thrombin- and nocodazole-induced increase in permeability to FITC dextran and redistribution of ZO-1. However, upon supplementation with GGPP (geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate), lovastatin failed to oppose the effects of thrombin and nocodazole on the PAMR, ppMLC, and ZO-1 distribution.",

    "24": "New users of statins from January 1, 1995, to December 31, 2004, were captured from a nationwide prescription register, and the pattern of statin use was observed until December 31, 2005. The association between year of statin initiation and persistence with statin therapy during the first year of statin use was modeled using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis with multivariable adjustment. The median adherence (proportion of days covered) was computed among patients who discontinued therapy during each 365-day interval since statin initiation.", 
    "25": "In total, 490,024 new users of statins were identified. In the multivariable-adjusted model, discontinuation during the first year among initiators of statin use in 1996 and 1997 was similar to that in 1995 (hazard ratio [HR], 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95-1.03 in 1996; and HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.98-1.05 in 1997). Compared with the 1995 cohort, the 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004 cohorts were less likely to discontinue statin use. Hazard ratios of discontinuation for the cohorts ranged from 0.91 (95% CI, 0.88-0.94) in 1998 to 0.80 (95% CI, 0.78-0.83) in 2004. There were no differences in adherence with respect to the duration of therapy among the yearly cohorts.", 
    "26": "Compared with the 1995 cohort, 1-year persistence with statin therapy in Finland improved among new users of statins in 1998, and the improvement persisted up to 2004. Adherence to statin therapy remained stable among initiators from 1995 to 2004.", 
    "27": "The aim of this study was to compare the effects of 3 different statin regimens that have equivalent low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering efficacy on the apolipoprotein B/A1 ratio and glucose metabolism. After a 4-week dietary lead-in, 90 hypercholeserolemic patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups for 8 weeks: atorvastatin 20 mg, rosuvastatin 10 mg, or atorvastatin/ezetimibe 5 mg/5 mg. At drug treatment week 8, we compared the percentage changes in lipid parameters, apolipoprotein B/A1 ratio, hemoglobin A1c, and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) from baseline. Seventy-six patients completed the study and the percentage changes in LDL-C were comparable among the groups. However, the percentage reduction in the apolipoprotein B/A1 ratio was significantly greater in the rosuvastatin group (-47% +/- 14%, P = .04) and the combination group (-46% +/- 8%, P = .05) than in the atorvastatin group (-39% +/- 11%). The percentage increase in hemoglobin A1c was small but significantly greater in the atorvastatin group compared to the combination group (3.0% +/- 5.2% and -0.4% +/- 4.0%, P = .03). The effect of rosuvastatin on hemoglobin A1c was not different from those of the other 2 regimens. The effects of 3 statin regimens were similar on HOMA-IR. In conclusion, 3 statin regimens have differential effect on apolipoprotein B/A1 and glycemic control after comparable LDL-C reduction.", 
    "28": "Data on rapid effects of statins in patients (pts) with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are mostly from trials of atorvastatin (ATO). We hypothesized that due to high potency 10 mg of rosuvastatin (ROS) would produce same changes of lipids and inflammation markers as 40 mg ATO.",

Pts with low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) >6, triglycerides (TG) >4.5 mmol/l, C-reactive protein (CRP) >10 mg/l (non-fasting sample) were not included. LDL-C, high density lipoprotein (HDL)-C, TG, apolipoproteins A-1 (apoA), and B (apoB), high sensitivity CRP, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured in fasting blood sampled at randomization and 2 weeks later.", 
    "30": "Both statins caused similar decreases of LDL-C (-44.0% ROS, -50% ATO; both p<0.00001 vs control [-4%]). TG significantly rose in ROS (p=0.042) and control (p=0.008) groups but not in ATO group (p=0.615). HDL-C decreased similarly in 3 groups. ApoA-1 did not differ between 3 groups at all time points. ApoB decreased more in ATO (-32.6%), than in ROS (-24%) group (p=0.049). CRP and IL-6 changes from baseline were insignificant. In ROS group CRP had tendency to decrease but same tendency took place in control. TNFalpha significantly increased in all groups. There were no significant differences between 3 groups in inflammation markers.", 
    "31": "In pts with NSTEACS effect on lipids of ROS 10 mg was somewhat inferior to ATO 40 mg/day. Unexpectedly ATO and ROS during first 14 days of NSTEACS produced no significant effect on inflammation markers possibly because of insufficient dose of both.", 
    "32": "Recent studies reported that 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors have pleotropic effects independent of their lipid-lowering properties. The present study was undertaken to determine whether treatment with rosuvastatin (RO) would be beneficial in a rat model of bile duct ligation (BDL). Animals were divided into three groups: a sham group (group I), a BDL group treated with vehicle (group II), and a BDL group treated with RO (10 mg/kg) (group III). Serum levels of total bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase decreased significantly in group III when compared to group II. Lipid peroxides and NO levels of group III were found to be significantly lower than those of group II. Antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, glutathione-S-transferase, and catalase) activity in liver tissues markedly decreased in group II, whereas treatment with RO preserved antioxidant enzyme activity. DT-diaphorase activity in group II was significantly higher than that in group III. The histopathological results showed multiple numbers of newly formed bile ductules with inflammatory cells infiltration in group II. These pathological changes were improved in group III. Our data indicate that RO ameliorates hepatic injury, inflammation, lipid peroxidation and increases antioxidant enzymes activity in rats subjected to BDL. RO may have a beneficial effect on treatment of cholestatic liver diseases.", 
    "33": "Patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) usually have a history of tobacco and alcohol abuse. These 2 intoxications not only are main oncologic risk factors but also show a strong causal relationship with certain comorbid conditions. Examples are coronary artery disease, stroke, renal dysfunction, and heart failure, which are all proven major risk factors for an adverse postoperative outcome after stressful noncardiac surgery. Preoperative identification of these conditions could lead to preventive measures in patients with HNSCC that undergo extensive surgery. Preventing morbidity and mortality is of medical and economical importance.", 
    "34": "All comorbidity of 135 consecutive patients with HNSCC that underwent extensive oncologic and reconstructive surgery as the first form of treatment between 2001 and 2007 was investigated. Based on these data, a Lee Cardiac Risk Index (LCRI) Score and an overall Adult Comorbidity Evaluation (ACE-27) severity score were calculated. The predictive value of these scores and the American Society of Anesthesiologists' (ASA) classification toward major cardiovascular complication development were investigated. Major cardiovascular complications were defined as: cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmias. The impact of these complications on duration of hospitalization, medical costs, and short-term mortality (defined as death within 6 months after primary tumor diagnosis) were investigated as well. The cardioprotective effect of preoperatively prescribed beta blockers and statins are discussed.", 
    "35": "Twenty-two patients developed 23 major cardiovascular complications (16.3%). In univariate and multivariate analyses, a higher LCRI score was associated with an increased risk for major cardiovascular complications, as was an age >70 years (all values of p < .01). The area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) for the multivariate model was 0.84, indicating a good prognostic value. In univariate and multivariate analysis, a higher ACE-27 score was associated with an increased risk for major cardiovascular complications, as was as age >70 years (all values of p < .01). The AUC for this model was 0.84, indicating a performance similar to that of the LCRI score model. No statistically significant results were found for the ASA scores (p = .38). Preoperative beta-blocker use showed a significant cardioprotective function in univariate analysis, whereas statins did not. The mean duration of hospitalization was prolonged by 7 days in patients with a major cardiovascular complication. In economic terms, this means a cost increase of at least 3500 euros. None of the patients died during admission because of a major cardiovascular complication. The short-term mortality rate was 11.1%, but no specific cardiovascular cause of death was reported in these patients.", 
    "36": "Prevention of major complication occurrence after extensive HNSCC surgery is of medical and economic importance. Our results show that the ACE-27 and the LCRI are suitable instruments for preoperative major cardiovascular complication risk assessment. Addition of the variable age >70 years shows an improvement in predictive value of both instruments. Because of its simplicity we advise the implementation of the LCRI into preoperative HNSCC screening protocols. We advise the exploration of low-dose long-acting beta blockers as a preventive treatment strategy.", 
    "37": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance (IR), and chronic inflammation. Simvastatin improves endocrine/clinical aspects of PCOS and decreases systemic inflammation in PCOS. There have been no comparative studies carried out regarding the effects of different statin treatment in PCOS. We aimed to assess the effects of two different statin treatments on various metabolic, endocrine, oxidative and inflammatory factors in PCOS.",

    "39": "Sixty-four (64) women with PCOS were included in the study. Group 1 had (atorvastatin, 20lmg daily; n=32) or group 2 had (simvastatin, 20l mg daily n=32). The metabolic, endocrine, inflammatory and oxidative profiles were evaluated.", 
    "40": "Group 1 resulted in a significant reduction in the HOMA index and fasting insulin (-26.9+/-9.6%, -26.2+/-10.8%, P<0.01, respectively).CRP levels decreased by 63.6+/-15.9% in group 1 (P<0.01), whereas in the group 2 it decreased by 34.6+/-10.7% (P<0.05). Serum levels of LH declined by 19.1+/-4.5% (P<0.05) in the group 1 and by 39.3+/-11.9% (P<0.01) in the group 2. FAI decreased by -20+/-9.9% in group 1 (P<0.05) and it decreased by -38.7+/-13.8% in the group 2 (P<0.01). MDA levels decreased by 32.6+/-9.6% in group 1 (P<0.05), whereas in the group 2 it decreased by 30.3+/-10.9% (P<0.01).

    "41": "Both the statins are effective in reducing inflammation, hyperandrogenemia, oxidative stress and metabolic parameters. While atorvastatin has more noticeable effects on fasting insulin and insulin sensitivity, simvastatin has a dominant effect on total T in PCOS women.", 
    "42": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) probably occurs by oxidative, inflammatory and autoimmune mechanisms. This study investigated the influence of statin on the stability of erythrocyte membranes in MS patients. The population was composed of one group with simvastatin therapy (20 mg/day), another group without statin therapy and a healthy control group. The stability of erythrocytes was evaluated by the half-transition points, H(50) and D(50), obtained from the curves of hemolysis induced by hypotonic shock and ethanol action, respectively. Erythrocytes of MS patients were less stable against lysis by both chaotropes. This behavior may be merely a consequence of the lifestyle of MS patients or it may be intrinsically associated with the conjunct of factors responsible for the development of the disease. The use of statin by MS patients was associated with lower levels of LDL and total cholesterol, as expected, and with higher stability of erythrocytes against ethanol compared to the values of untreated MS patients.", 
    "43": "Despite the risk of critical heart disease, poor adherence to treatment is common in patients with lifestyle-related diseases such as hypercholesterolemia. The association between adherence to treatment and clinical outcome was examined in JELIS (Japan EPA Lipid Intervention Study) and strategies for avoiding poor adherence were explored.", 
    "44": "Patients taking 80% or more of the study medications were considered to exhibit good adherence. The primary endpoint was either sudden cardiac death or myocardial infarction. Adherence was lower in the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + statin group (66.5%) than in the statin alone group (72.5%). In good adherers with previous coronary artery disease, EPA substantially reduced the risk compared with statin alone (hazard ratio 0.55, 95% confidence intervals 0.34-0.88, P<0.014). Furthermore, the clinical benefit of EPA + statin was significantly larger in patients with good adherence than in those with poor adherence (P=0.041). Finally, a 5-year risk prediction model constructed from the data indicated that complete adherence would lead to 51% reduction of risk compared with non-adherence.", 
    "45": "Good adherence to medication was associated with a lower cardiovascular risk than with poor adherence, and the assistance of a pharmacist is of great importance in achieving persistent adherence during treatment.", 
    "46": "The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of drugs that increase gastric vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and suppress gastric tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in gastric ulcer healing in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Sixty male albino rats were made diabetic by intraperitoneal (i.p.) streptozotocin injection and ten rats were injected i.p. by a single dose of saline. Six weeks following streptozotocin or saline injection, gastric ulcers were induced by serosal application of acetic acid. Three days after acetic acid application, rats were divided into: group I (non-diabetic control), group II (streptozotocin-injected), groups III-VII (streptozotocin-injected rats treated with insulin, insulin and pentoxifylline, insulin and simvastatin, pentoxifylline as well as simvastatin, respectively, for 7 days following acetic acid application. The use of insulin, combinations of insulin and pentoxifylline or simvastatin resulted in a significant decrease in gastric ulcer area, significant increase in epithelial regeneration assessed histologically, significant increase in gastric VEGF concentration, and gastric von Willebrand factor (vWF) as well as significant decrease in gastric TNF-alpha. A significant difference in gastric ulcer area as well as in gastric TNF-alpha, VEGF and vWF levels could be observed between rats that received combinations of insulin and pentoxifylline or simvastatin compared to rats that received either drug alone. Our results suggest the feasibility of a novel treatment strategy, namely pentoxifylline and simvastatin, for patients in whom impairment of ulcer healing constitutes a secondary complication of diabetes mellitus.", 
    "47": "Ezetimibe (Ezetrol) selectively inhibits the intestinal absorption of cholesterol and phytosterols. Its mechanism of action results in a synergistic cholesterol-lowering effect together with a statin that inhibits cholesterol synthesis by the liver, which leads to the development of a fixed ezetimibe-simvastatin combination (Inegy). Ezetimibe has been more particularly studied in patients with type 2 diabetes whose high cardiovascular risk is well known. The present article aims at describing recent advances and specificities concerning the use of ezetimibe in the diabetic population.", 
    "48": "Treatment with simvastatin (vasilip) at a daily dose of 20 mg combined with conventional cardiac therapy was given for 3 months to 132 patients with coronary heart disease and postinfarction cardiosclerosis with dyslipidemia. Activity of tissue and plasma antioxidative enzymes increased in 60% of the patients and decreased in 40%. Treatment with antioxidants 2-ethyl-6-methyl-3-oxypiridine succinate (mexidol) and ubichinon (cudesan QIO) improved antioxidative status of the patients and clinical picture of cardiac pathology.", 
    "49": "Monocytes, macrophages, and inflammation play a key role in the process of neointimal proliferation and restenosis. The present study evaluated whether systemic and transient depletion of monocytes could be obtained by a single intravenous (IV) injection of simvastatin liposomes, for the inhibition of neointima formation. Balloon-injured carotid artery rats (n = 30) were randomly assigned to treatment groups of free simvastatin, simvastatin in liposomes (3 mg/kg), and saline (control). Stenosis and neointima to media ratio (N/M) were determined 14 days following single IV injection at the time of injury by morphometric analysis. Depletion of circulating monocytes was determined by flow cytometry analyzes of blood specimens. Inhibition of RAW264.7, J774, and THP-1 proliferation by simvastatin-loaded liposomes and free simvastatin was determined by the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Simvastatin liposomes were successfully formulated and were found to be 1.5-2 times more potent than the free drug in suppressing the proliferation of monocytes/macrophages in cell cultures of RAW 264.7, J774, and THP-1. IV injection of liposomal simvastatin to carotid-injured rats (3 mg/kg, n = 4) resulted in a transient depletion of circulating monocytes, significantly more prolonged than that observed following treatment with free simvastatin. Administration to balloon-injured rats suppressed neointimal growth. N/M at 14 days was 1.56 +/- 0.16 and 0.90 +/- 0.12, control and simvastatin liposomes, respectively. One single systemic administration of liposomal simvastatin at the time of injury significantly suppresses neointimal formation in the rat model of restenosis, mediated via a partial and transient depletion of circulating monocytes.", 
    "50": "We prospectively compared the anti-inflammatory and antidyslipidemic effects of fenofibrate and statins in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Forty-four RA patients [male (M) = 7, female (F) = 37] with dyslipidemia were enrolled in this 6-month study and randomly allocated to the fenofibrate (2 M + 21 F = 23) or statins (5 M + 16 F = 21) group. We measured blood chemistry (serum lipid profile, sugar, urate, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase) and blood pressure 2 h after breakfast. Visual analog scale (VAS), C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and prednisolone (PSL) dosage were also recorded immediately before and after the study. Fenofibrate, but not statins, significantly decreased serum levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and triglycerides (all p < 0.05).

The chronic inflammatory state--a hallmark of RA--is considered to be a driving force for accelerated atherogenesis. Consequently, aggressive control of RA disease activity is thought to be instrumental for cardiovascular risk reduction. Currently, statin-mediated reduction of LDL-cholesterol levels is considered to be the cornerstone of cardiovascular disease prevention. In addition to their lipid-lowering capabilities, statins exert immunomodulatory effects, which could be of dual benefit in the treatment of RA. Guidelines on the reduction of cardiovascular risk in patients with RA are lacking, however, largely owing to the absence of data from randomized controlled trials. This Review focuses on the pathophysiology of cardiovascular events in RA, as well as the need to adjust cardiovascular risk engines to better-accommodate the impact of chronic inflammatory disease over and above the established risk factors to predict cardiovascular risk in patients with RA.",

To test the hypothesis that sterol loading promotes foam cell formation and vascular disease by perturbing a network of interacting proteins, we used a global approach to identify proteins that are differentially expressed when macrophages are loaded with cholesterol in vivo. Our analysis revealed a sterol-responsive network that is highly enriched in proteins with known physical interactions, established roles in vesicular transport, and demonstrated atherosclerotic phenotypes in mice. Pharmacologic intervention with a statin or rosiglitazone and use of mice deficient in LDL receptor or apolipoprotein E implicated the network in atherosclerosis. Biochemical fractionation revealed that most of the sterol-responsive proteins resided in microvesicles, providing a physical basis for the network's functional and biochemical properties.

We also investigated the effects of a late subchronic rosuvastatin treatment on iron- and age-induced cognitive deficits. Rats received vehicle or 10.0mg/kg Fe(2+) orally at postnatal days 12-14. When animals reached the age of 23 months, they received daily intraperitoneal injections of saline or rosuvastatin (0.2 or 2.0mg/kg) for 21 days. Twenty-four hours after the last injection, they were submitted to novel object recognition training. Retention test sessions were performed 1.5 and 24h after training, in order to assess short-term and long-term memory, respectively. Results indicated that aged animals that received iron in the neonatal period showed more severe memory deficits than vehicle-treated ones, suggesting that iron potentiates age-associated memory impairments. Rosuvastatin improved recognition memory deficits associated with iron loading and aging, providing evidence that statins may be considered for the treatment of age-associated cognitive decline.", 
    "90": "Despite successful intensive care a substantial portion of critically ill patients dies after discharge from the intensive care unit or hospital. Observational studies investigating long-term survival of critically ill patients reported that most deaths occur during the first months or year after discharge. Only limited data on the causes of impaired quality of life and post-intensive care unit deaths exist in the current literature. In this manuscript we hypothesize that the acute inflammatory response which characteristically accompanies critical illness is ensued by a prolonged imbalance or activation of the immune system. Such a chronic low-grade inflammatory response to critical illness may be sub-clinical and persist for a variable period of time after discharge from the intensive care unit and hospital. Chronic inflammation is a well-recognized risk factor for long-term morbidity and mortality, particularly from cardiovascular causes, and may thus partly contribute to the impaired quality of life as well as increased morbidity and mortality following intensive care unit and hospital discharge of critically ill patients. Assuming that critical illness is indeed followed by a prolonged inflammatory response, important implications for treatment would arise. An interesting and potentially beneficial therapy could be the administration of immune-modulating drugs during the time after intensive care unit or hospital discharge until chronic inflammation has subsided. Statins are well-investigated and effective drugs to attenuate chronic inflammation and could potentially also improve long-term outcome of critically ill patients after intensive care unit or hospital discharge. Future studies evaluating the course of inflammation during and after critical illness as well as its response to statin therapy are required.",

However, the total inhibitory activity of 24 fractions was decreased by about 70%. From eight active fractions, four compounds were obtained by recrystallization and identified as quercetin (a), hyperoside (b), rutin (c), and chlorogenic acid (d), the contents of which in hawthorn EtOH extract were 0.16, 0.32, 1.45, and 0.95%, respectively.

The in vivo results also revealed that the mixture had a more significant lipid-lowering efficacy than the monomers. Structure-activity relationship revealed the inhibitory activity and lowering-lipid ability of compounds a-c decreased with increasing glycoside numbers. It was concluded that there were synergetic effects on inhibiting HMGR and lowering lipid among compounds a-d, and the weak hydrophilic ability benefits the inhibition to HMGR and lowering-lipid efficacy.",

In this study lovastatin triggered biosynthesis of the anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving mediator 15-epi-lipoxin A(4) (15-epi-LXA(4)). During interactions between human neutrophils and airway epithelial cells, the statin-induced increase in 15-epi-LXA(4) was associated with increased 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (14,15-EET) generation. When added to activated neutrophils, 14,15-EET enhanced 15-epi-LXA(4) biosynthesis. In a murine model of airway mucosal injury and inflammation, lovastatin increased 15-epi-LXA(4) formation in vivo and markedly decreased acute lung inflammation. Administration of 15-epi-LXA(4) also inhibited lung inflammation in an additive manner with lovastatin. Together, these results indicate that statin-triggered 15-epi-LXA(4) generation during human leukocyte-airway epithelial cell interactions is an endogenous mechanism for statin-mediated tissue protection at mucosal surfaces that may also be relevant in the statins' ability to stimulate the resolution of inflammation.", 
    "140": "PURPOSE. To examine whether treatment with oral blood-pressure-lowering medication or statins influences the risk of glaucoma. METHODS. This study was a case-control investigation, nested within a computerized primary care database of 177 general practices across the United Kingdom; 8778 cases diagnosed and/or treated for glaucoma between 2000 and 2007, and 8778 glaucoma-free controls matched for age, sex, and practice. Odds ratios for treatment with oral antihypertensives (including selective beta(1) and nonselective beta-blockers) and statins in the 5 years before diagnosis were calculated by logistic regression, adjusted for a marker of socioeconomic position and number of drug types prescribed (as a measure of health service usage). RESULTS. Prevalence of oral beta-blocker use in the 5 years before diagnosis was lower in the cases (22.5%) than in the controls (23.6%), adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-0.94). This effect was presence with treatment with beta(1)-selective medications (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.74-0.88) but not with nonselective medications (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.94-1.24). The prevalence of thiazide use was higher among the glaucoma cases than among the controls (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.04-1.23). Neither statins nor other antihypertensive treatments were associated with the risk of glaucoma. CONCLUSIONS. Oral beta(1) beta-blockers may protect against development of glaucoma. The current consensus on the relative importance of beta(2) receptor blockade in treating glaucoma may have to be reviewed. Changes in prescribing oral beta-blockers for cardiovascular disorders may affect the number of those who eventually have glaucoma.

    "146": "The expression of oxysterol binding protein-related protein (ORP) 5 is related to invasion and a poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients. ORP5 induced the expression of sterol response element binding protein (SREBP) 2 and activated the downstream gene of sterol response element. ChIP using SREBP2 antibody revealed that histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) was one of the downstream genes of SREBP2. The effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) were analyzed according to the expression level of ORP5. The invasion rate and growth was suppressed in cells that strongly expressed ORP5 in a time- and dose-dependent manner, but had less effect in cells weakly expressing ORP5, suggesting that when the potential of invasion and growth relies on the cholesterol synthesis pathway, it becomes sensitive to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. Furthermore, HDAC inhibitor, tricostatin A, induced the expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog as well when ORP5 was suppressed or the cells were treated with statin. Treatment with both statin and tricostatin A showed a synergistic antitumor effect in cells that highly expressed ORP5. Therefore, in some pancreatic cancers, continuous ORP5 expression enhances the cholesterol synthesis pathway and this signal transduction regulates phosphatase and tensin homolog through HDAC5 expression. This is the first report to detail how the signal transduction of cholesterol synthesis is related to cancer invasion and why statins can suppress invasion and growth.",

The increase in TEER was significantly reduced in the presence of isoprenoid geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, whereas farnesyl pyrophosphate had no effect on TEER. Our immunocytochemical and Western blot analyses revealed that treatment with pitavastatin enhanced the expression of claudin-5, a main functional protein of TJs.

    "171": "Numbers of total blood DCs, mDCs and pDCs declined in CAD patients compared with control patients, but without differences between the CAD groups. Interleukin-6 and high sensitivity C-reactive protein displayed inverse associations with mDCs. A FMD below the median of the study population, use of beta-blockers or of lipid-lowering drugs was associated with increased mDCs, whereas pDCs were similar. Interestingly, the effects of drugs and FMD were additive with that of CAD.", 
    "172": "This study indicates that lower blood DCs do not result from medication intake or endothelial dysfunction, and are an overall systemic effect of atherosclerosis rather than CAD type (stable or unstable) or number of stenotic coronary arteries. In view of discrete associations with cytokines, FMD, beta-blockers and statins, mDCs and pDCs seem to behave differently and may influence inflammation during atherosclerosis in different ways.", 
    "173": "Although previous studies indicate that simvastatin can attenuate cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), its effect on the secondary pathophysiological changes after SAH has not been investigated. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that SAH-induced microthrombosis plays important roles in the pathogenesis of delayed cerebral ischemia. To date, however, no study focused on the treatment of microthrombosis in SAH models. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of simvastatin on microthrombi formation after SAH in rats. Adult male SD rats were divided into four groups: (1) control group (n = 6); (2) SAH group (n = 6); (3) SAH+vehicle group (n = 6) and (4) SAH+simvastatin group (n = 6). SAH was induced by injecting 0.3 ml of fresh arterial, non-heparinized blood into the prechiasmatic cistern in 20 sec with a syringe pump. In the SAH+simvastatin group, simvastatin was administered ip at a dose of 20 mg/kg/d after SAH. Brain samples were excised after perfusion fixation at 7 days after SAH. The cross-sectional areas of the middle cerebral artery and anterior cerebral artery were measured. Microclots were evaluated by H&E staining. Microthrombi formation was measured by fibrin(ogen) immunostaining. The results showed that administration of simvastatin prevented vasospasm on day 7 following SAH (p <0.01). The number of microthrombi was significantly increased in both cerebral cortex and cerebellar cortex at 7 days after SAH (p <0.01). Simvastatin treatment down-regulated the formation of microclots in this SAH model and the number of microthombi was decreased significantly in the SAH+simvastatin group compared to the SAH or SAH+vehicle groups (p <0.01). In conclusion, simvastatin administration attenuates cerebral vasospasm and alleviates microthrombosis in the late phase of SAH in this prechiasmatic blood injection model.",

    "175": "The study population included 18 809 patients from 41 countries enrolled in the Organization to Assess Strategies in Acute Ischemic Syndromes (OASIS) 5 randomized clinical trial. At the 30-day follow-up, patients reported adherence to diet, physical activity, and smoking cessation. Cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular death) and all-cause mortality were documented to 6 months. About one third of smokers persisted in smoking. Adherence to neither diet nor exercise recommendations was reported by 28.5%, adherence to either diet or exercise by 41.6%, and adherence to both by 29.9%. In contrast, 96.1% of subjects reported antiplatelet use, 78.9% reported statin use, and 72.4% reported angiotensin-converting enzyme/angiotensin receptor blocker use. Quitting smoking was associated with a decreased risk of myocardial infarction compared with persistent smoking (odds ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.89). Diet and exercise adherence was associated with a decreased risk of myocardial infarction compared with nonadherence (odds ratio, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.4 to 0.69). Patients who reported persistent smoking and nonadherence to diet and exercise had a 3.8-fold (95% confidence interval, 2.5 to 5.9) increased risk of myocardial infarction/stroke/death compared with never smokers who modified diet and exercise.",

    "177": "The proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2) expression is increased in endothelial cells derived from women with preeclampsia, characterized by widespread maternal endothelial damage, which occurs as a consequence of elevated soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (sVEGFR-1; commonly known as sFlt-1) in the maternal circulation. Because PAR-2 is upregulated by proinflammatory cytokines and activated by blood coagulation serine proteinases, we investigated whether activation of PAR-2 contributed to sVEGFR-1 release. PAR-2-activating peptides (SLIGRL-NH(2) and 2-furoyl-LIGRLO-NH(2)) and factor Xa increased the expression and release of sVEGFR-1 from human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Enzyme-specific, dominant-negative mutants and small interfering RNA were used to demonstrate that PAR-2-mediated sVEGFR-1 release depended on protein kinase C-beta(1) and protein kinase C-epsilon, which required intracellular transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor 1, leading to mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Overexpression of heme oxygenase 1 and its gaseous product, carbon monoxide, decreased PAR-2-stimulated sVEGFR-1 release from human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Simvastatin, which upregulates heme oxygenase 1, also suppressed PAR-2-mediated sVEGFR-1 release. These results show that endothelial PAR-2 activation leading to increased sVEGFR-1 release may contribute to the maternal vascular dysfunction observed in preeclampsia and highlights the PAR-2 pathway as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of preeclampsia.",

Patients with PAD often have extensive atherosclerotic disease elsewhere and have a 1-year mortality rate as high as 20%, mainly from cardiovascular events. This case discussion briefly addresses the evidence for treating hypercholesterolemia in this subgroup of patients. Statins not only lower cholesterol, but also are antiinflammatory, antiproliferative, and antithrombogenic, and improve endothelial function. Current guidelines are reviewed and an approach to initiation of statins and their management is discussed.",

Therefore, the objective of the present work was to prepare and characterize lipid nanoparticles that combined simvastatin and tocotrienol rich fraction (TRF) as potential anticancer therapy. The entrapment of simvastatin in the oily nanocompartments, which were formed by TRF inclusion into the solid matrix of the nanoparticles, was verified by its high entrapment efficiency and the absence of endothermic or crystalline peaks when blends were analyzed by DSC and PXRD, respectively. The release of simvastatin from the nanoparticles in sink conditions was characterized by an initial burst release of approximately 20% in 10h followed by a plateau. No significant change in particle size (approximately 100 nm) was observed after storage for six months. The anticancer activity of the nanoparticles was verified in vitro by observing their antiproliferative effects on malignant +SA mammary epithelial cells. The IC(50) of the reference alpha-tocopherol nanoparticles was 17.7 microM whereas the IC(50) of the simvastatin/TRF nanoparticles was 0.52 microM, which confirmed the potency of the combined treatment and its potential in cancer therapy.",

Lipid peroxidation and oxidative damage to glycids, proteins and nucleic acids are the main consequences of OS and are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Vitamin E and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) represent the main antioxidant systems in human cells. Selenium (Se), bound to the active sites of GSH-Pxs, plays a critical role in this antioxidant defence system. Statins are widely used and extensively investigated in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, notably in high-risk subjects. Several studies show antioxidant effects of statins not related to their lipid-lowering action. Our study aimed to compare serum Se concentration in ESRD patients on maintenance HD and in homogeneous healthy subjects and to investigate whether chronic treatment with statins may interfere with serum Se concentration in HD patients.",

International Nonproprietary Name (INN) prescribing of omeprazole reached 98% of all omeprazole by 2007. The measures also resulted in limited utilization of esomeprazole and lowered reimbursed expenditure/DDD of generic omeprazole to GB pound0.13 by 2007. This was 87% below 2004 originator prices, leading to a 41% fall in PPI expenditure during the study period despite increased utilization. Utilization of statins grew by over 130% during the study period enhanced by increased utilization of high doses of simvastatin and atorvastatin following the introduction of the quality and outcomes framework. Simvastatin dominated statin utilization by 2007, with generic simvastatin accounting for over 99.5% of total simvastatin. Reimbursed expenditure/DDD for generic simvastatin was pound0.03 in 2007, 95% below 2004 originator prices, leading to a fall in overall expenditure on statins. It proved difficult to undertake an impact analysis as, typically, a range of measures were introduced sequentially and simultaneously during the study period.",

This includes a high rate of INN prescribing, low reimbursed prices for generic simvastatin and omeprazole and growing utilization of higher strength statins. The high rate of INN prescribing reduces the need for additional measures that have been instigated in other European countries to further enhance the prescribing and dispensing of generics to fully realize the resource benefits.

The following cases involve two patients with treatment-refractory alopecias that benefited significantly after treatment with a combination of ezetimibe and simvastatin, in addition to the continuation of intra-lesional corticosteroid injections. In this report, the known immunomodulatory effects of statins in combination with ezetimibe are discussed along with the known histopathologic findings of autoimmune alopecia.

    "209": "Left atrial myocardium from patients with AF showed a marked up-regulation of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) expression compared with sinus rhythm patients. This was associated with increased fibrosis, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase, Rac1 and RhoA activity, up-regulation of N-cadherin and connexin 43 (Cx43) expression, and increased angiotensin II tissue concentration. In neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts, a specific small molecule inhibitor of Rac1 or simvastatin completely prevented the angiotensin II-induced up-regulation of CTGF, Cx43, and N-cadherin expression. Transfection with small-inhibiting CTGF ribonucleic acid blocked Cx43 and N-cadherin expression. RacET mice showed up-regulation of CTGF, Cx43, and N-cadherin protein expression. Inhibition of Rac1 by oral statin treatment prevented these effects, identifying Rac1 as a key regulator of CTGF in vivo.", 
    "210": "The data identify CTGF as an important mediator of atrial structural remodeling during AF. Angiotensin II activates CTGF via activation of Rac1 and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase, leading to up-regulation of Cx43, N-cadherin, and interstitial fibrosis and therefore contributing to the signal transduction of atrial structural remodeling.", 
    "211": "Hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors, statins, reduce plasma cholesterol and, as a consequence, decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Data from a subgroup analysis of the 4-S Study, however, indicate that patients with high cholesterol absorption may not benefit from statin treatment. Furthermore, there is accumulating evidence that lower hepatic synthesis and higher intestinal absorption markers are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Therefore, prospective clinical trials are needed to evaluate whether subjects with altered cholesterol homeostasis may benefit from treatment strategies that reduce cholesterol absorption in addition to statin treatment.",

Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers and statins improve vascular endothelium function. The effects of olmesartan and pravastatin were investigated on the development of experimental aneurysms in rats. Eighty-three rats underwent aneurysm induction. Seven groups of 10-14 rats were treated with low or high dose olmesartan, low or high dose pravastatin, low doses of olmesartan and pravastatin, hydralazine, or no drug (control) for 12weeks, when rats were sacrificed for vascular corrosion casting and scanning electron microscopy. Aneurysmal changes at the anterior cerebral-olfactory artery bifurcation were divided into stages 0 (no abnormality) to III (saccular aneurysm). Systolic arterial blood pressure was elevated over 170mmHg in the control, low dose pravastatin, and high dose pravastatin groups, but not in the other groups. The control group demonstrated aneurysmal changes in 100% and stage III in 50% of rats. Aneurysmal changes were observed in most rats in the other groups, but the incidence of stage III was 10% or less. The staging pattern showed significant differences between the groups (P=0.028).

The rats in group I (n=10) and group II (n=9) were given 2.5 mg/kg/day intraperitoneal and oral atorvastatin, respectively, for 28 days. Group III (n=9) was given no medication (control). The mean volume and weight of explants in group I were significantly lower (both P < 0.05) compared with group III. Histopathological score of the implants was significantly lower in groups I and II, when compared with group III (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). There were significant reductions in explant concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase 9 in group I (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively) and group II (both P < 0.01) compared with group III while staining due to tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 was significantly higher in group I (P < 0.01) and group II (P < 0.01) compared with group III. Moreover, explant concentration of superoxide dismutase was significantly increased in groups I and II compared with group III (both P < 0.05). In conclusion, atorvastatin causes significant regression of endometriotic implants in rats. Moreover, intraperitoneal atorvastatin seems to be more effective than oral atorvastatin.", 
    "214": "Simvastatin (SS) is an effective cholesterol-lowering medicine, and is hydrolyzed to simvastatin acid (SSA) after oral administration. Due to SS and SSA inter-conversion and its pH and temperature dependence, SS and SSA quantitation is analytically challenging. Here we report a high-throughput salting-out assisted liquid/liquid extraction (SALLE) method with acetonitrile and mass spectrometry compatible salts for simultaneous LC-MS/MS analysis of SS and SSA. The sample preparation of a 96-well plate using SALLE was completed within 20 min, and the SALLE extract was diluted and injected into an LC-MS/MS system with a cycle time of 2.0 min/sample. The seamless interface of SALLE and LC-MS eliminated drying down step and thus potential sample exposure to room or higher temperature. The stability of SS and SSA in various concentration ratios in plasma was evaluated at room and low (4 degrees C) temperature and the low temperature (4 degrees C) was found necessary to maintain sample integrity. The short sample preparation time along with controlled temperature (2-4 degrees C) and acidity (pH 4.5) throughout sample preparation minimized the conversion of SS-->SSA to < or = 0.10% and the conversion of SSA-->SS to 0.00% The method was validated with a lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 0.094 ng mL(-1) for both SS and SSA and a sample volume of 100 microL. The method was used for a bioequivalence study with 4048 samples.

    "215": "In order to develop a safety biomarker for atorvastatin, this drug was orally administrated to hyperlipidemic rats, and a metabolomic study was performed. Atorvastatin was given in doses of either 70 mg kg(-1) day(-1) or 250 mg kg(-1) day(-1) for a period of 7 days (n=4 for each group). To evaluate any abnormal effects of the drug, physiological and plasma biochemical parameters were measured and histopathological tests were carried out. Safety biomarkers were derived by comparing these parameters and using both global and targeted metabolic profiling. Global metabolic profiling was performed using liquid chromatography/time of flight/mass spectrometry (LC/TOF/MS) with multivariate data analysis. Several safety biomarker candidates that included various steroids and amino acids were discovered as a result of global metabolic profiling, and they were also confirmed by targeted metabolic profiling using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and capillary electrophoresis/mass spectrometry (CE/MS). Serum biochemical and histopathological tests were used to detect abnormal drug reactions in the liver after repeating oral administration of atorvastatin. The metabolic differences between control and the drug-treated groups were compared using PLS-DA score plots. These results were compared with the physiological and plasma biochemical parameters and the results of a histopathological test. Estrone, cortisone, proline, cystine, 3-ureidopropionic acid and histidine were proposed as potential safety biomarkers related with the liver toxicity of atorvastatin.

    "217": "Sepsis is a common intensive care unit event occurring in approximately 750 000 patients annually, with a case mortality rate approaching 50%. Sepsis is characterized by a chaotic and excessive release of inflammatory cytokines and procoagulants including tumor necrosis factor, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, platelet-activating factor, and tissue factor. Efforts to inhibit individual cytokines in order to modify poor outcomes have been generally disappointing, suggesting the need to target multiple inflammatory mediators to obtain clinical benefit. Statins lower lipids by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, which in turn inhibits the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. In addition to lowering total cholesterol, statins have pleiotropic effects on inflammation and immunity. Instead of impacting a single entity in the sepsis syndrome, statins may have positive effects on multiple inflammatory, immunomodulating, and coagulation targets involved in the development of infection and sepsis. There have been a number of institutional- and population-based studies that have evaluated the impact of statins in patients with infection and sepsis. Most of these studies, but not all, have demonstrated a number of positive outcomes in patients with statins, including reduction in mortality. Based on these data, statins are a promising therapy in the management of patients with sepsis and warrant larger and more rigorous clinical trials.",

The Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) trial included patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack and no known CHD regardless of the presence of carotid atherosclerosis. We evaluated the risk of developing clinically recognized CHD in SPARCL patients.", 
    "226": "A total of 4731 patients (mean age, 63 years) was randomized to 80 mg/day atorvastatin placebo. The rates of major coronary event, any CHD event, and any revascularization procedure were evaluated.", 
    "227": "After 4.9 years of follow-up, the risks of a major coronary event and of any CHD end point in the placebo group were 5.1% and 8.6%, respectively. The rate of outcome of stroke decreased over time, whereas the major coronary event rate was stable. Relative to those having a large vessel-related stroke at baseline, those having a transient ischemic attack, hemorrhagic stroke, small vessel stroke, or a stroke of unknown cause had similar absolute rates for a first major coronary event and for any CHD event; transient ischemic attack, small vessel, and unknown cause groups had lower absolute revascularization procedure rates. Major coronary event, any CHD event, and any revascularization procedure rates were similarly reduced in all baseline stroke subtypes in the atorvastatin arm compared with placebo with no heterogeneity between groups.", 
    "228": "CHD risk can be substantially reduced by atorvastatin therapy in patients with recent stroke or transient ischemic attack regardless of stroke subtype.", 
    "229": "Preclinical information on the biliary metabolites of a drug candidate is typically obtained through the collection of bile after surgical cannulation of the bile duct. In this study, we describe a novel approach using the Entero-Test, a simple device that facilitates the noninvasive sampling of duodenal bile. The Entero-Test was used to collect bile from six fasted dogs that had been dosed either orally with simvastatin (SV) or intravenously with simvastatin hydroxy acid (SVA), compounds that have been previously reported to undergo extensive metabolism and biliary secretion in the dog. The devices, consisting of a weighted gelatin capsule containing 90 cm of a highly absorbent nylon string, were swallowed by each dog with the proximal end of the string taped to the animal's face. Once the weighted string had reached the duodenum, gallbladder contraction was stimulated to release bile. Each bile-stained string was then retrieved via the mouth and, after solvent extraction, samples were analyzed for drug-related material by ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. Numerous metabolites of SV and SVA were observed, and, in general, the major metabolites have been reported previously from studies with bile duct-cannulated animals dosed with [14C]SV or [14C]SVA. The results from this study demonstrate the utility of deploying the Entero-Test in absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination studies to provide information on the nature of biliary metabolites, which, on occasion, may be sufficient to negate the need for more invasive sampling techniques. The benefits and limitations of the technique are discussed.", 
    "230": "Escalating costs of pharmaceuticals for cardiovascular management highlight the need to develop effective lifestyle intervention programs to reduce reliance on these agents. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the efficacy of a Comprehensive Lifestyle Intervention Program (CLIP) compared with qualitative lifestyle advice (L) and Simvastatin plus qualitative lifestyle (S+L) on cardiovascular risk factors.", 
    "231": "Sixty-five overweight adults with hypercholesterolemia were randomised to either L (qualitative advice on diet, exercise), S+L (20 mg/day Simvastatin plus L) or CLIP (6500 kJ structured menu plan: conventional and functional foods contributing <10% energy from saturated fat, \u22653 g soluble fibre, 2.4 g plant sterols, oily fish \u22652 times/week at lunch and dinner, plus exercise advice and self monitoring) for 6 weeks. LDL-cholesterol was lowered in CLIP (-0.57\u00b10.67 mmol/L, 15%) and S+L (-1.43\u00b10.59 mmol/L, 37%), but did not change significantly in L (-0.17\u00b10.59, 4%) (P<0.001 time-by-treatment interaction). Weight and waist circumference were significantly lowered by CLIP (-4.2\u00b12.2 kg; -5.1\u00b12.3 cm) compared to L (-1.0\u00b11.6 kg; -2.7\u00b13.3 cm) and L+S (-0.7\u00b11.4 kg; -2.4\u00b12.3 cm), (P\u22640.003 time-by-treatment interactions). B-carotene levels within treatment groups did not change over time and were not lowered by the CLIP diet compared to L (P>0.05, all). Blood pressure changes were not different between groups.", 
    "232": "The structured CLIP program was more effective than qualitative lifestyle advice in improving weight, waist circumference and LDL-cholesterol without adverse effects on plasma carotenoids over a 6 week period. This program may therefore assist in comprehensive risk factor management, although the sustainability of these benefits needs confirmation.", 
    "233": "Although hyperlipidemia is well recognized as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), there has been no appraisal of the economic impact of statin therapy in Korea.", 
    "234": "The aim of this model analysis was to determine the cost-effectiveness of statin therapy versus no treatment for the primary prevention of CVD over a lifetime in Korea, from a health care system perspective.", 
    "235": "We developed the Korean Individual-Microsimulation Model for Cardiovascular Health Interventions (KIMCHI), an epidemiologic and economic Markov model of first-onset CVD in Korea in which all individuals began the simulation in the health state alive without CVD, and moved among the 4 health states (alive without CVD, alive with CVD, dead from CVD, and dead from non-CVD causes) in yearly cycles for any specified time horizon, up to 40 years. KIMCHI was populated with 372 subjects from the 2005 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHNES) who were aged > or =45 years, did not have a history of myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke, and met current Korean reimbursement criteria for treatment with lipid-lowering medications. The probability of first-onset CVD was estimated for each study participant individually, based on an Asian population-specific risk equation that relied on an individual's sex, age, serum total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, current smoking status, diabetes mellitus status, and body mass index. Statin treatment was represented by a hybrid of atorvastatin and simvastatin (the most popular statins in Korea), the lipid-modifying effects of which were de rived from a published meta-analysis. Data regarding utilities and costs of CVD (both those covered and not covered by insurance) were derived from published local sources.", 
    "236": "In the base case, the estimated incremental costutility ratio was 15,134,284 Korean won (KRW) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, and the estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 20,657,829 KRW per life-year gained (LYG) (1200 KRW approximately US $1). Based on a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 30 million KRW per QALY saved, there was a 93.7% probability that statin therapy would be cost-effective. Given a WTP threshold of 20 million KRW per QALY, there was a 53.8% probability of being cost-effective. The probabilities at WTP thresholds of 30 and 20 million KRW per LYG were 62.4% and 25.8%, respectively.", 
    "237": "Based on this analysis using data from the 2005 KNHNES and the KIMCHI model, statin therapy is likely to be cost-effective for the primary prevention of CVD among Koreans aged > or =45 years. The probability of being cost-effective was greater at a threshold of 30 million KRW per QALY (93.7%) than at 20 million KRW per QALY (53.8%).", 
    "238": "Drug-induced fever is a clinical diagnosis and should always be considered when the fever is constant and high without a clear source of infection. Although drug-induced fever has been reported with other centrally acting antihypertensive drugs such as methyldopa, published reports of this adverse effect with clonidine in humans were not identified in a search of the literature.", 
    "239": "A 66-year-old institutionalized white female with a history of morbid obesity (body mass index, 40 kg/m2), Alzheimer's dementia, hypertension, and depression presented to a hospital in Boston, Massachusetts (Caritas Saint Elizabeth's Medical Center) with generalized weakness and shortness of breath and was found to have a non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. Before hospitalization, the patient was taking memantine 10 mg PO BID, donepezil 10 mg PO once daily, duloxetine 60 mg PO once daily, clonidine 0.1 mg PO TID, metoprolol 50 mg PO BID, and amlodipine 10 mg PO once daily. On admission, the patient was initiated on aspirin 325 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, and clopidogrel 75 mg PO daily. Her dose of clonidine was increased to 0.2 mg PO TID to optimize blood pressure control, and metoprolol and amlodipine were continued at the same doses. The patient developed fever on the third day after the cardiac catheterization. The fever ranged from 99.0 degrees F to 102.7 degrees F. The physical examination, laboratory data analysis, multiple blood cultures, urinalysis, chest radiograph, and a computed tomography of the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis did not reveal any source of infection. On the sixth day after admission, clonidine was reduced to the baseline dose of 0.1 mg PO TID and on the ninth day it was stopped. The patient was afebrile on the twelfth day and remained so for the duration of her hospitalization. Naranjo scores for her newly initiated concomitant medications were as follows: aspirin, 1; atorvastatin, 3; clonidine, 6; and clopidogrel, 1. The rating of 6 for clonidine suggests that it was probably associated with the fever in this patient.", 
    "240": "We describe a case of drug-induced fever probably associated with clonidine administration. The higher dose of clonidine alone or in interaction with duloxetine and atorvastatin may have contributed to the development of drug-induced fever.",

    "243": "This was a 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group Phase IIb study. Adults with dyslipidemia (non-HDL-C >130 mg/dL and triglycerides [TG] > or =150 but < or =500 mg/dL) were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive the FDC, atorvastatin 40 mg, or fenofibrate 145 mg for 12 weeks. Study medication was taken once daily in the evening, without regard to meals. Patients attended follow-up visits after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of the double-blind treatment. The primary efficacy end points were the mean percentage changes from baseline to the final visit (week 12) in non-HDL-C, HDL-C, and TG. Secondary variables were LDL-C, VLDL-C particle concentration, total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, lipoprotein (a), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, homocysteine, creatinine, myeloperoxidase, and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2. Tolerability was assessed by adverse events, laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical examinations, and ECGs.", 
    "244": "Patients (n = 220) were aged 26 to 87 years; 115 (52.3%) were men and 105 (47.7%) were women; 189 (85.9%) were white, 17 (7.7%) were black, and 15 (6.8%) were Hispanic or Latino; and mean (SD) weight was 200.5 (40.85) lb (range, 103.5-367.4 lb). Previous treatments were statins (25.9% [57/220]), fibrates (1.8% [4/220]), and dietary supplements (25.5% [56/220]); 57.7% (127/220) of patients were treatment naive. Use of the FDC was associated with an improvement in non-HDL-C (-44.8%) that was significantly greater than with fenofibrate monotherapy (-16.1%; P < 0.001) but was not significantly different from that with atorvastatin monotherapy (-40.2%; P = NS). HDL-C increased significantly more in the FDC group (19.7%) than with atorvastatin (6.5%; P < 0.001) but was not significantly different from fenofibrate (18.2%; P = NS). TG lowering in the FDC group (-49.1%) was significantly greater than with both atorvastatin (-28.9%; P < 0.001) and fenofibrate (-27.8%; P = 0.001). LDL-C lowering in the FDC group (-42.3%) was significantly greater than with fenofibrate (-13.9%; P < 0.001) but not significantly different from atorvastatin (-43.1%; P = NS). The FDC had either comparable or significantly greater improvements in other lipid variables and multiple secondary variables. The FDC was generally well tolerated; the tolerability profile was consistent with those of atorvastatin and fenofibrate monotherapies. Treatment-emergent adverse events (ie, those occurring after the first dose of study medication) were recorded in 43 of 73 patients (58.9%) for the FDC, 49 of 74 (66.2%) for atorvastatin, and 48 of 73 (65.8%) for fenofibrate.", 
    "245": "In this 12-week study, patients with dyslipidemia treated with the 40/100-mg atorvastatin/ fenofibrate FDC had a significantly greater reduction in TG than those treated with atorvastatin 40 mg or higher-dose fenofibrate 145 mg. Treatment with the FDC was also associated with a significantly greater reduction in non-HDL-C compared with fenofibrate alone and a greater increase in HDL-C compared with atorvastatin alone. All treatments were generally well tolerated.", 
    "246": "A micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography method was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of ezetimibe and simvastatin in pharmaceutical preparations. The influence of buffer concentration, buffer pH, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) concentration, organic modifier, capillary temperature, applied voltage, and injection time was investigated, and the method validation studies were performed. The optimum separation for these analytes was achieved in less than 10 min at 30 degrees C with a fused-silica capillary column (56 cm x 50 microm i.d.) and a 25mM borate buffer at pH 9.0 containing 25mM SDS and 10% (v/v) acetonitrile. The samples were injected hydrodynamically for 3 s at 50 mbar, and the applied voltage was +30.0 kV. Detection wavelength was set at 238 nm. Diflunisal was used as internal standard. The method was suitably validated with respect to stability, specificity, linearity, limits of detection and quantification, accuracy, precision, and robustness. The limits of detection and quantification were 1.0 and 2.0 microg/mL for both ezetimibe and simvastatin, respectively. The method developed was successfully applied to the simultaneous determination of ezetimibe and simvastatin in pharmaceutical preparations."
