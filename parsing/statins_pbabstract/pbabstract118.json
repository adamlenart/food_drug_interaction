Medical records of 171,885 patients were used in this study, and 40,001 (23.3%) of the patients received statin therapy (\u2265 28 cDDDs). Risk of new-onset atrial fibrillation in statin users and non-users (<28 cDDDs) was estimated.", 
    "2": "During the 9-year follow-up period, 6049 patients experienced new-onset atrial fibrillation. Overall, statin therapy reduced the risk of atrial fibrillation by 28% (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.72; 95% CI 0.68 to 0.77). There was a dose-response relationship between statin use and the risk of atrial fibrillation. The adjusted HRs for atrial fibrillation were 1.04, 0.85, and 0.50 when cDDDs ranged from 28 to 90, 91 to 365, and more than 365, respectively. Subgroup analysis showed that statin use was more beneficial in patients with higher CHADS2 and CHA2DS2VASc scores than those with a score of 0 (P value for interaction<0.001). The therapy provided no obvious beneficial effect in those with a CHADS2 score of 0, a CHA2DS2VASc score of 0, or cDDDs less than 91.",

    "4": "Many different calibration approaches are used for linear calibration in LC-MS bioanalysis, such as different numbers of concentration levels and replicates. However, direct comparison of these approaches is rare, particularly using experimental results. The purpose of this research is to compare different linear calibration approaches (existing and new ones) through simulations and experiments. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate that linear calibration using two concentrations (two true concentrations, not forced through zero) is as good as or even better than that using multiple concentrations (e.g. 8 or 10) in terms of accuracy. Additionally, two-concentration calibration not only significantly saves time and cost, but is also more robust. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the extrapolation of a linear curve at the high concentration end to a linearity-known region is acceptable. When multi-concentration calibration is used, the difference between the two commonly used approaches, i.e. singlet (one curve) or duplicate (two curves) standards per concentration level is small when a method is very precise. Otherwise, one curve approach can result in larger variation at the low concentration end and higher batch failure rate. To reduce the variation and unnecessary reassays due to batch failure or possible rejection of the lowest and/or highest calibration standards, a partially duplicate-standard approach is proposed, which has duplicate-standard-like performance but still saves time and cost as singlet-standard approach does. Finally, the maximum allowable degrees of quadratic (non-linear) response in linear calibration are determined for different scenarios. Because of its multiple advantages and potential application in regulated bioanalysis, recommendations as how to implement two-concentration linear calibration in practice are given and some typical \"concerns\" regarding linear calibration using only two concentrations are addressed, e.g. how does one know if the response is truly linear over a given range when only two concentrations are used?.",

The Ductal Lavage (DL) procedure offers a minimally invasive method to obtain breast epithelial cells from the ductal system for cytopathologic analysis. Several studies with long-term follow-up have shown that women with atypical hyperplasia have an elevated risk of developing breast cancer. The objective of the proposed trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of a daily administration of nimesulide or simvastatin in women at higher risk for breast cancer, focused particularly on hormone non-responsive tumor risk. The primary endpoint is the change in prevalence of atypical cells and cell proliferation (measured by Ki67) in DL or fine needle aspirate samples, after 12 months of treatment and 12 months after treatment cessation. METHODS-DESIGN: From 2005 to 2011, 150 women with a history of estrogen receptor negative ductal intraepithelial neoplasia or lobular intraepithelial neoplasia or atypical hyperplasia, or unaffected subjects carrying a mutation of BRCA1 or with a probability of mutation >10% (according to BRCAPRO) were randomized to receive nimesulide 100mg/day versus simvastatin 20mg/day versus placebo for one year followed by a second year of follow-up.",

    "20": "Prompt identification and management of patients with peripheral arterial disease can improve quality of life, save limbs and reduce cardiovascular events. The most common initial symptom is leg pain on exertion or intermittent claudication. More severe or critical limb ischaemia can present with pain at rest, ulceration, tissue loss and/or gangrene, In most patients the symptoms remain stable, but approximately 20% will develop limb threatening critical ischaemia. The incidence of peripheral arterial disease increases with age and up to 20% of people aged over 60 are affected to some degree. The incidence is also high in smokers, diabetes patients, and those with coronary disease. A focused history should identify the presence and severity of intermittent claudication and any critical limb ischaemia. Examination should concentrate on the palpation of lower limb arterial pulses and look for signs of critical ischaemia such as ulceration. The key primary care investigation in suspected peripheral arterial disease is measurement of the ankle brachial pressure index. Lifestyle interventions are a key component of management. NICE recommends that a supervised exercise programme is offered to all patients with intermittent claudication. Pharmacological therapy should always include an antiplatelet agent and statin. Vasoactive drugs such as naftidrofuryl oxalate should be considered for symptom control in intermittent claudication when exercise has not led to a satisfactory improvement and the patient prefers not to be referred for revascularisation. Patients with severe and inadequately controlled symptoms should be referred to secondary care with a view to further imaging to assess the appropriateness of revascularisation.", 
    "21": "Forty years after Singer and Nicolson (1972) announced the fluid mosaic membrane model a number of new facts caused updating of their historic view. Plasma membrane is not uniform in state of matter, i.e. fluid portion is represented by glycerophospholipids spontaneously mounted into lipid bilayer in disordered manner (Ld - liquid disordered). In such membrane numerous nanodomains (millions in single cell) known as lipid rafts (TL) and caveolae contain sphingolipids and cholesterol as well as lipid modified integral membrane proteins. Nanodomains are more rigid, denser portion of plasma membrane (Lo - liquid ordered). Nanodomains are buoyant in fluid portion of membrane and have tendency to coalesce into larger platforms to form signalosomes essential for signal transduction. TL constitutively express certain proteins (alpha subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, secretases, caveolins, flotillin). There are other proteins found in TL after additional lipid modifications (palmitoylation, myristoylation). With regard to dementia, retrospective studies carried out in human beings point to cholesterol and TL as crucial factors in etiopathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Chronic administration of statins to patients significantly reduced the incidence of AD.

The present review is aimed to discuss the potential mechanisms of statins leading to occurrence of glucose metabolism disturbances through the influence on insulin secretion by the beta-cells of pancreatic islets and the cells' sensitivity on insulin. It might be a results of disadvantageous statin properties connected to the intensification of inflammation and oxidation within the pancreatic islets, and the influence on adipokines secretion by the fat tissue cells. However, it should be emphasized that despite the recommendations of US Food and Drug Administration suggesting to keep caution in connection to potentially prodiabetic statins' properties, this data need to be confirmed in large multicenter clinical trials with properly designed main endpoints.", 
    "23": "This comparative ultrasound study included 210 patients aged 65-80 years with non-valvular atrial fibrillation treated with the use of 4 different therapeutic modalities. Intake of perindopril, valsartan, valsartan + rozuvastatin, and lercanidipine resulted in a rise in distension index of common carotid artery, decrease of rigidity coefficient of the aortic wall and increase of the pulsed wave propagation speed. Combination of valsartan (80-160 mg/d) and rozuvastatin (10 mg/d) had the most pronounced effect on the vascular wall compliance compared with other modalities and reduced the frequency of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and mortality. It is concluded that therapy of non-valvular atrial fibrillation in elderly patients with valsartan + rozuvaststin is the optimal strategy for the improvement of elastic properties of the vascular wall and reduction of the frequency of cardiovascular complications.",

Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured in the lumbar spine region (LII-LIV) and femoral neck by DEXA. Simultaneously the lipid profile and serum bone metabolism markers (osteocalcin, beta-CrossLaps CL) were detected. Simvastatin therapy led to normalization of osteocalcin level (p<0.01) within 6 months. In the control group, it remained unaltered and tended to decrease after 12 months (p>0.05). The level of bone resorption marker (CL) dropped within 3 months after the onset of therapy (p<0.050) and continued to decrease by the 12th month (p<0.05). It was significantly lower than in controls (p<0.05) both after 6 and 12 months. BMD in the femoral neck and LII-LIV increased by 2.2 and 2.6% respectively after 12 months of simvastatin therapy and by 1.4 and 1.7% after consumption of low-fat diet.

    "27": "Albuminuria has been shown to be associated with mortality and cardiovascular events, independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. This suggests that albuminuria may not just represent glomerular damage, but may be a marker of more diffuse endothelial dysfunction. We investigated the relationship between urinary albumin levels after an acute coronary syndrome and cardiovascular outcomes in statin treated subjects after acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Furthermore we assessed the effect of intensive statin treatment on albuminuria among patients in the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 trial, in which patients who had been hospitalized with ACS were randomized to pravastatin 40\u00a0mg (standard therapy) or atorvastatin 80\u00a0mg daily (intensive therapy). In univariate analyses, increasing urine albumin concentration was associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and composite of death, myocardial infarction and stroke at 2 years. However, in a multivariable model containing traditional cardiovascular risk factors, albuminuria was not an independent predictor of the primary PROVE IT endpoint of death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, revascularization and stroke, and was only an independent predictor of all-cause mortality at urinary albumin concentration >300\u00a0mcg/ml. There was no significant change in urinary albumin concentration from enrolment to end of study in either the standard or intensive statin therapy groups, and no significant difference between treatment groups. Our results suggest that after an acute coronary syndrome in statin treated patients, microalbuminuria may reflect traditional cardiovascular risk factor burden and offer little prognostic information independent of those factors.",

This study is the first report on the preventive effects of fluvastatin in experimental breast cancer in vivo. In this experiment, the antineoplastic effects of fluvastatin in the chemoprevention of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mammary carcinogenesis in female rats were evaluated. The effects of fluvastatin on selected parameters of apoptosis, proliferation, and angiogenesis in mammary tumor cells were determined. The drug was dietary administered at two concentrations of 20 and 200 mg/kg. The experiment was terminated 17 weeks after carcinogen administration; mammary tumors were removed and prepared for histomorphological and immunohistochemical analysis. The basic parameters of experimental carcinogenesis, chosen metabolic variables, and side effects after long-term fluvastatin treatment in animals were assessed. Fluvastatin at higher concentrations suppressed tumor frequency by 63% and tumor incidence by 33% in comparison with the controls. After fluvastatin treatment, immunohistochemical analysis of tumor cells showed a decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 expression by 86% and an increase in caspase-3 by 8.5%. Fluvastatin in both treated groups significantly increased the parameters of serum lipid metabolism and significantly decreased femur compact bone thickness and body weight in animals.

Our study aims to investigate the effects of different doses of rosuvastatin (Ro) on experimental bile duct ligation-induced cholestasis. 40 female Wistar rats were randomly divided into 4 groups (n=10): Sham group (laparotomy); BDL group (subjected to bile duct ligation); BDL group treated with Ro (5 mg/bw daily); BDL group treated with Ro (10 mg/bw daily). After 6 days of treatment, in the day 7 after BDL, the animals were sacrificed and we explored hepato-cytolysis, the seric parameters for cholestasis and oxidative stress in plasma, liver, brain and kidneys. Proliferation was investigated by expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), while inflammation by liver histology, TNFR2 expression and NF-\u03baB induction and activation. To assess fibrosis, we performed Tricrom-Masson staining, transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-\u03b21) expression, and for myofibroblast activation, we analyzed \u03b1-SMA expression. The administration of Ro in early stages of cholestasis proved to have a beneficial effect by decreasing \u03b1-SMA. Ro didn't exert systemic oxidative stress effects, but increased hepatocytolysis, oxidative stress and inflammation in the liver and sustained increased levels of pro-fibrotic cytokine TGF-\u03b21 as well as the number of proliferating cells in ducts and parenchyma. Ro inhibited the induction and the activation of NF-\u03baB, which could be considered a beneficial effect. Further studies must be carried out in order to clearly investigate the balance between risks and benefits for Ro administration in early stages of cholestasis.",

    "42": "Salvia miltiorrhiza has been widely used in the treatment of coronary heart disease. Tanshinones, a group of diterpenoids are the main active ingredients in S. miltiorrhiza. Two biosynthetic pathways were involved in tanshinone biosynthesis in plants: the mevalonate (MVA) pathway in the cytosol and the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway in the plastids. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) is the rate-limiting enzyme of the MVA pathway. The 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) are the key enzymes of the MEP pathway. In this study, to reveal roles of the MVA and the MEP pathways in cell growth and tanshinone production of S. miltiorrhiza hairy roots, specific inhibitors of the two pathways were used to perturb metabolic flux. The results showed that the MVA pathway inhibitor (mevinolin, MEV) was more powerful to inhibit the hairy root growth than the MEP pathway inhibitor (fosmidomycin, FOS). Both MEV and FOS could significantly inhibit tanshinone production, and FOS was more powerful than MEV. An inhibitor (D, L-glyceraldehyde, DLG) of IPP translocation strengthened the inhibitory effects of MEV and FOS on cell growth and tanshinone production. Application of MEV resulted in a significant increase of expression and activity of HMGR at 6 h, and a sharp decrease at 24 h. FOS treatment resulted in a significant increase of DXR and DXS expression and DXS activity at 6 h, and a sharp decrease at 24 h. Our results suggested that the MVA pathway played a major role in cell growth, while the MEP pathway was the main source of tanshinone biosynthesis. Both cell growth and tanshinone production could partially depend on the crosstalk between the two pathways. The inhibitor-mediated changes of tanshinone production were reflected in transcript and protein levels of genes of the MVA and MEP pathways.",

In order to explore the mechanism, we observed the effects of pravastatin on plaque stability in atherosclerotic rabbits. Sixteen male rabbits were fed with a high fat diet following their damaged abdominal aortic endothelium by using catheter. Eight of them were administered with pravastatin (10 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7d(-1)) for 4 weeks. Then the rabbit atherosclerotic plaque rupture and thrombosis were triggered by injection of viper venom and histamine. Compared with model group, the thrombus area on aorta in pravastatin-treated group was reduced. Fibre cap on plaque was more thick and integrant, and inflammatory cell infiltration was also decreased. Serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol and contents of cholesterol in abdominal aorta were decreased. 6-Keto-prostaglandin F(1\u03b1) (6-keto-PGF(1\u03b1)) level and ratio of 6-keto-PGF(1\u03b1)/thromboxane B(2) (TXB(2)) in aorta were significantly increased.

The aim of this study was to ascertain the differences in the rates of CAC progression, the effect of statin therapy, and all-cause mortality in subjects with and without DM. The study group consisted of 296 asymptomatic subjects with type 2 DM and 300 controls (mean age 59 \u00b1 6 years, 29% women) who underwent baseline and follow-up CAC scans within a 2-year interval. Absolute annual CAC score change, percentage annual CAC progression(\u0394CAC%), event-free survival, and the effect of statin therapy on survival were all assessed. The mean follow-up duration was 56 \u00b1 11 months. Absolute annual CAC score change was 81 \u00b1 10 in subjects with DM and 34 \u00b1 5 in controls (p = 0.0001). Percentage annual CAC progression was 29 \u00b1 9% in subjects with DM and 10 \u00b1 7% in controls (p = 0.0001). The hazard ratios of death in 3 groups of subjects with DM compared to controls without DM were 1.88 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.51 to 2.36, p = 0.0001) for \u0394CAC of 10% to 20%, 2.29 (95% CI 1.56 to 3.38, p = 0.0001) for \u0394CAC of 21% to 30%, and 6.95 (95% CI 2.23 to 11.53, p = 0.0001) for \u0394CAC >30%, all compared to \u0394CAC <10%. The adjusted hazard ratios of all-cause mortality in subjects receiving compared to those not receiving statin therapy were 0.29 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.56, p = 0.001) in those without DM and without CAC progression, 0.51 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.73, p = 0.001) in those with DM and without CAC progression, and 0.71 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.91, p = 0.003) in those without DM and with CAC progression, with all 3 groups compared to 1.0 (reference) in those with DM, with CAC progression and without statin therapy. In conclusion, CAC progression was greater and event-free survival lower in patients with DM compared to controls in proportion to the extent of CAC progression. These results suggest that CAC progression is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in patients with DM.", 
    "51": "Spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage is a debilitating form of stroke, often leading to death or permanent cognitive impairment. Many of the causative genes and the underlying mechanisms implicated in developmental cerebral-vascular malformations are unknown. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies in mice have shown inhibition of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) pathway to be effective in stabilizing cranial vessels. Using a combination of pharmacological and genetic approaches to specifically inhibit the HMGCR pathway in zebrafish (Danio rerio), we demonstrate a requirement for this metabolic pathway in developmental vascular stability. Here we report that inhibition of HMGCR function perturbs cerebral-vascular stability, resulting in progressive dilation of blood vessels, followed by vessel rupture, mimicking cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM)-like lesions in humans and murine models. The hemorrhages in the brain are rescued by prior exogenous supplementation with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), a 20-carbon metabolite of the HMGCR pathway, required for the membrane localization and activation of Rho GTPases. Consistent with this observation, morpholino-induced depletion of the \u03b2-subunit of geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTase I), an enzyme that facilitates the post-translational transfer of the GGPP moiety to the C-terminus of Rho family of GTPases, mimics the cerebral hemorrhaging induced by the pharmacological and genetic ablation of HMGCR. In embryos with cerebral hemorrhage, the endothelial-specific expression of cdc42, a Rho GTPase involved in the regulation of vascular permeability, was significantly reduced. Taken together, our data reveal a metabolic contribution to the stabilization of nascent cranial vessels, requiring protein geranylgeranylation acting downstream of the HMGCR pathway.",

    "60": "The reality of regression of atherosclerotic plaques was established as long ago as 1987 by aggressive cholesterol reduction even before the era of statin therapy. Nevertheless, the most important aspect of patient benefit to prevent cardiovascular (CV) disease events is stabilization of these plaques so they will not rupture. Lowering of low-density lipoproteins is critical to this goal and can be considered the gold standard of preventive CV medicine. The major goal for the high-risk patient and the diabetic patient is lowering these harmful lipoproteins to less than 70 mg/dL. No discussion of CV disease prevention is complete without considering tobacco abuse and its elimination. Even secondhand smoke has been established as harmful. Control of hypertension is another major aspect of CV disease prevention, and a blood pressure less than 120/80 mm Hg is ideal. With obesity a major problem in the developed world, its role in the metabolic syndrome is of major significance as is the high prevalence of this so-called syndrome versus collection of specific risk factors in a population with poor health habits. Control of diabetes mellitus has established benefit from the standpoint of CV disease prevention except that some problems have been reported with extremely tight blood sugar control. Exercise was long considered good but now there are evidence-based reasons to recommend it as essential in CV disease prevention. There are many unforeseen frontiers in CV disease prevention but, for now, everything points to elevation of high-density lipoproteins as the next focus of this prevention.",

No validation procedures have been introduced to verify the correct selection of the concentration-time (C-T) points used for the kel calculation. The purpose of this paper is to discover whether kel analysis can be subjected to the condensed validation procedure and what acceptance criteria should be adopted for such a procedure. For the analysis, data collected during bioequivalence studies of 4 drugs were selected, including 2 highly lipophilic drugs (itraconazole, atorvastatin) and 2 weakly lipophilic drugs (trimetazidine, perindopril). Pharmacokinetic calculations were performed with the use of WinNonlin Professional v 5.3. Internal validation of the kel analysis using leave-one-out cross-validation was performed. The present analysis proves that the C-T selection process for the kel calculations cannot be automated. In each of the analysed data series there were such C-T sequences that did not meet even one of the validation criteria. This paper proposes 3 validation criteria which need to be met in order to confirm the optimal selection of C-T data to calculate kel: Q 2\u22650.6, R2\u2265 0.85, Q 2-R2<0.3, were Q 2\u2009-\u2009squared cross-validated correlation coefficient, R2\u2009-\u2009coefficient of determination).

    "62": "It has been hypothesized in the literature that intake of high-dosage vitamin E supplements might alter the expression of cytochrome P(450) enzymes (CYP), particularly CYP3A4, which may lead to adverse nutrient-drug interactions. Because previously published studies reported conflicting findings, we investigated the pharmacodynamics of the lipid-lowering drug atorvastatin (ATV), a CYP3A4 substrate, in response to high-dose \u03b1-tocopherol (\u03b1T) feeding and determined protein expression and activities of relevant CYP. Groups of ten female Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs were fed a control (5% fat) or a high-fat control diet (HFC; 21% fat, 0.15% cholesterol) or the HFC diet fortified with \u03b1T (250 mg/kg diet), ATV (300 mg/kg diet) or both ATV+\u03b1T for 6 weeks. Relative to control, HFC animals had increased serum cholesterol concentrations, which were significantly reduced by ATV. High-dose \u03b1T feeding in combination with ATV (ATV+\u03b1T), albeit not \u03b1T feeding alone (\u03b1T), significantly lowered serum cholesterol relative to HFC, but did not alter the cholesterol-lowering activity of the drug compared to the ATV treated guinea pigs. Protein expression of CYP3A4, CYP4F2, CYP20A1 and OATP C was similar in all groups. Accordingly, no differences in plasma concentrations of phase I metabolites of ATV were observed between the ATV and ATV+\u03b1T groups. In conclusion, feeding guinea pigs high-doses of \u03b1T for 6 weeks did neither alter the hepatic expression of CYP, nor the pharmacodynamics and metabolism of ATV. High-dose \u03b1T intake is thus unlikely to change the efficacy of drugs metabolized by CYP enzymes, particularly by CYP3A4.", 
    "63": "Monogenic diseases have a distinctive familial inheritance that follows Mendel's laws, showing patterns like dominant, recessive, or X-linked. There are > 7000 monogenic diseases curated in databases, and together they account for up to 10% of all illnesses encountered in the emergency room or clinic. Despite the rarity of individual monogenic conditions, mapping their causative genes and mutations is important for several reasons. First, knowing the causative gene and mutation could provide actionable information for genetic counselling. Sometimes, knowing the gene and mutation allows for early diagnosis in affected families, which is important if there is an evidence-based intervention. Second, the implication of a mutant gene as being causative for a clinical phenotype provides strong evidence of the importance of the gene product in a cellular or biochemical pathway. Discovery of new molecular pathways in families with rare diseases can serve as the first step toward developing rational therapies to help not only affected families, but also patients with less extreme, nongenetic forms of the same condition. For instance, the study of rare patients with familial hypercholesterolemia helped in developing statin drugs, initially as a treatment for familial hypercholesterolemia but now a widely used therapy to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and cardiovascular disease risk.",

Several reports have shown the therapeutic effects of simvastatin on bone formation with neovascularization. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that enhanced angiogenesis and osteogenesis by locally applied simvastatin promotes tendon-bone healing after ACL reconstruction. Rabbits received ACL reconstruction with hamstring tendon graft and were implanted with either simvastatin-conjugated gelatin hydrogel or gelatin hydrogel alone in their bone tunnels, and then bone regeneration and neovascularization at tendon-bone interface and biomechanical properties were assessed. Histological analysis at week 2 demonstrated that tendon-bone healing was significantly greater with angiogenesis and osteogenesis in the simvastatin-treated group than in the control group. Computed tomography at weeks 2 and 4 showed a significantly smaller tibial bone tunnel in the simvastatin-treated group. Biomechanical testing at week 2 demonstrated a significant increase in ultimate failure load in the simvastatin-treated group.

Some NF1 patients develop cardiovascular disease, which represents an underrecognized disease complication and contributes to excess morbidity and mortality. Specifically, NF1 patients develop arterial occlusion resulting in tissue ischemia and sudden death. Murine studies demonstrate that heterozygous inactivation of Nf1 (Nf1(+/-)) in bone marrow cells enhances neointima formation following arterial injury. Macrophages infiltrate Nf1(+/-) neointimas, and NF1 patients have increased circulating inflammatory monocytes in their peripheral blood. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that heterozygous inactivation of Nf1 in myeloid cells is sufficient for neointima formation. Specific ablation of a single copy of the Nf1 gene in myeloid cells alone mobilizes a discrete pro-inflammatory murine monocyte population via a cell autonomous and gene-dosage dependent mechanism. Furthermore, lineage-restricted heterozygous inactivation of Nf1 in myeloid cells is sufficient to reproduce the enhanced neointima formation observed in Nf1(+/-) mice when compared with wild-type controls, and homozygous inactivation of Nf1 in myeloid cells amplified the degree of arterial stenosis after arterial injury. Treatment of Nf1(+/-) mice with rosuvastatin, a stain with anti-inflammatory properties, significantly reduced neointima formation when compared with control. These studies identify neurofibromin-deficient myeloid cells as critical cellular effectors of Nf1(+/-) neointima formation and propose a potential therapeutic for NF1 cardiovascular disease.",

    "100": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common progressive hereditary kidney disease. In 85-90% of cases, ADPKD results from a mutation in the PKD1 gene, and the other 10-15% of the cases are accounted for by mutations in PKD2. PKD1 and PKD2 encode polycystin-1 and polycystin-2. Polycystin-1 may be a receptor that controls the channel activity of polycystin-2 as part of the polycystin signaling complex. ADPKD is characterized by the progressive development of fluid-filled cysts derived from renal tubular epithelial cells that gradually compress the parenchyma and compromise renal function. In recent years, considerable interest has developed in the primary cilia as a site of the proteins that are involved in renal cystogenesis. The pathological processes that facilitate cyst enlargement are hypothesized to result from two specific cellular abnormalities: (1) increased fluid secretion into the cyst lumen and (2) inappropriately increased cell division by the epithelium lining the cyst. Since there is no clinically approved specific or targeted therapy, current practice focuses on blood pressure control and statin therapy to reduce the cardiac mortality associated with chronic kidney disease. However, recent advances in our understanding of the pathways that govern renal cystogenesis have led to a number of intriguing possibilities in regard to therapeutic interventions. The purpose of this article is to review the pathogenesis of renal cyst formation and to review novel targets for the treatment of ADPKD.",

Uremia induced hypertriglyceridemia; increased levels of lipoprotein remnants and low high-density lipoprotein are the main features of cardiovascular risk factors. Also, elevated oxidative stress and inflammation are the main contributors of endothelial dysfunction. Even statin based interventional trials failed to improve mortality in dialysis patients, and different treatment options have been proved to be useful. We aimed to evaluate the effect of dialyzer type on uremia-associated dyslipidemia and endothelial dysfunction. In total 312 patients were enrolled. The initial and 6(th) month blood samples were obtained from the non-arteriovenous fistula arm on the day before the first hemodialysis session of the week. Flow mediated dilatation of the patients was measured from the same arm before obtaining the blood samples. Patients were on hemodialysis therapy for 76.43 \u00b1 52.7 months. According to their dialyzer type, there has been a statistically significant improvement noted in terms of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The flow mediated dilatation of the patients are measured as 4.3 \u00b1 0.5 and 4.4 \u00b1 0.4 in baseline measurements of the low flux and high flux groups, respectively. Sixth month values of the patients were measured as 4.34 \u00b1 0.4 and 4.62 \u00b1 0.6. The improvement in low flux groups was not statistically significant but in the high flux group the endothelial dysfunction was significantly improved. Our results show that high-flux dialyzers improved dyslipidemia and endothelial dysfunction in hemodialysis patients. These findings provide a new insight on the selection of high efflux in hemodialysis.", 
    "106": "It is known that the lipid-lowering agent pravastatin, which is not metabolized by cytochrome P450, is eliminated as an unchanged drug in bile and urine. It is interesting to note that the non-renal clearance of pravastatin in end-stage renal failure patients is decreased compared with that of healthy volunteers. This study investigated the influence of uremic serum and toxins on the transport mechanisms of pravastatin to elucidate the cause of decreased non-renal clearance in end-stage renal failure patients. Caco-2 and Hep3B cells were used as models of intestinal epithelial cells and hepatocytes respectively. Normal and uremic serum were deproteinized by treatment with methanol. 3-Carboxy-4-methyl-5propyl-2-furanpropanoic acid (CMPF), hippuric acid, indole-3-acetic acid, 3-indoxyl sulfate, and p-cresol were chosen as uremic toxins. Uremic serum-treated Caco-2 cells exhibited significantly increased accumulation of pravastatin and significantly decreased expression of MRP2 mRNA compared with normal serum-treated Caco-2 cells. In addition, the expression of MRP2 mRNA tended to decrease in cells treated with CMPF, indole-3-acetic acid, or 3-indoxyl sulfate. Uremic serum-treated Hep3B cells showed a significantly decreased initial uptake rate of pravastatin; furthermore, the expressions of OATP1B1 and OATP2B1 mRNA were decreased compared to normal serum-treated Hep3B cells. These results suggest that the decrease in the non-renal clearance of pravastatin in end-stage renal failure patients is partly induced by the downregulation of intestinal MRP2 and hepatic OATP1B1 and/or OATP2B1 by various uremic toxins in end-stage renal failure patients.", 
    "107": "Statins are a standard of care in many clinical settings such as acute myocardial infarction and for patients having or at risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease. This is based on a plethora of data showing reductions in CV events and mortality. The CV benefit of statins can be partly explained by their ability to inhibit of HMG-CoA reductase, which subsequently lowers cholesterol and decreases the formation of mevalonate. However, the inhibition of the mevalonate pathway decreases the formation of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) within the body. It has been a long-standing theory that statin-associated muscle pain (myalgia) is caused, or at least partly contributed by, a reduction in CoQ10 levels in muscle mitochondria. One of the main side effects of statins is myalgia, which causes the patient to either stop their statin or significantly reduce the dose of their statin. The question of whether CoQ10 can help treat statin myopathy is a common one encountered by clinicians in current day practice.", 
    "108": "Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. LSS pathology is associated with secondary injury caused by inflammation, oxidative damage and cell death. Apart from laminectomy, pharmacological therapy targeting secondary injury is limited. Statins are FDA-approved cholesterol-lowering drug. They also show pleiotropic anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and neuroprotective effects. To investigate the therapeutic efficacy of simvastatin in restoring normal locomotor function after cauda equina compression (CEC) in a rat model of LSS, CEC injury was induced in rats by implanting silicone gels into the epidural spaces of L4 and L6. Experimental group was treated with simvastatin (5\u00a0mg/kg body weight), while the injured (vehicle) and sham operated (sham) groups received vehicle solution. Locomotor function in terms of latency on rotarod was measured for 49\u00a0days and the threshold of pain was determined for 14\u00a0days. Rats were sacrificed on day 3 and 14 and the spinal cord and cauda equina fibers were extracted and studied by histology, immunofluorescence, electron microscopy (EM) and TUNEL assay. Simvastatin aided locomotor functional recovery and enhanced the threshold of pain after the CEC. Cellular Infiltration and demyelination decreased in the spinal cord from the simvastatin group. EM revealed enhanced myelination of cauda equina in the simvastatin group. TUNEL assay showed significantly decreased number of apoptotic neurons in spinal cord from the simvastatin group compared to the vehicle group. Simvastatin hastens the locomotor functional recovery and reduces pain after CEC. These outcomes are mediated through the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties of simvastatin. The data indicate that simvastatin may be a promising drug candidate for LSS treatment in humans.", 
    "109": "Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by early and accelerated atherosclerosis leading to increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Beyond traditional cardiovascular risk factors, several pathogenetic mechanisms have been proposed, including emerging inflammatory and autoimmune mechanisms. Inflammatory stimuli are now believed to cause vascular damage, which can be estimated by well-established noninvasive techniques. Carotid intima-media thickness, pulse-wave velocity and flow-mediated dilatation, markers of subclinical atherosclerosis, arterial stiffness, and endothelial function, respectively, have been recently used to detect vascular dysfunction in the wide spectrum of autoimmune diseases. The role of anti-tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 and novel biologic agents remains unclear, although early control of the inflammatory process seems crucial for reducing cardiovascular risk. Considering the importance of cardiovascular risk management, further well-designed studies are warranted to clarify the potential benefits and harms of anti-inflammatory treatment.",

In the 52 patients who completed the study, there was a significant reduction in total cholesterol, LDL, ApoA1 and ApoB (all P<0.003). However, glycemic control and BMI were unaltered. The present study indicates that 8 weeks daily intake of 3 g of \u03b2-glucans significantly reduces total cholesterol, LDL, ApoA1 and ApoB in MG patients. \u03b2-glucans may therefore be of value in improving lipid status in MG patients, without the muscle-related side effects accompanied by statins.",

Here, we investigate whether the emission of VOCs from bracken fern Pteridium aquilinum is triggered by herbivory and if so - whether it is regulated by the octadecanoid signaling pathway. Interestingly, feeding of both generalist (Spodoptera littoralis) and specialist (Strongylogaster multifasciata) herbivores as well as application of singular and continuous mechanical wounding of fronds induced only very low levels of VOC emission. In contrast, treatment with jasmonic acid (JA) led to the emission of a blend of VOCs that was mainly comprised of terpenoids. Likewise, treatment with the JA precursor 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) and \u03b1-linolenic acid also induced VOC emission, albeit to a lower intesity than the JA treatment. Accumulation of endogenous JA was low in mechanically wounded fronds and these levels were unaffected by the application of oral secretions from both generalist or specialist herbivores. The emission of terpenoids upon JA treatment could be blocked with fosmidomycin and mevinolin, which are inhibitors of the MEP- and MVA pathways, respectively. These results indicate that similar to higher plants, terpenoid VOCs are produced via these pathways in bracken fern and that these pathways are JA-responsive. However, the very low amounts of terpenoids released after herbivory or mechanical damage are in stark contrast to what is known from higher plants. We speculate that S. multifasciata and S. littoralis feeding apparently did not induce the threshold levels of JA required for activating the MEP and MVA pathways and the subsequent volatile emission in bracken fern.",

    "155": "Mixed hyperlipidemia is often associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and contributes to atherosclerosis progression in diabetes patients. Leukocyte activation plays an important role in atherogenesis. Both statins and fibrates are used in the treatment of mixed dyslipidemia, but their specific effect on leukocyte function remains to be elucidated. We have therefore compared the effect of simvastatin and fenofibrate on several leukocyte activation markers in diabetes patients.", 
    "156": "Twenty patients with type 2 diabetes and mixed hyperlipidemia were sequentially treated with simvastatin (20 mg/day) and fenofibrate (200 mg/day) in a randomized cross-over study (12 weeks each treatment). We measured adhesion molecules LFA-1, VLA-4 and CD18; in addition, lipopolysaccharide receptor CD14 on monocytes was analyzed as a marker of innate immunity. Leukocyte expression of these molecules was quantified using flow cytometry. Laboratory examinations were done at baseline and at the end of each treatment. Baseline values were compared to those of 29 healthy controls.", 
    "157": "Expression of integrin CD18 (in all leukocyte populations), lipopolysaccharide receptor and VLA-4 (on lymphocytes only) was significantly higher in patients than in controls. Both treatments resulted in significant decrease in CD18 and CD14 expression; LFA-1 and VLA-4 were not influenced.",

    "160": "A total of 518 consecutive patients (66 % males) underwent coronary angiography in connection with lipids and lipoprotein determinations between 1st January and 31st May 2010. Most of the patients were treated with lipid lowering therapy (77 % statins). Modified angiographic Gensini Score (GS) and adjusted angiographic score (AS) were used to reflect the extent of coronary atherosclerosis.", 
    "161": "Both GS and AS angiographic scores correlated significantly with age, male gender, statin therapy and inversely with left ventricular ejection fraction (p<0.05-0.01 for all). The results showed significant inverse correlation of HDL cholesterol levels with GS and AS (r=-0.16, p<0.001), and apolipoprotein A levels with GS and AS (r=-0.20, p<0.0001) and a positive correlation of Lp(a) levels with angiographic score (r=0.13, p<0.01) and with adjusted angiographic score (r=0.16, p<0.01).

Landmark analysis showed that almost all mortality benefit occurred in the first 30-days after PCI: 10 deaths among patients receiving statins and 22 deaths among patients not receiving statins (Kaplan-Meier estimates of 30-day death, 0.17% and 1.06%, respectively; HR=0.16, 95% CI 0.08-0.34, P<0.001). No significant difference in mortality according to statin pretreatment between 30 days and 1 year was observed (109 deaths among patients receiving statins vs 51 deaths among patients not receiving statins; Kaplan-Meier estimates 1.89% and 2.53%; HR=0.75, 95% CI 0.53-1.05, P=0.095).

Groups of six animals received oral saline or simvastatin (3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day) until sacrifice on day 11. Alveolar bone loss was determined by macroscopic and histologic examination. The serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and total alkaline phosphatase (TAP) were evaluated. Gingival myeloperoxidase activity and gingival levels of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, IL-10, reduced glutathione, malonaldehyde, and nitrate/nitrite were analyzed to investigate oxidative stress and inflammation. Expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), matrix metalloproteinases 1 and 8 (MMP-1 and -8), bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), receptor activator of nuclear factor \u03baB (RANK), RANK ligand (RANKL), and osteoprotegerin (OPG) were also investigated by immunohistochemistry to assess bone turnover and metabolism. Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to confirm the expression of RANKL in rats' maxillae.", 
    "177": "Treatment with simvastatin improved alveolar bone loss within all of the parameters studied, thus demonstrating anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity. Simvastatin reduced expression of iNOS, MMP-1 and -8, RANK, and RANKL and increased BMP-2 and OPG levels in the periodontal tissue. Simvastatin (30 mg/kg) increased TAP activity on day 11 compared with the saline group. No differences were found in the levels of AST and ALT in any of the groups studied.",

Pharmaceutical claims show a strong tendency for patients to remain on their initially assigned treatment. With computer simulations, the impact of initial statin treatment decisions on medium- and long-term cardiovascular outcomes were examined.",

Patients initiated treatment with simvastatin (20, 40, or 80 mg), atorvastatin (10, 20, 40, or 80 mg), or rosuvastatin (10, 20, or 40 mg), and periodically intensified treatment. The simulated population consisted of 50,025 patients, aged 45-70 years, with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol exceeding goal. The proportion of patients initiating each dose was calibrated to United States pharmacy claims. Patients not reaching goal intensified the dose of their current statin or switched to an appropriate dose of rosuvastatin at rates matching pharmacy claims. Biomarkers and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were tracked for 10 years and several high-risk subpopulations were analyzed. Statin models used biomarker effects from the STELLAR (Statin Therapies for Elevated Lipid Levels Compared Across Doses to Rosuvastatin) trial and outcomes data from various trials.",

    "183": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death. The statin drugs may have therapeutic potential in respiratory diseases such as COPD, but whether they prevent bronchial epithelial injury is unknown. We hypothesised that simvastatin attenuates acute tobacco smoke-induced neutrophilic lung inflammation and airway epithelial injury. Spontaneously hypertensive rats were given simvastatin (20 mg\u00b7kg(-1) i.p.) daily for either 7 days prior to tobacco smoke exposure and during 3 days of smoke exposure, or only during tobacco smoke exposure. Pretreatment with simvastatin prior to and continued throughout smoke exposure reduced the total influx of leukocytes, neutrophils and macrophages into the lung and airways. Simvastatin attenuated tobacco smoke-induced cellular infiltration into lung parenchymal and airway subepithelial and interstitial spaces. 1 week of simvastatin pretreatment almost completely prevented smoke-induced denudation of the airway epithelial layer, while simvastatin given only concurrently with the smoke exposure had no effect. Simvastatin may be a novel adjunctive therapy for smoke-induced lung diseases, such as COPD. Given the need for statin pretreatment there may be a critical process of conditioning that is necessary for statins' anti-inflammatory effects. Future work is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of this statin protective effect.",

Mean age was 66.1 \u00b1 11.2 (range 22-89) years. ICD implantation protocols and in-hospital and outpatient records were reviewed retrospectively. We analysed the following clinical and procedural variables: age, gender, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, mean heart rate (HR), QRS width, number of antiarrhythmic ICD interventions, type of SCD prevention, ICD type, performing defibrillation threshold testing (DFT) to establish defibrillation safety margin at ICD implantation, ventricular lead location, history of cardiovascular disease and arrhythmia, medications used (amiodarone, sotalol, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, statins, loop diuretics, aldosterone antagonists). Date and cause of death were established by contacting patient family and/or the hospital to which the patient was admitted shortly before death or the general practitioner caring for the patient (verification of death certificates).", 
    "187": "During the mean follow-up period of 447 \u00b1 313 days, 46 patients died of known causes.

A comparison between primary and secondary prevention patients was performed. Mean QRS width <118 ms, resting HR < 78 bpm and LVEF >30% were significant cutoff values for improved survival as determined using the ROC curves. HR >78 bpm was observed in all SCD patients. In Kaplan-Meier univariate analysis including 27 parameters potentially influencing survival, 10 significant parameters were identified (type of prevention, presence of cardiomyopathy, ventricular tachycardia, HR, QRS width, LVEF, NYHA class, performing DFT, and statin and diuretic treatment). In Cox multivariate analysis, risk of death was increased with mean LVEV <30% (3-fold increase in risk), no DFT (2-fold increase in risk), NYHA class III or IV (3-fold increase in risk), and no statin use (2-fold increase in risk). Mean HR <78 bpm and QRS width <118 ms were independently related to an increased survival.",

In these patients, indications for cardiac resynchronisation therapy should be considered. HR <78 bpm and QRS width <118 ms are independent protective factors. HR >78 bpm was observed in all SCD patients. Sicker ICD patients live for a shorter time. The presence of atrial fibrillation, number of antiarrhythmic ICD interventions, ICD type and revascularisation approach did not affect survival/mortality.", 
    "189": "This study investigates the potential of supersaturated self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (super-SNEDDS) to improve the bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs compared to conventional SNEDDS. Conventional SNEDDS contained simvastatin (SIM) at 75% of the equilibrium solubility (S (eq)). Super-SNEDDS containing SIM at 150 and 200% of S (eq) were produced by subjecting the SNEDDS preconcentrates to a heating and cooling cycle. The super-SNEDDS were physically stable over 10 months. During in vitro lipolysis of SNEDDS and super-SNEDDS the SIM concentration in the aqueous phase increased for the first 30 min almost proportional to the drug loads and amounts of preconcentrate employed. The 200% drug-loaded super-SNEDDS generated an amorphous SIM precipitate at the end of in vitro lipolysis. In vivo, the relative bioavailability of SIM from super-SEDDDS increased significantly to 180 \u00b1 53.3% (p = 0.014) compared to the dosing of two capsules of (dose equivalent) 75% drug-loaded SNEDDS. A significant increase in the terminal half-life of elimination was observed for super-SNEDDS (2.3 \u00b1 0.6 h) compared to conventional SNEDDS (1.4 \u00b1 0.3 h) as well as a decreased area under the curve ratio of the SIM metabolite simvastatin acid to the parent compound (0.57 \u00b1 0.20 and 0.90 \u00b1 0.3), possibly due to a combination of saturation effects on presystemic metabolising enzymes and prolonged absorption along the small intestine. In summary, this study demonstrated that super-SNEDDS are a viable formulation option to enhance the bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs such as simvastatin while reducing the pill burden by an increased drug load of SNEDDS.", 
    "190": "A codon-optimized 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate aldolase (DERA) gene was newly synthesized and expressed in Escherichia coli to investigate its biochemical properties and applications in synthesis of statin intermediates. The expressed DERA was purified and characterized using 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate as the substrate. The specific activity of recombinant DERA was 1.8 U/mg. The optimum pH and temperature for DERA activity were pH 7.0 and 35 \u00b0C, respectively. The recombinant DERA was stable at pH 4.0-7.0 and at temperatures below 50 \u00b0C. The enzyme activity was inhibited by 1 mM of Ni(2+), Ba(2+) and Fe(2+). The apparent K (m) and V (max) values of purified enzyme for 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate were 0.038 mM and 2.9 \u03bcmol min(-1) mg(-1), for 2-deoxyribose were 0.033 mM and 2.59 \u03bcmol min(-1) mg(-1), respectively, which revealed that the enzyme had similar catalytic efficiency towards phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated substrates. To synthesize statin intermediates, the bioconversion process for production of (3R, 5S)-6-chloro-2,4,6-trideoxyhexose from chloroacetaldehyde and acetaldehyde by the recombinant DERA was developed and a conversion of 94.4 % was achieved. This recombinant DERA could be a potential candidate for application in production of (3R, 5S)-6-chloro-2,4,6-trideoxyhexose.", 
    "191": "Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most common lethal tumors in the world. Thus, it is very urgent to develop new therapeutic targets against this disease. The mevalonate (MVA) pathway, paced by its rate-limiting enzyme, hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, is required for the generation of several fundamental end products including cholesterol and isoprenoids. The function of the MVA pathway in ESCC has not been investigated. In this study, it was found that the MVA pathway was upregulated in ESCC clinical samples. Statin, the inhibitor of the MVA pathway, exerted potent cytotoxicity against human ESCC cells by inhibiting cell growth and proliferation, while it exerted lesser effects on non-tumorigenic SHEE cells. Further study revealed that statin could potently induce cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest and also dose-dependently inhibit the growth of xenograft tumors in nude mice. With regard to the molecular mechanism, statin treatment was related to decreased extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, cyclin D1 expression, and increased cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Taken together, our findings suggest that the MVA pathway plays an important role in the progression of ESCC by modulating cell growth and statin might be a potential therapeutic agent in ESCC.",

    "196": "The SLC10 family represents seven genes containing 1-12 exons that encode proteins in humans with sequence lengths of 348-477 amino acids. Although termed solute carriers (SLCs), only three out of seven (i.e. SLC10A1, SLC10A2, and SLC10A6) show sodium-dependent uptake of organic substrates across the cell membrane. These include the uptake of bile salts, sulfated steroids, sulfated thyroidal hormones, and certain statin drugs by SLC10A1 (Na(+)-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP)), the uptake of bile salts by SLC10A2 (apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT)), and uptake of sulfated steroids and sulfated taurolithocholate by SLC10A6 (sodium-dependent organic anion transporter (SOAT)). The other members of the family are orphan carriers not all localized in the cell membrane. The name \"bile acid transporter family\" arose because the first two SLC10 members (NTCP and ASBT) are carriers for bile salts that establish their enterohepatic circulation. In recent years, information has been obtained on their 2D and 3D membrane topology, structure-transport relationships, and on the ligand and sodium-binding sites. For SLC10A2, the putative 3D morphology was deduced from the crystal structure of a bacterial SLC10A2 analog, ASBT(NM). This information was used in this chapter to calculate the putative 3D structure of NTCP. This review provides first an introduction to recent knowledge about bile acid synthesis and newly found bile acid hormonal functions, and then describes step-by-step each individual member of the family in terms of expression, localization, substrate pattern, as well as protein topology with emphasis on the three functional SLC10 carrier members."
