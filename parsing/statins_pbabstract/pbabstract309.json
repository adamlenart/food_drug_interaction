The groups were extremely well balanced with respect to baseline demographics and risk factors such as blood pressure and plasma lipids. Over a 5-year period of follow-up, the primary end-points will be a composite of fatal and non-fatal coronary events. Secondary end-points will include stroke and transient ischemic attack, all cardiovascular events and total mortality.",

We also examined the effect of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor pitavastatin against neuronal damage in the hippocampal CA1 sector after ischaemia.", 
    "4": "Severe neuronal damage was observed in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons from 5 days after ischaemia. GFAP-positive cells increased gradually in the hippocampus from 5 days after ischaemia. Five and 14 days after ischaemia, significant increases in the number of GFAP-positive cells and isolectin B4-positive cells were observed in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 sector. Mild increases in the number of S100 and S100beta-positive cells were observed in the hippocampal CA1 sector from 1 h to 2 days after ischaemia. Thereafter, S100beta-positive cells increased in the hippocampal CA1 sector after ischaemia, whereas S100-positive cells decreased in this region. In our double-labelled immunostainings, S100 and S100beta immunoreactivity was found in GFAP-positive astrocytes, but not in isolectin B4-positive microglia. Pharmacological study showed that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, pitavastatin, can protect against the hippocampal CA1 neuronal damage after ischaemia. This drug also prevented increases in the number of GFAP-positive astrocytes, isolectin B4-positive microglia, S100-positive astrocytes and S100beta-positive astrocytes after ischaemia.", 
    "5": "The present study demonstrates that pitavastatin can decrease the neuronal damage of hippocampal CA1 sector after ischaemia. This beneficial effect may be, at least in part, mediated by inhibiting the expression of astrocytic activation in the hippocampus at the acute phase after ischaemia. Thus the modulation of astrocytic activation may offer a novel therapeutic strategy of ischaemic brain damage.", 
    "6": "We investigated the neuroprotective effects of a novel 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (pitavastatin) on ischemic neuronal damage in gerbils using immunohistochemistry. The animals were allowed to survive for 14 days after 5 min of ischemia induced by bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries. Five days after ischemia, severe neuronal cell loss was observed in the hippocampal CA1 sector. Prophylactic treatment with pitavastatin dose-dependently prevented the hippocampal CA1 neuronal cell loss 5 days after ischemia. Immunohistochemical study did not show the change of nNOS and iNOS expression in the hippocampus except for, in a few regions, up to 1 day after ischemia. Thereafter, the expression of iNOS was observed in the hippocampal CA1 sector 5 and 14 days after ischemia. In contrast, the expression of nNOS and eNOS gradually decreased in the hippocampal CA1 sector up to 14 days after ischemia. Prophylactic treatment with pitavastatin also prevented the expression of iNOS and the decrease of eNOS expression and the number of nNOS-positive cells in the hippocampal CA1 sector 5 days after ischemia. However, prophylactic treatment with pitavastatin at a dose of 10 mg kg(-1) did not change the immunoreactivity of iNOS and nNOS in the hippocampus at an early phase after ischemia. In contrast, this drug prevented the reduction of eNOS immunoreactivity in the hippocampal CA1 neurons at an early phase after ischemia. These findings demonstrate that the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor pitavastatin can protect hippocampal CA1 neurons after transient forebrain ischemia through up-regulation of eNOS expression in this region. Thus pharmacological modulation of eNOS expression may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for cerebral ischemic stroke.",

    "19": "Statins safely and effectively reduce the morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular disease. In the trials conducted so far, which have been carried out predominantly on high-risk patients, the observed risk reduction is probably completely attributable to the reduction of the cholesterol level. However, statins also influence the atherosclerotic disease process in a lipid-independent way. This includes beneficial effects on the early pathogenetic components of atherosclerosis, such as endothelial dysfunction and inflammation. These effects are probably not visible in the large clinical trials that usually follow up cohorts of patients with late stages of atherosclerosis during a relatively short period of time. These cholesterol-independent effects do affect intermediate factors in the atherosclerotic process, such as endothelial dysfunction. In clinical practice, where not only short-term effects in patients with manifest vascular disease but also the prevention of the long-term complications of atherosclerosis in high-risk patients is an important goal, these so-called pleiotropic effects may contribute to risk reduction.",

We have previously established that the prostacyclin receptor (IP) undergoes isoprenylation, a lipid modification obligate for its function. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of the hydroxy methyl glutaryl co-enzyme A reductase inhibitor atorvastatin on signalling and function of the IP expressed in mammalian whole cells and in platelets isolated from patients undergoing therapeutic intervention with atorvastatin. Initially, the effect of atorvastatin on signalling by the human (h) and mouse (m) IP overexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and the hIP endogenously expressed in human erythroleukaemic 92.1.7 cells was investigated. Atorvastatin significantly reduced IP-mediated cAMP generation (IC(50) 6.6-11.1 microm) and [Ca(2+)](i) mobilization (IC(50) 7.2-16.4 microm) in a concentration-dependent manner, but had no effect on signalling by the nonisoprenylated beta(2) adrenergic receptor or the alpha or beta isoforms of the human thromboxane A(2) receptor (TP). Moreover, atorvastatin significantly reduced IP-mediated crossdesensitization of signalling by TP alpha (IC(50) 10.4 microm), but not by TP beta. In contrast to the whole-cell data, atorvastatin therapy did not interfere with IP-mediated cAMP generation or IP-induced inhibition of TP-mediated aggregation of platelets isolated from human volunteers undergoing therapeutic intervention with atorvastatin (10-80 mg per daily dose). In conclusion, while data generated in whole cells indicated that atorvastatin significantly impairs signalling by both the hIP and mP, the in vivo clinical data indicated that, at the administered therapeutic dose, atorvastatin does not significantly compromise IP signalling and function in humans.",

We also found long-term effects of atorvastatin, including decreased plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 and additional significant alterations in low-density lipoprotein subfractions and endothelial function, supporting benefits from continuous long-term atorvastatin therapy beyond early reversal of hypercholesterolemia.",

Treatment would be expected to prevent at least 37 major vascular events per 1000 such people treated for 4 years. Assessed separately, acute coronary heart disease events were reduced by 36% (-55 to -9), coronary revascularisations by 31% (-59 to 16), and rate of stroke by 48% (-69 to -11).

No justification is available for having a particular threshold level of LDL-cholesterol as the sole arbiter of which patients with type 2 diabetes should receive statins. The debate about whether all people with this disorder warrant statin treatment should now focus on whether any patients are at sufficiently low risk for this treatment to be withheld.", 
    "29": "Extracellular matrix components play a key role during the angiogenic process for a correct development of blood vessels: fibroblasts are the main cell type involved in the regulation of ECM protein production. In this study we characterize H. medicinalis fibroblasts and demonstrate that they take part to the regulation of angiogenesis that occurs during wound healing process. Massive proliferation and phenotypic modification are two distinctive markers of fibroblast activation. These cells, that are usually responsible for collagen production and function as an energy reservoir, are recruited during wound healing to form a collagen scaffold through a direct mechanic action and through secretion of specific proteoglycans. In addition we show that the activity of fibroblasts is modulated by EGF, a growth factor involved in wound healing in vertebrates. The formation of bundles of collagen fibrils by fibroblasts is fundamental for the development and migration of new blood vessels in lesioned areas during wound repair: administration of lovastatin in explanted leeches affects fibroblasts, damages collagen \"scaffold\" and indirectly causes the reduction of neo-capillary formation.",

Atorvastatin had a more pronounced cholesterol, LDL-C- and apo B-lowering effect (p < 0.001) compared with simvastatin. Both statins also significantly reduced serum triglyceride levels (p < 0.01). Simvastatin and atorvastatin caused no significant change in the levels of HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and apo A1. HDL-associated PON activity did not change significantly after simvastatin therapy, but significantly increased after atorvastatin treatment (p < 0.05).",

    "34": "Reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is presently the primary focus of lipid-lowering therapy for prevention and treatment of coronary heart disease (CHD). However, the high level of residual risk among statin-treated patients in recent coronary prevention studies indicates the need for modification of other major components of the atherogenic lipid profile. There is overwhelming evidence that a low plasma level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is an important independent risk factor for CHD. Moreover, a substantial proportion of patients with or at risk of developing premature CHD typically exhibit distinct lipid abnormalities, including low HDL-C levels. Thus, therapeutic intervention aimed at raising HDL-C, within the context of reducing global cardiovascular risk, would benefit such patients, a viewpoint increasingly adopted by international treatment guidelines. Therapeutic options for patients with low HDL-C include treatment with statins, fibrates and nicotinic acid, either as monotherapy or in combination. Of these options, nicotinic acid is not only the most potent agent for raising HDL-C but is also effective in reducing key atherogenic lipid components including triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (mainly very low-density lipoproteins [VLDL] and VLDL remnants), LDL-C, and lipoprotein(a). The principal features of the atherogenic lipid profile in type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome make them logical targets for nicotinic acid therapy, either alone or in combination with a statin. The lack of comprehensive European data on the prevalence of low HDL-C levels highlights a critical need for education on the importance of raising HDL-C in CHD prevention and treatment. The development of a reliable and accurate assay for HDL-C, as well as clarification of criteria for low and optimal levels of HDL-C in both men and women, constitute critical factors in the reliable identification and treatment of patients at elevated risk of CHD due to low HDL-C. Based on the available evidence, the European Consensus Panel recommends that the minimum target for HDL-C should be 40 mg/dL (1.03 mmol/L) in patients with CHD or with a high level of risk for CHD, including patients at high global risk with type 2 diabetes or the metabolic syndrome.",

Simvastatin was titrated from 20 mg/day up to 80 mg/day in order to achieve the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) LDL-C target < or = 100 mg/dL. The primary efficacy variable was the percentage of patients attaining the NCEP LDL-C target at Week 14. Secondary endpoints included proportion of patients achieving the European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society/European Society of Hypertension (European) LDL-C target < or = 115 mg/dL at Week 14 and percentage change in lipid parameters. Safety and tolerability were assessed by monitoring adverse experiences and safety laboratory tests. Fifteen Asian patients were part of the GOALLS cohort and their data were compared separately with results of non-Asians from GOALLS and Asians from the STATT study.",

At Week 14, 94.4%, 92.9%, and 91.7% of the GOALLS non-Asians, GOALLS Asians, and STATT patients achieved the European LDL-C target, respectively. The average treatment doses to attain NCEP and European targets were comparable among groups. The percentage reductions in lipid parameters from baseline to week 14 were similar among groups except, changes in high density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I favored Asian subjects. There was also a greater reduction in TG in the STATT study, but this was not consistent with TG reductions experienced by Asians in the GOALLS study. In both studies, simvastatin was generally well tolerated by all patients across the dosage range of 20 mg-80 mg. No cases of rhabdomyolysis or myopathy were reported in either study.", 
    "39": "A great majority of CHD patients is able to achieve LDL-C treatment goals (up to 90%) on simvastatin regardless of racial background. Simvastatin treatment at doses of 20 mg-80 mg is well-tolerated in Asian and non-Asian CHD patients. This side-by-side comparison provides evidence that Asian and non-Asian CHD populations respond similarly to comparable doses of simvastatin.",

All study treatments were administered once daily in the morning for 14 days as part of a 16-day inpatient confinement period. Fasting serum lipids were assessed pre-dose on days 1 (baseline), 7, and 14 by direct quantitative assay methods. Safety was evaluated by monitoring laboratory tests and recording adverse events. Blood samples were collected for ezetimibe and rosuvastatin pharmacokinetic evaluation prior to the first and last dose and at frequent intervals after the last dose (day 14) of study treatment.

In this 2-week inpatient study with restricted physical activity there was no apparent effect of any treatment on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) or triglycerides. The co-administration of ezetimibe and rosuvastatin caused a significantly (p < 0.01) greater percentage reduction in mean LDL-C (-61.4%) than rosuvastatin alone (-44.9%), with a mean incremental reduction of -16.4% (95%CI -26.3 to -6.53).

Patients with well- or moderately differentiated endometrial adenocarcinomas (mostly type I) had statistically significantly higher basal and stimulated plasma insulin and C-peptide concentrations than patients with poorly differentiated endometrial adenocarcinomas or rarely encountered tumors of the endometrium (primarily type II). Interestingly, the level of fasting insulinemia positively correlates with disease stage and with local and regional tumor dissemination only in the group of patients with well- or moderately differentiated endometrial adenocarcinomas. On the other hand, hyperinsulinemia and other hormonal-metabolic disturbances typical of insulin resistance syndrome do not increase the probability of DNA damage of somatic cells (according to the data of micronucleus test). In addition, no association between hormonal-metabolic disturbances and the degree of DNA unwinding in tumor and visually unchanged endometrium was found.",

    "49": "The human hepatoma cell line HepG2 was used to study the effect of cetaben, a non-fibrate hypolipidemic drug, on cell morphology and vesicle distribution. Cetaben treatment correlated with a fragmentation and/or condensation of Golgi cisternae and the appearance of large electron-lucent vesicles. The Golgi apparatus, demonstrated, for example, by fluorescence-lectin histochemistry, was fragmented after cetaben treatment. The lectin-positive remnants were dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, but with a preference for being transported to tips of cells. However, microtubules and the intermediate filaments as well as the actin microfilaments were unchanged after cetaben treatment indicating that changes in Golgi morphology are not caused by alterations in the cytoskeleton. Cetaben decreases the cholesterol content due to inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis. Changes in the intracellular cholesterol content are known to influence the intracellular vesicle distribution and are most likely responsible for cetaben-induced Golgi alterations, as depletion of cellular cholesterol by starvation or lovastatin and/or cyclodextrin treatment resulted in a similar redistribution of Golgi-derived wheat germ agglutinin vesicles. These lectin-stained vesicles colocalized with lysosomal marker proteins such as Limp-1 and Lamp-2, but not with the early endosomal markers Rab5 and EEA1. Upon removal of cetaben the lectin- and Limp-1/Lamp-2-costained vesicles dissociated and were transported back to the perinuclear region. Thus, cetaben-induced changes such as fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus and the dispersion of lysosomes away from their juxtanuclear location were reversible.", 
    "50": "The aim of this study was to characterise the role of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein in the disposition of cerivastatin. We investigated directional transport characteristics of [14C]cerivastatin across cell monolayers expressing P-glycoprotein (Caco-2 and L-MDR1) and disposition of cerivastatin in mice with disrupted mdr1a and mdr1b genes. The mice were given orally 1 mg/kg cerivastatin and plasma and tissue samples for analysis of cerivastatin were obtained 10, 20, or 30 min after drug administration. Four knock-out mice and four wild-type mice were studied at each time point. In addition, the hypothesis that gemfibrozil-mediated inhibition of P-glycoprotein contributes to the interaction between gemfibrozil and cerivastatin was tested in Caco-2 cells. The apparent permeability coefficient (P(app)) value for the basal-to-apical transport of cerivastatin in Caco-2 and L-MDR1 cell monolayers was 2.4 times (P<0.001) and 3.8 times (P<0.001) as high as the apical-to-basal P(app) value respectively. The P-glycoprotein inhibitor PSC-833 (1 microM) inhibited the net basal-to-apical transport of cerivastatin in Caco-2 monolayers by 35% (P<0.01) and the MRP inhibitor MK-571 (10 microM) by 50% (P<0.01). At concentrations up to 250 microM, gemfibrozil showed no significant effects on the net transport of cerivastatin in Caco-2 cells. The concentration of cerivastatin in the brain at 30 min was 3.1 times higher in the knock-out mice than in the wild-type mice (P<0.05). The brain-to-plasma cerivastatin concentration ratio at 20 min and 30 min was 2.1 (P<0.05) and 3.6 times (P<0.05) higher respectively in the knock-out animals compared with the wild-type animals. Collectively, these results indicate that cerivastatin is a P-glycoprotein substrate, although other transporters probably contribute to cerivastatin transport in humans. As several statins are P-glycoprotein substrates, beneficial as well as adverse effects of the statins might be affected by interindividual differences in P-glycoprotein expression or function caused by, e.g., the MDR1 polymorphism.", 
    "51": "Atherogenic cofactors, such as altered cholesterol metabolism, may impact locally on inflammatory responses in atherosclerotic lesions. Blood levels of inflammatory markers (e.g., C-reactive protein, fibrinogen) have been associated with hypercholesterolemia and with overt atherothrombotic disorders. More recently. cytokines (e.g., interleukin-6, interleukin-1beta) and soluble adhesion molecules (e.g., selectins, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) have been associated with both hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerotic disease, suggesting their use as potential therapeutic targets for the non-specific \"anti-inflammatory\" treatment of atherosclerosis. The inflammatory response associated with hypercholesterolemia involves not only the intrinsic cells of the artery wall. but also circulating cells. Platelets participate in this disease process through the release of a wide variety of biologically active substances. An imbalance of the hemostatic system and persistent in vivo platelet activation can be observed in hypercholesterolemia and may have pathophysiological implications in the development and progression of atherosclerotic plaques. Recent findings on the inflammatory actions of platelets have established the potential for a previously unrecognized biologic role for platelets in inflammation and vascular injury, and have opened new perspectives in the comprehension of the pathogenetic mechanism(s) of atherosclerosis. Stimulated platelets actively synthesize proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., CD40L, IL-1beta) and are able to release chemokines (i.e., platelet factor-4, RANTES) which have been all involved in the inflammatory process associated with hypercholesterolemia. This review will summarize the present understanding of the interplay between hypercholesterolemia, inflammation and platelet activation in the development and progression of atherosclerosis, and we also discuss the effects of lipid-lowering treatment on these phenomena.", 
    "52": "Before it gets to the development of manifest atherosclerotic lesions, all known risk factors primarily induce functional alterations in the vascular wall, namely in endothelial cells. Being termed endothelial dysfunction or endothelial activation, this condition is characterized by an altered availability of nitric oxide (NO). Under physiological conditions, NO is of unequivocal importance for the regulation of vascular homeostasis. Endothelium-derived NO released abluminally increases soluble guanylat cyclase activity in smooth muscle cells, thereby inducing relaxation and consequently vasodilatation. Intraluminally, NO inhibits the expression of adhesion molecules both on endothielial cells and neutrophils, thus preventing the adherence of cellular elements to the vascular wall. Furthermore, NO has antithrombotic effcts by inhibiting platelet aggregation and directly infuencing the synthesis of different factors involved in the coagulation cascade. Finally, in the long term, NO has been shown to exert antiproliferative properties. NO is generated intracellularly from L-arginine via NO-synthase with the help of several cofactors, including tetrahydobiopterin. Interestingly, it has recently become evident that under certain conditions, when there is a lack of tetrahydrobiopterin, NO-synthase produces reactive oxygen species instead of NO. Reactive oxygen species counteract the effects of NO and also scavenge NO resulting in the formation of peroxynitrite (ONOO). Peroxynitrite has been shown to have deleterious effects with respect to vascular function. The aim of the current review is to elucidate recent progress regarding the pathophysiological understanding of endothelial dysfunction. Furthermore, the significance of this condition for the evaluation and prognosis of patients is discussed. Finally, current therapeutical strategies in the treatment and improvement of endothelial dysfunction are highlighted.", 
    "53": "Atherosclerosis is a chronic systemic disease of the vasculature with an inflammatory component. It accounts for the majority of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries and its incidence is increasing in developing countries. The impairment of vascular endothelial cell function in atherosclerosis and in conditions associated with increased cardiovascular risk is an important determinant of disease progression. The reduction of endothelium-dependent relaxation in the coronary and systemic circulation in atherosclerosis is in part due to decreased bioavailability of nitric oxide and increased release of oxygen-derived free radicals. Atherosclerosis also increases the formation of vasoconstrictors and growth factors, adhesion of leukocytes, thrombosis, inflammation, cell proliferation, as well as increases in vascular tone. Here we review mechanisms and therapeutic approaches to improve endothelial pathways in atherosclerosis. Restoration of NO bioactivity through pharmacological inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system, statin therapy, or endothelin receptor blockade, ameliorates vascular function in experimental hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and heart failure. These treatments also have therapeutic benefit for patients at risk or with overt atherosclerosis, to reduce vascular and myocardial complications of this disease.", 
    "54": "In diabetes oxidative stress plays a key role in the pathogenesis of vascular complications, and an early step of such damage is considered the development of an endothelial dysfunction. Hyperglycemia directly promotes an endothelial dysfunction inducing process of overproduction of superoxide and consequently peroxynitrite that damages DNA and activates the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. This process, depleting NAD+, slowing glycolysis, ATP formation and electron transport, results in acute endothelial dysfunction in diabetic blood vessels and contributes to the development of diabetic complications. Classic antioxidants, like vitamin E, failed to show beneficial effects on diabetic complications probably due to their only \"symptomatic\" action. It is now evident that, statins, ACE inhibitors, AT-1 blockers, calcium channel blockers and thiazolinediones have a strong intracellular antioxidant activity, and it has been suggested that many of their beneficial ancillary effects are due to this property. Statins increase NO bioavailability and decrease superoxide production, probably interfering with NAD(P)H activity and modulating eNOS expression. ACE inhibitors and AT-1 blockers prevent hyperglycemia-derived oxidative stress modulating angiotensin action and production. This effect is of particular interest because hyperglycemia is able to directly modulate cellular angiotensin generation. Calcium channel blockers inhibit the peroxidation of cell membrane lipids and their subsequent intracellular translocation. Thiazolinediones bind and activate the nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, a nuclear receptor of ligand-dependent transcription factors. The inhibition of this receptors lead to inhibition of the inducible nitric oxide synthase and consequently reduction of peroxynitrite generation. This preventive activity against oxidative stress generation can justify a large utilization and association of this compound for preventing complications in diabetic patients, where antioxidant defences have been shown to be defective.", 
    "55": "Statins are beneficial both in the primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic vascular disease and acute events in a broad spectrum of patient subgroups. However, the observed clinical benefit with statin therapy is much greater than expected through the reduction of cholesterol levels alone. Clinical and experimental studies suggested that several antiatherosclerotic effects other than lipid lowering also contribute to the observed benefit of statin therapy. These 'pleiotropic effects' include improvement of endothelial function, antitrombotic actions, plaque stabilization, reduction of the vascular inflammatory process and anti-oxidation. Statins may also exhibit a wide variety of actions other than antiatherosclerotic effects. Recent observational data documented a potential association between statin use and improvement of fracture risk in osteoporosis. Despite the lack of randomized trials, epidemiological and limited clinical data suggested that statins might retard the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Observational data indicated that the progression of aortic stenosis and valvular calcification might be delayed in statin users. In addition, the deterioration of congestive heart failure may be delayed with statins via anti-inflammatory, vascular endothelial and antiatherosclerotic actions. Furthermore, preliminary clinical studies suggested that, by their immunosuppressive actions statins might reduce the incidence of rejection following organ transplantation. Currently, there is not enough evidence to prescribe therapy for such patients. However, ongoing studies are exploring the role of statin therapy for these new indications. This review will discuss several non-lipid effects of statin therapy currently under investigation.", 
    "56": "Remedies for primary osteoporosis are increasing in brands but not always with concomitant improvements in efficacy and safety. Clinical studies suggest that nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates alone display sufficient practical effectiveness to survive as effective therapy. However, their less effectiveness in highly osteopenic patients due to their lack of genuine bone anabolic effect waits improvements. Pinpointing statins as the inducer of BMP-2 provoked a rush of clinical and laboratory studies to identify bone anabolic properties. Clinical studies, even if only through observational, suggest that under conventional dosing conditions for hyperlipemia, the liver-targeted statins now in use display insufficient bone anabolic effect, although laboratory studies seem to be clarifying the mechanisms underlying intrinsic bone anabolic properties. While incomplete, these studies indicate the possibility that, if bioavailability to bone could be improved by simply changing dosing methods and/or deliberate derivatization, the genuine anabolic properties of statins on bone could be extracted and put into therapeutic use.", 
    "57": "Endothelial dysfunction contributes to the development of impaired coronary and systemic perfusion as well as reduced exercise capacity in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Thereby endothelial dysfunction is assumed to have a fundamental impact on morbidity and potential mortality in this disease. Reduced bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) and abundant formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the vascular wall are the key determinants in endothelial dysfunction. The resulting imbalance between NO and ROS mainly results from neurohumoral activation associated with CHF. The excessive activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and endothelin systems plays a pivotal role. Treatment with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-, aldosterone-, and endothelin-antagonists has been shown to beneficially modulate endothelial dysfunction in CHF. Furthermore, antioxidants, L-arginine, cofactors of endothelial NO-synthase, and exercise training positively modulate endothelial function. This article reviews the current knowledge of the pathophysiological events contributing to endothelial dysfunction in CHF as well as several treatment options to reverse those changes.", 
    "58": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis and is associated with a several-fold increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Statins and anti-platelet therapy have been unequivocally shown to be beneficial in patients with coronary artery disease, but minimal data exist on the effectiveness of these agents in patients with PAD and those undergoing peripheral vascular interventions. One recent study has demonstrated that statins are very effective as secondary preventive measures in patients with PAD but continue to be underutilized in this cohort. In our institutional peripheral interventional database, after adjustment for demographics and comorbidities, statin therapy (OR=0.21, 95% CI 0.05-0.86, p=0.03) and clopidogrel therapy (OR=0.17, 95% CI 0.04-0.78, p=0.02) were both associated with a significant reduction of the composite event rate of death, myocardial infarction and stroke at 6 months. In this article, we critically review the existing literature on the role of anti-platelet and statin therapy in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with PAD. Appropriate use of these agents may significantly decrease the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of patients with PAD.", 
    "59": "Hypertension is a well-known risk factor for atherosclerosis, but the molecular mechanisms that link elevated blood pressure to atherosclerosis progression remain uncertain. The interactions of mechanical forces and cells of the vasculature are relevant to many cardiovascular diseases. Once a monocyte infiltrates a tissue, it establishes extracellular matrix contacts and is subjected to deformation through those contacts. Macrophages participate in atherogenesis and commonly localize at sites of coronary plaque rupture. Although macrophages may be subjected to excess mechanical stress in these conditions, how biomechanical forces affect macrophage function remains incompletely defined. Recent work demonstrates that human monocytes/macrophages respond to mechanical deformation with selective augmentation of matrix metalloproteinases and induction of immediate-early genes. In human monocytes/macrophages and THP-1 cells, biomechanical strain can induce expression of the class A scavenger receptor, an important lipoprotein receptor in atherogenesis. In addition, DNA microarray analysis reveals that cyclic mechanical strain induces only a few genes (>2.5-fold), including interleukin-8 and IEX-1 in THP-1 cells. Thus, biomechanical deformation of monocytes/macrophages contributes to degradation of extracellular matrix, monocyte differentiation, and promotion of atherosclerosis. These findings suggest that mechanical stress in vivo, such as hypertension, may play an important role in atherogenesis and instability of coronary-artery plaques through biomechanical effects on vascular macrophages.", 
    "60": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are effective lipid-lowering drugs widely used in patients with dyslipidemia at risk of cardiovascular diseases. Primary and secondary prevention studies have revealed a significant reduction of risk for cardiovascular diseases. However, recent studies have demonstrated that statins have direct vascular effects (pleiotropic effects) independent of lipid-lowering action. Vascular remodeling, defined as changes in size and/or structure of adult vasculature, not only allows physiological adaptation and healing but also underlines the pathogenesis of major cardiovascular diseases. Vascular remodeling can be inward, occlusive, and outward. Various cardiovascular diseases probably represent a terminal phenotype of such vascular remodeling. In this review, we will focus on the basic actions and clinical implications of statin therapy to each type of vascular remodeling in response to various stimuli.", 
    "61": "Advancing age is an independent risk factor for the development of coronary heart disease. However, the significance of hypercholesterolemia as a cardiovascular risk factor in the elderly, has been widely debated. While no large-scale, randomized clinical trial has been conducted to evaluate cholesterol lowering solely in the elderly, evidence from older subgroups in several intervention trials supports the efficacy of lowering elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol for reducing cardiovascular risk in the elderly. Furthermore, although the relative risk of hyper-cholesterolemia for coronary heart disease incidence may be attenuated with advancing age, the population-wide impact of treating elevated cholesterol levels in the elderly would be large, due to the high frequency of coronary heart disease in the elderly. This article reviews key issues in the management of hyper-cholesterolemia with respect to coronary heart disease risk reduction in the elderly.", 
    "62": "Effect of Simvastatin on lipid metabolism, platelet aggregation properties and vasoactive eicosanoids content in blood plasma of patients with hypercholesterinemia (dislipoproteinemia II-A, II-B, and IV type) has been studied by the authors. 49 patients with coronary heart disease, stable angina of effort, II-III functional classes by NYHA have been observed. 57.1% of the patients had normal cholesterol levels (less 200 mg/dl) at the end of the therapy, 37.6% of the patients had reached border levels of cholesterol in their blood serum (200 to 240 mg/dl). It was established that beneficial effect of Simvastatin is associated not only with its hypolipidemic activity but also with pleothropic effect of the medication. Positive shifts in morphofunctional state and thrombocytes aggregation indexes have been noted in the process of the treatment.",

Treatment episode durations were virtually identical for both drugs: more than 35% of episodes were 1 month or shorter, more than 50% were 2 months or shorter, and 75% were 5 months or shorter. Concurrently prescribed neuroleptic or statin medications predicted longer disulfiram and naltrexone treatment episodes. However, for patients newly prescribed common neuroleptic, antidepressant, or statin agents, the risks for discontinuing disulfiram or naltrexone were 1.4 to 2.3 times greater than for discontinuing these other agents.",

    "67": "Simvastatin and fenofibrate are both commonly used lipid-regulating agents with distinct mechanisms of action, and their coadministration may be an attractive treatment for some patients with dyslipidemia. A 2-period, randomized, open-label, crossover study was conducted in 12 subjects to determine if fenofibrate and simvastatin are subject to a clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction at steady state. In treatment A, subjects received an 80-mg simvastatin tablet in the morning for 7 days. In treatment B, subjects received a 160-mg micronized fenofibrate capsule in the morning for 7 days, followed by a 160-mg micronized fenofibrate capsule dosed together with an 80-mg simvastatin tablet on days 8 to 14. Because food increases the bioavailability of fenofibrate, each dose was administered with food to maximize the exposure of fenofibric acid. The steady-state pharmacokinetics (AUC(0-24h), C(max), and t(max)) of active and total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, simvastatin acid, and simvastatin were determined following simvastatin administration with and without fenofibrate. Also, fenofibric acid steady-state pharmacokinetics were evaluated with and without simvastatin. The geometric mean ratios (GMRs) for AUC(0-24h) (80 mg simvastatin [SV] + 160 mg fenofibrate)/(80 mg simvastatin alone) and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) were 0.88 (0.80, 0.95) and 0.92 (0.82, 1.03) for active and total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. The GMRs and 90% CIs for fenofibric acid (80 mg SV + 160 mg fenofibrate/160 mg fenofibrate alone) AUC(0-24h) and C(max) were 0.95 (0.88, 1.04) and 0.89 (0.77, 1.02), respectively. Because both the active inhibitor and fenofibric acid AUC GMR 90% confidence intervals fell within the prespecified bounds of (0.70, 1.43), no clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interaction between fenofibrate and simvastatin was concluded in humans. The coadministration of simvastatin and fenofibrate in this study was well tolerated.",

More recent reports have been more consistent in demonstrating no increase in thrombotic event rates (myocardial infarction, stroke, etc) in patients receiving clopidogrel with a statin compared with clopidogrel alone, although these reports have all been retrospective in nature. Until a prospective study shows detriment when clopidogrel and statins are given together compared with either drug being administered alone, the debate regarding whether this interaction is of practical importance will continue. Until then, the weight of the evidence does not currently support a change in prescribing patterns for the sole purpose of avoiding a potential statin-clopidogrel interaction.", 
    "86": "To elucidate the link between the intake of animal fat and asthma, a murine model was developed to examine the effect of dietary cholesterol on pulmonary allergic inflammation. Male C57BL6 mice were fed either a control diet or a diet supplemented with 2% cholesterol. Following sensitization and inhalation exposure to ovalbumin, the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of mice in the cholesterol group contained higher numbers of eosinophils and elevated levels of IL-5, PGE(2), and MCP-1. In addition, dietary cholesterol also resulted in elevated production of IL-4 and IFN-gamma by lymphocytes isolated from the lungs. These inflammatory indicators were all significantly correlated with serum cholesterol levels. In contrast to the effect of dietary cholesterol, adding pravastatin to the drinking water significantly reduced eosinophil infiltration and the levels of IL-5, PGE(2) and MCP-1 in lavage fluid. Although dietary cholesterol did not alter baseline IL-12 in the lungs, in mice challenged with ovalbumin the IL-12 levels were reduced in the cholesterol group and elevated significantly in the pravastatin group. The results suggest that dietary cholesterol might enhance pulmonary allergic inflammation, possibly involving both nonspecific inflammatory processes and lymphocyte activities.",

Dyslipidemia characterized by moderately elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high triglycerides and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels is common in this population. We hypothesized that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors would reduce vascular morbidity and mortality in this patient group. The 'Deutsche Diabetes Dialyse Studie' (4D study) is a prospective, randomized, double-blind study involving 178 dialysis centers throughout Germany.

    "90": "The existence of interactions between different drugs or between drugs and the diet is becoming better and better known. Statins are medicines currently in widespread use for the treatment of hyperlipidaemias. Diet has a great influence on the prevention and/or treatment of these pathologies as the therapeutic strategy used comprises appropriate diet and, if this does not succeed, pharmacological therapy is begun in combination with dietary advice. For this reason it is necessary to be aware of the potential interactions between this kind of medication and foodstuffs in order to avoid alterations in the therapeutic benefits and even the onset of adverse side effects. All of the statins are absorbed orally, so the impact of food intake on administration is extremely important to achieve an appropriate therapeutic effect. Many of the interactions of statins lie in their metabolism through cytochrome P-450 (except for pravastatin), thus making them candidates for interaction with certain foodstuffs or compounds contained in them, such as in the case of grapefruit juice. This paper reviews the drug-nutrient interactions with special attention to the interactions specific to statins and the mechanism of these interactions is described so as to contribute to their avoidance and thus improve this form of treatment in individuals with hyperlipidaemia.",

Animals from control group II received 20% ethanol instead of water. Animals from experimental group I received Atorvastatin in the dose of 0.28 mg/24h, animals from experimental group II received Atorvastatin in the dose of 2.8 mg/24h, animals from experimental group III received 20% ethanol + Atorvastatin in the dose of 0.28 mg. After 6 weeks the animals were decapitated. H+E staining, PAS method for detection of neutral mucopolysaccharides and Thomas's reaction for detection of lipids were made on 6 micron thick sections. The surface areas of the nuclei sections were assessed in the zona fasciculata. It was stated that ethanol causes strong hyperemia of suprarenal cortex, the high dose of atorvastatin--2.8 mg/24h and small dose of atorvastatin--0.28 mg/24h administered with ethanol cause the decrease of lipid amount in the whole suprarenal cortex and degenerative changes in many cells of the zona fasciculata.", 
    "92": "AY-9944 (AY) exacerbates chronic recurrent seizures in rats that are analogous to atypical absence epilepsy in humans. The mechanism by which AY affects the slow spike-and-wave discharges associated with these seizures is not known, but is thought to involve inhibition of cholesterol synthesis. We tested the hypothesis that seizures seen with AY are due to significant reduction in brain cholesterol and/or elevated brain 7-dehydrocholesterol by assessing whether three other cholesterol synthesis inhibitors mimic AY seizures in rats. Effects of AY on brain sterols and spike-and-wave discharge duration were compared with those of two other late-stage cholesterol inhibitors [BM 15.766 (BM) and U18666A (UA)] and to an HMG-CoA reductase (early-stage cholesterol) inhibitor, lovastatin. With BM or UA, prolongation of seizure duration and brain sterol changes was similar to that caused by AY. AY effects on both brain sterols and seizure duration were dose-related. Lovastatin, with or without concurrent AY, mimicked AY seizures but reduced brain cholesterol by <10% and did not significantly change brain 7-dehydrocholesterol. Either lovastatin has a different mechanism of action than these late-stage cholesterol inhibitors or the brain sterol changes are not directly responsible for seizures in this model.", 
    "93": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infectivity requires actin-dependent clustering of host lipid raft-associated receptors, a process that might be linked to Rho guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activation. Rho GTPase activity can be negatively regulated by statins, a family of drugs used to treat hypercholesterolemia in man. Statins mediate inhibition of Rho GTPases by impeding prenylation of small G proteins through blockade of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. We show that statins decreased viral load and increased CD4+ cell counts in acute infection models and in chronically HIV-1-infected patients. Viral entry and exit was reduced in statin-treated cells, and inhibition was blocked by the addition of l-mevalonate or of geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, but not by cholesterol. Cell treatment with a geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor, but not a farnesyl transferase inhibitor, specifically inhibited entry of HIV-1-pseudotyped viruses. Statins blocked Rho-A activation induced by HIV-1 binding to target cells, and expression of the dominant negative mutant RhoN19 inhibited HIV-1 envelope fusion with target cell membranes, reducing cell infection rates. We suggest that statins have direct anti-HIV-1 effects by targeting Rho.",

In the present study, we hypothesised that the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor atorvastatin may up-regulate the tTgase expression in endothelial cells and thereby exert beneficial effects on endothelial function. Treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with atorvastatin (1-10 microM) caused a clear increased expression of tTgase in both permeabilised and non-permeabilised HUVEC. In contrast, stimulation of HUVEC with TNFalpha had no substantial effect on tTgase expression or localisation but inhibited the atorvastatin-induced up-regulation and externalisation of tTgase. Propidium iodide staining revealed that statin-induced apoptosis is not responsible for the enhanced expression. By inducing the expression of tTgase, statins may promote tTgase-mediated stabilisation of the basement membrane. This effect of atorvastatin may contribute to the beneficial role of statins on endothelial function.",

The use of insufficient doses, limited drug effectiveness and poor patient compliance may contribute to the treatment gap. Options for improving lipid management include dose titration, combination therapy or prescribing a more efficacious statin. LDL-C reductions are generally modest when patients' current statin dose is titrated, and there may be an increased potential for adverse effects. Combining statin therapy with another lipid-modifying agent can provide additional LDL-C reductions, but cost, tolerability and compliance should be considered. In general, switching to a more efficacious statin is a cost-effective way of enabling more patients to achieve recommended targets without increasing dosages. When considering the options available, physicians should balance efficacy, cost and safety to enable more patients to attain LDL-C goals and achieve greater therapeutic gain from statin treatment.",

It is based on the enhanced oxidation of lovastatin at a novel acetylene black-dihexadecyl hydrogen phosphate composite-modified glassy-carbon electrode (AB-DHP/GCE) in the presence of Triton X-100. This electrode was prepared by dispersion of acetylene black particles in an aqueous suspension of DHP and the formation of a stable film of the resulting AB-DHP composite on the surface of a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). As a result of modification of the AB-DHP composite, the electrochemical response of lovastatin at GCE was apparently enhanced; this was apparent as amplification of the oxidation current and the negative shift of the oxidation potential. The oxidation current can be further increased in the presence of a trace amount of Triton X-100. The enhanced oxidation of lovastatin at AB-DHP/GCE was due to enlargement of the effective electrode area, catalysis of lovastatin oxidation by AB, and accumulation of lovastatin at the hydrophobic surface of the DHP layer, which would be enhanced by the coherence with Triton X-100. The effects of some working conditions on the oxidation current of lovastatin were tested and the calibration plot was examined. The result showed that the oxidation current was a linear function of lovastatin concentration in the range 2.5 x 10(-8) - 1.0 x 10(-6) mol L(-1) and a low detection limit of 4.0 x 10(-9) mol L(-1) was obtained under optimum conditions.

The data associating high sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) to atherosclerotic vascular disease, especially coronary artery disease, are strong, consistent and have been tested across many populations. Multivariate analysis shows that hsCRP has an independent predictive value to the prediction of coronary artery disease along with the conventional cardiovascular risk factors such as sex, age, cigarette smoking, blood pressure, diabetes, elevated total cholesterol (or low density lipoprotein cholesterol) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol. Retrospective analysis of published clinical trials show that individuals with elevated hsCRP benefit from the use of acetylsalicylic acid and/or the statin class of medication. Before implementing a public health policy that includes the measurement and clinical decision-making algorithm using hsCRP, several conditions must be met. Among them, a better understanding of the biology of CRP, an indepth scrutiny at the link between hsCRP levels, the metabolic syndrome, and abdominal obesity and finally, clinical trials, currently underway that will test the hypothesis that patients with elevated levels of hsCRP but a normal low density lipoprotein-cholesterol benefit from a pharmacological intervention for cardiovascular prevention in a primary prevention setting.",

The link between elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and coronary heart disease (CHD) has been clearly established. However, triglycerides (TG) are increasingly believed to be independently associated with CHD, while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is inversely associated with CHD risk. High TG and low HDL often occur together, often with normal levels of LDL-C, and can be described as abnormalities of the TG-HDL axis. This lipid abnormality is a fundamental characteristic of patients with the metabolic syndrome, a condition strongly associated with the development of both type 2 diabetes and CHD. Patients with high TG and low HDL-C should be aggressively treated with therapeutic lifestyle changes. For high-risk patients, lipid-modifying therapy that specifically addresses the TG-HDL axis should also be considered. Current pharmacologic treatment options for such patients include statins, fibrates, niacin, fish oils, and combinations thereof. Several new pharmacologic approaches to treating the TG-HDL axis are currently being investigated. More clinical trial data is needed to test the hypothesis that pharmacologic therapy targeting the TG-HDL axis reduces atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events.", 
    "137": "Of the 60,000 patients receiving heart transplants between 1982 and 2001, approximately 12,000 are currently alive. The high incidence of hyperlipidemia and coronary disease (also known as accelerated graft atherosclerosis, or AGA) in these patients warrants early prophylaxis soon after transplantation with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG) Co-A reductase inhibitors (statins). Immunosuppressive agents such as prednisone, cyclosporine, mycophenylate mofetil, and sirolimus are associated with hyperlipidemia. Statins, in addition to lowering cholesterol levels, also benefit cardiac transplant recipients via effects on the immune system and endothelial function. Recent data have demonstrated that statins decrease AGA and mortality rates. Furthermore, greater benefits are seen when statins are started early. The 2 statins shown to decrease mortality in patients after cardiac transplantation are pravastatin and simvastatin, which differ in their metabolism (pravastatin is the only statin with non-cytochrome metabolism) and lipophilicity (pravastatin is less lipophilic). Although the benefit of simvastatin has been shown to extend to 8 years after transplantation, increased adverse effects in other studies with higher doses of simvastatin have resulted in new prescribing recommendations, which state that the dose of simvastatin should probably not exceed 10 mg with cyclosporine or gemfibrozil and 20 mg with amiodarone or verapamil. The evidence for potential benefits, interactions, and adverse effects of other potential lipid-lowering drugs for this patient population, such as fibrates, niacin, fish oil, cholestyramine, and ezetimibe, are also discussed.

Since DC might be related to the immunological processes in atherosclerosis (AS), we analyzed the emergence of DC and other inflammatory cells in different stages of AS. Serial cross-sections of 44 carotid specimens were immunohistochemically analyzed for the presence of DC, T cells, macrophages, and HLA-DR. Atherosclerotic specimens were histologically defined as initial lesions, advanced stable, or vulnerable plaques. In initial lesions significantly lower DC numbers were detected than in advanced plaques (P < 0.001). For advanced plaques, DC numbers were significantly higher in vulnerable than in stable plaques (P = 0.005). In contrast to initial lesions, approximately 70% of DC in advanced plaques exhibited a mature phenotype (CD83+, DC-LAMP+), indicating a functional activity of DC. In plaques of patients with acute ischemic symptoms DC numbers were markedly elevated (P = 0.03), whereas significantly lower DC numbers and more often a stable plaque morphology were detected in statin-treated patients (P = 0.02). DC clusters with a strong HLA-DR expression and frequent DC-T cell contacts were located particularly in the rupture-prone plaque regions and at complications. The results of the present study indicate that DC might contribute to plaque destabilization through an activation of T cells.", 
    "140": "The integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) (alphaLbeta2; CD11a/CD18) plays an important role in leukocyte migration and T cell activation. LFA-1 is inhibited by the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin, which binds to an allosteric site of the alphaL I domain termed the lovastatin site (L-site). Here we report for the first time the x-ray structures of the LFA-1 I domain complexed with derivatives of lovastatin optimized for LFA-1 inhibition. This analysis identified two new subpockets within the L-site occupied by chemical groups of the statin derivatives but not by lovastatin itself. Occupancy of these L-site subpockets led to distinct conformational changes in LFA-1, which were detectable by an epitope-monitoring assay. We utilized this assay to demonstrate improved LFA-1 inhibition in human blood in vitro and in blood samples from treated animals ex vivo. Moreover, we demonstrate that the novel lovastatin-derived LFA-1 inhibitor LFA878 exhibits potent anti-inflammatory effects in carrageenan-induced rat paw edema. In summary, the findings reported here extend the understanding of LFA-1 inhibition at the molecular level, allow for the identification and design of LFA-1 inhibitors of further enhanced potency, and support the expectation that LFA-1 inhibitors binding to the L-site will be of therapeutic value in treating inflammatory diseases.", 
    "141": "The effects of aging on angiogenesis (vascular sprouting) and vasculogenesis (endothelial precursor cell [EPC] incorporation into vessels) are not well known. We examined whether ischemia-induced angiogenesis/vasculogenesis is altered in klotho (kl) mutant mice, an animal model of typical aging.", 
    "142": "After unilateral hindlimb ischemia, laser Doppler blood-flow (LDBF) analysis revealed a decreased ischemic-normal LDBF ratio in kl mice. Tissue capillary density was also suppressed in kl mice (+/+>+/kl>kl/kl). Aortic-ring culture assay showed impaired angiogenesis in kl/kl mice, accompanied by reduced endothelium-derived nitric oxide release. Moreover, the rate of transplanted homologous bone marrow cells incorporated into capillaries in ischemic tissues (vasculogenesis) was lower in kl/kl mice than in wild-type (+/+) mice, which was associated with a decrease in the number of c-Kit+CD31+ EPC-like mononuclear cells in bone marrow and in peripheral blood. Finally, the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor cerivastatin restored the impaired neovascularization in kl/kl mice, accompanied by an increase in c-Kit+CD31+ cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood, and enhanced angiogenesis in the aortic-ring culture.",

The median survival was 2.9 years if patients were receiving statins or not (p = 0.573). There was also no significant difference in survival between patients with IPF receiving either ACEI or statins vs those receiving neither at the index visit (2.5 years vs 3 years, respectively; p = 0.066). After adjusting for age, gender, recommended IPF treatment, smoking status, prior oxygen use, FVC, diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, there were no differences in survival between those subjects receiving either ACEI, statins, or both vs neither.",

    "150": "Patients with New York Heart Association classes II to IV heart failure, already receiving optimized recommended therapy, will be recruited in a nation-wide network of more than 300 cardiology and internal medicine services to be randomly allocated to treatment with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (1 g daily) or the corresponding placebo. Patients with no clear indication or contraindication to cholesterol-lowering therapy will be further randomized to receive low-dose rosuvastatin (10 mg daily) or placebo. According to data available in heart failure registries, it is expected that 70% of the patients will be suitable to enter both components of the trial, which assume the same co-primary endpoints: (a) 15% reduction of all-cause mortality and (b) 20% reduction of all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospitalizations. The trial is event-driven and will continue either until at least 1252 deaths have been recorded or a reduction of all-cause mortality will satisfy the significance boundaries, which have been established to stop the study. The recruitment of the planned sample size of approximately 7000 patients randomized in the n-3 PUFA trial is expected to be completed within 18 months from the trial start. As of February 29, 2004, 4624 heart failure patients have been included in the trial.",

    "153": "We identified 66 consecutive patients who received a statin within 24 h of admission to our coronary care unit for myocardial infarction. Each statin patient was matched with three patients who had not received statin therapy (n=198). Statin patients were subgrouped into those receiving statin therapy at the time of infarction (n=44) and those initiated on statin therapy within 24 h of infarction (n=22). Peak total creatine kinase concentrations were compared between groups. A linear regression model was developed to test for differences in peak creatine kinase after adjusting for differences between groups.",

Subgroup analysis revealed that the lower peak creatine kinase concentrations within the statin group were a result of lower creatine kinase concentrations in those patients on a statin at the time of myocardial infarction (399 IU/l [255, 869] vs. 678 IU/l [276, 1870]; p<0.05). This difference retained statistical significance after adjustment for differences between groups.",

    "156": "Vascular imaging techniques enable identification of atherosclerosis in the sub-clinical phase and allow assessment of interventions to modify disease progression. Angiography has limited utility for tracking the progression of atherosclerosis because of its invasive nature, limited sensitivity for detecting early lesions and relatively low interscan reproducibility. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)an electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) are more sensitive and reproducible; however, available data on their ability for tracking disease progression are few. Measurement of carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) by B-mode ultrasound is a well-validated procedure for this application. In comparison with angiography, CIMT demonstrates greater sensitivity for detecting early atherosclerosis and lipid-rich plaques that are vulnerable to rupture. Continued validation and development of imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), will facilitate the assessment of atherosclerosis progression in intervention studies. Stains are effective low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering agents, and imaging studies have demonstrated their ability to slow progression and promote regression of atherosclerosis. The benefits of therapy on atherosclerosis regression appear to extend to soft atherosclerotic plaques that are still developing and treatment effects are independent of baseline LDL-C level. Hence, imaging studies support early intervention with statins in coronary heart disease patients, irrespective of lipid level."
