Histopathological analysis showed that ATV 27 mg/kg prevented ABL and cemental resorption, and inflammatory cell infiltration induced by ligature. ATV (27 mg/kg) prevented serum BALP levels reduction. ATV (27 mg/kg) prevented leukocytosis and did not affect either kidney or liver function nor body mass weight. ATV showed a protecting effect in the ligature-induced periodontitis, without affecting system parameters, by inhibition of inflammatory process and by its anabolic activity on the alveolar bone.",

Guidelines of the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) 2013 and the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP-III) differ in their strategies to recommend initiation of statin therapy. The presence of carotid plaque (CP) by carotid ultrasound is an indication to begin statin therapy. We aimed to compare the recommendation to initiate statin therapy according to the ACC/AHA 2013 guidelines, ATP-III guidelines, and CP by carotid ultrasound. We then carried out an observational, cross-sectional study of 62 statin-naive Mexican mestizo RA patients, aged 40 to 75, who fulfilled the 1987 or 2010 ACR/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria.

Among the new LDL-lowering therapies, PCSK9 inhibitors appear the most promising class. Genetic studies suggest that triglyceride-rich lipoproteins are associated with cardiovascular risk and several promising triglyceride-lowering therapies are at various stages of development. At the opposite end, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol seems to not be causally associated with cardiovascular risk, and thus far, trials designed to reduce cardiovascular risk by mainly raising HDL cholesterol levels have been disappointing.

    "31": "Neuropathic pain occurs due to deleterious changes in the nervous system caused by a lesion or dysfunction. Currently, neuropathic pain management is unsatisfactory and remains a challenge in clinical practice. Studies have suggested that actin cytoskeleton remodeling may be associated with neural plasticity and may involve a nociceptive mechanism. Here, we found that the RhoA/LIM kinase (LIMK)/cofilin pathway, which regulates actin dynamics, was activated after chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve. Treatments that reduced RhoA/LIMK/cofilin pathway activity, including simvastatin, the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632, and the synthetic peptide Tat-S3, attenuated actin filament disruption in the dorsal root ganglion and CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Over-activation of the cytoskeleton caused by RhoA/LIMK/cofilin pathway activation may produce a scaffold for the trafficking of nociceptive signaling factors, leading to chronic neuropathic pain. Here, we found that simvastatin significantly decreased the ratio of membrane/cytosolic RhoA, which was significantly increased after CCI, by inhibiting the RhoA/LIMK/cofilin pathway. This effect was highly dependent on the function of the cytoskeleton as a scaffold for signal trafficking. We conclude that simvastatin attenuated neuropathic pain in rats subjected to CCI by inhibiting actin-mediated intracellular trafficking to suppress RhoA/LIMK/cofilin pathway activity.",

    "36": "Disorders of lipid metabolism play a major role in the development and progression of coronary artery disease. Dyslipidemia therefore plays a central role in therapeutic approaches for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular events associated with coronary artery disease. Epidemiological studies have shown an association between various lipid metabolism parameters, the risk of developing coronary artery disease and progression of a pre-existing disease. In particular, increased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), reduced levels of HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), as well as high levels of triglycerides and increased lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels can be taken into account when assessing the risk stratification of patients for primary prevention of coronary artery disease. Lifestyle and dietary changes, intensified statin therapy and possibly the addition of ezetimibe remain the major interventions in both primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease, as they improve the prognosis particularly by lowering levels of LDL-C. Recently, genetic studies have contributed to extending our understanding of the relationship between lipid metabolism and coronary artery disease. A causal role for progression of coronary artery disease could be demonstrated for LDL-C, Lpa and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL), which could not be demonstrated for HDL-C in various studies. Furthermore, the effect of reduction of LDL-C by proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibition and by the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor anacetrapib on cardiovascular events is currently being investigated in large clinical outcome study programs.", 
    "37": "Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) binds to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors leading to their degradation in the liver. Inhibition of PCSK9 leads to an increase in LDL receptors and as a result to a reduction of LDL cholesterol in blood. Currently, two antibodies against PCSK9 are available for clinical treatment in Germany, evolocumab (Repatha\u00ae) and alirocumab (Praluent\u00ae). Clinical studies have shown that treatment with these antibodies, which must be subcutaneously injected by patients every 2 or 4 weeks, in addition to an already existing lipid therapy can lower the LDL cholesterol level in blood by an average of 50-60\u2009%. Data from previous study programs show that this treatment is safe although long-term data are still lacking. The results of currently running cardiovascular endpoint studies are not yet available, whereby a beneficial effect is to be expected after the preliminary analyses. These novel effective therapy approaches open up new perspectives for the treatment of patients whose LDL cholesterol values are still in excess of the corresponding target values despite previous maximum lipid-reducing therapy and suffer from a preexisting cardiovascular disease, statin intolerance, genetic forms of familiar hypercholesterolemia and patients on LDL apheresis.", 
    "38": "Lowering plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels to individual therapeutic goals is one of the most effective measures for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Besides dietary measures, this can be achieved pharmaceutically by inhibition of hepatic cholesterol synthesis with statins or inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption (e.g., ezetimibe and bile acid sequestrants). Decisive for lowering LDL is an increased hepatic uptake of circulating LDL via an increase in LDL receptors (LDLR) in hepatic cell membranes. The formation of new LDLR and recirculation of existing LDLR play a decisive role in this process. An important modulator of LDLR is proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). In the last years genetic studies have identified several mutations in the PCSK9 gene leading to a gain of function and carriers of these mutations suffer from autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia. In contrast, carriers of PCSK9 loss of function mutations show very low plasma LDL-C concentrations and a markedly reduced risk for coronary artery disease. These fundamental discoveries have sparked the development of a completely novel therapeutic approach to treating hypercholesterolemia. At present, inhibition of PCSK9 by monoclonal antibodies presents the most promising therapeutic approach. First human antibodies were recently approved as the first immunotherapeutic agents for the treatment of severe hypercholesterolemia and in patients with statin intolerance. An additional PCSK9 antibody is presently being studied in phase\u00a0III clinical trials.",

Statins inhibit the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol synthesis, HMG-CoA-reductase, and reduce serum cholesterol concentrations as well as cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Some studies indicate that patients with high baseline cholesterol absorption may show only a small response to statin treatment in terms of cholesterol lowering. Data from genetic association studies and from the IMPROVE-IT trial show that reducing intestinal cholesterol absorption via NCP1L1 further reduces cardiovascular risk. However, some patients do not attain LDL-cholesterol targets on combination therapy. For these patients PCSK9-antibody treatment and lipid-apheresis are options to be considered.

Statins can decrease these without the clinician being aware from routine biochemistry. In type 2 diabetes, HDL cholesterol levels are often reduced, whereas in type 1, insulin can raise HDL, but its antiatherogenic properties are compromised. Dyslipidaemia and hypertension predate the onset of glycaemia of diabetic proportions (metabolic syndrome). Obese people can thus die of diabetes before they develop it. Obesity should be prevented and treated. Statins decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease in diabetes or metabolic syndrome regardless of whether glycaemia worsens.",

Therefore, a nanosuspension (NS) was developed as an efficient strategy to improve its oral bioavailability. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of LOV-NS, a novel, sensitive, and rapid UPLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of LOV and its metabolite lovastatin acid (LOVA) in rat plasma. Simvastatin (IS) was chosen as the internal standard, and a liquid-liquid extraction method was used to isolate LOV and LOVA from biological matrices. The analytes were analyzed on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column, and a gradient program was applied at a flow rate of 0.2mL/min. Then, a tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer coupled with a positive/negative ion-switching electrospray ionization interface was employed to detect the analytes. Quantitation of the analytes was performed in the multiple reaction monitoring mode to monitor the transitions of m/z 427.1\u2192325.0 for LOV and m/z 441.1\u2192325.0 for IS in the positive ion mode and m/z 421.0\u2192101.0 for LOVA in the negative ion mode, respectively.

Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted. PubMed and EMBASE were searched for studies providing the risk ratio (RR) on statins and PLC risk. Summary RRs were calculated using a random-effects model. Twenty-five studies were identified. Stain use was significantly associated with a reduced risk of PLC (RR\u2009=\u20090.60, 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u20090.53-0.69).

Several epidemiologic studies report an association between cancer and serum cholesterol levels or statin use, while others suggest that there is not one. Furthermore, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project using next-generation sequencing has profiled the mutational status and expression levels of all the genes in diverse cancers, including those involved in cholesterol metabolism, providing correlative support for a role of the cholesterol pathway in cancer development. Finally, preclinical studies tend to more consistently support the role of cholesterol in cancer, with several demonstrating that cholesterol homeostasis genes can modulate development. Because of space limitations, this review provides selected examples of the epidemiologic, TCGA, and preclinical data, focusing on alterations in cholesterol homeostasis and its consequent effect on patient survival. In melanoma, this focused analysis demonstrated that enhanced expression of cholesterol synthesis genes was associated with decreased patient survival. Collectively, the studies in melanoma and other cancer types suggested a potential role of disrupted cholesterol homeostasis in cancer development but additional studies are needed to link population-based epidemiological data, the TCGA database results, and preclinical mechanistic evidence to concretely resolve this controversy.

Statins are the primary class of agents used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Although statins are effective for many patients, they fail to achieve optimal reduction in lipids for some patients, including those who have or are at high risk for cardiovascular disease. The PCSK9 gene was identified in the past decade as a potential therapeutic target for the management of patients with hypercholesterolemia. Pharmacologic interventions to decrease PCSK9 levels are in development, with the most promising approach using monoclonal antibodies that bind to PCSK9 in the plasma. Two monoclonal antibodies, alirocumab and evolocumab, have recently been approved for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, and a third one, bococizumab, is in phase 3 clinical development. All 3 agents achieve significant reductions in levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, as well as reductions in non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and lipoprotein(a). Long-term outcome trials are under way to determine the sustained efficacy, safety, and tolerability of PCSK9 inhibitors and whether this novel class of agents decreases the risk for major cardiovascular events in patients on lipid-modifying therapy. Available data suggest that PCSK9 inhibitors provide a robust reduction in atherogenic cholesterol levels with a good safety profile, especially for patients who fail to obtain an optimal clinical response to statin therapy, those who are statin intolerant or have contraindications to statin therapy, and those with familial hypercholesterolemia.",

Rat cardiomyocytes were randomly divided into seven groups: normal controls (NC), PTH1-34 (10(-7)\u2009mol/L), Ator (10(-5)\u2009mol/L), farnesyl transferase inhibitors-276 (FTI-276, 4\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-5)\u2009mol/L), PTH1-34\u2009+\u2009Ator, PTH1-34\u2009+\u2009FTI-276 and PTH1-34\u2009+\u2009Ator\u2009+\u2009mevalonic acid (MVA, 10(-4)\u2009mol/L). After treatment, the hypertrophic responses of cardiomyocytes were assessed by measuring cell diameter, detecting protein synthesis, and single-cell protein content. The concentrations of hypertrophic markers such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) were measured by ELISA. Protein expressions of ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2 and Ras were detected by western blotting. The results showed that compared with the PTH1-34 group, cellular diameter, 3H-leucine incorporation, single-cell protein content, ANP and BNP concentration decreased by 12.07\u2009\u00b5m, 1622\u2009cpm/well, 84.34 pg, 7.13\u2009ng/L and 20.04\u2009\u00b5g/L, respectively, and the expressions of Ras and p-ERK1/2 were downregulated in PTH1-34\u2009+\u2009Ator group (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Compared to the PTH1-34\u2009+\u2009Ator group, the corresponding hypertrophic responses and hypertrophic markers increased by 4.95\u2009\u00b5m, 750\u2009cpm/well, 49.08 pg, 3.12\u2009ng/L and 9.35\u2009\u00b5g/L, respectively, and the expressions of Ras and p-ERK1/2 were upregulated in the PTH1-34\u2009+\u2009Ator\u2009+\u2009MVA group (P\u2009<\u20090.05). In conclusion, Ator prevents neonatal rat CMH induced by PTH1-34 and Ras-ERK signaling may be involved in this process.", 
    "165": "At present, the guideline approach to the medical treatment and prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is to classify patients by risk and treat the known risk factors (contributory causes), e.g., hypertension, diabetes, obesity, smoking, and poor diet, as appropriate. All high-risk patients should receive statins. This approach has had substantial success but ASCVD still remains the number one cause of death in the United States. Until recently, the underlying cause of ASCVD remained unknown, although a potential dietary cause was suggested by the fact that vegetarians, especially vegans, have a much lower incidence of ASCVD than animal flesh eaters. Recently, consistent with the vegetarian data, substantial evidence for a cause of ASCVD in animals and humans has been discovered. Trimethylamine (TMA)-containing dietary compounds in meat, milk, and other animal foods (e.g., lecithin, choline, and carnitine) are converted by closely related gut bacterial TMA lyases to TMA, which is absorbed and converted predominantly by flavin mono-oxygenase 3 to the toxic trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). TMAO causes atherosclerosis in animals and is elevated in patients with coronary heart disease. Inhibition of bacterial lyases in mice prevents TMA and secondarily TMAO formation and atherosclerosis, strong evidence for the TMAO hypothesis. At present, the challenge for the pharmaceutical industry is to discover and develop a potent \"broad spectrum\" bacterial lyase inhibitor that, along with diet and exercise, could, if the TMAO hypothesis is correct, revolutionize the preventive treatment of ASCVD.",

Recently, we documented nanomedicinal delivery of the anti-inflammatory compound prednisolone to atherosclerotic plaque macrophages in patients, which did however not translate into therapeutic efficacy. This unanticipated finding calls for in-depth screening of drugs intended for targeting plaque macrophages.",

Using this in vitro approach, we observed that the anti-inflammatory effect of prednisolone was counterbalanced by multiple adverse effects on other key pathways. Conversely, pterostilbene, T0901317 and simvastatin had an overall anti-atherogenic effect on multiple pathways, suggesting their potential for liposomal delivery.",

More men had primary closure, but other demographic and baseline symptoms were similar between groups. Half the patients had PAC, with the rest evenly distributed between PRC and EVC. The rate of nerve injury was 2.7%, the rate of reintervention for hematoma was 1.5%, and the length of hospital stay was 2.4\u00a0\u00b1 3.0\u00a0days, with no significant differences among groups. The combined stroke and death rate was 2.5% overall and 3.9% and 1.7% in the symptomatic and asymptomatic cohort, respectively.

    "173": "Statins are said to protect against a wide range of diseases. We studied to what extent potential bias influences the results of studies on beneficial side effects of statins. We selected 8,188 atrial fibrillation patients who started treatment with anticoagulants at the Leiden Anticoagulation Clinic in the Netherlands between 2003 and 2009 and experienced 1,683 minor and 451 major bleeds during 18,105 person-years of follow-up. Statins were associated with a risk reduction of 9% for bleeds (hazard ratio = 0.91, 95% confidence interval: 0.82, 1.00). Additionally, analyses were stratified by age, incident users (patients who started statins during follow-up, i.e., an inception cohort), and prevalent statin users (statin users at baseline), as restriction to incident users avoids overoptimistic risk estimates. After stratification, the protective associations disappeared or reversed (range of hazard ratios = 0.99-3.22), except for patients aged 75 years or older. This remaining association could be due to another bias as, according to guidelines, in the elderly, statins should be prescribed only to those with a reasonable life expectancy. This could have resulted in a comparison of fit statin users with less fit nonstatin users (healthy user effect). The apparent protective association of statins on bleeds may be due to bias. We recommend stratification by age and incident and prevalent statin use when studying associations of statins with disease outcomes to avoid overoptimistic risk estimates.", 
    "174": "To compare impact of incident diabetes on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk among postmenopausal women according to statin use. Prospective data from 120,499 postmenopausal women without prevalent diabetes or cardiovascular disease at baseline from the Women's Health Initiative were used. Incident diabetes was self-reported annually and defined as treatment with pills or injectable medication for diabetes. Current statin use was determined at enrollment and years 1, 3, 6, 9 and 13.5 in the three clinical trial arms, and at baseline, year 3, and 13.5 for the observational study. The primary outcome was incident ASCVD events, self-reported annually and adjudicated by blinded local and central physicians. Incident diabetes and statin use status were fitted as time-varying covariates in Cox regression models to assess ASCVD risk during an average follow-up of 13.6\u00a0years. For those not on statins at the time of diabetes diagnosis, there was a 42\u00a0% increased risk of ASCVD [hazard ratio (HR) 1.42, 95\u00a0% CI 1.28-1.58] among women with incident diabetes versus those without diabetes. Among women on statins, there was a 39\u00a0% increased risk of ASCVD (HR 1.39, 95\u00a0% CI 1.12-1.74) in women with incident diabetes versus those without diabetes. The increased ASCVD risk due to diabetes was similar between women before or after initiating statins (P\u00a0=\u00a00.89). Whether diabetes was diagnosed before or after statin use did not alter the increased risk of ASCVD associated with diabetes. Mitigating the increased incidence of diabetes in statin users could increase the ASCVD benefit-to-risk ratio of statins.", 
    "175": "Some therapeutic and/or adverse effects of drugs may be related to their effects on mitochondrial function. The effects of simvastatin, resveratrol, coenzyme Q10, acetylcysteine, and acetylcarnitine on Complex I-, Complex II-, or Complex IV-linked respiratory rate were determined in isolated brain mitochondria. The protective effects of these biologically active compounds on the calcium-induced decrease of the respiratory rate were also studied. We observed a significant inhibitory effect of simvastatin on mitochondrial respiration (IC50 = 24.0 \u03bcM for Complex I-linked respiration, IC50 = 31.3 \u03bcM for Complex II-linked respiration, and IC50 = 42.9 \u03bcM for Complex IV-linked respiration); the inhibitory effect of resveratrol was found at very high concentrations (IC50 = 162 \u03bcM for Complex I-linked respiration, IC50 = 564 \u03bcM for Complex II-linked respiration, and IC50 = 1454 \u03bcM for Complex IV-linked respiration). Concentrations required for effective simvastatin- or resveratrol-induced inhibition of mitochondrial respiration were found much higher than concentrations achieved under standard dosing of these drugs. Acetylcysteine and acetylcarnitine did not affect the oxygen consumption rate of mitochondria. Coenzyme Q10 induced an increase of Complex I-linked respiration. The increase of free calcium ions induced partial inhibition of the Complex I+II-linked mitochondrial respiration, and all tested drugs counteracted this inhibition. None of the tested drugs showed mitochondrial toxicity (characterized by respiratory rate inhibition) at drug concentrations achieved at therapeutic drug intake. Resveratrol, simvastatin, and acetylcarnitine had the greatest neuroprotective potential (characterized by protective effects against calcium-induced reduction of the respiratory rate).", 
    "176": "In 2015 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first two proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, alirocumab (Praluent\u00ae; Sanofi/ Regeneron) and evolocumab (Repatha\u00ae; Amgen), for use in patients with heterozygous and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and for patients intolerant of statins or those with a major risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) but unable to lower their LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) to optimal levels with statins and ezetimibe. Numerous randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that these inhibitors cause a fall in LDL-C levels of 50-60% as well as causing a decline in lipoprotein(a) and an increase in HDL cholesterol. They are effective in reducing levels of LDL-C to 1.8 mmol/L or less in almost all patients in the groups listed above except for those with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. In the latter case, many patients will still have LDL-C levels well above optimal levels despite the use of statins and a PCSK9 inhibitor. To date these inhibitors have not caused major adverse effects. However, the results of ongoing long-term randomized clinical trials are needed to determine whether they cause a significant reduction in CVD events including deaths from CVD. These studies will also demonstrate whether the PCSK9 inhibitors have any unexpected adverse effects and/or effects resulting from the loss of PCSK9 functions at other sites in the body, in particular regarding neurocognition. A further major concern is the high cost of PCSK9 inhibitors and their effect on healthcare costs and health insurance premiums.", 
    "177": "Fetoplacental glucocorticoid overexposure is a significant mechanism underlying fetal growth restriction and the programming of adverse health outcomes in the adult. Placental glucocorticoid inactivation by 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11\u03b2-HSD2) plays a key role. We previously discovered that Hsd11b2(-/-) mice, lacking 11\u03b2-HSD2, show marked underdevelopment of the placental vasculature. We now explore the consequences for fetal cardiovascular development and whether this is reversible. We studied Hsd11b2(+/+), Hsd11b2(+/-), and Hsd11b2(-/-) littermates from heterozygous (Hsd11b(+/-)) matings at embryonic day (E)14.5 and E17.5, where all three genotypes were present to control for maternal effects. Using high-resolution ultrasound, we found that umbilical vein blood velocity in Hsd11b2(-/-) fetuses did not undergo the normal gestational increase seen in Hsd11b2(+/+) littermates. Similarly, the resistance index in the umbilical artery did not show the normal gestational decline. Surprisingly, given that 11\u03b2-HSD2 absence is predicted to initiate early maturation, the E/A wave ratio was reduced at E17.5 in Hsd11b2(-/-) fetuses, suggesting impaired cardiac function. Pravastatin administration from E6.5, which increases placental vascular endothelial growth factor A and, thus, vascularization, increased placental fetal capillary volume, ameliorated the aberrant umbilical cord velocity, normalized fetal weight, and improved the cardiac function of Hsd11b2(-/-) fetuses. This improved cardiac function occurred despite persisting indications of increased glucocorticoid exposure in the Hsd11b2(-/-) fetal heart. Thus, the pravastatin-induced enhancement of fetal capillaries within the placenta and the resultant hemodynamic changes correspond with restored fetal cardiac function. Statins may represent a useful therapeutic approach to intrauterine growth retardation due to placental vascular hypofunction.", 
    "178": "Epidemiologic and clinical studies suggest that elevated triglyceride levels are a biomarker of cardiovascular (CV) risk. Consistent with these findings, recent genetic evidence from mutational analyses, genome-wide association studies, and Mendelian randomization studies provide robust evidence that triglycerides and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins are in the causal pathway for atherosclerotic CV disease, indicating that they may play a pathogenic role, much like low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Although statins are the cornerstone of dyslipidemia management, high triglyceride levels may persist in some patients despite statin therapy. Several triglyceride-lowering agents are available, including fibrates, niacin, and omega-3 fatty acids, of which prescription omega-3 fatty acids have the best tolerability and safety profile. In clinical studies, omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to reduce triglyceride levels, but products containing both eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid may increase LDL-C levels. Icosapent ethyl, a high-purity eicosapentaenoic acid-only product, does not raise LDL-C levels and also reduces triglyceride, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride-rich lipoprotein levels. In conclusion, omega-3 fatty acids are currently being evaluated in large CV outcome studies in statin-treated patients; these studies should help to elucidate the causative role of triglycerides in atherosclerotic CV disease.", 
    "179": "Peripheral artery disease (PAD) comprises atherosclerosis of the aorta and lower extremities. Many patients with PAD are asymptomatic, while others present with intermittent claudication (IC) or critical limb ischemia (CLI). Defined as rest pain or tissue loss that persists for >2\u00a0weeks, CLI represents the most severe clinical manifestation of PAD and is associated with an increased risk of limb loss and death. Patients with PAD, including those with CLI, are underdiagnosed and undertreated. In addition to smoking cessation, medical therapy with an antiplatelet agent and statin is recommended for all patients with PAD. Regular exercise has been shown to improve walking distance and quality of life in patients with symptomatic PAD and should be incorporated into each patient's treatment plan. In patients who have CLI and in those with persistent lifestyle-limiting claudication despite optimal medical therapy and an exercise program, revascularization is indicated for limb salvage and symptom relief, respectively. Consensus guidelines currently support an endovascular first approach to revascularization in the majority of cases. Surgical procedures provide an alternative to endovascular therapy in select cases.",

A total of 96 patients who had not received statins were treated with pitavastatin (N to P group). A total of 100 patients who had previously used atorvastatin were switched to pitavastatin (A to P group). A total of 144 patients continued with atorvastatin treatment. Data were collected at baseline, 3 and 6 months of treatment. Changes in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level were analyzed in 222 patients who did not change their antidiabetic agent during 6 months of treatment.",

The correlation remained similar after adjusting for age, body mass index, dose of pitavastatin, estimated glomerular filtration rate and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. After 6 months of treatment, the benefit of pitavastatin on HbA1c in the patients with poorly controlled diabetes was significant in both the N to P (8.1 vs 7.4%, P = 0.018) and A to P (9.7 vs 9.0%, P = 0.015) groups.",

In the present study, we investigated the antiproliferative effects of the combination of zoledronic acid (ZOL), a bisphophosphonate, and fluvastatin (FLU), a statin, in vitro on two types of human pancreatic cancer cell lines, Mia PaCa-2 and Suit-2. The pancreatic cancer cell lines were treated with ZOL and FLU both individually and in combination to evaluate their antiproliferative effects using WST-8 cell proliferation assay. In this study, we demonstrated a potent synergistic antiproliferative effect of both drugs when used in combination in both cell lines. Moreover, we studied the molecular mechanism behind this synergistic effect, which was inhibited by the addition of the mevalonate pathway products, farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). Furthermore, we aimed to determine the effect of ZOL and FLU combination on RhoA and Ras guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP)-proteins. The combination induced a marked accumulation in RhoA and unprenylated Ras. GGPP and FPP reversed the increase in the amount of both proteins. These results indicated that the combination treatment impaired RhoA and Ras signaling pathway by the inhibition of geranylgeranylation and/or farnesylation. This study provides a potentially effective approach for the treatment of pancreatic cancer using a combination treatment of ZOL and FLU.", 
    "185": "Statins are increasingly widely used in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disorders, including ischemic stroke. The initial studies regarded mainly coronary heart disease, but recently more attention has been paid to statin use in ischemic stroke, including primary and secondary prevention as well as the acute phase treatment. Besides their main hypolipemic activity, statins have been proved to have immunomodulating properties that are called a pleiotropic effect. Drug metabolism is under genetic influence, exemplified by the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). This also applies to statins. Pharmacogenetic studies are conducted in many disorders including stroke. The aim of this study was to review selected common genetic variants in lipid or statin metabolism-related genes and indicate associations with cardiovascular disorders, especially with ischemic stroke. We present available data of SNPs in regard to the most significant and promising proteins such as cytochrome P450, ATPase superfamily, organic anion transporter family, apolipoprotein E, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2, lipoprotein(a), LDLR, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, HMGCR, and CETP.

    "186": "Evidence suggests that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, or statins, may reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Statin action in patients with AD, as in those with heart disease, is likely to be at least partly independent of the effects of statins on cholesterol. Statins can alter cellular signaling and protein trafficking through inhibition of isoprenylation of Rho, Cdc42, and Rab family GTPases. The effects of statins on protein isoprenylation in vivo, particularly in the central nervous system, are poorly studied. We utilized two-dimensional gel electrophoresis approaches to directly monitor the levels of isoprenylated and non-isoprenylated forms of Rho and Rab family GTPases. We report that simvastatin significantly inhibits RhoA and Rab4, and Rab6 isoprenylation at doses as low as 50nM in vitro. We also provide the first in vivo evidence that statins inhibit the isoprenylation of RhoA in the brains of rats and RhoA, Cdc42, and H-Ras in the brains of mice treated with clinically relevant doses of simvastatin.",

Further in\u00a0vivo studies of feeding high fat (30%) to rats increased body weights, serum TC, TG, non-HDL-C and reduced HDL-C were observed, compared to normal diet fed group (ND). ORZ treated groups alleviated the lipid profile. Furthermore, increased organ weights, higher intestinal lipase activity, and liver lipid peroxidation was observed in the high-fat group (HF). These effects were ameliorated in oryzanol concentrate fed groups (ORZ). Higher fecal fat was found in ORZ groups, analysis of fecal matter by mass spectroscopy revealed the presence of FA. In\u00a0vitro, a bile acid binding study supported the strong affinity of sterol towards bile acids. In conclusion, oryzanol in the intestine is cleaved into FA and sterol by intestinal lipase enzymes both lipase and HMG-CoA reductase activities were inhibited, respectively. These hydrolysates eliminated the bile acids, thus lowering lipid profiles.",

Both statin medications and aspirin hold class I indications for all post-CABG patients and should be continued indefinitely unless contraindications exist. Unfortunately, there are limited data regarding long-term usage of these essential medications. We assessed the utilization rates of statins and aspirin among post-CABG patients referred for coronary angiography. Analysis of post-CABG patients presenting to Thomas Jefferson University for a cardiac catheterization procedure at least 3\u00a0years after surgery was performed. Inpatient and outpatient records were reviewed to assess prescribing patterns of these medications, as well as other pertinent clinical and laboratory data. The study population was 381 consecutive patients presenting at a mean of 11 \u00b1 6\u00a0years from CABG. Mean age was 69 \u00b1 11\u00a0years and 78% were men. A total 67% of patients were being prescribed a statin, whereas 75% were prescribed aspirin. Only 52% were prescribed both at the time of catheterization. Patients prescribed a statin had a significantly lower mean low-density lipoprotein (87 vs 106 [p <0.01]) and total cholesterol values (151 vs 162 [p <0.01]). A total of 35% of patients had low-density lipoprotein \u2265100. Only 43% of saphenous vein grafts in the patients not on statin medications remained patent.

Low-level evidence based on case reports suggests that statins may adversely affect memory, a significant consumer concern. In this review, the published evidence on statins and memory in the elderly in randomized controlled trials and prospective observational cohort studies was examined in detail. Overall, there was moderate-strength evidence that statin therapy did not increase the risk of dementia in the elderly and low-strength evidence for no increased risk for Alzheimer's disease. Further, there was moderate-strength evidence that statin therapy in the elderly did not increase the risk for mild cognitive impairment or worsen global cognitive performance in the cognitively intact or impaired. There was moderate-strength evidence for no deterioration of memory function in the elderly. On balance, there was a moderate level of evidence of neither harm nor benefit on memory; however, the published literature contains a number of deficiencies that are detailed in this review, not limited to selection biases and deficiencies of detailed testing.",

They inhibit the enzyme \"HMG CoA reductase\" and the expression of this enzyme in cancer cells has been implicated as a favorable prognostic factor in patients with breast cancer. After a search of MEDLINE and Embase from inception through November 2015, 817 abstracts were reviewed to identify studies that described an association between statin use and outcomes in breast cancer. A total of 14 studies which included 75,684 women were identified. In a meta-analysis of 10 studies, statin use was associated with improved recurrence-free survival (RFS; HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.53-0.79, I(2) \u2009=\u200944%). Furthermore, this RFS benefit appeared to be confined to use of lipophilic statins (HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.59-0.89) as hydrophilic statin use was not associated with improvement in RFS (HR 0.80; 95% CI 0.44-1.46). Statin users similarly showed improved overall survival in a meta-analysis with substantial heterogeneity (8 studies, HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.44-0.99, I(2) \u2009=\u200989%). Statin users also had improved cancer-specific survival, although this relationship was measured with less precision (six studies, HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.46-1.06, I(2) \u2009=\u200986%). In conclusion, breast cancer patients who use statins, or specifically, lipophilic statins show improved recurrence-free survival. Statin users also had improved overall survival and cancer-specific survival. These findings should be assessed in a prospective randomized cohort and the choice of statin, dose and biomarkers that may predict the efficacy of these drugs should be identified.",

We used metabolomics to determine whether a sex difference in plasma amino acids, acylcarnitines, and organic acids predictive of diabetes and impaired energy metabolism is present in HIV-infected persons on long-term ART.We enrolled 70 HIV-infected adults (43% women) on efavirenz, tenofovir, and emtricitabine (Atripla) with HIV-1 RNA <50\u200acopies/mL for over 2 years. Half of the HIV-infected subjects were obese, and these were matched with 30 obese HIV-negative controls. All subjects had no history of diabetes, statin use, or heavy alcohol use. Fasting insulin sensitivity was measured using homeostatic model assessment 2 (HOMA2), and adipose tissue was measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry was used to quantitate fasting plasma branched chain and aromatic amino acids predictive of incident diabetes, and C3 and C5 acylcarnitinines and organic acids indicative of impaired energy metabolism.HIV-infected women had more baseline risk factors for insulin resistance: women were older (46 vs 44 years) and had a longer ART duration (8.4 vs 5.1 years, P\u200a<\u200a0.05 for both) compared with men but had similar CD4+ count (median 701\u200acells/\u03bcL), smoking and hepatic C prevalence, and body mass index (BMI) (median 30.3\u200akg/m). However, women had higher insulin sensitivity compared with men (P\u200a<\u200a0.01), and lower plasma levels of isoleucine, leucine, valine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine (P\u200a<\u200a0.01 for all), and lower C3 and C5 acylcarnitines (P\u200a<\u200a0.01 for all), in multivariable regression models after adjusting for DEXA fat mass index, age, race, CD4+ count, smoking, and ART duration. In the obese HIV-infected subjects and HIV-negative controls, the relationship of sex and plasma metabolite levels did not significantly differ according to HIV-status.HIV-infected women on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based ART had superior glucose tolerance and lower plasma metabolites associated with the development of diabetes compared with men with similar metabolic disease risk profiles. The relationship between sex and plasma metabolite levels did not significantly differ according to HIV-status among obese subjects, suggesting the observed sex-differences may not be specific to HIV infection.",

Recent observational studies raised the possibility that the use of statins may reduce overall mortality in various types of cancer. We investigated whether statins used after pancreatic cancer diagnosis are associated with longer survival in pancreatic cancer patients.We retrospectively analyzed data from 1761 patients newly diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2014. We used the time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression model to estimate mortality among pancreatic cancer patients according to statin use.Among the 1761 pancreatic cancer patients, 118 patients had used statins. During the study period, 1176 patients (66.7%) died. After adjusting for age, sex, location of cancer, cancer stage, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, alcohol use, body mass index, and CA 19-9, statin use was associated with a lower risk of cancer death (hazard ratio [HR], 0.780; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.617-0.986), especially among simvastatin users (HR, 0.554; 95% CI, 0.312-0.982) and atorvastatin users (HR, 0.636; 95% CI, 0.437-0.927). Subgroup analysis showed that overall survival was statistically significantly longer in patients with nonmetastatic pancreatic cancer (log-rank P\u200a=\u200a0.024).We found that the use of simvastatin and atorvastatin after cancer diagnosis is associated with longer survival in patients with nonmetastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.",

The model was based on 8 clinical predictors including treatment allocation (statin/placebo). Ten-year individualized ARR on major cardiovascular events by statin therapy were calculated for each patient by subtracting the estimated on-treatment risk from the estimated off-treatment risk. Predicted 10-year ARR by statin therapy was <2% for 13% of the patients. About 30% had an ARR of >4% (median ARR, 3.2%; interquartile range, 2.5%-4.3%; 95% confidence interval for 3.2% ARR, -1.4% to 6.8%). Addition of treatment interactions did not improve model performance. Therefore, the wide distribution in ARR was a consequence of the underlying distribution in cardiovascular risk enrolled in these trials. External validation of the model was performed in data from the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT-LLT; pravastatin 40 mg versus usual care) and Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS; atorvastatin 10 mg versus placebo) of 3878 and 2838 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, respectively.

We further tested the clinical implication of statin therapy based on troponin concentration in 12 956 individuals free of cardiovascular disease in the JUPITER study. Troponin I remained an independent predictor with a hazard ratio of 1.37 for cardiovascular mortality, 1.23 for cardiovascular disease, and 1.24 for total mortality. The addition of troponin I information to a prognostic model for cardiovascular death constructed of ESC SCORE variables increased the C-index discrimination measure by 0.007 and yielded an NRI of 0.048, whereas the addition to prognostic models for cardiovascular disease and total mortality led to lesser C-index discrimination and NRI increment. In individuals above 6 ng/L of troponin I, a concentration near the upper quintile in BiomarCaRE (5.9 ng/L) and JUPITER (5.8 ng/L), rosuvastatin therapy resulted in higher absolute risk reduction compared with individuals <6 ng/L of troponin I, whereas the relative risk reduction was similar.",

By fitting to clinical data, parameters that described absorption, hepatic elimination, and EHC processes were optimized, and the extent of these DDIs was explained satisfactorily. Similar in vivo inhibition constant (Ki ) values of each inhibitor against OATPs were obtained, regardless of the substrates. Estimated Ki values of CsA were comparable to reported in vitro values with the preincubation of CsA, while those of RIF were smaller than reported in vitro values (coincubation).
