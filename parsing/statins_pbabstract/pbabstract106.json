    "4": "In total, 132 patients (66 for each group) were enrolled and randomized. After 12 weeks of treatment, the ApoB/ApoA1 ratio was significantly reduced in both groups; however, the difference of changes between the two groups was not statistically significant (ezetimibe/simvastatin -38.6 \u00b1 18.0 % vs. atorvastatin -34.4 \u00b1 15.5 %; p = 0.059). There were no significant differences in changes to total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, ApoB, and ApoB48 between the two groups. However, the increments of ApoA1 were significantly greater in the ezetimibe/simvastatin group than in the atorvastatin group (2.8 \u00b1 10.0 vs. -1.8 \u00b1 9.8 %; p = 0.002). In the per-protocol analysis, improvement in ApoB/ApoA1 was significantly greater in the ezetimibe/simvastatin group (-42.8 \u00b1 11.8 vs. -36.7 \u00b1 13.2 %; p = 0.019).

    "6": "Monascus species have been used to produce fermented rice called Monascus-fermented rice (MFR). To improve a Monascus strain via activation of secondary metabolite (SM) gene clusters for use in the production of MFR, we overexpressed an ortholog of the laeA gene, which encodes a global positive regulator of secondary metabolism under the control of the strong heterologous Aspergillus nidulans alcA promoter in Monascus pilosus. The OE::laeA transformant produced more SMs, including those not detected under uninduced conditions. MFR produced using the M. pilosus OE::laeA strain contained 4 times more monacolin K, a cholesterol-lowering agent, than MFR produced using the wild-type strain. In addition, pigment production was remarkably increased, and the antioxidant activity was increased as well. The results from this study suggest that Monascus species, which are important industrial fermentative fungi in Asia, can be improved for the production of functional foods by overexpressing the laeA gene.", 
    "7": "Vitamin E is the generic name for tocopherol (Toc) and tocotrienol (T3), which have saturated and unsaturated side chains, respectively. Such differences allow T3 to be different from Toc in terms of their functions. T3 has been known to attenuate cholesterol (Cho) level by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoAR). Recent reports also showed the efficacy of T3 in improving triglyceride (TG) profiles in both in vivo and in vitro studies. However the mechanism involved in this biological activity is still unclear and needs to be further investigated. In the present study, we elucidated the effect of \u03b3-T3 on lipid levels and lipogenic gene expressions in mouse hepatocellular carcinoma Hepa 1-6. \u03b3-T3 showed attenuation of TG through effect on fatty acid synthase, sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1, stearoyl CoA desaturase 1, and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A gene expression in Hepa 1-6. In contrast, the Cho level remained unchanged. These results expanded our previous finding of lipid-lowering effects of T3, especially for TG. Therefore, T3 is a potential lipid-lowering compound candidate with realistic prospects for its use as a therapy for lipid-related diseases in humans.", 
    "8": "Simvastatin is a cholesterol-lowering drug which exhibits numerous pleiotropic effects including anti-cancer activity. Yet, the anti-cancer effects in choroidal melanoma remain poorly characterized. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects of simvastatin on OCM-1 cells growth, apoptosis and cycle. Simvastatin showed an inhibitory effects on OCM-1 cells viability in dose-dependent (2-10 \u03bcM) and time-dependent (24-72 h) manner. Further study suggested that simvastatin-induced inhibition OCM-1 cells proliferation was associated with G1 phase arrest, decreased protein and mRNA expression of proliferation marker cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyclin dependent kinase (CDK)2 and increased expression of CDK inhibitory protein P21. In addition, simvastatin resulted in an increase in levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in OCM-1 cells and simvastatin significantly triggered apoptosis in OCM-1 cells, which was characterized by increased chromatin condensation, activation of caspase-9 and cleaved-caspase-3, increased expression mitochondrion-related apoptosis protein of P53, Bax and decreased expression of Bcl2 and iASPP. Collectively, our study demonstrated that simvastatin can efficiently inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in OCM-1 cells.", 
    "9": "The role of inflammation in the propagation of atherosclerosis and susceptibility to cardiovascular (CV) events is well established. Of the wide array of inflammatory biomarkers that have been studied, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) has received the most attention for its use in screening and risk reclassification and as a predictor of clinical response to statin therapy. Although CRP is involved in the immunologic process that triggers vascular remodeling and plaque deposition and is associated with increased CV disease (CVD) risk, definitive randomized evidence for its role as a causative factor in atherothrombosis is lacking. Whether measurement of hsCRP levels provides consistent, clinically meaningful incremental predictive value in risk prediction and reclassification beyond conventional factors remains debated. Despite publication of guidelines on the use of hsCRP in CVD risk prediction by several leading professional organizations, there is a lack of clear consensus regarding the optimal clinical use of hsCRP. This article reviews 4 distinct points from the literature to better understand the current state and application of hsCRP in clinical practice: 1) the biology of hsCRP and its role in atherosclerosis; 2) the epidemiological association of hsCRP with CVD; 3) the quality of hsCRP as a biomarker of risk; and 4) the use of hsCRP as a tool to initiate or tailor statin therapy. Furthermore, we highlight recommendations from societies and important considerations when using hsCRP to guide treatment decisions in the primary prevention setting.",

Atorvastatin 80 mg resulted in significant additional relative reductions in TBR versus atorvastatin 10 mg (10.6% [2.2% to 18.3%]; p = 0.01) at week 12. Reductions from baseline in TBR were seen as early as 4 weeks after randomization with atorvastatin 10 mg (6.4% reduction, p < 0.05) and 80 mg (12.5% reduction, p < 0.001).

    "15": "Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is an independent risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. Vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) motility and plasticity, functions that are influenced by environmental cues, are vital to adaptation and remodelling in vascular physiology and pathophysiology. Lp(a) is reportedly damaging to SMC function via unknown molecular mechanisms. Apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)), a unique glycoprotein moiety of Lp(a), has been demonstrated as its active component. The aims of this study were to determine functional effects of recombinant apo(a) on human vascular SMC motility and explore the underlying mechanism(s). Exposure of SMC to apo(a) in migration assays induced a potent, concentration-dependent chemorepulsion that was RhoA and integrin \u03b1V\u03b23-dependent, but transforming growth factor \u03b2-independent. SMC manipulation through RhoA gene silencing, Rho kinase inhibition, statin pre-treatment, \u03b1V\u03b23 neutralising antibody and tyrosine kinase inhibition all markedly inhibited apo(a)-mediated SMC migration. Our data reveal unique and potent activities of apo(a) that may negatively influence SMC remodelling in cardiovascular disease. Circulating levels of Lp(a) are resistant to lipid-lowering strategies and hence a greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying its functional effects on SMC may provide alternative therapeutic targets.",

    "36": "Surgical and intensive care patients are at a heightened risk for arterial embolization due to pre-existing conditions such as age, hypercoagulability, cardiac abnormalities and atherosclerotic disease. Most arterial emboli are clots that originate in the heart and travel to distant vascular beds where they cause arterial occlusion, ischemia, and potentially infarction. Other emboli form on the surface of eroded arterial plaque or within its lipid core. Thromboemboli are large clots that dislodge from the surface of athesclerotic lesions and occlude distal arteries causing immediate ischemia. Atheroemboli, which originate from fracturing the lipid core tend to cause a process of organ dysfunction and systemic inflammation, termed cholesterol embolization syndrome. The presentation of arterial emboli depends on the arterial bed that is affected. The most common manifestations are strokes and acute lower limb ischemia. Less frequently, emboli target the upper extremities, mesenteric or renal arteries. Treatment involves rapid diagnosis, which may be aided by precise imaging studies and restoration of blood flow. The type of emboli, duration of presentation, and organ system affected determines the treatment course. Long-term therapy includes supportive medical care, identification of the source of embolism and prevention of additional emboli. Patients who experienced arterial embolism as a result of clots formed in the heart should be anticoagulated. Arterial emboli from atherosclerotic disease of the aorta or other large arteries should prompt treatment to reduce the risk for atherosclerotic progression, such as anti-platelet therapy and the use of statin drugs. The use of anticoagulation and surgical intervention to reduce the risk of arterial embolization from atherosclerotic lesions is still being studied.",

    "44": "We used mouse cortical collecting duct principal cells (mpkCCDc14 cell line) as a model to determine whether statins reduce the harmful effects of cyclosporine A (CsA) on the distal nephron. The data showed that treatment of cells with CsA increased transepithelial resistance and that the effect of CsA was abolished by lovastatin. Scanning ion conductance microscopy showed that CsA significantly increased the height of cellular protrusions near tight junctions. In contrast, lovastatin eliminated the protrusions and even caused a modest depression between cells. Western blot analysis and confocal microscopy showed that lovastatin also abolished CsA-induced elevation of both zonula occludens-1 and cholesterol in tight junctions. In contrast, a high concentration of CsA induced apoptosis, which was also attenuated by lovastatin, elevated intracellular ROS via activation of NADPH oxidase, and increased the expression of p47phox. Sustained treatment of cells with lovastatin also induced significant apoptosis, which was attenuated by CsA, but did not elevate intracellular ROS. These results indicate that both CsA and lovastatin are harmful to principal cells of the distal tubule, but via ROS-dependent and ROS-independent apoptotic pathways, respectively, and that they counteract probably via mobilization of cellular cholesterol levels.", 
    "45": "We compared plasma apolipoprotein profiles in subjects with peripheral artery disease (PAD) treated with statin medications (n = 21), subjects with PAD who are untreated with statins (n = 18), and control subjects (n = 70). Subjects were assessed on plasma apolipoproteins, medical history, physical examination, ankle-brachial index, and exercise performance using a treadmill test. The percentage of subjects with an abnormal value of apolipoprotein B (ApoB) (\u2265 95 mg/dL) was 53% in the PAD group untreated with statins, 29% in the treated PAD group, and 13% in the controls (p < 0.001). The PAD group untreated with statins had higher values for ApoB (p < 0.001), triglycerides (p < 0.01), low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol / high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol ratio (p < 0.05), and glucose (p < 0.01) than the control group. In contrast, when the statin-treated PAD group was compared with controls, none of the variables were different except that the treated PAD group had lower LDL-cholesterol (p < 0.01) and higher glucose (p < 0.01). Furthermore, the PAD group treated with statins had lower ApoB (p < 0.01), triglycerides (p < 0.001), LDL-cholesterol (p < 0.05), LDL-cholesterol / HDL-cholesterol ratio (p < 0.05), and non-HDL-cholesterol (p < 0.05) than the untreated PAD group. In conclusion, subjects with PAD who are untreated with statin medications have higher levels of ApoB than controls, whereas subjects treated with statins have a more favorable risk profile, characterized by lower ApoB, LDL-C, LDL-C / HDL-C ratio, and non-HDL-C concentrations. Statin therapy may be efficacious for improving apolipoprotein profiles in subjects with PAD and intermittent claudication.",

Although much is known about the deleterious effects caused by reactive oxygen species generated during the reduction of Cr(VI) after its absorption by biological systems, the precise mechanisms underlying Cr(VI) cytotoxicity remain poorly defined. Here, we analyzed, at the global proteome scale, the perturbation of protein expression in GM00637 human skin fibroblast cells upon exposure to potassium dichromate (K\u2082Cr\u2082O\u2087). We were able to quantify \u223c4600 unique proteins, among which \u223c400 exhibited significant alterations in expression levels upon a 24-h treatment with 0.5 \u03bcM K\u2082Cr\u2082O\u2087. Pathway analysis revealed the Cr(VI)-induced perturbation of cholesterol biosynthesis, G-protein signaling, inflammatory response, and selenoprotein pathways. In particular, we discovered that the K\u2082Cr\u2082O\u2087 treatment led to pronouncedly elevated expression of a large number of enzymes involved in de novo cholesterol biosynthesis. Real-time PCR analysis revealed the increased mRNA expression of selected genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. Consistently, K\u2082Cr\u2082O\u2087 treatment resulted in marked increases in cellular cholesterol level in multiple cell lines. Moreover, the Cr(VI)-induced growth inhibition of cultured human cells could be rescued by a cholesterol-lowering drug, lovastatin. Together, we demonstrated, for the first time, that Cr(VI) may exert its cytotoxic effect, at least partly, through the up-regulation of enzymes involved in de novo cholesterol biosynthesis and the resultant increase of cholesterol level in cells.",

The role of endogenous nitric oxide and the type of transcription factors involved were explored. Simvastatin and fluvastatin induced HO-1. Pretreatment of cells with l-NMMA or 1400 W, two different nitric oxide synthase inhibitors, partially blocked statin-dependent induction of HO-1 in RAW 264.7 and J774A.1 but not in primary peritoneal macrophages. Induction of HO-1 by statins was dependent on p-38 MAP kinase activation in all types of macrophages. In RAW 264.7 cells, both statins increased the activity of reporter genes linked to the proximal 1.3 kbp promoter of HO-1 (EC50 of 1.4\u00b10.3 \u00b5M for simvastatin and 0.6\u00b10.03 \u00b5M for fluvastatin). This effect was significantly blocked by 1400 W (80\u00b15.2% inhibition, p<0.02) and mevalonate, the direct metabolite of HMGCoA reductase. Gel retardation experiments implicated C/EBP\u03b2, AP-1 but not USF, for both RAW 264.7 and primary peritoneal macrophages of C57BL/6 mice. Collectively we showed a differential role of endogenous nitric oxide between macrophage cell lines and primary macrophages and an effect of statins in the protection against inflammation by increasing HO-1 expression.", 
    "56": "Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is a molecule with strong proliferative effects, and statins have been reported to exhibit antitumor effects based on clinical and experimental studies. However, their effects on cardiac myxoma (CM) cells and the underlying signaling mechanism(s) are largely unknown. Therefore, we investigated whether the protein/lipid phosphatases and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) and pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat phosphatase 1 and 2 (PHLPP1 and 2) are involved in the proliferative effect of IGF-1 on CM cells and the pharmacological impact of atorvastatin. The activity of PTEN and PHLPPs was determined using specific substrate diC16PIP3 and pNPP. We found that IGF-1 enhanced CM cell proliferation and inhibited both PTEN and PHLPP2 activity in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Atorvastatin acted counter to IGF-1 and reversed the above effects mediated by IGF-1. Both IGF-1 and atorvastatin did not affect the activity of PHLPP1 and the protein expression of the three phosphatases. The results suggest that IGF-1 may exert its proliferative effects by negatively regulating the PTEN/PHLPP2 signaling pathway in CM cells, and atorvastatin may be a potential drug for the treatment of CM by enhancing the activity of PTEN and PHLPP2.",

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 63 men (35-60 years of age) after a myocardial infarction were randomized to either niacin/laropiprant (1000/20 mg daily for 4 weeks and 2000/40 mg daily thereafter) or placebo. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and nitroglycerin-induced (GTN) dilation of the brachial artery, total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides (TG), lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], and apolipoprotein (Apo) A1/B were measured at baseline and after 12 weeks of intervention.

This is a key enzyme involved in isoprenoid synthesis and essential for cell membrane formation in methanogenic Archaea. In this paper, experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that lovastatin secreted by Aspergillus terreus in fermented rice straw extracts (FRSE) can inhibit growth and CH4 production in Methanobrevibacter smithii (a test methanogen). By HPLC analysis, 75% of the total lovastatin in FRSE was in the active hydroxyacid form, and in vitro studies confirmed that this had a stronger effect in reducing both growth and CH4 production in M. smithii compared to commercial lovastatin. Transmission electron micrographs revealed distorted morphological divisions of lovastatin- and FRSE-treated M. smithii cells, supporting its role in blocking normal cell membrane synthesis. Real-time PCR confirmed that both commercial lovastatin and FRSE increased (P < 0.01) the expression of HMG-CoA reductase gene (hmg). In addition, expressions of other gene transcripts in M. smithii. with a key involvement in methanogenesis were also affected. Experimental confirmation that CH4 production is inhibited by lovastatin in A. terreus-fermented rice straw paves the way for its evaluation as a feed additive for mitigating CH4 production in ruminants.", 
    "81": "Objective. To determine if non-HDL cholesterol (N-HDL) and directly measured LDL cholesterol (D-LDL) are clinically equivalent measurements. Patients and Methods. Eighty-one subjects recruited for 2 cholesterol treatment studies had at least 1 complete fasting lipid panel and D-LDL performed simultaneously; 64 had a second assessment after 4 to 6 weeks, resulting in 145 triads of C-LDL, D-LDL, and N-HDL. To directly compare N-HDL to D-LDL and C-LDL, we normalized the N-HDL by subtracting 30 from the N-HDL (N-HDLA). Results. There was significant correlation between N-HDLA, D-LDL, and C-LDL. Correlation was significantly greater between N-HDLA and C-LDL than between N-HDLA and D-LDL. A greater than 20\u2009mg/dL difference between measures was observed more commonly between N-HDLA and D-LDL, 29%, than between C-LDL and N-HDLA, 11% (P < 0.001), and C-LDL and D-LDL, 17% (P = 0.028). Clinical discordance was most common, and concordance was least common between N-HDL and D-LDL. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that N-HDL cholesterol and D-LDL cholesterol are not clinically equivalent and frequently discordant. As N-HDL may be superior to even C-LDL for predicting events in statin-treated patients, utilizing N-HDL to guide therapy would appear to be preferable to D-LDL when C-LDL is inaccurate.",

Although its main effect has long been known, much is yet to be understood about the wide and varied pleiotropic properties of statins. Some studies have demonstrated that statins contain antiplatelet, antithrombotic, antiinflammatory, cardioprotective, and neuroprotective properties independent of their ability to lower plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. More recently, statins have been used in novel ways in the treatment of Alzheimer disease, sepsis, pneumonia, and bacteremia. In 2000, it was first suggested that statins could decrease the incidence of venous thromboembolisms (VTEs). A recent publication showed that not only do statins lower the incidence of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, but they do so in a dose-dependent manner. Although there is certainly strong evidence demonstrating that statins do indeed lower VTEs, the mechanism is not understood. Possible hypotheses include their antiinflammatory and antithrombotic properties. With only one randomized clinical trial available, further studies must be conducted before routinely recommending statins for prophylaxis of VTEs.",

The chemistry of the polymer and the drug, and their interactions influence the release kinetics to a great extent. Here, we examine lovastatin release behaviour from polycaprolactone (PCL) coating on \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate (\u03b2-TCP). Lovastatin was incorporated into biodegradable water insoluble PCL coating. A burst and uncontrolled lovastatin release was observed from bare \u03b2-TCP, whereas controlled and sustained release was observed from PCL coating. A higher lovastatin release was observed pH7.4 as compared to pH5.0. Effect of PCL concentration on lovastatin release was opposite at pH7.4 and 5.0. At pH5.0 lovastatin release was decreased with increasing PCL concentration, whereas release was increased with increasing PCL concentration at pH7.4. High Ca(2+) ion concentration due to high solubility of \u03b2-TCP and degradation of PCL coating were observed at pH5.0 compared to no detectable Ca(2+) ion release and visible degradation of PCL coating at pH7.4. The hydrophilic-hydrophobic and hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions between lovastatin and PCL were found to be the key factors controlling the diffusion dominated release kinetics of lovastatin from PCL coating over dissolution and degradation processes. Understanding the lovastatin release chemistry from PCL will be beneficial for designing drug delivery devices from polymeric coating or scaffolds.",

An evaluation of potentially modifiable risk factors such as hypertension and medication usage has not been undertaken to our knowledge. The authors thus reviewed a cohort of 45 consecutive patients with cerebral dAVF with leptomeningeal venous drainage and compared the rate of hemorrhagic presentation for patients with and without a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia or the usage of certain medications. Logistic regression was performed to determine the statistical significance of associations of each factor with hemorrhagic presentation. On univariate analysis, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors (odds ratio [OR] 0.100, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0-0.764, p=0.024) and statins (OR 0.142, 95% CI 0.025-0.825, p=0.030) were associated with a statistically significant lower rate of hemorrhagic presentation.

These trends continued on multivariate analysis; however they did not meet statistical significance (p>0.05). Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, warfarin and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors did not have a statistically significant association with the rate of hemorrhagic presentation (p>0.05). Although limited by small sample size, these results may suggest a beneficial effect of statins and ACE-inhibitors on the rate of dAVF hemorrhagic presentation, potentially as a result of anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic or even venous antithrombotic mechanisms.

Under the influence of lisinopril and lovastatin there were observed lowering in the stellate pancreatic cells activity and in expression of SMA, desmin, GFAP, vimentin and TIMP-2, the MMP-1 and TIMP-2 ratio have had increased significantly and severity of fibrotic pancreatic affection had reduced trustworthy in comparison w such, occurring in a control group.", 
    "101": "Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (circEPCs) of bone marrow (BM) origin contribute to postnatal neovascularization and represent a potential therapeutic target for ischemic disease. Statins are beneficial for ischemia disease and have been implicated to increase neovascularization via mechanisms independent of lipid lowering. However, the effect of Statins on EPC function is not completely understood. Here we sought to investigate the effects of Rosuvastatin (Ros) on EPC mobilization and EPC-mediated neovascularization during ischemic injury. In a mouse model of surgically-induced hindlimb ischemia (HLI), treatment of mice with low dose (0.1 mg/kg) but not high dose (5 mg/kg) significantly increased capillary density and accelerated blood flow recovery, as compared to saline-treated group. When HLI was induced in mice that had received Tie2/LacZ BM transplantation, Ros treatment led a significantly larger amount of endothelial cells (ECs) of BM origin incorporated at ischemic sites than saline. After treatment of mice with a single low dose of Ros, circEPCs significantly increased from 2 h, peaked at 4 h, declined until 8 h. In a growth-factor reduced Matrigel plug-in assay, Ros treatment for 5 d induced endothelial lineage differentiation in vivo. Interestingly, the enhanced circEPCs and post-HLI neovascularization stimulated by Ros were blunted in mice deficient in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and Ros increased p-Akt/p-eNOS levels in EPCs in vitro, indicating these effects of Ros are dependent on eNOS activity. We conclude that Ros increases circEPCs and promotes their de novo differentiation through eNOS pathway.",

    "114": "The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are a class of drugs also known as statins. These drugs are effective and widely prescribed for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Seven statins are currently available: atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin and simvastatin. Although these drugs are generally well tolerated, skeletal muscle abnormalities from myalgia to severe lethal rhabdomyolysis can occur. Factors that increase statin concentrations such as drug-drug interactions can increase the risk of these adverse events. Drug-drug interactions are dependent on statins' pharmacokinetic profile: simvastatin, lovastatin and atorvastatin are metabolized through cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A, while the metabolism of the other statins is independent of this CYP. All statins are substrate of organic anion transporter polypeptide 1B1, an uptake transporter expressed in hepatocyte membrane that may also explain some drug-drug interactions. Many HIV-infected patients have dyslipidemia and comorbidities that may require statin treatment. HIV-protease inhibitors (HIV PIs) are part of recommended antiretroviral treatment in combination with two reverse transcriptase inhibitors. All HIV PIs except nelfinavir are coadministered with a low dose of ritonavir, a potent CYP3A inhibitor to improve their pharmacokinetic properties. Cobicistat is a new potent CYP3A inhibitor that is combined with elvitegravir and will be combined with HIV-PIs in the future. The HCV-PIs boceprevir and telaprevir are both, to different extents, inhibitors of CYP3A. This review summarizes the pharmacokinetic properties of statins and PIs with emphasis on their metabolic pathways explaining clinically important drug-drug interactions. Simvastatin and lovastatin metabolized through CYP3A have the highest potency for drug-drug interaction with potent CYP3A inhibitors such as ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted HIV-PI or the hepatitis C virus (HCV) PI, telaprevir or boceprevir, and therefore their coadministration is contraindicated. Atorvastatin is also a CYP3A substrate, but less potent drug-drug interactions have been reported with CYP3A inhibitors. Non-CYP3A-dependent statin concentrations are also affected although to a lesser extent when coadministered with HIV or HCV PIs, mainly through interaction with OATP1B1, and treatment should start with the lowest available statin dose. Effectiveness and occurrence of adverse effects should be monitored at regular time intervals.",

We highlight the results of key trials in several areas: interventional cardiology, acute coronary syndromes (ACS), and pharmacologic therapy. The FREEDOM trial, which demonstrated a significant benefit on hard outcomes of coronary artery bypass grafting vs multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with diabetes, answered a long-debated question. The MADIT-RIT trial demonstrated an impressive reduction in inappropriate shocks and mortality in stable implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) patients by altering ICD programming variables. In ACS, prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and prasugrel in medically managed patients was not superior to ASA plus clopidogrel, and ongoing trials will assess if there are benefits to use of DAPT beyond 1 year. The WOEST trial compared warfarin plus DAPT vs warfarin plus ASA alone in PCI patients who had an indication for ongoing anticoagulation. Not surprisingly, the major bleeding rate was lower with double compared with triple therapy. However, major CV events were unexpectedly lower with double therapy as well, a finding that warrants confirmation in larger studies. One of the most exciting developments in 2012 was with PCSK9 inhibitors, injectable monoclonal antibodies, that were shown to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 40%-70% above the effects of maximal dose statin therapy.

    "121": "There is now substantial data in the literature showing that statins can protect against cerebral ischemia. This neuroprotective potency is related to their pleiotropic effects that modulate various pathways implicated in the pathophysiology of stroke. It has been demonstrated that statins exert anti-inflammatory and vasculoprotective effects, thus contributing to a reduction in infarct size. The underlying mechanisms are still incompletely known. As a cross-talk between statins and the nuclear receptor PPAR\u03b1 has been described, we hypothesized that this cross-talk is necessary to neuroprotection in stroke. We studied the effects of a 14-day preventive atorvastatin treatment (10 mg/kg/day) on C57Bl6 wild-type and PPAR\u03b1-KO mice submitted to experimental stroke. PPAR\u03b1 was involved in the atorvastatin-induced neuroprotective effect, as confirmed by the measurement of infarct volumes. We also evidenced that the anti-inflammatory action of atorvastatin is mediated, at least partly, by PPAR\u03b1. The decrease in IL-6 plasmatic levels was PPAR\u03b1 dependent. The cerebral expression of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule was reduced by the atorvastatin treatment, and this effect was PPAR\u03b1 dependent in the cortex but not in the striatum of treated animals. Atorvastatin also diminished the cerebral expression of iNOS in the cortex, but had no effect in the striatum of treated mice, whatever the PPAR\u03b1 status. At the vascular level, we found that the atorvastatin-related endothelial nitric oxide synthase upregulation was regulated by PPAR\u03b1 in the aorta, while there was no effect in the brain. We demonstrate here that PPAR\u03b1 is a key mediator of the multitargeted neuroprotective effects of statins in stroke.",

Elevated TG levels are associated with increased risk for coronary heart disease. Currently available TG-lowering agents (fibrates, niacins, omega-3 fatty acid products containing both EPA and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) may be associated with adverse effects such as flushing, hepatotoxicity, myopathy, elevated glucose levels, and/or increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).",

The Noxes of their catalytic isoforms include multiple homologues in cardiovascular cells with wide range tissue distribution. It is still unclear which Noxes represent the major enzymatic source of ROS in the heart and play a predominant role in cardiac hypertrophy. In this study we investigated the differential expression changes of NAD(P)H oxidase P47phox isoform and Nox homologues in left ventricle and the effects of atorvastatin on cardiac remodeling in two-kidney two-clip(2K2C) hypertensive rats. The mRNA and protein expression of Nox2, Nox4 and P47phox showed a sustained increase at 4, 8, 12 weeks after surgery in 2K2C rats. Administration of atorvastatin attenuated cardiac dysfunction, hypertrophy and fibrosis of 2K2C rats. However, atorvastatin treatment had no effects on BP regulation. Further studies revealed that atorvastatin inhibited the increased expression of Nox2, Nox4, P47phox as well as 02\"- production in 2K2C hypertensive rats. These findings indicate that Nox2, Nox4 and P47phox play a crucial role in the development of cardiac remodeling in the 2K2C hypertensive rats. Atorvastatin, independent of BP control, exerts anti-remodeling effects partially by inhibition of NAD(P)H oxidase-mediated cardiac oxidative stress.",

In this work the widely prescribed cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin was investigated by combining experimental (combustion calorimetry and differential scanning calorimetry, DSC) and computational chemistry (quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics calculations) results. The studies addressed the crystalline form stable at ambient temperature (form I) and the liquid and gaseous phases. Heat capacity determinations by DSC showed no evidence of polymorphism between 293 K and the fusion temperature. It was also found that the most stable molecular conformation in the gas phase given by the quantum chemistry calculations (B3LYP-D3/cc-pVTZ) is analogous to that observed in the crystal phase. The molecular dynamics simulations correctly captured the main structural properties of the crystalline phase known from published single crystal X-ray diffraction results (unit cell dimensions and volume). They also suggested that, while preferential conformations are exhibited by the molecule in the solid at 298.15 K, these preferences are essentially blurred upon melting.

The individual risk/benefit ratio of prostate cancer screening is the focus of controversy and currently not in favor of a systematic screening program. Therefore, only prevention could reduce incidence, side effects of treatment and related mortality. Interestingly, prostate cancer prevention is also a field of controversy mainly about 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors. However, it could be expected that pharmaco- or diet-based prevention will be a huge tool for cancer control, even more for prostate cancer burden. This review comprehensively analyses which molecules or compounds could be used in preventive trials. With regard to pharmaco-prevention, three different kinds of drugs could be identified. First drugs, which aim at mainly or even solely reduce prostate cancer risk such as 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors and selective estrogen receptor modulators. Drugs, which aim at wider preventive impact such as: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or difluoromethylornithine. Lastly, drugs for which reducing prostate cancer incidence is merely a side effect such as statins, metformin or histones desacetylase inhibitors. With regard to diet-based prevention, two main approaches could be identified: aliments and nutriments, on one hand, and vitamin and minerals, on the other. Interestingly if compounds reach experimental plausibility, natural foods or even global diet seem to have a higher impact.

    "145": "Statins are associated with skeletal muscle adverse effects. These are generally considered mild and reversible, with more severe toxicity occurring rarely. There is little known regarding statin myotoxicity in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians who are at high cardiovascular risk and likely to receive statins.", 
    "146": "To describe features of serious statin-associated myotoxicity (SSAM) occurring in Indigenous Australians and increase awareness of this condition.", 
    "147": "Observational case series of SSAM in Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders. Cases were identified from personal clinical experience, referrals, reports to the Therapeutic Goods Administration, medical literature, an Internet search and reports from a histopathology laboratory. Information was collected onto a standardised data collection form.", 
    "148": "Fifteen cases of serious myotoxicity in Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders exposed to statins were identified from 2006 to 2012. The mean age was 55 (range 35-69). Painless weakness was the most common presentation. Interacting drugs were involved in seven cases. Biopsies were done in eight cases, three showed inflammatory polymyositis and five necrotising myositis. Three patients died and two had permanent severe disability. Resolution of symptoms after statin cessation was variable.", 
    "149": "SSAM has occurred in the Indigenous Australian population with some fatalities. Awareness of the potential for SSAM is essential for early recognition and effective management to reduce probability of avoidable catastrophic harm. Safe, as well as effective use of medication, is essential for optimum health outcomes. Effective pharmacovigilance and therapeutic risk management are important for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians.", 
    "150": "The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the in vivo potential of poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (PAMAM) based simvastatin (SMV) formulations as nanoscale drug delivery units for controlled release action of simvastatin. Drug-dendrimer complexes were prepared and characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. In a pharmacodynamic study, the percent increase in cholesterol was less with PAMAM dendrimer formulations as compared to pure drug. The cholesterol level was increased to 20.92% with pure SMV, whereas it was 11.66% with amine dendrimer, 11.49% with PEGylated dendrimer, and 10.86% with hydroxyl dendrimer formulations. Reduction in the increase in triglyceride and low density lipoprotein level was also more prominent with the drug-dendrimer formulations. The order of increase in high density lipoprotein level was PEGylated PAMAM-SMV (4.04%) > PAMAM-amine-SMV (2.57%) > PAMAM-hydroxyl-SMV (1.48%) > pure SMV (1.09%). Dendrimer-SMV formulations showed better pharmacokinetic performances than pure SMV suspension. The peak plasma SMV concentration increased from 2.3 \u03bcg/mL with pure SMV to 3.8 \u03bcg/mL with dendrimer formulations. The dendrimer mediated formulation had 3-5 times more mean SMV residence time than pure SMV. Furthermore, SMV absorption and elimination rates were decreased significantly, showing controlled release of SMV from the dendrimer formulations.", 
    "151": "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most lethal type of genitourinary cancer due to its occult onset and resistance to chemotherapy and radiation. Recently, accumulating evidence has suggested stains, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, were associated with the risk reduction of cancer. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the potential effects of simvastatin on RCC cells and the underlying mechanisms by which simvastatin exerted its actions. With cell viability, colony formation, and flow cytometric apoptosis assays, we found that simvastatin potently suppressed cell growth of A498 and 786-O cells in a time- and dose- dependent manner. Consistently, the xenograft model performed in nude mice exhibited reduced tumor growth with simvastatin treatment. In addition, the inhibitory effects of simvastatin on migration and invasion were also observed in vitro. Mechanically, we presented that simvastatin could suppress the proliferation and motility of RCC cells via inhibiting the phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR, and ERK in a time- and dose- dependent manner. Further investigation of the underlying mechanism revealed simvastatin could exert the anti-tumor effects by suppressing IL-6-induced phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3. In conclusion, these findings suggested that simvastatin-induced apoptosis and its anti-metastasis activity in RCC cells were accompanied by inhibition of AKT/mTOR, ERK, and JAK2/STAT3 pathways, which imply that simvastatin may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of RCC patients.", 
    "152": "Current evidence supports a less interventional, less aggressive, and more patient-oriented approach to the care of patients with diabetes than is commonly followed. When treating an adult patient with type 2 diabetes, the physician must focus on the following (in order of importance): smoking cessation and other lifestyle interventions, blood pressure control, metformin use, lipid control, and glycemic control. Patients also should receive influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations. Management goals should be individualized, but general target values are blood pressure of 140/80 mm Hg, low-density lipoprotein less than 100 mg/dL (or 70 mg/dL in a patient with diabetes and coronary artery disease, according to consensus opinion), and A1c less than 8%. Hypertension control is important; a thiazide or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor might be the best first-line treatment. Metformin is the foundation of treatment for most patients with type 2 diabetes; in patients who are overweight, use of metformin delays premature mortality regardless of achieved glucose levels. Statin drugs are superior to other drugs for cholesterol reduction. The use of combination or high-intensity drugs does not appear to confer additional benefit.", 
    "153": "Busy primary care physicians who want their patients with type 2 diabetes to live longer and better should, as much as possible, base screening and management decisions on patient-oriented evidence that affects morbidity and mortality. Because patients with dual diagnoses of diabetes and hypertension have a high risk of cardiovascular mortality, asymptomatic patients with hypertension should be screened for type 2 diabetes. Screening is conducted using a fasting plasma glucose test, a random A1c test, or a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test. For obese patients, efforts to prevent diabetes focus on weight reduction and moderate physical activity. In high-risk patients, use of metformin could delay diabetes onset. Diabetes is diagnosed on the basis of an abnormal A1c level, fasting plasma glucose level, or 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test or a symptomatic random plasma glucose level. After diabetes is diagnosed, the physician should obtain blood pressure, body mass index, a lipid panel (fasting not required), kidney function tests, and A1c test, and review vaccination and smoking status. Increased exercise and dietary modification should be recommended. For most patients with newly diagnosed diabetes, metformin should be initiated. Risk factors for cardiovascular disease should be evaluated; use of daily low-dose aspirin may be considered. Patients who meet treatment criteria for high cholesterol levels should take a statin, and patients with unacceptably elevated blood pressure should take an antihypertensive drug.", 
    "154": "Variability in drug responsiveness is a sine qua non of modern therapeutics, and the contribution of genomic variation is increasingly recognized. Investigating the genomic basis for variable responses to cardiovascular therapies has been a model for pharmacogenomics in general and has established critical pathways and specific loci modulating therapeutic responses to commonly used drugs such as clopidogrel, warfarin, and statins. In addition, genomic approaches have defined mechanisms and genetic variants underlying important toxicities with these and other drugs. These findings have not only resulted in changes to the product labels but also have led to development of initial clinical guidelines that consider how to facilitate incorporating genetic information to the bedside. This review summarizes the state of knowledge in cardiovascular pharmacogenomics and considers how variants described to date might be deployed in clinical decision making.", 
    "155": "Secondary interventions for renal artery restenosis (RAS) after renal artery stenting are common, despite limited data about their effectiveness. This study was designed to evaluate the outcomes of endovascular treatment of recurrent RAS.", 
    "156": "We conducted a retrospective review of patients who underwent renal artery stenting between 2001 and 2011 at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. Patients who required secondary interventions were compared with control patients who underwent only primary interventions for RAS. Multivariate regression models were used to identify factors associated with successful outcomes, as measured by changes in blood pressure, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and number of antihypertensive medications required.", 
    "157": "Sixty-five secondary (57 patients) renal interventions were undertaken for recurrent RAS associated with progressive hypertension or renal dysfunction and compared with outcomes after 216 primary (180 patients) renal artery stenting procedures. Patients undergoing primary vs secondary interventions did not differ significantly in the number of preoperative antihypertensive medications used, comorbid conditions, or blood pressure. All primary and secondary interventions were performed with stents and showed no difference in procedural complications. At a mean follow-up of 23 months (range, 1-128 months), similar improvements in renal function and blood pressure were found between patients undergoing primary and secondary interventions, and there was no difference in rates of restenosis or survival between cohorts. Regression models showed that the use of embolic protection devices was associated with improved renal function after primary (odds ratio [OR], 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-3.8; P < .05) and secondary (OR, 4.7; 95% CI, 1.7-12.5; P < .05) interventions, whereas statin therapy was associated with improved renal (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3-3.2; P < .05) and blood pressure response (OR, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.1-14.9; P < .05) after secondary interventions.", 
    "158": "Patients undergoing secondary interventions for recurrent RAS have outcomes that are comparable with those for primary interventions. These data suggest that repeated endovascular procedures for RAS can be undertaken with similar expectations for clinical improvement and may be further improved by routine use of embolic protection devices and statin therapy.", 
    "159": "Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare and lethal myocardial ischemic event, which usually causes acute coronary syndrome and sudden death. Emergency management of SCAD includes medical treatment, percutaneous coronary interventions, and coronary artery bypass grafting. Here, we report 1 case of 37-year-old young woman who was found to have a mid-distal SCAD of the left anterior descending artery, taking conservative management decision. In another case of a 50-year-old woman who was found to have a proximal-middle spiral SCAD of the right coronary artery, she underwent coronary angioplasty. After 6 months later at follow-up, 2 patients remained stable without symptom and in recovery of the left ventricular function; angiogram showed the SCAD healed.", 
    "160": "A novel conjugate for rosuvastatin has been prepared by a coupling reaction between rosuvastatin and dextran. The dextran-rosuvastatin conjugates (DRC) were characterized by FT-IR, NMR, and XRD. And the resulting DRC self-assembled into microparticles by controlled slow exchange of solvents applying dialysis. The size and morphology of DRC microparticles could be controlled through the solvents and pH selection. Particles with different shape and size of microspheres, micro-blocks, micro-flakes or three-dimensional network structure were obtained by adjusting the pH from 9.0 to 13.0. Multiple morphologies of nano- or microparticles were collected in different organic solvents. In vitro release studies suggested that these DRC microparticles had a sustained release manner and the release behavior could be controlled by adjusting their morphology.", 
    "161": "There are a number of studies about the effects of statins and thiazolidinediones on lymphocytes. However, there is no study about possible effects of atorvastatin and rosiglitazone on lymphocytes in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We aimed to investigate the effects of atorvastatin and rosiglitazone on CD38, ZAP-70, Annexin V and bcl-2 in lymphocytes of CLL in vitro. Seven (4 males and 3 females) patients with CLL with average age of 56 \u00b1 8 years were enrolled to the study. The mean values of laboratory tests were as follows: hemoglobin: 12 \u00b1 1.8 g/dl; hematocrit: %35 \u00b1 6; platelet count: 156,000 \u00b1 68,000/mm(3); leukocyte count: 50,500 \u00b1 38,700/mm(3); and lymphocyte count: 45,700 \u00b1 38,100/mm(3). The study was performed in three cell cultures groups. Mononuclear cells of blood samples from peripheral veins were separated by Ficoll method. On culture plate with 24 wells, it was suspended with 2 ml RPMI 1640. Then, the plates were incubated in %5 CO2 at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h. 5 \u03bcM atorvastatin-calcium was given to first group, 2 \u03bcM rosiglitazone maleate was given to second group, and the third group was included in the study as control group. After 24 h, the expressions of CD5, CD38, ZAP-70 and Annexin V by using flow cytometry with EPICS XL-MCL and the levels of bcl-2 by using ELISA method were re-evaluated. Two-paired Student's t test was used for comparison of the results, and p < 0.05 was accepted as a significance level. While atorvastatin and rosiglitazone did not affect the expression of CD38 and the level of bcl-2, these drugs significantly increased the level of Annexin V when compared with control group (p < 0.001). Both drugs significantly decreased the expressions of CD5 (p = 0.03) and ZAP-70 (p < 0.05) compared with control group. Atorvastatin and rosiglitazone increased apoptosis in lymphocytes of CLL in vitro. Moreover, these drugs decreased the expressions of CD5 and ZAP-70. These drugs must be studied in more detail in the pathogenesis and treatment for CLL.", 
    "162": "The past decade has seen tremendous advances in our understanding of the genetic factors influencing response to a variety of drugs, including those targeted at treatment of cardiovascular diseases. In the case of clopidogrel, warfarin, and statins, the literature has become sufficiently strong that guidelines are now available describing the use of genetic information to guide treatment with these therapies, and some health centers are using this information in the care of their patients. There are many challenges in moving from research data to translation to practice; we discuss some of these barriers and the approaches some health systems are taking to overcome them. The body of literature that has led to the clinical implementation of CYP2C19 genotyping for clopidogrel, VKORC1, CYP2C9; and CYP4F2 for warfarin; and SLCO1B1 for statins is comprehensively described. We also provide clarity for other genes that have been extensively studied relative to these drugs, but for which the data are conflicting. Finally, we comment briefly on pharmacogenetics of other cardiovascular drugs and highlight \u03b2-blockers as the drug class with strong data that has not yet seen clinical implementation. It is anticipated that genetic information will increasingly be available on patients, and it is important to identify those examples where the evidence is sufficiently robust and predictive to use genetic information to guide clinical decisions. The review herein provides several examples of the accumulation of evidence and eventual clinical translation in cardiovascular pharmacogenetics.", 
    "163": "Classifying medication adherence is important for efficiently targeting adherence improvement interventions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of a novel method, group-based trajectory models, for classifying patients by their long-term adherence.", 
    "164": "We identified patients who initiated a statin between June 1, 2006 and May 30, 2007 in prescription claims from CVS Caremark and evaluated adherence over the subsequent 15 months. We compared several adherence summary measures, including proportion of days covered (PDC) and trajectory models with 2-6 groups, with the observed adherence pattern, defined by monthly indicators of full adherence (defined as having \u226524 d covered of 30). We also compared the accuracy of adherence prediction based on patient characteristics when adherence was defined by either a trajectory model or PDC.", 
    "165": "In 264,789 statin initiators, the 6-group trajectory model summarized long-term adherence best (C=0.938), whereas PDC summarized less well (C=0.881). The accuracy of adherence predictions was similar whether adherence was classified by PDC or by trajectory model.", 
    "166": "Trajectory models summarized adherence patterns better than traditional approaches and were similarly predicted by covariates. Group-based trajectory models may facilitate targeting of interventions and may be useful to adjust for confounding by health-seeking behavior.", 
    "167": "Patients with claudication secondary to peripheral artery disease have a substantial impairment in walking capacity. This study evaluated factors suspected to be correlated with treadmill walking performance in an effort to gain insights into the pathophysiology of the impairment.", 
    "168": "A multivariate model was developed to define the associations between clinical and laboratory biomarkers with treadmill peak walking time (PWT) in patients enrolled in three clinical trials. The model was initially developed in a cohort of 385 patients from one trial using 23 candidate-independent variables and then tested in the combined data from the other two trials (351 patients).", 
    "169": "The final model was built from 14 variables that met the predefined univariate criteria of P < .15. Main effects remaining in the model were age, resting ankle-brachial index, smoking status, hypertension, statin use, country (United States vs non-United States countries), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. The model was highly statistically significant (P < .0001) but explained only a limited portion of the population heterogeneity (r(2) = 0.173). The main effects plus interaction terms had an r(2) = 0.2178. The main effects model was tested in an independent cohort of 351 patients from two other clinical trials in peripheral arterial disease that did not include high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. The model successfully fit the data set, based on prospectively defined root mean squared error and was statistically significant (P = .0005) but had lower overall explanatory power than in the index cohort (r(2) = 0.0687).", 
    "170": "As expected, age and ankle-brachial index contributed to exercise limitation among patients with PAD. The association of C-reactive protein, hypertension, and smoking with PWT is consistent with a role for inflammation or oxidative stress in determining treadmill walking performance. In contrast to previous reports from smaller and more homogenous populations, clinical attributes and biomarkers explain only a small portion of PWT heterogeneity.", 
    "171": "Despite recent studies that suggested statins' beneficial effects on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) outcomes, the impact, if any, of statins on COPD exacerbations remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the association between statin use and risk of hospitalized COPD exacerbation, and to assess whether the association varied by statin initiation, dose, or duration of use.", 
    "172": "A retrospective nested case-control study among patients with COPD was conducted analyzing a nationwide health insurance claims database in Taiwan. Cases were subjects hospitalized for COPD exacerbations; each case was matched to 4 randomly selected controls on age, sex, cohort entry, and number of COPD-related outpatient visits by an incident-density sampling approach. Conditional logistic regressions were employed to quantify the COPD exacerbation risk associated with statin use.", 
    "173": "The study cohort comprised 14,316 COPD patients, from which 1584 cases with COPD exacerbations and 5950 matched controls were identified. Any use of statins was associated with a 30% decreased risk of COPD exacerbation (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56-0.88), and current use of statins was related to a greater reduced risk (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.60; 95% CI, 0.44-0.81). A dose-dependent reduced risk of COPD exacerbation by statins was observed (medium average daily dose: adjusted OR 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41-0.89; high daily dose: adjusted OR 0.33; 95% CI, 0.14-0.73). The reduced risk remained significant for either short or long duration of statin use.", 
    "174": "Statin use was associated with a reduced risk of COPD exacerbation, with a further risk reduction for statins prescribed more recently or at high doses.", 
    "175": "The aim of this study was to investigate the combined effect of statin and \u03b1-tricalcium phosphate (\u03b1-TCP) on odontoblastic differentiation of human dental pulp cells and to compare them with mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA).", 
    "176": "Experimental cements were prepared with TCP containing simvastatin and atorvastatin. Cell proliferation, cell adherence on a dentin disc, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, expression of osteogenic/odontoblastic markers, and mineralization of the human dental pulp cells on experimental cement and MTA were assessed.", 
    "177": "The cell growth and ALP activity of TCP containing simvastatin-treated cells was greater than MTA-treated cells. The mineralization and messenger RNA expression of markers (ie, dentin sialophosphoprotein, dentin matrix protein 1, bone morphogenetic protein 2, ALP, and osteonectin) of TCP containing simvastatin- and TCP containing atorvastatin-treated cells were comparable with MTA-treated cells. The enhanced cell proliferation and similar level of ALP of TCP-treated cells compared with the control indicate that \u03b1-TCP is an effective osteoconductive material. The differentiation effect observed in TCP containing simvastatin- and TCP containing atorvastatin-treated cells is attributed to the effect of statin.", 
    "178": "The results suggest that \u03b1-TCP can be used for local delivery of statin as a pulp capping material to accelerate reparative dentin formation.", 
    "179": "Existing data on the spatiotemporal expression patterns of a variety of galectins in murine atherosclerosis are limited. We investigated the expression levels of galectins, and their in vivo spatiotemporal expression patterns and statin responsiveness in the inflamed atherosclerotic plaques of apolipoprotein E (apoE)(-/-) mice.", 
    "180": "Galectins expression patterns in aortic atherosclerotic plaques and serum galectin-3 levels were investigated in 26-week-old apoE(-/-) (n=6) and C57BL/6 mice (n=9). To investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of galectin-1 and galectin-3 in plaques, high-cholesterol diet-fed 26-week-old (n=12) and 36-week-old apoE(-/-) mice (n=6) were sacrificed and their aortas were examined for galectins' expression using immunoblot analysis and immunohistochemical stain. 36-week-old apoE(-/-) mice were treated with atorvastatin (n=3, 0.57 mg/kg/day) for the evaluation of its effect on aortic galectins' expression.", 
    "181": "Immunoblot analyses showed that galectin-1 and galectin-3 were the predominant galectins expressed in murine atherosclerosis. The serum galectin-3 level was significantly higher in apoE(-/-) mice (p<0.001). While galectin-1 was weakly expressed in both intimal plaques and the media of atherosclerotic aortas, galectin-3 was heavily and exclusively accumulated in intimal plaques. Galectin-3 distribution was colocalized with plaque macrophages' distribution (r=0.66). As the degree of plaque extent and inflammation increased, the intraplaque galectin-3 expression levels proportionally elevated (p<0.01 vs. baseline), whereas galectin-1 expression had not elevated (p=0.14 vs. baseline). Atorvastatin treatment markedly reduced intraplaque galectin-3 and macrophage signals (p<0.001 vs. baseline), whereas it failed to reduce galectin-1 expression in the aortas.", 
    "182": "Galectin-3 is the predominant gal and is colocalized with macrophages within atherosclerotic plaques. Intraplaque galectin-3 expression reflects the degree of plaque inflammation.", 
    "183": "The objective of this study was to explore the association between statins use and risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We used the research database of the Taiwan National Health Insurance program to conduct a population-based case-control study. Cases were 3,480 patients with newly diagnosed HCC identified during 2000 and 2009. Controls were 13,920 subjects without HCC and frequency matched for age, sex and duration of observational period of cases (i.e., the duration between year of being enrolled in the insurance program and index year of cases). Six commercially available statins, including simvastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin, were analyzed. The adjusted odds ratio [OR] of HCC was 0.72 [95% (CI) 0.59-0.88] for the group with stains use, when compared to the group with non-use of statins. In sub-analysis, simvastatin (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50-0.94), lovastatin (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.36-0.76) and atorvastatin (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.53-0.93) were associated with significant reduction in odds of HCC. Statins use correlates with 28% decreased risk of HCC. Individual statins, including simvastatin, lovastatin and atorvastatin, are associated with reduced risk of HCC.",

The binary restenosis was significantly lower in GenousTM (13 vs. 26.6%, P=0.04). Risk of MACE after 6 and 12 months were comparable in both groups. There was no stent thrombosis. Numbers of circulating EPCs were significantly approximately 2-fold higher during the ACS than after 6 months. Mobilization of EPCs during acute ischemia was significantly lower in patients who developed restenosis after 6 months (3 vs. 4.5 cells/\u03bcL, P=0.002) and it was negatively correlated with late-loss after 6 months (R=-0.42; P<0.03).",

This was mainly due to reduced atrophy of lean mass, i.e. muscle mass. Cardiac function was significantly improved, e.g. cardiac output (untreated sham: 78.9 mL/min) was severely impaired in tumour-bearing rats (42.4 mL/min) and improved by 1, 10 or 20 mg/kg/d simvastatin (62.2, 59.0 and 57.0 mL/min, respectively, all p<0.05 vs. placebo).

We also recorded risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, total cholesterol, serum white blood cells, serum creatinine, body mass index, blood pressure, statin use, current smoking status, coronary artery disease, cerebral vascular accident, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.", 
    "197": "We enrolled 24 patients in this study (AAA, n\u00a0=\u00a012; PVD, n = 12). The AAA patients had a greater percentage of CD34+\u00a0cells compared with PVD patients. (r\u00a0=\u00a00.84; P = 0.016). There were no significant risk factors differences between AAA and PVD patients.", 
    "198": "Based on CD34+\u00a0cell counts, AAA is a less severe vascular disease than PVD. Whether CD34+\u00a0cells can serve as a biomarker for risk stratification or a potential therapy warrants further study.", 
    "199": "The effects of statins on insulin resistance and new-onset diabetes are unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of rosuvastatin on insulin resistance and adiponectin in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. In a randomized, prospective, single-blind study, 53 hypertensive patients were randomly assigned to the control group (n=26) or the rosuvastatin (20 mg once daily) group (n=27) during an 8-week treatment period. Both groups showed significant improvements in systolic blood pressure and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) after 8 weeks of treatment. Rosuvastatin treatment improved total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. The control and rosuvastatin treatment groups did not differ significantly in the change in HbA1c (3.0\u00b110.1% vs. -1.3\u00b112.7%; p=0.33), fasting glucose (-1.3\u00b118.0% vs. 2.5\u00b124.1%; p=0.69), or fasting insulin levels (5.2\u00b170.5% vs. 22.6\u00b1133.2%; p=0.27) from baseline. Furthermore, the control and rosuvastatin treatment groups did not differ significantly in the change in the QUICKI insulin sensitivity index (mean change, 2.2\u00b111.6% vs. 3.6\u00b111.9%; p=0.64) or the HOMA index (11.6\u00b194.9% vs. 32.4\u00b1176.7%; p=0.44). The plasma adiponectin level increased significantly in the rosuvastatin treatment group (p=0.046), but did not differ significantly from that in the control group (mean change, 23.2\u00b128.4% vs. 23.1\u00b127.6%; p=0.36). Eight weeks of rosuvastatin (20 mg) therapy resulted in no significant improvement or deterioration in fasting glucose levels, insulin resistance, or adiponectin levels in patients with mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "200": "Statins have been known to significantly reduce cardiovascular events in patients with cardiovascular disease. This review was undertaken to examine the current evidence for the effect of statins in patients with coronary artery disease. Further research is needed to clarify questions concerning the optimal timing, dosage, and type of statin therapy as well as the problems associated with adverse effects.", 
    "201": "Left ventricular hypertrophy is an independent risk factor for major adverse cardiovascular events. Statins have positive effects on this condition; however, the mechanisms are incompletely understood. In this study, we examined whether the effect of simvastatin on left ventricular hypertrophy can be mediated with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)\u03b3-dependent pathway in rabbits with nonischemic heart failure (HF). We induced aortic insufficiency and constriction in 48 rabbits and divided them equally into control, HF, and HF with simvastatin therapy (HF-SIM) groups. The HF-SIM group was given 10 mg/kg/d of simvastatin. We echocardiographically measured baseline and 8-week cardiac structure and function, and we used Western blot, polymerase chain reaction, and electrophoretic analytic techniques to evaluate messenger RNA expression and protein expression and activity. In comparison with the HF group, the HF-SIM rabbits had an increased ejection fraction and decreased left ventricular mass index, interventricular septal thickness, ventricular posterior-wall thickness, and collagen volume fraction. Moreover, the messenger RNA and protein expression of PPAR\u03b3 in the HF-SIM rabbits were significantly higher than those in the HF rabbits; and the activity and expression of nuclear factor-\u03baB subunit p65, RhoA, and Rho GTPase were significantly lower. Our results indicate that simvastatin therapy attenuates the PPAR\u03b3-dependent pathway in association with the inhibition of RhoA and Rho GTPase signaling to inhibit nuclear factor-\u03baB activation, thus preventing the development of left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis in rabbits with nonischemic heart failure."
