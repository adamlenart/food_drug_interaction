Pharmacokinetic data were analyzed from completed single-dose (10-80 mg) studies in Asian and Caucasian subjects. Dose normalized area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum observed concentration (Cmax) (AUC(dn) and Cmax(dn)) were obtained by dividing each value by the administered dose. Dose-per-bodyweight normalized AUC and Cmax (AUC(dn,wt) and Cmax,(dn,wt)) were obtained by dividing each value by the administered dose per unit bodyweight. Mean difference and 90% confidence intervals for Asian versus Caucasian comparisons were calculated for atorvastatin pharmacokinetic values based on the t statistic and expressed as ratios using Caucasians as the reference. Data were analyzed from 310 Asians and 579 Caucasians from 22 studies. AUC(dn) (Asian = 2.35, Caucasian = 2.06 [ng\u00b7hr\u00b7mL(-1)]/mg) and Cmax(dn) (Asian = 0.39, Caucasian = 0.40 Cmax(dn,wt)) and the equivalent dose-per-bodyweight normalized values for atorvastatin (AUC(dn,wt): Asian = 157.5, Caucasian = 156.4 [ng\u00b7hr\u00b7mL(-1)]/[mg\u00b7kg(-1)]; Cmax(dn,wt): Asian = 26.2, Caucasian = 30.3 [ng\u00b7mL(-1)]/[mg\u00b7kg(-1)]) were similar in both ethnic groups. Mean differences and 90% confidence interval for the differences fell within the limits (0.8-1.25) except for Cmax(dn,wt), for which the lower limit was slightly below 80%. No differences were noted in the systemic exposure to atorvastatin between Asian and Caucasian subjects. These data therefore demonstrate that dosing considerations in the current labels for atorvastatin are similar for Asian compared with Caucasian subjects.",

It is closely related to the rebound effects observed with many modern drugs. I review the evidence of the rebound effect of statins that support the similitude principle. In view of their indications in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases, statins are widely prescribed. Besides reducing cholesterol biosynthesis, they provide vasculoprotective effects (pleiotropic effects), including improvement of endothelial function, increased nitric oxide bioavailability, antioxidant properties, inhibition of inflammatory and thrombogenic responses, stabilisation of atherosclerotic plaques, and others. Recent studies suggest that suspension of statin treatment leads to a rebound imparing of vascular function, and increasing morbidity and mortality in patients with vascular diseases. Similarly to other classes of modern palliative drugs, this rebound effect is the same as a secondary action or vital reaction described by Samuel Hahnemann, and used in homeopathy in a therapeutic sense.", 
    "41": "Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is a new gasotransmitter synthesized enzymatically from l-cysteine in cytosol and is oxidized in mitochondria. In the cardiovascular system, H(2)S regulates vascular tone, inhibits atherogenesis, and protects against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. We examined the effect of statins on vascular H(2)S production. Male Wistar rats received pravastatin (40mg/kg/day) or atorvastatin (20mg/kg/day) for 3 weeks and then H(2)S formation was measured in aortic media, periaortic adipose tissue (PAAT) and the liver. Only atorvastatin increased H(2)S production in PAAT whereas both statins stimulated its formation in the liver. Neither statin affected H(2)S production in aortic media. H(2)S formation in post-mitochondrial supernatant was higher than in mitochondria-containing supernatant and was not influenced by statins in any tissue. In addition, oxidation of exogenous H(2)S in isolated liver mitochondria was slower in statin-treated than in control rats. These data indicate that statins increase net H(2)S production by inhibiting its mitochondrial oxidation. Statins had no effect on the activity of H(2)S-metabolizing enzyme, sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase, measured at saturating coenzyme Q concentration. Both statins reduced CoQ(9) concentration in plasma and liver, but only atorvastatin decreased CoQ(9) in PAAT. Atorvastatin attenuated phenylephrine-induced contraction of PAAT+ but not of PAAT- aortic rings. Effects of atorvastatin on net H(2)S production, mitochondrial H(2)S oxidation and aortic contractility were abolished by supplementation of exogenous CoQ(9). In conclusion, lipophilic atorvastatin, but not hydrophilic pravastatin, increases net H(2)S production in perivascular adipose tissue by inhibiting its mitochondrial oxidation. This effect is mediated by statin-induced CoQ(9) deficiency and results in the augmentation of anticontractile effect of perivascular adipose tissue.",

The rate of all events was 62.8 per 1,000 patient-years in the JCAD study. Kaplan-Meier analysis with the log-rank test showed no statistically significant difference in the event rate in each comparison.

The association is continuous without a threshold or dependence on LDL- or non-HDL-cholesterol levels. Mechanistically, elevated Lp(a) levels may either induce a prothrombotic/anti-fibrinolytic effect as apolipoprotein(a) resembles both plasminogen and plasmin but has no fibrinolytic activity, or may accelerate atherosclerosis because, like LDL, the Lp(a) particle is cholesterol-rich, or both.

In this report, we show that the oxidation of simvastatin and lovastatin was catalyzed by wild-type CYP102A1 and a set of its mutants, which were generated by site-directed and random mutagenesis. One major hydroxylated product (6'\u03b2-OH) and one minor product (6'-exomethylene), but not other products, were produced by CYP102A1 mutants. Formation of the metabolites was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography, liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy, and NMR. Chemical methods to synthesize the metabolites of simvastatin and lovastatin have not been reported. These results demonstrate that CYP102A1 mutants can be used to produce human metabolites, especially chiral metabolites, of simvastatin and lovastatin. Our computational findings suggest that a conformational change in the cavity of the mutant active sites is related to the activity change. The modeling results also suggest that the activity change results from the movement of several specific residues in the active sites of the mutants. Furthermore, our computational findings suggest a correlation between the stabilization of the binding site and the catalytic efficiency of CYP102A1 mutants toward simvastatin and lovastatin.",

The anti-inflammatory effects of statins on both pulmonary and systemic inflammation through inhibition of guanosine triphosphatase and nuclear factor-\u03baB mediated activation of inflammatory and matrix remodelling pathways could have substantial benefits in patients with COPD due to the following. 1) Inhibition of cytokine production (tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8) and neutrophil infiltration into the lung; 2) inhibition of the fibrotic activity in the lung leading to small airways fibrosis and irreversible airflow limitation; 3) antioxidant and anti-inflammatory (IL-6 mediated) effects on skeletal muscle; 4) reduced inflammatory response to pulmonary infection; and 5) inhibition of the development (or reversal) of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, a precursor event to lung cancer. This review examines the pleiotropic pharmacological action of statins which inhibit key inflammatory and remodelling pathways in COPD and concludes that statins have considerable potential as adjunct therapy in COPD.", 
    "111": "Statines, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, are widely used to treat hypercholesterinemia. These substances are well tolerated, but myotoxic effects have been reported. The exact mechanisms of the induced myotoxicity are unknown but an involvement of intracellular calcium handling is suspected. Individuals susceptible to malignant hyperthermia (MH) have an impaired calcium homeostasis. An in vitro test measuring contracture responses of isolated muscle bundles is used to investigate cellular processes of MH. Aim of this study was to investigate if statins modify the contracture response of isolated muscle bundles from MH susceptible (MHS) and nonsusceptible (MHN) pigs.", 
    "112": "With approval of the local ethics committee muscle biopsies of 18 MH susceptible and 12 nonsusceptible pigs were performed. Muscle bundles were mounted on an isometric force transducer, preloaded, and electrically stimulated. After establishment of a stable baseline, muscle bundles were exposed to simvastatin, atorvastatin, gemfibrocil, and the pure solvent. Baseline tension was measured and analyzed for changes with P < 0.05 considered to be significant.", 
    "113": "There were no differences in weight, length, and predrug baseline tension between the groups. Both simvastatin and atorvastatin induced significant contractures in muscle bundles from MHS pigs. Gemfibrocil and the solvent methanol showed no effect. In MHN muscle bundles, none of the tested substances induced a contracture. Statines induce contractures only in MHS muscle bundles.", 
    "114": "We therefore conclude that the underlying mechanism may be a pathologic influence on intracellular calcium handling that is absent in MHN. A preexisting impairment of the calcium homeostasis seems to be necessary for this behavior because muscle bundles of MHN pigs showed no pathologic reaction. A higher muscle cell vulnerability toward statins is assumed in MHS patients. Statins ought to be used with caution in these individuals. Analogous a diagnostic workup for MH should be considered for patients with statin-induced rhabdomyolyis.", 
    "115": "Innate inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of atherosclerosis, plaque rupture, thrombosis, and stroke. Inflammatory biomarkers related to innate inflammation, including acute phase proteins, may predict first stroke. The utility of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and other related markers may diminish among populations with established vascular risk. Other biomarkers, including lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2, may provide complementary information about prognosis after stroke or subclinical vascular disease. The innate immune system originally evolved to provide protection against bacterial infections. Moreover, infections may also contribute to stroke risk. Summary measures representing multiple chronic infections have been associated with risk of stroke and atherosclerosis. Acute infections, particularly respiratory infections, have also been found to serve as precipitants of stroke in recent epidemiological studies. These findings could have clinical implications. Further studies are needed to determine the role of innate inflammation and infection in stroke pathogenesis and prevention.", 
    "116": "Statins and antiplatelet agents are currently used as therapeutic agents for patients with acute myocardial infarction. Statins limit myocardial infarct size by activating phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), ecto-5'-nucleotidase, Akt/endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and the downstream effectors inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Inhibition of PI3K, adenosine receptors, eNOS, iNOS, or COX-2 abrogates the protective effects of statins. At >5 mg/kg, aspirin attenuates the myocardial infarct-size-limiting effect of statins. In contrast, the combination of low-dose atoravastatin with either the phosphodiesterase-III inhibitor cilostazol or the adenosine reuptake inhibitor dipyridamole synergistically limits infarct size. Low-dose aspirin with dipyridamole started during ischemia augmented the infarct-size-limiting effects of simvastatin. In contrast, high-dose aspirin blocked the protective effect of simvastatin. The combination of dipyridamole with low-dose aspirin and simvastatin resulted in the smallest infarct size. According to the most current data available, we believe that antiplatelet regimens may require modification for patients who are receiving statins.", 
    "117": "The aim of our study was to compare the effect of simvastatin on systemic inflammation and monocyte secretory function between individuals with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and patients with isolated hypercholesterolaemia. The study included 25 patients with IFG and 23 patients with hypercholesterolaemia. The lipid profile, fasting and 2-hr post-glucose load plasma glucose levels, homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) ratio, glycated haemoglobin, plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels and monocyte release of TNF-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2, interleukin-6 and MCP-1 were assessed at baseline, and after 30 and 90 days of simvastatin treatment (20 mg/daily). Compared to monocytes of the control patients (22 age-, sex- and weight-matched patients without lipid and glucose metabolism abnormalities), monocytes of the patients with hypercholesterolaemia and patients with IFG released greater amounts of all studied cytokines and exhibited higher plasma levels of hsCRP, with no difference between the two groups of patients. Although in both the patients with hypercholesterolaemia and the patients with IFG simvastatin treatment improved lipid profile, it exhibited no effect on glucose metabolism markers. The drug markedly reduced plasma hsCRP and monocyte secretion of TNF-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2, interleukin-6 and MCP-1 in a lipid- and glucose-independent manner. Our results indicate that low-grade systemic inflammation and monocyte secretory function are disturbed to a similar degree in the patients with isolated hypercholesterolaemia and in the patients with IFG. They also show that simvastatin is an effective anti-inflammatory drug in patients with isolated early glucose metabolism abnormalities.", 
    "118": "Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression, in response to various stimuli, has been generally reported to protect against cellular stress. However, we previously demonstrated simvastatin-induced HO-1-exaggerated nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-\u03ba\u03b2) activation and superoxide production on exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The addition of the iron chelator, desferrioxamine, to reduce the accumulation of ferric iron from heme by HO-1 resulted in a blockade of aggravated superoxide production. In this study, we demonstrated that, unlike simvastatin, neither atorvastatin- nor rosuvastatin-induced HO-1 upregulation resulted in increased NF-\u03ba\u03b2 activation and superoxide production of Neuro-2A cells against LPS. Moreover, increased superoxide formation by either atorvastatin or rosuvastatin, in the presence or absence of LPS, could not be reduced by the addition of desferrioxamine, unlike simvastatin. In contrast to our previous experiment, in which simvastatin activated ERK and p38, but not JNK or Akt, both atorvastatin and rosuvastatin phosphorylated ERK, but not p38. Inhibition of p38 activation by 5 \u03bcM of SB203580 effectively reduced exaggerated HO-1 upregulation in cells pretreated with simvastatin, but not atorvastatin or rosuvastatin, plus exposure to LPS. The addition of an ERK inhibitor (50 \u03bcM of PD98059) did not decrease HO-1 upregulation in cells following any statin pretreatment. Further, the effect of simvastatin on primary cultures of cortical neurons was also different from that on Neuro-2A cells, as HO-1 upregulation did not result in exaggerated NF-\u03ba\u03b2 activation and superoxide production. This study demonstrated the involvement of p38 in the differential induction of HO-1 by different statins and showed the different physiological relevance of experiments on different cell types.", 
    "119": "Cardiovascular disease or hypertension is caused by genetic abnormalities and/or environment factors. Molecular biological and biochemical analyses have demonstrated the cardiovascular disease or hypertension is related to increased gene products such as vasoactive peptide, activated signal transduction pathways, and cell surface antigen, etc. Molecular target drugs have been designed to suppress these molecules via receptor, signal transduction pathways, or mRNA. Differing from conventional drug, molecular target drugs show higher specificity for pathophysiology in cardiovascular disease or hypertension. Although term of 'molecular target drug' is not used frequently in the field of cardiovascular or hypertension, I describe in this review, angiotensin receptor blocker, endothelin receptor blocker and statin, because these three drugs are indispensable to treat these diseases in the present clinical setting.",

    "121": "Applying nationwide registries, prescriptions of three categories of cardiovascular drugs were followed for all Danish residents from 1 January 1996 until 2006. The official Danish population forecast 2006-2015 was applied for projecting the population composition. A previously developed pharmacoepidemiological semi-Markov model was extended to apply for projection of future drug utilization. We either assumed that past trends in model parameters (incidence, discontinuation and drug user mortality) would continue during 2006-2015, or that all model parameters would remain unchanged at their values in 2005. Yearly drug expenditure per user of a particular drug was assumed to remain unchanged. Scenarios of future treatment prevalence with different drug categories were modelled by extrapolating future age- and gender-specific parameter values (treatment incidence, discontinuation and drug user mortality) from historic point estimates and their historic trend.", 
    "122": "Provided a continuance of past trends, increasing utilization of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists and statins translates into a rise in annual expenditure of 176%, mainly explained by increases in treatment incidence. Due to pharmacoepidemiological disequilibrium, unchanged model parameters would imply an increase of 64%, ageing alone 14%.",

However, prescribing behaviour is likely to depend on changing clinical guidelines. Despite the limited impact as cost driver, population ageing remains a challenge for future health care services.",

All secondary efficacy variables improved with combination therapy. Combination therapy was generally well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with individual monotherapies. No unexpected muscle, hepatic, or renal safety signals were identified with combination therapy versus individual monotherapies.",

    "128": "It remains unclear whether atherosclerosis in one vascular bed progresses in parallel with that in other vascular beds. We investigated serial changes in vessel wall areas (VWAs) in various vessels over 2 years of follow-up. Vessel wall areas in the thoracic descending aorta (TDA), common carotid artery (CCA), right (RCA), and left main trunk (LMT) of coronary artery were determined in 52 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) using 64-slice multidetector computed tomography. Plasma levels of high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, as well as urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin F2\u03b1 (PGF2\u03b1) were determined at the baseline. After the follow-up period, plaque progression in a specific vessel did not parallel that of other vessels, although changes in TDA-VWAs were weakly correlated with those of LMT-VWAs. Basal levels of hs-CRP, MMP-9, and PGF2\u03b1 did not predict progression or regression of VWAs in any vessels. Multivariate analyses showed that LDL-cholesterol < 100 mg/dl and use of statin emerged as predictors of regressing VWAs in TDA (p < 0.05 and p < 0.05, respectively) and LMT (p < 0.05 and p = 0.13, respectively). Changes in soft plaques over 2 years paralleled those of VWAs in both coronary arteries. In conclusion, the progression or regression of atherosclerotic plaques is inhomogeneous among the vascular beds of patients with CAD.", 
    "129": "Because most of the cardiac risk remains despite successful statin therapy there has been renewed interest in fibrate therapy for persisting hyperlipidaemia. Fibrate therapy lowers triglycerides but causes the urinary loss of betaine, which is an essential metabolite that is involved in osmoregulation, in methyl group metabolism, and which also affects lipid partitioning in the body. Loss of betaine is associated with an elevation of homocysteine and may compromise the potential benefits of fibrate therapy. However, betaine deficiency could be easily and inexpensively corrected by concurrent betaine supplementation. Clinical trials of combinations of betaine and fibrate, to complement statin therapy, are needed to determine the value of these agents in reducing the residual cardiovascular disease risk.", 
    "130": "Experimental animal data suggest that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) might reduce enhanced sympathetic activity, a hallmark of hypertensive patients. This hypothesis was tested for the first time in patients with primary hypertension.", 
    "131": "Using a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over design, a proof-of-principle trial was performed in 13 patients with mild to moderate primary hypertension, who were randomly assigned to a regimen of atorvastatin (80mg/day) for 3 weeks, followed by placebo for 3 weeks or to a regimen of placebo for 3 weeks, followed by atorvastatin (80mg/day) for 3 weeks. Microneurography was used at the end of each treatment period to measure sympathetic nervous system activity (muscle sympathetic nerve activity: MSNA). Heart rate variability (HRV) and plasma norepinephrine concentrations were also measured. Additionally, effects on blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were assessed by 24-h ambulatory BP measurement. Atorvastatin reduced postganglionic MSNA (atorvastatin 35.0\u00b12.0 vs placebo: 39.2\u00b11.5 bursts/min, P=0.008) and heart frequency corrected MSNA (atorvastatin: 58.5\u00b12.0 vs placebo: 64.7\u00b13.0 bursts/100 beats, P=0.02). Atorvastatin had no significant effect on plasma norepinephrine levels, HRV, BP or HR.",

    "134": "Six hundred and eight chronic HF patients were randomized to n-3 PUFA (n=312) or placebo (n=296); a second randomization was performed to rosuvastatin (n=212) or placebo (n=207). Echocardiographic examinations were recorded at baseline and at 1, 2, and 3 years; offline analysis was performed by a core laboratory to ensure consistent quantitative analysis. Baseline LV ejection fraction (EF) was 30% (95%CI 29-31). Left ventricular ejection fraction increased with n-3 PUFA by 8.1% at 1 year, 11.1% at 2 years, and 11.5% at 3 years vs. 6.3% at 1 year, 8.2% at 2 years, and 9.9% at 3 years in the placebo group (P=0.0050).

In the type I collagen synthesis assay, all simvastatin-loaded groups showed an increase, and the effect was inverse dose dependent (maximal at 10(-7) mol/L). This stimulatory effect of simvastatin was also observed in the osteocalcin release assay (P < .05; at 10(-7) mol/L, 10(-6) mol/L, maximal at 10(-7) mol/L).",

    "140": "Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) binds to apolipoprotein E and serves as a receptor for remnant lipoproteins in the liver, thus playing an important role in clearing these atherogenic particles. In this study, we investigated the effect of atorvastatin, a hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, on hepatic LRP1 expression. We used HepG2 and Hep3B cells for in vitro study, and Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty and Sprague-Dawley rats for in vivo study. We used relatively high pharmacologic dose of atorvastatin in this study (in vitro, 0.5 \u03bcmol/L in culture media, for 48 hours; in vivo, 20 mg/[kg d], for 6 weeks). Atorvastatin increased LRP1 and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor expression in HepG2 and Hep3B cells and induced hepatic LRP1 and LDL receptor expression in chow diet-fed Sprague-Dawley rats and high-fat diet-fed Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty rats. Atorvastatin decreased intracellular sterol level and increased the amount of the nuclear form of sterol response element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) in both HepG2 and Hep3B cells as well as in two animal models. Treatment of HepG2 cells with LDL increased intracellular sterol level and reduced LRP1, LDL receptor, and SREBP-2. When SREBP-2 in HepG2 cells was knocked down by small interfering RNA, the induction of LRP1 expression by atorvastatin did not take place. In conclusion, up-regulation of hepatic LRP1 might be a novel mechanism by which statin treatment decreases remnant lipoproteins. In addition, SREBP-2 acts as a mediator of atorvastatin-induced up-regulation of hepatic LRP1. Future studies using standard doses of atorvastatin in humans are needed to elucidate clinical relevance of these findings.", 
    "141": "It has been reported that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as atorvastatin induce vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) apoptosis in vitro. However, this effect remains to be demonstrated in vivo. The present studies were designed to test the ability of atorvastatin to induce SMC apoptosis in vivo, using the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) as a well-known reference model of SMC apoptosis induction in vivo by cardiovascular drugs including the calcium channel blocker amlodipine. Atorvastatin was administered to SHR for 3 or 6 weeks either alone or together with amlodipine, a drug combination clinically available to patients. Primary endpoints included aortic medial hypertrophy and aortic SMC hyperplasia, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and expression of the apoptosis regulatory proteins Bax and Bcl-2. The SHR aorta showed no evidence of SMC apoptosis induction by atorvastatin, even at the high dose of 50 mg kg(-1) day(-1), although the statin significantly reduced oxidative stress after 3 weeks and blood pressure after 6 weeks of administration. Amlodipine-induced regression of aortic hypertophy and aortic SMC hyperplasia were dose- and time-dependent, but there was no interaction between atorvastatin and amlodipine in modulating the primary endpoints. These results do not support the notion that atorvastatin induces SMC apoptosis in the aortic media in vivo.",

At 12 months there was an increase in ambulatory activity of 1351 and 1849 steps/day in the standard and pedometer group, respectively, compared with control conditions; however, there was no significant change in markers of chronic low-grade inflammation. Across the pooled study sample, change in ambulatory activity was significantly correlated with change in interleukin-6 (r = -0.32, P = 0.01) after adjustment for group, age, sex, ethnicity, aspirin and statin medication, baseline body mass index and change in body mass index.

Furthermore, they attenuate oxidative stress, inflammation, and the prothrombotic response. These diverse biological actions may explain their perioperative protective effects, especially in patients undergoing cardiac and major vascular procedures. Beyond reductions in perioperative mortality and cardiorenal complications, recent evidence also suggests outcome benefits from statin exposure in sepsis, airway hyperreactivity, and venous thromboembolism. It is likely that these agents will be increasingly prescribed perioperatively as high-quality evidence from well-designed randomized trials becomes available in the near future.",

    "151": "Statin treatment has been shown to reduce graft-versus-host disease while preserving graft-versus-tumor effect in allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Herein, we investigated whether lovastatin treatment affects the function of human cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Upon T-cell receptor stimulation, lovastatin significantly inhibited the proliferation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from healthy donors whereas their intracellular cytokine production including interferon-\u03b3 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 remained the same with a slight decrease of interleukin-2. Moreover, the specific lysis of target cells by CTL lines derived from patients and normal donors specific for Epstein-Barr virus-encoded antigen latent membrane protein-2 or cytomegalovirus-encoded antigen pp65 was uncompromised in the presence of lovastatin. In addition, we evaluated the effect of lovastatin on the proliferation and effector function of the CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) derived from melanoma patients specific for MART-1 antigen. Lovastatin significantly reduced the expansion of antigen-specific TILs upon MART-1 stimulation. However, the effector function of TILs, including the specific lysis of target cells and secretion of cytokine interferon-\u03b3, remained intact with lovastatin treatment. Taken together, these data demonstrated that lovastatin inhibits the proliferation of Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and MART-1-specific CTLs without affecting cytolytic capacity. The differential effect of lovastatin on the proliferation versus cytotoxicity of CTLs might shed some light on elucidating the possible mechanisms of graft-versus-host disease and graft-versus-tumor effect elicited by alloimmune responses.",

In postprandial samples, FE misclassified 38% of patients (two-thirds of statin users) into lower Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) risk categories. Greater disagreement between fasting and postprandial LDL-C was observed in individuals with postprandial triglyceride concentrations >2.08 mmol/L (>184 mg/dL) and in women (interactions: P \u2264 0.038).",

    "164": "Statins are inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis and protein prenylation that also have been studied in cancer therapy and chemoprevention. With regard to natural killer (NK) cells, only inhibitory effects of statins such as suppression of granule exocytosis have been reported so far. In this study, we show that statins can cooperate with IL-2 to potently induce the activation of CD56(dim) NK cells in a synergistic, time- and dose-dependent fashion. Supplementation experiments revealed that the statin effect was specific to inhibition of their target hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and that downstream depletion of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate was responsible for cooperating with IL-2 in NK cell activation. Mechanistic studies revealed that CD56(+)HLA-DR(+)CD14(+) dendritic cell (DC)-like accessory cells mediated the ability of statin to activate NK cells. In contrast, BDCA-1(+) (CD1c(+)) myeloid DCs, which partially expressed CD56, were somewhat less potent. Conventional blood monocytes, which lack CD56, exhibited the lowest accessory cell capacity. NK cell IFN-\u03b3 production was IL-12 independent but required endogenous IL-18, IL-1\u03b2, and caspase-1 activity. Statins directly induced apoptosis in human cancer cell lines and cooperated with NK cell-derived IFN-\u03b3 to generate potent cytotoxic antitumor effects in vitro even in the presence of statin-mediated inhibitory effects on granule exocytosis. Our work reveals novel and unexpected immunomodulatory properties of statins, which might be harnessed for the treatment of cancer.", 
    "165": "Arsenic is an environmental toxicant that reduces the lifespan of circulating erythrocytes during chronic exposure. Our previous studies had indicated involvement of hypercholesterolemia and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in arsenic-induced apoptotic death of erythrocytes. In this study, we have shown an effective recovery from arsenic-induced death signaling in erythrocytes in response to treatment with atorvastatin (ATV) and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) in rats. Our results emphasized on the importance of cholesterol in the promotion of ROS-mediated Fas signaling in red cells. Arsenic-induced activation of caspase 3 was associated with phosphatidylserine exposure on the cell surface and microvesiculation of erythrocyte membrane. Administration of NAC in combination with ATV, proved to be more effective than either of the drugs alone towards the rectification of arsenic-mediated disorganization of membrane structural integrity, and this could be linked with decreased ROS accumulation through reduced glutathione (GSH) repletion along with cholesterol depletion. Moreover, activation of caspase 3 was capable of promoting aggregation of band 3 with subsequent binding of autologous IgG and opsonization by C3b that led to phagocytosis of the exposed cells by the macrophages. NAC-ATV treatment successfully amended these events and restored lifespan of erythrocytes from the exposed animals almost to the control level. This work helped us to identify intracellular membrane cholesterol enrichment and GSH depletion as the key regulatory points in arsenic-mediated erythrocyte destruction and suggested a therapeutic strategy against Fas-activated cell death related to enhanced cholesterol and accumulation of ROS.",

In the present investigation, we analyzed whether treatment with rosuvastatin, an inhibitor of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, would prevent the increases in inflammatory microglia and IL-6 levels in the brain and plasma of WT and ApoE-/- mice. We report that a HC diet resulted in an increased microglia load in the brains of WT and ApoE-/- mice, in support of our previous study. Treatment with rosuvastatin significantly decreased the microglia load in the brains of WT and ApoE-/- mice on a HC diet. Rosuvastatin treatment resulted in lowered plasma IL-6 levels in WT mice on a HC diet. However, in the present study the number of IL-6 positive cells in the brain was not significantly affected by a HC diet. A recent clinical study has shown that rosuvastatin reduces risk of ischemic stroke in patients with high plasma levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein by 50%. The results from our study show that rosuvastatin reduces inflammatory cells in the brain. This finding is essential for furthering the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and stroke.",

Indeed, increments in the serum levels of triglycerides (TG) and cholesterols are positively related with colon carcinogenesis. We previously reported that an age-dependent hyperlipidemic state is characteristic of Min mice, an animal model for human familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). However, qualitative and quantitative changes of lipid metabolism are poorly understood in this state. Here, we provide detailed analysis of serum lipids in Min mice using reverse-phased liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (RPLC/ESI-MS). We also demonstrate local analysis of lipid droplets in the villi of the small intestine using laser capture microdissection and a sensitive chip-based nanoESI-MS system. As a result, oxidized phosphatidylcholines (PC) such as aldehyde and carboxylic acid types were increased, even at an early stage of intestinal polyp formation in serum. In addition, hydroperoxidizable TG precursors containing linoleic acid (18:2n-6) were deposited at the tip of the villi with aging, and these hydroperoxidized TG were also increased in serum. Meanwhile, increments of the oxidizable TG precursors in serum and small intestinal mucosa were suppressed by treatment with pitavastatin, a novel third generation lipophilic statin. These results suggest that quantitative and qualitative lipid changes such as hydroperoxidizable TG precursors are important in the course of intestinal polyp formation and oxidative stress might lead to the development of intestinal polyp formation in Min mice.",

The functional activities and simultaneous expression of NTCP and OATP1B1 were confirmed by the uptake of taurocholate and estrone-3-sulphate as representative substrates for NTCP and OATP1B1, respectively, and by an immunofluorescence analysis. The substrate specificities of NTCP and OATP1B1 for statins and the effects of genetic variations on the uptake of rosuvastatin, pitavastatin, and atorvastatin were measured. Based on the K(m) values and intrinsic clearances of the three statins, pitavastatin was taken up more efficiently than rosuvastatin and atorvastatin by OATP1B1. Consequently, the cellular accumulation of pitavastatin was modulated according to the genetic variation of OATP1B1 (OATP1B1*15), rather than NTCP*2. In contrast, NTCP*2 displayed greater transport of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, compared with NTCP wild type. Thus, the measurements of decreased rosuvastatin and atorvastatin transport by OATP1B1*15 were confounded by the presence of NTCP and its genetic variant, NTCP*2. In conclusion, the functional consequences of genetic variants of NTCP and OATP1B1 may be different for various statins, depending on the substrate specificity of the OATP1B1 and NTCP transporters.",

Wall thickness and volume, lipid-core volume, and fibrous cap thickness (by MRI) and plasma RANTES levels (by ELISA) were measured. Regression analysis was performed to study the associations between MRI variables and RANTES. Among 1769 inclusive participants, multivariable regression analysis revealed that total wall volume [beta-coefficient (\u03b2) = 0.09, P = 0.008], maximum wall thickness (\u03b2 = 0.08, P = 0.01), vessel wall area (\u03b2 = 0.07, P = 0.02), mean minimum fibrous cap thickness (\u03b2 = 0.11, P = 0.03), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (\u03b2 = 0.09, P = 0.01) were positively associated with RANTES.

Statin use may modify the association between RANTES and carotid atherosclerosis. Furthermore, RANTES levels vary by race.", 
    "184": "Recent studies have reported an inverse association between statin use and risk of advanced prostate cancer. Thus, it is possible that statin exposure delays progression of prostate tumors to an advanced stage. The study by Gutt and colleagues gives two important contributions to this field of research. With a cohort of 691 men undergoing curative-intent radiation therapy for prostate cancer between 1996 and 2008, and with a median follow-up of 50 months, they demonstrate that statin use is associated with improved relapse-free survival. The result supports the idea that statins could delay prostate cancer progression. In addition, they demonstrate that low low-density lipoprotein levels are associated with improved relapse-free survival, supporting the idea that the prostate cancer progression-preventing effects of statins could be, at least in part, mediated by their systemic low-density lipoprotein-lowering effect. The study adds to the growing body of evidence on statins' benefits against prostate cancer. The results have important implications when designing possible future clinical studies on this topic.", 
    "185": "Development of effective treatments for patients with Alzheimer disease has been challenging. Currently approved treatments include acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine hydrochloride. To investigate treatments in development for patients with Alzheimer disease, the author conducted a review of the literature. New approaches for treatment or prevention focus on several general areas, including cholinergic receptor agonists, drugs to decrease \u03b2-amyloid and tau levels, antiinflammatory agents, drugs to increase nitric oxide and cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels, and substances to reduce cell death or promote cellular regeneration. The author focuses on medications currently in clinical trials. Cholinergic agents include orthostatic and allosteric muscarinic M1 agonists and nicotinic receptor agonists. Investigational agents that target \u03b2-amyloid include vaccines, antibodies, and inhibitors of \u03b2-amyloid production. Anti-inflammatory agents, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the natural product curcumin, and the tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 inhibitor etanercept, have also been studied. Some drugs currently approved for other uses may also show promise for treatment of patients with Alzheimer disease. Results of clinical trials with many of these investigational drugs have been disappointing, perhaps because of their use with patients in advanced stages of Alzheimer disease. Effective treatment may need to begin earlier-before neurodegeneration becomes severe enough for symptoms to appear.", 
    "186": "We have previously documented inequalities in the quality of medical care provided to those with mental ill health but the implications for mortality are unclear. We aimed to test whether disparities in medical treatment of cardiovascular conditions, specifically receipt of medical procedures and receipt of prescribed medication, are linked with elevated rates of mortality in people with schizophrenia and severe mental illness. We undertook a systematic review of studies that examined medical procedures and a pooled analysis of prescribed medication in those with and without comorbid mental illness, focusing on those which recruited individuals with schizophrenia and measured mortality as an outcome. From 17 studies of treatment adequacy in cardiovascular conditions, eight examined cardiac procedures and nine examined adequacy of prescribed cardiac medication. Six of eight studies examining the adequacy of cardiac procedures found lower than average provision of medical care and two studies found no difference. Meta-analytic pooling of nine medication studies showed lower than average rates of prescribing evident for the following individual classes of medication; angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (n = 6, aOR = 0.779, 95% CI = 0.638-0.950, p = 0.0137), beta-blockers (n = 9, aOR = 0.844, 95% CI = 0.690-1.03, p = 0.1036) and statins (n = 5, aOR = 0.604, 95% CI = 0.408-0.89, p = 0.0117). No inequality was evident for aspirin (n = 7, aOR = 0.986, 95% CI = 0.7955-1.02, p = 0.382). Interestingly higher than expected prescribing was found for older non-statin cholesterol-lowering agents (n = 4, aOR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.04-2.32, p = 0.0312). A search for outcomes in this sample revealed ten studies linking poor quality of care and possible effects on mortality in specialist settings. In half of the studies there was significantly higher mortality in those with mental ill health compared with controls but there was inadequate data to confirm a causative link. Nevertheless, indirect evidence supports the observation that deficits in quality of care are contributing to higher than expected mortality in those with severe mental illness (SMI) and schizophrenia. The quality of medical treatment provided to those with cardiac conditions and comorbid schizophrenia is often suboptimal and may be linked with avoidable excess mortality. Every effort should be made to deliver high-quality medical care to people with severe mental illness.", 
    "187": "Lowering LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) with statins decreases cardiovascular risk; therefore LDL-C is the primary target in lipid therapy. The amount of risk reduction is the greater, the lower the LDL-C values achieved by statin therapy are. Current guidelines therefore require an LDL-C as low as < 70 mg/dl in patients who are at a very high risk of cardiovascular events. This stringent treatment goal depending on the baseline LDL-C values typically can only be obtained with higher doses of potent statins. Randomised trials demonstrate the efficacy of high-dose therapy with atorvastatin 80 mg/day with regard to the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients after acute coronary syndromes (PROVE-IT TIMI 22 trial), in patients with stable coronary artery disease (TNT trial), and in patients after stroke or TIA (SPARCL trial). Moreover, potent statin treatment reduces the progression of coronary atherosclerosis (REVERSAL and ASTEROID trials). Furthermore, large meta-analyses of the efficacy of high-dose statin therapy confirm its safety; in particular, muscle-related adverse events are not more frequent than with standard statin doses. It is recommended that evidence-based statin doses be used in clinical practice; the dosages used in clinical trials should be given rather than titrating patients to LDL-C targets by increasing statin doses in a stepwise manner. Whether the strong LDL-C lowering combination of simvastatin plus ezetimibe will reduce cardiovascular events over and above simvastatin monotherapy is currently being tested in the ongoing IMPROVE-IT trial. Importantly, despite the large body of evidence in favour of high-dose statin therapy for patients at high cardiovascular risk, high-dose statin therapy is still underused and LDL-C goals are still not met in the majority of these patients.",

In the assay used in period 3, there are 290 samples with D-LDL-C values between 100 and 130 mg/dL. Of these, only 182 samples show agreement with C-LDL-C values, whereas 90 samples with a D-LDL-C in the 100- to 130-mg/dL range are in the 70- to 100-mg/dL range using the C-LDL-C assay.

The cholesterol-independent or \"pleiotropic\" effects of statins include the upregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Here we determined whether eNOS associated with Hsp70 expression is involved in rosuvastatin resistance to obstruction-induced oxidative stress and cell death. Neonatal rats subjected to unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) within two days of birth and controls were treated daily with vehicle or rosuvastatin (10 mg/kg/day) for 14 days. Decreased endogenous nitric oxide (NO) and lower mRNA and protein eNOS expression associated with downregulation of heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1) mRNA and Hsp70 protein levels were observed in the obstructed kidney cortex. Increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADHP) oxidase activity and apoptosis induction, regulated by mitochondrial signal pathway through an increased pro-apoptotic Bax/BcL(2) ratio and caspase 3 activity, were demonstrated. Conversely, in cortex membrane fractions from rosuvastatin-treated UUO rats, marked upregulation of eNOS expression at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels linked to increased Hsf1 mRNA expression and enhanced mRNA and protein Hsp70 expression, were observed. Consequently, there was an absence of apoptotic response and transiently decreased NADPH oxidase activity. In addition, interaction between eNOS and Hsp70 was determined by communoprecipitation in cortex membrane fractions, showing an increased ratio of both proteins, after rosuvastatin treatment in obstructed kidney. In summary, our data demonstrate that the effect of rosuvastatin on eNOS interacting with Hsp70, results in the capacity of both to prevent mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and oxidative stress in neonatal early kidney obstruction.",

Tight glucose and blood pressure control has been shown to significantly decrease the risk of development as well as the progression of retinopathy and represents the cornerstone of medical management of DR. The two most threatening complications of DR are diabetic macular edema (DME) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Photocoagulation is standard treatment for both DME and PDR. However, some patients suffer permanent visual loss despite therapy. Treatment with fibrates first showed reduction in hard exudates, an effect subsequently shown with statins in short term studies, in particular two randomized studies in patients with macular edema. In the FIELD study which pre-specified microvascular outcomes, fenofibrate reduced laser treatment for DME or PDR by 31%:164 (3.4%) patients on fenofibrate vs. 238 (4.9%) on placebo (p<0.001).

Conversely, there was no reduction in laser treatment or reduced progression of retinopathy in two large scale studies of statins where cardiovascular events were significantly reduced. Neither class of lipid-lowering drugs consistently improved visual acuity. In the ACCORD-EYE study, the combination of fenofibrate and simvastatin reduced by 40% the rate of progression of diabetic retinopathy compared with simvastatin alone. Other studies are needed to establish the place of lipid lowering drugs in the treatment of macular edema and the prevention of vision loss.", 
    "203": "A highly enantioselective synthesis of (+)- and (-)-fluvastatin and their analogues has been facilitated by the reaction of an aldehyde with diketene in the presence of Ti(O-i-Pr)4 and a chiral Schiff base ligand. Either enantiomer of the Schiff base could be employed to obtain (+)- or (-)-fluvastatin. Diastereoselective reductions of the resultant keto moiety of \u03b2-hydroxy ketoesters provided the syn-1,3-diol esters (91% ee), which were subsequently recrystallized and saponified to afford (+)- and (-)-fluvastatin in >99.9% ee.", 
    "204": "To investigate the effect of simvastatin on inducing endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) homing and promoting bone defect repair, and to explore the mechanism of local implanting simvastatin in promoting bone formation.", 
    "205": "Simvastatin (50 mg) compounded with polylactic acid (PLA, 200 mg) or only PLA (200 mg) was dissolved in acetone (1 mL) to prepare implanted materials (Simvastatin-PLA material, PLA material). EPCs were harvested from bone marrow of 2 male rabbits and cultured with M199; after identified by immunohistochemistry, the cell suspension of EPCs at the 3rd generation (2 x 10(6) cells/mL) was prepared and transplanted into 12 female rabbits through auricular veins (2 mL). After 3 days, the models of cranial defect with 15 cm diameter were made in the 12 female rabbits. And the defects were repaired with Simvastatin-PLA materials (experimental group, n=6) and PLA materials (control group, n=6), respectively. The bone repair was observed after 8 weeks of operation by gross appearance, X-ray film, and histology; gelatin-ink perfusion and HE staining were used to show the new vessels formation in the defect. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed to show the EPCs homing at the defect site.", 
    "206": "All experimental animals of 2 groups survived to the end of the experiment. After 8 weeks in experimental group, new bone formation was observed in the bone defect by gross and histology, and an irregular, hyperdense shadow by X-ray film; no similar changes were observed in control group. FISH showed that the male EPC containing Y chromosome was found in the wall of new vessels in the defect of experimental group, while no male EPC containing Y chromosome was found in control group. The percentage of new bone formation in defect area was 91.63% +/- 4.07% in experimental group and 59.45% +/- 5.43% in control group, showing significant difference (P < 0.05).", 
    "207": "Simvastatin can promote bone defect repair, and its mechanism is probably associated with inducing EPCs homing and enhancing vasculogenesis.", 
    "208": "Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have increased cancer risks. The authors reported nonlinear associations of cancer with triglyceride and other lipids in T2DM. Crosstalk between lipid metabolism and the renin-angiotensin system may increase cancer risk via activation of insulin-like growth factor-1 pathway in T2DM. In this analysis, the authors explored associations of cancer risk with high/low triglyceride in T2DM and possible modifying effects of statins on this risk association, if any.", 
    "209": "A consecutive cohort of 5166 Chinese patients with T2DM, free of cancer at enrollment and not using statins at or before enrollment, was analyzed using Cox models. Biological interactions were estimated using relative excess risk because of interaction, attributable proportion because of interaction, and synergy index. Relative excess risk because of interaction > 0, attributable proportion because of interaction > 0, or synergy index > 1 indicates biological interaction.", 
    "210": "During 5.25 years of follow-up (median), 4.7% (n = 243) patients developed cancer. Triglyceride < 1.70 mmol/L was associated with increased cancer risk in the entire cohort and in statin nonusers, but not in statin users. Patients with triglyceride < 1.70 mmol/L plus nonuse of statins during follow-up had 2.74-fold increased cancer risk compared with their counterparts with either triglyceride \u2265 1.70 mmol/L or use of statins or both. There was significant interaction between triglyceride < 1.70 mmol/L and nonuse of statins (relative excess risk because of interaction, 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.07-1.90 and attributable proportion because of interaction, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.02-0.70).", 
    "211": "In Chinese T2DM patients, triglyceride < 1.70 mmol/L might be associated with increased cancer risk, which was attenuated in the presence of use of statins.", 
    "212": "The aim of this study was to measure the consumption of serum lipid reducing drugs in Serbia from 2004 to 2008, to compare this data with that from Scandinavian countries, and to compare the consumption of lipid lowering drugs and the rate of mortality from cardiovascular diseases in these countries.", 
    "213": "A population-based study was undertaken to analyse lipid lowering drug consumption using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical/Defined Daily Dose methodology. Cause-specific mortality rates were obtained from the WHOSIS annual report for the year 2009.", 
    "214": "In 2008, a total of 1207.44 DDD/1000 inh/day of all drugs, was used in Serbia, of which 38.89% belonged to drugs for cardiovascular diseases. While in Scandinavian countries 17.03-24.80% of drugs for cardiovascular diseases belonged to lipid-lowering drugs, in Serbia it was substantially lower (3%). In 2004 in Serbia, 1.50 DDD/1000 inh/day of statins were used. In 2008, this value was 14.24 DDD/1000 inh/day. In every investigated country, simvastatin made up more than 50% of the consumption of statins. After simvastatin, the next most frequently used statin was atorvastatin, with 5.52, 11.00, 11.17 and 24.82 DDD/1000 inh/day, in Serbia, Denmark, Finland and Norway, respectively. In 2004 Serbia has the highest mortality rate for cardiovascular diseases among investigated countries with 762/100.000 inhabitants and Norway has the lowest rate with 158/100.000 inhabitants.", 
    "215": "The use of lipid lowering drugs is 6-8 times lower in Serbia than in Scandinavian countries but there is an evident rise in lipid lowering drugs consumption in Serbia during years.", 
    "216": "The aim of this study was to determine whether or not statins influence biochemical recurrence (BCR) in Korean patients undergoing surgical treatment for prostate cancer. We reviewed data from 687 men who underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy and who did not receive neoadjuvant treatment. Of these patients, 87 reported the use of preoperative statins at surgery. BCR-free survival was determined after exclusion of 78 patients with lymph node metastases and/or who received immediate adjuvant treatment. Patients on statin therapy were more likely to have a co-morbid disease (P < 0.05). Mean PSA (9.6 vs 13.6 ng ml(-1), P = 0.002) and PSA density (0.27 vs 0.38 ng ml(-1) ml(-1), P<0.001) were significantly lower in patients on statins. However, in the multivariable linear regression model, statin use was not associated with a decrease in PSA. Overall BCR for the entire cohort was not significantly different between the statin and nonstatin groups. On multivariate analysis, positive surgical margin and seminal vesicle invasion were independent risk factors for BCR-free survival, whereas other variables, including statin use, were not significant in predicting the risk of BCR. Patients with positive surgical margin and seminal vesicle invasion had a 2.1- (odds ratio, 2.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.29-3.57; P = 0.003) and 2.2-fold risk (odds ratio, 2.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-3.89; P = 0.006) of BCR. Preoperative statin use is not associated with reduced BCR following radical prostatectomy."
