Despite success reducing LDL and cholesterol, atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction remain significant challenges. However, mechanisms of the reverse cholesterol transport system might be used more effectively in the foreseeable future. Although the benefit of high HDL cholesterol appears to be obvious, most clinical trials aimed at increasing HDL cholesterol failed to generate convincing results. Therefore, the question arises as to whether indeed only HDL level or perhaps rather more HDL function is of considerable therapeutic relevance. If function is the crucial issue drugs such as CETP (cholesteryl ester transfer protein) activators or SR-B1 (scavenger receptor type B-1) upregulators could be beneficial. These types of drugs could improve HDL metabolism and might have beneficial effects despite the fact that they lower HDL levels. Ongoing studies on next generation CETP inhibitors and nicotinic acid will clarify this question and might help in our struggle against atherosclerosis.",

A challenge with existing methods is that the user is often required to elicit prior distributions for high-dimensional parameters that model competing bias scenarios. This can render the methods unwieldy. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to adjust for unmeasured confounding that derives default priors for bias parameters for observational studies with binary covariates. The confounding effects of measured and unmeasured variables are treated as exchangeable within a Bayesian framework. We model the joint distribution of covariates by using a log-linear model with pairwise interaction terms. Hierarchical priors constrain the magnitude and direction of bias parameters. An appealing property of the method is that the conditional distribution of the unmeasured confounder follows a logistic model, giving a simple equivalence with previously proposed methods. We apply the method in a data example from pharmacoepidemiology and explore the impact of different priors for bias parameters on the analysis results.",

Patients undergoing CXRT for locally advanced colorectal or esophageal cancer (n=103) reported multiple symptoms weekly via the M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) from start of therapy. Serum samples were collected weekly to examine changes in inflammatory markers (interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and soluble receptor 1 for tumor necrosis factor (sTNF-R1)) via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Relationships between symptom severity and inflammatory-marker concentration levels were estimated using mixed-effect regression analysis, controlled for week of therapy, age, sex, body mass index, pre-CXRT tumor stage, pre-CXRT chemotherapy, pre-CXRT statin use, and type of cancer. Fatigue was the most severe symptom over time, its development profile shared with pain, distress, drowsiness, poor appetite, and disturbed sleep. sTNF-R1 and IL-6 shared a similar pattern of symptom development, with significant increase during CXRT and decrease after completion of CXRT. Serum concentrations of sTNF-R1 were positively associated over time with the severity of fatigue (p=0.00097), while sTNF-R1 and IL-6 were positively related to the severity of a component score of the six most severe symptoms (both p<0.0001).

    "58": "Statins have been successfully used in patients with hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular diseases, but there is increasing evidence that they exert effects by much exceeding the lowering of cholesterol levels. Statins have antiatherosclerotic, antiinflammatory, antioxidant, immunomodulatory and antithrombotic effects. These \"pleiotropic\" effects stem from their inhibition of prenylation of the small GTP-binding proteins Ras and Rho, and to the disruption, or depletion, of cholesterol rich membrane micro-domains (membrane rafts). Through these pathways statins modulate immune responses by altering cytokine levels and by affecting the function of cells involved in both innate and adaptive responses. Anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressory properties of statins provide the rationale for their potential application in conditions in which the inflammation and immune response represent key pathogenic mechanisms, such as antiphospholipid syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Reduction of atherosclerosis progression in autoimmunity is also a very important effect. Statins pathways of action in systemic autoimmune diseases, and their potential therapeutic use are discussed in this review. The inhibition of mevalonate pathway by statins impairs modification of Ras and Rho GTPases, which play key roles in signaling pathways related to tumor formation, metastasis and cell death. There is experimental and clinical evidence that statins may improve the therapeutic outcome of anticancer drugs. Thus, this review will also discuss recent insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the anticancer effects of statins and their assessment as promising candidates for inclusion into current therapeutic regimens for the treatment of malignant diseases.",

Although dietary flavonoids have been shown to reduce CVD risk factors in healthy participants, no long-term trials have examined the additional benefits of flavonoids to CVD risk in medicated postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes. We conducted a parallel-design, placebo-controlled trial with type 2 diabetic patients randomized to consume 27 g/day (split dose) flavonoid-enriched chocolate (containing 850 mg flavan-3-ols [90 mg epicatechin] and 100 mg isoflavones [aglycone equivalents)]/day) or matched placebo for 1 year.",

    "63": "The management of infrapopliteal peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAD) is challenging. For patients with asymptomatic disease or claudication, exercise and optimal medical management, including antiplatelet agents, blood pressure control, statin therapy and tight glucose control for patients with diabetes mellitus, are the mainstays of therapy. However, patients with isolated tibial artery occlusive disease often have diabetes mellitus or renal insufficiency and present with critical limb ischemia (CLI). CLI is advanced occlusive disease marked by the development of rest pain, ischemic ulceration, or gangrene and is associated with a high mortality rate. Limb salvage requires an intervention in cases of CLI, but careful operative planning is required as patients often have multilevel disease and limited options for revascularization. A surgical bypass with a vein graft remains the best treatment for infrapopliteal PAD, especially in patients with a life expectancy of over 2\u00a0years. Balloon angioplasty can play an important role in limb salvage, especially for patients lacking adequate vein for bypass, at high operative risk, or with a life expectancy of less than 2\u00a0years. However, a lack of rigorous trials has left unanswered questions as to the efficacy of infrapopliteal angioplasty with or without stents compared to bypass surgery. As such, endovascular therapy is currently not a proven treatment for intermittent claudication. Patients who are unable to undergo a revascularization procedure for infrapopliteal CLI have few options besides amputation or palliation. New therapies, such as drug-eluting stents, drug-coated balloons, and stem cell therapy are under development, but their efficacy and effectiveness remain unproven.",

Fibric acid derivatives reduce fasting triglyceride (TG) values by 15% to 50% (depending on baseline level) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 8%, and raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) by 9%. In conjunction with a statin, the amount of TG lowering is approximately doubled with the addition of the fibrate. When measured, fibrates decrease the TG concentration of very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol particles while increasing the TG content of LDL particles. The mean size of LDL particles increases and there is a substantial reduction in the number and proportion of small, dense LDL. In randomized trials in primary and secondary prevention populations, fibrates were associated with a significant reduction in nonfatal myocardial infarction in most studies. In the subgroup with elevated TG and/or depressed HDL-C at baseline, all trials have found statistically significant relative risk reductions of 27% to 65% in the primary cardiovascular endpoint of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death.",

Next, we demonstrate that statin administration aggravates lung injury and fibrosis in bleomycin-treated mice. Statin pretreatment enhances caspase-1-mediated immune responses in vivo and in vitro; the latter responses were abolished in bone marrow-derived macrophages isolated from Nlrp3(-/-) and Casp1(-/-) mice.

All 46 protein- and RNA-encoding genes are located on one strand and apparently transcribed in one direction. Comparative analysis of this mtDNA and previously sequenced but unannotated mitochondrial genomes of several medically and industrially important species of the Aspergillus/Penicillium group revealed their extensive similarity in terms of size, gene content and sequence, which is also reflected in the almost perfect conservation of mitochondrial gene order in Penicillium and Aspergillus.

Mixed dyslipidemia, characterized by elevated triglyceride and apoC-III levels and low HDL cholesterol level, with or without elevated LDL cholesterol, increases cardiovascular disease risk and is commonly treated with combined statin and fibrate therapy. We sought to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with apoC-III level response to combination therapy with statins and fenofibric acid (FA) in individuals with mixed dyslipidemia. Participants (n = 1,250) in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study examining response to FA alone and in combination with statin were genotyped for candidate SNPs. Multivariate linear regression and two-way ANOVA for percent change in apoC-III level were performed.

A haplotype composed of the minor alleles of these SNPs, with 2% population frequency, was associated with an unexpected apoC-III increase in response to statins and FA. This is the first report to show that genetic variation within the LPL gene region can affect the response of apoC-III levels to combined statin and FA therapy.",

However, their efficacies are rarely compared. This study aimed to compare efficacy ofa biguanide and a statin in treating PCOS. In a randomized double-blind clinical trial, 400 women with PCOS were recruited within 15 months in Taleghani Hospital. They randomly received either a biguanide (metformin 500 mg three times daily) or a statin (simvastatin 20 mg daily) for three consecutive months. Changes of clinical and laboratory variables were compared. In the biguanide group the serum glucose status (abnormal fasting and non-fasting sugar and insulin levels and percentage of hyperinsulinemic cases) and menstrual abnormalities improved significantly after treatment (p < 0.05). In the statin group the lipid profile status (abnormal total cholesterol, high and low density lipoproteins), C-Reactive Protein (CRP), serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, hyperinsulinemia, severity of acne and menstrual abnormalities improved significantly after treatment (p < 0.05). Comparing the two groups, the improvements in fasting blood sugar and serum insulin levels were significantly better in the biguanide group (p = 0.04 for both parameters); whereas the improvements in serum total cholesterol (p < 0.001), low density lipoprotein (p < 0.001), CRP (p < 0.001) and acne status (p = 0.04) were significantly superior in the statin receivers. Based on these results, each medication is only effective on some aspects of the disease. Overall, the simvastatin was superior to metformin with regard to the number of beneficial effects.", 
    "147": "Inflammation and oxidative stress play an important role in cerebral ischemic pathogenesis. It has been well established that atorvastatin and probucol could elicit a variety of biological effects through its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties respectively. This study was to examine whether probucol and atorvastatin in combination had the enhanced protective effect against cerebral ischemia. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Experiment 1 was used to evaluate the time course expression of Peroxiredoxin2 (Prx2) and Foxo3a after cerebral ischemia. Experiment 2 was used to detect neuroprotective effect of atorvastatin and probucol in cerebral ischemia. At 24h or 72h, neurologic deficit, brain water content and infarct size were measured. Immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, Western blot and confocal microscope were used to analyze the expressions of Prx2, Foxo3a and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Compared with the normal-control group, the expressions of Prx2 and Foxo3a were down-regulated in ischemic brain. Compared with the use of probucol or atorvastatin alone, the combined treatment dramatically reduced the brain water content and the infarct volume (P<0.05). Meanwhile, the decrease of Prx2, Foxo3a and Nrf2 was significantly alleviated in combined treatment group. Probucol combined with atorvastatin can get the augmented neuroprotection from the damage caused by MCAO, this effect may be through up-regulation of Prx2, Foxo3a and Nrf2.",

The effects on experimental CM were assessed through the evaluation of brain histopathological changes and neuronal apoptosis by TUNEL staining.", 
    "150": "AVA alone in the therapeutic scheme show no effect on survival, but the prophylactic scheme employing AVA associated with MQ, rather than MQ alone, led to a significant delay in mouse death and had an effect on the onset of CM symptoms and on the level of parasitaemia. Histopathological findings show a correlation between brain lesions and CM onset. A neuronal anti-apoptotic effect of AVA in the AVA + MQ combination was not shown.",

HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have pleiotropic mechanisms of action in the setting of acute brain injury, and have been demonstrated to improve outcomes in preclinical models of ICH and TBI. To facilitate translation to clinical practice, we now characterize the optimal statin and dosing paradigm in murine models of ICH and TBI. In a preclinical model of TBI, mice received vehicle, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin at doses of 1\u2009mg/kg and 5\u2009mg/kg for 5 days after the impact. Immunohistochemistry, differential gene expression, and functional outcomes (rotarod and Morris water maze testing) were assessed to gauge treatment response. Following TBI, administration of rosuvastatin 1\u2009mg/kg was associated with the greatest improvement in functional outcomes. Rosuvastatin treatment was associated with histological evidence of reduced neuronal degeneration at 24\u2009h post-TBI, reduced microgliosis at day 7 post-TBI, and preserved neuronal density in the CA3 region at 35 days post-injury. Administration of rosuvastatin following TBI was also associated with downregulation of inflammatory gene expression in the brain. Following ICH, treatment with simvastatin 1\u2009mg/kg was associated with the greatest improvement in functional outcomes, an effect that was independent of hemorrhage volume. Clinically relevant models of acute brain injury may be used to define variables such as optimal statin and dosing paradigms to facilitate the rational design of pilot clinical trials.", 
    "153": "Brain angiotensin (Ang) II and vasopressin play important roles in the neurogenic regulation of the circulatory system, such as in cardiovascular responses to stress. Recently, it has become evident that the positive effects of statins are not limited to their lipid-lowering actions; for example, it has been found that statins interact with angiotensin peptides. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that simvastatin affects haemodynamic responses to air-jet stress and intracerebroventricular infusions of vasopressin and AngII. We maintained 12-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats either on tap water (control) or on water containing simvastatin (20, 40 or 60\u00a0mg/L) for 4\u00a0weeks. Subsequently, we measured arterial blood pressure and heart rate (HR) at baseline and after air-jet stress or intracerebroventricular infusions over 30\u00a0s of 10\u00a0ng AngII, 20\u00a0ng vasopressin or their antagonists (10\u00a0\u03bcg losartan and 400\u00a0ng d(CH(2) )(5) [Tyr(Me)(2) ,Ala-NH(2) (9) ] vasopressin, respectively). There were no significant differences between the control and simvastatin groups in terms of baseline mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and HR. In rats given 60\u00a0mg/L simvastatin, the hypertensive response to air-jet stress was significantly smaller than in controls, as was the increase in MAP in response to AngII. In contrast, there was no significant difference between the groups in terms of the hypertensive response to vasopressin. These findings show that simvastatin affects the hypertensive response to air-jet stress and provide evidence that statins may affect the brain's regulation of the circulatory system.",

All patients with an ischemic stroke should be admitted to the hospital in the subacute period for cardiac and neurologic monitoring. Imaging studies, including magnetic resonance angiography, carotid artery ultrasonography, and/or echocardiography, may be indicated to determine the cause of the stroke. Evaluation for aspiration risk, including a swallowing assessment, should be performed, and nutritional, physical, occupational, and speech therapy should be initiated. Significant causes of morbidity and mortality following ischemic stroke include venous thromboembolism, pressure sores, infection, and delirium, and measures should be taken to prevent these complications. For secondary prevention of future strokes, antiplatelet therapy with aspirin should be initiated within 24 hours of ischemic stroke in all patients without contraindications, and one of several antiplatelet regimens should be continued long-term. Statin therapy should also be given in most situations. Although permissive hypertension is initially warranted, antihypertensive therapy should begin within 24 hours. Diabetes mellitus should be controlled and patients counseled about lifestyle modifications to reduce stroke risk.

Atorvastatin represents a first-line treatment option, alongside other hydroxyl methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors. Repaglinide is a short-acting, oral, insulin secretagogue that is used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Both the category of drugs undergo extensive metabolism with cytochrome enzyme system. This may lead to drug-drug interaction problems with altered repaglinide activity which is cautious. Repaglinide/atorvastatin/atorvastatin + repaglinide were administered orally to normal, diabetic rats, and to normal rabbits. Blood samples were collected at different time intervals and were analyzed for blood glucose by GOD-POD method using commercial glucose kits and repaglinide estimation in plasma by HPLC method. Diabetes was induced by alloxan 100 mg/kg body weight administered by I.P route. In the presence of atorvastatin, repaglinide activity was increased and maintained for longer period in diabetic rats compared with repaglinide matching control. The present study concludes co-administration of atorvastatin was found to improve repaglinide responses significantly in diabetic rats and improved glucose metabolism of atorvastatin played an important role and increased repaglinide levels by competitive CYP 3A4 enzyme inhibition by atorvastatin could be added advantage for anti hyperglycemic activity.",

Previous reports have also demonstrated bovine pericardium to be associated with similar rates of postoperative complications and restenosis compared with other patch materials. Due to favorable handling and sonographic properties, bovine pericardium has become increasingly popular as a patch option in recent years. However, the intermediate- and long-term performance of this material remains incompletely defined. Through a retrospective analysis of our carotid endarterectomy experience, we sought to compare the bleeding, infection, and pseudoaneurysm rates with bovine pericardium patch closure to those with Dacron patch and primary closure. In this study, 1331 primary carotid endarterectomies performed in our institution between 1996 and 2008 were grouped according to the method of arteriotomy closure: primary closure (PC) (216, 16.3%), Dacron patch angioplasty (DPA) (642, 48.2%), and bovine pericardial patch angioplasty (BPA) (457, 34.3%).

The structure of dehydromonacolin N (1) was further confirmed by its semisynthesis from monacolin K (lovastatin) (11). Dehydromonacolin J (2), an intermediate in the semisynthesis of 1, was obtained as a new dehydromonacolin. The structure of dehydromonacolin L (3) was also confirmed by an elimination reaction of monacolin L (12). Compound 1, possessing a C2 side chain, is unprecedented in the natural monacolin family and exhibited moderate cytotoxic activity against Hep G2, Caco-2, and MCF-7 cancer cell lines. Dehydromonacolin K (8) demonstrated the most potent cytotoxicity to all three of these cell lines. The structure-activity relationship of natural and synthesized monacolins was discussed.

Though observational studies and RCTs often provide comparable estimates, the questioning of observational analyses has recently intensified because of randomized-observational discrepancies regarding the effect of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy on coronary heart disease. Reanalyses of observational data that excluded prevalent users of hormone replacement therapy led to attenuated discrepancies, which begs the question of whether exclusion of prevalent users should be generally recommended. In the current study, the authors evaluated the effect of excluding prevalent users of statins in a meta-analysis of observational studies of persons with cardiovascular disease. The pooled, multivariate-adjusted mortality hazard ratio for statin use was 0.77 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.65, 0.91) in 4 studies that compared incident users with nonusers, 0.70 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.78) in 13 studies that compared a combination of prevalent and incident users with nonusers, and 0.54 (95% CI: 0.45, 0.66) in 13 studies that compared prevalent users with nonusers. The corresponding hazard ratio from 18 RCTs was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.77, 0.91).

The ATP-gated P2X(4) receptor is a pro-inflammatory mediator. Here, we investigate the action of fluvastatin and other cholesterol depleting agents on native and recombinant human P2X(4) receptor. Fluvastatin and m\u03b2CD suppressed P2X(4)-dependent calcium influx in THP-1 monocytes, without affecting P2Y receptor responses. m\u03b2CD or filipin III suppressed the current density of recombinant human P2X(4) receptors. Human P2X(2) was insensitive to cholesterol depletion. Cholesterol depletion had no effect on intrinsic P2X(4) receptor properties as judged by ATP concentration-response relationship, receptor rundown or current decay during agonist occupancy. These data suggest fluvastatin suppresses P2X(4) activity in monocytes through cholesterol depletion and not by modulating intrinsic channel properties.",

The scope of the study included a wide variety of pharmaceuticals belonging to different therapeutical classes. For this purpose, 112 samples, including influent and effluent wastewater, from different conventional wastewater treatment plants were collected. Two monitoring programmes were carried out along several seasons. The first was in June 2008 and January 2009, and the second in April and October 2009. During the first monitoring, the occurrence of 20 analytes in 84 urban wastewater samples (influent and effluent) was studied. The selection of these pharmaceuticals was mainly based on consumption. From these, 17 compounds were detected in the samples, with analgesics and anti-inflammatories, cholesterol lowering statin drugs and lipid regulators being the most frequently detected groups. 4-Aminoantipyrine, bezafibrate, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, ketoprofen, naproxen and venlafaxine were the compounds most frequently found. In the highlight of these results, the number of analytes was increased up to around 50. A lot of antibiotic compounds were added to the target list as they were considered \"priority pharmaceuticals\" due to their more potential hazardous effects in the aquatic environment. Data obtained during the second monitoring programme (spring and autumn) corroborated the results from the first one (summer and winter). Analgesics and anti-inflammatories, lipid regulators together with quinolone and macrolide antibiotics were the most abundant pharmaceuticals. Similar median concentrations were found over the year and seasonal variation was not clearly observed.

Oxidized LDL damages the artery wall, and a diet rich in vitamins and low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce this risk. Not only hypercholesterolemia but also low levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol are critical risk factors for atherosclerosis and related diseases. It has been reported that high doses of B complex vitamin may be useful in lowering blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the body, however the use of this compound has been limited by an annoying flush and concern for toxicity. Niacin is a B-complex vitamin with anti-atherosclerotic properties and is an effective medication for raising high density lipoprotein. The combination of niacin with other lipid-lowering drugs, such as statins, reduces the dynamic of atherosclerosis disease. In addition, vitamin E is one of the most important lipid soluble anti-oxidants in humans, and reduces atherosclerosis plaque, coronary artery diseases and myocardial infarction. Vitamin E protects the integrity of membranes by inhibiting lipid peroxidation. In this study we revisited the interrelationship between cholesterol, low density lipoproteins and vitamins.", 
    "220": "Observational epidemiologic data indicate that lower blood glucose levels, blood pressure (BP), and lipid parameters are associated with a lower incidence of micro- and macrovascular complications in people with diabetes. While no threshold for this effect is discernible in these observational studies, intervention studies do not mirror this finding. The earliest glycemia target study in type 2 diabetes mellitus, UKPDS, demonstrated unequivocal benefits of tight glucose control on microvascular complications, but needed a prolonged follow-up to demonstrate a benefit on macrovascular outcomes and mortality. Recently, three major studies, ACCORD, ADVANCE, and VADT, evaluated the impact of attaining euglycemia (ACCORD) or near-euglycemia (ADVANCE, VADT) in older patients with diabetes and high cardiovascular (CV) risk. None of these studies, either individually or on pooled analysis, demonstrated any reduction in all-cause or CV mortality, although the meta-analyses revealed 15-17% reductions in the incidence of non-fatal myocardial infarction in those exposed to tight glucose control. A higher mortality was observed in the intensive glucose control arm of ACCORD, resulting in the premature termination of the glucose-lowering component of this study. Also, the occurrence of hypoglycemic episodes (total and major) was significantly higher in the intensive glucose control arm. ADVANCE and ACCORD also had BP-lowering components. While data from ADVANCE demonstrated a benefit of routine use of a combination of perindopril and indapamide, with a decline in all-cause mortality, CV mortality, and new-onset microalbuminuria, reducing systolic BP to <120\u2009mmHg in ACCORD did not result in any incremental benefits over a systolic BP<140\u2009mmHg. A residual CV risk observed in people with diabetes even after low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowering has led to trials evaluating additional therapy with fibric acid derivatives to reduce triglyceride levels. The lipid-lowering arm of ACCORD failed to demonstrate any benefit of add-on therapy with fibric acid derivatives to LDL-lowering treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) on vascular outcomes in patients with diabetes. However, data from earlier studies, and also from the subgroup analysis of ACCORD, indicate a probable benefit of adding treatment with fibric acid derivatives to individuals with persistently elevated triglyceride levels despite statin therapy. The most compelling evidence comes from studies assessing the impact of multiple risk factors - glucose, BP, and cholesterol. Studies like the Steno study unequivocally demonstrate the benefit of aggressive control of all three parameters on vascular outcomes in patients with diabetes. In conclusion, attempts to achieve euglycemia in older patients with type 2 diabetes with co-morbidities are not associated with any survival benefit, but may reduce the occurrence of non-fatal CV events. There is a significant risk of major hypoglycemia with this approach, thereby probably limiting its utility to younger patients with new-onset disease. Similarly, lowering systolic BP below 120\u2009mmHg in high CV risk people with diabetes is associated with significant excess adverse events, limiting the utility of such an intervention. However, a clear benefit, which is also cost effective, is observed with strategies for multiple risk-factor control, which should be universally adopted in clinical practice.",

We used this measure of genetic effect modification to predict the expected difference in clinical benefit among KIF6 719Arg allele carriers and non-carriers in response to therapies that reduce LDL cholesterol.

Meta-regression analysis involving 88,535 participants, however, showed that the 719Arg allele appears to influence the effect of LDL cholesterol on the risk of CVD. KIF6 carriers experienced a 13% greater reduction in the risk of CVD per mmol/L decrease in LDL cholesterol than non-carriers. We interpreted this difference as the expected difference in clinical benefit among KIF6 carriers and non-carriers in response to therapies that lower LDL cholesterol.

    "225": "3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) inhibitors, commonly known as statins, may possess cancer preventive and therapeutic properties. Statins are effective suppressors of cholesterol synthesis with a well-established risk-benefit ratio in cardiovascular disease prevention. Mechanistically, targeting HMGCR activity primarily influences cholesterol biosynthesis and prenylation of signaling proteins. Pravastatin is a hydrophilic statin that is selectively taken up by a sodium-independent organic anion transporter protein-1B1 (OATP1B1) exclusively expressed in liver. Simvastatin is a hydrophobic statin that enters cells by other mechanisms. Poorly-differentiated and well-differentiated cancer cell lines were selected from various tissues and examined for their response to these two statins. Simvastatin inhibited the growth of most tumor cell lines more effectively than pravastatin in a dose dependent manner. Poorly-differentiated cancer cells were generally more responsive to simvastatin than well-differentiated cancer cells, and the levels of HMGCR expression did not consistently correlate with response to statin treatment. Pravastatin had a significant effect on normal hepatocytes due to facilitated uptake and a lesser effect on prostate PC3 and colon Caco-2 cancer cells since the OATP1B1 mRNA and protein were only found in the normal liver and hepatocytes. The inhibition of cell growth was accompanied by distinct alterations in mitochondrial networks and dramatic changes in cellular morphology related to cofilin regulation and loss of p-caveolin. Both statins, hydrophilic pravastatin and hypdrophobic simvastatin caused redistribution of OATP1B1 and HMGCR to perinuclear sites. In conclusion, the specific chemical properties of different classes of statins dictate mechanistic properties which may be relevant when evaluating biological responses to statins.",

    "230": "Hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis. It also is associated with platelet hyperactivity, which increases morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. However, the mechanisms by which hypercholesterolemia produces a procoagulant state remain undefined. Atherosclerosis is associated with accumulation of oxidized lipoproteins within atherosclerotic lesions. Small quantities of oxidized lipoproteins are also present in the circulation of patients with coronary artery disease. We therefore hypothesized that hypercholesterolemia leads to elevated levels of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) in plasma and that this induces expression of the procoagulant protein tissue factor (TF) in monocytes. In support of this hypothesis, we report here that oxLDL induced TF expression in human monocytic cells and monocytes. In addition, patients with familial hypercholesterolemia had elevated levels of plasma microparticle (MP) TF activity. Furthermore, a high-fat diet induced a time-dependent increase in plasma MP TF activity and activation of coagulation in both LDL receptor-deficient mice and African green monkeys. Genetic deficiency of TF in bone marrow cells reduced coagulation in hypercholesterolemic mice, consistent with a major role for monocyte-derived TF in the activation of coagulation. Similarly, a deficiency of either TLR4 or TLR6 reduced levels of MP TF activity. Simvastatin treatment of hypercholesterolemic mice and monkeys reduced oxLDL, monocyte TF expression, MP TF activity, activation of coagulation, and inflammation, without affecting total cholesterol levels. Our results suggest that the prothrombotic state associated with hypercholesterolemia is caused by oxLDL-mediated induction of TF expression in monocytes via engagement of a TLR4/TLR6 complex.", 
    "231": "Thrombotic complications represent a highly significant component of morbidity and mortality associated with hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. In this issue of the JCI, Owens et al. report possible mechanisms underlying the prothrombotic, proinflammatory state accompanying hypercholesterolemia. Using rodent, monkey, and human subjects, they show that circulating oxidized LDL and circulating monocyte-derived tissue factor are important instigating factors driving the thrombotic, inflammatory phenotype and, surprisingly, that statin therapy ameliorated the phenotype even in the absence of lowering cholesterol levels. The studies raise the intriguing possibility that therapies directed at pathways generating oxidant stress or pathways involved in transmitting oxidized LDL-mediated signals in circulating platelets and monocytes could have antiatherothrombotic potential, probably with minimal anticoagulant and hemorrhagic potential.", 
    "232": "Despite decades of research and thousands of experimental publications, acute preconditioning strategies have yet to be implemented in clinical practice. While some have attributed this to a failure of the experimental studies to mimic the clinical environment, others have suggested that acute preconditioning strategies themselves may possess physiological limitations. In particular, there is evidence to suggest a reduced efficacy of acute preconditioning in the aged heart and in disease states, such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atherosclerosis. In addition, pharmacologic agent commonly used in clinical practice, such as sulfonylureas and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents may interfere with acute preconditioning signaling pathways. Such considerations may preclude the translation of acute preconditioning strategies to the clinical setting. This has led some to shift attention to alternate strategies of cardioprotection, one such strategy being the possibility of generating a prolonged state of cardioprotection. Although preliminary, studies to date have suggested that sustained preconditioning strategies may not be associated with the same drawbacks as acute preconditioning. Further, cardioprotective signaling pathways that elicit the sustained preconditioning response may be distinct from acute signaling pathways, which permit pharmacologic targeting of these pathways in the future. Additionally, sustained preconditioning strategies may be clinically applicable in the setting of acute myocardial infarction, a setting where acute preconditioning strategies are inherently limited. This review will briefly discuss the current data regarding sustained preconditioning strategies, including those in humans, and discuss the goal of future studies in this setting.", 
    "233": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an independent risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Often, CKD and CVD coexist, and patients warrant optimal pharmacotherapy to reduce the risk of future cardiovascular (CV) events. Randomized trials have evaluated the role of antihypertensive therapy and lipid-lowering therapy as means to reduce CVD in patients with CKD. Many clinical trials support the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in the CKD population. In addition, many clinical trials have evaluated the role of statin therapy in reducing CV events in early- and late-stage CKD. The struggle with interpreting results from these trials is that there are a number of different CV composite end points and a lack of consistency in defining CKD, especially in some post hoc subanalyses. Overall, ACEI/ARB therapy is supported by the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) and the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF KDOQI) hypertension guidelines and statin therapy is supported by the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III and NKF KDOQI dyslipidemia guidelines to optimally manage patients with CKD and CV risk factors. Questions remain as to the optimal role of statin therapy in patients with CKD receiving dialysis. JNC 8 and ATP IV guidelines will be available in the next year, and it is expected that there will be specific recommendations on both hypertension and dyslipidemia management in the CKD population.", 
    "234": "The development of the statin class of cholesterol-lowering drugs is one of the most significant success stories of modern pharmacotherapy. World-wide there are an estimated 150 million people on statins, with the emerging economies of India and China predicted to contribute significantly to that number. Notwithstanding their success, a significant number of people cannot tolerate statins because of serious side effects; of equal concern, a substantial proportion of high risk patients fail to reach cholesterol-lowering targets. For these subjects there is an urgent need for new cholesterol-lowering agents to be used alone or in combination with statins. The success of statins has been largely underpinned by knowledge of cholesterol homeostasis at a molecular level, knowledge that was first gleaned in the 1980s from Brown and Goldstein's pioneering studies of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH, OMIM 143890). Follow-up work that has identified a number of intracellular and circulating factors, all capable of disrupting LDL clearance, has revealed that the low-density lipoprotein receptor- (LDLR) mediated clearance pathway is substantially more complex than previously thought. These factors were discovered in studies of individuals with very rare inherited conditions that lead to either hypo- or hypercholesterolemia. These investigations, besides providing clearer insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating plasma LDL concentrations, have also revealed a number of novel therapeutic targets independent from statins. Consequently, a number of novel therapeutic approaches that are based on small interfering bio-molecules, including antisense oligonucleotides, are now in clinical development. These are aimed at impairing the assembly, synthesis and secretion of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins and/or accelerating their hepatic catabolism. The aim of this article is to focus on these recent advances in the understanding of the molecular basis of cholesterol metabolism that should herald novel cholesterol-lowering agents beyond the statins.", 
    "235": "Combination fibrate-statin therapy favorably modifies the atherogenic, triglyceride-rich lipoprotein environment, common to insulin resistance, diabetes, and higher cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Five major fibrate randomized clinical trial (RCT) results (HHS, VA-HIT, BIP, FIELD, and ACCORD-Lipid) demonstrated four consistent features: 1) the highest CVD event rates occurred in the placebo subgroups possessing atherogenic \"moderate\" dyslipidemia (triglycerides, >\u2009200\u00a0mg/dL, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], <\u200935-40\u00a0mg/dL); 2) with this subgroup having the greatest \"hypothesis-generating\" fibrate benefit (27% to 65% relative risk reduction, variable significance [P values ranging 0.057-0.005]); 3) those subgroups without moderate dyslipidemia had relatively lower CVD event rates; and 4) little or no benefit from fibrates. The ACCORD-Lipid results, specifically, demonstrated benefits against the background of statin therapy. Three independent meta-analyses combining the five RCTs, which provided a large sample of moderate dyslipidemia participants (i.e., 2401 on fibrates; 2270 on placebo), demonstrated a fibrate benefit with significant heterogeneity of effect across lipid subgroups (P\u2009=\u20090.0002). The fibrate benefit was observed in \"low HDL-C only\" patients, reducing CVD events by 17% (P\u2009<\u20090.001) or \"hypertriglyceridemia-only\" patients, reducing CVD events by 28% (P\u2009<\u20090.001), or \"atherogenic (moderate) dyslipidemia\" phenotype, reducing CVD events by 30% (P\u2009<\u20090.0001), compared with a nonsignificant 6% reduction (P\u2009=\u20090.13) in nonatherogenic dyslipidemia patients. Fibrate RCTs in patients with diabetes (FIELD and ACCORD-Lipid) also demonstrated significant microvascular (ie, retinopathy and nephropathy) outcome benefit possibly independent of lipid levels.", 
    "236": "A 34-year-old patient demonstrating pyramidal and cerebellar signs, accompanied by epilepsy, peripheral neuropathy, mental retardation and bilateral cataract was diagnosed with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis based on the clinical picture, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and serum sterol analysis. Tendon xanthomas were not observed in this case. After establishing the diagnosis, treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid and statin was introduced. During the next two years of the follow-up, serum cholestanol and 7\u03b1-hydroxycholesterol levels decreased in response to the therapy, but this was not reflected in the patient's neurological condition, which was slowly progressing. Treatment effectiveness in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is variable, notably better in patients who had started therapy before the injury to the nervous system took place. The present case report points to cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis as a rare cause of spinocerebellar syndrome, which might be treatable if diagnosed in early life.",
