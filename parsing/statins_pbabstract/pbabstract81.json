    "0": "Statins are thought to potentially impair glucose metabolism, increasing plasma glucose concentration. The effect of prolonged statin use on glucose metabolism among outpatients is thus well established. However, the impact of statin use on glucose concentrations and insulin requirements during surgery remains poorly characterised and may very well differ considering the substantial hyperglycaemic stress response to surgery. We conducted a study to test the hypothesis that patients taking statins preoperatively require more intraoperative insulin than non-users. We analysed 173 adults having major non-cardiac surgery who participated in the Dexamethasone, Light Anaesthesia and Tight Glucose Control Trial between 2007 and 2010. We compared statin and non-statin users on total amount of intraoperative insulin to maintain plasma glucose concentration within 4.4 to 6.1 mmol/l using the inverse propensity score weighting method. Sixty-seven patients were statin users and 106 were non-statin users. The estimated ratio of geometric means between the statin users and the non-users was 1.45 (95% confidence interval: 0.93, 2.26, statin versus non-statin, P=0.11). The total amount of intraoperative insulin usage did not differ significantly among patients taking different types of statins (P=0.50). While the total amount of intraoperative insulin used was not statistically different between the statin users and non-users, we observed a potentially important trend toward insulin resistance intraoperatively among statin users during major non-cardiac surgery. This result is consistent with non-operative settings and cardiac surgery. Further investigation is essential to determine whether this effect is real and, if so, determine which specific statins are more associated with insulin resistance.", 
    "1": "A recent study has shown an association between high-potency statins and risk of acute kidney injury. However, these data are from observational studies, and it is not clear if similar signal is seen from randomized controlled trials. We evaluated the risk of renal-associated serious adverse events (SAEs) using statins versus placebo trials and the high-dose versus low-dose statin trials that were available to us. The outcome of interest was renal-related SAEs. The incidence of adverse events relating to kidney injury was determined through review of the adverse event database. The following outcomes were evaluated: (1) renal-related SAEs within 120 days of randomization (primary outcome), (2) renal-related SAEs after 120 days of randomization (secondary), and (3) drug discontinuation due to renal-related SAEs (secondary). There was no difference in the incidence of renal-related SAEs at 120 days (0.04% vs 0.10%, p = 0.162) between atorvastatin and placebo in the 24 placebo-controlled trials (10,345 patients on atorvastatin (10 to 80 mg/day) versus 8,945 patients on placebo) or in the high-dose versus low-dose statin trials including the Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering (IDEAL) study (0.05% vs 0.02%, p = 0.625) or the Treating to New Targets (TNT) trial (0.0% vs 0.04%, p = 0.500) trial. Results were similar for renal-related SAEs after 120 days (placebo controlled trials [0.38% vs 0.36%, p = 0.905], IDEAL trial [0.56% vs 0.65%, p = 0.683], or the TNT trial [0.76% vs 1.04%, p = 0.168]) and for drug withdrawal due to renal-related SAE (placebo controlled trials [0.05% vs 0.04%, p = 1.00], IDEAL trial [0.02% vs 0.0%, p = 0.499], or the TNT trial [0.08% vs 0.12%, p = 0.754]). In conclusion, the results from clinical trials with data from 149,882 patient-years of follow-up fail to show any increase in renal-related SAEs with statins compared with controls.",

For specific guidance on adverse events related to muscle, liver, cognition, and glucose metabolism, one should refer to the other reports of the Statin Safety Task Force for those topics. Although statin adverse effects rarely lead to permanent sequelae, symptomatic intolerance frequently hinders cardiovascular risk reduction by statins.

    "9": "In the 2006 Report of the National Lipid Association's Statin Safety Task Force, a panel of experts in hepatology published their findings on specific questions related to the liver blood testing during statin therapy. Among their recommendations was that regulatory agencies reconsider the statin-labeling recommendation at that time, which required post-statin liver enzyme testing. Since then, the Food and Drug Administration altered statin labeling such that unless clinically indicated for other reasons, after a pre-statin therapy baseline evaluation, follow-up liver enzyme testing was not uniformly required after statin initiation. This 2014 report provides an update on interim issues relevant to statins and liver safety. Some of the points discussed include the value of baseline liver enzymes before initiating statin therapy, safety of statin use in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, potential drug interactions between statins and drugs used to treat hepatitis, the use of statins in liver transplant recipients, and the use of statins in patients with autoimmune liver disease. Finally, this panel provides diagnostic and algorithmic approaches when evaluating statin-treated patients who experience elevations in liver enzymes.", 
    "10": "The statins are widely used worldwide to reduce risk for cardiovascular events in both the primary and secondary prevention settings. Although generally quite safe, the statins can be associated with a variety of serious side adverse effects, including myalgia, myopathy, and changes in plasma enzymes of hepatic origin. Although rare, the most serious of these is rhabdomyolysis. Several drugs can interfere with the metabolism and disposal of the statins, thereby increasing risk for adverse events. It is important that clinicians treating patients with statins be aware of the potential for drug-drug interactions between each statin and specific other drugs and take measures to prevent them. The prediction of potential drug-drug interactions derives from basic pharmacokinetic principles. Certain drug interactions are predicted by measuring the effect of interacting drugs on blood plasma concentrations of the statin. Individual patient variations resulting in part from polymorphisms in the metabolizing enzymes confound some of these predictions. Based on these known effects, a new classification for predicting statin drug interactions is proposed. This report discusses likely prescription and nonprescription interactions as well as potential alternatives for special populations.",

Thus, statins are the pharmacologic therapy of choice for the management of high blood cholesterol levels. Prompted by examination of clinical trial data suggesting a modest, but statistically significant, increase in the incidence of new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus with statin use, the US Food and Drug Administration in 2012 added a statement to the labels of statin medications indicating that increases in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) and fasting glucose levels have been reported with statin use. This labeling change has raised questions among clinicians regarding the relative benefits and risks of statin use, both among patients with diabetes mellitus and among those with diabetes risk factors. This 2014 report from the Diabetes Subpanel of the National Lipid Association Expert Panel on Statin Safety reviews the published evidence relating statin use to the hazard for diabetes mellitus or worsening glycemia, examines potential mechanisms that may mediate the relationship between statin use and diabetes mellitus risk, and suggests future research efforts. Given the well-established benefits of statin therapy in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events among those with indications for treatment, no changes to clinical practice are recommended other than the measurement of HbA1C or fasting glucose in those deemed to also be at elevated diabetes risk after initiating statin therapy, and potentially before initiation in selected patients considered to be at elevated risk of developing diabetes.

    "24": "The term statin intolerance refers to an inability to use statins because of muscle symptoms or elevated creatine kinase, and the major diagnostic challenge is to unambiguously link these to statin use. Roughly 5% to 10% of statin users develop statin intolerance, and because statin use is expected to increase--especially after recent updated guidelines have expanded the statin benefit groups--adverse effects from statins will become a growing issue. Unfortunately, the pathophysiology--and even the terminology--of statin-related muscle injury lacks clarity. Several risk factors have been identified, including advanced age, family history of myopathy and statin dose; many cases manifest only after patients are administered an interacting medication (e.g., azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin, erythromycin and cyclosporine). The diagnosis of myopathy remains challenging, especially because some patients can have normal serum creatine kinase levels despite demonstrable weakness and muscle biopsy-proven statin-induced myopathy. A statin withdrawal and rechallenge helps patients distinguish whether their myalgia symptoms are because of statins, but, in at least 1 clinical trial, even 5% of placebo-treated patients developed myalgias during a controlled withdrawal and rechallenge. No consensus exists for management of patients with statin intolerance. Many patients can eventually tolerate a statin but often at suboptimal doses. A subset of patients do well with nondaily regimens such as every other day or once weekly dosing. Some patients cannot tolerate statins at all, requiring nonstatin lipid-lowering medications--the benefit of which remains unclear with regard to preventing atherosclerotic events. Ultimately, statin intolerance undermines the drug adherence that is critical for achieving the benefits of lifelong lipid-lowering therapy. In conclusion, statin myopathy is a common challenge in lipid management, and further work is needed to establish a standard diagnostic criterion as well as treatment algorithms.", 
    "25": "Patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) still experience high rates of recurrent coronary events, particularly, early in their presentation. Statins yield substantial cardiovascular benefits, but the optimal timing of their administration, before or after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), remains unclear. We aimed to perform a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of statin administration before or after PCI versus no statin or low-dose statin in patients with ACS. Primary end points were 30-day all-cause mortality and 30-day myocardial infarction (MI) stratified by pre- and post-PCI statin administration. Secondary end points were major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) or major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs). Long-term analysis beyond 30 days was also performed. Twenty randomized controlled trials enrolling 8,750 patients were included. At 30 days, the rate of MI was significantly lower in the statin group (odds ratio [OR] 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53 to 0.84, p = 0.0007) with a trend toward reduced mortality (p = 0.06) and significant reductions in MACE and MACCE compared with no or low-dose statin. The 30-day incidence of MI was markedly lower when statins were administered before PCI (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.59, p <0.0001) rather than after PCI (p = 0.28). The direction and magnitude of the estimates for before and after PCI versus no statin or low-dose statin were sustained at long term, not reaching statistical significance for MI (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.01, p = 0.06) but with significant reductions in MACE (p = 0.0002). By meta-regression, earlier statin administration correlated significantly with lower risk of MI, MACE, and MACCE at 30 days. In conclusion, the present meta-analysis indicates a time-related impact of statin therapy on clinical outcomes of patients with ACS undergoing PCI: the earlier the administration before PCI, the greater the benefits.", 
    "26": "Starting from previous studies showing that patients with cognitive deficit present neutral lipids (NLs) accumulation in cytoplasm of their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and considering that there is epidemiological evidence linking age-related macular degeneration (AMD) to cognitive deficit, the first purpose of this study was to test whether neutral lipids also accumulated in PBMCs from AMD subjects. Moreover, the impact of statin use on AMD was explored and whether such use in AMD subjects was associated with NLs accumulation in PBMCs. The study was conducted on 222 subjects: 136 AMD (36 of which - 26.5% - using statins], 48 cognitive deficit (20 of which - 41.7% - using statins) and 38 healthy controls (4 of which\u00a0-10.1% - using statins), AMD lesions were assessed from color fundus photographs. Mini-mental state examination (MMSE), demographics, lifestyle factors and medical history were collected at interview. MMSE score was categorized as normal (24-30), and impaired (<24), NLs content was evaluated by oil red 0 (ORO) staining method. ORO determination showed that neutral lipids were generally absent or very low (score between 0 and 1) in healthy controls while most of PBMCs from cognitive deficit and AMD had ORO staining levels scoring 2-4. Post hoc analysis (Bonferroni) in a one-way ANOVA revealed that ORO score was significantly higher in cognitive deficit and AMD subjects compared to healthy controls and in cognitive deficit compared to AMD. Bonferroni-test also showed that AMD subjects had significantly lower total cholesterol (TC) levels compared to healthy controls while high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) did not reach statistical significance. The results also revealed a significant higher number of statin-users in AMD compared to healthy controls. Likewise when cognitive deficit vs healthy controls was analyzed, the number of statin users were found to be significant higher in cognitive deficit than in healthy controls. There were no significant differences in statin use between AMD and cognitive deficit. Compared to healthy controls, statin use in cognitive deficit and AMD groups was significantly associated with ORO scores of 2-4. This data supports the hypothesis that AMD and cognitive deficit share similar complex pathophysiology and risk factors including NLs accumulation in their PBMCs, although this does not necessarily imply that one disease causes the other. In addition, they provide further evidence that statin use may increase the risk of AMD.",

Here, 6245 participants with CKD (not on dialysis) were randomly assigned to simvastatin (20 mg) plus ezetimibe (10 mg) daily or matching placebo. The main prespecified renal outcome was ESRD (defined as the initiation of maintenance dialysis or kidney transplantation). During 4.8 years of follow-up, allocation to simvastatin plus ezetimibe resulted in an average LDL cholesterol difference (SEM) of 0.96 (0.02) mmol/L compared with placebo.

    "40": "Multiple clinical trials have shown that the 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors known as statins have anti-inflammatory effects. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) is synthesized as a non-active precursor. The 31-kDa pro-IL-1\u03b2 is processed into the 17-kDa active form by caspase-1-activating inflammasomes. Here, we report a novel signaling pathway induced by statins, which leads to processing of pro-IL-1\u03b2 into an intermediate 28-kDa form. This statin-induced IL-1\u03b2 processing is independent of caspase-1- activating inflammasomes. The 28-kDa form of IL-1\u03b2 cannot activate interleukin-1 receptor-1 (IL1R1) to signal inflammatory responses. Instead, it interferes with mature IL-1\u03b2 signaling through IL-1R1 and therefore may dampen inflammatory responses initiated by mature IL-1\u03b2. These results may provide new clues to explain the anti-inflammatory effects of statins.", 
    "41": "Rosuvastatin has been marketed for approximately a decade. In this review we critically discuss available evidence on the benefits and risks from its use. In clinical trials using rosuvastatin, 'lowest is best' was relevant for on-treatment low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Targeting levels <50\u00a0mg/dl was associated with the greatest decrease in vascular morbidity/mortality in the primary prevention setting. Also, such reduction can induce atherosclerosis regression without increasing the risk of adverse effects. Pooled data suggest that the safety profile of rosuvastatin is not different from that of other statins. It was estimated that rosuvastatin-associated absolute hazards of muscle-, liver- and renal-related adverse effects are lower than the corresponding vascular benefits in moderate vascular risk individuals. However, these data are subject to biases and need confirmation on a prospective basis. Significant liver enzyme elevations are rare. These often imply underlying non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is associated with increased vascular risk. Rosuvastatin can improve biochemical biomarkers and histological score of NAFLD. Whether this benefit is associated with vascular risk reduction should be assessed by prospective studies. Both chronic kidney disease and albuminuria independently predict vascular morbidity and mortality. Rosuvastatin improved the estimated glomerular filtration rate and decreased albuminuria in patients with moderately impaired kidney function. Also, vascular morbidity and mortality might be reduced in these patients. The same was not relevant in end-stage renal disease. Rosuvastatin-induced proteinuria appears to be of tubular origin, not relating to kidney injury. Rosuvastatin increases the risk of new-onset diabetes by dose-dependently impairing insulin sensitivity. Obese individuals with prediabetes appear to be predominantly affected. However, absolute vascular benefits of rosuvastatin may counterbalance this risk. Rosuvastatin is effective for the prevention and management of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Individualization of its use can maximize benefits and reduce the risk of adverse effects.",

Direct loading of a larger amount of protein generated a large burst, 65% of total loading, followed by sustained release of protein. Release of lysozyme from 1 wt % of PBAE particles embedded into CS was more controllable than when directly loaded, and for 10 wt % of protein-loaded PBAE particles, a higher burst was followed by sustained release, comparable to the results for the high direct loading. Compression testing determined that incorporation of directly loaded drug or drug-loaded PBAE particles weakened CS. In particular, PBAE particles had a significant effect on the strength of the composites, with a 25 and 80% decrease in strength for 1 and 10 wt % particle loadings, respectively. CS-based composites demonstrated the ability to sustainably release both macromolecules and small molecules, supporting the potential for these materials to release a range of therapeutic agents.", 
    "43": "Influenza A virus is one of the most important health risks that lead to significant respiratory infections. Continuous antigenic changes and lack of promising vaccines are the reasons for the unsuccessful treatment of influenza. Statins are pleiotropic drugs that have recently served as anti-influenza agents due to their anti-inflammatory activity. In this study, the effect of simvastatin on influenza A-infected cells was investigated. Based on the MTT cytotoxicity test, hemagglutination (HA) assay and qPCR it was found that simvastatin maintained cell viability and decreased the viral load significantly as compared to virus-inoculated cells. The expression of important pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-6 and interferon-\u03b3), which was quantified using ELISA showed that simvastatin decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines to an average of 2-fold. Furthermore, the modulation of actin filament polymerization was determined using rhodamine staining. Endocytosis and autophagy processes were examined by detecting Rab and RhoA GTPase protein prenylation and LC3 lipidation using western blotting. The results showed that inhibiting GTPase and LC3 membrane localization using simvastatin inhibits influenza replication. Findings of this study provide evidence that modulation of RhoA, Rabs and LC3 may be the underlying mechanisms for the inhibitory effects of simvastatin as an anti-influenza compound.",

The plasma levels of 7\u03b1-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, a marker of hepatic cholesterol 7\u03b1-hydroxylase activity, and total fecal bile acid levels increased, suggesting that the hypocholesterolemic effects would be dependent on the activation of cholesterol catabolism in the liver. Compound-T3 significantly increased the plasma levels of HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I. In this condition, the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe significantly decreased the plasma non-HDL cholesterol levels and increased the fecal cholesterol levels without affecting plasma HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Bile acid sequestrant cholestyramine tended to decrease plasma non-HDL cholesterol and increase fecal bile acid levels. The cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor torcetrapib significantly increased plasma HDL cholesterol levels without affecting plasma non-HDL cholesterol and fecal cholesterol levels.",

In this study, 165 Japanese patients with elevated LDL-C or low HDL-C levels were randomly assigned to receive placebo, evacetrapib monotherapy 30 mg, 100 mg, or 500 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg, or evacetrapib 100 mg in combination with atorvastatin 10 mg. After 12 weeks, evacetrapib monotherapy increased HDL-C levels by 74%, 115%, and 136% and decreased LDL-C levels by 15%, 23%, and 22% and CETP activity by 50%, 83%, and 95% (for the 30-mg, 100-mg, and 500-mg dose groups, respectively) versus placebo. In combination with atorvastatin 10 mg, evacetrapib 100 mg increased HDL-C levels by 103% and decreased LDL-C levels by 15% and CETP activity by 68% versus atorvastatin alone. After a 4- to 6-week washout, HDL-C, LDL-C, and CETP mass and activity returned to baseline levels in the evacetrapib-treated groups, and most patients had evacetrapib concentrations below the quantitation limit. Evacetrapib monotherapy or in combination with atorvastatin was not likely to be associated with any significant change in blood pressure and did not have any adverse effects on mineralocorticoid or glucocorticoid measures. Notably, plasma evacetrapib concentrations were mostly undetectable, and all pharmacodynamic biomarkers (HDL-C and LDL-C levels and CETP mass and activity) returned to baseline after a 4- to 6-week washout. In conclusion, evacetrapib as monotherapy or in combination with atorvastatin effectively decreased CETP activity and LDL-C levels and increased HDL-C levels after 12 weeks in Japanese patients with dyslipidemia.",

In order to solve problems (i) and (ii), we propose a new surrogacy measure, a proportion of the treatment effect captured by candidate surrogate endpoints (PCS), on the basis of the decomposition of the treatment effect into parts captured and non-captured by the candidate surrogate endpoints. In order to solve problem (iii), we propose an estimation method based on the half-range mode method with the bootstrap distribution of the estimated surrogacy measures.

However, it seems that it does reduce CVD morbidity in elderly individuals. Because of limited evidence regarding the benefit of such therapy, particularly in very old subjects (older than 80-85 years), the decision whether to treat or not treat an elderly individual with statins in primary prevention should be based on good clinical judgment and considering the individual subject's situation regarding comorbidities, polypharmacy, and possible adverse effects.",

    "98": "A population-based cohort including 458 women diagnosed with primary DCIS between 1986 and 2004 were followed until November 2011 to study long-term survival. Tumor tissue microarrays were constructed, and immunohistochemical analyses were performed to detect cytoplasmic protein expression of HMGCR. The association between DCIS HMGCR expression and invasive breast cancer recurrence-free survival (RFSinv) and overall survival (OS) was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curves, log rank test, and Cox proportional hazard analysis.", 
    "99": "HMGCR was strongly expressed in 24 % of the assessed DCIS samples, moderately expressed in 46 %, and weakly expressed in 23 %; no expression was detected in 7 % of the samples. During the follow-up time (median 13.8 years), 61 patients were diagnosed with an invasive breast cancer recurrence, and 80 patients died. A crude analysis showed no survival benefit from radiotherapy. However, patients with strong HMGCR expression showed an improved RFSinv (log rank, p = 0.03) and OS (log rank, p = 0.04) after radiotherapy. No statistically significant interaction was observed for HMGCR and radiotherapy (RFSinv p = 0.69 and OS p = 0.29).", 
    "100": "This study demonstrates HMGCR expression in DCIS and suggests HMGCR as a predictive marker of response to postoperative radiotherapy in DCIS, although the test for interaction was nonsignificant. Future DCIS studies addressing the potential of statin treatment targeting HMGCR are warranted.",

We aimed at evaluating the effects of lipid-modifying therapies on circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), endothelial microparticles (EMPs), and platelet microparticles (PMPs) in high cardiovascular risk subjects with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Sixty-three individuals with coronary heart disease (CHD) or CHD risk equivalent on stable statin therapy, with LDL-cholesterol <100 mg/dL and CRP \u2265 2.0 mg/L were selected. After a 4-week run-in period with atorvastatin 10 mg, those with persistent CRP \u2265 2.0 mg/L were randomized to another 4-week treatment period with atorvastatin 40 mg, ezetimibe 10 mg or atorvastatin 40 mg/ezetimibe 10 mg. EPC (CD34(+)/CD133(+)/KDR(+)), EMP (CD51(+)), and PMP (CD42(+)/CD31(+)) were quantified by flow cytometry. Atorvastatin 40 mg and atorvastatin 40 mg/ezetimibe 10 mg reduced LDL-cholesterol (P < 0.001, paired T test, vs. baseline). Combined therapy, but not ezetimibe reduced CRP. CD34(+)/KDR(+) EPC were reduced after ezetimibe alone (P = 0.011 vs. baseline, Wilcoxon test) or combined with atorvastatin (P = 0.016 vs. baseline, Wilcoxon test). In addition, ezetimibe increased CD51(+) EMP (P = 0.017 vs. baseline, Wilcoxon test). No correlations between these markers and LDL-cholesterol or CRP were observed. These results contribute to understand the link between inflammation and vascular homeostasis and highlight the broader benefit of statins decreasing inflammation and preventing microparticles release, an effect not observed with ezetimibe alone.",

    "106": "Statins, widely used for treatment of hypercholesterolemia, have been demonstrated to exert pleiotropic beneficial effects independently of their cholesterol-lowering action, such as anti-inflammatory activity. A gender disparity has been observed in their cholesterol lowering activity as well as in response to these \"off label\" effects. Monocytes play a central role in atherosclerotic disease and, more in general, in inflammatory responses, through their chemotactic function and cytokine production. On these bases, in the present work, we examined the effect of statins on homeostasis and migration properties of freshly isolated monocytes from male and female healthy donors. Two prototypic natural and synthetic statins with different polarity, that is, type 1 and type 2 statins, have been considered: simvastatin and atorvastatin. Freshly isolated monocytes from peripheral blood of male and female healthy donors were treated with these drugs in the absence or presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Results obtained indicated that the polar statin efficiently inhibited chemotaxis of monocytes more than the apolar statin and that this effect was more significantly induced in cells from females than in cells from males. Dissecting the mechanisms involved, we found that these results could mainly be due to differential effects on: (i) the release of key cytokines, for example, MCP-1 and TNF-\u03b1; (ii) the maintenance of the redox homeostasis; (iii) a target activity on microfilament network integrity and function. All in all these results could suggest a reappraisal of \"off-label\" effects of statins taking into account either their chemical structure, that is, molecular polarity, or the gender issue.", 
    "107": "Statins are the first-line therapy in LDL-Cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction and its clinical use has contributed to significant prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Yet, a significant proportion of patients remain at high risk. Recently, a number of new therapies have been developed to further lower LDL-C. These agents may provide clinical benefit on top of statin therapy in patients with high residual risk, severe hypercholesterolemia or as an alternative for patients who are intolerant to statins. We review four novel approaches based on the inhibition of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), apolipoprotein-B100 (apoB), Cholesteryl ester transport protein (CETP) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP). ApoB and MTP inhibitors (Mipomersen and Lomitapide) are indicated only for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia patients. The results of ongoing trials with CETP and PCSK9 inhibitors may warrant a wider employment in different categories of patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease.", 
    "108": "The objective of this study was to evaluate whether levels of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) patients are associated with carotid atherosclerosis, related to levels of soluble receptor for advanced glycation end-products (sRAGE) and influenced by immunosuppressive or lipid-lowering therapy. Twenty-three GPA patients and 20 controls were evaluated for HMGB1- and sRAGE levels and for carotid atherosclerosis using ultrasound to determine intima-media thickness (IMT). In vitro the effect of atorvastatin on the production of HMGB1 by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was assessed. Serum HMGB1 and sRAGE levels did not differ between patients and controls. A negative correlation was found between sRAGE and maximum IMT but HMGB1 and carotid IMT were not related. HMGB1 levels were reduced in GPA patients on statins and prednisolone. In vitro, atorvastatin reduced HMGB1 levels in supernatants of activated HUVEC. In conclusion, carotid IMT is inversely correlated with sRAGE levels but not with HMGB1 levels. Statins and prednisolone are associated with reduced serum HMGB1 levels and atorvastatin decreases HMGB1 release by activated HUVEC in vitro, indicating an additional anti-inflammatory effect of statins.", 
    "109": "The antitumour effect of statins has already been proven in animal experiments and human cancer cell lines in several gastrointestinal cancers. The chemopreventive mechanism is not completely clarified but the enhancement of oxidative stress, increased autophagy, altered expression of pro- and antiproliferative proteins and their influence on intracellular signaling pathways may play a role. Randomized studies, however, failed to confirme the expected results obtained from experimental studies. The goal of this review is to summarize the data available in the literature regarding the chemopreventive effects of statins on several gastrointestinal cancers. Results of clinical trials suggest that 10-20 mg statin daily has no or minimal antitumour effect. Chemopreventive effect of hydrophilic statins could not be detected but it seems to be significant in the case of hydrophobic statins. There are only few data available on the long-term daily use of 30-40 mg statins. Further long-term evaluation of the effect of statins regarding gastrointestinal cancers is needed, and an analysis of compound- and dose-related subgroups would be beneficial. Chemoprevention with statins cannot yet be accepted as standard medical practice. Use of statins as chemopreventive agents cannot be a substitute for regular oncological screening or surveillance.",

Patients who were taking statins before admission to the ICU whether or not treatment was continued thereafter ('previous users' group) were compared to those without prior statin therapy ('statin-naive' group). A survival analysis using a Cox model was conducted in the whole cohort and in the subgroup of prior statin users.",

The volume of lesion before treatment as well as on day 2 and day 7 after initial treatment was measured by MRI, respectively. The behaviors before SDH induction and on the days 1, 3, 5 and 7 after the initial treatment were dynamically evaluated. Gene expression, cytokine secretion and the number of neutrophilic granulocyte and vascular density were measured in both neomembrane and SDH lesion on the day 2 and day 7 after the initial treatment.",

By virtue of MRI scanning, it was revealed that SDH volumes were eliminated at a high speed by administration of atorvastatin than that of saline. With the help of the microscopic examination in the neomembrane, it was detected that the density of CD31+ neovasculars in the atorvastatin group was significantly higher than that in the saline group and the number of neutrophilic granulocyte in the atorvastatin group is less than that in the saline group. In comparison with saline treatment, the atorvastatin treatment did not change IL-10 expression and secretion, but it significantly decreased TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 level as well as VEGF gene expression.",

A mouse model of carotid arterial injury was established, followed by intragastric administration of atorvastatin at a dose of 0.6 mg\u00b7(kg body mass)(-1)\u00b7d(-1). Pathological sections of carotid artery stained with hematoxylin and eosin were observed under light microscopy. Expression levels of eNOS mRNA and protein were detected with real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. Proliferation and differentiation of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) were observed after treatment, in vitro. Reendothelialization appeared on the neovascular surface, while intimal hyperplasia was inhibited after treatment with atorvastatin. Numbers of CD31-positive cells increased after atorvastatin treatment, as did the number of leucocyte antigen positive cells. The expression of cell markers, such as CD34, eNOS, and VEGF-R, were higher in the atorvastatin-treated group of mononuclear cells. EPC numbers increased with the concentration of atorvastatin. The expression of eNOS mRNA was reduced in the mice with carotid artery injury that were treated with normal saline. The expression levels of eNOS protein were increased in atorvastatin treatment group. In conclusion, atorvastatin stimulates EPCs to differentiate into endothelial cells and promotes the repair of carotid arterial injury.",

The authors claim to refer entirely to evidence from randomized controlled trials, thereby confining their guidelines to statins as the primary therapeutic option. The guidelines derived from these trials do not specify treatment goals, but refer to the percentage of cholesterol reduction by statin medication with low, moderate, and high intensity. However, these targets are just as little tested in randomized trials as are the cholesterol goals derived from clinical experience. The same applies to the guidelines of the four patient groups which are defined by vascular risk. No major statin trial has included patients on the basis of their global risk; thus the allocation criteria are also arbitrarily chosen. These would actually lead to a significant increase in the number of patients to be treated with high or maximum dosages of statins. Also, adhering to dosage regulations instead of cholesterol goals contradicts the principles of individualized patient care. The option of the new risk score to calculate lifetime risk up to the age of 80 years in addition to the 10-year risk can be appreciated. Unfortunately it is not considered in the therapeutic recommendations provided, despite evidence from population and genetic studies showing that even a moderate lifetime reduction of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol or non-HDL cholesterol has a much stronger effect than an aggressive treatment at an advanced age. In respect to secondary prevention, the new American guidelines broadly match the European guidelines. Thus, the involved societies from Germany, Austria and Switzerland recommend continuing according to established standards, such as the EAS/ESC guidelines.", 
    "143": "With the release of the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults, emphasis has been placed on using evidence-based intensity of therapy to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk, rather than focusing on goal cholesterol levels. Before initiating therapy, however, it is critical that physicians and patients discuss 4 key topics: (1) the benefit of ASCVD risk reduction, (2) medication adverse effects, (3) drug-drug interactions, and (4) patient preferences. To facilitate discussion of statin adverse effects, we present here an evidence-based review of the 5 Ms of statin adverse effects: metabolism, muscle, medication interactions, major organ effects, and memory. \"Metabolism\" represents the small risk of new-onset diabetes that comes with statins, which is highest in those with diabetes risk factors. \"Muscle\" requires discussion of the wide range of muscle symptoms that occur with statins but emphasizes that these have been no more prevalent than those experienced with placebo in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). \"Medication interactions\" emphasize that statins interact with numerous medications. Interaction profiles vary widely between statins, and patients should be made aware of the most common interactions with their prescription. \"Major organ effects\" prompt the physician to review the possibility of a transient transaminitis as well as the recent observation of rare acute kidney injury with statin use. Both are rare and do not require routine monitoring. Finally, \"memory\" references the recent observational data suggesting statins may contribute to memory loss and confusion, both of which have not been observed in RCTs and resolve with drug cessation. Reviewing these common effects has the possibility to strengthen the doctor-patient relationship and boost both medication adherence and patient satisfaction.", 
    "144": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of death and disability not only in countries with a high degree of socio-economic development but also in low-middle income countries. The study of atherosclerosis and the strategies to control ASCVD are in progress. All strategies emphasize the need for lowering LDL cholesterol through appropriate lifestyle and use of lipid-lowering drugs, mainly statins. The mode of approach is variable. Statin therapy is recommended in secondary prevention, whereas use in primary prevention is still a matter of debate. The guidelines provided by international panels serve as a reference in clinical practice but, as stated by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP), do not replace the physician's clinical judgment.", 
    "145": "Inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) has been vigorously pursued as a potential therapy to treat patients who are at an elevated risk for coronary artery disease. Anacetrapib, a novel CETP inhibitor, has been shown clinically to raise HDL cholesterol and reduce LDL cholesterol when provided as monotherapy or when co-administered with a statin. Preclinically, the effects of anacetrapib on the functionality and composition of HDL have been extensively studied. In contrast, the effects of anacetrapib on other parameters related to lipoprotein metabolism and cardiovascular risk have been difficult to explore. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effects of anacetrapib in rhesus macaques and to compare these to effects reported in dyslipidemic humans. Our results from two separate studies show that administration of anacetrapib (150 mg/kg q.d. for 10 days) to rhesus macaques results in alterations in CETP activity (reduced by more than 70%) and HDL cholesterol (increased by more than 110%) which are similar to those reported in dyslipidemic humans. Levels of LDL cholesterol were reduced by more than 60%, an effect slightly greater than what has been observed clinically. Treatment with anacetrapib in this model was also found to lead to statistically significant reductions in plasma PCSK9 and to reduce cholesterol excursion in the combined chylomicron and remnant lipoprotein fraction isolated from plasma by fast protein liquid chromatography. Collectively, these data suggest that rhesus macaques may be a useful translational model to study the mechanistic effects of CETP inhibition.", 
    "146": "Atorvastatin is a statin largely used in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and recently revealed as a neuroprotective agent. The antidepressant-like effect of acute atorvastatin treatment in mice has been previously demonstrated by our laboratory. The purpose of this study was to explore the contribution of the serotonergic system in the antidepressant-like effect of atorvastatin in mice. Data demonstrate that the serotonin (5-HT) depleting agent p-chlorophenylalanine methyl ester (PCPA, 100 mg/kg, i.p.) completely abolished atorvastatin (0.1 mg/kg, p.o.) antidepressant-like effect. Besides atorvastatin, fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, p.o.), a serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) was able to exert an antidepressant-like effect, but any of them changed 5-HT content in the hippocampus or frontal cortex. The 5H-T1A (WAY100635, 0.1 mg/kg, s.c) or the 5-HT2A/2C (ketanserin, 5 mg/kg, s.c.) receptor antagonists prevented atorvastatin antidepressant-like effect. In addition, a combinatory antidepressant-like effect was observed when mice received the co-administration of sub-effective doses of atorvastatin (0.01 mg/kg, p.o.) and the SSRI fluoxetine (5 mg/kg, p.o.), paroxetine (0.1 mg/kg, p.o.) or sertraline (1 mg/kg, p.o.). Taken together, these results indicate that the antidepressant-like effect of atorvastatin depends on the serotonergic system modulation.", 
    "147": "Cholesterol has been shown to promote cell proliferation/migration in many cells; however the mechanism(s) have not yet been fully identified. Here we demonstrate that cholesterol increases Ca(2+) entry via the TRPM7 channel, which promoted proliferation of prostate cells by inducing the activation of the AKT and/or the ERK pathway. Additionally, cholesterol mediated Ca(2+) entry induced calpain activity that showed a decrease in E-cadherin expression, which together could lead to migration of prostate cancer cells. An overexpression of TRPM7 significantly facilitated cholesterol dependent Ca(2+) entry, cell proliferation and tumor growth. Whereas, TRPM7 silencing or inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by statin showed a significant decrease in cholesterol-mediated activation of TRPM7, cell proliferation, and migration of prostate cancer cells. Consistent with these results, statin intake was inversely correlated with prostate cancer patients and increase in TRPM7 expression was observed in samples obtained from prostate cancer patients. Altogether, we provide evidence that cholesterol-mediated activation of TRPM7 is important for prostate cancer and have identified that TRPM7 could be essential for initiation and/or progression of prostate cancer.",

PLIN5 is expressed in oxidative tissues including the liver, and is critical during LD biogenesis. Studies showed that statins reduce hepatic triglyceride contents in some patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and in rodent models of diet-induced hepatosteatosis. Whether statins alter triglyceride synthesis, storage, and/or utilization within the hepatocyte is unknown, though. Here we tested the hypothesis that statins alter the metabolism of LD in the hepatocyte during physiological conditions, such as fasting-induced steatosis.",

    "150": "We show that statins decrease the levels of PLIN5, but not other LD-associated genes, in both mouse liver and mouse/human primary hepatocytes, which is paralleled by a significant reduction in both intracellular triglycerides and the number of LD. We identify an atypical negative sterol regulatory sequence in the proximal promoter of mouse/human PLIN5 that recruits the transcription factor SREBP2 and confers response to statins. Finally, we show that the statin-dependent reduction of hepatocyte triglyceride contents is mimicked by partial knock-down of PLIN5; conversely, ectopic overexpression of PLIN5 reverts the statin effect.",

There are many risk factors associated with the patient and with the pharmacological treatment. A risk of muscle injury of 1-5% has been reported with some statins combined with fibrates. The fibrate with the highest risk of myopathy in combination with statins is gemfibrozil, while phenofibrate seems to be the safest. The case is presented of a 60 year-old woman with clinical symptoms and laboratory findings that suggested rhabdomyolysis secondary to a combination of simvastatin and phenofibrate. This case reminds physicians of the need to closely monitor these patients, in addition to alert them to the onset of muscle pain or weakness.",

The relation between statin therapy, in vivo thromboxane (Tx) generation; a marker of inflammation, and blood thrombogenicity has never been explored. Urinary 11-dehydro (dh) TxB2 was determined in patients with suspected CAD on 325 mg daily aspirin therapy prior to undergoing cardiac catheterisation (n=281). Thrombogenicity was estimated by thrombelastographic measurement of thrombin-induced platelet-fibrin clot strength (TIP-FCS) and lipids/lipoproteins were determined by vertical density gradient ultracentrifugation/ELISA. The influence of statin therapy and dose was analysed by the atorvastatin equivalent dose (5-10 mg, 20-40 mg, or 80 mg daily). Statin therapy (n=186) was associated with a dose-dependent reduction in urinary 11-dh TxB2 (p=0.046) that was independent of LDL and apo B100 levels but was strongly related to TIP-FCS (p=0.006). By multivariate analysis, no statin therapy (n=95) and female gender were independently associated with high urinary 11-dh TxB2 [OR=2.95 (0.1.57-5.50, p=0.0007); OR=2.25 (1.24-4.05, p=0.007)], respectively. In aspirin-treated patients, statin therapy was independently and inversely associated with inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. Elevated 11-dh TxB2 was associated with a prothrombotic state indicated by high TIP-FCS.

Moreover, there are no therapies that may prevent the onset or progression of tumors in patients with succinate dehydrogenase type B mutations, which are associated with very aggressive tumors. Therefore, we tested the approved and well-tolerated drugs lovastatin and 13-cis-retinoic acid (13cRA) in vitro in an aggressive PCC mouse cell line, mouse tumor tissue-derived (MTT) cells, and in vivo in a PCC allograft nude mouse model, in therapeutically relevant doses. Treatment was started 24 hours before sc tumor cell injection and continued for 30 more days. Tumor sizes were measured from outside by caliper and sizes of viable tumor mass by bioluminescence imaging. Lovastatin showed antiproliferative effects in vitro and led to significantly smaller tumor sizes in vivo compared with vehicle treatment. 13cRA promoted tumor cell growth in vitro and led to significantly larger viable tumor mass and significantly faster increase of viable tumor mass in vivo over time compared with vehicle, lovastatin, and combination treatment. However, when combined with lovastatin, 13cRA enhanced the antiproliferative effect of lovastatin in vivo. The combination-treated mice showed slowest tumor growth of all groups with significantly slower tumor growth compared with the vehicle-treated mice and significantly smaller tumor sizes. Moreover, the combination-treated group displayed the smallest size of viable tumor mass and the slowest increase in viable tumor mass over time of all groups, with a significant difference compared with the vehicle- and 13cRA-treated group. The combination-treated tumors showed highest extent of necrosis, lowest median microvessel density and highest expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin. The combination of high microvessel density and low \u03b1-smooth muscle actin is a predictor of poor prognosis in other tumor entities. Therefore, this drug combination may be a well-tolerated novel therapeutic or preventive option for malignant PCC.",

In case-control analyses, patients on statins had a 31% lower odds of death, compared with 39% for QResearch (adjusted OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.75; vs OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.72). Results were also close for individual statins.", 
    "196": "Database differences in population characteristics and in data definitions, recording, quality and completeness had a minimal impact on key statistical outputs. The results uphold the validity of research using CPRD and QResearch by providing independent evidence that both datasets produce very similar estimates of treatment effect, leading to the same clinical and policy decisions. Together with other non-independent replication studies, there is a nascent body of evidence for wider validity.", 
    "197": "It is not known whether the addition of ezetimibe to statins adds cardiovascular protection beyond the expected changes in lipid levels. Subjects with coronary heart disease were treated with four consecutive 1-week courses of therapy (T) and evaluations. The courses were: T1, 100 mg aspirin alone; T2, 100 mg aspirin and 40 mg simvastatin/10 mg ezetimibe; T3, 40 mg simvastatin/10 mg ezetimibe, and 75 mg clopidogrel (300 mg initial loading dose); T4, 75 mg clopidogrel alone. Platelet aggregation was examined in whole blood. Endothelial microparticles (CD51), platelet microparticles (CD42/CD31), and endothelial progenitor cells (CD34/CD133; CDKDR/CD133, or CD34/KDR) were quantified by flow cytometry. Endothelial function was examined by flow-mediated dilation. Comparisons between therapies revealed differences in lipids (T2 and T3<T1 and T4 for total cholesterol, LDL-C, and triglycerides; P<0.002 for all), as well as for endothelial function (T2>T1 and T4, P=0.001). Decreased platelet aggregation was observed after aspirin (arachidonic acid, T1<T3 and T4, P=0.034) and clopidogrel (adenosine, T3 and T4<T1 and T2, P<0.0001) therapy. Simvastatin/ezetimibe diphosphate did not change platelet aggregation, the amount of circulating endothelial and platelet microparticles, or endothelial progenitor cells. Cardiovascular protection following therapy with simvastatin/ezetimibe seems restricted to lipid changes and improvement of endothelial function not affecting the release of microparticles, mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells or decreased platelet aggregation.", 
    "198": "Therapy with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) has been associated with a significant reduction in the number of major cardiovascular (CV) events in diabetic patients. The mechanisms by which these drugs improve cardiac status remain unclear. We assessed the effects of atorvastatin (10 mg/kg/day) on CV function in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.", 
    "199": "Age-matched, nondiabetic rats were used as controls. Echocardiographic parameters, systolic blood pressure (SBP), endothelial-dependent relaxation, cardiac and vascular oxidative stress, perivascular fibrosis, and cholesterol levels were evaluated after a 4-week atorvastatin treatment period.", 
    "200": "In diabetic rats, SBP was higher than in controls. Atorvastatin decreased SBP in diabetic rats by 14% (n = 10, p < 0.05), and significantly increased stroke volume, ejection fraction, and cardiac output index. Whereas atorvastatin reduced left ventricular end systolic volume (LVESV) by 50% (p < 0.05), it failed to reduce left ventricular end diastolic volume (LVEDV). Total cholesterol was higher in diabetic rats than in controls and atorvastatin was ineffective in reducing cholesterol levels. The statin, however, decreased perivascular fibrosis and media thickness, and the markers of oxidative stress malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hidroxyalkenals (4-HAE) in aortic homogenates from diabetic rats. In addition, atorvastatin improved endothelial function by increasing the E MAX value of the acetylcholine-induced relaxation from 53.7 \u00b1 4.1% in untreated diabetic to 82.1 \u00b1 7.0% in treated diabetic rats (n = 10, p < 0.05). L-NAME fully abolished this improvement, suggesting that the increased vascular relaxation with atorvastatin is NO-dependent.", 
    "201": "Whereas atorvastatin does not reverse ventricular dilatation, it does have a positive hemodynamic effect on the CV system of diabetic rats. This hemodynamic benefit is independent of cholesterol levels, and is observed concomitantly with reduced oxidative stress, vascular remodeling, and improved endothelial function. Together, these results suggest that atorvastatin decreases the workload on the heart and improves systolic performance in type 1 diabetic rats by reducing oxidative stress, vascular tone, and systemic vascular resistance.", 
    "202": "Clinical studies have suggested the beneficial effects of statin therapy on diastolic heart failure. However, the mechanism of the beneficial effects of statin on diastolic heart failure remains unknown. We examined the effect of atorvastatin on the cardiac function of Dahl salt-sensitive rat, a model of hypertensive diastolic heart failure.", 
    "203": "Dahl salt-sensitive rats were divided into three groups: the low-salt group (given standard diet), the high-salt group (given 8% NaCl diet from 7 weeks of age), and the high-salt + atorvastatin (HS + Ato) group (given 8% NaCl diet from 7 weeks of age and atorvastatin from 17 weeks of age). We evaluated left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), fibrosis, and function by using echocardiography and histology. We also examined the expression of molecules related to fibrosis in the hearts of Dahl salt-sensitive rats and cultured rat cardiac fibroblasts.", 
    "204": "Left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, and cardiac fibrosis were observed in the high-salt group. Atorvastatin ameliorated cardiac fibrosis and normalized left ventricular diastolic function without altering blood pressure. Atorvastatin also decreased the expression of heat shock protein 47 (HSP47), an essential chaperone for type 1 collagen processing, without changing in expression of transforming growth factor beta. In rat cardiac fibroblast cells, atorvastatin also reduced HSP47 level induced by transforming growth factor beta. The effect of atorvastatin was reversed by mevalonate and geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate and mimicked by Rho kinase inhibitor.", 
    "205": "Atorvastatin administration ameliorates cardiac fibrosis and improves left ventricular diastolic function in Dahl salt-sensitive rats. Lowering HSP47 by atorvastatin via inhibition of Rho-Rho kinase pathway is suggested as a mechanism."
