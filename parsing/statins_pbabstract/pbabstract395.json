Efficacy and safety analyses were performed on the initial 26-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled period; further safety analyses were conducted on the subsequent 52 weeks, which included an additional 26-week double-blind phase permitting other lipid-lowering agents and a final 26-week open-label period. At offweeks, pravastatin at a dose of 20 mg once daily at bedtime significantly lowered serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 26% (4.7 to 3.5 mmol/liter [182 to 135 mg/dl]), total cholesterol 19% (6.8 to 5.6 mmol/liter [263 to 217 mg/dl]) and triglycerides 12% (1.8 to 1.6 mmol/liter [159 to 142 mg/dl]) (p < 0.001 compared with placebo) and significantly raised serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 7% (1.1 to 1.2 mmol/liter [43 to 46 mg/dl]) (p < 0.001 compared with placebo). Efficacy of pravastatin was maintained at 26 weeks, and during this initial period there were significantly more serious cardiovascular adverse events in the placebo group (13 events, 2.4%) than in the pravastatin group (1 event, 0.2%) (p < 0.001). Six myocardial infarctions, 5 cases of unstable angina and 1 sudden cardiac death occurred in the placebo group, compared with none of these events in the pravastatin group. In this study, pravastatin produced beneficial effects on serum lipids and was associated with a reduction in the incidence of serious cardiovascular adverse events.", 
    "1": "We treated hyperlipidemia in patients with nephrotic syndrome (NS) using pravastatin for more than one year. There were 7 cases consisting of 3 with minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS), 1 with focal glomerulosclerosis (FGS), 1 with proliferative glomerulonephritis (PGN), 2 with membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) and 1 of unknown origin. Three cases consisted of frequent relapsers, and 4 were steroid-resistant. Six randomly selected age- and sex-matched nephrotic patients were used as controls. The daily excretion of proteinuria was not decreased after pravastatin treatment, but, the serum albumin rose from 3.1 +/- 1.1 to 3.4 +/- 1.0 mg/dl. The serum total cholesterol level was significantly reduced from 401 +/- 174 mg/dl to 331 +/- 103 mg/dl in spite of an absence of marked change in the control group. However, there were no significant changes in the triglyceride and lipoprotein levels. The atherogenic index was 7.1 +/- 3.7 before and 2.8 +/- 1.7 after pravastatin treatment, respectively. Improvement of renal function defined by delta decrement of renal function per year (0.08 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.12 +/- 0.26) was observed after the discontinuation of pravastatin administration in 3 out of 4 intractable cases. We conclude that pravastatin has a potent effect in reducing the serum level of total cholesterol, but not triglyceride in NS. Furthermore, pravastatin can induce renal dysfunction especially in patients with intractable nephrotic syndrome.", 
    "2": "An LC procedure suitable for quantitative analysis of pg ml-1 concentrations of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor rivastatin in blood plasma was developed. The procedure involves an extraction step, chromatography on an ODS column, and fluorometric detection of a post-column photolytic decomposition product that was isolated and identified. The achieved quantitation limit (25 pg ml-1) facilitated analysis of relatively low rivastatin concentrations in plasma that were observed after 100-300 micrograms oral doses of rivastatin. At 25 pg ml-1 concentration the RSD ranged from 3.6 to 13.5% and mean deviation from the nominal value was 8.0%; at 8 ng ml-1 the RSD range was 0.7-3.6% while the mean deviation was -1.8%. The concentrations obtained with the LC procedure were compared to the concentrations obtained with a specific but less sensitive capillary GC method and a radioimmunoassay (RIA) procedure. Concentrations obtained with the HPLC and GC procedures agreed within experimental error; the RIA concentrations were about 30% higher.", 
    "3": "Lovastatin is a prodrug lactone whose open-chain 3,5-dihydroxy acid is a potent, competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. The compound undergoes extensive and complex metabolism in animals and humans, with the metabolites excreted predominantly in bile. Radiochromatograms of bile from three human subjects and of bile and liver homogenates from mouse, rat, and dog displayed obvious species differences. Biotransformation of lovastatin occurred by three distinct routes, namely hydrolysis of the lactone ring to yield the pharmacologically active dihydroxy acid, cytochrome P-450-mediated oxidation of the fused-ring system, and beta-oxidation of the dihydroxy acid side chain. The first two reactions occurred in all four species, but the last was observed in mouse and rat only. The P-450 reactions, hydroxylation and a novel dehydrogenation reaction, yielded a 6'-hydroxylated metabolite of the dihydroxy acid and a 6'-exomethylene derivative as major and minor metabolites, respectively, in the bile of rat and dog. Human bile, which contained predominantly polar metabolites, yielded these metabolites in similar proportions only after mild hydrolysis at pH 5.0. In mouse and rat an atypical beta-oxidation of the dihydroxy acid side chain occurred to give a pentanoic acid derivative that was observed in liver homogenates. This metabolite was subsequently conjugated with taurine and excreted in the bile. From these studies, cytochrome P-450 oxidation is the primary route of phase I metabolism for lovastatin in human and dog, but beta-oxidation plays a major metabolic role in rodents.", 
    "4": "The coexistence of hypercholesterolemia and hypertension often requires concomitant drug treatments. Thus, it is interesting to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the new lipid-lowering agent fluvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA)-reductase inhibitor, in patients receiving concomitant antihypertensive/cardiovascular drug treatments. A retrospective analysis was based on data from controlled clinical trials in which 1815 patients were treated with fluvastatin and 783 patients received placebo. The daily dose of fluvastatin was > or = 20 mg. At least one of the following drug treatments was taken by 445 of the fluvastatin-treated patients (24.5%) and 181 of those receiving placebo (23.1%): beta-adrenergic-receptor blockers (fluvastatin: n = 182; placebo: n = 84); diuretics (fluvastatin: n = 168; placebo: n = 72); calcium antagonists (fluvastatin: n = 161; placebo: n = 69); and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (fluvastatin: n = 101; placebo: n = 30). The majority of patients received monotherapy with one of the above-mentioned antihypertensive agents (fluvastatin: 69%; placebo: 65%). The efficacy of fluvastatin in modifying low-density lipoprotein (LDL)- and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and triglyceride levels was not consistently different in patients taking a given antihypertensive compared with the overall group and the patients not taking the antihypertensive agent. In patients taking fluvastatin and antihypertensives, confirmed (measured at two consecutive occasions) increases more than three times the upper limit of normal in aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) occurred in only two patients. One case involved the concomitant use of a beta-blocker (ASAT and ALAT) and the other a diuretic (ALAT).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "5": "Feeding a 0.5% diosgenin plus 0.02% simvastatin diet to rats increases biliary cholesterol concentration and saturation to levels generally found in human native supersaturated bile. By using preparative ultracentrifugation, gel filtration chromatography, and electron microscopy, we isolated, purified, and identified lamellar structures (unilamellar vesicles and multilamellae) as a major biliary cholesterol transport in supersaturated human and rat bile. It was estimated that more than 60% of biliary cholesterol is transported in these lamellar carriers, which were identified by transmission electron microscopy as unilamellar vesicles and multilamellar bodies within bile canaliculi of rats with cholesterol supersaturated bile. By SDS-PAGE, a characteristic and constant protein profile was found associated to the purified lamellar carriers. One of these proteins, a 130-kDa protein, was isolated from human biliary lamellae and used for preparation of a rabbit polyclonal antibody, which cross-reacted with the homologous rat protein. By Western blotting, it was established that the purified low density fraction of bile-Metrizamide gradients, containing lamellae, was enriched with the 130-kDa protein. The 130-kDa protein was characteristically detected at the canalicular membrane by Western blotting of hepatic subcellular fractions and by immunohistochemistry of rat and human liver biopsies. Amino acid sequencing of the amino terminus of the 130-kDa protein demonstrated a complete identity with aminopeptidase N, a canalicular transmembrane hydrophobic glycoprotein. These studies show that biliary lipids may acquire an ordered multilamellar structure that is present in the canaliculi of rats with supersaturated bile. These biliary lamellae are similar to lamellar bodies and surfactant-like material frequently found in other epithelia, suggesting common biogenetic, structural, and functional properties. The identification of aminopeptidase N associated with biliary lamellae is consistent with the involvement of the canalicular membrane in the secretory mechanism of biliary lipids.", 
    "6": "Expression of ras has been correlated with increased intrinsic resistance to ionizing radiation. In this study we show that increased EJras expression in human cells is associated with a decrease in the frequency of radiation-induced micronuclei. The experimental system consisted of human osteosarcoma-derived cell lines which quantitatively vary in their EJras expression. There was a dose-dependent relationship between radiation dose and micronuclei formation in all cell lines tested. Human osteosarcoma cells, in which the ras level was undetectable, had the highest frequency of micronuclei production at all radiation doses tested. At 4 Gy the most radioresistant cells exhibited a 41.5 +/- 5% decrease in the production of micronuclei concomitant with high ras expression in comparison with the relatively radiosensitive parental cell line. Cells expressing a low amount of EJras demonstrated a 23 +/- 3% decrease in micronuclei induction compared with parental cells. Treatment of cells with lovastatin, an inhibitor of ras-encoded p21ras post-translational processing via the mevalonate pathway, markedly decreased the yield of micronuclei formation in cells transfected with ras; the drug had no effect on radiation-induced micronuclei formation in parental cells. The use of the in vitro micronuclei assay has provided a convenient way to visualize differences in the genotoxic damage induced by ionizing radiation in cells which express different amount of EJras. The results indicate that elevation of ras expression in human cells can lead to a decrease in the number of radiation-induced micronuclei formed and that this relationship is dependent on membrane association of ras-encoded p21.", 
    "7": "The chemical synthesis and metabolic characteristics of the lanosterol analogue, 15 alpha-fluorolanost-7-en-3 beta-ol, are described. The 15 alpha-fluorosterol is shown to be a competitive inhibitor of the lanosterol 14 alpha-methyl demethylase (Ki = 315 microM), as well as substrate for the demethylase enzyme. Metabolic studies show that the 15 alpha-fluorosterol is converted to the corresponding 15 alpha-fluoro-3 beta-hydroxylanost-7-en-32-aldehyde by hepatic microsomal lanosterol 14 alpha-methyl demethylase but that further metabolic conversion to cholesterol biosynthetic intermediates is blocked by virtue of the 15 alpha-fluoro substitution. When cultured cells are treated with the fluorinated lanosterol analogue, a decrease in 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase activity and immunoreactive protein was observed. However, when the lanosterol 14 alpha-methyl demethylase-deficient mutant cell line, AR45, is treated with the fluorosterol, no effect upon HMG-CoA reductase is observed. Thus, metabolic conversion of the sterol to its 32-carboxaldehyde analogue by the lanosterol 14 alpha-methyl demethylase is required for HMG-CoA reductase suppressor activity. Measurement of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels in 15 alpha-fluorosterol-treated Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells reveals that mRNA levels are not decreased by the sterol as would be expected for a sterol regulator of HMG-CoA reductase activity. The decrease in HMG-CoA reductase protein is due to inhibition of enzyme synthesis, suggesting that the 15 alpha-fluorosterol reduces the translational efficiency of the reductase mRNA. Measurements of the half-life of HMG-CoA reductase show that, in contrast to other oxysterols, the 15 alpha-fluorolanostenol does not increase the rate of degradation of the enzyme. Collectively, these data support the premise that oxylanosterols regulate HMG-CoA reductase expression through a post-transcriptional process which may be distinct from other previously described sterol regulatory mechanisms.", 
    "8": "Lovastatin inhibits mitogenesis in cultured cells and growth of tumors in vivo by unknown mechanism(s). Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3-kinase) is a putative second messenger-generating enzyme whose physical association with the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) has been demonstrated to be required for the mitogenic activity of PDGF in cultured fibroblasts. Here we examine the effect of lovastatin on PDGF- and insulin-stimulated PI-3-kinase activity. In quiescent NIH-3T3 cells, PDGF (25 ng/ml) and insulin (200 nM) stimulate PI-3-kinase activity 10- and 6-fold, respectively. However, overnight pretreatment of cells with 10 microM lovastatin inhibits this stimulation of PI-3-kinase activity by PDGF and insulin. Immunoprecipitation of the PI-3-kinase p85 subunit demonstrates a PDGF-dependent association of PI-3-kinase with the tyrosine-autophosphorylated PDGFR. However, upon exposure of cells to 10 microns lovastatin for 40 h, the level of autophosphorylated PDGFR associating with PI-3-kinase after PDGF stimulation decreases significantly (75% reduction). No change in the expression of the PI-3-kinase p85 subunit was observed after treatment of cells with lovastatin. These results demonstrate that lovastatin disrupts a major growth factor signaling pathway and that inhibition of PDGF-induced association of PI-3-kinase with PDGFR and subsequent inhibition of PI-3-kinase activity is one potential mechanism by which lovastatin inhibits cell growth.", 
    "9": "HMG-CoA reductase catalyzes the synthesis of mevalonate, a crucial intermediate in the biosynthesis of cholesterol and non-sterol isoprenoid compounds essential for cell growth. The HMG-CoA reductase activity of the A549 tumor cell line is higher than that of normal human fibroblasts. This deregulation in mevalonate needs was not due to an alteration in the activated state of the enzyme by short-term regulation. We show that the HMG-CoA reductase in A549 cell line was subject to a multivalent feedback control. A high fraction (40%) of the reductase activity was devoted to non-sterol products. In contrast, normal fibroblasts had only 15-20% of the reductase activity that generated non-sterol products. We also show that cholesterol and at least one of the non-sterol products are necessary for optimal cell growth of A549 cells. Our data strongly suggest that A549 cells produce more non-sterol substances which may be related to increased requirements of mevalonate for upregulated cell growth.", 
    "10": "Lovastatin was used to study the role of isoprenylated GTP-binding proteins in the regulation of intracellular pH in granulocytic HL-60 cells. The cytosolic acidification that accompanies stimulation by chemoattractants was completely eliminated by lovastatin. The subsequent activation of Na+/H+ exchange was partially inhibited by the isoprenylation antagonist. In contrast, the osmotic activation of the Na+/H+ antiport was unaffected. The data indicate that the osmotically- and receptor-induced activation of the antiport utilize divergent signalling pathways. The results also provide evidence supporting the notion that cytosolic acidification by chemoattractants results from accumulation of metabolic acid generated during the respiratory burst.", 
    "11": "Serum levels of cholesterol and the cholesterol precursor lathosterol were determined in five healthy volunteers who took 20 mg simvastatin daily during 1 week. During this period and for the following 5 days blood samples were collected. Five days after ingestion of simvastatin, serum lathosterol had already reached a steady-state level and its concentration decreased by 55-73%. In contrast, the cholesterol concentration decreased only by 17-29% and did not reach a steady-state level even after 7 days of treatment. After withdrawal of simvastatin, serum lathosterol quickly rose to pretreatment values. From the data a mean half-life of lathosterol could be calculated of 23.5 +/- 6.6 h during treatment with simvastatin and of 28.7 +/- 15.1 h after its withdrawal, taking, respectively, the decrease and increase of serum lathosterol into account. From these data it can be concluded that serum lathosterol is also a good parameter for determining whole body cholesterol synthesis during non-steady-state conditions, although plasma mevalonic acid, another (early) cholesterol precursor, is preferred owning to its much shorter reported half-life.", 
    "12": "Proliferation of exponentially growing breast cancer cells (line Hs578T) was blocked specifically in G1 by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibition, as well as by inhibition of N-linked glycosylation. As a consequence of these inhibitory conditions, the cells were synchronized in the G1 stage of the cell cycle. The similarities in the kinetic responses point to the possibility that the two different types of metabolic inhibitions block cell cycle progression by common mechanisms. One possibility is that the inhibition of HMG CoA reductase activity also leads to a depressed rate of N-linked glycosylation, which in turn may constitute the critical event for cell cycle progression and cell growth. In order to investigate whether this relationship exists in breast cancer cells, cells synchronized in G1 by mevinolin (an inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase) were used. Upon addition of mevalonate, whose endogenous synthesis is catalysed by HMG CoA reductase, the cells entered S phase after a 4 h pre-replicative period. Mevalonate stimulation also led to a rapid and substantial increase in N-linked glycosylation, measured by determining the uptake of radioactive glucosamine. This metabolic event was found to be of critical importance for the initiation of DNA synthesis. However, as soon as the cells had entered S phase, they were independent of the level of N-linked glycosylation.", 
    "13": "The pH dependence of the interconversion kinetics, equilibrium, and solubilities of the lactone and hydroxyacid forms of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, CI-981 ([R-(R*,R*)]-2-(4-fluorophenyl)- beta,delta-dihydroxy-5-(1-methylethyl)-3-phenyl-4-[(phenylamino)carbonyl ]- 1H-pyrrole-1-hepatonic acid), are important considerations when choosing and developing one of the forms of these compounds. Over a pH range of 2.1 to 6.0 and at 30 degrees C, the apparent solubility of the sodium salt of CI-981 (i.e., the hydroxyacid form) increases about 60-fold, from 20.4 micrograms/mL to 1.23 mg/mL, and the profile yields a pKa for the terminal carboxyl group of 4.46. In contrast, over a pH range of 2.3 to 7.7 and also at 30 degrees C, the apparent solubility of the lactone form of CI-981 varies little, and the mean solubility is 1.34 (+/- 0.53) micrograms/mL. The kinetics of interconversion and the equilibrium between the hydroxyacid and the lactone forms have been studied as a function of pH, buffer concentration, and temperature at a fixed ionic strength (0.5 M) using a stability-indicating HPLC assay. The acid-catalyzed reaction is reversible, whereas the base-catalyzed reaction can be treated as an irreversible reaction. More specifically, at pH < 6, an equilibrium favoring the hydroxyacid form is established, whereas at pH > 6, the equilibrium reaction is no longer detectable and greatly favors the hydroxyacid form.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "14": "Hypercholesterolemia is associated with an increased incidence of vascular complications. To assess the actual degree of activation of coagulation systems and vascular disorders in hypercholesterolemia, plasma levels of vascular endothelial cell markers, such as thrombomodulin (TM), tissue-type plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor-I (PAI-I), and von Willebrand factor, were measured in 51 patients with hypercholesterolemia. We also investigated the effects of Pravastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, on plasma lipid, lipoprotein a, and hemostatic markers. The mean plasma levels of thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT), fibrinopeptide A (FPA), TM, and PAI-I were significantly elevated in hypercholesterolemia. Of the hemostatic markers, only TM was significantly increased in patients with ischemic heart diseases (IHD). The mean concentration of total cholesterol and levels of TAT, FPA, PAI-I, and TM were significantly reduced after the Pravastatin treatment. The PIC/TAT ratio was significantly increased in non-IHD patients after treatment, this was not the case in IHD patients. These findings suggested the presence of a thrombogenic state and vascular endothelial cell disorders in hypercholesterolemia; such a state might well be related to hypofibrinolysis.",

Dehydration of VII via the ortho-nitrophenylselenide to the 23-ene, followed by addition of (CF3)2CFI gave 3 beta-acetoxy-23R-iodo-25,26,26,26,27,27,27-heptafluoro-5 alpha-cholest-8(14)-en-15-one. Reductive deiodination with tributyltin hydride, followed by hydrolysis of the acetate gave VIII. 25,26,26,26,27,27,27-Heptafluorocholest-5-en-3 beta-ol (XXI) was prepared in eight steps in 31% overall yield from 3 alpha,6 alpha-diacetoxy-5 beta-cholanic acid (XIII). Compound XIII was reduced with borane-methyl sulfide to the corresponding 24-hydroxysteroid, which was converted to 3 alpha,6 alpha-diacetoxy-25,26,26,26,27,27,27-heptafluoro-5 beta-cholestane (XVIII) by reactions analogous to those developed for the preparation of VIII from VII. Conversion of XVIII via the 3 alpha,6 alpha-diol to the 3 alpha,6 alpha-ditosylate, followed by heating with potassium acetate in dimethylformamide and subsequent hydrolysis gave XXI. Full 1H and 13C NMR assignments are presented for VIII, XXI, and intermediates involved in their synthesis. 13C NMR assignments for 3 alpha,6 alpha-dihydroxy-5 beta-steroids have been corrected, and stereochemical assignments were established for the side-chain methylene protons of VIII, XXI, and most synthetic intermediates. Compound VIII lowered the levels of HMG-CoA reductase activity in CHO-K1 cells and in HepG2 cells with a potency comparable to that of 3 beta-hydroxy-5 alpha-cholest-8(14)-en-15-one (I). In contrast, 25,26,26,26,27,27,27-heptafluorocholest-5-en-3 beta-ol had little or no effect on reductase activity in CHO-K1 cells. These combined results indicate that metabolism of 3 beta-hydroxy-5 alpha-cholest-8(14)-en-15-one (I) to 26- and 25-oxygenated species is not required for the suppressive action of I on the levels of HMG-CoA reductase activity in CHO-K1 cells and HepG2 cells.",

In a double-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled design treatment with simvastatin (n = 8) for 36 weeks significantly reduced total cholesterol (6.7 +/- 0.3 vs 5.1 mmol.l-1 (p < 0.01)), LDL-cholesterol (4.4 +/- 0.3 vs 2.9 +/- 0.2 mmol.l-1 (p < 0.01)) and apolipoprotein B (1.05 +/- 0.04 vs 0.77 +/- 0.02 mmol.l-1 (p < 0.01)) levels as compared to placebo (n = 10).

Either nicotinic acid or cholestyramine resin was added to the regimen if serum cholesterol was not less than 5.5 mmol/l within 18 weeks. After dietary advice but before commencing pharmacotherapy for hyperlipidaemia, arterial stiffness was measured in the common carotid and common femoral arteries. These studies were repeated after 12 months on pharmacotherapy. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether arterial stiffness could be altered with total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowering. Over the 12 month interval, serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides fell significantly, whereas high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and body mass index (BMI) rose significantly. Mean supine blood pressure did not change significantly. Arterial stiffness in the common carotid artery decreased from 1.04 +/- 0.21 x 10(5) N/m2 to 0.63 +/- 0.06 x 10(5) N/m2 (T = -2.67, P < 0.01) over the interval. Stiffness of the common femoral artery decreased from 2.10 +/- 0.57 x 10(5) N/m2 to 0.83 +/- 0.15 x 10(5) N/m2 (T = -2.73, P < 0.01). The change in arterial stiffness was not directly related to changes in circulating lipids or supine blood pressure. Increase in BMI, however, correlated with change in arterial stiffness in the common femoral artery (Rs = 0.53, P < 0.05) but not in the common carotid artery. An increase in BMI was associated with a smaller decrease in common femoral arterial stiffness. Aggressive hypolipidaemic therapy was therefore associated with a favourable effect on arterial wall stiffness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "18": "Many GTP-binding proteins (GBPs) are modified by mevalonic acid (MVA)-dependent isoprenylation, carboxyl methylation or palmitoylation. The effects of inhibitors of these processes on insulin release were studied. Intact pancreatic islets were shown to synthesize and metabolize MVA and to prenylate several candidate proteins. Culture with lovastatin (to inhibit synthesis of endogenous MVA) caused the accumulation in the cytosol of low-M(r) GBPs (labelled by the [alpha-32P]GTP overlay technique), suggesting a disturbance of membrane association. Concomitantly, lovastatin pretreatment reduced glucose-induced insulin release by about 50%; co-provision of 100-200 microM MVA totally prevented this effect. Perillic acid, a purported inhibitor of the prenylation of small GBPs, also markedly reduced glucose-induced insulin secretion. Furthermore, both N-acetyl-S-trans,trans-farnesyl-L-cysteine (AFC), which inhibited the base-labile carboxyl methylation of GBPs in islets or in transformed beta-cells, and cerulenic acid, an inhibitor of protein palmitoylation, also reduced nutrient-induced secretion; an inactive analogue of AFC (which did not inhibit carboxyl methylation in islets) had no effect on secretion. In contrast with nutrients, the effects of agonists that induce secretion by directly activating distal components in signal transduction (such as a phorbol ester or mastoparan) were either unaffected or enhanced by lovastatin or AFC. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that post-translational modifications are required for one or more stimulatory GBPs to promote proximal step(s) in fuel-induced insulin secretion, whereas one or more inhibitory GBPs might reduce secretion at a more distal locus.",

The probable source was atheromatosis of the abdominal aorta. The toes became gangrenous, but surgical therapy was deferred because the patient was considered a high risk. With lovastatin therapy there was complete healing and except for transient cyanosis related to temporary cessation of therapy, there has been no recurrence for the past thirty months. The possible role of lovastatin in the conservative treatment of this disorder is discussed.", 
    "20": "The influence of two inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, simvastatin and pravastatin, on the level of urinary 6 beta-hydroxycortisol/17-hydroxycorticosteroids (6 beta-OHC/17-OHCS) ratio was determined in two groups of normolipidemic Caucasian subjects (n = 18 and n = 14, respectively). The 6 beta-OHC/17-OHCS ratio increased significantly after simvastatin administration (20 mg day-1 for 17 days) (P = 0.0125) whereas no modification was observed after pravastatin administration (20 mg day-1 during 17 days). As the level of 6 beta-OHC/17-OHCS ratio is a function of cytochrome P-450 3A activity, these results suggest that in Caucasian subjects, simvastatin but not pravastatin could be a weak inducer of cytochrome P-450 3A. This contrasting effect could be related to the major pharmacological differences existing between these two drugs.", 
    "21": "Lovastatin (monocolin K) is a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA-reductase. Its influence on the growth of a lovastatin sensitive strain of Rhodotorula rubra, the biosynthesis of ergosterol and the resistance to polyenic antibiotics was studied. It was shown that the lovastatin action on the strain depended on the inhibitor dose. In a concentration of 0.1 to 0.5 micrograms/ml lovastatin inhibited the yeast growth and ergosterol biosynthesis. Higher concentrations of the inhibitor in the medium led to the recovery of the sterol biosynthesis. It was also demonstrated that a decrease of the ergosterol level in the cells under the influence of lovastatin resulted in the development of resistance in the yeast to polyenic antibiotics such as nistatin and amphotericin B. Correlation between the ergosterol level in the yeast cells and their susceptibility to the polyenic antibiotics was observed.", 
    "22": "Intracellular cholesteryl ester (CE) biosynthesis is thought to play an important role in the secretion of apolipoprotein (apo) B from hepatocytes. We have reported that oleate rapidly increased apo B secretion by suppressing early intracellular degradation of nascent apo B in HepG2 cells. The aim of the present study is to determine whether the rapid stimulatory effect of oleate on apo B secretion is associated with CE biosynthesis. Oleate (0.4 mM) rapidly and strikingly increased triacylglycerol (TG) but not CE in the cells and the medium. Apo B was linearly secreted into the medium during 180 min and oleate doubled the rate of secretion. Fluvastatin, a newly synthesized 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, or 25-hydroxycholesterol did not alter the apo B secretion rate, although the former suppressed and the latter stimulated CE production in the cells. Pulse-chase studies revealed that neither fluvastatin or 25-hydroxycholesterol treatments affected apo B production or intracellular degradation of newly synthesized apo B. These results suggest that, at least in short-term incubation, the modulation of CE biosynthesis does not alter apo B kinetics in HepG2 cells. Therefore, we concluded that rapid stimulation of apo B secretion by oleate is not associated with CE biosynthesis.", 
    "23": "The effect of mevastatin and mevinolin on the fusion of L6 myoblasts was studied. Both compounds were present inhibitors of myoblast fusion at concentrations as low as 0.25 microM, but fusion was restored when the inhibitors were removed. Both compounds resulted in decreased binding of conA and WGA to cell surface oligosaccharides showing they were causing a reduction in N-linked cell surface glycoproteins. There was a reduction in creatine phosphokinase activities in the presence of both compounds showing that they were affecting biochemical differentiation. The presence of both compounds inhibited the incorporation of labeled mannose from GDP-mannose into lipid-sugar and N-linked glycoprotein, but the inhibition was reversed by addition of exogenous dolichol phosphate to the incorporation mixture. The main conclusion from these studies is that mevinolin and mevastatin are inhibiting myoblast fusion by affecting the synthesis of fusogenic cell surface N-linked glycoproteins probably by affecting the synthesis of dolichol phosphate containing oligosaccharides that are required as intermediates in N-linked glycoprotein biosynthesis.", 
    "24": "Conventional lipid-lowering agents displayed only limited efficacy in lowering total and LDL cholesterol and a high incidence of side effects. Pravastatin is a new potent cholesterol-lowering agent, which selectively inhibits hepatic HMG-CoA-reductase. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled Swiss multicenter study with determination of lipids and lipoprotein in a central laboratory, the efficacy and safety of 6 months' therapy with pravastatin was evaluated in 50 patients with mild hypercholesterolemia and additional coronary risk factors. Compared to baseline and after 26 weeks' therapy, pravastatin significantly reduced total cholesterol (pravastatin vs placebo, -17% vs +7%, p < 0.0001) and LDL cholesterol (-26 vs +2%, p < 0.0001). The total/HDL cholesterol ratio ( = \"atherogenic index\") was comparable in the two groups at baseline (5.9 +/- 1.1 vs 6.3 +/- 0.9), and was distinctly lowered by pravastatin but not placebo (-20 vs 0%, p < 0.0001). In 11 patients in whom the reduction of serum total cholesterol after 13 weeks' treatment with 20 mg pravastatin was still below target (on average -9.1%), doubling of the dose produced a further decrease of 4.3%. Serum HDL cholesterol and serum triglyceride levels did not change significantly during pravastatin treatment as compared to baseline and placebo. Pravastatin was well tolerated during the 26 weeks without relevant subjective side-effects. There were 5 dropouts during the study, 2 patients in the pravastatin group and 3 in the placebo group. These findings document that pravastatin, administered in a single daily dose of 20 to 40 mg, effectively lowers serum cholesterol and total-/HDL-cholesterol improving action and is well tolerated.", 
    "25": "We present the results of a multicentre, placebo-controlled, randomized double-blind comparison of the treatment of primary hypercholesterolaemia with pravastatin (Pravachol), an HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor. The study was conducted in both general practice and hospital settings. Two hundred and eighty-six patients who despite oral and written dietary instructions and advice on healthy living had elevated total serum cholesterol levels of between six and eight mmol/l were randomized to treatment with either parvastatin (Pravachol) or placebo. The study showed a significant reduction in both total serum cholesterol (of 16%) and serum LDL-cholesterol among those treated with pravastatin (Pravachol), as well as a small increase tin serum HDL-cholesterol of six percent. Advice on diet and healthy living resulted in a reduction of serum cholesterol of only 1.5%. There were no important differences between those treated from the hospital and those treated in general practice. The incidence of side-effects was low and comparable to placebo levels, and only two percent of the pravastatin (Pravachol) treated patients had to have the treatment stopped. All side-effects were reversible. No side-effects relating to the central nervous system were registered, and no elevations of serum creatinine phosphokinase were observed amongst the pravastatin treated patients, presumably because of the drug's selective inhibitory effect on cholesterol synthesis in the liver.", 
    "26": "Two girls with familial hypercholesterolemia were treated for 7 years by plasma exchanges (PE) or LDL-apheresis (LA). We compared different methods of treatment; PE with or without reuse of the plasma separator, LA of varying frequency, and LA with or without oral administration of simvastatin. We assessed the long-term results by measuring the blood levels of the biochemical parameters before sessions, and determined the effectiveness of each session by the percentage of decrease in the blood levels between the beginning and the end of the sessions. LA led to a more selective treatment (lowering of LDL cholesterol and maintenance of HDL cholesterol), but the blood levels of total cholesterol before sessions were the same as those obtained by PE. IgG and haemoglobin levels decreased little with LA. The rhythm of one session a week gave better results in LA. Although reuse of the plasma separator represents a financial saving it produced poorer results. The oral administration of simvastatin improved the results of LA.", 
    "27": "Pravastatin is an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor used in the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia. The steady state pharmacokinetics of pravastatin (20 mg) and digoxin (0.2 mg) were evaluated in 18 healthy male subjects following the administration of each drug alone or in combination for 9 days. Serum and urine were collected for up to 48 h after the ninth dose in this open, randomized 3-way crossover study. Digoxin concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay, and pravastatin and its metabolites. SQ 31,906 and SQ 31,945 were measured by GC-MS. Digoxin and pravastatin pharmacokinetics were unchanged following combined administration. Combination therapy with pravastatin and digoxin is unlikely to expose patients to additional risk compared with pravastatin alone.", 
    "28": "Steroid hormone production within the gonads and adrenals requires a continuous supply of cholesterol derived from de novo synthesis within the gland and from uptake of circulating plasma lipoproteins. Steroid hormone secretion was prospectively studied over 24 months in 64 hypercholesterolemic subjects (group I, aged 52 +/- 1 years [mean +/- SEM], 61% male) participating in a randomized double-blind clinical trial of pravastatin (20 to 80 mg daily), a new 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, compared with patients taking cholestyramine or other lipid-lowering drugs (group II). Attempts were made in both groups to maintain serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels between the 25th and 50th percentile for age and gender. At 24 months, serum LDL-C level decreased by 42% +/- 3% in group I and 44% +/- 1% in group II (P < .001 v baseline, NS between groups). Basal secretion of cortisol, aldosterone, and dehydroepiandrostenedione sulfate (DHEA-S) was maintained throughout the study. However, the serum DHEA-S secretory response to Cortrosyn (Organon, West Orange, NJ) diminished in both treatment groups at 6 and 12 months (P < .05). In men, basal serum testosterone levels and the testosterone response to human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) did not change. There was some diminution of sperm motility noted in both treatment groups at 6 and 12 months in the subset of men undergoing semen analysis (n = 14, P < .05). In conclusion, pravastatin had no significant effect on steroid metabolism. Changes noted in DHEA-S were not specific for pravastatin, suggesting that this impairment is related to lipid-lowering effects.", 
    "29": "Lovastatin (LS) is a potent HMG-CoA inhibitor used in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. In humans it can cause a severe, necrotizing myopathy with myoglobinuria and renal failure. To investigate the pathogenesis of LS-induced myopathy we studied the effects of LS on rat skeletal muscle. Lewis rats were gavage-fed 1 mg/g body weight/day of LS. Control rats received carboxymethylcellulose-based suspension by gavage. Gastrocnemius and soleus, fast and slow twitch muscles respectively, were studied by light and electron microscopy. By day 10 LS-treated rats became severely weak. Gastrocnemius was severely affected with degeneration of membranous organelles and microvacuole formation, but soleus was spared. Eventually, 20-50% of the gastrocnemius but none of the soleus fibers became necrotic. Non-necrotic fibers showed no increases of acid phosphatase, indicating that autophagy was not excited. We conclude that LS causes muscle injury by inducing degeneration of membranous organelles, and fast twitch muscle fibers are selectively vulnerable to LS myopathy.", 
    "30": "Cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the bile acid biosynthetic pathway, is thought to be regulated by hydrophobic bile acids through negative feedback control. The role of cholesterol in the regulation of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase is more controversial, in part because of incomplete understanding of the relationship between the pathways of cholesterol synthesis and degradation. The main objective of this study was to define the interaction between these two pathways in an experimental model in which the supply of newly synthesized cholesterol was interrupted by sustained infusion of mevinolin (lovastatin), an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) or accelerated by a continuous infusion of mevalonate, a cholesterol precursor. The study was carried out in rats subjected to short-term bile fistula. In one set of experiments, rats were treated postoperatively with mevinolin (5 mg/kg loading dose followed by 2 mg/kg/hr infusion), mevalonate (180 mumol/hr infusion) or both for up to 96 hr. In a separate set of experiments, rats were infused intraduodenally with taurocholate (36 mumol/100 gm/hr for up to 96 hr). We determined cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase- and HMG-CoA reductase specific activities at those time intervals, whereas bile acid synthesis rates were determined throughout the study. Compared with rats not subjected to surgery, rats with short-term biliary diversion had increases in cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity of 259% and 827% at 48 and 96 hr, respectively. The increase in bile acid biosynthesis was less pronounced. Continuous infusion of mevinolin completely prevented increases in cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase specific activity and bile acid biosynthesis at both time intervals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "31": "To evaluate the effect of pravastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, on sleep, the drug or a placebo was administered to 5 healthy adults for 16 days by the double-blind method. Pravastatin caused no changes in sleep parameters. This indicates that it had no effect on human sleep for the following possible reasons: Being hydrophilic, the drug does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier. It does not inhibit prostaglandin D2 synthase, a possible sleep-inducing substance. It was thought that a decrease in the total cholesterol level in the blood has no effect on sleep in healthy adults.", 
    "32": "Treatment with a low dose (0.5 microgram/ml) of tunicamycin (an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation) blocked the cell cycle progression of both normal Balb/c 3T3 cells (A31) and their SV40-transformed derivatives (SVA31) specifically in early G1 (0-3 h after mitosis). Upon release after an 8-h treatment the A31 cells returned to the cell cycle via a 9-h recovery phase, indicating that they were arrested in G0. The A31 cells were fully viable after this treatment. In contrast, the postmitotic SVA31 cells, which were unable to arrest in G0, did not divide after the removal of tunicamycin. Instead, these cells died but this did not occur until 22-34 h after release from the treatment. SVA31 cells that had passed the postmitotic phase of G1 survived during the parental generation and divided normally. However, a large portion of these cells died during the next cycle, and in total during a 48-h period approximately 50% of the cells were killed as a consequence of an 8-h exposure to tunicamycin. In contrast, treatment with inhibitors of protein synthesis and HMG CoA reductase activity as well as inhibitors of modification of N-linked oligosaccharide chains did not result in cell death.", 
    "33": "Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a refractory liver disease for which no medical treatment has been established. The investigators administered 20 mg/day of pravastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, to 2 PBC patients with hypercholesterolemia (1010 and 306 mg/dl) for 3 years and 10 months in order to decrease the blood concentration of bile acids and prevent adverse effects on the hepatocellular membrane. The drug markedly decreased not only cholesterol levels but also total bile acid levels, producing particularly pronounced decreases in cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid. Histologically, progression was inhibited in one patient, whereas improvement was seen in the other. Bile duct enzymes and other biochemical parameters showed improvement in both cases. General pruritus and blepharal and palmar xanthoma also improved. These findings suggest that pravastatin may be useful in the treatment of PBC associated with hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "34": "Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A-(HMGCoA) reductase ameliorate glomerular pathology and renal dysfunction in different models of glomerular disease. This effect has generally been attributed to a decrease in the circulating levels of cholesterol. Focal or diffuse mesangial cell proliferation is a common feature of glomerular pathology. There is now evidence from studies in vitro and in vivo that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is an important mediator of glomerular hypercellularity. The activity of HMGCoA reductase has previously been shown to be a requirement for cell growth. In the present study, we examined the effect of simvastatin, and HMGCoA reductase inhibitor, on PDGF-induced DNA synthesis and PDGF B chain gene expression in human glomerular mesangial cells. In addition, we investigated the effect of simvastatin on phospholipase C (PLC) and protein kinase C (PKC) activation stimulated by PDGF. We demonstrate that treatment of the cells with simvastatin completely inhibits PDGF-induced DNA synthesis. This inhibition is reversed by mevalonate but not by cholesterol or farnesol, two major metabolites of the mevalonate pathway. On the other hand inhibition of HMGCoA reductase does not influence PDGF-induced activation of PLC and PKC, or PDGF B chain gene expression. These data suggest that simvastatin acts at a late step in the PDGF mitogenic pathway without interfering with other early cellular responses elicited by this growth factor. These studies also raise the possibility that the ameliorative effect of HMGCoA reductase inhibitors on glomerular pathology may be mediated, at least in part, by a direct cellular effect.", 
    "35": "The binding of fluvastatin, an inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, to plasma proteins and red blood cells of rat, dog, and human in vitro was determined by ultrafiltration. Additionally, the stereospecificity of fluvastatin binding to proteins and the potential interaction between fluvastatin and the highly protein bound drugs warfarin, salicylic acid, and glyburide were investigated. Only a small fraction of fluvastatin in blood was taken up by the blood cells, amounting to 19-33% in the rat and < or = 15% in dog and humans. The plasma:blood fluvastatin ratio in these species at 37 degrees C was > or = 1.4. In human blood, this ratio was temperature independent. In the plasma concentration range 25-50,000 ng/mL, fluvastatin was > or = 98% bound to proteins. The binding was concentration dependent in the rat, but not in the dog and human. Both enantiomers of fluvastatin were > 99% bound in normal human plasma, the binding of each being unaffected by the presence of the other. A major fluvastatin-binding protein in human plasma was albumin, whereas binding to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein was relatively weak and concentration dependent. At therapeutic concentrations in normal human plasma, the protein binding of fluvastatin (0.1 microgram/mL) was unaffected by warfarin (1-10 micrograms/mL), salicylic acid (50-150 micrograms/mL), and glyburide (0.1-1 micrograms/mL). Similarly, fluvastatin had no influence on the binding of these compounds. In diluted human albumin solution (29 microM), bound fluvastatin was displaced by all three co-solutes tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Cell extracts from NPC and NPD fibroblasts cultured in lipoprotein-deficient medium exhibited activities of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase that were two-fold greater than in normal cells. Addition of serum resulted in only a 15% decrease in HMG-CoA reductase activity within 6 h in these cells, compared with a decrease of 80% in normal fibroblasts. The initial rate of return to maximal values for the first 6 h after removal of serum was similar in all three cell types; thereafter, the rate was faster in the mutant fibroblasts. Binding and internalization of 125I-labeled low density lipoprotein (LDL) was not decreased within 12 h of incubation of NPC fibroblasts with serum, while a decrease of 50% was observed for both NPD and normal fibroblasts over this time period. Northern blot analysis also indicated a slower decrease in steady-state LDL receptor mRNA in NPC relative to normal and NPD cells. In all three cell types, inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase with mevinolin had no effect on serum-stimulated cholesterol esterification, while inhibition of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase with Sandoz 58-035 did not influence HMG-CoA reductase activity, indicating that defects in these regulatory mechanisms are independent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In 9 other patients with comparable baseline lipid values, cholestyramine plus pravastatin (40 mg daily) reduced LDL cholesterol to a comparable extent after 2 years (-43%, baseline 7.71 +/- 0.44 mM) and increased HDL cholesterol by 18% (baseline 1.06 +/- 0.11 mM). The combination with lovastatin led to a significant reduction in triglycerides level by 25% (baseline 1.63 +/- 0.24 mM), whereas the combination with pravastatin did not change triglycerides level (baseline 1.39 +/- 0.15 mM).

Mutant 2-2, which exhibits a cholesterol transport defect indistinguishable from the Niemann-Pick C phenotype, shows impaired but not absent LDL-mediated suppression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase activity. In parental cells, LDL suppression of HMG-CoA reductase is modulated by two mechanisms, decreased gene transcription and accelerated protein turnover. Using the chimeric protein HMGal as a reporter protein for LDL-mediated turnover and Northern blot analysis to monitor HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels, we have dissected the contributions of these two regulatory responses to LDL-mediated suppression of HMG-CoA reductase activity. Kinetic modeling using the kinlsq program showed the following. Mutant 2-2 exhibits normal LDL-mediated acceleration of HMGal degradation, coupled with relatively abnormal regulation of mRNA. This suggests that the LDL-cholesterol signaling pathway to the nucleus is defective relative to the signal that results in HMG-CoA reductase turnover. In addition, LDL-mediated acceleration of HMGal turnover occurs well before LDL stimulation of cholesterol esterification in mutant 2-2, whereas these events occur synchronously in the parental cell line. This suggests that more than one pathway or mechanism exists for LDL-cholesterol signaling to the endoplasmic reticulum.",

    "57": "Isoprenylated proteins function in the processes of signal transduction and membrane vesicle trafficking. To investigate the role of isoprenylated proteins in secretagogue-stimulated epithelial ion transport, we studied the effects of lovastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, on adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP)- and Ca(2+)-stimulated Cl- secretion by monolayers of T84 colonic epithelial cells. Lovastatin reduces protein isoprenylation in many cell types. In T84 cells, lovastatin reversibly inhibits forskolin-stimulated equivalent short-circuit current (I(sc)eq) by 50% after 2 days of treatment. The concentration of lovastatin resulting in half-maximal effects on forskolin-stimulated I(sc)eq is consistent with inhibition of protein isoprenylation, and lovastatin effects on forskolin-stimulated I(sc)eq are not associated with inhibition of cholesterol or glycoprotein biosynthesis. Lovastatin blocks N6,2'-O-dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate- and ionomycin-stimulated Isc, suggesting that it inhibits a process beyond the stimulation of cAMP and Ca2+ second-messenger systems. In monolayers in which the basolateral membrane has been permeabilized with nystatin, lovastatin inhibits cAMP activation of a diphenylamine-2-carboxylate-sensitive, apical membrane Cl- conductance. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that an isoprenylated protein is involved in the regulation of a secretagogue-activated apical membrane Cl- conductance in T84 cells.", 
    "58": "Isoprene is a normal constituent of human breath and may be derived from the cholesterol synthetic pathway. Acute and chronic lovastatin and a cholesterol-supplemented diet were used to determine whether a mechanistic link exists between isoprene and cholesterol biosynthesis in vivo in humans. The acute effects of lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of the rate-limiting step of cholesterol biosynthesis, on breath isoprene excretion was determined by administering a single 20, 40 or 80 mg dose of this drug to five healthy male subjects at 8 p.m. and measuring their breath isoprene levels every 4 h for one 24 h cycle before and after treatment. When compared to the baseline cycle, all three doses of lovastatin significantly reduced breath isoprene levels at 6 and 10 h post-drug treatment. Chronic lovastatin therapy (40 mg b.i.d. for 6 wk) reduced 6 a.m. breath isoprene levels (time of maximum baseline value) by 27 +/- 9% (SEM) and cholesterol synthesis measured in freshly isolated mononuclear leukocytes (ML) by 12 +/- 6%. A cholesterol-supplemented diet (1070 mg, total) ingested for 6 wk reduced breath isoprene excretion and ML sterol synthesis by 16 +/- 5 and 19 +/- 4%, respectively. The parallel decreases in isoprene excretion and cholesterol synthesis caused by these pharmacologic and dietary means suggest that breath isoprene is derived from the cholesterol synthesis pathway.", 
    "59": "We report on a 17-year-old female patient with hyperlipidaemia, apoE2 homozygosity and characteristic dermatological features of type-III hyperlipoproteinaemia (HLP III). In contrast to the \"classical\" lipoprotein phenotype, with hypercholesterolaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia, in our case an elevated LDL cholesterol level was also present. To the best of our knowledge, this is the eleventh report in the literature of HLP III onset in a child or an adolescent. Treatment with several antilipidaemic drugs resulted only in a reduction of the serum triglyceride concentration, and not in an improvement of the hypercholesterolaemia or the elevated LDL cholesterol level. This therapeutic response was explained with reference to an uncommon association of the apoE2 homozygosity with the homo- or heterozygote state of familial hypercholesterolaemia. Another explanation for this phenomenon is the possible combination of the apoE2 homozygosity with a familial apolipoprotein-B 100 defect that has only recently come to light.", 
    "60": "We measured biliary and fecal sterol outputs in 12 human subjects on a metabolic ward in four randomly allocated, 6-7 wk periods: (a) lovastatin (40 mg b.i.d.) + low cholesterol diet (mean 246 mg/d), (b) lovastatin + high cholesterol diet (mean 1,071 mg/d), (c) low cholesterol diet alone, (d) high cholesterol diet alone. In addition to lowering serum LDL cholesterol, lovastatin significantly lowered biliary secretion of cholesterol, fecal output of endogenous neutral sterols, cholesterol balance, and systemic cholesterol input (the sum of cholesterol synthesis and absorbed dietary cholesterol). The high cholesterol diet significantly lowered cholesterol balance, but significantly increased systemic cholesterol input and fecal output of acidic sterols. There was no significant interaction between lovastatin and dietary cholesterol for any parameter measured. Judging from these data, the primary action of lovastatin is to lower cholesterol synthesis and systemic cholesterol input, the main compensatory response being reduced biliary cholesterol secretion. Conversely, increased dietary cholesterol appears to increase systemic cholesterol input, the major compensatory response being increased bile acid synthesis. There appears to be no interaction between these two perturbations of systemic cholesterol input.", 
    "61": "Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) is a dominantly inherited hyperlipidemia that occurs in at least 1% of the adult population and is responsible for 10% of premature coronary artery disease. In families referred for evaluation because of primary hyperlipidemia in a child, FCHL is expressed three times more commonly than familial hypercholesterolemia and half of the siblings are affected. Several metabolic defects apparently are associated with the FCHL phenotype. Most commonly, excess production of very low density lipoprotein apolipoprotein B can be demonstrated. In other families, reduced lipoprotein lipase activity is associated. One allele at a locus influencing apolipoprotein B levels predicts FCHL in a large proportion of families ascertained through affected children. Whether this allele is responsible for the excess of very low density lipoprotein apolipoprotein B detected in metabolic studies has not been elucidated. Management of FCHL in children begins with dietary modification. A bile acid sequestrant may be considered as well if diet cannot reduce the plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level to less than 4.13 mmol/L (160 mg/dl) after the age of 10 years. Although the hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors are not currently recommended for children younger than 19 years of age, we speculate that they will be increasingly utilized for the management of FCHL in teenage boys who continue to have low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels greater than 4.13 mmol/L (160 mg/dl) after dietary modification.", 
    "62": "Cholesterol, fatty acid, and sphingolipid synthesis are required for barrier homeostasis, as demonstrated by studies where synthesis of these species is stimulated in parallel with barrier repair. Moreover, blockade of synthesis of these lipids with inhibitors of two of the rate-limiting enzymes, HMGCoA reductase (lovastatin, fluvastatin) and serine palmitoyl transferase (beta-chloroalanine), alters the kinetics of barrier repair. Whereas these studies demonstrated a requirement for these lipids individually, we asked here whether these lipids are required in either an additive or cooperative fashion. We applied each class of inhibitor alone or the two classes of inhibitors together to acetone-treated skin, or each class separately to essential fatty acid deficient murine skin. When fluvastatin or beta-chloroalanine was applied individually to acetone-treated skin, each caused a delay in the early or late stages of barrier recovery, respectively (assessed as transepidermal water loss). However, when applied together they caused no further worsening at the early time point and a paradoxical improvement at the later time points. This improvement correlated with an accelerated return of sphingolipids, which was perhaps due to a global stimulation of lipid synthesis induced by HMGCoA reductase inhibitors. In essential fatty acid deficient animals, inhibition of HMGCoA reductase caused drastic worsening of both clinical appearance and barrier function, but beta-chloroalanine caused a paradoxical improvement, which correlated with a significant reduction in epidermal sphingolipids. These results are consistent with a requirement for both cholesterol and sphingolipids for barrier homeostasis, and also with the suggestion that both of these lipids must be present (with free fatty acids) for optimal barrier function.",

    "64": "Two hundred and sixty six primary hypercholesterolemics, 65 to 80 years of age, after ingesting a standard diet for four weeks, received 10mg of pravastatin for 12 weeks.", 
    "65": "Average reductions of 24% or more were observed for TC and LDL-C, and more than 60% of those reductions were considered good or excellent (above 20%). Increases in HDL-C (6.6%) and the reduction of TG (21.2%) were significant. Patients 65 to 70 years old compared to patients 71 to 80 years old did not show significant response differences, however, the 71 to 80 year old patients had smaller reductions in TC and LDL-C but greater increases in HDL-C. The drug was very well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse events of only 10.5%, none of which resulted in the discontinuation of drug administration. There were significant increases in hepatic enzymes (SGOT and SGTP), however the variations did not have clinical significance. For CK changes were not significant.", 
    "66": "Primary hypercholesterolemic elderly seem to respond to pravastatin in a similar way as middle age patients. The effects on the lipid fractions are significant, adverse effects are rare and the drug is very well tolerated. Thus it should be considered a first line hypolipidemic drug.", 
    "67": "Cultured fibroblasts from patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C) are characterized by the lysosomal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and the inability of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to stimulate cholesterol esterification, in addition to impaired LDL-mediated down-regulation of LDL receptor activity and cellular cholesterol synthesis. Although a defect in the transport of cholesterol from lysosomes to other intracellular membrane sites has been suggested, it is unclear how cells regulate the levels of cellular sterols and whether their membrane cholesterol requirements are satisfied or not. We studied the esterification of exogenously added cholesterol, total levels of cellular cholesterol and cholesteryl ester, cholesterol synthesis from a two-carbon precursor, and sensitivities to potential inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis in proliferating NP-C cells. We observed the following: (a) esterification of [3H]cholesterol was decreased but the total amount of cellular cholesteryl ester was not decreased; (b) synthesis of cholesterol from [3H]acetate was increased; and (c) cells were hypersensitive to cholecalciferol, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, and were resistant to filipin, which binds to membrane sterols and presumably damages the membrane. The results indicate that NP-C cells depend on the cellular cholesterol synthetic pathway for their proliferation, but the plasma membrane sterols are presumably decreased. The altered sensitivities to potential inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis should be a useful marker for diagnosis and genetic studies.", 
    "68": "We studied 56 patients affected by primary hypercholesterolemia treated with placebo for 1 month and with simvastatin (20 mg/day) or pravastatin (20 mg/day) for 6 months during a double-blind clinical trial. At 1-month intervals we determined the following parameters in the serum: total and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein A-1 and B. At the same time intervals we also determined the cholesterol and phospholipid concentration, the Na+/K+ ATPase activity, and the fluidity of erythrocyte membranes. Our results demonstrated the following modifications in the erythrocyte membranes during simvastatin and pravastatin treatments: (1) an initial increase in cholesterol concentration and in cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio, with a significant decrease only after 4 months; (2) a similar behavior of membrane fluidity, with an initial decrease and an elevation after 4 months; (3) an increase in the Na+/K+ ATPase activity only after 4 months. We hypothesize that simvastatin and pravastatin not only inhibit the hepatic synthesis of cholesterol, but also modify the cholesterol exchange between plasma and the erythrocyte membrane.", 
    "69": "The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor class of cholesterol-lowering agents reduces very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and low density lipoproteins (LDL) and slightly increases high density lipoproteins (HDL). However, the effects of these agents on subclasses within the LDL and HDL fractions are not well understood. We have employed an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, pravastatin, to determine if LDL subclass phenotypes, as determined by gradient gel electrophoresis, and HDL particles containing both apolipoprotein (apo) A-I and A-II, Lp(AI w AII), and those containing apo A-I but not A-II, Lp(AI w/o AII) are affected by pravastatin (10 mg daily). Twenty-four subjects with LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) > 160 mg/dl, triglyceride (TG) < 350 mg/dl and no recent myocardial infarction or secondary causes of hypercholesterolemia were enrolled. Compared with an age- and sex-matched normolipidemic reference group (controls), the hypercholesterolemic subjects had reduced levels of Lp(AI w/o AII) and increased levels of Lp(AI w AII) at baseline. In addition, both of their HDL subpopulations had significantly more small (7.0-8.2 nm) particles (P < 0.02 and 0.0001) but significantly fewer large (9.2-11.2 nm) particles (P < 0.002 and 0.0001). Pravastatin induced statistically significant (P < 0.001) reductions in plasma total C (15%), LDL-C (18%), and apo B (16%). While apo A-I and A-II levels increased 5% (P < 0.001) and 6% (P < 0.05), respectively, concentration, composition, and size abnormalities in Lp(AI w AII) and Lp(AI w/o AII) persisted. Lp(a), apo E and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) levels also did not change. Although changes in LDL subclass phenotypes were observed, all changes involved the intermediate phenotype, and no significant changes in LDL peak particle diameter were seen in either group. Interrelationships between CETP, LDL subclass phenotypes and HDL subpopulations were also seen.", 
    "70": "Although pravastatin decreased plasma apo B and LDL lipid concentrations, no major changes were seen in LDL subclass phenotypes or HDL subpopulations even in the presence of abnormalities associated with arteriosclerosis. Similarly, CETP, which is believed to play a role in HDL and LDL particle size distribution, did not change with pravastatin treatment. Further research is needed to determine the pathophysiological basis of abnormal HDL and LDL subclasses in hypercholesterolemia and explore methods of rectifying the abnormalities.", 
    "71": "Simvastatin and pravastatin are both competitive inhibitors of the rate limiting enzyme for cholesterol biosynthesis (HMG CoA) reductase, but data from individual clinical trials suggest significant differences in potency for cholesterol reduction between the two drugs.", 
    "72": "To assess any differences in efficacy and safety between simvastatin and pravastatin in a direct, comparative study.", 
    "73": "A double-blind, double-dummy, randomised study design was used, involving 48 patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia. Following a 6 week placebo baseline period, patients were randomly allocated to treatment with either simvastatin or pravastatin, commencing at a dose of 10 mg daily. The dose levels were titrated up to the recommended maximum effective dose of 40 mg daily at 6 weekly intervals if LDL cholesterol levels remained > or = 3.4 mmol/L. After 18 weeks of therapy, all patients were transferred to simvastatin therapy for a further 6 weeks, continuing at their week 18 dose level. Patients complied with a standard lipid lowering diet (containing < 30% of energy as total fat) throughout the study period.", 
    "74": "Over the 18 week direct comparison of the two drugs, there was a significant difference (p < 0.001) in response between simvastatin and pravastatin for reduction in levels of total cholesterol (32% vs 21% respectively), LDL cholesterol (38% vs 27%) and apolipoprotein B levels (34% vs 23%). No significant difference in drug effect was seen for the small reduction in levels of apolipoprotein AI (5% vs 6% respectively), nor for the increased levels of apolipoprotein AII (14% vs 11%) and HDL cholesterol (11% vs 7%). Lp(a) levels remained unchanged. When pravastatin was replaced with simvastatin for the final 6 weeks of the study in the 23 patients initially randomised to pravastatin, there were further reductions (p < 0.01) in total and LDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B. These results establish the advantage of simvastatin over pravastatin in terms of efficacy, for the treatment of primary hypercholesterolaemia.", 
    "75": "Ten non insulin-dependent diabetics in satisfactory metabolic control but with high cholesterol levels were treated with simvastatin. A significant reduction of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol was obtained together with an increase in HDL-cholesterol, thus documenting the efficacy of this agent.", 
    "76": "Single cardiovascular risk factor intervention is probably not sufficient to prevent atherosclerosis progression. There is a lack of data on concomitant use of hypocholesterolemic agents and antihypertensive drugs with respect to possible interactions and adverse experiences. We studied 293 patients (below 65 years of age) under treatment with either lisinopril (n = 144) or nifedipine (n = 149) for mild to moderate hypertension for 10 weeks, and with serum cholesterol above 6.5 mmol/L, who were randomized to either lovastatin 20 mg every day or placebo in a double-blind, double-dummy design for 6 weeks. Lovastatin effectively lowered cholesterol by 16% and 15% in the lisinopril and nifedipine group respectively (P < .01 compared to placebo for both groups) without any negative impact on the antihypertensive efficacy of either lisinopril or nifedipine. The drugs in combination were well tolerated and did not affect the well-being of the patients, and did not cause any more adverse effects than the antihypertensive agents alone. Liver enzymes increased slightly during lovastatin therapy, while no case of myopathy was reported. Combined therapy with lovastatin and antihypertensive therapy can be safely undertaken.", 
    "77": "Within the framework of clinical tests of LIPOSTAT (pravastatin tablets 20 mg Bristol Meyers-Squibb Co.) this hypolipidaemic preparation was administered to 28 patients with different types of hyperlipoproteinaemias, mainly of type IIa. Administration for a period of four weeks--20 mg in the evening--had a significant effect on several basic indicators of the lipid metabolism. The total plasma cholesterol level declined by 20%, the apolipoprotein B level by 11%, the HDL cholesterol level rose by 38% and the triacylglycerol level declined by 18%. During administration the serum levels of aminotransferases, creatine kinase and alkaline phosphatase did not increase. No adverse side-effects were observed which called for discontinuation of treatment. Pravastatin is according to the authors' experience and the results of others an effective hypolipidaemic agent, suitable for the majority of patients with hyperlipoproteinaemias, in particular those with elevated plasma cholesterol levels.", 
    "78": "The effect of the combination of low-dose lovastatin and low-dose colestipol was studied among 57 subjects with moderate to severe primary hypercholesterolaemia (total cholesterol > or = 7.0 mmol l-1). Following an 8-week dietary phase, participants were randomized to treatment with 20 mg of lovastatin combined with 5 g or with 10 g of colestipol, or to matching placebo. Baseline total cholesterol was 7.7 +/- 0.9 mmol l-1 after dietary stabilization. Total cholesterol levels were reduced to 5.6 +/- 0.7 mmol l-1 and 5.8 +/- 0.7 mmol l-1 after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment in the lovastatin 5 g-1 colestipol group, and 74% of the subjects achieved the goal of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels of > or = 4.0 mmol l-1. Among the lovastatin 10 g-1 colestipol group, total cholesterol was reduced to 5.4 +/- 0.5 mmol l-1 and 5.5 +/- 0.9 mmol l-1 following 4 and 8 weeks, and 80% of subjects achieved the LDL cholesterol goal. No change was seen in the placebo group. Thus, low-dose combination therapy with lovastatin and colestipol, in conjunction with dietary treatment, is effective in moderate to severe primary hypercholesterolaemia, and is well tolerated.", 
    "79": "Fifty nine cases with hyperlipidemia were divided randomly into two groups. In group I, each patient took simvastatin 10-40mg/day (mean 17.9mg/day). In group 2, each patient took gemfibrozil 1200mg/day. After treatment with simvastatin, in comparing with baseline values, serum level of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) triglyceride (TG), apolipoprotein B (ApoB), and TC/HDL-C (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) reduced by 34.6% (P < 0.001), 45.4% (P < 0.001), 22.1% (P < 0.01), 21.1% (P < 0.001), and 39.4% (P < 0.001) respectively, and HDL-C, apolipoprotein A-I(Apo A-I) and Apo A-I/Apo B elevated by 14.2%, 21.9% and 64.5% respectively. For lowering TC, LDL-C, Apo B and elevating Apo A-I/Apo B, Simvastatin was better than gemfibrozil (P < 0.01-0.001). However, for lowering TG, gemfibrozil was better than simvastatin (P < 0.001). As for increasing HDL-C and Apo A-I, no significant differences were found between the two groups. No significant side effects were found in all patients but one who developed hypersensitive eruption after gemfibrozil taken, and he was excluded from the trial.", 
    "80": "The permeability barrier is mediated by a mixture of ceramides, sterols, and free fatty acids arranged as extracellular lamellar bilayers in the stratum corneum. Whereas prior studies have shown that cholesterol and ceramides are required for normal barrier function, definitive evidence for the importance of nonessential fatty acids is not available. To determine whether epidermal fatty acid synthesis also is required for barrier homeostasis, we applied 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furancarboxylic acid (TOFA), an inhibitor of acetyl CoA carboxylase, after disruption of the barrier by acetone or tape stripping. TOFA inhibits epidermal fatty acid by approximately 50% and significantly delays barrier recovery. Moreover, coadministration of palmitate with TOFA normalizes barrier recovery, indicating that the delay is due to a deficiency in bulk fatty acids. Furthermore, TOFA treatment also delays the return of lipids to the stratum corneum and results in abnormalities in the structure of lamellar bodies, the organelle which delivers lipid to the stratum corneum. In addition, the organization of secreted lamellar body material into lamellar bilayers within the stratum corneum interstices is disrupted by TOFA treatment. Finally, these abnormalities in lamellar body and stratum corneum membrane structure are corrected by coapplication of palmitate with TOFA. These results demonstrate a requirement for bulk fatty acids in barrier homeostasis. Thus, inhibiting the epidermal synthesis of any of the three key lipids that form the extracellular, lipid-enriched membranes of the stratum corneum results in an impairment in barrier homeostasis.", 
    "81": "In 20 men with hypercholesterolaemia or mixed hyperlipaemia the effect was evaluated of treatment with Lovastatin and Colestipol on lipoproteins. Administration of the drugs in combination or alone decreased significantly the concentrations of total cholesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol (LDL-chol), and apolipoprotein B (apo B). The combination of Lovastatin in dose of 40 mg with Colestipol in dose of 10 g decreased more favourably the concentrations of TC (34.7%), LDL-chol (44.3%), and apo B (22.4%) than administration of each of the drugs alone in higher doses i.e. Lovastatin 80 mg (TC--26.8%, LDL-chol--31.8%, apo B--16.9%) or Colestipol 20 g (TC -20.0%, LDL-chol-26.3%, apo B-10.8%). The treatment with Lovastatin and Colestipol failed to change significantly the concentrations of triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and AI and AII apolipoproteins. The combined therapy was better tolerated than monotherapy.", 
    "82": "In a 4.5-month-old boy presenting with marked muscular hypotonia in the neonatal period, hepatomegaly, cardiac hypertrophy, recurrent hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and secondary carnitine deficiency, there was a considerable urinary excretion of 3-methylglutaconic and 3-methylglutaric acid. Estimation of 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase and initial enzymatic steps of cholesterol biosynthesis in cultured fibroblasts and in different tissues postmortem revealed no enzyme deficiency. Analyses of the respiratory chain in postmortem tissues demonstrated severe impairment of complex I (NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase) and complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) activities in skeletal muscle and reduced complex IV activity in heart.", 
    "83": "This study was undertaken to determine if long-term oral administration of lovastatin (50 mg/kg per day) or fenofibrate (200 mg/kg per day) was affecting ubiquinone levels in the heart and the liver of cardiomyopathic hamsters. After 23 weeks of treatment, ubiquinone concentrations (CoQ9 + CoQ10) and ubiquinone ratio (CoQ10/CoQ9) were determined in the heart and in the liver. Our results indicate that lovastatin significantly decreased ubiquinone concentrations in the heart (-33%, P < 0.01) but not in the liver (-23%, NS) when compared to controls, whereas fenofibrate did not alter these parameters. Ubiquinone homologues were not equally decreased during lovastatin treatment: the ratio between CoQ10 and CoQ9 was significantly lowered in the heart (-33%, P < 0.001) and in the liver (-75%, P < 0.001) of lovastatin-treated animals. These results suggest that 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibition (HMG-CoARI) associated with lovastatin treatment in cardiomyopathic hamsters is more marked in the liver than in the heart, while ubiquinone concentrations are more decreased in cardiac than in hepatic tissues. Our data also showed that fenofibrate had no effect on ubiquinone levels.", 
    "84": "Caco-2 cells grown on membrane filters were used as a model to study the effects of NB-598, an inhibitor of squalene epoxidase, on cholesterol absorption from the intestinal epithelia. NB-598 (10 microM) inhibited the synthesis of sterol and sterol ester from [14C]acetate without affecting the synthesis of other lipids such as phospholipids (PL), free fatty acids (FFA) and triacylglycerol (TG). When labeled lipid was apically loaded as a micellar lipid solution into Caco-2 cell cultures, NB-598 reduced basolaterally secreted radioactivity in cholesterol, cholesterol ester, PL and TG. Furthermore, NB-598 suppressed the basolateral secretion of apolipoprotein (apo) B. When microsomes prepared from control Caco-2 cells were incubated with 10 microM NB-598, acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) activity was inhibited slightly. After incubating Caco-2 cells with 10 microM NB-598, a slight reduction in cellular ACAT activity was also observed. These results suggest that suppression of the secretion of particles containing apo B and reduction of cellular ACAT activity in the intestinal epithelia are part of the mechanism of the cholesterol-lowering effect of NB-598.", 
    "85": "IgE molecules bind mast cells via a heterotetrameric receptor termed Fc epsilon RI. Cross-linking of bound IgE by specific allergen (Ag) initiates a signal transduction cascade resulting in a degranulation response. Inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in isoprenoid and sterol biosynthesis, by the cholesterol-lowering drug, lovastatin, blocks Fc epsilon RI-dependent [3H] serotonin ([3H]5HT) release from the mast cell line, RBL-2H3. We studied the mode and locus of action of lovastatin in these cells. Lovastatin inhibited Ag-stimulated degranulation, as well as that evoked by ionomycin or by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin, stimuli which bypass early receptor events. Inhibition was concentration-dependent, occurred at levels which reduce lipid synthesis, and was reversible by addition of mevalonic acid, the product of the reductase reaction. The effects of lovastatin were not mimicked by treatment with the sterol demethylase inhibitor, econazole, suggesting that nonsterol isoprenoid synthesis is required for the degranulation response. Conversely, tyrosine kinase inhibitors from three disparate chemical classes reduced stimulus-evoked [3H]5HT release in a manner similar to lovastatin, suggesting that these agents share similar loci of action. Accordingly, lovastatin altered the phosphorylation pattern in unstimulated RBL-2H3, and reduced the phosphorylation response to IgE cross-linking. By analogy to 5HT release, this effect was concentration-dependent and mevalonic acid-reversible. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor, geldanamycin, also reduced the phosphorylation response to Ag. Lyn, a Src-related tyrosine kinase activated upon IgE cross-linking, was little influenced by either lovastatin or geldanamycin. Thus, lipid synthesis inhibition by lovastatin results in impaired tyrosine phosphorylation in RBL-2H3. This impairment is reflected in the subsequent exocytotic response. While lovastatin may inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation via an indirect mechanism, our results with tyrosine kinase inhibitors support the concept that multiple tyrosine kinases participate in the Fc epsilon RI-dependent signal transduction process.", 
    "86": "The present study was designed to test the effect of pravastatin, a new, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, on the progression of coronary artery disease in patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia. Angiographic entry criteria included the presence of > or = 1 stenosis > or = 50% in a major epicardial coronary artery, and certification of film quality through the core angiography laboratory. Patients qualified for randomization if after diet stabilization their low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were > or = 130 and < 190 mg/dl, and triglycerides were < or = 350 mg/dl. Pravastatin (40 mg) or placebo is administered once daily at bedtime. Arteriography will be repeated at the end of 3 years of treatment. The primary end point of the study is the change in absolute mean coronary artery diameter. During a 30-month recruitment period, 44,145 patients were screened, and 408 were randomized. The most frequent reason for excluding patients during the screening and dietary lead-in periods was a low serum cholesterol level. A large proportion of patients with documented coronary artery disease have cholesterol concentrations that are considered to be normal or only modestly increased. Adherence to strict standards of quality control for digital analysis of angiograms ensures that baseline angiograms can be interpreted at the end of 3-year follow-up.", 
    "87": "1. Recent investigations revealed that isoprenoid compounds serve as key substances for cellular proliferation through post-translational modification. Previously we reported that tissues of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) had a lower activity of isoprenoid biosynthesis when compared with the normotensive control rat (WKY). However, cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) of SHR showed an enhanced growth rate. These findings led us to investigate further the effect of isoprenoid compounds on VSMC proliferation. 2. When the cells of WKY were stimulated with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) in the presence of lovastatin, [3H]-thymidine incorporation decreased in a dose-dependent manner and was completely inhibited at 30 mumol/L. Exogenously added mevalonate showed a protective effect against lovastatin (81% protection at 0.1 mumol/L). 3. Fluoromevalonate (Fmev), an inhibitor of mevalonate-PP decarboxylase which converts mevalonate-PP into isoprenoids, showed a dual inhibitory effect. DNA synthesis was partially inhibited at 0.01-1 mumol/L, however at 10 mumol/L there was no detectable inhibition. The inhibitory effect was again observed at concentrations over 10 mumol/L. 4. In the presence of lovastatin and Fmev to block both HMG CoA reductase and mevalonate-PP decarboxylase, exogenous mevalonate dose dependently stimulated [3H]-thymidine incorporation induced by FCS. 5. These data suggest the positive effect of the initial mevalonate derivatives other than isoprenoid compounds on the proliferation of VSMC.", 
    "88": "In the rabbit, dietary cholesterol downregulates the hepatic LDL receptor and concomitant treatment with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors partly restores its expression. The aim of this study was to determine whether the LDL receptor activity of circulating mononuclear cells would reflect the changes seen in liver. New Zealand White rabbits were fed for 3 weeks either a normal diet or diets containing 0.25% (w/w) cholesterol, 0.25% cholesterol plus 22 mg/kg per day pravastatin or 0.25% cholesterol plus 6 mg/kg per day simvastatin. Dietary cholesterol increased plasma cholesterol 8.9-fold, liver membrane cholesterol 1.8-fold and bile cholesterol saturation 2.3-fold, and decreased the LDL receptor activities of liver and mononuclear cells by 69% and 58%, respectively. In the cholesterol-fed rabbit, pravastatin decreased plasma cholesterol by 55%, liver membrane cholesterol by 29% and bile cholesterol saturation by 23%, and increased liver and mononuclear cell LDL receptor activities by 120% and 77%, respectively. Similarly, simvastatin decreased plasma cholesterol by 74%, liver membrane cholesterol by 24% and bile cholesterol saturation by 38%, and increased liver and mononuclear cell LDL receptor activities by 80% and 62%, respectively. Liver and mononuclear cell LDL receptor activities were directly correlated (r = 0.73, P < 0.005) and both activities were inversely correlated with plasma cholesterol concentration in a log-linear fashion (r = -0.70, P < 0.005 and r = -0.69, P < 0.01, respectively). The LDL receptor activity of mononuclear cells therefore reflected the hepatic LDL receptor activity in these rabbits.", 
    "89": "Treatment with 25-hydroxycholesterol, an inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase activity, efficiently blocked the proliferation of both human normal mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) and breast cancer cells (MDA231). Upon release of the block there was a rapid increase in the HMG CoA reductase activity, which reached a maximum 4 h after removal of the inhibitor, in both cell types. In MDA231 this increase in enzymatic activity was followed by a rapid initiation of DNA synthesis, whereas this process started considerably later in HMEC. Even in HMEC stimulated to DNA synthesis by insulin, there was first an increase in HMG CoA reductase activity with a maximum 4 h after the addition of the mitogen. If 25-hydroxycholesterol was added along with insulin, the subsequent initiation of DNA synthesis was prevented. Following a 25-hydroxycholesterol treatment as short as 4 h, the onset of DNA synthesis was delayed, indicating that a certain level of HMG CoA reductase activity (= mevalonate synthesis) in the early and mid stage of the prereplicative phase is required for the transduction of the signal leading to initiation of DNA synthesis. In concurrence with these data, it was also demonstrated that giving an exogenous supply of mevalonate to the insulin-stimulated HMEC results in a faster initiation of DNA synthesis.", 
    "90": "In a retrospective study, we examined the influence of apolipoprotein (apo) E polymorphism and gender on the response to treatment with 80 mg/d lovastatin in a homogeneous population of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), most of whom were carriers of the 10-kb deletion of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene. Apo E phenotype distribution among the 189 FH patients was not different from that of a normal population sample. The total and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) response to lovastatin in the overall group (men and women) was significantly lower in the E4 subset compared with E2 and E3 subsets. This finding is in agreement with trends observed in previous reports. On the other hand, the response of LDL-C to lovastatin was significantly lower in E4 men than in E4 women, whereas the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration in the E4 group increased significantly more in men than in women, suggesting a role of gender in modulating the response to lovastatin. Hence, apo E polymorphism influenced LDL-C (and HDL-C) response to lovastatin in men, but not in women, revealing the existence of a gene-by-gender interaction. These findings were independent of the nature of the LDL receptor defect. We conclude that male FH patients carrying the epsilon 4 allele respond less efficiently to lovastatin than men carrying the epsilon 3 or epsilon 2 allele or women of any apo E phenotype with respect to decreasing total cholesterol and LDL-C levels, but respond more efficiently with respect to increasing HDL-C levels. The full practical implication of these findings remains to be explored.", 
    "91": "Abnormalities of lipid composition and metabolism are frequently observed in patients with cholestatic liver disease. Both elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels and the appearance of lipoprotein-X (LP-X) in plasma underlie the high incidence of hypercholesterolemia in this population. We tested the hypothesis that the hypercholesterolemia of cholestasis may reflect a failure of normal feedback regulation of hepatic cholesterogenesis by determining the influence of LP-X on the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol synthesis, hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase. Cultured human hepatoma (HepG2) cells were incubated in purified lipoprotein for 24 hours, harvested, and then assayed for HMG CoA reductase activity and mass. LDL isolated from either normal controls or patients with cholestasis decreased reductase activity in a dose-dependent fashion (2 to 30 micrograms cholesterol/mL media) to a level approximately 50% of that measured in cells incubated in lipid-deficient serum. LP-X failed to downregulate enzyme activity compared with LDL, with little change in reductase activity at cholesterol concentrations (30 micrograms/mL media) that produced maximal reductase inhibition by LDL. Three distinct LP-X subspecies were purified from the plasma of a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and tested in an analogous manner. All LP-X subspecies were similar in their inability to decrease reductase activity as compared with LDL. HMG CoA reductase mass was increased approximately twofold in cells incubated with LP-X, as estimated by Western blot analysis. These results suggest that LP-X may contribute to hypercholesterolemia in the cholestatic patient by not effectively downregulating hepatic cholesterol synthesis.",

The importance of lipids in the progression of established glomerular disease has not been established and is of clinical relevance because of the frequent association of lipid abnormalities with human renal disease. In the present study, 26-week-old hyperlipidemic obese Zucker rats (OZRs) with established nephropathy were treated for a period of 18 weeks with daily injections of the cholesterol synthesis inhibitor lovastatin (4 mg/kg). Compared with control OZRs treated with vehicle, lovastatin-treated OZRs had significantly (P < 0.05) lower serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels throughout the treatment period. Blood pressure and urine albumin excretion in lovastatin-treated OZRs were reduced over the first 12 weeks of therapy, but increased toward the levels in the control OZRs at the end of the protocol. After 18 weeks of therapy, the incidence of glomerulosclerosis in lovastatin-treated OZRs (23.2% +/- 5.8%) was approximately half of that in vehicle-treated OZRs (44.6% +/- 7.7%) (P < 0.05). The reduction in glomerular injury in lovastatin-treated OZRs was not associated with changes in either glomerular area or glomerular macrophage content. In separate experiments, mesangial cells were cultured from glomeruli isolated from 26-week-old proteinuric OZRs. Lovastatin (5 to 40 mumol/L) caused a significant dose-dependent inhibition of serum-stimulated mesangial cell DNA synthesis. The inhibitory effects of lovastatin were completely prevented in the presence of exogenous mevalonate (100 mumol/L). Thus, lovastatin retarded the progression of established glomerular disease in OZRs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

If sustained, this lipid profile probably places these patients at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Despite extensive trials of diet and drug therapy in patients with primary hyperlipidemias, few such trials exist in patients with the nephrotic syndrome. We conducted a randomized, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of pravastatin, the newest cholesterol synthesis inhibitor, in the treatment of the hyperlipidemia of the nephrotic syndrome. After dietary modification was implemented, 13 patients received pravastatin and eight received placebo. All patients were maintained on a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet for the duration of the trial (24 weeks). The dose of pravastatin was increased from the initial 20 mg/d to 40 mg/d at week 10 or 18 if TC remained elevated (> 50th percentile). A bile acid sequestrant was added at week 18 if TC remained elevated and if the patient was already receiving the maximal pravastatin dosage. Dietary modification did not significantly change the lipid profile. Pravastatin (20 mg/d) reduced TC by 22% from a baseline of 301 +/- 28 mg/dL (P < 0.05) and LDLC by 28% from a baseline of 222 +/- 28 mg/dL (P < 0.05).

Although it binds in vitro to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, it is not clear whether this mechanism also operates in vivo. We studied the interaction of Lp(a) and of apoprotein(a) (apo[a]) with hepatoma cells (HepG2 and Hep3B) with the following results. (1) HepG2 cells exhibited saturable high-affinity binding of LDLs, whereas the majority of Lp(a) binding was of low affinity and nonsaturable. Preincubation of HepG2 cells with LDL markedly reduced cholesterol biosynthesis, but Lp(a) had a much lower effect. (2) When HepG2 cells were preincubated for 48 to 72 hours with Lp(a) or apo(a), 125I-LDL binding was increased by a factor of > 2. During this time, up to approximately 1 microgram of apo(a) per 1 milligram cell protein was found to be cell associated in an undegraded form. Monoclonal antibodies against the LDL receptor did not prevent the increase in LDL binding stimulated by apo(a). (3) Coincubation with LDL caused a significant increase of Lp(a) degradation by HepG2 cells that was probably caused by an increase of Lp(a) uptake in a \"hitchhiking\"-like process.",

These effects were reversed by the hydroxymethyl glutaryl CoA reductase inhibitor, mevinolin. In these studies, comparison of cell growth in medium supplemented with fetal calf serum (FCS) and LPDS demonstrated that, after growth with LPDS, the ability of Ca2+ and the Ca2+ channel agonist, BAY K 8644, to enhance the amplitude of contraction decreased by 25 and 50%, respectively. These effects of growth in LPDS were reversed by incubation with mevinolin. LPDS had no effect on either Ca2+ channel number as measured by (+)-[5-methyl-3H]PN200-110 binding or Ca2+ current density as measured by the whole cell patch method. Treatment of cells grown in LPDS with pertussis toxin, which inactivates alpha o and alpha i, returned the contractile response to 10(-7) M BAY K 8644 to control levels. Pertussis toxin had no effect on the contractile response or adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate levels in control cells grown in FCS alone.

The three oxysterols differed markedly in their effects on LDL metabolism, as measured by the combination of cell-associated plus degraded 125I-LDL. The 26-hydroxysterol, at concentrations from 0.1 microM to 75 microM, lowered LDL metabolism. In contrast, the 25-hydroxysterol and the 15-ketosterol, at concentrations from 0.05 microM to 2.5 microM, caused an increase in LDL metabolism. At higher concentrations of these oxysterols, LDL metabolism was suppressed. However, upon increasing the concentration of the 15-ketosterol further to 75 microM, an extraordinary 9-fold increase in LDL metabolism was observed. In contrast to their effects on LDL metabolism, the 25-hydroxysterol and the 15-ketosterol caused simple concentration-dependent decreases in the levels of HMG-CoA reductase activity under the same conditions.",

The hypothesis is developed that in a particular population psychiatric (mood) disorders may be triggered by use of simvastatin or other cholesterol lowering compounds. A low or lowered cholesterol level may be related to disturbances in the cerebral serotonin metabolism.

No radioactivity was found to be protein-bound on treating the soluble enzyme with [35S]diallyl disulfide, indicating the absence of the mixed disulfide of the type allyl-S-S-protein. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses of the diallyl-disulfide-treated protein showed no traces of the dimer of the type protein-S-S-protein, but clearly indicated BME-reversible increased mobility, as expected of an intramolecular protein disulfide. The sulfhydryl groups, as measured by alkylation with iodo[2-14C]acetic acid, were found to decrease in the diallyl-disulfide-treated enzyme protein. Tryptic peptide analysis also gave support for the possible presence of disulfide-containing peptides in such a protein. It appears that diallyl disulfide inactivated HMG-CoA reductase by forming an internal protein disulfide that became inaccessible for reduction by DTT, and thereby retaining the inactive state of the enzyme."
