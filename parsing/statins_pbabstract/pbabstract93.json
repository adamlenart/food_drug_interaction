Insights into the prevalence of lipid abnormalities of statin-treated patients in Belgium are lacking and may shed light on an unmet medical need for optimal use of current lipid-lowering therapies. This study aims to assess the prevalence and types of persistent lipid abnormalities in patients receiving statin therapy in a real-life primary care setting in Belgium.", 
    "1": "This cross-sectional cohort study was designed to estimate the prevalence of specific lipid abnormalities in statin-treated patients in Belgium. Total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides were recorded from the patients' medical record. Patient's total cardiovascular risk and corresponding lipid treatment goals were defined based on the recent European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society recommendations.", 
    "2": "Overall, 56.2% of the statin-treated patients were not at goal for LDL-C. Low HDL-C (< 40 mg dl(-1) in men, < 45 mg dl(-1) in women) and elevated triglycerides (> 150 mg dl(-1) ) were seen in 16.3% and 29.0% of patients, respectively. Very high-risk patients were more likely to have LDL-C not at goal (71.4% of them), while 60.0% of high-risk patients and 34.1% of moderate-risk patients were not at goal for LDL-C. Use of ezetimibe (10 mg) was strongly associated with meeting LDL-C goals (OR 16.9, p < 0.0001).", 
    "3": "In Belgium, lipid abnormalities remained highly prevalent despite statin treatment, with more than half of all patients not reaching their LDL-C treatment goal. This finding clearly indicates that more aggressive lipid-lowering treatment is required in clinical daily practice to achieve the goals of the current guidelines.", 
    "4": "The goal of this study was to compare the effects of minocycline and simvastatin on functional recovery and brain gene expression after a cortical contusion impact (CCI) injury. Dosage regimens were designed to provide serum concentrations in a rat model in the range obtained with clinically approved doses; minocycline 60 mg/kg q12h and simvastatin 10 mg/kg q12h for 72 h. Functional recovery was assessed using motor and spatial learning tasks and neuropathological measurements. Microarray-based transcriptional profiling was used to determine the effect on gene expression at 24 h, 72 h, and 7 days post-CCI. Gene Ontology analysis (GOA) was used to evaluate the effect on relevant biological pathways. Both minocycline and simvastatin improved fine motor function, but not gross motor or cognitive function. Minocycline modestly decreased lesion size with no effect of simvastatin. At 24 h post-CCI, GOA identified a significant effect of minocycline on chemotaxis, blood circulation, immune response, and cell to cell signaling pathways. Inflammatory pathways were affected by minocycline only at the 72 h time point. There was a minimal effect of simvastatin on gene expression 24 h after injury, with increasing effects at 72 h and 7 days. GOA identified a significant effect of simvastatin on inflammatory response at 72 h and 7 days. In conclusion, treatment with minocycline and simvastatin resulted in significant effects on gene expression in the brain reflecting adequate brain penetration without producing significant neurorestorative effects.", 
    "5": "Electronic healthcare records (EHRs) are increasingly used to store clinical information. A secondary benefit of EHRs is their use, in an anonymized form, for observational research. The Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) contains EHRs from primary care in the UK and, despite 1083 peer-reviewed research publications, has never been used to obtain pharmacogenetic samples. Using a statin-induced myopathy paradigm, we evaluated using the CPRD to obtain patient samples for a pharmacogenetic study targeting 250 cases and 500 controls from UK general practitioner (GP) practices.", 
    "6": "The CPRD identified potential patients fitting specific case-definition criteria (active rhabdomyolysis or creatine phosphokinase > four times the upper limit of normal), and corresponding GP practices were asked to invite patient participation. Consenting patients were requested to provide either saliva or blood samples and to complete an ethnicity questionnaire. Control subjects were recruited from the same GP practice (saliva) or a small number of practices (blood). Samples were forwarded for DNA extraction.", 
    "7": "Thirty-six months of recruitment yielded DNA samples from 149 statin-induced myopathy cases and 587 tolerant controls. Data show that contacting patients through their GP is a reliable method for obtaining samples without compromising anonymity. Saliva collection directly from patients was considerably less effective than blood sampling. After 10 months of recruitment, saliva sampling was suspended in favour of blood sampling.", 
    "8": "We demonstrate the potential of EHRs for identifying accurately phenotyped cases and controls for pharmacogenetic studies. Recruitment was successful only because of the willingness of GP practices to participate and the existence of strong doctor-patient relationships. The present study provides a model that can be implemented in future genetic analyses using EHRs.", 
    "9": "Statins (HMGCoA-reductase inhibitors) produce numerous non-lipid related, 'pleiotropic' effects. Our aim was to investigate whether simvastatin treatment affects serum levels of vascular calcification inhibitors, such as fetuin-A, osteoprotegerin (OPG) and osteopontin (OPN), in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).", 
    "10": "A total of 98 statin-free patients with angiographically proven, newly diagnosed CAD were treated with simvastatin (20-40 mg daily) for 6 months to target a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level <100 mg/dL (the statin group [SG]). Thirty-five age- and sex-matched healthy individuals without any chronic metabolic or cardiovascular disease at baseline served as a healthy control group (HCG). Clinical, anthropometrical and metabolic parameters and serum fetuin-A, OPG, OPN and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels were assayed at baseline in all participants and after 6 months only in SG patients.", 
    "11": "Compared with HCG subjects at baseline, SG patients exhibited higher serum levels of OPG (7.39 \u00b1 2.94 pmol/L vs 2.47 \u00b1 1.15 pmol/L, p < 0.001), OPN (60.99 \u00b1 17.52 ng/mL vs 45.45 \u00b1 10.26 ng/mL, p = 0.005) and hsCRP (4.66 \u00b1 1.74 mg/L vs 1.58 \u00b1 0.56 mg/L, p < 0.001) as well as lower serum levels of fetuin-A (0.222 \u00b1 0.036 \u03bcg/L vs 0.839 \u00b1 0.092 \u03bcg/L, p < 0001). Apart from significantly reducing plasma total cholesterol and LDL, simvastatin also reduced serum levels of fetuin-A (by ~62.6 %), OPG (by ~47.2 %), OPN (by ~44.6 %) and hsCRP (by ~45.3 %) (p < 0.05) in SG patients. In standard multiple regression analysis, the simvastatin-induced reduction in fetuin-A was independently associated with changes in total cholesterol (\u03b2 = -0.289, p = 0.048) and LDL (\u03b2 = -0.302, p = 0.032) (R (2) = 0.305, p = 0.040).", 
    "12": "Patients with CAD showed derangements in serum levels of all vascular calcification inhibitors compared with those in healthy controls. Simvastatin treatment for 6 months significantly decreased serum fetuin-A, OPG and OPN levels, but the clinical relevance of this requires further investigation.", 
    "13": "Experimental studies have shown the ability of statins to stimulate bone formation when delivered locally or in large oral doses, however most have been studied in rodents. This anabolic effect is through the selective activation of BMP-2. Our purpose was to determine the effects of local treatment with lovastatin on bone healing in mammals as a preclinical animal model. We administered lovastatin (6\u2009mg/kg) by percutaneous injection to a canine tibial osteotomy stabilized with external fixation. We found that lovastatin improved bone healing after a single injection into the fracture site assessed by serial radiography and histology at bone union. However, lovastatin treatment resulted in adverse local soft tissue inflammation. These results suggest that percutaneous lovastatin injection may be a useful adjuvant treatment over the course of bone healing to augment fracture repair, although further investigation into the mechanism of soft tissue adverse effects is warranted.", 
    "14": "Although our understanding of the relationship between cancer and statin use continues to improve, it remains a complex association requiring further research focusing on both biologic and clinical end points in a wide range of patient populations. To date, most of the published results are from observational studies detailing the risk of incident cancers or from randomized controlled trials with cardiovascular primary end points and cancer only as a secondary end point. Although there is certainly great value in the information obtained from observational studies, they cannot prove a causal link between statins and cancer, and it would then seem appropriate to design and implement clinical trials. Such studies should consider three main end products of the mevalonate pathway (cholesterol, geranyl pyrophosphate, and farnesyl pyrophosphate) from a mechanistic perspective, as well as the potential for cancer cell mediation with statin use, in addition to pertinent clinical end points including cancer incidence and mortality.", 
    "15": "Early statin treatment has beneficial effects on the prognosis after acute coronary syndromes. We investigated the impact of prior statin treatment on the outcome of patients without a prior history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and were treated with thrombolysis.", 
    "16": "The study enrolled 1032 consecutive patients who satisfied the above criteria. They were categorized into two groups, based on their prior statin treatment for at least 3 months before admission: the statin pretreatment group (n=124) and the statin-na\u00efve group (n=908). All patients received high-dose statins during hospitalization and were prescribed statins after discharge. The primary outcome was the incidence of successful thrombolysis, as expressed by the percentage of patients with 50% ST-segment resolution and complete retrosternal pain resolution at 90 minutes. Secondary outcomes included reduction in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and CK-MB levels, and in-hospital, short- and long-term cardiovascular mortality.", 
    "17": "ST-segment resolution 50% was observed in 63.7% of the statin-pretreatment group and in 49.1% of statin-na\u00efve patients (p<0.01). Statin pretreatment was associated with lower hs-CRP and peak CK-MB levels (p<0.001). The statin-pretreatment group had lower 30-day mortality (5.6% vs. 12.3%, p<0.05), whereas no significant differences were detected in in-hospital or 3-year mortality.", 
    "18": "Prior statin treatment in patients without a history of CAD who present with STEMI is associated with successful thrombolysis, decreased systemic inflammation, a lesser degree of myocardial damage, and a possible reduction in short-term mortality.", 
    "19": "Preventing atherosclerotic plaque destabilization and rupture is the most reasonable therapeutic strategy for acute myocardial infarction. Therefore, we tested the hypotheses that (1) inflammatory monocytes play a causative role in plaque destabilization and rupture and (2) the nanoparticle-mediated delivery of pitavastatin into circulating inflammatory monocytes inhibits plaque destabilization and rupture.", 
    "20": "We used a model of plaque destabilization and rupture in the brachiocephalic arteries of apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice fed a high-fat diet and infused with angiotensin II. The adoptive transfer of CCR2(+/+)Ly-6C(high) inflammatory macrophages, but not CCR2(-/-) leukocytes, accelerated plaque destabilization associated with increased serum monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), monocyte-colony stimulating factor, and matrix metalloproteinase-9. We prepared poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid nanoparticles that were incorporated by Ly-6G(-)CD11b(+) monocytes and delivered into atherosclerotic plaques after intravenous administration. Intravenous treatment with pitavastatin-incorporated nanoparticles, but not with control nanoparticles or pitavastatin alone, inhibited plaque destabilization and rupture associated with decreased monocyte infiltration and gelatinase activity in the plaque. Pitavastatin-incorporated nanoparticles inhibited MCP-1-induced monocyte chemotaxis and the secretion of MCP-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 from cultured macrophages. Furthermore, the nanoparticle-mediated anti-MCP-1 gene therapy reduced the incidence of plaque destabilization and rupture.", 
    "21": "The recruitment of inflammatory monocytes is critical in the pathogenesis of plaque destabilization and rupture, and nanoparticle-mediated pitavastatin delivery is a promising therapeutic strategy to inhibit plaque destabilization and rupture by regulating MCP-1/CCR2-dependent monocyte recruitment in this model.", 
    "22": "Use of high-dose statin therapy (HDST) in patients with stroke became standard clinical practice after the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) study, in which the mean age of the study population was approximately 63 years. Little data are available on the adverse effects of statins when used in high doses in adults older than 65 years. The objective of this study was to assess the magnitude of adverse effects of HDST in geriatric patients.", 
    "23": "This single-center, retrospective, case-control study was conducted at Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York. All patients older than 65 years admitted between 2008 and 2011 to the hospital's Upstate Stroke Center with acute stroke were eligible. Electronic medical records of 200 eligible patients were reviewed to collect demographic, clinical, and laboratory data. Patients on HDST (cases) were compared with those on low doses (controls) using the \u03c7, Fisher exact (two-sided), and Student t tests.", 
    "24": "One hundred cases (mean age 80.5 \u00b1 7.7 years) were compared with 100 controls (mean age 78.9 \u00b1 6.4 years). Sixty-seven percent were taking simvastatin. Ninety percent of the cases compared with 81% of the controls had ischemic stroke. The prevalence of elevated alanine aminotransferase (13%) and myositis (4%) was significantly higher in the cases than in the controls. Fourteen percent of the cases reported myalgias, 9% had nausea, and 6% had diarrhea. Seventy-three cases had low-density lipoprotein levels <100 mg% and 41% of the cases had mean glycated hemoglobin levels \u2265 6.5%.",

    "26": "This article reviews the most important muscle toxins, many of which are widely prescribed medications. Particular emphasis is placed on statins, which cause muscle symptoms in a relatively large proportion of the patients who take them.", 
    "27": "As with other toxic myopathies, most cases of statin-associated myotoxicity are self-limited and subside with discontinuation of the offending agent. Importantly, about 2% of the population is homozygous for a single nucleotide polymorphism, and these individuals have a dramatically increased risk of self-limited statin myopathy. Much more rarely, statins trigger a progressive autoimmune myopathy characterized by a necrotizing muscle biopsy and autoantibodies recognizing hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the pharmacologic target of statins.", 
    "28": "In most cases, toxic myopathies resolve after the toxic agent is stopped. Recognizing that statins can cause an autoimmune necrotizing myopathy is important because patients with this form of statin-triggered muscle disease usually require immunosuppressive therapy.", 
    "29": "Associations between serum cholesterol levels or lipid-lowering treatment and depression risk have been controversial. Associations between statin use and depression risk have been investigated in patients with coronary artery diseases but have not been examined after stroke. This study aimed to investigate whether statin use was associated with depression ascertained at 2 weeks and 1 year after stroke. A total of 423 patients were evaluated 2 weeks after stroke, and 288 (68%) were followed 1 year later. At the 2 examinations, depression (major or minor depressive disorder) was diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria, and depression severity was assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Depression subscale and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Logistic regression and repeated-measures analyses of variance were carried out. Statins were used in 251 (59%) of 423 patients at baseline. Statin use was not associated with poststroke depression (PSD) status at baseline but was significantly associated with reduced risk of all PSD, and of major PSD specifically, at follow-up. Statin use was also associated with better trajectories of depression assessment scale scores over the 1-year follow-up. Statin use was associated with a reduced risk of depression at 1 year after stroke. Likely causality and underlying mechanisms need to be further clarified.", 
    "30": "Several randomized studies have suggested that pretreatment with statins may reduce a periprocedural biomarker release in patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI); however, results remain controversial. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a 1-day rosuvastatin therapy on troponin I release in patients who underwent nonemergency PCI. A total of 445 patients with angina pectoris were randomly assigned to therapy with rosuvastatin (20 mg 12 hours before coronary angiography + 20 mg immediately before PCI; rosuvastatin group, 220 patients) or PCI without statin therapy (control group, 225 patients). In patients taking statins (73%), rosuvastatin was added to their long-term statin therapy. The primary end point was the incidence of TnI microleak defined as TnI elevation >1.5\u00d7 upper limit of normal, and the secondary end point was the incidence of post-PCI TnI elevation >3\u00d7 upper limit of normal. The incidence of primary and secondary end point in the rosuvastatin versus control group was 13.6% versus 12% (p = 0.61) and 8.2% versus 7.1% (p = 0.67), respectively. Patients with C-reactive protein \u22652.0 mg/L had a decreased release of post-PCI TnI in the rosuvastatin group (0.032 [0.010 to 0.143] \u03bcg/L vs 0.056 [0.018 to 0.241] \u03bcg/L; p = 0.04). In conclusion, 1-day rosuvastatin therapy (20 mg twice a day) did not influence post-PCI TnI release in patients with angina. However, these results suggest that, in patients with an advanced inflammatory status, rosuvastatin loading therapy might have a cardioprotective effect.", 
    "31": "Statins, frequently prescribed in lipid-lowering therapies, seem to have additional beneficial effects on periodontitis and tooth loss. If this is true, then chronic treatment with statins should also result in diminished tooth loss as a long-term response.", 
    "32": "A 5-year population-based follow-up study of tooth loss was performed comparing participants treated with statins (n = 134) with those not on the drugs (Study of Health in Pomerania). Negative binomial regression models were used to analyze the count variable of the outcome, including risk factors for tooth loss and measures of cholesterol metabolism.", 
    "33": "When adjusted for age and sex, statins were associated with reduced tooth loss during the follow-up period (incidence risk ratio [IRR] = 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.50 to 0.99, P = 0.04). When additionally adjusted for risk factors of periodontal breakdown, IRR was 0.72 (95% CI = 0.52 to 1.01). There was significant interaction with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) at baseline. After stratification by LDL-c, statins were associated with reduced tooth loss, resulting in IRR = 0.89 (95% CI = 0.44 to 1.83) and 0.64 (95% CI = 0.43 to 0.95), P = 0.03, at LDL-c concentrations \u2264100 mg/dL and >100 mg/dL (2.58 mmol/L), respectively. The data also showed reduced tooth loss associated with the 5-year reduction in LDL-c levels on a mmol/L basis and independently of statins (IRR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.80 to 0.96, P = 0.004).", 
    "34": "Long-term treatment with systemically administered statins may have the beneficial effect of protecting against tooth loss.", 
    "35": "Recent studies have suggested a relation between statin use and the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the conclusions are inconsistent. Some studies found an increased incidence of PD among statin users; others found a decreased incidence. Others showed that PD incidence was related to baseline cholesterol levels.", 
    "36": "To examine the association between baseline levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), long-term statin use, and the incidence of PD.", 
    "37": "The study group consisted of a historical cohort of 94,308 men and women in Israel aged 45 years or more without PD or statin use at baseline, between 2000 and 2007. PD incidence among long-term statin users was compared with that among nonusers. The cohort was divided into 4 groups according to baseline LDL-C levels, and their relative risks of developing PD were calculated with adjustment for potential confounders (sex, age, socioeconomic status, history of ischemic heart disease, hypertension, stroke, and smoking). The association between different variables was analyzed with a Cox proportional hazards model.", 
    "38": "During the study period, 1035 incident cases of PD were identified. Statin use was associated with a significant decrease in the incidence of PD (odds ratio, 0.73, 95% confidence interval, 0.60-0.88; P=.001). No association was found between baseline LDL-C levels and PD risk.", 
    "39": "Our results provide additional evidence regarding the lower incidence of PD among statin users. These findings warrant further research regarding the possible neuroprotective role of statins in PD and other neurodegenerative diseases.", 
    "40": "Congenital analbuminemia is a rare autosomic recessive inherited disorder characterized by low plasma albumin and hypercholesterolemia, which may increase cardiovascular risk. Patients are essentially asymptomatic, apart from ease of fatigue, minimal ankle oedema and hypotension. There is no accepted strategy for safely treating both hypercholesterolemia and analbuminemia in order to eventually decrease the atherosclerotic risk. We report a case of congenital analbuminemia (1.0 g/dL) in a 38-year-old male with hypercholesterolemia (range: 406-475 mg/dL) and severe arterial dysfunction [no brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD)]. Long-term, cholesterol-lowering treatment with atorvastatin was associated with the appearance of peripheral edema. Two-months of infusion with albumin improved FMD (7%) and reduced serum cholesterol (273 mg/dL), supporting the hypothesis of a compensatory role of hypercholesterolemia. Statin treatment, together with periodical albumin infusions, may contribute to the safe reduction of cardiovascular risk.", 
    "41": "A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the pleiotropic effect of statin therapy to reduce sympathetic outflow in cardiovascular disease. We tested the hypothesis that statin treatment could improve baroreflex gain-sensitivity triggered by morphological adaptations in the mechanoreceptor site, thus reducing sympathetic activity, regardless of arterial pressure (AP) level reduction. Male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were divided into control (SHR, n = 8) and SHR-simvastatin (5 mg/kg/day, for 7 days) (SHR-S, n = 8). After treatment, AP, baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) in response to AP-induced changes, aortic depressor nerve activity, and spectral analyses of pulse interval (PI) and AP variabilities were performed. Internal and external carotids were prepared for morphoquantitative evaluation. Although AP was similar between groups, sympathetic modulation, represented by the low frequency band of PI (SHR: 6.84 \u00b1 3.19 vs.",

In parallel, simvastatin induced an increase of 26% and 21% in the number of elastic lamellae as well as a decrease of 9% and 25% in the carotid thickness in both, external and internal carotid, respectively. Moreover, improved baroreceptor function (SHR: 0.78 \u00b1 0.03 vs.", 
    "44": "1.06 \u00b1 0.04% mv/mmHg) was observed in addition to a 115% increase in aortic depressor nerve activity in SHR-S rats. Therefore, our data suggest that the reduction of sympathetic outflow in hypertension by simvastatin treatment may be triggered by structural changes in the carotid arteries and increased BRS in response to an improvement of the baroreceptors discharge and consequently of the afferent pathway of the baroreflex arch.", 
    "45": "The various risk factors for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are almost identical to those for atherosclerosis and include abnormal levels of lipids or lipoproteins. Lipid peroxidation parameters and total antioxidant capacity in the serum of male patients with PAD before surgery as well as 3-5 days and 7-10 days after surgery were measured. We also compared these parameters with those in a group of patients receiving simvastatin therapy. Concentrations of lipid hydroperoxides (LOOHs) and malondialdehyde, the total antioxidant capacity (assessed by ferric reducing antioxidant power assay), concentration of thiol (-SH) groups, and ceruloplasmin activity were determined spectrophotometrically in PAD patients treated surgically (Group I) or pharmacologically (Group II). The patients before surgical treatment had significantly higher concentrations of malondialdehyde but lower ceruloplasmin activity than those observed in Group II, treated with simvastatin. No significant differences before surgery in ferric reducing antioxidant power or thiol concentrations were found between the two groups. However, in Group I, both ferric reducing antioxidant power and thiol group concentrations decreased 3-5 days postoperatively, and ceruloplasmin activity increased 7-10 days after surgical treatment. The presented results demonstrate diverse oxidative stress responses to surgical treatment and confirm the beneficial effects of statin therapy in PAD.",

    "47": "Subjects with CCM disease (4 sporadic and 17 familial) underwent MRI imaging using the dynamic contrast-enhanced quantitative perfusion and quantitative susceptibility mapping techniques that measure hemodynamic factors of vessel leak and iron deposition, respectively, previously demonstrated in CCM disease. Regions of interest encompassing the CCM lesions were analyzed using these techniques.", 
    "48": "Susceptibility measured by quantitative susceptibility mapping was positively correlated with permeability of lesions measured using dynamic contrast-enhanced quantitative perfusion (r=0.49; P\u22640.0001). The correlation was not affected by factors, including lesion volume, contrast agent, and the use of statin medication. Susceptibility was correlated with lesional blood volume (r=0.4; P=0.0001) but not with lesional blood flow.", 
    "49": "The correlation between quantitative susceptibility mapping and dynamic contrast-enhanced quantitative perfusion suggests that the phenomena of permeability and iron deposition are related in CCM; hence, more leaky lesions also manifest a more cumulative iron burden. These techniques might be used as biomarkers to monitor the course of this disease and the effect of therapy.", 
    "50": "The objective of the study is to understand the therapeutic effects of lipophilic (simvastatin) and hydrophilic statins (pravastatin) combined with/without hyaluronic acid for osteoarthritis by an in vitro LPS-induced inflammatory model of articular chondrocytes. HA in combination with different doses of simvastatin or pravastatin were used. Beside cytotoxicity, the influence of statins on NO production, pro-inflammatory cytokine, inflammatory mediators, and NF-\u03baB p50 protein were analyzed. Finally, TUNEL assay was performed to detect DNA strand breakage. Two statins were less able to lower NF-\u03baB activity when they were administrated along without HA. The gene expression demonstrates that simvastatin and pravastatin had the ability to decrease pro-inflammatory and inflammatory mediator levels. High dose simvastatin with or without HA down regulated inflammatory cytokines, but resulted in higher cytotoxicity. TUNEL assay confirms the regulatory effect of statins with or without HA over the apoptosis of chondrocytes, especially in hydrophilic statins. The significant down-regulation of inflammatory mediators suggests that intra-articular injection of HA in combination with statins might feasibly slow the progress of osteoarthritis. Administration of simvastatin or pravastatin with hyaluronic acid may produce beneficial effects for OA treatment, but with better results when hydrophilic statin was used.",

While there has been a comprehensive evaluation of the prevalence of neuropathic signs/symptoms and risk factors (RFs) for PN or symptomatic PN (SPN) with initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in ART-na\u00efve patients, similar evaluation in ART-experienced patients is limited. This study investigated the prevalence and RFs for PN/SPN in ART-experienced patients enrolled in clinical salvage therapy studies. Between February 2000 and June 2007, 522 ART-experienced participants who experienced virologic failure with a prior regimen and started new regimens were followed longitudinally and annually screened for signs and symptoms of PN. Rates of PN/SPN at 3 years since parent study entry were 52.8 and 24.0 %, respectively. Aging, taller height, protease inhibitor use, and female sex were significant RFs for PN/SPN. The use of statin drugs was significantly associated with lower odds of SPN, and it may prevent progression from no SPN to SPN.", 
    "63": "In the present study, we investigated the effect of a combination of atorvastatin and celecoxib on the formation of interleukin (IL)-6, a cytokine that is increased during the progression of LNCaP tumors from androgen dependence to androgen independence. Culturing LNCaP cells in androgen\u2011depleted (AD) medium increased the levels of IL-6 and survivin, and treatment of the cells in AD medium with a combination of atorvastatin and celecoxib strongly inhibited the increase in IL-6 and survivin which is one of the downstream targets of the IL-6 signaling pathway. Addition of recombinant IL-6 partially abrogated the combined effect of atorvastatin and celecoxib on apoptosis in LNCaP cells cultured in AD medium. In SCID mice, we found that the levels of IL-6 and survivin expression were increased when LNCaP tumors became androgen-independent. Treatment of the mice with atorvastatin or celecoxib alone caused decrease in the levels of IL-6 and survivin as LNCaP tumors became androgen-independent, but treatment of the mice with a combination of celecoxib and atorvastatin resulted in a much stronger inhibition in the increase in IL-6 and survivin expression. Our results indicate that decreases in IL-6 and survivin levels by atorvastatin and celecoxib administration are associated with increased apoptosis in LNCaP cells treated with this drug combination. Our in vivo studies indicate that the inhibitory effect of a combination of atorvastatin and celecoxib on the progression of androgen-dependent LNCaP xenograft tumors to androgen independence is associated with inhibition of the increase in IL-6 and survivin that occurs when androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate tumors become androgen-independent.",

Recent pharmacovigilance data has suggested that people taking statins have an increased risk of psychiatric adverse events such as amnesia and anxiety. This study aimed to investigate the possibility of statin-induced amnesia through animal models of memory and learning. We conducted extracellular field recordings of synaptic transmission in area CA1 of hippocampal slices to examine the effects of acute cholesterol lowering with lipid lowering drugs. We also assessed the effect of six weeks of simvastatin (2mg/kg/d) and atorvastatin (1mg/kg/d) treatment using the Morris water maze. Long Term Potentiation (LTP) was significantly diminished in the presence of 3\u00b5M atorvastatin or simvastatin and by the cholesterol sequestering agent methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (MBCD). The effects were reversed in the MBCD but not the statin treated slices by the addition of cholesterol. In the water maze, statin treatment did not cause any deficits in the first five days of reference memory testing, but statin treated guinea pigs preformed significantly worse than control animals in a working memory test. The deficits observed in our experiments in water maze performance and hippocampal LTP are suggestive of statin induced changes in hippocampal plasticity. The effects on LTP are independent of cholesterol regulation, and occur at concentrations that may be relevant to clinical use. Our results may help to explain some of the behavioural changes reported in some people after beginning statin treatment.",

Our results showed that simvastatin loaded PLGA microspheres can be successfully obtained through O/W emulsion/solvent evaporation method with appropriate morphologic characteristics and high encapsulation efficiency for incorporation in bone cements. The biodegradable characteristic of the microspheres successfully presented a slow release and the duration of the release lasted for more than 1 month.

    "70": "We aimed to evaluate the association among race and ethnicity, statin prescription, and clinical outcomes among hospitalized patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), adjusted for confounders. Racial and ethnic disparities in CHD outcomes may be related to differential uptake of preventive medications, but data from real-world settings are limited. This was a 1-year prospective study of patients with preexisting CHD without a documented contraindication to statin (n = 3,067, 35% black or Hispanic, 65% white or Asian, 35% women) who participated in an National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute clinical outcome study of patients admitted to a cardiovascular service. Baseline clinical and medication data and 30-day and 1-year outcomes (death or rehospitalization) were documented by electronic medical record, National Death Index, and/or standardized mail survey. Logistic regression was used to evaluate associations among race and ethnicity, statin prescription, and outcomes adjusted for demographics and co-morbidities. Black and Hispanic patients were more likely to be dead or rehospitalized at 1 year (odds ratio [OR] 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06 to 1.43) and less likely to report statin use before admission (62% vs 72%, adjusted OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.76) than whites and Asians; statin prescription was similar at discharge among blacks and Hispanics (81%) versus whites and Asians (84%). Black and Hispanic patients were more likely to have hypertension, diabetes, or renal failure and less likely to have health insurance than whites and Asians (p <0.05). The increased 1-year odds of death or rehospitalization in minorities versus whites and Asians were explained by demographics and co-morbidities not by differential statin prescription (adjusted OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.30). In conclusion, in this study of hospitalized patients with preexisting CHD, differential statin prescription did not explain racial and ethnic disparities in 1-year outcomes. Efforts to reduce CHD rehospitalizations should consider the greater burden of co-morbidities among racial and ethnic minorities.", 
    "71": "Statins have pleiotropic properties and might exert an effect even in the field of cancer. Statins competitively inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme (HMG-CoA) reductase, the major rate-limiting enzyme that controls the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid. Specifically, inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by statins has been proved to prevent the synthesis of mevalonic acid, a precursor of non-steroidal isoprenoids, which are lipid attachment molecules for small G proteins, such as Ras, Rho and Rac. Thus, statins may inhibit the synthesis of isoprenoids and thereby suppress the activation of small G proteins. In addition, statins exert pro-apoptotic, anti-angiogenic, and immunomodulatory effects, which may prevent cancer growth. Statins may inhibit the growth of a variety of cancer cell types, including breast, gastric, pancreatic, and prostate carcinoma, neuroblastoma, melanoma, mesothelioma and acute myeloid leukemia cells. They exert pro-apoptotic effects in a wide range of cancer cell lines, but with many differences in the sensitivity to statin-induced cell death among different cancer cell types. Regarding anti-angiogenic effects, multiple statin effects on blood vessel formation by inhibition of angiogenesis through down-regulation of pro-angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation and inhibition of adhesion to extracellular matrix by blocking intercellular adhesion molecules have been suggested. The molecular mechanisms of statin immunomodulation often implicate multiple pathways, regarding the regulation of genes encoding key molecules, which are involved in antigen presentation and subsequent immunomodulation. Another mechanism involves the down-regulation of the nuclear factor-kappa-B, which is responsible for the transcription of many genes involved in immunologic mechanisms, such as interferon-inducible protein-10, monocyte chemo-attractant protein 1 and cyclooxygenase-2. Statins have been associated with a significantly lower risk of breast, colorectal, ovarian, pancreatic, lung cancers and lymphoma in several observational studies. On the other hand, other studies, including meta-analyses have raised concerns about the safety of statins among elderly patients. A recent study upon the relationship between statin use (prior to cancer diagnosis) and cancer-related mortality in the entire Danish population from 1995-2009 in adults > 40 years of age has been conducted. As compared to statin non-users, patients using statins prior to cancer diagnosis were 15% less likely to die from any cause or cancer specifically. Further investigation is needed to elaborate on their mode of action as well as their true significance on cancer prevention and perhaps as an adjuvant to cancer chemotherapy.", 
    "72": "The most recent guidelines released by the EAS/ESC and the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) retain low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) as the primary measure of the atherogenic risk of the apolipoprotein B (apoB) lipoproteins and the primary target of LDL-C lowering therapy. Both organizations endorse non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and apoB as \"alternate/secondary\" targets, but neither group offers evidence supporting the continued preference of LDL-C as the primary target over non-HDL-C and apoB. Further, both suggest that non-HDL-C and apoB more or less measure the same thing and, therefore, are essentially interchangeable. But what is the evidence that LDL-C should remain the primary target, and are apoB and non-HDL-C mirror images of one another? Furthermore, are estimation of risk and establishment of treatment targets the only relevant issues, or is diagnosis also an essential objective? These are the questions this article will address. Our principal objectives are: (1) to clarify the differences between LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and apoB and to distinguish what they measure; (2) to summarize the evidence relating to LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and apoB as predictors of cardiovascular risk and as targets for treatment; and (3) to demonstrate that diagnosis of atherogenic dyslipoproteinemias should be a fundamental clinical priority.",

    "102": "Combination pills containing aspirin, multiple blood pressure (BP) lowering drugs, and a statin have demonstrated safety, substantial risk factor reductions, and improved medication adherence in the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The individual medications in combination pills are already recommended for use together in secondary CVD prevention. Therefore, current information on their pharmacokinetics, impact on the risk factors, and tolerability should be sufficient to persuade regulators and clinicians to use fixed-dose combination pills in high-risk individuals, such as in secondary prevention. Long-term use of these medicines, in a polypill or otherwise, is expected to reduce CVD risk by at least 50-60% in such groups. This risk reduction needs confirmation in prospective randomized trials for populations for whom concomitant use of the medications is not currently recommended (e.g. primary prevention). Given their additive benefits, the combined estimated relative risk reduction (RRR) in CVD from both lifestyle modification and a combination pill is expected to be 70-80%. The first of several barriers to the widespread use of combination therapy in CVD prevention is physician reluctance to use combination pills. This reluctance may originate from the belief that lifestyle modification should take precedence, and that medications should be introduced one drug at a time, instead of regarding combination pills and lifestyle modification as complementary and additive. Second, widespread availability of combination pills is also impeded by the reluctance of large pharmaceutical companies to invest in development of novel co-formulations of generic (or 'mature') drugs. A business model based on 'mass approaches' to drug production, packaging, marketing, and distribution could make the combination pill available at an affordable price, while at the same time providing a viable profit for the manufacturers. A third barrier is regulatory approval for novel multidrug combination pills, as there are few precedents for the approval of combination products with four or more components for CVD. Acceptance of combination therapy in other settings suggests that with concerted efforts by academics, international health agencies, research funding bodies, governments, regulators, and pharmaceutical manufacturers, combination pills for prevention of CVD in those with disease or at high risk (e.g. those with multiple risk factors) can be made available worldwide at affordable prices. It is anticipated that widespread use of combination pills with lifestyle modifications can lead to substantial risk reductions (as much as an 80% estimated RRR) in CVD. Heath care systems need to deploy these strategies widely, effectively, and efficiently. If implemented, these strategies could avoid several millions of fatal and non-fatal CVD events every year worldwide.",

Female rats were divided into control SHAM, OVX, and OVX treated with 17\u03b2-estradiol (EST) or ATO groups. The MVB reactivity was determined in organ chambers, vascular oxidative stress by dihydroethidine staining, and the expression of target proteins by western blot. The reduction in acetylcholine-induced relaxation in OVX rats was restored by ATO or EST treatment. The endothelium-dependent nitric oxide (NO) component was reduced in OVX rats, whereas the endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) component or prostanoids were not altered in the MVBs. Endothelial dysfunction in OVX rats was associated with oxidative stress, an up-regulation of iNOS and NADPH oxidase expression and a down-regulation of eNOS expression. Treatment with ATO or EST improved the NO component of the relaxation and normalized oxidative stress and the expression of those signaling pathways enzymes. Thus, the protective effect of ATO on endothelial dysfunction caused by estrogen deficiency highlights a significant therapeutic benefit for statins independent of its effects on cholesterol, thus providing evidence that non-estrogen therapy could be used for cardiovascular benefit in an estrogen-deficient state, such as menopause.",

Some studies showed a negative impact of low cholesterol levels in patients with severe HF (endotoxin-lipoprotein hypothesis and coenzyme Q10 hypothesis). On the other hand, a large amount of literature demonstrates that in patients with HF, statins have a positive impact on survival and other outcomes, regardless of whether the HF was of ischemic or nonischemic origin, which is related to a combination of mechanisms (pleiotropic effects and cholesterol reduction). Much of this evidence, however, comes from observational and retrospective studies and subgroup analyses of statin use in patients with HF. Randomized clinical trials examining the efficacy of statins in HF (GISSI-HF and CORONA) did not show a benefit in mortality for patients with HF randomized to receive statins.

Some research groups have previously shown that HD is associated with cellular radiosensitivity in quiescent cells. However, there is still no mechanistic model explaining such specific clinical feature. Here, we examined the ATM-dependent signaling and repair pathways of the DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), the key damage induced by ionizing radiation, in human HD skin fibroblasts. Early after irradiation, quiescent HD fibroblasts showed an abnormally low rate of recognized DSB managed by non-homologous end-joining reflected by a low yield of nuclear foci formed by phosphorylated H2AX histones and by 53BP1 protein. Furthermore, HD cells elicited a significant but moderate yield of unrepaired DSB 24\u00a0h after irradiation. Irradiated HD cells also presented a delayed nucleo-shuttling of phosphorylated forms of the ATM kinase, potentially due to a specific binding of ATM to mutated huntingtin in the cytoplasm. Our results suggest that HD belongs to the group of syndromes associated with a low but significant defect of DSB signaling and repair defect associated with radiosensitivity. A combination of biphosphonates and statins complements these impairments by facilitating the nucleo-shuttling of ATM, increasing the yield of recognized and repaired DSB.",

A 'pleiotropic' property of statins receiving less attention is their effect on the autonomic nervous system. Increased central sympathetic outflow and diminished cardiac vagal tone are disturbances characteristic of a range of cardiovascular conditions for which statins are now prescribed routinely to reduce cardiovascular events: following myocardial infarction, and in hypertension, chronic kidney disease, heart failure and diabetes. The purpose of the present review is to synthesize contemporary evidence that statins can improve autonomic circulatory regulation. In experimental preparations, high-dose lipophilic statins have been shown to reduce adrenergic outflow by attenuating oxidative stress in central brain regions involved in sympathetic and parasympathetic discharge induction and modulation. In patients with hypertension, chronic kidney disease and heart failure, lipophilic statins, such as simvastatin or atorvastatin, have been shown to reduce MNSA (muscle sympathetic nerve activity) by 12-30%. Reports concerning the effect of statin therapy on HRV (heart rate variability) are less consistent.

In this study, an experiment was designed to investigate the potential protective effect of COT on the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) induced by high fat diet and to explore the underlying mechanisms. We established a guinea pig model of NAFLD and treated the animals with three doses of COT or 20 mg/kg/d simvastatin (a positive control drug) for 8 weeks. H&E staining of liver tissue sections indicated that COT remarkably improved histopathological change of liver induced by high fat diet. Serum biochemical assays revealed that COT significantly decreased ALT and AST activities in serum. Besides, COT also reduced body weight and liver weight of guinea pigs under high fat diet. Hepatic lipid analysis showed that COT remarkably decreased the contents of total cholesterol (TC), free cholesterol (FC), cholesterol ester (CE) and triglyceride (TG) in liver of guinea pigs fed high fat diet in a dose-dependent manner. The analysis of hepatic genes involved in cholesterol metabolism by quantitative real-time PCR revealed that COT upregulated the mRNA abundance of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase A1 (CYP7A1) and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR). Measurement of biochemical parameters in liver indicated that COT attenuated oxidative stress and lowered NO and iNOS levels in guinea pigs under high fat diet. These results reveal that administration of COT effectively ameliorates high-fat diet-induced NAFLD in guinea pigs through decreasing hepatic lipid levels, suppressing oxidative stress and lowering NO and iNOS levels in liver.",

Nevertheless, serious efforts are still being made to develop new SV formulations with, for example, improved tabletability or bioavailability properties. These efforts frequently involve heating the compound well above ambient temperature or even fusion. In this work, the thermal stability of solid SV under different atmospheres was investigated by using isothermal tests in glass ampules, differential scanning calorimetry, and Calvet-drop microcalorimetry experiments. These tests were combined with analytical data from diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry or Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (LC-FT-ICR-MS). No decomposition was observed when the sample was kept at a temperature \u2264373 K under N2 or reduced pressure (13.3 Pa) atmospheres. Thermal degradation was, however, observed for temperatures \u2265353 K in the presence of pure or atmospheric oxygen. The nature of the two main oxidative degradation products was determined through MS/MS experiments and accurate mass measurements of the precursor ions using FT-ICR-MS. The obtained results indicated that the decomposition process involves the oxidation of the hexahydronaphthalene fragment of SV.",

Additionally, the hypothesis that statin-mediated increases in HDL cholesterol levels have a impact on cardiovascular risk has not been clearly demonstrated. Statin therapy has little impact on the cholesterol content carried by HDL in the bloodstream (i.e., HDL cholesterol levels), but statins can induce a significant redistribution of HDL particle size, particle concentration, and physicochemical and functional properties. Our objective is to summarize the evidence arising from epidemiological, clinical, and experimental studies that suggests a potential role for statin therapy in the modulation of parameters of HDL metabolism and reverse cholesterol transport.",

This step is the limiting point for the synthesis of cholesterol in mammals and ergosterol in fungi. We describe in this article the genome organization of HMGR coding genes and those deduced from different fungi, recount the evidence showing statins as HMGR inhibitors for ergosterol synthesis and its effect in yeast viability, and propose fungal HMGR (HMGRf) as a model to study the use of pharmaceutical compounds to inhibit cholesterol and ergosterol synthesis. Bibliographical search and bioinformatic analyses were performed and discussed. HMGRfs belong to the class I with a high homology in the catalytic region. The sterol biosynthetic pathway in humans and fungi share many enzymes in the initial steps (such as the HMGR enzyme), but in the last steps enzymes are different rendering the two final products: cholesterol in mammals and ergosterol in fungi. With regards to inhibitors such as statins and other compounds, these affect also fungal viability. Since HMGR from Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Ustilago maydis are very similar to the human HMGR in the catalytic regions, we propose that fungal enzymes can be used to test inhibitors for a potential use in humans. We consider that HMGRf is a good therapeutic target to design and test new antifungal compounds.

DOX caused deterioration in hepato-renal function, as it significantly increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) compared to control, with distortion in normal renal and hepatic histology. Pretreatment with Ator preserved kidney and liver function and histology. DOX caused oxidative stress as indicated by significant decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH) level and catalase activity with increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) compared to control. Combined DOX/Ator significantly reversed these values compared to DOX in both kidney and liver. DOX caused nitrosative stress, as it increased tissue nitric oxide compared to control. Concomitant DOX/Ator treatment decreased NO in kidney and liver. Furthermore, DOX caused inflammatory effects indicated by up-regulation of hepato-renal nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) expression and increment of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) tissue concentration, with down-regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). DOX also caused apoptotic effect, as it up-regulated the apoptotic marker, Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), expression in liver and kidney. Using Ator with DOX reversed hepato-renal inflammatory and apoptotic marker expression. These findings suggest Ator as a protective adjuvant against DOX toxicity, via antioxidant, anti-nitrosative, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic mechanisms.",

In this update, new clinical studies identified since then that provide further insight into effects on muscle, cognition, cataracts, diabetes, kidney disease, and cancer are discussed. Of these, the arenas of greatest controversy pertain to purported effects on cognition and the emergence of diabetes during long-term therapy. Regarding cognition, the available evidence is not strongly supportive of a major adverse effect of statins. In contrast, the linkage between statin therapy and incident diabetes is more firm. However, this risk is more strongly associated with traditional risk factors for new-onset diabetes than with statin itself and any possible negative effect of new-onset diabetes during statin treatment is far outweighed by the cardiovascular risk reduction benefits. Additional studies are also discussed, which support the principle that systematic statin rechallenge, and lower or intermittent statin dosing strategies are the main methods for dealing with suspected statin intolerance at this time.",
