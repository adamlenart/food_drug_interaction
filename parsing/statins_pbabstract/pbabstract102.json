    "1": "This was an observational, single-centre study including all patients with symptomatic PAD receiving aspirin. In patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy with additional clopidogrel, platelet responsiveness to clopidogrel also was tested. Platelet responsiveness was assessed with the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay. Patients with residual aspirin reaction units \u2265550 and platelet reactivity units \u2265234 were considered nonresponders. The study's primary endpoint was to determine the prevalence of nonresponsiveness to aspirin; secondary endpoints included the prevalence of dual nonresponsiveness.", 
    "2": "In total, 145 consecutive patients (mean age 67 \u00b1 9 years) receiving aspirin 100 mg were tested, whereas 128 of 145 (88.3 %) were under dual antiplatelet therapy with additional clopidogrel 75 mg. The prevalence of nonresponsiveness to aspirin was 20.7 % (30/145). Among the 128 patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy, 65 (50.8 %) demonstrated nonresponsiveness to clopidogrel and 16 (11.7 %) dual nonresponsiveness to both aspirin and clopidogrel. Aspirin nonresponsiveness was not significantly different in patients suffering from diabetes, renal disease, critical limb ischemia (CLI) or those receiving statin, antihypertensive or proton-pump inhibitors therapy. Clopidogrel nonresponsiveness was significantly higher in older patients (p = 0.01) and those suffering from CLI (p = 0.03) and renal disease (p = 0.001) and significantly lower in smokers (p = 0.01).",

However, it is unclear what residual risk of CAD this marker may have during statin treatment.",

We showed an association between rs10455872 and CAD in statin-treated individuals and have replicated this finding in the Utrecht Cardiovascular Pharmacogenetics study (combined odds ratio 1.41, 95% confidence interval 1.17-1.68, P = 4.5 \u00d7 10, n = 8822) suggesting that statin treatment does not abrogate this well-established genetic risk for CAD. Furthermore, in a Cox proportional hazards model with LDLc measured time dependently, we demonstrated that the relationship between CAD and rs10455872 was independent of LDLc during statin treatment.", 
    "7": "Individuals with the G allele of rs10455872, which represents approximately one in seven patients, have a higher risk of CAD than the majority of the population even after treatment with statins; and therefore represent a vulnerable group requiring an alternative medication in addition to statin treatment.", 
    "8": "Antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel should be administered to patients with acute coronary syndromes and those submitted to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (secondary prevention). Clopidogrel is a pro-drug which requires hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolic activation to produce the active metabolite that inhibits platelet aggregation. CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5 are the principal contributors in the two-step hepatic oxidation of clopidgrel. However, the response to clopidogrel is not uniform; it varies from patients platelet reactivity on standard-dose clopidogrel are at increased risk of recurrence of adverse cardiovascular events. Also drug-drug interactions that influence the function of CYP isoenzymes may affect the response to clopidogrel. Lipophilic statins, such as atorvastatin, are predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 and may interfere with CYP activation of clopidogrel, contrary to what happens with hydrophilic statins, such as rosuvastin or pravastatin. Recently, it has been shown that in patients who presented post-PCI high on-treatment platelet reactivity on standard-dose clopidogrel during chronic treatment with clopidogrel and low-dose atorvastatin (10 mg), switching to a non-CYP3A4-metabolized statin, such as rosuvastatin or pravastatin, resulted in a significant decrease in platelet reactivity. The clinical benefit of statins is attributed to mulitple mechanisms which go beyond their lipid-lowering effects and include also antithrombotic properties. In particular, atorvastatin inhibits adenosine diphospate and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. Moreover, pharmacodynamic studies appear to show some synergy between clopidogrel and atorvastatin: the enhancement of clopidogrel effects due to atorvastatin seems to be dose-related and independent of LDL cholesterol reduction. A recent study shows that the addition of high-dose atorvastatin (80mg) for 30 days significantly improves the pharmacodynamic effects of double-dose clopidogrel, reducing platelet reactivity and improving optimal clopidogrel response in statin na\u00efve patients with high-on treatment platelet reactivity on standard-dose clopidogrel. These pharmacodynamic studies suggest that switching to a no CYP3A4-metabolized statin in patients with high on-treatment platelet reactivity on standard-dose clopidogre on chronic treatment with low-dose atorvastatin or administration of high-dose atorvastatin maybe two alternative strategies to avoid possible negative drug-drug interactions and to improve individual patient response to clopidogrel.", 
    "9": "We previously demonstrated that lovastatin decreases cyst volume and improves kidney function in the Han:SPRD (Cy/+) rat model of ADPKD. Since endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory activity are evident in patients with ADPKD, we investigated whether lovastatin reduces the inflammation and vascular dysfunction and improves kidney cell energy metabolism of Cy/+ rats.", 
    "10": "Cy/+ and normal littermate control animals (+/+) were treated with either lovastatin (4\u00a0mg/kg/day) or vehicle (ethanol) from 3-8\u00a0weeks of age. 1H-NMR analysis was performed on water-soluble and lipid kidney fractions following perchloric acid extraction. Targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to assess endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress and inflammation markers in plasma and kidney tissue extracts.", 
    "11": "Cy/+ rats showed perturbations in fatty acid metabolism and increased synthesis of pro-inflammatory lipoxygenases-produced bioactive lipids was observed. Lovastatin decreased inflammatory markers, specifically 13-HODE, 12-HETE and leukotriene B4. In Cy/+ rats, lovastatin reduced the elevated homocysteine and allantoin plasma levels and increased arginine, that is known to positively affect NO production.", 
    "12": "As previously described, lovastatin was able to decrease kidney weight and cyst volume density in Cy/+ rats. The decrease in cyst volume was accompanied by a reduction in arachidonic acid-mediated inflammation markers, the normalization of metabolism of NO precursors and the improvement of kidney energy cell metabolism.", 
    "13": "We have shown that autophagy and mitophagy are required for preconditioning. While statin's cardioprotective effects are well known, the role of autophagy/mitophagy in statin-mediated cardioprotection is not. In this study, we used HL-1 cardiomyocytes and mice subjected to ischemia/reperfusion to elucidate the mechanism of statin-mediated cardioprotection.", 
    "14": "HL-1 cardiomyocytes exposed to simvastatin for 24\u2009h exhibited diminished protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, increased activation of unc-51-like kinase 1, and upregulation of autophagy and mitophagy. Similar findings were obtained in hearts of mice given simvastatin. Mevalonate abolished simvastatin's effects on Akt/mTOR signaling and autophagy induction in HL-1 cells, indicating that the effects are mediated through inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. Simvastatin-treated HL-1 cells exhibited mitochondrial translocation of Parkin and p62/SQSTM1, fission, and mitophagy. Because Parkin is required for mitophagy and is expressed in heart, we investigated the effect of simvastatin on infarct size in Parkin knockout mice. Simvastatin reduced infarct size in wild-type mice but showed no benefit in Parkin knockout mice. Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase limits mevalonate availability for both cholesterol and coenzyme Q10 (CoQ) biosynthesis. CoQ supplementation had no effect on statin-induced Akt/mTOR dephosphorylation or macroautophagy in HL-1 cells, but it potently blocked mitophagy. Importantly, CoQ supplementation abolished statin-mediated cardioprotection in vivo.", 
    "15": "Acute simvastatin treatment suppresses mTOR signaling and triggers Parkin-dependent mitophagy, the latter which is required for cardioprotection. Coadministration of CoQ with simvastatin impairs mitophagy and cardioprotection. These results raise the concern that CoQ may interfere with anti-ischemic benefits of statins mediated through stimulation of mitophagy.",

    "17": "Several recent studies have revealed that statins exert anti-inflammatory effects in addition to their lipid-lowering property in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro. Recently, statins were shown to alleviate pain associated trauma in a neuropathic pain model. The aim of the present study was to investigate the underlying mechanisms of analgesia caused by the lipophilic statin simvastatin in an animal model of formalin-induced pain in the rat. Intrathecal pretreatment with simvastatin significantly attenuated the second phase of the acute nociceptive response to formalin injection, and daily administration of simvastatin for 7\u00a0days inhibited the long-term mechanical hyperalgesia caused by formalin injection. Spinal microglial activation (detected by Iba-1 and CD11\u00a0b immunohistochemistry and Western blot), and phosphorylated-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot) were significantly inhibited by simvastatin treatment at day 7 after formalin injection. In addition, peripheral formalin injection induced a significant increase in microglial RhoA activation (detected by membrane RhoA translocation ratio using Western blot) in the spinal cord. The spinal RhoA activation in microglia was reversed by simvastatin treatment. These findings suggest that simvastatin attenuates formalin-induced nociceptive behaviors, at least in part, by inhibiting microglial RhoA and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation.", 
    "18": "Our novel findings indicated that simvastatin attenuated formalin-induced nociceptive responses by inhibiting microglial RhoA and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Inactivation of RhoA-p38 signaling pathway may be a pharmacologic target for treating microglia-directed central nervous system inflammation and chronic pain conditions.",

Predefined quality indicators assessed at hospital discharge included the following: medications (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, \u03b2-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, hydralazine/nitrates, statin therapy, and warfarin), use (or planned use) of implantable intracardiac devices, and blood pressure control (<140/90 mm\u2009Hg). We determined regional variations in quality indicators as well as the temporal variation of these indicators during the course of the trial. There was significant variation in conformity among different quality indicators, ranging from 0% to 89%. Of all potential performance opportunities, 19\u2009076 of 32\u2009268 (59%) were met, with Central Europe highest at 64%, followed by North America (63%), Western Europe (61%), Latin America (56%), and Asia Pacific (51%; P<0.0001). North America, Central Europe, and Asia Pacific regions demonstrated a modest increase in quality indicator conformity over time, although there was no significant change in other regions.",

    "22": "The tRNA gene-mediated (tgm) silencing of RNA polymerase II promoters is dependent on subnuclear clustering of the tRNA genes, but genetic analysis shows that the silencing requires additional mechanisms. We have identified proteins that bind tRNA gene transcription complexes and are required for tgm silencing but not required for gene clustering. One of the proteins, Mod5, is a tRNA modifying enzyme that adds an N6-isopentenyl adenosine modification at position 37 on a small number of tRNAs in the cytoplasm, although a subpopulation of Mod5 is also found in the nucleus. Recent publications have also shown that Mod5 has tumor suppressor characteristics in humans as well as confers drug resistance through prion-like misfolding in yeast. Here, we show that a subpopulation of Mod5 associates with tRNA gene complexes in the nucleolus. This association occurs and is required for tgm silencing regardless of whether the pre-tRNA transcripts are substrates for Mod5 modification. In addition, Mod5 is bound to nuclear pre-tRNA transcripts, although they are not substrates for the A37 modification. Lastly, we show that truncation of the tRNA transcript to remove the normal tRNA structure also alleviates silencing, suggesting that synthesis of intact pre-tRNAs is required for the silencing mechanism. These results are discussed in light of recent results showing that silencing near tRNA genes also requires chromatin modification.",

Western blotting and gelatin zymography were used to investigate the expressions and activities of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 in VSMCs in culture medium when induced with homocysteine for 24, 48, and 72 h. Transwell chambers were employed to test the migratory ability of VSMCs when incubated with homocysteine for 48 h. Different concentrations of rosuvastatin (10(-9)-10(-5) mol/L) were added when VSMCs were induced with 1000 \u03bcmol/L homocysteine.

However, when incubated with 5000 \u03bcmol/L homocysteine, the expression of MMP-2 was up-regulated, but its activity was down-regulated. Increased homocysteine-induced production and activation of MMP-2 were reduced by rosuvastatin in a dose-dependent manner whereas secretion of TIMP-2 was not significantly altered by rosuvastatin. Homocysteine (50-5000 \u03bcmol/L) stimulated the migration of VSMCs in a dose-dependent manner, but this effect was eliminated by rosuvastatin.",

Re-expressing Mecp2 in symptomatic Mecp2-null mice markedly improves function and longevity, providing hope that therapeutic intervention is possible in humans. To identify pathways in disease pathology for therapeutic intervention, we carried out a dominant N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis suppressor screen in Mecp2-null mice and isolated five suppressors that ameliorate the symptoms of Mecp2 loss. We show that a stop codon mutation in Sqle, encoding squalene epoxidase, a rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, underlies suppression in one line. Subsequently, we also show that lipid metabolism is perturbed in the brains and livers of Mecp2-null male mice. Consistently, statin drugs improve systemic perturbations of lipid metabolism, alleviate motor symptoms and confer increased longevity in Mecp2 mutant mice. Our genetic screen therefore points to cholesterol homeostasis as a potential target for the treatment of patients with Rett syndrome.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the relation between degree of neointimal hyperplasia and incidence and characteristics of NA using optical coherence tomography. We identified a total of 252 stents with mean neointimal thickness (NIT) >100 \u03bcm in 212 patients: 100 bare metal stents (BMSs) and 152 drug-eluting stents (DESs). Based on the values of mean NIT, we divided stents into tertiles and compared neointimal characteristics among the 3 groups. NA was defined as the presence of lipid-laden intima and/or calcification inside the stent. In both BMS and DES, there was a difference in the prevalence of lipid-laden intima among the tertiles (18.2% vs 36.4% vs 47.1%, p = 0.042 [BMS]; 19.6% vs 56.9% vs 88.0%, p <0.001 [DES]).

In a multivariate model adjusting for stent type, follow-up duration, conventional coronary risk factors, statin, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blockade use, mean NIT was independently associated with the presence of NA (odds ratio 2.53, 95% confidence interval 1.96 to 3.27, p <0.001). This study demonstrates the presence of a positive correlation between degree of neointimal hyperplasia after stent implantation and presence of lipid-laden intima.

    "118": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is one of the leading causes of death in the United States. Approximately 80% of AAAs occur in the infrarenal abdominal aorta. Most are caused by a degenerative process in the aortic wall, and smoking is the risk factor most strongly associated with AAA. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography is the most reliable imaging modality. Open repair is more invasive initially but more durable, whereas endovascular aneurysm repair is less invasive but less durable. Since degradation of the aorta progresses with age, continuous follow-up after aneurysmal repair improves the long-term outcome.", 
    "119": "The mechanisms by which statins are beneficial are incompletely understood. While the lowering of low-density lipoprotein concentration is associated with regression of atherosclerosis, the observed benefit of statin therapy begins within months after its initiation, making regression an unlikely cause. Although LDL-C lowering is the main mechanism by which statin therapy reduces cardiovascular events, evidence suggests that at least some of the beneficial actions of statins may be mediated by their pleiotropic effects. Thus, statins may modulate the function of cardiovascular cells and key signalling proteins, including small G-proteins, to ultimately exert their pleiotropic effects. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a naturally occurring bioactive lysophospholipid that regulates diverse physiological functions in a variety of different organ systems. Within the cardiovascular system, S1P mediates cardioprotection following ischemia/reperfusion injury, anti-inflammatory response, improvement of endothelial function, increased mobilization and differentiation of endothelial progenitor cells, inhibition of oxidation, and anti-atherogenic and anti-thrombotic actions. Early evidence suggests that the pleiotropic effects of statins may be related to an increase in S1P signalling. This review focuses on S1P signalling as the potential mechanism underlying the pleiotropic effects of statins. An improved understanding of this mechanism may be vital for establishing the clinical relevance of statins and their importance in the treatment and prevention of coronary artery disease. Key points Several studies have demonstrated a benefit from lowering serum LDL-C with statins in patients with and without clinical evidence of CAD. These may be mediated by the pleiotropic effects of statins-the mechanisms of which are incompletely understood. Early evidence suggests that statins may increase S1P signalling pathways through upregulation of the expression of S1P receptors and an increase in plasma levels of S1P to ultimately exert their pleiotropic effects. Future clinical trials and basic science research aimed at the underlying mechanisms of the pleiotropic effects of statins should enlighten us to their relative clinical relevance and importance.",

An LC-MS-MS method has been developed and validated for the simultaneous estimation of atorvastatin and ezetimibe in human plasma using pitavastatin as an internal standard. Liquid-liquid extraction was used for the purification and preconcentration of analytes from human plasma matrix. The chromatographic separation was achieved within 3.0 min by an isocratic mobile phase consisting of 0.2% formic acid in water-acetonitrile (30:70, v/v), flowing through Agilent Eclipse-plus C18, 100 \u00d7 4.6 mm, 3.5 \u00b5m analytical column, at a flow rate of 0.6 mL min(-1). Multiple reaction monitoring transitions were measured in the positive ion mode for atorvastatin and internal standard, while ezetimibe was measured in negative ion mode. A detailed validation of the method was performed as per US-FDA guidelines and the standard curves were found to be linear in the range of 0.2-30.0 ng mL(-1) with a mean correlation coefficient >0.999 for both drugs. In human plasma, atorvastatin and ezetimibe were stable for at least 36 days at -70 \u00b1 5 \u00b0C and 6 h at ambient temperature. After extraction from plasma, the reconstituted samples of atorvastatin and ezetimibe were stable in an autosampler at ambient temperature for 6 h. Also, the cited drugs were stable in plasma samples upon subjecting to three freeze thaw cycles. The method is simple, specific, sensitive, precise, accurate and suitable for bioequivalence and pharmacokinetic studies of this combination.",

The prevalence of heterozygous FH is one in five hundred people. Owing to dysfunctional low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors due to genetic mutations, serum low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are considerably increased from birth. FH is clinically diagnosed by confirmation of family history and characteristic findings such as tendon xanthoma or xanthelasma. Thus, clinical concern and suspicion are important for early diagnosis of the disease. Current guidelines recommend lowering LDL-C concentration to at least 50% from baseline. Statins are shown to lower LDL-C levels with high safety, and thus, have been the drug of choice. However, it is difficult to achieve an ideal level of LDL-C with a single statin therapy in the majority of FH patients. Alternatively, lipid lowering combination therapy with the recently-introduced ezetimibe has shown more encouraging results.",

Thus, gaining meaningful insight into the impact of each element on the disposition of a drug and accurately predicting drug-drug interactions becomes very challenging. To address this, an in vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE)-linked mechanistic physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) framework for modelling liver transporters and their interplay with liver metabolising enzymes has been developed and implemented within the Simcyp Simulator(\u00ae).",

Genetic counseling practitioners often discuss strategies for reducing the risk of cancer for patients at high risk due to their genetic background.

Unfortunately, modifiable risk factors for prostate cancer have only been documented in the general population and have not yet been studied in the BRCA carrier subpopulation. Therefore, this study aimed to identify modifiable risk factors for prostate cancer in BRCA carriers. We examined prostate cancer risk factors in 74 men who were part of families with a BRCA mutation. This study examined nine dichotomous variables including: exercise, history of vasectomy, smoking history, alcohol use, finasteride use, statin use, aspirin use, coffee use, and vitamin use. The survey was sent to all cases of prostate cancer in the Hereditary Cancer Center Database at Creighton University with a known BRCA status. This study confirmed the protective benefits of daily aspirin use, which have been observed in previous studies of the general population, and suggests its benefit in BRCA carriers.

Children rarely suffer from them, although most of the risk factors which accelerate progression of atherosclerosis commence in childhood, including: dyslipidemias, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Moreover during last few years the incidence of some of risk factors in children, such as obesity, diabetes and dyslipidemia has increased significantly. It is known from the autopsy studies that atherosclerosis can be identified at very young age in healthy children. In adult population medications such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin) have strong position confirmed by many multicenter clinical trials. They significantly reduce cardiovascular risk and increase life expectancy. Latest recommendations on management of hyperlipidemias in children expand indications for screening of lipid level imbalances and indicate statins as main pharmacotherapy after failure of life style changes. On the other hand acetylsalicylic acid is not used so broadly. Only children at high risk of thrombosis may benefit from its antiplatelet property. This review presents the latest recommendations and the therapeutic role of these medications in pediatric population.", 
    "179": "In recent decades, a large body of research has focused on the role of nitric oxide (NO) in the development of cerebral vasospasm (CV) following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Literature searches were therefore conducted regarding the role of NO in cerebral vasospasm, specifically focusing on NO donors, reactive nitrogen species, and peroxynitrite in manifestation of vasospasm. Based off the assessment of available evidence, two competing theories are reviewed regarding the role of NO in vasospasm. One school of thought describes a deficiency in NO due to scavenging by hemoglobin in the cisternal space, leading to an NO signaling deficit and vasospastic collapse. A second hypothesis focuses on the dysfunction of nitric oxide synthase, an enzyme that synthesizes NO, and subsequent generation of reactive nitrogen species. Both theories have strong experimental evidence behind them and hold promise for translation into clinical practice. Furthermore, NO donors show definitive promise for preventing vasospasm at the angiographic and clinical level. However, NO augmentation may also cause systemic hypotension and worsen vasospasm due to oxidative distress. Recent evidence indicates that targeting NOS dysfunction, for example, through erythropoietin or statin administration, also shows promise at preventing vasospasm and neurotoxicity. Ultimately, the role of NO in neurovascular disease is complex. Neither of these theories is mutually exclusive, and both should be considered for future research directions and treatment strategies.",

    "199": "Fracture healing is a process of recovering injured bone tissue forms and functions. Osteoporosis can delay the healing process, which contributes to personal suffering and loss of activities. Osteoporosis patients tend to lose bone mass at the metaphyseal region which require treatment to increase bone mass. Postmenopausal osteoporosis is the most common osteoporosis that occurs in women which subsequently resulted in fractures even under slight trauma. Estrogen Replacement Therapy (ERT), the recommended therapy for postmenopausal osteoporosis, is associated with higher risk of breast cancer, ovarian cancer and cardiovascular diseases. As osteoporotic fractures are becoming a public health issue, alternative treatment is now being thoroughly explored. The potential agent is statins, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor which is widely used for hypercholesterolemia treatment. Statins have been found to increase bone mass by stimulation of Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) expression and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) production. However, these bone forming effects were achieved at very high systemic doses. Therefore, studies on locally applied statins are required to further explore the ability of statins to stimulate bone formation at acceptable doses for better fracture healing. This review highlights the animal and clinical studies on fracture healing promotions by statins and the mechanisms involved.",

Forty-two Wistar rats were divided into seven groups, including control and test groups (n=6). The control animals received saline, and the test animals were treated with saline (sham group), mesalamine (50 mg/kg; M group), atorvastatin (20 mg/kg; A group), HBE (100 mg/kg; H group), mesalamine and HBE (HM group), or atorvastatin plus HBE (HA group), 3 days before and a week after colitis induction. Colitis was induced by administration of 1 mL AA (4%) via a polyethylene catheter intrarectally. High-performance liquid chromatography analyses showed that HBE contained 0.13% and 0.5% oleanolic acid and ursolic acid, respectively. Elevated myeloperoxidase activity and lipid peroxidation were attenuated in the HA group. The H and HM groups showed marked reductions in colitis-induced decreases in total thiol molecules and body weight. The histopathological studies revealed that HBE decreased colitis-induced edema and infiltration of neutrophils. Our data suggest the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of HBE and atorvastatin protect against AA-induced colitis. The anti-inflammatory effect of HBE may be attributable to its ability to decrease myeloperoxidase activity as a biomarker of neutrophil infiltration.",

Despite inferior results to carotid endarterectomy in terms of post-operative rate of stroke and/or death, except for young patients, carotid stenting remains the best choice in patients at high surgical risk. The best medical treatment, consisting in correction of cardiovascular risk factors, statin therapy and anti-aggregation led to a drastic reduction in the annual rate of stroke associated to carotid stenosis and thus limited the surgical intervention in asymptomatic patient to men with a life expectancy of at least 5 years and a stenosis > 70%.", 
    "202": "Hepatocytes play a central and crucial role in cholesterol and lipid homeostasis, and their proper function is of key importance for cardiovascular health. In particular, hepatocytes (especially periportal hepatocytes) endogenously synthesize large amounts of cholesterol and secrete it into circulating blood via apolipoprotein particles. Cholesterol-secreting hepatocytes are also the clinically-relevant cells targeted by statin treatment in vivo. The study of cholesterol homeostasis is largely restricted to the use of animal models and immortalized cell lines that do not recapitulate those key aspects of normal human hepatocyte function that result from genetic variation of individuals within a population. Hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) derived from human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells can provide a cell culture model for the study of cholesterol homeostasis, dyslipidemias, the action of statins and other pharmaceuticals important for cardiovascular health. We have analyzed expression of core components for cholesterol homeostasis in untreated human iPS cells and in response to pravastatin. Here we show the production of differentiated cells resembling periportal hepatocytes from human pluripotent stem cells. These cells express a broad range of apolipoproteins required for secretion and elimination of serum cholesterol, actively secrete cholesterol into the medium, and respond functionally to statin treatment by reduced cholesterol secretion. Our research shows that HLCs derived from human pluripotent cells provide a robust cell culture system for the investigation of the hepatic contribution to human cholesterol homeostasis at both cellular and molecular levels. Importantly, it permits for the first time to also functionally assess the impact of genetic polymorphisms on cholesterol homeostasis. Finally, the system will also be useful for mechanistic studies of heritable dyslipidemias, drug discovery, and investigation of modes of action of cholesterol-modulatory drugs.",

The model incorporated population-representative data from India on multiple risk factors that affect myocardial infarction and stroke mortality, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, coronary heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease. We also included data from India on cigarette smoking, bidi smoking, chewing tobacco, and secondhand smoke. According to the model's results, smoke-free legislation and tobacco taxation would likely be the most effective strategy among a menu of tobacco control strategies (including, as well, brief cessation advice by health care providers, mass media campaigns, and an advertising ban) for reducing myocardial infarction and stroke deaths over the next decade, while cessation advice would be expected to be the least effective strategy at the population level. In combination, these tobacco control interventions could avert 25% of myocardial infarctions and strokes (95% CI: 17%-34%) if the effects of the interventions are additive. These effects are substantially larger than would be achieved through aspirin, antihypertensive, and statin therapy under most scenarios, because of limited treatment access and adherence; nevertheless, the impacts of tobacco control policies and pharmacological interventions appear to be markedly synergistic, averting up to one-third of deaths from myocardial infarction and stroke among 20- to 79-y-olds over the next 10 y. Pharmacological therapies could also be considerably more potent with further health system improvements.",

Despite the high cardiovascular risk in patients with renal impairment, only a small percentage of patients receive adequate cholesterol-lowering therapy. The use of statins, inhibitors of the endogenous synthesis of cholesterol in patients with CKD, represents an efficient therapeutic instrument for reducing cardiovascular risk, at least in the early stage of the disease. Such evidence is currently lacking in dialysis, that is a setting where cardiovascular mortality is not consistently due to classical atherosclerosis. In addition to their efficacy, statins are proved as safe drugs with a high tolerability profile in CKD. In the case of intolerant patients, a new therapeutic perspective is represented by ezetimibe, inhibitor of intestinal absorption of cholesterol, whose effectiveness and tolerability allow its use throughout all stages of the renal disease.",

    "235": "The prevalence of apparent treatment-resistant hypertension was 15.8%, 24.9%, and 33.4% for those participants with estimated GFR \u2265 60, 45-59, and <45 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), respectively, and 12.1%, 20.8%, 27.7%, and 48.3% for albumin-to-creatinine ratio<10, 10-29, 30-299, and \u2265 300 mg/g, respectively. The multivariable-adjusted prevalence ratios (95% confidence intervals) for apparent treatment-resistant hypertension were 1.25 (1.11 to 1.41) and 1.20 (1.04 to 1.37) for estimated GFR levels of 45-59 and <45 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), respectively, versus \u2265 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) and 1.54 (1.39 to 1.71), 1.76 (1.57 to 1.97), and 2.44 (2.12 to 2.81) for albumin-to-creatinine ratio levels of 10-29, 30-299, and \u2265 300 mg/g, respectively, versus albumin-to-creatinine ratio<10 mg/g. After multivariable adjustment, men, black race, larger waist circumference, diabetes, history of myocardial infarction or stroke, statin use, and lower estimated GFR and higher albumin-to-creatinine ratio levels were associated with apparent treatment-resistant hypertension among individuals with CKD.", 
    "236": "This study highlights the high prevalence of apparent treatment-resistant hypertension among individuals with CKD.", 
    "237": "B-mode ultrasound measurements of the echolucency of the carotid intima-media may hold information on cardiovascular risk. The information obtained from this measurement may depend on which gain settings are used. We studied the effect of gain settings on echolucency measurements and its consequences on risk factor relations and treatment effects.", 
    "238": "We used two approaches. In the first, we examined the relationship between calibration, gain and common grey-scale median (GSM) from repeated ultrasound images obtained from four healthy individuals at gain settings ranging from -20 to 20\u200adB. In the second, we evaluated the effect of gain settings on the relation of risk factors and statin treatment with common GSM, using images from 325 participants of the Measuring Effects on Intima-Media Thickness: an Evaluation of Rosuvastatin (METEOR) study with documented gain settings. Echolucency of the carotid intima-media was measured from ultrasound images using PaintShop Pro and Artery Measurement Software and expressed as GSM.", 
    "239": "In healthy individuals, common GSM increased with increments in gain setting, primarily when the measurements were not calibrated. In the METEOR study sample, age and sex were significantly related to gain setting. The risk factor relations with common GSM were of the same magnitude and direction after adjustment for gain setting. Furthermore, adjustment for gain setting did not alter the rates of GSM change over time.", 
    "240": "Extreme variability in gain settings has a major impact on the echolucency measurements of the far wall common carotid intima-media. Calibration should be used to adjust for these effects of gain settings. Variability in gain settings, however, seems limited in real practice and did not change the direction and magnitude of the relations under study. However, as age and sex are major determinants of gain settings, adjustment for or stratification by age and sex is recommended in studies into echolucency of the carotid intima-media in situations in which gain settings are unknown.", 
    "241": "Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a severe type of stroke for which there is currently no specific medical therapy. We hypothesized that statins reduce immediate inflammatory injury and improve long-term recovery from increased neurogenesis and angiogenesis. We conducted a large retrospective cohort study to assess the influence of statin therapy on patient death and disability at 12 months after ICH.", 
    "242": "This was a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database at a tertiary care medical center. Patients were grouped based on statin use, and poor outcome was assessed as dead or alive with dependency (modified Barthel Index\u226414).", 
    "243": "We compared outcomes in 190 patients exposed to statins to 236 patients who were not exposed to statins. Univariate analysis found that statin use was associated with decreased mortality in-hospital and at 12 months (P=.001). Multivariable analysis found that statin use was associated with a decreased odds of death or disability at 12 months after ICH (odds ratio 0.44; 95% confidence interval 0.21-0.95).", 
    "244": "Statin use is associated with improved long-term outcome at 12 months after ICH. This finding supports previous clinical studies that have shown the short-term benefits of statin therapy. In addition, this study correlates with animal studies supporting the possible long-term recovery benefits of statins."
