This is an update of a review first published in 2009.", 
    "1": "We aimed to evaluate the benefits (reductions in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, major cardiovascular events, myocardial infarction and stroke, and progression of CKD to requiring dialysis) and harms (muscle or liver dysfunction, withdrawal, cancer) of statins compared to placebo, no treatment, standard care, or another statin in adults with CKD who have a functioning kidney transplant.",

Treatment effects were expressed as mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes (lipids, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), proteinuria) and relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes (major cardiovascular events, mortality, fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal or non-fatal stroke, elevated muscle or liver enzymes, withdrawal due to adverse events, cancer, end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), acute allograft rejection) together with 95% confidence intervals (CI).", 
    "5": "We identified 22 studies (3465 participants); 17 studies (3282 participants) compared statin with placebo or no treatment, and five studies (183 participants) compared two different statin regimens.From data generally derived from a single high-quality study, it was found that statins may reduce major cardiovascular events (1 study, 2102 participants: RR 0.84, CI 0.66 to 1.06), cardiovascular mortality (4 studies, 2322 participants: RR 0.68, CI 0.45 to 1.01), and fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction (1 study, 2102 participants: RR 0.70, CI 0.48 to 1.01); although effect estimates lack precision and include the possibility of no effect.Statins had uncertain effects on all-cause mortality (6 studies, 2760 participants: RR 1.08, CI 0.63 to 1.83); fatal or non-fatal stroke (1 study, 2102 participants: RR 1.18, CI 0.85 to 1.63); creatine kinase elevation (3 studies, 2233 participants: RR 0.86, CI 0.39 to 1.89); liver enzyme elevation (4 studies, 608 participants: RR 0.62, CI 0.33 to 1.19); withdrawal due to adverse events (9 studies, 2810 participants: RR 0.89, CI 0.74 to 1.06); and cancer (1 study, 2094 participants: RR 0.94, CI 0.82 to 1.07).Statins significantly reduced serum total cholesterol (12 studies, 3070 participants: MD -42.43 mg/dL, CI -51.22 to -33.65); low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (11 studies, 3004 participants: MD -43.19 mg/dL, CI -52.59 to -33.78); serum triglycerides (11 studies, 3012 participants: MD -27.28 mg/dL, CI -34.29 to -20.27); and lowered high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (11 studies, 3005 participants: MD -5.69 mg/dL, CI -10.35 to -1.03).Statins had uncertain effects on kidney function: ESKD (6 studies, 2740 participants: RR 1.14, CI 0.94 to 1.37); proteinuria (2 studies, 136 participants: MD -0.04 g/24 h, CI -0.17 to 0.25); acute allograft rejection (4 studies, 582 participants: RR 0.88, CI 0.61 to 1.28); and GFR (1 study, 62 participants: MD -1.00 mL/min, CI -9.96 to 7.96).Due to heterogeneity in comparisons, data directly comparing differing statin regimens could not be meta-analysed.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of surgical RF ablation in the treatment of AF with the application of ECG teletransmission in monitoring patients during a 6-month follow-up period. Furthermore, clinical and echocardiographic risk factors for arrhythmia recurrences were subject to analysis. As per authors' knowledge and literature review, so far no papers devoted to the assessment of efficacy of surgical RF ablation with the use of systematic ECG teletransmission have been published.",

The mean age of the subjects was 64 \u00b1 9 years. Efficacy of the procedure was monitored with the application of a system enabling transtelephonic transmission of ECG signal. The study cohort was monitored in the period of 6 months. 2198 ECG recordings were obtained for analysis.", 
    "9": "In the post-hospital follow-up period, no recurrences of AF were observed in the case of 40 (65%) subjects. Post-hospital failure of the surgical RF ablation procedure was associated with an early episode of AF during hospitalization (p = 0.0012), application of monopolar electrode (p = 0.0325) as well as with the surgical procedure performed to treat mitral stenosis (p = 0.0268).", 
    "10": "Moreover, it was observed that the group of patients without arrhythmia recurrence in the follow-up period was more frequently administered with antiarrhythmic medications (p = 0.0409) and statin (p = 0.0453) prior to the ablation procedure, with statin being more often applied after the procedure (tendency, p = 0.0747). As opposed to ablation in one atrium, biatrial ablation did not result in fewer late arrhythmia recurrences.",

    "16": "The purpose of this meta-analysis was to detect the association between the cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene polymorphisms and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), carotid atherosclerosis, longevity, and the efficacy of statin therapy. Databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, the Cochrane Library, and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure were systematically searched. Thirty-two studies were included in this meta-analysis. There was no difference in the I405V, C629A, and Taq1B polymorphisms between AD and control groups. However, stratified analysis showed that AD group had higher B2B2 genotype frequency than control group in Asian populations with APOE4+ in Taq1B. I405V and Taq1B polymorphisms were not associated with the risk of carotid atherosclerosis and longevity. The efficacy of statin therapy was not associated with Taq1B polymorphism. In conclusion, there was no association between cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene polymorphisms and the risk of AD, carotid atherosclerosis, longevity, and the efficacy of statin therapy in the pooled effects of overall population. However, the B2B2 genotype of Taq1B was associated with increased risk of AD in the Asian populations with APOE4+.",

The primary objective of the APS Treatment Trends Task Force, created as part of the 14th International Congress on aPL, was to systematically review the potential future treatment strategies for aPL-positive patients. The task force chose as future clinical research directions: a) determining the necessity for controlled clinical trials in venous thromboembolism with the new oral direct thrombin or anti-factor Xa inhibitors pending the results of the ongoing rivaroxaban in APS (RAPS) trial, and designing controlled clinical trials in other forms of thrombotic APS; b) systematically analyzing the literature as well as aPL/APS registries, and creating specific registries for non-warfarin/heparin anticoagulants; c) increasing recruitment for an ongoing primary thrombosis prevention trial, and designing secondary thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity prevention trials with hydroxychloroquine; d) determining surrogate markers to select patients for statin trials; e) designing controlled studies with rituximab and other anti-B-cell agents; f) designing mechanistic and clinical studies with eculizumab and other complement inhibitors; and g) chemically modifying peptide therapy to improve the half-life and minimize immunogenicity. The report also includes recommendations for clinicians who consider using these agents in difficult-to-manage aPL-positive patients.",

No relationship was observed between increasing quartiles of MPO and either baseline (p = 0.81) or serial changes (p = 0.43) in levels of percent atheroma volume (PAV) in non-diabetic patients. In contrast, increasing MPO quartiles were associated with accelerated PAV progression in diabetic patients (p = 0.03). While optimal control of lipid and the use of high-dose statin were associated with less disease progression, a greater benefit was observed in diabetic patients with lower compared with higher MPO levels at baseline.",

    "22": "This EAS Consensus Panel critically appraised evidence relevant to the benefit to risk relationship of functional foods with added plant sterols and/or plant stanols, as components of a healthy lifestyle, to reduce plasma low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, and thereby lower cardiovascular risk.", 
    "23": "Plant sterols/stanols (when taken at 2 g/day) cause significant inhibition of cholesterol absorption and lower LDL-C levels by between 8 and 10%. The relative proportions of cholesterol versus sterol/stanol levels are similar in both plasma and tissue, with levels of sterols/stanols being 500-/10,000-fold lower than those of cholesterol, suggesting they are handled similarly to cholesterol in most cells. Despite possible atherogenicity of marked elevations in circulating levels of plant sterols/stanols, protective effects have been observed in some animal models of atherosclerosis. Higher plasma levels of plant sterols/stanols associated with intakes of 2 g/day in man have not been linked to adverse effects on health in long-term human studies. Importantly, at this dose, plant sterol/stanol-mediated LDL-C lowering is additive to that of statins in dyslipidaemic subjects, equivalent to doubling the dose of statin. The reported 6-9% lowering of plasma triglyceride by 2 g/day in hypertriglyceridaemic patients warrants further evaluation.", 
    "24": "Based on LDL-C lowering and the absence of adverse signals, this EAS Consensus Panel concludes that functional foods with plant sterols/stanols may be considered 1) in individuals with high cholesterol levels at intermediate or low global cardiovascular risk who do not qualify for pharmacotherapy, 2) as an adjunct to pharmacologic therapy in high and very high risk patients who fail to achieve LDL-C targets on statins or are statin- intolerant, 3) and in adults and children (>6 years) with familial hypercholesterolaemia, in line with current guidance. However, it must be acknowledged that there are no randomised, controlled clinical trial data with hard end-points to establish clinical benefit from the use of plant sterols or plant stanols.",

The use of statins was identified from electronic medical records and merged with local National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data. Preoperative statin exposure was defined as statin use before operation, as documented by admission medication reconciliation and outpatient or pharmacy records. The primary end point was major noncardiac complications, and secondary end points included respiratory, infectious (sepsis and organ space infection) and complications of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Multivariable logistic regression was performed for each end point while we controlled for clinical covariates meeting P < .10 on bivariate analysis.",

    "29": "The widely used culinary vegetable, red cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. Var. capitata f. rubra), of the Brassicaceae family contains biologically potent anthocyanins and a myriad of antioxidants. Previous studies have shown that the pharmacological effects of red cabbage in vivo are redox-sensitive. The present study explored whether red cabbage modulates various histopathological and biochemical parameters in rats administered with a cholesterol-rich diet (CRD). To this end, prolonged administration of a lyophilized-aqueous extract of red cabbage (250 and 500 mg/kg body weight) significantly blunted the imbalances in lipids, liver enzymes and renal osmolytes induced by the CRD. The effects of red cabbage were compared to simvastatin (30 mg/kg body weight) treated rats. Estimation of malondialdehyde and non-protein sulfhydryls revealed robust antioxidant properties of red cabbage. Histopathological analysis of livers from rats administered with red cabbage showed marked inhibition in inflammatory and necrotic changes triggered by CRD. Similarly, in vitro studies using a 2',7'-Dichlorofluorescein-based assay showed that red cabbage conferred cytoprotective effects in cultured HepG2 cells. In conclusion, the present study discloses the potential therapeutic effects of red cabbage in dyslipidemia as well as hepatic injury, that is at least, partly mediated by its antioxidant properties.",

Toll-like receptor-4 (tlr-4) expression on blood monocytes was measured using flow cytometry before and after rosuvastatin treatment. Inflammatory molecules were measured before and after rosuvastatin and after blood samples were incubated for 3 hours with or without lipopolysaccharide. Plasma was collected and analyzed for IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, IGF-1, and sCD14.

None of the other inflammatory markers (IL-8, sCD14, IL-6, IGF-1, C-reactive protein) were modified with rosuvastatin treatment. There were significant declines in total cholesterol (p<0.0001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (p<0.0001), and total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio (p<0.0001) after 3 weeks of treatment. There was no significant effect on triglycerides, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), or HDL-C.",

The interaction between statin use and stroke severity was significant both in dependence and death outcome (P\u200a=\u200a0.04 for dependence outcome, P\u200a=\u200a0.03 for death outcome). After stratification by stroke severity, statin use during hospitalization decreased the mortality of stroke (OR, 0.44; 95%CI, 0.31-0.62) and poor functional outcome (OR, 0.73; 95%CI, 0.57-0.92) at 3 months in the non-minor stroke group.",

    "38": "Industry-sponsored clinical drug studies are associated with publication of outcomes that favor the sponsor, even when controlling for potential bias in the methods used. However, the influence of sponsorship bias has not been examined in preclinical animal studies. We performed a meta-analysis of preclinical statin studies to determine whether industry sponsorship is associated with either increased effect sizes of efficacy outcomes and/or risks of bias in a cohort of published preclinical statin studies. We searched Medline (January 1966-April 2012) and identified 63 studies evaluating the effects of statins on atherosclerosis outcomes in animals. Two coders independently extracted study design criteria aimed at reducing bias, results for all relevant outcomes, sponsorship source, and investigator financial ties. The I(2) statistic was used to examine heterogeneity. We calculated the standardized mean difference (SMD) for each outcome and pooled data across studies to estimate the pooled average SMD using random effects models. In a priori subgroup analyses, we assessed statin efficacy by outcome measured, sponsorship source, presence or absence of financial conflict information, use of an optimal time window for outcome assessment, accounting for all animals, inclusion criteria, blinding, and randomization. The effect of statins was significantly larger for studies sponsored by nonindustry sources (-1.99; 95% CI -2.68, -1.31) versus studies sponsored by industry (-0.73; 95% CI -1.00, -0.47) (p value<0.001). Statin efficacy did not differ by disclosure of financial conflict information, use of an optimal time window for outcome assessment, accounting for all animals, inclusion criteria, blinding, and randomization. Possible reasons for the differences between nonindustry- and industry-sponsored studies, such as selective reporting of outcomes, require further study.", 
    "39": "We know that clinical trials sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry are likely to exaggerate benefit and minimise harms. But do these biases extend to their sponsorship of non-human animal research? Using systematic review and meta-analysis Bero and colleagues show that, in the case of statins, things are a little more complicated. While the conclusions of industry-sponsored studies were indeed more enthusiastic than warranted by their data, the data themselves painted a picture more conservative than was seen in non-industry-sponsored studies. This behaviour is consistent with maximising the return on investment, seeking robust data before embarking on a clinical trial, and, once that investment has been made, making every effort to \"prove\" that the drug is safe and effective if this is at all credible. The findings suggest that there is something different about industry-sponsored non-human animal research, perhaps reflecting higher standards than is the case elsewhere. Perhaps the academic community can learn something from our colleagues in the commercial sector.",

Clinical and anthropometrical parameters, lipids, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), serum MMP-7, MMP-8, their inhibitor (TIMP-1), IL-18, hsCRP and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were assayed at baseline in all participants and after 3 months in the DG.",

Importantly, atorvastatin treatment improved lipid profile, significantly reduced the concentrations of MMP-7, MMP-8 and inflammatory markers (p<0.01). Moreover, there was considerable suppression of both MMP-7/TIMP-1 and MMP-8/TIMP-1 ratios (p<0.01). In standard multiple regression analysis, the atorvastatin-induced reduction in MMP-7 was independently associated with LDL and IL-18 downregulation (R(2)=0.648, p=0.017).

    "44": "Extracranial carotid artery stenosis accounts for up to 12 % of stroke, the third leading cause of death in industrialized nations. Carotid stenoses leading to transient or permanent neurologic or retinal symptoms within the preceding 6 months are deemed symptomatic and require prompt noninvasive evaluation and treatment. Preventive medical therapy is standard for symptomatic carotid stenosis and continues to evolve. Landmark trials have proven carotid endarterectomy (CEA) superior to medical therapy for stroke prevention in symptomatic lesions. Modern investigations have proven carotid artery stenting (CAS) non-inferior to CEA, and the strength of the combined data has led to a class I recommendation for CEA or CAS in patients with high grade symptomatic carotid stenosis, provided the risk of perioperative events is acceptable. Evidence-based modern management of symptomatic carotid stenosis is reviewed here.", 
    "45": "Statin treatment prevents cardiovascular diseases probably beyond their lipid-lowering effect. Increasing evidence suggests that statins might increase the risk of new-onset diabetes; however, diabetes is known to increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases. The majority of the literature suggests an increased risk of new-onset diabetes in patients treated with statins in a number of different settings and that the risk appears greatest among the more potent statins. Furthermore, a dose-response curve has been shown between statin treatment and the development of diabetes. Possible mechanisms include muscle insulin resistance, lower expression of GLUT-4 in adipocytes impairing glucose tolerance and suppression of glucose-induced elevation of intracellular Ca(2+) level. However, other side effects have been reported such as increased risk of myotoxicity, increased liver enzymes, cataracts, mood disorders, dementias, hemorrhagic stroke and peripheral neuropathy, which should maybe be added to the increased risk of new-onset diabetes, when considering the risk- benefit ratio of statin treatment.", 
    "46": "This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in high-risk patients with hypercholesterolemia without a history of CVD. Patients who were receiving or started treatment with pravastatin, were followed-up for 2 years. Patients were divided into quartiles according to on-treatment LDL-C. The maximum contrast method based on the Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the relationship between achieved LDL-C and the incidence of CVD. Incidence of CVD was also compared according to whether a number of risk factor targets were achieved. A total 6,229 patients were enrolled, with 4,916 having reported LDL-C values. During the 2 years, 69 cases of CVD (6.7/1000 patient years), including 36 coronary artery disease (CAD) (3.5/1000 patient years) and 28 strokes (2.7/1000 patient years), occurred. The comparison of on-treatment LDL-C level quartiles suggested that the incidence of all CVD decreased linearly as the LDL-C levels decreased. Incidence of CAD showed a curvilinear relationship to LDL-C levels, suggesting some attenuation of risk below LDL-C of 119 mg/dL. The incidence of all CVD and CAD tended to be decreased as the number of achieved risk factor targets increased. In conclusion, through our observational study, it was shown that a linear relationship between the incidence of CVD and LDL-C was observed in high-risk hypercholesterolemic patients. The low incidence of CVD in the present study may be associated with multifactorial management of conventional risk factors including high LDL-C levels. However, prospective, randomized studies are needed to confirm these findings.",

The TOGETHAR trial is a prospective open-label trial designed to assess coronary plaque regression and stabilization with multiple plaque imaging modalities following 52 weeks of pitavastatin treatment (2 mg/day). Coronary plaques were observed in 46 patients with both angioscopy and intravascular ultrasound at baseline and after 52 weeks of drug treatment. We divided these patients into three groups according to their remodeling indices (RI). Group P consisted of patients with a baseline RI >1.05, Group M of patients with a baseline RI of 0.95-1.05, and Group N of patients with a baseline RI <0.95 and then evaluated differences in coronary plaque volume changes and yellow grade among the three groups. In the positive remodeling group, whose remodeling index (RI) exceeded 1.05 at baseline, RI and percent atheroma volume (PAV) were significantly reduced (RI 1.14 \u00b1 0.07 to 1.05 \u00b1 0.10, p = 0.010, PAV 47.3 \u00b1 8.3 to 45.3 \u00b1 7.3 mm(3), p = 0.048). There was no relationship between baseline RI and the change in yellow grade of plaque. RI increased without significant change of PAV or a decrease in lumen volume in group N, with RI below 0.95 at baseline. Plaques with positive remodeling were more likely to have plaque volume regression by pitavastatin than those without in patients with coronary artery disease. Moreover, plaques with positive and negative remodeling were changed into those with intermediate remodeling by pitavastatin. Pitavastatin might induce not only plaque regression or stabilization, but also conformational normalization of vessel structure.",

    "49": "New statin use was studied retrospectively using the database of Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS), a large Israeli health maintenance organization. Statin initiators were defined as MHS members aged \u2265 30 years who first purchased statins between 2000 and 2010. The starting dose was calculated in simvastatin equivalents based on the World Health Organization's daily defined dose index. Persistence was calculated as the percentage of days covered (PDC) with statins during the first year of therapy.", 
    "50": "Statin initiation peaked in 2005 and decreased from 38.6 to 18.6 per 1,000 in the period 2005-2010. The average age at therapy initiation decreased from 58.9 (\u00b1 12.0) to 54.5 (\u00b1 11.7) years, and the average (SD) baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) decreased from 4.2 (\u00b1 1.1) to 4.0 (\u00b1 0.9) mmol/l during the study period. Women were on average 3 years older than men at treatment initiation, with a higher baseline LDL-C. Among statin initiators, the prevalence of ischemic heart disease (IHD) decreased from 17.8 to 6.7 %, and diabetes prevalence increased from 8.6 to 15.7 %, peaking in 2008 (18.0 %). The PDC with statins ranged between 52.9 and 57.7 %. Simvastatin use at initiation increased from 27.5 % in 2000 to >90 % since 2002. Starting dose increased from 18.5 (\u00b1 8.9) to 24.3 (\u00b1 13.7) mg simvastatin equivalent.", 
    "51": "Among the study population, statin initiators were increasingly characterized by a lower cardiovascular risk-namely, younger individuals without IHD and with a lower baseline LDL-C. These trends underscore the important shift towards statin initiation for primary prevention, as well as the need to balance between benefits and the potential side effect of statins.", 
    "52": "Statins are suggested to preserve gallbladder function by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines and preventing cholesterol accumulation in gallbladder epithelial cells. They also affect cross-talk among the nuclear hormone receptors that regulate cholesterol-bile acid metabolism in the nuclei of hepatocytes. However, there is controversy over whether or how statins change the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)alpha, PPARgamma, liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), ABCG5, ABCG8, and 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) which are directly involved in the cholesterol saturation index in bile.", 
    "53": "Human Hep3B cells were cultured on dishes. MTT assays were performed to determine the appropriate concentrations of reagents to be used. The protein expression of PPARalpha and PPARgamma was measured by Western blotting analysis, and the mRNA expression of LXRalpha, FXR, ABCG5, ABCG8 and CYP7A1 was estimated by RT-PCR.", 
    "54": "In cultured Hep3B cells, pravastatin activated PPARalpha and PPARgamma protein expression, induced stronger expression of PPARgamma than that of PPARalpha, increased LXRalpha mRNA expression, activated ABCG5 and ABCG8 mRNA expression mediated by FXR as well as LXRalpha, enhanced FXR mRNA expression, and increased CYP7A1 mRNA expression mediated by the PPARgamma and LXRalpha pathways, together or independently.",

    "56": "Vascular aging is characterized by vascular cell senescence, increased oxidative stress, and endothelial and inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS/iNOS) imbalance, which reduces NO bioavailability and causes endothelial dysfunction. We investigated whether long-term administration of atorvastatin affects endothelial dysfunction and the underlying mechanisms. Aortas from young (2 months), middle-aged (12 months), and old (20 months) control rats that had received a routine diet and from old rats (20 months) that had received a diet mixed with atorvastatin (5 mg/kg/day) for 8 months were investigated. Senescent phenotype, vascular reactivity, superoxide dismutase (SOD), malonyldialdehyde (MDA), total NO, calcium-dependent and -independent NOS activity, and eNOS, iNOS, and sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) expression at the transcriptional and translational levels were assessed in rat aortas. Comparisons between young, middle, and old control rats showed that the senescent phenotype was enhanced in intima and media (p<0.01), and that MDA, calcium-independent NOS activity, and iNOS increased with age (p<0.01), whereas endothelium-dependent relaxation, SOD, NO, calcium-dependent NOS activity, eNOS, the eNOS/iNOS ratio, and SIRT1 declined with age (p<0.01). Compared with old controls, long-term administration of atorvastatin to old rats inhibited the senescent phenotype (p<0.05), improved endothelium-dependent relaxation (p<0.05 or 0.01), decreased MDA (p<0.01), increased SOD, NO, eNOS, and SIRT1 expression (p<0.01), and inhibited iNOS expression (not detectable) in aged rat aortas. The results indicate that the long-term administration of atorvastatin improves age-related endothelial dysfunction in aged rats via inhibition of the senescent phenotype, amelioration of oxidative stress, and normalization of eNOS/iNOS imbalance.", 
    "57": "Statin drugs lower blood cholesterol by inhibiting hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme-A reductase. Statins are known to inhibit sterol production in the testis, but effect of statins on testosterone production has not been studied critically in vitro and clinical data are controversial. We measured 18-h testosterone production in vitro, using highly purified rat Leydig cells exposed to atorvastatin, mevastatin, or simvastatin and also determined if statin-induced inhibition of testosterone production could be bypassed with substrate distal to cholesterol. Statins had no effect on testosterone production during culture without LH. However, with 10ng/mL LH, testosterone production was \u226512-fold higher and markedly inhibited (-40%) by \u22650.3\u03bcM statin. Leydig cells provided sub-saturating pregnenolone or progesterone to bypass the site of statin action, maintained LH-stimulated testosterone production at or above amounts observed with LH stimulation and no statin. Pregnenolone resulted in greater testosterone production, but LH responsiveness was lost. With progesterone, LH responsiveness was maintained.", 
    "58": "Systolic blood pressure (SBP) often varies between clinic visits within individuals, which can affect estimation of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. We analyzed data from participants with two clinic visits separated by a median of 17\u00a0days in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n\u00a0=\u00a0808). Ten-year CVD risk was calculated with SBP obtained at each visit using the Pooled Cohort Equations. The mean age of participants was 46.1\u00a0years, and 47.3% were male. The median SBP difference between the two visits was -1\u00a0mm Hg (1st to 99th percentiles: -23 to 32\u00a0mm Hg). The median estimated 10-year CVD risk was 2.5% and 2.4% at the first and second visit, respectively (1st to 99th percentiles -5.2% to +7.1%). Meaningful risk reclassification (ie, across the guideline recommended 7.5% threshold for statin initiation) occurred in 12 (11.3%) of 106 participants whose estimated CVD risk was between 5% and 10%, but only in two (0.3%) of 702 participants who had a 10-year estimated CVD risk of <5% or >10%. SBP variability can affect CVD risk estimation, and can influence statin eligibility for individuals with an estimated 10-year CVD risk between 5% and 10%.", 
    "59": "The role of statin therapy in prostate cancer (PCa) prevention and treatment is plagued by controversy. This critical review of published clinical series reveals several caveats in earlier studies, which reported no benefit. Recent studies that adjust for confounding factors have demonstrated statin therapy to be associated with PCa prevention and favorable clinical outcomes. Developed as inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis, the expected mechanism of statin action is systemic cholesterol reduction. By lowering circulating cholesterol, statins indirectly reduce cellular cholesterol levels in multiple cell types, impacting on membrane microdomains and steroidogenesis. Although non-cholesterol mechanisms of statin action have been proposed, they are limited by the uncertainties surrounding in vivo tissue statin concentrations.", 
    "60": "Statins are recommended for prevention of progression of cardiovascular disease after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Although high-dose highly efficient statins are recommended, especially in high-risk patients, clinical data are scarce and further investigation in \"real-world\" settings is needed. One thousand five hundred twenty-eight consecutive patients, who underwent PCI for acute coronary syndrome, were included in a prospective registry from January 2003 to January 2011. In post hoc analysis, cardiovascular risk factors, co-morbidities, and circulating lipid parameters at the time of intervention were evaluated. As a primary end point, all-cause mortality after a follow-up period of 3 months was investigated. Results were compared between patients receiving high-dose highly effective statins (atorvastatin 80 mg or rosuvastatin 20 mg) versus patients receiving low-dose statins or who were without lipid-lowering therapy at the time of discharge. Nine hundred twenty-six patients (60.6%) received high-dose atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and 602 patients (39.4%) received low-dose statin therapy or were not on statins at discharge. Eight patients (0.9%) receiving high-dose statin therapy and 21 patients (3.5%) taking low-dose statins or no statins at discharge died during the 3-month follow-up (hazard ratio 0.244, 95% confidence interval 0.108 to 0.551, p=0.001). After propensity score adjustment the results remained significant (adjusted hazard ratio for high-dose statins 0.405, 95% confidence interval 0.176 to 0.931, p=0.033). In conclusion, in this single-center series of 1,528 real-world patients undergoing PCI for acute coronary syndrome, a significant reduction in short-term all-cause mortality could be demonstrated in patients receiving high-dose highly efficient statins compared with patients receiving low-dose statins or no lipid-lowering therapy.",

Median baseline triglycerides were 131 mg/dL (interquartile range 122). By study end, mean total cholesterol and LDL-C in group medical clinics were 14.2 mg/dL (P = .01) and 9.2 mg/dL (P = .02) lower than usual care, respectively; 76% of group medical clinic patients met goals for LDL-C, versus 61% of usual care patients (P = .02). Triglycerides and HDL-C remained similar between study arms.

    "66": "A retrospective analysis of ezetimibe use in Saskatchewan between 2002 and 2011 was carried out using provincial health administrative databases. Overall use and costs of ezetimibe were described over time. Among new users of ezetimibe, the percentage who received the drug as first-line monotherapy was estimated. First-line monotherapy was defined as no statin dispensations in the 365 days before and the 60 days after the first ezetimibe dispensation. Potential predictors of first-line monotherapy were assessed using generalized linear mixed-effect models.", 
    "67": "In 2004, ezetimibe represented 2.5% of cholesterol-lowering dispensations. In 2011, its use increased to 8.8% of cholesterol-lowering dispensations and 13.2% of the total cost of cholesterol-lowering agents. Overall, ezetimibe was used as first-line monotherapy in 23% of all new users (4024 of 17,475 patients). Approximately half of all cases of first-line monotherapy were prescribed by 10.4% (112 of 1074) of prescribers in the cohort. Patients who had experienced previous acute coronary syndrome or who had undergone coronary revascularization procedures were significantly less likely to receive first-line monotherapy.", 
    "68": "A high proportion of ezetimibe's use is not in accordance with evidence-based recommendations. Suboptimal prescribing could partially explain current patterns of use; however, other factors such as medication nonadherence may have played an important role. Restricting ezetimibe use in the provincial formulary in addition to improving prescribers' awareness through academic detailing should be considered.", 
    "69": "Cardiovascular disease poses a major challenge for the 21st century, exacerbated by the pandemics of obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. While best standards of care, including high-dose statins, can ameliorate the risk of vascular complications, patients remain at high risk of cardiovascular events. The Residual Risk Reduction Initiative (R3i) has previously highlighted atherogenic dyslipidaemia, defined as the imbalance between proatherogenic triglyceride-rich apolipoprotein B-containing-lipoproteins and antiatherogenic apolipoprotein A-I-lipoproteins (as in high-density lipoprotein, HDL), as an important modifiable contributor to lipid-related residual cardiovascular risk, especially in insulin-resistant conditions. As part of its mission to improve awareness and clinical management of atherogenic dyslipidaemia, the R3i has identified three key priorities for action: i) to improve recognition of atherogenic dyslipidaemia in patients at high cardiometabolic risk with or without diabetes; ii) to improve implementation and adherence to guideline-based therapies; and iii) to improve therapeutic strategies for managing atherogenic dyslipidaemia. The R3i believes that monitoring of non-HDL cholesterol provides a simple, practical tool for treatment decisions regarding the management of lipid-related residual cardiovascular risk. Addition of a fibrate, niacin (North and South America), omega-3 fatty acids or ezetimibe are all options for combination with a statin to further reduce non-HDL cholesterol, although lacking in hard evidence for cardiovascular outcome benefits. Several emerging treatments may offer promise. These include the next generation peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor\u03b1 agonists, cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors and monoclonal antibody therapy targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9. However, long-term outcomes and safety data are clearly needed. In conclusion, the R3i believes that ongoing trials with these novel treatments may help to define the optimal management of atherogenic dyslipidaemia to reduce the clinical and socioeconomic burden of residual cardiovascular risk.",

    "71": "Two experiments were done, the first one without coenzyme Q10 supplementation. On the second experiment all groups received coenzyme Q10 0.57 mg/day as supplement. After a 6-week treatment animals were sacrificed, blood and liver were analyzed and liver mitochondria were isolated and its oxygen consumption was evaluated in state 3 (phosphorylating state) and state 4 (resting state) in order to calculate the respiratory control (RC).", 
    "72": "HD increased serum and hepatic cholesterol levels in rats with or without CoQ10. ATV reduced these values but CoQ10 improved even more serum and liver cholesterol. Triacylglycerols (TAG) were also lower in blood and liver of rats with ATV + CoQ10. HDL-C decreased in HD rats. Treatment with ATV maintained HDL-C levels. However, these values were lower in HD + CoQ10 compared to control diet (CD) + CoQ10. RC was lessened in liver mitochondria of HD. The administration of ATV increased RC. All groups supplemented with CoQ10 showed an increment in RC. In conclusion, the combined administration of ATV and CoQ10 improved biochemical parameters, liver function and mitochondrial respiration in hypercholesterolemic rats.",

    "74": "Statin drugs are highly effective in lowering blood concentrations of LDL-cholesterol, with concomitant reduction in risk of major cardiovascular events. Although statins are generally regarded as safe and well-tolerated, some users develop muscle symptoms that are mostly mild but in rare cases can lead to life-threatening rhabdomyolysis. The SEARCH genome-wide association study, which has been independently replicated, found a significant association between the rs4149056 (c.521T>C) single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the SLCO1B1 gene, and myopathy in individuals taking 80 mg simvastatin per day, with an odds ratio of 4.5 per rs4149056 C allele. The purpose of this paper is to assemble evidence relating to the analytical validity, clinical validity and clinical utility of using SLCO1B1 rs4149056 genotyping to inform choice and dose of statin treatment, with the aim of minimising statin-induced myopathy and increasing adherence to therapy. Genotyping assays for the rs4149056 SNP appear to be robust and accurate, though direct evidence for the performance of array-based platforms in genotyping individual SNPs was not found. Using data from the SEARCH study, calculated values for the clinical sensitivity, specificity, positive- and negative-predictive values of a test for the C allele to predict definite or incipient myopathy during 5 years of 80 mg/day simvastatin use were 70.4%, 73.7%, 4.1% and 99.4% respectively. There is a need for studies comparing the clinical validity of SLCO1B1 rs4149056 genotyping with risk scores for myopathy based on other factors such as racial background, statin type and dose, gender, body mass index, co-medications and co-morbidities. No direct evidence was found for clinical utility of statin prescription guided by SLCO1B1 genotype.", 
    "75": "This study is a prospective multicenter study designed to investigate the effects of lipid-lowering therapy with pitavastatin on atherosclerotic plaque in patients with coronary heart disease, and to determine which factor is more closely associated with plaque regression. Participants (n = 63) were treated with pitavastatin for 12 months, and the carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) was measured by ultrasound before and after treatment. Mean IMT slightly but significantly decreased (from 0.99 \u00b1 0.33 to 0.94 \u00b1 0.28 mm for overall, P = 0.01) regardless of the presence of pretreatment with other statins. There were no significant relations with hs-CRP, malondialdehyde-LDL, LDL cholesterol, and smaller LDL cholesterol levels despite their decrease by pitavastatin. Decreases in mean IMT were observed significantly more frequently in subjects with high on-treatment HDL cholesterol levels than with low HDL cholesterol levels (P = 0.017). The change in mean IMT tended to be inversely correlated with increments in HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I. The IMT regression was more often observed in the absence of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. In conclusion, we demonstrated that treatment with pitavastatin attenuated atherosclerotic plaque. This effect was associated with the level of HDL cholesterol, and was stronger in the absence of diabetes and metabolic syndrome in our ischemic heart disease patients.", 
    "76": "We compared the effects of lipid lowering with rosuvastatin (RSV) monotherapy versus intensified treatment by combining RSV with ezetimibe (EZT) on kidney function in patients undergoing vascular surgery. Patients were randomly assigned to either 10 mg/d RSV (n = 136) or RSV 10 mg/d plus EZT 10 mg/d (RSV/EZT, n = 126). At 12 months, a similar decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was noted. Patients who achieved a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of <100 mg/dL had less eGFR decrease than those patients having an LDL-C limit of more than 100 mg/dL. There were no significant changes in the urinary total protein to creatinine ratio in either group. Significant microalbuminuria was evident in both the groups. Patients undergoing vascular surgery show deterioration in their renal function during the first year, despite statin therapy. Intensified lipid-lowering therapy by adding EZT does not appear to have any renoprotective effect.",

Self-awareness was low: 8% for CKD, 73% for diabetes, and 45% for hypercholesterolemia. Overall, 31% of patients with hypertension did not meet BP goals, and many received fewer antihypertensive drugs than appropriately controlled individuals; 41% of patients with diabetes failed to meet treatment targets. Among those patients with a moderate or high Framingham risk score, 53% of patients had LDL levels above the recommended levels, and many patients were not receiving a statin.

Recently, we demonstrated that GC-resistance is associated with a proliferative metabolism involving the up-regulation of glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation and cholesterol biosynthesis. Here we confirm that resistance is directly associated with a glycolytic phenotype and show that GC-resistant T-ALL cells are able to shift between glucose bioenergetic pathways. We evaluated the potential for targeting these pathways in vitro using a glycolysis inhibitor, 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), and the oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor oligomycin in combination with methylprednisolone (MPRED). We found that oligomycin synergized with MPRED to sensitize cells otherwise resistant to GCs. Similarly we observed synergy between MPRED and simvastatin, an inhibitor of cholesterol metabolism. Collectively, our findings suggest that dual targeting of bioenergetic pathways in combination with GCs may offer a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome drug resistance in ALL.",

    "100": "Animal models of obesity show that lipid deposits can injure the kidneys,and there is evidence for the role of lipids in the development of chronic renal dis-ease (CKD). Statins exhibit a lipid-lowering effect that acts on both total cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) levels and pleiotropic effects including their ability to reduce inflammation and fibrosis. The purpose of the present study was to confirm whether obesity induced by a high-fat diet (HFD, 60% fat) promotes lipid accumulation in the tubulointerstitial and/or glomerular areas in the kidney, and whether treatment of several statins, pravastatin (30 mg/kg, p.o.), rosuvastatin (3 mg/kg, p.o.),pitavastatin (1 mg/kg, p.o.) and atorvastatin (10 mg/kg, p.o.), suppresses obesity-induced lipid accumulation. Using male C57Bl/6J mice, we examined parameters related to energy metabolism, lipid accumulation as well as macrophage infiltration in glomeruli and the tubulointerstitial area, and glomerular injury using nephrin and desmin expression. None of the statins affected body weight, glucose metabolism,serum TG and adiponectin levels, or serum inflammatory cytokine levels. However,all statins improved lipid accumulation in the proximal tubules, improved glomerular hypertrophy, increased nephrin expression and decreased desmin expression, compared to non-treated obese animals. Moreover, the reduction of proximal tubular lipid accumulation was greater with pravastatin and rosuvastatin treatment than with pitavastatin and atorvastatin treatment. We concluded that hydrophilic statins may be more effective for preventing lipid accumulation in renal tubules than lipophilic statins.",

Employing essentially non-prostate cell lines, we previously showed that statins rapidly downregulate nuclear levels of phosphorylated Akt via P2X7, a purinergic receptor recently implicated in invasive growth. Here, we present studies on phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN)-positive prostatic cells. We document an involvement of EH domain-binding protein 1 (EHBP1), previously associated with aggressive prostate cancer and insulin-stimulated trafficking and cell migration, in P2X7 signaling. We also show that EHBP1 is essential for an anti-invasive effect of atorvastatin. Furthermore, EHBP1 interacted with P-Rex1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor previously implicated in invasive growth. Mevalonate did not prevent this anti-invasive effect of atorvastatin. These data indicate that atorvastatin modulates invasiveness via P2X7, EHBP1 and P-Rex1. Interestingly, the interaction between EHBP1 and P-Rex1 was not induced by extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the endogenous P2X7 ligand, and statins counteracted invasiveness stimulated by extracellular ATP. In support of these experimental data, a population-based genetic analysis showed that a loss of function allele in the P2X7 gene (rs3751143) associated with non-aggressive cancer, and the common allele with aggressive cancer.

We found that patients who were statin users were 0.81 (95% CI 0.74-0.89), 0.80 (95% CI 0.71-0.89), 0.84 (95% CI 0.75-0.94) and 0.69 times (95% CI 0.57-0.85) less likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit, to have acute respiratory failure, to need mechanical ventilation, and to die in the hospital, respectively, than patients who were not statin users. In addition, it consistently revealed that compared with patients who were not statin users, regular statin users had lower ORs of intensive care unit admission, acute respiratory failure, the use of mechanical ventilation and in-hospital death. However, there were no significant differences in the above adverse outcomes between irregular users of statin and non-statin users. We concluded that patients with regular previous statin use were significantly associated with favourable outcomes during admission for pneumonia in Taiwan.",

    "145": "The mevalonate pathway is used by cells to produce sterol and nonsterol metabolites and is subject to tight metabolic regulation. We recently reported that squalene monooxygenase (SM), an enzyme controlling a rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis, is subject to cholesterol-dependent proteasomal degradation. However, the E3-ubiquitin (E3) ligase mediating this effect was not established. Using a candidate approach, we identify the E3 ligase membrane-associated RING finger 6 (MARCH6, also known as TEB4) as the ligase controlling degradation of SM. We find that MARCH6 and SM physically interact, and consistent with MARCH6 acting as an E3 ligase, its overexpression reduces SM abundance in a RING-dependent manner. Reciprocally, knockdown of MARCH6 increases the level of SM protein and prevents its cholesterol-regulated degradation. Additionally, this increases cell-associated SM activity but is unexpectedly accompanied by increased flux upstream of SM. Prompted by this observation, we found that knockdown of MARCH6 also controls the level of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) in hepatocytes and model cell lines. In conclusion, MARCH6 controls abundance of both SM and HMGCR, establishing it as a major regulator of flux through the cholesterol synthesis pathway.",

With the increasing use of statins, numerous reports demonstrated that statins can cause damage to skeletal muscles. However, the toxicities of statins on vascular smooth muscle, which are essential to cardiovascular homeostasis, have not been previously described. Here, we examined the effects of simvastatin on the contractile function and the integrity of vascular smooth muscle in isolated rat thoracic aortic rings, primary cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in vitro and rats in vivo. In aortic rings, simvastatin suppressed the normal agonist-induced contractile responses in time- and concentration-dependent manners (0.86 g \u00b1 0.11 at 10 \u03bcM simvastatin for 24 h compared with 1.89 g \u00b1 0.11 at control). The suppression persisted in the endothelium-denuded aortic rings and was irreversible even after wash-out of simvastatin. Simvastatin suppressed the contraction induced by Bay K8644, an activator of voltage-operated Ca\u00b2\u207a channel (VOCC) in rat aortic rings and abolished agonist-induced intracellular Ca\u00b2\u207a increase in VSMCs. The simvastatin-induced contractile dysfunction was reversed by the supplementation of mevalonate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, precursors for protein isoprenylation. Consistently, activation of RhoA, a representative isoprenylated protein, was disrupted by simvastatin in VSMCs and RhoA-mediated phosphorylation of MYPT1 and CPI-17, and tonic tension were also suppressed. Notably, prolonged treatment of simvastatin up to 48 h induced apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle in aortic rings. Most importantly, simvastatin treatment in vivo significantly attenuated the agonist-induced vasoconstriction in rats ex vivo and induced a decrease in luminal area of the vascular wall. Collectively, these results demonstrate that simvastatin can impair the normal vascular contractility by disturbing Ca\u00b2\u207a influx and RhoA activity, ultimately leading to apoptosis and structural remodeling.",

Since the pharmacokinetic mechanism(s) of the interaction is unknown, the present study aimed to clarify the drug interaction potential of ELT at transporters. The OATP1B1-mediated uptake of ELT was inhibited by several therapeutic agents used to treat lifestyle diseases. Among them, rosuvastatin was a potent inhibitor with an IC(50) of 0.05 \u00b5M, which corresponds to one-seventh of the calculated maximum unbound rosuvastatin concentration at the inlet to the liver. Nevertheless, a simulation study using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model predicted that the effect of rosuvastatin on the pharmacokinetic profile of ELT in vivo would be minimal. On the other hand, ELT potently inhibited uptake of rosuvastatin by OATP1B1 and human hepatocytes, with an IC(50) of 0.1 \u00b5M. However, the results of the simulation study indicated that inhibition of OATP1B1 by ELT can only partially explain the clinically observed interaction with rosuvastatin. ELT also inhibited transcellular transport of rosuvastatin in MDCKII cells stably expressing breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and was found to be a substrate of BCRP. The interaction of ELT with rosuvastatin can be almost quantitatively explained on the assumption that intestinal secretion of rosuvastatin is essentially completely inhibited by ELT.

In conclusion, patients with ACS in low/middle-income countries were less likely to be revascularized and to receive evidence-based medications at discharge. Further studies are needed to understand the underutilization of procedures and evidence-based medications in low/middle-income countries.", 
    "198": "Dyslipidemias are frequently found in children due to obesity, bad eating habits and the lack of physical exercises. Rosuvastatin acts as an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, decreasing total cholesterol and triglycerides. This study aimed to investigate initial sexual development and morphological aspect of the testis and epididymis in juvenile rats exposed to rosuvastatin since pre-puberty. Three groups were formed with newly weaned rats: control, whose rats received saline solution 0.9%, rosuvastatin at doses of 3 or 10 mg/kg daily by gavage, since post-natal day 21 until puberty onset. In the rosuvastatin-treated groups, the results demonstrated a trend toward a decrease in testosterone concentration, but below the significance level, as well as delays in both the age of puberty onset and in epididymal development. There were also testicular alterations that might be related to delayed puberty and decrease of serum testosterone. In conclusion, rosuvastatin administration to juvenile rats not only delayed puberty onset and epididymal development, but also impaired testicular and epididymal morphology.", 
    "199": "Many patients undergoing vascular surgical procedures are not on appropriate medical therapy. This study sought to examine the variation and impact of antiplatelet (AP) and statin therapy on early and late mortality in patients undergoing vascular surgery in our region.", 
    "200": "We studied all patients (n = 14,489) undergoing elective carotid endarterectomy (n = 6978), carotid stenting (n = 524), and suprainguinal (n = 763) and infrainguinal bypass (n = 3053), as well as patients with known coronary risk factors undergoing open (n = 1044) and endovascular (n = 2127) abdominal aortic aneurysm repair from 2005 to 2012 in the Vascular Study Group of New England. Optimal medical management was defined as treatment with both AP and statin agents, preoperatively and at discharge. We analyzed temporal, procedural, and center variation of medication use. Multivariable analyses were used to determine the adjusted impact of AP and statin therapy on 30-day mortality and 5-year survival.", 
    "201": "Optimal medical management improved over the study interval (55% in 2005 to 68% in 2012; P trend < .01) with carotid interventions having the highest rates of optimal medications use (carotid artery stenting, 78%; carotid endarterectomy, 74%) and abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in patients with known cardiac risk factors having the lowest (open, 57%; endovascular aneurysm repair, 56%). Optimal medication use varied by center as well (range, 40%-86%). Preoperative AP and statin use was associated with reduced 30-day mortality (odds ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-1.05; P = .09). AP and statin prescription at discharge was additive in survival benefit with improved 5-year survival (hazard ratio, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.4-0.7; P < .01) that was consistent across procedure types. Patients prescribed AP and statin at discharge had 5-year survival of 79% (95% CI, 77%-81%) compared with only 61% (95% CI, 52%-68%; P < .001) for patients on neither medication.", 
    "202": "AP and statin therapy preoperatively and at discharge was associated with reduced 30-day mortality and an absolute 18% improved 5-year survival after vascular surgery. However, one-third of patients are suboptimally managed in real world practice. This demonstrates an opportunity for quality improvement that can substantially improve survival after vascular surgery.", 
    "203": "Statin therapy has affected glucose homoeostasis of type 2 diabetes patients, which could be related with bile acids metabolism. Whether bile acid metabolism and the expression of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), liver X receptor-\u03b1 (LXR-\u03b1) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (Srebp)-1c is regulated by hyperglycemia, or whether simvastatin therapy led to higher glucose is related with down-regulated expression of FXR in diabetic rats remained unclear.", 
    "204": "Forty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: normal control rats, insulin resistance rats, diabetic model rats, and the late simvastatin induced diabetic rats. Normal control rats were fed with standard diet, others were fed with high-fat diet. Diabetic model rats were induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ). The late simvastatin induced diabetic rats started simvastatin administration after STZ induced diabetic model rats. Characteristics of fasting blood glucose (FPG), lipid files and total bile acids (TBAs) were measured and the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed after overnight fasting at the eighth weekend. RNA and protein levels of FXR, LXR-\u03b1 and Srebp-1c were tested by Western blotting and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).", 
    "205": "The insulin resistance rats showed higher glucose, lipid files and lower expression of FXR compared with normal control rats (P > 0.05). The diabetic model rats showed significantly higher glucose, lipid files, TBA and lower expression of FXR compared with insulin resistance rats (P < 0.05). The late simvastatin induced diabetic rats displayed higher glucose and TBA and lower expression of FXR compared with diabetic model rats (P < 0.05).", 
    "206": "Changes in bile acid homeostasis, including the alterations of bile acid levels and bile acid receptors, are either a cause or a consequence of the metabolic disturbances observed during diabetic models. Statin therapy induced hyperglycemia may be related with FXR, SHP, LXR-\u03b1 and Srebp-1 pathways.", 
    "207": "Capsular warning syndrome (CWS) is rare (1.5% of TIA presentations) but has a poor prognosis (7-day stroke risk of 60%). Up to date, the exact pathogenic mechanism of CWS has not been fully understood. We report the clinical presentations and high-resolution MRI (HR MRI) findings of two cases with capsular warning symptoms.", 
    "208": "Case 1 was a 63-year-old man with a history of hypertension with recurrent episodes of left hemiparesis and dysarthria lasting 10 ~ 30 minutes. Case 2 was a 54-year-old woman with repetitive episodes of transient left hemiparesis and dysarthria lasting about 10 minutes. Capsular infarctions on DWI were demonstrated in the territory of a lenticulostriate artery in both 2 patients. HR MRI disclosed atherosclerotic plaques on the ventral wall of the MCA where enticulostriate arteries were arisen from, although traditional digital subtraction angiography showed normal. Aggressive medical therapy with dual antithrombotic agents and statin was effective in these two cases.", 
    "209": "Our HR MRI data offer an insight into the pathophysiology of CWS which might be caused by atherosclerotic plaque in non-stenotic MCA wall. HR MRI might be a useful modality for characterizing atherosclerotic plaques in the MCA and detecting the pathophysiology of the CWS.", 
    "210": "Despite issues about the value of statins, benefit for high cardiovascular (CV) risk outweighs problems. However, the practitioner must be aware of concerns, be prepared to respond, and justify statin usage. Symptoms of statin-related myopathy are of more concern than stated by pharmaceutical companies. Occurrence of myopathy symptoms, estimated to be up to 10.4%, can decrease statin adherence of high CV risk patients. Dosage modification, or use of pitavastatin, may help the problematic patient. There are concerns that there may be little benefit of statins for primary prevention in women. However, evidence appears to support statin use in women at high CV risk, both in primary and secondary prevention. Abandoning low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) as a valid target is unwarranted; there is much evidence to support \"lower is better.\" The practitioner must be aware of the complicated processes causing atherosclerosis and when to incorporate new approaches to disease management. Tailoring therapy for CV risk, when indicated, may contribute further to LDL-C reduction. Liver inflammation can occur with statins but is of minimal concern; frequently, statins alleviate the problem. Unless liver transaminases are over three times normal, a statin should be prescribed, if indicated. The net effect of statins on cognition appears to be zero-no harm, no benefit. Despite reports of improved cognition, statins should not be prescribed for this. With diabetes mellitus (DM), statins can increase incidence, but the CV benefit far outweighs any risk. Therefore, statins should be prescribed in DM to reduce CV risk. Statins are a major medical contribution when used appropriately.", 
    "211": "Hypertension often coexists with dyslipidemia, accentuating cardiovascular risk. Statins are often prescribed in hypertensive individuals to lower cardiovascular risk. Higher fitness is associated with lower mortality, but exercise capacity may be attenuated in hypertension. The combined effects of fitness and statin therapy in hypertensive individuals have not been assessed. Thus, we assessed the combined health benefits of fitness and statin therapy in hypertensive male subjects.", 
    "212": "Peak exercise capacity was assessed in 10,202 hypertensive male subjects (mean age = 60.4 \u00b1 10.6 years) in 2 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. We established 4 fitness categories based on peak metabolic equivalents (METs) achieved and 8 categories based on fitness status and statin therapy.", 
    "213": "During the follow-up period (median = 10.2 years), there were 2,991 deaths. Mortality risk was 34% lower (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.66; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.59-0.74; P < 0.001) among individuals treated with statins compared with those not on statins. The fitness-related mortality risk association was inverse and graded regardless of statin therapy status. Risk reduction associated with exercise capacity of 5.1-8.4 METs was similar to that observed with statin therapy. However, those achieving \u22658.5 METs had 52% lower risk (HR = 0.48; 95% CI = 0.37-0.63) when compared with the least-fit subjects (\u22645 METs) on statin therapy.", 
    "214": "The combination of statin therapy and higher fitness lowered mortality risk in hypertensive individuals more effectively than either alone. The risk reduction associated with moderate increases in fitness was similar to that achieved by statin therapy. Higher fitness was associated with 52% lower mortality risk when compared with the least fit subjects on statin therapy.",

    "216": "National hospitalisation, mortality and pharmaceutical dispensing data were linked for all subjects aged 35-84 years discharged from a public hospital with an ACS in New Zealand in 2007. A Medication Possession Ratio (MPR; percentage of follow-up days patients were dispensed statins) was calculated for each patient. Adequate maintenance was defined by a MPR \u226580%.", 
    "217": "In 2007, 11 348 patients aged 35-84 years were discharged from hospital with ACS. Within 90 days of discharge, 83% had received a statin. Over the follow-up period, 66% were adequately maintained on a statin (MPR \u226580%): 69% in the first year, 67% in the second year and 66% in the third year. Patients taking statins prior to admission and those who underwent a coronary procedure were 20-50% more likely to have a MPR \u226580% over 3 years than others. In contrast, people aged 35-45 years and those of Maori or Pacific ethnicity were 13-25% less likely to have a MPR \u226580% than those aged 55-64 years and Europeans.", 
    "218": "One-third of patients were not adequately maintained on statins over the 3-year period following ACS, but 82% of those on a statin prior to admission had an MPR \u226580% over 3 years of follow-up. These findings define achievable treatment levels and identify groups who may benefit from efforts to improve statin use.", 
    "219": "Statins, or 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme\u00a0A reductase inhibitors, such as lovastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, rosuvastatin and pitavastatin, are cholesterol-lowering drugs used in clinical practice to prevent coronary heart disease. These drugs are generally well tolerated and have been rarely associated with severe adverse effects (e.g. rhabdomyolysis). Over the years, case series and data from national registries of spontaneous adverse drug reaction reports have demonstrated the occurrence of neuropsychiatric reactions associated with statin treatment. They include behavioural alterations (severe irritability, homicidal impulses, threats to others, road rage, depression and violence, paranoia, alienation, antisocial behaviour); cognitive and memory impairments; sleep disturbance (frequent awakenings, shorter sleep duration, early morning awakenings, nightmares, sleepwalking, night terrors); and sexual dysfunction (impotence and decreased libido). Studies designed to investigate specific neuropsychiatric endpoints have yielded conflicting results. Several mechanisms, mainly related to inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis, have been proposed to explain the detrimental effects of statins on the central nervous system. Approaches to prevent and manage such adverse effects may include drug discontinuation and introduction of dietary restrictions; maintenance of statin treatment for some weeks with close patient monitoring; switching to a different statin; dose reduction; use of \u03c9-3\u00a0fatty acids or coenzyme\u00a0Q10 supplements; and treatment with psychotropic drugs. The available information suggests that neuropsychiatric effects associated with statins are rare events that likely occur in sensitive patients. Additional data are required, and further clinical studies are needed.", 
    "220": "Evidence indicates that a healthy lifestyle can reduce cardiovascular disease risk, yet many people engage in unhealthy behaviors. New technologies such as coronary artery calcium (CAC) screening detect atherosclerosis before clinical disease is manifested. Knowledge of an abnormal finding could provide the \"teachable moment\" to enhance motivation for change.", 
    "221": "The aim of this study was to examine how knowledge of CAC score affects risk perception, likelihood of taking action, and health-promoting behavior change in persons at high risk for cardiovascular disease.", 
    "222": "This study used a descriptive prospective design with 174 high-risk adults (\u22653 major risk factors) recruited at a radiology center offering CAC scans. Baseline self-report surveys using the Perception of Risk of Heart Disease Scale, the Benefits and Barriers Scale, the Quality of Life Index, and the Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II were completed immediately after a screening CAC scan but before results were known. Follow-up occurred 3 months later using mailed packets.", 
    "223": "Participants' mean age was 58 years; 62% were men, 89% were white, and most were well educated. There was no significant change in risk perception scores over time or between groups, except for a positive interaction in the moderate-risk group (CAC scores of 101-400) (P = .004). Quality of life remained unchanged. Health-promoting behavior changes increased in all groups over time (P < .001). McNemar \u03c7\u00b2 analysis indicated that risk reduction medication use increased in all groups, with a significant increase in statin (P < .001) and aspirin (P < .001) intake. Predictors of behavior change were perceived barriers (\u03b2 = -.41; P < .001) and quality of life (\u03b2 = .44; P < .001).", 
    "224": "Knowledge of CAC score does impact risk perception for some at-risk groups. This knowledge does enhance motivation for behavior change. Knowledge of CAC score does not impact quality of life. It is hoped that through improved understanding of the effect of CAC scoring on behavior change, nurses can better assist patients to modify behaviors during teachable moments.", 
    "225": "The blood flow in the arteriovenous (AV) fistula is significantly reduced in diabetic patients. Statins are known to mediate pleiotropic effects in the vascular endothelium and attenuate inflammatory responses. This study tested the vascular protective effect of rosuvastatin in an experimental model of AV fistula.", 
    "226": "One week after the induction of diabetes mellitus (DM) in rats, a fistula was created in the abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava. Rats received placebo or rosuvastatin (15 mg/kg/day) in chow for 2 weeks. The blood flow in the venous segments of the fistula was measured. The expression of proinflammatory genes and the generation of superoxide in the venous fistula were examined.", 
    "227": "The blood flow and luminal diameter of the AV fistula was significantly enhanced in animals treated with rosuvastatin. Rosuvastatin attenuated the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, NADPH oxidase, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 in the fistula. The levels of superoxide anions and proinflammatory cytokines were also suppressed in rosuvastatin-treated animals. Neointimal formation in the AV fistula was not affected following treatment with rosuvastatin.", 
    "228": "We demonstrated that rosuvastatin improves luminal dilatation and blood flow in the AV fistula of subjects with DM. These vascular protective effects of rosuvastatin are most likely mediated by the attenuation of proinflammatory activities in the remodeled vasculature.",

    "230": "Patients with unstable angina were randomized to pretreatment with either an intensive dose (80 mg/day, n = 33) or a conventional dose (20 mg/day, n = 33) of atorvastatin. Circulating CD4+ T cells were subsequently obtained prior to PCI, and also 18-24 h after PCI, using a magnetic cell sorting system. Fluorescence-based quantitative real-time PCR was then used to measure levels of PDCD4 mRNA in the isolated CD4+ T lymphocytes, and Western blot analysis was used to detect levels of PDCD4. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-10 and TNF-\u03b1 were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.", 
    "231": "Of the 66 patients with unstable angina that were examined, levels of PDCD4 mRNA and protein were found to dramatically decrease in patients who received an intensive dose of atorvastatin following PCI (p < 0.05). In contrast, serum levels of TNF-\u03b1 significantly increased following PCI in both the intensive dose group and the conventional dose group, with the latter being higher than the former (p < 0.05). Serum IL-10 levels also markedly increased following PCI for the two groups. However, higher values were associated with the intensive dose group (p < 0.05).", 
    "232": "Intensive atorvastatin treatment reduced the post-PCI myocardial inflammatory response in patients with unstable angina, possibly by inhibiting PDCD4 expression in CD4+ T lymphocytes.", 
    "233": "Aortic valve stenosis is the most common native valve disease and its most common cause in the United States and Europe is the calcification of a normal trileaflet. Recently, there is increasing evidence indicating that valve calcification has common underlying mechanisms with atherosclerosis. This connection raises interest in the potential efficacy of antiatherosclerosis medications in calcific valve stenosis (AS) therapy. Among them statins, are one of the most promising candidates, because of their pleiotropic effects. The aim of this review is to summarize and analyze the findings of contemporary studies and to discuss the rationale for statin usage in AS populations."
