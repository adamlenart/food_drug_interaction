    "0": "Diabetes mellitus is associated with hyperlipidemia and increased risk of atherosclerosis. A diabetic animal model has been developed to study the effect of treatment with pravastatin, a potent HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, on plasma lipoprotein levels. Hypercholesterolemia was induced in alloxan diabetic and control rabbits by feeding a diet containing 25% casein and 10% hydrogenated coconut oil for 8 weeks. Feeding the casein-coconut oil diet to the diabetic group resulted in a 5-fold increase in serum cholesterol levels, which was not statistically different from the nondiabetic group fed this diet. However, in the diabetic group, there was more cholesterol in the VLDL fraction and less in LDL as compared to the nondiabetic group. Serum triacylglycerol levels in the diabetic rabbits were variable and ranged from 58-943 mg/dl. The diabetic and nondiabetic animals were then treated with pravastatin at a dose of 10 mg/kg per day for 21 days. In the nondiabetic group, pravastatin treatment significantly lowered serum and LDL cholesterol concentrations by 28.5% (52.3 mg/dl, P less than 0.05) and 36.2% (40.7 mg/dl, P less than 0.05) respectively, relative to the placebo group. Serum and VLDL triacylglycerol levels in the nondiabetic group were also significantly decreased following pravastatin treatment. In the diabetic group, serum and LDL cholesterol levels were decreased by 37.0% (69.1 mg/dl, P less than 0.05) and 52.7% (32.1 mg/dl, P less than 0.01), respectively, relative to the diabetics given the placebo. Pravastatin treatment did not adversely affect serum glucose levels. Thus, pravastatin treatment was effective in controlling the hypercholesterolemia present in these diabetic animals.", 
    "1": "With use of a model of the costs and effects of cholesterol lowering therapy in the primary prevention of coronary heart disease, the cost-effectiveness of simvastatin and cholestyramine in the Netherlands have been estimated. Costs per year of life saved by cholestyramine therapy are several times greater than those of simvastatin therapy and compared unfavorably with those of generally accepted health care programs in the Netherlands. Cholesterol-lowering with simvastatin in men can be cost-effective when therapy is initiated at an early age. At cholesterol levels between 6.5 and 8 mmol/l, however, therapy should be restricted to men with at least one, preferably two additional risk factors such as hypertension or diabetes mellitus. Among women, cholesterol lowering can only be cost-effective when therapy is limited to women with diabetes mellitus or severely elevated serum cholesterol levels.", 
    "2": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor simvastatin, reduced low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in hypercholesterolaemic patients by 40% (P less than 0.001). The reduction in LDL cholesterol was accompanied by a significant decrease in the esterified/free cholesterol ratio of the patients' LDL from 2.51 +/- 0.13 to 2.06 +/- 0.14 (P less than 0.01). This change led to a significant increase (P less than 0.05) in the capacity of the LDL to suppress [14C]acetate incorporation into cholesterol in mononuclear leucocytes. Furthermore, [14C]acetate incorporation into the patients mononuclear leucocytes was significantly lower (P less than 0.02) following drug treatment (117 +/- 22 vs. 162 +/- 29 nmol/mg cell protein). Comparison of simvastatin with another HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor pravastatin, showed similar reduction in LDL cholesterol. Pravastatin treatment however, did not result in a reduction in the LDL esterified/free cholesterol ratio or in the changes in cellular cholesterol synthesis and its regulation by LDL which accompanied simvastatin treatment. The activity of the enzyme acyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) in patients' mononuclear cells remained unchanged after treatment with either drug. Results of the study show that while the drugs are equally effective in lowering LDL cholesterol, simvastatin has additional compositional effects on LDL which increase its capacity to regulate mononuclear leucocyte cholesterologenesis.", 
    "3": "Most hypolipidemic agents have been developed to reduce to normal high plasma concentrations of low density lipoprotein (LDL), the most atherogenic substance in human plasma. Various agents work with many different mechanisms, some of which are not understood. Mechanistic studies are helpful--e.g., for understanding of the various effects of treatment, elucidating regulatory disturbances in different hyperlipidemias and selecting treatment for patients' specific problems. This paper assesses some of the agents that reduce the concentration of LDL focusing on various mechanistic pathways.", 
    "4": "The efficacy and tolerability of lovostatin (L) and bezafibrate (B) were compared in a total of 39 patients, 24 males and 15 females, 59 +/- 9 years old. Showing a total serum cholesterol superior to 250 mg/dl and total serum triglycerides inferior to 350 mg/dl, after 1 month on a low cholesterol diet and another on placebo, were eligible for participation. After randomization 19 treated with L started with 20 or 40 mg at night according to baseline cholesterol under or above 300 respectively and 20 with B received 200 mg tid. If after 6 weeks of therapy cholesterol remained above 200, the doses of L or matching placebo in those with B was double while dose of B or matching placebo remained constant. Cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol were determined using an enzymatic analytical method. Apolipoproteins were obtained by radial immunodiffusion. Routine hematological analysis and blood chemistry safety tests were performed at baseline and every 6 weeks during active treatment. The average most important results, after 12 weeks of treatment, comparing L vs B were: 1) cholesterol was reduced 26 vs 10% (p less than 0.001); 2) LDL-cholesterol decreased 35 vs 15% (p less than 0.001); 3) HDL-cholesterol increased 5 vs 19% (p = NS); 4) triglycerides diminished 15 vs 18% (p = NS). Three patients in L and 1 in B showed adverse events and two of them, one each group, were drop-out. In summary: a) L was more effective lowering total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol; b) B was more potent decreasing triglycerides and increasing HDL-cholesterol; c) both drugs showed good tolerability.", 
    "5": "The efficacy of lovastatin and simvastatin, competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase, was investigated in 40 hemodialysis (HD) patients displaying hypercholesterolemia and moderate hypertriglyceridemia (selection of 40 patients required screening of 700 hemodialysis patients). After a four-week placebo period, lovastatin or simvastatin was administered to two groups of 20 patients in increasing doses over a period of three months. Thirty-six patients completed the study. Lovastatin (1st month 20 mg; 2nd and 3rd months 40 mg day-1) and simvastatin (1st month 10 mg, 2nd month 20 mg and 3rd month 40 mg day-1) reduced total serum cholesterol from 280.3 +/- 9.4 to 213.0 +/- 6.7 (-24%) and 295.0 +/- 12.2 to 202.3 +/- 8.9 mg/dl (-31.4%), LDL cholesterol from 161.9 +/- 10.7 to 112.1 +/- 7.9 (-30.8%) and 181.8 +/- 14.7 to 107.4 +/- 8.1 mg/dl (-40.9%), as well as apolipoprotein B (apo B) from 116.0 +/- 6.6 to 83.3 +/- 3.7 (-28.2%) and 134.4 +/- 8.2 to 84.1 +/- 5.3 mg/dl (-37.4%), respectively. Furthermore, the ratio of LDL apo B/LDL cholesterol increased significantly (0.63 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.71 +/- 0.05 and 0.63 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.66 +/- 0.02, respectively). Another remarkable effect was the reduction of cholesterol concentration in VLDL (72.4 +/- 8.9 vs. 47.3 +/- 6.8 [lovastatin] and 78.3 +/- 11.1 vs. 50.7 +/- 8.8 mg/dl [simvastatin], respectively). Therefore, the ratio of triglycerides/cholesterol in VLDL increased (3.2 +/- 0.2 vs. 3.8 +/- 0.3 and 3.2 +/- 0.2 vs. 4.0 +/- 0.2, respectively), indicating VLDL formation poor in cholesterol and rich in triglycerides.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "6": "In concentrations probably exceeding those achieved in vivo, the cholesterol lowering compound simvastatin was found to suppress the synthesis of the androgens androstenediol and testosterone in vitro by human testicular homogenates. It was demonstrated that simvastatin in addition to its known inhibitory effect on HMG-CoA reductase activity, also affects the later steps of testicular steroidogenesis by selectively inhibiting the 17-ketosteroid-oxidoreductase catalyzed conversion of dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione to androstenediol and testosterone respectively. There was no effect of simvastatin on the Cytochrome P-450-dependent microsomal enzymes. Although in doses conventionally used in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, simvastatin does not affect testicular steroidogenesis, at higher doses--especially when inadvertently administered during early pregnancy--adverse effects on normal testosterone biosynthesis and thereby fetal development should be considered.", 
    "7": "Lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, is effective in the treatment of hypercholesterolemic patients and is currently being evaluated as a potential agent for dissolving gallstones. We therefore evaluated its effect on cholesterol metabolism in a rat model. A low-cholesterol diet containing 0.1% lovastatin was fed 15 h and 7 and 21 days. Microsomal HMG-CoA reductase activity, hepatic cholesterol synthesis, blood cholesterol, and biliary lipid output were determined and compared with control rats. Hepatic cholesterol synthesis increased ninefold after 7 days and levels of HMG-CoA reductase activity sevenfold. Biliary cholesterol excretion maximally increased fourfold. Biliary lipid output was still elevated after 21 days of treatment (cholesterol 3-fold and phospholipid 2-fold, P less than 0.01). Bile salt output did not change. Augmented responses to lovastatin were present but less on the high-cholesterol diet. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that lovastatin increases HMG-CoA reductase activity through a feedback mechanism that promoted increased cholesterol synthesis, biliary lipid secretion, and elevated blood cholesterol. There was an apparent coupling of biliary cholesterol output with phospholipids but not with bile salts. Although lovastatin also increased microsomal HMG-CoA reductase activity in humans, cholesterol synthesis is not stimulated but is inhibited. This may be explained by higher permeability of the microsomal membranes for lovastatin. Thus the effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on cholesterol synthesis in different species should then depend on the properties of microsomal membranes.", 
    "8": "The drug probucol is known to reduce levels of blood cholesterol and to have antioxidant effects on lipoproteins that may alter their metabolism. While studying probucol feeding in mice, we observed that the drug lowered total hepatic, but not gut, 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase activities during the diurnal cycle. Hepatic fatty acyl:cholesterol acyl transferase activity and cholesterol content were not measurably affected by probucol. Probucol also abolished the induction of HMG CoA reductase activity that resulted from feeding of lovastatin, when activity was measured in microsomes washed free of drugs. These effects are consistent with previous reports that probucol increases fractional clearance of lipoprotein cholesterol by the liver. The findings raise the possibility that some patients with hypercholesterolemia may benefit from combined therapy with lovastatin plus probucol.", 
    "9": "To evaluate ras-mediated signal transduction, an alkaline phosphatase gene (SEAP) was placed under the control of the ras-inducible phorbol ester response element (TRE) in murine fibroblasts (TRE-SEAP cells). The Kirsten ras gene was placed under the control of the glucocorticoid-inducible mouse mammary tumor virus promoter and introduced into the TRE-SEAP cells. Dexamethasone increased ras expression in the TRE-SEAP cells carrying the Kirsten ras gene and stimulated SEAP activity 25-fold. Lavostatin blocked dexamethasone induction of SEAP activity (50% inhibitory concentration, 0.5 microM) but did not affect phorbol ester-induced SEAP activity in the same cells. Lovastatin also did not block forskolin induction of SEAP activity in cells expressing SEAP under the control of the cyclic AMP response element.", 
    "10": "The rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis is controlled by the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. Inhibitors of this enzyme lower serum cholesterol very efficiently by increasing cellular uptake of cholesterol-rich, low-density lipoproteins. Pravastatin, a derivative of mevastatin and in the same class as lovastatin, lowers total cholesterol concentrations by 20-30 percent in patients with hypercholesterolemia. In patients who also have hypertriglyceridemia, serum triglyceride levels are decreased. Detailed pharmacokinetic data and long-term adverse-effect experience with pravastatin are extremely limited. The issue of tissue-selectivity for pravastatin has given rise to the marketing terminology \"second-generation\" HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, but any clinical advantage of pravastatin over other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors remains to be demonstrated.", 
    "11": "The liver is a key element in regulating the amount of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in plasma. The interference of cholestyramine treatment in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids stimulates the activity of the rate limiting enzymatic step in bile acid biosynthesis (cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase). This increases demand for cholesterol which is met by enhanced cholesterol biosynthesis (through the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A [HMG CoA] reductase) and by an increased expression of LDL receptors. Inhibition of HMG CoA reductase activity by treatment with specific inhibitors such as pravastatin enhances LDL receptor binding activity. Combination of the two treatments results in a significant stimulation of LDL receptor expression and a drastic reduction in the concentration of plasma LDL cholesterol. Thus, selective interference with bile acid enterohepatic circulation and cholesterol biosynthesis may be utilised to regulate plasma lipoprotein metabolism.", 
    "12": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors decrease serum cholesterol by inhibiting hepatic cholesterol synthesis, but their influence on biliary lipids is not well characterized. In the present study Pravastatin (80 mg) was administered as a single oral dose to 10 patients with external bile fistula, after 1 week of interruption of the enterohepatic circulation, in order to assess the effect of inhibition of hepatic cholesterol synthesis on biliary lipids in conditions of stimulated bile acid synthesis. Bile was collected every hour for 12 h. On the day before, the same procedure was applied with a placebo, and collected bile used as control. Pravastatin decreased both bile acid and phospholipid concentration to about 60% of basal values; this change was still significant after 10 h. Cholesterol concentration was also decreased to about 70% of basal values, but this change was significant only from the 5th to the 7th h. The per cent of cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid was not affected by the drug, but the ratio of glyco- to tauroconjugated bile acids was decreased to about half the initial values. Bilirubin concentration exhibited a late increase, suggesting a reduction in the bile flow. These results suggest that, in patients with interrupted enterohepatic circulation, biliary excretion of bile acids can be largely dependent on hepatic cholesterol synthesis.", 
    "13": "Simvastatin, recently introduced in clinical practice for pharmacological treatment of hypercholesterolemia, has been found to cause minor and reversible elevations of serum transaminases. We report a case of acute cholestatic hepatitis during simvastatin therapy. Clinical, biochemical, immunological, and histological findings were consistent with a simvastatin-induced liver damage through an immunological-mediated mechanism. This case suggests a careful monitoring of liver function tests during simvastatin therapy, and caution in continuing simvastatin administration when elevations of serum transaminases take place.", 
    "14": "The effect of a 6-month treatment with simvastatin, an HMG CoA-reductase inhibitor, on serum lipoprotein pattern was investigated in patients affected by primary hypercholesterolemia. After 4-6 weeks of lipid lowering diet, 46 patients showing serum cholesterol greater than 250 mg/dl and triglycerides less than 200 mg/dl were included in the study and treated with simvastatin (10-30 mg/day) plus diet. Serum total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and triglycerides levels significantly decreased at the end of the follow-up (-27%, -33%, -22%, -26% respectively). Apolipoprotein A1 showed a significant increase as well as HDL-cholesterol, HDL3-cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1/B ratio. This study provides further findings on the simvastatin efficacy to normalize the lipoprotein pattern in primary hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "15": "We studied the effect of fluvastatin (XU 62-320), a new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, on the distribution of low density lipoprotein (LDL) subspecies and composition in humans. As expected, fluvastatin significantly lowered serum LDL levels (25% after 6 weeks of therapy). In addition, treatment with fluvastatin changed the LDL subspecies. In the group treated with fluvastatin, 38.5% of the individuals showed changes in the shape of LDL absorbance profile obtained from density gradient ultracentrifugation and 54% of the group showed changes in the electrophoretic mobility of the LDL bands. Of those showing changes in electrophoretic mobility, the majority (78%) shifted to slightly larger, less dense LDL after drug therapy. However, the LDL-cholesterol/apo B ratio changes were relatively small in all fluvastatin-treated individuals including the group with changes in electrophoretic mobility, confirming that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor causes relatively small and subtle changes in the distribution of LDL subspecies.",

HMGdithio-CoA is a potent inhibitor of Pseudomonas mevalonii HMG-CoA reductase. Inhibition was mainly competitive with respect to HMG-CoA with a Kis of 0.086 +/- .01 microM and noncompetitive with respect to NADH with a Kis of 3.7 +/- 1.5 microM and a Kii of 0.65 +/- .05 microM in the presence of 110 microM (R.S)-HMG-CoA.", 
    "17": "Inhibitors of the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, are now used frequently to treat hypercholesterolemia. We studied the effects of specific inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by one of these agents (pravastatin) on the hepatic metabolism of cholesterol in patients with gallstone disease who were scheduled to undergo cholecystectomy.", 
    "18": "Ten patients were treated with pravastatin (20 mg twice a day) for three weeks before cholecystectomy; 20 patients not treated served as controls. A liver specimen was obtained from each patient at operation, and the activities of rate-determining enzymes in cholesterol metabolism as well as low-density-lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor binding activity were determined.", 
    "19": "Pravastatin therapy reduced plasma total cholesterol by 26 percent and LDL cholesterol by 39 percent (p less than 0.005). Serum levels of free lathosterol, a precursor of cholesterol whose concentration reflects the rate of cholesterol synthesis in vivo, decreased by 63 percent (p less than 0.005), indicating reduced de novo biosynthesis of cholesterol. Microsomal HMG-CoA reductase activity, when analyzed in vitro in the absence of the inhibitor, was increased 11.8-fold (1344 +/- 311 vs. 105 +/- 14 pmol per minute per milligram of protein in the controls; p less than 0.001). The expression of LDL receptors was increased by 180 percent (p less than 0.005), whereas the activities of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (which governs bile acid synthesis) and of acyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol O-acyltransferase (which regulates cholesterol esterification) were unaffected by treatment.", 
    "20": "Inhibition of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase by pravastatin results in an increased expression of hepatic LDL receptors, which explains the lowered plasma levels of LDL cholesterol.", 
    "21": "In this open controlled clinical trial the lipid-lowering effect, the tolerance and clinical safety of the new hydrophilic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor pravastatin and cholestyramine were compared in the treatment of 45 patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia over a period of 16 weeks. Following a dietary lead-in of six weeks, patients were randomized at a ratio of 3:2 to receive either pravastatin 10 mg b.i.d. or cholestyramine 8 g b.i.d. The dose of pravastatin was increased to 40 mg per day after eight weeks of treatment and after 16 weeks cholestyramine 8 g b.i.d. was added. Two thirds of the patients in the cholestyramine group were switched to gemfibrocil 900 mg. At the end of the 48 week treatment period the mean reduction rates of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides for the pravastatin combination compared to cholestyramine (in brackets values for gemfibrocil) were -30, -35 and -17% versus -17 (-19), -25 (-22) and +27 (-24)%. Pravastatin lead to an increase of the HDL concentration of approximately 8%, gemfibrocil to approximately 13%, whilst cholestyramine alone did not change this lipid fraction. The reduction of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol was associated with a decrease in the apolipoprotein B concentration. However, the apolipoprotein AI and AII levels remained unchanged. Due to the absence of clinically relevant side effects and laboratory abnormalities coupled with the excellent compliance in this study, pravastatin proved to be a convincing therapeutic alternative to cholestyramine and gemfibrocil. The combination therapy of pravastatin and cholestyramine offers a potentially highly efficacious and safe therapeutic regimen for the future.", 
    "22": "To determine the cost-effectiveness of HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase inhibitors (such as lovastatin) for the primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, we used the Coronary Heart Disease Policy Model, a computer-stimulated model that estimates the risk factor-specific annual incidence of coronary heart disease and the risk of recurrent coronary events in persons with prevalent coronary heart disease. When used for secondary prevention, 20 mg/d of lovastatin was estimated to save lives and save costs in younger men with cholesterol levels above 250 mg/dL (6.47 mmol/L) and to have a favorable cost-effectiveness ratio regardless of the cholesterol level except in young women with cholesterol levels below 250 mg/dL (6.47 mmol/L). Doses of 40 mg/d of lovastatin had favorable incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in men with cholesterol levels above 250 mg/dL (6.47 mmol/L). By comparison, primary prevention had favorable cost-effectiveness ratios only in selected subgroups based on cholesterol levels and other established risk factors. We conclude that current national recommendations regarding medication for secondary prevention are not as aggressive as our projections would suggest, while recommendations regarding the use of medications for primary prevention should consider the cost of medication as well as the risk factor profile of the individual patient.", 
    "23": "The effect of simvastatin in 27 patients with severe primary hypercholesterolaemia was assessed by a double-blind placebo controlled parallel group trial. Total serum cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and apoprotein B (ApoB) were significantly reduced by simvastatin 40 mg daily. Reductions in triglyceride and VLDL-cholesterol and an increase in HDL-cholesterol levels were only significant when calculated as a percentage of baseline, because of wide inter-individual variability. No changes in apoprotein A1, lipoprotein (a), fibrinogen, viscosity or blood pressure were observed. Leucocyte HMG-CoA reductase activity was unchanged after 4 weeks of active treatment but increased by 87% after 3 months (n = 21, P less than 0.05). No severe adverse effects or changes in CK or AST levels were noted. We conclude that simvastatin is effective in the treatment of severe and resistant hypercholesterolaemia, and well tolerated in the short term.", 
    "24": "Nowadays there is no direct evidence that lowering cholesterol may reduce the CHD in the elderly; however, several evidences suggest the potential benefit of a dietetic and/or pharmacologic intervention in healthy young-old hypercholesterolemics. In this study we evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of simvastatin, alone or in combination with cholestyramine, in two groups of patients (group A: age 30-55 years and group B: age 60-75 years) with primary hypercholesterolemia, over a 48-week period. In both groups Simvastatin induced a significant reduction in total and LDL cholesterol (p less than 0.001 both), with a decrease of the total/HDL cholesterol ratio (p less than 0.001). A reduction of the apo-B100 levels was also observed (respectively p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.001) with a significant improvement of the apo-B100/apo-A1 ratio (p less than 0.01). Simvastatin was well tolerated and free of remarkable side effects in both groups.", 
    "25": "Various lipid-lowering drugs have been shown to reduce serum cholesterol and serum triglycerides effectively. In view of trials indicating that lipid-lowering drugs may reduce cardiac morbidity and mortality but not the overall mortality in the study group, increased attention must be focused on potential harmful side effects during treatment with these agents. The adverse effects of many of the principal drugs in this category are discussed. Gastrointestinal symptoms, usually self-limited and reversible, are the most common side effects. Potential harmful adverse effects include drug interactions (cholestyramine), myopathy and hepatic injury (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), and increased gallstone formation and ventricular arrhythmias (clofibrate). Not all lipid-lowering drugs have been studied adequately on a long term basis, so that medications given for an indefinite period must be reevaluated frequently. However, there are several agents that lower serum lipid levels effectively and that have been used for more than 20 years without serious side effects.", 
    "26": "Simvastatin, a chemical derivative of lovastatin, is an antihyperlipidemic medication that inhibits hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. Animal and clinical data suggest simvastatin is twice as potent as lovastatin. It lowers serum cholesterol by inhibiting hepatic synthesis of cholesterol and, more importantly, by increasing the number of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors present on hepatic cellular membranes. Simvastatin, when used at doses of 40 mg/d in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, significantly reduces total cholesterol (greater than 30 percent) and LDL cholesterol (35-45 percent) and tends to reduce triglycerides and raise high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The agent is also effective in patients with polygenic hypercholesterolemia, familial dysbetalipoproteinemia, and nephrotic syndrome. Addition of cholestyramine to simvastatin enhances the LDL cholesterol-lowering effect to approximately 55 percent. Common clinical adverse effects reported with simvastatin use include headaches and gastrointestinal complaints. Transient elevations in serum transaminases and creatine phosphokinase have also been seen. Based on data currently available, the drug's clinical activity and adverse-effect profile are similar to those of lovastatin. Therefore, there is no need for formularies to contain both medications. To choose between the two, one needs to consider the incidence of adverse effects and the daily cost of each product when used at equally effective doses. That information is now now available and, until it is, a clear recommendation cannot be made. Simvastatin, presently marketed in several countries, is investigational in the U.S. but is expected to be available soon.", 
    "27": "The microbial transformation of simvastatin (MK-733) by Nocardia autotrophica subspecies amethystina yielded iso-simvastatin-6-one as a minor component. This transformation product is a dienone and is one of the more potent inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase found to date.", 
    "28": "We report 3 sisters treated for cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. We treated one, with a severe neurologic form of the illness, with chenodeoxycholic acid, then lovastatin and simvastatin. These drugs had different efficacy and tolerance, but induced no clinical improvement. Her sisters, without neurologic symptoms, received chenodeoxycholic acid, which normalized the cholestanol level. Optimal treatment of this illness must begin before there is significant clinical symptomatology.", 
    "29": "The crystalline lenses of hypercholesterolemic patients were assessed before and after 48 weeks of treatment with lovastatin or placebo to determine the effect of lovastatin on the human lens. Patients were given a biomicroscopic (slit-lamp) examination of the lens, and a previously validated, standardized classification system was used to describe the findings. A total of 8,245 patients were randomly assigned in equal numbers to treatment with placebo or lovastatin 20 or 40 mg once or twice daily in this double-blind, parallel-group study. Statistical analyses of the distribution of cortical, nuclear and subcapsular opacities at 48 weeks, adjusted for age and presence of an opacity at baseline, showed no significant differences (p less than 0.01) between the placebo and lovastatin-treated groups. Visual acuity assessments at week 48 were also not found to have significantly different distributions among treatment groups. Moreover, no significant differences were found among the groups in the frequencies of greater than or equal to 2-line worsening in visual acuity with concurrent progression in lenticular opacity, cataract extraction, or any spontaneously reported adverse ophthalmologic experience. No evidence was found for an effect of lovastatin on the human lens after 48 weeks of treatment.", 
    "30": "A spectrum of cholesterol oxidation derivatives (oxysterols) is generated in food products exposed to heat or radiation in the presence of oxygen. One of these derivatives (cholestan-3 beta,5 alpha,6 beta-triol) was shown to compromise the selective barrier function of cultured vascular endothelial cell monolayers, an action that may initiate atherosclerotic lesion formation. This study sought to investigate the relationship of cholesterol synthesis inhibition by several naturally occurring oxysterols to depression of vascular endothelial cell monolayer barrier function, determined as an increase in albumin transfer across cultured endothelial monolayers. All oxysterols tested caused a variable time- and dose-dependent elevation in trans-endothelial albumin transfer, and they were also able to inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis to varying degrees. Pure cholesterol was without effect on both counts. The correlation between the increase in albumin transfer related to oxysterol exposure and the ability of oxysterols to suppress cholesterol biosynthesis was, however, poor. Moreover, mevinolin, a water-soluble competitive inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, reduced the rate of cholesterol synthesis to 0.9% of control but did not significantly increase albumin transfer. Cholestan-3 beta,5 alpha,6 beta-triol caused a 660% elevation in albumin transfer while cholesterol synthesis remained at 11% of control. We conclude that changes in endothelial barrier function caused by exposure to the oxysterols examined, but not pure cholesterol, are probably related to factors other than the well-known action of cholesterol biosynthesis inhibition. These findings may have implications in the development of atherosclerosis.", 
    "31": "The effects of competitive inhibition of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase by compactin on the in vitro proliferation of peripheral blood myeloid leukemia cells were studied using the cells from 45 patients with acute myeloid leukemia or chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast phase. The cells from 58% of these patients showed a dose-related inhibition of DNA synthesis when incubated with compactin. Unexpectedly, cells from 18% of the patients were resistant to the inhibitory effects of compactin on DNA synthesis and responded to the HMG CoA reductase inhibition with an actual increase in the incorporation of 14C-labeled thymidine into DNA. Another 18% of the patients studied displayed both inhibition and stimulation of DNA synthesis in a biphasic response depending on the particular concentration of compactin used. The maximum enhanced rates of cellular DNA synthesis were observed with lower compactin concentrations (5 x 10(-7) mol/L) than were required for maximum inhibition of DNA synthesis (10(-5) mol/L). Leukemia cells displaying a stimulated response to compactin had a significantly lower baseline DNA synthetic rate than did cells that showed an inhibitory response of DNA synthesis to compactin. There was no correlation between these cells' varying DNA synthetic response to compactin and measures of baseline HMG CoA reductase activity or acetate conversion to cholesterol. Whereas the observation of cellular DNA synthesis stimulation by HMG CoA reductase inhibition has not been observed in other mammalian cells and seems paradoxical, explanations may emerge in light of our growing knowledge concerning the importance of isoprenylation for the function of certain cell regulatory proteins.",

The structures, including stereochemistry, of the two major metabolites of pravastatin sodium in an isolated rat hepatocyte system, i.e. the 4'a alpha-glutathione conjugate (CM-1) and the 3',5'-dihydrodiol (CM-2), were determined by one- and two-dimensional n.m.r. spectroscopy. 2. The structures of two synthetic pravastatin epoxides, possible precursors of the metabolites, were also established. 3. One of the synthetic epoxides, 4'a beta, 5' beta-epoxide was converted to the pravastatin metabolite, 4'a alpha-glutathione conjugate (CM-1) by a rat liver cytosol system and is proposed as the common metabolic intermediate between pravastatin sodium and the metabolites, CM-1 and CM-2.", 
    "33": "Pravastatin was administered to 20 patients with hyperlipidemia type IIa and IIb, for a period of 8 to 16 weeks at a daily dose of 10 to 20 mg, to investigate the effects on serum and biliary lipids. At the end of the treatment with pravastatin, the serum cholesterol level was significantly reduced, by 20%, compared with the control level. On the other hand, no significant differences were observed in serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Additionally, the administration of pravastatin did not change mode % compositions of biliary lipids, such as cholesterol, phospholipids, and total bile acids, as well as individual biliary bile acids. Consequently, there was not any significant change of the cholesterol saturation index. Based on the above results, our findings suggest that, for the treatment of hyperlipidemia, pravastatin is a highly effective cholesterol-lowering drug that does not affect biliary lipid metabolism.", 
    "34": "The adrenal gland requires a continuous supply of cholesterol for the biosynthesis of adrenal corticosteroids, which can be supplied by low density lipoprotein receptor-mediated uptake or local synthesis. The present study examined whether hypolipidemic therapy with a potent HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, simvastatin, compromises the adrenal response to ACTH stimulation in adult patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. The adrenal response to a 36-h continuous ACTH infusion was determined at baseline and after 2 months of simvastatin treatment (40 mg, twice daily) in eight patients. Simvastatin reduced total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 36% and 45%, respectively. The time course of the increase in serum cortisol concentrations with continuous ACTH infusion was the same before and during simvastatin therapy, as were the rates of urinary excretion of free cortisol, 17-hydroxycorticosteroids, and 17-ketosteroids. Urinary excretion of mevalonate, which correlates with rates of whole body cholesterol synthesis, decreased from 3.8 +/- 0.42 (+/- SEM) mu,ol/24 h at baseline to 2.75 +/- 0.56 on simvastatin; no significant changes were seen in the urinary mevalonate levels before and after simvastatin therapy during ACTH stimulation. We conclude that the hypolipidemic effects of simvastatin in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia are paralleled by a decrease in urinary mevalonate, but that the drug does not adversely affect ACTH-stimulated adrenal corticosteroid production.", 
    "35": "The effectiveness of lovastatin was compared with both a high-fat vs low-fat diet. Hypercholesterolemic subjects were studied under metabolic ward conditions for diet periods of 3 weeks while receiving lovastatin (40 mg/d) or placebo. Multiple lipoprotein levels were measured during the final week of each diet period. Nineteen subjects completed the study on the high-fat (43% of kilojoules) diet and 16 on the low-fat (25% of kilojoules) diet. Lovastatin reduced total cholesterol by 23% and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 30%, compared with placebo on both diets, with no significant diet-drug interaction. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol was raised by 7% to 8% on the diet regimens. Addition of lovastatin to the low-fat diet permitted 80% of subjects on this diet, but less than 50% of those on the high-fat diet, to achieve current guidelines. Although lovastatin produces a comparable percentage reduction in lipoprotein profiles on either diet, the accompanying low-fat diet remains advisable for additional reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels to specified goals.", 
    "36": "The effect of lovastatin on the low density lipoprotein metabolism in bypassed rabbits was investigated. Partial ileal bypass effectively reduced total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 44 and 48% respectively. The LDL drop was due to an increased fractional catabolic rate (FCR) of apolipoprotein B (apo B) from 0.74 to 1.27 pools per day with no effect on the apo B absolute catabolic rate and an increased expression of liver LDL receptors (+71%). Association of lovastatin with PIB resulted in a further decrease of total and LDL cholesterol (56 and 75% respectively) as compared to bypassed animals, without effects on the LDL FCR (1.27 +/- 0.11 versus 1.42 +/- 0.13 pools/day) or the expression of LDL receptors by the liver. The reduction of LDL was due to a decrease of the apolipoprotein B absolute synthetic rate (8.5 +/- 1.7 versus 13.6 +/- 1.7 mg/day). From these data we conclude that in bypassed rabbits lovastatin lowers total and LDL cholesterol mainly by reducing apolipoprotein B production rate.", 
    "37": "L-645, 164, a potent inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutarylcoenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, is a structurally unique, synthetic monofluorinated-biphenyl that was administered to beagle dogs at dosages of 2, 10, or 50 mg/kg/day for 14 weeks to evaluate its toxic potential. Previously tested HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors from this laboratory have either been semisynthetic or fermentation-derived products containing a hexahydronaphthalene ring structure (i.e., lovastatin and simvastatin). Administration of L-645, 164 produced a significant spectrum of lesions, some of which have been previously associated with compounds of this pharmacological class, while others were unique to this monofluorinated-biphenyl inhibitor. Subcapsular lenticular opacities were produced in six of eight of the dogs receiving 50 mg/kg/day of L-645, 164 within 8 weeks of dosing. One dog receiving this dosage level experienced increases in serum alanine aminotransferase activity to levels 10 times those in concurrent control dogs. Light and electron microscopy of a wedge biopsy obtained within 3 days of this transaminase elevation failed to reveal any significant changes and the elevation resolved spontaneously despite continued drug administration. Lesions of the optic nerve and acoustic-vestibular tract and trapezoid decussation were observed in several dogs receiving 50 mg/kg/day. In addition, similar changes were observed in the optic tract in several of the dogs receiving 50 mg/kg/day and in one dog receiving 2 mg/kg/day of L-645,164. These were unique to L-645,164 and have not been observed after the administration of other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in this laboratory. Optic tract changes were generally mild, consisting of small to medium vacuoles without apparent myelin loss. Lesions in the other areas ranged from very slight to prominent vacuolation. No clinical signs were observed. Peak plasma drug levels of L-645,164 at 50 mg/kg were greater than 5 micrograms/ml, about one order of magnitude greater than those attained after administration of pharmacologically equipotent doses of lovastatin and simvastatin. These findings support previous observations that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors producing high plasma drug levels are associated with a significant degree of systemic toxicity. In addition, the drug-induced CNS lesions attributed to L-645,164 appear also to be related to its chemical structure since similar lesions have not been observed after the administration of other structurally unrelated HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that produce high plasma drug concentrations and comparable degrees of serum cholesterol lowering.", 
    "38": "A study was made on the effect of simvastatin (the generic name of MK-733), a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, on coronary atherosclerosis in cholesterol-fed rabbits with focus on the serum lipids and morphology. Twenty-seven Japanese white rabbits were divided according to dosage of simvastatin into four groups as follows, group P (placebo, 5 rabbits), group MK 1 (simvastatin 1mg/kg, 5 rabbits), group MK 3 (simvastatin 3mg/kg, 6 rabbits) and group MK 5 (simvastatin 5mg/kg, 5 rabbits). They were placed on a 0.5% cholesterol atherogenic diet for 16 weeks and measurements were made of the concentration of serum lipids weekly. After sacrifice, the degree of surface involvement (SI) of aorta stained with Sudan III and the degree of coronary stenosis (CS) of the left circumflex artery were measured using an image-processing system. Serum total cholesterol (TC) level and beta-lipoprotein level decreased dose-dependently in MK groups compared with group P. High density lipoprotein cholesterol level increased in groups MK 3 and MK 5 slightly. Triglyceride level decreased in groups MK 3 and MK 5. The progressions of SI and CS were suppressed in MK groups dose-dependently. Integrated TC, that is, sum of the serum TC values obtained at each week multiplied by 7 corresponded more closely to CS than SI. Intimal thickening constructed from large foam cells originated from macrophages and proliferating smooth muscle cells included lipid droplets in MK groups was almost similar in group P. But it was likely that lipid droplets in each smooth muscle cell in MK groups were less than in group P. In conclusion, the development of coronary atherosclerosis in cholesterol-fed rabbits was suppressed dose-dependently by simvastatin and it was suggested that this preventive effect was due to reducing the integrated TC and local action to vessel walls by simvastatin.

    "39": "The effects on the coagulative and rheologic pattern of two lipid-lowering drugs, bezafibrate and simvastatin, were studied in 36 hypercholesterolemic subjects. Patients were randomly divided into two groups (18 subjects each) and received bezafibrate R 400 mg/day or simvatatin 10-40 mg/day over a twelve week period. Besides a decrease in plasma fibrinogen and fibrinopeptide A (p less than 0.001 both), bezafibrate induced a reduction of factor VIIc and VIIIc activity (p less than 0.001 both), while antithrombin 3 activity was increased (p less than 0.001) and the hemorheologic pattern was greatly improved (p less than 0.001). Simvastatin caused a slight decrease in factor VIIIc activity and a moderate reduction of beta-thromboglobulin. The efficacy of bezafibrate in reducing the activation of the coagulative cascade and improving the hemorheologic pattern has been confirmed; the peculiar triglycerides- and fibrinogen-lowering effect of the drug, not observed with simvastatin, could be responsible for these modifications.", 
    "40": "We did a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of 10 healthy young men taking no medications to determine if ingesting lovastatin is associated with more severe muscle damage after exercise. Five men in the first group took 40 mg of lovastatin daily for 30 days while those in the second group took an identical-appearing placebo. Each volunteer then walked downhill on a -14-degree incline on a treadmill at 3 km per hour for an hour. After a 2-week rest, the subjects were crossed over. Serial serum creatine kinase activity was measured immediately before and 8, 24, 48, 72, 120, and 144 hours after each treadmill session. With each subject serving as his own control, peak mean serum creatine kinase activity (/+- SEM) following treadmill after lovastatin therapy was similar to that following placebo (168.4 +/- 25.8 U per liter versus 146.7 +/- 14.7 U per liter, respectively [P = .9]). With an alpha value of .05, we had greater than a 99% chance of detecting a difference in the rise of serum creatine kinase activity of 200 U per liter between groups. Our data suggest that lovastatin is not an independent risk factor for developing exercise-induced muscle damage using this model of exercise in our study population.", 
    "41": "Rats in mid-lactation were treated, for 2 days, with anti-rat GH serum (anti-rGH) and/or bromocriptine before microsomes were prepared from the freeze-clamped mammary glands. The effects of these anti-hormone treatments on the concentrations of microsomal cholesterol and cholesterol esters and on the activities of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) were measured. HMG-CoA reductase was determined in microsomes prepared in both the presence and absence of phosphatase inhibitors to determine the expressed and total activities respectively. Anti-rGH reduced HMG-CoA reductase and increased microsomal cholesterol and cholesterol esters. Bromocriptine reduced HMG-CoA reductase but increased all of the other parameters. The results indicate that the initial stage in the stimulation of milk secretion involves a decrease in the activity of ACAT and that the phosphorylation level of HMG-CoA reductase is modulated by both prolactin and GH acting in opposition.", 
    "42": "Glucocorticoids can mediate the destruction of thymocytes and T cell-derived leukemia cells through a mechanism known as apoptosis. The characteristic feature of apoptosis is fragmentation of DNA at internucleosomal linkers through the activity of a specific endonuclease. In this study, an attempt was made to compare dexamethasone-induced apoptosis in two T cell-derived human leukemia lines (CEM-C1 and CEM-C7) to the cell killing brought about by selected cytotoxic agents. In the CEM-C7 cell line (dexamethasone-sensitive), apoptosis was induced not only by dexamethasone but by actinomycin D, cycloheximide, and 25-OH cholesterol. In the CEM-C1 cell line (dexamethasone-resistant) cycloheximide, 25-OH cholesterol, or cell starvation could induce apoptosis. It appears that in leukemic cells apoptosis may be induced by a variety of unrelated toxic agents and is not limited to glucocorticoids.", 
    "43": "The incorporation of 2H- and 13C-labelled precursors into ubiquinone-8 (Uq-8) by strains of Escherichia coli was measured in order to define the pathway for the early steps in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids in these eubacteria. Cells grown with DL-[methyl-2H6]valine were found to label both the alpha-oxoisovaleric ('alpha-ketoisovaleric') acid alpha-oxoisohexanoic ('alpha-ketoisocaproic') acid, but not the Uq-8. Since these acids are required for the biosynthesis of isoprenoids by the acetolactate pathway, the operation of this pathway in the biosynthesis of Uq-8 is excluded. Cells grown with [1,2-13C2]acetate and non-labelled glucose readily incorporated 13C2 units into fatty acids, but failed to incorporate any label into the Uq-8. Cells grown with [U-13C6]glucose and non-labelled acetate, however, were found to label both the fatty acids and the Uq-8. Oxidative cleavage with periodate/permanganate of the Uq-8 isolated from cells grown with U-13C6-labelled glucose produced laevulinic acid, which was shown to be derived from two C2 units and one C1 unit of the labelled glucose by mass-spectral analysis of the 4,5-dihydro-6-methyl-2-phenylpyridazin-3(2H)-one derivative. The results of this work indicate that the C-2 and C-3 carbon unit of pyruvate, not acetyl-CoA, is the precursor to isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) in these cells; however, the labelling pattern observed is consistent with the established acetoacetate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis. These data, coupled with the observed lack of inhibition of the growth of E. coli by mevinolin, a specific inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA, can be best rationalized by the biosynthesis of IPP occurring in E. coli through a series of bound intermediates.", 
    "44": "Recent studies have linked epidermal cholesterol synthesis with maintenance of the permeability barrier. To assess directly the importance of cholesterol synthesis, we applied lovastatin, a potent inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, to hairless mouse skin. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) began to increase after four to six daily applications. Co-application of cholesterol blocked the expected increase in TEWL, demonstrating the importance of cholesterol for development of the lesion. The histology of lovastatin-treated skin revealed epidermal hyperplasia, accompanied by accelerated DNA synthesis. Whereas cholesterol synthesis initially was reduced in lovastatin-treated epidermis, with further treatment cholesterol synthesis normalized, while fatty acid synthesis accelerated greatly. Although the total free sterol content of lovastatin-treated epidermis remained normal, the fatty acid content increased coincident with barrier disruption. Finally, morphologic abnormalities of both lamellar body structure and their deposited, intercellular contents occurred coincident with the emerging biochemical abnormalities. Thus, the abnormal barrier function in this model can be ascribed to an initial inhibition of epidermal sterol synthesis followed by an alteration in cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis, leading to an imbalance in stratum corneum lipid composition and abnormal membrane bilayer structure.", 
    "45": "Hypercholesterolemia frequently accompanies hypertension, and it has been suggested that by affecting membrane lipid composition, hypercholesterolemia may cause or accentuate abnormalities in several red blood cell transports associated with hypertension. Such an effect might obfuscate the relation of membrane markers to hypertension and decrease their usefulness in genetic studies of the heritable basis of hypertension. To determine if changing plasma lipids affects membrane transport, we studied the effects of the cholesterol-lowering agent lovastatin on red blood cell lithium-sodium countertransport and sodium-potassium-chloride cotransport, red blood cell sodium and water content, and platelet amiloride-sensitive volume responsiveness to cytoplasmic acidification, an indirect measure of sodium-proton exchange that has been proposed as a new membrane marker for hypertension. In a 24-week, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized trial, lovastatin significantly lowered total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol and raised high density lipoprotein cholesterol. Red blood cell lithium-sodium countertransport and sodium-potassium-chloride cotransport were not significantly altered. Red blood cell sodium content decreased significantly in the lovastatin-treated group, probably as a result of an increase in red blood cell sodium-potassium pump activity. Platelet amiloride-sensitive responses to cytoplasmic acidification were significantly depressed by lovastatin treatment, suggesting that lowering plasma cholesterol may suppress platelet sodium-proton exchange. It has been hypothesized that the hyperlipidemias frequently observed in essential hypertensive patients may alter membrane lipid composition and affect membrane cation transport activities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "46": "The in vitro effect of simvastatin and pravastatin, two competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, on the proliferation of rat aortic smooth muscle cells was investigated. Simvastatin, but not pravastatin, inhibited the replication of arterial myocytes in concentrations ranging between 0.01 microM and 10 microM. The inhibition, evaluated as cell number and nuclear incorporation of [3H]thymidine, was dose-dependent and completely prevented by addition of mevalonate (100 microM), confirming the role of mevalonate or its products in regulating cell division and growth. The present results provide evidence that simvastatin, in addition to its effect on cholesterol biosynthesis, interferes in vitro with other processes involved in atherogenesis.", 
    "47": "This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to evaluate dose-response effects and safety of once-daily administration of pravastatin, a new inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. Pravastatin 5, 10, 20, 40 mg or placebo was administered at bedtime to 150 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia inadequately controlled on a low-fat, low-cholesterol (AHA Phase I) diet. After 8 weeks of treatment, pravastatin produced dose-dependent reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol of 19.2 to 34.1% (p less than or equal to .001 vs. baseline and placebo) and reductions in total cholesterol of 14.3 to 25.1% (p less than or equal to .01 to p less than or equal to .001 vs. placebo and p less than or equal to .001 vs. baseline). The relationship between the loge dose of pravastatin and decrease in LDL cholesterol was linear (p less than 0.002). High-density-lipoprotein cholesterol increased up to 11.7% and triglycerides decreased by as much as 23.9%. Pravastatin was well tolerated; no patient withdrew from the study as a consequence of treatment-related adverse events. Despite its relatively short serum half-life of approximately 2 h, once-daily administration of pravastatin provides a safe and effective means of reducing elevated LDL and total cholesterol.", 
    "48": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have been proven effective in decreasing the plasma cholesterol levels in patients affected with various forms of hypercholesterolemia, familial dysbetalipoproteinemia, familial combined hyperlipidemia and in nephrotic and diabetic dyslipidemia. The purpose of this study was to monitor and evaluate the efficiency and safety of the therapy with simvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, in a group of patients treated by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) with severe hypercholesterolemia. Monitoring of the changes occurring in the various lipids and apolipoproteins in these patients included the measurements of the plasma lipids and apolipoproteins A-I, A-II, B, C-II, A-IV and Lp(a). Lipoproteins were separated by gel filtration, on a Superose 6HR column, before and after 24 weeks of treatment. The patterns were compared to those observed in a group of primary hyperlipidemic patients treated with Lovastatin, a compound of the same class. The drug was well tolerated by the CAPD patients and no adverse reaction was observed. In addition to the decrease of the total and LDL cholesterol, similar to that reported in other groups of patients, we further observed a decrease of the apo E concentration in both the CAPD and the hyperlipidemic patients. This decrease was especially pronounced in the HDLE fraction and could involve an upregulation of the apo B-E and/or apo E receptor. These results should provide information about the mechanism of action of this drug in patients with end-stage renal disease.", 
    "49": "Cellular cholesterol homeostasis was examined in 11 hypercholesterolaemic Type 2 diabetic patients prior to and following reduction of serum cholesterol using simvastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase. Following 12 weeks of treatment with simvastatin (10-40 mg day-1), serum cholesterol decreased by 30 +/- 3% from 7.8 +/- 0.2 mmol l-1 to 5.5 +/- 0.2 mmol l-1 (p less than 0.001) and LDL-cholesterol by 35 +/- 4% from 5.7 +/- 0.2 to 3.6 +/- 0.1 mmol l-1 (p less than 0.001). The esterified/free cholesterol ratio in LDL also decreased from 2.75 +/- 0.18 to 1.94 +/- 0.10 (p less than 0.01) after treatment. Cellular cholesterol synthesis, measured by [14C] acetate incorporation into mononuclear leucocytes, decreased by 39 +/- 11% from 231 +/- 13 to 140 +/- 25 mumol g-protein-1 (p less than 0.01). The degree of suppression of [14C]acetate incorporation into cholesterol in normal mononuclear cells by diabetic patients' LDL increased from 32.1 +/- 4.0% to 48.8 +/- 2.5% (p less than 0.001) following simvastatin. The activity of acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol-0-acyltransferase (ACAT) increased significantly by 55 +/- 18% (p less than 0.05) after treatment. Cholesterol synthesis in patients' mononuclear cells correlated positively (r = 0.66, p less than 0.05) with the esterified/free cholesterol ratio of their LDL, while suppression of cholesterol synthesis by patients' LDL correlated negatively (r = -0.64, p less than 0.05) with the esterified/free cholesterol ratio of the LDL following treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "50": "We studied 10 patients affected by primary hypercholesterolemia treated with placebo for 1 month and with simvastatin (20 mg die) for 6 months during a double-blind clinical trial. At 1-month intervals we determined the following parameters in the serum: total and HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein A1 and B. At the same time intervals, we also determined the cholesterol and phospholipid concentration, the Na+/K+ ATPase activity and the fluidity of the erythrocyte membranes. Our results demonstrated the following modifications in the erythrocyte membranes during simvastatin treatment: 1) an initial increase in the cholesterol concentration and in the cholesterol/phospholipid ratio, with a significant decrease only after 4 months; 2) a similar behaviour of membrane fluidity, with an initial decrease and an elevation after 4 months; 3) an increase in the Na+/K+ ATPase activity only after 4 months. We hypothesize that simvastatin not only inhibits the hepatic synthesis of cholesterol, but also modifies the cholesterol exchange between plasma and the erythrocyte membrane.", 
    "51": "A kinetic study on lipoprotein cholesteryl ester metabolism was carried out in 4 normolipidemic volunteers before and after treatment with simvastatin. They received LDL labelled with 3H-cholesteryl linoleate. A lipoprotein cholesteryl ester model was developed that fit the radioactivity in LDL, HDL and VLDL cholesteryl ester during 24 hours following injection. Before treatment, the model is consistent with previously reported data. Moreover our results suggest that, in normal fasting subjects, the efflux of plasma cholesteryl ester is almost exclusively derived from LDL. Administration of drug decreased LDL cholesteryl ester concentration by 35%. After treatment, the rate constant concerning LDL catabolism was increased by 25% and the model required the existence of a direct removal of VLDL cholesteryl ester (40% of total VLDL turnover). Our results suggest that the reduction in the LDL cholesteryl ester concentration induced by treatment with simvastatin is due to an increase in the uptake of LDL and LDL precursors (VLDL, VLDL remnants) by LDL receptors.", 
    "52": "The roles of protein kinase C, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and AMP-activated protein kinase in the phosphorylation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase induced by Ca2(+)-mobilizing conditions in isolated hepatocytes were investigated. Only partial evidence for the involvement of AMP-activated kinase was found. Antagonism of calmodulin action prolonged the decrease in expressed/total activity ratio induced by vasopressin plus glucagon. Protease inhibitors active against Ca2(+)-dependent cytosolic proteases or lysosomal proteolysis did not attenuate the loss of total HMG-CoA reductase induced by glucagon plus vasopressin, but calmodulin antagonists largely prevented this effect.", 
    "53": "We have investigated the inhibition of cell growth by lovastatin (previously known as mevinolin), an antagonist of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase which blocks the processing and membrane localization of ras proteins via inhibition of polyisoprenylation. A series of NIH 3T3 cells transformed by oncogenes with activities that are dependent or independent of isoprenylated ras were studied, including cells transformed by myristylated ras protein that is isoprenylation independent. Treatment with lovastatin at concentrations ranging from 5 to 15 microM for up to 96 h resulted in a time- and dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth in all lines tested. The inhibition ranged from 25 to 50% when cells were treated with 5 microM lovastatin for 48 h, to 72-90% for cells treated with 15 microM lovastatin for 96 h. Cells transformed by c-ras, v-ras, v-src, v-raf, and the myristylated ras genes displayed similar sensitivities; the parental NIH 3T3 line was the most resistant of the lines tested. Metabolic labeling of control and lovastatin-treated cells with [35S]methionine or tritiated lipids revealed that 15 microM lovastatin blocked the processing of both endogenous ras and v-ras proteins yet had no effect on the lipidation of myristylated ras proteins. Addition of 300 microM mevalonic acid overcame the inhibition induced by 15 microM lovastatin. Thus the inhibition of cell growth in vitro by lovastatin did not show specificity for cells the transformation of which is dependent upon isoprenylated ras protein. It is therefore likely that the inhibition of other pathways affected by lovastatin, such as cholesterol biosynthesis or the processing of other cellular proteins, are responsible for the growth inhibition by lovastatin.", 
    "54": "The authors report the results of a comparative study of the effects of lovastatin and gemfibrozil on plasma cholesterol. Both drugs inhibit the enzyme systems responsible for cholesterol synthesis at the initial stages. The trial was conducted in 40 patients with nonfamilial hypercholesterolemia of whom 20 were treated with lovastatin and 20 with gemfibrozil. Throughout the trial, subjects took a dietary regime of about 1500 cal. Thirty days' before the start of the trial, patients received a placebo daily. Before and after the placebo period and at the end of 30 days treatment with either drug, cholesterol, esterified cholesterol, VLDL, LDL, and HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, phospholipid, triglyceride and free fatty acid blood levels were tested, as well as the level of fatty acid saturation (iodine number), and the activities of lipase and plasma heparin. The results obtained showed both drugs to induce significant reductions of total, VLDL- and LDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B, and a relative increase in HDL-cholesterol. Triglyceride blood level was more markedly reduced in patients treated with gemfibrozil compared to those treated with lovastatin, a difference accounted for by the different levels at which the two drugs interfere with the enzymes of the initial stages of cholesterol synthesis. Plasma free fatty acids rose more markedly under gemfibrozil while plasma lipase and heparin activity did not show any appreciable changes under either drugs. The authors conclude by pointing out that the use of these drugs should be decided according to the type of metabolic disorder to be corrected.", 
    "55": "We administered lovastatin to two sisters, aged 4 and 17 years, who had cholesterol ester storage disease, an autosomal recessive disorder manifested by hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. The drug, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, was taken orally for 6 months. Serum lipid concentrations were determined monthly. Computed tomography of the liver was performed before and during therapy to evaluate liver fat content. The younger sister had liver biopsies before and after 6 months of lovastatin therapy to assess hepatic cholesterol stores. Both patients had marked decreases in serum levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol; high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels increased. Computed tomography during treatment demonstrated a significant increase in linear attenuation, suggesting a decreased liver fat content. Liver tissue obtained 6 months after lovastatin therapy was initiated had 13% less esterified cholesterol than the liver sample obtained before treatment. We conclude that lovastatin may be effective in treating children with cholesterol ester storage disease.", 
    "56": "The efficacy and safety of pravastatin and bezafibrate (in retard form) were compared in a randomised double-blind trial comprising 96 patients (48 men, 48 women; mean age 52.5 [20-68] years) with primary hypercholesterolaemia types IIa and IIb. After four weeks' treatment 6 out of 38 patients (400 mg/d bezafibrate) and 27 out of 58 patients (20 mg/d pravastatin) reached a LDL cholesterol level of 190 mg/dl or less. In the other 31 patients of the pravastatin group the dose was raised to 40 mg/d. During the twelve-week course of pravastatin total cholesterol concentration fell from a mean of 364 +/- 75 mg/dl (initial value) to 281 +/- 61 mg/dl (P less than 0.01), while LDL-cholesterol fell from 288 +/- 81 mg/dl to 206 +/- 64 mg/dl (P less than 0.01) and triglyceride concentration from 168 +/- 83 mg/dl to 148 +/- 80 mg/dl (P less than 0.05). During the twelve-week course of treatment with 400 mg bezafibrate total cholesterol concentration fell from a mean of 363 +/- 91 mg/dl to 325 +/- 73 mg/dl (P less than 0.01), LDL-cholesterol level fell from 284 +/- 88 mg/dl to 242 +/- 70 mg/dl (P less than 0.01) and the triglyceride concentration from 173 +/- 91 mg/dl to 121 +/- 83 mg/dl (P less than 0.01). HDL cholesterol concentration rose by 9% in the bezafibrate group and by 8.4% in the pravastatin group (P less than 0.05). Except in the case of HDL-cholesterol, the falls were significantly different in the two treatment groups: pravastatin was superior to bezafibrate in terms of the reductions in both total and LDL-cholesterol (P less than 0.01 for each). However, bezafibrate produced a greater fall in serum triglycerides (P less than 0.05). No serious side effects were associated with either drug.", 
    "57": "Membrane localization of ras p21 involves a complex series of post-translational processing events, including S-farnesylation of Cys-186, removal of three carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues, and methylation of the carboxyl-terminal farnesylcysteine residue. Palmitoylation of cysteine residues within the hypervariable region (amino acids 165-185) is also required for membrane localization of mammalian H-, N-, and K-ras(A). For K-ras(B), which contains no cysteine residues within the hypervariable region, a polybasic domain substitutes for palmitoylation as a second signal for plasma membrane targeting. In order to investigate the localization of K-ras(B) to the plasma membrane, we purified wild-type and mutant human K-ras(B) proteins from strains of E. coli harboring bacterial expression plasmids and injected them into Xenopus laevis oocytes. Our results show that wild-type and activated K-ras(B) proteins can be post-translationally modified and can induce meiotic maturation in Xenopus oocytes. A mutation at Cys-186 (Cys to Gly) abolished the ability of activated K-ras(B) to induce meiosis. Deprivation of isoprenyl precursors by the addition of lovastatin, a drug that blocks the synthesis of mevalonate, also abolished the ability of activated K-ras(B) to induce meiosis, although this inhibition could be overcome by the addition of exogenous mevalonate. Lovastatin did not block meiotic maturation induced by microinjection of purified mos protein, a component of the cytostatic factor that arrests Xenopus oocytes at the first meiotic prophase. These results indicate that post-translational isoprenylation of K-ras(B) is essential for plasma membrane targeting and induction of meiotic maturation in Xenopus oocytes and that further isoprenyl modification of proteins downstream from mos signal transduction is not essential for this process.", 
    "58": "Twelve elderly non-insulin dependent diabetic patients took part in a double-blind, cross-over, randomized study comparing simvastatin 30 mg/day and placebo. Each treatment period lasted 3 weeks and was separated by a 3 week wash-out period. At the end of each treatment period all subjects underwent in randomized order an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT; 75 g) and an euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic (50 mU/kg.h) glucose clamp. Simvastatin compared to placebo significantly reduced plasma total cholesterol (7.9 vs 5.3 mmol.l-1), LDL-cholesterol (7.2 vs 4.3 mmol.l-1), triglycerides (2.9 vs 2.1 mmol.l-1), free fatty acids (1106 vs 818 mmol-1) and glucose (7.4 vs 6.6 mmol.l-1) levels. After simvastatin, and in the last 60 min of the glucose clamp, there was an improvement in the action of insulin as demonstrated by stronger inhibition of hepatic glucose output (2.7 vs 5.2 mumol.kg-1.min-1) and stimulation both of the glucose disappearance rate (26.3 vs 19.5 mumol.kg-1.min-1) and glucose metabolic clearance rate (4.3 vs 3.6 ml.kg-1.min-1). The changes in glucose turnover parameters were significantly correlated with basal plasma free fatty acids and were independent of plasma glucoregulatory hormones. In conclusion, simvastatin seems to exert beneficial effects both on lipid and glucose metabolism.", 
    "59": "The effect of ursodeoxycholic acid analogues bearing modifications at the side-chain moiety of the molecule was tested on cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase and HMG-CoA reductase in rat liver microsomes. The compounds included 23 R,S mixture and the single isomers 23R and 23S of 23 methylursodeoxycholic acid (23-methyl UDCA), the isomeric mixture (cis + trans) of 3 alpha,7 beta-dihydroxy-20,22-methylen-5 beta-cholan-23-oic acid (norcypro-UDCA) and the corresponding single isomers. Each steroid was added to liver microsomes as the sodium salt, at concentrations ranging from 25 to 200 microM. Isomers 23R and 23S of 23-methyl-UDCA inhibited cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibitory capacity was similar for the two isomers. The extent of inhibition of the analogues was greater than that of the parent compound UDCA. Shortening of the side-chain in norcypro-UDCA resulted in a partial loss of the inhibitory effect, as compared to cypro-UDCA (3 alpha,7 beta-dihydroxy-22,23-methylen-5 beta-cholan-24-oic acid). None of these bile acid derivatives affected the activity of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase.", 
    "60": "Simvastatin was more effectively metabolized by the liver microsomes of male rats than females. The sex difference appeared in the composition of the metabolites. Two male-specific metabolites were identified by NMR and mass spectrometry as 3''-hydroxy and 3',3''-dihydroxy-delta 4',5' derivatives of simvastatin.", 
    "61": "The effect of bezafibrate on HMG-CoA reductase, the key enzyme of cholesterol synthesis, and LDL metabolism was studied in human mononuclear cells. Bezafibrate at concentrations achieved during administration in patients did not suppress preformed reductase in mononuclear cells. Similarly, the drug was ineffective in regulating reductase when added to the medium of cultured cells. Also, the fibrate did not modulate the enzyme suppression mediated by LDL. At very high concentrations bezafibrate enhanced LDL binding, but both total cell association and degradation were unchanged. Thus, the previously observed decrease of HMG-CoA reductase activity in mononuclear cells of patients treated with fibrates is likely to be indirect and probably due to changes in LDL structure.", 
    "62": "Subanalyses of previous multicenter studies comparing lovastatin and gemfibrozil were carried out to evaluate the merits of these agents in patients with different serum lipid phenotypes (type 2a and 2b hyperlipoproteinemia). Regardless of phenotype, lovastatin was more effective in lowering LDL-cholesterol, while gemfibrozil had a greater triglyceride-lowering and HDL-cholesterol-increasing effect. Patients with type 2a phenotype benefited (in terms of serum lipid pattern) more from lovastatin. In type 2b hyperlipoproteinemia, more patients taking lovastatin than gemfibrozil reached both treatment goals defined by the European Atherosclerosis Society, (LDL-cholesterol 4.0 mmol/l and triglycerides 2.3 mmol/l). In many patients these goals could not be met suggesting that multiple drug therapy may be indicated in part of the patients with type 2b hyperlipoproteinemia.", 
    "63": "Lovastatin and simvastatin are potent competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. Key inhibit the synthesis of cholesterol in cultured HepG23 cells, rat hepatocytes and in rats. The primary target organ of cholesterol synthesis inhibition by lovastatin and simvastatin is the liver. Lovastating and simvastatin lower levels of plasma cholesterol in rats, dogs and rabbits by inhibition the endogenous cholesterol synthesis and induction of LDL receptor in the liver.", 
    "64": "Lovastatin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, lowers cholesterol saturation of bile. To determine the mechanism of this effect and further define the role of cholesterol synthesis in regulation of biliary lipid metabolism, we studied ten human volunteers in a control period and again after 5-6 weeks on lovastatin, 40 mg b.i.d. Mean sterol production from acetate in mononuclear leukocytes fell from 1.18 to 0.84 pmol/min per 10(6) cells on lovastatin (P less than 0.02). Concomitantly there was reduction in mean biliary secretion of cholesterol from 143 to 96 mumol/h (P less than 0.02). On lovastatin, mean pool size of bile acids by the Lindstedt method fell from 3193 to 2917 mumol (one-sided P = 0.05) and mean pool size by the one-sample method fell from 5158 to 4091 mumol (P less than 0.002). Lovastatin had no effect on mean fractional turnover rate of either cholic acid (0.77 vs. 0.74 day-1) or chenodeoxycholic acid (0.51 vs. 0.54 day-1). Mean total bile acid synthesis was lower on lovastatin (1443 vs. 1240 mumol/day), but the difference did not quite achieve statistical significance. In humans, inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by lovastatin lowers biliary cholesterol saturation by reducing cholesterol secretion into bile. Bile acid pool size, and perhaps bile acid synthesis, are also reduced by this inhibition.", 
    "65": "We have examined the mechanism of the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in cells treated with exogenous sphingomyelinase. Treatment of rat intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6), human skin fibroblasts (GM-43), and human hepatoma (HepG2) cells in culture with sphingomyelinase resulted in a concentration- and time-dependent inhibition of the activity of HMG-CoA reductase, a key regulatory enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. The following observations were obtained with IEC-6 cells. Free fatty acid synthesis or general cellular protein synthesis was unaffected by the addition of sphingomyelinase. Addition of sphingomyelinase to the in vitro reductase assay had no effect on activity, suggesting that an intact cell system is required for the action of sphingomyelinase. The products of sphingomyelin hydrolysis, e.g., ceramide and phosphocholine, had no effect on reductase activity. Sphingosine, a further product of ceramide metabolism, caused a stimulation of reductase activity. Examination of the incorporation of [3H]acetate into the nonsaponifiable lipid fractions in the presence of sphingomyelinase showed no changes in the percent distribution of radioactivity in the post-mevalonate intermediates of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, but there was increased radioactivity associated with the polar sterol fraction. Pretreatment of cells with ketoconazole, a known inhibitor of oxysterol formation, prevented the inhibition of reductase activity by sphingomyelinase and decreased the incorporation of [3H]acetate in the polar sterol fraction. Ketoconazole had no effect on exogenous sphingomyelinase activity in vitro in the presence or absence of cells. Endogenous sphingomyelinase activity was also unaffected by ketoconazole. Addition of inhibitors of endogenous sphingomyelinase activity, e.g., chlorpromazine, desipramine, and N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalene sulfonamide (W-7), to the culture medium caused a dose-dependent stimulation of reductase activity. However, these agents had no effect on the inhibition of reductase activity by exogenous sphingomyelinase. Treatment of cells with small unilamellar vesicles of dioleyl phosphatidylcholine or high density lipoprotein3 resulted in increased efflux of cholesterol and stimulation of reductase activity. Under similar conditions, the inhibitory effect of exogenous sphingomyelinase on reductase activity was prevented by incubation with small unilamellar vesicles of phosphatidylcholine or high density lipoprotein. These results support the hypothesis that alteration of the ratio of sphingomyelin:cholesterol in the plasma membrane plays a modulatory role on the flow of membrane cholesterol to a site where it may be converted to a putative regulatory molecule, possibly an oxysterol.", 
    "66": "A series of substituted quinoline mevalonolactones were prepared and evaluated for their ability to inhibit the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase both in vitro and (cholesterol biosynthesis) in vivo. Since previous studies suggested that the 4-(4-fluorophenyl) and 2-(1-methylethyl) substituents afforded optimum potency, attention was focused on variations at position 6 of the quinoline ring. Biological evaluation of a small number of analogues bearing a variety of 6-substituents showed that modification at this position had little effect on potency. Several compounds (8b, 8e, and 11) were identified that showed comparable potency to compactin and mevinolin in both the in vitro and in vivo assays.", 
    "67": "A series of trans-tetrahydro-4-hydroxy-6-[2-(2,3,4,5-substituted-1H-pyrrol-1-yl) ethyl]-2H-pyran-2-ones and their dihydroxy acids were prepared and tested for their ability to inhibit the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase in vitro. Inhibitory potency was found to increase substantially when substituents were introduced into positions three and four of the pyrrole ring. A systematic exploration of structure-activity relationships at these two positions led to the identification of a compound ((+)-33,(+)-(4R)-trans-2-(4-fluororphenyl)-5-(1-methylethyl)-N,3- diphenyl-1- [(tetrahydro-4-hydroxy-6-oxo-2H-pyran-2-yl)ethyl]-1H-pyrrole-4- carboxamide) with five times the inhibitory potency of the fungal metabolite compactin.", 
    "68": "Human monocyte-derived macrophages were incubated for 48 hours in Medium 199 with 1% human serum albumin, and with 100 micrograms acetyl low density lipoprotein (LDL) or beta-very low density lipoprotein (beta-VLDL), with or without various concentrations of compactin, lovastatin, simvastatin, or pravastatin. The mass of free (FC) and esterified (CE) cholesterol was determined, as well as the incorporation of [1-14C]acetate in sterols, that of [1-14C]oleate in CE, and that of [methyl-14C]choline in phospholipids. Moreover, we assessed the high-affinity association and degradation of 125I-labeled acetyl LDL. Compactin markedly decreased the cellular accumulation of CE induced by acetyl LDL or beta-VLDL and increased the content of FC. Compactin also decreased the incorporation of [1-14C]oleate in CE (by 70-90%) in incubations with or without added lipoproteins. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration for this effect of compactin was 30 nM. Lovastatin and simvastatin were more potent, but pravastatin was about 100-fold less potent. Although compactin also caused a clear inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in the presence of acetyl LDL, the effect on CE formation did not seem to be related to decreased cholesterol synthesis, since this was already very low in the presence of acetyl LDL. Compactin did not affect the association and degradation of labeled acetyl LDL and also had no effect on the rate of cholesterol loss after preloading the cells with CE by incubation with acetyl LDL. However, compactin had a slight stimulatory effect on the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin when compactin was added to incubations in the presence of acetyl LDL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "69": "The present study was performed to determine the influence of pharmaceutical intervention on parameters of blood coagulation and fibrinolysis in hypercholesterolemic patients. Eighteen otherwise-healthy individuals with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia were treated with a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (simvastatin, 40 mg daily) for 12-14 weeks followed by additional treatment with omega-3 fatty acids (equivalent to 4 g eicosapentaenoic acid/docosahexaenoic acid daily) for 6 more weeks. With simvastatin treatment, the mean decreases in total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B (apo B) were 39%, 46%, and 36%, respectively. Only minor changes in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and apo A-1 were recorded. omega-3 fatty acids had minor additional effects. The most prominent effects on the blood coagulation system were the changes in extrinsic pathway inhibitor (EPI), which is the inhibitor of the factor VIIa-tissue thromboplastin complex. EPI activity decreased from a median of 153% to 111% (p less than 0.001) with simvastatin treatment and to 112% (p less than 0.001) on the combined regimen. EPI activity was significantly correlated with LDL cholesterol (r = 0.78), total cholesterol (r = 0.77), apo B (r = 0.65), and apo A-1 (r = 0.45). Multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that LDL cholesterol was the most important predictor of EPI activity, which suggests that a majority of EPI activity in plasma is associated with LDL. Moreover, the alteration in EPI activity was correlated closely with the corresponding alteration in LDL, which suggests a direct relation between a coagulation-inhibitor activity and a pharmaceutical lipid-related response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "70": "In the Expanded Clinical Evaluation of Lovastatin (EXCEL) Study, a multicenter, double-blind, diet- and placebo-controlled trial, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of lovastatin in 8245 patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia. Patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or lovastatin at a dosage of 20 mg once daily, 40 mg once daily, 20 mg twice daily, or 40 mg twice daily for 48 weeks. Lovastatin produced sustained, dose-related (P less than .001) changes as follows (for dosages of 20 to 80 mg/d): decreased low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level (24% to 40%), increased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level (6.6% to 9.5%), decreased total cholesterol level (17% to 29%), and decreased triglyceride level (10% to 19%). The National Cholesterol Education Program's low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level goal of less than 4.14 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) was achieved by 80% to 96% of patients, while the less than 3.36 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) goal was achieved by 38% to 83% of patients. The difference between lovastatin and placebo in the incidence of clinical adverse experiences requiring discontinuation was small, ranging from 1.2% at 20 mg twice daily to 1.9% at 80 mg/d. Successive transaminase level elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal were observed in 0.1% of patients receiving placebo and 20 mg/d of lovastatin, increasing to 0.9% in those receiving 40 mg/d and 1.5% in those receiving 80 mg/d of lovastatin (P less than .001 for trend). Myopathy, defined as muscle symptoms with a creatine kinase elevation greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal, was found in only one patient (0.1%) receiving 40 mg once daily and four patients (0.2%) receiving 80 mg/d of lovastatin. Thus, lovastatin, when added after an adequate trial of a prudent diet, is a highly effective and generally well-tolerated treatment for patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "71": "The effects of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors lovastatin and pravastatin were studied over 4 months on serum lipids and lipoproteins in 35 patients with severe primary hypercholesterolaemia. In 17 patients 20 mg of lovastatin/day lowered the total cholesterol level by 18% (baseline 373 mg/dl) and LDL cholesterol by 20% (baseline 300 mg/dl). The corresponding data for 40 and 80 mg of lovastatin/day were respectively -23% and -29% for total cholesterol, and -30% and -36% for LDL cholesterol. Pravastatin at 20 mg/day lowered the total cholesterol in 18 patients by 20% (baseline 373 mg/dl) and LDL cholesterol by 24% (baseline 307 mg/dl). The corresponding data for 40 mg of pravastatin per day were 24% for total cholesterol and 30% for LDL cholesterol. So the effects of both HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on total and LDL cholesterol are comparable. HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol was increased by lovastatin, whereas pravastatin showed no influence on HDL cholesterol. The reduction of serum triglycerides, VLDL triglycerides and VLDL cholesterol was more pronounced under treatment with lovastatin than under pravastatin.", 
    "72": "The results of 12 weeks treatment of primary hyperlipidemias with Lovastatin are presented. This drug belonging to a new generation of hypercholesterolemic drugs inhibits the endogenous synthesis of cholesterol by means of inhibiting the HMG-CoA reductase. The sample consisted of 30 men aged 28-68 years: in 17 of them heterozygotic familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) was diagnosed and in 13--primary non familial hypercholesterolemia (NFH). After 12 weeks of treatment in both groups a significant reduction of total serum cholesterol concentration was observed--(-28%) and--(-32%) as well as LDL-cholesterol concentration (in both groups about -37%) and apo B concentration--(-32%) and -34%. Only in one patients with NFH a significant reduction of VLDL-cholesterol (-29%) and or triglycerides (-15%) concentrations was observed. In this group also a 9% increase of HLD-cholesterol, mainly HDL-2 concentration, was found. Side effects were observed in 6 patients--in 4 of them a minor increase of ALAT, AsPAT or CPK activities (less than 3 times above norm were observed) without any symptoms and with a spontaneous normalization with no need to stop treatment, and in 2 of them abdominal pains not causing drug treatment cessation.", 
    "73": "A general method for the rapid verification of both identity and content of complete solid drug formulations has been devised. Infrared spectra for the samples were recorded using the diffuse reflectance technique, and specially written software was employed to identify the type of formulation and level of active ingredient. This software was devised to ensure reliable use when applied by those with minimal operator skills. Three differing drug tablet formulations containing simvastatin, enalapril maleate and lovastatin, as well as a capsule formulation containing finastride were studied. Adequate precision was obtained to reliably verify drug dosage levels. Near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) spectrometers were evaluated for use with the method. The MIR instrument allowed sufficient resolution and spectral/structural selectivity to reliably verify correctness of either of two near derivative drugs necessarily present in the same clinical study. Drug tablet and capsule dosage levels tested ranged from 0.2 to 40 mg of drug. Approximately 1% (w/w) of the drug in the formulation was the minimum amount determined. Parameters affecting method ruggedness in routine use were optimized. Experimental addition of an extraneous material to a simvastatin formulation was easily detected and flagged by the routine test procedure. Subsequent data retrieval and searching against spectral libraries was used to demonstrate identification of the additive.", 
    "74": "The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have been shown to cause marked reduction of cholesterol and offer a new and effective approach to treatment of hyperlipoproteinemia. Three agents, pravastatin (P), lovastatin (L) and simvastatin (S), have been studied with reference to long-term lipid-lowering effect, tolerance and clinical safety. Following a dietary lead-in period of at least 6 weeks in every case, patients with primary hypercholesterolemia were enrolled from participants of short-term controlled studies which after completion were extended as open studies. Treatment was administered over 6 months with 20 mg S (84 patients), L (42 patients) or P (23 patients) twice daily. Total cholesterol was decreased with S by 30.2% of basal, with L by 25.5%, and with P by 28.2%. The decrease in apolipoprotein B was 28.4%, of basal, with S 16.4% and in P 19.2%. Triglycerides were lowered by 19.6% of basal with S by 17.4%, with L, and by 6.4% with HDL-cholesterol increased in the S group by 23% of basal, by 9.7% in the L group, and by 8.0% in the P group. No serious clinical or laboratory abnormalities were observed. In the S group headache (3.6% of patients), abdominal discomfort (2.4%), sleeping disturbances (3.6%), and muscle pain (2.4%) were reported. In the L group headache (7.1%), abdominal discomfort (4.8%), sleep disorders (4.8%), and muscle pain (4.8%) were observed. In the P group one patient complained of abdominal discomfort (8.7%) and one of sleep disorders (8.7%).

    "75": "In subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia cholesterol absorption efficiency was insignificantly reduced during a short-term more consistently during long-term pravastatin treatment. A cholesterol feeding had no effect on LDL cholesterol level but reduced absorption efficiency during a long-term lovastatin treatment.", 
    "76": "Pravastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin are HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors with very similar structures. However, minor substitutions in the decalin ring have resulted in major differences in physiocochemical, pharmacological, and pharmacokinetic properties. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that lovastatin and simvastatin are non-selective lipophilic inhibitors, while pravastatin is a selective hydrophilic inhibitor. An extensive clinical pharmacology program has been conducted for pravastatin. Radiolabelled studies demonstrated oral absorption and bioavailability values of 34% and 17%, respectively. The parent drug is cleared equally by renal and non-renal routes. Peak blood level after oral administration is reached at approximately 1 h and the mean plasma elimination half-life is 1.8 h. Binding of total radioactivity to plasma proteins averages 45%. Non-radiolabelled studies showed that mean areas under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) and maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) are proportional to the doses administered, whereas times to reach Cmax (Tmax) and plasma elimination half-life values are independent of dose. Measurement of trough plasma concentrations of pravastatin at steady state showed no evidence of drug accumulation. Pharmacodynamic studies demonstrated an average LDL-C decrease of 30-35% at a daily dose of 40 mg. HDL-C increases are between 10% and 25% and triglyceride decreases, between 10% and 25%. These results indicate that pravastatin is very effective in lowering LDL-C. With its consistent decrease in triglycerides and increase in HDL-C, pravastatin offers a well-balanced lipid-modulating response.", 
    "77": "This study compared the efficacy and safety of pravastatin and gemfibrozil in the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia. Three hundred eighty-five outpatients from 13 lipid clinics in Italy participated in this randomized double-blind study. Patients were assigned to receive either 40 mg once daily of pravastatin or 600 mg of gemfibrozil twice daily after an initial diet lead-in period. After 24 weeks, mean reductions from baseline values of plasma total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were, respectively, 23% and 30% with pravastatin and 14% and 17% with gemfibrozil. Significant lipid-lowering effects were noted within 4 weeks. Apolipoprotein B decrease was 21% with pravastatin and 13% with gemfibrozil. A statistically significant increase of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 5% was achieved with pravastatin compared with a 13% increase for gemfibrozil. Serum triglyceride values decreased 5% with pravastatin and 37% with gemfibrozil. Familial and polygenic hypercholesterolemic patients were also examined separately. Pravastatin effectiveness in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was greater by 6% in polygenic than in familial hypercholesterolemic patients. Treatment for 25 patients (eight treated with pravastatin and 17 treated with gemfibrozil) was discontinued during the study. The incidence of clinical symptoms and laboratory alterations was low for both treatment groups. Pravastatin and gemfibrozil were well tolerated, but pravastatin was significantly more effective in reducing total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in primary (either familial or polygenic) hypercholesterolemias than gemfibrozil."
