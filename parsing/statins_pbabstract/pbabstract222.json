We aimed to describe the usage pattern, effectiveness and tolerability of long-term treatment with lipid-lowering agents, with particular focus on an oral combination of simvastatin (SIM 10, 20, 40 or 80 mg) plus ezetimibe (EZ 10 mg).", 
    "1": "A prospective, observational study in 512 general practices throughout Germany. From a sample of patients at moderate or high cardiovascular risk who had previously taken part in a half-year study of an SIM/EZ combination, 5485 patients were documented after 1 year of treatment (mean 58 +/- 16 weeks) with regard to lipid parameters, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and adverse events.", 
    "2": "At the start of follow-up, 78.6% of patients were still on the SIM/EZ combination. At the end of follow-up, mean low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients on the combination versus those on other lipid-lowering therapy was reduced by 29.3 vs. 17.6% compared with baseline, total cholesterol by 23.1 vs. 14.5%, mean high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was increased by 15.9 vs. 13.4%, and mean triglycerides were reduced by 16.1 vs. 7.9%. Individual LDL-C targets were achieved by 56.6% on the SIM/EZ combination versus 35.9% on other therapy. In the long term (but not the short term), low acceptance of nutrition counselling as rated by the physician was associated with poor lipid levels. ADRs during follow-up occurred in 18 patients (0.3%; all cases non-serious), with seven cases of myalgia, and three cases each of nausea or arthralgia.",

    "4": "Statin-induced myopathy is well-known, but the effect of cholesterol-lowering agents on myasthenia gravis (MG) has not been studied in detail. We investigated statin use and its effects on MG among patients with this disease. Statin information was systemically obtained from 170 patients being treated at the Neuromuscular Disease Clinic at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. When a new myalgic syndrome or worsening of MG developed within 4 months after statin treatment, no other likely cause was found, and clinical improvement occurred either with or without discontinuation of the statin, we considered these symptoms to be statin-induced. Fifty-four patients (31%) were on statins. The statin group had proportionally more males, and older patients compared with the non-statin group. A myalgic syndrome was noted in 7 (13%) patients, but it resolved without any sequelae after withdrawal of the statin. MG worsening occurred in 6 (11%) patients without regard to type of MG or brand of statin. MG worsening occurred independently of myalgic syndrome and involved predominantly oculobulbar symptoms within 1-16 weeks of statin treatment. In 4 patients, additional treatment was needed to reverse MG worsening. Statins are safe in the majority of MG patients, but their use must be accompanied by close observation for possible MG worsening.", 
    "5": "Drug combination therapies for central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS) are gaining momentum over monotherapy. Over the past decade, both in vitro and in vivo studies established that statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) and rolipram (phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor; blocks the degradation of intracellular cyclic AMP) can prevent the progression of MS in affected individuals via different mechanisms of action. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of lovastatin (LOV) and rolipram (RLP) in combination therapy to promote neurorepair in an inflammatory CNS demyelination model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Combination treatment with suboptimal doses of these drugs in an established case of EAE (clinical disease score > or = 2.0) significantly attenuated the infiltration of inflammatory cells and protected myelin sheath and axonal integrity in the CNS. It was accompanied with elevated level of cyclic AMP and activation of its associated protein kinase A. Interestingly, combination treatment with these drugs impeded neurodegeneration and promoted neurorepair in established EAE animals (clinical disease score > or = 3.5) as verified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopic analyses. These effects of combination therapy were minimal and/or absent with either drug alone in these settings. Together, these data suggest that combination therapy with LOV and RLP has the potential to provide neuroprotection and promote neurorepair in MS, and may have uses in other related CNS demyelinating diseases.", 
    "6": "Atorvastatin is a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor that is mainly metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. A recent study showed that the lipid-lowering effect of statins is affected by the CYP3A5 polymorphism. Therefore, it was investigated whether CYP3A5 contributes to the metabolism of atorvastatin. Two metabolites of atorvastatin, para- and ortho-hydroxyatorvastatin, were produced by human liver microsomes and human recombinant CYP3A enzymes, and the enzyme kinetic pattern exhibited substrate inhibition. The intrinsic clearance (CL(int)) rates of para- and ortho-hydroxyatorvastatin by CYP3A4 were 2.4- and 5.0-fold of the respective CL(int) rates of CYP3A5, indicating that CYP3A4 is the major P450 isoform responsible for atorvastatin metabolism. These results suggest that atorvastatin is preferentially metabolized by CYP3A4 rather than by CYP3A5, and thus the genetic CYP3A5 polymorphism might not be an important factor in the inter-individual variation of atorvastatin disposition and pharmacodynamics in human.", 
    "7": "Self-nanoemulsifying granules were formulated with the objective of improving the bioavailability of the ezetimibe and simvastatin when administered together. Composition of self-nanoemulsifying system (SNS) was optimized using various modified oils, surfactant, and cosurfactant mixtures. SNSs were mixed with water and resultant emulsions were characterized for mean globule size and stability. SNSs were adsorbed on hydrophilic colloidal silicon dioxide to give free-flowing self-nanoemulsifying granules. Self-nanoemulsifying granules were characterized by X-ray diffraction pattern, scanning electron microscopy, dissolution profile, and for in vivo performance in hypercholesterolemic rats. X-ray diffraction studies and scanning electron microscopy indicated loss of crystallinity and/or solubilization of both drugs in the self-nanoemulsifying granules. Self-nanoemulsifying granules effected substantial increase in dissolution of the drugs as compared with pure powder of drugs. In vivo evaluation in rats showed significant decrease in the total cholesterol levels and triglyceride levels in rats as compared with positive control confirming potential of self-nanoemulsifying granules as a drug delivery system for the poorly water-soluble drugs.", 
    "8": "Valve replacement is the only long-term effective treatment for calcific aortic valve stenosis. However, this treatment is aimed only at patients with advanced leaflet disease and symptoms of left ventricular obstruction. Over the past 15 years, our understanding of the pathogenesis of calcific aortic stenosis has changed significantly: away from a passive degenerative disease to an active process involving endothelial dysfunction, lipid accumulation, an inflammatory infiltrate, and a regulated process of calcification. Since many of the same processes are characteristic of atherosclerosis, trials have been undertaken to test whether medical therapy (statins, renin-angiotensin inhibition) can prevent or alter the disease course. Although retrospective and non-randomized studies suggested a positive effect with statins, benefit has not been seen in perspective randomized controlled trials, although two major studies are still in progress. Inhibition of renin-angiotensin has shown discordant results in retrospective studies with no randomized controlled data published. In the future, we need to consider other medical therapies that might target different pathways in this disease process. In addition, we need to define the optimal timing and duration of therapy for this chronic slowly progressive disease; treatments aimed at the early disease process may be ineffective with end-stage tissue changes.", 
    "9": "Acute pretreatment with a single i.v. bolus injection of simvastatin (1 mg/kg) significantly protects rat kidney injured by ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) (45 min + 6 h). We aimed to determine the optimal timing of such a pretreatment. The effects of both injections of simvastatin before ischemia and reperfusion were similar regarding total histological score. However, simvastatin injected 30 min before ischemia was 30% - 75% more effective in reduction of serum creatinine levels and interstitial edema score, while its injections 5 and 30 min before reperfusion were 25% - 60% more effective in reduction of tubular necrosis score and fractional excretion of Na+. However, the observed differences do not seem to offer significant advantage in clinical settings.", 
    "10": "Insulin resistance and subsequent insulin secretory defect are two main features of type 2 diabetes and associated metabolic disorders. The animal models of type 2 diabetes are very complex and are as heterogeneous as the disease. We have evaluated the effect of various antidiabetic and lipid lowering agents (fenofibrate, rosiglitazone, glimepiride, metformin and simvastatin) on the metabolic abnormalities induced by combining a high-fat diet and multiple low-dose streptozocin (MLDS) in mice. Male Swiss albino mice were orally treated with the above agents and fed with a diet containing high fat for 28 days. On day 15 the animals were injected intraperitoneally with low-dose streptozocin (40 mg kg(-1)), which was administered for five consecutive days. At the end of the 28-day treatment plasma metabolic parameters (glucose, triglyceride and immunoreactive insulin) were estimated. The antidiabetic and hypolipidaemic agents exhibited differential effects on these metabolic parameters. With the exception of fenofibrate all these agents reduced the plasma glucose levels, and the effects of metformin and rosiglitazone on glucose were found to be statistically significant. Although the effect of the test drugs on cholesterol was modest, a significant decrease in triglyceride levels was observed with sub-chronic treatment with these agents. Interestingly, glimepiride mildly elevated the insulin levels while the other antidiabetics and hypolipidaemics reduced the insulin levels, with metformin and rosiglitazone exhibiting statistically significant effects on insulin. To our knowledge this is the first report on the effect of various peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor modulators and newer antidiabetics on the metabolic effects induced by the combined high-fat diet and MLDS model of type 2 diabetes in Swiss albino mice. The results suggested the complexity of the hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia induced by the high-fat diet and MLDS mouse model, and their correction by various antidiabetics and antihyperlipidaemics may have involved diverse mechanisms.", 
    "11": "We investigated the effects of co-administration of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) on nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability in genetically hyperlipidemic rabbits with our newly developed NO sensor. A total of 36 myocardial infarction-prone Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHLMI) rabbits equally derived (n=6 per group) were treated with 1) vehicle (control), 2) hydralazine (15 mg/kg/d), 3) the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor pitavastatin (P: 0.5 mg/kg/d), 4) the ARB valsartan (V: 5 mg/kg/d), and 5) pitavastatin+valsartan (P+V) together without or 6) with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) for 8 weeks. After treatment, acetylcholine (ACh)-induced NO production was measured as a surrogate for endothelium protective function, and vascular peroxynitrite (a product of superoxide and NO) was measured for assessing dysfunctional endothelial NO synthase activity. Plaque area was quantified by histology as well as optical coherence tomography (OCT). Intra-aortic infusion of ACh produced an increase in plasma NO concentration, which was significantly greater with all drug treatments than with the control. P+V increased ACh-induced NO by 4.1 nmol/L significantly more than either P or V singly. The vascular peroxynitrite concentration was 1.6 pmol/mg protein in the control group and significantly less than those in the P- and V-monotherapy-groups. The lowest peroxynitrite concentration was observed in the P+V group (0.4 pmol/mg protein), which was significantly lower than those in the P- and the V-monotherapy-groups. OCT and histology of the thoracic aorta revealed that the plaque area decreased significantly more with the combination than with the monotherapy. In conclusion, the combined treatment with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and an ARB may have additive protective effects on endothelial function as well as atherosclerotic change.", 
    "12": "It is widely accepted that statin treatment improves survival in patients with myocardial infarction. Evidence also suggests that aggressive statin treatment is superior than standard dose during the post-infarction period. However, the exact mechanisms are still not well understood. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) play a key role in vascular homeostasis, since they contribute to the repair of damaged endothelium post-myocardial infarction, while they induce neoangiogenesis. Recent evidence suggests that statins may exert their beneficial effect in patients with recent myocardial infarction, by inducing EPC mobilization, and this may be a key mechanism by which statins improve survival in these patients. However, large scale clinical trials remain to prove that aggressive statin treatment is superior than standard dose in these patients, by inducing a more effective EPC mobilization.", 
    "13": "Renal diseases induce nephroprotective measures that may affect the heart, brain and other organs. In addition, many cardiovascular and neurological diseases are accompanied by renal lesions. For these reasons, multiorgan-protective measures, including cardio-, reno- and neuro-protective measures, are necessary to treat these diseases. The drugs used in nephrology are often pleiotropic. Although they usually address a single organ or tissue, many of them have complex actions that may provide multiorgan-protection. The present paper aims to review 3 classes of drugs that are commonly prescribed in nephrological practice: statins, RAS blockers (such as ACEIs and ARBs) and erythropoietin (EPO). This paper highlights the renoprotective actions, as well as those that are protective of the heart, brain and other organs, of these drugs at the cellular and molecular level. Their protective actions are attributable to their main effects and pleiotropic effects. The protective pleiotropic actions of these drugs may be exerted on multiple organs, making them multiorgan-protective. Another objective is to analyse the shared multiorgan-protective pleiotropic effects of RAS blockers (ACEIs and ARBs), statins and erythropoietin. This will allow for the practical association of the main renoprotective drugs with multiorgan protection.",

    "16": "The big majority (80,9%) of the doctors declared to follow the international consensus for the control of the dyslipemia. The cardiovascular risk factor was occasionally calculated by 58% of the doctors, whereas the biochemical parameter most commonly used was LDL-cholesterol (89,7) followed by the total cholesterol (57,7%), HDL-cholesterol (55,7%) and triglycerides (53,1%). The optimal target of LDL-cholesterol in primary prevention was <130 mg/dL (66,6% of doctors) whereas in secondary prevention was <100 mg/dL (81,7% of doctors). In the case where a dyslipidemic patient is regularly controlled, 76,6% of the doctors, maintained treatment and 22,3% decreases it. In the case where a dyslipidemic patient is not regularly controlled, 62,3% of the doctors would recommend hygienic-dietetic treatment and the 66,9% would recommend pharmacological treatment. The best valued statin among the doctors was atorvastatin. The 69,1% of the doctors usually realise further analytical controls of ALT, AST and CPK to evaluate the statin tolerance. The 60,6% of the doctors declared that their patients follow their treatment.",

    "18": "The statins, a group of inhibitors of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, are reported to influence a variety of immune system activities through 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase-dependent and -independent mechanisms. How statin treatment regulates immune system function in vivo nonetheless remains to be fully defined. We analyzed the immunomodulatory effects of lovastatin in a Candida albicans-induced delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction in mice. In this model, lovastatin administration reduced the acute inflammatory response elicited by C. albicans challenge. This anti-inflammatory activity of lovastatin was associated with a shift from a Th1 to a Th2 immune response, as well as an increase in the percentage of regulatory T cells at the inflammation site and in the regional draining lymph node. The lovastatin-induced increase in regulatory T cells in the inflamed skin was dependent on expression of CCL1, a chemokine that is locally up-regulated by statin administration. The anti-inflammatory effect of lovastatin was abrogated in CCL1-deficient mice. These results suggest that local regulation of chemokine expression may be an important process in statin-induced modulation of the immune system.", 
    "19": "The 5-lipoxygenase (5LO) produces leukotriene B(4) and 15-epilipoxin-A(4) (15-epi-LXA(4)). Phosphorylation at Ser(523) by protein kinase A (PKA) prevents 5LO shift to the perinuclear membrane. Atorvastatin and pioglitazone up-regulate 15-epi-LXA(4) production in the heart. We assessed whether phosphorylation of 5LO by PKA determines whether 5LO interacts with the membranous cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) to produce leukotriene B(4) or with cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) to produce 15-epi-LXA(4). Rats received either pioglitazone, atorvastatin, pioglitazone plus atorvastatin, vehicle, or LPS. Rat myocardial cells were incubated with pioglitazone plus atorvastatin, pioglitazone plus atorvastatin plus H-89 (PKA inhibitor), H-89, or vehicle for 8 h. Pioglitazone and atorvastatin did not affect total 5LO expression. However, both increased 5LO levels in the cytosolic fraction. H-89 caused a shift of 5LO to the membranous fraction in atorvastatin- and pioglitazone-treated rats. Pioglitazone and atorvastatin increased phospho-5LO levels. H-89 attenuated this increase. Both pioglitazone and atorvastatin increased COX2 levels in the cytosolic fraction and the membranous fraction. H-89 prevented this increase. Pioglitazone and atorvastatin increased cPLA(2) expression in the membranous fraction. This effect was not attenuated by H-89. Pioglitazone plus atorvastatin increased 15-epi-LXA(4) levels. H-89 attenuated the effect of pioglitazone plus atorvastatin. Pioglitazone plus atorvastatin plus H-89 increased leukotriene B(4) levels. Coimmunoprecipitation showed that without H-89, atorvastatin and pioglitazone induced an interaction between 5LO and COX2 in the cytosolic fraction, whereas when H-89 was added, 5LO interacted with cPLA(2) on the membranous fraction. The 5LO phosphorylation determines whether 15-epi-LXA(4) (anti-inflammatory) or leukotriene B(4) (inflammatory mediator) is produced.", 
    "20": "A molecular complex of simvastatin (SV) and glycyrrhyzic acid (GA) (at the ratio of 1 : 4), has been synthesized. The complex named \"simvaglyzin\" (SVG) was stable in aqeous and aqua-alcohol solutions at GA concentrations exceeding 0.2 mM. In vitro SVG acted as uncompetitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (Ki = 94 nM). Appearance of this inhibitory activity is associated with the cytochrome P450-dependent conversion of SVG. The addition of 1 mM methyrapone into incubation medium fully prevented the inhibition of 3-HMG-CoA reductase. SV and SVG (used at 300 nM concentration) inhibited mevalonate synthesis rate by 39.15+/-8.27% and 38.85+/-3.04%, respectively. In vivo SVG showed dose-dependent cholesterol-lowering effect. In rats the cholesterol-lowering effect of SVG used at daily doses corresponding to 66 and 100 mg/kg of SV was equal to the effect of the daily dose 200 mg/kg of SV. The decreases of total cholesterol level in blood serum were 7%, 9% and 8%, respectively. Myotoxicity of those SVG doses estimated by creatine phosphokinase (CPK) activity in blood serum was lower than that of SV. In rats treated with SV the activity of CPK increased by 79% (p<0.01), while in SVG treated rats by 30% and 36% (p<0.05). Any increase of hepatotoxicity markers alanine aminotransferse or aspartate aminotransferase in blood serum was not observed. The data suggest pharmacological synergism attributed to the SV-GA complex formation and elevated safety of the resultant complex compared with the parent compound.",

These laws have been used here for consideration of mechanisms of occurrence and development of apoptosis and also side-effects of statins.

Treatment goals are well established, although treatment guidelines continue to evolve in response to new evidence and advances in therapy. Clinicians face significant challenges in managing this multifaceted and complex disease. Less than 12% of diagnosed patients reach treatment goals for blood glucose, cholesterol, and blood pressure. Treatment typically begins with the use of single-agent pharmacotherapy in conjunction with lifestyle modifications. As the disease progresses, other pharmacologic agents are added as treatment is intensified to achieve target goals.

A growing body of evidence supports recommendations for these tests in selected asymptomatic individuals deemed to be at intermediate risk of CVD according to traditional risk-factor assessments and who do not already warrant chronic treatment with aspirin and statin therapy. Data suggests that these high-sensitivity assays should be used in combination with measurements of LDL-cholesterol levels to assist risk stratification of selected patients for prevention of CVD.",

Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) and digital ulceration are prominent manifestations of vascular involvement in SSc. Digital ulcers (DU) remain a serious complication, and effective therapy remains elusive. Statins display pleiotropic effects on endothelial function that may potentially retard vascular injury. We evaluated the potential efficacy of statin therapy in endothelial dysfunction and in management of RP and DU.",

Seventy-five healthy volunteers served as controls. Assessment of RP and DU was performed monthly. The primary outcome measure was the number of DU. Secondary endpoints included the modified Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (SHAQ-DI), safety, and tolerability. Measurement of functional status in relation to RP included the SHAQ-DI, visual analog scale (VAS) for RP, DU and pain scales, and VAS for physician's global assessment for health. Endothelial damage markers were also assessed. Endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilatation was measured by high-resolution echo-Doppler ultrasonography.",

Among patients in the statin group a mean of 1.6 new ulcers developed per patient compared to 2.5 new ulcers per patient in the placebo group. There was a statistically significant improvement in SHAQ-DI score in patients receiving statin versus those on placebo. VAS for RP, DU severity, and pain scales and the VAS for physician global assessment improved significantly in the statin group compared to the placebo group. Endothelial markers of activation showed statistically significant improvement from baseline values in the statin versus the placebo group.",

The evolution in clinical practice has substantially reduced mortality and morbidity associated with the condition. Key to this success is the effective integration of antithrombotic therapy combined with timely reperfusion, either primary percutaneous coronary intervention or fibrinolysis for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and invasive investigation and revascularisation for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, underpinned by risk stratification and optimised systems of care. After the development of troponin assays for the detection of myonecrosis, the universal definition and classification of myocardial infarction now indicates the underlying pathophysiology. Additionally, an increasing appreciation of the importance of adverse events, such as bleeding, has emerged. Remaining challenges include the effective translation of this evidence to all patients with myocardial infarction, especially to those not well represented in clinical trials who remain at increased risk of adverse events, such as elderly patients and those with renal failure. On a global level, the epidemic of diabetes and obesity in the developed world and the transition from infectious diseases to cardiovascular disease in the developing world will place an increasing demand on health-care infrastructures required to deliver time-dependent and resource-intensive care.

Central to this role is the production of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (EDNO), synthesized by the endothelial isoform of nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Endothelial dysfunction, manifested as impaired EDNO bioactivity, is an important early event in the development of various vascular diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. The degree of impairment of EDNO bioactivity is a determinant of future vascular complications. Accordingly, growing interest exists in defining the pathologic mechanisms involved. Considerable evidence supports a causal role for the enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by vascular cells. ROS directly inactivate EDNO, act as cell-signaling molecules, and promote protein dysfunction, events that contribute to the initiation and progression of endothelial dysfunction. Increasing data indicate that strategies designed to limit vascular ROS production can restore endothelial function in humans with vascular complications. The purpose of this review is to outline the various ways in which ROS can influence endothelial function and dysfunction, describe the redox mechanisms involved, and discuss approaches for preventing endothelial dysfunction that may highlight future therapeutic opportunities in the treatment of cardiovascular disease.",

We studied whether single high dose statin loading is beneficial on the outcome of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) underwent PCI.", 
    "45": "Consecutive 445 patients with ACS who underwent PCI were randomly assigned to either the group of no statin treatment before PCI (Control group: n=220, 63+/-11 years, male 62%) or the group of 40 mg rosuvastatin loading before PCI (Rosuvastatin group: n=225, 64+/-10 years, male 60%). Incidence of periprocedural myocardial injury was assessed by analysis of creatinine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and cardiac troponin T before PCI, at 6 h and the next morning after PCI.", 
    "46": "There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics between the two groups. After PCI, incidence of periprocedural myocardial injury was higher in control than in rosuvastatin group (11.4% versus 5.8%, p=0.035). Mean preprocedural CK-MB and high sensitivity C-reactive protein were similar between the two groups, whereas after PCI, peak values of both markers were elevated significantly higher in control than in rosuvastatin group. Multivariate analysis revealed that no prior use of statin (OR=2.2; 95% CI=1.1-4.6; p=0.029), procedural complication (OR=3.1; 95% CI=1.4-6.9; p=0.007) and multi-vessel disease (OR=2.6; 95% CI=1.0-6.6; p=0.039) were the independent predictors for periprocedural myocardial infarction.",

    "48": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are currently the drug of choice for the clinical management of elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Although statin treatment provides an overall improvement in outcomes, clinical trial data reveal a significant number of cardiac events despite reaching targeted LDL levels. A low serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level is an independent predictor of cardiovascular risk. Accordingly, there has been interest in determining whether HDL elevation, in addition to LDL lowering, further reduces risk in patients with coronary artery disease. Several commonly prescribed lipid-lowering therapies modestly raise HDL, but their use may be limited by the development of adverse reactions. Emerging data suggest that HDL quality and function may also be significantly reduced by atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases. The goal of this review is to discuss the current status of HDL therapeutics, with emphasis on a novel class of agent, the apolipoprotein A-I mimetic peptides, which improve the functional properties of HDL cholesterol.", 
    "49": "Triglycerides (TGs) are now considered an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). When TGs are elevated, lipoprotein metabolism is altered, which increases CVD risk. Patients with elevated TGs and low high-density lipoprotein are at particularly high risk of CVD. TGs are often associated with other CVD risk factors, such as obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, low HDL cholesterol, lifestyle factors, and changes in lipoprotein size and density. Elevated TGs remain an independent risk even when controlling for the other factors and are a greater risk for women than men. Treatment of elevated TGs in clinical trials has been shown to reduce CVD events, cardiac deaths, and total mortality.", 
    "50": "Despite many post hoc analyses of cardiovascular databases in recent years suggesting a benefit of statins in the prevention and treatment of congestive heart failure (HF), a prospective study of statin therapy on two clinically relevant end points--HF morbidity and survival--had not been reported until 2007. However, a large-scale prospective trial, Controlled Rosuvastatin Multinational Trial in Heart Failure (CORONA), has just reported its primary results. These results somewhat surprisingly show no survival benefit in a group of patients with ischemic systolic HF given low-dose rosuvastatin. In addition to this uncertainty generated by the results of CORONA, there remains additional uncertainty in the existing, predominantly retrospective data on statins because of the potential bias in study designs, use of post hoc subgroup analyses, and lack of mechanistic data. This review critically evaluates the recent literature in this area.", 
    "51": "A single pill containing a statin, thiazide diuretic, beta-blocker, angiotensin receptor antagonist, folate and ASA has been proposed for all people over age 55, with the aim of reducing cardiovascular disease by 80%. Unfortunately, there are insurmountable problems with choosing appropriate constituents of any such single remedy. Adverse effects, drug interactions, inter-individual variation in drug metabolism, and underlying causes of hypertension that differ between patients require individualized therapy. A single pill that will succeed in all patients is not only practically, but conceptually, an inappropriate approach for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "52": "There is growing experimental and clinical evidence that by reducing downstream products of the mevalonate pathway other than cholesterol, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors ('statins') have beneficial effects on endothelial function, coronary and cerebral blood flow, inflammation, and hemostasis. Statins have been shown in rodent models of acute ischemic stroke to reduce neuronal injury and infarct size in a dose-dependent fashion. The objective of this early phase trial will be to determine the maximal-tolerated dose of lovastatin for short-term acute stroke therapy. In this multicenter phase 1B dose-escalation and dose-finding study, 33 patients with acute ischemic stroke will be administered lovastatin in increasing doses from one to 10 mg/kg daily for 3 days beginning within 24 hours after symptom onset. The primary safety outcome will be occurrence of myotoxicity or hepatotoxicity, defined by clinical and laboratory criteria, and the study is designed to determine the highest dose of lovastatin that can be administered with <10% risk of myotoxicity or hepatotoxicity. The statistical design of the study utilizes an adaptive design, the Continual Reassessment Method, which is novel to stroke trials, to find the optimal dosage. The dose-toxicity model is calibrated such that the method will eventually select a dose that causes 7-13% dose-limiting toxicity (within 3% of target). A sample size of 33 will ensure that estimates of any binary variables will have a 95% confidence interval of width <or=0.34, and enable us to detect any unexpected toxicity that occurs at 5% rate (in a non-dose-dependent fashion) with probability 0.82. The probability of choosing a dose for further trials with 25% or higher likelihood of toxicity is no more than 23%. The presently described trial represents a new approach for treatment of acute ischemic stroke, as well as a novel way of conducting a phase I trial, evaluating safety and determining an optimal dose of a potential neuroprotectant drug.", 
    "53": "In 2006 the State supported the purchase of statins by some Euro 120 million for some 466,366 patients. While about 50% is for secondary prevention of heart disease a disproportionate number of women are receiving treatment for primary prevention. For proprietary agents the monthly cost was largely explained by price and dosage (mg/day) and the average varied from Euro 29.2 for rosuvastatin (11 mg), Euro 38.2 simvastatin (21 mg), Euro 39.1 atorvastatin (19 mg), Euro 42.7 pravastatin (21 mg) and Euro 31.8 for generic prava/simvastatin (21 mg). Generic substitution for pravastatin and simvastatin would save Euro 6.4m. Applying the drug prices corresponding in the United Kingdom would result in savings of some Euro 35m per annum. While the increasing use of statins is justified on cost benefit/analysis considerable savings could be made through choice of the more potent statins, a greater use of generics and a flatter dose price structure.",

Septic shock, the severe complication of sepsis associated with refractory hypotension, is frequently a near-fatal condition requiring prompt diagnosis and management. Although the recent years have been associated with considerable improvements in the knowledge of the pathophysiology of the disease and remarkable advances have been achieved in sepsis treatment, the morbidity and mortality of this disease are still unacceptably high. In this review, we will briefly discuss the ongoing standard treatment of septic shock and describe novel potential therapies, aiming to improve hemodynamic support and/or control inflammatory response in sepsis. These therapies were associated with benefits in experimental studies and have been tested or are currently under testing in randomized controlled studies with septic patients.", 
    "55": "The rate of stroke among warfarin-treated patients in SPORTIF V was approximately half that of patients enrolled in SPORTIF III (1.16%/year versus 2.30%/year). SPORTIF III was an open-label trial comparing ximelagatran with warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. SPORTIF V was a double-blind trial performed in North America. The trial design was otherwise identical. We sought to determine if differences in baseline characteristics, use of potentially risk-modifying medications, or anticoagulation control help to explain the lower risk of stroke among warfarin-treated patients in SPORTIF V.", 
    "56": "Cox regression with stepwise model selection was used to define the covariates independently associated with stroke. Secondary analyses identified covariates with the strongest influence on the study factor (V/III). These covariates were then added to the primary model. Cox regression was used to determine the degree of confounding exerted by these covariates that might help to explain the differences between the trials.", 
    "57": "Independent risk factors for stroke on warfarin included prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, coronary artery disease, international normalized ratio, weight, and study. Patients in SPORTIF V were at half the risk as those in SPORTIF III. We found that lower international normalized ratio variability, a higher proportion of prevalent warfarin use, lower systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein, and a greater proportion of statin use among patients in SPORTIF V collectively conferred a lower risk of stroke.", 
    "58": "Differences in blood pressure control, international normalized ratio variability, proportion of prevalent warfarin users, statin exposure, and high-density lipoprotein collectively conferred a lower risk of stroke to patients in SPORTIF V. These findings suggest that the different event rates were not due to chance and provide potential insights into stroke risk among warfarin-treated patients with atrial fibrillation.", 
    "59": "Current guidelines from large randomised trials recommend that all patients with diabetes type 2 or coronary artery disease after myocardial infarction should be treated with statin drugs. However, the recent 4D and CORONA trials show no improvement in mortality in elderly patients with ischaemic heart failure and patients with diabetes and end-stage renal disease receiving haemodialysis with the onset of statin treatment. The survival benefit from statin treatment appears to stem primarily from the prevention of progression of coronary artery disease. In clinical conditions where coronary artery disease does not significantly contribute to the cause of death statins seem to be less effective. In patients at risk for organ damage, statin treatment, therefore, has to be started early in the course of the disease. The effect of statin withdrawal in ischaemic heart failure or in patients with advanced renal disease is not known. On the basis of the available evidence, current statin treatment should not be stopped in these patients.", 
    "60": "Recent data suggest that statins may have a beneficial effect during sepsis. In this study, we tested the effect of lovastatin and pravastatin on the cellular culture of Rickettsia conorii using a quantitative plaque assay model associated with an original image analysis algorithm. Statins added at the time of infection did not modify plaque formation, whereas pre-incubation with statins for 48h resulted in a significant 30-68% plaque reduction, depending on the tested compounds and doses. These preliminary findings raise the hypothesis that statins may prevent or moderate rickettsial disease in exposed people.", 
    "61": "This study investigated the factors influencing the stability of amorphous simvastatin. Quench-cooled amorphous simvastatin in two particle size ranges, 150-180 microm (QC-big) and < or =10 microm (QC-small), and cryo-milled amorphous simvastatin (CM) were prepared, and their physical and chemical stability were investigated. Physical stability (crystallization) of amorphous simvastatin stored at two conditions was monitored by X-ray powder diffractometry (XRPD) and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). Assessment of enthalpy relaxation of amorphous forms was conducted using DSC in order to link the physical and chemical stability with molecular mobility. Chemical stability was studied with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results obtained from the current study revealed that the solubility of amorphous forms prepared by both methods was enhanced compared to the crystalline form. The rank of solubility was found to be QC-big=QC-small>CM>crystalline. For the physical stability, the highest crystallization rate was observed for CM, and the slowest rate was detected for QC-big, with an intermediate rate occurring for QC-small. QC exhibited lower molecular mobility and higher chemical degradation than CM. Therefore, the current study demonstrated that QC and CM have obvious differences in both physical and chemical properties. It was concluded that care should be taken when choosing preparation methods for making amorphous materials. Furthermore, particle size, a factor that has often been overlooked when dealing with amorphous materials, was shown to have an influence on physical stability of amorphous simvastatin.", 
    "62": "Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), which is activated by oxidative stress, plays an important role in the development of ventricular remodeling in coronary artery disease. Pravastatin is shown to reduce oxidative stress. We tested the hypothesis that cardiac oxidative stress and MMP activity are reduced in patients with coronary artery disease and treated with pravastatin. Forty-eight patients who underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) were studied. Twenty-four patients had the serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level >2.59 mM, and were treated with pravastatin (10 mg/day) for 2 months before CABG (pravastatin group). The other 24 had LDL cholesterol< or =2.59 mM, and were untreated (control group). The plasma and pericardial MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities were measured by gelatin zymography, and MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels, and pericardial 8-iso-prostagrandin F2alpha (8-iso-PGF2alpha) level, a maker of oxidative stress, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The plasma and pericardial MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities and levels were all lower by 20-30% in pravastatin than in control group (all P<0.05). The pericardial 8-iso-PGF2alpha level was lower in pravastatin than in control group (38+/-4 vs 64+/-7 pg/ml, P<0.05). The pericardial MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities were positively correlated with the pericardial 8-iso-PGF2alpha level (r=0.57 and 0.47, respectively, both P<0.01). Thus, cardiac oxidative stress and MMP activities are reduced in patients with coronary artery disease and treated with pravastatin, which may be beneficial in preventing and reducing ventricular remodeling.",

Therapy consisted of rosuvastatin (10 or 20 mg), atorvastatin (10 or 20 mg), or simvastatin (20 or 40 mg). The apoB and LDL-C or non-HDL-C at baseline and after 16 weeks of therapy were compared using linear regression.",

However, during statin therapy, to reach an apoB target of <90 mg/dl it was necessary to reduce non-HDL-C to <100 mg/dl or to reduce LDL-C to <70 mg/dl (in high-triglyceride patients) or <80 mg/dl (in lower-triglyceride patients). The tight correlation seen for non-HDL-C with apoB while on statin therapy (R(2) = 0.92) implies that non-HDL-C may be an acceptable surrogate for direct apoB measurement.",

However the effects of statins extend beyond their lipid-lowering actions, due to their capacity to inhibit prenylation of some intracellular regulatory proteins. Recent studies have shown that statins could modulate inflammantory response, improve endothelial function, exert antiarrhytmic properties, have beneficial effects on renal function and bone tissue. Statins may exert effect in the treament and prevention of dementia and some autoimmune disorders. Although statins therapy is generally well-tolerated, sometimes they lead to objective adverse effects, mainly in muscular system. Combination therapy with fibrates, coenzyme Q and other substances may increase and even extend therapeutic effects of statins. Further studies will help to clarify the clinical role of statins.",

However, how to promote the sensitivity of statins to mammary cancer is yet to be completely deciphered. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) overexpression sensitizes mammary cancer cells to statins. MCF-7 cells, which have only one wild-type BRCA1 allele, were transfected with pcDNA3-beta-HA-hsBRCA1 plasmids via liposomes to reconstitute BRCA1 overexpression human breast cancer cell line, and tumoral xenografts with BRCA1 overexpression were subsequently established in BALB/c nude mice. Then, the inhibitory activity of lovastatin on cancer cells and tumoral xenografts, and the underlying mechanism involving in cell-cycle regulatory proteins were analyzed. The proliferative ability of MCF-7 cells treated with lovastatin was reduced compared to normal, and further decreased in the presence of excess BRCA1, detected by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium and flow cytometry techniques in vitro or by 5-bromodeoxyuridine incorporation in vivo. Additionally, the mRNA and protein expression of cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and retinoblastoma protein (pRb), was further down-regulated under exposure to lovastatin in condition of BRCA1 overexpression, but the expression of p21WAF1/CIP1, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI), was further up-regulated, both in vitro and in vivo detected with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. Moreover, we found the further reduced volume of tumoral xenografts treated with lovastatin in the presence of BRCA1 overexpression. Our results suggest that BRCA1 overexpression sensitizes cancer cells to lovastatin via regulation of cyclin D1-CDK4-p21WAF1/CIP1 pathway, which will provide an innovative experimental framework to study control of breast cancer cell proliferation.",

We assessed the risk of hospitalization with dementia associated with use of statins in a population-based case-control study in 4 Northern Danish counties in the period 1991 to 2005. We identified 11,039 cases with dementia and 110,340 age- matched and sex-matched population controls using data from the National Patient Registry, the Danish Psychiatric Central Register, and the Civil Registration System. Prescriptions for statins filled before the admission for dementia were identified using population-based prescription databases. We used conditional logistic regression analysis to compute relative risk of hospitalization with dementia associated with use of statins using nonusers as reference group. We found an overall reduced risk of hospitalization with dementia among statin users (adjusted odds ratio: 0.67, 95% confidence intervals: 0.60-0.75). The reduced risk associated with statin use remained robust in various subanalyses, however, we found no clear dose-response pattern between the number of filled prescriptions for statin and the risk of hospitalization with dementia. In conclusion, we found a reduced risk of hospitalization with dementia among users of statins, however, whether this association is causal remains to be clarified.",

LDL-C values were available for 78% evaluable patients; 71% of the patients with dyslipidema were undergoing treatment with statins; 34% patients undergoing treatment had target LDL-C values. At regression analysis, non-availability of LDL-C values was predicted by absence of diabetes, presence of normotension, and advancing age; lack of statins treatment by female sex, diabetes, overweight and northern location (southern location predicted treatment); non-achievement of target LDL-C values by age, diabetes, attending a diabetic clinic, cigarette smoking, history of cardiovascular disease, and taking less than six pills per day.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether hypercholesterolemia is associated with glycocalyx perturbation in humans, and if so, whether statin treatment can restore this. We measured systemic glycocalyx volume (V(G)) in 13 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) after cessation of lipid-lowering therapy for a minimum of 4 weeks and 8 weeks after initiating rosuvastatin therapy. Normocholesterolemic subjects were used as controls. V(G) was estimated by subtracting the intravascular distribution volume of a glycocalyx permeable tracer (dextran 40) from that of a glycocalyx impermeable tracer (labeled erythrocytes). V(G) in untreated FH patients [LDL 225 +/- 57 mg/dl (mean +/- SD)] was significantly reduced compared with controls (LDL 93 +/- 24 mg/dl) (V(G) 0.8 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.7 +/- 0.6, respectively, P < 0.001). After normalization of LDL levels (95 +/- 33 mg/dl) upon 8 weeks of statin treatment, V(G) recovered only partially (V(G) 1.1 +/- 0.4 L, P = 0.04). The endothelial glycocalyx is profoundly reduced in FH patients, which may contribute to increased atherogenic vulnerability.

In fact, genetic studies of the risk of AD have reported association with polymorphism in some cholesterol related genes like the allele epsilon4 of the apolipoprotein E, cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1), ATP-binding cassette transporter a1 (ABCA1) and the lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP). Moreover a recent publication shows a downregulation of Seladin-1 (which catalyze the last step of cholesterol biosynthesis) in affected neurons in Alzheimer's Disease. Post-mortem analysis of AD brains reveal a loss in cholesterol content and this make the therapeutical use of statin-like drugs quite a lot controversial. Taking together their clinical trials results and the large body of literature regarding lipid profile alterations in AD, it is actually unclear how much these agents can be helpful or not for affected patients.", 
    "157": "Statins have been reported to reduce the risk and be of benefit in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Individuals enrolling in the randomized controlled trial testing two anti-inflammatory agents for primary prevention of AD (Alzheimer's Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention Trial; ADAPT) were allowed the elective use of statins. Our objective was to assess whether statin use is associated with reduced risk of incident AD among ADAPT participants. In primary ADAPT study , participants were assessed annually for cholesterol levels and cognitive status. If impairment in cognition was noted, a dementia evaluation was performed. Onset of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD was taken as the date of this evaluation. Time-to-onset was analyzed in six-month intervals following enrollment. Without knowledge of primary treatment assignment in ADAPT, participants were grouped by their self-reported use of lipid-lowering agents (LLA). In the current ancillary ADAPT study we found that elective statin use was associated with significantly reduced risk of incident AD after adjustment for age, gender, education and Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype. The findings were similar when comparing all LLA use (statin and non-statin LLA) to non-LLA use. Cholesterol levels were lower among statin users compared with non-LLA users, but the MMSE scores were equivalent. The data suggest that statin therapy may be of benefit in reducing the risk of AD.", 
    "158": "Amnesia is a common sequela following traumatic brain injury (TBI), for which there is no current treatment. Pleiotropic effects of statins have demonstrated faster recovery of spatial memory after TBI in animals. We conducted a double-blind randomized clinical trial add-on of patients with TBI (16-50 years of age), with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores of 9-13, and intracranial lesions as demonstrated by computed tomography (CT) scan. We excluded those patients with recent head injury or severe disability; administration of known drugs as modifiers of statin metabolism; multisystemic trauma; prior use of mannitol, barbiturate, corticosteroids, indomethacin or calcium antagonists; surgical or isolated lesion in brainstem; allergy to statins; previous hepatopathy or myopathy; previous management in another clinic; or pregnancy. Each patient received the same treatment and was randomly allocated to receive either rosuvastatin (RVS) or placebo over a period of 10 days. The primary outcome measures assessed were amnesia and disorientation times using Galveston Orientation Amnesia Test. Additionally, we evaluated plasma levels of interleukin (IL) 1beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, and IL-6, as well as disability at 3 months. We analyzed eight patients with RVS and 13 controls with similar basal characteristics. Using Cox regression analysis, administration of RVS showed a reduction of amnesia time with a hazard ratio of 53.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.58-1824.64). This was adjusted for early intubation, basal leukocytes, basal Marshall and Fisher score, change of IL-1beta levels, and lesion side. IL-6 values at day 3 were increased in the RVS group (p = 0.04). No difference was detected in disability at 3 months. While statins may reduce amnesia time after TBI, possibly by immunomodulation, further trials are needed in order to confirm this positive association.", 
    "159": "Despite the favorable effects of reduction of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in decreasing the risk of coronary heart disease, many patients treated with lipid-lowering HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) do not achieve goal LDL-C levels. This may be due to high doses of statins prescribed that could potentially induce adverse effects and compromise patient safety and compliance with considerable expense in the long-term. We compared the actions of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin, administered at the low dosages of 10 and 20 mg/day, respectively, in reducing plasma LDL-C levels and their effects on other components of the atherogenic lipid profile in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "160": "In this randomized, parallel group, open-label clinical study, 106 patients with LDL-C >200 mg/dL were treated with rosuvastatin 10 mg/day (group A; n = 52), or atorvastatin 20 mg/day (group B; n = 54) for 48 weeks.", 
    "161": "At 48 weeks, rosuvastatin 10 mg/day was associated with a significantly greater reduction in plasma LDL-C levels compared with atorvastatin 20 mg/day (-44.32% vs -30%; p < 0.005). Compared with atorvastatin, rosuvastatin also produced a greater reduction in plasma total cholesterol, triglycerides, and non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C) levels (p < 0.005). Plasma HDL-C levels were not affected significantly, independent of the drug used.", 
    "162": "In high-risk patients with primary hypercholesterolemia, rosuvastatin 10 mg/day was more efficacious than atorvastatin 20 mg/day in reducing plasma LDL-C levels, enabling goal LDL-C levels to be achieved and improving other lipid parameters. Both treatments were well tolerated over 48 weeks.", 
    "163": "Low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering is the mainstay of the current treatment guidelines in the management of cardiovascular risk. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are currently the most effective LDL-C-lowering drugs. However, a substantial number of patients do not reach treatment targets with statins. Therefore, an unmet medical need exists for lipid-lowering drugs with novel mechanisms of action to reach the recommended cholesterol target levels, either by monotherapy or combination therapy. Upregulation of the LDL receptor with squalene synthase inhibitors has shown promising results in animal studies but the clinical development of the lead compound lapaquistat (TAK-475) has recently been discontinued. Ezetimibe combined with statins allowed significantly more patients to reach their LDL-C targets. Other inhibitors of intestinal cholesterol absorption such as disodium ascorbyl phytostanol phosphate (FM-VP4) and bile acid transport inhibitors have shown positive results in early development trials, whereas the prospect of acyl coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase inhibition in cardiovascular prevention is dire. Selective inhibition of messenger RNA (mRNA) by antisense oligonucleotides is a new approach to modify cholesterol levels. The inhibition of apolipoprotein B mRNA is in advanced development and mipomersen sodium (ISIS 301012) has shown striking results in phase II studies both as monotherapy as well as in combination with statins.", 
    "164": "In vitro covalent binding assessments of drugs have been useful in providing retrospective insights into the association between drug metabolism and a resulting toxicological response. On the basis of these studies, it has been advocated that in vitro covalent binding to liver microsomal proteins in the presence and the absence of NADPH be used routinely to screen drug candidates. However, the utility of this approach in predicting toxicities of drug candidates accurately remains an unanswered question. Importantly, the years of research that have been invested in understanding metabolic bioactivation and covalent binding and its potential role in toxicity have focused only on those compounds that demonstrate toxicity. Investigations have not frequently queried whether in vitro covalent binding could be observed with drugs with good safety records. Eighteen drugs (nine hepatotoxins and nine nonhepatotoxins in humans) were assessed for in vitro covalent binding in NADPH-supplemented human liver microsomes. Of the two sets of nine drugs, seven in each set were shown to undergo some degree of covalent binding. Among hepatotoxic drugs, acetaminophen, carbamazepine, diclofenac, indomethacin, nefazodone, sudoxicam, and tienilic acid demonstrated covalent binding, while benoxaprofen and felbamate did not. Of the nonhepatotoxic drugs evaluated, buspirone, diphenhydramine, meloxicam, paroxetine, propranolol, raloxifene, and simvastatin demonstrated covalent binding, while ibuprofen and theophylline did not. A quantitative comparison of covalent binding in vitro intrinsic clearance did not separate the two groups of compounds, and in fact, paroxetine, a nonhepatotoxin, showed the greatest amount of covalent binding in microsomes. Including factors such as the fraction of total metabolism comprised by covalent binding and the total daily dose of each drug improved the discrimination between hepatotoxic and nontoxic drugs based on in vitro covalent binding data; however, the approach still would falsely identify some agents as potentially hepatotoxic.", 
    "165": "Purpose of this study was to compare the correlation of statin use with long-term mortality in patients with abdominal (AAA) and thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA).", 
    "166": "We compared long-term survival of 731 AAA and 59 TAA patients undergoing elective endovascular repair (EVAR). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared by the log-rank method. Propensity score-adjusted multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine independent associations of statin use on vital status after EVAR.", 
    "167": "Statin use was associated with decreased long-term mortality in AAA patients in bivariate and multivariable regression analysis, in which the effect of propensity to receive a statin was considered (adjusted HR: .613, 95%-CI: .379- .993, p = .047) whereas mortality of TAA patients was not associated with use of statins (adjusted HR: 1.795, 95%-CI: .147 -21.942, p = .647).", 
    "168": "Use of statins is an independent predictor of decreased mortality after elective EVAR in AAA, but not in TAA patients. These findings indirectly support the concept of a distinct pathogenesis of AAA and TAA.",

    "170": "PubMed (1987 to September 2007) and the FDA-AER database (as of June 2007) were searched for reports of ILD in which a statin was listed as a causative suspect.", 
    "171": "Two authors (one author for Pub Med cases and one for FDA-AER cases) independently abstracted patient data. Given the paucity of information, all case reports and case series in English and French were included. All adverse event reports from the FDA-AER database in which a statin was listed as causative suspect were included.", 
    "172": "The literature search using PubMed yielded eight articles describing a total of 14 case reports of ILD in association with statin use. The FDA-AER system database contained 162 cases of reported statin-induced ILD as of June 2007. For every 10,000 reports of a statin-associated adverse event, approximately 1 to 40 reports were for ILD.", 
    "173": "Statin-induced ILD is a possible newly recognized side effect of statin therapy. The mechanism of lung injury is not defined. The current review provides novel information from the FDA-AER that supports a possible, although unusual, pulmonary class effect of statins.", 
    "174": "Simvastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, is a cholesterol-lowering drug that may play a role in bone metabolism through a mechanism that is not fully understood. Recently, receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL), a member of the TNF superfamily, has emerged as a major mediator of bone loss via activation of osteoclastogenesis. The latter is also associated with certain cancers such as multiple myeloma and breast cancer. Whether simvastatin can modulate RANKL-induced or cancer induced osteoclastogenesis was investigated. The effect of simvastatin on RANKL signaling and consequent osteoclastogenesis was investigated. RANKL induced NF-kappaB activation, whereas pretreatment with simvastatin completely suppressed such activation and correlated with suppression of RANKL-induced activation of IkappaBalpha kinase, IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and IkappaBalpha degradation. Similarly, RANKL induced the differentiation of monocytic cells to osteoclasts, whereas simvastatin suppressed it. The inhibition was maximal when cells were exposed to both simvastatin and RANKL simultaneously and minimal when simvastatin was added 1 day after RANKL treatment. Simvastatin also inhibited the osteoclastogenesis induced by human breast cancer and by multiple myeloma cells. Together, our results indicate that simvastatin inhibits the RANKL-induced NF-kappaB activation pathway that leads to suppression of osteoclastogenesis induced by RANKL and by tumor cells, thereby suggesting its therapeutic potential in osteoporosis and in cancer-related bone loss.", 
    "175": "Meningiomas are the second most common type of brain and CNS tumors by histology. Surgery and radiotherapy are main treatment options, but meningiomas may be impossible to adequately resect or may regrow after surgery. In spite of many experimental attempts, there is no generally accepted chemotherapeutic approach. We have studied in a series of meningiomas the expression of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which apart from its major role as a key factor of the innate immune system, is believed to play a role in tumorigenesis. All meningiomas studied expressed TLR4 mRNA and protein at variable degree. Paclitaxel, a ligand of TLR4, exhibited a dose- and time-dependent growth suppression in both monolayer and spheroid meningioma cell cultures. The knockdown of TLR4 with siRNA in meningioma cell cultures abrogated the inhibitory effect of paclitaxel. The suppressive action of paclitaxel on meningioma cell growth was enhanced in the presence of fluvastatin or the mitogen-actvated protein kinase (ERK1/2) inhibitor PD98059. At least part of the growth suppressive effect was mediated by the induction of apoptosis in meningioma cells by paclitaxel alone or in combination with fluvastatin. In conclusion, our in vitro results suggest that paclitaxel alone or in combination with other inhibitors of cell growth (statins, MAPK inhibitors) could provide a potential tool for the treatment of TLR4 expressing meningiomas.", 
    "176": "Statins inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of 3-HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis. These drugs are currently used for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and brain stroke. Recently it has been indicated that statins have cytostatic and cytotoxic properties on several type of cancer cell lines. Inhibition of the synthesis of isoprenoid intermediates of the mevalonate pathway has been thought to be an important mechanism whereby statins exert proapoptotic, antiangiogenic, and antimetastatic action on human tumor cells. This review describes the anticancer activity of statins on the basis of numerous in vitro and in vivo experiments and focuses on their clinical applications.", 
    "177": "Fatty acid (FA) composition in serum has been associated with C-reactive protein (CRP), but associations with other markers of inflammation and endothelial function, e.g. adhesion molecules are unknown. We recently suggested a possible role of the lipogenic enzyme stearoyl coenzymeA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) in inflammation. This study investigates the associations between serum FA composition, including SCD-1 index, and various inflammatory and endothelial function markers.", 
    "178": "264 Swedish men and women aged 70 years participated in this cross-sectional population-based study. FA composition was measured in serum cholesteryl esters and was correlated to inflammatory markers (CRP, interleukin [IL]-2, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, vascular cellular adhesion molecule [VCAM]-1, intercellular adhesion molecule [ICAM]-1, E-selectin, P-selectin, L-selectin, interferon-gamma, and monocyte chemoattractant protein [MCP]-1), using linear regression analysis. SCD-1 activity was estimated by FA product-to-precursor ratio (16:1/16:0).", 
    "179": "Serum FA composition was significantly associated with CRP and E-selectin but not with other inflammatory markers. After adjusting for BMI, smoking, physical activity, alcohol consumption and lipid-lowering therapy, the proportion of palmitoleic acid and SCD-1 index were positively correlated with CRP concentrations (P=0.003 and P=0.001, respectively).", 
    "180": "A FA composition reflecting high intake of saturated fat and a high SCD-1 index is independently related to CRP concentrations, but not to other markers of inflammation and endothelial function in this population of elderly men and women. Given the absent association between FA composition and the other markers, CRP may be the preferable marker to use when investigating potential relationships between FAs and low-grade inflammation.", 
    "181": "Elderly individuals are at increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and account for a majority of CHD deaths. Several clinical trials have assessed the beneficial effects of statins in individuals with, or at risk of developing, CHD. These trials provide evidence that statins reduce risk and improve clinical outcomes even in older patients; however, statin therapy remains under-utilized among the aged. Atorvastatin has been widely investigated among the older subjects and has the greatest magnitude of favorable effects on clinical outcomes of CHD. The pharmacokinetic properties of atorvastatin allow it to be used every other day, a factor which may decrease adverse events and be especially important in the elderly. The purpose of this article is to review the evidence available from randomized clinical trials regarding the safety and efficacy of atorvastatin in primary and secondary prevention of CHD and stroke in older patients and to discuss issues such as drug interactions, patient compliance and cost-effectiveness, which affect prescription of lipid-lowering therapy among older patients."
