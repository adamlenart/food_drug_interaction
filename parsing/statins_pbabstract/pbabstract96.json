    "0": "Despite the exceedingly high cardiovascular risk in hemodialysis patients, it is uncertain whether statin regimens lead to clinical benefit in this population. KDIGO (Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines summarize the evidence, stating that initiation of statin treatment is not recommended for most prevalent hemodialysis patients. Since the 4D and AURORA trials did not cover all age and risk ranges, an individualized treatment approach is accepted. Thus, patients and physicians may reasonably choose statin treatment if they are interested in an apparent, but relatively small, uncertain reduction in cardiovascular events. Since very high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol might increase the likelihood of benefit from statins in a dialysis patient, patients who meet this criterion may be more inclined to receive a statin. Other factors that might influence a patient's decision to receive statins could include more severe comorbidity or higher current pill burden-both favoring non-treatment--and recent myocardial infarction or greater life expectancy-both favoring treatment. The latter may be especially true for dialysis patients in Japan.", 
    "1": "Lipoprotein glomerulopathy (LPG), a rare renal disease, is mainly reported in Japan and China. Chinese cases of LPG showed similar clinical and pathological features as reports from other countries. Three types of APOE mutation have been detected in those patients: APOE Maebashi (142Arg-144Leu-0) and APOE Kyoto (Arg25-Cys) were initially reported, and APOE Guangzhou (Arg150-Pro) is a novel mutation in Chinese patients with LPG. Asymptomatic carriers of all three mutations exist in families, but serum lipid and apolipoprotein E (apoE) levels are markedly elevated. In most of Chinese patients with LPG, long-term treatment with statins or bezafibrates appears to decrease proteinuria. LPG provides a disease model by which to explore pathogenic roles of apoE in common diseases.", 
    "2": "The presence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Type 1 diabetes largely impairs life expectancy. Hyperglycemia leading to an increase in oxidative stress is considered to be the key pathophysiological factor of both micro- and macrovascular complications. In Type 1 diabetes, the presence of coronary calcifications is also related to coronary artery disease. Cardiac autonomic neuropathy, which significantly impairs myocardial function and blood flow, also enhances cardiac abnormalities. Also hypoglycemic episodes are considered to adversely influence cardiac performance. Intensive insulin therapy has been demonstrated to reduce the occurrence and progression of both micro- and macrovascular complications. This has been evidenced by the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) / Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study. The concept of a metabolic memory emerged based on the results of the study, which established that intensified insulin therapy is the standard of treatment of Type 1 diabetes. Future therapies may also include glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-based treatment therapies. Pilot studies with GLP-1-analogues have been shown to reduce insulin requirements.",

    "7": "Epidemiological evidence suggests that chronic treatment with simvastatin may protect against the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but as yet it is unclear how this effect is mediated. Extensive data also indicates that the amyloid \u03b2-protein (A\u03b2) plays a central role in the disease process, and it has been suggested that the protective effects of simvastatin may be mediated by reducing A\u03b2 production or by counteracting the toxic effects of A\u03b2. Accordingly, using the A\u03b2PPswe/PS1dE9 mouse model of AD, we investigated the effects of simvastatin on long-term potentiation (LTP), amyloid biology, and two key kinases involved in A\u03b2-mediated toxicity. Since burgeoning data indicate that both fibrillar and non-fibrillar forms of A\u03b2 play a prominent role in AD pathogenesis, we were careful to investigate the effects of simvastatin on three biochemically distinct pools of A\u03b2. In untreated A\u03b2PPswe/PS1dE9 mice, there was a dramatic and significant increase in the levels of water-soluble A\u03b2 between 6 and 8 months, but this remained constant between 8 and 18 months. In contrast, the concentrations of detergent-soluble and formic acid (FA)-soluble A\u03b2 species increased across all ages examined, thus demonstrating that while amyloid deposition continued, the levels of water-soluble A\u03b2 remained relatively constant. LTP was normal at 6 months, but was significantly impaired at 8 and 18 months. Importantly, a diet supplemented with 0.04% simvastatin for one month (at 7 months) positively affected synaptic plasticity in A\u03b2PPswe/PS1dE9 mice and did not significantly alter levels of water-soluble, detergent-soluble, or FA-soluble A\u03b2, but did increase phosphorylation of both Akt and GSK-3, while tau and tau phosphorylation were unaltered. These results indicate that the protective effects of simvastatin may be mediated by maintaining signaling pathways that help to protect and rescue LTP.", 
    "8": "Atorvastatin, a hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor, and endothelin-1 (ET-1) receptor antagonist have been separately indicated to ameliorate disease progression in atherosclerosis. However, no study has evaluated the effect of their combination on atherosclerosis. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the direct in vivo effects of a combination regimen of atorvastatin and ET-1 receptor antagonist on male New Zealand white rabbit models of atherosclerosis (injury-induced). Thirty-two atherosclerotic rabbits were divided into four experimental groups: (a) injury group - fed high-fat diet; (b) ET-1 receptor antagonist preventive group - fed high-fat diet, but with intragastric administration of the ET-1 receptor antagonist, darusentan; (c) combined preventive group - fed high-fat diet, but with intragastric administration of both darusentan and atorvastatin; and (d) treatment group - fed high-fat diet for the first 8 weeks, followed by normal diet and intragastric administration of both darusentan and atorvastatin up to 16 weeks. A further eight non-atherosclerotic rabbits were fed normal diet and classified as the control group. At the end of 8 and 16 weeks, compared with the injury group, the combined preventive group had significant reduction in both the concentration of serum lipids and inflammatory factors and atherosclerosis formation, indicative of a multifaceted anti-atherosclerotic impact. The relative area of atherosclerotic lesions in the injury group (30.84%) was significantly higher than the control group (4.62%; p < 0.05). The combined preventive group showed a significantly robust effect on lowering serum lipid, inflammatory cytokines, and maintained homeostatic balance of free radicals, and important downstream effectors like ET-1 and matrixmetalloproteinase-9. Our data show that atorvastatin and ET-1 receptor antagonist co-administration may decrease lipid levels, stabilize plaques and relieve vascular inflammation. By reducing the plaque burden, this regimen may minimize the risk of atherosclerotic plaque rupture or arterial occlusion.",

    "10": "Lipid metabolism can be disturbed in different ways, leading to changes in plasma lipoprotein function and/\u200aor levels. This by itself and through interaction with other vascular risk factors and endothelial dysfunction may affect the development of atherosclerosis and other vascular diseases. Therefore, dyslipidaemias cover a broad spectrum of lipid abnormalities, some of which are of great importance in organovascular prevention. Dyslipidaemias may be related to other diseases (secondary dyslipidaemias) or to the interaction between genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Dyslipidaemias may also have a different meaning in certain subgroups of patients which may relate to genetic predisposition and/\u200aor co\u200amorbidities. This requires particular attention complementary to the management of the total CV risk. Optimal LDLcholesterol levels are the primary strateging task in the therapeutical preventive approaches. However, at present increasing attention has focused on the role of inflamation, levels of HDLcholesterol and triglycerides in the process of atherosclerosis. Statins represent basic pillar in dyslipidemia treatment. Despite the intensive management of all conventional vascular risk factors and the intensified treatment with statins, residual organovascular risk remains high. Therefore the interest is focused on finding the place of combined antidyslipidemic treatment and the development of new antidyslipidemics.",

Severity of CAD was measured using modified Gensini stenosis score (GSS) and classified as a vessel disease score (VDS) of 0-3. The presence of CAD was defined as diameter stenosis>50%. Subjects were grouped in tertile by level of baPWV (<14, 14-17,\u2009 >17 m/s). Subjects with CAD showed higher mean age, prevalence of men and diabetes, and systolic blood pressure. The prevalence of hypertension, use of antihypertensive medications and use of statin was not different. Subjects with CAD had higher baPWV than subjects without CAD (16.70 \u00b1 3.46 versus 15.21 \u00b1 3.19 m/s, p<0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis showed significant correlation of baPWV and modified GSS (p=0.0337). ANCOVA adjusted with age, gender, body mass index, presence of hypertension or diabetes, status of smoking, use of antihypertensive medications and risk of hypercholesterolemia showed a statistically significant association of baPWV with VDS (p<0.0001). Highest tertile of baPWV had a statistically significant effect on the severity of CAD from an ANCOVA model. The predictive power of highest tertile of baPWV for the presence of CAD was 3.600 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.884-6.881, p<0.0001]. It is concluded that increased baPWV is a reliable predictor of the presence and severity of CAD, suggesting that baPWV>17 m/s may be a threshold value for the presence and severity of CAD.", 
    "13": "PCSK9 proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type (PCSK9) protein plays an important role in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) metabolism, due to its role in the degradation of the LDL receptor. Preliminary clinical data of PCSK9 inhibition are quite promising and indicate that PCSK9 inhibition may be a novel strategy for the treatment of dyslipidemia particularly for those with refractory hypercholesterolemia, statin intolerance, or an elevated lipoprotein (a) level and associated cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, development of PCSK9 inhibitor is an excellent example of \"bench to bedside\" concept where discovery of a genetic mutation was translated into a novel therapy to address unmet clinical needs. Although several approaches have been attempted to inhibit PCSK9 activity including small molecules, gene silencing and inhibitory antibodies, the most promising approach appears to be the use of monoclonal antibodies with a 50 -70% LDL cholesterol reduction on top of maximal doses of statins. In this article, we review the pharmacology of PCSK9 and summarize findings from key clinical studies using PCSK9 inhibitors.", 
    "14": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae ergosterol biosynthesis, like cholesterol biosynthesis in mammals, is regulated at the transcriptional level by a sterol feedback mechanism. Yeast studies defined a 7-bp consensus sterol-response element (SRE) common to genes involved in sterol biosynthesis and two transcription factors, Upc2 and Ecm22, which direct transcription of sterol biosynthetic genes. The 7-bp consensus SRE is identical to the anaerobic response element, AR1c. Data indicate that Upc2 and Ecm22 function through binding to this SRE site. We now show that it is two novel anaerobic AR1b elements in the UPC2 promoter that direct global ERG gene expression in response to a block in de novo ergosterol biosynthesis, brought about by antifungal drug treatment. The AR1b elements are absolutely required for auto-induction of UPC2 gene expression and protein and require Upc2 and Ecm22 for function. We further demonstrate the direct binding of recombinant expressed S. cerevisiae ScUpc2 and pathogenic Candida albicans CaUpc2 and Candida glabrata CgUpc2 to AR1b and SRE/AR1c elements. Recombinant endogenous promoter studies show that the UPC2 anaerobic AR1b elements act in trans to regulate ergosterol gene expression. Our results indicate that Upc2 must occupy UPC2 AR1b elements in order for ERG gene expression induction to take place. Thus, the two UPC2-AR1b elements drive expression of all ERG genes necessary for maintaining normal antifungal susceptibility, as wild type cells lacking these elements have increased susceptibility to azole antifungal drugs. Therefore, targeting these specific sites for antifungal therapy represents a novel approach to treat systemic fungal infections.", 
    "15": "Atherosclerotic cerebral infarction (ACI) is characterized by extremely high fatality and disability rate. Recent studies indicate that co-stimulatory signal of tumor necrosis factor superfamily OX40/OX40L contributes to the atherosclerosis effect in ACI patients. However, it remains unclear the mechanism underlying the anti-atherosclerosis process. So this study aims to investigate the effects of rosuvastatin on the expression of OX40L, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors gamma (PPAR-\u03b3) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), and human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Different concentration of rosuvastatin and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OX-LDL) co-intervene HUVEC to observe the expression of OX40L and PPAR-\u03b3 using real-time quantitative RT-PCR (Q-RTPCR) and Western-blot. Furthermore, we examined the level changes of plasmic sOX40L and hs-CRP in acute atherosclerotic cerebral infarction patients. The results demonstrated that concentration-dependent and time-dependent OX-LDL remarkably stimulate the expression of OX40L and inhibit the expression of PPAR-\u03b3 in vitro. But concentration-dependent rosuvastatin can reverse the impact of OX-LDL, suggesting that rosuvastatin can prevent the expression of OX40L, and the process may be associated with mevalonate pathway. In vivo, acute atherosclerotic cerebral infarction patients taking 20 mg rosuvastatin exhibited significantly reduced expression of OX40L in peripheral blood lymphocyte, sOX40L in blood plasma, and hs-CRP compared with before treatment. Our studies identified rosuvastatin as an effective medicine in controlling atherosclerosis process in ACI by inhibiting OX40L and stimulating PPAR-\u03b3 expression.", 
    "16": "Elevated plasma levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) are prevalent in patients with hypercholesterolemia and coronary artery disease. A total of 83 patients with hypercholesterolemia and angiographically documented mild coronary artery stenosis were randomized to rosuvastatin treatment (20 mg) or atorvastatin treatment (40 mg) once daily for 6 weeks after a 4-week dietary lead-in phase. Both statins decreased total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglyceride levels effectively. Only rosuvastatin increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. Both rosuvastatin and atorvastatin decreased plasma ADMA levels; rosuvastatin had a significantly greater effect. The reduction in ADMA levels were correlated with the reduction in TC and LDL-C levels as well as LDL-C-HDL-C ratio. Treatment with rosuvastatin or atorvastatin in patients with hyperlipidemia with mild coronary artery stenosis may lead to a decrease in ADMA levels, which may contribute to improved endothelial function.",

Lipoprotein subfraction evaluation can provide additional information regarding atherogenicity in these individuals. Patients (n = 40) with hypercholesterolemia (29 females, mean age 63 years), without previous hypolipemic treatment, were treated with atorvastatin 40 mg/d for 3 months. Atorvastatin significantly reduced total cholesterol (6.7 \u00b1 1.0 vs 4.6 \u00b1 1.3 mmol/L, P < .001), LDL-C (4.3 \u00b1 1.0 vs 2.6 \u00b1 0.9 mmol/L, P < .001), triglycerides (1.8 \u00b1 0.9 vs 1.5 \u00b1 1.00 mmol/L, P < .05), small-dense LDL (sdLDL) fraction 3 to 7 (0.22 \u00b1 0.37 vs 0.09 \u00b1 0.16 mmol/L, P < .001), and apolipoprotein B (apoB; 1.0 \u00b1 0.2 vs 0.74 \u00b1 0.2 g/L, P < .001). There was a negative correlation of atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) with buoyant LDL-1 and LDL-2 (r = -.35; P < .05) and positive with sdLDL-3 to sdLDL-7 (r = .52, P < .001). Administration of atorvastatin 40 mg/d in patients with hypercholesterolemia caused a shift in sdLDL subfractions to large, buoyant subfractions. The AIP better correlated with sdLDL than apoB levels.", 
    "18": "Although a reduction in the high-frequency (HF) component of heart rate variability (HRV) is a major complication of diabetes and a risk factor for sudden death, its relationship to ventricular tachycardia (VT) is unknown. We developed a mouse model for the study of VT and its relationship to changes in HRV in the Akita type 1 diabetic mouse. Programmed ventricular stimulation of anesthetized mice demonstrated that Akita mice were more inducible for VT compared with wild-type mice: 78.6% versus 28.6% (P = 0.007). Optical mapping of perfused hearts demonstrated multifocal breakthroughs that occasionally gave rise to short-lived rotors consistent with focal initiation and maintenance of VT. Treatment of Akita mice with pravastatin, which had been previously shown clinically to decrease ventricular ectopy and to increase HRV, decreased the inducibility of VT: 36.8% compared with 75.0% with placebo treatment (P = 0.022). The HF fraction of HRV was reduced in Akita mice (48.6 \u00b1 5.2% vs. 70.9 \u00b1 4.8% in wild-type mice, P = 0.005) and was increased compared with placebo treatment in pravastatin-treated mice. Pretreatment of Akita mice with the muscarinic agonist carbamylcholine or the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blocker propranolol decreased the inducibility of VT (P = 0.001). In conclusion, the increased inducibility of focally initiated VT and reduced HF fraction in Akita mice were partially reversed by both pravastatin treatment and pharmacologic reversal of parasympathetic dysfunction. In this new animal model for the study of the pathogenesis of VT in type 1 diabetes, pravastatin may play a role in the prevention of VT by attenuating parasympathetic dysfunction.",

RVHT patients had higher systolic blood pressure, E/e' ratio, and greater prevalence of concentric hypertrophy but lower estimated glomerular-filtration-rate (eGFR) compared with EHT patients. Increased prevalence of LV diastolic dysfunction remained statistically significant in patients with RVHT after multivariable adjustment for age, sex, blood pressure, eGFR, diabetes, smoking, and statin use, with a relative risk (95% CI) for abnormal E/e' of 1.70 (95% confidence interval = 1.05-2.90; P = 0.03) compared with EHT. RVHT patients with severe renal dysfunction showed greater impairments in cardiac systolic and diastolic function compared with those in EHT patients or preserved renal function RVHT patients.", 
    "22": "Among hypertensive patients undergoing echocardiography, cardiac structure and diastolic function are impaired in RVHT patients compared with EHT patients and remain different after adjustment for multiple significant covariables. When associated with significant renal dysfunction, RVHT aggravates LV hypertrophy and both systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Hence, identification of RVHT and renal dysfunction warrants development of targeted management strategies.",

These disease burden proxies combine differences in prevalence, age, morbidity, and mortality. Variations were disaggregated by patients being first dispensed medicines ('access') versus subsequent dispensings ('persistence').", 
    "25": "Initially, overall age-adjusted incidence of 'scripts' (prescriptions dispensed) to Maori was similar to that of non-Maori. There were differences in therapeutic coverage between Maori and Pasifika, for example greater use of asthma medicines in Maori. However, further adjustments linking with disease burden showed marked variance for a number of diseases. Differences in dispensing included areas of high health need such as heart disease, infections, diabetes, mental health and respiratory disease. Maori had 19-37% lower dispensings overall than non-Maori, with a net difference of nearly 1 million scripts. Maori were both less likely to access medicines, and then after first dispensing had fewer subsequent scripts. Patterns for Pasifika appeared similar, although needs-adjusted analysis is awaited for this population.", 
    "26": "Once adjusting for need, there was variable but sizeable differences in medicines dispensed to Maori compared with non-Maori, and likely differences for Pasifika populations. There are however important limitations to this preliminary analysis. Crude and age-standardised metrics may be poor predictors of needs-adjusted gaps in medicines use. In this analysis, solely age-standardised rates tended to underestimate differences once adjusting for burden of disease; future analyses of prescribing patterns should consider better adjusting for disease burden.",

The therapeutic targeting of LSCs is challenging because LSCs are highly similar to normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and are protected by stromal cells in vivo. We screened 14,718 compounds in a leukemia-stroma co-culture system for inhibition of cobblestone formation, a cellular behavior associated with stem-cell function. Among those compounds that inhibited malignant cells but spared HSPCs was the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin. Lovastatin showed anti-LSC activity in vitro and in an in vivo bone marrow transplantation model. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the effect was on target, via inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase.

Forty-two male Wistar rats were exposed either against saline as a control group or PQ (3.5mg/kg, i.p.) as test groups. The test groups were nominated as PQ (PQ-exposed non-treated animals), pioglitazone (PGT, 10mg/kg, orally), atorvastatin (STN, 10mg/kg, orally), PGT+STN, PGT+GW9662 (1mg/kg, i.p.) and STN+GW9662 (1mg/kg). Atorvastatin but not PGT was able to reverse significantly (P<0.05) the PQ-increased ratio of lung to body weight. STN was successfully able to recover the PQ-reduced antioxidant potency and the GW9662 administration resulted in antagonizing the protective effect of both PGT and STN. Although both PGT and STN were able to reduce the hydrxoproline content of the lungs, GW9662, however, could reverse only STN-related effect. Histochemical studies revealed that PQ exposure resulted in a remarkable increase of fibroblasts and collagen fibers in the interstitial tissue and around vessels and bronchioles, which was improved by the STN administration. Only STN-received animals showed the down-regulation of the TGF-\u03b21 expression and GW9662 was able to antagonize this down-regulation. Co-administration of PGT and STN could not exert any synergistic protective effect. These data suggest that the PQ-induced pulmonary fibrosis could be more effectively reversed by STN rather than PGT. Moreover, STN-induced protective effects might attribute to the regulation of TGF-\u03b21 expression, which is antagonized by PPAR\u03b3 antagonist, suggesting that STN may improve the PQ-induced damages via PPAR\u03b3.",

Data on 592 patients aged \u226450 years who underwent CABG from 9 European institutions were collected retrospectively. Twenty-eight percent of patients received at least 2 arterial grafts. Clopidogrel was used at discharge in 16.2% and statins in 67.2% of patients. Freedom from major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events at 1, 3, and 5 years was 93.8%, 90.1%, and 85.0%; survival rate was 98.3%, 96.3%, and 94.9%; freedom from myocardial infarction was 96.3%, 95.1%, and 92.5%; and freedom from repeat revascularization was 96.3%, 95.1%, and 92.5%, respectively.

Since then, medical management of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (CAS) has progressed to include broader use of statins. Our purpose was to review the effect of contemporary medical management on stroke prevention. A retrospective review of the Kaiser Permanente, Southern California medical group database was performed. All patients with a diagnosis of asymptomatic CAS by International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes from 2007 to 2011 were identified. Intervention for stroke prevention was the criteria for exclusion. Medications used were evaluated as was the rate of stroke. Asymptomatic CAS was noted in 7255 patients. Of these, 158 (2.2%) sustained a stroke within a mean follow-up of 37 months. Patients who were taking a statin had a statistically significant lower risk of stroke (1.6 vs 3.9%). The data support that contemporary medical management of asymptomatic CAS has decreased the incidence of stroke in comparison to previously published data. The use of statins was protective against the development of stroke. Future prospective randomized trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of carotid intervention versus current medical management.",

Biological and genetic research has led to the identification of several genes and proteins that may be pharmacologically targeted to improve lipoprotein profiles and possibly cardiovascular outcomes in patients with dyslipidemia. The observation that proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) regulates the levels of circulating low-density lipoprotein C (LDL-C) by enhancing the degradation of the hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) prompted the search for drugs that inhibit PCSK9 activity. Several approaches to inhibiting PCSK9 activity have been proposed; these involve inhibitory antibodies, small molecules, and gene silencing. To date, the most promising and advanced approach relates to monoclonal antibodies, which can decrease LDL cholesterol by 65-70%, even as an add-on therapy to a maximal dose of a statin. Phase III studies and large, event-driven clinical trials are ongoing and will fully address the viability and role of these drugs in clinical practice.",

The study was approved by the Institutional review Board (IRB) of The Jordan University Hospital. An informed consent was signed by every participant. A single fragment encoding a 307 bp sequence of the CETP gene, including the SNP of interest at position 14645 in intron 7, was amplified using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique directly from whole blood. The PCR product was then subjected to DNA sequencing. The frequencies of the genotypes of the homozygous minor allele (AA), the homozygous major allele (CC), and the heterozygous allele (CA) were 0.121, 0.405, and 0.474, respectively. The minor allele (A) frequency was 0.358. The frequencies did not deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The lipid profile before the start of statin therapy was similar for all genotypes regarding total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides, while high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was significantly higher in the AA genotype. The AA genotype was also associated with significantly lower CETP activity than the other genotypes. The response to statin therapy was less in the AA genotype than the other genotypes for TC and LDL-C. In conclusion, the homozygous minor allele subjects have higher base line HDL-C, and lower CETP activity than the other genotypes (CA and CC). They also have less reduction in TC and LDL-C after statin therapy.", 
    "59": "Simvastatin has low aqueous solubility resulting in low oral bioavailability (5%) and thus presents a challenge in formulating a suitable dosage form. To improve the aqueous solubility, a solid dispersion formulation of Simvastatin was prepared by lyophilization utilizing skimmed milk as a carrier. Six different formulations were prepared with varying ratios of drug and carrier and the corresponding physical mixtures were also prepared. The improvement of amorphous state through solid dispersion was confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction studies. The optimum drug-to-carrier ratio of 1:9 enhanced solubility nearly 30-fold as compared to pure drug. In-vitro drug release studies exhibited a cumulative release of 86.69% as compared to 25.19% for the pure drug. Additionally, scanning electron microscopy studies suggested the conversion of crystalline Simvastatin to an amorphous form. In a Triton-induced hyperlipidemia model, a 3-fold increase in the lipid lowering potential was obtained with the reformulated drug as compared to pure drug. These results suggest that solid dispersion of Simvastatin using skimmed milk as carrier is a promising approach for oral delivery of Simvastatin.",

It also significantly decreased the number of patients with elevated levels of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase. These changes suggest favourable prognosis for patients with CHD and DM2 because enhanced activity of this enzyme is believed to be a predictor of high cardiovascular risk.

The aim of this study was to compare statin-mediated immunosuppressive effects on human T-cell responses in vitro with those of conventional immunosuppressives (dexamethasone, cyclosporin A (CsA), mycophenolate, and rapamycin). Statins (atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin) were investigated for their modulatory effects on human PBMC viability, cytokine profiles, and T-cell proliferation. At concentrations that inhibited anti-CD3/28-stimulated T-cell proliferation (P < 0.01), simvastatin significantly decreased intracellular CD4(+) T-cell expression of IFN-\u03b3 (P < 0.01) to levels similar to those induced by conventional immunosuppressives. Atorvastatin and lovastatin also decreased IFN-\u03b3 expression, although to a lesser degree (P < 0.05). All three statins reduced levels of IL-17 production (P < 0.01). However, in response to anti-CD3/28 stimulation, simvastatin significantly upregulated IL-1\u03b2 production (P < 0.05). The profile of cytokines produced in response to anti-CD3/28 stimulation was similar when both atorvastatin and dexamethasone were added as compared with dexamethasone alone, suggesting that atorvastatin can synergise with dexamethasone with respect to immunomodulation of cytokines. This data supports the hypothesis of selective statin-mediated immunomodulatory effects on human immune cells.",

Here, we analyzed renal endpoints of the Multifactorial Approach and Superior Treatment Efficacy in Renal Patients with the Aid of Nurse Practitioners (MASTERPLAN) study after extended follow-up to determine whether strict implementation of current CKD guidelines through the aid of nurse practitioners improves renal outcome. In total, 788 patients with moderate to severe CKD were randomized to receive nurse practitioner support added to physician care (intervention group) or physician care alone (control group). Median follow-up was 5.7 years. Renal outcome was a secondary endpoint of the MASTERPLAN study. We used a composite renal endpoint of death, ESRD, and 50% increase in serum creatinine. Event rates were compared with adjustment for baseline serum creatinine concentration and changes in estimated GFR were determined. During the randomized phase, there were small but significant differences between the groups in BP, proteinuria, LDL cholesterol, and use of aspirin, statins, active vitamin D, and antihypertensive medications, in favor of the intervention group. The intervention reduced the incidence of the composite renal endpoint by 20% (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.66 to 0.98; P=0.03). In the intervention group, the decrease in estimated GFR was 0.45 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) per year less than in the control group (P=0.01).

Despite differences in methodology, both meta-analyses show that statin therapy is safe and effective in preventing mortality and major cardiovascular events in non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients.

    "76": "Adipocytes in obesity have inappropriately low cholesterol while adiponectin release is reduced. Cholesterol shortage may contribute to low adiponectin and 3T3-L1 cells treated with lovastatin have diminished adiponectin in cell supernatants. LDL and HDL deliver cholesterol to adipocytes. LDL but not HDL increases adiponectin in cell supernatants of primary human adipocytes. The effect of LDL is not blocked by receptor associated protein suggesting that members of the LDL-receptor family are not involved. To evaluate whether these in vitro observations translate into changes in systemic adiponectin, adiponectin was measured in serum of three patients before, immediately after and 3d after LDL-apheresis. Whereas circulating lipoproteins are reduced immediately after apheresis adiponectin is not changed. Therefore, acute lowering of lipoproteins does not affect systemic adiponectin also excluding that plenty of adiponectin is bound to lipoprotein particles. Accordingly, levels of adiponectin in purified lipoproteins are quite low. Familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL) is a rare disorder associated with low plasma LDL. Serum adiponectin is, however, similar compared to healthy controls. Thus, neither LDL nor HDL directly contributes to circulating adiponectin concentrations.", 
    "77": "Osteosarcoma is the most common primary tumor of bone occurring in children and adolescents. The histological response to chemotherapy represents a key clinical factor related to survival. We previously showed that statins exhibit antitumor effects in vitro, inducing apoptotic cell death, reducing cell migration and invasion capacities and strengthening cytotoxic effects in combination with standard drugs. Comparative transcriptomic analysis between control and statin-treated cells revealed strong expression of several genes, including metallothionein (MT) 2A. MT2A overexpression by lentiviral transduction reduced bioavailable zinc levels, an effect associated with reduced osteosarcoma cell viability and enhanced cell differentiation. In contrast, MT2A silencing did not modify cell viability but strongly inhibited expression of osteoblastic markers and differentiation process. MT2A overexpression induced chemoresistance to cytotoxic drugs through direct chelation of platinum-containing drugs and indirect action on p53 zinc-dependent activity. In contrast, abrogation of MT2A enhanced cytotoxic action of chemotherapeutic drugs on osteosarcoma cells. Finally, clinical samples derived from chemonaive biopsies revealed that tumor cells expressing low MT2A levels correspond to good prognostic (good responder patients with longer survival rate), whereas high MT2A levels were associated with adverse prognosis (poor responder patients). Taken together, these data show that MT2A contributes to chemotherapy resistance in osteosarcoma, an effect partially mediated by zinc chelation. The data also suggest that MT2A may be a potential new prognostic marker for osteosarcoma sensitivity to chemotherapy.", 
    "78": "Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is the most important risk factor for ischemic stroke. The risk is the highest in the first hours after symptom onset, and treatment must be initiated in emergency. In the acute phase, antithrombotic agent is probably the most important treatment, but it is not excluded that lipid-lowering agents and/or antihypertensive drugs are also important. For current guidelines, monotherapy of antiplatelet agent remains the gold standard in emergency. However, most recent data and meta-analysis support a combination therapy of clopidogrel and aspirin. Data on treatment in the very acute phase of TIA in the different etiologic stroke subtypes are also lacking especially for cardioembolic stroke and the potential benefit of anticoagulant. Long-term prevention mainly derived from large trials, in which TIA and minor stroke patients have constituted the largest part. Patients with non-cardioembolic stroke must be treated with antiplatelet agent in monotherapy, and dual antiplatelet therapy such as clopidogrel plus aspirin should be avoided, particularly in lacunar strokes, whereas anticoagulants are the treatment of choice for patients with cardioembolic stroke. Major advances concerning stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation have emerged with new oral anticoagulant agents that are as effective as vitamin K antagonists and safer, especially with regard to the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. At variance with moderate and severe cerebral infarction, oral anticoagulants can be initiated without delay in TIA patients. Left atrial appendage closure seems to be a promising treatment in patients ineligible for anticoagulation. Aggressive management of vascular risk factors, including blood pressure as low as 130/80 mm Hg, intensive statin treatment, smoking cessation and diabetes control, also plays a major role in the prevention of vascular event.",

The study population comprised 3,063 patients with DM from the ACSIS 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2010 enrollment waves who were alive at discharge and received statins. Of these, 225 (7.3%) received on discharge combined bezafibrate and statin therapy, and 2,838 (92.7%) were treated with statins alone. MACEs were defined as a composite measure of death, recurrent myocardial infarction, recurrent ischemia, stent thrombosis, ischemic stroke, and urgent revascularization. The development of 30-day MACEs was recorded in 8% patients receiving combination therapy and 14.2% of those receiving statins alone (p = 0.01). Crude 1-year mortality and 30-day rehospitalization rates were also significantly lower in patients receiving combination therapy: 4.0% versus 8.1% (p = 0.03) and 13.3% versus 21.6% (p = 0.003), respectively. Multivariate analysis identified combined therapy as an independent predictor of reduced risk for 30-day MACEs, with an odds ratio of 0.56 (95% confidence interval 0.34 to 0.92), corresponding to a 44% relative risk reduction. In conclusion, a significantly lower risk for 30-day MACEs was observed in statin-treated patients with DM who also received bezafibrate after ACS. Signals regarding improvement of 30-day rehospitalization and 1-year mortality rates emerged as well.",

In dermatology, fibrosis is the hallmark component of many skin diseases, including systemic sclerosis, graft-versus-host disease, hypertrophic scars, keloids, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, porphyria cutanea tarda, restrictive dermopathy and other conditions. Fibrotic skin disorders may be debilitating and impair quality of life. There are few FDA-approved anti-fibrotic drugs; thus, research in this area is crucial in addressing this deficiency. Recent investigations elucidating the pathogenesis of skin fibrosis have implicated endogenous reactive oxygen species produced by the multicomponent nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (Nox) enzyme complex. In this review, we discuss Nox enzymes and their role in skin fibrosis. An overview of the Nox enzyme family is presented and their role in the pathogenesis of skin fibrosis is discussed. The mechanisms by which Nox enzymes influence specific fibrotic skin disorders are also reviewed. Finally, we describe the therapeutic approaches to ameliorate skin fibrosis by directly targeting Nox enzymes with the use of statins, p47phox subunit modulators, or GKT137831, a competitive inhibitor of Nox enzymes. Nox enzymes can also be targeted indirectly via scavenging ROS with antioxidants. We believe that Nox modulators are worthy of further investigation and have the potential to transform the management of skin fibrosis by dermatologists.",

A subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (5\u2009mg/kg/day) for 10 days was used for the induction of heart failure. Rats were randomly assigned to control, treatment with atorvastatin (5, 10, 20\u2009mg/kg/day) and treatment with atorvastatin plus coenzyme Q10 (10\u2009mg/kg/day). Coenzyme Q10 content of myocardium was measured using HPLC method with UV detector after hemodynamic parameters measurements. The malondialdehyde (MDA) content of the myocardium was evaluated in order to determine coenzyme Q10 antioxidative effect. A high dose of atorvastatin (20\u2009mg/kg/day) was significantly reduced the myocardium content of coenzyme Q10 as compared with isoproterenol treated group (p<0.001). Compared with atorvastatin alone treated animals, co-administration of coenzyme Q10 with atorvastatin was improved the level of coenzyme Q10 in the myocardium (p<0.05, p<0.001). Increasing the dose of atorvastatin also led to increase in MDA content of the myocardium (p<0.01). Serum lipid profile showed no changes in atorvastatin treated groups. The results of this study demonstrate that high doses of atorvastatin reduce coenzyme Q10 content of the myocardium and increase lipid peroxidation in myocardium which is reversed by coenzyme Q10 co-administration.",

Further sub-analysis according to obesity status showed that BRS increased significantly only in the non-obese group (p = 0.036). A low dose of atorvastatin increased BRS in non-obese subjects with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidaemia after 1-year treatment. This finding emphasizes the beneficial effect of atorvastatin on cardiovascular system, beyond the lipid-lowering effects.",

Low dose Aspirin reduces risk of VTE's in high risk populations. The Breast Cancer in Northern Israel Study is a case-control study of consecutive breast cancer cases diagnosed in northern Israel and matched controls. The present analysis was limited to cases with breast cancer enrolled in the study. Data was extracted from Clalit Health Services (CHS) database and from computerized pharmacy records. Out of 3,585 patients enrolled, 261 (7.3%) had a VTE during median follow up of 4.2 years. The 1 and 2 year cumulative incidence was 2.64 and 3.65%. 55.7% of patients used statins, predominantly simvastatin (75.8%). 44.5% used aspirin. In multivariate analysis neither statins nor aspirin use was associated with a reduced risk for a VTE. Unadjusted HR for statin and aspirin was 1.461 (1.018-2.096) and 1.293 (0.846-1.976), respectively, and the adjusted HR were 0.86 (0.648-1.14) and 1.013 (0.737-1.392). Results were similar when only simvastatin use was assessed. Metastatic disease, chemotherapy, age, BMI and presence of comorbidities were significantly associated with risk of VTE's. Our study is the first to look at the effect of statins and aspirin on the incidence of VTE's in patients with breast cancer. In our cohort, statin and aspirin use did not decrease the risk for a VTE. Our results might be explained by use of low potency statins (simvastatin and pravastatin) and by alternate mechanisms for VTE formation in patients with cancer.", 
    "108": "Several lines of evidence have implicated high levels of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) in diabetes. Pancreas impairment caused by AGEs has been found in recent studies. Monascin (MS) and monacolin K (MK) are active compounds identified from Monascus-fermented products, which have been reported to inhibit inflammation and improve insulin resistance. In order to confirm the protective effects of MS and MK on pancreatic function, BALB/c mice were treated with AGEs via intraperitoneal injection for 22 weeks to induce hyperglycemia, and the pancreas-protecting mechanism of MS and MK from AGE-induced damage was investigated. We found that the expression of pancreatic and duodenal homeobox-1 (PDX-1) and glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) was recovered by MS or MK administration to AGE-treated mice. In addition, MS strongly improved performance in the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and the insulin tolerance test (ITT), suggesting that MS sensitized to insulin in AGE-treated mice. Both MS and MK elevated pancreatic insulin expression when compared to the AGE-treated group, suggesting that MS and MK attenuated AGE-induced pancreatic dysfunction. Histopathology studies showed that intraperitoneal injection of AGEs did not result in pancreas damage. These findings confirm that the potential mechanism of AGEs on pancreatic dysfunction involves the induction of inflammation and the suppression of PDX-1 and GLUT2 expression. Taken together, MS and MK may be developed as an anti-diabetic agent in the future.",

We assessed the value of baseline and change in Lp-PLA2 activity to predict outcomes over a 6-year follow-up, the effect of pravastatin on Lp-PLA2 levels, and whether pravastatin treatment effect was related to Lp-PLA2 activity change. Lp-PLA2 was measured at randomization and 1 year, and levels were grouped as quartiles. The prespecified end point was CHD death or nonfatal myocardial infarction. Baseline Lp-PLA2 activity was positively associated with CHD events (P < 0.001) but not after adjustment for 23 baseline factors (P = 0.66). In 6518 patients who were event free at 1 year, change in Lp-PLA2 was a significant independent predictor of subsequent CHD events after adjustment for these risk factors, including LDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol changes (P < 0.001). Pravastatin reduced Lp-PLA2 by 16% compared with placebo (P < 0.001). After adjustment for Lp-PLA2 change, the pravastatin treatment effect was reduced from 23% to 10% (P = 0.26), with 59% of the treatment effect accounted for by changes in Lp-PLA2.

    "137": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (statins) is one of the most commonly prescribed agents for controlling hyperlipidemia. Apart from their lipid-lowering property, statins are well known for their pleiotropic effects, such as improvement of vascular endothelial dysfunction, attenuation of inflammatory responses, stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques, inhibition of vascular smooth muscle proliferation, and modulation of procoagulant activity and platelet function. The vasculo-protective effect of statins is mainly mediated by inhibition of the mevalonate pathway and oxidized low-density lipoprotein generation, thereby enhancing the biosynthesis of endothelium-derived nitric oxide. Accumulating clinical evidence strongly suggests that administration of statins reduces overall mortality, the development myocardial infarction and atrial fibrillation, and length of hospital stay after a major cardiac/noncardiac surgery. This review updates the clinical pharmacology and therapeutic applications of statins during major operations, and highlights the anesthesia considerations for perioperative statin therapy.", 
    "138": "The applicability of high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet light (HPLC-UV) for the determination of the presence of statins in macromycetes of the genus Pleurotus was analyzed. The fungi were obtained by liquid-state fermentation (LSF) using unconventional sources of carbon as substrates and solid-state fermentation (SSF) employing agro industrial wastes. Five statins were used as standards: lovastatin and simvastatin in the lactone form (LOVL and SIML), their corresponding hydro-acidic forms (LOVH and SIMH) and pravastatin (PRA). The following measures were evaluated: the linearity, accuracy and precision, detection limit (DL) and quantification limit (QL). The results demonstrated HPLC-UV to be an effective tool for detecting the presence of statins in extracts of LSF and SSF products. Likewise, it was hypothesized that the strains that were used for the study do not produce statins. This finding highlights the importance of continuing to evaluate other strains of the same genus by using techniques such as HPLC to first separate sufficient quantities of the compounds that were detected using the standard technique but that did not match the retention time (tR) of any of the standards used.", 
    "139": "The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of combined therapy with rosuvastatin (10 mg/kg) and amitriptyline (10 mg/kg) on oxidation-reduction status in the blood of rats. After 2-week application of drugs alone or their combination, the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione reductase (GR) and total antioxidant status (TAS) were determined. It was noticed that combined therapy with rosuvastatin and amitriptyline significantly increased the activity of GPX in comparison to the group receiving only rosuvastatin and decreased the activity of GR in comparison to groups receiving only rosuvastatin or amitriptyline. However, the activity of these enzymes as a result of combined therapy was placed in the level of the control groups. Our studies indicated that the combined therapy with both drugs caused an increase of TAS compared to the groups of animals receiving only one of these drugs. The results indicate on the oxidation-reduction balance and increasing the antioxidant status in rats treated with rosuvastatin and amitriptyline.", 
    "140": "It has been suggested that statins can both stimulate and suppress the immune system, and thereby, may influence autoimmune diseases. Therefore, we studied effects of statins on innate and adaptive immunity, and self-tolerance by measuring serological levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), neopterin, immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies and the presence of autoantibodies (antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and IgM rheumatoid factor (RF)) in the general population. We conducted a nested case-control study within the population-based Doetinchem cohort. Data from health questionnaires, serological measurements and information on medication from linkage to pharmacy-dispensing records were available. We selected 332 statin users (cases) and 331 non-users (controls), matched by age, sex, date of serum collection, history of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus type II and stroke. Multivariate regression analyses were performed to estimate effect of statins on the immune system. The median level of CRP in statin users (1.28 mg/L, interquartile range (IQR): 0.59-2.79) was lower than in non-users (1.62 mg/L, IQR: 0.79-3.35), which after adjustment was estimated to be a 28% lower level. We observed an inverse association between duration of statin use and CRP levels. Elevated levels of IgE (>100 IU/mL) were more prevalent in statin users compared to non-users. A trend towards increased levels of IgE antibodies in statin users was observed, whereas no associations were found between statin use and levels of neopterin or the presence of autoantibodies. In this general population sub-sample, we observed an anti-inflammatory effect of statin use and a trend towards an increase of IgE levels, an surrogate marker for Th (helper) 2 responses without a decrease in neopterin levels, a surrogate marker for Th1 response and/or self-tolerance. We postulate that the observed decreased inflammatory response during statin therapy may be important but is insufficient to induce loss of self-tolerance.", 
    "141": "Inflammatory stress promotes foam cell formation by disrupting LDL receptor feedback regulation in macrophages. Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Proteins (SREBPs) Cleavage-Activating Protein (SCAP) glycosylation plays crucial roles in regulating LDL receptor and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCoAR) feedback regulation. The present study was to investigate if inflammatory stress disrupts LDL receptor and HMGCoAR feedback regulation by affecting SCAP glycosylation in THP-1 macrophages. Intracellular cholesterol content was assessed by Oil Red O staining and quantitative assay. The expression of molecules controlling cholesterol homeostasis was examined using real-time quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting. The translocation of SCAP from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi was detected by confocal microscopy. We demonstrated that exposure to inflammatory cytokines increased lipid accumulation in THP-1 macrophages, accompanying with an increased SCAP expression even in the presence of a high concentration of LDL. These inflammatory cytokines also prolonged the half-life of SCAP by enhancing glycosylation of SCAP due to the elevated expression of the Golgi mannosidase II. This may enhance translocation and recycling of SCAP between the ER and the Golgi, escorting more SREBP2 from the ER to the Golgi for activation by proteolytic cleavages as evidenced by an increased N-terminal of SREBP2 (active form). As a consequence, the LDL receptor and HMGCoAR expression were up-regulated. Interestingly, these effects could be blocked by inhibitors of Golgi mannosidases. Our results indicated that inflammation increased native LDL uptake and endogenous cholesterol de novo synthesis, thereby causing foam cell formation via increasing transcription and protein glycosylation of SCAP in macrophages. These data imply that inhibitors of Golgi processing enzymes might have a potential vascular-protective role in prevention of atherosclerotic foam cell formation.", 
    "142": "Intracellular pathogens have complex metabolic interactions with their host cells to ensure a steady supply of energy and anabolic building blocks for rapid growth. Here we use the obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii to probe this interaction for isoprenoids, abundant lipidic compounds essential to many cellular processes including signaling, trafficking, energy metabolism, and protein translation. Synthesis of precursors for isoprenoids in Apicomplexa occurs in the apicoplast and is essential. To synthesize longer isoprenoids from these precursors, T. gondii expresses a bifunctional farnesyl diphosphate/geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (TgFPPS). In this work we construct and characterize T. gondii null mutants for this enzyme. Surprisingly, these mutants have only a mild growth phenotype and an isoprenoid composition similar to wild type parasites. However, when extracellular, the loss of the enzyme becomes phenotypically apparent. This strongly suggests that intracellular parasite salvage FPP and/or geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) from the host. We test this hypothesis using inhibitors of host cell isoprenoid synthesis. Mammals use the mevalonate pathway, which is susceptible to statins. We document strong synergy between statin treatment and pharmacological or genetic interference with the parasite isoprenoid pathway. Mice can be cured with atorvastatin (Lipitor) from a lethal infection with the TgFPPs mutant. We propose a double-hit strategy combining inhibitors of host and parasite pathways as a novel therapeutic approach against Apicomplexan parasites.", 
    "143": "The occurrence of heart failure during the whole pre-discharge course of coronary revascularization, as far as its influence on subsequent prognosis, is poorly understood. The present study examined the effect of transient heart failure (THF) developing in the acute and rehabilitative phase on survival after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Patients in the Italian survey on cardiac rehabilitation and secondary prevention after cardiac revascularization (ICAROS) were analyzed for THF, the latter being defined either as signs and symptoms consistent with decompensation or cardiogenic shock. ICAROS was a prospective, multicenter registry of 1,262 consecutive patients discharged from 62 cardiac rehabilitation (CR) facilities, providing data on risk factors, lifestyle habits, drug treatments, and major cardiovascular events (MACE) during a 1-year follow-up. Records were linked to the official website of the Italian Association of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation (GICR-IACPR). The overall prevalence of pre-discharge THF was 7.6%, with 69.8% of cases in acute wards, 22.9% during CR, and 7.3% in both settings. THF affected more frequently patients with chronic cardiac condition (42.7 vs. 30.6%; p < 0.05), age \u226575 years (33.3 vs. 23.1%; p < 0.005), COPD (19.8 vs. 12.3%; p < 0.05), and chronic kidney disease (17.7 vs. 7%; p < 0.001). After discharge, THF patients showed good maintenance rates of RAAS modulators (90.6%) and beta-blockers (83.3%), while statin therapy significantly decreased from 81.3 to 64.6% (p < 0.05). The pursuit of secondary prevention targets, as far as self-reported drug adherence, was not different among groups. Patients with THF had increased 1-year mortality (8.3 vs. 1.6%, p < 0.001). Moreover, THF independently predicted adverse outcome with OR for recurrent events (mainly further episodes of decompensation) of 2.4 (CI 1.4-4.3). Patients who experienced THF after coronary revascularization had increased post-discharge mortality and cardiovascular events. Hemodynamic instability, rather than recurrent myocardial ischemia, seems to be linked with worse prognosis.",

Previous in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that statins stimulate bone formation. However, orally administered statins may be degraded during first-pass metabolism in the liver. This study aimed to prevent this degradation by developing a locally administered formulation of simvastatin that is encapsulated in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)/hydroxyapatite (SIM/PLGA/HAp) microspheres with controlled-release properties. The effect of this formulation of simvastatin on bone repair was tested using a mouse model of gap fracture bridging with a graft of necrotic bone. The simvastatin released over 12 days from 3 mg and 5 mg of SIM/PLGA/HAp was 0.03-1.6 \u03bcg/day and 0.05-2.6 \u03bcg/day, respectively. SIM/PLGA/HAp significantly stimulated callus formation around the repaired area and increased neovascularization and cell ingrowth in the grafted necrotic bone at week 2 after surgery. At week 4, both 3 mg and 5 mg of SIM/PLGA/HAp increased neovascularization, but only 5 mg SIM/PLGA/HAp enhanced cell ingrowth into the necrotic bone. The low dose of simvastatin released from SIM/PLGA/HAp enhanced initial callus formation, neovascularization, and cell ingrowth in the grafted bone, indicating that SIM/PLGA/HAp facilitates bone regeneration. We suggest that SIM/PLGA/HAp should be developed as an osteoinductive agent to treat osteonecrosis or in combination with an osteoconductive scaffold to treat severe bone defects.",

Evidence is accumulating that steroid-refractory graft-versus-host disease is associated with endothelial distress. Endothelial cell homeostasis is regulated by nitric oxide, and serum nitrates are derived from nitric oxide synthase activity or dietary sources. In this retrospective study based on 417 patients allografted at our institution we investigated whether quantification of serum nitrates could predict steroid-refractory graft-versus-host disease. Elevated pre-transplant levels of serum nitrates (>26.5 \u03bcM) predicted steroid-refractory graft-versus-host disease (P=0.026) and non-relapse mortality (P=0.028), particularly in combination with high pre-transplant angiopoietin-2 levels (P=0.0007 and P=0.021, respectively). Multivariate analyses confirmed serum nitrates as independent predictors of steroid-refractory graft-versus-host disease and non-relapse mortality. Differences in serum nitrate levels did not correlate with serum levels of tumor necrosis factor or C-reactive protein or expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase in blood cells. Patients with high pre-transplant nitrate levels had significantly reduced rates of refractory graft-versus-host disease (P=0.031) when pravastatin was taken. In summary, patients at high risk of developing steroid-refractory graft-versus-host disease could be identified prior to transplantation by serum markers linked to endothelial cell function. Retrospectively, statin medication was associated with a reduced incidence of refractory graft-versus-host disease in this endothelial high-risk cohort.",

    "182": "Approximately 25% of patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) exhibit cognitive dysfunction (CD) 1 day and 1 month after CEA. The apolipoprotein E (apoE)-\u03b54 polymorphism has been previously identified as a robust independent risk factor for CD 1 month after CEA. We aimed to determine whether the apoE-\u03b54 polymorphism is also an independent risk factor for CD as early as 1 day after CEA and to confirm the previous findings at 1 month. Patients undergoing elective CEA (n=411) were enrolled with written informed consent in this follow-up observational study. CD was evaluated via an extensive neuropsychometric battery. apoE-\u03b54 carriers exhibited significantly more CD 1 day (30.1% versus 17.9%, p=0.01) and 1 month (25.7% versus 9.8%, p=0.001) after CEA compared to non-carriers. Multivariate regression models were generated to determine independent predictors of CD. At 1 day, apoE-\u03b54 was significantly associated with higher risk of CD (odds ratio [OR]: 2.24 [95% confidence interval 1.29-3.84], p=0.004), while statin use was significantly associated with lower risk (OR: 0.40 [0.24-0.67], p<0.001). At 1 month, apoE-\u03b54 was significantly associated with higher risk of CD (OR: 3.14 [1.53-6.38], p=0.002), while symptomatic status was significantly associated with lower risk (OR: 0.45 [0.20-0.94], p=0.03). The apoE-\u03b54 polymorphism is an independent risk factor for CD as early as 1 day after CEA and is confirmed to be an independent risk factor for CD at 1 month as well.",

COPD is increasingly considered a multisystem disease characterized by both pulmonary and systemic inflammation. Over the last 5 years, there have been a growing number of studies showing that the cholesterol-lowering drugs statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) have a beneficial effect in patients with COPD. While statins are known to have a number of pharmacological effects (pleiotropy) that could explain these benefits, it is currently not clear which effects are most relevant in COPD. This article reviews the most recently published studies of statin therapy in patients with COPD, focusing on the important COPD co-morbidities of the pulmonary system (infective exacerbations, pneumonia, influenza and lung cancer) and cardiovascular system (acute coronary syndrome, endothelial dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension). While we await the results of randomized controlled trials, there continues to be consistent (albeit indirect) evidence from observational studies suggesting statins are beneficial for patients with COPD, conferring important pharmacological effects on inflammation not conferred by current inhaler-based therapies.",

The objectives of this Phase III study were to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of saroglitazar (ZYH1) 2-mg and 4-mg tablets (Lipaglyn\u2122; Zydus Cadila, Ahmedabad, India) compared with placebo in patients with diabetic dyslipidemia who are not controlled with atorvastatin 10\u2009mg therapy.", 
    "185": "This was a 16-week prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, three-arm Phase III study in subjects with hypertriglyceridemia (>200 and <500\u2009mg/dL) with T2DM not controlled with atorvastatin 10\u2009mg. The study consisted of a run-in period of 4 weeks of life-style modification followed by 12 weeks of treatment with saroglitazar (2-mg or 4-mg) or placebo tablets. The primary end point was the change in plasma triglyceride level compared with baseline and the placebo arm at the end of Week 12. The secondary exploratory end points were change in lipid profile and fasting plasma glucose at Week 12. In total, 302 subjects were randomized to receive one of the treatments, saroglitazar 2\u2009mg (n=101) or saroglitazar 4\u2009mg (n=99), or matching placebo (n=102). Patients who received study medication and had undergone at least one post baseline efficacy evaluation were included in the efficacy analysis.", 
    "186": "At Week 12, saroglitazar 2-mg and 4-mg tablets significantly reduced mean plasma triglyceride levels by -45.5\u00b13.03% and -46.7\u00b13.02% (mean\u00b1SE), respectively, and the difference was significant (P<0.001) compared with placebo. Saroglitazar 2\u2009mg demonstrated significant decrease in levels of non-HDL-C, very LDL-C, total cholesterol, and fasting plasma glucose. Additionally, saroglitazar 4\u2009mg also significantly reduced LDL-C and apolipoprotein B levels. Saroglitazar was found to be safe and well tolerated by patients.", 
    "187": "Saroglitazar appeared to be an effective and safe therapeutic option for improving hypertriglyceridemia in patients with T2DM.", 
    "188": "Lack of patient involvement in decision making has been suggested as one reason for limited treatment success. Concepts such as shared decision making may contribute to high quality healthcare by supporting patients to make informed decisions together with their physicians.A multi-component shared decision making programme on the prevention of heart attack in type 2 diabetes has been developed. It aims at improving the quality of decision-making by providing evidence-based patient information, enhancing patients' knowledge, and supporting them to actively participate in decision-making. In this study the efficacy of the programme is evaluated in the setting of a diabetes clinic.", 
    "189": "A single blinded randomised-controlled trial is conducted to compare the shared decision making programme with a control-intervention. The intervention consists of an evidence-based patient decision aid on the prevention of myocardial infarction and a corresponding counselling module provided by diabetes educators. Similar in duration and structure, the control-intervention targets nutrition, sports, and stress coping. A total of 154 patients between 40 and 69 years of age with type 2 diabetes and no previous diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease or stroke are enrolled and allocated either to the intervention or the control-intervention. Primary outcome measure is the patients' knowledge on benefits and harms of heart attack prevention captured by a standardised knowledge test. Key secondary outcome measure is the achievement of treatment goals prioritised by the individual patient. Treatment goals refer to statin taking, HbA1c-, blood pressure levels and smoking status. Outcomes are assessed directly after the counselling and at 6 months follow-up. Analyses will be carried out on intention-to-treat basis. Concurrent qualitative methods are used to explore intervention fidelity and to gain insight into implementation processes.",

    "192": "Statins exert anti-inflammatory characteristics, besides their lipid lowering properties, and may display beneficial effects for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. One possible explanation is that statins interfere in the deregulated gene transcription patterns associated with immune-mediated diseases, although the precise mechanism is not fully understood. Besides gene regulatory proteins, epigenetic mechanisms play an important role in the orchestration of gene expression. Disturbances in the tightly controlled epigenetic mechanisms influence the cellular portrait of expressed genes resulting in the protein dysfunctions found in many inflammatory diseases. In this study, we found that simvastatin reduces secretion and gene expression of CCL2 in monocyte-derived immature dendritic cells and in type 1 macrophages, which is accompanied by increased levels of the 3meK27H3 and 3meK9H3 repressive histone marks and decreased levels of the permissive histone marks AcH3 and 3meK4H3 in CCL2 promoter chromatin. The repressive chromatin status of the CCL2 promoter region affected recruitment of the NF-\u03baB p65 subunit, which controls CCL2 transcription. The down-regulation of CCL2 in these immune cells may therefore impact their chemotactic activity and reduce their recruitment to sites of tissue injury.", 
    "193": "Three functionally distinct monocyte subsets have been identified. Statins are of undoubted effect in atherosclerosis and have numerous pleiotropic effects that contribute to their clinical success, but the effect of these drugs on monocyte subsets is unclear. We hypothesised a beneficial effect of statins on key receptor expression by monocyte subsets.", 
    "194": "Effects of temporal (2\u00a0weeks) cessation of statin therapy by 66 patients with stable coronary artery disease on monocyte subsets [CD14++CD16-CCR2+ (Mon1), CD14++CD16+CCR2+ (Mon2) and CD14+CD16++CCR2- (Mon3)], their aggregates with platelets and their expression of a number of receptors involved in inflammation (IL-6 receptor), adhesion [vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)], angiogenesis [vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)] and repair were assessed by flow cytometry.", 
    "195": "Statin cessation did not lead to any significant changes in absolute numbers of monocyte subsets or the degree of their aggregation with platelets. All monocyte subsets showed significant downregulation of expression of vascular endothelial factor receptor 2, Tie2 and Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4; all changes P\u00a0<\u00a00\u00b701). Expression of CXCR4 was only reduced in Mon1 cells (P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b7013). There was no significant change in the expression of CD14, CD16, CCR4, IL6 receptor and VCAM (all P\u00a0=\u00a0NS).", 
    "196": "Statin withdrawal does not affect counts of any of monocyte subsets, but leads to downregulation of expression of TLR4 and receptors related to angiogenesis on all subsets, as well as a decrease in density of CXCR4 expression on 'classical' Mon1. These data provide further support of pleiotropic effects of statins and their effects on monocyte pro-angiogenic and proreparative characteristics.", 
    "197": "Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) is a rare, inherited metabolic disease, caused by low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor abnormality, consequently leading to an increase of serum levels of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C). Clinically, this disease is characterized by the deposition of LDL-C in skin, tendons, and arterial wall. Children with HoFH develop significant coronary artery disease (CAD) in the first decade of life and frequently die of myocardial infarction (MI) before 20 years of age.", 
    "198": "An 8-year-old boy with a diagnosis of acute MI on January 15, 2012 was admitted to our hospital for further evaluation of the potential cause and treatment. He had severe hypercholesterolemia for the past several years and showed typical signs of FH. Laboratory work-up excluded secondary causes of hypercholesterolemia and a diagnosis of HoFH was made after assessing the lipid profiles of his parents and his relatives. After careful consideration, he was prescribed a combination regime of lipid-lowering therapy. The plasma pro-protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) levels were also evaluated for him and his family members.", 
    "199": "His total cholesterol (TC) was 18.96 mmol/L and both parents had hypercholesterolemia (TC of mother: 7.46 mmol/L and father: 8.74 mmol/L). The plasma level of PCSK9 of the patient was significantly higher than his parents and his uncles and this pattern was similar with the level of their lipid profile. Importantly but not surprisingly, his serum lipid profile was not significantly improved by concomitant use of rosuvastatin 10 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg daily for one month, even a double dose of rosuvastatin and ezetimibe 10 mg daily for another month.", 
    "200": "The present case may have an important clinical implication for future investigation regarding the relation of HoFH to statin and PCSK9."
