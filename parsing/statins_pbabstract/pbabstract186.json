    "0": "Studies carried out to determine the abilities of statins showed that they have multiple cholesterol-independent benefits, named pleiotropic. These effects are highly diverse and assume such properties as the improvement of endothelial dysfunction, damaged by multiple pathologic conditions, with secondary increase in NO bioavailability. Also at endothelial level, statins have the ability of diminishing the adhesion molecules expression, thus having an indirect vasodilatator role. Their antioxidant ability is manifest in various ways: decreases the superoxide radical anion production, fact that theoretically makes them useful in the treatment of other conditions like dyslipidemia or cardiovascular diseases. Their antiinflammatory role is complex and consists, among others, in the increase of antiinflammatory cytokines production, diminution of the action of the proinflammatory ones, and decrease of monocyte recruitment.",

The etiology of degenerative AoS is actually well known, the primary lesion being aortic sclerosis. Aortic sclerosis shares many pathological features and risk factors with atherosclerosis and, because atherosclerosis may be prevented and/or reversed by cholesterol lowering, there has been postulated that cholesterol lowering therapy using statin drugs could modify the course of aortic sclerosis/stenosis. Some studies also demonstrated the implication of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in the degenerative aortic disease, and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors could also be used to delayed or even reverse the evolution of Ao sclerosis/stenosis. The paper reviews the latest literature date about the definition and prevalence of aortic sclerosis and stenosis as well as medical treatment of degenerative AoS.",

In U2OS cells, simvastatin inhibited OSM-induced CREB phosphorylation and CREB-DNA binding. Knockdown of CREB by short hairpin RNA reduced Cyr61 synthesis. OSM-induced Cyr61 promoter activation was dependent on CRE-CREB interaction and inhibited by simvastatin. Cyr61 enhanced CCL2 expression by U2OS cells.

In patients with statin treatment and Asian diet, it has not been clearly known whether non-fasting values could be used for the clinical decision making in diabetic patients. In this study, fasting and post-prandial plasma lipid profiles of hospitalized type 2 diabetic patients taking statin, were measured in whom standard diabetic breakfast in traditional Korean style were provided. In repeated-measures ANOVA, there were no significant differences among fasting, post-prandial 2 and 4 hr low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol values. When compared to fasting levels, both post-prandial 2 hr and 4 hr LDL cholesterol levels were misclassified as not achieved target goal only in 4% of patients. Post-prandial HDL cholesterol matched with fasting values in women, without exception. In conclusion, the fasting and post-prandial LDL and HDL cholesterol levels are not significantly different each other and can be used in the assessment of achieving target goal in type 2 diabetes taking statin after Korean diet.", 
    "9": "Statins, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, are commonly used in the therapy of cardiovascular diseases. Recent studies suggest that statins may induce amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in some patients, but no pathogenic mechanism has been proposed for this association. Herein the hypothesis is proposed that statins may induce or aggravate ALS by impairing liver X receptor (LXR) signaling. The hypothesis is supported by the following observations: 1) statins inhibit the synthesis of endogenous LXR agonists, oxysterols, and decrease the expression of LXR target genes in many cells, 2) mice lacking LXRbeta exhibit sn ALS-like phenotype, 3) statins increase the concentration of plant sterols in plasma and tissues, partially by impairing LXR-dependent signaling, which results in augmented intestinal absorption and impaired biliary excretion of plant sterols, and 4) some plant sterols are toxic to motor neurons of the spinal cord, which are primarily affected in ALS patients. If this hypothesis is confirmed, LXR agonists could be used together with statins in patients predisposed to develop ALS or in those known to have the disorder to prevent motor neuron degeneration.", 
    "10": "Patients with permanent pacemakers (PM) are at high risk of developing atrial fibrillation (AF). Minimal ventricular pacing modalities have been demonstrated to reduce AF in such patients, although they are not suitable for patients with advanced atrioventricular conduction disease. Recent evidences suggest that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (i.e. statins) may represent a new strategy to prevent AF in patients at risk. In this article, we sought to review data regarding the effectiveness of statin therapy in preventing AF patients with a PM. We reviewed all available studies that assessed the effect of statin therapy on the occurrence of AF in patients with PM, implanted due to sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular conduction disease. Moreover, a random effect inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis was performed, by entering directly the logarithm of the hazard ratio (HR) of AF provided in the multiple Cox regression analyses from each study. Three studies were identified, including 552 patients, of whom 159 received statins. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 2.77 years. Two studies (one observational and one prospective randomized) included predominantly patients with sinus node dysfunction (70% and 91% of patient population, respectively) and, consistently, showed a beneficial effect of statins on the occurrence of AF. On the other hand, the study including predominantly patients with atrioventricular block (60% of patient population) failed to show a beneficial effect of statins on AF occurrence. The HR for AF occurrence for the cumulative data was found to be 0.43 (95% confidence interval: 0.28-0.67, P < 0.001). Statistical heterogeneity between included studies was not detected (chi(2) = 1.68, P = 0.43, I(2) = 0%), although significant clinical differences were found in terms of study design, patient populations, statins use and dosage and AF-monitoring capabilities. Statins may represent a novel treatment strategy to prevent the occurrence of AF in patients with PM, especially for those who had a PM implanted due to sinus node dysfunction. Basing on our findings, a randomized clinical trial with a proper design to evaluate the utility of statins in preventing AF in these patients is warranted.",

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the combination of sildenafil and simvastatin is superior to each drug alone in the prevention of MCT-induced PAH. Phosphorylated Smad levels were decreased in lung tissue in MCT-injected rats, whereas ERK protein levels were increased. This indicates a possible role for an increase in mitogenic ERK activity in addition to decreased proapoptotic Smad signaling in the MCT model of PAH. Combination sildenafil and simvastatin treatment prevented the MCT-induced increases in right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), exerted an anti-proliferative effect on pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC). Our results indicate that combination therapy with sildenafil and simvastatin attenuated the development of pulmonary hypertension more than either treatment alone.",

In human blood, 80% of those express Vgamma9Vdelta2-TCRs that are specific for conserved non peptidic compound, phosphoantigens (PAgs). Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells recognize in vitro a wide array of transformed cells and are activated in vivo in various tumor. Owing to their ability to directly kill tumor cells and produce inflammatory cytokines (such as IFN-gamma) boosting antitumor properties of other immune effector cells, gamma delta T cells contribute to protective immunity against cancers. These observations, and the recent availability of synthetic clinical grade PAg or pharmacological inducers of PAg (e.g. aminobisphosphonates) able to trigger Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cell, have fostered development of new gammadelta T cell-based therapeutic strategies, which are depicted in this review.",

This transformation is paramountly important for efficient preparation of (R)-ethyl 3-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)hex-5-enoate - a key lactonized statin side chain precursor. The results obtained give thorough calorimetric insight into this complex low-temperature synthesis as well as a new understanding of the suggested reductive elimination of the final intermediates in the coupling reaction. Namely, the surprising unexpected spontaneous three-step exothermal event has been observed during controlled progressive heating of the mixture of the final intermediates to the room temperature. This phenomenon confirms that coupling between functionalized primary alkyl halide and vinylic organocuprate reagent is not a simple SN2 substitution reaction. The presented study provides among others the first reported values of reaction enthalpies and corresponding adiabatic temperature rises of reaction mixture for all exothermic events that occurred in the (R)-ethyl 3-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)hex-5-enoate synthesis. The obtained results ensure consequential thermal process safety knowledge which can be incorporated into safe process scale-up as well as design of reactor system with sufficient cooling capacity for industrial production of (R)-ethyl 3-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)hex-5-enoate.

Epidemiological evidence suggests that elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are both factors causing coronary heart disease. These authors compared extended-release niacin, which raises HDL-C, with ezetimibe, which lowers LDL-C, in a study named Arterial Biology for the Investigation of the Treatment Effects of Reducing Cholesterol 6-HDL and LDL Treatment Strategies (ARBITER 6-HALTS). The study was terminated early and only 208 patients were included in the analysis. Ezetimibe decreased LDL-C by 19.2%, to 66 mg/dl (1.7 mmol/l), whereas niacin increased HDL-C by 18.4%. Ezetimibe did not reduce carotid intima-media thickness, whereas niacin decreased it significantly. Moreover, major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in 5% of the ezetimibe group but only 1% of the niacin group (p = 0.04). The study suggests that niacin may be more effective than ezetimibe as an adjunct to statin in regressing atherosclerosis and in preventing cardiovascular events. This small study of short duration reported a very large treatment effect, so the findings need to be confirmed in a larger longer trial. Nevertheless, it provides the evidence that we now have an additional class of drugs besides statins that can reduce atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events.",

Atorvastatin was effective in significantly slowing the growth of HCT116 colon cancer cell xenografts in nude mice (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008). Further, this reduction is due to increased levels of apoptosis.",

Atorvastatin, while not effective in preventing polyp formation in the min mouse model, was very effective in slowing tumor growth in a nude mouse model.

However, the safety of pravachol has not been shown in pediatric patients with BrOb after HSCT. We report on the safety and tolerability in 5 pediatric HSCT patients with established BrOb. All participants tolerated the drug without difficulty and there were no pravachol-associated adverse effects. Changes in creatine kinase (CK) and transaminases were minimal in 4 patients. One patient experienced increased CK and alanine aminotransferase, and a decrease in platelet count in the setting of severe systemic illness. No other patient had a clinically relevant change in white blood cell count, platelet count, or hemoglobin. Pravachol was well tolerated and safe in this group of patients, and merits further study in this patient population.",

In a multivariate model adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, and biochemistry, PF4-H-ABs were associated with sudden death. No significant association between PF4-H-ABs and all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, or the CVE was observed. Detecting an interaction between acetylsalicylic acid and PF4-H-ABs regarding sudden death and mortality, we found that the association between PF4-H-ABs and outcomes was restricted to patients with acetylsalicylic acid use, most likely because of indication bias.",

Yet we need to do better. We need to improve the number needed to treat. We should strive for further refinements in risk prediction to individualize interventions. Imaging and genetic biomarkers will likely find their place in clinical practice alongside traditional risk factors and biomarkers of inflammation in the years to come. We must aim to assure that individuals targeted for statin therapy do not lessen their adherence to a healthy lifestyle, believing that they enjoy pharmacological protection from unhealthy behaviours. At the other extreme, we need to counsel carefully certain patients to avoid creating a cohort of 'cardiac neurotics' with above median high-sensitivity C-reactive protein readings. We need to understand more about the mechanisms and clinical significance of unwanted actions of statins, including dysglycaemia. We need to devise measures to optimize lifestyle change at both a medical and societal level. For our individual patients, implementation of sustained lifestyle change has proved very challenging in practice, given the multiplicity of behaviours that require vigilance. The clinical use of biomarkers of inflammation may provide the practitioner with a tool to help gauge residual risk, and chart a course for its optimal management.", 
    "34": "Simvastatin is a hypolipidemic drug which is used to control hypercholesterolemia and to prevent cardiovascular disease. In the current study, the effects of high and low doses of simvastatin treatment on tibia of healthy rats were investigated. Wistar rats were used for the control, 20mg and 50mg simvastatin-treated groups. Molecular investigations were performed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. In the bones of the two groups of simvastatin-treated rats, the relative mineral/matrix ratio (p<0.001), relative carbonate content (p<0.001), carbonate/amide I ratio (p<0.001) and crystallinity (p<0.001) decreased significantly compared to the control group. Low dose of simvastatin treatment is more effective in reducing the relative carbonate content indicating the amount of carbonate substitution for phosphate in the mineral crystal. The olefinic band almost disappeared in the high dose of simvastatin-treated group which implies a decrease in unsaturation and an increase in lipid peroxidation. The higher frequency value and the bandwidth of CH(2) asymmetric stretching band for the 50mg treated group imply more disordered (p<0.001) and fluid (p<0.001) membrane structure. Low dose of simvastatin is more effective in strengthening the bone than high dose simvastatin treatment. High dose simvastatin treatment induces lipid peroxidation and changes the lipid composition and concentration, which are known to affect membrane physical properties.", 
    "35": "Chinese red yeast rice is a dietary supplement containing monacolins, unsaturated fatty acids, and phytosterols capable of lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Few studies have reported on its use in clinical practice or in statin-intolerant patients. We reviewed approximately 1,400 clinical charts and identified 25 patients treated with red yeast rice for > or =4 weeks. The patients were included if they had pre- and post-treatment lipid levels without simultaneous changes in other lipid-lowering medications. These patients had experienced myalgias (68%), gastrointestinal intolerance (16%), and/or elevated alanine aminotransferase levels (8%) with previous use of other lipid-lowering agents. The total cholesterol decreased 15% (-37 +/- 26 mg/dl, p <0.001) and LDL cholesterol decreased 21% (-35 +/- 25 mg/dl, p <0.001) during 74 +/- 39 days of treatment. Most (92%) patients tolerated the treatment, and many (56%) achieved their LDL cholesterol goal. In patients unable to tolerate daily statin use, the total cholesterol level decreased 13% (-33 +/- 10 mg/dl, p <0.001) and LDL cholesterol decreased 19% (-31 +/- 4 mg/dl, p <0.001).

The percentage of change from baseline in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and the percentage of patients achieving prespecified LDL cholesterol levels after 12 weeks of ezetimibe 10 mg plus atorvastatin versus up titration of atorvastatin were assessed in subjects > or = 65 years old with hyperlipidemia and at high risk of coronary heart disease. After stabilization of atorvastatin 10-mg therapy, 1,053 patients, > or = 65 years old, at high risk of coronary heart disease, with and without atherosclerotic vascular disease and a LDL cholesterol level that was not <70 or <100 mg/dl, respectively, were randomized to receive ezetimibe added to atorvastatin 10 mg for 12 weeks versus up titration to atorvastatin 20 mg for 6 weeks followed by up titration to atorvastatin 40 mg for an additional 6 weeks. Ezetimibe added to atorvastatin 10 mg resulted in significantly greater changes at week 6 in LDL cholesterol (p <0.001), significantly more patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease achieving a LDL cholesterol level of <70 mg/dl (p <0.001), and significantly more patients without atherosclerotic vascular disease achieving a LDL cholesterol level of <100 mg/dl (p <0.001) at weeks 6 and 12 compared to atorvastatin 20 mg or atorvastatin 40 mg. In addition, ezetimibe plus atorvastatin 10 mg resulted in significantly greater changes at week 6 in total cholesterol, triglycerides, non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, apolipoprotein B (all p <0.001), and HDL cholesterol (p = 0.021) compared with atorvastatin 20 mg and significantly greater changes at week 12 in LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-I (p = 0.001), total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B (p <0.030), and HDL cholesterol (p <0.001) compared with atorvastatin 40 mg. Both treatments were generally well tolerated, with comparable safety profiles. In conclusion, adding ezetimibe to atorvastatin 10 mg produced significantly greater favorable changes in most lipids at 6 and 12 weeks and significantly greater attainment of prespecified LDL cholesterol levels than doubling or quadrupling the atorvastatin dose in patients > or =65 years old at high risk for coronary heart disease.", 
    "37": "Current guidelines recommend risk stratification largely based on traditional risk factors such as those in the Framingham Risk Score. We studied the distribution of 12 traditional and non-traditional risk markers (age > or =65 years, male gender, family history of premature coronary heart disease, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol > or =70 mg/dl, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol <40 mg/dl in men and <50 mg/dl in women, systolic blood pressure >130 mm Hg, diabetes mellitus, smoking, C-reactive protein > or =2 mg/L, triglycerides >150 mg/dl, prediabetes defined as a fasting glucose level 100 to 125 mg/dl or hemoglobin A1c >6, and obesity defined as body mass index > or =30 kg/m(2)) in 3,675 patients from the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 trial at 4 months and evaluated the risk of cardiovascular events stratified by the number of risk factors. The median number of risk factors was 5. In individual risk factor subgroups, men, smokers, hypertensives, and patients with increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol had just that added risk factor compared to their counterparts (median 5 vs 4). In contrast, patients with diabetes, prediabetes, and increased triglycerides, C-reactive protein, or body mass index had not only that, but also another added risk factor (median 6 vs 4). A higher risk factor count was strongly related with increased rate of death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, or revascularization, from 0% to 38.6% at 2 years for 0 to > or =9 risk factors (p <0.0001). In conclusion, with the observed \"clustering\" of risk factors and the link between increasing risk factor count and adverse outcomes in a patient with 1 diagnosed risk factor, a comprehensive review of traditional and novel risk factors is important to fully assess cardiovascular risk.", 
    "38": "Statins inhibit the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver resulting in a decrease of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and a limited increase in HDL cholesterol. Statins also have pleiotropic effects, such as stabilisation of atherosclerotic plaques. The 4S-study was the first trial that demonstrated a significant benefit with statins in secondary prevention. The WOSCOPS-study was the first to prove the efficacy of statins in primary prevention. diseases approximately 10 years later than men. Therefore, it looks as if women are protected against cardiovascular diseases. Hence, they were underrepresented in large clinical trials. If there is no limited life expectancy, elderly--even older than 85 years--do not have to be treated differently for the secondary prevention than younger people. For primary prevention, the situation of the patient has to be evaluated, paying attention to additional risk factors. Type 2 diabetic patients that already have had a cardiovascular incident are considered to be at high risk and are eligible for an intensive therapy. Primary prevention in diabetic patients is often compared with secondary prevention in non-diabetic patients. The use of statins in children is controversial due to possible interference with the development of the child. New guidelines decrease the age for starting a therapy from 10 years old to 8 years old. For all patients a good safety profile is very important, given the long duration of therapy. Statins are used increasingly in high dose and accordingly the risk of adverse effects increases. Muscle toxicity is the most frequent side effect. The risk is strongly intensified by drug interactions through CYP3A4 (for simvastatin and atorvastatin), high doses, and combination therapy with fibrates. The use of statins during pregnancy is contra-indicated. Pharmacists are well placed to give advice about the risks of the use, or non-use, of statins. A high cholesterol level and the accompanied risk of cardiovascular disease, is something that one cannot really sense. The well-established effects of statins have to be explained to patients, together with a healthy life style. It is important to mention that the effects of statins in high--risk patients are largely proven. For primary prevention the risk factors have to be evaluated individually. Compliance is often low and pharmacists can play a major role in the pharmaceutical care of cardiovascular patients.", 
    "39": "In western countries approximately a quarter of the population is 65 years and older. People in this age group often have several coexisting medical problems and take multiple drugs, and older people receive the greatest proportion of dispensed prescriptions. The prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, the leading cause of death and a major cause of physical and cognitive disability, increases steeply with increasing age. Drugs for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular conditions account for a large proportion of medication prescription in older persons. Despite a number of published guidelines and expert recommendations supporting a standardized use of many cardiovascular agents, there is growing evidence of a tremendous variability in cardiovascular drug prescriptions according to demographics, health characteristics, and setting of care. In particular, evidence shows an inverse relationship between treatment propensity and age. To date, there is little evidence of benefit of most pharmacotherapy in frail, older subjects or elderly individuals with multiple comorbidities and polypharmacotherapy. However, effective treatment should not be denied solely on the basis of age. A major challenge in geriatric practice is to ensure safe and effective pharmacological treatments, avoiding the risk of polypharmacy and inappropriate drug prescription.",

We investigated whether plasma levels of C-terminal pro-endothelin-1 (CT-pro-ET-1) are associated with left ventricular (LV) mass and aortic root diameter in African-American adults with hypertension. Plasma CT-pro-ET-1 was measured by an immunoluminometric assay in 1041 African Americans (65\u00b19 years, 72% women) with hypertension. LV mass and aortic root diameter were measured according to the American Society of Echocardiography guidelines, and LV mass was indexed by height to the power 2.7 (LVMi). Multivariable regression analyses were used to assess whether plasma CT-pro-ET-1 was associated with LVMi and aortic root diameter, independent of potential confounding variables. Plasma CT-pro-ET-1 was modestly correlated with LVMi (r=0.21, P<0.0001) and aortic root diameter (r=0.09, P=0.004). In separate multivariable regression models that adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking history, diabetes, history of myocardial infarction or stroke, and blood pressure-lowering medication and statin use, log CT-pro-ET-1 was significantly associated with greater LVMi (P=0.001) and larger aortic root diameter (P=0.006).

Lowering cholesterol in experimental animal models slows the expression of Alzheimer's pathology. These findings raise the possibility that treating humans with cholesterol lowering medications might reduce the risk of developing AD or help treat it. The statins (lovastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, and others) are powerful cholesterol lowering agents of proven benefit in vascular disease. Several clinical studies comparing the occurrence of AD between users and non-users of statins suggested that risk of AD was substantially reduced among the users. However, because these studies were not randomized trials, they provided insufficient evidence to recommend statin therapy. Cochrane reviews are based on the best available information about healthcare interventions and they focus primarily on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). On the issue of prevention, two randomized trials have been carried out and neither showed any reduction in occurrence of AD in patients treated with statins compared to those given placebo. Statins cannot therefore be recommended for the prevention of AD. Regarding treatment of AD, the large RCTs which have assessed this outcome have not published their results. Initial analysis from the studies available indicate statins have no benefit on the outcome measure ADAS-Cog but have a significant beneficial effect on MMSE as an outcome. We need to await full results from the RCTs before we can be certain. In addition statins were not detrimental to cognition in either systematic review.",

While this phenomenon is known in renal disease, it also exists in some patients with exertional angina. Vascular pathology suggests biomineralisation associated with development of osteoblast-like cells in the arterial wall. While some conventional risk factors are shared with atheroma formation, others such as ethnicity and medications appear more specific to extensive calcification and may mirror those for osteoporosis. Similarly an atherogenic diet can predispose to both conditions while some elements promote or inhibit coronary calcification but not atheroma formation. The immune and endocrine systems contribute to both conditions but not necessarily in the same way, with vitamins D and K more related to calcification than atheroma formation. Finally, statins significantly lower low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and reduce atheroma formation but are largely powerless against extensive calcification. Although investigations into the exact cause of extensive coronary calcification are in their infancy, early results suggest that it is sufficiently different in nature from atheroma formation to be considered as a separate condition. Further research would yield a greater understanding, which would aid management and the development of specific biomarkers to reduce the cost and radiation risk of CT scanning.",

The literature search was based on PubMed listings up to 26 November 2009. In most studies ezetimibe decreases the large and medium LDL subclasses and, to a lesser extent, the sdLDL particles, while it does not substantially influence LDL size. Fibrates and niacin reduce sdLDL particles and shift LDL size towards large, buoyant LDL particles. More studies are needed to elucidate the effects of fish oils and resins on LDL phenotype. Orlistat and rimonabant have been associated with reductions in sdLDL-C levels along with an increase in LDL particle size. We did not find any literature describing the effect of sibutramine on sdLDL profile. Treatment with fibrates and niacin seems to be beneficial in patients with mixed dyslipidaemia.

Psoriasis patients have an increased prevalence of atherosclerotic disease including coronary artery, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular diseases. The exact connection between psoriasis and atherosclerosis remains unclear, but it is thought that inflammation, which plays an important role in both diseases, may be the causative link. Nevertheless, psoriasis patients suffer from an increased burden of atherosclerotic disease and most commonly die from \"coronary artery disease\" (CAD). Psoriatic patients have an increased prevalence of CAD risk factors and an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI). One CAD risk factor in psoriasis patients that can easily be managed is \"hyperlipidemia.\" \"Statins\" are safe, cost-effective, and have been proven to be highly effective in preventing CAD, including MI, in patients with hyperlipidemia. Furthermore, in addition to their lipid lowering properties, statins have anti-inflammatory immunomodulator activities that may be beneficial in several autoimmune diseases including psoriasis. Considering the safety and cost-effectiveness of statins, we feel that it is worth investigating if statins can play a dual role in psoriasis by treating the increased atherosclerotic disease burden in these patients through their lipid lowering effects and by decreasing psoriatic disease activity through their anti-inflammatory immunomodulatory properties.",

The pharmacokinetic parameters of verapamil and norverapamil in rats were determined after the oral administration of verapamil (9 mg/kg) in the presence or absence of simvastatin (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg). The pharmacokinetics of verapamil were significantly altered by the coadministration of simvastatin compared with those in the control group (given verapamil alone). The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of verapamil were significantly increased (P < 0.05 at 0.3 mg/kg; P < 0.01 at 1.0 mg/kg) by simvastatin.

The AUC and Cmax of norverapamil were not significantly increased in the rats coadministered with simvastatin compared with those in the control group. Moreover, the metabolite-parent ratio (M.R.) of norverapamil were significantly decreased in rats coadministered with simvastatin. These results implied that simvastatin significantly enhanced the oral bioavailability of verapamil by inhibiting the CYP3A-mediated metabolism in small intestine or in the liver and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump in small intestine. Therefore, concurrent use of verapamil and simvastatin should be monitored closely to potential drug interactions for safe therapy of cardiovascular diseases.",

LDL and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) are commonly measured by their cholesterol content, but non-HDL cholesterol, LDL particle number (LDL-P), or total apolipoprotein B (apoB) may better predict cardiovascular risk. Few studies have examined relations among lipoprotein levels and composition before and after interventions to lower LDL-C and non-HDL-C. OBJECTIVE: To measure changes in carotid artery intimal media thickness (CIMT) and lipid concentration and composition during 36 months of statin therapy. METHODS: Analyses were conducted on 418 diabetic individuals, with complete data and no prior cardiovascular events, who were randomized to aggressive (AG) versus standard (STD) treatment for LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) as part of the Stop Atherosclerosis in Native Diabetics Study (SANDS). RESULTS: The AG group achieved average LDL-C and non-HDL-C of 71mg/dL and 100mg/dL and a decrease in CIMT. No significant interactions were observed between treatment effect and initial levels of LDL-C, non-HDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides, apoB, or LDL-P. Decreases in LDL-C (p<.005) and non-HDL-C (p<.001) were independently correlated with CIMT regression in the AG group. Changes in apoB and LDL-P showed borderline correlations with CIMT regression (p=.07 and p=.09). CONCLUSIONS: In diabetic adults with no prior cardiovascular events, treatment to current targets for lipids and SBP reduces atherosclerosis progression and when more aggressive targets are met, atherosclerosis regresses. The aggressive targets for LDL-C and non-HDL-C appeared to be the main determinants of CIMT regression and were more predictive of this outcome than changes in LDL-P or apoB.",

    "169": "Inflammatory pathways are involved in the development of atherosclerosis. Interaction of vessel wall cells and invading monocytes by cytokines may trigger local inflammatory processes. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are standard medications used in cardiovascular diseases. They are thought to have anti-inflammatory capacities, in addition to their lipid-lowering effects. We investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of statins in the cytokine-mediated-interaction-model of human vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) and human mononuclear cells (MNC). In this atherosclerosis-related inflammatory model LPS (lipopolysaccharide, endotoxin), as well as high mobility group box 1 stimulation resulted in synergistic (i.e. over-additive) IL-6 (interleukin-6) production as measured in ELISA. Recombinant IL-1, tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 and IL-6 mediated the synergistic IL-6 production. The standard anti-inflammatory drugs aspirin and indomethacin (Indo) reduced the synergistic IL-6 production by 60%. Simvastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin or pravastatin reduced the IL-6 production by 53%, 50%, 64% and 60%, respectively. The inhibition by the statins was dose dependent. Combination of statins with aspirin and/or Indo resulted in complete inhibition of the synergistic IL-6 production. The same inhibitors blocked STAT3 phosphorylation, providing evidence for an autocrine role of IL-6 in the synergism. MNC from volunteers after 5 day aspirin or simvastatin administration showed no decreased IL-6 production, probably due to drug removal during MNC isolation. Taken together, the data show that anti-inflammatory functions (here shown for statins) can be sensitively and reproducibly determined in this novel SMC/MNC coculture model. These data implicate that statins have the capacity to affect atherosclerosis by regulating cytokine-mediated innate inflammatory pathways in the vessel wall.",

The objective of this retrospective observational study was to examine statin medication usage patterns and the relationship with LDL-C goal levels (according to Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines) among a cohort of employees of a major financial services corporation. From 1995 to 2004, a total of 1607 executives participated in a periodic health examination program. An index date was assigned for each study participant (date of their exam) and statin medication usage was determined from the pharmacy claims database for 365 days before the index date. Patients were identified as adherent to statins if the medication possession ratio was > or =80%. In all, 150 (9.3%) executives filled at least 1 statin prescription in the 365 days prior to their exam. A total of 102 statin users (68%) were adherent to statin medication. Among all executives who received statin treatment, 70% (odds ratio [OR] = 2.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.82, 2.90) achieved near-optimal (<130 mg/dL) and 30% (OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.15, 2.76) achieved optimal (<100 mg/dL) LDL-C goals, which is significantly higher than the rates among statin nonusers (55% and 21%). Adherent statin users were more likely to achieve recommended near-optimal LDL-C goals compared to statin nonusers (overall P = 0.002; adherent: OR = 2.75, 95% CI = 1.662, 4.550), while nonadherent statin users were more likely to achieve the optimal goal compared to statin nonusers (OR = 2.223; CI = 1.145, 4.313).

In the face of the established lipid lowering and the emerging pleiotropic properties of statins, the patient population suitable for long-term statin treatment is expected to further expand. An overall positive safety and tolerability profile of statins has been established, although adverse events have been reported. Skeletal muscle-related events are the most common adverse events of statin treatment. Statin-induced myopathy can (rarely) manifest with severe and potentially fatal cases of rhabdomyolysis, thus rendering the identification of the underlying predisposing factors critical. The purpose of this review is to summarize the factors that increase the risk of statin-related myopathy. Data from published clinical trials, meta-analyses, postmarketing studies, spontaneous report systems and case reports for rare effects were reviewed. Briefly, the epidemiology, clinical spectrum and molecular mechanisms of statin-associated myopathy are discussed. We further analyse in detail the risk factors that precipitate or increase the likelihood of statin-related myopathy. Individual demographic features, genetic factors and co-morbidities that may account for the significant interindividual variability in the myopathic risk are presented. Physicochemical properties of statins have been implicated in the differential risk of currently marketed statins. Pharmacokinetic interactions with concomitant medications that interfere with statin metabolism and alter their systemic bioavailability are reviewed. Of particular clinical interest in cases of resistant dyslipidaemia is the interaction of statins with other classes of lipid-lowering agents; current data on the relative safety of available combinations are summarized. Finally, we provide an update of current guidelines for the prevention and management of statin myopathy. The identification of patients with an increased proclivity to statin-induced myopathy could allow more cost-effective approaches of monitoring and screening, facilitate targeted prevention of potential complications, and further improve the already overwhelmingly positive benefit-risk ratio of statins.",

TGF-beta1 induced phosphorylation of PI-3 kinase and Akt, while atorvastatin and wortmannin and Akt inhibitor X inhibited the phosphorylation of PI-3 kinase and Akt induced by TGF-beta1. The gel shift and promoter activity assay showed that TGF-beta1 increased Smad3/4-binding activity and endoglin promoter activity, while wortmannin and atorvastatin inhibited the Smad3/4-binding activity and endoglin promoter activity induced by TGF-beta1.

However, etidronate also reduced the ABRE of alendronate. The present study examined in mice the modulating effects of etidronate on the inflammatory and necrotic actions of zoledronate (the NBP with the strongest anti-bone-resorptive activity and the highest incidence of osteonecrosis of the jaw) and on ABREs of various NBPs including zoledronate.",

Lifestyle intervention is critical for treating MetS, while pharmacotherapy of dyslipidemia in MetS remains controversial. Considering the specific lipid profile in MetS, fibrates are typically used as first-line treatment. Nevertheless, first-line therapy should be directed towards LDL-C, even in people with MetS, because of the evidence that lowering LDL-C has cardioprotective effects. Non-HDL-C is considered to be an alternative treatment target for people with moderately or severely elevated triglyceride (> or =200mg/dl). Statins improve lipid profiles principally by lowering LDL-C and may exert anti-inflammatory and anti-atherothrombogenic effects, which ameliorate the fundamental pathophysiology of MetS. Fibrates also have pleiotropic effects that improve cardiometabolic risk factors, including insulin resistance, although they do not have clear cardioprotective effects. Omega-3 fatty acids, niacin, pioglitazone and anti-obesity drugs are also candidates for the treatment of dyslipidemia and other complications in MetS. Another question is whether statins in combination with fibrates or other lipid-lowering drugs has greater cardioprotective properties than monotherapy.

The current pandemic of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes is intimately associated with an atherogenic dyslipidemic phenotype featuring low HDL-C combined with elevated TG-rich lipoproteins and small dense LDL. In this context, there is renewed interest in pharmacotherapeutic strategies involving niacin and fibrates in monotherapy and in association with statins. This comprehensive, critical review of available data in dyslipidemic subjects indicates that niacin is more efficacious in raising HDL-C than fibrates, whereas niacin and fibrates reduce TG-rich lipoproteins and LDL comparably. Niacin is distinguished by its unique capacity to effectively lower Lp(a) levels. Several studies have demonstrated anti-atherosclerotic action for both niacin and fibrates. In contrast with statin therapy, the clinical benefit of fibrates appears limited to reduction of nonfatal myocardial infarction, whereas niacin (frequently associated with statins and/or other agents) exerts benefit across a wider range of cardiovascular endpoints in studies involving limited patient numbers. Clearly the future treatment of atherogenic dyslipidemias involving the lipid triad, as exemplified by the occurrence of the mixed dyslipidemic phenotype in metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, renal, and auto-immune diseases, requires integrated pharmacotherapy targeted not only to proatherogenic particles, notably VLDL, IDL, LDL, and Lp(a), but also to atheroprotective HDL.",

Myocardial perfusion reserve (ratio) changed from 1.64 +/- 0.90 to 1.30 +/- 0.37 in placebo-treated and from 1.51 +/- 0.18 to 1.55 +/- 0.34 in rosuvastatin-treated patients (p = NS). Metabolic mismatch changed from 4.25 +/- 2.37% to 4.38 +/- 3.81% in placebo-treated and from 5.13 +/- 2.75% to 3.50 +/- 2.73% in rosuvastatin-treated patients (p = NS). In conclusion, changes regarding myocardial perfusion and metabolic mismatch after 6 months of rosuvastatin treatment in patients with HF did not suggest any beneficial or adverse effects in this pilot study, although due to the small numbers of patients small effects might have been missed.", 
    "213": "The safety and efficacy of combination ezetimibe/simvastatin (E/S) plus extended-release niacin was assessed in 942 patients with type IIa/IIb hyperlipidemia for 64 weeks in a randomized, double-blind study. Patients received E/S (10/20 mg) plus niacin (to 2 g) or E/S (10/20 mg) for 64 weeks, or niacin (to 2 g) for 24 weeks and then E/S (10/20 mg) plus niacin (2 g) or E/S (10/20 mg) for an additional 40 weeks. The primary end point, the safety of E/S plus niacin, included prespecified adverse events (ie, liver, muscle, discontinuations due to flushing, gallbladder-related, cholecystectomy, fasting glucose changes, new-onset diabetes). The secondary end points included the percentage of change from baseline in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, non-HDL cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, other lipids, lipoprotein ratios and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. The anticipated niacin-associated flushing led to a greater rate of study discontinuations with the E/S plus niacin regimen than with E/S alone (0.7%, p <0.001). The rate of liver and muscle adverse events was low (<1%) in both groups. Four patients had gallbladder-related adverse events; 1 patient in the E/S and 1 in the E/S plus niacin group underwent cholecystectomy. The occurrence of new-onset diabetes was 3.1% for the E/S and 4.9% for the E/S plus niacin group. The fasting glucose levels increased to greater than baseline during the first 12 weeks (E/S, 3.2 mg/dl; E/S plus niacin, 7.7 mg/dl) and gradually decreased to pretreatment levels by 64 weeks in both groups. E/S plus niacin significantly improved HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, non-HDL cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and A-I, and lipoprotein ratios compared with E/S (p <or=0.004). The changes in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were comparable for both groups. In conclusion, the combination of E/S plus niacin was generally well tolerated, aside from niacin-associated flushing, and was significantly superior to E/S alone in improving several lipoprotein parameters during a 64-week trial in patients with hyperlipidemia. E/S plus niacin provided a broad, lipid-altering therapeutic option for these patients, even in the presence of diabetes with glucose monitoring.",

    "215": "We assessed the association of statin treatment and serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations with small AAA expansion. Six hundred fifty-two patients undergoing surveillance of small AAAs were entered into the study from 5 vascular centers. In a subset, fasting lipids (n = 451) and other biomarkers (n = 216) were measured. The AAA diameter was followed by ultrasound surveillance for a median of 5 years.", 
    "216": "Three hundred forty-nine (54%) of the patients were prescribed statins. Adjusting for other risk factors, statin prescription was not associated with AAA growth (odds ratio [OR] 1.23, 95% CI 0.86-1.76). Above-median AAA growth was positively associated with initial diameter (OR 1.78 per 4.35-mm-larger initial aortic diameter, 95% CI 1.49-2.14) and negatively associated with diabetes (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22-0.62). Above-median serum LDL concentration was not associated with AAA growth. Patients receiving statins had lower serum C-reactive protein concentrations but similar matrix metalloproteinase-9 and interleukin-6 concentrations to those not prescribed these medications.", 
    "217": "We found no association between statin prescription or LDL concentration with AAA expansion. The results do not support the findings of smaller studies and suggest that statins may have no benefit in reducing AAA progression.",

This post hoc analysis reports lipid efficacy results in patients grouped by diagnosis of T2DM, MetS without T2DM or neither. Per cent change from baseline at week 6 was assessed for LDL-C, total cholesterol, HDL-C , non-HDL-C , Apo A-I, Apo B and triglycerides. Safety was monitored through clinical and laboratory adverse events (AEs).", 
    "220": "Compared with doubling atorvastatin, atorvastatin plus ezetimibe resulted in greater reductions in LDL-C, triglycerides, Apo B, non-HDL-C, total cholesterol and lipid ratios in the T2DM, MetS and neither groups. Treatment effects were of similar magnitude across patient groups with both treatments, except triglycerides, which were slightly greater in the T2DM and MetS groups vs. neither group. Changes in HDL-C , Apo A-I and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were comparable for both treatments in all three groups. Safety and tolerability profiles were generally similar between treatments and across patient groups, as were the incidence of liver and muscle AEs.", 
    "221": "Compared with doubling atorvastatin to 80 mg, addition of ezetimibe to atorvastatin 40 mg produced greater improvements in multiple lipid parameters in high-CHD risk patients with T2DM, MetS or neither, consistent with the significantly greater changes observed in the full study cohort (clinical trial # NCT00276484).",

    "226": "Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease that results in bone resorption creating bony defects, which may cause tooth loss. Various drugs have been studied using local delivery to improve the periodontal health and to achieve periodontal regeneration. Simvastatin (SMV) is a specific competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-2-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase. The present study was designed to investigate the effectiveness of SMV, 1.2 mg, in an indigenously prepared biodegradable controlled-release gel as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) in the treatment of chronic periodontitis.", 
    "227": "Sixty patients were categorized into two treatment groups: SRP plus placebo (group 1) and SRP plus SMV, 1.2 mg (group 2). Clinical parameters were recorded at baseline before SRP and at 1, 2, 4, and 6 months; they included modified sulcus bleeding index (mSBI), probing depth (PD), and clinical attachment level (CAL). At baseline and after 6 months, radiologic assessment of intrabony defect (IBD) fill was done using computer-aided software. The mean concentration of SMV in gingival crevicular fluid was estimated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography.", 
    "228": "All subjects tolerated the drug, without any postapplication inflammation. Both therapies resulted in significant improvements. The decrease in mSBI score at 6 months was greater in group 2 (2.3267 +/- 0.8017) compared to group 1 (0.5033 +/- 0.6815). The mean decrease in PD from baseline to 6 months was 1.20 +/- 1.24 mm and 4.26 +/- 1.59 mm in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Mean CAL gain from baseline to 6 months was 1.63 +/- 1.99 mm and 4.36 +/- 1.92 mm in groups 1 and 2, respectively.

    "230": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important intracellular signaling molecules and are implicated in cardioprotective pathways including ischemic preconditioning. Statins have been shown to have cardioprotective effects against ischemia/reperfusion injury, however, the precise mechanisms remain to be elucidated. We hypothesized that ROS-mediated signaling cascade may be involved in pravastatin-induced cardioprotection. Cultured rat cardiomyocytes were exposed to H(2)O(2) for 30 min to induce cell injury. Pravastatin significantly suppressed H(2)O(2)-induced cell death evaluated by propidium iodide staining and the MTT assay. Incubation with pravastatin activated catalase, and prevented a ROS burst induced by H(2)O(2), which preserved mitochondrial membrane potential. Protective effects were induced very rapidly within 10 min, which was concordant with the up-regulation of phosphorylated ERK1/2. L-NAME, 5HD, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and staurosporine inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation and also reduced pravastatin-induced cardioprotection, suggesting NO, mitochondrial K(ATP) (mitoK(ATP)) channels, ROS and PKC should be involved in the cardioprotective signaling. We also demonstrated that pravastatin moderately up-regulated ROS generation in a 5HD-inhibitable manner. In isolated perfused rat heart experiments, pravastatin administered 10 min prior to no-flow global ischemia significantly improved left ventricular functional recovery, and also reduced infarct size, which were attenuated by the treatment with NAC, 5HD, L-NAME or staurosporine. Administration of pravastatin from the beginning of reperfusion also conferred cardioprotection. Pravastatin protected the cardiomyocytes against oxidative stress by preventing the ROS burst and preserving mitochondrial function. Moderately up-regulated ROS production by mitoK(ATP) channels opening is involved in the pro-survival signaling cascade activated by pravastatin.", 
    "231": "Despite an increasing body of evidence on the benefit of lowering elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), there is still considerable concern that patients are not achieving target LDL-C levels.", 
    "232": "The CANadians Achieve Cholesterol Targets Fast with Atorvastatin Stratified Titration (CanACTFAST) trial tested whether an algorithm-based statin dosing approach would enable patients to achieve LDL-C and total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TC/HDL-C) ratio targets quickly.", 
    "233": "Subjects requiring statin therapy, but with an LDL-C level of 5.7 mmol/L or lower, and triglycerides of 6.8 mmol/L or lower at screening participated in the 12-week study, which had two open-label, six-week phases: a treatment period during which patients received 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg or 80 mg of atorvastatin based on an algorithm incorporating baseline LDL-C value and cardiovascular risk; and patients who achieved both LDL-C and TC/HDL-C ratio targets at six weeks continued on the same atorvastatin dose. Patients who did not achieve both targets received dose uptitration using a single-step titration regimen. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients achieving target LDL-C levels after 12 weeks.",
