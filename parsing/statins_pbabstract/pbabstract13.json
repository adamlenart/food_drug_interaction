However, statin clinical trials have shown marginally significant benefits on mortality, especially in the primary prevention setting. A major limitation of those trials is their relatively short follow-up. A reduced number of fatal events within a 5-year follow-up make mortality benefits unlikely to arise. This is particularly relevant for the primary prevention trials, where the risk of cardiovascular death is low. The short follow-up is a limitation for safety assessments too. However, extended major statin trials failed to detect any major safety concerns. Safety and efficacy assessments are even more complicated considering the differences of cardiovascular risk status in primary prevention individuals, and also given some potential ethnic and inter-individual genetic variations in response to statin treatment. Considerable evidence suggests a favourable risk-benefit balance for statin treatment. It can be assumed that statins reduce mortality in the long term by preventing cardiovascular events with complications that reduce lifespan. Unfortunately, this hypothesis cannot be proven as there is no current ethical basis on designing long-term placebo-controlled statin trials. Nevertheless, by effectively reducing disabilities related to cardiovascular events, statins have major benefits for public health. Therefore, clinicians should not withhold statin treatment awaiting proof of mortality benefits, as this may remain an 'untold story'.",

Very high serum creatine kinase levels are usually detected. HMGCR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarylcoenzyme A reductase) is a pharmacological target of statins and the fact that patients develop autoantibodies against the enzyme suggests a possible effect of statins in induction of HMGCR antigenicity.

Since most observational studies found a positive association between these two complications, a causal relationship has been assumed. If so, this would render VC a target of therapy. Recent studies, however, suggested this assumption might be an oversimplification. The fundamental aspects of these recent studies are two-fold. The first novel insight is that VC is not a single entity. VC can be the consequence of a wide range of different biological processes, but also of pharmacological interventions. Sometimes it is the underlying process that carries the additional risk, and sometimes it is tissue calcification itself. Both calcium-containing phosphate binders and statin therapy are associated with an increase in VC, but with divergent effects on cardiovascular risk. Moreover, VC can have different anatomical and histological locations. The second novel insight is that the assumption of a straightforward linear association between the amount of VC and risk for\u00a0clinical events can be challenged. In this review we\u00a0summarize recent literature that should lead to reconsidering the implications of VC in CKD.

Thus, total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were measured in serum, while reactive oxygen species (ROS), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutayl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activities were measured in the hepatic tissue. In addition, seric concentrations of \u03b2-caryophyllene were measured to perform correlation studies. Serum samples from hypercholesterolemic rats show higher (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL cholesterol, and lower (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) levels of HDL cholesterol compared to non-hypercholesterolemic rats. \u03b2-Caryophyllene treatment reduced (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) the levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL cholesterol, similar to the reference drug simvastatin. However, HDL cholesterol levels did not increase with the treatment. \u03b2-Caryophyllene treatment was able to inhibit the HMG-CoA reductase activity, as well as to prevent the increase on ROS and TBARS levels, and ameliorate the antioxidant system. In summary, our findings demonstrated that \u03b2-caryophyllene has hypolipidemic effect via inhibition of the hepatic HMG-CoA reductase, like the standard drug simvastatin, and this inhibition suggests a possible mechanism of hypolipidemic action. Thus, our results indicate that \u03b2-caryophyllene can be used to treat dyslipidemic diseases because it exerts a similar effect as the reference drug, protecting the liver against lipid damage and improving the hepatic antioxidant defense system.",

Platelet samples were incubated with atorvastatin (10(-7\u2009)mol/L, 10(-6\u2009)mol/L or 10(-5\u2009)mol/L), and stimulated with ADP (10\u2009\u00b5mol/L), arachidonic acid (0.5\u2009mmol/L), collagen (2\u2009\u00b5g/mL), and epinephrine (1\u2009mg/mL). The maximal amplitude of aggregation and the curve slope were measured by electric impedance aggregometry. Results Atorvastatin inhibited platelet aggregation at moderate (300\u2009\u00d7\u200910(9)/L) and high (600\u2009\u00d7\u200910(9)/L) concentrations. However, an inhibitory effect of atorvastatin at low concentrations (100\u2009\u00d7\u200910(9)/L) was not observed. Conclusions The study shows that atorvastatin inhibits platelet aggregation in\u00a0vitro, and this inhibitory effect is related to platelet concentrations.",

We aimed to assess the impact of concomitant CYP3A4-metabolized statin and clopidogrel use on antiplatelet activity and clinical outcomes in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We enrolled 1187 patients from the HOST-ASSURE trial with platelet reactivity unit (PRU) values at both baseline and 1 month.

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of the HDL-associated Taq1B (rs708272) SNP of cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) gene on serum LDL subfractions in patients with CHD. Serum lipid levels were measured enzymatically and LDL subfraction analysis was carried out by the Lipoprint System (Quantimetrix, CA, USA). The CETP rs708272 SNP was studied in 66 healthy controls and 79 patients with CHD receiving statin therapy by the PCR-RFLP technique. The CHD patients had elevated antiatherogenic LDL-1 subfraction (p\u00a0=\u00a00.042), decreased atherogenic IDL-C subfraction (p\u00a0=\u00a00.023), and total IDL (p\u00a0=\u00a00.030) levels compared to the healthy controls. The CETP rs708272 Taq1B minor B2 allele was associated with increased levels of antiatherogenic LDL-1 (B2: 0.40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.20 vs. B1B1: 0.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.08, p\u00a0=\u00a00.004) and large-LDL (LDL 1-2) subfractions in the CHD group (B2 allele: 0.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.41 vs. B1B1: 0.42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.20; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), while it was associated with reduced levels of the large-LDL subfraction in healthy subjects (B2 allele: 0.29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.14 vs. B1B1: 0.54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.24; p\u00a0=\u00a00.017). However, there was no statistically significant association between the CETP rs708272 SNP and small dense LDL subfraction (LDL 3-7) and lipoprotein levels (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Our findings have indicated that the CETP rs708272 SNP together with statin therapy may show a favorable effect on antiatherogenic LDL-1 and large-LDL subfractions in CHD patients with an atherogenic effect on large-LDL subfraction in healthy subjects. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the effects of the CETP variation on LDL subfraction could change in cardiometabolic events such as CHD and statin therapy.",

Circulating miR-122 was associated with prevalent insulin resistance, obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and an adverse lipid profile. Among 92 plasma proteins and 135 lipid subspecies quantified with mass spectrometry, it correlated inversely with zinc-\u03b1-2-glycoprotein and positively with afamin, complement factor H, VLDL-associated apolipoproteins, and lipid subspecies containing monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids. Proteomics analysis of livers from antagomiR-122-treated mice revealed novel regulators of hepatic lipid metabolism that are responsive to miR-122 inhibition. In the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT, n = 155), 12-month atorvastatin reduced circulating miR-122. A similar response to atorvastatin was observed in mice and cultured murine hepatocytes.

SAMS encompass a broad spectrum of clinical presentations, including mild muscular aching and other types of myalgias, myopathy with the significant elevation of creatine kinase, and the rare but life-threatening rhabdomyolysis. Among several pathophysiologic mechanisms of SAMS, mitochondrial dysfunction is thought to be one of the main one. Curcumin is the polyphenolic ingredient of Curcuma longa L., which has various pharmacological properties against a vast range of diseases. Curcumin has several mechanisms of actions relevant to the treatment of SAMS. These effects include the capacity to prevent and reduce delayed onset muscle soreness by blocking the nuclear factor inflammatory pathway, attenuation of muscular atrophy, enhancement of muscle fibre regeneration following injury, and analgesic and antioxidant effects. Curcumin can also increase the levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate, which leads to an increase in the number of mitochondrial DNA duplicates in skeletal muscle cells. Finally, owing to its essential lipid-modifying properties, curcumin might serve as an adjunct to statin therapy in patients with SAMS, allowing for effective lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and possibly for statin dose reduction. Owing to the paucity of effective treatments, and the safety of curcumin in clinical practice, proof-of-concept trials are recommended to assess the potential benefit of this phytochemical in the treatment of SAMS.",

However, its mechanism for LDL-C lowering, efficacy in models of atherosclerosis and relevance in humans are unknown. Here we show that ETC-1002 is a prodrug that requires activation by very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase-1 (ACSVL1) to modulate both targets, and that inhibition of ACL leads to LDL receptor upregulation, decreased LDL-C and attenuation of atherosclerosis, independently of AMPK. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the absence of ACSVL1 in skeletal muscle provides a mechanistic basis for ETC-1002 to potentially avoid the myotoxicity associated with statin therapy.",

Statin monotherapy patients who reduced TG by \u226530% also had a large reduction in adjusted costs (-$1,079). In conclusion, we found a substantial economic benefit to treating diabetic patients with statin/TG-specific combination lipid therapy compared with monotherapy of either type or no lipid pharmacotherapy. A TG reduction of \u226530% produced a particularly large reduction in 1-year medical costs.", 
    "150": "Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPW) and targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) are relatively new methods proposed for estimating marginal causal effects. TMLE is doubly robust, yielding consistent estimators even under misspecification of either the treatment or the outcome model. While IPW methods are known to be sensitive to near violations of the practical positivity assumption (e.\u2009g., in the case of data sparsity), the consequences of this violation in the TMLE framework for binary outcomes have been less widely investigated. As near practical positivity violations are particularly likely in high-dimensional covariate settings, a better understanding of the performance of TMLE is of particular interest for pharmcoepidemiological studies using large databases. Using plasmode and Monte-Carlo simulation studies, we evaluated the performance of TMLE compared to that of IPW estimators based on a point-exposure cohort study of the marginal causal effect of post-myocardial infarction statin use on the 1-year risk of all-cause mortality from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. A variety of treatment model specifications were considered, inducing different degrees of near practical non-positivity. Our simulation study showed that the performance of the TMLE and IPW estimators were comparable when the dimension of the fitted treatment model was small to moderate; however, they differed when a large number of covariates was considered. When a rich outcome model was included in the TMLE, estimators were unbiased. In some cases, we found irregular bias and large standard errors with both methods even with a correctly specified high-dimensional treatment model. The IPW estimator showed a slightly better root MSE with high-dimensional treatment model specifications in our simulation setting. In conclusion, for estimation of the marginal expectation of the outcome under a fixed treatment, TMLE and IPW estimators employing the same treatment model specification may perform differently due to differential sensitivity to practical positivity violations; however, TMLE, being doubly robust, shows improved performance with richer specifications of the outcome model. Although TMLE is appealing for its double robustness property, such violations in a high-dimensional covariate setting are problematic for both methods.", 
    "151": "Large-scale randomised controlled trials, carried out in the context of secondary cardiovascular prevention, have shown that statins are superior to placebo: these drugs were shown to decrease cardiovascular events and total mortality. A further set of clinical trials compared high intensity to low/standard intensity LDL cholesterol lowering in the same setting (using either statins or a statin/ezetimibe association). In this case, a decrease in LDL cholesterol and a concomitant significant reduction in cardiovascular events were seen with intensive therapy, however with no change in total mortality. This phenomenon we may term the LDL cholesterol mortality paradox. It could be due either to the prevention (by high-intensity therapy) of episodes not severe enough to lead to the death of patients, or to high-intensity therapy leading to the death of some patients at the same time as preventing the death of others, with a null aggregate effect. Several types of adverse effects have been seen with statin therapy, such as a possible increased incidence of Diabetes mellitus and of myopathy. The decision to start high-intensity LDL cholesterol lowering (rather than low- or moderate-intensity statin treatment) should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the overall aspects of each patient, including the patient's preferences. High-intensity LDL cholesterol lowering, up to the present moment, has failed to produce a change in overall prognosis (total mortality), and should not therefore be mandatory in secondary cardiovascular prevention. It remains to be seen if a similar LDL cholesterol mortality paradox occurs with new drugs targeting plasma lipids.", 
    "152": "PCSK9 is a protease, synthesized mainly in the liver, which promotes the hepatic degradation of the LDL receptor and consequently decreases LDL receptor density and clearance of LDL particles. Statins inhibit HMG-CoA-reductase activity, an enzyme that catalyses an important step in hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis. The decrease of the hepatic intracellular cholesterol pool produced by these drugs upregulates the activity of the SREBP2 transcription factor, which subsequently stimulates the expression of the LDL receptor gene, an effect that is followed by an increase in the serum concentration of PCSK9. This article aims to review the effects of different lipid-lowering drugs on plasma PCSK9 concentrations. Overall, statins increase blood PCSK9 levels, an effect that is enhanced by ezetimibe. In contrast, others drugs, such as fibrates and niacin, could decrease PCSK9 levels.",

These patients include persons with statin intolerance and those with very high LDL cholesterol (LDLc) levels such as persons with familial hypercholesterolemia. The proportion of statin-intolerant patients is between 7% and 29%. Alternative lipid-lowering drugs (including ezetimibe) are less effective and are not free from adverse effects. Both alirocumab, with the ODYSSEY ALTERNATIVE study, and evolocumab, with the GAUSS study, have shown strong lipid-lowering efficacy, with much greater tolerability than currently available alternatives, with the result that a larger number of patients achieve therapeutic targets. In familial hypercholesterolemia, the monogenic metabolic disease most frequently associated with high cardiovascular risk, early intervention is cost-effective. Although statins have substantially improved the prognosis of familial hypercholesterolemia, many affected individuals are far from achieving the recommended therapeutic targets. In this patient group, PCSK9 inhibition with monoclonal antibodies has also been shown to be highly effective in reducing LDLc, especially in heterozygous individuals. The studies performed to date have shown that these drugs are safe and effective and can help many patients with familial hypercholesterolemia to drastically reduce their cardiovascular risk.",

Cholesterol biosynthesis follows a circadian rhythm and is principally produced at night (between 12:00 am and 6:00 am).

Chronotherapy is based on the idea that medication can have different effects depending on the hour at which it is taken. Statins are one of the most widely used drugs for the prevention of cardiovascular events.

Using the GRADE approach, we assessed the quality of the evidence and we used the GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool to import data from Review Manager to create 'Summary of findings' tables.", 
    "159": "This review includes eight RCTs (767 participants analysed in morning and evening arms). The trials used different lipid-lowering regimens with statins (lovastatin: two trials; simvastatin: three trials; fluvastatin: two trials; pravastatin: one trial). All trials compared the effects between morning and evening statin administration. Trial length ranged from four to 14 weeks. We found a high risk of bias in the domain of selective reporting in three trials and in the domain of incomplete outcome data in one trial of the eight trials included. None of the studies included were judged to be at low risk of bias.None of the included RCTs reported data on cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, incidence of cardiovascular events, or deaths from any cause. Pooled results showed no evidence of a difference in total cholesterol (MD 4.33, 95% CI -1.36 to 10.01), 514 participants, five trials, mean follow-up 9 weeks, low-quality evidence), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (MD 4.85 mg/dL, 95% CI -0.87 to 10.57, 473 participants, five trials, mean follow-up 9 weeks, low-quality evidence), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (MD 0.54, 95% CI -1.08 to 2.17, 514 participants, five trials, mean follow-up 9 weeks, low-quality evidence) or triglycerides (MD -8.91, 95% CI -22 to 4.17, 510 participants, five trials, mean follow-up 9 weeks, low-quality evidence) between morning and evening statin administration.With regard to safety outcomes, five trials (556 participants) reported adverse events. Pooled analysis found no differences in statins adverse events between morning and evening intake (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.15, 556 participants, five trials, mean follow-up 9 weeks, low-quality evidence).", 
    "160": "Limited and low-quality evidence suggested that there were no differences between chronomodulated treatment with statins in people with hyperlipidaemia as compared to conventional treatment with statins, in terms of clinically relevant outcomes. Studies were short term and therefore did not report on our primary outcomes, cardiovascular clinical events or death. The review did not find differences in adverse events associated with statins between both regimens. Taking statins in the evening does not have an effect on the improvement of lipid levels with respect to morning administration. Further high-quality trials with longer-term follow-up are needed to confirm the results of this review.", 
    "161": "Our meta-analysis assessed the efficacy of statins on the risk of fracture, bone mineral density (BMD), and the markers of bone metabolism by collecting data from 33 clinical trials. We found that statin treatment was associated with bone metabolism. And statins seemed to be more effective on male patients with osteoporosis. The efficacy of statins for the treatment of osteoporosis has been controversial in previous studies and meta-analyses. Our meta-analysis was conducted to examine in detail the efficacy of statins on osteoporosis. We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases for clinical trials from inception to May 2016. We included studies that described the effect of statins on the risk of fracture, BMD, or bone turnover markers. Moreover, we also conducted subgroup analyses according to the skeleton site, patient gender, and length of follow-up. A total of 33 studies which included 23 observational studies (16 cohort studies and 7 case-control studies) and 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were evaluated. These 33 studies included 314,473 patients in statin group and 1,349,192 patients in control group. Statins decreased the risk of overall fractures (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.81, 95% CI 0.73-0.89) and hip fractures (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.75, 95% CI 0.60-0.92). Furthermore, the use of statins was associated with increased BMD at the total hip (standardized mean difference (SMD)\u00a0=\u00a00.18, 95% CI 0.00-0.36) and lumbar spine (SMD\u00a0=\u00a00.20, 95% CI 0.07-0.32) and improved the bone formation marker, osteocalcin (OC) (SMD\u00a0=\u00a00.21, 95% CI 0.00-0.42). However, there was no positive effect on vertebral fractures, upper extremity fractures, BMD at the femoral neck, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP), and serum C-terminal peptide of type I collagen (S-CTX). Also, compared with male subgroups, the effect on female subgroups was only slightly positive or of no statistical significance. Our meta-analysis indicates that statin treatment may be associated with a decreased risk of overall fractures and hip fractures, an increased BMD at the total hip, BMD at the lumbar spine, and OC. Moreover, our results also show that statin treatment may have a greater effect on male patients than on female patients.", 
    "162": "Overexpression of the HER2 oncogene contributes to tumor angiogenesis, which is an essential hallmark of cancer. Simvastatin has been reported to exhibit antitumor activities in several cancers; however, its roles and molecular mechanismsin the regulation of colorectal angiogenesis remain to be clarified. Here, we show that colon cancer cells express high levels of VEGF, total HER2 and phosphorylated HER2, and simvastatin apparently decreased their expression in HER2-overexpressing colon cancer cells. Simvastatin pretreatment reduced endothelial tube formation in vitro and microvessel density in vivo. Furthermore, simvastatin markedly inhibited tumor angiogenesis even in the presence of heregulin (HRG)-\u03b21 (a HER2 co-activator) pretreatment in HER2+ tumor cells. Mechanistic investigation showed that simvastatin significantly abrogated HER2-induced tumor angiogenesis by inhibiting VEGF secretion. Together, these results provide a novel mechanism underlying the simvastatin-induced inhibition of tumor angiogenesis through regulating HER2/VEGF axis.", 
    "163": "A recent analysis of a commercially insured US population found fewer cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in high-risk patients attaining low levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), as measured by LDL particle number (LDL-P) versus low LDL cholesterol (LDL-C). Here, we investigated the cost effectiveness of LDL-lowering therapy guided by LDL-P. Patients were selected from the HealthCore Integrated Research Database and followed for 12 to 36\u00a0months. Patients who achieved LDL-P <1,000\u00a0nmol/l were placed into the LDL-P cohort, whereas those without LDL-P tests, but who achieved LDL-C <100\u00a0mg/dl, were placed into the LDL-C cohort. CVD-related costs included all health plan paid amounts related to CVD events or lipid management. Cost effectiveness was assessed through incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, defined as difference in total costs across the cohorts divided by difference in CVD events, measured over follow-up. Each cohort included 2,094, 1,242, and 705 patients over 12-, 24-, and 36-month follow-up. Patients in the LDL-P cohort received more aggressive lipid-lowering therapy and had fewer CVD events during follow-up compared to patients in the LDL-C cohort. This led to greater pharmacy costs and lower medical costs over time. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio estimates ranged from $23,131 per CVD event avoided at 12\u00a0months to $3,439 and\u00a0-$4,555 at 24- and 36-month follow-up, suggesting a high likelihood that achieving LDL-P <1,000\u00a0nmol/l is cost effective. In conclusion, LDL-lowering therapy guided by LDL-P was demonstrated to be cost effective, with greater clinical and economic benefit seen over longer time horizons and with the increased use of generic statins.",

    "168": "Large randomized controlled trials have not confirmed the effects of statin therapy on reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in end-stage kidney disease, despite that statins are still widely prescribed by nephrologists to chronic dialysis patients. The aim of the study was to analyze the attitudes of nephrologists towards statin use in hemodialysis patients. Self-designed questionnaire, containing 18 questions, was distributed among 115 nephrologists. The survey contained description of the results of 3 largest statin trials in nephrology. The questions referred to the interpretation of trial results and the safety and efficacy of statin therapy and dose adjustments required in dialysis patients. 83% among 72 nephrologists who returned the questionnaire prescribed statins to their dialysis patients for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. 90% prescribed atorvastatin. 64% nephrologists did not modify statin dose at the start of hemodialysis treatment and 47% before elective surgery. Liver disease was indicated as a main reason for dose modification in hemodialysis patients. Statin-induced myopathy was observed by 65% nephrologists and 61% reported a case of increased liver enzymes. 51% of nephrologists did not routinely discuss the possible benefits and risks of statin therapy with their patients. Statins are still widely prescribed and considered safe and effective lipid-lowering therapy in dialysis patients by most nephrologists.", 
    "169": "The current study designed to clarify the mechanism of paraquat-induced cytotoxicity and protective effects of Atorvastatin on freshly isolated alveolar macrophages (AMs). AMs were collected via bronchoalveolar lavage and exposed to various concentrations of paraquat in the presence and absence of atorvastatin for 24h. Cell viability, myeloperoxidase activity; nitric oxide generation and total antioxidant capacity were assessed. Expression of TLR-4 at mRNA and protein levels were studied by using PCR and western blot methods Atorvastatin enhanced the paraquat-reduced cell viability and reduced the paraquat-induced myeloperoxidase activity and nitric oxide production. Moreover, atorvastatin down-regulated by 60% the paraquat up-regulated expression of TLR-4 at protein and mRNA level. Our results suggest that, AMs in vitro model could be a novel cytological tool for studies on paraquat poisoning and therapy regimens. Additionally, atorvastatin cytoprotective effects on paraquat-induced cytotoxicity partly attribute to its anti-myeloperoxidase, antioxidant properties, which might be regulated via TLR-4 expression.", 
    "170": "Background. High HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) values are negatively correlated with cardiovascular diseases. This review analyses the effect of the supplementation with various Mediterranean diet products (artichoke, bergamot, and olive oil) and Asian diet products (red yeast rice) on the HDL-C value in dyslipidemic subjects. Methods. A systematic review has been done involving all the English written studies published from the 1st of January 1958 to the 31st of March 2016. Results. The results of this systematic review indicate that the dietary supplementation with red yeast rice, bergamot, artichoke, and virgin olive oil has promising effects on the increase of HDL-C serum levels. The artichoke leaf extract and virgin olive oil appear to be particularly interesting, while bergamot extract needs further research and the effect of red yeast rice seems to be limited to patients with previous myocardial infarction. Conclusions. Various MediterrAsian diet products or natural extracts may represent a potential intervention treatment to raise HDL-C in dyslipidemic subjects.",

    "172": "A prospective, pilot study of the Statin Choice decision aid in two teaching hospitals in Northern China was conducted. A total of seven clinicians were enrolled and underwent a 12-hour, group-based, in-person training on shared decision making (SDM) and the Statin Choice decision aid. Then, these clinicians used the Statin Choice decision aid in patients during a clinical encounter. A total of 86 patients aged 40-80 years, who had stable angina, were enrolled. All clinical encounters were video recorded. A team of three researchers viewed and scored all the encounter recordings to evaluate the SDM process and fidelity to the intervention using the OPTION scale and Fidelity scale, respectively. All the patients were followed up for 12 months to record adherence to statin and any major adverse cardiac events (MACEs).", 
    "173": "The average scores on the OPTION normalized score and Fidelity scale were 21 (range, 3-32; out of a possible, 48) and 10 (range, 6-10; out of a possible, 10), respectively. This suggested that Chinese clinicians who were using Statin Choice in their patients were able to exhibit behaviors consistent with SDM at a level that is similar to that reported in Western countries. After SDM, the statin adherence was 94.5% (69/73), and the proportion of MACEs was 2.9% (2/69).", 
    "174": "Using an encounter decision aid developed in the US, it was feasible to implement SDM in a referral cardiology practice in Mainland China. Further work to ensure that the encounter aid is pertinent to the Chinese population and that SDM is tested in at-risk patients could contribute to the implementation of SDM across Mainland China.", 
    "175": "The use of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk to personalize systolic blood pressure (SBP) treatment goals is a topic of increasing interest. Therefore, we studied whether coronary artery calcium (CAC) can further guide the allocation of anti-hypertensive treatment intensity.",

Within subgroups categorized by both SBP (120-139 mm\u2009Hg, 140-159 mm\u2009Hg, and 160-179 mm\u2009Hg) and estimated 10-year ASCVD risk (using the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Assocation pooled-cohort equations), we compared multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for the composite outcome of incident ASCVD or heart failure after further stratifying by CAC (0, 1-100, or >100). We estimated 10-year number-needed-to-treat for an intensive SBP goal of 120 mm\u2009Hg by applying the treatment benefit recorded in meta-analyses to event rates within CAC strata.", 
    "177": "The mean age was 65 years, and 642 composite events took place over a median of 10.2 years. In persons with SBP <160 mm\u2009Hg, CAC stratified risk for events. For example, among those with an ASCVD risk of <15% and who had an SBP of either 120 to 139 mm\u2009Hg or 140 to 159 mm\u2009Hg, respectively, we found increasing hazard ratios for events with CAC 1 to 100 (1.7 [95% confidence interval, 1.0-2.6] or 2.0 [1.1-3.8]) and CAC >100 (3.0 [1.8-5.0] or 5.7 [2.9-11.0]), all relative to CAC=0. There appeared to be no statistical association between CAC and events when SBP was 160 to 179 mm Hg, irrespective of ASCVD risk level. Estimated 10-year number-needed-to-treat for a SBP goal of 120mmHg varied substantially according to CAC levels when predicted ASCVD risk <15% and SBP <160mmHg (eg, 10-year number-needed-to-treat of 99 for CAC=0 and 24 for CAC>100, when SBP 120-139mm\u2009Hg). However, few participants with ASCVD risk <5% had elevated CAC. Furthermore, 10-year number-needed-to-treat estimates were consistently low and varied less among CAC strata when SBP was 160 to 179 mm\u2009Hg or when ASCVD risk was \u226515% at any SBP level.",

    "179": "Chronic subdural haematoma (CSDH) is a common neurosurgical condition. Burr-hole for drainage is an effective treatment. However, recurrence can be up to 8-33% and is associated with morbidities and mortalities. The underlying pathogenesis was postulated to be localised inflammation and pathological aberrant vessels formation. Atorvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, is a type of lipid-lowering medication. In animal studies and a preliminary clinical trial, Atorvastatin was shown to be effective in the treatment of CSDH. It was found to inhibit inflammation and promote vascular maturation at the neomembrane of CSDH. Our study aimed to investigate the efficacy of Atorvastatin in CSDH. During the study period from January to December 2014, Atorvastatin was used in 12 CSDH patients with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 13-15 or Markwalder's Grading Scale (MGS) Grade 0-2. They were retrospectively compared with GCS- and MGS-matched controls who had not used statin. Improvement with haematoma resolution at 3 months was 75% (9/12) for the Atorvastatin group, versus 42% (5/12) for the Control group (p\u2009=\u20090.0977). The risk of deterioration requiring burr-hole drainage was 16.7% (2/12) in the Atorvastatin group, versus 58.3% (7/12) in the Control group (p\u2009=\u20090.0447). The Odds Ratio (OR) of deterioration requiring burr-hole drainage with Atorvastatin was 0.143 (95%CI: 0.021-0.958), which favours the use of Atorvastatin in CSDH (p\u2009=\u20090.0451). The Number needed to treat (NNT) was 2.4 (p\u2009=\u20090.0447; 95%CI: 1.31-14.93).

The occurrence of SAMS can have a major negative impact on treatment adherence and, consequently, on the prognosis of cardiovascular diseases. In addition, both the ESC guidelines on the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in clinical practice with sections addressing global strategies to minimise the burden of CVD at population and individual levels, and the 2016 ESC/EAS guideline for the management of dyslipidaemias, focus on evaluation and treatment of SAMS. The release of these guidelines was a source of great interest to clinicians, as new emergent therapies, such as the PCSK9 inhibitors, have been approved for the treatment of dyslipidaemias: recently, both the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the use of PCSK9 inhibitors as add-ons for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia in cases where low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) target levels could not be reached with maximum tolerated statin doses alone, or instead of statins in the event of SAMS. Because of the relatively high cost of these new therapies, physicians need to justify the use of PCSK9 inhibitors by demonstrating that their high-risk patients' LDL-C levels have remained high (1) despite a well-conducted, but insufficiently effective high-intensity statin therapy (e.g. rosuvastatin 10-20 mg or atorvastatin 40-80 mg), or (2) in the event of the patient developing side effects, in particular severe SAMS, during treatment with at least three statins. In addition to SAMS, the use of PCSK9 inhibitors may be considered in patients with documented atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or in patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia and poorly controlled LDL-C under the combination of maximum tolerated stain and ezetimibe.",

We described a severely affected FH proband and their first-degree blood relatives; the proband was resistant to statin therapy and was managed on an LDL apheresis program. In order to find the causative genetic variant in this family, direct exon sequencing of the LDLR, APOB and PCSK9 genes was performed. We identified a compound heterozygous mutation in the proband with missense p.(W577C) and frameshift p.(G676Afs33) variants at exons 12 and 14 of the LDLR gene respectively. DNA sequencing of LDLR gene from the parents demonstrated that the missense variant was inherited from the mother and frameshift variant was inherited from the father. The frameshift variant resulted in a stop signal 33 codons downstream of the deletion, which most likely led to a truncated protein that lacks important functional domains, including the trans-membrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail domain. The missense variant is also predicted to be likely pathogenic and affect EGF-precursor homology domain of the LDLR protein. The segregation pattern of the variants was consistent with the lipid profile, suggesting a more severe FH phenotype when the variants are in the compound heterozygous state. The finding of a compound heterozygous mutation causing severe FH phenotype is important for the genotype-phenotype correlation and also enlarges the spectrum of FH-causative LDLR variants in the Arab population, including the Saudi population.",

Methods: In the present study, the Ocimum gratissimum aqueous extract (OGE) was tested for the lowering effect on the serum lipid level of male hamsters on a high-fat (12%) and high-cholesterol (0.2%) diet (HFCD). Results: The results showed that the levels of serum high-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerols (TG) were increased in the HFCD group (113\u00b111, 259\u00b187, 629\u00b1175 and 625\u00b1262, respectively), as compared to the control normal diet group (51\u00b18, 19\u00b15, 77\u00b116 and 101\u00b144, respectively). When co-treated with various doses (10 and 20 mg/kg) of the OGE or rosuvastatin, the rats exhibited the restoration of normal serum LDL-C, TC, and TG levels. Conclusion: Therefore, we suggest that the Ocimum gratissimum aqueous extract may have the potential function of lowering serum lipid in rats.",

This has remained controversial and is particularly relevant to patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), who have an increased risk of cognitive decline and are frequently prescribed statins. This study hypothesized that low concentration of LDL is associated with poor cognition in CAD patients using statins. It also explored the association between high-dose versus low-dose statins on cognition in this population.",

There was also no difference in operative time, blood loss, contrast material volume, or fluoroscopy times between the two groups. Preoperative blood and CSF glucose levels were similar in those with and without LEW. During the postoperative period, glucose values in the blood and CSF were significantly higher in those patients who developed LEW compared with those who did not develop LEW. In all patients with LEW, the elevation in the blood or CSF glucose level preceded the development of LEW. In a multivariable logistic regression model, CSF glucose concentration on postoperative day 1 was significantly and independently associated with the development of LEW (odds ratio, 2.30 [1.03-5.14] per 10\u00a0mg/dL increase in CSF glucose; P\u00a0= .04).",

It is considered a major public health problem worldwide, affecting over 200 million people. Management of PAD includes smoking cessation, exercise, statin therapy, antiplatelet therapy, antihypertensive therapy and surgical intervention. Although these pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions usually increases blood flow to the ischemic limb, morbidity and mortality associated with PAD continue to increase. This scenario raises new fundamental questions regarding the contribution of intrinsic metabolic changes in the distal affected skeletal muscle to the progression of PAD. Recent evidence suggests that disruption of skeletal muscle mitochondrial quality control triggered by intermittent ischemia-reperfusion injury is associated with increased morbidity in individuals with PAD. The mitochondrial quality control machinery relies on surveillance systems that help maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis upon stress. In this review, we describe some of the most critical mechanisms responsible for the impaired skeletal muscle mitochondrial quality control in PAD. We also discuss recent findings on the central role of mitochondrial bioenergetics and quality control mechanisms including mitochondrial fusion-fission balance, turnover, oxidative stress and aldehyde metabolism in the pathophysiology of PAD, and highlight their potential as therapeutic targets.",

Substantial concern has been raised regarding the aggressive clinical lowering of cholesterol, particularly in light of a growing body of research linking low circulating lipid levels with negative behavioral outcomes in both human samples and non-human primate models. In 2009, Goldstein and colleagues tentatively speculated that the greed, impulsiveness, and lack of foresight that lead to the worldwide economic collapse in 2007-2008 could have been caused (in part) by depressed population cholesterol levels resulting from the widespread use of statins by workers in the financial services industry.

Statin use for patients undergoing endovascular interventions is recommended because of the reduction of postoperative cardiovascular events. Not enough data exist to support local effects of systemic statin therapy, such as prevention of restenosis.

To investigate the synergistic effect of statins and GT3 on TM; a low dose of atorvastatin and GT3 was used to treat human primary endothelial cells. Protein-level TM expression was measured by flow cytometry. TM functional activity was determined by activated protein C (APC) generation assay. Expression of Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), one of the key transcription factors of TM, was measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). TM expression increased in a dose-dependent manner after both atorvastatin and GT3 treatment. A combined treatment of a low-dose of atorvastatin and GT3 synergistically up-regulated TM expression and functional activity. Finally; atorvastatin and GT3 synergistically increased KLF2 expression.

Another approach is to fuse genetic material from nonhuman sources (eg, mice) with human genetic material. The fused gene is inserted into a tissue culture that produces the gene product (ie, a chimeric monoclonal antibody).

While interviewees regarded DNA testing as an unexceptional event, it was seen as a positive innovation because it confirmed that their family carried a particular disorder, offered an aetiological explanation for their hypercholesterolemia and provided information about their own and family members' future risks. From the patient perspective, the main benefit of molecular diagnosis lies in its ability to provide information which allows (younger) family members to access genetic screening and, thus, timely treatment.

The new treatment strategies for lipid-lowering therapy include using proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors as an exciting approach to reduce residual risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). However, concerns about possible adverse effects, including neurocognitive disorders, were issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The current disputable evidence does not allow definite conclusions as to whether statins contribute to, or cause, clinically meaningful cognitive impairment. Some evidence indicates a high rate of memory loss, while other evidence suggests a benefit in dementia prevention. This debate should not discourage appropriate statin and other lipid-lowering drug administration. However, prescribers should be aware of such potential drug-related side effects. Prospective controlled studies comparing the short- and long-term effects of different statins on cognitive function are warranted. The effects of intensive LDL-C lowering on neurocognition might be attributed to an off-target effect. It is also possible that pre-existing pathology and vascular risk may already be present outweighing any effect related to lipids. Gender, genetic, LDL-C-related genotypes and aging-related changes should also be considered. Some data indicate that carriers of apolipoprotein E (apoE) \u03b5-4 allele, with low levels of apoA1 and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol have a distinct plasma lipid profile and may be more susceptible to neurocognitive dysfunction.

The difference between the changes in maximum AAA diameter was significant between groups at 1 year (no-statin group vs statin group, -4.9 mm \u00b1 5.9; P = .041), but the difference did not reach statistical significance at 2 years (no-statin group, -10.0 mm \u00b1 10.1; statin group, -8.0 mm \u00b1 9.6; P = .306). Statin therapy was not associated with AAA sac regression on univariate (odds ratio [OR], 0.685; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.310-1.516; P = .351) and multivariate analyses (OR, 0.617; 95% CI, 0.215-1.772; P = .369).",

    "252": "Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) improves exercise capacity (EC), but not all CR participants achieve such improvements. Our primary aim was to develop a tool to identify those with suboptimal improvement in EC after CR. We retrospectively analyzed 541 patients enrolled in a phase-II CR program after a cardiac event or intervention from 2003 to 2014. EC was assessed with the 6-minute walk test. We developed a multivariate linear regression model and corresponding nomogram to predict EC after CR. The predictors included in the final model were age, gender, baseline EC, primary referral diagnosis, body mass index, systolic blood pressure at rest, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, lipid-lowering medication use, and an interaction term of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with lipid-lowering therapy. The prediction model was internally validated using bootstrap methods, and a nomogram was created for ease of use. In conclusion, this tool helps to identify those patients with suboptimal improvement in EC who could be targeted for individualized interventions to increase their performance."
