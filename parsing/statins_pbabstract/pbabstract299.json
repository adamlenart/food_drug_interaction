It is unknown whether racial disparities exist for other treatments for non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE ACS) and how different treatments affect outcomes.", 
    "1": "Using data from 400 US hospitals participating in the CRUSADE (Can Rapid Risk Stratification of Unstable Angina Patients Suppress Adverse Outcomes with Early Implementation of the ACC/AHA Guidelines?) National Quality Improvement Initiative, we identified black and white patients with high-risk NSTE ACS (positive cardiac markers and/or ischemic ST-segment changes). After adjustment for demographics and medical comorbidity, we compared the use of therapies recommended by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for NSTE ACS and outcomes by race. Our study included 37,813 (87.3%) white and 5504 (12.7%) black patients. Black patients were younger; were more likely to have hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, and renal insufficiency; and were less likely to have insurance coverage or primary cardiology care. Black patients had a similar or higher likelihood than whites of receiving older ACS treatments such as aspirin, beta-blockers, or ACE inhibitors but were significantly less likely to receive newer ACS therapies, including acute glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, acute and discharge clopidogrel, and statin therapy at discharge. Blacks were also less likely to receive cardiac catheterization, revascularization procedures, or smoking cessation counseling. Acute risk-adjusted outcomes were similar between black and white patients.",

    "4": "HUVECs were treated with simvastatin or lovastatin (10(-6) mmol/L) for 24 hours, then the drugs were replaced by a medium. At 6, 12, 18 and 24 hours after stopping statin treatment, nitric oxide production was measured with Griess reagents. Levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA were examined with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).", 
    "5": "After 24 hours of incubation, both simvastatin and lovastatin increased the nitric oxide production by (173 +/- 33)% and (170 +/- 44)% respectively and the production of nitric oxide at 24 hours after withdrawal of statins decreased by (64 +/- 9)% and (49 +/- 10)% respectively. These effects of simvastatin and lovastatin on eNOS mRNA expression correlated with changes in nitric oxide production.", 
    "6": "Withdrawal of statins can decrease the production of nitric oxide and the expression of eNOS mRNA, which may account for high cardiovascular events rate in clinical study when statins treatment was stopped abruptly.",

After 52 weeks' therapy, the concentrations of serum gamma-tocopherol in the simvastatin group and serum beta-carotene in both treatment groups returned to baseline levels, while the concentrations of serum gamma-tocopherol in the atorvastatin group and LDL anti-oxidant capacity and serum alpha-tocopherol in both treatment groups remained reduced (P < 0.001 for all). The LDL antioxidant capacity:LDL-cholesterol and the serum alpha-tocopherol:LDL-cholesterol ratios were significantly elevated with both statins after 12 and 52 weeks (P < 0.001 for all). Statistically significant increases were also observed for corresponding ratios of the less abundant vitamins gamma-tocopherol and beta-carotene.", 
    "11": "Some of the decreases in serum lipid soluble antioxidant vitamins reported in short-term statin interventions may become attenuated when therapy continues longer. The relative antioxidant capacity of LDL particles increased during the 52-week treatment, suggesting that the oxidation resistance of LDL particles did not become impaired and that their atherogenicity did not increase.",

In addition, gene expression patterns during the development of in-stent restenosis have been examined. Several studies have also explored the pleiotropic effects of statin therapy. As a technical improvement, the combination of laser microdissection with microarrays in human samples has been reported.",

We also derived drug acquisition costs from the average wholesale prices to estimate the cost/1% reduction in LDL levels and the cost/patient achieving the ATP III LDL goal.", 
    "18": "In the STELLAR trial, doses of rosuvastatin produced reductions in LDL significantly greater than those of equivalent milligram/milligram doses of atorvastatin, simvastatin, or pravastatin. The annual acquisition cost/percentage LDL reduction was lower with rosuvastatin at doses of 10 mg (20.92 dollars), 20 mg (18.28 dollars), and 40 mg (17.42 dollars) than with the other statins analyzed. Rosuvastatin also had a lower average cost/patient achieving the ATP III LDL goal over 6 weeks than that of the other statins.", 
    "19": "Although the long-term clinical benefits and safety data from the increased LDL reduction achieved with rosuvastatin remain uncertain, rosuvastatin may be the most cost-effective statin among those analyzed in terms of acquisition cost/1% reduction in LDL levels and in terms of patients achieving ATP III LDL goals. On the basis of the efficacy estimates from the STELLAR trial in conjunction with acquisition cost, a potential cost savings could be realized from the use of rosuvastatin.", 
    "20": "Osteoporosis is a leading public health threat affecting approximately 44 million people in the United States. Most of the therapies for this disease work to prevent further bone loss, improve bone mineral density, and reduce the risk of fractures. These agents, however, have not been proved to increase bone formation significantly. Therefore, the ideal agent would not only improve bone strength by decreasing bone breakdown, but also promote bone formation in the ultimate quest to prevent fractures. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) have become an area of research in the battle against osteoporosis. Two mechanisms for beneficial effects of statins on bones have been proposed, and although in vitro, in vivo, and animal studies have shown positive effects on bone mineralization and reductions in bone resorption, clinical data on surrogate markers and fracture rates are conflicting. The inherent problems with observational studies also must be addressed. Until that time, the use of statins in the prevention of fractures or the treatment of osteoporosis requires further study.", 
    "21": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of shear stress (SS) in plaque regression.", 
    "22": "A condition favorable to the development of atherosclerotic lesions is low oscillating SS. In the descending thoracic aorta, the relationship between plaque distribution and SS has never been characterized. The regression of plaque as the result of lipid-lowering therapy is associated with reverse atherogenic mechanisms. Therefore, we investigated the role of SS in plaque regression. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a unique opportunity to noninvasively study morphology and hemodynamics.", 
    "23": "Cross-sectional images of atherosclerotic plaques in the descending thoracic aorta of 10 asymptomatic, hypercholesteremic patients were acquired at baseline and 24 months after starting lipid-lowering therapy by using a black-blood sequence on a 1.5-T clinical MRI system (5 mm x 780 microm x 780 microm). Average wall thickness (WT) was derived per quadrant. The aorta was subdivided in segments 2 cm in length starting 1 cm from the aortic arch.", 
    "24": "Average WT decreased with increasing distance from the arch (3.0 +/- 0.7 mm vs. 2.5 +/- 0.3 mm; p < 0.05) and showed a helical pattern from the proximal to distal segments. Phase-contrast MRI was performed in the thoracic aorta of eight healthy volunteers to derive typical average SS distribution. Shear stress predicted the location of WT (r(2) = 0.29, p < 0.05) but did not predict plaque regression. The best predictor of plaque regression was baseline WT.", 
    "25": "Our data showing an association between WT and average low SS locations support the role of local hemodynamics in the development of atherosclerotic lesions in descending thoracic aorta. Furthermore, SS does not seem to be the major predictor for plaque regression by lipid-lowering interventions. Therefore, our data suggest that other mechanisms are involved in the lipid-reversal mechanism.", 
    "26": "The pharmacologic treatment of hypertension has been extensively studied by clinical trials. These studies have provided definitive evidence of a treatment benefit, and the weight and consistency of the clinical evidence has led to uniformity in many aspects of treatment recommendations worldwide. However, controversies remain-in particular, whether specific classes of drug therapy offer benefits for cardiovascular disease prevention beyond the expected benefits of blood pressure lowering per se. Updated large-scale epidemiologic studies and the meta-analysis of clinical trial data have better informed this debate and emphasized that the main driver of clinical benefit from blood pressure-lowering therapy is the magnitude of blood pressure reduction and perhaps the speed at which it is achieved. However, clinical trials are of short duration, and there are more marked drug-specific differences in intermediate cardiovascular structure, functional, and metabolic end points. The challenge is to interpret their significance with regard to longer term outcomes. Finally, although blood pressure lowering is undoubtedly beneficial, the concepts of single risk factor intervention and arbitrary blood pressure thresholds and treatment goals are being challenged by the recognition that the real target is cardiovascular disease risk. Undoubtedly, the most effective way to \"go beyond blood pressure\" is to add a statin.", 
    "27": "The recently published Lipid-Lowering Arm of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT-LLA) provides interesting evidence for the use of statins in hypertensive patients with average cholesterol concentrations and other cardiovascular risk factors. The clinical benefit of atorvastatin in these patients is probably explained by both lipid-dependent and lipid-independent effects of the drug. Many of these effects are related to inhibition of the synthesis of isoprenoid, which serves as lipid attachment for a variety of proteins implicated in intracellular signalling. These proteins have an important role in cell growth, actin cytoskeleton organisation, membrane trafficking, gene expression, cell proliferation/migration and programmed cell death. In this article we summarise the different effects of statins inrelation to the results observed in the ASCOT-LLA study.", 
    "28": "The lowering of cholesterol concentrations in individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease improves outcome. No study, however, has assessed benefits of cholesterol lowering in the primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) in hypertensive patients who are not conventionally deemed dyslipidaemic.", 
    "29": "Of 19 342 hypertensive patients (aged 40-79 years with at least three other cardiovascular risk factors) randomised to one of two antihypertensive regimens in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial, 10,305 with nonfasting total cholesterol concentrations 6.5 mmol/L or less were randomly assigned additional atorvastatin 10 mg or placebo. These patients formed the lipid-lowering arm of the study. We planned follow-up for an average of 5 years, the primary endpoint being non-fatal myocardial infarction and fatal CHD. Data were analysed by intention to treat.", 
    "30": "Treatment was stopped after a median follow-up of 3.3 years. By that time, 100 primary events had occurred in the atorvastatin group compared with 154 events in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.64 [95% CI 0.50-0.83], p = 0.0005). This benefit emerged in the first year of follow-up. There was no significant heterogeneity among prespecified subgroups. Fatal and non-fatal stroke (89 atorvastatin vs 121 placebo, 0.73 [0.56-0.96], p = 0.024), total cardiovascular events (389 vs 486, 0.79 [0.69-0.90], p = 0.0005), and total coronary events (178 vs 247, 0.71 [0.59-0.86], p = 0.0005) were also significantly lowered. There were 185 deaths in the atorvastatin group and 212 in the placebo group (0.87 [0.71-1.06], p = 0.16). Atorvastatin lowered total serum cholesterol by about 1.3 mmol/L compared with placebo at 12 months, and by 1.1 mmol/L after 3 years of follow-up.", 
    "31": "The reductions in major cardiovascular events with atorvastatin are large, given the short follow-up time. These findings may have implications for future lipid-lowering guidelines.", 
    "32": "Atherosclerosis is the major cause of death in the world. Fasting and postprandial hyperlipidaemia are important risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD). Recent developments have undoubtedly indicated that inflammation is pathophysiologically closely linked to atherogenesis and its clinical consequences. Inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), leucocyte count and complement component 3 (C3) have been linked to CHD and to hyperlipidaemia and several other CHD risk factors. Increases in these markers may result from activation of endothelial cells (CRP, leucocytes, C3), disturbances in adipose tissue fatty acid metabolism (CRP, C3), or from direct effects of CHD risk factors (leucocytes). It has been shown that lipoproteins, triglycerides, fatty acids and glucose can activate endothelial cells, most probably as a result of the production of reactive oxygen species. Similar mechanisms may also lead to leucocyte activation. Increases in triglycerides, fatty acids and glucose are common disturbances in the metabolic syndrome and are most prominent in the postprandial phase. People are in a postprandial state most of the day, and this phase is proatherogenic. Inhibition of the activation of leucocytes, endothelial cells, or both, is an interesting target for intervention, as activation is obligatory for adherence of leucocytes to the endothelium, thereby initiating atherogenesis. Potential interventions include the use of unsaturated long-chain fatty acids, polyphenols, antioxidants, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and high-dose aspirin, which have direct anti-inflammatory and antiatherogenic effects. Furthermore, peroxisome proliferator activating receptor gamma (PPARgamma) agonists and statins have similar properties, which are in part independent of their lipid-lowering effects.", 
    "33": "Most acute coronary syndromes result from the rupture or erosion of high-risk plaques. Clinical imaging studies have shown that atherosclerotic plaque formation and rupture are widespread processes that are often asymptomatic. The rationale for atherosclerosis imaging is the in-vivo identification of high-risk lesions, which may subsequently lead to prevention of future cardiovascular events. Although intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging studies demonstrated that echolucent appearance of the plaque and expansive (positive) remodelling are associated with unstable clinical presentation, these characteristics were not adequate for accurate plaque characterisation. Recent technical developments in ultrasound equipment and analytical methods, utilising several characteristics of the digitised ultrasound signal with radiofrequency analysis and elastography, promise accurate tissue characterisation. Other imaging modalities, including optical coherence tomography, also contribute to a more precise characterisation of the composition of atherosclerotic plaques. A non-imaging approach is the focal assessment of temperature differences using sensitive intravascular thermography catheters, presumably reflecting focal inflammatory changes of vulnerable lesions. Although the histological characteristics of the atheroma are critically important in the sequence of events leading to acute coronary syndromes, the clinical relevance of identifying these characteristics is not yet clear. There is increasing evidence that identifying and treating individual culprit lesions may not be enough to prevent the ischaemic cardiac events in most patients, because the acute coronary syndrome is not a disease of a single site or a few discrete segments, but rather a systemic disease that involves the entire coronary tree. In addition to detection and quantitation of early coronary atherosclerosis and disease activity, accurate and reproducible methods could help to identify high-risk patients and allow serial monitoring during various therapeutic interventions. Serial IVUS imaging makes it possible to visualise the vessel wall that harbours the atheroma at different time points. Typically, serial IVUS allows the assessment of the percentage change in atheroma volume, with considerable statistical power to detect small changes. Using this methodology, aggressive lipid lowering by a high-dose statin agent has been shown to stop the progression of atherosclerosis, and a new mutant high-density lipoprotein complex was found to be effective in regressing atheroma burden. Although intravascular ultrasound is very accurate for quantification of atheroma burden, widespread application and accurate and reproducible non-invasive imaging modalities are needed for large-scale risk assessment algorithms. Cardiovascular computed tomography is at the forefront of the non-invasive imaging modalities. Future prospective imaging studies will be necessary to identify focal or systemic characteristics of high-risk lesions and to demonstrate the relationship between plaque burden, biochemical markers and clinical events.", 
    "34": "A role for osteoblastic beta-adrenoreceptors in bone regulation is suggested by the finding that beta-blockers increase bone mass in mice. We studied the association of beta-blocker use with BMD and fractures in the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures. beta-blocker use and BMD are unrelated in this cohort, and associations with fracture risk are inconsistent.", 
    "35": "The central nervous system has been shown to regulate bone mass in mice, possibly by way of the beta(2)-adrenoreceptors on osteoblasts. beta-blockers have been shown to increase bone mass in mice. Because these agents are widely used therapeutically, it is possible that they may influence fracture epidemiology in humans, and they are a potential therapy for osteoporosis.", 
    "36": "We have studied the association of beta-blocker use with BMD and fracture rates in the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures. beta-blocker use was recorded at the fourth visit, in 8412 women, of whom 1099 were users, and these women were followed for 7 years.", 
    "37": "Users had significantly higher weight, more thiazide use, more estrogen use, less glucocorticoid use, more statin use, and more hypertension than nonusers, and they smoked less. Total hip BMD at the fourth visit was higher in the beta-blocker users (0.746 versus 0.735 g/cm(2), p = 0.02), but adjustment for weight alone, or together with these other variables, eliminated this difference (p = 0.62). There was no effect of beta-blocker use on loss of hip BMD over a mean follow-up of 4 years (p = 0.48). Os calcis BMD at visit 4 was also higher in those taking beta-blockers (0.385 versus 0.375 g/cm(2), p = 0.005), but weight adjustment eliminated this difference (p = 0.14). The frequencies of hip or any fracture (since age 50) were similar in users and nonusers (p = 0.80 and p = 0.51, respectively). Over a mean follow-up of 7 years, there were 2167 total fractures, including 431 at the wrist and 585 at the hip. Among beta-blocker users, hazards ratios were 0.92 (0.81, 1.05) for any fracture, 0.74 (0.54, 1.01) for wrist fracture, and 0.76 (0.58, 0.99) for hip fracture. Adjustment for weight and other factors previously shown to influence hip fracture incidence in this cohort made little difference to the outcome. When fracture data were analyzed for nonselective and beta(1)-selective agents separately, trends toward fewer fractures were confined to the users of selective beta(1)-blockers.", 
    "38": "beta-Blocker use and BMD are unrelated in this cohort, and associations with fracture risk are inconsistent. Therefore, a history of use of these drugs is not useful in assessing fracture risk, nor do they have a role in osteoporosis management at this time. The relationship between beta-blocker use and hip fracture deserves further study.", 
    "39": "Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in the Myocardial Ischaemia Reduction with Aggressive Cholesterol Lowering (MIRACL) study had diminished cardiovascular events after 16 weeks of treatment of atorvastatin 80 mg daily. We determined whether plasma lipoproteins at baseline and then at 6 weeks after randomization predicted clinical outcome.", 
    "40": "Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to determine relations between lipoproteins and clinical endpoint events. Baseline LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) did not predict outcome. In contrast, baseline HDL-C predicted outcome with a hazard ratio of 0.986 per mg/dL increment in HDL-C, P<0.001, indicating 1.4% reduction in risk for each 1 mg/dL increase in HDL-C. Atorvastatin treatment profoundly lowered LDL-C, but had minimal effect on HDL-C. Neither Week 6 LDL-C nor absolute change of LDL-C from baseline by Week 6 had any significant impact on clinical endpoints occurring between Week 6 and Week 16 after randomization.", 
    "41": "Plasma HDL-C, but not LDL-C, measured in the initial stage of ACS predicts the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events over the ensuing 16 weeks. LDL-C reduction does not account for the clinical risk reduction with atorvastatin treatment after ACS. This finding may suggest that the clinical benefit of atorvastatin after ACS is mediated by qualitative changes in the LDL particle and/or by non-lipid (pleiotropic) effects of the drug.", 
    "42": "Observational and experimental studies suggest that BM-derived stem and progenitor cells may have the capacity to repair damaged cardiovascular tissue and initiate blood vessel growth in regions of ischemia. Despite controversies regarding transdifferentiation potential of adult stem cells, clinical trials are underway testing the hypothesis that BM cell-based approaches to a broad spectrum of cardiovascular diseases and disease presentations will be safe and effective strategies for patient management.", 
    "43": "We investigated whether statin type or dose influenced the inhibition of platelet function induced by clopidogrel in a prospective, open, parallel group study in patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients were taking CYP3A4 metabolised atorvastatin (n = 20) or simvastatin (n = 21), non-CYP3A4 metabolised pravastatin (n = 11) or fluvastatin (n = 2), or no statin therapy (n = 5). ADP and TRAP-induced platelet aggregation were measured using optical aggregometry, whole-blood single-platelet counting, and the Ultegra and Plateletworks point-of-care systems. Platelet pro-coagulant activity (annexin V binding and microparticle formation), P-selectin expression and platelet-leukocyte conjugate formation were assessed by flow cytometry. Platelet responses were measured at baseline, 4 h post clopidogrel 300 mg, and after 10 and 28 days with clopidogrel 75 mg daily. Clopidogrel significantly inhibited both ADP and TRAP-induced platelet responses over time, with steady state inhibition achieved by day 10. This was demonstrated by all techniques used. There was no significant effect of statin type or dose on platelet responses by any method at any time-point. In conclusion, statins do not influence the inhibitory effects of clopidogrel on multiple platelet responses, including aggregation, P-selectin expression, platelet-leucocyte conjugate formation and pro-coagulant responses, in patients undergoing elective PCI.", 
    "44": "Statins affect the production of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), both in vitro and in vivo. Various studies have shown the effects of statins on the pattern of n-6 fatty acids (FA), but limited attention has been paid to the n-3 FA. We investigated, in THP-1 and in HepG2 cells, the effects of simvastatin on the conversion of the 18C FA precursors in the n-3 and n-6 series, [1-(14)C] alpha-linolenic acid (alpha-LNA) and [1-(14)C] linoleic acid (LA) respectively, and on the metabolism of [1-(14)C] stearic acid (SA). THP-1 cells, as in the case of LA, actively converted alpha-LNA to its products, and after simvastatin treatment, the total conversion was significantly increased (from 57.2+/-7.2 to 74.3+/-8.5%, p<0.05). HepG2 cells also converted LA and alpha-LNA, but simvastatin increased significantly only the conversion of LA (9.5+/-1.9% versus 23.8+/-5.1%, p<0.02). SA conversion was similar in untreated cells (about 50%), while statin increased the production of oleic acid in HepG2, but in THP-1 cells there was a decrease. In conclusion, LA, alpha-LNA and SA are differentially metabolized in THP-1 and in HepG2 cells and their increased conversion by simvastatin is lower in HepG2 than in THP-1. These differences may reflect the distinct features of the two cell lines: monocytes, precursors of phagocytic cells, versus hepatocytes with mainly metabolic functions. Substantial differences concern also cellular FA pools: structural in THP-1 cells, and also depot, resulting in sequestering of the substrates, in HepG2. The greater n-3 FA metabolism in THP-1 cells may have favourable functional effects.", 
    "45": "Imidazoline-like drugs are centrally-acting antihypertensive agents that inhibit the activity of the sympathetic nervous system by interacting with the alpha2-adrenoreceptor and also with a non-adrenergic imidazoline binding site called the imidazoline 1 receptor. Recently, these molecules were proposed to play an additional role in cardiovascular diseases by acting on glucose and lipid metabolism. We used S23515, a potent imidazoline-like molecule acting selectively on blood pressure through the imidazoline 1 receptor, to decipher the effects of these drugs on lipid metabolism. We found that S23515 inhibited specifically and dose-dependently cholesterol synthesis in cultured rodent and primate hepatocytes. This hypocholesterolemic effect was likely due to the inhibition of the oxido:lanosterol cyclase (OSC), a rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Partial OSC inhibition induced by S23515 led to the generation of 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol, a potent ligand for the liver X receptor (LXR). Furthermore, S23515 increased in human macrophages the expression of both ABCA1 and G1, the 2 ATP binding cassette transporters, which play a pivotal role in the reverse cholesterol transport. Thus, these results suggest that S23515, and potentially other imidazoline-like drugs, could exert hypolipidemic effects in addition to their hypotensive activities.", 
    "46": "During the last two decades with the introduction of statins large reductions in cholesterol concentrations were easily and safely achievable and this led to studies that demonstrated benefits of statin use. But only fewer than one fourth of adults with coronary heart disease were receiving lipid-lowering drugs in a cross sectional health survey done in England. Thus this study was designed to evaluate the frequency of statin use in type 2 Pakistani diabetic subjects with macrovascular disease attending a tertiary care unit in Karachi, Pakistan.", 
    "47": "Records of type 2 diabetic subjects coming to the outpatient department of Baqai Institute of Diabetology and Endocrinology from September 1996 to December 2001 was analyzed for their anthropometric and biochemical characteristics. Patients having any macrovascular disease were identified and frequency of statin use by these subjects was studied.", 
    "48": "Out of a total of 2152 patients 502 (252 males, 250 females) having macrovascular disease were identified. Only 16.5% of them (44 males, 39 females) were taking statins. Use of statins was higher amongst those who had angina (20%) or myocardial infarction (17%) compared to those who had stroke (10%). Sixty two percent of the users while 52% of the non-users had elevated blood cholesterol.", 
    "49": "Frequency of statin use in the subjects studied was much lower than was warranted with respect to their disease status. Presence of elevated blood cholesterol despite using statins suggested inappropriate treatment in these subjects.

After 10 weeks, hemodynamic assessment was performed and endothelial function was determined in organ bath studies. NO bioavailability was assessed by in vivo platelet vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation. Markers of platelet degranulation (surface expression of P-selectin and glycoprotein 53) were determined as well as the amount of circulating platelet-leukocyte aggregates. Endothelium-dependent, acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation was significantly impaired in aortic rings from CHF rats and improved by rosuvastatin. In parallel, in vivo VASP phosphorylation reflecting NO bioavailability was significantly attenuated in platelets from CHF rats and normalized by rosuvastatin. Platelet activation, which was increased in CHF, was reduced by treatment with rosuvastatin.",

The present study was designed to address these issues.", 
    "54": "Nineteen subjects, 9 of whom were taking 20 mg of atorvastatin for hypercholesterolemia, received placebo for 4 weeks, followed by the CETP inhibitor torcetrapib (120 mg QD) for 4 weeks. In 6 subjects from the nonatorvastatin cohort, the everyday regimen was followed by a 4-week period of torcetrapib (120 mg BID). At the end of each phase, subjects underwent a primed-constant infusion of (5,5,5-2H3)-L-leucine to determine the kinetics of HDL apoA-I. The lipid data in this study have been reported previously. Relative to placebo, 120 mg daily torcetrapib increased the amount of apoA-I in alpha1-migrating HDL in the atorvastatin (136%; P<0.001) and nonatorvastatin (153%; P<0.01) cohorts, whereas an increase of 382% (P<0.01) was observed in the 120 mg twice daily group. HDL apoA-I pool size increased by 8+/-15% in the atorvastatin cohort (P=0.16) and by 16+/-7% (P<0.0001) and 34+/-8% (P<0.0001) in the nonatorvastatin 120 mg QD and BID cohorts, respectively. These changes were attributable to reductions in HDL apoA-I fractional catabolic rate (FCR), with torcetrapib reducing HDL apoA-I FCR by 7% (P=0.10) in the atorvastatin cohort, by 8% (P<0.001) in the nonatorvastatin 120 mg QD cohort, and by 21% (P<0.01) in the nonatorvastatin 120 mg BID cohort. Torcetrapib did not affect HDL apoA-I production rate. In addition, torcetrapib did not significantly change serum markers of cholesterol or bile acid synthesis or fecal sterol excretion.", 
    "55": "These data indicate that partial inhibition of CETP via torcetrapib in patients with low HDL-C: (1) normalizes apoA-I levels within alpha1-migrating HDL, (2) increases plasma concentrations of HDL apoA-I by delaying apoA-I catabolism, and (3) does not significantly influence fecal sterol excretion.", 
    "56": "Epidemiologists have found a decreased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) in people taking statins (cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors). We have reported previously that, in cell culture, lovastatin decreases the output of beta-amyloid, a peptide that is toxic to neurones, and is reputably the prime cause of neurodegeneration seen in AD. This report probes the mechanism of statin protection further by finding out how the protease beta-secretase, that releases beta-amyloid from its precursor protein, behaves under changed cholesterol levels induced by statins. We found that, with high cellular cholesterol levels, there is a decrease in glycosylation of mature oligosaccharides in beta-secretase, whereas in the presence of lovastatin, glycosylation progresses further. Moreover, lovastatin does not inhibit beta-secretase in vitro. Thus, the cholesterol and statin effects are due to changes in cellular targeting induced by changed cholesterol gradients. Some of these changes are mimicked by the action of U18666A, a cholesterol-transport inhibitor that produces a defect in cells seen in patients with Neimann Pick's disorder.", 
    "57": "There is increasing evidence suggesting that control of hypertension and antiplatelet therapy may prevent or reduce progression of vascular-related cognitive impairment (VCI), though a similar role of statins in this group of patients has yet to be established.", 
    "58": "We conducted a postal survey of a group of 296 medical practitioners (comprising of physicians and psychiatrists specialising in the elderly, and general practitioners) inquiring into their management of (a) patients at high risk of developing VCI and (b) patients with established VCI.", 
    "59": "The overall response rate was 60% (177/296), with the highest response rate from psychiatrists. (a) For patients at high risk of developing VCI: 47% of clinicians believed that statins had an important role in preventing subsequent dementia: 4% would commence statins at a total cholesterol (TC) of 4-5 mmol/L; 38% with a TC of 5.1-6.5 mmol/L; and 32% with a TC of 6.6-8 mmol/L. Cardiovascular risk profile, age, cost and gender were other factors considered as important factors influencing statin prescription. (b) In those patients with established VCI: 32% of clinicians felt that statins had an important role in arresting progression, usually in people with a mild degree of cognitive impairment: 4% would commence statins at a TC of 4-5 mmol/L; 25% with a TC of 5.1-6.5 mmol/L; and 22% with a TC of 6.6-8 mmol/L. There were no major differences between clinicians in their prescribing habits.", 
    "60": "A substantial proportion of clinicians favour the use of statins in primary and secondary prevention of cognitive impairment of vascular origin, despite a lack of definite evidence to support their use at the present time.", 
    "61": "BACKGROUND: Surrogate measures for cardiovascular disease events have the potential to increase greatly the efficiency of clinical trials. A leading candidate for such a surrogate is the progression of intima-media thickness (IMT) of the carotid artery; much experience has been gained with this endpoint in trials of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). METHODS AND RESULTS: We examine two separate systems of criteria that have been proposed to define surrogate endpoints, based on clinical and statistical arguments. We use published results and a formal meta-analysis to evaluate whether progression of carotid IMT meets these criteria for HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins).IMT meets clinical-based criteria to serve as a surrogate endpoint for cardiovascular events in statin trials, based on relative efficiency, linkage to endpoints, and congruency of effects. Results from a meta-analysis and post-trial follow-up from a single published study suggest that IMT meets established statistical criteria by accounting for intervention effects in regression models. CONCLUSION: Carotid IMT progression meets accepted definitions of a surrogate for cardiovascular disease endpoints in statin trials. This does not, however, establish that it may serve universally as a surrogate marker in trials of other agents.", 
    "62": "In the past decade, impressive strides have been made in the diagnosis and management of atherosclerotic, aneurysmal, and thromboembolic diseases, thanks in large part to the explosive growth in both vascular biology and clinical vascular medicine. We review what we consider to be the top 12 advances in this field: the discovery of nitric oxide, the metabolic syndrome, new thrombophilic disorders, therapeutic angiogenesis, endoluminal treatment of chronic venous disease, and a variety of drugs, including sildenafil, cilostazol, low-molecular-weight heparins, oral direct thrombin inhibitors, clopidogrel, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blocking agents.", 
    "63": "Aggressive statin therapy to reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in patients with normal LDL-cholesterol levels reduces the incidence of future cardiovascular events and enhances atherosclerotic regression in the common carotid artery. We tried to quantify changes in flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), inflammatory cytokines, and the severity of carotid arterial stenosis, after aggressive statin administration to patients with normal LDL-cholesterol levels, and stroke or transient ischemic attack ipsilateral to carotid arterial stenosis.", 
    "64": "Twenty patients with at least a 50% reduction in the diameter of the carotid artery were studied. Atorvastatin 10 mg daily was prescribed for 4 months. Serial changes in the severity of carotid arterial stenosis, and brachial-artery FMD were evaluated by high-resolution ultrasound. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM), intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM), soluble endothelin-1 (ET-1), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), were measured before, and after 2 and 4 months of, atorvastatin treatment.", 
    "65": "Atorvastatin significantly decreased plasma levels of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol after 1, 2 and 4 months of treatment (p < 0.01). FMD showed significant improvement after only 4 months (10.0% vs 6.8% at baseline; p = 0.019). The overall severity of carotid arterial lesions was not significantly reduced by atorvastatin. Changes in TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and ET-1 showed trends towards a progressive decline after atorvastatin, but none of the cytokines was reduced significantly. FMD did not correlate with the severity of carotid arterial stenosis, lipid profile, or cytokine levels.", 
    "66": "Atorvastatin effectively reduced plasma concentrations of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, and had beneficial effects on endothelial function, in Chinese patients with carotid arterial stenosis and normal LDL-cholesterol levels.", 
    "67": "The assessment of brachial-artery FMD is a reliable, reproducible and noninvasive tool for evaluating endothelial dysfunction, which, together with endothelial inflammation, causes carotid atherosclerosis. Atorvastatin therapy can reverse endothelial dysfunction after 4 months, and may have significant anti-inflammatory effects if continued for more than 4 months. Importantly, statin therapy can be used to treat carotid atherosclerosis.", 
    "68": "The removal from the marketplace of several widely prescribed drugs due to hepatotoxicity has attracted considerable attention. Now under extensive review are means by which we can better identify hepatic risk prior to federal approval. Assessment of risk-to-benefit ratios regarding a novel agent with hepatotoxicity issues (especially one for a life-threatening condition) requires considerable judgment and education on the part of prescribers and patients. The spectrum of drug-induced liver injury is broad with simulation of almost all unknown liver disorders. Drug-induced liver injuries often have a somewhat characteristic signature, as regards type of injury (hepatocellular vs cholestatic) and time of onset. The diagnosis of drug-induced liver injury is often one of exclusion with initial suspicion based on circumstantial evidence. Factors affecting susceptibility to drug-induced injury include age, sex, concomitant use of other drugs, and genetic polymorphism in metabolic pathways involved in activation or disposition of therapeutic drugs. Drug-drug interactions present particular problems in patients, often elderly, who are receiving several drugs simultaneously. Mechanisms of drug-induced liver injury are many and varied. With many drugs, intermediary products produced during metabolism are highly reactive and toxic. In these situations, the balance between the rate of production of the metabolite and the effectiveness of the drug may determine whether or not hepatic injury occurs.", 
    "69": "Increased resistance to portal blood flow is the primary factor in the pathophysiology of portal hypertension, and is mainly determined by the morphologic changes occurring in chronic liver diseases. This is aggravated by an increased hepatic vascular tone, which results from an insufficient hepatic bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) and an increased production of circulating and local vasoconstrictors (angiotensin, endothelin, cysteinyl-leukotrienes, and thromboxane, among others). This dynamic and reversible component provides the rationale for the use of therapies aimed at decreasing portal pressure by reducing the vascular tone. Among them, systemic and liver-selective NO donors, statins, and gene therapy with adenovirus encoding NO synthases have been used to increase NO availability with promising results. Other attempts have been the blockade of the effect of vasoconstrictors, using anti alpha-adrenergic agents and renin-angiotensin system blockers. Some of these pharmacologic approaches have already been incorporated into clinical practice while others are still under investigation.", 
    "70": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) treatment is frontline therapy for lowering plasma cholesterol levels in patients with hyperlipidemia. In a few case studies, analysis of clinical data has revealed a decreased risk of fracture in patients on statin therapy. However, this reduction in the incidence of fracture is not always observed nor is it supported by an increase in bone density, which further complicates our understanding of the role of statins in bone metabolism. Thus, the precise role of statins in bone metabolism remains poorly understood. In this study, we examined the effect of statin treatment on osteoclastogenesis. Treatment with lovastatin resulted in a significant, dose-dependent decrease in the numbers of differentiated osteoclasts and decreased cholesterol biosynthesis activity with an EC(50) similar to that observed in freshly isolated rat or cultured human liver cells. Studies assessing the role of mevalonate metabolites in the development of the osteoclasts demonstrated that geranylgeraniol, but not squalene or farnesol was important for the development and differentiation of osteoclasts, implicating protein geranylgeranylation rather than protein farnesylation as a key factor in the osteoclast differentiation process. In conclusion, our data indicate that lovastatin inhibits osteoclast development through inhibition of geranylgeranylation of key prenylated proteins and that the bone effects of statins are at least partially due to their effects on osteoclast numbers.", 
    "71": "Statins are believed to reduce coronary heart disease by mechanisms in addition to their well-known cholesterol lowering effect.", 
    "72": "We studied the effect of statins on expression of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), adhesion molecules, and antioxidized low-density lipoprotein antibody (anti-oxLDL Ab) in patients with unstable angina (Braunwald class IIb or IIIb) undergoing coronary stenting.", 
    "73": "Consecutive 50 patients with unstable angina were included in the study. We classified the study subjects as patients using statins (Group A, n=20, men 10, mean age 62 years) and patients not using statins (Group B, n=30, men 15, mean age 60 years).", 
    "74": "Baseline levels of inflammatory markers were similar in the two groups. However, 24 h after coronary stenting, serum levels of CRP (2.00 vs. 4.63 mg/l, p < 0.05), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (217 vs. 261 ng/ml, p < 0.01), and anti-oxLDL Ab (8.97 vs. 12.96 U/ml, p < 0.05) were significantly higher in Group B than in Group A. Furthermore, 72 h after coronary stenting, serum levels of CRP (3.00 vs. 5.50 mg/l, p < 0.01) and ICAM-1 (222 vs. 277 ng/ml, p < 0.05) were significantly higher in Group B than in Group A.", 
    "75": "Preexisting statin therapy plays a role in reducing the serum levels of CRP, ICAM-1, and anti-oxLDL Ab after coronary stenting in patients with unstable angina. These data support an anti-inflammatory or plaque-stabilizing effect of statin therapy.", 
    "76": "Statins may reduce cardiovascular risk via mechanisms other than cholesterol reduction alone. This decrease in risk may in part be secondary to pleiotropic effects such as decreased inflammation and improved endothelial function. Statin therapy has been shown to affect the levels of certain plasma markers of inflammation, markers which are predictive of cardiovascular risk and may also play a role in the disease process. This article will review the relationship between inflammatory markers and cardiovascular disease risk and the effects of statins on these markers in subjects without a known history of coronary disease.", 
    "77": "The National Cholesterol Education Program NCEP has recently updated their Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III guidelines and called for more intensive cholesterol treatment, especially in patients at high risk for coronary heart disease CHD. The message from the updated report is that lower is better for high risk patients, with the NCEP expert panel calling for low-density lipoprotein LDL- cholesterol treatment targets of <100 mg/dL in patients at high risk for CHD. In very high risk patients, however, aggressively lowering LDL-cholesterol to <70 mg/dL is now a therapeutic option for clinicians. Very high risk individuals are those with cardiovascular disease plus diabetes, persistent cigarette smoking, poorly controlled hypertension, or multiple risk factors of the metabolic syndrome, and those who recently had a myocardial infarction MI. Despite the strong clinical evidence and widely publicized treatment guidelines, many hyperlipidemic patients receive inadequate lipid-lowering treatment or leave the hospital after having a MI without a statin. Intensive therapy should be considered for all patients admitted to the hospital for acute coronary syndrome. Achieving very low levels of LDL-cholesterol often requires high doses of a statin or a combination therapy. The coadministration of ezetimibe, a new cholesterol-absorption inhibitor, further reduced LDL-cholesterol by 23% compared with those patients who remained on statin therapy alone. Recent trials with statin therapy are discussed in this review.", 
    "78": "Previous trials have demonstrated that lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels below currently recommended levels is beneficial in patients with acute coronary syndromes. We prospectively assessed the efficacy and safety of lowering LDL cholesterol levels below 100 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol per liter) in patients with stable coronary heart disease (CHD).", 
    "79": "A total of 10,001 patients with clinically evident CHD and LDL cholesterol levels of less than 130 mg per deciliter (3.4 mmol per liter) were randomly assigned to double-blind therapy and received either 10 mg or 80 mg of atorvastatin per day. Patients were followed for a median of 4.9 years. The primary end point was the occurrence of a first major cardiovascular event, defined as death from CHD, nonfatal non-procedure-related myocardial infarction, resuscitation after cardiac arrest, or fatal or nonfatal stroke.", 
    "80": "The mean LDL cholesterol levels were 77 mg per deciliter (2.0 mmol per liter) during treatment with 80 mg of atorvastatin and 101 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol per liter) during treatment with 10 mg of atorvastatin. The incidence of persistent elevations in liver aminotransferase levels was 0.2 percent in the group given 10 mg of atorvastatin and 1.2 percent in the group given 80 mg of atorvastatin (P<0.001). A primary event occurred in 434 patients (8.7 percent) receiving 80 mg of atorvastatin, as compared with 548 patients (10.9 percent) receiving 10 mg of atorvastatin, representing an absolute reduction in the rate of major cardiovascular events of 2.2 percent and a 22 percent relative reduction in risk (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.69 to 0.89; P<0.001). There was no difference between the two treatment groups in overall mortality.", 
    "81": "Intensive lipid-lowering therapy with 80 mg of atorvastatin per day in patients with stable CHD provides significant clinical benefit beyond that afforded by treatment with 10 mg of atorvastatin per day. This occurred with a greater incidence of elevated aminotransferase levels.", 
    "82": "Lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR), is used therapeutically to lower plasma cholesterol levels and has garnered attention for its cytotoxic effects in leukemia cells. In this study, escalating doses of lovastatin were administered to nine patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. Peripheral blood leukemia cells were drawn pre- and post-lovastatin dosing. Plasma lovastatin bioactivity ranged up to 234 nM lovastatin equivalents. Our results show that in vivo lovastatin, at up to 200 mg/dose, induces an increased activity of leukemia cell HMGR and alters leukemia cell proliferation without discernibly altering Ras processing.", 
    "83": "Besides aspirin several new drugs for inhibition of platelet aggregation and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibition are used in secondary stroke prevention. Pharmacology and clinical effects, however, are not fully explained by current understanding of underlying mechanisms. Population spike amplitude (PSAP), an established marker of slice integrity, was measured during hypoxia and recovery thereof in hippocampal slices from control CD1 mice (25-35 g) and animals pretreated in vivo with a single i.p. injection of clopidogrel, ticlopidine, or atorvastatine at different time intervals and dosages. Posthypoxic recovery of PSAP was 20 +/- 35% in control CD1 mice. Upon pretreatment with clopidogrel (1-24 h, 0.5-2 mg/kg body weight) an increase up to 81 +/- 20% (p < 0.01 to control) was observed at 1h interval and 1mg/kg. Application of ticlopidine (1-24 h, 1-4 mg/kg body weight) resulted in an improvement of posthypoxic recovery to 61 +/- 41% (p < 0.05 to control) while administration of atorvastatine (1-24 h, 1-4 mg/kg body weight) caused an increase up to 87 +/- 31% (p < 0.01 to control) at 1h interval and 2 mg/kg. On application of these substances in vitro the NADH autofluorescence spectrum in hippocampal slices is blue-shifted suggesting an alteration of oxidative metabolism. The present data demonstrate a shared neuroprotective effect of agents known to inhibit platelets (acetylsalicylic acid, clopidogrel, and ticlopidine) and HMG-CoA reductase (atorvastatine). The time course of this neuroprotective action in the current experimental study (onset within an hour, duration of several hours in contrast to several days) resembles clinical practice in dosing these substances. We hypothesize that an increase of hypoxic tolerance resulting from mild mitochondrial inhibition by these substances is a principal constituent of the effectiveness of these drugs.", 
    "84": "Patients with CKD are at high risk for developing CVD. In fact, most CKD patients have a 10-year risk of coronary heart disease events greater than or equal to 20%, placing them in the highest risk category according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. For this reason, the National Kidney Foundation K/DOQI guidelines for managing dyslipidemia suggest that CKD patients with LDL greater than or equal to 100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L) should be treated with diet and a statin. The K/DOQI guidelines also make it clear that the evidence supporting treatment in CKD populations is lacking however, and that additional placebo-controlled trials are needed. In the mean time, the high incidence of CVD makes intensive monitoring and treatment of dyslipidemias in patients with CKD a reasonable clinical approach.", 
    "85": "The aim of this work was the evaluation of the existent drug interaction alert structure in Spain, which is based on yellow cards notifications and circulation of drug alert letters, through the retrospective analysis of CYP3A-metabolized statins and macrolides co-prescriptions in the Spanish province of Badajoz between May and September 2001. The period of study was planned to include the release of 2 drug alert letters released by the Spanish Drug Agency in June and July, addressed to all healthcare professionals, which warned against the concomitant prescription of statins and inhibitors of their metabolism, e.g. macrolides antibacterials. 4,600,764 prescriptions were examined, 664 of which corresponded to combinations of statins and macrolides. Although a decrease was detected in the number of these co-prescriptions throughout the study, 80 of these corresponding to 67 patients were still being prescribed in September, after the warnings by the Spanish Drug Agency had been released. 431 physicians prescribed these drugs simultaneously, with 22.9% of them having more than one patient at potential risk. Doctors working at rural healthcare centres or not directly attached to any healthcare facility were more prone to prescribe unsafe coprescriptions than those working at urban health centre. This study shows that the present drug alert system is not fully efficient when facing a situation like the one retrospectively reviewed in this study, in which a prompt action, in this case termination of potentially hazardous coprescriptions, was required. New systems developed to improve prescribing, including a new method based on personal contact between Drug Surveillance Centres and general practitioners, are discussed.",

    "88": "Overall, 448 patients with chronic kidney disease were randomly assigned (242 predialysis patients with a creatinine level > or = 1.7 mg/dL [> or =150 micromol/L], 73 patients on dialysis therapy, and 133 patients with a functioning transplant). Compliance with study treatments was 80% at 12 months. Allocation to treatment with 100 mg of aspirin daily was not associated with an excess of major bleeds (aspirin, 4 of 225 patients [2%] versus placebo, 6 of 223 patients [3%]; P = not significant [NS]), although there was a 3-fold excess of minor bleeds (34 of 225 [15%] versus 12 of 223 patients [5%]; P = 0.001). Among those with predialysis renal failure or a functioning transplant at baseline, aspirin did not increase the number of patients who progressed to dialysis therapy (7 of 187 [4%] versus 6 of 188 patients [3%]; P = NS) or experienced a greater than 20% increase in creatinine level (63 of 187 patients [34%] versus 56 of 188 patients [30%]; P = NS). After 12 months of follow-up, allocation to 20 mg of simvastatin daily reduced nonfasting total cholesterol levels by 18% (simvastatin, 163 mg/dL [4.22 mmol/L] versus placebo, 196 mg/dL [5.08 mmol/L]; P < 0.0001), directly measured low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 24% (89 mg/dL [2.31 mmol/L] versus 114 mg/dL [2.96 mmol/L]; P < 0.0001), and triglyceride levels by 13% (166 mg/dL [1.87 mmol/L] versus 186 mg/dL [2.10 mmol/L]; P < 0.01), but there was no significant effect on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (2% increase; P = NS). Allocation to simvastatin therapy was not associated with excess risk for abnormal liver function test results or elevated creatine kinase levels.", 
    "89": "During a 1-year treatment period, simvastatin, 20 mg/d, produced a sustained reduction of approximately one quarter in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, with no evidence of toxicity, and aspirin, 100 mg/d, did not substantially increase the risk for a major bleeding episode. Much larger trials are now needed to assess whether these treatments can prevent vascular events.", 
    "90": "Identification and management of dyslipidemia is an important element in the multi-factorial approach to prevent coronary heart disease. Diabetic dyslipidemia typically consists of elevated triglyceride, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, predominance of small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, and average LDL cholesterol (LDL-C). Lipid-lowering therapy has a beneficial effect on cardiovascular outcomes. Statin treatment is beneficial in patients who are older than 40 years of age, irrespective of the LDL-C value. To achieve lipid targets, attention should be directed first toward nonpharmacologic therapeutic interventions, such as diet, exercise, smoking cessation, weight loss, and improving glycemic control. Although statin therapy is recommended for most subjects, judicious use of combination therapy should be considered in the highest risk subjects.", 
    "91": "Statin drugs represent the major improvement in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia that constitutes the main origin of atherosclerosis, leading to coronary heart disease. Besides tremendous beneficial effects of statins, various forms of muscular toxicity (myalgia, cramp, exercise intolerance, and fatigability) occur frequently. We hypothesized that the iatrogenic effects of statins could result from alterations in Ca(2+) homeostasis. Acute applications of simvastatin on human skeletal muscle fibers triggered a Ca(2+) wave of intra-cellular Ca(2+) that mostly originates from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-release. In addition, simvastatin increased mitochondrial NADH content and induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization (EC(50)=1.96 microM) suggesting an altered mitochondrial function. Consequently on simvastatin application, a weak mitochondrial Ca(2+) efflux (EC(50)=7.8 microM) through permeability transient pore and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger was triggered, preceding the large SR-Ca(2+) release. Increased SR Ca(2+) content after acute application of statin is also suggested by the increased Ca(2+) spark amplitude and by the effect of cyclopiazonic acid. We thus conclude that simvastatin induced alterations in mitochondrial function which lead to an increase in cytoplasmic Ca(2+), SR-Ca(2+) overload, and Ca(2+) waves. Taken together, these statin-induced muscle dysregulations may contribute to myotoxicity.", 
    "92": "Lipid lowering therapy with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors is increasingly used for the prevention of cardiovascular events, but they should be used with caution in patients with impaired liver function. We therefore studied the pharmacokinetics of pitavastatin in patients with liver cirrhosis.", 
    "93": "Plasma concentrations of pitavastatin were determined after administration of 2 mg single-dose pitavastatin to 12 male patients with liver cirrhosis (six Child-Pugh grade A and six grade B).

    "96": "This study was carried out to investigate the modulation of detoxicant enzyme activity and plasma lipidemic levels by 150 kDa glycoprotein isolated from Solanum nigrum Linne (SNL), which has been used as a hepatoprotective and anticancer agent in folk medicine. Our results in this study showed that SNL glycoprotein has a band with 150 kDa on the 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel, and that it has a strong scavenging activity against lipid peroxyl radicals. We also evaluated the lipidemic levels of SNL glycoprotein, based on lipoproteins and activities of detoxicant enzymes in treatment with Triton WR-1339 or corn oil in vivo. When mice were treated with either Triton WR-1339 or corn oil in the absence of SNL glycoprotein, the number of plasma lipoproteins [triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC) and low density lipoprotein (LDL)] increased. However, when the mice were treated with either Triton WR-1339 or corn oil in the presence of SNL glycoprotein, the plasma lipoprotein levels (TG, TC and LDL) were significantly reduced. Similar results of SNL glycoprotein treatment were also produced in the activities of detoxicant enzymes. Namely, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were remarkably increased after treatment with SNL glycoprotein. In addition, the activity of hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase was reduced by SNL glycoprotein in cholestyramine-treated mice. For example, we found that it inhibits the activity of cholestyramine-induced hepatic HMG-CoA reductase at 40 microg head body weight g(-1) SNL glycoprotein. Collectively, these results pointed out that SNL glycoprotein can enhance the activities of detoxicant enzymes and bring about the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity in vivo. Therefore, we speculate that SNL glycoprotein can be used as a cholesterol-lowering agent even at low concentrations.", 
    "97": "Age-related macular degeneration is a progressive late onset disease affecting central vision. It is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in developed countries, and with the aging population the problem is increasing. Current treatment options are limited to the late stage of the disease when central vision is already under great threat, and even new treatments make little impact on the rate of blindness. Intervention earlier in the disease may prove more rewarding, but to date little progress has been made with this approach. Epidemiologic, genetic, and pathological evidence continues to accumulate, suggesting a possible link between risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and age-related macular degeneration. This article reviews the evidence and discusses the rationale behind the recent suggestions that cholesterol-lowering agents may be useful in the treatment of early age-related macular degeneration. The cholesterol-lowering family of drugs called statins are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) inhibitors with pleiotropic actions. Their therapeutic effects in cardiovascular disease and dyslipidaemia have been well proven. In this review we will outline the known actions of statins and discuss possible ways that they may impact on age-related macular degeneration.", 
    "98": "Statins [3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors] exert cholesterol-independent pleiotropic effects that include anti-thrombotic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidative properties. Here, we examined direct protective effects of atorvastatin on neurones in different cell damage models in vitro. Primary cortical neurones were pre-treated with atorvastatin and then exposed to (i) glutamate, (ii) oxygen-glucose deprivation or (iii) several apoptosis-inducing compounds. Atorvastatin significantly protected from glutamate-induced excitotoxicity as evidenced by propidium iodide staining, nuclear morphology, release of lactate dehydrogenase, and mitochondrial tetrazolium metabolism, but not from oxygen-glucose deprivation or apoptotic cell death. This anti-excitototoxic effect was evident with 2-4 days pre-treatment but not with daily administration or shorter-term pre-treatment. The protective properties occurred independently of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibition because co-treatment with mevalonate or other isoprenoids did not reverse or attenuate neuroprotection. Atorvastatin attenuated the glutamate-induced increase of intracellular calcium, which was associated with a modulation of NMDA receptor function. Taken together, atorvastatin exerts specific anti-excitotoxic effects independent of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibition, which has potential therapeutic implications.", 
    "99": "Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is essential in atherogenesis. Oxidized lipids regulate MCP-1 expression and release from mononuclear cells. In this study we investigated (1) whether statin therapy reduces lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated MCP-1 production in human whole-blood samples and (2) the relationships between in vitro low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and MCP-1 production. Fasting blood samples were obtained from 55 healthy nonsmoking adults with moderate hypercholesterolemia who were participating in a randomized double-blind 8-week trial comparing the effects of statin therapy with those of placebo on cytokine production. Samples were analyzed for resistance to copper-mediated LDL oxidation (lag time in minutes), as well as MCP-1- and interleukin-8 (IL-8)-stimulated production. Statin therapy reduced MCP-1 production (mean +/- SD) -161 +/- 399 pg/mL/mm 3 white cells) compared with 267 +/- 985 pg/mL/mm 3 in the placebo group, but changes were not different between active and placebo groups ( P = .13). Statin therapy also increased lag times (median [interquartile range]; 20.5 [7.0-51.2] minutes vs -17.0 [-5.3-16.5] minutes; P = .067 for group difference). Inhibition of MCP-1 production correlated with prolongation of lag time ( r = .46, P = .0056) in statin-treated subjects. Statin therapy reduced MCP-1 production in the whole blood of human subjects and these changes were correlated with improvement in LDL oxidative resistance.", 
    "100": "Recently, it has been demonstrated that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG Co-A) reductase inhibitor or statin can regulate the thrombogenesis beyond its lipid lowering effect. In this study, we investigated the beneficial effect of statin to reduce the platelet P-selectin expression in atherosclerotic ischemic stroke. Thirty-two (28 men, 4 women; mean age 59.8 +/- 9.6 years) patients with atherosclerotic ischemic stroke were assigned to receive simvastatin 20 mg per day for 12 weeks and discontinued for another 12 weeks. Then, administration of simvastatin was discontinued for the following 12 weeks. Using whole blood flow cytometry, we evaluated the change of platelet P-selectin expression of all the patients after the 12-weeks use and the 12-weeks discontinuance of simvastatin. The platelet P-selectin expression was significant reduced after treatment of simvastatin 20 mg for 12 weeks (p < 0.001). However, the effect of statin to reduce platelet P-selectin expression disappeared after 12 weeks of cessation of statin. In addition, the P-selectin changes induced by statin were independent of the changes of the LDL cholesterol (r = -0.311, p = 0.386). This study demonstrated that the use of statin might be a helpful add-on therapy to regulate the platelet related thrombogenesis in atherosclerotic ischemic stroke.",

We conducted a systematic review to assess the potential impact of statins on fractures, bone mineral density and bone markers. We searched Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Federal Research in Progress (FEDRIP). Inclusion criteria consisted of human studies with measurable outcomes, which were rated as good or fair according to the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) criteria. The effects of statins on bone mineral density (BMD), bone markers and fracture risk were independently extracted by two reviewers and were combined by use of a random-effects model. The 31 analyzed studies included 24 observational studies and seven randomized controlled trials. Overall, statin use was associated with fewer hip fractures (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.45-0.78) and improved hip BMD (Z score 0.12, 95% CI 0.05-0.19), with a non-significant reduction in vertebral fractures and no effect on vertebral BMD. In subgroup analysis of studies that involved only women there was a reduction in hip fractures (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60-0.95) and improvement in hip BMD (Z score 0.11, 95% CI 0.04-0.18). Vertebral BMD was unchanged, and only one study reported on vertebral fractures, finding improvement. Statins had only small effects on bone markers, with a decrease in alkaline phosphatase [standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.18, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.01], an increase in NTX (SMD 0.39, 95% CI 0.07-0.71), with no effect on osteocalcin or CTX. The statistically significant improvement in hip fracture risk was seen only in case-control trials, not in either the eight prospective trials or the two randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Statins may have a beneficial impact on bone metabolism and fracture risk; randomized controlled trials are needed to explore this association.",

Here we discuss the pharmacology and established uses of statins and in this context describe potential anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory effects. An extensive in vitro data set defines roles for statins in modifying endothelial function, particularly with respect to adhesion molecule expression and apoptosis. Broader effects on leukocyte function have now emerged including altered adhesion molecule expression, cytokine and chemokine release and modulation of development of adaptive immune responses via altered MHC class II upregulation. In vivo data in several inflammatory models, including collagen-induced inflammatory arthritis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, suggest that such effects might have immune-modulatory potential. Finally, a recent clinical trial has demonstrated immunomodulatory effects for statins in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Together with their known vasculoprotective effects, this growing body of evidence provides compelling support for longer-term trials of statin therapy in human disease such as rheumatoid arthritis.",

However, there are conflicting data for their effects on bone remodeling parameters and bone mineral density (BMD). In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of simvastatin on bone metabolism and BMD in subjects with hypercholesterolemia (>240 mg/dl). For this purpose, 32 postmenopausal osteopenic subjects who were given simvastatin treatment (20 mg/day) and not on osteoporosis treatment were included in the study. During the 1-year follow-up period, the total cholesterol level decreased from 262.1+/-30.9 to 202.2+/-30.1 mg/dl (p<0.0001). At a period as early as the 3rd month, levels of the anabolic markers, e.g., bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) and osteocalcin (OCL), were found to be significantly increased (from 120.8+/-56.6 to 149.5+/-57.6 IU/l, p=0.008, and from 20.8+/-12.6 to 34.7+/-18.4 microg/l, p=0.015, respectively) while no significant change was observed in the resorptive marker of serum N-telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX). At the 6th and 12th month, BSAP and OCL were both found to be decreased below the pretreatment values. While a significant reduction was found in BSAP levels (from 120.8+/-56.6 to 55.9+/-18.8 IU/l, p<0.001), no significant change was observed in CTX levels after the 6-month treatment period. Parathyroid hormone showed a gradual profound increase during the follow-up period (from 62.7+/-41.5 to 108.4+/-51.7 pg/ml, p<0.001). No significant change was found in BMD levels at the spine, femoral neck, Ward's triangle, and trochanter at the end of the 1-year follow-up period. In conclusion, simvastatin treatment showed a short-lasting anabolic effect on bone metabolism. However, this effect was lost by prolongation of therapy. The decrease in both anabolic and resorptive markers at the 6th and 12th month suggests that simvastatin affects bone metabolism mostly in favor of inhibition of the bone turnover in a long-term observation period although this inhibitory effect was not reflected in BMD.", 
    "108": "Increasing evidence shows the importance of platelet-endothelial cell interactions in the progression of atherosclerosis. Platelets contribute to coronary events both as major components of thrombi and as a triggering factor in inflammation that leads to plaque vulnerability. Recent data suggest that statins, besides their lipid-lowering properties, exert pleiotropic effects that may be beneficial in atherosclerosis. Whether activated platelets influence cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), the effect of atorvastatin, and possible mechanisms were investigated. COX-2 gene expression in HUVEC was studied using real-time polymerase chain reaction. CD40 ligand surface expression of platelets was tested by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses. Activated platelets significantly up-regulated COX-2 gene expression in HUVEC. Co-incubation of platelets with atorvastatin was shown to reverse this up-regulation via reduction of CD40 ligand surface expression on platelets. Data suggest that atorvastatin influences CD40-CD40-ligand-dependent platelet-endothelial interaction and that this influence affects platelet-induced COX-2 expression in HUVEC.",

Links with hypothesized impairment of serotonin neurotransmission have not been satisfactorily tested. In this investigation, the serum and membrane cholesterol, microviscosity of erythrocyte membranes, platelet serotonin uptake, and clinical parameters were determined during pharmacotherapy of 17 hypercholesterolemic patients. A significant decrease in serum cholesterol and a nonsignificant decrease in membrane cholesterol concentration were found after 2 months of simvastatin therapy. Serotonin transporter (SERT) activity was significantly increased following 1 month of simvastatin; the tendency to decrease the initial increase in SERT activity was evident following 2 months of therapy. Both membrane cholesterol and SERT activity returned to pre-treatment levels after more than 1 year of therapy. Microviscosity of plasma membranes, impulsivity, empathy, adventure, sensation seeking, and depressed mood were not markedly changed. These data indicate that long-term therapy has different effects on serotonin transmission from short-term (1- to 2-month) therapy. A significant increase in SERT activity was detected only during the first month of simvastatin therapy. This finding suggests that within this period some patients could be vulnerable to depression, violence, or suicide.", 
    "115": "A working group from the Adult Treatment Panel III of the national Cholesterol Educational Program issued a revised algorithm for low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol lowering in very high-risk cardiovascular disease patients. The rationale of these recommendations was primarily established from pooled analysis of multiple clinical trials of LDL-cholesterol-lowering therapies and limited data from an acute coronary syndrome trial. In the near future, the findings of these large-scale randomized trials designed to test the hypothesis that more aggressive LDL-cholesterol therapy is accompanied by fewer cardiovascular events than less aggressive LDL-cholesterol lowering therapy, will provide the evidence needed to support or refute these new recommendations. In this article, the authors suggest that an LDL-cholesterol level of less than 70 mg/dl is unattainable and not necessary for many high-risk patients. Furthermore, the potential risks associated with high-dose statin agents in certain patients, such as the elderly, may outweigh these putative benefits.",

Indeed, lipid-modifying drugs - in particular, the statins, which primarily lower plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol - considerably reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, leading to their widespread use. Nevertheless, it seems that there might be limits to the degree of benefit that can be achieved by lowering LDL-cholesterol levels alone, which has led to increased interest in targeting other lipid-related risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. In this article, we first consider the mechanisms that underlie the protective effect of HDL cholesterol, and then discuss several strategies that have recently emerged to increase levels of HDL cholesterol to treat cardiovascular disease, including nuclear receptor modulation, inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein and infusion of apolipoprotein/phospholipid complexes.", 
    "117": "Squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC) and of the cervix (CC) are particularly sensitive to the apoptotic effects of lovastatin in vitro. In this Phase I study, the safety and maximum related dose (MTD) of lovastatin was evaluated in these specific clinical settings. This was a Phase I open-label study to determine the recommended Phase II dose (RPTD) of lovastatin in advanced HNSCC or CC. This study involved a dose and duration escalation of lovastatin starting at 5/mg/kg/day x 2 weeks, every 21 days, until the MTD was reached. Plasma samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis. All 26 patients enrolled were evaluable. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) consisting of reversible muscle toxicity was seen at 10 mg/kg/day x 14 days. Toxicity may be related to relative renal insufficiency. The MTD was determined to be 7.5 mg/kg/day x 21 days, every 28 days. The low lipid levels experienced on study did not translate into adverse events. Biologically relevant plasma lovastatin levels were obtained. No objective responses were seen but the median survival of patients on study was 7.5 months (mean 9.2 +/- 1.5 months). Stable disease (SD) for more than 3 months was seen in 23% of patients. One patient achieved SD and clinical benefit for 14 months on study and a further 23 months off treatment. The disease stabilisation rate of 23% seen in these end-stage patients is encouraging. We conclude that the administration of lovastatin at 7.5 mg/kg/day for 21 consecutive days on a 28-day schedule is well tolerated in patients with good renal function and warrants further clinical evaluation.",

In recent years, evidence has accumulated that statins also exert anti-tumour activity for which numerous potential underlying mechanisms of action have been suggested. Accordingly, several case-control studies showed a reduction in cancer incidence in patients treated with statins. Furthermore, statins interact synergistically with several anti-tumour treatments in preclinical studies. Until now, only a few clinical studies are available that explore the optimal dose, feasibility, and efficacy of statins applied as single agents to control the growth of existing tumours. Studies investigating statins as part of a multi-drug regimen are completely lacking. Nevertheless, the interesting pre-clinical anti-tumour activity of statins combined with a favourable toxicity profile warrant their further development as anti-tumour agents, in particular as part of multi-drug regimens.",

Accordingly, this study was designed to test the lipid-lowering efficacy of a synthetic derivative, 3,4-di(OH)-phenylpropionic (L-leucine) amide (PPLA), in rats fed a high-cholesterol (1%, wt/wt) diet. As such, HC or PPLA was given as supplement to a high-cholesterol diet for 6 weeks at a dose of 0.137 mmol/100 g diet. The supplementation of HC and PPLA significantly lowered the plasma and hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride levels compared to the control group. The activities of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase (164 +/- 9.12 and 124.74 +/- 17.09 pmol/min/mg protein vs. 245.41 +/- 13.01 pmol/min/mg protein, p < 0.05) and ACAT (411.49 +/- 11.48 and 334.35 +/- 17.68 pmol/min/mg protein vs. 490.41 +/- 16.69 pmol/min/mg protein, p < 0.05) were significantly lower in the HC- and PPLA-supplemented groups than in the control group. However, PPLA was more effective in inhibiting the enzyme activities than HC. The excretion of neutral sterol was significantly higher in HC- and PPLA-supplemented groups than in the control group. Therefore, these results indicate that PPLA, a leucine-attached version of HC, exhibited a similar significant hypocholesterolemic effect to HC in rats fed a high-cholesterol diet.",

One patient was treated with pravastatin (20 mg twice daily) and another patient with chenodeoxycholic acid (250 mg tid). Every hour, venous blood and duodenal samples were obtained. Stable-isotope enrichment of neutral and polar sterols in serum and bile was assessed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Isotopomer spectral analysis was performed on cholesterol, lathosterol, Delta-8-cholesterol, methylsterol, and lanosterol. Stable-isotope labeling of cholestanol, bile acids, and bile alcohols was analyzed by assessing the change over time of the ratio of M + 3 to M + 0. Eleven hours after marker infusion, we found up to 50% newly synthesized lathosterol in serum and up to 80% in bile, with similar results for other cholesterol precursors. In cholesterol, stable-isotope labeling could be demonstrated in all study subjects with a more prominent labeling in bile than in serum. No stable-isotope labeling was detected in cholestanol. Only minor stable-isotope incorporation was detectable in polar sterols in some subjects. Therapy with pravastatin did not have any effect on fractional or absolute synthesis rates or on the concentrations of cholestanol or cholesterol precursors compared to untreated patients with CTX. In contrast, therapy with chenodeoxycholic acid markedly lowered the concentrations of cholestanol and cholesterol precursors, led to a disappearance of bile alcohols, and reduced absolute synthesis rates of lathosterol. Isotopomer spectral analysis proved to be a powerful method to assess the endogenous synthesis of cholesterol precursors in patients with CTX. Higher fractional synthesis in bile than in serum may be due to the size of the pools in bile vs serum. Cholestanol exhibits no marker uptake and is therefore probably synthesized from preformed cholesterol. Biliary cholesterol secretion in patients with CTX is decreased compared to healthy controls.",

The probability of goal achievement appears to increase substantially when the MPR is >0.80. Pharmacy records can be used to identify patients who are poorly compliant with statin therapy and at high risk for failure to attain LDL cholesterol goals.

An unintended consequence of the statins is lowering of CoQ-10. As CoQ-10 may play a role in PD, its possible statins may worsen PD. Such a report has appeared. Statins came into wide use in 1997-1998, 6 years before our study began. Thus 74% of our patients on a statin had a PD duration of 1-6 years versus 56% of our patients not on a statin. A direct comparison of patients on a statin and not on a statin would bias the study in favor of the statins: patients on a statin would have a shorter disease duration and less advanced PD. Therefore we divided the patients into two groups. Group I consisted of 128 patients on a statin, and 252 not on a statin who had PD for 1-6 years. In this group, disease severity (Hoehn & Yahr Stage), levodopa dose, Co-enzyme Q10 use, prevalence of 'wearing off', dyskinesia and dementia were similar.

    "141": "Pitavastatin is a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor that is used for suppressing cholesterol biosynthesis. Previously, we have reported that pitavastatin induces the activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and increases nitric oxide (NO) production in vascular endothelial cells (EC). However, the mechanism of eNOS activation by pitavastatin remains unknown. Here, we examined the implications of pitavastatin-induced signaling in eNOS phosphorylation in EC. We found that treatment of EC with a low dose of pitavastatin induced eNOS phosphorylation at Ser-1177, activated Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 in a time-and dose-dependent manner, and increased NO production. These processes were suppressed by the addition of either mevalonic acid (MEV) or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). In addition, northern blot analysis revealed that pitavastatin did not increase eNOS mRNA expression level in EC. These results suggest that the activation of eNOS with a low dose of pitavastatin (0.1 microM) involves phosphoinositide 3-kinase and the Akt pathway and produces NO in EC, which is dependent on post-transcriptional regulation. This pathway is critical for cellular responses that contribute to EC function.",

The proportion of patients with a potential drug-statin interaction was 12.1% for simvastatin, 10.0% for atorvastatin, 3.8% for fluvastatin and 0.3% for pravastatin. Additionally, the program identified 393 potentially critical non-statin DDIs in 288 patients.",

Physicians provided patients' demographic and clinical data, including JAS-defined CHD risk classification coronary risk factors and pre- and posttreatment (after \u22653 months) serum lipid levels, and the types and dosages of drugs in patients' current and prior treatment regimens.

The aims of the present study were to investigate, in the New Zealand genetically hypertensive (GH) rat model, the effects of treatment with simvastatin, alone or in combination with valsartan or enalapril, on blood pressure (BP) and structural remodelling of mesenteric resistance arteries (MRA) and of the basilar artery, an artery that plays a major role in the regulation of cerebral resistance. 2. Genetically hypertensive rats were treated with simvastatin at two dose levels (5 and 10 mg/kg per day) and simvastatin in combination with valsartan or enalapril (also 5 and 10 mg/kg per day) from the age of 7 to 12 weeks. Systolic BP and bodyweight were measured weekly. 3. At the end of the experiment, following fixation by perfusion, MRA and the basilar artery were excised and embedded in Technovit (a glycol methacrylate medium; Heraeus Kulzer, Werheim, Germany). Serial sections were cut and stereological techniques used to determine tunica media width and cross-sectional area (CSA), lumen diameter and the ratio of media width/lumen diameter. 4. Simvastatin monotherapy did not lower BP at either dose. In the high- and low-dose groups, the combination of simvastatin + enalapril lowered BP more than with enalapril alone; this was also true for the simvastatin + valsartan combination in the lower-dose group. 5. The MRA were hypotrophically remodelled by the 10 mg/kg per day dose of simvastatin; the 5 mg/kg per day dose caused hypotrophic remodelling with decreased media/lumen ratio. Valsartan and enalapril caused hypotrophic remodelling together with outward remodelling of the lumen in the 10 mg/kg per day valsartan group and, in all groups, a reduction in the media/lumen ratio, with the greatest effect observed in the high-dose groups. 6. The combination treatments of simvastatin + valsartan and simvastatin + enalapril did not have any consistent extra effect on MRA remodelling. 7. In the basilar artery, high-dose simvastatin had a hypotrophic effect on the media and both doses reduced the media/lumen ratio independently of any change in BP. 8. Simvastatin given in combination with valsartan produced a slight further reduction in medial CSA, media width and ratio. In combination with enalapril, there was little consistent additional effect. 9. Simvastatin monotherapy hypotrophically remodelled the media of the basilar artery in the GH rat model, even in the absence of changes in BP. A similar structural effect may explain, in part, the reduction in stroke seen in patients treated with statins.",

This reflects centuries of training on how to manage patients in the absence of evidence to guide practice. Increasingly disease is becoming susceptible to treatment, requiring a change in the professional approach from the educated, hopeful guess to the application of objective data. Arrogance and certainty, born of ignorance and clutching in desperation at imaginary straws probably still have a place in medicine when conventional treatment has failed, but should play a diminishing role within the medical profession. Epidemiological association is no longer sufficient evidence to conclude that an intervention is effective; with few exceptions, randomised-controlled trials are required. A more successful and objective era of medical practice has arrived. Consequently, a greater degree of scepticism about claims of benefit is also appropriate, which should apply equally to treatments new and old. Of course, no 2 patients are alike, and the evidence-base remains a guide-map on how patients should be treated, rather than a set of rigid rules. Guidelines are guidelines and not infallible, inviolable decrees. In this article, some of the current controversies in the management of heart failure are discussed, ranging from diagnosis, diastolic heart failure, and the role of natriuretic peptides, to the lack of evidence for a clinically-relevant benefit (and therefore possible harm) from aspirin, statins, implantable defibrillators or revascularisation.",

Recent evidence suggests that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) can prevent the progression of vein graft failure. Here we investigated whether statins inhibited MMP-9 secretion from cultured human SV smooth muscle cells (SMC) and examined the underlying mechanisms. SV-SMC from different patients were exposed to phorbol ester (TPA) or PDGF-BB plus interleukin-1alpha (IL-1). MMP-9 secretion and mRNA expression were analyzed using gelatin zymography and RT-PCR, respectively. Specific signal transduction pathways were investigated by immunoblotting and pharmacological inhibition. Simvastatin reduced TPA- and PDGF/IL-1-induced MMP-9 secretion and mRNA levels, effects reversed by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and mimicked by inhibiting Rho geranylgeranylation or Rho-kinase (ROCK). MMP-9 secretion induced by PDGF/IL-1 was mediated via the ERK, p38 MAPK, and NFkappaB pathways, whereas that induced by TPA was mediated specifically via the ERK pathway. Simvastatin failed to inhibit activation of these signaling pathways. Moreover, simvastatin did not affect MMP-9 mRNA stability. Together these data suggest that simvastatin reduces MMP-9 secretion from human SV-SMC by inhibiting the RhoA/ROCK pathway and decreasing MMP-9 mRNA levels independently of effects on signaling pathways required for MMP-9 gene expression.",
