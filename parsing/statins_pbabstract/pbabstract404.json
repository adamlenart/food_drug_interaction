In combination with HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors a mean interval value of -75% for LDL as compared to the starting concentration may be achieved. The treatment has the advantage that the patient is not exposed to foreign proteins or compounds with attendant immunological problems. It displays a high degree of reproducibility and an almost unlimited capacity guaranteeing a constant therapy independent of the clinic performing the treatment. The first coronary angiographies after 2 years of HELP treatment in over 50 patients (to be reported elsewhere) give support to the hope that regression of coronary heart disease is possible in humans. Further studies and observations should eventually tell us at what level of LDL, Lp(a) and fibrinogen this may be expected. We trust that the clinical benefit of this treatment regimen will be substantial for those patients who have problems in clearing LDL from their plasma pool and who are at the same time sensitive to elevated LDL-levels by the development of premature coronary sclerosis.", 
    "1": "Restenosis, the major limitation of balloon angioplasty, is the result of intimal hyperplasia after the procedure. Lovastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) inhibitor, may influence intimal hyperplasia by lowering serum cholesterol and by blocking deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis. To determine whether lovastatin reduces intimal hyperplasia, a prospective, randomized blinded study was performed in 60 atherosclerotic New Zealand White male rabbits. Atherosclerosis was produced by air desiccation injury followed by a 28 day diet of 2% cholesterol and 6% peanut oil that was terminated before balloon angioplasty was performed. Angioplasty could not be performed in 14 rabbits with bilateral femoral artery occlusion, and in one rabbit the procedure was a technical failure. Forty-five rabbits underwent balloon angioplasty performed with use of a 2.5-mm balloon inflated to 10 atm for three 1 min dilations at 1 min intervals. Seven rabbits died during the procedure. Thirty-eight rabbits were randomized to either a lovastatin group (6 mg/kg body weight per day) or a control group. Angioplasty was performed on all patent vessels (n = 54); the procedure was bilateral in 16 rabbits and unilateral in 22. Fifteen lovastatin-treated and 15 control rabbits survived 39 days after angioplasty and were then killed. Angiograms, obtained before and 10 min and 39 days after balloon angioplasty, were read with use of electronic calipers by two observers who had no knowledge of treatment data. After the rabbits were killed, vessels were pressure perfused using a standardized protocol to maintain in vivo dimensions for blinded quantitative histologic analysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "2": "The present study examined whether hypolipidemic therapy with a potent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, pravastatin, influences corticosteroid metabolism in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Urinary excretion of tetrahydrocortisone, tetrahydrocortisol, 6 beta-hydroxycortisol and free cortisol were determined in 22 patients with heterozygous FH before and after pravastatin administration (10 mg/day for 2 months). Pravastatin induced a statistically significant decrease in serum total cholesterol in patients with heterozygous FH from 6.9 +/- 0.1 to 5.9 +/- 0.1 mmol/l (p less than 0.05). No significant changes were seen in the urinary tetrahydrocortisone, tetrahydrocortisol and free cortisol levels before and after pravastatin therapy. Urinary excretion of 6 beta-hydroxycortisol was significantly (p less than 0.05) increased after pravastatin administration. These results suggest that the hypolipidemic effect of pravastatin in patients with heterozygous FH does not influence the corticosteroid metabolism. The increase in urinary 6 beta-hydroxycortisol may be caused by pravastatin-induced hepatic microsomal 6 beta-hydroxylase induction.", 
    "3": "The effects of an associated treatment with Ciprofibrate and Simvastatin upon plasma lipid parameters, liver Mixed Function Oxidases enzymes and peroxisomal markers have been studied in male Wistar rats. The association was efficient upon triglycerides, but not upon cholesterol. The inducive and proliferative effects commonly exerted by Ciprofibrate (5 mg/kg/day) were not significantly modified by the simultaneous treatment with Simvastatin (10 mg/kg/day). The increase of the seric alanine amino transferase activity was however much more pronounced after the associated treatment than after single administration of Ciprofibrate or Simvastatin.", 
    "4": "During the last few years an increased interest has been directed towards the application of a new class of cholesterol lowering substances, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Since preclinical trials with beagle dogs revealed lens opacifications, the necessity of drug safety studies arose. The paper presents the results of two drug safety studies concerning Simvastatin (45 patients) and Pravastatin (35 patients) after an application period of two years in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia type II. Besides ophthalmological examinations (every 6 month) Scheimpflug photographs of the anterior eye segment have been taken and the negatives subjected to microdensitometric image analysis. Neither the clinical parameters nor the results of Scheimpflug measurement showed drug induced changes at the eye until now. Based on these results cataractogenic side effects of the substances in question could not be proven.", 
    "5": "Simvastatin and bezafibrate actions on blood lipids and their side effects were compared in a double-blind trial involving 24 adults with severe type IIa or IIb primary hypercholesterolemia (mean plasma cholesterol = 4.35 g/l). During a 12-week period, the patients received either bezafibrate, 600 mg 3 times a day, or simvastatin, 10 or 20 mg once a day, with a doubling of the dosage at week 6 if the LDL-cholesterol level remained above 1.40 g/l. Simvastatin significantly reduced LDL-cholesterol by -39.5% (p less than 0.001), total cholesterol by 33.9% (p less than 0.005) and apoprotein B by -28% (p less than 0.001). Bezafibrate significantly reduced LDL-cholesterol (-19.8%, p less than 0.001) and total cholesterol (-17.5%, p less than 0.002), but not apoprotein B. Bezafibrate also reduced triglycerides by -26.6% and raised HDL-cholesterol by +27.6%. Simvastatin was more effective than bezafibrate in lowering LDL-cholesterol (p less than 0.002), total cholesterol (p less than 0.005) and apoprotein B (p less than 0.05). Tolerance of both drugs was considered excellent.", 
    "6": "The cholesterol requirements of the lens for the formation of plasma membranes are met by self-synthesis only until early postnatal life. This ability subsequently decreases with increasing age and probably ceases altogether. The cholesterol supply then has to come from exogenous sources. These findings are of great importance for the qualitative assessment of extrahepatic side effects of HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors given for disturbances of lens transparency. The observation of cataracts in chronic toxicity tests with high doses in beagle dogs suggested that the lens enzyme was also affected by the inhibitor, thus causing cataracts. In contrast to other workers' results, we did not find any activity of HMG-CoA-reductase in our experiments with calf, bovine, dog and rat lenses. Preliminary studies with bovine eyes demonstrate a direct correlation between the cholesterol serum level and the content of the aqueous humor. This shows the importance of the exogenous supply for the lens requirements. A further strong argument is that the use of HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors in patients with pathologically increased cholesterol level is safe as far as the lens transparency is concerned, as demonstrated in clinical trials.", 
    "7": "Female Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with either simvastatin (a novel competitive inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase) or phenobarbital (positive control) to ascertain the possible relationship between the effects of simvastatin on hepatic metabolism and the thyroid hypertrophy and follicular cell adenomas which it produces in this strain of rat. The test compounds were administered orally at doses of 100 mg/kg (divided doses at 50 mg/kg, b.i.d.). (This dose of simvastatin represents approximately 250 times the human dose.) After 5 weeks of treatment, either simvastatin or phenobarbital produced significant increases (35% and 39% above control, respectively) in serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), a significant increase (39% and 120% above control, respectively) in the systemic clearance of 125I-thyroxine, and slight decreases in serum thyroxine levels. Statistically significant increases in liver and thyroid weights were associated with phenobarbital treatment. With simvastatin, increased liver weights occurred. At the microscopic level, thyroid hypertrophy was observed in all phenobarbital-treated rats and to a lesser degree in most simvastatin-treated animals. Simvastatin did not markedly alter liver microsomal enzyme activities with the exception of the anticipated induction of HMG CoA reductase (which increased approximately 4.4-fold). Conversely, phenobarbital produced large increases in liver microsomal enzymes, including glucuronosyl transferase, but did not affect the activity of HMG CoA reductase. Therefore, the increased clearance of thyroxine in simvastatin-treated female rats was not associated with enzyme induction but may have been related to the increase in functional liver mass produced by this compound at this dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "8": "Lovastatin is an inhibitor of HMG-Co A reductase, a key enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. It is of therapeutic value in hypercholesterolemia type IIa and leads to decreased levels of low-density lipoproteins in serum. Treatment with high doses of lovastatin has been reported to induce cataract formation in dogs. The goal of the ongoing prospective clinical study is to evaluate whether cataract formation is caused in humans by therapeutic doses of lovastatin. So far 28 patients (average age 44 years) suffering from hypercholsterolemia have entered the study. Besides thorough slit-lamp investigations in all patients, best corrected visual acuity and contrast sensitivity for five different spatial frequencies were measured. A reduction in contrast sensitivity is a sensitive indicator for opacities of lens and cornea. During a mean follow-up of 37 weeks (range 5-62 weeks) with a mean total dose of 15 g (range 2-26 g), no cataract formation or decreased contrast sensitivity has so far been observed.", 
    "9": "The regulation of cholesterol uptake and secretion by acylcoenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) was investigated in the human intestinal cell line, CaCo-2. A new ACAT inhibitor, PD128042 (CI-976), was first characterized. The addition of the fatty acid anilide to membranes prepared from CaCo-2 cells inhibited ACAT activity without altering the activities of HMG-CoA reductase, fatty acid Co-A hydrolase, or triglyceride synthetase. PD128042 was a competitive inhibitor of ACAT with 50% inhibition occurring at a concentration of 0.2 micrograms/mL. When added to the medium of CaCo-2 cells at a concentration of 5 micrograms/mL, PD128042 inhibited oleate incorporation into cholesteryl oleate by 92% and increased oleate incorporation into triglycerides and phospholipids by 51% and 38%, respectively. After incubating CaCo-2 cells with the ACAT inhibitor, the rate of newly synthesized cholesterol decreased by 75% and membranes prepared from these cells contained significantly less HMG-CoA reductase activity. PD128042 significantly decreased the basolateral secretion of newly synthesized cholesteryl esters without affecting the secretion of newly synthesized triglycerides or phospholipids. The inhibitor decreased the esterification of labeled exogenous cholesterol which was taken up by the cell from bile salt micelles. Moreover, after 16 hr of ACAT inhibition, less labeled unesterified micellar cholesterol was associated with the cell. The esterification of cholesterol in CaCo-2 cells plays an integral role in the uptake of cholesterol through the apical membrane and its eventual secretion at the basolateral membrane.", 
    "10": "The level of hepatic triglyceride lipase (H-TGL) synthesis and secretion was examined in response to changes in cholesterol biosynthesis in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2. Cells were first fed a lipoprotein-deficient serum-supplemented medium to eliminate exogenous cholesterol. Mevinolin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, was then added at a concentration (37 microM) which inhibited cholesterol biosynthesis by greater than 85% and decreased total cell cholesterol from 36.1 to 27.4 micrograms/ml of cell protein. Mevinolin treatment caused a 4.9 +/- 0.8-fold increase in the amount of H-TGL activity secreted into the medium, a 1.8 +/- 0.4-fold rise in H-TGL-specific mRNA, and a concurrent 14-fold increase in HMG-CoA reductase mRNA. Addition of 1 mM mevalonic acid to normal or mevinolin-treated cells raised the cellular cholesterol content and decreased the amount of secreted H-TGL activity to levels below control values. Mevalonic acid also prevented mevinolin-induction of H-TGL and HMG-CoA reductase mRNA, suggesting a common regulatory step for H-TGL and HMG-CoA reductase. Exposure of cells to mevinolin and 25-hydroxycholesterol together resulted in a marked repression of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels, whereas these conditions further enhanced the secretion of H-TGL activity and the expression of H-TGL mRNA. These results demonstrate a differential role for 25-hydroxycholesterol in the regulation of H-TGL and HMG-CoA reductase expression.", 
    "11": "Creatine excretion was measured in two patients with methylmalonic aciduria and two patients with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria. During periods of metabolic decompensation the creatine/creatinine ratio increased and fell during recovery. Prolonged periods of metabolic decompensation may result in the loss of a large proportion of the creatine pool. In one study, measurements of total daily urinary output of metabolites demonstrated that the absolute creatine excretion followed a similar qualitative pattern to the creatine/creatinine ratio. However, apparent fluctuations in methylmalonate excretion when expressed as methylmalonate/creatinine ratio were absent when absolute methylmalonate excretion was calculated. The increased creatine excretion during metabolic perturbations may result from loss from creatine containing tissues such as muscle and may represent an underlying defect in energy metabolism. Alternatively creatine transport may be disrupted by accompanying acidosis. The use of metabolite/creatinine ratios as a measure of metabolite excretion rates during metabolic decompensation whilst qualitatively sound may need a re-appraisal.", 
    "12": "We conducted a randomized, controlled trial in 72 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia to test whether reducing plasma low-density lipoprotein levels by diet and combined drug regimens can induce regression of coronary lesions. Four hundred fifty-seven lesions were measured before and after a 26-month interval by computer-based quantitative angiography. The primary outcome variable was within-patient mean change in percent area stenosis. Mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased from 7.32 +/- 1.5 to 4.45 +/- 1.6 mmol/L. The mean change in percent area stenosis among controls was +0.80, indicating progression, while the mean change for the treatment group was -1.53, indicating regression (P = .039 by two-tailed t test for the difference between groups). Regression among women, analyzed separately, was also significant. The change in percent area stenosis was correlated with low-density lipoprotein levels on trial. We conclude that reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels can induce regression of atherosclerotic lesions of the coronary arteries in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. The anticipation of benefit from treatment applies to women and men alike.", 
    "13": "We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of pharmacologic treatment of high blood cholesterol levels. Agents modeled were cholestyramine, colestipol, gemfibrozil, lovastatin, niacin, and probucol. Pharmacologic effectiveness was estimated from reported studies. Cost estimates reflect societal resource consumption. Annual costs for therapy ranged from $327 (niacin) to $1881 (lovastatin, 80 mg/d). Niacin was the most efficient agent for reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, having an average cost over 5 years of $139 per percent reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level. Lovastatin (20 mg/d) was also efficient ($177 per percent reduction). Cholestyramine was least efficient at $347. For high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, niacin was most efficient, at $116 per percent increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, followed by gemfibrozil at $271. Analyses combining low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol effects suggest that niacin and lovastatin (20 mg/d) were most efficient for reducing cardiovascular risk.", 
    "14": "A chimeric gene consisting of the coding sequence for the membrane domain of the endoplasmic reticulum protein, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, fused to the coding sequence for the soluble enzyme, beta-galactosidase of Escherichia coli, has been previously constructed. This fusion protein, HMGal, has been localized to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum of Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with this chimeric gene, and its beta-galactosidase activity has declined in the presence of low density lipoprotein (Skalnik, D. G., Narita, H., Kent, C., and Simoni, R. D. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6836-6841). In this report, we demonstrate that the loss of beta-galactosidase activity results from the accelerated degradation of the HMGal protein. Taking advantage of a fluorescence-activated cell sorter technique, we have selected transfected cells which express sufficient levels of HMGal to improve its immunodetection. Based on pulse-chase experiments, the half-life of HMGal is 6.0 h, and, in the presence of 20 mM mevalonate, the half-life declines 1.7-fold. Under these conditions, mevalonate accelerates the degradation of HMG-CoA reductase in these cells 1.6-fold, from 8.4 h to 5.3 h, most probably by the same mechanism. This mevalonate-regulated degradation of HMGal is not due to a heteromeric association of HMGal with reductase, since the same effect has been observed in cells lacking the reductase protein. In addition, we demonstrate that inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide abolishes the mevalonate-dependent accelerated degradation of HMGal, in agreement with previous studies which have presented indirect evidence that a short-lived protein is essential for mediating the loss of HMG-CoA reductase activity. Finally, using brefeldin A, we show that the mevalonate-dependent accelerated degradation of HMGal may occur in the endoplasmic reticulum.", 
    "15": "Positive-ion thermospray liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (TSP-LC-MS) is used to detect organic acids via the direct injection of untreated urine from newborns and infants. Two methods are reported for the separation of organic acids. The separation of urinary organic acids is effected in either an acidic, pH 2.5 sulfuric acid, or a non-acidic, 0.05 M ammonium acetate, pH 6.8, mobile phase. Use of pH 2.5 sulfuric acid and an HPX-87H organic acid column produces better separation but has less sensitivity than the use of 0.05 M ammonium acetate, pH 6.8 and a C18 column. Positive ion TSP-LC-MS has been used to detect methylmalonic aciduria, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria, propionic aciduria, isovaleric aciduria and argininosuccinic aciduria.", 
    "16": "The effects of simvastatin and fenofibrate on blood lipids and the side-effects of these two drugs were compared in a double-blind trial involving 184 adults with primary hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol levels: 3.87 +/- 1.02 g/l in the simvastatin group, 3.78 +/- 0.79 g/l in the fenofibrate group; N.S.). During a 10-week period, the patients received either fenofibrate 200 mg twice daily or simvastatin 20 mg once daily with doubling of the dosage at week 6 if the LDL-cholesterol level remained above 1.40 g/l. Simvastatin significantly (P less than 0.01) reduced total cholesterol by -29.9 percent, LDL-cholesterol by -35.4 percent, apoprotein B by -27.3 percent and triglycerides by -16.7 percent. Fenofibrate significantly (P less than 0.01) reduced total cholesterol by -19.2 percent, LDL-cholesterol by -22.3 percent apoprotein B by 13.9 percent and triglycerides by 28.9 percent. Reduction of the first 3 parameters was significantly (P less than 0.01) greater with simvastatin and reduction of triglycerides significantly greater with fenofibrate. Apoprotein A1 levels were increased by fenofibrate (+ 7.4 percent) but not by simvastatin. Side-effects occurred with a frequency of 6 percent under simvastatin and 9 percent under fenofibrate.", 
    "17": "A common pattern of dyslipidemia is elevated levels of plasma triglyceride, borderline high total cholesterol, reduced high-density lipoprotein, and increased apolipoprotein B. This pattern of dyslipidemia frequently is associated with premature coronary heart disease. Nicotinic acid is the drug of first choice for this pattern. In this study, gemfibrozil and lovastatin were compared for their effects on the overall lipoprotein profile in 13 men with this type of dyslipidemia. Both drugs significantly reduced very-low-density lipoprotein and intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and both modestly raised high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Gemfibrozil therapy, however, failed to reduce total cholesterol or total apolipoprotein B levels, whereas lovastatin therapy lowered levels of total cholesterol by 28%, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 33%, and total apolipoprotein B by 32%. Moreover, lovastatin therapy caused greater declines in lipoprotein cholesterol ratios than gemfibrozil therapy. Lovastatin thus seems to have certain advantages over gemfibrozil for treatment of elevated plasma triglyceride levels accompanied by borderline high total cholesterol and raised apolipoprotein B levels; therefore, lovastatin therapy should be considered as one approach for management of this condition.", 
    "18": "Lovastatin, a potent competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase activity, was used to study the regulation of cholesterol metabolism and the basolateral-membrane secretion of triacylglycerol and cholesterol in the human intestinal cell line CaCo-2. At 0.1 microgram/ml, lovastatin decreased 3H2O incorporation into cholesterol by 71%. In membranes prepared from cells incubated with lovastatin for 18 h, HMG-CoA reductase activity was induced 4-8-fold. Mevalonolactone prevented this induction. In intact cells, lovastatin (10 micrograms/ml) decreased cholesterol esterification by 50%. The reductase inhibitor decreased membrane acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferase (ACAT) activity by 50% at 5 micrograms/ml. ACAT inhibition by lavastatin was not reversed by adding excess of cholesterol or fatty acyl-CoA to the assay. Lovastatin, in the presence or absence of mevalonolactone, decreased the basolateral secretion of newly synthesized cholesteryl esters and triacylglycerols. Lovastatin also inhibited the esterification of absorbed cholesterol and the secretion of this newly synthesized cholesteryl ester. Lovastatin is a potent inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis in CaCo-2 cells. Moreover, it is a direct inhibitor of ACAT activity, independently of its effect on HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis.", 
    "19": "We report a case of lovastatin-induced rhabdomyolysis and resulting life-threatening renal failure. Lovastatin, a hypocholesterolemic agent, decreases endogenous cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (EC 1.1.1.88). This agent has been implicated in causing rare serious side effects in various clinical settings; however, the mechanism of these adverse reactions is not understood. The clinical course of our patient was characterized by profound muscle weakness with marked increases in serum creatine kinase and myoglobin. Light- and electron-microscopic studies of skeletal muscle of our patient demonstrated a noninflammatory myopathy suggestive of ongoing rhabdomyolysis with vacuolization and focal degeneration of myocytes. The patient's symptoms and the laboratory values referable to rhabdomyolysis resolved after discontinuation of the drug. We speculate that the rhabdomyolysis was due to mitochondrial damage secondary to inadequate synthesis of coenzyme Q and heme A, members of the electron-transport system of the inner mitochondrial membrane.", 
    "20": "2-Hydroxyestradiol (2-OH-E2) stimulates progestin secretion by granulosa cells, but the intracellular locus of the stimulatory effect has not been clarified. The objectives of the present studies were to 1) determine the role of de novo sterol synthesis in the effect of 2-OH-E2 on progestin biosynthesis, and 2) examine the effects of 2-OH-E2 on cholesterol side-chain cleavage (SCC) activity and the level of messenger RNA (mRNA) for P450scc. Inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase with lovastatin (5 micrograms/ml) or mevinolin (5 micrograms/ml) reduced FSH- and 2-OH-E2-stimulated (but not E2-stimulated) progesterone production. Mevalonate (20 mM) enhanced basal progesterone production and reversed the inhibitory effect of lovastatin but did not affect progesterone biosynthesis in the presence of 2-OH-E2. As an index of the activity of cholesterol SCC enzyme, granulosa cells were exposed to 25-hydroxycholesterol (10 micrograms/ml) for 24 h and progesterone secretion monitored. Conversion of 25-hydroxycholesterol into progesterone was stimulated 2- to 3-fold by maximally effective concentrations of 2-OH-E2, E2, and FSH. 2-OH-E2 and/or E2 further enhanced 25-hydroxycholesterol conversion in the presence of FSH, LH, and epinephrine. Aminoglutethimide, an inhibitor of SCC, reduced 2-OH-E2- and 2-OH-E2 plus FSH-stimulated progesterone production by 97% and 95%, respectively. 2-OH-E2 also increased basal (by 2 to 3-fold) and FSH-stimulated (to 3.5-fold of FSH-treated controls) levels of mRNA for cytochrome P450scc. Collectively, our studies support the hypothesis that 2-OH-E2-enhanced progesterone biosynthesis by porcine granulosa cells is dependent on de novo cholesterol synthesis and is associated with increased levels of the mRNA encoding cytochrome P-450scc, which leads to increases in basal and gonadotropin-induced SCC activity.", 
    "21": "Whole blood and plasma viscosity, red cell aggregability and deformability, and plasma fibrinogen have been compared between 20 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH), without clinical arterial disease, and 20 age- and sex-matched controls. Plasma fibrinogen was elevated in FH, associated with increased whole blood viscosity at low shear rate, plasma viscosity and red cell aggregation. At high shear rate blood viscosity was not elevated, and red cell deformability was normal. The effect of 12 weeks double blind treatment with cholestyramine 16-24 g/day, pravastatin 20 mg b.i.d. or placebo on blood rheology was studied in 17 FH patients. Mean plasma cholesterol fell significantly by 24.7% with pravastatin and 21.5% with cholestyramine, the latter also causing a significant 42% rise in triglyceride. Pravastatin, but not cholestyramine, caused a significant fall in plasma viscosity and fibrinogen, but no change was seen in whole blood rheology. This suggests that the rheological abnormalities in FH are at least partly related to the plasma lipid levels and hence reversible with treatment.", 
    "22": "This 8-week multicenter, placebo-controlled trial compared the efficacy and safety of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, pravastatin, when administered either as single doses of 40 mg in the morning (AM) or evening (PM) or 20 mg twice daily (bid) in 196 diet-stabilized outpatients with primary type II hypercholesterolemia. Mean reductions in total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations were observed in all pravastatin groups after 1 week and were sustained throughout the study (P less than or equal to 0.001 versus baseline and placebo). At week 8, mean reductions from baseline in the pravastatin treatment groups were 23-27% for total cholesterol and 30-34% for LDL cholesterol. LDL cholesterol was reduced greater than or equal to 15% by pravastatin in all patients in the group treated with 40 mg PM and in 88 and 96% in those receiving 20 mg bid and 40 mg AM, respectively. High density lipoprotein cholesterol was elevated (up to 8%) and triglycerides were reduced (up to 25%) by all pravastatin regimens (P less than or equal to 0.05). Pravastatin was well tolerated and was associated with a low incidence of adverse events. No patient withdrew from the study due to a pravastatin-related adverse event. Once-daily pravastatin is a safe and effective treatment for patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and has a favorable safety profile.", 
    "23": "Comparison of the Efficacy of Pravastatin and Colestyramine in Hypercholesterolemic Patients. We have treated 55 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, familial combined and polygenic hyperlipoproteinemia in a controlled, randomized study to compare the efficacy of pravastatin (CAS 81093-37-0) and colestyramine (CAS 11041-12-6). After an initial therapy of 8 weeks with 20 mg pravastatin doubling of dose led to an additional decrease of the atherogenic lipid fractions (total cholesterol, TC) 21% versus 25%, LDL-C 26% versus 31%, Apo B 12% versus 17%). After 24 weeks of therapy TC decreased by 28%, LDL-C by 33% and Apo B by 14%. Colestyramine reduced cholesterol in 22 FH patients by mean 18%, LDL-C by mean 28% and Apo B by mean 12%. Both drugs did not differ significantly in their lipid-lowering potential. 16 g colestyramine and 20 mg pravastatin did not change the antiatherogenic lipids and apoproteins (HDL-C, Apo AI and AII), however, with 40 mg pravastatin HDL-C increased significantly by 8.4 to 16.5%. The triglycerides remained constant under colestyramine therapy. Pravastatin lowered serum triglycerides after 16 weeks significantly by 11-16%. Pravastatin had no significant effect on liver and kidney function or muscular metabolism. Under therapy with colestyramine well-known complaints like constipation or flatulence were rarely seen.", 
    "24": "The oral bioavailability of two HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, pravastatin and lovastatin, was investigated in this randomized, two-way crossover study. Twenty healthy men were randomly assigned to treatment with a 40-mg dose of pravastatin or lovastatin once daily for 1 week; steady state kinetics were assessed after the last dose. After 1 week of washout, each subject received the alternate treatment. Serum specimens were assayed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for intact pravastatin or lovastatin acid and by bioassay for active inhibitor concentration and, after hydrolysis of lactones, for total inhibitor concentration. The systemic bioavailabilities of total (active plus potentially active) inhibitors for the two drugs were different, with the mean AUC value for lovastatin being 50% higher than that of pravastatin (mean +/- SEM AUC0-24 values of 285 +/- 25 and 189 +/- 13 ng-equiv x hr/mL, respectively, P less than .0001). Pravastatin, which is administered as the monosodium salt, is present in the systemic circulation as the open acid; lovastatin, which is administered as the lactone, is present as both open-acid active metabolites (62%) and closed-ring lactone metabolites (38%), which are potentially active. Based on mean AUC values, pravastatin accounted for 75% of the active inhibitors from a pravastatin dose. Lovastatin acid accounted for just 25% of the active inhibitors from a lovastatin dose, with the remainder due to other active metabolites. Significant decreases from baseline in total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were observed during the first treatment leg for both pravastatin and lovastatin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "25": "Simvastatin, 10-40 mg/d (n = 11), bezafibrate, 600 mg/d (n = 6), and gemfibrozil, 1200 mg/d (n = 5) were administered for 12 weeks after a 4-week placebo period to subjects with initial plasma levels (mg/100 ml. mean +/- SD) of cholesterol (346 +/- 77), and of triglycerides (180 +/- 54). Total LDL-C plasma concentration was lowered 32% by simvastatin and 35% by bezafibrate, but only bezafibrate diminished the triglyceride (41%) and increased HDL-C plasma levels (35%). Plasma lipoprotein fractions obtained by discontinuous gradient ultracentrifugation, namely, VLDL, lighter LDL (LDL-1), heavier LDL (LDL-2) and bulk HDL were chemically analyzed. Simvastatin and bezafibrate significantly diminished the quantity of VLDL and LDL-1 particles, although barely modifying their composition. Neither drug influenced the LDL-2 plasma concentration. Bezafibrate increased the total plasma HDL level little interfering with its chemical composition.

    "26": "Simvastatin, a potent blood lipid reducer, has been suspected of inducing cataract in dogs. Twenty-nine type II hyperlipidemic patients on simvastatin were followed over 2 years at half-year intervals. A parallel group of sex- and age-matched normolipidemics were followed over a half year. Patients and controls had similar nuclear and cortical lens opacities, and water clefts. Vacuole number did not differ significantly between right and left eyes, nor between nasal and temporal parts of the lenses. General vacuole index (total vacuole number in a patient) for left eyes was analysed further. Controls showed significantly higher indices than patients, for no obvious reason. Indices for controls increased significantly over the half-year test period, and among patients over each half-year interval. The speed of this increase did not differ significantly from that of the controls. Furthermore, the increase was judged to be clinically insignificant. No deleterious effect of simvastatin on the lens could be established.", 
    "27": "Microinjection of the constitutively active recombinant Val-14 p21rho A into Xenopus oocytes induced dramatic morphological changes with redistribution of pigments from the animal pole resulting in spotted oocytes. The effects induced by Val-14 p21rho A were regulated by progesterone in a dose-dependent manner whereas prior ADP-ribosylation of the rho protein blocked its activity. About 30 min after microinjection, p21 rho was associated with the plasma membrane. The membrane association of p21rho and its biological activity were inhibited by lovastatin, an inhibitor of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. The findings suggest that membrane attachment and biological activity of p21rho depend on isoprenylation of the GTP-binding protein.", 
    "28": "The nuclear protein statin, detectable with specific monoclonal antibodies, is found mostly in nonproliferating cells (Wang, E. (1985) J. Cell Biol. 100, 545-551). In the rat liver a 57-kDa protein designated as rat liver protein 57 (RLp57) was recently identified to carry the epitope for the anti-statin-specific monoclonal antibody, S-44 (Sester, U., Moutsatsos, I. K., and Wang, E. (1989) Exp. Cell Res. 182, 550-558). To characterize further the RLp57 protein, in the present study a polyclonal antibody was raised to the RLp57 protein eluted from polyacrylamide gel. Similar to the anti-statin monoclonal antibody, this polyclonal antibody recognizes a nuclear antigen in nonproliferating fibroblasts and reacts with a 57-kDa protein in rat liver and nonproliferating cells strongly suggesting that RLp57 is a statin protein from rat liver. Two isoforms of RLp57 (isoelectric points between 6.5 and 7.0) were detected after two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. RLp57 was purified using multiple chromatographic steps, including ion-exchange and affinity chromatography followed by chromatofocusing. These results show that RLp57, a statin protein found in liver, has two isoelectric variants and can be purified to apparent homogeneity by sequential steps of chromatographic procedures.", 
    "29": "It has been reported that when 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors are utilized for treatment of hypercholesterolemia, as much as 50% inhibition of whole body cholesterol biosynthesis is observed. As general inhibitors of isoprenoid biosynthesis, these compounds can also inhibit the synthesis of the substituents of isoprenylated proteins. For two mammalian proteins (p21ras and lamin A), it has been demonstrated that such inhibition of biosynthesis of the isoprenoid substituent blocks proteolytic maturation of these proteins. It has been argued that advantage may be taken of this phenomenon to block the synthesis of p21ras in malignancies. It is also possible that treatment of hypercholesterolemia with lovastatin might produce problematic inhibition of protein processing dependent upon isoprenylation. In this report, we compare the concentration dependence of inhibition of isoprenylation dependent protein processing and sterol biosynthesis. Effects of partial inhibition of isoprenylated protein processing on whole cells can be sensitively assessed by visualization of lamina structure through indirect immunofluorescence. Our results indicate that the degree of inhibition of p21ras and prelamin A maturation by lovastatin is identical. Thus, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors are unlikely to be useful as anti-malignancy drugs. However, the conditions of lovastatin treatment which produce 50% inhibition of sterol biosynthesis analogous to pharmacological conditions, produce no observable effects on isoprenylated protein maturation.", 
    "30": "The effect of intensive lipid-lowering therapy on coronary atherosclerosis among men at high risk for cardiovascular events was assessed by quantitative arteriography. Of 146 men no more than 62 years of age who had apolipoprotein B levels greater than or equal to 125 mg per deciliter, documented coronary artery disease, and a family history of vascular disease, 120 completed the 2 1/2-year double-blind study, which included arteriography at base line and after treatment. Patients were given dietary counseling and were randomly assigned to one of three treatments: lovastatin (20 mg twice a day) and colestipol (10 g three times a day); niacin (1 g four times a day) and colestipol (10 g three times a day); or conventional therapy with placebo (or colestipol if the low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol level was elevated).", 
    "31": "The levels of LDL and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol changed only slightly in the conventional-therapy group (mean changes, -7 and +5 percent, respectively), but more substantially among patients treated with lovastatin and colestipol (-46 and +15 percent) or niacin and colestipol (-32 and +43 percent). In the conventional-therapy group, 46 percent of the patients had definite lesion progression (and no regression) in at least one of nine proximal coronary segments; regression was the only change in 11 percent. By comparison, progression (as the only change) was less frequent among patients who received lovastatin and colestipol (21 percent) and those who received niacin and colestipol (25 percent), and regression was more frequent (lovastatin and colestipol, 32 percent; niacin and colestipol, 39 percent; P less than 0.005). Multivariate analysis indicated that a reduction in the level of apolipoprotein B (or LDL cholesterol) and in systolic blood pressure, and an increase in HDL cholesterol correlated independently with regression of coronary lesions. Clinical events (death, myocardial infarction, or revascularization for worsening symptoms) occurred in 10 of 52 patients assigned to conventional therapy, as compared with 3 of 46 assigned to receive lovastatin and colestipol and 2 of 48 assigned to receive niacin and colestipol (relative risk of an event during intensive treatment, 0.27; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.10 to 0.77).",

    "33": "An open clinical trial comprising 59 outpatients with severe hypercholesterolemia (including 35 patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia) and considerable predisposition to ischaemic cardiac disease revealed a dosage-related pronounced effect of lovastatin on serum cholesterol and subfractions of this. After dietary regulation for a period of four months, a decrease in serum cholesterol of 11.7% was observed and after further treatment for six months with lovastatin with an average dose of 59 mg per 24 hours, the serum cholesterol decreased with a total of 45% of original value. Low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol decreased 44% and high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol increased by over 21%. Serum triglyceride fell by 20%. The serum-cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio was reduced from 8.8 to 4.9. Only slight and transient subjective side-effects were observed and none of the patients dropped out of the trial for this reason. One patient with recognized ischaemic heart disease died from myocardial infarction. A tendency towards increasing liver parameters and creatin kinase was observed in the group as a whole but was not significant.", 
    "34": "We studied the short-term effects of simvastatin on lipid variables in 33 dyslipidemic patients without and 18 with diabetes mellitus who were on a lipid-lowering diet for at least 3 months. Six diabetic patients had type I, and 12 had type II diabetes mellitus, of whom 5 were using insulin. In the whole group total cholesterol decreased by 28%, from 9.35 (SD 2.10) mmol/l to 6.69 (SD 1.47) mmol/l after 3 months and 6.60 (SD 1.27) mmol/l after 6 months (mean daily dose of simvastatin 21 (SD 12) mg). Calculated LDL-cholesterol showed a decrease of 38%, HDL-cholesterol increased by 10% and plasma triglycerides decreased by 13%. In patients receiving 10, 20, or 40 mg simvastatin daily, the following changes were observed: total cholesterol -26, -31 and -34% and LDL-cholesterol -37, -38 and -39%, respectively. The effect of simvastatin in the diabetic patients was comparable with that in the non-diabetic individuals, although in the diabetics LDL-cholesterol before therapy was lower, as was the daily dose of simvastatin after 6 months (14 versus 24 mg). In the diabetic patients blood glucose control, measured as HbA1c, was not affected. One patient discontinued therapy because of stomach complaints. Our results show that a low daily dose (10 mg) of simvastatin effectively lowers plasma total and LDL-cholesterol and that the drug can be safely used in diabetic patients.", 
    "35": "We have investigated the effect of six compactin-related compounds--mevinolin, compactin, ML-236A, monacolin X, monacolin L and dihydromonacolin L--on cholesterol synthesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, human small intestine epithelial cells, human hepatoma cell line HEP G2, normal human skin fibroblasts and in skin fibroblasts from a patient with familial homozygous hypercholesterolemia. The inhibition of cholesterol synthesis was found to depend on both the cell type and the type of compound used. The most effective compounds were mevinolin and compactin. Monacolin X, monacolin L and ML-236A were less effective, and dihydromonacolin L was the least efficacious. Endothelial and epithelial cells were sensitive to very low concentrations of inhibitors (IC50 = 1.0-30 pg/mL), HEP G2 cells required higher concentrations (IC50 = 0.01-66 ng/mL) and fibroblasts needed even higher concentrations (IC50 = 0.1-200 ng/mL). Lactone and acid forms of the inhibitors were equally active. None of the inhibitors had any effect on either protein or fatty acid synthesis in any of the cell types studied. It can be concluded that different compactin-related compounds show a range of potencies as cholesterol synthesis inhibitors and a dose-dependent tissue-selectivity.",

    "42": "Lovastatin is clinically used to treat patients with hypercholesterolemia and successfully lowers cholesterol levels. The mechanism of action of lovastatin is inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of cholesterol from acetyl-CoA. Inhibition of this enzyme could also inhibit the intrinsic biosynthesis of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), but there have not been definitive data on whether lovastatin reduces levels of CoQ10 as it does cholesterol. The clinical use of lovastatin is to reduce a risk of cardiac disease, and if lovastatin were to reduce levels of CoQ10, this reduction would constitute a new risk of cardiac disease, since it is established that CoQ10 is indispensable for cardiac function. We have conducted three related protocols to determine whether lovastatin does indeed inhibit the biosynthesis of CoQ10. One protocol was done on rats, and is reported in the preceding paper [Willis, R. A., Folkers, K., Tucker, J. L., Ye, C.-Q., Xia, L.-J. & Tamagawa, H. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87, 8928-8930]. The other two protocols are reported here. One involved patients in a hospital, and the other involved a volunteer who permitted extraordinary monitoring of CoQ10 and cholesterol levels and cardiac function. All data from the three protocols revealed that lovastatin does indeed lower levels of CoQ10. The five hospitalized patients, 43-72 years old, revealed increased cardiac disease from lovastatin, which was life-threatening for patients having class IV cardiomyopathy before lovastatin or after taking lovastatin. Oral administration of CoQ10 increased blood levels of CoQ10 and was generally accompanied by an improvement in cardiac function. Although a successful drug, lovastatin does have side effects, particularly including liver dysfunction, which presumably can be caused by the lovastatin-induced deficiency of CoQ10.", 
    "43": "Lovastatin is used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. It functions by inhibiting the enzyme, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (EC 1.1.1.34), that is required for the conversion of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A to mevalonic acid. Since biosynthesis of both cholesterol and coenzyme Q (CoQ) requires mevalonic acid as a precursor, it was considered that lovastatin therapy would also result in a lowering of cellular CoQ levels. This study was conducted to determine whether lovastatin treatment does decrease CoQ levels and whether such decreases can be prevented by CoQ supplementation. Forty-five adult male Holtzman rats were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. Controls were fed ground laboratory rat chow ad libitum. The other two groups were fed ground laboratory rat chow containing 400 mg of lovastatin per kg of diet ad libitum. One of the lovastatin-fed groups received CoQ10 (15 mg per kg of body weight) daily via stomach intubation. After 4 weeks, samples of heart, liver, and blood were analyzed for CoQ concentrations. Results indicated that CoQ concentrations in all tissues analyzed were decreased in lovastatin-treated rats. Lovastatin-treated animals that were supplemented with CoQ10 had blood, heart, and liver CoQ10 concentrations that approximated or exceeded those of control animals. It is concluded that lovastatin does indeed lower tissue concentrations of CoQ and that a return to normal can be achieved by supplementation with CoQ.", 
    "44": "The activation of human natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity by interleukin 2 (IL-2) is well established, although the biochemical mechanisms of this stimulation have not yet been fully delineated. Earlier, we reported that treatment of NK cells with an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase such as compactin or lovastatin significantly abrogates the in vitro killing of a susceptible human erythroleukemic cell line and that this inhibition can be completely reversed by 2 hr of exposure to mevalonate (J. Cell. Physiology 139:550-557, 1989). We report here that 24 hr of treatment with IL-2 also reverses lovastatin inhibition of NK cell function. In addition to natural cytotoxicity, IL-2 also restores chemotactic and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity functions to lovastatin-treated cells. IL-2 does not stimulate proliferation of these cells during this time period, nor does it affect the phenotypic composition of the NK cell preparations. Although IL-2 was able to reverse the lovastatin-mediated inhibition of every cell function we examined, it had no effect on the inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis as measured by [3H]acetate incorporation into non-saponifiable lipids, nor did it stimulate HMG CoA reductase activity. These findings support the hypothesis that there is a non-sterol isoprenoid product which is required for NK cell cytotoxicity and chemotaxis. In addition, the data suggest that IL-2 stimulation of NK cells proceeds by an isoprenoid-independent pathway.", 
    "45": "Previous studies have shown that topical acetone treatment results in the removal of stratum corneum lipids and disruption of the permeability barrier. This disruption stimulates epidermal lipid synthesis which is associated with the rapid restoration of stratum corneum lipids and barrier function. The aim of this study was to determine the role of cutaneous cholesterol synthesis in the barrier recovery. Here we show that topical lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase, inhibits cholesterol synthesis. After acetone disruption of the barrier, the normal rapid return of cholesterol to the stratum corneum and recovery of barrier function is impaired in animals treated topically with lovastatin. When lovastatin animals are simultaneously treated topically with either mevalonate, the immediate product of HMG CoA reductase, or cholesterol, the final end product of the pathway, the recovery of the barrier is normalized. Lovastatin resulted in the delayed secretion and abnormal appearance of lamellar bodies. These results provide the first evidence demonstrating that cholesterol synthesis is required for the maintenance of barrier structure and function and suggests a crucial role for cholesterol synthesis in allowing for terrestrial existence.", 
    "46": "Two patients who developed hypoprothrombinemia and bleeding due to lovastatin-warfarin drug interaction are described. Because of the wider use of lovastatin and warfarin, heightened clinical awareness of this potentially serious interaction must be publicized. Therefore, prothrombin time should be monitored diligently when warfarin is prescribed to patients receiving lovastatin.", 
    "47": "A series of 9,9-bis(4-fluorophenyl)-3,5-dihydroxy-8-(alkyltetrazol-5-yl)- 6,8-nonadienoic acid derivatives 1 were synthesized and found to inhibit competitively the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. The analogues having 1N-methyltetrazol-5-yl attached to the C8-position (3a, 4a, R1 = R2 = F) are the most active in suppressing cholesterol biosynthesis in both in vitro and in vivo models: the IC50 for the chiral form of 3a is 19 nM, Ki = 4.3 x 10(-9)M when Km for HMG-CoA is 28 x 10(-6) M;1 the ED50 (oral) value corresponding to the lactone derivative (4a, BMY 22089) is approximately 0.1 mg/kg. Further, BMY 21950 is nearly 2 orders of magnitude more active in parenchymal heptaocytes, from which most of the serum cholesterol originates, than in other cell preparations (such as spleen, testes, ileum, adrenal, and ocular lens epithelial cells; Table III). This apparent tissue specificity may be highly beneficial since the blocking of cholesterol biosynthesis in other vital organs could eventually lead to undesirable side effects. In addition to the chemical synthesis and biological evaluation, a theoretical study aimed at relating the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory potency to the three-dimensional structure of the inhibitors was undertaken. With a combination of molecular mapping and 3D-QSAR techniques, it was possible to determine a logical candidate for the conformation of the bound inhibitor and to quantitatively relate inhibitory potency to the shape and size of both the binding site and the C8-substituent.", 
    "48": "The sources of cholesterol for testosterone production were investigated in freshly isolated murine Leydig cells. In vitro stimulation with human CG (hCG) (0.2 IU/ml) caused a 75-fold increase in testosterone production. Leydig cells contained approximately equal amounts of free and esterified cholesterol (7.8 vs. 8.7 micrograms/mg protein). The total cholesterol content of cells stimulated for 4 h with hCG was significantly decreased compared with unstimulated cells (8.4 vs. 17.6 micrograms/mg protein); both free and esterified cholesterol decreased by about 50%. In unstimulated Leydig cells incubated with [14C]acetate for 12 h, the majority of incorporated [14C] was found in free and esterified cholesterol, whereas, in the hCG-stimulated cells, 80% of incorporated 14C was in testosterone. The activity of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase after 4 h in hCG-stimulated cells was 20% higher than in unstimulated cells (115.5 vs. 84.4 pmol/mg protein.min). However, by 6 h, HMG-CoA reductase activity doubled in the hCG-stimulated compared with unstimulated cells. By 12 h, HMG-CoA reductase activity in hCG-stimulated cells was 4 times the preincubation level and 8 times the 12-h level in unstimulated cells. HMG-CoA reductase activity induced by hCG was blocked by aminoglutethimide, an inhibitor of the cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme. Lovastatin, a potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, had no effect on unstimulated or hCG-stimulated testosterone production during a 12-h incubation. Murine high density lipoproteins (mHDL) increased HMG-CoA reductase activity in both unstimulated (29%) and hCG-stimulated (20%) cells. During a 6 h incubation, mHDL increased hCG-stimulated testosterone production by 20%, but had no effect on unstimulated testosterone production. These results suggest that murine Leydig cells store enough cholesterol and cholesteryl esters to support testosterone production for at least 12 h in vitro. Although mHDL does not have a major stimulatory effect on testosterone biosynthesis, it may be involved in the regulation of de novo cholesterol synthesis.", 
    "49": "Hypercholesterolemia occurs in many cardiac transplant patients and may aggravate graft coronary arteriopathy as well as contributing to peripheral vascular disease. Lovastatin, which inhibits 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, in doses of 40-80 mg/day effectively lowers cholesterol in the general cardiac population but has been associated with rhabdomyolysis in cardiac transplant recipients. To determine whether lower doses of lovastatin would be effective and safe for lowering cholesterol after cardiac transplantation, 44 patients with blood cholesterol greater than 200 mg/dl at least 6 months after cardiac transplantation received 10-20 mg lovastatin daily. In addition, lovastatin enzyme inhibitor level was assayed in six patients to determine whether metabolism of the drug was abnormal. Lovastatin decreased total cholesterol by 28% from 282 +/- 54 to 208 +/- 62 mg/dl (p less than 0.005), primarily because of reduction in the low-density lipoprotein fractions, and was well-tolerated without any symptoms or abnormal creatine phosphokinase levels in 43 of 44 patients. One patient developed rhabdomyolysis and reversible renal failure when lovastatin was increased to 40 mg daily. Enzyme inhibitor levels in the six transplant patients were 4.2-7.8 times higher than those measured in normal volunteers. Low-dose lovastatin effectively lowers cholesterol in patients after transplantation, but metabolism is altered, perhaps by cyclosporine. Monitoring of enzyme inhibitor levels may be required to allow safe administration of this drug to cardiac transplant recipients.", 
    "50": "We investigated the regulation of putative high density lipoprotein (HDL) receptors in rat liver after cholesterol feeding and the administration of cholesterol-lowering drugs to rats. The expression of two plasma membrane HDL binding proteins (HB1 and HB2) were compared in control and treated livers by first separating membrane proteins on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and quantitating HB1 and HB2 levels with a specific ligand blot assay. Of the various treatments used, only simvastatin or simvastatin plus cholestyramine produced significant changes, with reductions of up to 40% and 60%, respectively, for HB1 and HB2. The effect on the binding proteins was not associated with changes in serum cholesterol concentrations, which did not change significantly after either treatment, although a marked rise in liver cholesterol concentration after cholesterol was associated with a moderate increase in HB2 expression. We show evidence for regulation of the levels of hepatic HDL binding proteins and provide another important criterion for the acceptance of HB1 and HB2 as components of a functional HDL receptor.", 
    "51": "The effect of lovastatin, simvastatin and pravastatin, which are competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, was tested on PGD synthase purified to apparent homogeneity from the rat brain. Lovastatin and simvastatin, which reportedly cause insomnia in vivo, inhibited the PGD synthase activity dose-dependently and showed an IC50 value of 100 and 75 microM, respectively. On the other hand, pravastatin, which does not cause insomnia, showed no significant effect at 100 microM and only a slight effect up to 500 microM.", 
    "52": "This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response study was conducted in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia to examine the effects of pravastatin, a selective inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, on plasma lipids and lipoproteins. A total of 306 patients on cholesterol-lowering diets received twice daily doses of 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg pravastatin, or placebo for 12 weeks. Marked reductions in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and total cholesterol were observed after 1 week of treatment; maximum lipid-lowering effects occurred at 4 weeks and were sustained for the duration of the trial. At week 12, pravastatin treatment resulted in dose-dependent mean reductions from baseline in LDL cholesterol of 17.5%, 22.9%, and 30.8% for the 3 doses tested (P less than or equal to 0001 compared with baseline and placebo). The reduction in LDL cholesterol was log-linear with respect to dose; each doubling of dose reduced LDL cholesterol an additional 6.5%. Dose-dependent reductions in total cholesterol from 12.9% to 23.3% also occurred (P less than or equal to 0.001). Triglycerides decreased by as 15.4% (P less than or equal to 0.001) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol increased approximately 7% (P less than or equal to 0.01), but these effects were not dose-dependent. No patient receiving pravastatin was discontinued during the 12-week trial. Transient episodes of rash and headache occurred. Slight increases in mean serum levels of ASAT and ALAT occurred, and 2% of both placebo- and pravastatin-treated patients reported myalgia although there was no clinically significant elevation of creatine kinase. These data indicate that pravastatin favorably affects all lipid parameters and is well tolerated.", 
    "53": "The effects of simvastatin (MK-733), a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, on the branched pathway of mevalonate metabolism were studied in Hep G2 cells. The synthesis of cholesterol, ubiquinone and dolichol were examined using various radiolabeled precursors. The effect on DNA synthesis was also determined. MK-733 at a concentration of 1 microM potently inhibited the incorporation of [3H]acetate into cholesterol (84%) without affecting that from [3H]mevalonolactone. Under these conditions, MK-733 reduced the incorporation of L-[14C]tyrosine into ubiquinone slightly (14%), although it did not suppress that from [3H] acetate. The incorporation of [3H]acetate into dolichol was slightly reduced by MK-733. On the contrary, the incorporation of [3H]mevalonolactone into ubiquinone and dolichol was increased by MK-733. This apparent increase in incorporation was thought to be largely due to the higher specific radioactivity of the intracellular pool of mevalonate. The present study demonstrated that MK-733 slightly suppressed the synthesis of ubiquinone and dolichol in Hep G2 cells. However, the extent of their reduction was far less than the effect on cholesterol synthesis, suggesting that there were differences in substrate affinity between the enzymes participating in the cholesterol synthetic pathway and those in the ubiquinone or dolichol synthetic pathway. Furthermore, MK-733 did not affect DNA synthesis even at a concentration of 10 microM.", 
    "54": "Regulation of squalene epoxidase activity was examined in rat hepatic microsomes. The hepatic squalene epoxidase activity was high in the dark period and low in the light period. Three percent cholestyramine feeding increased the hepatic squalene epoxidase activity by 2.5-fold, and the administration of lovastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, increased its activity by 2.1-fold. Co-administration of cholestyramine and lovastatin had a synergistic effect increasing the activity by 7.0-fold. On the other hand, cholesterol feeding reduced hepatic squalene epoxidase activity to 18%. The addition of sodium fluoride, a phosphatase inhibitor, and the treatment of the microsomes with ATP-Mg2+ had no effect on enzyme activity. HMG-CoA reductase activity has been reported to be regulated by cholesterol and unidentified metabolite(s) derived from mevalonate. However, since squalene epoxidase is less responsive than the reductase to the treatment with lovastatin, squalene epoxidase is thought to be regulated only by cholesterol pool.", 
    "55": "To address the possibility that influences other than ambient cholesterol concentrations regulate low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor expression, the effect of mitogenic activation on the levels of LDL receptor mRNA in human lymphocytes was examined. Mitogenic stimulation of freshly isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) cultured in medium containing saturating concentrations of LDL resulted in cell cycle entry as evidenced by increased levels of mRNA for the interleukin-2 receptor, and also increased LDL receptor mRNA levels by 9-fold. Whereas LDL receptor gene expression was also induced when resting control PBMC were incubated in lipoprotein-deficient medium, mitogenic activation of PBMC cultured in the absence of LDL stimulated a further 3-fold increase in LDL receptor mRNA levels. The increase in LDL receptor mRNA levels in mitogen-stimulated PBMC was dependent on continued protein synthesis, was not the result of mRNA stabilization, and therefore most likely reflected enhanced gene transcription. It was unlikely that the increase in LDL receptor mRNA levels observed in mitogen-stimulated cells related merely to sterol deprivation since suppression of endogenous cholesterol synthesis with lovastatin increased LDL receptor mRNA only modestly. Moreover, mitogen-stimulated PBMC continued to synthesize cholesteryl esters, a storage form of cholesterol, confirming that they were not functionally deprived of sterols. Although mitogenic stimulation increased LDL receptor mRNA levels in PBMC, regulation by exogenous LDL was observed. Thus, LDL down-regulated LDL receptor gene expression in both control and mitogen-stimulated PBMC. Down-regulation was less effective in the latter; however, LDL down-regulated endogenous sterol synthesis to an equivalent extent in both control and mitogen-stimulated PBMC. By contrast, the oxygenated sterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, and mevalonate, the precursor of endogenously synthesized sterols, down-regulated LDL receptor mRNA levels comparably in mitogen-stimulated and control PBMC. These data indicate that mitogenic stimulation provides an additional stimulus for LDL receptor gene expression over and above that of ambient sterols and, therefore, suggest that signals transduced during cellular activation play a role in regulation of LDL receptor mRNA levels.", 
    "56": "Regulation of squalene epoxidase in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway was studied in a human hepatoma cell line, HepG2 cells. Since the squalene epoxidase activity in cell homogenates was found to be stimulated by the addition of Triton X-100, enzyme activity was determined in the presence of this detergent. Incubation of HepG2 cells for 18 h with L-654,969, a potent competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, increased squalene epoxidase activity dose-dependently. On the other hand, low density lipoprotein (LDL) and 25-hydroxy-cholesterol decreased the enzyme activity. These results demonstrate that squalene epoxidase is regulated by the concentrations of endogenous and exogenous sterols. The affinity of the enzyme for squalene was not changed by treatment with L-654,969. Cytosolic (S105) fractions, prepared from HepG2 cells treated with or without L-654,969, had no effect on microsomal squalene epoxidase activity of HepG2 cells, in contrast to the stimulating effect of S105 fractions from rat liver homogenate. Mevalonate, LDL, and oxysterol treatment abolished the effect of L-654,969. Simultaneous addition of cycloheximide and actinomycin D also prevented enzyme induction in HepG2 cells. From these results, the change in squalene epoxidase activity is thought to be caused by the change in the amount of enzyme protein. It is further suggested that squalene epoxidase activity is suppressed only by sterols, not by nonsterol derivative(s) of mevalonate, in contrast to the regulation of HMG-CoA reductase.", 
    "57": "Secretion of hepatic apoB lipoproteins removes excess triglyceride from the liver. However, the mechanism by which synthesis of apoB, which occurs on the rough endoplasmic reticulum, is coordinated with synthesis of triglyceride, which takes place in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, is not known. To examine this question, we have manipulated intracellular synthesis of triglyceride and cholesteryl ester in HepG2 cells and determined the impact of these maneuvers on apoB secretion. Since cholesteryl ester is the only major lipid class synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, our hypothesis was that, in response to a fatty acid challenge, synthesis of cholesteryl ester rather than synthesis of triglyceride would be the immediate trigger to apoB secretion. Oleate complexed to bovine serum albumin caused intracellular triglyceride synthesis to increase 6-fold and cholesteryl ester synthesis to increase almost 3-fold, while apoB secretion into the medium increased by 2.5-fold (P less than 0.0125) at all time points between 4 and 24 h. Addition of acylation stimulating protein to the medium further stimulated both triglyceride and cholesteryl ester synthesis (58% and 108%, respectively) above oleate alone and this resulted in a 50% increase in apoB secretion (P less than 0.0025). By contrast, both progesterone and 2-bromooctanoate inhibited triglyceride and cholesteryl ester synthesis and these effects were associated with reduced apoB secretion. Lovastatin inhibited cholesteryl ester synthesis (45%, P less than 0.0025); however, at the doses used, triglyceride formation was unaffected. Under these circumstances, apoB secretion was reduced by 25% (P less than 0.05). Similarly, 58-035 (an inhibitor of acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase) on the one hand reduced cholesteryl ester synthesis markedly (59%, P less than 0.005), but on the other increased triglyceride synthesis though not statistically significantly (65%, P NS), and again this resulted in decreased apoB secretion (25%, P less than 0.005). Control experiments established that changes in low density lipoprotein catabolism did not contribute importantly to the quantity of apoB in the medium. Taken together, the data indicate that, at least in HepG2 cells, there are parallel changes in cholesteryl ester synthesis and apoB secretion and suggest that it is cholesteryl ester synthesis, not triglyceride synthesis, that is the immediate regulator of apoB secretion when these cells are exposed to an increased influx of fatty acids. However, alternative or additional regulatory mechanisms, such as, for example, a role for acylation of apoB, are not excluded by these studies.", 
    "58": "The sterol synthesis inhibitor 6-fluoromevalonate (Fmev) was used to explore the role of mevalonate products in lymphocyte proliferation. Fmev blocks the synthesis of isopentenyl pyrophosphate and all more distal products in the sterol pathway. When cells were cultured in lipoprotein-deficient medium, Fmev (200 microM) completely inhibited mitogen-stimulated human lymphocyte proliferation, quantified by measuring DNA synthesis. The addition of low density lipoprotein (LDL) restored lymphocyte responses to normal, whereas mevalonate was totally ineffective. Similar results were obtained with concentrations of Fmev up to 1 mM. These results contrast with those observed when sterol biosynthesis was blocked with lovastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. When lymphocyte proliferation was blocked with lovastatin (5 microM), either high concentrations of mevalonate or LDL together with low concentrations of mevalonate was required to restore responses. In contrast, neither LDL nor low concentrations of mevalonate when alone was able to restore lymphocyte DNA synthesis in cultures blocked with 5 microM lovastatin. The effect of Fmev on the capacity of exogenous mevalonate to restore proliferation of lovastatin-blocked lymphocytes was directly examined. Fmev had no effect on the capacity of LDL plus low concentrations of mevalonate to restore DNA synthesis to lovastatin-blocked lymphocytes, indicating that the synthesis of the necessary factor from mevalonate was unaltered by Fmev. Fmev profoundly blocked lymphocyte endogenous sterol synthesis, decreasing incorporation of radiolabeled acetate into digitonin-precipitable sterols by up to 98%. LDL did not alter the capacity of Fmev to block sterol synthesis. The possibility that Fmev allowed shunting of endogenous mevalonate into essential lipid products was assessed by examining the incorporation of radiolabeled mevalonate. Fmev (200 microM) inhibited the incorporation of mevalonate into all lipids, including ubiquinone, dolichol, and other non-sterol lipids by up to 98%, and this was not altered by LDL. Furthermore, Fmev (200 microM) suppressed the incorporation of radiolabeled mevalonate into protein by up to 97%. These data confirm that a product of mevalonate is essential for cell proliferation. However, the results indicate that the required product is directly synthesized from mevalonate or mevalonate phosphates rather than from a more distal isoprenoid metabolite.", 
    "59": "The authors have studied a group of 25 patients treated with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor associated with DEAE-dextran, a safe and useful drug for the treatment of dyslipidemia. The patients were selected from a group of subjects previously submitted to long-term treatment with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor only who had failed to achieve normal cholesterol blood levels. The combined treatment with DEAE-dextran (1.5 g 3 times daily) and simvastatin (20 mg once daily) for 90 days lead to a further significant decrease in cholesterol and triglyceride blood levels. These findings confirm the validity of the association of an ion exchange resin with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor in the treatment of refractory dyslipidemias.", 
    "60": "Cultured murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells synthesize a number of low molecular mass GTP-binding proteins that undergo post-translational modification by isoprenoids. We used two-dimensional electrophoresis and immunoblotting to show that a 23-24-kDa protein labeled by the isoprenoid precursor [3H]mevalonate was specifically recognized by an antibody to G25K (Gp), a low molecular mass GTP-binding protein originally purified from placental, platelet, and brain membranes. Several isoelectric variants of G25K were detected in MEL cells, and all were radiolabeled with [3H]mevalonte. The G25K-immunoreactive protein did not cross-react with pan-ras antibody. Although mature p21ras is known to be localized in the cell membrane, most of the isoprenylated G25K was found in the 100,000 x g supernatant fraction when cells were lysed in buffer without detergent. Blocking isoprenoid synthesis by incubation of MEL cells with lovastatin resulted in a decrease in the concentration of G25K in the particulate fraction and a corresponding increase in immunodetectable protein in the soluble fraction. Lovastatin treatment also produced shifts in the electrophoretic mobilities of the G25K isoforms on two-dimensional gels. These observations are consistent with the idea that isoprenylation plays a permissive role in the association of G25K with the cell membrane or other organelles. However, the high proportion of soluble isoprenylated G25K in MEL cells under normal culture conditions suggests that the role of the isoprenoid modification may be more complex than simply serving as a structural anchor for stable insertion of proteins into the lipid bilayer.", 
    "61": "Apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB) is a constituent of low density lipoproteins that has been implicated in the development of coronary artery disease (Editorial (1988) Lancet 1, 1141-1142). It is produced primarily in the liver, but mechanisms of secretory control are unclear. We examined the possibility that rapid reuptake of newly secreted lipoproteins regulates the net output of apoB by cultured liver cells. Polyclonal blocking antibodies to the low density lipoprotein receptor markedly increased apoB output, and varying the width of the unstirred water layer around the cells also changed apoB output, consistent with local reuptake. Labeled apoB added to the bulk fluid phase of the incubation media was not detectably taken up, implying that re-uptake is predominantly local. We conclude that a major site of apoB secretory control resides in the unstirred water layer, external to the cell. Because many cells secrete products for which they possess receptors, local re-uptake from the unstirred water layer may be a general mechanism for secretory control.", 
    "62": "The effects of lovastatin therapy on concentrations and compositions of lipoproteins were examined in 14 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. The drug lowered plasma levels of cholesterol in total plasma, very low density + intermediate density lipoproteins (VLDL + IDL) and low density lipoproteins (LDL) by 25%, 41%, and 41%, respectively. Plasma total apo B was decreased by 35%. Three VLDL subfractions--VLDL-1, VLDL-2, and VLDL-3--of progressively higher density were examined. Lovastatin therapy reduced only the heaviest--VLDL-3. Concentrations of VLDL-1 and VLDL-2 were unchanged. Total VLDL-cholesterol/apo B was reduced significantly. Drug therapy also altered the composition of LDL as shown by decreasing the cholesterol/apo B. Finally, lovastatin significantly raised HDL-cholesterol concentrations. This study showed that lovastatin modifies the composition of the major apo B-containing lipoproteins as well as reducing their concentrations.", 
    "63": "ras p21 must be posttranslationally processed in order to be localized to the inner plasma membrane. The first obligatory processing step is the farnesylation of ras p21. Lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, may prevent the farnesylation of de novo synthesized ras p21. We demonstrate that N-ras oncogene-induced neuronal differentiation of UR61J rat pheochromocytoma cells is blocked by lovastatin. Our data show that this effect is due to the inhibition of ras p21 farnesylation. The results suggest that ras oncogene-induced phenotype in mammalian cells may be eliminated by preventing the proper processing of ras p21.", 
    "64": "We evaluated the effect of cholesterol reduction on atherosclerotic coronary artery lesions using diet and simvastatin, a potent HMG CoA reductase inhibitor. Fifteen subjects aged 28-69 years (mean 44), each of whom demonstrated significant (greater than 50%) narrowing of a coronary artery and a baseline cholesterol level greater than 278 mg/dl, were studied. Coronary arteriography was performed prior to and after 20 +/- 2.5 months of therapy. A 42% reduction in total serum cholesterol, a 52% reduction in LDL cholesterol, and an 87% increase in the HDL/LDL cholesterol ratio (p less than 0.01) were achieved. Pretreatment and posttreatment angiograms were reviewed by three experienced angiographers with temporal order masked. Improvement in the overall status of coronary atherosclerotic lesions was demonstrated in two patients (13%), while deterioration occurred in one patient (7%). No overall change was found in the remaining 12 patients (80%). We conclude that a cholesterol-lowering regimen using a nonatherogenic diet and simvastatin therapy may at least stabilize coronary atherosclerosis.", 
    "65": "Statin is a 57 kDa protein expressed in nuclei of reversibly and irreversibly growth-arrested (Go-phase) cells. In this report, immunohistochemical localization of statin in the developing and aging rat brain was achieved using the monoclonal antibody, S-44. On postnatal day 2, post-migratory neurons in the developing cerebral cortex were statin-positive. Many statin-negative cells were observed in the lateral subependymal zone of the lateral ventricle. By postnatal day 10, most neuronal nuclei were statin-positive although small numbers of statin-negative neurons were still encountered in the lateral subependymal zone and hippocampal dentate gyrus. At 3, 18 and 33 months, all neuronal nuclei surveyed were statin-positive. These results support the contention that, save for the postnatal persistence of 'germinal zones' such as the subependymal region and dentate gyrus, neuronal proliferation in the rat is largely completed by the time of birth. In striking contrast to neuronal statin expression, a significant fraction of neuroglia in both grey and white matter remains statin-negative at all ages examined. In the corpus callosum, 33.2%, 34.0% and 34.7% of glial nuclei were statin-negative at 3, 18 and 33 months, respectively. These findings indicate that: (i) even in senescent brain, the cycling (statin-negative) glial pool is substantially larger than previously surmised from S-phase labeling experiments; and (ii) during aging, the ratio of noncycling-to-cycling neuroglia remains very tightly regulated. Examination of other non-neuronal cell types revealed that most, if not all, ependymal and choroid plexus epithelial cells were statin-positive in the neonatal and adult brains in keeping with the predominantly prenatal proliferation of these tissues. Our results indicate that statin immunolabeling using the S-44 antibody is a powerful technique for the in situ identification of non-proliferating cells in the developing and aging nervous system.", 
    "66": "Patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) have a higher risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease than nondiabetic subjects. In seven patients with both hypercholesterolemia and NIDDM controlled by chlorpropamide, lovastatin (20 mg b.i.d. for 6 weeks) lowered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 28%, total cholesterol by 24%, and apolipoprotein B by 24%. Lovastatin levels for a 4-hour period (measured as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitory activity) were similar to those measured previously in nondiabetic patients. Lovastatin did not alter chlorpropamide kinetics or glycemic profiles. No patient had an elevation in serum transaminases or creatinine phosphokinase, and no patient had any other laboratory or clinical drug-related adverse experience during the study. Lovastatin was as effective in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients with NIDDM as in nondiabetic subjects. Diabetic control was unaltered, and no evidence of alteration in lovastatin or chlorpropamide blood levels was noted.", 
    "67": "The authors developed a direct chemical approach for estimating the rate of turnover of the corneal epithelium in vivo. The method was used to examine the effects of lovastatin, a potent inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis, on proliferation and turnover of the epithelium. Corneal DNA was labeled by pulse injection (IP) of the rat with 3H-thymidine, and 3H-labeled DNA was recovered from peripheral and central corneas over the next 15 days. Only the epithelium became labeled, and the loss of label by cell desquamation began 3 days after injection. The loss of 3H-DNA from the cornea (peripheral plus central region) followed first-order kinetics. The half-life of the disappearance was about 3 days. The peripheral cornea became more highly labeled than the central cornea and began to lose 3H-DNA before the central cornea. These observations support the possibility of a higher mitotic rate in the peripheral region and the centripetal movement of a population of peripheral epithelial cells in the normal cornea. The half-lives of the disappearance of 3H-DNA from peripheral and central corneas measured between days 5 and 15 postinjection were identical, both at 3 days. Complete turnover of the corneal epithelium would, therefore, require about 2 weeks (4-5 half-lives). Treatment of the rat with lovastatin had no obvious effects upon the proliferation or turnover of the corneal epithelium. Although lovastatin inhibited corneal 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, the key regulatory enzyme of cholesterol synthesis, the cornea compensated by induction of this enzyme so that there was no net inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in the cornea.", 
    "68": "The enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA reductase) plays an important role in regulating egg production in the human parasitic trematode Schistosoma mansoni. Infected mice treated with a low dose of mevinolin, an inhibitor of this enzyme, stopped egg production by the parasite and blocked the pathology associated with the infection. As an extension of this work, we exposed adult and developing schistosomes to higher doses of mevinolin for an extended period of time and observed the following: administration of 0.2% mevinolin in the diet of infected mice for 14 days resulted in 96-100% elimination of adult parasites. Administration of the same dose for 2 days before, and for 15 days after infection, resulted in 93-96% reduction of adult parasites. Co-administration of mevinolin with 0.5% mevalonate, but not 0.5% cholesterol, blocked the antischistosomal activity of mevinolin. We monitored schistosomal and mouse liver HMG-CoA reductase activity during the course of treatment and observed that HMG-CoA reductase activity was elevated in the liver but significantly reduced in the parasite. In vitro incubation of paired schistosomes with mevinolin, for up to 11 days, resulted in a dose- and time-dependent reduction of parasite motility and lactate production with eventual death. These in vitro effects were no evident when mevalonate was added to the culture system in place of, or in addition to, mevinolin. Collectively, the evidence suggests that mevalonate and/or metabolite not only plays a vital role in schistosome egg production, but is vital for survival of the parasite.", 
    "69": "Simvastatin (epistatin; synvinolin; MK 733), an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, acts by decreasing cholesterol synthesis and by increasing low density lipoprotein (LDL) catabolism via increased LDL receptor activity. In patients with heterozygous familial and nonfamilial hypercholesterolaemia, orally administered simvastatin 10 to 40mg once daily reduces plasma total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations by about 30 to 45%. It also produces a beneficial moderate decrease in plasma triglycerides and a small, although significant, increase in high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. Like many other hypocholesterolaemic agents simvastatin does not appear useful in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia who lack LDL receptors. The hypocholesterolaemic activity of simvastatin is greater than that of the bile acid sequestrants, probucol and the fibrates. Combined administration of simvastatin with bile acid sequestrants results in further reductions in plasma cholesterol levels beyond those seen with either drug alone. Simvastatin appears well tolerated in the short to medium term, but its long term tolerability needs to be confirmed. No comparisons of simvastatin and other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have been reported. As yet there have been few investigations to determine the impact of simvastatin or other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on cardiovascular events relative to their hypocholesterolaemic effects, but at least one such trial is ongoing. Simvastatin, like other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, has considerable potential advantages over other classes of hypocholesterolaemic agents, i.e. the magnitude of its cholesterol-lowering effect and convenience of administration. If further study confirms long term tolerability and an impact on cardiac mortality and morbidity, then simvastatin and others of its class should offer a significant new approach to the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia.", 
    "70": "The effect of two inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, lovastatin and monacolin L, and an inhibitor of acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), Sandoz compound 58-035, on the interaction of 125I-labeled high density lipoprotein-3 (HDL3) with isolated human enterocytes was studied. Both HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors inhibited cholesterol synthesis and 125I-labeled HDL3 binding and degradation by enterocytes; a strong correlation between changes in cholesterol synthesis and interaction of 125I-labeled HDL3 with cells was observed. Lovastatin caused reduction of the apparent number of 125I-labeled HDL3 binding sites without affecting the binding affinity. No changes of cell cholesterol content were observed after incubation of cells with lovastatin. Mevalonic acid reversed the effect of lovastatin on 125I-labeled HDL3 binding. Lovastatin blocked up-regulation of the HDL receptor in response to loading of cells with nonlipoprotein cholesterol and modified cholesterol-induced changes of 125I-labeled HDL3 degradation. Lovastatin also reduced HDL-mediated efflux of endogenously synthesized cholesterol from enterocytes. The ACAT inhibitor caused a modest increase of 125I-labeled HDL3 binding to enterocytes and significantly decreased its degradation; both effects correlated with inhibition of cholesteryl ester synthesis. The results allow us to assume that the intracellular free cholesterol pool may play a key role in regulation of the HDL receptor.", 
    "71": "Simvastatin is a potent competitive inhibitor of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) which is the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol synthesis. In guinea-pigs, administration of a high oral dose of simvastatin (125 mg/kg/day at the beginning of the study) during 18 days had a major hepatotoxic effect whereas a lower oral dose (30 mg/kg/day) did not seem to cause any liver damage. A significant reduction in microsomal Cyt P 450 content was only observed on a high dose of simvastatin whereas HMG CoA reductase activity was reduced in the group with the low simvastatin dose. The hepatic microsomal aminopyrine N-demethylase activity remained unchanged in all groups. The liver lesion was hepatocellular necrosis accompanied in some animals by a biliary duct proliferation. It was associated with a 10-fold elevation in serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferase activities, as well as a great reduction in daily food intake and body weight (28%). The hepatotoxicity of simvastatin could result from the low basal content of HMG-CoA reductase in guinea-pig liver, the prolonged inhibition of mevalonate synthesis and probably, from the absence of HMG-CoA reductase enzyme de novo synthesis.", 
    "72": "This paper deals with the problems of hypercholesterolaemia in the elderly. We have significant results that show an important relationship between serum cholesterol and cardiovascular diseases in the adult, but the same has not yet been definitely established for the elderly. After examination of the available data, the Authors suggest that--after a through clinical evaluation--the elderly should also be treated given that there are data to suggest and hypothesize the positive action of a hypolipemic diet until at least the age of seventy five years. The therapy, whenever possible, could be dietetic; but from relevant results obtained, used together with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, these drugs are a good therapeutic approach to the problem, also in the elderly. To support this opinion, the Authors show the results obtained with the use of Simvastatin in a group of old patients.", 
    "73": "The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial described in this report was undertaken to clarify the dose-response relation of lovastatin therapy to lipid-modifying efficacy (lipid/lipoprotein modification) and drug-related adverse events in a population with moderately elevated fasting plasma total cholesterol (240 to 300 mg/dl) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (greater than or equal to 160 mg/dl). Men or women (postmenopausal or surgically sterile), aged 18 to 70 years, were entered into the trial with minimal exclusion criteria. After 4 to 6 weeks of an American Heart Association phase I diet or a more stringent diet, 8,245 patients from 362 sites were randomized to 1 of 5 parallel diet and drug treatment groups: placebo (n = 1,663) or lovastatin, 20 mg (n = 1,642) and 40 mg (n = 1,645) with the evening meal, and 20 mg (n = 1,646) or 40 mg twice daily (n = 1,649). The regimen of diet and lovastatin (or placebo) was followed for 48 weeks. The 5 treatment groups were similar at baseline. The total cohort had the following characteristics: 59% were men (mean age 56 years); 92% were white; 59% had completed at least 1 year of education beyond high school; 57% had a history of cardiovascular and associated disease; 40% had a history of hypertension; and 29% had coronary artery disease. Health habits were similar among groups, with 18% of patients reporting cigarette smoking, 14% reporting that they consume greater than 1 alcoholic beverage daily and 67% reporting no strenous exercise. Mean lipid/lipoprotein levels were also similar among groups, with the following average levels: total cholesterol (258 mg/dl), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (180 mg/dl), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (45 mg/dl) and triglycerides (median = 155 mg/dl). The large size of this trial, its placebo-controlled, double-blind design and the similarity of treatment groups at baseline should allow clear documentation of the long-term effects of lovastatin treatment and generalization of the results to a substantial portion of patients who may be candidates for lipid-modifying therapy.", 
    "74": "There is substantial evidence that drug treatment of hypercholesterolemia in patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD) can reduce fatal and nonfatal CAD events. Two trials, the Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial and the Helsinki Heart Study used cholestyramine and gemfibrozil, respectively, to alter lipoprotein levels; their demonstrated efficacy and safety have led to their widespread use in hyperlipidemic patients. Recently, a new class of hypolipidemic agents has been shown to be extremely effective in lowering total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. These drugs, including lovastatin and simvastatin, competitively inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of intracellular cholesterol synthesis. Results of safety and efficacy studies suggest that they may be valuable first-line treatment options for high-risk hypercholesterolemic patients. Two long-term clinical trials are planned with lovastatin and simvastatin. In the United States, lovastatin will be used in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, primary prevention trial involving 8,000 patients without clinical evidence of CAD, slight to moderate elevations of total cholesterol, and low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to establish whether 5 years of treatment will decrease the rate of fatal CAD or nonfatal myocardial infarction. A Scandinavian study of 4,000 patients with ischemic heart disease and hypercholesterolemia will determine if simvastatin will improve total survival and reduce fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction and sudden death for at least 3 years. These study designs will be discussed and compared with other studies, and the expected impact on CAD event rates presented.", 
    "75": "The inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase are highly effective in treating severe elevations of serum cholesterol, and are being widely used for this purpose. In our laboratory, these drugs have been used for the treatment of other forms of dyslipidemia including primary moderate hypercholesterolemia, primary mixed hyperlipidemia, diabetic dyslipidemia, hyperlipidemia of the nephrotic syndrome, and primary hypoalphalipoproteinemia. In these conditions, the HMG CoA reductase inhibitors proved effective in substantially decreasing levels of both low-density lipoproteins and very low density lipoproteins, as well as apolipoprotein B. In some patients, they may even increase levels of high-density lipoproteins. The primary mode of action of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors appears to be to increase the synthesis of hepatic receptors for lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein B, although a reduction in synthesis of these lipoproteins has not been ruled out with certainty. Regardless of mechanisms, drugs of this type appear to have the potential for effective therapy of various forms of dyslipidemia beyond primary severe hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "76": "A multicenter study was undertaken to compare the effects of lovastatin (given in 4 different dosage regimens) and probucol in patients with severe primary hypercholesterolemia. The subjects were 290 patients taking lipid-lowering diets who were randomly assigned to 1 of the following treatment regimens for 14 weeks: lovastatin, 40 mg once a day with the morning meal (qam); lovastatin, 40 mg once a day with the evening meal (qpm); lovastatin 80 mg qpm; lovastatin, 40 mg twice daily, or probucol, 500 mg twice daily. One-third of the patients received probucol, and the other two-thirds were equally divided between the 4 lovastatin treatment groups. The mean reductions in total cholesterol in the 5 groups were, respectively, 20, 25, 30, 33 and 10%. The corresponding values for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were 25, 32, 37, 40 and 8%. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased by 9 to 12% in all the lovastatin groups, but decreased by 23% in the probucol group. Triglycerides were reduced by 17 to 25% in all the lovastatin groups, but did not change significantly in the probucol group. Both drugs were well tolerated; no serious adverse events could be attributed to either agent. It is concluded that lovastatin is a considerably more effective lipid-lowering agent than probucol. In addition, lovastatin is almost as effective when given in a single daily dose as when given in a divided dose. When a once-a-day regimen is used, lovastatin is more effective if taken in the evening rather than the morning.", 
    "77": "Patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus have an increased incidence of coronary artery disease which may, in part, be associated with abnormalities in plasma lipids. In a double-blind, parallel, randomized study, lovastatin and gemfibrozil were compared in 102 diabetic patients with primary hypercholesterolemia; two-thirds of the patients were treated with oral hypoglycemic agents and one-third received diet therapy alone for their diabetes. Mean pretreatment total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol values were 273 and 193 mg/dl, respectively. Lovastatin significantly reduced total, LDL and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (20, 26 and 28%, respectively) and raised high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (14%). Gemfibrozil significantly reduced triglycerides and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (36 and 41%, respectively) and, to a lesser extent, total cholesterol (9%); it also increased HDL cholesterol (21%). Lovastatin therapy was not associated with a significant change in triglycerides, and gemfibrozil did not significantly lower LDL cholesterol. The decrease in the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol tended to be greater with lovastatin than with gemfibrozil (26.5 and 20.4%, respectively; p = 0.053). Changes in lipid profiles with both agents were of a degree similar to those reported in nondiabetic patients. Neither agent had a clinically important effect on fasting glucose or hemoglobin A1c. Both drugs were well tolerated with the exception of 2 patients treated with gemfibrozil who developed symptoms of cholecystitis.", 
    "78": "Lovastatin has been available for prescription use in the United States for about 20 months (as of June 1989). Over 1 million patients have received the prescription drug, and approximately 14,000 patients have participated in clinical trials. It is estimated that 500,000 patients have received lovastatin continuously for at least 1 year. This report reviews the extended safety experience from all clinical trials and prescription use. At least 645 patients have received lovastatin for more than 3 years. There are new data from a recently completed 1 year, placebo-controlled trial in 8,245 patients (Expanded Clinical Evaluation of Lovastatin study) and 20 months of health professionals' reports on spontaneous adverse events associated with large prescription usage. Data from recent large clinical trials suggest that the risk of myopathy and asymptomatic sustained liver transaminase elevations is less than reported in prior studies. The early clinical trials enrolled very high risk patients receiving lovastatin at a usual dose of 80 mg/day and often receiving concomitant hypolipidemic agents including gemfibrozil and niacin. After more than 42 months' long-term clinical trial experience, data have not established adverse effects from lovastatin on the human lens. Possible new types of rare drug-related adverse events observed with large prescription use include hypersensitivity reactions such as arthralgia, thrombocytopenia, symptomatic hepatitis and interaction with warfarin. No new, unique adverse-event profile has emerged with extended clinical use, including use in a few patients who have received therapy for more than 5 years. The lovastatin extended safety profile is that of a generally well-tolerated drug.", 
    "79": "This study reports the results of a 6-month, open-label multicenter study of the efficacy and tolerability of lovastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl co-enzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitor, in the management of nonfamilial primary hypercholesterolemia. The study enrolled 489 patients with elevated total serum cholesterol levels, whose lipids were not controlled sufficiently by diet. There was good representation of gender (48.3% women and 51.7% men), age (mean 57, range 25 to 83) and hypertension status (55.4% normotensive and 43.6% hypertensive) in the sample. Within 1 month of lovastatin therapy, total cholesterol was reduced 19% (from a mean of 269 to 217 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was reduced 27% (191 to 140 mg/dl), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol increased 6% (42.6 to 45.1 mg/dl), the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL was reduced 24% (6.7 to 5.1) and the ratio of LDL to HDL was reduced 30% (4.7 to 3.3). These results were consistent across age group, gender and hypertension status, and were maintained for a period of 6 months of therapy. Lovastatin was generally well tolerated. Of the 489 patients enrolled, 449 (92%) completed 6 months of therapy. Only 21 (4%) withdrew because of adverse experience regardless of cause. None of the few serious adverse experiences (e.g., myocardial infarction) could be attributed to the drug. Abnormal laboratory values during the 6 months of therapy were within expectations. Seventy-four patients had at least 1 abnormal value during 6 months of treatment. Of these, 42 had at least 1 mild to moderate creatine phosphokinase elevation during this period. Only 1 patient had an adverse change on ophthalmologic examination: a posterior subcapsular opacity in both eyes just visible on 6-month examination.", 
    "80": "Methyl (3R*,5S*)-(E)-3,5-dihydroxy-9,9-diphenyl-6,8-nonadienoate, CP-83101, was identified as a potent competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity, inhibiting enzyme activity in vitro with an IC50 of 8.5 +/- 0.7 microM and a Ki with respect to HMG-CoA of 2.6 microM. CP-83101 also inhibited rat hepatic sterol biosynthesis by 39 +/- 7% at a dose of 100 mg/kg. [3H]CP-83101, administered orally to rats, exhibited peak plasma levels at approximately 1 hr that declined thereafter with an apparent half-time of 2-3 hr. Peak tissue levels also occurred 1 hr following oral administration of [3H]CP-83101. The decline in radioactivity in the liver, however, was considerably slower than that noted in blood, whereas the half-life in non-hepatic tissues was approximately 1 hr. Liver/blood ratios of 14, and liver/lens ratios of greater than 3000, following oral administration of [3H]CP-83101, were similar to those previously reported for other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, suggesting a high degree of tissue selectivity. In addition, liver/adrenal and liver/ovary ratios were approximately 1000 at all time points examined between 30 min and 24 hr following oral [3H]CP-83101 administration, indicating a high specificity for hepatic versus other steroidogenic tissues. Evaluation of intravenous versus oral administration of the water-soluble, free acid, sodium salt of [3H]CP-83101 in bile duct canulated rats indicated that approximately 20% of orally administered CP-83101 is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and that absorbed CP-83101 is cleared rapidly from the plasma via the liver and from the liver via the bile. In addition, several lines of evidence suggest that CP-83101 may undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Agents of this synthetic series may thus possess advantages over other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors with respect to tissue kinetics and specificity.", 
    "81": "Plasma concentrations of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol are increased twofold to threefold in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. This sustained increase leads to accelerated rates of cholesterol deposition in the coronary arteries and to the development of tendon xanthomas. To assess whether hypolipidemic therapy with lovastatin, alone and in combination therapy with colestipol hydrochloride or nicotinic acid, results in regression of lipid deposits in the tendons of these patients, we have measured Achilles tendon diameters by xeroradiography before and after treatment. In 20 patients treated for a mean of 43 months (during which time plasma cholesterol concentrations decreased from 430 to 247 mg/dL), the diameter of both the left and right Achilles tendons measured at three different locations decreased by 0.55 to 1.5 mm. Larger reductions were seen in the tendons of seven of these patients who were treated for a mean of 64 months and whose mean concentrations of cholesterol fell from 488 to 279 mg/dL. We conclude that effective long-term hypolipidemic therapy leads to diminution in the size of Achilles tendon xanthomas in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and that such therapy is associated with mobilization of tissue stores of cholesterol in these patients."
