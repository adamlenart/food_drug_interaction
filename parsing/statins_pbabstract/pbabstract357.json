Sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1a, SREBP-1c, SREBP-2, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase, and LDL receptor mRNA levels and SREBP-1 and -2 protein expression were estimated in villus cell populations from duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. SREBP-1a was a minor transcript in hamster intestine, and its gene expression was not altered by changes in dietary cholesterol flux. In contrast, SREBP-1c gene expression was increased by dietary cholesterol and decreased by cholesterol depletion. mRNA levels for SREBP-2 and the other sterol-responsive genes were increased in intestines of animals on the cholesterol depletion diet but minimally suppressed if at all, by the diet enriched in cholesterol. In general, the amount of the precursor form of SREBP-1 was higher in cells of the upper villus and lower in cells of the lower villus. SREBP-2 precursor was higher in cells of the lower villus and lower in cells of the upper villus. Protein expression of precursor correlated with the location of gene expression for SREBPs. The amount of precursor mass of SREBP-2 was not altered by cholesterol feeding but was increased by cholesterol depletion. The mature form of SREBP-2 was in very low abundance and difficult to detect in intestines of animals fed control chow or cholesterol. It was readily detectable and increased in intestines of animals on the cholesterol-depletion diet. The diets did not significantly alter the amount of precursor or mature forms of SREBP-1. Cholesterol feeding had no effect on cholesterol or fatty acid synthesis, whereas synthesis of these lipids was increased in intestines of hamsters on the cholesterol-depleted diet. These results suggest that SREBP-1a has little or no role in regulating intestinal cholesterol synthesis. It is postulated that under basal conditions, SREBP-1c regulates intestinal fatty acid synthesis and SREBP-2 regulates cholesterol synthesis. Following marked changes in cholesterol flux across the intestine, SREBP-2 assumes the role of SREBP-1 and regulates both cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis in intestine.", 
    "1": "We recently reported the calcium-dependent activation of tyrosine kinase Pyk2 by angiotensin II (Ang II) in pulmonary vein endothelial cells (PVEC). Since Pyk2 has no calcium binding domain, and neither Ca(2+) nor Ca(2+)/calmodulin directly activates Pyk2, it is not clear how Ca(2+) transduces the signal to activate Pyk2, a key tyrosine kinase, in the early events of Ang II signaling. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of the calcium-dependent activation of Pyk2 in response to Ang II by using 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors and isoprenoid intermediates in PVEC. We have obtained substantial evidence indicating that Ang II activates Pyk2 through calcium-mediated activation of the geranylgeranylated small G protein Rap1 and the Rap1 association with Pyk2. Thus, the small G protein Rap1 is an intermediary signaling molecule linking Ang II-induced calcium signal to Pyk2 activation in PVEC. In addition, our results indicate that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors, a class of cholesterol-lowering drugs, could interrupt Ang II signaling independent of cholesterol lowering in endothelial cells.", 
    "2": "Clinical trials continue to guide patient management. However, the hypotheses generally come from observational studies. Studies on women continue to be too little and too few, particularly in light of the fact that most elderly hypertensive patients are likely to be women. Attention has been drawn to the possibility that hypertension per se may engender symptoms such as headache for example, in addition to harder endpoints such as death. The MICROHOPE study, which was not a blood pressure-lowering study, showed that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with ramipril in diabetic patients provided the same beneficial effects previously published for the HOPE study. The doxazosin arm of the ALLHAT study was terminated by the data monitoring and safety board because the doxazosin-treated patients developed congestive heart failure at a greater rate than diuretic-treated patients. Two extensive studies testing two different classes of calcium antagonists against primarily diuretic-based treatment showed that the calcium antagonists were no less effective in terms of preventing hard endpoints. A small, but impressive cross-over study testing the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, pravastatin, against placebo showed that statin treatment lowers blood pressure in hypercholesterolemic patients with hypertension. Meta- analyses emphasized the value of blood pressure reduction in the elderly and added to the controversy and confusion about the role of calcium antagonists in the first-line treatment of hypertension. The point may be moot since with the current recommendations few hypertensive patients will be adequately treated with a single agent.", 
    "3": "This report is focused on the study of simvastatin-induced relaxation of rat aorta through its effects on vascular smooth muscle and Ca(2+) signalling. The presence of endothelium affected only the simvastatin-induced relaxation of aortic rings precontracted with noradrenaline, but not by depolarization with KCl 80 mM. Blockade of Ca(2+) entry through voltage-operated Ca(2+) channels (VOCCs) by diltiazem abolished the endothelium-dependent and direct relaxation, whereas Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibition by cyclopiazonic acid (3 x 10(-5) M) only affected the endothelium-dependent relaxation. In KCl-depolarised arteries concentration-response curves for CaCl(2) were shifted to the right in the presence of simvastatin (3 x 10(-6) and 3 x 10(-5) M) or diltiazem (10(-6) and 10(-7) M). The transient contraction caused by noradrenaline in Ca(2+)-free medium, which is mainly due to intracellular Ca(2+) release, was inhibited by simvastatin (3 x 10(-5) M) or cyclopiazonic acid (3 x 10(-5) M) and the contraction induced by CaCl(2) (2 x 10(-3) M) added after noradrenaline was inhibited by diltiazem and simvastatin. All the reported effects of simvastatin were inhibited by the product of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, mevalonate (10(-3) M). These findings demonstrate that the vascular effects of simvastatin may involve both Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores, which could promote activation of endothelial factors, and blockade of extracellular Ca(2+) entry, which promote relaxations independent of the presence of endothelium. This action on Ca(2+) could be related to the inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis, which subsequently affects the function of G-proteins involved in communication among intracellular Ca(2+) pools and capacitative Ca(2+) entry.", 
    "4": "Despite scientific evidence that secondary prevention medical therapies reduce mortality in patients with established coronary artery disease, these therapies continue to be underutilized in patients receiving conventional care. To address this issue, a Cardiac Hospital Atherosclerosis Management Program (CHAMP) focused on initiation of aspirin, cholesterol-lowering medication (hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A [HMG CoA] reductase inhibitor titrated to achieve low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol < or =100 mg/dl), beta blocker, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy in conjunction with diet and exercise counseling before hospital discharge in patients with established coronary artery disease. Treatment rates and clinical outcome were compared in patients discharged after myocardial infarction in the 2-year period before (1992 to 1993) and the 2-year period after (1994 to 1995) CHAMP was implemented. In the pre- and post-CHAMP patient groups, aspirin use at discharge improved from 68% to 92% (p <0.01), beta blocker use improved from 12% to 62% (p <0.01), ACE inhibitor use increased from 6% to 58% (p <0.01), and statin use increased from 6% to 86% (p <0.01). This increased use of treatment persisted during subsequent follow-up. There was also a significant increase in patients achieving a LDL cholesterol < or =100 mg/dl (6% vs 58%, p <0.001) and a reduction in recurrent myocardial infarction and 1-year mortality. Compared with conventional guidelines and care, CHAMP was associated with a significant increase in use of medications that have been previously demonstrated to reduce mortality; more patients achieved an LDL cholesterol < or =100 mg/dl, and there were improved clinical outcomes in patients after hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "5": "The antioxidative effect of fluvastatin sodium (fluvastatin), a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, on lipid peroxidation of phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposomes was investigated in various peroxidizing systems. Fluvastatin markedly inhibited the formation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in iron (II)-supported peroxidation of liposomes (IC50 = 1.2 x 10(-5) M). The order of magnitude of inhibition of each drug on the peroxidation was: butylated hydroxytoluene > fluvastatin > or = probucol > pravastatin. Moreover, concentrations of fluvastatin ranging from 1 x 10(-6) to 1 x 10(-4) M inhibited peroxyl radical-mediated peroxidation of liposomes induced by water-soluble and lipid-soluble radical generators, 2,2'-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydro-chloride and 2,2'-azobis (2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile), respectively. However, pravastatin showed no effect against peroxyl radical-mediated peroxidation. These results indicate that fluvastatin acted non-enzymatically as an effective inhibitor against lipid peroxidation of PC liposomes and that the antioxidative effects of fluvastatin may be due to the scavenging action of fluvastatin on liposomal lipid peroxidation induced by peroxyl radicals generated in the aqueous and lipid phases.", 
    "6": "Seven percent of acute hospital admissions result from adverse drug reactions, of which 25% are due to drug interactions. Adverse effects of statin drugs occur in 3% of patients, mainly due to co-prescribing with other lipid-lowering agents or agents that alter their metabolism.",

    "10": "Co-prescribing of statins with competing substrates or inhibitors of their metabolism occurred in up to one-third of prescriptions issued. When statins are co-prescribed with recognised inhibitors of drug metabolism, pravastatin, which does not undergo significant hepatic metabolism, is the statin of choice.", 
    "11": "Hypercholesterolaemia is a chronic condition that often requires life-long treatment, making the safety of lipid-lowering drugs a critical issue. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors ('statins') are commonly used as the pharmacotherapeutic treatment of choice for patients with hypercholesterolaemia. These agents have consistently demonstrated a positive safety and tolerability profile, and are recommended by the US National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines and by the European Joint Task Force for Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease to be used after, or in addition to, a first-line approach with diet. Several large-scale clinical trials have shown HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors to be efficacious and well tolerated, and to be associated with a low rate of treatment withdrawal due to adverse events. These studies included mortality and morbidity end-points, and comprised both primary- and secondary-prevention trials. Hepatic, renal and muscular systems are rarely affected during HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor therapy and the few drug interactions that can occur with concomitantly administered drugs are well documented. There is no conclusive evidence linking HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors to the development of cancer in humans. In long term studies with various HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, there was no increase in cancer rates compared with placebo. Thus, it can be concluded that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are well tolerated, effective treatments for hypercholesterolaemia.",

    "13": "We analyzed 207 consecutive patients with coronary artery disease and hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol > or = 200 mg/dL or LDL-cholesterol > or = 130 mg/dL). Patients' average age was 61.7 +/- 10 year; 111 (53.6 %) male were and 94 (46.6 %) were female. We analyzed the level of prescription and adherence to treatment with statins.", 
    "14": "Statins were prescribed for 139 (67 %) patients, but only 85 (41 %) used the drug. In spite of being indicated, statins were not prescribed in 68 (33 %) patients. Of 54 (26 %) patients, nonadherent to statins, 67 % did not use the drug due to its high cost, 31 % due to the lack of instruction, and only 2 % due to side effects. Total cholesterol (260.3 +/- 42.2 vs 226.4 +/- 51.9; p < 0.0001) and LDL cholesterol (174.6 +/- 38.1 vs 149.6 +/- 36.1; p < 0.0001) were lower in patients on medication. HDL-cholesterol increased from 37.6 +/- 9.6 to 41.5 +/- 12.9 mg/dL (p = 0.02), and triglycerides were not modified in patients using statins.", 
    "15": "The prescription of statins in patients with coronary artery disease and dyslipidemia is high; however, its adherence is far from satisfactory, due to the high cost of the medication. Reduction in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels did not reach the targets recommended by the Brazilian Consensus on Dyslipidemia.", 
    "16": "Epidemiological and clinical studies have clearly established the link between elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and coronary heart disease (CHD). Consequently, treatment guidelines have been developed that identify LDL-C as a causative factor for CHD and as a target for lipid-lowering therapy. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are considered the drugs of choice for lowering LDL-C in patients with hypercholesterolaemia. However, despite the proven efficacy of statins in reducing LDL-C, many patients do not achieve recommended LDL-C target levels. Surveys suggest that patients do not receive the appropriate drugs in adequate dosage to reach LDL-C target values. Success in achieving targets is lowest in patients at the highest risk, i.e. those with established CHD. The introduction of more potent HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, or the use of higher doses of older statins, should allow more patients to achieve LDL-C target levels.", 
    "17": "We conducted an open-label study to test the effects of atorvastatin on serum lipids, lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and plasma fibrinogen levels. A total of 90 dyslipidaemic, non-smoking patients (45 patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia and 45 patients with primary mixed hyperlipidaemia) aged 48 +/- 11 years were studied. The patients were treated with 20 mg of atorvastatin for 24 weeks, in a single nocturnal dose. At baseline and every eight weeks, the fasting lipid profile, together with serum Lp(a) and plasma fibrinogen levels (Clauss method), were measured. Atorvastatin was highly effective in normalising the serum lipid profile. No significant change in median serum Lp(a) levels was observed in the whole group of patients (0.14 g/l before, vs. 0.16 g/l after, treatment) as well as in patients with raised (> 0.30 g/l) baseline levels (n = 32). A small non-significant increase of plasma fibrinogen was found (3.04 g/l vs. 3.14 g/l) after 24 weeks of atorvastatin administration. The effects of atorvastatin on both these variables did not differ in patients with hypercholesterolaemia or mixed hyperlipidaemia. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the effect of atorvastatin on plasma fibrinogen levels in dyslipidaemic patients without evident vascular disease is not clinically relevant. Furthermore, any rise in fibrinogen levels that may occur is likely to be transient in nature. Further studies are necessary to clarify this issue. There was no evidence that atorvastatin influences serum Lp(a) levels.",

In a second set of experiments, CB-derived progenitor cells were incubated with interleukin(IL)-3, stem cell factor (SCF) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and their cell cycle status assessed both by the cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) suicide approach and by flow cytometric DNA analysis.", 
    "20": "We found that only small proportions of both CFC and LTC-IC were in the S-phase of the cell cycle. These estimates were confirmed by flow cytometric DNA analysis, which showed that 96% +/- 2% of CB-derived CD34+ cells were in G0/G1 and only 1.6% +/- 0.4% in the S-phase. Staining of CD34+ cells with an anti-statin monoclonal antibody, a marker of the G0 phase, indicated that among CD34+ cells with a flow cytometric DNA content typical of the G0/G1 phase, 68% +/- 7% of cells were in the G0 phase of the cell cycle. Twenty-four hour incubation with IL-3, SCF and G-CSF significantly increased the proportion of cells in the S-phase for both CFC and LTC-IC without inducing any loss in their number. Flow cytometric DNA analysis also showed an increase of CD34+ cells in the S-phase upon continuous exposure to these cytokines.",

    "22": "Oncogenic mutations of the ras gene leading to constitutive activation of downstream effectors have been detected in a wide spectrum of human cancers (pancreas, thyroid, colon, non-small-cell lung cancer). Membrane anchorage of Ras, required for functional activity in signal transduction, is facilitated by post-translational modifications resulting in covalent attachment of a farnesyl group to the cysteine in the C-terminal CAAX motif. This attachment is mediated by farnesyltransferase (FTase). Here, we report a novel FTase inhibitor, BIM-46228, which showed (i) specific inhibition of purified human FTase enzyme, (ii) inhibition of proliferation in vitro in a large spectrum of human tumor cell lines, (iii) inhibition of growth of human tumor xenografts in athymic nude mice treated by per os administration and (iv) the benefits of in vitro combination of its activity with chemotherapy or radiotherapy.",

They have been shown effective in patients with mild hypercholesterolemia, but they are also useful in the general population.", 
    "24": "A common cellular response to genotoxic agents and inflammatory cytokines is the activation of NF-kappaB. Here, we addressed the question of whether small GTPases of the Rho family are involved in the stimulation of NF-kappaB signaling by genotoxic agents or TNFalpha in HeLa cells. Inhibition of isoprenylation of Rho proteins by use of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin attenuated UV-, doxorubicin-, and TNFalpha-induced degradation of IkappaBalpha as well as drug-stimulated DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB. Furthermore, NF-kappaB-regulated gene expression stimulated by either UV irradiation or treatment with TNFalpha was abrogated by lovastatin pretreatment. This indicates that isoprenylated regulatory proteins participate in the regulation of NF-kappaB by DNA-damaging agents as well as by TNFalpha. Specific blockage of Rho signaling by Clostridium difficile toxin B attenuated UV- and doxorubicin-induced activation of NF-kappaB, but did not affect stimulation of NF-kappaB by TNFalpha. Obviously, signaling to NF-kappaB by genotoxic and nongenotoxic stimuli occurs via different molecular mechanisms, either involving Rho GTPases or not. Based on the data, we suggest Rho GTPases to be essentially required for genotoxic stress-induced signaling to NF-kappaB.",

In most cases the origin is not clear, but in a minority of cases LABD is drug induced. We describe a patient in whom linear IgA disease developed shortly after beginning therapy with atorvastatin. In Western blotting analysis we detected IgA and IgG class antibodies targeting a 97-kd protein. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of atorvastatin-induced LABD.",

The mean Cmax and AUC(0,24 h) of simvastatin (95% confidence interval) when given alone were 8.76 (6.72-11.41) ng ml(-1) and 60.36 (47.15-77.28) ng ml(-1) h. During treatment with lacidipine they were, respectively, 14.89 (10.77-20.58) ng ml(-1) and 80.96 (64.62-101.44) ng ml(-1) h. No significant differences were observed in either time to peak concentration (tmax was 1.0 h for simvastatin alone and 1.5 h for the combination) or in the half-life (t1/2,z was 8.5 h in both cases).

Several well-publicized trials have recently reported that statin drugs (HMG CoA reductase inhibitors) are effective in lowering cholesterol and in reducing the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. In order to determine whether the results of these trials are relevant to our ageing population, we examined the representation of older people and women in randomized controlled trials of statin drugs. A systematic search of the medical literature from 1990 to 1999 was done to identify randomized placebo-controlled trials of statin drugs which evaluated clinical end-points-myocardial infarction, stroke or death. We identified 19 trials: 15 secondary prevention and four primary prevention. The mean age, age range and gender of the participants in these trials were determined. In the secondary prevention trials, the total number of patients randomized was 31683, with a combined mean age of 58.1 years. No trial enrolled people beyond the age of 75 years, and only 23% of the trial population was female. The four primary prevention trials randomized a combined total of 14 557 subjects with a mean age of 56.9 years. Only 10% of study participants were female. Statin drug trials have suffered from age and gender bias, having been mainly conducted in middle-aged male populations. The extrapolation of evidence from these trials to older people and women needs further evaluation.", 
    "35": "Inflammation is characterized by an excess of cell proliferation often leading to fibrosis and sclerosis with subsequent loss of organ function. We hypothesized that these features may be ameliorated by induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis as result of therapy with matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors. In our study, mesangial cells and experimental mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis provided the model of inflammation. First, we investigated the effect of the MMP inhibitor BB-1101 in anti-Thy1.1 nephritis. The numbers of apoptotic glomerular cells in nephritic rats increased about 4 and 6 times as a result of BB-1101 therapy, observed 11 and 14 days after induction of disease, respectively. Subsequently, rat mesangial cells were exposed to an MMP inhibitor in vitro. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analyses of cells exposed to RO111-3456 demonstrated a dose-dependent cell cycle arrest in the G(0)/G(1) phase associated with increased expression of statin. The cell cycle arrest was followed by apoptosis as investigated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) and acridine orange/ethidium bromide stainings, as well as by annexin V binding. The induction of p53, p21, and bax, but not the Fas/FasL pathway appeared to play an important pathogenetic role. In summary, MMP inhibitors induce cell cycle arrest followed by apoptosis in mesangial cells. These features help to explain the anti-inflammatory effects of these compounds, such as reduction of mesangial cell proliferation and attenuation of extracellular matrix accumulation. In conclusion, induction of cell cycle arrest with subsequent apoptosis may offer new perspectives in the therapy of inflammation even beyond kidney diseases.", 
    "36": "Aims Platelets play a central role in the restenosis process by inducing neointimal proliferation after coronary interventions. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Pl(A2)polymorphism has been associated with the occurrence of acute coronary syndromes and increased restenosis rates. Statins have been shown to exert potent antiproliferative, antiinflammatory and antithrombotic properties, thereby potentially interfering with the major processes of in-stent restenosis. Therefore, we sought to find out whether statin therapy interferes with restenosis and clinical outcome at 6 months following successful coronary stent implantation in the presence or absence of the Pl(A2)allele. Methods and Results Six hundred and fifty consecutive patients were followed for 6 months after coronary stent insertion. Carriers of the Pl(A2)allele demonstrated a significantly increased restenosis rate, which was abrogated by statin therapy (50.9% vs 28.6%, P=0.01). Moreover, statin therapy was associated with a significant reduction (28.2% vs 49.3%, P<0.01) in the occurrence of major adverse coronary events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, target vessel revascularization) in the 6 months after the intervention in patients with the Pl(A2)allele. Conclusion Statin therapy reduces increased stent restenosis rates and improves clinical outcome following coronary stent implantation in patients bearing the Pl(A2)allele, suggesting that statins interfere with the functional consequence of a genetically determined platelet-mediated risk factor associated with Pl(A2)polymorphism.", 
    "37": "Human serum paraoxonase (PON1) is a high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-associated enzyme that is responsible for the protective effect of HDL against oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). PON1 has a Glu to Arg polymorphism at codon 192 (CGA-->CAA) which is designated R/Q192. The R/Q192 polymorphism has been associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) in several, but not all, case-control studies. We prospectively studied the association of the Q/R192 genotypes with the severity, progression and regression of CAD, plasma lipid levels, clinical events and response to treatment with fluvastatin in a well-characterized cohort. Genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction mapping with AlwI enzyme in 356 subjects in the Lipoprotein and Coronary Atherosclerosis Study (LCAS). Fasting plasma lipids were measured and quantitative coronary angiograms were obtained at baseline and 2.5 years following randomization to fluvastatin or placebo. A total of 177 (50%), 142 (40%) and 37 (10%) subjects had Q/Q, Q/R and R/R genotypes, respectively. Baseline and final plasma levels of HDL, LDL, triglyceride and other lipoproteins, lesion-specific minimum lumen diameters (MLD), mean MLD, number of coronary lesions and total occlusions at baseline and follow-up and clinical event rates were not significantly different among the genotypes. There was no genotype-treatment interaction with respect to plasma lipid levels and angiographic indices of CAD. The Q/R192 variants of PON1 are not associated with severity, progression or regression of coronary atherosclerosis, plasma lipid levels, clinical events, or response to treatment with fluvastatin. Thus, the Q/R192 polymorphism is not a major risk factor in susceptibility to CAD in the LCAS population.", 
    "38": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important human pathogen that can cause severe and life-threatening respiratory infections in infants and immunocompromised adults. We have recently shown that the RSV F glycoprotein, which mediates viral fusion, binds to RhoA. One of the steps in RhoA activation involves isoprenylation at the carboxy terminus of the protein by geranylgeranyltransferase. This modification allows RhoA to be attached to phosphatidyl serine on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Treatment of mice with lovastatin, a drug that inhibits prenylation pathways in the cell by directly inhibiting hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, diminishes RSV but not vaccinia virus replication when administered up to 24 h after RSV infection and decreases virus-induced weight loss and illness in mice. The inhibition of replication is not likely due to the inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis, since gemfibrozil, another cholesterol-lowering agent, did not affect virus replication and serum cholesterol levels were not significantly lowered by lovastatin within the time frame of the experiment. Lovastatin also reduces cell-to-cell fusion in cell culture and eliminates RSV replication in HEp-2 cells. These data indicate that lovastatin, more specific isoprenylation inhibitors, or other pharmacological approaches for preventing RhoA membrane localization should be considered for evaluation as a preventive antiviral therapy for selected groups of patients at high risk for severe RSV disease, such as the institutionalized elderly and bone marrow or lung transplant recipients.", 
    "39": "A wealth of data demonstrate that reduction of cholesterol levels is associated with benefit in reducing coronary artery disease risk. The magnitude of benefit observed with statin treatment, which acts primarily to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), is greater than that observed with any other lipid-modifying intervention, and data from large statin trials indicate that this benefit is caused by LDL-C reduction. Statin treatment is highly cost-effective compared with other accepted therapies, at least in the secondary prevention setting, and has a superior safety and tolerability profile. For the foreseeable future, LDL-C reduction will remain the goal of lipid-modifying therapy, and statins will remain the primary therapeutic modality for achieving that goal.", 
    "40": "The utility of statins with increased potency in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is indicated by evidence that aggressive LDL-C lowering is associated with increased reduction in coronary artery disease risk, and the need for such agents is illustrated by the fact that many patients currently fail to achieve LDL-C target levels during treatment with available drugs. In dose-ranging studies of patients with hypercholesterolemia, the new synthetic statin rosuvastatin (formerly ZD4522) produced significant, dose-dependent reductions in LDL-C compared with placebo across a range of doses. Reductions ranged from 34% at 1 mg per day to 65% at 80 mg per day, with linear regression analysis indicating an additional 4.5% reduction in LDL-C with each doubling of the rosuvastatin dose. Rosuvastatin treatment was well tolerated. Phase 3 clinical trials of this agent are under way.", 
    "41": "Risk assessment limited to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels fails to identify a substantial proportion of individuals at risk for coronary artery disease. Data from the Prospective Cardiovascular M\u00fcnster (PRO-CAM) study indicate that triglyceride levels and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are important determinants of risk irrespective of LDL-C level. Risk is most accurately predicted using an algorithm incorporating multiple risk factors, as shown by the multiple logistic function analysis using the independent risk variables identified on multivariate analysis in PROCAM. It remains unclear what effect statin therapy to decrease LDL-C has in individuals with risk associated with factors other than elevated LDL-C. Such individuals might derive preferential benefit from treatments targeting such risk factors.", 
    "42": "Rosuvastatin (formerly ZD4522) is a new 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (statin) with distinct pharmacologic properties. Compared with most other statins, it is relatively hydrophilic, similar in this respect to pravastatin. Rosuvastatin has been shown to be a comparatively potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase activity in a purified preparation of the catalytic domain of the human enzyme, as well as in rat and human hepatic microsomes. In rat hepatocytes, rosuvastatin was found to have significantly higher potency as an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis than 5 other statins. Rosuvastatin was approximately 1,000-fold more potent in rat hepatocytes than in rat fibroblasts. Further studies in rat hepatocytes demonstrated that rosuvastatin is taken up into these cells by a high-affinity active uptake process. Rosuvastatin was also taken up selectively into the liver after intravenous administration in rats. Potent and prolonged HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity has been demonstrated after oral administration to rats and dogs. Pharmacokinetic studies in humans using oral doses of 5 to 80 mg showed that maximum plasma concentrations and areas under the concentration-time curve are approximately linear with dose. The terminal half-life is approximately 20 hours. Studies with human hepatic microsomes and human hepatocytes have suggested little or no metabolism via the cytochrome P-450 3A4 isoenzyme. On the basis of these observations, it is suggested that rosuvastatin has the potential to exert a profound effect on atherogenic lipoproteins.", 
    "43": "New approaches to lipid lowering include new uses of proven treatments and development of novel agents. Several large-scale clinical trials are assessing whether additional reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels with statin therapy results in additional benefit in coronary artery disease prevention. Statins with increased LDL-C-lowering potency, such as the new statin rosuvastatin (formerly known as ZD4522), have been developed and are in advanced-phase clinical trials. New cholesterol transport inhibitors, such as ezetimibe, have been found to produce significant reductions in intestinal cholesterol absorption, and new bile acid transport inhibitors are in development. Inhibitors of acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase, which can reduce cholesterol storage in macrophages and thereby in arterial lesions, have also been developed, with the agent avasimibe currently being evaluated in phase 2/3 trials. Combination approaches hold considerable promise, including combined use of statins with fibrates, niacin, and the new sterol absorption inhibitors.", 
    "44": "On the basis of the clinical benefit and virtual absence of adverse effects observed with statin treatment in major primary and secondary prevention trials, a case could be made for considering statin therapy for all patients meeting the eligibility criteria for these trials. Establishing a risk threshold for statin treatment based on cost is an urgent item on the agenda of modern healthcare systems. An economic analysis using West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS) findings indicates that statin treatment would have prevented 318 events per 10,000 patients in a population similar to that in WOSCOPS (average 1.5% annual risk of a cardiovascular event) at a discounted cost per life-year gained of 20,375 pounds($31,818). Application of current European treatment guidelines to consider treatment in patients with risk >2% per year would result in treatment of approximately 40% of the WOSCOPS population; discounted cost per life-year gained in this case would be 13,995 pounds($21,855). In Scotland, an annual risk threshold of > or = 3% for treatment has been adopted, corresponding to only 8% of the WOSCOPS population; the discounted cost per life-year gained is 9,680 pounds ($15,116). Reductions in drug cost, improved compliance, and use of more potent statins could alter cost efficiencies and encourage use of statins in a greater proportion of the primary prevention population that has been shown to benefit from such treatment.", 
    "45": "Statin therapy reduces coronary artery disease morbidity and mortality in primary and secondary prevention trials including patients with elevated and average cholesterol levels. The association between reduction of total or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and preventive benefit is well established. However, additional risk factors for coronary artery disease need to be incorporated into risk assessment to provide an accurate measure of global risk for use in lifestyle intervention and drug therapy guidelines. Assessment of outcomes in the Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study primary prevention trial, which involved patients with average cholesterol levels and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), suggests the importance of on-treatment values of apolipoproteins B and A-I in predicting first major events in such a population. Other data, including trials of fibrate therapy showing reduction in coronary artery disease events, support the importance of triglycerides and HDL-C in coronary artery disease risk. Challenges for future treatment guidelines include incorporation of emerging and novel risk factors into risk assessment, refinement of global risk measurement, and simplification for application to clinical practice.", 
    "46": "Statins have a variable response on fibrinogen, and these changes may have implications on cardiovascular events. In this randomized placebo-controlled crossover study, we evaluated whether changes in fibrinogen levels were different between atorvastatin and other statin-treated patients. Adult coronary heart disease (CHD) patients aged 39-83 years with LDL cholesterol levels > or = 130 mg/dl were randomized to atorvastatin 80 mg (n = 84) and one of the following statins: fluvastatin 80 mg (n = 23), lovastatin 80 mg (n = 20), pravastatin 40 mg (n = 22) or simvastatin 40 mg (n = 20) each for 12 weeks in either order. Fibrinogen was analyzed by an automated method of Clauss. Three independently acquired samples were obtained within 1 min of tourniquet application, and each specimen was measured in duplicate. Statistical analyses were performed using a mixed model repeated measures analysis of variance procedure with SAS version 6.12. There were no significant changes in fibrinogen between treatment groups. This study evaluated changes in fibrinogen with established pre-analytical and analytical procedures known to minimize variability in fibrinogen measurement, and we did not observe any differences in fibrinogen levels in the treatment groups.", 
    "47": "We investigated the relation between serum lipids including oxidized LDL and the severity of coronary atherosclerosis. Serum lipids and oxidized LDL was measured in 62 men (33-66 years), who underwent diagnostic coronary angiography and sonography to measure the carotid intima-media thickness. LDL oxidation was found in chemical analyses to be due to conjugated fatty acids in cholesteryl esters and triglycerides. Regression analysis indicated that the carotid intima-media thickness and the ratio of LDL diene conjugation to LDL cholesterol (the ox-LDL:LDL ratio) were the only factors associated independently with the severity of coronary atherosclerosis. The patients with multi-vessel disease who did not use lipid lowering therapy had a 50% thicker carotid intima media (P = 0.030) and a 41% higher ox-LDL:LDL ratio (P = 0.020) than patients with normal vessels. Further, patients with multi-vessel disease on statin therapy had a 24% lower ox-LDL:LDL ratio than the subjects with multi-vessel disease who did not use lipid lowering drugs (P = 0.027), although the concentration of LDL cholesterol did not differ between the groups. This study supports the hypothesis that lipid oxidation plays a role in the development of atherosclerosis.", 
    "48": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of fluvastatin on the microcirculation of patients with hyperlipidaemia (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol > 160 mg/dL, triglycerides < 350 mg/dl) inadequately controlled by diet. After a dietary run-in of 4 weeks, patients were randomised in a double-blind study to receive fluvastatin 40 mg twice daily (n = 24) or placebo (n = 24) for 12 weeks. The effect on microcirculation was assessed using capillary microscopy and laser Doppler fluxmetry at the nailfold at baseline and at 6 and 12 weeks after initiation of therapy. Capillaroscopy showed that fluvastatin improved microcirculation, i.e. time to peak flow during postocclusive reactive hyperaemia dropped from 19.7 +/- 7.2 s at baseline to 12.3 +/- 9.5 s at week 6 (P < 0.01) and 10.6 +/- 6.5 s at week 12 (P < 0.0001). These results were confirmed using laser Doppler fluxmetry to study microcirculation in thermoregulatory capillaries at the same site. A significant decrease in total and LDL-cholesterol was achieved during fluvastatin therapy. In conclusion, fluvastatin therapy improves microcirculation in nutritive as well as thermoregulatory capillaries in hypercholesterolaemic patients within 6 weeks.", 
    "49": "We have determined whether the anti-atherosclerotic effect of a 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (fluvastatin) is mediated through nitric oxide (NO) as well as affecting plasma lipids. NO related vascular responses, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA and superoxide anion (O(2)(-)) release were examined in vascular walls of oophorectomized female rabbits fed 0.5% cholesterol chow for 12 weeks with or without fluvastatin (2 mg/kg per day). Serum lipid profile was not different between two groups. NO dependent responses stimulated by acetylcholine and calcium ionophore A23187 and tone related basal NO response induced by N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine acetate (L-NMA); nitric oxide synthase inhibitor were all improved by fluvastatin treatment. Endothelium independent vasorelaxation induced by nitroglycerin was not different between the two groups of rabbits' arteries. Fluvastatin treatment increased cyclic GMP concentration in aorta of rabbits. eNOS mRNA expression and O(2)(-) release were measured in aorta using competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and with lucigenin analogue, 2-methyl-3,7-dihydroimidazol [1,2-a]pyrazine-3-one (MCLA) chemiluminescence methods. eNOS mRNA in the endothelial cells of aorta was significantly up-regulated and O(2)(-) production was significantly reduced in fluvastatin treated rabbit aorta. Anti-macrophage staining area, but not anti-smooth muscle cell derived actin stained area in the aorta was also reduced by fluvastatin treatment. Conclusion, fluvastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, retards the initiation of atherosclerosis formation through the improvement of NO bioavailability by both up-regulation of eNOS mRNA and decrease of O(2)(-) production in vascular endothelial cells, and this means that part of the anti-atherosclerotic effect of fluvastatin may be due to nonlipid factors.", 
    "50": "Little is known about the effects of cholesterol-lowering agents in hypercholesterolemic patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). The aim of this study was to compare the changes induced by simvastatin and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) on cholesterol metabolism in patients with PBC and preserved liver function. Six patients with PBC were administered simvastatin (40 mg/day) for 30 days and, after a washout period of 30 days, ursodeoxycholic acid (600 mg/day) for 30 days. Serum levels of lathosterol, campesterol, 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol, and 27-hydroxycholesterol were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. During simvastatin administration, reduction of cholesterol levels (34% in 30 days) was paralleled by the decrease of lathosterol (55%), whereas concentrations of campesterol and of the two hydroxysterols were not substantially modified. During ursodeoxycholic acid administration, a trend toward a decrease of serum cholesterol concentrations was observed after only one year of treatment, and these changes were paralleled by the decrease of campesterol serum levels. Both simvastatin and UDCA were well tolerated, and a reduction of serum liver enzyme levels occurred with the latter. Simvastatin proved to be safe and effective in reducing serum cholesterol levels in patients with PBC by an inhibitory effect on cholesterol synthesis occurring within 24 h. --Del Puppo, M., M.

In patients over 55 years, the incidence of stroke more than doubles with each decade of life. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, or statins, have been shown to lower cholesterol and lipids in both middle-aged and elderly patients in large clinical trials. Some statins have been shown to improve endothelial function and vasodilation and to normalize thrombin formation, which may be among the mechanisms involved in both coronary event and stroke prevention.", 
    "52": "Hypercholesterolemia is a risk factor for new coronary events in older men and women. Secondary prevention trials have demonstrated in persons with coronary artery disease (CAD) and hypercholesterolemia that statin drugs reduced in older persons all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, coronary events, coronary revascularization, stroke, and intermittent claudication. Statins have also been shown to slow progression of coronary atherosclerotic plaques in persons with CAD, to reduce restenosis after coronary stent implantation, and to decrease myocardial ischemia in persons with CAD. Older men and women with CAD, prior atherothrombotic brain infarction, peripheral arterial disease, or extracranial carotid arterial disease and a serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level higher than 125 mg/dl despite diet should be treated with statin drug therapy to lower the serum LDL cholesterol level below 100 mg/dl. Primary prevention trials have shown that statins were also effective in reducing cardiovascular events in older persons with hypercholesterolemia. On the basis of data from the Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study, the physician should consider using statins in persons aged 65-80 years without cardiovascular disease with a serum LDL cholesterol level above 130 mg/dl and serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level below 50 mg/dl.", 
    "53": "Cardiovascular disease, primarily coronary heart disease (CHD), outnumbers the next 16 causes of death in women combined. However, the long-held belief that heart disease in women has a more benign prognosis than in men has resulted in less aggressive diagnosis and management patterns. Appreciation of the differences between men and women in CHD risk factors and presentation can assist in treatment decisions. Although estrogen replacement offers substantial beneficial effects on lipid levels in postmenopausal women, the first 2 randomized trials of estrogen alone and estrogen plus progestin, the Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study and Estrogen Replacement and Atherosclerosis Study, observed no benefit in reducing risk of CHD death and nonfatal myocardial infarction and angiographic progression of CHD, respectively, in women with CHD. Available data show that lipid-lowering therapy reduces women's CHD risk and mortality but also indicate that a considerable proportion of women remains untreated or undertreated. Randomized trials of statins for primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease suggest that these agents are at least as effective for lowering coronary disease risk in women as in men. Therefore, statin drugs should be the drug of first choice for women with established CHD. Hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women who require estrogen for menopausal symptoms may derive further reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and reductions in trigyceride levels with the addition of a statin drug.", 
    "54": "Ischemic heart disease is an important and common contributor to the development of heart failure. Theoretically, all patients with heart failure may benefit from treatment designed to retard progressive ventricular dysfunction and arrhythmias. Patients with ischemic heart disease may also theoretically benefit from the relief of ischemia, the prevention of coronary occlusion, and revascularization. However, there is little evidence to show that the presence or absence of coronary disease modifies the benefits of effective treatments such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers. Moreover, there is no evidence that treatment directed specifically at myocardial ischemia or coronary disease alters outcome in patients with heart failure. Treatments aimed at relieving painless myocardial ischemia have not been shown to alter prognosis. Lipid-lowering therapy is theoretically attractive for patients with heart failure and coronary disease; however, theoretical concerns also exist about the safety of such agents, and patients with heart failure have been excluded from large outcome studies very effectively. Some agents, such as aspirin, designed to reduce the risk of coronary occlusion seem ineffective or harmful in patients with heart failure, although warfarin may be safe and possibly effective. There is no evidence yet that revascularization improves prognosis in patients with heart failure, even in patients who are shown to have extensive myocardial hibernation. On current evidence, revascularization should be reserved for the relief of angina. Large-scale, randomized controlled trials are currently underway that are investigating the role of specific treatments targeted at coronary syndromes. The Carvedilol Hibernation Reversible Ischemia Trial: Marker of Success study is investigating the effects of carvedilol in a large cohort of patients with and without hibernating myocardium. The Warfarin and Antiplatelet Therapy in Chronic Heart Failure study is comparing the efficacy of aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin. The Heart Revascularization Trial-United Kingdom study is assessing the effect of revascularization on mortality in patients with heart failure and myocardial hibernation. Smaller scale studies are assessing the safety and efficacy of statin therapy in patients with heart failure. Only once the outcomes to these and other planned trials are known can the medical community know how best to treat their patients.", 
    "55": "1. Five 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins), (e.g. atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin), were investigated for their ability to reverse P-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediated rhodamine 123 (R123) transport in a murine monocytic leukaemia cell line that over-expresses the multi-drug resistance protein 1a/b (mdr1a/1b). 2. P-gp modulation was studied by a fluorimetric assay and confocal microscopy by means of R123 efflux and uptake experiments, respectively. 3. Atorvastatin acid, methyl ester and lactone, lovastatin lactone and simvastatin lactone inhibited R123 transport in a concentration-dependent manner. Lovastatin acid, simvastatin acid, fluvastatin and pravastatin did not show a significant inhibition of the R123 transport in our cell system. Atorvastatin methyl ester and lactone showed the highest affinities for P-gp and results were comparable for both methods. 4. In conclusion, monitoring of R123 transport in living cells by confocal microscopy in addition to fluorimetric assay is a sensitive tool to study P-gp affinity in drug screening that is especially useful for early phases of drug development.", 
    "56": "Oxidative modification of LDL induces immunogenic epitopes in the LDL molecule, and the presence of antibodies against oxidized LDL (anti-Ox-LDL) has been demonstrated in human sera. However, little is known about the clinical significance of anti-Ox-LDL. To elucidate a clinical relationship between the immunological response to oxidized LDL and cellular oxidative stress, we measured serum titers of anti-Ox-LDL in 45 unselected patients with hypercholesterolemia and serum 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), considered a biomarker of the oxidative damage to DNA. The anti-Ox-LDL titer was not correlated with the serum LDL-C concentration, but was correlated with the 8-OHdG concentration (r = 0.300, P < 0.05) in a simple linear regression. Multiple regression analysis indicated that 8-OHdG was independently correlated with anti-Ox-LDL (r = 0.429, P < 0.05), but no other variables, including LDL-C concentrations and smoking habit, were correlated with anti-Ox-LDL. In 16 subgroup patients, the concentrations of TC, TG and LDL-C decreased and the HDL-C concentration increased after cholesterol-lowering therapy with fluvastatin. In addition, both the anti-Ox LDL titer (14.0 +/- 9.5 to 11.4 +/- 6.6 AcU/ml, P < 0.05) and the 8-OHdG concentration (1.19 +/- 0.41 to 0.85 +/- 0.43 ng/ml, P < 0.05) also decreased after fluvastatin therapy. The immunological response to LDL oxidation on vascular wall tissues or cells appear to occur in association with oxidative DNA damage. The measurement of anti-Ox-LDL may be a useful indicator for lipid-lowering therapy.",

End points of in-hospital mortality and in-hospital reinfarction were significantly lower in the statin-treated group, pointing to a benefit from very early statin treatment in acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "60": "During acute myocardial infarction (MI), aspirin, beta-adrenergic antagonists and oral angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be used as an adjunct to reperfusion therapy. Medications upon discharge from the hospital should include aspirin and a beta-blocker. An ACE inhibitor should also be prescribed unless the ejection fraction is > 45%. Particular indications for an ACE inhibitor are an anterior MI, congestive heart failure, ejection fraction < 45% and mitral regurgitation. beta-blockers, when given to patients treated with ACE inhibitors, appear to produce an additional benefit compared with an ACE inhibitor alone. Based on the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S), Cholesterol and Recurrent Events (CARE) and Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease (LIPID) trials, a statin should also be given to subjects with low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels above 125 mg/dl, independent of total cholesterol levels. Therapy should be administered in an attempt to reduce the LDL-cholesterol level to 90-100 mg/dl (2.3-2.6 mM/l). In patients with normal or low levels on initial evaluation, screening for lipid abnormalities should be deferred for 2 months since acute phase responses and passive hepatic congestion can cause spuriously normal levels. Calcium channel blockers, nitrates, lidocaine, anti-arrhythmic drugs and i.v. magnesium should not be administered routinely after acute MI and their use should be restricted to selected settings.", 
    "61": "The objective of this article is to evaluate the roles of the lipid-lowering class of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) in reducing cardiovascular events and to review their mechanism of action based on in vitro and in vivo studies. The clinical outcome of 15 major clinical trials has been critically reviewed and summarised; all showed a high degree of efficacy and safety. Statins, either in active or prodrug forms, are potent inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, have good absorption rate and their bioavailability depends on their lipophobicity and concomitant use with meals. Abdominal discomfort is the most commonly reported adverse effect. Although the incidence is low, myopathy with or without rhabdomyolysis may be considered a serious adverse effect of statins. A combination of a statin with gemfibrozil seems to increase the risk of this adverse event, particularly in patients with renal impairment. Combination therapy with several other agents, frequently administered to cardiovascular patients, has also been reviewed. Statin therapy is considered highly cost effective in secondary prevention, but it is less cost effective in primary prevention. This factor may underline the rationale for developing other safe and effective agents with an improved cost effectiveness profile. The pleiotropic non-lipid lowering effects of statins may include their anti-oxidant and antithrombotic potential as well as restoration of endothelial function. Statins may also be beneficial in the treatment of osteoporosis. Fewer studies have investigated statins' effects on the quality of lipoprotein particles, the activities of cholesteryl ester transfer protein and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase as well as their possible synergistic effects with n-3 fatty acids, anti-oxidants and aspirin in reducing cardiovascular events.", 
    "62": "Aspirin and statins are beneficial in coronary heart disease across a broad range of cholesterol levels. We assessed the effects of low-dose aspirin (75 mg daily) on thrombin generation in patients with coronary heart disease and average blood cholesterol levels. We also investigated whether in patients with borderline-high cholesterol level who have been already taking aspirin, additional treatment with simvastatin would affect thrombin generation. Seven-day treatment with low-dose aspirin decreased thrombin generation ex vivo only in patients with total cholesterol < or = 5.2 mmol/L. In patients with higher cholesterol levels aspirin had no effect. In these patients, already taking low-dose aspirin, additional three-month simvastatin treatment resulted in a reduction of thrombin generation. This demonstrates that low-dose aspirin depresses thrombin generation only in subjects with desirable blood cholesterol levels, while in others, with borderline-high cholesterol, thrombin formation is being reduced following the addition of simvastatin.",

    "67": "Dyslipemia as a risk factor for ischemic stroke and indications for statins in the prevention of ischemic stroke are revised. The role of cholesterol levels as a risk factor for ischemic stroke is controversial. This could be due to failures in the design of early epidemiological studies. Recent studies, however, do suggest a clearer risk relationship between cholesterol levels and ischemic stroke. Studies conducted on the prevention of ischemic heart disease (IHD) with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), using pravastatin and simvastatin, unequivocally show reductions in overall mortality, cardiovascular mortality, acute myocardial infarction and other coronary events. These studies show a reduction in the risk of ischemic stroke, and although relative risk reduction is great, absolute risk reduction is low; the reasons for this are analyzed. Apart from lipid mechanisms, statins act on the atheroma plaque; they have antithrombotic and possibly neuroprotecting properties. Statins reduce the number of strokes due to the decrease of atherothrombotic strokes, cardioembolic strokes secondary to IHD, and lacunar strokes related to atherothrombosis and probably to microatheromas. Although there are currently no specific studies available on the secondary prevention of stroke with statins, which are required to clarify certain points, according to European and American guidelines for prevention, statins would be indicated in the secondary prevention of atherothrombotic stroke, and in cardioembolic and lacunar stroke associated with clinical or silent atherosclerosis (IHD, peripheral artery disease). Patients with ischemic stroke of other etiologies, except for stroke in the young or other unusual causes, are patients with a high vascular risk (cardiac and cerebral) owing to the stroke itself, age and other vascular risk factors, and they should also be treated with statins, at least from the point of view of primary prevention of IHD. Natural statins (pravastatin and simvastatin) play an essential part in secondary prevention of ischemic stroke, together with antiaggregants, anticoagulants, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and the treatment of other vascular risk factors.",

    "75": "Cell cycle-related changes in the ability to regulate cell volume following hyposmotic swelling were studied in mouse fibroblasts using videomicroscopy and the whole-cell patch clamp technique. Regulatory volume decrease (RVD) and volume-sensitive Cl- conductance (G(Cl,vol)) were measured: (1) in proliferating cells of different sizes; (2) in cells arrested in defined phases of the cell cycle (G1, G1/S, S, and M phases) using mevastatin, mimosine, hydroxyurea, aphidicolin, cytosine beta-D-arabinofuranoside, and taxol; and (3) in serum-starved cells (G(0) state). Cells in all groups were able to undergo RVD, although the cells approaching mitosis (i.e., the largest cells in proliferating cultures and the taxol-treated cells) had the lowest rates of shrinkage during RVD. In agreement with this finding, the density of G(Cl,vol) was stable in proliferating and cell cycle-arrested cells for most of the cell cycle, with the exception of the cells approaching mitosis and the new daughter cells where the density was decreased to half. The impairment of RVD was greatest in serum-starved cells which also had the lowest density of G(Cl,vol). We conclude that proliferating cells maintain an ability to recover from osmotic swelling as they progress through the cell cycle, although this ability may be compromised during mitosis.", 
    "76": "X-linked adrenoleukodysrophy is the most frequent genetic disorder affecting central and peripheral nervous system myelin. One of the biochemical abnormalities is the accumulation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) in tissues and body fluids subsequent to defective catabolism in the peroxysomes. The principal characteristic of the disease is an association between a neurological disorder and an endocrine disorder: primary adrenal insufficiency and testicular failure. Clinical manifestations are variable. There are two main forms, one affecting boys between the age of 5 and 10 years with severe rapidly fatal cerebral involvement, and the other affecting young adults between the age of 20 and 30 years with degeneration of the anterior and posterior long spinal cord tracts, similar to the disorders observed in multiple sclerosis. About 20% of the heterozygous women may develop a syndrome which resembles adrenomyeloneuropathy, rarely adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal insufficiency is present in 85% of the childhood cerebral forms and in about 70% of the adult forms. It may occur before, after or at the same time as the neurological disease but is not correlated with the severity of the neurological disorder. Careful screening is required to avoid missing subclinical forms. Adrenoleukodystrophy should be envisaged in young boys with primary adrenal insufficiency, accounting for about 30% of the cases of primary adrenal insufficiency in children under 3 years of age and about 13% of those in adults. Experience with dietary therapy (low-VLCFA diet and supplementation with unsaturated fatty acids such as glyceryl trioleate (GTO) and glyceryl trierucate (GTE), commonly called Lorenzo's oil) has not demonstrated any clinical improvement in the cerebral forms. Bone marrow transplantation is recommended for children who show early evidence of cerebral involvement. Gene therapy is a promising perspective. Lovastatin and 4-phenlbutyrate have recently been shown to normalize plasma VLCFA levels. Their therapeutic efficacy must be assessed in a randomized trial.", 
    "77": "Statins have demonstrated their aptitude to lower hypercholesterolemia, and to prevent the occurrence of arterial, coronary, and cerebral events, by primary and secondary prevention in patients with low or high risk to develop coronary artery disease. In the first time, with MIRACL and Atrovastatine, statins are proposed in the therapeuty of unstable angina. This study was successful. In fact, in this comparative study, high dose of Atrovastatine (80 mg/day) administrated in the acute phase of non Q-wave myocardial infarction or unstable angina, reduce ischemic events (RR=0.84, p=0.048 ). After anticoagulants and a wide group of platelets antiagregants, this statin brings a new agent to the chemotherapy of the atherosclerotic unstable lesion. The TACTICS-TIMI 18 and the sub-group of the FRISC II study, demonstrate the necessity to stratify the unstable angina risk by electric and biologic arguments. They confirm the efficacy of invasive strategy, with coronarography, and immediate revascularisation, in patients with high risk with persistent modifications of ST segment, and increasing Troponins level. Under the cover of a large medical treatment composed of anti-ischemic, Aspirine, LMWH, and now a high dose of statins, the acute coronary syndrome invasive attitude must be guided by electric, biologic and the invasive attitude prognostic risk.", 
    "78": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors or statins are potent hypocholesterolemic drugs.

Important controlled clinical trials have shown the ability of these drugs to reduce - coronary morbidity and mortality in secondary prevention (4S study with simvastatin, CARE and LIPID studies with pravastatin). - total mortality in secondary pr\u00e9vention (4S and LIPID studies). - coronary morbidity and mortality (AFCAPS/Tex-CAPS with lovastatin) and total mortality in primary prevention (WOSCOPS study with pravastatin). Questions still remain unanswered. To what extent do we have to lower LDL-cholest\u00e9rol? What are the risks of an aggressive treatment with statins? Can we extrapolate the results of the large clinical trials to women, elderly, dyslipidemic subjects with other manifestations of atherosclerosis (i.e. cerebro-vascular, peripheral vascular diseases)?

    "79": "Type 2 diabetic patients show frequent lipid abnormalities characterized by increased triglyceride and decreased HDL-cholesterol levels, but also by qualitative and metabolic abnormalities of all lipoproteins (VLDL, IDL, LDL et HDL). Treatment of diabetic hyperlipidemia is important in order to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events, which is high in type 2 diabetes. Treatment with statins is recommended when hypercholesterolemia is associated with diabetes. But the efficacy of statins in the treatment of the typical diabetic hyperlipidemia (hypertriglyceride\u00f9mia, decreased HDL-cholesterol) remains to be demonstrated, since their effects on triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol is moderate. However, the new statins (cerivastatine, atorvastatine), which are more powerful to reduce hypertriglyceridemia could be useful for the treatment of diabetic hyperlipidemia. But, only on going clinical trials with statins in diabetic patients will be able to precise their possible efficacy on the prevention of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "80": "Patients with chronic renal diseases (CRD) have a high prevalence of lipid abnormalities. Elevated levels of total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol are associated with cardiovascular diseases in patients with CRD. The 3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl co-enzyme A reductase inhibitors appear to be the most effective agents to lower LDL cholesterol in this category of patients and are generally safe if used with caution. They should be drugs of first choice in CRD but dosage reduction and close monitoring may be required to avoid side effects in case of renal failure or in combination with calcineurin inhibitors. Moreover recent studies suggest that in addition to lowering plasma LDL cholesterol, theses compounds may modify several factors implicated in the development of atherosclerosis and the progression of chronic renal failure. Such newly defined effects may contribute to extend the use of statins in the management of renal patients.", 
    "81": "The role of cholesterol in the pathogenesis of stroke, the role of the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in the prevention of stroke have been controversed. The explanation was based on the heterogenous characteristics of stroke, on the relationship between several risk factors, and on the role of the age, in the evaluation of these 2 questions. The discovery of statins induced major therapeutic trials whose aim was the impact on coronary events. These trials demonstrated that statins were accompanied with a major reduction of cholesterol levels and stroke events similar to the one observed with coronary events. Even prospective, placebo controlled, randomized specific trials for stroke are necessary, we can state that cholesterol reduction is the most important mechanism accounting for a decrease in stroke occurrence with statins.", 
    "82": "This brief review and update considers a few aspects of the mechanisms of action of statins, especially those related to some of the pleiotropic effects that have clinical relevance. The beneficial effect on endothelial dysfunction is a class effect that is related not only to the lowering of plasma LDL-cholesterol but also to a direct effect on nitric oxide (NO) production. It is an early and sustained effect, linked to oxidative processes, that deserves particular attention since endothelial dysfunction is intimately linked to atherogenesis. Awareness of the anti-inflammatory effect came about following the observation that statin administration in humans reduces markers of inflammation in the circulation. The importance of these observations is ascribable to the fact that atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease, that the inflammatory process in a coronary artery is now measurable in vivo in humans, that it contributes to the progression and the destabilization of the plaque, and also, because statins exert a number of effects that tend to stabilize it. Statins, and particularly lipophilic statins, in general inhibit cell proliferation, seemingly by multifaceted mechanisms. These include inhibition of cell cycle progression, induction of apoptosis, reduction of cyclooxygenase-2 activity and an enhancement of angiogenesis. At the center of these mechanisms stands the ability to inhibit G protein prenylation through a reduction of farnesylation and geranylgeranylation. This effect has been used to show that statins are anticarcinogenic in vitro and in animals. The clinical relevance of such a property remains to be proven but is supported by promising observations in animals and in humans which are detailed in this review. Finally, the ability of lipophilic statins to increase the production of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), and to enhance osteogenesis in animals combined with the results of several clinical studies should stimulate physicians to seriously consider an eventual indication of statins for the treatment of osteoporosis.", 
    "83": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitors, or statins, are potent inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis and large clinical trials have demonstrated that these agents reduce cholesterol and the incidence of cardiovascular diseases. Recent evidence, however, suggests that the beneficial effects of statins may extend beyond their effects on serum cholesterol levels. Because statins also inhibit the synthesis of isoprenoid intermediates in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, they may have pleiotropic effects on vascular wall cells. In particular, the small GTP-binding protein, Rho, whose membrane localization and activity are affected by post-translational isoprenylation, may play an important role in mediating the direct vascular effects of statins.", 
    "84": "The nuclear oxysterol-receptor paralogues LXRalpha and LXRbeta share a high degree of amino acid identity and bind endogenous oxysterol ligands with similar affinities. While LXRalpha has been established as an important regulator of cholesterol catabolism in cholesterol-fed mice, little is known about the function of LXRbeta in vivo. We have generated mouse lines with targeted disruptions of each of these LXR receptors and have compared their responses to dietary cholesterol. Serum and hepatic cholesterol levels and lipoprotein profiles of cholesterol-fed animals revealed no significant differences between LXRbeta(-/-) and wild-type mice. Steady-state mRNA levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, and squalene synthase were increased in LXRbeta(-/-) mice compared with LXRbeta(+/+) mice, when fed standard chow. The mRNA levels for cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase, oxysterol 7alpha-hydroxylase, sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase, and sterol 27-hydroxylase, respectively, were comparable in these strains, both on standard and 2% cholesterol chow. Our results indicate that LXRbeta(-/-) mice - in contrast to LXRalpha(-/-) mice - maintain their resistance to dietary cholesterol, despite subtle effects on the expression of genes coding for enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. Thus, our data indicate that LXRbeta has no complete overlapping function compared with LXRalpha in the liver.",

In addition, prospective studies have consistently shown that CRP is a strong predictor of future coronary events in apparently healthy men and women. The relative risk associated with CRP is independent of other cardiovascular disease risk factors. High-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) assays are needed for risk assessment of cardiovascular disease. Such assays are currently available but may require further standardization because patients' results will be interpreted using population-based cutpoints.

    "90": "We measured CRP, LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels among 785 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia at baseline and after 8 weeks of therapy with either 0.4 or 0.8 mg of cerivastatin. Overall, cerivastatin resulted in a 13.3% reduction in median CRP levels (P:<0.001) and a 24.5% reduction in mean CRP levels (P:<0.001). Although LDL-C promptly decreased in a dose-dependent manner (mean LDL-C reduction, 37.3% for 0.4 mg and 42.2% for 0.8 mg of cerivastatin), no clear dose-response effect of cerivastatin on CRP was observed, nor was there any substantive correlation between the magnitude of change in CRP and the magnitude of change in LDL-C (r=-0.08) or the magnitude of change in HDL-C (r=-0.04). Thus, <2% of the variance in the percent change in CRP over 8 weeks could be attributed to the percent change in either of these lipid parameters. Further, there was no evidence of correlation between baseline CRP levels and baseline lipid levels or between end-of-study CRP levels and end-of-study lipid levels.",

    "92": "Ras is frequently mutated in cancer, and novel therapies are being developed to target Ras signalling. To identify non-invasive surrogate markers of Ras activation and inhibition, we used(31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and investigated NIH 3T3 cells compared to a mutant ras transfected counterpart. The MR spectra indicated that phosphocholine (PC) levels increased significantly from 3 +/- 2 fmol cell(-1)in NIH 3T3 cells to 13 +/- 4 fmol cell(-1)in the transfected cells. The PC/NTP ratio increased significantly from 0.3 +/- 0.1 to 0.7 +/- 0.3. This could not be explained by either a faster proliferation rate or by alterations in cell cycle distribution. Both cell lines were treated with simvastatin, 17-AAG and R115777, agents which inhibit Ras signalling. Cell proliferation was inhibited in both cell lines. The spectrum of NIH 3T3 cells was not affected by treatment. In contrast, in the ras transfected cells growth inhibition was associated with an average 35 +/- 5% drop in PC levels and a comparable drop in PC/NTP. Thus the MRS visible increase in phosphocholine is associated with Ras activation, and response to treatment is associated with partial reversal of phosphocholine increase in ras transfected cells. MRS might therefore be a useful tool in detecting Ras activation and its inhibition following targeted therapies.",

Cardiac death is due not only to coronary artery disease, but also to left ventricular (LV) abnormalities (fibrosis, dysfunction) and arrhythmogenic triggers, such as autonomic imbalance. 2. Nitric oxide deficiency could be a key mediator leading not only to coronary atherosclerosis, but also to LV abnormalities and autonomic imbalance. 3. It may be possible to screen for the above abnormalities (e.g. echocardiography and brain natriuretic peptide levels for LV abnormalities, 24 h tapes for autonomic imbalance and QT interval analysis). 4. Once individuals are identified as being at high risk, a range of interventions is possible (e.g. intensive statin therapy or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors if LV abnormalities or autonomic imbalance are found).", 
    "94": "Oxidative stress may be an important factor in the development of diabetic complications. Advanced glycation end-products have drown attention as potential sources of oxidative stress in diabetes. We investigated the protective effects of fluvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, on oxidative DNA damage from reactive oxygen species or advanced glycation end-products in vitro, as well as effects of main fluvastatin metabolites and other inhibitors of the same enzyme, pravastatin and simvastatin. Protective effects were assessed in terms of the DNA breakage rate in a single-stranded phage DNA system in vitro. DNA was exposed to either reactive oxygen species or advanced glycation end-products. Fluvastatin and its metabolites showed a strong protective effect comparable to those seen with thiourea and mannitol, though pravastatin and simvastatin did not exert clear protective effects. Furthermore, fluvastatin reduced the mutagenesis by reactive oxygen species or advanced glycation end-products in Salmonella typhimurium test strains. Both pravastatin and simvastatin still lacked protective activity. Fluvastatin and its metabolites protect against oxidative DNA damage and may reduce risk of consequent diabetic complications.", 
    "95": "Cardiovascular diseases are frequent in elderly subjects and these patients also frequently present with hyperlipidaemia. Therapy must take current uncertainties into account and, in the absence of therapeutic studies carried out in the elderly, is typically based on a case-by-case approach. Raised cholesterol levels remain a significant risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) in the elderly. Although the relative risk of CHD tends to diminish with increasing age, this reduction is accompanied by an increase in absolute risk (i.e. the number of events) as the frequency of the illness increases markedly with age. The results of major outcome studies with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), when analysed according to patient age, indicate that the benefits of these agents are not merely confined to younger individuals. However, the elderly form a unique patient population: the proportion of women is greater and the profile of cardiovascular illnesses is characterized, among other things, by a greater incidence of cerebrovascular accidents. Moreover, the potential widespread treatment of hyperlipidaemia in the elderly has profound economic implications. Under these circumstances, the clinical practice recommendations depend upon a reasonable extrapolation of epidemiological and therapeutic data obtained from middle-aged men. At present, treatment is therefore aimed at patients with the most severe forms of hyperlipidaemia, generally in the secondary prevention setting, taking into account the patient's life expectancy.", 
    "96": "Three classes of hypolipidaemic drugs are used currently for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Resins, by binding bile acids, prevent the intestinal reabsorption of these acids. Subsequently, an increase in their synthesis appears to arise from intracellular cholesterol. The intracellular cholesterol concentration decreases and leads to an increase in the number of LDL receptors. The consequence is a decrease in plasma LDL-cholesterol level. Statins act by inhibiting HMGCoA reductase, a key enzyme which regulates intracellular cholesterol synthesis. Thus, the intracellular cholesterol level decreases and leads to an activation of SREBP2 (Sterol regulatory element-binding protein), a transcription factor which, by binding to the promoter of the LDL-receptor gene, activates its transcription and thus the numbers of LDL receptors. The final effect is a decrease in plasma LDL-cholesterol. Fibrates activate a transcription factor named PPAR alpha. This activation results in binding with RXR, another transcription factor. The PPAR alpha/RXR heterodimer binds to the promoter of specific genes increasing their transcription and thus the proteins coded by these genes. This mechanism accounts for the increase in lipolysis (modulation of apoCIII and lipoprotein lipase) and in HDL-cholesterol (modulation of apoAI and apoAII genes).", 
    "97": "Hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for the development of coronary heart disease. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have been used as first-line drugs because of both their superior cholesterol lowering effect and reliable safety profile. Since there are many patients whose plasma cholesterol level does not reach the therapeutic target even if reductase inhibitors are available, more effective drugs have been strongly required for a long time. Atorvastatin, one of the most recently introduced statins, produces greater plasma LDL-cholesterol reductions than other statins. This pronounced effect of atorvastatin seems to be due to its long-lasting action, presumably a reflection of longer residence time of atorvastatin and its active metabolites in the liver. Clinical trials of atorvastatin have also demonstrated marked plasma triglyceride reductions. The triglyceride reduction with atorvastatin seems to stem from the following two indirect mechanisms, limiting VLDL secretion from the liver and increase in clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein via induced LDL receptors from plasma. Eleven clinical trials of atorvastatin, which have been developed in Japan, clearly demonstrated its ability to reduce LDL-C levels more strongly and in significantly more patients to LDL-C treatment goals than other reductase inhibitors with similar safety profiles. Therefore, atorvastatin adds a new dimension to the effective management of hypercholesterolemia and combined hyperlipidemia.", 
    "98": "As a class, statins are remarkably effective in reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and several of these drugs have now been shown to reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality. However, several important controversies in the use of statins remain to be answered by clinical trials. For example, it is controversial whether marked cholesterol reduction to levels below 100 mg/dL would further reduce the incidence of coronary heart disease. Furthermore, concerns about differences among statins for nonlipid effects has raised the concern that the assumption of a class effect is premature until head-to-head clinical trials are completed.",

This trial will enroll up to 200 patients for the primary end point of the mean change in intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery. This effect will be evaluated over a treatment duration of 12 months. Secondary end points include the effects of statin therapy on inflammatory and hemostatic markers (C-reactive protein and fibrinogen).",

    "103": "The 6-week efficacy and safety of atorvastatin versus simvastatin was determined during a 54-week, open-label, multicenter, parallel-arm, treat-to-target study. In all, 1,424 patients with mixed dyslipidemia (triglyceride 200 to 600 mg/dl [2.26 to 6.77 mmol/L]) were stratified to 1 of 2 groups (diabetes or no diabetes). Patients were then randomized to receive either atorvastatin 10 mg/ day (n = 730) or simvastatin 10 mg/day (n = 694). Efficacy was determined by measuring changes from baseline in lipid parameters including low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B. Compared with simvastatin, atorvastatin produced significantly greater (p < 0.0001) reductions from baseline in LDL cholesterol (37.2% vs 29.6%), total cholesterol (27.6% vs 21.5%), triglycerides (22.1% vs 16.0%), the ratio of LDL cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (41.1% vs 33.7%), and apolipoprotein B (28.3% vs 21.2%), and a comparable increase from baseline in HDL cholesterol (7.4% vs 6.9%). Atorvastatin was also significantly (p < 0.0001) more effective than simvastatin at treating the overall patient population to LDL cholesterol goals (55.6% vs 38.4%). Fewer than 6% of patients in either treatment group experienced drug-attributable adverse events, which were mostly mild to moderate in nature. Diabetic patients treated with either statin had safety characteristics similar to nondiabetics, with atorvastatin exhibiting superior efficacy to simvastatin. In conclusion, atorvastatin, at a dose of 10 mg/day, is more effective than simvastatin 10 mg/day at lowering lipids and reaching LDL cholesterol goals in patients with mixed dyslipidemia. Both statins are well tolerated with safety profiles similar to other members of the statin class.", 
    "104": "Recent studies have shown that statins are effective in reducing fasting low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride levels. However, it remains unknown if treatment with statins also lowers daily postprandial triglyceride concentrations, which may promote atherogenesis in type 2 diabetes subjects. Forty-one subjects with type 2 diabetes and combined hyperlipidemia who had stable glycemic control were randomly assigned to take simvastatin 20 mg (n = 27) or a placebo (n = 14) once daily for 12 weeks. The medication dosage was doubled after 4 weeks if a subject's LDL-C was not less than 130 mg/dL. Among these participants, 24 subjects (15 on simvastatin and 9 on placebo) agreed to take a meal tolerance test with isocaloric mixed meals (carbohydrate, 52%; fat, 33%, and protein, 15% of the daily caloric intake) and daytime hourly blood sampling from 8 AM to 4 PM. Simvastatin treatment reduced the fasting total cholesterol level from 237 +/- 5 to 178 +/- 6 mg/dL (-25%), the LDL cholesterol level from 150 +/- 6 to 87 +/- 5 mg/dL (-40%), and raised high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) level from 36 +/- 2 to 40 +/- 2 mg/dL (+11%) (all P <.001). Fasting and daily ambient triglyceride concentrations from 8 AM to 4 PM decreased significantly in response to simvastatin administration (P <.001), but not to the placebo (P =.305). Simvastatin treatment not only decreased total cholesterol and LDL-C levels and increased HDL-C levels effectively, it also decreased fasting, as well as daily postprandial triglyceride concentrations, but had no effect on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes subjects with combined hyperlipidemia.", 
    "105": "Differences in LDL and HDL subclass distribution contribute to increased CAD risk through a variety of mechanisms. The inherited disorder characterized by an abundance of small, dense LDL particles increased CAD risk 3-fold and is associated with rapid arteriographic progression. The metabolic milieu associated with the small LDL trait includes insulin resistance, increased IDL, increased susceptibility to oxidative damage, impaired reverse cholesterol transport, and increased post prandial lipemia. Recent evidence indicates that the LDL IIIa+b region are the LDL subclass regions most associated with atherosclerosis. Improvement in LDL subclass distribution has been associated with arteriographic improvement significantly more than LDLC change. Therapeutic treatments including diet, and many pharmacologic interventions have a differential response in subjects characterized by an abundance of either small, or large LDL particles. Individual patient information regarding LDL and HDL subclass distribution can be used to improve medical management of the CAD patient that results in improved outcomes.", 
    "106": "Statins inhibit the same biochemical pathway as aminobisphosphonates, therefore these cholesterol-lowering agents may have a beneficial effect on osteoporosis. This possibility has been supported by the finding that some statins also stimulate bone formation, and by observational studies suggesting that patients using statins have higher bone densities and lower fracture rates than controls. To assess whether statins have clinically significant effects on bone, we studied the frequency of fractures in a large randomised controlled trial of these agents.",

    "110": "Strategy for management of patients displaying hyperlipidemia has changed since the the first statin has been launched in France more than ten years ago. Following the first primary and secondary prevention studies conducted with hyperlipidemic subjects, results have been extended to patients with cholesterol levels within normal range both in primary (AFCAPS/TexCAPS) and secondary (CARE) prevention. Drug therapy has been simplified with targets tailored to the patient's risk.", 
    "111": "Despite these important results from intervention studies with statins, other crucial questions remain. Among these questions the first one concerns the possibility that cardiovascular benefits demonstrated with statins are also partly due to other (pleiotropic) effects. This was first hypothesised when statins were proven to be efficacious after short term treatments (one year in the regression studies). The second question is whether we can extend the benefit observed in populations included in published trials to primary prevention of stroke and to the groups less well represented in previous trials including women, elderly patients. The current trends and economic strains of every health care systems have focused on evidence-based medicine and cost-efficacy studies. ROLE OF TRIGLYCERIDES: Beyond LDL-cholesterol there is clear emergence of a role of triglyceride in cardiovascular disease as well as new data on pathophysiology of the so-called reverse cholesterol transport. Recent trials including patients with hypertriglyceridemia as well as a decline of the benefit observed in hypertriglyceridemic patients strongly suggest that the use of statins may have its own limitation. IMPORTANCE OF DIET: Finally, translating results of recent trials in clinical practice remains a challenge for treating physicians who face poor compliance and difficulties in implementing diet in patients.",

Locking the I domain closed abolished constitutive and activatable adhesion. The isolated locked-open I domain bound as well as the activated alphaLbeta2 heterodimer, and binding was abolished by reduction of the disulfide. Lovastatin, which binds under the conformationally mobile C-terminal alpha-helix of the I domain, inhibited binding to ICAM-1 by alphaLbeta2 with wild-type, but not locked-open I domains. These data establish the importance of conformational change in the alphaL I domain for adhesive function and show that this domain is sufficient for full adhesive activity.", 
    "113": "Although there is little information from primary or secondary prevention trials on cholesterol-lowering medication in diabetic patients, the reduction of elevated cholesterol is widely recommended for this group. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends drug therapy in diabetic patients if low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol remains at > 130 mg/dl, or > 100 mg/dl in patients with macroangiopathy, after dietary intervention. When cholesterollowering medication is indicated, the choice of the drug must take into account the other lipid abnormalities that are often present and the need to maintain optimal glycaemic control. In the present study we compared the efficacy and safety of the novel HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor atorvastatin at the dose of 10 mg/day with simvastatin , lovastatin and pravastatin at doses of 10, 20 and 20 mg/day, respectively, and placebo, in type 2 diabetic patients with moderate elevation of LDL-cholesterol with or without elevation of triglycerides. All the quoted agents are enzyme inhibitors effective in lowering LDL-cholesterol in humans. The efficacy endpoints were the mean per cent changes in plasma LDL-cholesterol (primary), total cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol concentrations from baseline to the end of treatment (24 weeks). Atorvastatin at a dose of 10 mg/day produced: (1) a significant reduction in LDL-cholesterol (-37%) in comparison with equivalent doses of simvastatin (-26%), pravastatin (-23%), lovastatin (-21%), and placebo (-1%); (2) HDL-cholesterol increases (7.4%) comparable to or greater than those obtained with simvastatin (7.1%), pravastatin (3.2%), lovastatin (7.21%), and placebo (-0.5%); (3) a significantly greater reduction in total cholesterol (- 29%) than that obtained with simvastatin (-21%), pravastain (-16%), lovastatin (-18%), and placebo (1%); and (4) a significantly greater reduction in triglycerides than that obtained with all the other drugs and placebo. In all treatment groups no significant variation in fibrinogen concentration was observed. All reductase inhibitors studied had similar levels of tolerance. There were no incidents of persistent elevations of serum aminotransferases or myositis."
