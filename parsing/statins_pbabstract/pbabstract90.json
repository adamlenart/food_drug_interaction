There are no clinical studies evaluating the effect of 'low-dose' statins on serum levels of angiogenesis regulators in diabetic subjects. We aimed to explain how low doses of statins modify the serum concentrations of two potent proangiogenic factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), in patients with type 2 diabetes.",

Measurements of VEGF and bFGF in serum were taken using the BD\u2122 Cytometric Bead Array.", 
    "2": "Statins used in low doses in patients with type 2 diabetes reduce the serum concentration of VEGF and bFGF which suggests antiangiogenic potential of these doses. Nevertheless, this effect could be neutralized by postprandial hyperglycemia.", 
    "3": "Several reviews and meta-analyses have demonstrated the incontrovertible benefits of statin therapy in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). But the role for statins in primary prevention remained unclear. The updated 2013 Cochrane review has put to rest all lingering doubts about the overwhelming benefits of long-term statin therapy in primary prevention by conclusively demonstrating highly significant reductions in all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and the need for coronary artery revascularization procedures (CARPs). More importantly, these benefits of statin therapy are similar at all levels of CVD risk, including subjects at low (<1% per year) risk of a MACE. In addition to preventing myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and death, primary prevention with statins is also highly effective in delaying and avoiding expensive CARPs such as angioplasties, stents, and bypass surgeries. There is no evidence of any serious harm or threat to life caused by statin therapy, though several adverse effects that affect the quality of life, especially diabetes mellitus (DM) have been reported. Asian Indians have the highest risk of premature coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes. When compared with Whites, Asian Indians have double the risk of CAD and triple the risk of DM, when adjusted for traditional risk factors for these diseases. Available evidence supports the use of statin therapy for primary prevention in Asian Indians at a younger age and with lower targets for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-high density lipoprotein (non-HDL-C), than those currently recommended for Americans and Europeans. Early and aggressive statin therapy offers the greatest potential for reducing the continuing epidemic of CAD among Indians.",

A rare side effect of statin medication is the induction of autoimmune illnesses, including myasthenia gravis (myasthenia). Here we present two patients with seropositive myasthenia that developed 4 weeks after initiation of atorvastatin, increasing the total reported patients to seven. Reviewing recent literature we highlight the connections between statins, auto-immunity and myasthenia. Statins may favour T-cell phenotypes that reduce cell-mediated immunity but could increase antibody-mediated humoral immunity.",

Although angiographic complex culprit morphology (Ambrose classification) and thrombus were more common in STEMI than in NSTEACS (84% vs 62%, p=0.002; 51% vs 5%, p<0.0001, respectively), SYNTAX score was lower in STEMI (8.6 \u00b1 5.4 vs 11.5 \u00b1 7.1, p=0.01). In patients with STEMI, culprit echogenicity was more hypoechoic (64% vs 40%, p=0.01), and the incidence of plaque rupture, attenuation and \"microcalcification\" were significantly higher (56% vs 17%, p<0.0001; 85% vs 69%, p=0.01; 77% vs 61%, p=0.04, respectively).

We tested the 8 most potent drugs using patient-derived GBM cancer stem cell-like lines. Notably, the statins were active in vitro; they inhibited GBM cell proliferation and induced cellular autophagy. Moreover, the statins enhanced, by 40-70 fold, the pro-apoptotic activity of irinotecan, a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor currently used to treat a variety of cancers including GBM. Our data suggest that the mechanism of action of statins was prevention of multi-drug resistance protein MDR-1 glycosylation. This drug combination was synergistic in inhibiting tumor growth in vivo. Compared to animals treated with high dose irinotecan, the drug combination showed significantly less toxicity.",

    "13": "This study was performed to investigate the hypolipidemic, antiobese, and antiatherogenic effects of resveratrol in apoE-deficient mice fed an atherogenic diet (20% fat and 1% cholesterol). These animals were fed an atherogenic diet containing 0.02% lovastatin (w/w) or 0.02% resveratrol (w/w) for 12 weeks. Resveratrol and lovastatin supplementation significantly reduced either the body weight or epididymal fat weight without altering the food intake and food efficiency ratio. Resveratrol significantly decreased the plasma total cholesterol (total-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) concentrations, apoB/apoA-I ratio, hepatic cholesterol, and triglyceride (TG) contents, whereas significantly it increased the plasma HDL-C concentration compared with the control and lovastatin groups. Plasma and hepatic TG and plasma apoB levels were significantly lower in both the lovastatin and resveratrol groups than in the control group without altering the plasma apoA-I concentration. Both resveratrol and lovastatin significantly decreased hepatic fatty acid and TG synthesis, whereas they increased fatty acid oxidation (\u03b2-oxidation) except for the carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity compared with the control group. However, there was no difference in hepatic 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity among the groups, although hepatic acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase activity was significantly lower in the lovastatin groups than in the control group. In epididymal adipose tissue, resveratrol supplementation led to an increase in \u03b2-oxidation and decrease in TG synthesis, compared with the control group. Tissue morphology revealed that there were dramatic decreases in hepatic lipid droplets and aortic fatty streaks by resveratrol and lovastatin supplementation. This study demonstrates that resveratrol exerts not only antiobesity and hypolipidemic effects, but also protective effects for the liver and aorta through the modulation of lipid metabolism in both the liver and white adipose tissues.", 
    "14": "Aging is characterized by the loss of homeostasis that leads to changes in the biochemical composition of tissues, reduced ability to respond adaptively to environmental stimuli, and increased susceptibility and vulnerability to diseases including coronary artery diseases, carotid artery disease and brain vessel disease. Hypercholesterolemia is one of the primary risk factors for these pathologies, whose incidence is highly related to aging. Almost 25% of men and 42% of women older than 65 years have a serum total cholesterol level greater than 240 mg/dL. The mechanisms behind this age-related increase in plasma cholesterol are still incompletely understood, thus, the control of plasma cholesterol content in aged people is more challenging than in adults. In this review the different pharmacological approaches to reduce plasma cholesterol levels, particularly in aged people, will be discussed. In brief, current therapies are mostly based on the prescription of statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors) that are pretty effective but that exert several side effects. More attention should be given to potential drug interactions, potential age-related changes in drug pharmacokinetics, adverse effects such as myopathy and competing risks when statins are prescribed to old patients. In combination or in alternative to statin therapy, other agents might be required to reduce low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Among the available drugs, the most commonly prescribed are those addressed to reduce cholesterol absorption, to modulate lipoprotein lipase activity and bile acid sequestrants: even these pharmacological interventions are not exempt from side effects. The use of antioxidants or organoselenium compounds and the discovery of new proteins able to modulate exclusively LDL receptor recycling such as Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 and SEC24 offer new pharmacological approaches to selectively reduce the main causes of dyslipidemia.", 
    "15": "This study aims to improve the drug oral bioavailability by co-administration with flavonoid inhibitors of the CYP2C isozyme and to establish qualitative and quantitative (QSAR) structure-activity relationships (SAR) between flavonoids and CYP2C. A total of 40 naturally occurring flavonoids were screened in vitro for CYP2C inhibition. Enzyme activity was determined by measuring conversion of tolbutamide to 4-hydroxytolbutamide by rat liver microsomes. The percent inhibition and IC50 of each flavonoid were calculated and used to develop SAR and QSAR. The most effective flavonoid was orally co-administered in vivo with a cholesterol-reducing drug, fluvastatin, which is normally metabolized by CYP2C. The most potent CYP2C inhibitor identified in vitro was tamarixetin (IC50 = 1.4 \u03bcM). This flavonoid enhanced the oral bioavailability of fluvastatin in vivo, producing a >2-fold increase in the area under the concentration-time curve and in the peak plasma concentration. SAR analysis indicated that the presence of a 2,3-double bond in the C ring, hydroxylation at positions 5, 6, and 7, and glycosylation had important effects on flavonoid-CYP2C interactions. These findings should prove useful for predicting the inhibition of CYP2C activity by other untested flavonoid-like compounds. In the present study, tamarixetin significantly inhibited CYP2C activity in vitro and in vivo. Thus, the use of tamarixetin could improve the therapeutic efficacy of drugs with low bioavailability.", 
    "16": "Inter-individual variability exists in the statin (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor) lipid-lowering response, which is partially attributed to genetic factors. The polymorphic enzyme P450 oxidoreductase (POR) transfers electrons from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A enzymes, which metabolize atorvastatin and simvastatin. The POR*28 allele is associated with increased activity of CYP3A enzymes. We analyzed the association of the POR*28 allele with response to atorvastatin and simvastatin.",

The hypothesized effect of the POR*28 allele on the lipid-lowering response to CYP3A-metabolized statins can potentially be masked by relevant confounding or uncontrolled factors; therefore, further studies in different populations are required.", 
    "20": "Impaired cardiac \u03b2-adrenoceptor signaling is an important cause of sepsis-induced myocardial depression in man and experimental animals. We examined the effect of atorvastatin (ATR) pretreatment on myocardial \u03b21-adrenoceptor (\u03b21-AR) expressions and post-receptor signaling in a mouse model of sepsis (cecal ligation and puncture [CLP]). After 20 \u00b1 2 h of surgery, hearts were isolated for the measurement of left ventricular functions (left ventricular developed pressure, dp/dt(max) and dp/dt(min)) using Langendorff setup. Western blot was used to determine \u03b21-AR and G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 protein expressions. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was done to determine \u03b21-AR mRNA expression. Atorvastatin prevented sepsis-induced decrease in left ventricular functions, such as left ventricular developed pressure (CLP 75.90 \u00b1 0.53 vs. ATR 100.24 \u00b1 1.64 mmHg), dp/dtmax (CLP 3,742 \u00b1 71 vs. ATR 4,291 \u00b1 88 mmHg/s), and dp/dt(min) (CLP -1,010 \u00b1 24 vs. ATR -1,346 \u00b1 84 mmHg/s). Associated with functional impairments, sepsis decreased both myocardial \u03b21-AR protein and mRNA expressions by 52% \u00b1 9% and 62% \u00b1 7%, respectively. However, ATR treatment of CLP mice (ATR) preserved \u03b21-AR protein (96% \u00b1 11%) and mRNA (88% \u00b1 14%) expressions comparable to sham-operated level. Furthermore, it not only attenuated sepsis-induced decrease in basal cardiac adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate content (CLP 1.30 \u00b1 0.27 vs. ATR 6.30 \u00b1 0.67 pmol/mg protein), but also prevented its refractoriness to dobutamine stimulation (CLP 1.72 \u00b1 0.27 vs. ATR 10.83 \u00b1 1.37 pmol/mg protein). Atorvastatin also inhibited sepsis-induced increase in cardiac G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 protein expression (CLP 1.73 \u00b1 0.18-fold vs. ATR 1.10 \u00b1 0.18-fold), protein kinase A activity (CLP 1.12 \u00b1 0.14 vs. ATR 0.66 \u00b1 0.08 U/mg protein) and plasma catecholamines (CLP 138 \u00b1 22 vs. ATR 59 \u00b1 2 pg/mL). In conclusion, ATR seems to improve left ventricular functions in vitro through the preservation of \u03b2(1)-AR signaling in sepsis.",

In this study, we have constructed and phenotypically characterized deletion and conditional lon mutants in the model haloarchaeon Haloferax volcanii to elucidate the role of the unusual membrane-bound LonB protease in archaea. Hvlon could be deleted from the chromosome only when a copy of the wild type gene was provided in trans suggesting that Lon is essential for survival in this archaeon. Successful complementation of the lethal phenotype of \u0394Hvlon was attained by expression of the heterologous protease gene Nmlon from the haloalkaliphilic archaeon Natrialba magadii, meaning that the biological function of Lon is conserved in these organisms. Suboptimal cellular levels of Lon protein affected growth rate, cell shape, cell pigmentation, lipid composition and sensitivity to various antibiotics. The contents of bacterioruberins and some polar lipids were increased in the lon mutants suggesting that Lon is linked to maintenance of membrane lipid balance which likely affects cell viability in this archaeon. The phenotypes associated to a membrane-bound LonB protease mutant were examined for the first time providing insight on the relevance of this protease in archaeal physiology.",

Optimal use of 4 oral drugs (aspirin, \u03b2-blockers, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) in all eligible patients with AMI or unfractionated heparin in non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction was a highly cost-effective strategy (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios approximately US $3100 or less). Optimal use of reperfusion therapies in eligible patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction was moderately cost effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio \u2264$10,700). Optimal use of clopidogrel for all eligible patients with AMI or primary percutaneous coronary intervention among high-risk patients with non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction in tertiary hospitals alone was less cost effective.

    "31": "Preliminary evidence demonstrating that adding 0.5 mg of colchicine per day to statin and antiplatelet therapy reduced the risk of acute coronary events in patients with stable coronary artery disease has raised the hope that it may prove effective for the long-term secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. The ability of colchicine to suppress blood levels of inflammatory mediators and prevent cholesterol-crystal-induced neutrophil-mediated inflammation implicated in the progression and instability of atherosclerosis adds plausibility to this clinical observation. Early intestinal intolerance in some patients is well recognized, but clinical experience gained over more than half a century with the continuous use of colchicine for the prevention of neutrophil-mediated inflammation in patients with familial Mediterranean fever and gout indicates that low-dose long-term therapy is safe. Nonetheless, before colchicine can be recommended for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, further studies are required to confirm its safety and efficacy in a broad range of patients with coronary disease, and to determine whether doses of colchicine less than 0.5 mg/day might be effective and even better tolerated. Trials exploring the role of colchicine in the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndromes would also be of special interest but may require the use of doses higher than those used for long-term secondary prevention.",

As such, it is under consideration as a novel therapeutic, thus it is important to quantify the levels of simvastatin and its pharmacologically active and interconvertible metabolite, simvastatin hydroxy acid, that can be attained in the body. Methods exist to measure the concentrations of these compounds in biological media; however they do not maintain a physiological pH, and as a result do not accurately measure the ratio of these two compounds that exists in vivo. We developed a new method to measure simvastatin and simvastatin hydroxy acid more accurately in serum from mice by ultra high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We minimized the time that the compounds were in aqueous solution, and buffered samples to a physiological pH value of 7.4. Limits of quantification (LOQ) were 0.16 ng mL(-1) extract (1.3 ng mL(-1) serum) for simvastatin, and 8.3 ng mL(-1) extract (66 ng mL(-1) serum) for simvastatin hydroxy acid, respectively. No interconversion was observed, based on spike-and-recovery experiments of solutions containing both compounds. The method was applied using biological samples from mice challenged with house dust mite extract and simultaneously treated with subcutaneous simvastatin injection. Simvastatin hydroxy acid concentrations became significantly increased after a 2 week pre-treatment regime, whereas simvastatin concentrations were below the LOQ for all serum samples.",

Importantly, statins have additional beneficial effects independent of their effects on lipids. Recent studies have shown that statins reduce thrombosis via multiple pathways, including inhibiting platelet activation and reducing the pathologic expression of the procoagulant protein tissue factor. Many of the antithrombotic effects of statins are attributed to inhibiting prenylation of RhoA and effects on other intracellular signaling molecules such as NF-\u03baB and KLF2. These antithrombotic activities of statins likely contribute to the ability of statins to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular death.", 
    "46": "Published phase I and II trials with two fully human monoclonal antibodies to PCSK9 have provided comprehensive evidence that inhibiting PCSK9 is a very effective method to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). In all populations studied so far, whether on statins or LDL-C-reducing diet alone, with or without a genetic defect in the LDL receptor, and in subjects intolerant to statins, the LDL-C reductions have been large and consistent. Even the most efficacious statin, rosuvastatin, at its highest dose has not achieved such reductions. The clinical trials have established that monoclonal antibody therapy targeted to PCSK9 may be administered subcutaneously every two or four weeks. Current data suggest these drugs will provide an effective therapeutic option for LDL-C reduction and that, if proven safe in phase III trials, they will be as important to LDL-C control, and likely to cardiovascular disease risk reduction, as statins have been over the past three decades.", 
    "47": "The goal of this study was to integrate systems pharmacology and biochemical flux to delineate drug-induced rhabdomyolysis by leveraging prior knowledge and publicly accessible data. A list of 211 rhabdomyolysis-inducing drugs (RIDs) was compiled and curated from multiple sources. Extended pharmacological network analysis revealed that the intermediators directly interacting with the pharmacological targets of RIDs were significantly enriched with functions such as regulation of cell cycle, apoptosis, and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. A total of 78 intermediators were shown to be significantly connected to at least five RIDs, including estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), synuclein gamma (SNCG), and janus kinase 2 (JAK2). Transcriptomic analysis of RIDs profiled in Connectivity Map on the global scale revealed that multiple pathways are perturbed by RIDs, including ErbB signaling and lipid metabolism pathways, and that carnitine palmitoyl transferase 2 (CPT2) was in the top 1 percent of the most differentially perturbed genes. CPT2 was downregulated by nine drugs that perturbed the genes significantly enriched in oxidative phosphorylation and energy-metabolism pathways. With statins as the use case, biochemical pathway analysis on the local scale implicated a role for CPT2 in statin-induced perturbation of energy homeostasis, which is in agreement with reports of statin-CPT2 interaction. Considering the complexity of human biology, an integrative multiple-approach analysis composed of a biochemical flux network, pharmacological on- and off-target networks, and transcriptomic signature is important for understanding drug safety and for providing insight into clinical gene-drug interactions.", 
    "48": "Numerous risk factors for perioperative stroke have been identified and many are modifiable. Surgical patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease should be evaluated by a neurologist. Cardiac and cerebrovascular testing is critical in identifying patients at high risk for perioperative stroke. The identification and treatment of carotid disease in the context of upcoming surgery has been a source of controversy. Routine carotid revascularization performed with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery for incidentally discovered carotid stenosis is not recommended. Prior to aortic manipulation during CABG, epiaortic ultrasound should be performed to identify aortic atheromatous plaques. If possible, preoperative aspirin, beta blocker, statin, and angiotensin converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy should be continued in the perioperative period. Patients who are prescribed anticoagulation at high risk of thromboembolism should receive bridging anticoagulation during the perioperative period. The identification and prevention of postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) is central to stroke prevention. CABG patients should be initiated on beta blockade +/- amiodarone to prevent postoperative AF. Many practitioners have been traditionally nihilistic towards acute perioperative stroke treatment. Given the narrow therapeutic window of treatment options, candidacy is dependent on timely recognition. Intravenous and endovascular thrombolysis/therapies are viable options in selected patients under the guidance and expertise of a neurologist. This article will present the epidemiology of perioperative stroke, the pathophysiology, risk assessment and stratification for common surgeries. The article will additionally focus on treatment options including modifiable risk factor reduction and the perioperative management of medications.",

Totally 89 patients who continued dual aspirin and clopidogrel antiplatelet therapy for at least of 14 days were included into the further study. Test for platelet aggregation was performed according to the classical Born method. Genotyping of CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3 and CYP4F2*3 was done by using commercial probes from Applied Biosystems (UK). Patient age, weight and body weight index did not correlate significantly with platelet aggregation level both induced by ADP and epinephrine (P\u200a>\u200a0.05).

It has been suggested that the benefit of using statins to prevent atherosclerotic complications is less pronounced in people with high absorption of cholesterol. Recent data indicate that patients on hemodialysis have high absorption of cholesterol. Therefore, these patients may benefit from dietary counseling to reduce cholesterol intake, from functional foods containing plant sterols and stanols, and from drugs that interfere with intestinal absorption of sterols (i.e., ezetimibe, bile acid resins, and sevelamer).

In vitro, human mononuclear cells THP-1 were treated with fluvastatin, LPS and anti-beta2GPI/beta2GPI, then the TF expression on THP-1 cells was detected by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) or TF activity was detected by kit. TNF-alpha mRNA and its protein expression were investigated by RT-PCR and ELISA kit. The expression of phospho-NF-kappaB p65 and inhibitory protein of NF-kappaB (IkappaB-alpha) were measured by Western blotting. The results suggested that the expression of TF and TNF-alpha on THP-1 cells was significantly up-regulated with treatment of anti-beta2GPI/beta2GPI complex (100 mg x L(-1)), compared with that of untreated cells (P < 0.05). Fluvastatin (50 mg x L(-1)) could decrease TF (mRNA and activity) expression and the level of TNF-alpha (mRNA and protein) in THP-1 cells with anti-beta2GPI/beta2GPI complex. The expression of TF and TNF-alpha was shown in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, anti-beta2GPI/beta2GPI complex could downregulate IkappaB-alpha levels and increase the levels of phospho-NF-kappaB p65. And these effects of anti-beta2GPI/beta2GPI complex could be blocked by fluvastatin. In conclusion, fluvastatin may interfere the expression and regulation of NF-kappaB signal transduction pathway, thereby inhibit the effects of anti-beta2GPI/beta2GPI on activation of THP-1 cells, by decreasing the expression of TF and TNF-alpha.", 
    "69": "Simvastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, is prescribed worldwide to patients with hypercholesterolemia. Although simvastatin is well tolerated, side effects like myotoxicity are reported. The mechanism for statin-induced myotoxicity is still poorly understood. Reports have suggested impaired mitochondrial dysfunction as a contributor to the observed myotoxicity. In this regard, we wanted to study the effects of simvastatin on glucose metabolism and the activity of legumain, a cysteine protease. Legumain, being the only known asparaginyl endopeptidase, has caspase-like properties and is described to be involved in apoptosis. Recent evidences indicate a regulatory role of both glucose and statins on cysteine proteases in monocytes. Satellite cells were isolated from the Musculus obliquus internus abdominis of healthy human donors, proliferated and differentiated into polynuclear myotubes. Simvastatin with or without mevalonolactone, farnesyl pyrophosphate or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate were introduced on day 5 of differentiation. After 48 h, cells were either harvested for immunoblotting, ELISA, cell viability assay, confocal imaging or enzyme activity analysis, or placed in a fuel handling system with [\u00b9\u2074C]glucose or [\u00b3H]deoxyglucose for uptake and oxidation studies. A dose-dependent decrease in both glucose uptake and oxidation were observed in mature myotubes after exposure to simvastatin in concentrations not influencing cell viability. In addition, simvastatin caused a decrease in maturation and activity of legumain. Dysregulation of glucose metabolism and decreased legumain activity by simvastatin points out new knowledge about the effects of statins on skeletal muscle, and may contribute to the understanding of the myotoxicity observed by statins.",

    "102": "Breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) are members of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter family located in the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes that mediate biliary excretion of many drugs and endogenous compounds. BCRP and MRP2 have overlapping substrate profiles. Predicting drug disposition in the setting of altered transport function has important clinical significance. This investigation was designed to establish an in vitro model system to evaluate the impact of impaired Mrp2 and Bcrp function on hepatobiliary drug disposition. To achieve Bcrp knockdown by RNA interference (RNAi), sandwich-cultured hepatocytes (SCH) from Mrp2-deficient (TR(-)) and wild-type (WT) rats were infected with adenoviral vectors to express shRNA targeting Bcrp (Ad-siBcrp) at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1-10. MOI of 5 was identified as optimal. At MOI of 5, viral infection as well as WT or TR(-) status was statistically significant predictors of the rosuvastatin (RSV) biliary excretion index (BEI), consistent with the known role of Bcrp and Mrp2 in the biliary excretion of RSV in vivo in rats. Relative to WT rat SCH, marginal mean BEI (%) of RSV in TR(-) rat SCH decreased by 28.6 (95% CI: 5.8-51.3). Ad-siBcrp decreased marginal mean BEI (%) of RSV by 13.3 (7.5-9.1) relative to SCH infected with adenoviral vectors expressing a nontargeting shRNA (Ad-siNT). The BEI of RSV was almost ablated in TR(-) rat SCH with Bcrp knockdown (5.9 \u00b1 3.0%) compared to Ad-siNT-infected WT rat SCH (45.4 \u00b1 6.6%). These results demonstrated the feasibility of Bcrp knockdown in TR(-) rat SCH as an in vitro system to assess the impact of impaired Bcrp and Mrp2 function. At MOI of 5, viral infection had minimal effects on RSV total accumulation, but significantly decreased marginal mean taurocholate total accumulation (pmol/mg of protein) and BEI (%) by 9.9 (7.0-12.8) and 7.5 (3.7-11.3), respectively, relative to noninfected SCH. These findings may be due to off-target effects on hepatic bile acid transporters, even though no changes in protein expression levels of the hepatic bile acid transporters were observed. This study established a strategy for optimization of the knockdown system, and demonstrated the potential use of RNAi in SCH as an in vitro tool to predict altered hepatobiliary drug disposition when canalicular transporters are impaired.", 
    "103": "Lipid-lowering treatment with statins is one of the most effective therapeutic strategies in cardiovascular medicine because they reduce cardiovascular risk in both primary and secondary prevention. Despite the well-established links between low-density lipoprotein and cardiovascular risk, the clinical benefit from statin treatment is not fully explained by their lipid-lowering potential. A number of pleiotropic effects of statins have been described over the past decade, and their ability to suppress global oxidative stress is probably one of the most important mechanisms by which they exert their beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system. In this Forum, there are review articles discussing the molecular mechanisms by which statins modify redox signaling in the vasculature and the heart. They exert direct effects on the vascular wall and the myocardium or indirect by targeting the interactions between the cardiovascular system and adipose tissue or circulating cell types. The review articles in this Forum follow a translational approach and link the molecular mechanisms by which statins modify cardiovascular redox signaling with their clinical benefit in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.",

After the intake of Rosuvastatin, his triglycerides decreased to a minimum of 220 mg/dL. In order to augment the action of Rosuvastatin, he was advised to take 1.5 mg of Nichi Glucan food supplement, which is a 1,3-1,6 Beta Glucan derived from the black yeast, Aureobasidium pullulans, daily for 2 months. At the end of 2 months, his triglyceride levels decreased from 523 mg/dL (at start of the study) to 175 mg/dL. His VLDL levels, which were 104.6 mg/dL at the start of the study decreased to 35 mg/dL and the HDL cholesterol levels increased from 27 to 38 mg/dL. This is a first of its kind report on the effect of the black yeast derived 1,3-1,6 Beta Glucans on dyslipidemia not associated with diabetes.

Organic anion transporting polypeptides (human: OATPs, rodent: Oatps) are important for uptake of endogenous and exogenous compounds into hepatocytes. Thus, alteration of OATPs/Oatps expression level may affect pharmacokinetics of various drugs. In this study, we investigated the alteration of OATPs/Oatps expression levels and function by oxidative stress, and the effect of alteration of those on pharmacokinetics of a typical OATPs/Oatps substrate pravastatin. OATPs/Oatps expression levels and function were altered by H2O2-induced oxidative stress in in vitro experiments. The alteration of Oatps expression by oxidative stress also occurred in in vivo experiments. Oatp1a1, Oatp1a4 and Oatp1b2 expression in the liver were decreased in rats fed powdery diet containing 2% inosine, which induces oxidative stress through activation of xanthine oxidase, for 1 day. The decrease in Oatps expression levels by oxidative stress caused the suppression of pravastatin uptake to the liver, and resulted in high plasma concentration of pravastatin and low biliary excretion. In conclusion, oxidative stress induces alteration of OATPs/Oatps expression and function in hepatocytes, resulting in alteration of pharmacokinetics of their substrates.",

    "110": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is not merely a disorder featuring renal dysfunction, but also accelerates the progression of cardiovascular disease. Recently, the prevalence of CKD has been increasing in parallel with that of metabolic syndrome, suggesting that these two disorders are closely related. Metabolic syndrome is generally characterized by several metabolic and cardiovascular features, including obesity, insulin resistance and hypertension, all of which are known to cause renal impairment. Hence, it is likely that metabolic syndrome could be a key factor in the development of renal disease. Among several factors associated with metabolic syndrome, lipid abnormality, in particular a high level of serum low-density lipoprotein, has been emerging as a cause of kidney injury. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that statin therapy for treating hyperlipidemia could slow the progression of renal disease, indicating that a treatment for lipid abnormality might prevent the progression of renal disease. In other words, statin therapy might be renoprotective in addition to its beneficial effect on the cardiovascular system. We are carrying out a clinical trial, the ASUCA trial, in which we examine whether statins might slow the progression of CKD in the Japanese population. We organized the multi-center clinical trial to investigate the effect of atorvastatin on estimated glomerular filtration rate in patients with CKD and lipid abnormality. In this paper, we discuss the outline and significance of this trial.",

The role of dyslipidemia in CKD progression, however, is not well understood. CKD patients are heterogeneous and may include those who are malnourished or have hypoalbuminemia associated with proteinuria and a low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Recent intervention trials showed no clear-cut benefits of statin treatment, particularly for CKD patients on dialysis. In CKD patients, multiple confounding variables such as proteinuria and the presence of cardiovascular disease may mask the effects of statins. Among them, proteinuria is a potent predictor of CKD progression (eGFR decline) and the development of end-stage renal disease. CKD patients are at high risk not only for end-stage renal disease, but also for cardiovascular disease, infection, malnutrition, and other comorbid conditions frequently associated with the elderly population. Evaluation and the target range of treatment of dyslipidemia should be individualized.",

The atherogenic dyslipidemia in diabetes (ADD) is characterized by high serum triglycerides, high small dense LDL levels, low HDL levels and postprandial lipemia. Insulin resistance is a primary cause for ADD. Though statins are highly effective for CVD prevention in DM but a significant residual CV risk remains even after optimal statin therapy. Fibrates, niacin and omega-3 fatty acids are used in addition to statin for treatment of ADD (specifically hypertriglyceridemia). All these drugs have some limitations and they are far from being ideal companions of statins. Many newer drugs are in pipeline for management of ADD. Dual PPAR \u03b1/\u03b3 agonists are in most advanced stage of clinical development and they have a rational approach as they control blood glucose levels (by reducing insulin resistance, a primary factor for ADD) in addition to modulating ADD. Availability of dual PPAR \u03b1/\u03b3 agnosits and other drugs for ADD management may improve CV outcomes and decrease morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients in future.",

Limitations of systemic statins are described along with alternative dosing strategies, including local applications and bone-targeting systemic preparations. The principal findings of this review are: (1) traditional oral dosing with statins results in minimal efficacy in the treatment of osteoporosis; (2) local applications of statins show promise in the treatment of accessible bony defects, such as periodontitis; and (3) systemically administered statins which can target bone or inflammation near bone may be the safest and most effective strategy in the treatment of osseous deficiencies.",

However, recent trials have reported that statins cause worsening of hyperglycemia and increase the risk of new-onset diabetes. The association between the diabetogenic effect of statins with intensive dose and accompanying major risk factors for diabetes has been demonstrated. However, statins do not appear to have a class effect on insulin sensitivity in non-diabetic patients. Numerous mechanisms have been suggested to explain how statins cause \u03b2-cell insulin secretory dysfunction and peripheral insulin resistance leading to incident diabetes. According to findings from an aggregate of large clinical trials, the benefits of statin treatment appear to outweigh the risk of new-onset diabetes. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to discontinue the use of statins for prevention of cardiovascular events because of its potential risk for development of incident diabetes.

The pharmacokinetics of SIM hydroxy acid (SIMA), the bioactive form of SIM, and the occurrence of SIM-induced myopathy are linked to the function of the organic anion transporting polypeptide (Oatp) hepatic uptake transporters. Genetic polymorphisms in SLCO1B1, the gene for human hepatic OATP1B1, cause decreased elimination of SIMA and increased risk of developing myopathy. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the most severe form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and is known to alter drug transporter expression and drug disposition. The purpose of this study was to assess the metabolism and disposition of SIM in a diet-induced rodent model of NASH. Rats were fed a methionine- and choline-deficient diet for 8 weeks to induce NASH and SIM was administered intravenously. Diet-induced NASH caused increased plasma retention and decreased biliary excretion of SIMA due to decreased protein expression of multiple hepatic Oatps. SIM exhibited increased volume of distribution in NASH as evidenced by increased muscle, decreased plasma, and no change in biliary concentrations. Although Cyp3a and Cyp2c11 proteins were decreased in NASH, no alterations in SIM metabolism were observed. These data, in conjunction with our previous data showing that human NASH causes a coordinated downregulation of hepatic uptake transporters, suggest that NASH-mediated transporter regulation may play a role in altered SIMA disposition and the occurrence of myopathy.",

Experimental studies have shown reciprocal relationships between insulin resistance (IR) and endothelial dysfunction. Hypercholesterolemia and hypertension have a synergistic deleterious effect on IR and endothelial dysfunction. Unregulated renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is important in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and hypertension. Various strategies with different classes of antihypertensive medications to reach target goals have failed to reduce residual CVD risk further. Of interest, treating moderate cholesterol elevations with low-dose statins in hypertensive patients reduced CVD risk by 35-40% further. Therefore, statins are important in reducing CVD risk. Unfortunately, statin therapy causes IR and increases the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. RAS inhibitors improve both endothelial dysfunction and IR. Further, cross-talk between hypercholesterolemia and RAS exists at multiple steps of IR and endothelial dysfunction. In this regard, combined therapy with statins and RAS inhibitors demonstrates additive/synergistic effects on endothelial dysfunction and IR in addition to lowering cholesterol levels and blood pressure when compared with either monotherapy in patients. This is mediated by both distinct and interrelated mechanisms. Therefore, combined therapy with statins and RAS inhibitors may be important in developing optimal management strategies in patients with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, or obesity to prevent CVD.\u2002\u2002",

Therefore, we hypothesized that atorvastatin and insulin therapies alone or in combination could have beneficial effects on endothelium-dependent vascular reactivity, oxidative stress, inflammation and metabolic parameters in Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats, a model of type 2 diabetes fed with atherogenic diet (GKAD). In parallel with the development of diabetes and lipid profile, the generation of oxidative stress was determined by measurement of lipid peroxides and oxidized proteins and the presence of inflammation was evaluated by assessing C-reactive protein (CRP). Additionally, endothelial dependent and independent vascular sensitivity to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside were evaluated. GKAD showed increased carbonyl stress, inflammation, fasting glycemia, dyslipidemia and endothelial dysfunction when compared to control GK rats. Noteworthy, supplementation with insulin deteriorated endothelial dysfunction while atorvastatin induced an improvement. Atorvastatin and insulin therapies in combination improved metabolic parameters, CRP levels and insulin resistance indexes and ameliorated endothelial dysfunction in GKAD rats while they were unable to reduce urinary 8-isoprostranes and plasma carbonyl compounds. The therapeutic association of atorvastatin and insulin provided a better metabolic control with a reduction in endothelial dysfunction in GKAD rats by a mechanism that involves an improvement in systemic inflammation.",

We report a case of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury that developed in a 63-year-old woman with previously undiagnosed hypothyroidism. Untreated hypothyroidism may have caused her hypercholesterolemia requiring statin treatment, and it is postulated that statin-induced muscle injury was aggravated by hypothyroidism resulting in her full-blown rhabdomyolysis. Although this patient was successfully treated with continuous venovenous hemofiltration and L-thyroxin replacement, rhabdomyolysis with acute kidney injury is a potentially life-threatening disorder.

In 36 CKD patients with hypertension and dyslipidemia, who were prescribing amlodipine 5\u2009mg and atorvastatin 10\u2009mg daily, the influences of exchanging to a combination drug containing equivalent doses of amlodipine and atorvastatin were observed for 6 months. Results. At the baseline, flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was reduced (2.4 \u00b1 0.3%), and proteinuria was significantly contributed to decrements of FMD (R (2) = 0.38, F = 3.7, df\u2009(6,29), and\u2009\u2009P < 0.01). Six months later from exchanging to combination drug, total cholesterol (TC, 197 \u00b1 5 to 183 \u00b1 3\u2009mg/dL,\u2009\u2009P < 0.01) and triglycerides (142 \u00b1 14 to 129 \u00b1 10\u2009mg/dL, P < 0.05) were decreased, but high density lipoprotein cholesterol (53 \u00b1 3 to 56 \u00b1 3\u2009mg/dL, P < 0.05) was increased. FMD was slightly albeit significantly improved to 2.7 \u00b1 0.3% (P < 0.05). No serious adverse effects were seen by the combination drug. Subanalysis for the patients with considerable reductions of TC demonstrated that the combination drug decreased proteinuria and high sensitive CRP (P < 0.05 for both). Conclusion. Our data indicate that proteinuria constitutes a determinant of a reduced FMD. The present results implicate that combination drug is useful to improve adherence and suggest that atorvastatin refines endothelium function as well as lipid profiles in CKD patients.",

The aim of the present study was to examine the potential effects of atorvastatin loading prior to primary PCI on coronary endothelial function and inflammatory factors in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). A total of 60 patients with STEMI were randomized into three groups: Loading dose (80 mg atorvastatin prior to PCI; n=20), regular dose (20 mg atorvastatin prior to PCI; n=20) and control (without atorvastatin prior to PCI; n=20). The plasma samples were collected prior to, and immediately, 6 and 24 h after PCI in all the patients. The plasma concentrations of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), nitric oxide (NO), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were examined using ELISA. The plasma eNOS levels immediately and 24 h after PCI were significantly higher in the regular dose group compared with the other groups. However, there were no significant differences in the plasma eNOS concentration prior to and 6 h after PCI, or in the plasma NO concentration at any of the time-points among the three groups. The plasma IL-6 levels prior to PCI were significantly lower in the loading dose group compared with the other groups; however, there were no significant differences in the plasma concentration of IL-6 following PCI or in the concentrations of TNF-\u03b1 and ICAM-1 at any of the time-points among the three groups. In conclusion, atorvastatin loading in patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI may not have protective effects on endothelial function and the inflammatory reaction.", 
    "195": "Microneedles (MNs), a physical skin permeation enhancement technique, facilitate drug delivery across the skin, thus enhancing the number of drugs that can be delivered transdermally in therapeutically relevant concentrations. The micropores created in the skin by MNs reseal because of normal healing processes of the skin, thus limiting the duration of the drug delivery window. Pore lifetime enhancement strategies can increase the effectiveness of MNs as a drug delivery mechanism by prolonging the delivery window. Fluvastatin (FLU), a HMGCoA reductase inhibitor, was used in this study to enhance the pore lifetime by inhibiting the synthesis of cholesterol, a major component of the stratum corneum lipids. The study showed that using FLU as a pretreatment it is possible to enhance the pore lifetime of MN-treated skin and thus allow for sustained drug delivery. The skin recovered within a 30-45-min time period following the removal of occlusion, and there was no significant irritation observed due to the treatment compared to the control sites. Thus, it can be concluded that localized skin treatment with FLU can be used to extend micropore lifetime and deliver drugs for up to 7 days across MN-treated skin.",

While non-statin lipid-lowering drugs improve lipid parameters, their impact on clinical outcomes is less clear, thus necessitating an even closer look at ancillary effects. Recent studies have reported the potential cardiometabolic effects of statins, yet considerably less information has been published about cardiometabolic changes associated with non-statin lipid-lowering agents. This review describes the cardiometabolic profile of non-statin lipid-lowering agents--fibrates, niacin, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, ezetimibe, and bile acid sequestrants--and therefore aims to facilitate informed decision-making in the pharmacologic management of lipid abnormalities.", 
    "197": "There is evidence from epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical trials that high LDL cholesterol levels cause atherosclerotic heart disease. Current guidelines recommend an LDL cholesterol target of 70 mg/dL for patients at high or very high risk. The risk imposed by LDL cholesterol is modulated by the presence of additional risk factors such as age, smoking, and indices of inflammation. Epidemiologic studies as well as rare congenital conditions (e.g., hypobetalipoproteinemia) have shown that very low LDL cholesterol (lower than 70 mg/dL) levels are associated with a very low risk of cardiovascular disease. Analyses of randomized clinical trials have shown a greater benefit in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease (without an increase in adverse events) among those with very low achieved LDL (below 40 mg/dL). In one study of patients with achieved LDL cholesterol below 30 mg/dL, there was no increase in the usual adverse events compared to patients with LDL cholesterol levels above 30 mg/dL. High-intensity statin therapy is associated with a higher rate of transaminase elevations, but no hepatic failure, a very small risk of myopathy, and an increased risk of developing diabetes. However, the small increase in the risk of developing diabetes is much smaller than the marked lowering of cardiovascular risk. The duration of statin therapy may be important in studies of primary prevention and early, probably low-dose statin therapy, may achieve primordial prevention of atherosclerotic disease.", 
    "198": "Lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels is a worthwhile intervention in older (more than 65-70 years of age) subjects, since age itself is a powerful predictor of vascular disease risk. Although studies have not consistently demonstrated an overall beneficial effect on total mortality, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are favorably affected. The drugs most extensively studied are statins, but similar results are at least suggested for other agents. The efficacy, safety, and benefits of statins make them the drugs of choice. Statin intolerance can be managed and should not lead immediately to an abandonment of therapy. In cases in which it cannot be overcome, other lipid-lowering drugs, either singly or in combination, can be used, although their side effects are generally more problematic and their benefits are less prominent. In older patients, prevention of disability from stroke, heart disease, or peripheral vascular diseases may be as important a goal as an overall beneficial effect on mortality, which, in the long run, is unavoidable.", 
    "199": "Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) plays an important role in reverse cholesterol transport, with decreased CETP activity increasing HDL levels. Formation of an alternative splice form lacking exon 9 (\u03949-CETP) has been associated with two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in high linkage disequilibrium with each other, namely rs9930761 T>C located in intron 8 in a putative splicing branch site and rs5883 C>T in a possible exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) site in exon 9. To assess the relative effect of rs9930761 and rs5883 on splicing, mini-gene constructs spanning CETP exons 8 to 10, carrying all four possible allele combinations, were transfected into HEK293 and HepG2 cells. The minor T allele of rs5883 enhanced splicing significantly in both cell lines whereas the minor C allele of rs9930761 did not. In combination, the two alleles did not yield greater splicing than the rs5883 T allele alone in HepG2 cells. These results indicate that the genetic effect on CETP splicing is largely attributable to rs5883. We also confirm that \u03949-CETP protein is expressed in the liver but fails to circulate in the blood.",

    "204": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents a serious public health concern. It has been associated with a significant burden of cardiovascular disease and studies have linked decreases in estimated glomerular filtration rate to higher incidences of cardiovascular events and mortality. Evidence from randomized clinical trials have shown that statins are a safe and effective treatment for improving cardiovascular outcomes in primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention in patients with CKD; despite this, statins are often underutilized in these patients. In addition to cardiovascular benefits, statin therapy may be associated with improvements in renal function in patients with kidney disease. Some statin treatment regimens have been shown to slow decline in kidney function, and some trials have found that intensive statin therapy improved kidney function. This review examines improved cardiovascular outcomes with statin treatment in patients with CKD (excluding end-stage renal disease) and investigates the effects of statin therapy on kidney function.", 
    "205": "The prophylactic benefit of statins in reducing the incidence of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) has been investigated in several studies with conflicting results. We sought to investigate whether statin pretreatment prevents CI-AKI in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).", 
    "206": "A total of 2198 CAD patients who underwent PCI, except for those undergoing dialysis or who died within 7 days after angioplasty, were analyzed from the ICAS (Ibaraki Cardiovascular Assessment Study) multicenter registry. Analyzed subjects were divided into 2 groups according to statin pretreatment: statin pretreatment (n=839) and non-statin pretreatment (n=1359). Selection bias of statin pretreatment was adjusted by propensity score-matching method: pretreatment statin (n=565) and non-statin pretreatment (n=565). CI-AKI was defined as an increase in serum creatinine of \u2265 25% or 0.5mg/dl from baseline within 1 week of contrast medium exposure.", 
    "207": "A total of 192 (8.7%) patients developed CI-AKI. No significant differences were observed in baseline patient characteristics between the statin and non-statin pretreatment groups after propensity score matching. In the propensity score-matched groups, the incidence of CI-AKI was significantly lower in patients with statin pretreatment than in those without statin pretreatment (3.5% vs.10.6%, odds ratio [OR]: 0.31, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.18-0.52, P<0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that statin pretreatment remained an independent negative predictor of CI-AKI (OR: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.18-0.53, P<0.001) among propensity score-matched subjects.",

    "209": "Statins are among the most commonly prescribed drugs worldwide in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases and their effectiveness is largely acknowledged. The consumption of statins increased four-fold during the 2000-2010 decade in Italy and national and regional control policies were developed. Restrictions to reimbursement were fixed at the national level, whereas co-payment was introduced in some, but not all, regions. The aim of the present study is to assess the impact of such policies on the consumption of statins in Italy between 2001-2007 among outpatients.", 
    "210": "The statin use was measured in terms of defined daily doses per 1,000 inhabitants per day (DDD/1000 inh. day) from May 2001 to December 2007. The study was conducted in 17 out of 21 regions, nine of which had implemented a co-payment policy. Time trends in consumption before and after the introduction of co-payment policies and reimbursement criteria were examined using segmented regression analysis of interrupted time-series, adjusting for seasonal components.", 
    "211": "The consumption of statins increased by 22.9 DDD/1000 inh. day in May 2001 to 54.7 DDD/1000 inh. day in December 2007. On average, there was a 1.7% increase in statin use each month before the national guideline changed while the increase was about 0.5% afterwards. The revision of the reimbursement criteria was associated with a significant decrease in level (coefficient = -2.80, 95% CI -3.70 to -1.90 p-value <0.001) and trend (coefficient = -0.33, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.29 p-value <0.001). The introduction of co-payment was associated with a significant change in trend of consumption so that the overall use of the drug increased by 0.04 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.07, p-value < 0.001) DDD/1000 inh. day per month in the post-intervention period, but there was no evidence of a change in level of consumption (p-value = 0.163).", 
    "212": "Consumption of statins in Italy increased almost three-fold during the study period. The restriction to reimbursement Interventions was associated with an immediate drop and a decrease in trend of statin use, while the regional copayment was associated with a small increase in trend of statin use.", 
    "213": "Neuroinflammation is involved in the death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) after optic nerve injury. The purpose of this study was to determine whether systemic simvastatin can suppress neuroinflammation in the optic nerve and rescue RGCs after the optic nerve is crushed. Simvastatin or its vehicle was given through an osmotic minipump beginning one week prior to the crushing. Immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR were used to determine the degree of neuroinflammation on day 3 after the crushing. The density of RGCs was determined in Tuj-1 stained retinal flat mounts on day 7. The effect of simvastain on the TNF-\u03b1-induced NF-\u03baB activation was determined in cultured optic nerve astrocytes. On day 3, CD68-positive cells, most likely microglia/macrophages, were accumulated at the crushed site. Phosphorylated NF-\u03baB was detected in some astrocytes at the border of the lesion where the immunoreactivity to MCP-1 was intensified. There was an increase in the mRNA levels of the CD68 (11.4-fold), MCP-1 (22.6-fold), ET-1 (2.3-fold), GFAP (1.6-fold), TNF-\u03b1 (7.0-fold), and iNOS (14.8-fold) genes on day 3. Systemic simvastatin significantly reduced these changes. The mean \u00b1 SD number of RGCs was 1816.3\u00b1232.6/mm(2) (n\u200a=\u200a6) in the sham controls which was significantly reduced to 831.4\u00b1202.5/mm(2) (n\u200a=\u200a9) on day 7 after the optic nerve was crushed. This reduction was significantly suppressed to 1169.2\u00b1201.3/mm(2) (P\u200a=\u200a0.01, Scheffe; n\u200a=\u200a9) after systemic simvastatin. Simvastatin (1.0 \u00b5M) significantly reduced the TNF-\u03b1-induced NF-\u03baB activation in cultured optic nerve astrocytes. We conclude that systemic simvastatin can reduce the death of RGCs induced by crushing the optic nerve possibly by suppressing astroglial NF-\u03baB activation.",

Post-hoc analysis stratified by baseline AMD severity showed no benefit from treatment in those who had advanced AMD in the fellow eye before enrolment: OR 0.97 (0.27-3.52), p = 0.96, after adjusting for age, sex and smoking. However, there was a significant reduction in the risk of progression in the bilateral intermediate AMD group compared to placebo [adjusted OR 0.23 (0.07-0.75), p = 0.015].

Available as prescription formulations and dietary supplements, EPA and DHA are recommended by the American Heart Association for patients with coronary heart disease and hypertriglyceridemia. Dietary supplements are not subject to the same government regulatory standards for safety, efficacy, and purity as prescription drugs are; moreover, supplements may contain variable concentrations of EPA and DHA and possibly other contaminants. Reducing low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels remains the primary treatment goal in the management of dyslipidemia. Dietary supplements and prescription formulations that contain both EPA and DHA may lower TG levels, but they may also increase LDL-C levels. Two prescription formulations of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids are available in the U.S. Although prescription omega-3 acid ethyl esters (OM-3-A EEs, Lovaza) contain high-purity EPA and DHA, prescription icosapent ethyl (IPE, Vascepa) is a high-purity EPA agent. In clinical trials of statin-treated and non-statin-treated patients with hypertriglyceridemia, both OM-3-A EE and IPE lowered TG levels and other atherogenic markers; however, IPE did not increase LDL-C levels. Results of recent outcomes trials of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, fibrates, and niacin have been disappointing, failing to show additional reductions in adverse cardiovascular events when combined with statins. Therefore, the REDUCE-IT study is being conducted to evaluate the effect of the combination of IPE and statins on cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk patients. The results of this trial are eagerly anticipated."
