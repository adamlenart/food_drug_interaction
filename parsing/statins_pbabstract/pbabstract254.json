Whether rosuvastatin has a greater potential compared with other statins to damage the liver is unclear and the involved mechanisms are also unknown. However, rosuvastatin is taken up by hepatocytes more selectively and more efficiently than other statins, and this may reasonably represent an important variable to explain the hepatotoxic potential of rosuvastatin. Our report supports the view that a clinically significant risk of liver toxicity should be considered even when rosuvastatin is given at the range of doses used in common clinical practice.", 
    "1": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) in the UK affects approximately 3 million people, with >100,000 deaths annually. Mortality rates have halved since the 1980s, but annual NHS treatment costs for CHD exceed 2 billion pounds.",

    "3": "The IMPACT CHD model was used to calculate the number of life-years gained (LYG) from specific cardiological interventions from 2000 to 2010. Cost-effectiveness ratios (costs per LYG) were generated for each specific intervention, stratified by age and sex. The robustness of the results was tested using sensitivity analyses.", 
    "4": "In 2000, medical and surgical treatments together prevented or postponed approximately 25,888 deaths in CHD patients aged 25-84 years, thus generating approximately 194,929 extra life-years between 2000 and 2010 (range 143,131-260,167). Aspirin and beta-blockers for secondary prevention following myocardial infarction or revascularisation, for angina and heart failure were highly cost-effective (< 1000 pounds per LYG). Other secondary prevention therapies, including cardiac rehabilitation, ACE inhibitors and statins, were reasonably cost-effective (1957 pounds, 3398 pounds and 4246 pounds per LYG, respectively), as were CABG surgery (3239 pounds-4601 pounds per LYG) and angioplasty (3845 pounds-5889 pounds per LYG). Primary angioplasty for myocardial infarction was intermediate (6054 pounds-12,057 pounds per LYG, according to age), and statins in primary prevention were much less cost-effective (27,828 pounds per LYG, reaching 69,373 pounds per LYG in men aged 35-44). Results were relatively consistent across a wide range of sensitivity analyses.", 
    "5": "The cost-effectiveness ratios for standard CHD treatments varied by over 100-fold. Large amounts of NHS funding are being spent on relatively less cost-effective interventions, such as statins for primary prevention, angioplasty and CABG surgery. This merits debate.", 
    "6": "Accumulating evidence reveals that statins possess pleiotropic properties beyond cholesterol reduction, which may contribute to the attenuation of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV). Recent in vitro data suggest that statins could down-regulate chemokine receptors. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that simvastatin ameliorates CAV development via the inhibition of chemokine receptor expression in an inbred rat model of cardiac transplantation.",

Donor hearts from Fisher 344 rats were transplanted heterotopically into Lewis rat recipients. CsA was administered at 1.5 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks post-operatively. In addition, recipients were treated daily with simvastatin or vehicle for 8 weeks. Donor hearts were harvested for histopathologic and immunohistochemical examination.

    "10": "Sepsis, an infection-induced inflammatory syndrome, is a leading and increasing cause of mortality worldwide. Animal and human observational studies suggest statins may prevent the morbidity and mortality associated with the sepsis syndrome. In this Review, we describe the demonstrated mechanisms through which statins modulate the inflammatory response associated with sepsis. These mechanisms include effects on cell signalling with consequent changes at the transcriptional level, the induction of haem oxygenase, the direct alteration of leucocyte-endothelial cell interaction, and the reduced expression of MHC II. Since statins do not target individual inflammatory mediators, but possibly reduce the overall magnitude of the systemic response, this effect could prove an important distinguishing feature modulating the host response to septic insults. This work establishes the biological plausibility needed for future trials of statins in critical illness.",

Thresholds for treatment were a total cholesterol >3.5 mmol/l and either a history of cardiovascular disease or elevated estimated CHD risk, adjusted where necessary for ethnic differences. Separate analyses were performed for primary prevention risk thresholds of >15% and >30% over 10 years. The prevalence of previous myocardial infarction, angina, or stroke was higher in South Asian men than in Caucasian but the reverse was seen in women. More than 93% [95% confidence interval (CI) 88-97] of South Asian men and nearly 68% (95% CI 66-71) of Caucasian men older than 55 years have a CHD risk greater than 15% (equivalent to cardiovascular risk of 20%) and a cholesterol above 3.5 mmol/l and would be eligible for treatment with lipid-lowering drugs.

    "20": "The regular use of plant stanol esters reduced total serum cholesterol by -0.362 mmol/l [95% credibility interval (CrI) -0.31 to -0.41]. The corresponding placebo-adjusted reduction attributable to stanol esters when combined with statin was -0.385 mmol/l (95% CrI -0.18 to -0.61). The cost-effectiveness estimations were assessed for men and women separately at four different initial ages at which the regular use of stanol esters was assumed to be started. The base case cost per quality-adjusted life years gained by using stanol esters regularly ranged from 7436 to 20,999 Euro in men and from 34,327 to 112,151 Euro in women based on the initial starting age. According to uncertainty analysis, there is over a 90% probability that the use of plant stanol esters is cost-effective for men inclusively and for 60-year-old and older women assuming that decision-makers' maximum willingness to pay per quality-adjusted life year is 50,000 Euro.", 
    "21": "A recommendation that plant stanol ester-containing spreads be used as a part of daily diet replacing regular spread could be viewed as potentially cost-effective public health policy in the prevention of CHD in all adult men and in older age-groups of women with total serum cholesterol levels of 5 mmol/l or greater.",

Serum cholesterol level was closely related to the use of corticosteroids. Thus, an adjustment with the dose of corticosteroid was conducted; even taking account of the effects of steroids, RA disease activity indicated by patient's assessment for pain, physician's assessment, and swollen joint counts was significantly lower in patients with statins compared to those without.",

The statin group of drugs appear to have important anti-inflammatory effects and may have a role in the treatment of sepsis. However, current prescribing guidelines recommend that statin therapy is discontinued in critically ill patients. We found no evidence to support commencing statin therapy in patients with sepsis on an intensive care unit and low levels of evidence to support continuing established therapy in this patient population.", 
    "27": "The two immediate priorities when faced with acute myocardial infarction are 1) to be able to deliver electric cardioversion in case of need and 2) to rapidly start reperfusion therapy (angioplasty or thrombolysis). During the hospital phase, antiplatelet agents are given to all, betablockers should be used if there is no heart failure, and ACE-inhibitors are mostly indicated for patients with poor hemodynamics. At discharge, in addition to instructions regarding not smoking, a balanced diet, and regular physical exercise, a statin and antiplatelet therapy remain a long-term indication for all. ACE inhibitors should be continued in case of high blood pressure, heart failure or a left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%. The main benefit of betablockers is for patients with residual angina and/or chronic heart failure.",

These patients were divided into two groups: those who had been taking statins (S-group, n = 46), and those not taking statins, or controls (C-group, n = 41). Only patients whose LDL cholesterol was < 100 mg/dl at admission (average: 82 +/- 12 mg/dl) were included in the study. Troponin-T (TnT), creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, and high-sense C reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured before and 6 hr after PCI. The two groups were evaluated at 6 months clinical follow-up.",

Graded GTN (0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 120 microg/min) or 5% dextrose solution was then infused intravenously and BP was measured following each dose. Ruboxistaurin did not alter the slope of change in standing systolic BP (DeltasSBP/1n[GTN dose]) curve (P=0.272 analysis of covariance) or affect the DeltasSBP at the estimated GTN dose producing a 10-mm Hg reduction in sSBP from baseline on placebo (mean difference -0.9 mm Hg; 95% confidence of interval, -3.3-1.5). In conclusion, ruboxistaurin does not potentiate the acute BP-lowering effects of GTN.", 
    "33": "This study assessed the effects of clopidogrel, a CYP 2C9 inhibitor, on fluvastatin pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers. The effects of combined clopidogrel-fluvastatin treatment on platelet function were also determined. Subjects received 80 mg fluvastatin (extended-release formulation) alone on days 1 through 9, 80 mg fluvastatin and 300 mg clopidogrel (loading dose) on day 10, and 80 mg fluvastatin and 75 mg clopidogrel (maintenance dose) on days 11 through 19. Compared to treatment with fluvastatin alone, fluvastatin AUC was similar and C(max) increased marginally (15.7%) with concomitant treatment with clopidogrel. Platelet aggregation was inhibited by clopidogrel by 33% two hours after the loading dose and by 47% at steady state, similar to that reported for clopidogrel alone treatment. The authors conclude that coadministration of fluvastatin and clopidogrel has no clinically relevant effect on fluvastatin pharmacokinetics or on platelet inhibition by clopidogrel.",

Here, we investigated whether atorvastatin pre-treatment modulates inflammatory-induced barrier dysfunction of cultured human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC). Pre-treatment of immortalized HBMEC with atorvastatin (50 nmol/L to 1 micromol/L) dose-dependently prevented an inflammatory up-regulation of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1/CCL2 but not of interleukin-8/CXCL8 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression by tumor necrosis factor-alpha or interleukin-1beta. It antagonized an inflammatory up-regulation of claudin-3 expression while zonula occludens-1 and occludin protein levels remained unaltered. Like immortalized HBMEC, primary HBMEC also showed a reduction of claudin-3 and of inducible CCL2 expression following atorvastatin pre-treatment. On a functional level, atorvastatin pre-treatment of HBMEC strongly and dose-dependently reduced adhesion of activated T lymphocytes to pre-activated primary endothelium. Atorvastatin effects could partially be abolished by parallel mevalonate treatment. These anti-inflammatory effects of atorvastatin were observed already at a pharmacologically relevant concentration of 50 nmol/L. Our results obtained with human brain endothelial cells demonstrate how statins may partially prevent an inflammatory-mediated blood-brain barrier breakdown in humans.",

Of atorvastatin users (N = 131,222), 39% switched to simvastatin during the 13-month period after the implementation. The proportion of switching was higher in women (41%) than in men (36%). In May 2005, 48% of the new statin users received simvastatin. The proportion of new users receiving simvastatin increased rapidly after implementation of the new regulations to 68% in June 2005 and reached 92% in June 2006.

    "52": "The past several years have been marked by confusion and controversy concerning whether estrogens are cardioprotective. The issue is of utmost public health importance because coronary heart disease (CHD) remains the leading cause of death among postmenopausal women. Fortunately, a unifying hypothesis has emerged that reproductive stage is a major determinant of the effect of estrogens on atherosclerosis progression, complications, and plaque vulnerability. PREMENOPAUSAL YEARS: Premenopausal atherosclerosis progression seems to be an important determinant of postmenopausal atherosclerosis and thus the risk for CHD. Clearly, plasma lipids/lipoproteins influence this progression; however, estradiol deficiency seems to be the major modulator. Both monkeys and women with premenopausal estrogen deficiency develop premature atherosclerosis, an effect that can be prevented in both species by estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. PERIMENOPAUSAL/EARLY POSTMENOPAUSAL YEARS: During this stage, there are robust estrogen benefits. Monkeys given estrogens immediately after surgical menopause have a 70% inhibition in coronary atherosclerosis progression. Estrogen treatment prevented progression of atherosclerosis of women in the Estrogen in the Prevention of Atherosclerosis Trial. A meta-analysis of women younger than 60 years given hormone therapy had reduced total mortality (relative risk = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.39-0.95). LATE POSTMENOPAUSAL YEARS: This stage is one in which there are no or possible deleterious estrogen effects. Monkeys lose CHD benefits of estrogens when treatment is delayed. The increase in CHD events associated with initiating hormone therapy 10 or more years after menopause seems to be related to up-regulation of the plaque inflammatory processes and plaque instability and may be down-regulated by statin pretreatment.",

    "54": "Aortic sclerosis is associated with cardiovascular events in patients without coronary heart disease (CHD), but it is unclear whether this association exists in patients with established CHD or is independent of baseline cardiac disease severity. It is also unclear whether statins modify this association. In a prospective cohort study of 814 outpatients with established CHD and no evidence of aortic stenosis, the association of aortic sclerosis with subsequent cardiovascular events was examined using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. Of 814 participants, 324 (40%) had aortic sclerosis. During 4 years of follow-up, 10% with aortic sclerosis experienced a myocardial infarction (MI) compared with 5% of those without aortic sclerosis (hazard ratio [HR] 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 3.1, p = 0.02). This association was unchanged after adjustment for potential confounders and mediators (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3 to 4.8, p = 0.009). However, the association between aortic sclerosis and MI appeared to differ by statin use (p = 0.15 for interaction). Aortic sclerosis predicted subsequent MI in subjects not administered statins (adjusted HR 4.1, 95% CI 1.1 to 15.7, p = 0.04), but not in those administered statins (adjusted HR 1.7, 95% CI 0.8 to 3.9, p = 0.18). In conclusion, aortic sclerosis was present in 40% of patients with CHD and is independently associated with a 2.4-fold increased rate of subsequent MI. Statins may attenuate the increased risk of future MI in patients with aortic sclerosis.", 
    "55": "Saphenous veins grafts (SVGs) continue to be used as conduits for coronary bypass surgery in nearly 350,000 patients annually in the United States. A possible genetic contribution to SVG longevity has not been well studied.

Age at coronary bypass was 54 +/- 8 years, 61% were men, and 39% had diabetes mellitus. At the time of study entry, 76% were on statins. SVG patency (<70% diameter stenosis, no intervention), the primary study end point, was 60% at 5 years and 19% at 10 years. After adjustment for other factors associated with SVG patency (male gender, p = 0.007; low low-density lipoprotein, p = 0.016), 7 polymorphisms in 5 genes were associated with SVG patency (p <0.01). In conclusion, these data represent an initial step toward the use of a personalized genetic approach to coronary revascularization.", 
    "56": "Of the 55 million deaths that occur annually, 1 in 10 is attributable to stroke. As a consequence, cerebrovascular disease is the second leading cause of death worldwide, and stroke is among the most devastating consequences of vascular disease, causing long-term disability and incurring high personal, societal, and financial costs. However, stroke is a highly preventable disease in the majority of patients. The goal of stroke prevention strategies is to identify high-risk patients through the presence of modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors and to target these modifiable risk factors through the use of appropriate pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions. Clinical and epidemiologic studies point toward three major risk-reducing pharmacologic therapies that together may dramatically reduce stroke risk. First, landmark clinical trials have demonstrated that the reduction of blood pressure in persons at risk for cerebrovascular disease significantly reduces stroke risk. Second, ample evidence supports the use of antiplatelet therapy, such as aspirin, in patients at high risk for a cerebrovascular event. Third, an abundance of data suggests that lipid-lowering therapy with a statin reduces stroke risk in most moderate- to high-risk patients regardless of baseline cholesterol levels. Together, these data suggest that intensive therapy with agents from multiple drug classes that target two or more risk factors for cerebrovascular disease may provide additive-or even synergistic-reductions in stroke risk.", 
    "57": "An abundance of clinical data exists to support the ability of pharmacologic interventions to reduce risk for vascular events significantly; however, there remains a gap between this evidence and current clinical practice. Recent data from large-scale, placebo-controlled statin trials demonstrate that these agents dramatically reduce risk for cardiovascular events, even in moderate-risk patients with normal to moderately elevated cholesterol levels. Data from trials of a broad range of antihypertensives reinforce the value of blood pressure (BP) management and indicate that some of these agents may have additional benefits beyond BP reduction. Similarly, meta-analyses of randomized trials confirm that antiplatelet therapy prevents serious cardiovascular events in a wide range of high-risk patients. Each of these interventions alone has been demonstrated to reduce the risk for vascular events by approximately 25 to 30%. A combination approach utilizing intensive risk-reducing therapy with more than one of these agents has the potential to reduce the risk for vascular events by as much as 75%. Combined with nonpharmacologic risk reduction strategies, including exercise, diet, and smoking cessation, an opportunity exists to reduce the incidence of both first and recurrent cardiovascular events dramatically.", 
    "58": "This experiment was designed to determine whether Tribuli saponins (TS) relieve left ventricular remodeling (VR) after myocardial infarction (MI) in a murine hyperlipemia (HL) model. MI and HL models were induced and high and low doses of TS and simvastatin were administrated to the rats. Four weeks later, echocardiographic observation was performed and the left and right ventricular weight index (LVWI, RVWI) was calculated. Echocardiographic results showed that both high dose of TS and simvastatin had a beneficial effect on increasing fractional shortening (FS) and ejection fraction (EF), reducing left ventricular end diastolic volume (LVEDV), systolic volume (LVESV), left ventricular dimension end diastole (LVDd) and systole (LVDs), and decreasing LVWI, as compared to those in the HL-MI model group (p < 0.05, 0.01). Both medicines had little impact on thickness of the anterior and posterior wall. No significant difference was observed between each treatment group (p > 0.05). In conclusion, TS not only lowered serum lipidemia, but also relieved left ventricular remodeling, and improved cardiac function in the early stage after MI.", 
    "59": "The objectives of the study were to assess the effects of pravastatin on plasma HIV RNA, lipid parameters, and protease inhibitor (PI) concentrations in patients treated with PI-containing regimens and with total cholesterol (TC) > or = 5.5 mmol/L.", 
    "60": "A clinical trial including patients randomized to receive pravastatin or matching placebo for 12 weeks was implemented.", 
    "61": "Twelve patients were included in the pravastatin group and 9 in the placebo group. At week 12 (W12), no patient had experienced virological failure. Between week 0 (W0) and W12, the median differences for TC were -1.4 mmol/L in the pravastatin group and +0.2 mmol/L in the placebo group (p = .005); for LDL, they were -1.0 mmol/L and +0.3 (p = .007), respectively. A significant decrease of the PI concentration (12 hours after administration) ratio W12 - W0/W0 was noticed in the pravastatin group (-0.2 [interquartile range, -0.3 to -0.1] as compared with the placebo group (0.1 [IQR, 0.0 to 0.3]) (p = .03). When the study was restricted to patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir, a decrease from 3.8 microg/mL at baseline to 2.9 mug/mL at W12 was noticed in the pravastatin arm (p = .04) but not in the control arm (p = 1.00). No clinical adverse event reached a severity of grade 3.", 
    "62": "We observed in this study that the use of pravastatin in PI-treated patients was not associated with major change in the plasma HIV RNA on 12 weeks of follow-up. However, we found a trend of decrease of the trough PI concentration at W12, suggesting a possible drug-drug interaction of pravastatin on PI metabolism.", 
    "63": "The klotho gene and its protein product are mainly expressed in the kidney. The klotho protein induces suppression of multiple aging-related phenotypes, and homozygous klotho gene mutant mice display various senescent morbidity. Chronic inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) induces arteriosclerosis, while HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have pleiotropic vascular protective effects besides cholesterol lowering. Therefore, the present studies were performed to determine whether chronic NOS blockade would affect anti-ageing klotho protein expression. In addition, the effects of statins on klotho protein expression and arteriosclerosis in these rats were investigated.", 
    "64": "Forty-two rats were divided into 6 groups as follows: (1) control, (2) NOS blockade, (3) atorvastatin (10 mg/kg/day), (4) pitavastatin (3 mg/kg/day), (5) NOS blockade+atorvastatin, (6) NOS blockade+pitavastatin. To induce arteriosclerosis further, a cuff was placed around the left femoral artery in each rat. After 4 weeks observation, rats were killed and renal klotho expression and the level of arteriosclerosis were examined.", 
    "65": "The rats of chronic NOS inhibition developed hypertension, while statin treatment did not affect blood pressure in the rats with or without NOS blockade. Despite statin treatment, plasma levels of lipids did not differ among 6 groups. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that klotho protein was localized in the renal tubules. Chronic NOS inhibition markedly reduced renal klotho protein expression, while treatment with atorvastatin or pitavastatin completely prevented the reduction of klotho expression induced by NOS inhibition. In addition, statin treatment significantly improved arteriosclerotic lesions induced by NOS inhibition and cuff placement.", 
    "66": "Since statin treatment did not alter blood pressure or serum lipid profiles, a novel vascular protective effect of statins via enhancing anti-aging klotho protein expression is suggested.", 
    "67": "Guidelines for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease recommend the use of risk-assessment methods to identify high risk patients who can benefit from lifestyle changes and/or drug treatment. Although all these risk-prediction methods are based on the same principle, they produce different risk estimates. The aim of this study was to compare the most recent and widely used cardiovascular risk-prediction methods and the respective guidelines when applied to Italian cohorts.", 
    "68": "Seven different risk-assessment methods were applied to two groups of subjects, 536 healthy individuals and 426 diabetic patients. Sensitivity and specificity of Framingham-based risk-assessment methods were calculated using the Framingham full equation as the reference standard. The extent of concordance among the different risk-assessment methods was determined by kappa test. By using NCEP-ATPIII risk calculator, modified Sheffield tables, Joint European Societies charts, Joint British Societies charts, Italian CUORE Project charts, European SCORE charts and New Zealand National Heart Foundation charts in the group of 536 healthy subjects, lipid-lowering treatment would be recommended in 17.5%, 12.7%, 12.1%, 8.6%, 5.0%, 4.7%, and 1.1% subjects, respectively. By using the same risk-assessment methods in the group of 426 diabetic patients, treatment would be recommended for 100%, 82.9%, 66.9%, 77.7%, 43.0%, 74.9%, and 47.4% patients, respectively. The Joint British charts and the modified Sheffield tables showed the closest agreement with the reference standard.", 
    "69": "Our study confirms that the use of different risk-assessment methods in clinical practice can substantially change risk estimation and consequently statin prescription rate. The Framingham-based risk-assessment methods and particularly the NCEP-ATPIII guidelines select for lipid-lowering treatment a higher number of subjects than those identified according to European and Italian recommendations.", 
    "70": "The objective of this study was to assess expectations of effect when using statins in a treatment population. Further the aim was to examine factors, including history and concurrent risk of coronary heart disease, associated with a higher and lower treatment belief.", 
    "71": "Eight hundred and twenty-nine (829) Swedish patients using statins completed postal questionnaires about their health, life style, cardiovascular risk factors and expectation of the treatment. Expected treatment benefit was used as outcome measurement.", 
    "72": "A medical history of coronary heart disease did not affect treatment expectations. Patients with a high risk of cardiovascular disease reported a slightly lower expectation of the treatment effect at a 10-year perspective (p<0.01) but not at shorter time perspectives. Low satisfaction with the explanation of the purpose of the treatment and a poor perceived control of own health was associated with a more negative view on treatment benefit.", 
    "73": "The rationale applied by physicians prescribing statins does not seem to relate to the patients' expectations, whereas factors relating to the patient-physician relationship, the social situation and the perceived control of health seem to affect patient belief.", 
    "74": "The association between patients' poor satisfaction of treatment explanation and a low belief in treatment benefits emphasizes the importance of the patient-physician communication. It is suggested that clinical tools are developed in order to identify patients with poor belief in treatment benefit since tailored education for this group might reduce the risk of non-compliance and subsequently reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.", 
    "75": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, more commonly known as 'statins', are a novel class of drugs widely used for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia in patients with established cardiovascular disease as well as those at high risk of developing atherosclerosis. Published chromatographic-mass spectrometric methods for the quantification of presently available seven statins, atorvastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, rosuvastatin and pitavastatin are reviewed. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in combination with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is the analytical technique of choice for the quantification of statins in biological samples. This review envisages that most of the methods used for quantification of statins are in plasma and they are suitable for therapeutic drug monitoring of these drugs.", 
    "76": "The association polymer system of cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP) and Pluronic F-127 (PF-127) was used to create intermittent release devices for mimicking the daily injection of simvastatin that has been reported to stimulate bone formation. To enhance solubility in water, prodrug simvastatin was modified by lactone ring opening, which converts the molecule to its hydroxyacid form. CAP/PF-127 microspheres incorporating simvastatin acid were prepared by a water-acetone-oil-water (W/A/O/W) triple emulsion process. Devices were then fabricated by pressure-sintering UV-treated blank and drug-loaded microspheres. Using a multilayered fabrication approach, pulsatile release profiles were obtained. Delivery was varied by changing loading, number of layers, blend ratio, and incubation conditions. To determine the cellular effects of intermittent exposure to simvastatin acid, MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured with either alternating or sustained concentrations of simvastatin acid in the medium, and DNA content, alkaline phosphatase activity, and osteocalcin secretion were measured. For all three cell responses, cultures exposed to simvastatin acid showed higher activity than did control cultures. Furthermore, cell activity was greater for cells cultured with intermittent concentrations of simvastatin acid compared to cells that were constantly treated. These results imply that devices intermittently releasing simvastatin acid warrant further study for locally promoting osteogenesis.", 
    "77": "The influence of a high cholesterol (HC) diet on brain pathology is being recognized increasingly and is of immense interest. Previous findings from our laboratory demonstrated that a high cholesterol diet increases gliosis, astrocytic reactivity and neuroinflammation in both wild type (WT) and apolipoprotein knockout (ApoE-/-) mice. In the present study, we analyzed whether this increase in astrocytic reactivity, monitored by the number of cells in the hippocampus labelled with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), could be reduced by the use of rosuvastatin, a potent competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. Furthermore, we studied the effect of rosuvastatin on changes in lipoprotein levels and weight gain, and their correlation to gliosis, in mice fed a high cholesterol diet. A significant increase in weight, total-cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels were observed in WT and ApoE-/- mice on a HC diet. The number of GFAP labelled cells was found to be significantly increased in mice on a HC diet and reduced in rosuvastatin-treated WT and ApoE-/- mice on a HC diet. A significant reduction of weight, total-cholesterol and LDL levels was observed in rosuvastatin-treated WTHC mice. Significant correlations were found between changes in body weight, GFAP labelled cells and plasma total-cholesterol levels in WT and ApoE-/- mice. However, the correlations were found to be weaker for the GFAP labelled cells in the ApoE-/- mice. The results indicate that the observed reduction of gliosis by rosuvastatin treatment may be due to mechanisms that are independent of its lipid-lowering effect.", 
    "78": "The purpose of this study was to examine hepatocyte mitochondrion respiratory chain in rats subjected to ethanol and CCl4 administration within 4 weeks to induce an experimental hepatitis. Oxygen consumption was determined as a measure of mitochondrion respiration chain function. The development of liver pathology was accompanied by fat accumulation, fibrosis, triglycerides and lipid peroxidation increase. Respiratory chain characteristics damage was found. Endogenous oxygen consumption by hepatocytes isolated from pathological liver was found 34% higher compared to control. Exogenous malate and pyruvate substrates delivery didn't stimulate cell respiration. Rotenone (the inhibitor of the I complex) decreased 27% oxygen consumption by pathological hepatocytes while dinitrophenol produced 37% cell respiration increase. States 3 (V3) and 4 (V4) mitochondrial respiration with malate + glutamate as substrates were found to be 70 and 56% higher accordingly compared to control level. V3 and Vd (dinitrophenol respiration) for mitochondria from pathological liver didn't differ from control when being tested with malate + glutamate or succinate as substrates. Cytochrome c oxidase activity increased (+ 80%) as compared to control. Administration of hypolipidemic agent simvastatin simultaneously with ethanol and CC14 resulted in decrease liver fat accumulation, fibrosis and peroxidation products. Simvastatin administration caused hepatocyte endogenous respiration decrease while malate + pyruvate, dinitrophenol or rotenone delivery produced oxygen consumption alterations similar to control. However, when isolated mitochondria from liver of simvastatin treated animals being tested the decrease of oxidative phosphorylation coupling for substrates malate + glutamate was found. While simvastatin did not cause changes in cytochrome c oxidase activity. We propose the hypothesis that the NCCR complex in rat mitochondria with experimental toxic hepatitis works extensively on superoxydanion production. Alterations of SCCR, Coenzyme Q-cytochrome c-reductase, cytochrome c oxidase and ATP-synthase activities have an adaptive nature to compensate for impaired NCCR function.", 
    "79": "Numerous effective strategies for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in high-risk patients have now been established. We sought to calculate the cumulative benefit of combining multiple strategies for preventing recurrent events in patients with a history of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack.", 
    "80": "A comprehensive literature search was undertaken to identify meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials reporting on the efficacy of secondary prevention strategies. The baseline incidence of vascular events was modeled from the Life Long After Cerebral Ischemia study. Strategies were combined on a multiplicative scale and cumulative risk reductions were computed over a 5-year interval.", 
    "81": "The combination of 5 proven strategies applied to survivors of an initial stroke or transient ischemic attack--dietary modification, exercise, aspirin, a statin, and an antihypertensive agent--could result in a cumulative relative risk reduction of 80%. Given a 5-year major cardiovascular event rate of 24%, this translates to a number needed to treat of about 5. Further gains would result from applying multimodality therapy over longer intervals and enriching the base strategy with dual antiplatelet therapy, high-dose statins, and more intensive blood pressure-lowering. Even more benefit would be present in high-risk subgroups with the addition, where appropriate, of carotid endarterectomy, moderate intensity oral anticoagulants, glycemic control, and smoking cessation.", 
    "82": "At least four-fifths of recurrent vascular events in patients with cerebrovascular disease might be prevented by application of a comprehensive, multifactorial approach.", 
    "83": "Aortic valve stenosis is the most common indication for surgical valve replacement in the United States and Europe. For years, this valve lesion was thought to be a passive degenerative disease. In the past decade there have been a number of studies indicating that the risk factors for valvular heart disease are the same as those for vascular atherosclerosis. This correlation with atherosclerosis and valvular heart disease indicates that medical therapy may have a role in slowing the progression of this disease process. Currently, the retrospective studies indicate that medical therapy slows the progression of this disease. The prospective data are currently conflicting in terms of the final outcomes for treating the disease process with medical therapy. This review outlines the growing number of clinical studies implicating the potential for medical therapy in this patient population.", 
    "84": "The \"pleiotropic\" effects of statins have been the centre of a considerable research activity. Among the numerous experimental and clinical studies of this field, some focused on the effects of statins on blood pressure (BP), while others reported data on BP together with other parameters. Some of the animal or human studies do not show an association between statin treatment and BP changes, whereas others usually report mild but significant reductions. Among the latter, all clinical studies using ambulatory BP recordings show a significant drop in both systolic and diastolic BP in hypertensive patients. In addition, accumulating evidence has identified a number of statin actions that may be involved in BP lowering. Overall, current evidence suggests that statins can be associated with a mild beneficial effect on BP, but further research is needed to clarify the exact magnitude of this action, as well as its clinical relevance.", 
    "85": "Risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) are highly co-prevalent but poorly identified and treated. The Screening for Heart Attack Prevention and Education (SHAPE) Task Force from the Association for Eradication of Heart Attack (AEHA) has recently proposed a new strategy that recommends screening for subclinical atherosclerosis and implementing aggressive treatment of \"vulnerable patients\". The Task Force has also envisioned future developments that may shift mass screening strategies to mass prophylactic therapy. The \"Polypill\" concept, introduced by Wald and Law suggests a combination of statin, low-dose antihypertensives, aspirin and folic acid, in a single pill, taken prophylactically by high risk population can cut CVD event rates by as much as 80%. In this communication, we review the challenges and promises of such a strategy. \"Polypill\" is but one of an astronomical number of possible multiconstituent pills (MCCP). Attractive as the MCCP concept is, it lacks evidence from randomized controlled trials, and begs numerous questions about the credibility of the concept, the design and synthesis of such complex pills, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, bioequivalence, \"class\" vs. unique properties, interactions, evidence of clinical efficacy and safety, regulatory approval, post-marketing surveillance, prescription vs. over-the-counter use, responsibility for initiating and monitoring therapy, patient education, counterfeiting and importation, reimbursement, advertisement, patent protection, commercial viability, etc. If these issues are favorably addressed, MCCP stand to dramatically change the manner in which CVD is prevented particularly in developing societies. Notwithstanding, assuming low commercial interests, realizing the promises of MCCP will demand serious attention from national public health policymakers. The clinical and regulatory implications of population-based secondary prevention (which rely on a different evidence base, and in which entirely different risk-benefit and cost-effectiveness considerations apply) remain issues for active debate.", 
    "86": "Nowadays the endothelium is considered a key determinant of vascular health. NO is the principal mediator of all endothelial protective effects, due to its antiinflammatory, antiproliferative, immunomodulatory and vasorelaxant properties. On the contrary, a growing body of evidence suggests that endothelial dysfunction is associated with cardiovascular events. Emerging data suggest that acute coronary syndromes (ACS) may involve a complex interplay between endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and thrombosis. Despite the success in reducing the mortality from acute cardiovascular events, the incidence of cardiovascular disease and its complication continues to increase. New insights into mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction, such as a better understanding of the regulation of vascular sources of oxygen radicals, may lead to novel therapeutic strategies with the potential to improve prognosis. The key pharmacological agents that improve clinical outcome in high-risk patients are statins, ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists. Compelling scientific evidence suggests that these medications are effective in improving endothelial function. The present review focuses on the potential importance of benefits on endothelium of these medicaments in the management of acute coronary syndromes.", 
    "87": "LDL-lowering therapies, predominantly involving statins, have been shown to significantly reduce cardiovascular events in asymptomatic subjects as well as in subjects with clinically established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, despite statin therapy, significant number of cardiovascular events continue to occur indicating the need for additional targets for atherosclerosis management. A number of pre-clinical studies have suggested that several HDL based therapies have the potential to stabilize or regress atherosclerosis consistent with epidemiologic evidence of an inverse relationship between coronary heart disease and HDL cholesterol levels. One such therapeutic approach involves direct infusion of HDL or HDL like molecules for rapid remodeling and stabilization of atherosclerosis. Pre-clinical and proof of concept type preliminary clinical studies suggest the feasibility and potential efficacy of this emerging new therapeutic paradigm.", 
    "88": "Acute coronary syndromes (ACS), i.e. unstable angina and myocardial infarction, are the leading causes of death in developed countries and developing countries alike. Lipid lowering intervention studies have demonstrated a 30% risk reduction in recurrent cardiovascular events and death, despite only modest improvement in angiographic stenosis. This discrepancy suggested that cholesterol lowering by statins may lead to stabilization of vulnerable plaques rather than reducing stenosis per s\u00e9. The predominant effect of statins is to lower lipid levels by inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis. Besides the lipid lowering effects, statins have also been shown to modulate the inflammatory status and improve endothelial function amongst others, commonly referred to as \"pleiotropic effects\". In the present review we will discuss different determinants which lead to plaque vulnerability and subsequently we will expand on the plaque stabilizing or \"pleiotropic\" effects of statin treatment.", 
    "89": "Several studies showed that postprandial plasma triglyceride (TG) concentrations are higher in patients with coronary heart disease. TG-rich lipoprotein remnants accumulated in the postprandial state are involved in atherogenesis and in events leading to thrombosis. Lipid lowering drugs, such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are of significant benefit in the primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerosis. Statins can decrease total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol as well as TG concentrations and improve postprandial lipoprotein metabolism. Since abnormal postprandial lipemia is associated with pathological conditions, its treatment is relevant. This review considers the effect of statins on postprandial lipemia.", 
    "90": "Sepsis is characterized physiologically by an aberrant systemic inflammatory response and microvascular dysfunction. While appropriate antibiotics and supportive care are essential in the management of the septic patient, therapies targeting specific aspects of the pathophysiology could have a significant impact on the morbidity and mortality associated with both sepsis and its sequlea, including acute lung injury (ALI). We have characterized several mediators of endothelial cell (EC) barrier function that may serve as novel therapies for sepsis-induced microvascular dysfunction including simvastatin, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), and activated protein C (APC). Notably, APC is already available for the treatment of severe sepsis, however, to date its mechanism of action has been unclear. While distinct in many ways, we have found that these agonists have in common the ability to induce dynamic rearrangement of the EC actin cytoskeleton that corresponds to barrier protection. In addition, we have extended our in vitro findings to relevant animal models of endotoxin-induced acute lung injury and have confirmed beneficial effects of both simvastatin and S1P which are associated with evidence of decreased vascular permeability in this setting. Moreover, our data also indicate that APC effects in sepsis may be largely due to augmentation of EC barrier function affecting decreased microvascular permeability. We speculate that the administration of direct modulators of EC barrier function and microvascular permeability, such as those described here, may ultimately become the standard of care for the septic patient.", 
    "91": "We tested the hypothesis that low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol induces angiotensin II type 1 receptor upregulation that, in turn, accounts for enhanced oxidative stress, and the subsequent endothelial dysfunction in patients with coronary artery disease.", 
    "92": "Brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation, serum 8-iso-prostaglandin F2alpha (8-isoprostane), and angiotensin II type 1 receptor density on platelets were measured in 19 patients with coronary artery disease, at entry and after 12 weeks of simvastatin therapy, 40 mg/day.", 
    "93": "At entry there was a significant linear correlation between: angiotensin II type 1 receptor density and plasma low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol; plasma 8-isoprostane and angiotensin II type 1 receptor density; and flow-mediated vasodilation and 8-isoprostane. Simvastatin therapy reduced low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, downregulated angiotensin II type 1 receptor, decreased 8-isoprostane, and improved flow-mediated vasodilation. The slopes of the presimvastatin and the postsimvastatin angiotensin II type 1 receptor/low-density lipoprotein relationships did not significantly differ, indicating that simvastatin caused a downregulation of angiotensin II type 1 receptor that could be predicted by the low-density lipoprotein reduction. In addition, simvastatin-mediated changes in 8-isoprostane could be predicted by angiotensin II type 1 receptor downregulation, and flow-mediated vasodilation improvement by changes in 8-isoprostane. A significant correlation existed between simvastatin-mediated changes in 8-isoprostane and angiotensin II type 1 receptor.", 
    "94": "The results of this study are consistent with the hypothesis that in coronary artery disease, the impairment of endothelial function is strongly associated with oxidative stress, oxidative stress with cellular angiotensin II type 1 receptor density, and the angiotensin II type 1 receptor density with low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, suggesting cause-effect relationships between these variables. In support for this notion, these baseline associations were not significantly disturbed by low-density lipoprotein-lowering therapy with simvastatin.", 
    "95": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitors, also called statins, are commonly used as lipid-lowering drugs that inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis. An anticancer effect, as a pleiotropic function of certain statins, has been hypothesized. In the present study, we investigated the effect of simvastatin, one of the natural statins, on cell proliferation, cell cycle, invasive activity, and molecular expressions associated with cell-extracellular matrix adhesion, signal transduction, and DNA synthesis in Tu167 and JMAR cells from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The addition of simvastatin resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth and migration into the extracellular matrix. Considerable morphological changes occurred after treatment with simvastatin, demonstrating loss of cell adhesion and disruption of actin filaments in cytoplasm. The inhibitory effect of simvastatin on cell proliferation seemed to be associated with cell cycle arrest and increased expression of p21, p27, and activated caspase-3. The expression of beta1-integrin, a counter adhesion for the extracellular matrix, phosphorylated FAK, and phosphorylated ERK was decreased by treatment with simvastatin. The proapoptotic effect of simvastatin was inhibited by treatment with mevalonate. cDNA microarray assay demonstrated that molecular changes resulting from treatment with simvastatin included the up-regulation of cell cycle regulators and apoptosis-inducing factors and the down-regulation of integrin-associated molecules and cell proliferation markers. Of down-regulated genes induced by simvastatin treatment, a significant depletion of thymidylate synthase was confirmed using western blot analysis. These results imply that simvastatin has the potential to be effective for the prevention of the growth and metastasis of cancer cells.", 
    "96": "Our understanding of aortic valve disease has improved in the past decade from considering it a degenerative process to the realization that it is an active biologic disease. Aortic valve disease, although it has a similar atherosclerotic pathogenesis to vascular disease, differs in terms of bone calcification. Determining the appropriate timing of statin therapy to slow the progression of bone formation in these lesions is essential for the routine use of these drugs in such patients. Knowledge of the biology of valve lesions will play an important part in understanding this disease and future treatment options for these patients.", 
    "97": "Observation of 250 men aged 35-65 years (middle age was 52 +/- 2 years) showed that prevalence of MS was 27%. Atorvastatine administration at dose of 10-20 mg per day for patients with ischemic heart disease and chronic obstructive lung disease associated with MS reduced during month administration the level of cholesterol, triglycerides, beta- and pre-beta-lipoproteids and increased the level of alpha-cholesterol in blood of these patients. Addition of atorvastatine to a common treatment patients with chronic obstructive lung disease improved as well the clinical picture of systemic inflammation process.", 
    "98": "Immune inflammation is an important link in pathogenesis of chronic heart failure (CHF). It has been proven that hyperproduction of proinflammatory cytokines (TNFa, IL-6, IL-1, etc) with associated endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress affect unfavorably clinico-hemodynamic parameters and prognosis of life of patients. However attempt to augment efficacy of treatment of CHF by means of inclusion of TNFa activity inhibitors in the complex of main remedies turned out unsuccessful. At present under discussion are perspectives of application in this category of patients of statins--lipid lowering drugs with pleiotropic properties most important of which is antiinflammatory action. Theoretical obstacles for the use of statins constitute available epidemiological data on reverse relationship between cholesterol level and mortality of patients with CHF in a framework of endotoxin-lipoprotein theory. At the same time preclinical and clinical experience has been accumulated evidencing for perspectiveness of such approach. Final solution of the problem of safety and feasibility of application of statins in CHF is expected after completion of prospective randomized trials GISSI-HF and CORONA.", 
    "99": "Patients (n=263, age 49-64 years) with persistent nonvalvular atrial fibrillation were subjected to controlled treatment aimed at restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm (n=134) or slowing of rate of ventricular contractions. Efficacy of complementary use of combination of simvastatin with aspirin, warfarin and aspirin for prevention of ischemic stroke was assessed in both of these strategies. First strategy, supplemented with combination of simvastatin and aspirin prevented ischemic stroke and lethal outcome most successfully, while the use of warfarin was unexpectedly associated with comparative elevation of risk of ischemic stroke. It is impossible to exclude that long term administration of warfarin in strategy of sinus rhythm maintenance attenuated advantages of normal rhythm in relation of lowering of stroke risk in AFFIRM study and other similar works. Contrary to known cardio-embolic mechanism of cerebral embolism in permanent atrial fibrillation main aim of the treatment in successful sinus rhythm maintenance may become prevention of arterio-arterial emboli.",

    "104": "Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at risk of excess mortality, predominantly owing to cardiovascular (CV) events. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) has been implicated in the perpetuation of the chronic inflammatory response in vascular disease. A Gly82-->Ser polymorphism in the RAGE gene, which is associated with enhanced RAGE signaling, is present more frequently in patients with RA than the general population. To investigate whether RAGE Gly82-->Ser polymorphism is associated with CV events in RA, we examined CV events, CV risk factors, features of RA and RAGE Gly82-->Ser polymorphism in 232 patients with RA attending a tertiary referral hospital. CV events, the duration and severity of RA, and risk factors for CV disease were determined using patient questionnaires, chart review, laboratory analysis and radiographs. DNA was typed for HLA-DRB1 genes and RAGE Gly82-->Ser polymorphism. The RAGE Ser82 allele, which is in linkage disequilibrium with the RA susceptibility allele HLA-DRB1*0401, was carried by 20% of patients. More than 20% of the cohort had suffered a vascular event; a shorter duration of RA, but not the RAGE genotype, was significantly associated with CV events. However, a history of statin use was protective. Thus, the RAGE Ser82 allele, associated with enhanced RAGE signaling, does not predispose to CV events in RA. However, treatment of hyperlipidemia with statins reduces the probability of a CV event.", 
    "105": "In the present work, five different spectrophotometric techniques for simultaneous determination of formulations containing atorvastatin calcium (ATOR) and fenofibrate (FENO) in various combinations are described. In ratio spectra derivative spectrophotometry, analytical signals were measured at wavelengths corresponding to either maximums or minimums for both drugs in first derivative spectra of ratio spectra obtained by using either spectrum as divisor. For the remaining four methods using chemometric techniques, namely, classical least squares (CLS), inverse least squares (ILS), principal component regression (PCR) and partial least squares (PLS), the calibrations were constructed by using the absorption data matrix corresponding to the concentration data matrix, with measurements in the range of 231 - 310 nm (Deltalambda = 1 nm) in their zero-order spectra. The linearity range was found to be 4 - 22 and 2 - 20 microg/ml for ATOR and FENO, respectively. The validity of the proposed methods was successfully assessed for analyses of both drugs in laboratory-prepared mixtures and in commercial tablet formulations.", 
    "106": "Elevated plasma triglyceride concentration is a common biochemical finding, but the evidence for the benefit of treating this lipid disturbance remains less robust than that for treating elevated low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. Part of the difficulty in the provision of specific recommendations has been the frequent coexistence of elevated triglycerides with other conditions that affect cardiovascular disease risk, such as depressed high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, obesity, metabolic syndrome, proinflammatory and prothrombotic biomarkers, and type 2 diabetes. Recent investigations of outcomes of cardiovascular disease when medications are used to reduce triglyceride levels suggest that, although a net benefit probably exists, both relative and absolute risk reductions seem underwhelming when compared with the benefit of reducing low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels with treatment. However, the totality of evidence suggests that elevated triglyceride levels likely contribute independently to increased risk of cardiovascular disease, although there is no consensus about appropriate target levels. Furthermore, severe hypertriglyceridemia is associated with an increased risk of acute pancreatitis, irrespective of its effect on risk of cardiovascular disease. We review the causes and classification of elevated triglyceride levels, the clinical manifestations of primary hypertriglyceridemia and the management of patients with elevated triglyceride levels.",

Follow-up of cohorts was 9 months after each policy change. Adherence to statin therapy was defined as > or = 80% of days covered. Relative to full-coverage policies, adherence to new statin therapy was significantly reduced, from 55.8% to 50.5%, under a fixed copayment policy (-5.4% points; 95% CI, -6.4% to -4.4%) and the subsequent coinsurance policy (-5.4% points; 95% CI, -6.3% to -4.4%). An uninterrupted increase in the proportion of patients initiating statin therapy after an acute myocardial infarction (1.7% points per quarter) was observed over the study period, similar to a Pennsylvania control population with full coverage. Sudden changes to full out-of-pocket spending, similar to Medicare's Part D \"doughnut hole,\" almost doubled the risk of stopping statins (adjusted odds ratio, 1.94, 95% CI, 1.82 to 2.08).",

    "110": "The association between the use of statins and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness, has been evaluated in many clinical studies; however, the results have been contradictory. We evaluated the effect of pitavastatin administration on laser-induced experimental choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in rats. Brown Norway rats received pitavastatin (1.0mg/kg per day) for 1day prior to laser-induced CNV and continued to receive the drug for 14days. Fluorescein angiograms were graded by masked observers. CNV area and thickness were assessed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran angiography and histology, respectively. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (Ccl-2; also known as MCP-1), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) mRNA levels were measured using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Pitavastatin-treated rats had significantly less fluorescence leakage compared with the vehicle-treated rats estimated by CNV score using fluorescein angiography. Both the area and the thickness of CNV in pitavastatin-treated rats were significantly reduced compared with the vehicle-treated rats. Gene expression of VEGF, Ccl-2, and ICAM-1 were significantly decreased by pitavastatin administration in experimental CNV. Thus, we demonstrated that the therapeutic dose of pitavastatin for human hypocholesterolemia effectively suppressed experimental CNV in rats. The use of pitavastatin may be helpful in preventing CNV development in AMD patients.", 
    "111": "Atherosclerosis may be more prevalent and more extensive in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) compared with the general population. Despite the fact that traditional and novel cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors are clinically important in these patients, it seems that inflammation--a key feature of RA--plays a crucial role in atherogenesis. Reducing the CVD burden in patients with RA is a more complex process than in the general population, mostly due to inadequate inflammation suppression as well as multiple concomitant drug therapy. Furthermore, there is no current consensus on whether RA patients should be treated as individuals at high-risk for vascular events. Statins have proved their efficacy in reducing CVD events in the general population. Despite the fact that they are not specifically indicated in RA, there is evidence supporting a beneficial effect on CVD risk factors as well as disease activity and progression. The present review considers the traditional and novel as well as the RA-specific CVD risk factors. The current evidence supporting the use of statins in this patient population is also discussed.", 
    "112": "Atorvastatin (ATV) limits infarct size (IS) by activating Akt and ecto-5-nucleotidase, which generates adenosine. Activated Akt and adenosine activate endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). When given orally, high doses (10 mg/kg) are needed to achieve full protection. We determined whether dipyridamole (DIP), by preventing the reuptake of adenosine, has a synergistic effect with ATV in reducing myocardial IS. In this study, rats received 3-days of the following: water, ATV (2 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)), DIP (6 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)), or ATV + DIP. In addition, rats received 3-days of the following: aminophylline (Ami; 10 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) or Ami + ATV + DIP. Rats underwent 30 min of myocardial ischemia followed by 4 h of reperfusion (IS protocol), or hearts were explanted for immunoblotting. As a result, IS in the controls was 34.0 +/- 2.8% of the area at risk. ATV (33.1 +/- 2.1%) and DIP (30.5 +/- 1.5%) did not affect IS, whereas ATV + DIP reduced IS (12.2 +/- 0.5%; P < 0.001 vs. each of the other groups). There was no difference in IS between the Ami alone (48.1 +/- 0.8%) and the Ami + ATV + DIP (45.8 +/- 2.9%) group (P = 0.422), suggesting that Ami completely blocked the protective effect. Myocardial adenosine level in the controls was 30.6 +/- 3.6 pg/microl. ATV (51.0 +/- 4.9 pg/microl) and DIP (51.5 +/- 6.8 pg/microl) caused a small increase in adenosine levels, whereas ATV + DIP caused a greater increase in adenosine levels (66.4 +/- 3.1 pg/microl). ATV and DIP alone did not affect myocardial Ser473 phosphorylated-Akt and Ser1177 phosphorylated-eNOS levels, whereas ATV + DIP significantly increased them. In conclusion, low-dose ATV and DIP had synergistic effects in reducing myocardial IS and activation of Akt and eNOS. This combination may have a potential benefit in augmenting the eNOS-mediated pleiotropic effects of statins.",

The alpha1-blockers provide fast amelioration of symptoms yet have no relevant impact on the risk of acute urinary retention or surgery. Combination therapy should be reserved for moderately or severely symptomatic patients with a high risk of progression; in the majority of patients the alpha1-blocker can be safely stopped after 6-12 mo.

Compared with placebo, there was a significant dose-dependent decrease with rosuvastatin in plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, apoB and apoC-III concentrations and in the apoB/apoA-I ratio, lathosterol:cholesterol ratio, HDL cholesterol concentration and campesterol:cholesterol ratio also increased significantly. Rosuvastatin significantly increased the fractional catabolic rates (FCR) of very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) and LDL-apoB and decreased the corresponding pool sizes, with evidence of a dose-related effect. LDL apoB production rate (PR) fell significantly with rosuvastatin 40 mg/day with no change in VLDL and IDL-apoB PR. Changes in triglycerides were significantly correlated with changes in VLDL apoB FCR and apoC-III concentration, and changes in lathosterol:cholesterol ratio were correlated with changes in LDL apoB FCR, the associations being more significant with the higher dose of rosuvastatin. In the metabolic syndrome, rosuvastatin decreases the plasma concentration of apoB-containing lipoproteins by a dose-dependent mechanism that increases their rates of catabolism. Higher dose rosuvastatin may also decrease LDL apoB production. The findings provide a dose-related mechanism for the benefits of rosuvastatin on cardiovascular disease in the metabolic syndrome.",

Overall, HDL-Lp-PLA(2) did not change but L55M polymorphism significantly influenced its response to fluvastatin.

    "122": "Breast cancer prevention has focused heavily on endocrine interventions using selective estrogen receptor modulators and aromatase inhibitors. Tamoxifen, the stereotypical selective estrogen receptor modulator, significantly reduces the breast cancer incidence in high-risk women. Selective estrogen receptor modulators and aromatase inhibitors, however, only prevent the development of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer and have no effect in reducing the risk of estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer, which has poor prognosis. Thus, preventive therapies for estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer are clearly needed. Recently, a number of novel chemopreventive agents targeting nonendocrine pathways have been developed and shown to prevent estrogen receptor-negative mammary tumorigenesis in animal models. These agents include rexinoids, selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and others. In this review, we discuss the effects of selective estrogen receptor modulators and aromatase inhibitors, as well as novel agents targeting nonendocrine pathways. We also discuss the promise of combining these agents for the effective prevention of all forms of breast cancer.", 
    "123": "3-Hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) may benefit the vasculopathy of insulin resistance independent of its lipid-lowering effects. Because imbalance of nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide anion (O(2)(-)) formation may lead to vascular dysfunction, we investigated the effect of statin on vasomotion of insulin-resistant state to clarify the mechanism by which statin ameliorates the impaired function. In the isolated aorta, contraction induced by angiotensin II was more potent in Zucker fatty rats (ZF) compared with that in Zucker lean rats. Both angiotensin II type 1 receptor expression and O(2)(-) production were upregulated in ZF. In addition, deficiency of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) contributes to the endothelial dysfunction in ZF. Oral administration of pitavastatin for 8 weeks normalized angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction and endothelial function in ZF. Pitavastatin treatment of ZF increased vascular BH4 content, which was associated with twofold increase in endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activity as well as a 60% reduction in endothelial O(2)(-) production. The treatment also markedly downregulated protein expression of angiotensin II type 1 receptor and gp91phox, whereas expression of guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I was upregulated. Pitavastatin restores vascular dysfunction by inhibiting NAD(P)H oxidase activity and uncoupled eNOS-dependent O(2)(-) production.",

    "128": "Apomine, a 1,1-bisphosphonate-ester with antitumor activity, has previously been reported to strongly down-regulate 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), the rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway responsible for the prenylation of proteins. Here, we show that although apomine down-regulated HMG-CoA reductase protein levels in myeloma cells, it did not inhibit protein prenylation, and apomine-induced apoptosis could not be prevented by mevalonate, indicating that apomine cytotoxicity is independent from its effects on HMG-CoA reductase. Instead, apomine cytotoxicity was prevented by the addition of phosphatidylcholine, which is similar to the previously reported ability of phosphatidylcholine to overcome the cytotoxicity of farnesol, whereas phosphatidylcholine had no effect on down-regulation of HMG-CoA reductase by apomine. These findings raised the possibility that apomine, independent from its own cytotoxic effects, could enhance the antitumor effects of the competitive HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin via down-regulating HMG-CoA reductase. Indeed, treatment with apomine in combination with lovastatin resulted in synergistic decreases in viable cell number and induction of apoptosis. At the concentrations used, apomine down-regulated HMG-CoA reductase protein levels without being cytotoxic. Accumulation of unprenylated Rap1A by lovastatin was enhanced in the presence of apomine. Furthermore, synergy was completely prevented by mevalonate, and apomine did not synergize with desoxolovastatin, which does not inhibit HMG-CoA reductase. We conclude that the synergistic drug interaction results from an enhancement by apomine of the effects of lovastatin, mediated by down-regulation of HMG-CoA reductase by apomine. Thus, these findings demonstrate a novel strategy for enhancing the antitumor effects of lovastatin.",

This study tested the hypothesis that total body fat oxidation (TBFO) is reduced by statins in patients with genetic deficiencies in FO, determined by white blood cells (FOwbc) and by molecular analysis of common deficiencies, and would cause intolerance in some patients. Six patients on statin therapy without myopathic side effects (tolerant) and 7 patients who had previously developed statin-induced myopathic symptoms (intolerant) (age = 58 +/- 8.25 yrs, ht. = 169 +/- 11 cm, and wt. = 75.4 +/- 14.2 kg) were tested for TBFO (Respiratory Exchange Ratio, RER) pre- and during exercise. FOwbc was not significantly different between tolerant and intolerant (0.261 +/- 0.078 vs. 0.296 +/- 0.042 nmol/h per 10(9) wbc), or normals (0.27 +/- 0.09 nmol/h per 10(9) wbc) and no common molecular abnormalities were found.

Post-exercise lactates were not different between groups. Although dietary fat intake was not different, blood lipoprotein levels, particularly triglycerides were 35% lower in tolerant than previously intolerant. TBFO and blood lipoproteins were reduced in tolerant patients in spite of the absence of genetic limitations, but not in the intolerant group as hypothesized. Although not conclusive, these data suggest the need for a prospective study of the effects of statins on fat oxidation.",

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that diabetes mellitus (DM) exerts adverse effects on the integrity of gap junctions (GJs) and induces cellular apoptosis in rat cardiomyocytes that can be abolished by simvastatin or losartan therapy. An experimental model of DM (induced by streptozocin 60 mg/kg body weight) in adult male rats (n = 24) was utilized to investigate the integrity of GJs containing connexin43 (Cx43) and the incidence of cellular apoptosis in the left ventricular myocardium. These rats were divided into 3 groups; group I (insulin therapy only), group II (insulin plus simvastatin 20 mg/kg/day), and group III (insulin plus losartan 20 mg/kg/day). Diabetic rats and 8 healthy rats (group IV) were sacrificed at 3 weeks following DM induction for immunofluorescence analysis. The experimental results demonstrated that the number of intact Cx43 GJs and the integrated area (mum(2)) constituted by clusters of Cx43 spots were significantly higher in groups II and IV than in group III, and in groups II-IV than in group I (all P values < 0.05). Additionally, the number of apoptotic bodies was remarkably higher in group I than in groups II-IV, and notably higher in groups II-III than in group IV (all P values < 0.05). Simvastatin is more effective than losartan at inhibiting the effects of DM on the integrity of myocardial ultrastructures. Both drugs effectively prevent cellular apoptosis in diabetic rat heart.",

A Markov model was developed to explore the costs and health outcomes associated with a lifetime of statin treatment using a UK NHS perspective.", 
    "145": "Thirty-one randomised studies were identified that compared a statin with placebo or with another statin, and reported clinical outcomes. Meta-analysis of the available data from the placebo-controlled studies indicates that, in patients with, or at risk of, CVD, statin therapy is associated with a reduced relative risk of all cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, CHD mortality and fatal myocardial infarction (MI), but not of fatal stroke. It is also associated with a reduced relative risk of morbidity [non-fatal stroke, non-fatal MI, transient ischaemic attack (TIA), unstable angina] and of coronary revascularisation. It is hardly possible, on the evidence available from the placebo-controlled trials, to differentiate between the clinical efficacy of atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin. However, there is some evidence from direct comparisons between statins to suggest that atorvastatin may be more effective than pravastatin in patients with symptomatic CHD. There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of statins in different subgroups. Statins are generally considered to be well tolerated and to have a good safety profile. This view is generally supported both by the evidence of the trials included in this review and by postmarketing surveillance data. Increases in creatine kinase and myopathy have been reported, but rhabdomyolysis and hepatotoxicity are rare. However, some patients may receive lipid-lowering therapy for as long as 50 years, and long-term safety over such a timespan remains unknown. In secondary prevention of CHD, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) increase with age varying between pound 10,000 and pound 17,000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) for ages 45 and 85 respectively. Sensitivity analyses show these results are robust. In primary prevention of CHD there is substantial variation in ICERs by age and risk. The average ICERs weighted by risk range from pound 20,000 to pound 27,500 for men and from pound 21,000 to pound 57,000 for women. The results are sensitive to the cost of statins, discount rates and the modelling time frame. In the CVD analyses, which take into account the benefits of statins on reductions in stroke and TIA events, the average ICER weighted by risk level remains below pound 20,000 at CHD risk levels down to 0.5%. Limitations of the analyses include the requirement to extrapolate well beyond the timeframe of the trial period, and to extrapolate effectiveness results from higher risk primary prevention populations to the treatment of populations at much lower risk. Consequently, the results for the lower age bands and lower risks are subject to greater uncertainty and need to be treated with caution.", 
    "146": "There is evidence to suggest that statin therapy is associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of primary and secondary cardiovascular events. As the confidence intervals for each outcome in each prevention category overlap, it is not possible to differentiate, in terms of relative risk, between the effectiveness of statins in primary and secondary prevention. However, the absolute risk of CHD death/non-fatal MI is higher, and the number needed to treat to avoid such an event is consequently lower, in secondary than in primary prevention. The generalisability of these results is limited by the exclusion, in some studies, of patients who were hypersensitive to, intolerant of, or known to be unresponsive to, statins, or who were not adequately compliant with study medication during a placebo run-in phase. Consequently, the treatment effect may be reduced when statins are used in an unselected population. The results of the economic modelling show that statin therapy in secondary prevention is likely to be considered cost-effective. In primary prevention, the cost-effectiveness ratios are dependent on the level of CHD risk and age, but the results for the CVD analyses offer support for the more aggressive treatment recommendation issued by recent guidelines in UK. Evidence on clinical endpoints for rosuvastatin is awaited from on-going trials. The potential targeting of statins at low-risk populations is however associated with major uncertainties, particularly the likely uptake and long-term compliance to lifelong medication by asymptomatic younger patients. The targeting, assessment and monitoring of low-risk patients in primary care would be a major resource implication for the NHS. These areas require further research.",

When added to cells, 24,25EC decreases cholesterol synthesis and up-regulates cholesterol efflux genes, including ABCA1. Synthesis of 24,25EC occurs in a shunt of the mevalonate pathway which also produces cholesterol. Therefore, 24,25EC synthesis should be subject to the same negative feedback regulation as cholesterol synthesis. To date, no role has been ascribed to 24,25EC in light of the fact that increased accumulation of cholesterol should decrease formation of this oxysterol through feedback inhibition. This leads to the intriguing paradox: why inhibit production of an apparently important regulator of cholesterol homeostasis when it is needed most?", 
    "148": "We used a combination of pharmacological and genetic approaches in Chinese Hamster Ovary cell-lines to investigate this paradox. Endogenous synthesis of 24,25EC was manipulated using partial inhibition of the enzyme, Oxidosqualene Cyclase. Changes in cholesterol and 24,25EC synthesis were determined using metabolic labelling with [1-14C]-acetate, thin-layer chromatography and phosphorimaging. Transcriptional effects mediated via SREBP and LXR were analysed by luciferase reporter assays.", 
    "149": "We showed that cholesterol addition to cells lead to a rapid and preferential inhibition of 24,25EC synthesis. Addition of 24,25EC resulted in parallel inhibition of 24,25EC and cholesterol synthesis. Furthermore, we used a variety of approaches to examine the relationship between cholesterol and 24,25EC synthesis, including cell-lines with different rates of cholesterol synthesis, varying cholesterol synthetic rates by pre-treatment with a statin, or lipoprotein cholesterol loading of macrophages. In all cases, we showed that 24,25EC synthesis faithfully tracked cholesterol synthesis. Moreover, changes in 24,25EC synthesis exerted downstream effects, reducing SREBP transcriptional activity whilst increasing ABCA1 and LXR transcriptional activity.", 
    "150": "Our results show that 24,25EC synthesis parallels cholesterol synthesis, consistent with this oxysterol functioning as a safety valve to protect against the accumulation of newly-synthesised cholesterol (as opposed to exogenously-derived cholesterol). Considering that 24,25EC is capable of being produced in all cholesterogenic cells, we propose that production of 24,25EC may represent a ubiquitous defence mechanism.", 
    "151": "The purpose of this research was to study whether the bioavailability of lovastatin could be improved by administering lovastatin solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) duodenally to rats. Lovastatin SLN were developed using triglycerides by hot homogenization followed by ultrasonication. Particle size and zeta potential were measured by photon correlation spectroscopy. The solid state of the drug in the SLN and lipid modification were characterized. Bioavailability studies were conducted in male Wistar rats after intraduodenal administration of lovastatin suspension and SLN. Stable lovastatin SLN having a mean size range of 60 to 119 nm and a zeta potential range of -16 to -21 mV were developed. More than 99% of the lovastatin was entrapped in the SLN. Lovastatin was dispersed in an amorphous state, and triglycerides were in beta(1) form in the SLN. In vitro stability studies showed the slow release and stability of lovastatin SLN. The relative bioavailabilities of lovastatin and lovastatin hydroxy acid of SLN were increased by ~173% and 324%, respectively, compared with the reference lovastatin suspension.", 
    "152": "The RADIANCE studies were designed to assess the effects of torcetrapib/atorvastatin (T/A) compared with atorvastatin alone on slowing atherosclerotic progression in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (RADIANCE 1) or mixed hyperlipidemia (RADIANCE 2), as measured by change in carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT).", 
    "153": "RADIANCE 1 and 2 were randomized, double-blind, controlled trials with a duration of 2 years. In both studies, eligible subjects began treatment with atorvastatin during a run-in period and were titrated to target LDL-C levels defined by NCEP ATP III guidelines. Subjects then proceeded to a double-blind randomized treatment period where they received one of two regimens: (i) fixed combination T/A (torcetrapib dose, 60 mg), or (ii) atorvastatin alone. In both regimens, the dose of atorvastatin was established during the run-in period (20-80 mg, RADIANCE 1; 10-80 mg RADIANCE 2). B-mode ultrasonography was performed in duplicate at baseline and at end of study, and every 6 months in between.",

    "156": "Combination of ezetimibe (EZE) with a statin represents an attractive strategy for cholesterol-lowering treatment, as it inhibits the two main sources of cholesterol: absorption from the intestine (inhibited by EZE) and endogenous biosynthesis (inhibited by statins).", 
    "157": "This multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled study randomised a total of 148 men and women with primary hypercholesterolaemia and coronary heart disease (CHD) to receive treatment for 6 weeks with either EZE 10 mg + atorvastatin 10 mg (EZE + ATV; n = 72) or placebo/atorvastatin 10 mg (ATV; n = 76). The primary efficacy variable was the mean percentage change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) from baseline to study endpoint.", 
    "158": "At 6 weeks, EZE + ATV provided a significantly greater adjusted mean change from baseline in LDL-C compared with ATV monotherapy (-50.5% vs. -36.5%; p < 0.0001), equating to an additional 14.1% reduction (95% CI -17.90, -10.19) in LDL-C. A significantly higher proportion of patients on EZE + ATV achieved the new Joint British Societies (JBS 2) recommended LDL-C goal of < 2 mmol/L (62% vs. 12% with ATV alone; p < 0.0001) and the JBS 2 minimum treatment standard of < 3 mmol/L (93% vs. 79% with ATV alone). Patients receiving EZE + ATV were 12 times more likely to reach LDL-C targets (odds ratio 12.1; 95% CI 5.8, 25.1; p < 0.0001) compared with patients receiving ATV monotherapy. Clinical chemistry profiles and the incidence of adverse events were similar in both groups.",

    "160": "Patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia and concomitant coronary heart disease (CHD) and/or diabetes mellitus (DM), who are at particularly high risk of cardiovascular events such as stroke or myocardial infarction, benefit from aggressive lipid lowering strategies. The present studies investigated the incremental efficacy and safety of dual cholesterol inhibition with ezetimibe/simvastatin in such high-risk patients pre-treated with statins but not reaching the 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) low density cholesterol (LDL-C) cholesterol threshold in the primary care setting.", 
    "161": "Two open-label, prospective, non-randomised, observational studies (study 1 with n = 19 194 patients, predominantly with CHD; study 2 with n = 19 484 patients, predominantly with DM). Patients received--almost all after statin pre-treatment--ezetimibe 10 mg plus simvastatin 10 mg (study 1: 15%, study 2: 16%), 20 mg (in 68% each), 40 mg (12%/10%) or 80 mg (1%/1%) as fixed dose combinations over 3 months (dosage at investigator's discretion).", 
    "162": "Mean LDL-C was reduced by 28%/27% (study 1/ study 2) compared with baseline values (on statin monotherapy). Mean total cholesterol was decreased by 22% in each study, mean triglycerides by 16/17%, and mean high density cholesterol (HDL-C) was increased by 9/10%. Adverse events were reported in 0.3% and 0.2% of patients, respectively.",

    "164": "Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia affects one every 400 individuals, is caused by mutations in the LDL receptor gene and is associated with premature coronary artery disease. Nowadays, LDL cholesterol can be efficiently reduced with the new therapies to reduce blood lipids. We report a female patient who consulted in 1975, when she was 46 years old, for severe hypercholesterolemia. In 2003, a sample of leukocyte DNA was obtained and the uncommon 1705+1G>A mutation of the LDL receptor gene was detected. No mutations in the apolipoprotein B gene were found. The patient was treated successfully with simvastatin 80 mg/day and ezetimibe 10 mg/day and LDL cholesterol levels were reduced below 200 mg/dl.",

    "167": "National prospective cohort study that enrolled 1041 incident dialysis patients at 81 US not-for-profit outpatient dialysis clinics from October 1995 to June 1998, with follow-up to January 2005. Statin use was determined by medical record review. Rates of sepsis events [corrected] between statin users and control patients were compared using multivariate regression models, with adjustment for potential confounders in the overall cohort and in a subcohort in which control patients were matched to statin users according to their likelihood (propensity) to have been prescribed a statin.", 
    "168": "Sepsis events [corrected] were determined through hospital records from the United States Renal Data System (mean follow-up, 3.4 years).", 
    "169": "There were 303 sepsis events [corrected] Rates of sepsis events [corrected] were significantly lower in patients receiving statins (crude incidence rate, 41/1000 patient-years) than in those not receiving statins (crude incidence rate, 110/1000 patient-years) (P<.001). With adjustment for demographics and dialysis modality, statin users were substantially less likely to be subsequently hospitalized for sepsis (incidence rate ratio, 0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25-0.68). Further adjustment for comorbidities and laboratory values continued to show this protective association (incidence rate ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.21-0.67). In the propensity-matched subcohort, statin use was even more protective (incidence rate ratio, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.11-0.49).", 
    "170": "Use of statins was strongly and independently associated with a reduction in the risk of sepsis events [corrected] in patients who had chronic kidney disease and were receiving dialysis. Randomized trials of statins in patients with chronic kidney disease should examine the prevention of sepsis as a potentially important benefit.", 
    "171": "The recent analysis of the French MONICA registries report a reduction in the incidence of fatal MI related to improvement of care whereas the overall incidence of coronary events remain stable, suggesting the need for a better primary prevention. The extensive review of the death certificates and the analysis of the death classification from the same registries indicate an under estimation of MI-related death in the national death registry. It is also confirmed that instead of 50%, approximately 80% of coronary death are explained by the four major risk factors including smoking, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and diabetes. The international REACH registry has enrolled more than 67 000 individuals including patients with symptomatic atherothrombotic disease and patients with multiple risk factors. The analysis of baseline characteristics and of the one year FU shows a high residual risk and a lack of efficacy of secondary prevention. The existence of a symptomatic disease and the number of symptomatic localization of atherothrombosis are critical factors to predict recurrence of major vascular events Secondary analysis of the INTERHEART study provide the essence of what should any physician know about the relationship between coronary heart disease and smoking, either active or passive. Prevention with respect to this risk factor remains very insufficient. Varenicline, a new nicotinic receptor partial agonist, should help patients involved in smoking cessation program. The established detrimental effects of perioperative smoking represent a unique opportunity to promote smoking cessation in individuals scheduled for surgery. The major cardiovascular impact of second hand smoking has been recently demonstrated by the short-term effects of banning smoking in public places on the incidence of acute coronary events. The SPARCL study has demonstrated the benefit of high dose of atorvastatine to prevent recurrent acute ischemic cerebrovascular event in patients with a prior history of stroke or TIA. In the open ASTEROID study, high doses of rosuvastatine confirm the possibility of reducing the volume of coronary atheroma analyzed by IVUS. The expected benefit of glitazones to reduce the incidence of death, MI and stroke in diabetes patients with a prior history of vascular event has been confirmed in the PROactive study. Pioglitazone provided a clear reduction of recurrent vascular events in diabetes patient with a prior MI at a cost of a significant increase of the risk of heart failure. In the DREAM study, neither ramipril nor rosiglitazone have reduced the incidence of cardiovascular events significantly. The moderate benefit of the fenofibrate to prevent cardiovascular events in the FIELD study, which was carried out in diabetics mostly in primary prevention, needs to be considered after adjustment on statin use in a higher proportion of patients of the placebo group. Postprandial hyperglycaemia, analyzed by the peak of glycaemia after a load in glucose, has been confirmed as a more powerful independent predictive factor of the risk of cardiovascular event than fasting glycaemia. The systematic screening postprandial hyperglycaemia represents an interesting strategy for primary prevention which warrants further investigation. If obesity is a risk factor whose impact on morbi-mortality is well established, a French study shows that body mass index has an unfavourable influence on the cognitive functions in middle-aged men and women.", 
    "172": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) remains an under-diagnosed affection, and the ankle-brachial index (ABI), a simple diagnostic method, is poorly known and seldom used, and the vascular patient's prescription list is frequently insufficient regarding results obtained in large trials with good methodology. The French ATTEST study underlines the fact that ABI is measured in less than 1 out of 3 patients with PAD. In ATTEST study, less than 10% have the triple therapy validated in PAD : antiplatelet drugs, statins and ACE-inhibitors. The international REACH registry included more than 60 000 patients suffering from atherosclerosis, including 8 000 cases with PAD. This survey evidences that in PAD patients, the annual cardiovascular complication rate is significantly higher than in patients with coronary artery disease (18 vs 13%); again PAD appears systematically under-treated when compared to CAD. These epidemiological surveys highlight the importance of screening of atherosclerotic lesions with the aim of setting an active prevention of CV complications. The new guidelines insist on the screening of PAD in patients at risk, as well as on the importance of the global management after initiating the triple therapy, independent of the CV risk factors. In a 5-year longitudinal study from an initial cohort of 2265 subjects, Aboyans et al. studied the progression of PAD by repeated measurements of ABI at the level of ankles and toes. Factors of progression for large-vessels PAD were active smoking, the total/HDL-cholesterol ratio, Lp(a) and CRP. Importantly, diabetes was not associated to the PAD progression in large vessels, but in contrast, it was the sole factor associated to the progression of PAD in small vessels. In an Austrian study published this year in the NEJM, Schillinger et al. compared balloon angioplasty versus the use of Nitinol stent for the treatment of long stenoses of the superficial femoral artery. In case of claudication, these lesions are usually treated medically, whereas surgery is required for more severe cases. The fact that stenting these long lesions of the superficial femoral artery provides benefits in terms of restenosis opens a approach for the endovascular therapy, to be confirmed by larger trials."
