First line treatment of mRCC includes drugs such as sunitinib, temsirolimus and pazopanib, with overall survival now reaching up to 43,6months in patients with favorable-risk metastatic disease. Several side-effects in mRCC treatment, such as hypothyroidism, can be used as positive prognostic factors and indicate good response to therapy. Hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia independent of hypothyroidism are reported as side-effects in temsirolimus treatment and recently in sunitinib treatment, but the exact mechanism and significance of the changes remains elusive. Most likely, metabolic changes are caused by inhibition of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), a positive target of tumor growth suppression, but also a regulator of iron homeostasis. There are no clinical studies reporting changes in iron and ferritin levels during mRCC biotherapy, but we hypothesize that inhibition of mTOR will also affect iron and ferritin levels. If both lipid and iron changes correlate, there is a high possibility that both changes are primarily caused by mTOR inhibition and the level of change should correlate with the inhibition of mTOR pathway and hence the efficacy of targeted treatment. We lastly hypothesize that mRCC biotherapy causes hypercholesterolemia with a possibly improved cholesterol profile due to increase HDL/LDL ratio, so statins might not have a role as supplementary treatment, whereas a sharp rise in triglyceride levels seems to be the primary target for additional therapy.",

The 2-[3H]-DG uptake of each group was determined and the mRNA and protein expression levels of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4), insulin receptor substrate (IRs), and RhoA were assessed. RESULTS After treatment with different concentrations of statins and insulin, the 2-[3H]-DG uptake showed a significant negative correlation with the concentration of atorvastatin (P<0.05), and no significant correlation with pravastatin and rosuvastatin. The mRNA and protein expression levels of GLUT4 and IRs-1 in primary cultured cardiomyocytes were both significantly reduced by atorvastatin treatment (P<0.05). Pravastatin and rosuvastatin showed no significant effects on GLUT4 and IRs-1 expression. The mRNA and protein expression levels of RhoA both showed no significant difference when treated with the 3 statins.

In healthy subjects and hypercholesterolemic patients, reverse cholesterol transport pathways were induced similarly to that in animal models. However, increased plasma and hepatic TG, plasma LDL-C, apoB, apoE, and CETP and decreased circulating neutrophils were also evident. Furthermore, similar increases in LDL-C were observed in normocholesterolemic subjects and statin-treated patients. The primate model markedly underestimated human lipogenic responses and did not predict human neutrophil effects. These studies demonstrate both beneficial and adverse LXR agonist clinical responses and emphasize the importance of further translational research in this area.",

    "112": "We identified 26 men with FH and CAD, participating in the St Thomas' Atherosclerosis Regression Study, who had been randomized to receive a fat-modified diet plus cholestyramine (8\u00a0g twice daily) (DC, n\u00a0= 12) or usual care (UC, n\u00a0=\u00a014), and investigated the relative effects of these treatments on the angiographic progression of coronary atherosclerosis over 39 months. FH was defined as probable/definite according to Dutch Lipid Clinic Network criteria; mean FH score was 8.7 (range 6-15) and mean baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-Ch) concentration was 5.4 (SD 1.4) mmol/L. Coronary atherosclerosis was assessed by serial quantitative angiography as the global changes in mean and minimum absolute width of segments (MAWS and MinAWS, respectively).", 
    "113": "Mean plasma LDL-Ch concentration fell by 35% with DC and remained significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) lower during the trial at 3.78 (SD 0.98)\u00a0mmol/L compared with UC at 4.89 (1.04). MAWS decreased by 0.252 (SEM 0.072) mm in the UC group and by 0.001 (0.065) mm in the DC group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007), with corresponding reductions in MinAWS of 0.290 (0.087) mm and 0.013 (0.058) mm (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009); these changes were significant after adjusting for baseline variables, including coronary luminal dimensions and lipoprotein(a). Progression was observed in 7 patients (50%) on UC and 3 (25%) on DC (p\u00a0=\u00a00.19), with regression in no patients (0%) and 3 patients (25%) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), respectively.",

After adjustment, antiplatelet therapy was more often prescribed after CAS than CEA (odds ratio 2.4 [95% confidence interval 1.68-3.45]), but statin prescription was equally likely (odds ratio 1.11 [95% confidence interval 0.84-1.49]). Operator specialty (medical>radiology/surgery) and hospital community setting (suburban>urban>rural) independently predicted antiplatelet and statin agent use at discharge, whereas hospital geographic location (Northeast>Midwest/South>West) predicted use of statins but not antiplatelet therapy at discharge.", 
    "118": "US antiplatelet agent and statin discharge prescription rates were suboptimal after both CAS and CEA and varied by revascularization modality, operating physician specialty, and hospital characteristics.

    "119": "Atorvastatin is considered to be one of the most commonly used of all statins anti-hyperlipidemic drugs despite the fact that there is much controversy about its safety. Its therapeutic use becomes severely limited by the hazards of inducing myotoxicity. Curcumin is one of the safe spices that have chemoprotection and cytoprotection effects against endogenous and exogenous noxious stimuli. This study investigates the effect of curcumin on atorvastatin sub-chronic use-induced myotoxicity in rats by the assessment of serum creatinine phosphokinase, lactic acid dehydrogenase, myoglobin, troponin, potassium, creatinine, and histopathological changes of skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscles by light and electron microscope examination. Eighty adult albino rats were divided into four groups; each group consists of 20 rats. The control group received water, the second group received atorvastatin, the third group received curcumin, and the fourth group received curcumin with atorvastatin for 90 days by gastric gavage. The prolonged use of atorvastatin induced significant abnormalities of all myotoxicity biomarkers associated with histopathological and ultrastructural changes in the different types of the muscles. Co-administration of curcumin with sub-chronic use of atorvastatin led to an improvement in myotoxicity manifestations.",

Our aim was to estimate the prevalence and likelihood of statin use among selected statin benefit groups. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2012, we examined 5319 adults age \u226520\u2009years. We estimated weighted frequencies and prevalence of statin use for adults with diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia (or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol \u226570\u2009mg/dL), defined as statin benefit group 1 (SBG1); and for adults with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, defined as statin benefit group 2 (SBG2). We constructed a logistic regression model to estimate odds of statin use in SBG1. Overall, an estimated 38.6 million Americans are on a statin. In adjusted models, uninsured and Hispanic adults were less likely to be on a statin compared with white adults; 59.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 53.0-66.1) of all adults in SBG1, 58.8% (95% CI: 51.5-66.1) of adults age 40 to 75 in SBG1, and 63.5% (95% CI: 55.6-71.4) of all adults in SBG2 were on a statin. Although the prevalence of statin use has increased over time, Hispanic ethnicity and lack of insurance remain barriers to statin use. Black-white racial disparities were not significant. Our study provides a baseline estimate of statin use in the noninstitutionalized population just prior to introduction of the new guidelines and provides a reference for evaluating the impact of the new guidelines on statin utilization.",

Patients from these two groups were matched for baseline characteristics. Atorvastatin did not significantly affect the serum level of LDL-C or CRP in either the standard or intensive group. Furthermore, ET-1 did not significantly change following treatment with atorvastatin in the standard group. However, intensive treatment with atorvastatin significantly reduced ET-1 serum level (0.65\u00b10.38pmol/L vs. 0.49\u00b10.21pmol/L, P<0.05) and achieved a greater reduction of MA-ADP (49.2\u00b112.1 vs. 38.4\u00b117.4mm, P<0.05).

Statins, which inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis, have both pleiotropic and Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL)-lowering properties. Atorvastatin is one of the choices for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and management of hypercholesterolaemia. However, there is a paucity of data regarding the changes in the DNA damage in patients with coronary atherosclerosis after statin use.",

Differences in risk of hepatotoxicity, new onset diabetes and rhabdomyolysis specifically between the high-intensity statins and the most common moderate-intensity statin, simvastatin, were not found to a significant degree in this review. Rather, baseline characteristics and drug-drug interactions (DDIs) appear to be more important regarding the risk of these adverse effects. Pharmacogenetic differences in statin metabolism may explain individual susceptibility, however genetic testing is not felt to be cost effective at this time. More importantly, statin choice should consider concomitant use of the many prevalent CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers, and when present, rosuvastatin selection is recommended to reduce DDIs and risk of statin-induced adverse effects.", 
    "135": "Tuberculosis is still a cause of major concern, partly due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains. New drugs are therefore needed. Vancomycin can target mycobacteria with cell envelope deficiency. In this study, we used a vancomycin susceptibility assay to detect drugs hampering lipid synthesis in Mycobacterium bovis BCG and in Mycobacterium tuberculosis We tested three drugs already used to treat human obesity: tetrahydrolipstatin (THL), simvastatin, and fenofibrate. Only vancomycin and THL were able to synergize on M. bovis BCG and on M. tuberculosis, although mycobacteria could also be inhibited by simvastatin alone. Lipid analysis allowed us to identify several lipid modifications in M. tuberculosis H37Rv treated with those drugs. THL treatment mainly reduced the phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM) content in the mycobacterial cell wall, providing an explanation for the synergy, since PDIM deficiency has been related to vancomycin susceptibility. Proteomic analysis suggested that bacteria treated with THL, in contrast to bacteria treated with simvastatin, tried to recover, inducing, among other reactions, lipid synthesis. The combination of THL and vancomycin should be considered a promising solution in developing new strategies to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.",

Multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, was used to examine the association between annual AMI volume and adherence to each measure. Similar modeling was used to evaluate the relationship between AMI volume and in-hospital mortality. Compared with high-volume hospitals, lower-volume hospitals were less likely to be academically affiliated, or to have cardiac surgery capabilities, electronic health records, or dedicated tobacco treatment services. Higher-volume hospitals had greater adherence to each performance measure, except aspirin use at arrival and reperfusion therapy. The greatest difference was in the rates of referral to cardiac rehabilitation (59%, 76%, and 83% in low-, middle-, and high-volume hospitals, respectively).

The potential for net benefit from added therapy can inform nonstatin decision-making. Considering patient risk and the LDL-C level on statin, the additional potential cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction benefit from further lowering LDL-C depends on the magnitude of LDL-C lowering from the nonstatin. Ezetimibe is the only nonstatin shown to reduce atherosclerotic CVD events added to a statin, albeit modestly, since it modestly reduces LDL-C by about 20%. Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin-Like/Kexin Type 9 mononclonal antibodies lower LDL-Cby 45-65%, but definitive CVD outcomes and safety trials are pending. Niacin and fenofibrate do not clearly reduce CVD events in statin-treated patients, and may increase adverse events. Bile acid sequestrants have not been evaluated in CVD outcome trials in statin-treated patients, and have an excess of adverse effects. Cost also plays a role in access to nonstatin therapy. These considerations may inform shared decision-making.",

The pharmacological options to achieve this goal shall be as specific and personalized as the reasons for and co-factors of hyperlipidaemia. It was the goal of this study to reveal the impact of leoligin on cholesterol levels and to define its mechanism of action. Oral application of leoligin in ApoE-/- mice led to significantly reduced total serum cholesterol levels and a reduction in postprandial blood glucose peak levels. In the absence of biochemical signs of toxicity, leoligin treatment resulted in reduced weight gain in mice. The effects of leoligin on serum cholesterol levels may be due to a direct inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) by a unique, non-statin-like binding mode. Postprandial serum glucose peaks may be reduced by a mild peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-\u03b3) agonistic activity of leoligin. No effect on atherosclerotic plaque size was observed. As a non-toxic, cholesterol-, peak glucose-, and weight gain-lowering compound, leoligin continues to fulfil characteristics of a potential agent for the treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The counterregulatory overexpression of hepatic HMGCR in leoligin treated animals possibly explains the missing permanent anti-atherosclerotic effect.", 
    "169": "Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a genetic, independent and likely causal risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS). Lp(a) levels are primarily genetically determined and tend to fluctuate only mildly around a pre-determined level. In primary care settings, one Lp(a) measurement can reclassify up to 40% of patients in intermediate risk score categories. In secondary care settings, recent data from the JUPITER and AIM-HIGH trials demonstrate that elevated Lp(a) remains part of the \"residual risk\" despite achievement of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels <70 mg/dL. Recent reports suggest that statins can increase Lp(a) levels, potentially further contributing to this residual risk. Current therapies to lower Lp(a) are limited to niacin, mipomersen and proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin-type 9 inhibitors, but these drugs are limited by weak efficacy and not specifically approved for Lp(a) lowering. Emerging therapies to lower Lp(a) may shed new light into the potential clinical benefit of lowering Lp(a) in CVD and CAVS.", 
    "170": "Statin intolerance is a commonly encountered clinical problem for which useful management strategies exist. Although many patients report statin-related muscle symptoms, studies indicate that the majority of these patients can tolerate a statin upon re-challenge. Alternative statin dosing strategies are an effective way to modify and reintroduce statin therapy for patients reporting adverse symptoms. Correction of vitamin D deficiency and hypothyroidism may improve statin tolerability in some patients. CoQ10 supplementation has been found to be of no benefit for statin-related muscle symptoms in most recent clinical trials. PCSK9 inhibitors are a new therapeutic option that if confirmed as safe and effective by outcomes trials may be of substantial benefit to select patients at high ASCVD risk who are unable to achieve adequate low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering on maximally tolerated statin therapy. Other available medications to lower LDL-C in statin intolerant patients include ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, niacin, and fibrates.",

    "175": "Hypercholesterolemia is a major concern in the USA, with studies identifying children as young as 2years old with early-stage atherosclerosis. Genetics play a major role in the dyslipidemia of children, but other factors, such as diet and lack of physical activity, confound the problem. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic condition that causes lifelong elevations in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The heterozygous form of the disease affects around 1 in 200 people, and the homozygous form of the disease affects around 1 in 160,000-300,000 people. Early identification and appropriate management of patients with FH are essential to reduce cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Consequently, US dyslipidemia guidelines recommend routine screening of all children aged 9-11years, and that LDL-C levels should be <110mg/dL in children and adolescents. The primary management strategy in all children with dyslipidemia is diet and lifestyle; a healthy diet (including fruits, vegetables, fish, and whole grains) and increased physical activity should be encouraged. Most patients with FH will also require pharmacotherapy to reduce LDL-C levels to \u2264130mg/dL. Statins are recommended as first-line therapy due to their proven efficacy in reducing LDL-C and improving other lipid parameters in children. They have also been shown to have a positive effect on atherosclerosis. Safety is of particular concern with children; however, studies have so far shown that the side-effect profile of statins in children is similar to that in adults. Despite improvements in disease management, FH remains underdiagnosed and undertreated, highlighting the need for greater awareness and understanding.",

With the widespread prescription and use of statins to decrease morbidity from myocardial infarction and stroke, it was noted that approximately 5% of all statin users experienced muscle pain and weakness during treatment. In a smaller proportion of patients, the myopathy progressed to severe morbidity marked by proximal weakness and severe muscle wasting. Remarkably, Mammen and colleagues were the first to discover that the molecular target of statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), is an autoantibody target in patients that develop an immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM). These observations have been confirmed in a number of studies but, until today, a multi-center, international study of IMNM, related idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM), other auto-inflammatory conditions and controls has not been published. Accordingly, an international, multi-center study investigated the utility of anti-HMGCR antibodies in the diagnosis of statin-associated IMNM in comparison to different forms of IIM and controls. This study included samples from patients with different forms of IIM (n=1250) and patients with other diseases (n=656) that were collected from twelve sites and tested for anti-HMGCR antibodies by ELISA. This study confirmed that anti-HMGCR autoantibodies, when found in conjunction with statin use, characterize a subset of IIM who are older and have necrosis on muscle biopsy.

The lack of a difference in visual acuity was not explained by lens or retina status, which remained unchanged during and after the treatment period for both groups.Preliminary analyses of 42 participants who had completed 12 months' follow-up in the larger trial did not show a statistically significant difference between simvastatin and the placebo groups for visual acuity, drusen score, or visual function (effect estimates and confidence intervals were not available). Complete data for these outcomes at three years' follow-up were not reported. At three years, low-quality evidence showed an effect of simvastatin in slowing progression of AMD compared with placebo to be uncertain (odds ratio 0.51, 95% confidence interval 0.23 to 1.09).One trial did not report adverse outcomes.

Previous studies have demonstrated that neurons in the CA1 area of hippocampus are particularly sensitive to ischemic damage. Atorvastatin (ATV) has been reported to attenuate cognitive deficits after stroke, but precise mechanism for neuroprotection remains unknown. Therefore, the aims of this study were to investigate the neuroprotective mechanisms of ATV against ischemic brain injury induced by cerebral ischemia reperfusion. In this study, four-vessel occlusion model was established in rats with cerebral ischemia. Rats were divided into five groups: sham group, I/R group, I/R+ATV group, I/R+ATV+LY, and I/R+SP600125 group. Cresyl violet staining was carried out to examine the neuronal death of hippocampal CA1 region. Immunoblotting was used to detect the expression of the related proteins. Results showed that ATV significantly protected hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons against cerebral I/R. ATV could increase the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt1) and nNOS, diminished the phosphorylation of JNK3 and c-Jun, and further inhibited the activation of caspase-3. Whereas, all of the aforementioned effects of ATV were reversed by LY294002 (an inhibitor of Akt1). Furthermore, pretreatment with SP600125 (an inhibitor of JNK) diminished the phosphorylation of JNK3 and c-Jun, and further inhibited the activation of caspase-3 after cerebral I/R. Taken together, our results implied that Akt-mediated phosphorylation of nNOS is involved in the neuroprotection of ATV against ischemic brain injury via suppressing JNK3 signaling pathway that provide a new experimental foundation for stroke therapy.",

Recent guidelines recommend increasing inclusion criteria for statin treatment in diabetic individuals; however, the impact of statins on skeletal muscle health in those with diabetes (who already suffer from impairments in muscle health) is ill defined. Here, we investigate the effects of fluvastatin treatment on muscle health in wild type (WT) and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. WT and STZ-diabetic mice received diet enriched with 600\u2009mg/kg fluvastatin or control chow for 24\u2009days. Muscle morphology, intra and extracellular lipid levels, and lipid transporter content were investigated. Our findings indicate that short-term fluvastatin administration induced a myopathy that was not exacerbated by the presence of STZ-induced diabetes. Fluvastatin significantly increased ectopic lipid deposition within the muscle of STZ-diabetic animals, findings that were not seen with diabetes or statin treatment alone. Consistent with this observation, only fluvastatin-treated diabetic mice downregulated protein expression of lipid transporters FAT/CD36 and FABPpm in their skeletal muscle. No differences in FAT/CD36 or FABPpm mRNA content were observed. Altered lipid compartmentalization resultant of a downregulation in lipid transporter content in STZ-induced diabetic skeletal muscle was apparent in the current investigation. Given the association between ectopic lipid deposition in skeletal muscle and the development of insulin-resistance, our findings highlight the necessity for more thorough investigations into the impact of statins in humans with diabetes.",

Further, women have suboptimal use of evidence-based guideline therapies compared with men with and without obstructive CAD. Anti-anginal and anti-atherosclerotic strategies are effective for symptom and ischemia management in women with evidence of ischemia and nonobstructive CAD, although more female-specific study is needed. IHD guidelines are not \"cardiac catheterization\" based but related to evidence of \"myocardial ischemia and angina\". A simplified approach to IHD management with ABCs (aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin-renin blockers, beta blockers, cholesterol management and statin) should be used and can help to increases adherence to guidelines.", 
    "285": "Statins may have immunomodulatory effects that benefit critically ill patients. Therefore, we retrospectively examined the association between survival and the prescription of statins prior to admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), or high dependency unit (HDU), as a result of major elective surgery or as an emergency with a presumed diagnosis of sepsis.", 
    "286": "We retrospectively studied critical care patients (ICU or HDU) from a tertiary referral UK teaching hospital. Nottingham University Hospitals have more than 2200 beds, of which 39 are critical care beds. Over a 5-year period (2000-2005), 414 patients were identified with a presumed diagnosis of sepsis, and 672 patients were identified who had planned ICU/HDU admissions following elective major surgery. Patients prescribed statins prior to hospital admission were compared with those who were not. Demographics, medical history, drug history, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores were examined. Univariate and multivariate analyses were applied using the primary end point of survival at 5 years after admission.", 
    "287": "Patients prescribed statins prior to critical care admission were, on average, older and had higher initial Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores and more preexisting comorbidities. Statins were almost invariably stopped following admission to critical care. Statin use was not associated with significantly altered survival during hospital admission, or at 5 years, for either patients with sepsis (9% vs 15%, P=.121; 73% vs 84%, P=.503, respectively) or postoperative patients (55% vs 58%, P=.762; 57% vs 63%, P=.390).", 
    "288": "Prior statin use was not associated with improved outcomes in patients admitted to critical care after elective surgical cases or with a presumed diagnosis of sepsis.", 
    "289": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains one of the commonest sources of morbidity and mortality in the world. Lipids and especially low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) contribute to the risk of CVD events. Statins are the primary therapy for hypercholesterolaemia and recent evidence supports the use of ezetimibe as a second-line agent. Pro-protein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) is a regulator of LDL receptor expression. Activating mutations in PCSK9 give rise to a form of familial hypercholesterolaemia, while inactivating mutations lead to lower LDL-C levels and fewer CVD events. Therapies to inhibit PCSK9 are in development and two antibody-based therapies - alirocumab and evolocumab - have recently been licensed. This article reviews the actions of PCSK9, the novel therapeutics targeted on this molecule and how they are likely to be used in clinical practice until large scale CVD outcome studies with PCSK9 inhibitors are published.", 
    "290": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death for women. Given the overall prevalence of CVD and its risk factors in women, primary prevention is an important focus. In 2013, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association released guidelines for men and women on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk (ASCVD) in adults based on randomized-controlled trials. Fixed and appropriate intensity of a statin based on calculation of an individual's risk of ASCVD or in diabetics or those with severely elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol patients for primary prevention is recommended rather than cholesterol level goals. A more recent consensus statement regarding the role of non-statin therapies has been released, but like the prior guidelines released in 2013, there were no sex-specific recommendations. An evidence-based approach to ASCVD prevention should be used in women.", 
    "291": "Venous leg ulcers (VLUs) are common but challenging health problems. Better understanding of the risk factors involved in delayed healing of VLUs may therefore guide individualized treatment plans to improve patient outcomes.", 
    "292": "We sought to identify the risk factors associated with delayed healing of VLUs in patients seen at a tertiary academic wound care clinic.", 
    "293": "A retrospective analysis of 554 patients who presented to the Toronto Regional Wound Healing Clinic for VLUs in a 3-year period was performed. Patient and ulcer characteristics were recorded. Multivariate analyses were performed to compare patients with ulcer resolution and those whose ulcers did not resolve after 12-month follow-up.", 
    "294": "The average age of the patients was 67.3 \u00b1 0.7 years, with 56\u00a0% being female. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (54\u00a0%), dyslipidemia (33\u00a0%), a history of smoking (30\u00a0%), and diabetes (26\u00a0%). Ulcer resolution was associated with a smaller ulcer size (odds ratio [OR] 0.984 [95\u00a0% confidence interval (CI) 0.973, 0.996]), shorter ulcer duration (OR 0.704 [95\u00a0%\u00a0CI 0.574, 0.865]), and dyslipidemia (OR 1.848 [95\u00a0%\u00a0CI 1.052, 3.246]).", 
    "295": "Pro-healing factors associated with VLUs were a smaller ulcer size and a shorter ulcer duration. Dyslipidemia was also associated with improved healing, potentially owing to the use of statins. Patients presenting with poorer-prognosis VLUs should receive more aggressive treatment with earlier referral to vascular surgery.", 
    "296": "To model acute rectal toxicity in Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) for prostate cancer using dosimetry and patient specific characteristics.", 
    "297": "A database of 79 prostate cancer patients treated with image guided IMRT was used to fit parameters of Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) and logistic regression Normal Tissue Complications Probability (NTCP) models to acute grade \u2265 2 rectal toxicities. We used a univariate regression model to find the dosimetric index which was most correlated with toxicity and a multivariate logistic regression model with machine learning algorithm to integrate dosimetry with patient specific characteristics. We used Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) to quantify the predictive power of models.", 
    "298": "Sixteen patients (20.3%) developed acute grade\u22652 rectal toxicity. Our best estimate (95% confidence interval) of LKB model parameters for acute rectal toxicity are exponent n=0.13 (0.1-0.16), slope m=0.09 (0.08-0.11), and threshold dose TD50=56.8 (53.7-59.9) Gy. The best dosimetric indices in the univariate logistic regression NTCP model were D25% and V50Gy. The best AUC of dosimetry only modeling was 0.67 (0.54, 0.8). In the multivariate logistic regression two patient specific variables were particularly strongly correlated with acute rectal toxicity, the use of statin drugs and PSA level prior to IMRT, while two additional variables, age and diabetes were weakly correlated. The AUC of the logistic regression NTCP model improved to 0.88 (0.8, 0.96) when patient specific characteristics were included. In a group of 79 patients, 40 took Statins and 39 did not. Among patients who took statins, (4/40)=10% developed acute grade \u22652 rectal toxicity, compared to (12/39)=30.8% who did not take statins (p=0.03). The average and standard deviation of PSA distribution for patients with acute rectal toxicity was PSAtox = 5.77 \u00b1 2.27 and it was PSAnotox = 9.5 \u00b1 7.8 for the remainder (p=0.01).", 
    "299": "Patient specific characteristics strongly influence the likelihood of acute grade \u2265 2 rectal toxicity in radiation therapy for prostate cancer."
