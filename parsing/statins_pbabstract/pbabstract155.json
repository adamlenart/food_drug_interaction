The present report describes a 16-year-old girl who presented with yellow to red-brown papules and nodules on her eyelids, cheeks, axillae, back and buttocks. Indirect laryngoscopy showed multiple xanthomatous plaques on the larynx, posterior pharynx, epiglottis, and vocal cords. Additional findings were polyuria, polydipsia, and amenorrhea. Skin biopsy and electron microscopy results confirmed the diagnosis of XD. The patient was treated with fenofibrate, simvastatin, desmopressin, and sex-hormone replacement therapy. Her skin lesions began to slowly fade 6 years after disease onset, eventually resolving spontaneously and completely, but leaving an atrophic scar, frank anetoderma, and persisting diabetes insipidus. This case report together with a review of the English-language literature on the long-term follow-up of XD patients provides additional information on the natural history of this disease.",

    "2": "Male rats were fed with or without pravastatin (0.1 mg\u00b7kg\u207b\u00b9\u00b7day\u207b\u00b9) for 7 days, and thereafter subjected to 10 min of ischemia by coronary artery ligation followed by 20 min reperfusion. Treatment with pravastatin reduced the frequency and duration of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation (VT/VF) and improved the arrhythmia score after reperfusion. To investigate the rapid effects of pravastatin, isolated perfused rat hearts were subjected to 20 min of global ischemia followed by 30 or 60 min of reperfusion. Treatment with pravastatin (10 nmol/L) from 10 min before ischemia shortened the total duration of reperfusion-induced VT/VF. Interestingly, pravastatin administered from the beginning of reperfusion also exerted antiarrhythmic effects. These results indicate that pravastatin exerts antiarrhythmic effects not only with daily oral intake but also when administered just before ischemia or even after ischemia. Intracellular calcium ([Ca\u00b2\u207a](i)) overload and collapse of mitochondrial inner membrane potential (\u0394\u03c8(m)) are associated with the arrhythmogenesis during ischemia-reperfusion. In cultured cardiomyocytes, pretreatment with pravastatin (10 nmol/L) suppressed [Ca\u00b2\u207a](i) overload and prevented \u0394\u03c8(m) loss induced by H\u2082O\u2082.", 
    "3": "Pravastatin attenuated reperfusion-induced lethal ventricular arrhythmias. Inhibition of [Ca\u00b2\u207a](i) overload and preserving \u0394\u03c8(m) may be the mechanisms of the observed antiarrhythmic effects of pravastatin.", 
    "4": "We aimed to assess associations between dietary intake of fats (saturated and monounsaturated fats and cholesterol) and certain food groups (butter, margarine, and nuts) with the prevalence, incidence, and progression of age-related hearing loss. We also aimed to investigate the link between serum lipids and cholesterol-lowering medication (statins) and hearing loss. The Blue Mountains Hearing Study is a population-based survey of age-related hearing loss. Hearing loss was measured in 2956 participants (aged \u226550 y) and was defined as the pure-tone average (PTA) of frequencies 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 kHz > 25 dB hearing level (PTA(0.5-4 kHz)). Dietary data were collected using a semiquantitative FFQ. After multivariable adjustment, the likelihood of prevalent hearing loss increased from the lowest (reference) to the highest quartile of dietary cholesterol intake (P-trend = 0.04). Among persons self-reporting statin use (n = 274), a 48% reduced odds of prevalent hearing loss was observed after multivariable adjustment [OR = 0.52 (95% CI = 0.29-0.93)]. Participants in the second and 3rd quartiles of dietary monounsaturated fat intake compared with those in the first quartile (reference) had a significantly reduced risk of hearing loss progression 5 y later [multivariable-adjusted OR = 0.39 (95% CI = 0.21-0.71)] and [OR = 0.51 (95% CI = 0.29-0.91)], respectively. Our results suggest that a diet high in cholesterol could have adverse influences on hearing, whereas treatment with statins and consumption of monounsaturated fats may have a beneficial influence.", 
    "5": "The scavenger receptor SR-PSOX/CXCL16, which is identical to the chemokine CXCL16, is thought to be involved in atherogenesis. However, the presence and function of SR-PSOX/CXCL16 in the endothelium of atherosclerotic arteries has not been substantiated.", 
    "6": "In rabbit aorta immunocytochemistry revealed SR-PSOX/CXCL16 primarily in the endothelium at sites predisposed to lesion formation, in the endothelium of early atherosclerotic lesions, and mainly in intimal macrophages of more developed lesions, indicating that SR-PSOX/CXCL16-expression shifts during atherogenesis. In addition to its function as scavenger receptor and chemokine, SR-PSOX mediated the adhesion of THP-1 monocytes to endothelial cells in vitro. Both THP-1 monocytes and endothelial cells express SR-PSOX/CXCL16, and THP-1 monocytes express CXCR6, the specific receptor for SR-PSOX/CXCL16. Anti-SR-PSOX/CXCL16 and anti-CXCR6 antibody block monocyte adhesion, showing that SR-PSOX/CXCL16-CXCR6 interaction mediates monocyte-endothelial cell adhesion. SR-PSOX/CXCL16 expression of endothelial cells is upregulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, and is reversed by incubation with ciglitazone and lovastatin.", 
    "7": "We suggest that SR-PSOX/CXCL16 may promote the adhesion of monocytes to the endothelium during early atherogenesis and that accumulating cytokines enhance SR-PSOX/CXCL16-mediated adhesion by upregulating SR-PSOX/CXCL16 expression. Manipulation of SR-PSOX/CXCL16 expression with anti-inflammatory agents may be of therapeutic value.", 
    "8": "According to current guidelines from the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III), the target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level for patients with established coronary heart disease (CHD) or CHD risk equivalents is less than 100 mg/dL, with an optional target of less than 70 mg/dL. More recent data suggest, however, that the physiologically normal level of LDL-C and the level at which atherogenesis is initiated is much lower. Overall, the data convincingly demonstrate that LDL-C lowering is associated with a significant reduction in CHD events, regardless of preexisting CHD. The NCEP ATP III treatment guidelines, published in 2002 and updated in 2004, do not reflect more recent findings on intensive lipid-lowering therapy, which are likely be addressed in the NCEP ATP IV guidelines, scheduled to be released in 2011. Drug options for LDL-C lowering include statins (the drug of choice), bile acid sequestrants, nicotinic acid, fibrates, and selective cholesterol absorption inhibitors.", 
    "9": "The role of hypercholesterolemia as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease has been well-documented. Hypercholesterolemia is the most prevalent modifiable risk factor in Poland. Despite the fact that the benefits of cholesterol lowering have been known for a long time, the therapeutic goals recommended by guidelines are still often not attained in clinical practice. Only 3% of Poles with hypercholesterolemia achieve recommended cholesterol levels, and the rate of reaching recommended goals among patients receiving lipid-lowering drugs is low, approximately 30%. Control of hypercholesterolemia is not satisfactory also in patients with ischemic heart disease. The introduction of new statins, use of higher statin doses, and the evidence pointing to the effectiveness of combination therapy have provided us with effective tools whose broad application in everyday practice may lead to a significant improvement in the control of hypercholesterolemia in Poland.", 
    "10": "The aim of this study was to determine the effects of atorvastatin in patients of South Asian versus European origin who participated in the Achieve Cholesterol Targets Fast with Atorvastatin Stratified Titration (ACTFAST) study. ACTFAST was a 12-week prospective, open-label study in patients at high risk for atherosclerosis (European origin, n = 1978; South Asian origin, n = 64). Compared with patients of European origin, patients of South Asian origin were younger, were less likely to smoke, and had lower body mass index, systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides. Because significant differences were observed in baseline characteristics between patient groups, case control propensity scores were used. In the unmatched analysis, South Asians had greater LDL-C response to atorvastatin than patients of European origin. However, after propensity matching, atorvastatin lowered LDL-C and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) to a similar degree in both groups, with no differences in safety profile. The authors observed no correlation between change in hs-CRP and LDL-C concentrations in either population. In conclusion, atorvastatin lowered both LDL-C and hs-CRP to a similar degree in patients of South Asian or European origin, suggesting usual starting doses of atorvastatin (with appropriate monitoring), rather than lower starting doses as has been advocated by some, may be used in patients of South Asian origin.",

    "12": "A total of 626 LMS patients, recruited at our hospital between January 1998 and March 2008, were classified them into the statin therapy group (Group A, n = 322) or the non-statin therapy group (Group B, n = 304) according to whether or not taking statins pre-operatively. Then their clinical data were retrospectively analyzed.",

Preoperative statin therapy could lower the all-cause mortality rate (1.90% vs 6.91%, P = 0.002), the prevalence of new atrial fibrillation or flutter (14.69% vs 19.61%, P = 0.016, \u03c7 \u00b2= 5.780) and disabling stroke (2.50% vs 4.58%, P = 0.047, \u03c7(2) = 3.94). Among 599 CABG survivors, 565 cases (94.3%) were actually followed up with a mean duration of 55.5 \u00b1 26.1 months (range: 2 - 98). During the follow-up period, there were 29 (4.63%) cardiac events, including 12 deaths and 17 myocardial infarctions. There were 43 (7.18%) cases with relapsing angina pectoris. The univariate analysis showed that emergency procedure, abnormal C-reactive protein (CRP), abnormal troponin I(TnI), complicated LMS pathology, preoperative IABP (intra-aortic balloon pump) support, preoperative cardiac arrest, preoperative history of myocardium infarction and no preoperative statin therapy were the risk factors for perioperative death while complicated LMS pathology, preoperative IABP support, preoperative cardiac arrest, preoperative myocardium infarction and no preoperative statin therapy were the risk factor for late cardiac events. The multivariate binary logistic regression showed that emergency procedure, preoperative IABP support, no preoperative statin therapy and preoperative IABP support were independent predictors for peri-operative death. And preoperative IABP support, preoperative cardiac arrest, no preoperative statin therapy and complicated LMS pathology were independent predictors for late cardiac events. There was no statistical significance in inhospital mortality between on pump CABG and OPCAB (off pump coronary artery bypass).",

    "16": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension was induced by a single subcutaneous injection of monocrotaline (50 mg/kg) in rats. In the prevention protocol, 32 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 8 each): low-dose rosuvastatin prevention group (2 mg\u00d7kg(-1)\u00d7d(-1)), high-dose rosuvastatin prevention group (10 mg\u00d7kg(-1)\u00d7d(-1)), pulmonary arterial hypertension group, normal control group. Beginning on the MCT injection day, rats were treated with rosuvastatin by daily gavage for 4 weeks. Normal control group and pulmonary arterial hypertension group received vehicle by gavage. In the treatment protocol, 52 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 13 each): low-dose rosuvastatin treatment group (2 mg\u00d7kg(-1)\u00d7d(-1)), high-dose rosuvastatin treatment group (10 mg\u00d7kg(-1)\u00d7d(-1)), pulmonary arterial hypertension group, normal control group. Four weeks after MCT injection, rats were treated with rosuvastatin by daily gavage for 4 weeks. Normal control group and pulmonary arterial hypertension group received vehicle by gavage. At the end of study, survival rates, mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP), wall thickness of small pulmonary artery and right ventricular hypertrophy among groups were compared. The expression levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and endothelial nitricoxide synthase (eNOS) protein in small pulmonary artery, the expression levels of Rho kinase 1(ROCK-1) and eNOS mRNA in lung tissue were also detected.", 
    "17": "All rats in the prevention protocol survived. Rosuvastatin treatment improved survival in the treatment protocol (58%, 75% vs.30%, P < 0.05). Rosuvastatin therapy in both preventive or treatment protocols significantly lowered mPAP [prevention protocol: (27.53 \u00b1 3.43), (25.72 \u00b1 1.76) vs. (36.05 \u00b1 2.45) mm Hg (1 mm Hg = 0.133 kPa), P < 0.01; treatment protocol: (30.39 \u00b1 3.17), (27.59 \u00b1 1.99) vs. (40.68 \u00b1 1.39) mm Hg, P < 0.01], reduced thickening of small pulmonary artery wall (P < 0.01) and right ventricular hypertrophy (P < 0.01).

    "19": "Randomised controlled trials have shown an excellent preventive effect of statins on ischemic heart disease. Our objective was to investigate if a relation can be detected between acute myocardial infarction- (AMI) mortality or incidence and statin utilisation, for men and women in different age-groups on a population basis.", 
    "20": "The utilisation rate of statins increased almost three times for both men and women between 1998 and 2002. During 1998-2000 the incidence of AMI decreased clearly for men but only slightly for women. Mortality decreased from 1998 to 2002. The change in statin utilisation from 1998 to 2000 showed no correlation to the change in AMI mortality from 2000 to 2002. Statin utilisation and AMI- incidence or mortality showed no correlations when adjusting for socio-economic deprivation, antidiabetic drugs and geographic coordinates.",

    "22": "In drug development, Caco-2 cells are often employed to study the influence of membrane transporters on drug permeability. The aim of the current study was to characterize permeability and kinetic parameters of selected organic anionic compounds in Caco-2 cells, and to investigate whether the Caco-2 cell line may be used as an overall model to predict interactions on multiple membrane transporters in the intestine. Taurocholic acid (TCA) and estrone-3-sulfate (E(1) S) were used as model substrates. Possible inhibitors studied were TCA, E(1) S, taurolithocholic acid, fluvastatin, and glipizide. The effects of these compounds on initial uptake, apparent permeability, and intracellular end-point accumulations of the probe substrates were studied. Both interactions on apical and basolateral influx transporters were observed. These interactions were proposed to be mediated mainly by the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter and the organic solute transporter \u03b1/\u03b2, and to less extent by the organic anion transporting polypeptide 2B1. However, interactions on efflux transporters were not detected, although they were expected from the literature on the investigated compounds. Biosimulation methods may be the key to further distinguish between interactions on multiple transporters, including the involvement of efflux transporters, by taking into account the changes in dynamics that drug interactions may cause.", 
    "23": "Statins cause structural changes in myocytes and provoke myotoxicity, myopathy, and myalgias. Thus, patients taking statins may be especially susceptible to succinylcholine-induced muscle injury. The authors tested the hypothesis that succinylcholine increases plasma concentrations of myoglobin, potassium, and creatine kinase more in patients who take statins than in those who do not and that succinylcholine-induced postoperative muscle pain is aggravated in statin users.", 
    "24": "Patients who took statins for at least 3 months and those who had never used statins were enrolled. General anesthesia was induced and included 1.5 mg/kg succinylcholine for intubation. The incidence and degree of fasciculation after succinylcholine administration were recorded. Blood samples were obtained before induction and 5 and 20 min and 24 h after succinylcholine administration. Patients were interviewed 2 and 24 h after surgery to determine the degree of myalgia.", 
    "25": "The authors enrolled 38 patients who used statins and 32 who did not. At 20 min, myoglobin was higher in statin users versus nonusers (ratio of medians 1.34 [95% CI: 1.1, 1.7], P = 0.018). Fasciculations in statin users were more intense than in nonusers (P = 0.047). However, plasma potassium and creatine kinase concentrations were similar in statin users and nonusers, as was muscle pain.", 
    "26": "The plasma myoglobin concentration at 20 min was significantly greater in statin users than nonusers, although the difference seems unlikely to be clinically important. The study results suggest that the effect of succinylcholine given to patients taking statins is likely to be small and probably of limited clinical consequence.",

After multivariable risk adjustment, the odds ratios for statin and aspirin use in the CCTA-positive group at 18 months were 3.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-8.3) and 4.2 (95% CI, 1.8-9.6), respectively. At 90 days, in the total CCTA group vs controls, there were more secondary tests (55 [5%] vs 22 [2%]; P < .001) and revascularizations (13 [1%] vs 1 [0.1%]; P < .001). One cardiovascular event occurred in each group over 18 months.", 
    "30": "An abnormal screening CCTA result was predictive of increased aspirin and statin use at 90 days and 18 months, although medication use lessened over time.

At the end of atherosclerosis induction, animals underwent a baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and were randomized to receive LXR-623 (1.5, 5, or 15 mg/kg/day), simvastatin (5 mg/kg/day), or placebo. The combination of LXR-1.5/simvastatin was also tested. After a final MRI, animals were euthanized and their aortas processed for further analysis. Simvastatin significantly reduced lesion progression (-25%; P< 0.01) in comparison with the placebo group. A similar effect was observed in the LXR-1.5 and -5 groups. A significant regression (16.5%; P< 0.01) of existing atherosclerosis was observed in the LXR-1.5/simvastatin group. Histological and molecular analysis showed plaque stabilization in the animals treated with the LXR-1.5 and -5, and LXR-1.5/simvastatin. The effects of LXR-623 were observed in the presence of a non-significant effect on total-cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins-cholesterol, and triglyceride levels.",

Statins also prevented PAR-AP-mediated extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 activation, which is crucial for TF induction. The redistribution of PAR1 is accompanied by the relocation of the membrane microdomain-associated G-protein \u03b1, caveolin-1, and Src, which we previously showed to play a key role in signal transduction and TF induction. Conversely, cholesterol loading potently amplified PAR1-AP-induced TF, probably as a result of the increased abundance of PAR1 and the Src and G-protein \u03b1 signaling molecules in the caveolin-1-enriched fraction, without affecting PAR1 mRNA.",

    "47": "The cholesterol biosynthetic pathway produces not only sterols but also non-sterol mevalonate metabolites involved in isoprenoid synthesis. Mevalonate metabolites affect transcriptional and post-transcriptional events that in turn affect various biological processes including energy metabolism. In the present study, we examine whether mevalonate metabolites activate PPAR\u03b3 (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3), a ligand-dependent transcription factor playing a central role in adipocyte differentiation. In the luciferase reporter assay using both GAL4 chimaera and full-length PPAR\u03b3 systems, a mevalonate metabolite, FPP (farnesyl pyrophosphate), which is the precursor of almost all isoprenoids and is positioned at branch points leading to the synthesis of other longer-chain isoprenoids, activated PPAR\u03b3 in a dose-dependent manner. FPP induced the in vitro binding of a co-activator, SRC-1 (steroid receptor co-activator-1), to GST (glutathione transferase)-PPAR\u03b3. Direct binding of FPP to PPAR\u03b3 was also indicated by docking simulation studies. Moreover, the addition of FPP up-regulated the mRNA expression levels of PPAR\u03b3 target genes during adipocyte differentiation induction. In the presence of lovastatin, an HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA) reductase inhibitor, both intracellular FPP levels and PPAR\u03b3-target gene expressions were decreased. In contrast, the increase in intracellular FPP level after the addition of zaragozic acid, a squalene synthase inhibitor, induced PPAR\u03b3-target gene expression. The addition of FPP and zaragozic acid promotes lipid accumulation during adipocyte differentiation. These findings indicated that FPP might function as an endogenous PPAR\u03b3 agonist and regulate gene expression in adipocytes.",

Hydroxyl-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors or statins interfere with the production of mevalonic acid, which is a precursor in the synthesis of coenzyme Q10. The statin medications routinely result in lower coenzyme Q10 levels in the serum. Some studies have also shown reduction of coenzyme Q10 in muscle tissue. Such coenzyme Q10 deficiency may be one mechanism for statin-induced myopathies. However, coenzyme Q10 supplements have not been shown to routinely improve muscle function. Additional research in this area is warranted and discussed in this review.",

This report examines the available evidence regarding the role, significance, and mechanisms of DHF. Epidemiologic studies have documented the rising burden of DHF, and experimental data are revealing the unique mechanisms distinguishing it from systolic heart failure. Despite controversies on the definition of DHF, or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, standardized clinical criteria with supplementary imaging and structural data have identified DHF as a distinct pathophysiological entity. The mechanisms underlying DHF include abnormal matrix dynamics, altered myocyte cytoskeleton, and impaired active relaxation. The commonly held belief that survival of patients with DHF is better than that of patients with systolic heart failure has been challenged by updated data. The heterogeneous etiologies or risk factors for the condition include aging, diabetes, hypertension, and ischemia, making a common diagnostic or treatment pathway difficult. Novel therapeutic targets that address the pathophysiology of this disease are under consideration, although there are no proven therapies for DHF to date. Exacerbating factors include volume and sodium indiscretion, arrhythmias, ischemia, and comorbidities. Strategies to ameliorate or to obviate these precipitating factors are most effective in preventing DHF and its exacerbations. Meanwhile, prevention of DHF through appropriate and aggressive risk factor identification and management must remain the cornerstone of clinical intervention.", 
    "62": "Cardiovascular disease is the biggest killer globally and the principal contributing factor to the pathology is atherosclerosis; a chronic, inflammatory disorder characterized by lipid and cholesterol accumulation and the development of fibrotic plaques within the walls of large and medium arteries. Macrophages are fundamental to the immune response directed to the site of inflammation and their normal, protective function is harnessed, detrimentally, in atherosclerosis. Macrophages contribute to plaque development by internalizing native and modified lipoproteins to convert them into cholesterol-rich foam cells. Foam cells not only help to bridge the innate and adaptive immune response to atherosclerosis but also accumulate to create fatty streaks, which help shape the architecture of advanced plaques. Foam cell formation involves the disruption of normal macrophage cholesterol metabolism, which is governed by a homeostatic mechanism that controls the uptake, intracellular metabolism, and efflux of cholesterol. It has emerged over the last 20 years that an array of cytokines, including interferon-\u03b3, transforming growth factor-\u03b21, interleukin-1\u03b2, and interleukin-10, are able to manipulate these processes. Foam cell targeting, anti-inflammatory therapies, such as agonists of nuclear receptors and statins, are known to regulate the actions of pro- and anti-atherogenic cytokines indirectly of their primary pharmacological function. A clear understanding of macrophage foam cell biology will hopefully enable novel foam cell targeting therapies to be developed for use in the clinical intervention of atherosclerosis.",

Both LDL-C and non-HDL-C were closely correlated with levels of Apo B at baseline, and these correlations improved after treatment. When using the fitted simple linear regression equations, we found that the on-treatment LDL-C and non-HDL-C levels corresponding to an Apo B of 90, 80, and 70 mg/dL were lower than proposed LDL-C and non-HDL-C treatment targets.

The study population included 440 subjects at moderately high/high risk of coronary heart disease with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels higher than the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III recommendations (<100 mg/dl for moderately high/high-risk subjects without atherosclerotic vascular disease or <70 mg/dl for high-risk subjects with atherosclerotic vascular disease). Pooled data demonstrated that ezetimibe added to stable rosuvastatin 5 mg or 10 mg reduced LDL cholesterol by 21%. In contrast, doubling rosuvastatin to 10 mg or 20 mg reduced LDL cholesterol by 5.7% (between-group difference of 15.2%, p <0.001). Individually, ezetimibe plus rosuvastatin 5 mg reduced LDL cholesterol more than did rosuvastatin 10 mg (12.3% difference, p <0.001), and ezetimibe plus rosuvastatin 10 mg reduced LDL cholesterol more than did rosuvastatin 20 mg (17.5% difference, p <0.001). Compared to rosuvastatin up-titration, ezetimibe add-on achieved significantly greater attainment of LDL cholesterol levels of <70 or <100 mg/dl (59.4% vs 30.9%, p <0.001), and <70 mg/dl in all subjects (43.8% vs 17.5%, p <0.001); produced significantly greater reductions in total cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B (p <0.001); and resulted in similar effects on other lipid parameters. Adverse experiences were generally comparable among the groups. In conclusion, compared to up-titration doubling of the rosuvastatin dose, ezetimibe 10 mg added to stable rosuvastatin 5 mg or 10 mg produced greater improvements in many lipid parameters and achieved greater attainment of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III recommended LDL cholesterol targets in subjects with elevated LDL cholesterol and at moderately high/high coronary heart disease risk.",

Mucoadhesive microparticles were formulated using eudragit S100 and ethyl cellulose as mucoadhesive polymers. End-step modification of w/o/o double emulsion solvent diffusion method was attempted to improve the purity of the product, that can affect the dose calculations of sustained release formulations and hence bioavailability. Microparticles formed were discrete, free flowing, and exhibited good mucoadhesive properties. DSC and DRS showed stable character of drug in microparticles and absence of drug polymer interaction. The drug to polymer ratio and surfactant concentration had significant effect on mean particle size, drug release, and entrapment efficiency. Microparticles made with drug: eudragit S100 ratio of 1:3 (F6) exhibited maximum entrapment efficiency of 72.7% and ex vivo mucoadhesion time of 4.15 h. In vitro permeation studies on goat intestinal mucosa demonstrated a flux rate (1,243 \u03bcg/cm(2)/h) that was 169 times higher than the flux of pure drug. The gastric instability problem was overcome by formulating the optimized microparticles as enteric-coated capsules that provided a sustained delivery of the highly water-soluble drug for 12 h beyond the gastric region. The release mechanism was identified as fickian diffusion (n = 0.4137) for the optimized formulation F6. Conclusively, a drug delivery system was successfully developed that showed delayed and sustained release up to 12 h and could be potentially useful to overcome poor bioavailability problems associated with pravastatin sodium.",

However, few reports describe the effect of statins on CVD occurrence in relation to long-term BP control. In the present analysis, we investigated the effects of baseline BP and follow-up BP control on the occurrence of CVD in patients enrolled in the MEGA Study. We investigated whether BP values provide more accurate prediction of the occurrence of CVD, including cerebrovascular disease/transischemic attack (CVA/TIA), and the effect of pravastatin on CVA/TIA. The risk for CVA/TIA and other CVD increased significantly (P\u22640.001) as the severity of hypertension increased. In contrast, pravastatin reduced the onset of CVA/TIA, regardless of the BP controlled. The mean BP was a more accurate predictor of CVD than a one-time BP value. In patients with mild-to-moderate dyslipidaemia, elevated BP increases the risk for CVA/TIA and other CVD, and rigorous BP control was important for preventing CVD, in particular CVA/TIA. The 12-month mean BP is useful to avoid attenuation to determine the association between CVD and BP. Pravastatin prevented CVA/TIA, regardless of BP controlled.",

Using unique panel data of physicians, combined with patient pharmacy prescription records, the authors developed a physician level generalized linear regression model. The generalized estimating equations method was used to account for within physician serial correlations and estimate physician population averaged effects.

The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of a simvastatin-releasing, biodegradable, nano- to microscale fiber scaffold (SRBFS) for bone tissue engineering with BMSCs. Simvastatin was released from SRBFS slowly. BMSCs were observed to spread actively and rigidly adhere to SRBFS. BMSCs on SRBFS showed an increase in alkaline phosphatase activity 2 weeks after cell culture. Furthermore, osteoclastogenesis was suppressed by SRBFS in vitro. The new bone formation and mineralization in the SRBFS group were significantly better than in the biodegradable fiber scaffold (BFS) without simvastatin 12 weeks after implantation of the cell-scaffold construct into an ectopic site on the murine back. These results suggest that SRBFS promoted osteoblastic differentiation of BMSCs in vitro and in vivo, and demonstrate feasibility as a bone engineering scaffold.",

Bona fide risk factors for DILI are also not well established, but ongoing multicenter registry studies such as the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network are attempting to identify the role of genetic, environmental, and immunological factors in DILI pathogenesis and outcomes. Acute hepatocellular injury (~50%) is more common than mixed or cholestatic liver injury but jaundiced DILI subjects with either type of liver injury have a ~10% risk of short-term mortality. Antibiotics are the most commonly implicated agents associated with DILI, but there are emerging reports of liver injury associated with the use of a multitude of herbal and dietary supplements. Despite their widespread use, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors or statins are an uncommon cause of idiosyncratic DILI. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that statins are actually safe and efficacious to use in hyperlipidemic patients with chronic liver disease. Acetaminophen hepatotoxicity remains a leading cause of severe acute liver injury. Limiting the amount of acetaminophen in prescription narcotic products may help reduce the incidence of future non-intentional overdoses but educating patients and providers of the multitude of over the counter products that contain acetaminophen is also recommended.",

Statins inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), the first step of the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway, leading to the depletion of the isoprenoids farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). The effects of statins on bone have previously been attributed to the depletion of GGPP, because the addition of exogenous GGPP prevented statin-stimulated osteoblast differentiation in vitro. However, in a recent report, we demonstrated that the specific depletion of GGPP did not stimulate but, in fact, inhibited osteoblast differentiation. This led us to hypothesize that isoprenoids upstream of GGPP play a role in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation. We demonstrate here that the expression of HMGCR and FPP synthase decreased during primary calvarial osteoblast differentiation, correlating with decreased FPP and GGPP levels during differentiation. Zaragozic acid (ZGA) inhibits the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway enzyme squalene synthase, leading to an accumulation of the squalene synthase substrate FPP. ZGA treatment of calvarial osteoblasts led to a significant increase in intracellular FPP and resulted in inhibition of osteoblast differentiation as measured by osteoblastic gene expression, alkaline phosphatase activity, and matrix mineralization. Simultaneous HMGCR inhibition prevented the accumulation of FPP and restored osteoblast differentiation. In contrast, specifically inhibiting GGPPS to lower the ZGA-induced increase in GGPP did not restore osteoblast differentiation. The specificity of HMGCR inhibition to restore osteoblast differentiation of ZGA-treated cultures through the reduction in isoprenoid accumulation was confirmed with the addition of exogenous mevalonate. Similar to ZGA treatment, exogenous FPP inhibited the mineralization of primary calvarial osteoblasts. Interestingly, the effects of FPP accumulation on osteoblasts were found to be independent of protein farnesylation. Our findings are the first to demonstrate that the accumulation of FPP impairs osteoblast differentiation and suggests that the depletion of this isoprenoid may be necessary for normal and statin-induced bone formation.", 
    "105": "The beneficial effects of atorvastatin are based on both cholesterol-dependent and independent mechanisms. The latter probably include the ability of the estatin to enhance the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and to cause a vasodilatation. In turn, the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions of melatonin are related to its vascular protection. In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of the combination of melatonin plus atorvastatin against endothelial cell damage induced by inflammation and oxidative stress injury. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultured with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence or absence of melatonin and/or atorvastatin. LPS inhibited eNOS mRNA and protein expression, which was reversed by atorvastatin and, to a lesser extent, by melatonin. Together, melatonin + atorvastatin induced higher eNOS protein expression than either compound alone. Melatonin, but not atorvastatin, reduced free radical generation, lipid peroxidation, and interleukin-6 levels induced by LPS. In the presence of atorvastatin, the effects of melatonin were maintained or even improved. These data suggest that melatonin improves the beneficial effects of atorvastatin and reduces its side effects in endothelial cells during inflammation and under conditions of oxidative stress.",

However, no studies have as yet addressed whether or not statins regulate the expression of CRP in human lung epithelial cells (A549). In this study, we determined whether atorvastatin modulates the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of CRP in A549 cells. A549 cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing LPS in the absence or presence of various concentrations of atorvastatin. After incubation, the medium was collected and the amount of CRP was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The cells were harvested and CRP messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) was analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Incubation with LPS induced a significant time- and dose-dependent increase in CRP mRNA expression and CRP production in A549 cells, whereas atorvastatin significantly decreased LPS-induced CRP mRNA expression and CRP production in a dose-dependent manner. The present study revealed that A549 cells are capable of LPS-induced CRP expression, and that atorvastatin down-regulates the LPS-induced expression of CRP in cultured A549 cells. Our results suggest that statins ameliorate lung inflammation by regulating CRP production in human lung epithelial cells.",

Early diagnosis is becoming increasingly possible. This article reviews several adjunctive measures that might be instituted at or soon after admission in patients who are hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia that is found to be due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. Available data favor the use of a macrolide together with a \u03b2-lactam antibiotic for treatment, based largely on immunomodulatory activity of macrolides. Two large subgroup analyses from a single major study suggest that activated protein C (eg, drotrecogin) should be considered for patients with severe sepsis, organ failure, and an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score > 25 due to pneumococcal pneumonia. Statins exert an anti-inflammatory effect and several retrospective studies suggest that their use might ameliorate the adverse effects of pneumonia. Because inflammation elsewhere in the body is associated with inflammation in coronary arteries and because pneumococcal pneumonia has been shown to precipitate myocardial infarction, statins might be of further benefit by decreasing the likelihood of associated myocardial infarction. Aspirin, which inhibits platelet aggregation in inflamed coronary arteries, might also be considered for initial therapy. One reason that the association between myocardial infarction and pneumonia was not previously recognized is that aspirin was widely used in the past when people had acute febrile conditions. The literature on the benefits of corticosteroids in pneumonia is not convincing, and a particularly well-done, very recent study shows no benefit with corticosteroid use in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia, and perhaps even a worse outcome. No clinical data favor the use of platelet-activating factor antagonists.",

In this review, we examine the current evidence about treatment of HF-PEF, with particular emphasis on reviewing the literature for large-scale randomized clinical studies. The lack of significant benefit with neurohormonal antagonism in HF-PEF suggests that this condition might not involve neurohormonal activation as a critical pathophysiologic mechanism. Perhaps heart failure as we traditionally think of it is the wrong paradigm to pursue as we try to understand this condition of volume overload known as HF-PEF.",

The IC(50) of lovastatin was 3.53 \u03bcM and that of paclitaxel was 5.98 nM. In BHT-101 cells, cellular viability was also inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by lovastatin and paclitaxel (p = 0.020 and p = 0.032, respectively). The IC(50) of lovastatin was 17.13 \u03bcM and that of paclitaxel was 35.26 nM. In 8505C cells, paclitaxel and lovastatin alone induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. However, both an isobologram analysis on inhibition of viability and an analysis of apoptosis demonstrated antagonism between paclitaxel and lovastatin. In BHT-101 cells, however, neither drug had an apoptotic effect when used individually. There was a variable effect when used in combination, depending on the drug concentrations.", 
    "167": "Paclitaxel and lovastatin were cytotoxic in two ATC cell lines and increased apoptosis in 8505C cells. However, in these cells, the combination of drugs resulted in antagonism that affected both the cytotoxicity of the compounds and the apoptosis of 8505C cells. The combination of paclitaxel and lovastatin did not enhance the treatment effect in ATC cell lines.", 
    "168": "Dyslipidemia is a common, major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Screening for lipid disorders is simple, and available treatments decrease disease risk. However, secondary causes of dyslipidemia are probably underappreciated, and severe lipid elevations should be referred to a lipid specialist. Patients usually respond to lifestyle modifications and drug therapy guided by a stepwise approach supported by the results of clinical trials, but several misconceptions may interfere with treatment strategies.", 
    "169": "A randomized, placebo-controlled trial in diabetic patients receiving hemodialysis showed no effect of atorvastatin on a composite cardiovascular endpoint, but analysis of the component cardiac endpoints suggested that atorvastatin may significantly reduce risk. Because the AURORA (A Study to Evaluate the Use of Rosuvastatin in Subjects on Regular Hemodialysis: An Assessment of Survival and Cardiovascular Events) trial included patients with and without diabetes, we conducted a post hoc analysis to determine whether rosuvastatin might reduce the risk of cardiac events in diabetic patients receiving hemodialysis. Among the 731 participants with diabetes, traditional risk factors such as LDL-C, smoking, and BP did not associate with cardiac events (cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction). At baseline, only age and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were independent risk factors for cardiac events. Assignment to rosuvastatin associated with a nonsignificant 16.2% reduction in risk for the AURORA trial's composite primary endpoint of cardiac death, nonfatal MI, or fatal or nonfatal stroke (HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.07). There was no difference in overall stroke, but the rosuvastatin group had more hemorrhagic strokes than the placebo group (12 versus two strokes, respectively; HR, 5.21; 95% CI 1.17 to 23.27). Rosuvastatin treatment significantly reduced the rates of cardiac events by 32% among patients with diabetes (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.51 to 0.90). In conclusion, among hemodialysis patients with diabetes mellitus, rosuvastatin might reduce the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiac events.", 
    "170": "To determine the calcium score and coronary plaque burden in asymptomatic statin-treated patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) compared with a control group of patients with low probability of coronary artery disease, having non-anginal chest pain, using CT.", 
    "171": "101 asymptomatic patients with FH (mean age 53 \u00b1 7 years; 62 men) and 126 patients with non-anginal chest pain (mean age 56 \u00b1 7 years; 80 men) underwent CT calcium scoring and CT coronary angiography. All patients with FH were treated with statins during a period of 10 \u00b1 8 years before CT. The coronary calcium score and plaque burden were determined and compared between the two patient groups.", 
    "172": "The median total calcium score was significantly higher in patients with FH (Agatston score = 87, IQR 5-367) than in patients with non-anginal chest pain (Agatston score = 7, IQR 0-125; p < 0.001). The overall coronary plaque burden was significantly higher in patients with FH (p < 0.01). Male patients with FH, whose low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were reduced by statins below 3.0 mmol/l, had significantly less coronary calcium (p < 0.01) and plaque burden (p = 0.02).", 
    "173": "The coronary plaque burden is high in asymptomatic middle-aged patients with FH despite intense statin treatment.", 
    "174": "Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins constitute non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol. These are atherogenic lipoproteins and non-HDL cholesterol is a secondary target of treatment beyond LDL cholesterol in patients with hypertriglyceridemia. Some investigators favor total apolipoprotein B over non-HDL cholesterol as the secondary target of treatment. This is based on publications suggesting that total apolipoprotein B is more predictive of cardiovascular events than non-HDL cholesterol. Several methods are available for estimating total apolipoprotein B. This study compared total apolipoprotein estimated by immunonephelometric assay (INA), vertical auto profile (VAP), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and non-HDL cholesterol levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia from the previously reported Simvastatin plus Fenofibrate for Combined Hyperlipidemia (SAFARI) trial. Total apolipoprotein B levels were found to be highest by INA, intermediate by NMR and non-HDL cholesterol, and lowest by VAP. Concordance for non-HDL cholesterol levels among the INA, VAP, and NMR methods was better than that for total apolipoprotein B levels; the correlation between non-HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B by INA was strongest (0.929). In patients with a low triglyceride/HDL cholesterol ratio (<3.5), total apolipoprotein B determined by INA was higher than that estimated from non-HDL cholesterol levels, whereas in patients with a high triglyceride/HDL C ratio (\u22653.5), apolipoprotein B predicted using non-HDL cholesterol was in better agreement with INA-determined apolipoprotein B levels. Similar trends were observed with VAP using equations specific for LDL particle size. In conclusion, more work is needed to improve agreement of apolipoprotein B measurements among methods employed clinically. Non-HDL cholesterol is also useful to predict total apolipoprotein B and some improvement may be attained by taking into account the ratio of triglyceride/HDL cholesterol as a measurement of LDL particle size.", 
    "175": "Recent trials have failed to show that statin therapy halts the progression of calcific aortic stenosis (AS). We hypothesized that statin therapy in younger patients with congenital AS would be more beneficial, because the valve is less calcified. In the present double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 63 patients with congenital AS (age 18 to 45 years) were randomly assigned to receive either 10 mg of rosuvastatin daily (n = 30) or matched placebo (n = 33). The primary end point was the progression of peak aortic valve velocity. The secondary end points were temporal changes in the left ventricular mass, ascending aortic diameter, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). The median follow-up was 2.4 years (interquartile range 1.9 to 3.0). The mean increase in peak velocity was 0.05 \u00b1 0.21 m/s annually in the rosuvastatin group and 0.09 \u00b1 0.24 m/s annually in the placebo group (p = 0.435). The annualized change in the ascending aorta diameter (0.4 \u00b1 1.7 mm with rosuvastatin vs 0.5 \u00b1 1.6 mm with placebo; p = 0.826) and left ventricular mass (1.1 \u00b1 15.8 g with rosuvastatin vs -3.7 \u00b1 30.9 g with placebo; p = 0.476) were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Within the statin group, the NT-proBNP level was 50 pg/ml (range 19 to 98) at baseline and 21 pg/ml (interquartile range 12 to 65) at follow-up (p = 0.638). NT-proBNP increased from 40 pg/ml (interquartile range 20 to 92) to 56 pg/ml (range 26 to 130) within the placebo group (p = 0.008). In conclusion, lipid-lowering therapy with rosuvastatin 10 mg did not reduce the progression of congenital AS in asymptomatic young adult patients. Interestingly, statins halted the increase in NT-proBNP, suggesting a potential positive effect of statins on cardiac function in young patients with congenital AS.", 
    "176": "The impact of statins on glucose metabolism and adipokines remains controversial. We compared the effects of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin on glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity (IS), adiponectin and leptin levels as well as systemic inflammation in non-diabetic patients with dyslipidaemia.", 
    "177": "Thirty-six patients were randomly assigned to 10 mg/day of rosuvastatin (n = 18) or 20 mg/day of atorvastatin (n = 18) for 12 weeks. Total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), non-HDL-C, triglycerides (TG), fasting plasma glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), quantitative IS check index (QUICKI), adiponectin, leptin and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were measured at baseline and after 4 and 12 weeks.", 
    "178": "Both statins significantly lowered TC, LDL-C, non-HDL-C and TG compared with baseline. Only rosuvastatin caused a significant reduction in insulin and HOMA-IR levels (-35%, p = 0.005 and -33%, p = 0.011 respectively) and a significant increase in QUICKI (+11%, p = 0.003) at 12 weeks. In terms of adipokines and hsCRP, no difference was observed after 4 and 12 weeks of treatment with either statin.",

    "180": "Green Chemistry or Sustainable Chemistry is defined by the Environmental Protection Agency as \"the design of chemical products that reduce or eliminate the use of hazardous substances\" In recent years there is a greater societal expectation that chemists and chemical engineers should produce greener and more sustainable chemical processes and it is likely that this trend will continue to grow over the next few decades. This tutorial review gives information on solvents and solvent selection, basic environmental metrics collection and three industrial case histories. All three case histories involve enzymatic chemistry. Pregabalin (Lyrica\u00ae) is produced using a lipase based resolution and is extremely unusual in that all four manufacturing steps to make pregabalin are performed in water. Sitagliptin (Januvia\u00ae) uses a transaminase in the final chemical step. Finally a rosuvastatin (Crestor\u00ae) intermediate is produced using a deoxy ribose aldolase (DERA) enzyme in which two carbon-carbon bonds and two chiral centres are formed in the same process step.", 
    "181": "C-reactive protein (CRP) has been shown to function as an inflammatory factor to induce endothelial dysfunction and hypertension in rats. The anti-inflammatory effects of statins suggest that they may attenuate CRP-induced endothelial dysfunction and hypertension in Sprague-Dawley rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with an adeno-associated virus (AAV) to induce overexpression of human CRP (AAV-hCRP) or green fluorescent protein (GFP) control (AAV-GFP). At 2 months after injection, rats were administered rosuvastatin by daily oral gavage (10 mg kg(-1)) for 2 additional months. Rosuvastatin administration attenuated the increased blood pressure and loss of vascular endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression in AAV-hCRP-treated rats, and N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester blocked its hypotensive effect. Rosuvastatin also activated phosphoinositide 3-kinases/Akt, and inhibited Rho kinase activity in aorta. Rosuvastatin reduced the production of reactive oxygen species through downregulation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase subunits, p22 phox and gp91 phox, and upregulation of superoxide dismutase 1 expression. Rosuvastatin attenuated the increase in blood pressure in AAV-hCRP-treated rats through endothelial protection and antioxidant effects. Our data reveals a novel mechanism through which statins may lower blood pressure.", 
    "182": "Treatment guidelines identify low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) as the primary target of therapy with secondary targets of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (apoB). Data were pooled from 27 randomised, double-blind, active or placebo-controlled trials in 21,794 adult hypercholesterolaemic patients (LDL-C 1.81-6.48 mmol/L) receiving ezetimibe/statin or statin for 4-24 weeks. Percentages of patients achieving various targets were calculated among diabetes (n = 6541) and non-diabetes (n = 15,253) subgroups. Significantly more patients with and without diabetes achieved specified levels of LDL-C (< 2.59, < 1.99, < 1.81 mmol/L), non-HDL-C (< 3.37, < 2.59 mmol/L) and apoB (< 0.9, < 0.8 g/L) with ezetimibe/statin versus statin. Patients with diabetes had larger mean per cent reductions in LDL-C and non-HDL-C than non-diabetes patients. A greater percentage of patients achieved both the LDL-C and apoB targets and all three LDL-C, apoB, and non-HDL-C targets with ezetimibe/statin versus statin in both subgroups. Patients with diabetes benefitted at least as much as, and sometimes more than, non-diabetes patients following treatment with ezetimibe/statin."
