The aim of this study was to determine whether urinary l-FABP levels are altered at various stages of diabetic nephropathy and whether pitavastatin affects urinary l-FABP levels in early diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "1": "Fifty-eight patients with type 2 diabetes (34 men and 24 women, median age 52 years) and 20 healthy, age-matched subjects (group E) were recruited for the study. The diabetic patients included 12 patients without nephropathy (group A), 20 patients with microalbuminuria (group B), 14 patients with macroalbuminuria and normal renal function (group C), and 12 patients with chronic renal failure but not undergoing hemodialysis (blood creatinine >1.2 mg/dl; mean 2.5 mg/dl, group D). Twenty group B patients were randomly assigned to receive 1 mg/day pitavastatin (10 patients, group B1) or placebo (10 patients, group B2). Treatment was continued for 12 months. Urinary l-FABP levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine and serum free fatty acids (FFAs) were also measured in group B.",

Urinary l-FABP levels in groups B-D were significantly higher than those in healthy subjects (group E, 5.8 +/- 4.0 microg/g creatinine) (group B, P < 0.05; group C, P < 0.01; group D, P < 0.01). In group B1, urinary albumin excretion (UAE) and urinary l-FABP levels were decreased after pitavastatin treatment (UAE before, 110 +/- 74 microg/min; 6 months, 88 +/- 60 microg/min, P < 0.05; 12 months, 58 +/- 32 microg/min, P < 0.01; l-FABP before, 18.6 +/- 12.5 microg/g creatinine; 6 months, 12.2 +/- 8.8 microg/g creatinine, P < 0.05; 12 months, 8.8 +/- 6.4 microg/g creatinine, P < 0.01). In group B2, UAE and l-FABP levels showed little change during the experimental period. In group B1, urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine was decreased 12 months after pitavastatin treatment (before 32.5 +/- 19.5 ng/mg creatinine, after 18.8 +/- 14.5 ng/mg creatinine, P < 0.01), but in group B2, these showed little difference during the experimental period. In both groups B1 and B2, serum FFAs showed little difference during the experimental period.",

    "4": "The beneficial effects of statins in reducing cardiovascular events have been attributed predominantly to their lipid-lowering effects, recent studies suggest that these effects might be due to their anti-inflammatory properties. We here investigate the in vivo and in vitro effects of simvastatin on cytokine production in pre-dialysis chronic renal failure patients.", 
    "5": "Our clinical study has been designed as a randomized double-blind placebo controlled study. A total of 55 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients at stages 3 and 4 (mean creatinine clearance 45 ml/min, range 15-60) were randomly assigned to receive simvastatin 40 mg/day or placebo, added to their ongoing treatment, for 6 months. Blood samples were obtained at baseline, and after 3 and 6 months of observation for the determination of lipids, inflammatory markers and renal function. For the in vitro studies, the effect of increasing doses of simvastatin on cytokine production [namely interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8] in human cultured monocytes from 10 healthy subjects (HS) and 15 CKD patients stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was investigated.", 
    "6": "A significant reduction in total cholesterol from 221+/-44 mg/dl to 184+/-41 mg/dl (3 months) and to 186+/-39 mg/dl (6 months) (P<0.02) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol from 139+/-40 mg/dl to 104+/-29 mg/dl (3 months) and to 100+/-31 mg/dl (6 months) (P<0.001) was observed in the 28 patients treated with simvastatin. In this group, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels significantly decreased from 2.6 mg/l [interquartile range (IQR 4.9)] to 2.0 mg/l (IQR 1.9) (P = 0.03) at 6 months (P<0.05). A parallel reduction of IL-6 levels from 5.1 pg/ml (IQR 3.8) to 3.5 pg/ml (IQR 3.1) (P = 0.001) at 6 months was also observed. No significant reduction in inflammatory markers [CRP from 5.1 mg/l (IQR 1.9) to 5.4 mg/l (IQR 1.3) (P = NS) at 6 months] or plasma lipids [LDL-cholesterol from 127+/-32 mg/dl to 131+/-21 mg/dl (6 months)] was observed in the 27 patients of the placebo group. In the in vitro studies, the average value for cell-associated IL-6 and IL-8 was higher in CKD (155+/-95 pg/ml monocytes for IL-6 and 722+/-921 pg/ml monocytes for IL-8) vs HS (137+/-87 pg/ml monocytes and 186+/-125 pg/ml monocytes) (P<0.01) and was not affected by simvastatin alone. LPS resulted in a significant increase in cytokine production (IL-6: 1954+/-321 pg/ml monocytes for CKD and 1451+/-237 pg/ml monocytes for HS; P<0.001); the simultaneous addition of increasing doses of simvastatin to these cultures induced a dose-dependent inhibition of IL-6 and IL-8 production in stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells in all groups.",

    "8": "The peroxisomal ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter adrenoleukodystrophy-related protein, encoded by ABCD2, displays functional redundancy with the X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy-associated protein, making ABCD2 up-regulation of therapeutic value. Cholesterol lowering activates human ABCD2 in cultured cells. To investigate in vivo regulation by sterols, we first characterized a sterol regulatory element (SRE) in the murine Abcd2 promoter that is directly bound by SRE-binding proteins (SREBPs). Intriguingly, this element overlaps with a direct repeat 4, which serves as binding site for liver X receptor (LXR)/retinoid X receptor heterodimers, suggesting novel cross-talk between SREBP and LXR/retinoid X receptor in gene regulation. Using fasting-refeeding and cholesterol loading, SREBP accessibility to the SRE/direct repeat 4 was tested. Results suggest that adipose Abcd2 is induced by SREBP1c, whereas hepatic Abcd2 expression is down-regulated by concurrent activation of LXRalpha and SREBP1c. In cell culture, SREBP1c-mediated Abcd2 induction is counteracted by ligand-activated LXRalpha. Finally, hepatic Abcd2 expression in LXRalpha,beta-deficient mice is inducible to levels vastly exceeding wild type. Together, we identify LXRalpha as negative modulator of Abcd2, acting through a novel regulatory mechanism involving overlapping SREBP and LXRalpha binding sites.", 
    "9": "Experimental evidence suggests that statins protect against breast carcinogenesis by interrupting cell cycle progression and promoting apoptosis. Evidence in humans is limited and inconsistent. The relation between serum cholesterol levels and breast cancer risk is itself unclear; because cholesterol is the precursor to sex steroid hormones, higher levels could plausibly increase risk.", 
    "10": "The associations of statins, general lipid-lowering drugs, and reported cholesterol levels with breast cancer risk were assessed in the Nurses' Health Study, with 6 to 12 years of follow-up. A total of 79,994 women aged 42 to 69 years and free of cancer were followed prospectively for up to 12 years. Current statin use, including duration, was assessed retrospectively in 2000 in 75,828 women. Self-reported serum cholesterol level was assessed prospectively between 1990 and 2000 in 71,921 women.", 
    "11": "Overall, we documented 3177 incident cases of invasive breast cancer. Compared with nonusers, current lipid-lowering drug users experienced similar breast cancer risk (multivariate relative risk [RR], 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86-1.13). Current use of statins also was not significantly associated with breast cancer risk (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.76-1.08). Associations by duration of current use were similarly null. Self-reported serum cholesterol levels were not associated with breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women with levels of 240 mg/dL or higher (> or = 6.22 mmol/L) compared with less than 180 mg/dL (< 4.66 mmol/L) (RR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.91-1.17).",

    "13": "The utility of stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) for the diagnosis and prognosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) has been firmly established in numerous clinical studies and has become an essential component of clinical practice. Stress MPI is now used regularly to guide initial risk stratification and management of patients with CAD. Because stress MPI provides an assessment of the physiologic significance of CAD, it is a particularly attractive procedure for assessing follow-up risk. Today, sequential stress MPI is being used increasingly to track disease progression, assess follow-up risk, detect restenosis following revascularization, and evaluate the efficacy of aggressive medical therapy and risk-factor modification. By providing serial snapshots of the disease and its impact on perfusion, sequential stress MPI may alter treatment decisions and ultimately improve long-term patient management and outcomes. Use of sequential stress MPI to detect changes in perfusion following surgical or medical therapies is being tested currently in the Clinical Outcomes Using Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation (COURAGE) and Adenosine Sestamibi Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography Postinfarction Evaluation (INSPIRE) trials.", 
    "14": "Although it is well recognized that stenotic coronary artery lesions carry a significant risk for cardiac events, the importance of nonstenotic lesions is generally underappreciated. However, many acute myocardial infarctions are caused by lesions that cause <50% stenosis. Coronary artery calcification is being increasingly studied as a marker of risk for cardiac events. Measurement of coronary artery calcium using electron-beam computed tomography is emerging as a useful tool to further risk-stratify patients who are otherwise at intermediate risk for events. Coronary calcium scores have been shown to add independent predictive value to traditional risk assessment.", 
    "15": "The effect of rosuvastatin or atorvastatin on urinary albumin excretion (UAE) was determined in type 2 diabetic patients. A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, response-based design compared rosuvastatin 10mg (titrated to 40 mg) with atorvastatin 10mg (titrated to 80 mg) in type 2 diabetic patients with dyslipidemia, with dose titration to an LDL-C target of <3.0 mmol/L. Overnight timed urine collections were obtained at baseline, 8 and 16 weeks to UAE. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was determined using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula. Patients with paired, UAE collections of at least 8h duration were analyzed (n=344). No significant change from baseline in UAE was observed for either treatment group or between-treatment groups at 16 weeks, and median UAE for both treatment groups remained within normal limits (rosuvastatin 4.5 microg/min, atorvastatin 5.0 microg/min). A similar absence of change from baseline was observed for 51 patients with UAE above the normal range at study entry (>20 microg/min). No significant change in GFR from baseline after 16 weeks was observed for either treatment group. These data provide reassurance that type 2 diabetic patients can be treated with higher efficacy statins without clinically meaningful effects on urinary albumin excretion.", 
    "16": "Statins, the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-cooenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, have been shown to inhibit the migration of macrophages and smooth muscle cell proliferation leading to an antiproliferative effect. Although this beneficial effect of statins has been suggested to be independent of lipid lowering properties, the possible mechanisms responsible for this action is largely unknown. Gap junctions, which serve as channels for direct intercellular exchange of ions, secondary messengers, and small signaling molecules, play an important role in tissue homeostasis and regulation of growth, differentiation, and development. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that expression of the component proteins of gap junctions, connexins 40 and 43 (Cx40 and Cx43), is upregulated in arteries subjected to balloon injury and that this upregulation can be suppressed by statin therapy. Male New Zealand white rabbits were subjected to injury in which an angioplasty catheter was introduced into the right iliac artery from the femoral artery under fluoroscopic guidance. Five groups of rabbits (n = 6 to 7) were treated for 2 weeks with one of the following: balloon injury (BL); BL+lovastatin (BL+L, 10 mg/kg/day); BL+fluvastatin (BL+F, 10 mg/kg/day); sham operation (Sham); and control (Con). Immunohistochemistry studies showed that Cx40 and Cx43 were expressed in normal smooth muscle cells (SMC) throughout the media. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis showed that Cx40 and Cx43 mRNA and protein expression was elevated after injury (P < .001 for both proteins and both assays), and these elevations were suppressed by lovastatin and fluvastatin to a similar degree (P < .05 for both drugs and both assays). Immunostaining of Cx40 and Cx43 was consistently enhanced in the neointimal area after injury and lovastatin and fluvastatin reduced staining of these proteins in the lessened neointimal layer. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that there were abundant gap junctions between neointimal SMC as well as fewer and smaller gap junctions after statin treatment. Therefore, balloon injury causes upregulation of Cx40 and Cx43 in neointimal SMC. Lovastatin and fluvastatin suppress upregulated Cx40 and Cx43 expression and reduce neointimal proliferation, suggesting that Cx40 and Cx43 may play a role in statin-induced antiproliferative effect.", 
    "17": "Hydroxymethyl-glutaryl-CoA-reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce cardiovascular mortality by decreasing cholesterol as well as by non-lipid-related actions. Oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ox-LDL) are pro-atherogenic molecules and potent platelet agonists. CD36 and lectin-like ox-LDL receptor-1 (LOX-1) are specific ox-LDL receptors also expressed in platelets. This study was planned to address whether treatment with atorvastatin 10 mg/day, pravastatin 40 mg/day or simvastatin 20 mg/day could affect platelet CD36 and LOX-1 expression. Twenty-four patients for each treatment were evaluated after 3, 6, and 9 days and at 6 weeks for complete lipid profile (chromogenic), ox-LDL (ELISA), platelet P-selectin (P-sel), CD36, LOX-1 (FACS), and intracellular citrullin recovery (iCit) (HPLC). Data show hyperactivated platelets (P-sel absolute values, percent variation in activated cells, all p < 0.001), and CD36 and LOX-1 overexpression (all p < 0.001) in patients at baseline. P-sel, CD36, and LOX-1 were significantly decreased by atorvastatin and simvastatin (all p < 0.01) and related with iCit increase (r = 0.58, p < 0.001) and platelet-associated ox-LDL (r = 0.51, p < 0.01) at 9 days. Pravastatin reduced LOX-1 and P-sel (p < 0.05) at 6 weeks in relation with decreased LDL and ox-LDL (r = 0.39, p < 0.01 and r = 0.37, p < 0.01, respectively). These data suggest that atorvastatin and simvastatin reduce platelet activity by exposure of CD36 and LOX-1 before significant LDL reduction, whereas pravastatin action is detected later and in relation with LDL and ox-LDL lowering. Rapid and consistent reduction of CD36 and LOX-1 could be considered a direct anti-atherothrombotic mechanism related to the role of ox-LDL in platelet activation, platelet-endothelium interactions, and NO synthase activity.", 
    "18": "Adhesion of mononuclear phagocytes (Macs) to extracellular matrices containing oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL) stimulates these cells to secrete reactive oxygen species (e.g., O2-, H2O2) that are believed to promote atherogenesis. Current in vitro systems designed to measure Mac H2O2 secretion in response to oxLDL show that these cells secrete H2O2 for only a few hours after plating. The slow onset and chronicity of atherogenesis, however, suggested to us that Mac ROS secretion might be sustained for much longer periods when Macs are maintained in an environment resembling that in the intima of arteries undergoing atherogenesis. The findings reported here confirm this suggestion. They show that Macs maintained on collagen IV matrices containing oxLDL in medium containing human plasma-derived serum secrete H2O2 continuously and in large amounts for at least 11 days. Using this system we tested the effects of compounds known to attenuate atherogenesis in vivo. Platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor antagonists, lovastatin, and the isoflavone protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitor genistein each reduced H2O2 secretion by Macs maintained on oxLDL-containing matrices by approximately 60%. Lovastatin's inhibitory effect was blocked completely by addition of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate to the medium. We conclude that matrix-bound and oxidized lipoproteins stimulate Macs to produce H2O2 continuously and in large quantities via a pathway that involves PAF receptors and PTK and is reversibly blocked by inhibitors of protein prenylation.", 
    "19": "Recent studies suggest that statins can protect the vasculature in a manner that is independent of their lipid-lowering activity through inhibition of the small guanosine triphosphate-binding protein, Rho, and Rho-associated kinase. Little information is available on the inhibitory effect of statins on vein graft intimal hyperplasia, the main cause of late graft failure after bypass grafting. We therefore examined the effects of a hydrophilic statin on vein graft intimal hyperplasia in vivo and Rho-kinase activity in vitro.", 
    "20": "In the first experiment, rabbits were randomized to a control group (n = 7) that was fed regular rabbit chow or to a pravastatin group (n = 7) that was fed regular rabbit chow supplemented with 10 mg/kg pravastatin sodium. The branches of the jugular vein were ligated and an approximately 3-cm segment of the jugular vein was taken for an autologous reversed-vein graft. The carotid artery was cut and replaced with the harvested autologous jugular vein. At 2 and 4 weeks after the operation, vein grafts in both groups were harvested, and intimal hyperplasia of the vein grafts was assessed. In the second experiment, human umbilical vein endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells were cultured and then treated with 1 micromol/L and 30 micromol/L pravastatin for 24 hours and harvested. Immunoblotting was performed on the resulting precipitates. Quantitative evaluation of phosphorylated myosin binding subunit and endothelial nitric oxide synthase was performed by densitometric analysis.", 
    "21": "We demonstrated that oral administration of the hydrophilic statin pravastatin to normocholesterolemic rabbits inhibited intimal hyperplasia of carotid interposition-reversed jugular vein grafts 4 weeks after implantation (pravastatin group, 39.5 +/- 3.5 microm vs control group, 64.0 +/- 7.1 microm; n = 7; P < .05) and suppressed cell proliferation and apoptosis in the neointima 2 weeks after implantation. In addition, we found that pravastatin inhibited Rho-kinase activity and accelerated endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells but did not inhibit Rho-kinase activity in vascular smooth muscle cells.", 
    "22": "These novel findings clearly demonstrate that a hydrophilic statin can suppress intimal hyperplasia of the vein graft in vivo and also show endothelial cell-tropic inhibition of Rho-kinase in vitro. Furthermore, these results strongly support the clinical use of hydrophilic statins to prevent intimal hyperplasia of the vein graft after bypass grafting.", 
    "23": "Late graft failure caused by neointimal hyperplasia limits the efficacy of vein grafting. Various treatments were examined to reduce neointimal hyperplasia, but a standard clinical treatment has not yet been established. We report here the inhibitory effect of pravastatin on the development of vein graft intimal hyperplasia. In addition, we demonstrate that pravastatin showed endothelial cell-tropic benefits through both the inhibition of Rho-kinase activity and acceleration of eNOS expression in vitro. Because the clinical benefits and safety of pravastatin have been established to a certain extent through long-term clinical usage, pravastatin may soon become standard treatment after vein bypass grafting.", 
    "24": "Experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) in rats is a T cell-mediated disorder and the involvement of Th1/Th2 unbalance has been demonstrated. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, atorvastatin, affects T cell-mediated autoimmunity through modulating the balance of Th1/Th2 and reduces the severity of EAM.", 
    "25": "Myocarditis was induced in 23 Lewis rats by injection of porcine cardiac myosin. High-dose (10 mg/kg/day) or low-dose (1 mg/kg/day) atorvastatin or vehicle was administered orally for 3 weeks to rats with EAM at the same time of immunization. Seven Lewis rats received neither immunization nor statins therapy were used as normal controls. On day 21 after immunization (the climax of inflammation), echocardiography was examined and the severity of myocarditis was evaluated by histopathological evaluation. The area ratio (affected/entire area percentage) of myocardial lesions was determined in histological sections. Heart weight/body weight ratio was determined and the serum lipid levels were measured. Levels of serum IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-10 were measured by ELISA.", 
    "26": "Cardiac function was improved in the two atorvastatin-treated groups compared to the untreated group. Heart weight/body weight ratio and the degree of inflammation were significantly lower in the two dosage statin-treated groups than that in the untreated one. Furthermore, treatment with atorvastatin decreased the expression levels of Th1 cytokine (IFN-gamma and IL-2), and increased the expression levels of Th2 cytokine (IL-4 and IL-10). Atorvastatin attenuated the histopathological severity of myocarditis. Plasma lipid levels did not differ between the groups.", 
    "27": "Atorvastatin ameliorates EAM by inhibiting T cell responses and suppressing Th1-type and inflammatory cytokines production and this activity is independent of cholesterol reduction, whereas Th2-type cytokines production was promoted. Atorvastatin may have beneficial effects on myocarditis by modulating the Th1/Th2 balance. These results demonstrate an important role of Th1/Th2 polarization in the pathogenesis of EAM and suggest that HMG-CoA reductase blockade may be a promising new strategy for the treatment of organ specific autoimmune diseases.",

    "29": "We evaluated the antithrombotic effects of nitropravastatin (NCX-6550) by assessing its activity on platelet activation and tissue factor (TF) expression by mononuclear cells in vitro and in vivo.", 
    "30": "In vitro, NCX-6550 inhibited (1) U46619- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation in buffer and plasma; (2) collagen-induced P-selectin expression in whole blood and (3) platelet adhesion to collagen-coated coverslips under high shear stress. These effects were displayed at concentrations of NCX-6550 ranging from 25 to 100 mum, and were totally reverted by the guanylylcyclase inhibitor ODQ (10 microm). Equimolar concentrations of pravastatin had no influence on these parameters of platelet function. LPS- and PMA-induced TF expression by blood mononuclear cells was also inhibited by NCX-6550 (IC50 13 microm), but not by pravastatin, as assessed by functional and immunological assays and by real-time PCR. In a mouse model of platelet pulmonary thromboembolism, induced by the i.v. injection of collagen plus epinephrine, pretreatment with NCX-6550 (24-48 mg kg(-1)) significantly reduced platelet consumption, lung vessel occlusion and mortality. Moreover, nitropravastatin markedly inhibited the generation of procoagulant activity by spleen mononuclear cells and peritoneal macrophages in mice treated with LPS. In these in vivo models too, pravastatin failed to affect platelet activation and monocyte/macrophage procoagulant activity.", 
    "31": "Our results show that nitropravastatin exerts strong antithrombotic effects in vitro and in vivo, and may represent an interesting antiatherothrombotic agent for testing in acute coronary syndromes.", 
    "32": "In the field of dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome, four innovative therapies are reviewed: Ezetimibe (Ez\u00e9trol) is a selective cholesterol absorption inhibitor. Co-administration of ezetimibe with low dose of statins shows LDL lowering comparable to that of the highest dose of the respective statin alone. Combination therapy helps more patients in achieving target LDL-cholesterol. Nicotinic acid (Niacin) favourably modifies all lipoprotein level (including Lp(a)). Extended release niacin (Niaspan\u00e2) is a new galenic form, with less side effects (flushing and hepatotoxicity) than the native nicotinic acid. This new preparation represents an effective option in the management of dyslipidemia. The polyunsatured fatty acids (PUFA) omega-3 (Omacor) decreases cardiovascular deaths and mainly fatal arrhythmias after myocardial infarction. Their favourable effects are linked mainly to their anti-inflammatory and antiarrhythmic properties. The PUFA omega-3 could be added to the secondary prevention after myocardial infarction. The blockade of the endocannabinoid system by a specific inhibitor of CB1 receptor (rimonabant or Acomplia) decreases food intake and weight and increases adiponectin and insulin sensitivity. Clinical studies on obesity and tobacco dependence are very encouraging.", 
    "33": "Patients previously not treated with a lipid-lowering agent (n = 20; mean age 49.15 +/- 3.28 years) were treated with either 10 mg/day of Simvastatin (n = 11), or Atorvastatin (n = 9) for 4 months. Fourteen additional patients were recruited from the same clinic at the same hospital as a control group. The medication of these latter patients was unaltered for 4 months and the same parameters were measured as for the statin groups. Serum concentrations of zinc, copper, caeruloplasmin, selenium, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured together with their lipid profiles pre- and post-treatment. In addition to reducing serum total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (p < 0.0001), statin treatment was associated with a significant reduction in mean serum zinc (9%, p = 0.03), copper (9%, p < 0.01), caeruloplasmin (24%, p < 0.05), and median CRP (45%, p < 0.03). Similar changes were not observed in the control patients. No significant effects were observed for serum selenium, copper/caeruloplasmin ratio, or GPx (p > 0.05) in either statin or control groups. These changes may be related to the known anti-inflammatory properties of the statin class of drugs.", 
    "34": "The cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin enhances the secretion of the alpha-secretase cleavage product of amyloid precursor protein (APP). To investigate whether this effect is mediated via activation of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), we treated SH-SY5Y cells and PC12 cells with lovastatin and measured the levels of alpha7 nAChRs, the alpha-form of secreted APP (alphaAPPs), and lovastatin-related lipids, including cholesterol and ubiquinone. The results showed that low concentrations of lovastatin significantly induced up-regulation of alpha7 nAChRs. No effects of lovastatin were observed on alpha3-containing nAChRs, muscarinic receptors, or N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. alphaAPPs levels increased in the culture medium of cells treated with lovastatin, whereas no change in whole APP was observed. The increase in alphaAPPs was inhibited by prior exposure of these cells to alpha-bungarotoxin, an antagonist of alpha7 nAChRs. The concentrations of lovastatin used in the study did not change the cholesterol content, but high doses can decrease the levels of ubiquinone and cell viability. These results indicate that lovastatin may play a neuronal role that is cholesterol independent. We also show that the up-regulation of alpha7 nAChRs stimulated by lovastatin is involved in a mechanism that enhances production of alphaAPPs during APP processing.",

The odds ratios were 2.28 (95% CI, 1.38 to 3.79) for Gln/Arg heterozygotes and 2.47 (95% CI, 1.18 to 5.19) for Arg/Arg homozygotes compared with Gln/Gln homozygotes. These results are consistent with 2 of 3 other published studies. In combined analysis of all 4 studies, the association between Gln192Arg SNP and stroke was highly significant (chi2(8df)=45.58, P<0.000001). Sequence analysis of the PON1 gene from seventy stroke cases revealed a novel nonsense mutation at codon 32 in one stroke case, which was not detected in over 2500 unaffected individuals. Polymorphisms in the PON2 and PON3 genes were not associated with stroke.", 
    "38": "These results suggest that Gln192Arg genotype is an important risk factor for stroke.", 
    "39": "Recent research has focused on the use of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a marker of inflammation, in the detection of patients at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Several prospective studies have demonstrated that hs-CRP is an independent predictor of future risk for cardiovascular events among healthy individuals, as well as among patients with acute coronary syndromes. In addition, because half of all cardiovascular events occur in persons with low to average levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, hs-CRP may aid in identifying patients at high risk for a first cardiovascular event who might otherwise be missed by lipid screening alone. Thus, hs-CRP is a potential adjunct for global risk assessment in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Heart Association have therefore proposed joint guidelines for the use of hs-CRP in determining cardiovascular disease risk. The author reviews numerous studies examining the prognostic value of hs-CRP and outlines ongoing efforts to assess the effect of statin therapy in healthy individuals with low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high levels of hs-CRP.",

However, combined statin and fibrate therapy can enhance myopathy risk. We tested the myotoxic potential of PPAR subtype selective agonists alone and in combination with statins in a differentiated rat myotube model. A pharmacologically potent experimental PPARalpha agonist, Compound A, induced myotoxicity as assessed by TUNEL staining at a minimum concentration of 1 nM, while other weaker PPARalpha compounds, for example, WY-14643, Gemfibrozil and Bezafibrate increased the percentage of TUNEL-positive nuclei at micromolar concentrations. In contrast, the PPARgamma agonist Rosiglitazone caused little or no cell death at up to 10 muM and the PPARdelta ligand GW-501516 exhibited comparatively less myotoxicity than that seen with Compound A. An experimental statin (Compound B) and Atorvastatin also increased the percentage of TUNEL-positive nuclei and co-treatment with WY-14643, Gemfibrozil or Bezafibrate had less than a full additive effect on statin-induced cell killing. The mechanism of PPARalpha agonist-induced cell death was different from that of statins. Unlike statins, Compound A and WY-14643 did not activate caspase 3/7. In addition, mevalonate and geranylgeraniol reversed the toxicity caused by statins, but did not prevent the cell killing induced by WY-14643. Furthermore, unlike statins, Compound A did not inhibit the isoprenylation of rab4 or rap1a. Interestingly, Compound A and Compound B had differential effects on ATP levels. Taken together, these observations support the hypothesis that in rat myotube cultures, PPARalpha agonism mediates in part the toxicity response to PPARalpha compounds. Furthermore, PPARalpha agonists and statins cause myotoxicity through distinct and independent pathways.",

However, the new therapeutic objectives of LDL-C, especially in high risk patients, makes it difficult to reach the LDL-C values desired in the daily clinical practice. The appearance of a new inhibitor of the intestinal cholesterol absorption (ezetimibe) noticeably strengthens the actions of the statins in the reduction of LDL-C.

This increase was entirely due to increases in statin use. Prescribed daily doses of statins increased in all countries for which data was available between 2000 and 2003, but still usually fell below the doses used in the major trials of statins. As a result, the numbers of PTDs increased to a lesser extent than suggested by utilization (e.g. by 192% in Ireland and by 35% in France). One-third of the total rise in utilization was explained by increased PDD, and two-thirds by an increase in numbers of PTDs.

A RhoB-caspase-2 association was consistently demonstrated in neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes with Western Blotting, either after immunoprecipitation with RhoB followed by immunoblotting with caspase-2, or in reciprocal experiments after immuno precipitation with caspase-2 and immunoblotting with RhoB (n = 14). Although the RhoB-caspase-2 complex was constitutively present, the link between RhoB and caspase-2 may be operative in apoptosis because the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin increased the RhoB-caspase complex, especially in the nuclear fraction of the cell, with a peak occurrence 2 h after treatment. This association was unaffected by the caspase-2 inhibitor zVDVAD. Lovastatin produced apoptosis that was accompanied by an activation of caspase-2, as demonstrated by its immunohistochemistry and by the fact that the caspase-2 inhibitor zVDVAD reduced lovastatin-induced apoptosis. Lovastatin induced dramatic changes in cell morphology and a reduction in F-actin. Immunoblotting for actin suggests that lovastatin does not induce a degradation of the actin molecule, but rather affects filamentous F-actin. Caspase-2 inhibition with zVDVAD reduced lovastatin-induced alteration in cytoskeletal F-actin. The Rho inhibitor, Clostridium difficile toxin B, blunted the ability of lovastatin to induce apoptosis. In summary, these data show a previously unrecognized association between RhoB and caspase-2 in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions, which has ramifications for processes regulated by RhoB and caspase-2, including apoptosis.",

The bisphosphonates, widely used in the treatment of osteoporosis, act by inhibiting bone resorption. However, there are few agents that promote or increase bone formation in patients who have suffered substantial bone loss. To facilitate the identification of novel anabolic therapies, the authors have developed a rapid, high-throughput in vivo screen using larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) in which they are able to identify agents with anabolic effects in the skeleton within a 6-day time period. Vitamin D3 analogs and intermittent parathyroid hormone (PTH) result in dose-dependent increases in the formation of mineralized bone, whereas continuous exposure to PTH results in net bone loss. Because this model is fast, economical, and genetically tractable, it provides a powerful adjunct to mammalian models for the identification of new anabolic bone agents and offers the potential for genetic elucidation of pathways important in osteoblastic activity.",

Cellular level studies on human disorders are needed, however, to provide a rational basis for clinical testing of statins as immune therapy. Coeliac disease, a chronic small intestinal inflammation driven by HLA-DQ2 restricted mucosal T cells that are specific for ingested wheat gluten peptides, is in many ways ideal for this purpose. In addition, there is a need for alternative treatment to the gluten-free diet in this disorder. Here we have assessed the effects of atorvastatin on gluten-reactive T cells, dendritic cells and the coeliac mucosa by in vitro culture of biopsies. Atorvastatin inhibited gluten-induced proliferation and specific cytokine production of human intestinal gluten-reactive T cell clones and lines. Dendritic cells exposed to atorvastatin displayed a reduced expression of the costimulatory molecule CD83 upon maturation with lipopolysaccharide. Incubation of intestinal biopsy specimens with atorvastatin in vitro, however, did not influence gluten-induced cytokine release. In conclusion, atorvastatin has specific effects on isolated gluten-reactive T cells and dendritic cells, but does not shut down the gluten-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines in intestinal biopsies.",

Adult (12-14 weeks) and old (60-80 weeks) rats were treated daily for 12 weeks with either vehicle or SV (1 mg kg(-1)). In old rats, SV treatment did not significantly affect systolic blood pressure and LDL-cholesterol, but it reduced plasma cholesterol, triglycerides and oxidised LDL though it did not affect total antioxidant status. SV improved endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine and A-23187 in vessels from aged, but not adult, rats. This effect was linked to a greater NO vasodilatation via an increased expression of endothelial NO-synthase. A mechanism sensitive to superoxide dismutase and catalase also accounts for enhanced endothelial vasodilatation. Finally, SV did not affect the release of prostacyclin, but it inhibited the generation of thromboxane (TX) A2 from COX-2 isoform. The effect of the latter was sensitive to the Tp receptor antagonist, ICI-192,605. The present study provides evidence that oral administration of SV improves endothelial dysfunction in the aorta from aged rats by mechanisms associated with enhanced NO vasodilatation, reduced release of TXA2 from cyclo-oxygenase, and increased antioxidant properties of the vessel wall. These data underscore a new therapeutic perspective for SV in age-related endothelial dysfunction.",

Although the statins share a common lipid-lowering effect, there are differences within this class of drugs. The statins differ in their pharmacokinetic effects, drug interaction profiles, and risk of myotoxicity.

The titration schedule for this study included the initiation of niacin-extended release/lovastatin 500/20 mg once a day for 4 weeks, titrated to the starting dose of 1000/40 mg after 4 weeks, and then titrated to the final dose of 2000/40 mg. The titration schedule for both atorvastatin and simvastatin was 10 mg per day for 8 weeks and then titrated to 40 mg per day. Using this schedule, 50% of niacin extended-release/lovastatin and atorvastatin patients reached low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol treatment goals within approximately 7 weeks, compared with simvastatin, in which 50% reached both treatment goals in 13-14 weeks.

    "97": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the major cause of death in developed countries and is rapidly becoming the major cause of death in the developing world. The increasing rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes, however, may slow the current favorable trends for deaths attributable to CVD in many developed countries. To improve control of risk factors for CVD, Wald and Law proposed a \"polypill,\" containing a statin, a diuretic, a beta-blocker, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, aspirin, and folic acid. This combination pharmacotherapy (CP) could be made widely available without treating specific risk factors or individuals. A workshop sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reviewed the concept of CP for both primary and secondary prevention. Combination pharmacotherapy may prove to be efficacious but may also have side effects and poor adherence, which may be greater than or less than that of other preventive approaches. Randomized trials are needed to study these issues, although the design for such trials is uncertain. The ability of CP to prevent CVD in a cost-effective manner must be demonstrated. Minority groups and people with low socioeconomic status in the United States have an increased risk for CVD, and the effectiveness of such pharmacotherapy must be considered for these populations. Combination pharmacotherapy may prove especially effective in the developing world, where studies of CP may precede those done in wealthier countries. Combination pharmacotherapy may have tremendous potential, but additional study and detailed evaluation are necessary.", 
    "98": "Arginine, a semi-essential amino acid, plays a major nutritional and metabolic role. In particular, arginine is the precursor of nitric oxide which is involved in the endothelial function. Several factors, such as hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, ageing and hypertension are established risk factors for atherosclerosis, in particular by decreasing the availability of nitric oxide. Thus, endothelial nitric oxide synthase has a pivotal role against atherosclerosis. A suitable amount of cofactor and a sufficient intake of arginine have been shown to modulate nitric oxide-induced vasodilatation: despite the fact that the intracellular concentration of arginine is well above the Km of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, an arginine supplemented-diet is effective in increasing the production of nitric oxide. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this \"arginine paradox\": co-localization of the arginine transporter with endothelial nitric oxide synthase, intracellular arginine regeneration from citrulline, balance between endothelial arginase and nitric oxide synthase. Statins which are HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors inhibit the synthesis of mevalonate, and thus that of cholesterol. In addition, statins increase the stabilization of endothelial nitric oxide synthase mRNA. The co-operation between cholesterol synthesis and the upregulation of caveolin-1 on the one hand, and the activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase on the other hand, is very tight. A depletion of cholesterol in the caveolae induces a decrease in caveolin-1 at the cell surface allowing NOS activation. Thus statins improve nitric oxide production and vasodilatation. In a recent work in the hypercholesterolemic Watanabe rabbit, we have demonstrated that the combination of arginine with a statin, namely atorvastatin, significantly hinders the spreading of atherosclerotic plaques as compared with monotherapies. Such association of a nutriment and a drug open a new area of therapeutic strategy.",

The efficacy of statins has been established in non-surgical patients with cardiovascular disease and also more recently in non-surgical patients who sustain an acute coronary event. Peri-operative statin administration has been shown to improve both short-term and long-term cardiac outcome following non-cardiac and coronary bypass graft surgery. This cardioprotection may be independent of peri-operative haemodynamics due to a positive effect on plaque stability. Recommendations for the peri-operative statin administration are suggested. These include indications for peri-operative statin therapy, timing of administration, therapeutic targets, duration of administration, the adverse implications of peri-operative statin withdrawal, safety and cost-effectiveness.",

They were randomized into Group I--23 patients who received placebo and Group II--23 patients who received statin therapy. Before and following 6 months of treatment PWV was evaluated using a computer system--COMPLIOR. In each patient carotid-femoral PWV was measured. For automatic measurement of PWV pressure waveforms were digitized at rate 500Hz for carotid-femoral distance.",

This result may be explained by beneficial effect of statins on the degree of plaque growth. The alternative explanation may be the influence of statins on vascular remodelling.",

He suffered collapse and was in shock characterised by marked hypotension, facial oedema and eosinophilia. His initial condition led the surgeons to think he might have had an abdominal sepsis. The reaction with angio-oedema reoccurred on rechallenge. The literature on statin hypersensitivity reactions which can occur several months after commencing therapy is reviewed. Although the estimated prevalence is rare (0.1%), prescribers and pharmacists should be aware of this important reaction which can be quite debilitating.", 
    "110": "Resistin is a novel cysteine-rich protein that plays a role in the development of insulin resistance and atherosclerosis. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) possess anti-inflammatory properties that are independent of their lipid-lowering action. The aims of this study were to investigate the effect of atorvastatin on expression of resistin in vitro and to determine the effect of 6 months of treatment with atorvastatin on serum levels of resistin in patients with type 2 diabetes. 3T3-L1 adipocytes and human monocytes/macrophages and preadipocytes were incubated with 1 and 10 micromol/l atorvastatin for 24 and 48 h, followed by measurement of resistin mRNA by the quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Serum resistin concentration in the patients with type 2 diabetes was measured at baseline and after 6 months of atorvastatin treatment (10 mg/day). qRT-PCR analysis revealed that atorvastatin decreased resistin mRNA expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Serum resistin concentration tended to decrease after 6 months of atorvastatin treatment, although this decrease did not reach statistical significance. In conclusion, the findings of our in vitro study contribute to the growing volume of evidence on the anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic effects of statins, and led us to suggest that statins may control inflammatory responses by inhibiting expression of resistin mRNA. It is necessary to confirm the findings of our in vitro study by an appropriately designed large-scale clinical study.",

Recent experimental data point to neuroprotective properties of statins in acute cerebral ischemia. There is a proven link between bioavailability of nitric oxide and the activity of statins and ischemic stroke. Due to their ability to up-regulate nitric oxide synthase, statins have been considered in the therapy of a number of the central nervous system disorders, including cerebral ischemia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, tumors, and trauma. It has been claimed that they suppress inflammatory response and secondary injury after acute ischemia.", 
    "112": "Caspases play important roles in apoptotic cell death and in some other functions, such as cytokine maturation, inflammation, or differentiation. We show here that the 5'-flanking region of the human CASP-2 gene contains three functional response elements for sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs), proteins that mediate the transcriptional activation of genes involved in cholesterol, triacylglycerol, and fatty acid synthesis. Exposure of several human cell lines to statins, lipid-lowering drugs that drive SREBP proteolytic activation, induced the CASP-2 gene to an extent similar to that for known targets of SREBP proteins. Adenoviral vector-mediated transfer of active SREBP-2 also induced expression of the CASP-2 gene and the caspase-2 protein and increased the cholesterol and triacylglycerol cellular content. These rises in lipids were strongly impaired following small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of the CASP-2 gene. Taken together, our results identify the human CASP-2 gene as a member of the SREBP-responsive gene battery that senses lipid levels in cells and raise the possibility that caspase-2 participates in the control of cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels.", 
    "113": "Nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC) are etiologically related to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and malignant NPC cells have consistent although heterogeneous expression of the EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1). LMP1 trafficking and signaling require its incorporation into membrane rafts. Conversely, raft environment is likely to modulate LMP1 activity. In order to investigate NPC-specific raft partners of LMP1, rafts derived from the C15 NPC xenograft were submitted to preparative immunoprecipitation of LMP1 combined with mass spectrometry analysis of coimmunoprecipitated proteins. Through this procedure, galectin 9, a beta-galactoside binding lectin and Hodgkin tumor antigen, was identified as a novel LMP1 partner. LMP1 interaction with galectin 9 was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and Western blotting in whole-cell extracts of NPC and EBV-transformed B cells (lymphoblastoid cell lines [LCLs]). Using mutant proteins expressed in HeLa cells, LMP1 was shown to bind galectin 9 in a TRAF3-independent manner. Galectin 9 is abundant in NPC biopsies as well as in LCLs, whereas it is absent in Burkitt lymphoma cells. In subsequent experiments, NPC cells were treated with Simvastatin, a drug reported to dissociate LMP1 from membrane rafts in EBV-transformed B cells. We found no significant effects of Simvastatin on the distribution of LMP1 and galectin 9 in NPC cell rafts. However, Simvastatin was highly cytotoxic for NPC cells, regardless of the presence or absence of LMP1. This suggests that Simvastatin is a potentially useful agent for the treatment of NPCs although it has distinct mechanisms of action in NPC and LCL cells.",

    "119": "Fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation differentially affect plasma apolipoprotein B (apoB) levels. To identify the mechanisms underlying the effect of octanoate on very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion, chicken primary hepatocytes were incubated with either fatty acid-bovine serum albumin (BSA) complexes or BSA alone. Addition of octanoate to culture medium significantly reduced VLDL-triacylglycerol (TG), VLDL-cholesterol and apoB secretion from hepatocytes compared to both control cultures with BSA only and palmitate treatments, but did not modulate intracellular TG accumulation. However, no differences in cellular microsomal triglyceride transfer protein levels were observed in the cultures with saturated fatty acid. In pulse-chase studies, octanoate treatment resulted in reduced apoB-100 synthesis, in agreement with its promotion of secretion. This characteristic effect of octanoate was confirmed by addition of a protease inhibitor, N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN), to hepatocyte cultures. Analysis showed that the level of apoB mRNA was lower in cultures supplemented with octanoate than in the control cultures, but no significant changes were observed in the levels of apolipoprotein A-I, fatty acid synthase and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase mRNA as a result of octanoate treatment. Time-course studies indicate that a 50% reduction in apoB mRNA levels requires 12 h of incubation with octanoate. We conclude that octanoate reduced VLDL secretion by the specific down-regulation of apoB gene expression and impairment of subsequent synthesis of apoB, not by the modulation of intracellular apoB degradation, which is known to be a major regulatory target of VLDL secretion of other fatty acids.", 
    "120": "The objective of the present investigation was to evaluate an oral 'drug delivery' approach, which involves co-administration of absorption enhancers (AEs). The representative low permeable hydrophilic (biopharmaceutic classification system (BCS) Class III) drugs used in the study comprised of cefotaxime sodium and ceftazidime pentahydrate, whereas low permeable lipophilic (BCS Class IV) drugs include cyclosporin A and lovastatin. AEs from three different chemical classes, namely, medium chain fatty acids (sodium caprylate and caprate), cyclodextrins (beta-cyclodextrin, hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin) and bile salts (sodium cholate and deoxycholate) were evaluated for absorption enhancement efficacy, mechanism of action and toxicity using in vitro everted intestinal sac model. These AEs were found to enhance intestinal permeability of drugs from 2- to 27-fold. Light microscopy studies of intestinal sac incubated with AEs for 120 min revealed morphological changes in absorptive mucosa and rank order of toxicity were cyclodextrins>bile salts congruent with medium chain fatty acids. Fluorescence polarization studies indicated that brush bordered membrane vesicles labeled with lipophilic (DPH, 12AS) and hydrophilic dyes (ANS), when treated with AEs exhibited concentration and time dependent decrease in fluorescence polarization. Total protein released in presence of AEs was more than control but considerably less than EDTA (0.58% w/v), which is known to cause toxic release of proteins from cell. Overall, AEs were found to significantly enhance drug permeability by decreasing lipid membrane fluidity and/or interacting with hydrophilic domains of membrane, and has the potential to improve oral delivery.", 
    "121": "Statins are lipid-lowering agents with pleiotropic effects. We investigated the apoptotic effects of fluvastatin on peripheral CD4+ T cells from healthy subjects. Fluvastatin induced apoptosis in resting CD4+ T cells but not in CD4+ T cells strongly activated with a high concentration of PMA plus ionomycin (PMA/I) analyzed with annexin V and propidium iodide staining. However, CD4+ T cells activated with a low concentration of PMA/I or with anti-CD3 antibodies were apoptotic after treatment with fluvastatin. Activities of caspases-8, -9, and -3 were increased in resting CD4+ T cells treated with fluvastatin (10 microM). In strongly activated CD4+ T cells, fluvastatin inhibited the activation of caspase-8 induced by PMA/I and increased caspase-9 activity. The caspase-3 activity did not differ between untreated and fluvastatin-treated strongly activated CD4+ T cells. Treatment with fluvastatin (10 microM) enhanced cytochrome c release and increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in both resting and strongly activated CD4+ T cells. Although the in vitro concentration of fluvastatin used in this study is higher than in vivo, other factors may sensitize apoptotic cell death of CD4+ T cells in vivo. In conclusion, fluvastatin induces apoptosis in resting T cells but not in strongly activated T cells, a difference that might be due to the interaction between caspase-8 and caspase-9.", 
    "122": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancer-related causes of death worldwide. In light of the very poor 5 year survival new therapeutic approaches are mandatory. Several reports indicate that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is expressed frequently in HCC, most likely contributing to the aggressive growth characteristics of these tumors. Cetuximab, a chimeric monoclonal IgG1 antibody directed against the EGFR, potently suppresses the growth of various cancers but its effect on HCC remains to be explored. We therefore studied the antineoplastic potency of cetuximab in human HCC cells alone and in combination with growth factor tyrosine-kinase inhibition (TKI) or HMG-CoA-reductase inhibiton or conventional cytostatics. Cetuximab inhibited growth of p53 wild-type HepG2 hepatocellular cancer cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Cetuximab treatment resulted in arresting the cell cycle in the G(1)/G(0)-phase due to an increase of expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21(Waf1/CIP1) and p27(Kip1) and a decrease in cyclin D1 expression. Additionally, we observed a moderate increase in apoptosis as demonstrated by caspase-3 activation. Combining cetuximab with TKIs (erlotinib or AG1024) or the HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor fluvastatin or doxorubicin resulted in synergistic antiproliferative effects. In contrast, p53 mutated Huh-7 hepatocellular cancer cells proved to be less sensitive towards cetuximab, but when combined with TKIs or fluvastatin or doxorubicin a pronounced reduction of cell growth was observed. To conclude, our study may provide a rationale for future clinical investigations of cetuximab combination therapy for growth control of hepatocellular cancer.", 
    "123": "Emerging data suggest that acute presentations of coronary artery disease may involve a complex interplay between the vessel wall, inflammatory cells, and the coagulation cascade. Although a culprit thrombotic lesion may be treated effectively by antithrombotic therapy and revascularization, this will have little effect on the global processes that determine recurrent events at non-culprit sites. Thus, additional systemic treatment is required to modulate the adverse biological features that are the hallmark of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Statins possess multiple beneficial effects that are independent of low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering and that have favorable effects on inflammation, the endothelium, and the coagulation cascade. In the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 22 (PROVE IT-TIMI 22) trial, differences were seen based on achieved LDL-C that could be further discriminated by the achieved C-reactive protein level. Studies of non-vascular disease such as multiple sclerosis have shown that statins reduce inflammation, supporting the presence of lipid-independent effects of statins.

To elucidate the biosynthetic origin of 4,8-DMD, the following studies were performed: (1) effects of juvenile hormone (JH) III, and pathway inhibitors mevastatin, an inhibitor of the mevalonate pathway, and 2-octynoic acid, an inhibitor of the fatty acid pathway, were tested to determine whether 4,8-DMD is derived from the fatty acid pathway or the mevalonate pathway; (2) incorporation of 13C-labeled acetate, propionate, and mevalonolactone into 4,8-DMD was measured to directly determine the biosynthetic origin of 4,8-DMD; and (3) incorporation of deuterium-labeled precursors, including 2-methylbutanoate (C5D), 4-methylhexanoate (C7D), 2,6-dimethyloctanoate (C10D), and 4,8-dimethyldecanoate (C12D) was tested to determine whether 4,8-DMD is biosynthesized in the sequence Ac-Pr-Ac-Pr-Ac (Ac; acetate, Pr; propionate). JH III was topically applied to males at various doses. Inhibitors and isotopically labeled substrates were administered orally by feeding the beetles flour treated with the substrates of interest, after which volatiles were collected from both sexes of RFBs. The amount of 4,8-DMD produced was significantly reduced with increasing doses of JH III. Also, 2-octynoic acid inhibited the production of 4,8-DMD, but mevastatin did not. Exposure of RFBs to [1-(13)C]acetate and [1-(13)C]propionate, but not [2-(13)C]mevalonolactone, resulted in incorporation of the labeled compounds into 4,8-DMD. RFBs fed flour treated with deuterium-labeled C5D, C10D, and C12D, but not C7D, incorporated these compounds into 4,8-DMD. The findings that the production of 4,8-DMD was inhibited by 2-octynoic acid but unaffected by mevastatin, combined with the high incorporation of [1-(13)C]acetate and [1-(13)C]propionate into 4,8-DMD and the incorporation of deuterated precursors, unambiguously demonstrated that 4,8-DMD is of fatty acid rather than terpene biosynthetic origin, and that the biosynthesis of 4,8-DMD proceeds in the sequence Ac-Pr-Ac-Pr-Ac.",

Although type 2 diabetes is associated with a clustering of risk factors, the cause for an excess risk of cardiovascular disease remains unknown. Lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities in type 2 diabetes include particularly elevated levels of total and very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides and reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels are usually normal if glycemic control is adequate but LDL particles are small and dense. According to prospective population-based studies, total cholesterol is a similar risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients with type 2 diabetes as it is in nondiabetic subjects. High total triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol may be even stronger risk factors for CHD in patients with type 2 diabetes than in nondiabetic subjects. Recent drug treatment trials have indicated that the lowering of total and LDL cholesterol by statins, and the lowering of total triglycerides and the raising of HDL cholesterol by fibrates, are at least as beneficial in diabetic patients as in nondiabetic subjects in the prevention of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "168": "The aim of this study was to appreciate consequences of rosuvastatin administration on hemodynamic function, vascular oxidative stress and ischemia/reperfusion disorders in normotensive and hypertensive rats. At 10 weeks of age, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR, n=20) and normotensive Wistar Kyoto male rats (WKY, n=20) were divided into four groups and given, either vehicle or 10 mg/kg/day of rosuvastatin by gavage for 3 weeks. Systolic blood pressure was assessed every week. At the end of these treatments, vascular NADPH oxidase activity was evaluated by chemiluminescence (lucigenin 0.5 microM). Hearts were isolated and perfused according to the Langendorff method and were subjected to 30 min of global ischemia. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during reperfusion were quantified by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy using a spin probe (CP-H, 1 mM). After one week of treatment, rosuvastatin reduced the arterial pressure in SHR rats (180.3 +/- 2.1, SHR vs 169.7 +/- 2.3 mmHg, SHR+rosuvastatin; p < 0.01), without lowering plasma cholesterol levels; these effects were not observed in WKY. NADPH activity was 25% higher in control SHR rat aortas compared to control WKY, and was reduced by rosuvastatin in SHR rats. In isolated rat hearts subjected to ischemia/reperfusion sequences, there was a deterioration in functional parameters in control SHR compared to control WKY hearts. Rosuvastatin decreased post-ischemic contracture in WKY hearts by 50% (41.5 +/- 7.5, WKY control vs 18.4 +/- 4.6 mmHg, WKY+rosuvastatin; p < 0.01) and increased left ventricular developed pressure. This beneficial effect was accompanied by a decrease in ROS detected by ESR during reperfusion (312.5 +/- 45.3, WKY control; vs 219.3 +/- 22.9 AUC/mL, WKY+rosuvastatin; p < 0.05). In conclusion, these results are in accordance with the hypothesis that oxidative stress plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases including hypertension, and demonstrate the beneficial effects of rosuvastatin.",

However, recent systematic reviews have demonstrated that propensity score methods are inconsistently used and frequently poorly applied in the medical literature. In this study, we compared the following propensity score methods for estimating the reduction in all-cause mortality due to statin therapy for patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction: propensity-score matching, stratification using the propensity score, covariate adjustment using the propensity score, and weighting using the propensity score. We used propensity score methods to estimate both adjusted treated effects and the absolute and relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality. We also examined the use of statistical hypothesis testing, standardized differences, box plots, non-parametric density estimates, and quantile-quantile plots to assess residual confounding that remained after stratification or matching on the propensity score. Estimates of the absolute reduction in 3-year mortality ranged from 2.1 to 4.5 per cent, while estimates of the relative risk reduction ranged from 13.3 to 17.0 per cent. Adjusted estimates of the reduction in the odds of 3-year death varied from 15 to 24 per cent across the different propensity score methods.",

Following an 8-week washout period, 1298 subjects, categorized as low, medium, or high risk, were assigned to 4 weeks of treatment with a starting dose of atorvastatin selected by the algorithm. At week 4, subjects who did not achieve goal (15.8%) were titrated to the next-higher dose. The primary endpoint was the percentage of subjects in each risk group who achieved LDL-cholesterol goal at week 8. At 8 weeks, 84.8% of subjects (low risk 92.9%; moderate risk 84.0%; high risk 81.1%) achieved LDL-cholesterol target. The majority of patients (84.2%) achieved their lipid target through the use of the algorithm-based starting dose (10-80 mg) without the need for titration. No patient had elevations in creatine phosphokinase >10 times the upper limit of normal. Elevations in alanine aminotransaminase or aspartate aminotransaminase were observed in <1% of study subjects and were unrelated to dose. Selecting the starting dose of atorvastatin using a treatment algorithm achieves NCEP ATP III LDL-cholesterol goals in the majority of patients and minimizes the need for dose titration.",

They also decrease coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), an effect that may negate some of the statin benefit on CVD. We examined the relationship between plasma CoQ10 concentration and CVD in a prospective case-control study of the effect of pravastatin. Plasma samples from 250 LIPID trial patients who over 6 years suffered a recurrent CVD event (CVD death, nonfatal MI or stroke) and 250 matched controls who remained event-free for the same duration of follow-up were assayed for CoQ10 and lipids (cholesterol and cholesterylesters). Mean plasma CoQ10 concentrations were significantly lower in pravastatin-treated patients than in those assigned placebo (0.51 versus 0.60 micromol/L, P = 0.006), and there was a moderate correlation between CoQ10 and common cholesterylesters (Pearson correlation coefficients in patients randomised to placebo, range r = 0.42-0.63). Univariate conditional logistic regression did not suggest any relationship between plasma CoQ10 and the risk of future CVD events (odds ratio 1.18; 95% CI 0.74-1.87; P = 0.49). Instead, we observed a reduction in the rate of recurrent CVD events with increasing ratio of plasma cholesterylarachidonate to cholesteryllinoleate.

In two out of the four patients (mother and son), pathological findings on EMG suggested myopathy, and muscle biopsies showed evidence of mitochondrial pathology. A third patient (daughter) had slight myopathic findings on EMG and muscle biopsy, but not enough to be classified as pathological. In a fourth patient, there were no pathological findings. Creatine kinase levels were normal and symptoms diminished after discontinuation of drugs in all four patients. Our findings are consistent with other reports of statin-associated myopathy with normal creatine kinase levels.

In fact, the level of care for patients with PAD is lower as compared with those with ischaemic heart disease, although PAD is defined to be a coronary artery risk equivalent. This paper reviews observational data and generalisation from trials in patients with other manifestations of cardiovascular disease that support the importance of treating key risk factors such as smoking, diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia in PAD patients.",

Current evidence has implicated a role for inflammation in the pathogenesis of this process. Thus, inflammatory cytokines may attenuate interstitial collagen synthesis, increase matrix degradation and promote apoptosis in several atheroma-associated cell types, and all these cellular events may enhance plaque vulnerability. Recently, a series of experimental studies have reported the plaque-stabilising effects of immunomodulatory therapy such as chemokine blockade, anti-CD40 ligand and IL-10. It is conceivable that some of these approaches will be tested clinically and, if successful, they could provide novel treatment strategies for atherosclerotic plaque stabilisation.",

This was a randomized, open-label trial with subjects assigned to fenofibrate 200 mg (n = 88) or pravastatin 40 mg (n = 86) daily. Subjects who failed to reach the NCEP composite goal on monotherapy by week 12 received both drugs. The composite goal at week 12 was achieved in 1% of fenofibrate and 5% of pravastatin subjects. At week 16, 69/88 subjects on fenofibrate added pravastatin (FP) and 67/86 subjects on pravastatin added fenofibrate (PF). At week 48, 7% FP subjects and 3% PF subjects achieved the composite goal. Median changes in LDL/HDL/TG/non-HDL were -8/+5/-144/+50 and -14/+2/-66/+34 mg/dl in subjects receiving FP and PF, respectively. There were few adverse events and no rhabdomyolysis reported.

MMP biosynthesis is mediated by prostaglandin (PG)E2, the product of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2/inducible PGE synthase (mPGES) activity. We have recently reported the overexpression of COX-2/mPGES-1 in vulnerable plaques as a basis of MMP-mediated plaque instability. Hypercholesterolemia and hypertension are two important risk factors for atherosclerosis. Recent trial showed that statins and AT1 receptor blockers significantly reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events in humans. Since anti-inflammatory effects have been reported in association to therapy with statins or AT1 receptor blockers, in two different studies we hypothesized that these drugs can stabilize atherosclerotic plaques through modulation of COX-2/mPGES-1-dependent MMP biosynthesis. Our data demonstrated the stabilizing effect of atherosclerotic plaques by simvastatin or irbesartan, that is due, at least in part, to the reduction of inflammatory burden and suppression of PGE2-dependent metalloproteinases release.",

In addition to traditional risk factors, systemic inflammation, immune-mediated responses and thrombophilia have been suggested to play a major role in sustaining the premature atherosclerosis in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. This review focuses on the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating mechanisms of statins as demonstrated in in vitro and in vivo experimental models, providing new insights for the use of statins in treating systemic autoimmune diseases both for their anti-atherosclerotic activity and for their pleiotropic effects on inflammation, haemostasis and the immune responses.",

    "194": "Beta-blockade is a standard cardiovascular therapy known to induce the up-regulation of beta-adrenoceptor density. Upon ligand-binding, beta-adrenoceptors are normally internalised via the arrestin pathway, and after dissociation they are re-inserted into the membrane. This means that at high catecholamine levels the adrenoceptor density is low and under beta-blockade it is high. The insertion of receptors into the membrane is often dependent on farnesylation processes that can be inhibited by statins. We carried out a prospective, controlled, observational study to determine whether beta-blockade-induced up-regulation of beta-adrenoceptor density is attenuated by statin therapy and whether this would subsequently affect catecholamine consumption during surgery. We obtained pre-operative blood samples and intra-operative biopsies of the right atrial appendage from 39 patients (age: 65+/-5 years; BMI: 28+/-1) undergoing coronary bypass surgery with or without simvastatin (20 mg/day) therapy and with or without concomitant metoprolol therapy (50 mg/day). The atrial tissue was used for radioligand-binding studies with (-)-[125I]-iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) and for assessment of the beta-adrenoceptor subtype distribution following standard protocols. In the blood samples, plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations were determined using HPLC. In all tissue samples, we found a total beta-adrenoceptor density of 38+/-4 fmol/mg protein in untreated controls; this which was up-regulated to 55+/-5 fmol/mg protein in patients receiving metoprolol. This increase in receptor number was nearly prevented completely by simvastatin therapy (42+/-5 fmol/mg protein). The up-regulation could be attributed to increases in the beta1-adrenoceptor subtype. In contrast, simvastatin alone had no effect on beta-adrenoceptor density. Pre-operative adrenaline levels were slightly reduced in all drug therapy groups (nonsignificant differences), while the levels noradrenaline were not significantly different among the groups. With respect to the perioperative catecholamine requirements, patients on metoprolol needed significantly less dopamine than control patients, while patients undergoing simvastatin/metoprolol therapy needed as much as the controls. The post-operative total catecholamine requirements were not different among the four groups of patients. There were no differences in plasma metoprolol concentration between patients receiving metoprolol alone and those receiving a combination of metoprolol and simvastatin.",

Additional simvastatin therapy did not reduce post-operative catecholamine consumption.", 
    "196": "The sequelae of cardiovascular disease contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality in developed nations. As a class, the statins have been shown to measurably reduce the burden of atherosclerotic illness. However, muscle- and, more recently, nerve-related toxicity have emerged as potential complications leading to treatment withdrawal. Generally, the myopathic signs and symptoms of tenderness, myalgias, cramping and elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) activity are fully reversible after drug discontinuation. Growing evidence suggests that latent or previously minimal symptomatic muscle disease may predispose to the development of myopathy. Less information is available regarding the natural history of the sensorimotor neuropathy, but it appears to be less reversible if large fiber function is clinically manifest. Pathophysiologic clues regarding the potential causes of statin myopathy with or without neuropathy are discussed with particular attention paid to the implications of disrupted mevalonate metabolism. For example, secondary defects in isoprenoid biosynthesis are expected to impair the production of a variety of intermediaries such as dolichols, which are crucial for N-linked glycosylation; geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, which is necessary for coenzyme Q10 and G-protein synthesis; farnesyl-pyrophosphate, which facilitates the endoproteolytic cleavage and maturation of prelamin A and modifies B-type lamins and G-proteins; and isopentenylpyrophosphate, which is involved in a nucleoside modification of selenocysteinyl-tRNA and thus indirectly related to the synthesis of all selenoproteins (estimated at 35). The nature of statin neuromyotoxicity remains unresolved; however, investigating the cellular corollaries of deranged isoprenoid metabolism may uncover clues that lead to a more complete understanding of the elusive pathophysiology."
