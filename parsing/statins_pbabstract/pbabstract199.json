This is a critical review of those syndromes that are most well founded on evidence of challenge/de-challenge/re-challenge, case-controls, or experimental controls.", 
    "1": "Statins are well tolerated drugs with very high safety windows in skeletal muscle, and third-generation statins now under development offer the hope of even less risk of toxic myopathy. Toxicity is dose-related and time-related, and is due to intramyofiber cascades downstream from 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG Co-A) reductase inhibition. A robust pathophysiologic animal model shows that statins decrease strength and increase cytosolic Ca2+ by increasing both mitochondrial Ca2+ permeability and Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum. As a result, the earliest pathologic change in statin myotoxicity is compatible with simple necrosis and intracellular membrane accumulation. Genome-wide searching has yielded a single nucleotide polymorphism in the SLCO1B1 gene for the organic anion-transporting polypeptide that regulates statin uptake. Drug-drug interactions dominate recent reports of all toxic myopathies. The peculiar mitochondrial pathology of zidovudine-induced mitochondrial DNA depletion, cytochrome oxidase depletion, and mitochondrial proliferation has been confirmed in a rigorous animal model. Finally, recent interest has been piqued by putative lipid-lowering neutraceuticals like red yeast rice (Monascus purpureus) and edible mushrooms that can clearly cause toxic myopathy.", 
    "2": "A principled approach to the diagnosis of toxic myopathies, based on the consideration of currently known pathophysiologic mechanisms, biopsy pathology, the characteristic clearance properties of creatine kinase, the time course of muscle fiber regeneration, drug challenge/de-challenge/re-challenge, and differential diagnoses, rather than on mere temporal association, will reduce the healthcare costs of common diagnostic error.", 
    "3": "Calcific aortic stenosis, characterized by excessive fibrosis and deposition of bone-like calcified tissue, affects roughly 2% to 3% of the U.S. population over the age of 65. Recent studies have suggested that statins have a positive effect on the progression of aoritic stenosis, likely because of their ability to affect the resident cell population, known as valvular interstitial cells (VICs). VICs are fibroblastic cells that can differentiate to form activated myofibroblasts, displaying increased alpha smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA) expression, contractility, and collagen production.", 
    "4": "In culture, VICs spontaneously form multicellular aggregates that subsequently develop into calcified nodules, providing an in vitro model for aortic stenosis. Using real-time microscopic tracking, we observed that confluent VIC monolayers spontaneously contract into rounded nodules, suggesting that myofibroblastic contractility is a critical step in the process of nodule formation. Overexpression of alphaSMA increased VIC calcific nodule formation and contractility, whereas knockdown of alphaSMA with siRNAs reduced these phenotypes, suggesting that the expression and contractile properties of alphaSMA are essential to the formation of nodules. Statin treatment of VICs reduced alphaSMA expression, inhibited contractility, and decreased nodule formation. When statins were used to treat preformed nodules, no decrease in the number of calcified nodules was observed, suggesting that statins may play more of a preventative role in aortic stenosis than a cure.", 
    "5": "Our studies provide evidence of a causal relationship between VIC myofibroblastic activity and initial VIC calcific nodule formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that pravastatin inhibition of calcific nodule formation is related to inhibition of myofibroblastic activity.",

Niacin (vitamin B3) is a lipid-modifying drug and laropiprant is an anti-flushing agent, which reduces flushing induced by niacin. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, 24-week trial, a significant (p < 0.001) reduction (18.4%) in plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (primary endpoint) was achieved with ER niacin/laropiprant 2000 mg/40 mg once daily (after an initial 4-week 1000 mg/20 mg once-daily regimen) compared with placebo (weeks 12-24) in adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia or mixed dyslipidaemia. ER niacin/laropiprant 2000 mg/40 mg plus simvastatin 20 mg or 40 mg once daily (after an initial 4-week lower-dose regimen) produced significant (p < 0.05) improvements, from baseline, in LDL-C levels (primary endpoint) compared with once-daily ER niacin/laropiprant 2000 mg/40 mg or simvastatin alone at week 12 in a randomized, double-blind, multicentre, factorial trial in adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia or mixed dyslipidaemia. The incidence and intensity of flushing (an efficacy endpoint) were significantly (p < 0.05) reduced with ER niacin/laropiprant compared with ER niacin in randomized trials. ER niacin/laropiprant, alone or in combination with a statin, was generally well tolerated for up to 24 weeks by adults with dyslipidaemia or primary hyercholesterolaemia.",

There was no significant difference in hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha mRNA expression between the coronary heart disease patients and controls. The protein expression of heme oxygenase-1, hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha, and ubiquitin was significantly stronger in patients with coronary heart disease than in controls, and the expression levels increased with the severity of the disease. There was a positive association between heme oxygenase-1 and hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha and ubiquitin, antioxidative therapy with adrenergic receptor blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or statins up-regulated the expression of heme oxygenase-1 and hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha.",

Of these patients, 150 received LLT (including statins) early after surgery. Prosthetic valve haemodynamics on echocardiography and freedom from re-operation for SVD were compared between patients who did and did not receive postoperative LLT.", 
    "13": "After bioprosthetic implantation, the progression of peak and mean trans-prosthetic gradients during echocardiographic follow-up (mean 3.3 years) was equivalent between patients treated with and without LLT (peak increase: 0.9+/-7.7 vs 1.1+/-10.9 mmHg, LLT vs no LLT, P=0.87; mean increase: 0.8+/-4.1 vs 0.2+/-5.9 mmHg, LLT vs no LLT, P=0.38). The annualised linear rate of gradient progression following valve replacement was also similar between groups (peak increase per year: 2.0+/-12.1 vs 1.0+/-12.9 mmHg per year, LLT vs no LLT, P=0.52; mean increase per year: 0.5+/-2.2 vs 0.6+/-6.0 mmHg per year, LLT vs no LLT, P=0.94). The incidence of mild or greater aortic insufficiency on the most recent echocardiogram was comparable (16.3% vs 13.8%, LLT vs no LLT, P=0.44), and there was no difference in the 10-year freedom from re-operation for SVD between the two groups [98.9% (95% confidence interval (CI): 91.9%, 99.8%) vs 95.4% (95% CI 90.5%, 97.9%), LLT vs no LLT, P=0.72].",

In the present study, we investigated the effects of the R219K polymorphism of the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) gene on serum lipid levels and the response to statin therapy in Chinese patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). 2. The study population consisted of 365 patients with CHD and 246 control subjects without signs or symptoms of CHD. Patients with CHD were treated with 20 mg/day pravastatin. Fasting serum lipids were determined before and after 12 weeks of treatment. Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). 3. The R219K polymorphism of the ABCA1 gene was not significantly associated with CHD (P > 0.05). Compared with controls, patients with the RR genotype had significantly higher serum triglyceride levels and lower high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels than those with the KK genotype (P < 0.05). In addition, the effects of pravastatin in increasing HDL-C levels were significantly greater in patients with the KK genotype compared with those with the RR genotype (P < 0.05). 4. In conclusion, the R219K polymorphism of ABCA1 was associated with altered lipoprotein levels and the R219K variant significantly modulated the HDL-C response to pravastatin in Chinese patients with CHD.", 
    "16": "1. Previous studies have demonstrated that early statin therapy after acute coronary syndrome decreases inflammation and mortality rates. The dose-response relationship for atorvastatin in elderly patients with unstable angina (UA) during early hospitalization in terms of lowering inflammatory factors, improving vascular endothelium function and safety is unclear. 2. In the present study, 166 consecutive patients with UA who were >/= 60 years of age were randomly assigned, in a double-blind manner, to receive 80 or 20 mg/day atorvastatin. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, fibrinogen and lipid levels were measured at admission and 1, 2 and 8 weeks later. Vascular endothelial function was measured and the safety of the drug was monitored. 3. Levels of inflammatory factors were significantly lower in patients on 80 mg atorvastatin than in those on 20 mg atorvastatin at 2 and 8 weeks. Atorvastatin 80 mg not only resulted in a significant improvement in vascular endothelial function during early hospitalization for UA over that seen in patients on 20 mg atorvastatin, but also reduced lipid levels to a greater extent. At 8 weeks, almost all patients showed good tolerance of 80 mg/day atorvastatin. 4. The results of the present study indicate that intensive statin therapy with high-dose (80 mg/day) atorvastatin is more efficacious than and as safe as 20 mg/day atorvastatin when administered to elderly patients during early hospitalization for UA.", 
    "17": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common and life-threatening disease characterized by progressive dilatation and rupture, and has a mortality rate of up to 90%. Surgical repair is recommended for large aneurysms, whereas small aneurysms are managed by 'watchful waiting'. The recently introduced AAA screening programs reduce aneurysm-related mortality; however, aneurysm detection leads to psychological problems and a reduced quality of life of patients. The success of pharmacological therapy for AAA in small animals continues to provide insights into the pathogenetic mechanisms of this disease. As a result, medications, such as doxycycline, roxithromycin and statins, have been used to limit the growth of AAAs in small human studies with promising results. However, randomized trials with large numbers of patients and long follow-ups are required for the thorough investigation of safe and effective medical therapies. Control of cardiovascular risk factors, particularly smoking cessation, may result in a reduced growth of the AAA and improve overall patient care.", 
    "18": "In developed countries, cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death. Statins are abundantly prescribed to reduce the risk of coronary artery disease by lowering cholesterol. Genetic factors are thought to be partly responsible for the interindividual variation in the response to statins. This article reviews the most important studies conducted on pharmacogenetics of statins. Currently, there is no evidence to advocate pharmacogenetic testing before initiating therapy.", 
    "19": "Currently available modalities for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke are aimed at preserving or augmenting cerebral blood flow. Experimental evidence suggests that statins, which show 25-30% reduction of stroke incidence in clinical trials, confer stroke protection by upregulation of eNOS and increasing cerebral blood flow. The upregulation of eNOS by statins is mediated by inhibition of small GTP-binding protein RhoA. Our recent study uncovered a unique role for a Rho-family member Rac1 in stroke protection. Rac1 in endothelium does not affect cerebral blood flow. Instead, inhibition of endothelial Rac1 leads to broad upregulation of the genes relevant to neurovascular protection. Intriguingly, inhibition of endothelial Rac1 enhances neuronal cell survival through endothelium-derived neurotrophic factors, including artemin. This review discusses the emerging therapeutic opportunities to target neurovascular signaling beyond the BBB, with special emphasis on the novel role of endothelial Rac1 in stroke protection.", 
    "20": "In patients with native coronary artery disease, strong evidence supports the use of statins to reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events and improve survival. However, for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), statins appear to be underutilized, and concerns have been raised regarding their perioperative safety.", 
    "21": "The goal of this systematic review is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of statin therapy before and after coronary surgical revascularization.", 
    "22": "A systematic review was performed to retrieve relevant articles from the Medline database published between 1987 and January 2009.", 
    "23": "Administered before CABG, statins have been demonstrated to reduce perioperative mortality, stroke and atrial fibrillation. Preoperative statin therapy also reduces the systemic inflammatory response associated with cardiopulmonary bypass. Following CABG, statins inhibit saphenous vein graft disease and the progression of atherosclerosis in native coronary arteries. In addition, postoperative statins reduce the recurrence of cardiovascular events and improve all-cause mortality. High-intensity lipid reduction to achieve low-density lipoprotein levels to 70 mg/dl may benefit post-CABG patients, but this has yet to be evaluated prospectively. Adverse effects related to perioperative statin therapy seem to be extremely rare, and little data are available to support the practice of withholding statin therapy before or after surgery.", 
    "24": "Numerous studies have demonstrated that statins improve the outcomes of patients undergoing CABG. The benefits seem to outweigh the risks associated with their use, both in the preoperative and postoperative period. In the absence of contraindications, essentially all CABG patients are candidates for life-long statin therapy that ideally should be started before surgery. The optimal postoperative statin regimen remains unknown and should be the subject of future study.", 
    "25": "The human apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT; SLC10A2) is the primary mechanism for intestinal bile acid reabsorption. In the colon, secondary bile acids increase the risk of cancer. Therefore, drugs that inhibit ASBT have the potential to increase the risk of colon cancer. The objectives of this study were to identify FDA-approved drugs that inhibit ASBT and to derive computational models for ASBT inhibition. Inhibition was evaluated using ASBT-MDCK monolayers and taurocholate as the model substrate. Computational modeling employed a HipHop qualitative approach, a Hypogen quantitative approach, and a modified Laplacian Bayesian modeling method using 2D descriptors. Initially, 30 compounds were screened for ASBT inhibition. A qualitative pharmacophore was developed using the most potent 11 compounds and applied to search a drug database, yielding 58 hits. Additional compounds were tested, and their K(i) values were measured. A 3D-QSAR and a Bayesian model were developed using 38 molecules. The quantitative pharmacophore consisted of one hydrogen bond acceptor, three hydrophobic features, and five excluded volumes. Each model was further validated with two external test sets of 30 and 19 molecules. Validation analysis showed both models exhibited good predictability in determining whether a drug is a potent or nonpotent ASBT inhibitor. The Bayesian model correctly ranked the most active compounds. In summary, using a combined in vitro and computational approach, we found that many FDA-approved drugs from diverse classes, such as the dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and HMG CoA-reductase inhibitors, are ASBT inhibitors.",

Therefore, we wished to examine monocyte Hsp70 expression and induction in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and in healthy controls.", 
    "27": "We measured cellular Hsp70 levels in freshly isolated monocytes and released Hsp70 levels in plasma and monocyte culture supernatants, obtained from patients with PAD and from healthy controls. We assessed the effect of statin therapy on Hsp70 levels and examined monocyte cell survival in culture with and without immunological stress.", 
    "28": "Monocyte cellular Hsp70 was lower in patients with PAD compared to healthy controls (11.3 +/- 7.4 ng/10(6) cells vs 20.7 +/- 16.0 ng/10(6) cells; p < 0.001). Individuals on statin therapy from both PAD and control groups had lower monocyte Hsp70 compared to those not treated with statins. Concentrations of Hsp70 released into culture supernatants were not dependent on PAD or statin therapy. Cell survival was inversely associated with Hsp70 concentrations in culture supernatants but had no association with cellular concentrations of Hsp70.", 
    "29": "Cellular Hsp70 and released Hsp70 may play different roles in monocyte health. Whilst induced Hsp70 destined for release appears to be unaffected in PAD, mechanisms responsible for cellular retention of Hsp70 may provide an area for future therapeutic targets in vascular disease.",

Biomarkers of erythrocyte antioxidant activity included glutathione peroxidase-1 and superoxide dismutase. Exposures included outdoor home daily particle mass [particulate matter < 0.25, 0.25-2.5, and 2.5-10 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM(0.25), PM(0.25-2.5), PM(2.5-10))], and hourly elemental and black carbon (EC-BC), estimated primary and secondary organic carbon (OC(pri), SOC), particle number (PN), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides-nitrogen dioxide (NO(x)-NO(2)). We analyzed the relation of biomarkers to exposures with mixed effects models adjusted for potential confounders.", 
    "32": "Primary combustion markers (EC-BC, OC(pri), CO, NO(x)-NO(2)), but not SOC, were positively associated with inflammatory biomarkers and inversely associated with erythrocyte anti-oxidant enzymes (n = 578). PN and PM(0.25) were more strongly associated with biomarkers than PM(0.25-2.5). Associations for all exposures were stronger during cooler periods when only OC(pri), PN, and NO(x) were higher. We found weaker associations with statin (sTNF-RII, CRP) and clopidogrel use (sP-selectin).", 
    "33": "Traffic-related air pollutants are associated with increased systemic inflammation, increased platelet activation, and decreased erythrocyte antioxidant enzyme activity, which may be partly behind air pollutant-related increases in systemic inflammation.

Patients of the control group (n=12) received standard treatment. The index group of patients (n=11) received additionally 20 mg of simvastatin daily for 30 days. Levels of cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, number of venous circulating endothelial cells were measured in the peripheral blood. Outcomes were assessed using the modified Rankin scale. Patients with hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage had disturbances of lipid metabolism and signs of endothelial dysfunction which manifested itself in the reduction of endothelium-dependent vasolidation and increase of circulating endothelial cell number. The study showed that the use of simvastatin normalized the lipid blood spectrum, improved the endothelial function and decreased unfavorable outcomes by 22%.",

This constriction was reduced by endothelial removal or NOS inhibition in juvenile, but not weanling, arterioles. In contrast, this constriction was abolished by K(+) channel inhibition in weanling, but not juvenile, arterioles. The heme precursor delta-aminolevulinic acid constricted juvenile arterioles but did not affect weanling arterioles. The heme oxygenase inhibitor chromium (III) mesoporphyrin IX abolished the endothelium-dependent dilation of juvenile arterioles to simvastatin, and reduced ACh- and simvastatin-induced dilations of weanling arterioles.",

We undertook a retrospective cohort study of recipients of kidney, pancreas, and/or liver transplants with BSIs at a single center over an 11-year period. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression was used to determine independent predictors of 15-day mortality and clinical cure, with a focus on the use of statins. Three hundred and eleven recipients of solid-organ transplants had 604 episodes of BSI. Forty-four (14%) died within 15 days of BSI. Sixteen percent did not achieve clinical cure. In the multivariate model, each one point increase in the APACHE score was associated with a 1.09-fold increased risk of death (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.18, P = 0.03). The lack of appropriate antibiotic therapy was associated with a four-fold higher risk of death within 15 days (odds ratio [OR] 4.65, 95% CI 1.46-14.78, P = 0.009). Statin use was protective (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.04-0.78). Patients with high APACHE scores, nosocomial rather than community source of BSI, lack of appropriate antibiotic therapy, and mental status changes were less likely to achieve clinical cure of their BSIs.

Mechanistic and animal studies provide evidence both for and against a causal relationship of CRP with atherothrombosis. Human genetics demonstrate that genetic variation in the CRP gene is associated with lifelong increased CRP levels, but not with increased risk of atherothrombosis. A human intervention trial in healthy people with low LDL cholesterol and elevated CRP demonstrated that aggressive statin treatment caused reductions of 50% in LDL cholesterol, 37% in CRP, 50% in atherothrombotic cardiovascular events, 20% in total mortality, and 45% in venothrombotic events.

    "62": "To identify pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug interactions between tipranavir-ritonavir (TPV/r) and rosuvastatin and atorvastatin, we conducted two prospective, open-label, single-arm, two-period studies. The geometric mean (GM) ratio was 1.37 (90% confidence interval [CI], 1.15 to 1.62) for the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for rosuvastatin and 2.23 (90% CI, 1.83 to 2.72) for the maximum concentration of drug in serum (Cmax) for rosuvastatin with TPV/r at steady state versus alone. The GM ratio was 9.36 (90% CI, 8.02 to 10.94) for the AUC of atorvastatin and 8.61 (90% CI, 7.25 to 10.21) for the Cmax of atorvastatin with TPV/r at steady state versus alone. Tipranavir PK parameters were not affected by single-dose rosuvastatin or atorvastatin. Mild gastrointestinal intolerance, headache, and mild reversible liver enzyme elevations (grade 1 and 2) were the most commonly reported adverse drug reactions. Based on these interactions, we recommend low initial doses of rosuvastatin (5 mg) and atorvastatin (10 mg), with careful clinical monitoring of rosuvastatin- or atorvastatin-related adverse events when combined with TPV/r.",

Pigs then received intravenous lovastatin (100 microg/kg bolus+100 microg/kg/h infusion, n=6) or saline (n=11) before injury of the second carotid artery. Thrombus size was quantified by scintillation detection of autologous (111)In-platelets. Sequential carotid injury produced a thrombus more than 50% greater in volume in the second (3149+/-2053 x 10(6)/cm(2)) relative to the first injured artery (2081+/-1552 x 10(6)/cm(2); P=0.04) in control pigs. This augmentation was inhibited by intravenous lovastatin which acutely reduced platelet deposition (944+/-246 x 10(6)/cm(2)) relative to saline control (P=0.02). Flow chamber closure times increased on average by 2.45-fold in response to whole blood lovastatin incubation.

    "69": "Since co-administration of ezetimibe, a specific inhibitor of cholesterol absorption into the intestine, has been shown to augment lipid-lowering effects of statins, ezetimibe plus statins is a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of dyslipidemia in high-risk patients. Statins have been shown to ameliorate renal function and reduce proteinuria in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, effects of co-administration of ezetimibe with statins on renal damage and dysfunction in CKD patients remain unknown. In this study, we examined whether co-administration of ezetimibe with pitavastatin could augment renoprotective properties of pitavastatin in non-diabetic CKD patients with dyslipidemia. Total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides levels were reduced more by co-administration of ezetimibe (10mg/day) with pitavastatin (2mg/day) (n=10) than by pitavastatin alone (n=10). In addition, ezetimibe plus pitavastatin treatment produced significant incremental reduction in proteinuria related to pitavastatin therapy alone. In univariate analyses, proteinuria was correlated with plasma levels of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol (inversely), asymmetric dimethylarginine, an endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, and urinary excretion levels of L-fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP), a marker of tubular injury and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), an oxidative stress marker. Multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed that LDL-cholesterol (p<0.001) and urinary excretion levels of L-FABP (p=0.001) and 8-OHdG (p<0.001) were independently related to proteinuria (R(2)=0.969). Our present study demonstrated for the first time that co-administration of ezetimibe enhanced proteinuria-lowering effects of pitavastatin in non-diabetic CKD patients partly via a cholesterol-independent manner. Ezetimibe may have pleiotropic actions that could contribute to renoprotective properties of this lipid-lowering agent.", 
    "70": "In this study, we investigated the effects of statins, fibrates, 9-cis-retinoic acid and forskolin on the transcription of the mitochondrial carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier (CAC) gene. Statins, fibrates, retinoic acid and forskolin activate luciferase gene reporter activity driven by the -334/+3 bp region of the human CAC promoter containing wild-type (but not mutated) PPRE. These four agents also increase CAC transcript and protein levels. The combinations of statins and fibrates, retinoic acid and fibrates and fibrates and forskolin act synergistically. Mevalonate abolishes the activation of CAC gene expression by statins; the inhibitor of the PKA pathway H89 suppresses the stimulation of CAC gene expression by forskolin. Because CAC is essential for fatty acid beta-oxidation, the above results on the regulation of CAC gene expression provide a novel contribution to the understanding of the hypolipidemic action of statins, fibrates and retinoic acid.",

Median CK-MB peak after PCI was 2.10 ng/ml (interquartile range 1.00 to 12.50 ng/ml) in the atorvastatin group and 3.20 ng/ml (interquartile range 1.37 to 16.07 ng/ml) in the control group (p = 0.014). The incidence of cardiac troponin I elevation >3x ULN was 26.6% in the atorvastatin group and 39.1% in the control group (odds ratio: 0.56; 95% confidence interval: 0.40 to 0.78; p < 0.001).",

Herein we evaluated the neuroprotective effect of different doses and duration of Sim treatment and further addressed its mechanism of action. Neonatal rats were subjected to occlusion of the right carotid artery followed by 2.5 h hypoxia (hypoxia-ischemia, HI). Sim was given at the dose of 10 or 5 mg/kg, s.c. from postnatal day 1 (PN1) to PN7, or at 20 mg/kg from PN4 to PN7, or at 20 mg/kg in a single administration 18 h before the onset of the ischemic procedure. Low-dose treatments or a single administration of the drug were effective in reducing HI-induced brain damage and its behavioural outcomes. Sim increased both Akt and CREB phosphorylation in neuronal cells and treatment with wortmannin completely blocked neuroprotection and p-Akt. These data demonstrate that even a single prophylactic Sim administration protects from hypoxic ischemic brain damage and that neuroprotection is in part obtained by preserving Akt and stimulating CREB phosphorylation in neuronal cells. Prophylactic Sim administration set in motion biochemical events that are known to increase brain tolerance to harmful factors, suggesting that the drug may exert neuroprotection by inducing pharmacological preconditioning.", 
    "77": "Several retrospective and nonrandomized studies have indicated that lowering atherogenic lipoprotein, in particular low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, may retard the hemodynamic progression of aortic stenosis (AS). This valvular disease shares pathogenic and pathoanatomic similarities with atherosclerosis, at least in their early developments. Two randomized placebo-controlled studies researching the effect of lowering low-density lipoprotein on AS progression and its clinical consequences have been published recently-the Scottish Aortic Stenosis and Lipid Lowering Trial, Impact on Regression (SALTIRE) study and the Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis (SEAS) study. Both of these studies had neutral outcomes. The causes for the negative outcome may be that cholesterol lowering does not influence AS development in a clinically significant way or it may be due to traits in the design of the studies or treatments. Therefore, statin treatment for prevention of AS progression cannot be ruled out as a future therapeutic option in AS. The outcome of the ongoing Aortic Stenosis Progression Observation: Measuring Effects of Rosuvastatin (ASTRONOMER) study, which is examining lipid lowering as a treatment for AS, is greatly anticipated.", 
    "78": "Hypercholesterolemia is a risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD), CAD mortality, and incident heart failure (HF). Lipid-lowering therapy with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) has been shown to reduce the risk of developing HF in patients with CAD. However, in patients with chronic established HF, hypercholesterolemia has not been associated with an increased risk of mortality. Several studies have demonstrated that higher lipid and lipoprotein levels, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides, are associated with significantly improved outcomes in HF of both ischemic and nonischemic etiologies. In light of the association between high cholesterol levels and improved survival in HF, statin or other lipid-lowering therapy in HF remains controversial. To date, large outcome trials of statin therapy in HF of multiple etiologies have not demonstrated mortality benefit.", 
    "79": "Fluvastatin has been considered to be metabolised to 5-hydroxy fluvastatin (M-2), 6-hydroxy fluvastatin (M-3) and N-desisopropyl fluvastatin (M-5) in human liver microsomes by primarily CYP2C9. To elucidate the contribution of different CYP enzymes on fluvastatin metabolism, we examined the effect of CYP inhibitors and CYP2C-specific monoclonal antibodies on the formation of fluvastatin metabolites in human liver microsomes. Human liver microsomes were incubated with fluvastatin with or without pre-treatment with CYP inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies. Selective inhibitors of CYP2C9 (sulfaphenazole), CYP3A (ketoconazole) and CYP2C8 (quercetin) were employed and monoclonal antibodies were against CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2C8/9/18/19. According to the amount of fluvastatin metabolites produced, the formation of M-3 was found to be major pathway of fluvastatin metabolism (the relative contribution was calculated to be more than 80%). Sulfaphenazole inhibited the formation of M-2 largely, but had little effect on the formation of M-3. It also inhibited the formation of M-5. Ketoconazole markedly inhibited the formation of M-3, but did not inhibit the formation of M-2 and M-5. Quercetin had a moderate inhibitory effect on the formation of all three fluvastatin metabolites. Monoclonal antibodies against CYP2C9 and CYP2C8/9/18/19 markedly inhibited the formation of M-2 and M-5. None of monoclonal antibodies showed clear inhibition on the formation of M-3. In contrast to previous published work, our results suggest that M-2 and M-5 are formed preferentially by CYP2C9, and that M-3 is mainly formed by CYP3A. In summary, the results contribute to a better understanding of the drug-drug interaction potential for fluvastatin in vivo.", 
    "80": "Statins, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA are best known for their lipid-lowering effects but they also possess immunomodulatory properties that are, at least in part, independent of changes in serum cholesterol. Some recent clinical trials (eg. PROVE-IT) have shown that statins exert beneficial cardiovascular effects independently of the resultant level of LDL cholesterol. These \"pleiotropic\" effects seem to be due to inhibition of prenylation of several proteins such as the small GTP-binding proteins Ras and Rho, and to the disruption, or depletion, of cholesterol rich membrane micro-domains (membrane rafts). Through these pathways statins are able to modulate immune responses by modulating cytokine levels and by affecting the function of cells involved in both innate and adaptive responses. Over the past decade, a large number of studies reported a prominent role of inflammation and immune response in atherosclerosis, thus, the ability of statins to modulate immune-inflammatory processes could explain their cardiovascular beneficial effects beyond lipid-lowering effects. Moreover, various studies demonstrated beneficial effects of statins in inflammatory and auto-immune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and others. The purpose of this review is to summarize clinical and experimental evidence of immunomodulatory properties of these drugs, highlighting their clinical and, thus, therapeutic implications.", 
    "81": "Statins, beyond their lipid lowering properties, have pleiotropic properties that may modulate the inflammatory cascade and potentially could be useful in the management of inflammatory conditions such as bacteremia and sepsis. In this article, we aimed to review significant patents and available evidence regarding the anti-inflammatory characteristics of these agents and their role in the clinical outcome of inflammatory conditions. Several studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of prior use of statins in the development and the progression of bacteremia, sepsis and pneumonia and there is evidence supporting that the use of statins may be associated with a decreased hospital mortality caused by the above disorders. These investigations also suggest that these agents are infrequently associated with adverse events and are generally safe and well tolerated. However, it should be underlined that these data come mainly from observational retrospective investigations and randomized prospective studies are warranted to confirm these encouraging results.",

Nitric oxide radicals, NADPF-diaphorase, nitrate reductase, acetylcholinesterase enzymes, as well as total cholesterol, triglycerides, HD, LD, VLD lipoproteins concentration were assessed initially and after three month treatment. It was revealed that the treatment with statins taking into account types of dislipidemia could have an additional renoprotective effect in the patients with different types of chronic glomerular disease.", 
    "83": "A fast and novel sample preparation procedure: ultrasound assisted ionic liquid (IL) dispersive liquid extraction for the concentration of lovastatin and simvastatin in aqueous samples was developed. An IL ([C(6)MIM][PF(6)]) was used as the extraction solvent, and the factors affecting the extraction efficiency such as initial temperature, the volume of IL, pH of water samples, cooling time, and salt concentration were optimized. In combination with HPLC-UV, both lovastatin and simvastatin exhibited a good linear range of 1-100 ng/mL. The limits of detection (LODs) of lovastatin and simvastatin were 0.17 and 0.29 ng/mL, respectively. Precisions of the proposed method (RSDs, n = 9) were 4.12 and 4.52%, respectively. This method has been successfully applied for the analysis of target compounds in three real water samples and good spiking recoveries were obtained in the range of 90.0-102.2% for lovastatin and 80.5-112.0% for simvastatin. These results indicated that ultrasound assisted IL dispersive liquid phase extraction would have good application prospect in the pretreatment of environmental samples.",

    "89": "Ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) was investigated as a faster alternative to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for the simultaneous analysis of drugs usually prescribed in cardiovascular therapy. Upon a previously developed and validated solid phase extraction (SPE)-HPLC-photodiode array (PDA)-fluorescence (FLR) method, separation of chlorthalidone (CLTD; diuretic), valsartan and its metabolite (VAL and VAL-M1 respectively; angiotensin II receptor antagonist drugs) and fluvastatin (FLUV; statin) was performed in human plasma using an RP C18 column (50mmx2.1mm, 1.7microm, Waters Acquity UPLC (BEH)) and a tunable UV-vis (TUV) detector. After method transfer, different system variables were modulated to study the evolution of responses of the analytes and the endogenous interferences. The improved method was fully validated and the results were compared with its precursor HPLC method relating to analysis time, efficiency and sensitivity. The studied compounds were separated in less than 8min and the method showed good linearity (20-3000microg/L for chlorthalidone, 110-1100microg/L for valsartan-M1, 67-1900microg/L for valsartan and 48-1100microg/L for fluvastatin), precision and accuracy. The proposed method was found to be reproducible (RSD<10%), accurate (RE<15%), robust and suitable for quantitative analysis of the studied drugs in plasma obtained from patients under combined cardiovascular treatment.", 
    "90": "Guidelines have recommended non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol as a secondary target for therapy after the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goals have been met in patients with hypertriglyceridemia; non-HDL cholesterol is viewed as a surrogate for apolipoprotein (Apo)B, an alternate end point of treatment. The present analysis of the previously reported Simvastatin plus Fenofibrate for Combined Hyperlipidemia (SAFARI) trial assessed the associations of non-HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol with ApoB levels in patients with combined hyperlipidemia treated with combination simvastatin (20 mg) and fenofibrate (160 mg) or simvastatin monotherapy (20 mg). The correlations of these factors were analyzed in the overall modified intent-to-treat population (n = 594) and in patient subgroups stratified by triglyceride (TG) tertiles. Simvastatin plus fenofibrate and simvastatin alone significantly reduced LDL cholesterol, TG, non-HDL cholesterol and ApoB levels and non-HDL cholesterol/ApoB ratio (p < or =0.0004), regardless of the TG level. The greatest reductions occurred with combination treatment. The baseline levels of non-HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol correlated highly with ApoB and were stronger in the lower TG tertiles than in the higher TG tertiles. After 12 weeks, the correlations had changed little with simvastatin monotherapy but had increased substantially with combination therapy and were most improved at high TG levels. In conclusion, these results suggest that both non-HDL cholesterol and ApoB provide similar information in relation to treatment response in patients with combined hyperlipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia, and that non-HDL cholesterol is a good indicator of ApoB-containing lipoproteins, supporting its recommended use as a secondary therapeutic target in these patients.", 
    "91": "Contrast-induced nephropathy limits the outcomes of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The present study compared the protective effects of different statin doses on renal function. A total of 228 patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing selective PCI were randomly divided into simvastatin 20-mg group (S20, n = 115) and simvastatin 80-mg group (S80, n = 113). Serum creatinine was measured at admission, the day of PCI, and 24 and 48 hours after PCI. The creatinine clearance was calculated using the Cochcroft-Gault formula. High-sensitive C-reactive protein, P-selectin, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 were also measured before and after the procedure. Contrast-induced nephropathy was defined as a postprocedure increase in serum creatinine of > or =0.5 mg/dl or >25% from baseline. The serum creatinine significantly increased after PCI, with the peak value occurring at 24 hours, and then began to decrease. At 48 hours, the serum creatinine had decreased to the baseline level in the S80 group, but it had failed to do so in the S20 group. At 24 and 48 hours after PCI, the serum creatinine was lower in the S80 group than in the S20 group (p <0.05 and p <0.001, respectively). The creatinine clearance significantly decreased after PCI, with the lowest value occurring at 24 hours, and then it began to increase. In the S80 group, the creatinine clearance recovered to baseline level at 48 hours, but it failed to do so in the S20 group. The creatinine clearance was greater at 24 and 48 hours in the S80 group than that in the S20 group. Although the procedure caused a significant increase in high-sensitive C-reactive protein, P-selectin, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 levels, the value was lower in the S80 group than in the S20 group (p <0.001). In conclusion, pretreatment with simvastatin 80 mg before PCI could further decrease the occurrence of contrast-induced nephropathy compared with simvastatin 20 mg. This benefit was associated with the lowering of high-sensitive C-reactive protein, P-selectin, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 levels.", 
    "92": "The purpose of this study was to clarify the relation between differential leukocyte counts and inhibition of the development of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with coronary artery disease. A 6-month prospective study was conducted in 84 patients treated with pravastatin. Plaque volume, as assessed by volumetric analysis using intravascular ultrasound, decreased significantly by 12.6% (p <0.0001 vs baseline) after treatment; furthermore, a corresponding decrease of total leukocyte count (8.9%, p <0.01 vs baseline) was seen. Change in plaque volume was correlated with changes in monocyte (r = 0.35, p = 0.002) and lymphocyte (r = 0.25, p = 0.03) counts but not with changes in neutrophil, eosinophil, or basophil counts. In a multivariate regression analysis with changes in serum lipids, traditional risk factors, and medications as covariates, the decrease in monocyte count was identified as an independent predictor of coronary plaque regression (beta coefficient 0.313, 95% confidence interval 0.089 to 0.353, p = 0.0014). No correlation was found between change in monocyte count and changes in any other lipid levels. This study demonstrated that monocyte count was the only leukocyte type significantly and independently associated with coronary atherosclerotic regression, even after adjustment for changes in any lipid levels. In conclusion, the decrease in monocyte count as a nonlipid-lowering effect of statins may be used as a novel marker of coronary atherosclerotic regression.", 
    "93": "We determined the ability of in-trial measurements of triglycerides (TGs) to predict new cardiovascular events (CVEs) using data from the Incremental Decrease in End Points through Aggressive Lipid Lowering (IDEAL) and Treating to New Targets (TNT) trials. The trials compared atorvastatin 80 mg/day with moderate-dose statin therapy (simvastatin 20 to 40 mg/day in IDEAL and atorvastatin 10 mg/day in TNT) in patients with clinically evident coronary heart disease or a history of myocardial infarction. The outcome measurement in the present research was CVE occurring after the first year of the trial. After adjusting for age, gender, and study, risk of CVEs increased with increasing TGs (p <0.001 for trend across quintiles of TGs). Patients in the highest quintile had a 63% higher rate of CVEs than patients in the lowest quintile (hazard ratio 1.63, 95% confidence interval 1.46 to 1.81) and the relation of TGs to risk was apparent even within the normal range of TGs. The ability of TG measurements to predict risk decreased when high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B:apolipoprotein A-1 were included in the statistical analysis, and it was abolished with inclusion of further variables (diabetes, body mass index, glucose, hypertension, and smoking; (p = 0.044 and 0.621, respectively, for trend across quintiles of TGs). Similar results were obtained in patients in whom low-density lipoprotein cholesterol had been lowered to guideline-recommended levels. In conclusion, even slightly increased TG levels are associated with higher risk of recurrence of CVEs in statin-treated patients and should be considered a useful marker of risk.", 
    "94": "Doxorubicin is known to have cumulative dose-dependent cardiotoxicity, and a tumor suppressor protein p53 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. However, how p53 is induced by doxorubicin and mediates the cardiotoxic effects of doxorubicin remains elusive. In cultured cardiac myocytes, doxorubicin induced oxidative stress, DNA damage, ATM activation, and p53 induction. A free radical scavenger NAC attenuated all of these events, whereas an ATM kinase inhibitor wortmannin attenuated doxorubicin-induced ATM activation and p53 induction but not oxidative stress. Doxorubicin treatment in vivo also induced oxidative stress, DNA damage, ATM activation, and p53 accumulation. These observations suggest that p53 induction by doxorubicin is mediated by oxidative DNA damage-ATM pathway. Doxorubicin-induced contractile dysfunction and myocyte apoptosis in vivo were attenuated in heterozygous p53 deficient mice and cardiac-restricted Bcl-2 transgenic mice, suggesting that myocyte apoptosis plays a central role downstream of p53 in doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. We also tested whether pitavastatin exerts protective effects on doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. Pitavastatin attenuated doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress, DNA damage, ATM activation, p53 accumulation, and apoptosis in vitro. Pitavastatin also attenuated myocyte apoptosis and contractile dysfunction in vivo. The beneficial effects of pitavastatin were reversed by intermediate products of the mevalonate pathway that are required for the activation of Rac1, and Rac1 inhibitor exhibited cardioprotective effects comparable to those of pitavastatin. These data collectively suggest that doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity is mediated by oxidative DNA damage-ATM-p53-apoptosis pathway, and is attenuated by pitavastatin through its antioxidant effect involving Rac1 inhibition.",

Furthermore, accumulation of macrophages and neutrophils and increases in tumour necrosis factor-alpha concentration in BAL fluid were inhibited by simvastatin. Simultaneously, the expression of RhoA and the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 in lungs exposed to cigarette smoke were inhibited during simvastatin administration. However, the increased expression of Smad2 and Smad3 proteins and the decreased level of Smad7 protein in remodelled lungs were not affected by simvastatin.",

Simvastatin may inhibit cigarette smoke-induced small airway remodelling by reducing growth factor expression and inflammation. The mechanism of action of simvastatin on small airway remodelling involved RhoA and the Smad signalling pathway. These findings indicate that simvastatin may have potential beneficial effects in the treatment of COPD.", 
    "99": "3-Hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are some of the most commonly prescribed drugs in the world. While lipid modification remains the primary function of statins, there has been increasing interest in its potential pleiotropic effects, particularly as an anti-inflammatory agent in its role as an antiarrhythmic. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice and carries with it a significant burden in both morbidity and mortality. Treatment for AF currently involves either rate or rhythm control where both have demonstrable associated risks. Rate control necessitates anticoagulation, which can cause life-threatening bleeding, while rhythm control has a poor side-effect profile that may lead to greater mortality and may not completely eliminate the need for anticoagulation. Considering this pressing need for novel therapeutic interventions in AF, this long overdue systematic review explores the potential role of statins in the treatment and prevention of AF. Physicians, especially cardiologists, need to be aware of the host of currently available literature and, more importantly, need to be stimulated to generate discussion and formulate studies that will help debate the issues under the most erudite standards.", 
    "100": "Clostridium difficile associated disease (CDAD), a common type of antibiotic associated diarrhea, is increasing in frequency and affecting patients outside of traditional populations. At one time CDAD exclusively occurred in hospitalized patients or frail elderly patients receiving antibiotic therapy. It is now occurring more commonly in younger patients who are relatively healthy and may not be receiving antibiotics. Co-factors that might explain this increase incidence and changing demographic are of great public health interest. Recent investigations have identified gastric acid suppression, particularly via proton pump inhibitors, as a risk factor for the development of CDAD by mechanisms which are not entirely clear. C. difficile toxin comes as two major forms that are closely related, toxin A and toxin B and both are able to produce CDAD. These toxins have a glucosyltransferase domain that glucosylates actived Rho, a small GTP binding protein involved in multiple cellular signaling pathways. Glucosylation inactivates Rho and modifies cell cycle, cytoskeletal and inflammatory pathways. The lipid lowering drugs called statins also inhibit Rho but at an earlier step in the Rho pathway. Statins inhibit the isoprenylation of Rho and therefore inhibits membrane anchoring a key step in Rho signaling. We propose that statins potentiate C. difficile toxin effects on colonic epithelium which leads to an increased risk of CDAD. We present preliminary data from a retrospective cohort which demonstrated an increased rate of CDAD in patients receiving statins compared to non-statin controls. The weight of the evidence leads to our hypothesis that statins interact with C difficile toxin A and B causing an increase in the rate and severity of CDAD.",

However, despite extensive efforts to implement high quality care both service provision and patient health outcomes remain sub-optimal. Several recent studies suggest that psychological theories about individuals' behaviour can provide a valuable framework for understanding generalisable factors underlying health professionals' clinical behaviour. In the context of the team management of chronic disease such as diabetes, however, the application of such models is less well established. The aim of this study was to identify motivational factors underlying health professional teams' clinical management of diabetes using a psychological model of human behaviour.",

Behavioural data were practice-level patient-reported rates of foot examination and use of statin medication. Relationships between the cognitive antecedents of behaviour proposed by the TPB and healthcare teams' clinical behaviour were explored using multiple regression.", 
    "103": "In both countries, attitude and subjective norm were important predictors of health professionals' intention to inspect feet (Attitude: beta = .40; Subjective Norm: beta = .28; Adjusted R2 = .34, p < 0.01), and their intention to prescribe statins (Attitude: beta = .44; Adjusted R2 = .40, p < 0.01). Individuals' self-reported intention did not predict practice-level performance of either clinical behaviour.",

However, we did not observe a relationship between health professionals' intentions and our proxy measure of team behaviour.

In order to investigate clinical behaviours performed by teams it may be necessary to develop measures that reflect the collective cognitions of the members of the team to facilitate the application of these theoretical models to team behaviours.",

Med. 359, 2195-2207 (2008). The Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) randomized nearly 18,000 subjects with no history of cardiovascular disease and an average or low LDLcholesterol level (<3.4 mmol/l), but a high plasma level of C-reactive protein (CRP; >2 mg/dl), to rosuvastatin 20 mg or placebo daily. The trial was stopped early because of a highly statistically significant 46% reduction in cardiovascular events for patients randomized to rosuvastatin. Participants who achieved an LDL-cholesterol level lower than 1.8 mmol/l and a CRP level lower than 2 mg/dl on treatment had the greatest decrease in cardiovascular risk. The JUPITER trial provides evidence that the benefits of statins relate in part to decreased inflammation. Comparison with other statin trials indicates that absolute cardiovascular risk is an important predictor of benefit from statin treatment, and potent statins that result in a greater percentage reduction in LDLcholesterol and CRP are likely to reduce risk more. Targeting statin treatment based on LDL-cholesterol alone will not provide an optimal risk reduction for many individuals.",

The optimized parameters gave maximum compactin production of 850 mug/gds as compared with 678 mug/gds before optimization. Statistical study was performed to further improve the production and develop a robust model. An improved yield of 950 mug/gds was obtained using the conditions proposed by the experimental model. The present study emphasizes the importance of precultural and nutritional parameters on the production of compactin, and further confirms the usefulness of solid-state fermentation for the production of industrially important secondary metabolites.

    "166": "A loss of synapses is characteristic of the early stages of the prion diseases. Here we modelled the synapse damage that occurs in prion diseases by measuring the amount of synaptophysin, a pre-synaptic membrane protein essential for neurotransmission, in cortical or hippocampal neurones incubated with the disease associated isoform of the prion protein (PrP(Sc)), or with the prion-derived peptide PrP82-146. The addition of PrP(Sc) or PrP82-146 caused a dose-dependent reduction in the synaptophysin content of PrP wildtype neurones indicative of synapse damage. They did not affect the synaptophysin content of PrP null neurones. The loss of synaptophysin in PrP wildtype neurones was preceded by the accumulation of PrP82-146 within synapses. Since supplements containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are frequently taken for their perceived health benefits including reported amelioration of neurodegenerative conditions, the effects of some common PUFA on prion-mediated synapse damage were examined. Pre-treatment of cortical or hippocampal neurones with docosahexaenoic (DHA) or eicosapentaenoic acids (EPA) protected neurones against the loss of synaptophysin induced by PrP82-146 or PrP(Sc). This effect of DHA and EPA was selective as they did not alter the loss of synaptophysin induced by a snakevenom neurotoxin. The effects of DHA and EPA were associated with a significant reduction in the amount of FITC-PrP82-146 that accumulated within synapses. Such observations raise the possibility that supplements containing PUFA may protect against the synapse damage and cognitive loss seen during the early stages of prion diseases.",

We hypothesized that statin might reduce AGEs-induced intracellular ROS of VSMCs and analyzed the possible mechanism of action of statin in AGEs-induced cellular signaling. Aortic smooth muscle cell of Sprague-Dawley rat (RASMC) culture was done using the different levels of AGEs stimulation in the presence or absence of statin. The proliferation of RASMC, ROS formation and cellular signaling was evaluated and neointimal formation after balloon injury in diabetic rats was analyzed. Increasing concentration of AGEs stimulation was associated with increased RASMC proliferation and increased ROS formation and they were decreased with statin in a dose-dependent manner. Increased NF-kappaB p65, phosphorylated ERK, phosphorylated p38 MAPK, cyclooxygenase-2, and c-jun by AGEs stimulation were noted and their expression was inhibited by statin. Neointimal formation after balloon injury was much thicker in diabetic rats than the sham-treated group but less neointimal growth was observed in those treated with statin after balloon injury. Increased ROS formation, subsequent activation of MAPK system and increased VSMC proliferation may be possible mechanisms of diabetic vasculopathy induced by AGEs and statin may play a key role in the treatment of AGEs-induced diabetic atherosclerosis.",

In our previous studies, rhein was shown to be effective in ameliorating diabetic renal pathological changes and attenuating hyperlipidemia. Statins have also been proven to ameliorate renal pathological changes associated with diabetic nephropathy (DN) through lipid-dependent and -independent mechanisms. We here study the protective and regulatory effects of rhein on renal injury and dyslipidemia in db/db mice with DN, using simvastatin as the control, and provide information on the mechanisms by which rhein protects against renal damage from DN. The results indicated that urinary albumin excretion (UAE) was reduced after 8 weeks of treatment in the rhein group, and 12 weeks in the simvastatin group. The morphometric analysis revealed that levels of extracellular matrix (ECM) significantly decreased in the rhein group after the full treatment course, but not in the simvastatin group. The more powerful effects of rhein on decreasing transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and fibronectin immunohistochemistry expression in renal tissue were also observed. And the plasma levels of cholesterol (Chol), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and ApoE all decreased in both the rhein and the simvastatin groups. Together, our data suggested that both rhein and simvastatin regulate dyslipidemia. The powerful effect of rhein in renal protection is due to its widespread effects. Rhein is a new drug that can decrease lipid levels and protect against DN progression in a different fashion with simvastatin.", 
    "203": "This paper analyses (1) the impact of the inclusion of statins in the German reference pricing scheme in 2005 on the statin market, and (2) the effect of switching behaviour subsequent to the policy change on healthcare utilisation and costs. Patients with prescriptions for statins in 2004 were observed for 1 year before and 1 year after the policy change, which went into effect on 1 January 2005. Data on outpatient and inpatient visits, pharmaceutical consumption, and cost to the sickness fund were collected from a sickness fund with more than 5.8 million insured members in 2005. Compared to patients who were not affected by the policy change, patients treated previously with atorvastatin experienced higher non-adherence and increased discontinuation of treatment (P < 0.0001). Compared to patients who continued treatment with atorvastatin (non-switchers), patients who switched to another statin were hospitalised more often (P = 0.0439). However, difference-in-differences in hospitalisation due to coronary heart disease (P = 0.8751) and emergency visits (P = 0.5624) did not differ significantly between the two groups. Patients who switched more than once experienced a significant increase in hospital visits (P = 0.0061) and hospital visits due to cardiovascular disease (P = 0.0096) compared to non-switchers. Difference-in-differences in outpatient healthcare utilisation did not differ between non-switchers and switchers. Total savings resulting from the policy change ranged from <euro> 94.4 million to <euro> 108.7 million. Although manufacturers usually comply with reference pricing by reducing their retail prices to the reference price, regulators have to be aware of the consequences in cases where manufacturers react as in this situation.", 
    "204": "We investigated the neuroprotective effect of atorvastatin in combination with delayed thrombolytic therapy in a rat model of embolic stroke. Rats subjected to embolic middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion were treated with atorvastatin at 4 h, followed by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) at 6 or 8 h after stroke. The combination of atorvastatin at 4 h and tPA at 6 h significantly decreased the size of the embolus at the origin of the MCA, improved microvascular patency, and reduced infarct volume, but did not increase the incidence of hemorrhagic transformation compared with vehicle-treated control animals. However, monotherapy with tPA at 6 h increased the incidence of hemorrhagic transformation and failed to reduce infarct volume compared with the control group. In addition, adjuvant treatment with atorvastatin at 4 h and with tPA at 6 h reduced tPA-induced upregulation of protease-activated receptor-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and matrix metalloproteinase-9, and concomitantly reduced cerebral microvascular platelet, neutrophil, and fibrin deposition compared with rats treated with tPA alone at 6 h. In conclusion, a combination of atorvastatin and tPA extended the therapeutic window for stroke to 6 h without increasing the incidence of hemorrhagic transformation. Atorvastatin blocked delayed tPA-potentiated adverse cerebral vascular events, which likely contributes to the neuroprotective effect of the combination therapy.",

    "209": "Sterol-accelerated degradation of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase is one of several mechanisms through which cholesterol synthesis is controlled in mammalian cells. This degradation results from sterol-induced binding of the membrane domain of reductase to endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins called Insig-1 and Insig-2, which are carriers of a ubiquitin ligase called gp78. The ensuing gp78-mediated ubiquitination of reductase is a prerequisite for its rapid, 26 S proteasome-mediated degradation from endoplasmic reticulum membranes, a reaction that slows a rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis. Here, we report that the membrane domain of hamster reductase is subject to sterol-accelerated degradation in Drosophila S2 cells, but only when mammalian Insig-1 or Insig-2 are co-expressed. This degradation mimics the reaction that occurs in mammalian cells with regard to its absolute requirement for the action of Insigs, sensitivity to proteasome inhibition, augmentation by nonsterol isoprenoids, and sterol specificity. RNA interference studies reveal that this degradation requires the Drosophila Hrd1 ubiquitin ligase and several other proteins, including a putative substrate selector, which associate with the enzyme in yeast and mammalian systems. These studies define Insigs as the minimal requirement for sterol-accelerated degradation of the membrane domain of reductase in Drosophila S2 cells."
