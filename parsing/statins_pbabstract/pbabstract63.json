Using the basic description method and association rules to analysis the data. By analysis the data we found that the average age of cerebral infarction patients who used Shuxuening injection is 67.96, 83.94% of patients were aged 46-80. The injection is administered intravenously,with most patients receiving a dosage of 15-20 mL per dose for between 1 and 14 days. It is always combined with aspirin (48.508%), cinepazide maleate injection (22.073%), atorvastatin calcium tablets (18.873%) in clinical practice. When it comes to two drug combinations, it always combined with cinepazide maleate injection and aspirin (8.178%), nicergoline capsules and aspirin (7.63%). Therefore, based on existing data, we give the conclusion that for the treatment of cerebral infarction Shuxuening injection is mainly used for older patients, and is often combination with similar pharmacological effects chemical drugs, which is complied with the guidelines. However, the wrong dose is still exist, doctors should realize the hiding risk.",

Our objective was to investigate the relationship between lipid and non-lipid biomarkers levels achieved during statin therapy and the incidence of MCVEs in patients with stable coronary heart disease (CHD). We conducted a substudy of the TNT (Treating to New Targets) study, which was a randomized trial that compared the efficacy of high (80 mg) versus low (10 mg) dose atorvastatin for the secondary prevention of CHD. Fasting plasma levels of standard lipids and of 18 non-lipid biomarkers were obtained after an 8-week run-in period on atorvastatin 10 mg in 157 patients who experienced MCVEs during the 4.9 years of study follow-up and in 1349 controls. MCVE was defined as CHD death, nonfatal, non-procedure-related myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and fatal or nonfatal stroke. After adjusting for age, sex and treatment arm, plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), insulin, neopterin, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], and the soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE) were predictive of recurrent MCVEs (P \u2264 0.02 for each doubling of plasma concentration). However, no significant association was observed between the risk of recurrent MCVEs and plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, adiponectin, cystatin C, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, matrix metalloproteinase-9, myeloperoxidase, osteopontin, soluble CD40 ligand, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, or soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. After further adjustment for diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and BMI, the relationship between hsCRP, insulin and MCVE were no longer significant, while the relationship between Lp(a), neopterin, NT-proBNP and sRAGE and MCVE remained statistically significant. In conclusion, in patients with CHD treated with atorvastatin, plasma levels of Lp(a), neopterin, NT-proBNP, and sRAGE are associated with the risk of recurrent MCVEs.",

    "12": "The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) is an important regulator of lipid and glucose metabolism, and its activation is reported to suppress the progression of atherosclerosis. We have reported that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) activate PPAR\u03b3 in macrophages. However, it is not yet known whether statins activate PPAR\u03b3 in other vascular cells. In the present study, we investigated whether statins activate PPAR\u03b3 in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) and thus mediate anti-atherosclerotic effects. Human aortic SMCs (HASMCs) and human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) were used in this study. Fluvastatin and pitavastatin activated PPAR\u03b3 in HASMCs, but not in HUVECs. Statins induced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in HASMCs, but not in HUVECs. Moreover, treatment with COX-2-siRNA abrogated statin-mediated PPAR\u03b3 activation in HASMCs. Statins suppressed migration and proliferation of HASMCs, and inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) in HASMCs. These effects of statins were abrogated by treatment with PPAR\u03b3-siRNA. Treatment with statins suppressed atherosclerotic lesion formation in Apoe(-/-) mice. In addition, transcriptional activity of PPAR\u03b3 and CD36 expression were increased, and the expression of MCP-1 and TNF-\u03b1 was decreased, in the aorta of statin-treated Apoe(-/-) mice. In conclusion, statins mediate anti-atherogenic effects through PPAR\u03b3 activation in SMCs. These effects of statins on SMCs may be beneficial for the prevention of atherosclerosis.",

Drug-mediated quantitative and qualitative HDL modifications could be involved in these negative results. To evaluate the quantitative and qualitative effects of niacin and fenofibrate on HDL in patients with type 2 diabetes, a prospective, randomised controlled intervention trial was conducted. Thirty type 2 diabetic patients with low HDL were randomised to receive either fenofibrate (FFB) or niacin\u00a0+\u00a0laropiprant (ERN/LPR) as an add-on to simvastatin treatment for 12 weeks according to a crossover design. At the basal point and after each intervention period, physical examinations and comprehensive standard biochemical determinations and HDL metabolomics were performed. Thirty nondiabetic patients with normal HDL were used as a basal control group. ERN/LRP, but not FFB, significantly increased HDL cholesterol. Neither ERN/LRP nor FFB reversed the HDL particle size or particle number to normal. ERN/LRP increased apoA-I but not apoA-II, whereas FFB produced the opposite effect. FFB significantly increased Pre\u03b21-HDL, whereas ERN/LRP tended to lower Pre\u03b21-HDL. CETP and LCAT activities were significantly decreased only by ERN/LRP. PAF-AH activity in HDL and plasma decreased with the use of both agents. Despite their different actions on antioxidant parameters, none of the treatments induced detectable antioxidant improvements. ERN/LRP and FFB had strikingly different effects on HDL quantity and quality, as well as on HDL cholesterol concentrations.

This controversy is largely focused on appropriate identification and treatment of patients for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Whereas statins play an integral role in the treatment and secondary prevention of ASCVD, their use for primary prevention is less clearly defined. It is imperative that health care providers are well versed in the concepts and controversies of the new guideline recommendations for primary prevention of ASCVD and can effectively assess the risks and benefits of statin therapy in this patient population.",

    "30": "Osteoporosis is becoming a major health problem that is associated with increased fracture risk. Previous studies have shown that osteoporosis could delay fracture healing. Although there are potential agents available to promote fracture healing of osteoporotic bone such as statins and tocotrienol, studies on direct delivery of these agents to the fracture site are limited. This study was designed to investigate the effects of two potential agents, lovastatin and tocotrienol using targeted drug delivery system on fracture healing of postmenopausal osteoporosis rats. The fracture healing was evaluated using micro CT and biomechanical parameters. Forty-eight Sprague-Dawley female rats were divided into 6 groups. The first group was sham-operated (SO), while the others were ovariectomized (OVx). After two months, the right tibiae of all rats were fractured at metaphysis region using pulsed ultrasound and were fixed with plates and screws. The SO and OVxC groups were given two single injections of lovastatin and tocotrienol carriers. The estrogen group (OVx+EST) was given daily oral gavages of Premarin (64.5 \u00b5g/kg). The Lovastatin treatment group (OVx+Lov) was given a single injection of 750 \u00b5g/kg lovastatin particles. The tocotrienol group (OVx+TT) was given a single injection of 60 mg/kg tocotrienol particles. The combination treatment group (OVx+Lov+TT) was given two single injections of 750 \u00b5g/kg lovastatin particles and 60 mg/kg tocotrienol particles. After 4 weeks of treatment, the fractured tibiae were dissected out for micro-CT and biomechanical assessments. The combined treatment group (OVx+Lov+TT) showed significantly higher callus volume and callus strength than the OVxC group (p<0.05). Both the OVx+Lov and OVx+TT groups showed significantly higher callus strength than the OVxC group (p<0.05), but not for callus volume. In conclusion, combined lovastatin and tocotrienol may promote better fracture healing of osteoporotic bone.",

The rat model of cerebral artery ischemia was established by the suture-occluded method with ischemia for 2 h and reperfusion for 72 h. Thirty-four male rats were randomly divided into four groups: the normal group and the sham-operation group without any treatment, the I/R group with only intragastric administration of normal saline, and the intervention group, which received intragastric administration of 10 mg/kg atorvastatin at different times. All rats were sacrificed at 72 h. Compared with the I/R group, the morphology of nerve cells in the intervention group was reduced, the number of TUNEL-positive cells decreased, the expression of cortical cytoplasm Cyt C decreased, and the mitochondrial absorbance value increased. All of these differences were statistically significant. Atorvastatin could inhibit neuronal apoptosis and alleviate the cerebral I/R injury.

    "37": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of combined treatment with rosuvastatin and LY333531, a selective protein kinase C (PKC)\u03b22 inhibitor, on angiogenesis under hyperglycemic conditions. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured in medium containing a normal or high concentration of glucose (33.3 mmol/l) were treated with rosuvastatin (0.1 \u00b5mol/l) alone or in combination with LY333531 (10 nmol/l). HUVEC migration and tube formation were assessed. Furthermore, rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes were randomly divided into groups and treated with either rosuvastatin alone (5 mg/kg/day) or in combination with LY333531 (10 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks following the induction of myocardial infarction (MI). Echocardiographic patterns, the extent of myocardial fibrosis, capillary density in myocardial tissue, the phosphorylation of Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), as well as the expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-\u03b1 (HIF\u20111\u03b1) were assessed. The results from the in vitro experiment revealed that the tube-forming and migration ability of the HUVECs exposed to high-glucose medium was significantly improved in the group treated with the combination of rosuvastatin and LY333531. In vivo, the combination of rosuvastatin and LY333531 significantly improved left ventricular function, reduced the extent of myocardial fibrosis and increased myocardial capillary density compared to treatment with rosuvastatin alone. In addition, the expression levels of VEGF, and Akt and eNOS phosphorylation were significantly higher in the group exposed to the combination treatment than in the group treated with rosuvastatin alone. The results of the present study indicate that, compared to treatment with rosuvastatin alone, combined treatment with rosuvastatin and LY333531 promotes a greater level of angiogenesis in diabetic rats with MI. This effect is likely mediated through the upregulation of the VEGF\u2011dependent Akt/eNOS signaling pathway.", 
    "38": "The present study was designed to determine the association between atrial fibrillation (AF) and inflammation in a goat sterile pericarditis model and to assess the effect of atorvastatin, a cholesterol\u2011reducing drug, on AF. A total of 15 adult male goats were randomly divided into control, untreated pericarditis and atorvastatin\u2011treated pericarditis groups. Pericarditis was induced via thoracotomy and atorvastatin was administered orally (60 mg/day) to the goats in the latter group for the duration of the study, commencing 1 week prior to surgery. The levels of high\u2011sensitivity C\u2011reactive protein (hs\u2011CRP), interleukin(IL)\u20116 and tumor necrosis factor\u2011\u03b1 (TNF\u2011\u03b1) were significantly elevated following surgery in the untreated pericarditis and atorvastatin groups compared with the control group (P<0.05). However, lower levels of hs\u2011CRP, IL\u20116 and TNF\u2011\u03b1 were observed in the atorvastatin group compared with the untreated pericarditis group (P<0.05). Additionally, the animals in the atorvastatin\u2011treated pericarditis group had a longer effective refractory period (ERP) and a higher rate adaptation of the ERP compared with those in the untreated pericarditis group (P<0.05). There was a significant negative correlation between the levels of ERP and hs\u2011CRP in the untreated pericarditis group. The inducibility of AF in the left atrium and the duration of AF in the untreated pericarditis and atorvastatin\u2011treated groups increased significantly following surgery (P<0.05). The pericarditis group, however, had a longer duration of AF compared with the atorvastatin group (P<0.05). Thus, inflammation may promote AF by shortening atrial ERP and by reducing the rate adaptation of ERP. These results suggested that atorvastatin can attenuate AF by inhibiting inflammation and may assist in preventing the occurrence and recurrence of AF following cardiac surgery.", 
    "39": "Recent studies have reported on circadian variation in infarct size in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Controversy remains as to whether this finding indicates circadian dependence of myocardial tolerance to ischemia/reperfusion injury or that it can simply be explained by confounding factors such as baseline profile and ischemic time. We assessed the clinical impact and independent association between symptom onset time and infarct size, accounting for possible subgroup differences. From a multicenter registry, 6799 consecutive STEMI patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) between 2004 and 2010 were included. Infarct size was measured using peak creatine kinase (CK). Infarct size exhibited circadian variation with largest infarct size in patients with symptom onset around 03:00 at night (estimated peak CK 1322 U/l; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1217-1436) and smallest infarct size around 11:00 in the morning (estimated peak CK 1071 U/l; 95% CI: 1001-1146; relative reduction 19%; p\u2009=\u20090.001). Circadian variation in infarct size followed an inverse pattern in patients with prior myocardial infarction (p-interaction <0.001) and prior PCI (p-interaction\u2009=\u20090.006), although the later did not persist in multivariable analysis. Symptom onset time remained associated with infarct size after accounting for these interactions and adjusting for baseline characteristics and ischemic time.

There are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatments, and current treatments are time-consuming, expensive, and of low efficacy. We sought to identify new treatments for vitiligo, and first considered repurposed medications because of the availability of safety data and expedited regulatory approval. We previously reported that the IFN-\u03b3-induced chemokine CXCL10 is expressed in lesional skin from vitiligo patients, and that it is critical for the progression and maintenance of depigmentation in our mouse model of vitiligo. We hypothesized that targeting IFN-\u03b3 signaling might be an effective new treatment strategy. Activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) is required for IFN-\u03b3 signaling and recent studies revealed that simvastatin, an FDA-approved cholesterol-lowering medication, inhibited STAT1 activation in vitro. Therefore, we hypothesized that simvastatin may be an effective treatment for vitiligo. We found that simvastatin both prevented and reversed depigmentation in our mouse model of vitiligo, and reduced the number of infiltrating autoreactive CD8(+) T cells in the skin. Treatment of melanocyte-specific, CD8(+) T cells in vitro decreased proliferation and IFN-\u03b3 production, suggesting additional effects of simvastatin directly on T cells.

The assessment of the risk of cardiovascular events, including also death, the cause of which are cardiovascular diseases, is a very important and essential part of clinical evaluation. Moreover, all patients with ACS are assessed as regards the risk of complications and in-hospital mortality and the short- and long-term patient outcomes. Recently, in the prognostic assessment of ACS patients attention has been paid to hyperglycemia, leukocytosis, and decreased GFR, which might worsen the prognosis. Hyperglycemia on admission and especially its occurrence and persistence during hospitalization speak for particularly poor prognosis. Furthermore, the annual and long-term mortality rate is observed to increase with the higher HbA1c level, regardless of the glucose concentration on admission to hospital. Increased risk of the occurrence of cardiovascular events is observed with the intensity of the inflammation which is reflected, among others, in elevated number of peripheral blood leukocytes. Attention is drawn to the higher rate of complications in patients with increased baseline leukocytosis. The correlation between the increase in leukocyte count and all-cause mortality is statistically significant. A higher risk of non- fatal myocardial infarction is also observed with the increase of leukocytosis. Neutrophils, which are the main pool of white blood cells, and whose activation is observed during PCI, may play a role in these unfavorable phenomena. This activation results in increased production of oxygen free radicals by these cells, intensification of adhesion and aggregation. A number of studies point to the cardioprotective mechanism of action of statins (anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic) in patients with ACS. The use of leukocyte reduction filters in patients during CABG may be one of the methods limiting the impact of leukocytosis on cardiovascular events in patients with ACS. Renal failure is a strong and independent predictor of mortality in patients with ACS. Contrast-induced nephropathy is a complication following coronarography which is performed in patients with ACS for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Hyperglycemia also has an adverse effect on this complication. The prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy includes the use of statins prior to PCI.",

Thus all current guidelines are based primarily on the Risk-Benefit paradigm of primary prevention.

The Causal Exposure paradigm differs from the Risk-Benefit paradigm in that the objective of therapy is to prevent the anatomic disease within arterial walls that produces cardiovascular risk. Moreover, the anatomic disease and, therefore, the cardiovascular risk, is a function of the injurious action of the causal factors of vascular disease, such as blood pressure and LDL, on the arterial wall over long periods. In this article, we explain the strengths and weaknesses of both paradigms to provide a more secure framework to compare the strengths and weaknesses in the different cholesterol guidelines with particular emphasis on the evidence that the cardiovascular risk and the benefit from statin therapy is related to the level of LDL.",

Statin therapy was associated with a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.54; 95% CI, [CI], 0.38-0.78), myocardial infarction (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45-0.87), stroke (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.39-0.67), and the composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.29-0.70). No significant differences in cardiovascular mortality (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.41-1.63) and the incidence of kidney injury (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.58-1.39) between the groups were identified.", 
    "232": "Our analysis demonstrated that statin therapy is beneficial in improving operative and interventional outcomes and should be considered as part of the optimization strategy for prevention of adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and death.", 
    "233": "Bilateral quadriceps tendon rupture (BQTR) is a rare diagnosis only reported in about 100 cases in international literature, and is often associated with medical diseases, trauma or certain medications. We present a 64-year-old man with spontaneous BQTR, diagnosed and treated at our hospital. His risk factors were obesity (BMI = 30.95 kg/m2), statin use, and recreational tennis at time of injury. The diagnosis of BQTR is difficult and is often missed initially. There is also emerging thoughts that the use of statins may be a risk factor for BQTR. The evidence, however, is scarce.", 
    "234": "Alterations in small GTPase mediated signal transduction pathways have emerged as a central step in the molecular pathogenesis of glioblastoma (GBM), the most common malignant brain tumor in adults. Farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) are derived from mevalonate, whose production is catalyzed by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase. Prenylation by FPP and GGPP is required for membrane insertion and oncogenic function of Ras- and Rho-proteins, within the stimulation of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. A straightforward prediction from HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor studies is that statins decrease FPP and GGPP levels and diminish ERK signaling ensuring less proliferation and migration of cancer cells. Perillyl alcohol (POH), a naturally occurring monoterpene inhibits prenyltransferases and is able to inhibit cancer cell growth, but the underlying mechanism is still unclear. We here report that lovastatin (LOV) and POH impair the regulation of the mevalonate- and the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway in U87 and U343 glioblastoma cells. Both compounds affected the post-translational modification of H-Ras and Rac1. While LOV diminished the substrates of the transferase reaction that catalyze prenylation, POH inhibited the enzymes itself. Our data highlight the impact of isoprenoids for post-translational modification of small GTPases promoting proliferation, migration and invasion capabilities in glioma cells.", 
    "235": "After almost a decade, finally Guidelines for the management of hypercholesterolemia in adults by the AHA/ACC were published. The substantial change in the paradigm of this new recommendation is the treatment decision basically statin, based on a recalculation of cardiovascular risk. Four groups were identified and based on them different statins indication, according to the power applied. As is apparent, have been used only randomized clinical trials (RCT) as the sole basis for the drafting of these new guidelines. Two basic issues are reviewed and revised in the following article: leaving aside other types of evidence to generate the recommendation and on the other hand the attempt to simplify the interpretation and management of this condition. We stress the need for any recommendation to clinical reasoning to interpret different scenarios involved in each patient.", 
    "236": "The advent of flow dynamics and the recent availability of perfusion analysis software have provided new diagnostic tools and management possibilities for cerebrovascular patients. To this end, we provide an example of the use of color-coded angiography and its application in a rare case of a patient with a pure middle cerebral artery (MCA) malformation. A 42-year-old male chronic smoker was evaluated in the emergency room due to sudden onset of severe headache, nausea, vomiting and left-sided weakness. Head computed tomography revealed a right basal ganglia hemorrhage. Cerebral digital subtraction angiography (DSA) showed a right middle cerebral artery malformation consisting of convoluted and ectatic collateral vessels supplying the distal middle cerebral artery territory-M1 proximally occluded. An associated medial lenticulostriate artery aneurysm was found. Brain single-photon emission computed tomography with and without acetazolamide failed to show problems in vascular reserve that would indicate the need for flow augmentation. Twelve months after discharge, the patient recovered from the left-sided weakness and did not present any similar events. A follow-up DSA and perfusion study using color-coded perfusion analysis showed perforator aneurysm resolution and adequate, albeit delayed perfusion in the involved vascular territory. We propose a combined congenital and acquired mechanism involving M1 occlusion with secondary dysplastic changes in collateral supply to the distal MCA territory. Angiographic and cerebral perfusion work-up was used to exclude the need for flow augmentation. Nevertheless, the natural course of this lesion remains unclear and long-term follow-up is warranted.",

    "238": "A prospective assessment of 118 consecutive patients was performed. Clinical allied with haematological and biochemical variables were measured. Micronutrients measured included vitamins K1 , PIVKA-II (protein-induced in vitamin K absence factor II), vitamin D, vitamin B12 (holotranscobalamin), iron, transferrin and folate.",

Hypertension was present in 47% and type 2 diabetes in 32%. Vitamin D supplements had been prescribed in 8%. Micronutrient insufficiencies were found for vitamin K (40%), vitamin D (92%) and vitamin B12 (25%), and also iron (44%) and folate (18%). Normocalcaemic vitamin D insufficiency with secondary hyperparathyroidism was present in 18%. Iron and transferrin levels were associated with age, sex and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Vitamin K levels were associated with age, and inversely with BMI and diabetes mellitus; and PIVKA-II with smoking, triglycerides and liver function markers. Vitamin D levels were associated with statin use and prescription of supplements and inversely with BMI. Vitamin B12 levels were associated with ethnicity and HbA1c.", 
    "240": "Micronutrient status shows differing relationships with age, gender and BMI. Vitamin K insufficiency was present in 40% and not related to deficiencies in other vitamins or micronutrients. Vitamin D and vitamin K supplementation should be considered prebariatric surgery in patients with diabetes or severe insulin resistance.", 
    "241": "Statins intolerance is mainly due to their side effects on the neuromuscular system (primarily muscle). It has become an important issue because of the major cardiovascular risk reduction of this class of drugs. However, the facts related to these side effects are sometimes under-recognized or controversial. A literature review of the recent developments in the field is given. The clinical definition of statin myopathy and its presentation are not suitable for the myology field. Management and prevention are not validated. More genetic risk factors need to be established. Neurologists should become more involved in statin intolerance evaluation and management.", 
    "242": "The objective of this study was to examine whether statin therapy is associated with enhanced endothelium-dependent vascular function, improved pulmonary function and reduced systemic inflammation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).",

    "244": "Patients with stable COPD (n = 99) were assigned randomly to receive rosuvastatin 10 mg (n = 49) or matching placebo (n = 50) once daily for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was change in endothelium-dependent vascular function measured using peripheral arterial tonometry and expressed as the reactive hyperaemia index. Secondary end-points were change in pulmonary function, as assessed by forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC), and change in the circulating levels of the inflammatory markers interleukin-6 (IL6) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP).", 
    "245": "In the overall study population, no significant between-group difference in change in endothelium-dependent vascular or pulmonary function was observed. Rosuvastatin therapy was associated with a reduction in hsCRP (-20% vs. 11%, P = 0.017) and an attenuation of the rise in IL6 concentration (8% vs. 30%, P = 0.028) compared with placebo. In a prespecified subgroup analysis of patients with a supra-median circulating hsCRP concentration (>1.7 mg L(-1) ), rosuvastatin was associated with improved endothelium-dependent vascular function (13% vs. 2%, P = 0.026).", 
    "246": "In stable COPD patients without the standard indications for statin therapy, rosuvastatin treatment is associated with a significant attenuation of systemic inflammation and improvement in endothelial-dependent vascular function in patients with evidence of systemic inflammation.",

    "248": "Male adult Wistar rats were divided into the following groups: SHAM (control); SHAM+Statin (0.5 mg/kg simvastatin, orally); Sepsis (cecal puncture ligation - CPL); Sepsis+Statin. Physiological parameters, peritoneal fluid culture, renal function, oxidative metabolites, severity of acute kidney injury and animal survival were evaluated.",

    "251": "Research suggests that statins affect the regulation of arterial blood pressure (BP), however, the mechanisms remain obscure. We maintained male, 12-week-old, Sprague-Dawley rats on tap water (controls) or water containing simvastatin or pravastatin for 4 weeks. Subsequently, we measured mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate at baseline and after intravenous infusion of either saline or angiotensin II (Ang II). Additionally, we tested baroreflex function and the effect of statins on vasoconstrictor response to Ang II on isolated femoral artery branches. Controls and simvastatin and pravastatin groups showed a significant increase in mean arterial BP and heart rate in response to Ang II. The increase was significantly smaller in the simvastatin group than in controls and in the pravastatin group. In contrast, when pretreated with hexamethonium, a ganglionic blocker, simvastatin and pravastatin groups showed a similar hypertensive response to Ang II, which was smaller than in controls. Likewise, the Ang II-induced vasoconstrictor response of femoral artery branches was comparable between simvastatin and pravastatin groups and smaller than in controls. We found no effect of statins on the baroreflex. This study shows that simvastatin and pravastatin differ in their effects on the Ang II-dependent mechanisms controlling BP.", 
    "252": "A novel pH-responsive polymer, poly(methacrylic acid-co-acrylic acid)-co-polyvinyl-pyrrolidone (polymeric nano-carrier) was synthesized and used for encapsulation of 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane modified Fe3O4 nanoparticles to prepare a new magnetic nano-carrier. The loading and release characteristics of both polymeric and magnetic nano-carriers were investigated using fluvastatin as the model drug. The loading behavior of the carriers was studied by varying concentration of fluvastatin in aqueous medium at 25\u00b0C and their release was followed spectrophotometrically (at 304 nm) at 37\u00b0C in three different solutions (buffered at pH1.2, 5.5 and 7.2) to simulate gastric and intestine medium. The effect of different parameters on the release of fluvastatin such as the amount of methacrylic acid monomer, cross-linker amount, initiator amount, and magnetic nanoparticles content was also studied. Considering the release kinetics and mechanism of the magnetic nanocarrier besides swelling behavior study of the polymeric nano-carrier reveal Fickian pattern and diffusion controlled mechanism for delivery of fluvastatin.", 
    "253": "As healthcare spending continues to increase, reimbursement cuts have become 1 type of healthcare reform to contain costs. Little is known about the long-term impact of cuts in reimbursement, especially under a global budget cap with fee-for-service (FFS) reimbursement, on processes and outcomes of care. The FFS-based reimbursement cuts have been implemented since July 2002 in Taiwan. We examined the long-term association of FFS-based reimbursement cuts with trends in processes and outcomes of care for stroke.", 
    "254": "We analyzed all 411,487 patients with stroke admitted to general acute care hospitals in Taiwan during the period 1997 to 2010 through Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. We used a quasi-experimental design with quarterly measures of healthcare utilization and outcomes and used segmented autoregressive integrated moving average models for the analysis. After accounting for secular trends and other confounders, the implementation of the FFS-based reimbursement cuts was associated with trend changes in computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging scanning (0.31% per quarter; P=0.013), antiplatelet/anticoagulant use (-0.20% per quarter; P<0.001), statin use (0.18% per quarter; P=0.027), physiotherapy/occupational therapy assessment (0.25% per quarter; P<0.001), and 30-day mortality (0.06% per quarter; P<0.001).", 
    "255": "There are improvement trends in processes and outcomes of care over time. However, the reimbursement cuts from the FFS-based global budget cap are associated with trend changes in processes and outcomes of care for stroke. The FFS-based reimbursement cuts may have long-term positive and negative associations with stroke care."
