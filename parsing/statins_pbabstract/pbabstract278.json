Despite many therapeutic regimens introduced recently, the prognosis for patients suffering from treatment-resistant or relapsing multiple myeloma is still very poor. Thus, there is an urgent medical need for novel innovative drugs. Thalidomide is successfully used in resistant or relapsing myeloma patients, being reported to induce apoptosis or G1 growth arrest of myeloma cells and to regulate microvessel density and cytokine secretion. Lovastatin, largely used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, is another promising drug in multiple myeloma. High doses of lovastatin have been shown to have antiproliferative effect by inhibition of malignant cell proliferation and inducing programmed cell death.", 
    "1": "In this study, we tried to assess whether thalidomide and lovastatin had a combined effect on apoptosis of myeloma cells. We analyzed apoptosis induced by mixture of these two drugs in short-term cell culture of myeloma plasmocytes. To assess apoptosis, we used Annexin V and propidium iodide binding. We also examined the regulation of BCL-2 and BAX protein expression in the population of CD138+ plasmocytes. The cells were analyzed with the use of flow cytometry technique. The experiments were done before and after 72 h of cell culture.", 
    "2": "We detected a higher rate of apoptosis induced by lovastatin and thalidomide mixture in comparison to apoptosis induced by lovastatin or thalidomide alone. In most patients, the BCL-2/BAX ratio was lower in cell cultures supplemented with mixture of lovastatin and thalidomide in comparison with cell cultures supplemented with lovastatin or thalidomide alone.",

Disorders of hemostatic balance increase possibility of clot formation and play significant role in the development of atherosclerosis. Statins applied in prevention of cardiovascular diseases, have not only hypolipemic activity but also many pleiotropic effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the level of thrombin generation and clot bound thrombin in patients with hyperlipidemia type II (hlpII) before and after statins treatment. 81 patients were involved in this study: 59 patients with hlp II and 22 healthy. Patients with hlp II were treated with pravastatin (20 mg/day; n=10), simvastatin (20 mg/day; n=22), atorvastatin (10 mg/day; n=27). The treatment in each of groups lasted 8 weeks. Thrombin generation and clot bound thrombin level were estimated before and after therapy by means of spectrophotometric method with usage of chromogenic substrate S-2238. Our results demonstrate that therapy with atorva- simva- and pravastatin improves lipid levels in plasma and investigated hemostasis parameters. All three statins statistically significantly decrease total generated thrombin. Atorva- and simvastatin also significantly decrease activity both free generated thrombin and clot bound thrombin. No correlation between lipidogram and hemostatic parameters after treatment with statins suggests that observed changes are pleiotropic effect of statins treatment.",

Progression of atherosclerosis was assessed using carotid intima media thickness as surrogate marker using standard protocol on B-mode ultrasound including common carotid artery, common carotid bifurcation and internal carotid artery measurements. Follow-up study for carotid intima media thickness was done at end of one year. A decrease in mean maximum carotid intima media thickness was recorded for all the three carotid segments individually from basal to end of one year in atorvastatin group [common carotid artery -0.008 mm (p = 0.01), common carotid bifurcation-0.022 mm (p = 0.001), internal carotid artery -0.009 mm (p = 0.01)] while the same showed an increase in placebo group [common carotid artery +0.011 mm (p = NS), common carotid bifurcation +0.013 mm (p=NS), internal carotid artery +0.007 mm (p=NS)]. The average mean carotid intima media thickness (all three segments included) decreased from 0.739 +/- 0.114 mm to 0.726 +/- 0.115 mm (difference -0.013 mm) in statin group and increased from 0.733 +/- 0.124 mm to 0.742 +/- 0.117 mm (difference + 0.009 mm) in placebo group (p < 0.001).

Multichannel voiding-pressure urodynamic studies revealed an acontractile neurogenic bladder with overflow incontinence. The patient was discharged on a conservative regimen with arrangement for visiting nurse services to perform intermittent self-catheterization twice daily. Urodynamic testing was repeated 10 weeks after initial symptoms. During voiding cystometry a biphasic increase in detrusor pressure of 15 cm H2O was observed with no increase in abdominal pressure.

In the atorvastatin group the TP changes were significantly different at 2 hours and 24 hours (p = 0.005), whereas in the simvastatin group there was a gradual, more or less linear decline in TP until 7 days (p = 0.006) and then a plateau. Simvastatin exhibited a faster statistically significant decrease over time in IL-6 and sICAM 1 levels (at 7 days, p = 0.014 and p = 0.001, respectively). TNF-alpha demonstrated a faster linear trend in the simvastatin group, but the significant effect appeared late (p = 0.006).

    "44": "Angiogenesis is one of the earliest and essential phenotypes acquired by tumors during carcinogenesis and thus might be a potential target for chemoprevention. Key to developing antiangiogenic chemoprevention is to identify new molecular targets and effective angiogenesis inhibitors. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, or statins, were originally designed to reduce cholesterol biosynthesis and have been extensively used as prevention drugs against hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular conditions. Recent research has found that statins promote endothelial death and inhibit experimental angiogenesis induced by growth factors or tumor, laying a foundation for developing statin-based angiopreventive strategies. This article reviews the biological effects of statins on endothelial cells and angiogenesis, possible underlying mechanisms and perspectives on future application of statins in preventing pathological angiogenesis.",

After 6 months of therapy, the predefined primary efficacy end point (an increase of >5% in the absolute left ventricular ejection fraction and > or =2 selected criteria by echocardiography and a decrease in New York Heart Association functional class) was significant in the statin-treated patients (p = 0.004). Among secondary efficacy parameters, the quality-of-life index showed a trend suggesting the benefit of statin therapy (p = 0.055). In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that treatment with atorvastatin in addition to standard therapy for heart failure may significantly improve clinical outcomes in this cohort of patients.", 
    "46": "Over-the-counter (OTC) statin availability has been hypothesized to represent a strategy for treating consumers at moderate risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) who are currently not receiving drug therapy. The viability of this strategy has been questioned, particularly with respect to the public health benefit that can be obtained in an unsupervised treatment environment. The previously reported Consumer Use Study of Over-the-Counter Lovastatin (CUSTOM) examined consumer behavior in a simulated OTC setting in which 20 mg lovastatin could be purchased. Framingham CHD risk scores were calculated for 981 self-selected consumers who used OTC lovastatin in CUSTOM. Overall, this group had a median 10-year CHD risk of 10%, but with significant numbers of consumers with estimated risks of <5% and >20%. According to the risk profile of CUSTOM consumers, the use of 20 mg lovastatin for 10 years would be expected to prevent approximately 33,100 CHD events per 1 million users. This represents a 10-year number needed to treat of 30 consumers. This optimal benefit may be reduced because some higher risk consumers in CUSTOM used lovastatin rather than appropriate, more aggressive supervised care. On the basis of the frequencies of diversion from optimal care observed in CUSTOM, the number of events prevented might be reduced to 23,000 (number needed to treat 43 consumers). Sensitivity analyses have demonstrated that these estimates are robust and that the predicted public health benefit likely falls in the range of 23,000 to 33,000 CHD events prevented per 1 million treated for 10 years. In conclusion, on a population basis, OTC statin availability is likely to result in clinically meaningful reductions in CHD morbidity and mortality. The analyses also identified opportunities for optimizing the use of OTC statins in the marketplace.", 
    "47": "Although statins are effective lipid-lowering agents, the phenotypic and demographic predictors of such lowering have been less well examined. We enrolled 944 African-American and white men and women who completed an open-label, 6-week pharmacogenetics trial of 40 mg of simvastatin. The phenotypic and demographic variables were examined as predictors of the change in lipids and lipoproteins using linear regression analysis. On average, treatment with simvastatin lowered low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 54 mg/dl and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 2 mg/dl. Compared with African-Americans, whites had a 3-mg/dl greater LDL reduction and a 1-mg/dl higher HDL elevation, independent of other variables, including baseline lipoprotein levels (p <0.01). Multivariate analyses revealed moderate subgroup differences, with older participants having a larger decrease in LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B levels compared with younger participants (p <0.001), women having larger increases in HDL than men (p <0.01), nonsmokers having larger decreases in LDL and triglyceride levels compared with smokers (p <0.05), those with hypertension having smaller decreases in apolipoprotein B than those without hypertension (p <0.05), and those with a larger waist circumference having a diminished lowering of triglycerides in response to treatment with simvastatin (p <0.01). In conclusion, treatment with simvastatin produced favorable lipid and lipoprotein changes among all participants. The magnitude of the lipid and lipoprotein responses, however, differed among participants according to a number of phenotypic and demographic characteristics.", 
    "48": "Coronary collateral development is an important compensatory mechanism in advanced coronary artery disease, and patients with diabetes mellitus have impaired coronary collateral development. This study tested the hypothesis that statin treatment may increase coronary collateral development in patients with diabetes mellitus. The study population consisted of 149 consecutive diabetic patients who underwent clinically indicated coronary angiography and had >95% stenosis of > or =1 major coronary artery. Clinical information, including age, gender, history of hypertension, smoking, myocardial infarction, clinical presentation, and medications, was recorded before coronary angiography. Coronary collaterals were graded according to the Cohen-Rentrop method. Collateral grading was classified as poor when the collateral grade was 0 to 1 and good when it was 2 to 3. Among 149 patients (85 men; mean age 62 +/- 10 years), 74 (56%) were receiving statin treatment. In multivariate analysis, among demographic, clinical, and angiographic parameters, only statin therapy (odds ratio 3, 95% confidence interval 1.5 to 6.03, p = 0.002) and stable angina pectoris (odds ratio 3.24, 95% confidence interval 1.42 to 7.41, p = 0.005) were found to be independent predictors of better collateral formation. In conclusion, stable angina pectoris and statin treatment are associated with better coronary collateral development in patients with diabetes mellitus.", 
    "49": "Diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Endothelial dysfunction (i.e. decreased endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular disease. The present study was undertaken to determine whether diabetes induced by streptozotocin alters mesenteric responses to vasodilators and, if so, to study the acute in vitro effects of lovastatin and chelerythrine. Endothelial function was assessed in constantly perfused preparation removed from rats, 12 weeks after treatment with either saline or streptozotocin (45 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). In pre-contracted mesenteric beds (with 100 microM phenylephrine) removed from diabetic rats, the concentration response curve to acetylcholine, but not to sodium nitroprusside, was significantly reduced. Perfusion with lovastatin (10 microM for 20 min) or chelerythrine (1 microM for 20 min) significantly improved the acetylcholine-mediated relaxation in preparations removed from diabetic but not control rats. Pre-incubation of tissue with N(G)-nitro-L-argenine methyl ester hydrochloride (10 microM for 20 min) inhibited the beneficial effect of lovastatin but not chelerythrine. Pre-treatment of tissue with indomethacin (10 microM for 20 min) did not modify the effects of lovastatin or chelerythrine on acetylcholine responses. The present results demonstrate that endothelial dysfunction induced by diabetes (in a resistant vasculature, such as rat mesenteric bed) may be improved by an acute exposure to either lovastatin or chelerythrine. Furthermore, our results suggest that the beneficial effect of lovastatin is mediated via the nitric oxide pathway.",

    "59": "Lipid membrane peroxidation is highly associated with neuronal death in various neurodegenerative diseases including cerebral stroke. Here, we report that simvastatin decreases oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)/reoxygenation-evoked neuronal death by inhibiting the production and cytoxicity of 4-hydroxy-2E-nonenal (HNE), the final product of lipid peroxidation. Simvastatin markedly decreased the OGD/reoxygenation-evoked death of cortical neurons. OGD/reoxygenation increased the intracellular HNE level mostly in neuronal cells, not glial cells. Simvastatin decreased the intracellular level of HNE in neuronal cells exposed to OGD/reoxygenation. We further found that HNE induced the cytotoxicity in neuronal cells and synergistically increased the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated excitotoxicity. Simvastatin largely blocked the NMDA neurotoxicity potentiated by HNE. However, simvastatin did not alter the NMDA-evoked calcium influx in the absence or presence of HNE. HNE inhibited the activity of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB), and the cytotoxicity of HNE was in good correlation with inactivation of NF-kappaB. Simvastatin reversed the inhibition of NF-kappaB activity induced by OGD/reoxygenation or HNE. The neuroprotection by simvastatin was significantly attenuated by various NF-kappaB inhibitors, implying that simvastatin inhibits the cytotoxicity of HNE at least in part by maintaining the activity of NF-kappaB. Further understanding of the neuroprotective mechanism of simvastatin may provide a therapeutic strategy for oxidative stress-related neurodegenerative diseases.",

In this report we describe the expression and purification of enzymatically active schistosome HMG-CoA reductase enzyme. The recombinant protein was tested, in parallel with the mammalian enzyme, against well-known mammalian HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors obtained from various pharmaceutical companies. We demonstrated that there were significant differences in the response of the two proteins to an array of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. The difference in the characteristics between mammalian and schistosome enzyme could be exploited for rational drug design.", 
    "71": "The purpose of the study was to evaluate the therapeutic effects of lovastatin and allicor on thrombocyte-vascular hemostasis in patients suffering from arterial hypertension (AH) with metabolic syndrome (MS). Twenty-two patients were administered lovastatin in a dose of 20 mg before sleep; 23 patients received allicor in a dose of two tablets or 150 mg twice a day. The therapy lasted one month in both groups. The dynamics of the following variables was evaluated: anthropometric parameters, blood lipid spectrum, lipid peroxidation in serum and thrombocytes, the antioxidative protectability of the lipid part of blood and thrombocytes, thrombocyte aggregation and their intravascular activity, and vascular hemostasis indices. The results were processed using Student coefficient, as well as system and correlation analysis. The study shows that lovastatin and, to a less degree, allicor, has a hypolipidemic effect, as well as a positive effect on peroxidation syndrome in patients suffering from AH with MS, optimizing thrombocyte-vascular hemostasis to the same degree. As a cheaper drug, allicor may be used widely to prevent thrombosis in patients with AH with MS. In order to lessen body mass in such patients, lovastatin and allicor should be applied together with non-drug means.",

Among the risk factors to be addressed are hypertension and hyperlipidaemia; these commonly coexist. A neutral or lipid-friendly antihypertensive agent is probably useful in the presence of lipid abnormalities. Similarly, statins have been shown to decrease cardiovascular risk in hypertensive patients. There is also experimental and clinical evidence that statins have blood pressure (BP)-lowering effects. In this review, we discuss the beneficial effects of statins on BP, and provide an overview of the underlying pathophysiology.

    "79": "The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the effects of fluvastatin on the lipid pro-file and on renal function, as measured by creatinine clearance, in dyslipidemic patients with chronic renal failure. In this 8-month prospective, open-label, randomized, parallel-group trial, 130 patients (70 men and 60 women), after a 2-month washout period following previous lipid-lowering treatments, were randomly assigned to fluvastatin XL 80 mg given once daily (80 patients) or to standard treatment (50 patients). Mean total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride values after 3 and 6 months of treatment with fluvastatin showed statistically significant improvement compared with standard treatment. Improved renal function, as measured by creatinine clearance, was observed at the end of the 6-month treatment period in approximately 65% of patients treated with fluvastatin. The increase in creatinine clearance consistently reached 10% to 15% of baseline values. A statistically significant reduction in C-reactive protein (CRP) over baseline values was observed in approximately 75% of patients treated with fluvastatin. Furthermore, mean values of CRP for the fluvastatin standard treatment groups, respectively, were 6.78 and 10.19 at 3 months and 4.47 and 11 at 6 months. Both treatments were well tolerated. No major adverse events were noted. Results of this study suggest that fluvastatin treatment in patients with chronic renal failure is effective in improving the lipid profile, and it demonstrates good safety and tolerability. Furthermore, fluvastatin may contribute to improved nephroprotection in this patient population.", 
    "80": "The lipid triad is the association of small, dense (sd) low-density lipoprotein (LDL), low high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and hypertriglyceridemia, all of which play a role in coronary artery disease in patients with type 2 diabetes. Although statins have demonstrated clear positive effects on cardiovascular morbidity/mortality in patients with diabetes and on single components of the lipid triad, it remains controversial whether they affect all components of the triad in these patients. Therefore, we performed a single-center, parallel-group, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint (PROBE)-type comparison of fluvastatin extended-release (XL) 80 mg (n=48) and simvastatin 20 mg (n=46), each given once daily for 2 months to patients with type 2 diabetes with the lipid triad, who were enrolled after a 1-month lifestyle modification and dietary intervention program. After fluvastatin therapy, LDL (-51%; P<.01), apolipoprotein B (ApoB; -33%; P<.01), intermediate-density LDL (idLDL) (-14.3%; P<.05), sdLDL (-45%; P<.01), and triglycerides (-38%; P<.01) were significantly decreased, and HDL (+14.3%; P<.05) and apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I; +7%; P<.05) were increased; large buoyant (lb) LDL did not change (P=NS). Simvastatin therapy decreased LDL (-55.1%; P<.01), ApoB (-46%; P<.01), lbLDL (-33.3%; P<.05), idLDL (-22.7%; P<.05), sdLDL (-33.3%; P<.05), and triglycerides (-47.9%; P<.01); HDL was not changed (P=NS) after simvastatin, but ApoA-I was increased (+11.3%; P<.01). HDL increases (P<.01) and sdLDL decreases (P<.01) were significantly greater after fluvastatin compared with simvastatin therapy; LDL, triglycerides, ApoB, and idLDL changes were similar after both therapies (P=NS), and lbLDL decreases were greater with simvastatin therapy (P<.05). With both treatments, classic mean LDL and ApoB target levels were achieved in most patients. We conclude that the lipid triad can be controlled with fluvastatin XL 80 mg in patients with type 2 diabetes.", 
    "81": "Aggressive lipid lowering was initially controversial due to evidence from epidemiologic studies that implied an increase in total mortality with low cholesterol levels combined with equivocal results from early trials utilizing bile acid resins or fibric acid derivatives. The advent of statin therapy allowed significant reductions of circulating lipid levels and clearly reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Additionally, in adequately powered trials, total mortality was also reduced. The optimal level of circulating low-density lipoprotein (LDL) has not been definitely established. However, recent clinical trials with aggressive lipid goals have established that LDL cholesterol can be significantly lowered below 100 mg/dL with improvement in both surrogate measurements and hard clinical endpoints. Ongoing clinical trials have been initiated that will determine the optimal level of LDL cholesterol that will insure cardiovascular benefits and establish the risk-benefit relationship of aggressive pharmacologic lowering of circulating lipid levels.", 
    "82": "Low-protein diets (<or=0.7 g/kg per day) have been advocated for over 70 years as a means of slowing the rate of progression of kidney disease and delaying the appearance of uraemic symptoms and need for dialysis. However, the available evidence to date suggests that the benefit : risk ratio of dietary protein restriction is not favourable in that: (i) compliance is generally sub-optimal; (ii) most of the published randomised controlled trials demonstrate that low-protein diets do not significantly slow the rate of kidney disease progression; (iii) meta-analyses of controlled trials have demonstrated strong evidence of publication bias favouring studies with positive, rather than negative, results; (iv) the optimal level and duration of dietary protein intake have not been defined; (v) there is no convincing clinical evidence that dietary protein restriction provides any benefit beyond that afforded by angiotensin blockade; and (vi) low-protein diets are associated with both statistically and clinically significant declines in nutritional markers in chronic kidney disease populations, which already have a high prevalence of malnutrition. Patients with progressive kidney disease are therefore likely to be better served by avoiding dietary protein restriction (thereby ensuring optimal preservation of their nutrition) and instituting alternative, proven renoprotective measures (e.g. renin-angiotensin system blockade, blood pressure reduction and statin therapy).", 
    "83": "Experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) in rats is a T-cell-mediated disorder and has been shown to involve immune imbalance. The aim of this study was to examine the immunomodulatory effects of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, atorvastatin, on the expression of MHC class II molecules in the myocardium of rats with EAM, and to examine its therapeutic potential for EAM. EAM was induced in Lewis rats by injection of porcine cardiac myosin. High-dosage (10 mg/kg per day) or low-dosage (1 mg/kg per day) atorvastatin or vehicle was given orally for 3 weeks. On day 21 after immunization, echocardiography was carried out and the severity of myocarditis was evaluated by histopathological investigations. Immunohistochemistry techniques were used to examine the expression of MHC class II molecules in the myocardium. Type I, III and IV class II transactivator (CIITA) promoter transcription was evaluated by reverse transcription-PCR. Cardiomyocytes were isolated and the expression of MHC class II molecules by them was detected using cytometry. Serum Th1/Th2 cytokines were examined on day 21 by ELISA. Cardiac function was improved in the two atorvastatin-treated groups compared with the untreated one. In atorvastatin groups, the histopathological severity of myocarditis was attenuated and the expression of MHC class II molecules on the 'nonprofessional' APC, the cardiomyocytes, was reduced. mRNA level of type IV CIITA promoter was downregulated in the statin-treated groups in a dosage-dependent manner, but levels of type I and III CIITA mRNA did not differ between the groups statistically. Levels of IFN-gamma and IL-2 increased, whereas levels of IL-4 and IL-10 decreased, in immunized rats from day three through day 21. Atorvastatin reversed these trends in the treated groups. Atorvastatin improves cardiac function and histopathology of the myocardium in EAM by inducing Th2-biased immune responses, and thus 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase blockade may be a promising new strategy for the treatment of cardiac autoimmune impairments. The underlying mechanisms may be related to downregulation of MHC class II Ag expression due to silencing of the CIITA mRNA transcription.",

Here we investigated the anti-proliferative effect of N6-isopentenyladenosine (i6A), an adenosine and isoprenoid derivative, in a thyroid cell system, FRTL-5 wild-type, and K-ras transformed KiMol cells. Addition of i6A to FRTL-5 cells caused a dose-dependent arrest of the G0-G1 cell phase transition associated with a reduction of cells in the S phase that was much more evident in KiMol cells. I6A arrested tumor cell proliferation by inhibiting farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS) and protein prenylation. Indeed the addition of farnesol reversed these effects and i6A affected protein prenylation, in particular lamin B processing. I6A effect was not mediated by the adenosine receptor but was due to a direct modulation of FPPS enzyme activity as a result of its uptake inside the cells. I6A inhibited FPPS activity more efficaciously in KiMol cells than in normal FRTL-5. Moreover, the i6A anti-proliferative effect was evaluated in vivo in a nude mouse xenograft model, where KiMol cells were implanted subcutaneously. Mice treated with i6A showed a drastic reduction in tumor volume. Our findings indicate that this isoprenoid end product might be used for antineoplastic therapy, an application emulating that of the lovastatin and/or farnesyl-transferase inhibitors",

In part, plasma LDL levels are dependent on cholesterol absorption in the intestine and the rate of intrinsic cholesterol synthesis. Therapy with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A-reductase inhibitors has often proven to be successful in reducing plasma LDL levels. However, a significant number of patients do not reach their target LDL levels despite statin therapy. As is reviewed, drugs that inhibit cholesterol absorption are a useful adjunct to lipid-lowering therapy by statins. This review discusses the mechanisms involved in intestinal absorption of cholesterol and its transport as potential targets of newer agents that affect cholesterol absorption. The use of bile acid sequestrants and esters of plant stanols, as well as other intestinally active agents for reducing plasma LDL levels, has been limited by side effects and difficulties in patient compliance. In contrast, the new selective cholesterol transporter inhibitor ezetimibe has been demonstrated to reduce plasma LDL alone or in combination with statins without significant adverse effects. In spite of the robust lipid-lowering data with ezetimibe, questions about clinical outcomes, safety, and efficacy in various combinations remain.",

A randomized, open study was performed on a total of 36 patients with type 2 diabetes and hypercholesterolemia. The patients were randomly assigned to a probucol group (500 mg/day, n = 18) or an atorvastatin group (10 mg/day, n = 18). During three months, total- and LDL-cholesterol decreased significantly in both groups. LDL-cholesterol was significantly lower in the atorvastatin group than probucol group. HDL-C decreased significantly in the probucol group and did not change in the atorvastatin group. 8-OHdG decreased significantly in both groups after 3 months; 12.4 +/- 7.5 to 8.1 +/- 4.2 ng/mg/Cr in the atorvastatin group (p < 0.05) and 12.3 +/- 8.8 to 6.8 +/- 2.6 ng/mg/Cr in the probucol group (p < 0.05), and these changes did not differ significantly between the two groups. But, in patients with high 8-OHdG levels (more than 10 ng/mg/Cr) before administration, urinary 8-OHdG decreased significantly from 19.5 +/- 4.9 to 9.2 +/- 3.4 ng/mg Cr (p < 0.01) in the atorvastatin group, and from 19.7 +/- 8.2 to 6.67 +/- 2.2 ng/mg Cr (p < 0.01) in the probucol group. Urinary 8-OHdG was significantly lower in the probucol group than in the atorvastatin group after the second and third months of administration (p < 0.05). These results suggest that while probucol and atorvastatin both reduce systemic oxidative stress, probucol might be the more useful in patients with strong oxidative stress.",

The syndrome has been given several names, including- the metabolic syndrome, the insulin resistance syndrome, the plurimetabolic syndrome, and the deadly quartet. With the formulation of NCEP/ATP III guidelines, some uniformity and standardization has occurred in the definition of metabolic syndrome and has been very useful for epidemiological purposes. The mechanisms underlying the metabolic syndrome are not fully known; however resistance to insulin stimulated glucose uptake seems to modify biochemical responses in a way that predisposes to metabolic risk factors. The clinical relevance of the metabolic syndrome is related to its role in the development of cardiovascular disease. Management of the metabolic syndrome involves patient-education and intervention at various levels. Weight reduction is one of the main stays of treatment. In this article we comprehensively discuss this syndrome- the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical relevance and management. The need to do a comprehensive review of this particular syndrome has arisen in view of the ever increasing incidence of this entity. Soon, metabolic syndrome will overtake cigarette smoking as the number one risk factor for heart disease among the US population.

Insulin resistance and resulting hyperinsulinemia have been implicated in the development of glucose intolerance (and progression to type 2 diabetes), hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, polycystic ovary syndrome, hypercoagulability and vascular inflammation, as well as the eventual development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease manifested as myocardial infarction, stroke and myriad end organ diseases. Conversely, treatment and consequent improvement of insulin resistance have been shown to result in better outcomes in virtually all of these conditions.", 
    "113": "The mevalonate pathway produces cholesterol and nonsterol isoprenoids, such as geranylgeraniol. In the brain, a fraction of cholesterol is metabolized in neurons by the enzyme cholesterol 24-hydroxylase, and this depletion activates the mevalonate pathway. Brains from mice lacking 24-hydroxylase excrete cholesterol more slowly, and the tissue compensates by suppressing the mevalonate pathway. Here we report that this suppression causes a defect in learning. 24-Hydroxylase knockout mice exhibit severe deficiencies in spatial, associative, and motor learning, and in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). Acute treatment of wild-type hippocampal slices with an inhibitor of the mevalonate pathway (a statin) also impairs LTP. The effects of statin treatment and genetic elimination of 24-hydroxylase on LTP are reversed by a 20-min treatment with geranylgeraniol but not by cholesterol. We conclude that cholesterol turnover in brain activates the mevalonate pathway and that a constant production of geranylgeraniol in a small subset of neurons is required for LTP and learning.", 
    "114": "The vasoconstricting peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1) has been associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) growth stimulation, and intimal thickening. ET-1 binds 2 receptor subtypes, endothelin A and B, and the ETA receptor mediates vasoconstriction and VSMC growth. This study aims to quantitatively assess arterial remodeling variables and compare them with changes in ET-1, ETA, and ETB expression in the internal mammary artery (IMA).", 
    "115": "Specimens from 55 coronary artery disease (CAD) patients (45 men, 10 women; mean age 65 years) and 14 control IMA specimens (from 7 men and 7 women; mean age 45 years) were collected. IMA cross sections were assessed by histochemical and immunohistochemical staining methods to quantify the levels of medionecrosis, fibrosis, VSMC growth, ET-1, ETA, ETB, and macrophage infiltration. The percentage area of medionecrosis in the patients was almost double that in the controls (31.85+/-14.52% versus 17.10+/-9.96%, P=0.0006). Total and type 1 collagen was significantly increased compared with controls (65.8+/-18.3% versus 33.7+/-13.7%, P=0.07, and 14.2+/-10.0% versus 4.8+/-2.8%, P=0.01, respectively). Despite ACE and/or statin therapy, ET-1 expression and cell cycling were significantly elevated in the patient IMAs relative to the controls (46.27+/-18.46 versus 8.56+/-8.42, P=0.0001, and 37.29+/-12.88 versus 11.06+/-8.18, P=0.0001, respectively). ETA and ETB staining was elevated in the patient vessels (46.88+/-11.52% versus 18.58+/-7.65%, P=0.0001, and 42.98+/-7.08% versus 34.73+/-5.20%, P=0.0067, respectively). A mild presence of macrophages was noted in all sections.",

    "117": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Western communities. Reliable indices of coronary risk assessment and targets for drug treatment are important to the management of patients. Although plasma LDL cholesterol is well established as a predictor of CAD, it may not be the best circulatory marker. Results from recent epidemiological studies and statin trials suggest that apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB), with or without apoA-I, is superior to LDL cholesterol in predicting coronary events. Measurements of apolipoproteins are internationally standardized, automated, cost-effective and more convenient and precise than those for LDL cholesterol. ApoB may also be preferable to the measurement of non-HDL cholesterol. Measurement of apolipoproteins (apoB and possibly apoA-I) should be routinely added to the routine lipid profile (cholesterol, triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) to assess the atherogenic potential of lipid disorders. This is particularly relevant to dyslipidaemias characterized by an elevation in plasma triglycerides. Apolipoproteins, especially apoB, could also replace the standard \"lipid profile\" as a target for therapy in at-risk patients.", 
    "118": "An increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) morbidity and mortality is associated with the metabolic syndrome, a condition characterized by the concomitant presence of several abnormalities, including abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance (with or without glucose intolerance or diabetes), microalbuminuria, prothrombotic, and proinflammatory states. Estimates of the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome indicate that this condition is now common and likely to increase dramatically over the coming decades, in parallel with greater rates of obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Risk factors for the metabolic syndrome are already present in obese children and adolescents. Thus, identifying and treating all affected individuals promptly and optimally are critical to ensure that this potentially challenging healthcare burden is minimized. Here, we review the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemias, and CHD risk. Although changes in lifestyle are fundamental to reducing many of the CHD risk factors associated with the metabolic syndrome, pharmacologic interventions also play an important role. Retrospective subanalyses of the effects of statins on coronary event rates and lipid levels in patients with the metabolic syndrome included in clinical trials indicate that these agents are beneficial in correcting the extensive lipid abnormalities that are frequently present in these individuals. However, the optimal management of metabolic syndrome dyslipidemia will depend on the outcomes of future prospective clinical trials. This review examines the underlying causes and prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and its impact on CHD morbidity and mortality and discusses the role of statins in optimizing its management.", 
    "119": "Macrovascular disease (MVD), especially coronary heart disease, is the most common cause of mortality in Type 2 diabetes. We assessed the association between demographic and clinical variables (particularly HbA1c) and prevalent MVD at time of enrollment into the VA Diabetes Trial (VADT), a 7-year randomized trial to determine whether intensive glycemic control will reduce risk of MVD events in older participants with established Type 2 diabetes.", 
    "120": "We compared the demographic, treatment, and clinical characteristics of participants with and without known MVD, then assessed the interaction of multiple variables with HbA1c. Logistic regression models evaluated the association between HbA1c quartiles and prevalence of MVD, adjusting for potentially confounding variables.", 
    "121": "Several variables were associated with prevalent MVD (age, duration of diabetes, insulin use but not daily dosage, smoking history, hypertension, BMI, Caucasian race, non-Hispanic ethnicity, lower HDL cholesterol, higher triglycerides, lower LDL cholesterol, and statin use). In univariate analysis, there was no association of HbA1c with MVD (mean: 9.4+/-1.46% in those with MVD, 9.5+/-1.58% in those without). Multivariate analyses found little confounding of the lack of association of HbA1c with MVD. Only adjustment for age produced a slight increase in the odds ratio, but only for the highest quartile of HbA1c.", 
    "122": "In this cross-sectional analysis, MVD was associated with a number of clinical and demographic variables but not with HbA1c. Determining whether intensive lowering of HbA1c will reduce the prospective rate of MVD events in this population of older participants with established Type 2 diabetes is the primary objective of our trial.", 
    "123": "Giant cell arteritis and Takayasu's arteritis are systemic vasculitides that cause inflammation of large arteries and their branches. Both have similar histology, but differ in their age of onset. Corticosteroids have been the mainstay of treatment for the past 50 years but are limited by the potential toxicity that may occur in almost 60% of patients. This limitation has lead to the investigation of alternative agents for the treatment of these diseases.", 
    "124": "Challenges in new drug development for APS include the controversy about the strength of association between aPL and thrombotic events, and unknown mechanism of aPL-induced thrombosis. In the long-term management of patients who have APS, controlled studies with warfarin alternatives (such as antiplatelet agents), the new anticoagulant agents (such as direct and indirect thrombin inhibitors), and newer therapeutic agents are vital. It is highly possible that the current \"antithrombotic\" approach to patients who are aPL-positive will be replaced by a \"more specifically targeted, anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory\" approach in the future.", 
    "125": "Statins are effective to reduce total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein fractions in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, they have an excellent safety profile. Besides cholesterol-lowering properties, statins have additional actions described in the present case report. The diverse effects of these drugs means that many patients with different disease entities, such as cardiovascular diseases, can benefit from their effects. However, the problem of so called \"class effect\" remains controversial. The question whether each drug within the group is equivalent appears important, as long as statins must be taken long-term and as the therapy affects patient quality of life and survival. To address this question, we present two renal transplant recipients treated with statins. The induction of pharmacokinetic tolerance and damage to hepatic cells during administration of statins is discussed. Presented data suggest that the choice of statin should be based on individual patient requirements and adapted to the individual treatment response.", 
    "126": "A low level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease; however, patients with low levels of HDL-C without raised low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are not currently eligible for lipid-lowering therapy. Many individuals with low levels of HDL-C have a combination of cardiovascular risk factors that include high LDL particle concentrations. Lowering LDL particle concentration and its surrogate measure, LDL-C, is an important approach to reducing cardiovascular risk. Statins are the most effective agents for lowering levels of LDL and can significantly increase levels of HDL-C. Extending statin therapy to patients with low levels of HDL-C but with LDL-C levels below target may have benefits for cardiovascular disease reduction in these patients.", 
    "127": "Statins have revolutionized the management of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with statin therapy have been shown to reduce significantly the risk of CVD in primary and secondary prevention trials. Recent evidence from clinical trials supports the concept that lower LDL-C levels, below current guideline targets, provide additional protection against cardiovascular (CV) events. In addition evidence is accumulating that increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and decreasing the level of chronic inflammation are important targets in CVD risk reduction. Recent studies have investigated the effectiveness of statins in terms of their ability to concomitantly reduce LDL-C, increase HDL-C and lower C-reactive protein (CRP). Results demonstrate that the more effective statins have beneficial effects on this triumvirate of potential treatment targets. Furthermore, the overall safety and tolerability profile is comparable among available statins. This paper examines recent data highlighting the role that statins and other lipid-lowering agents can play in this new treatment paradigm.", 
    "128": "In ecotoxicology, there is an increasing demand for sensitive sublethal endpoints. The primary aim of the present study was therefore to evaluate the relative sensitivity and usefulness of four sublethal endpoints - development time, body length, RNA content and growth rate - in the harpacticoid copepod Nitocra spinipes, using the reference molecule Simvastatin. Development time decreased significantly at low sublethal concentrations of Simvastatin (p < 0.001; F = 13.249; 0.16-1.6 microgL(-1)), while RNA content and body length increased significantly at 0.16 microgL(-1) (p < 0.001; F = 6.13) and 1.6 microgL(-1) (p < 0.01; F = 2.365), respectively. The growth rate increased significantly at 0.16-5 microgL(-1) (p<0.01-0.001). Hence, significant responses of growth-related traits were observed already at 0.16 microgL(-1), which is about 5,000 times lower than the acute toxicity (96 h-LC(50): 810 microgL(-1)). These results show that all assayed endpoints are very sensitive and indicate that current ecotoxicity testing used for environmental protection activities may underestimate the risk for harpacticoid copepods and most likely for other small invertebrates, when relying exclusively on acute toxicity measurements.", 
    "129": "Calcium channel blockers and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are widely used for the management of hypertension and dyslipidemia, respectively. The use of these agents in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease remains largely based on their actions in lowering blood pressure and lipids. Recent clinical trials, however, indicate that certain members of these two drug classes may slow progression of disease to an extent that cannot be solely attributed to risk factor reduction. The proposed mechanisms for such pleiotropic actions include enhancement of endothelial-dependent nitric oxide bioavailability, anti-inflammatory activity, and inhibition of oxidative stress. To understand the basis for such effects, along with potential synergies, we will review the basic and clinical evidence that indicate a broader opportunity for treatment and protection of cardiovascular events by atheroprotection with these agents beyond risk factor management.", 
    "130": "Besides classical risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia and hypertension, chronic subacute inflammation has recently been recognized as an important force driving the development of atherosclerosis, the most common underlying cause of myocardial infarction and stroke. There is compelling evidence that a disturbance of cholesterol homeostasis contributes to the development of a chronic inflammatory state and that inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase (statins) may dampen inappropriate inflammatory responses. We review the evidence and suggest mechanisms by which dietary cholesterol can induce an atherogenic inflammatory response in liver and vessel wall, with particular emphasis on the time course of this inflammatory response during atherogenesis and the interplay between these tissues. We discuss how statins interfere in this process, and whether they may reduce chronic subacute inflammation via a) their cholesterol-lowering effect, and/or b) their cholesterol-independent (pleiotropic) vasculoprotective activities. Recent studies performed in (humanized) animal models allow us to distinguish the lipid-lowering-dependent from the lipid-lowering-independent functions of statins. Using these data, we discuss the degree to which the lipid-lowering-dependent and lipid-lowering-independent effects of statins contribute to a reduction of inflammation, allowing estimation of the relevance of pleiotropic statin effects for the human situation.", 
    "131": "Chronic kidney diseases frequently advance to end-stage renal failure, and the number of patients affected is steadily increasing worldwide. At the molecular level, progression of renal insufficiency correlates closely with ongoing pathological matrix protein expansion (i.e., renal fibrosis), in a manner independent of the underlying disorder. Overactivity of the renin-angiotensin system and of the TGF-beta system have been identified as key mediators of kidney matrix accumulation, and are principal targets in the management of chronic renal disease. This review provides a recent overview of the therapeutic options that are clinically established, and of novel molecular strategies that will approach clinical practice in the near future.", 
    "132": "Reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) concentration has become the primary goal and a standard of care in the practice of cholesterol management. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statins, are the most frequently prescribed lipid lowering agents on the market. As more information is learned through the results of clinical trials, LDL goals become more stringent and difficult to attain. Large doses of high-potency statins, sometimes given in combination with other lipid-lowering agents, are frequently necessary to achieve these goals. As a result, the frequency of adverse effects from statin therapy may be expected to increase, and less common adverse effects may occur more often. As statins are used more aggressively, rare and possibly dangerous adverse effects must be identified, especially those that are becoming more frequently encountered. Increased awareness may lead to earlier diagnosis and management of diseases that may be caused by the statins. We describe a 58-year-old man who was hospitalized with idiopathic pancreatitis 4 months after starting simvastatin therapy. His oral drug therapy was withheld, and he was treated with bowel rest. The patient was discharged on hospital day 5, and his oral drug regimen, including simvastatin, was resumed. He was admitted again 16 months later with a second diagnosis of acute pancreatitis and was discharged after 3 days of bowel rest with no oral drug therapy. Simvastatin was restarted on discharge, but the patient stopped taking it after experiencing muscle soreness and weakness in his arms. He recalled having similar arm pain that preceded the previous episode of acute pancreatitis. All other causes of the pancreatitis had been ruled out; thus, the correlation between simvastatin-induced myalgia and onset of acute pancreatitis on two separate occasions made simvastatin the suspected instigating agent. Pancreatitis is a rare adverse effect of statin therapy, but it has been documented in several case reports involving most of the statins. Continued reporting is necessary to increase awareness of this rare adverse effect of simvastatin so that it may be promptly managed or avoided in the future.",

Atorvastatin significantly reduced the production of epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide-78, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (p<0.001 to p<0.05) in a concentration-dependent manner without affecting basal production of interleukin-10, fibroblast growth factor, and granulocyte colony stimulating factor.

The possibility of a drug-drug interaction between certain statins and clopidogrel has been extensively investigated in the literature recently. Investigators have proposed that the use of statins that are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system may diminish the conversion of clopidogrel to its active form by inhibiting the CYP3A4 isoenzyme. This inhibition could result in a decreased antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel, which could translate into an increased risk of cardiovascular events.",

In addition to their cholesterol-lowering properties, statins exert a number of so-called 'pleiotropic', vasculoprotective actions that include improvement of endothelial function, increased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, antioxidant properties, stabilisation of atherosclerotic plaques, regulation of progenitor cells, inhibition of inflammatory responses and immunomodulatory actions. Pleiotropic actions of statins may have potential clinical impact in vascular disease beyond cholesterol lowering. The ongoing Justification for the Use of statins in Primary prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER), for example, tests the effects of statins in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease among patients with low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). Additionally, previous studies have shown that although cholesterol is not an established stroke risk factor, statin therapy is associated with a reduction in the incidence of strokes. It is known that sudden withdrawal of statin treatment may acutely impair vascular function and increase morbidity and mortality in patients with vascular disease. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory effects of statins may have clinical impact in a number of non-vascular conditions including multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis.",

    "162": "In this open-label, randomized, 2-part, 2-period crossover study, 96 healthy subjects were randomly assigned to participate in each part of the study (Part I or II), with each part consisting of 2 single-dose treatment periods separated by a 14-day washout. Part I consisted of Treatments A (EZE 10 mg + SIMVA 10 mg) and B (EZE/SIMVA 10/10 mg/mg) and Part II consisted of Treatments C (EZE 10 mg + SIMVA 80 mg) and D (EZE/SIMVA 10/80 mg/mg). Blood samples were collected up to 96 hours post-dose for determination of ezetimibe, total ezetimibe (ezetimibe + ezetimibe glucuronide), simvastatin and simvastatin acid (the most prevalent active metabolite of simvastatin) concentrations. Ezetimibe and simvastatin acid AUC(0-last) were predefined as primary endpoints and ezetimibe and simvastatin acid Cmax were secondary endpoints. Bioequivalence was achieved if 90% confidence intervals (CI) for the geometric mean ratios (GMR) (single tablet/coadministration) of AUC(0-last) and Cmax fell within prespecified bounds of (0.80, 1.25).", 
    "163": "The GMRs of the AUC(0-last) and Cmax for ezetimibe and simvastatin acid fell within the bioequivalence limits (0.80, 1.25). EZE/ SIMVA and EZE + SIMVA were generally well tolerated.", 
    "164": "The lowest and highest dosage strengths of EZE/SIMVA tablet were bioequivalent to the individual drug components administered together. Given the exact weight multiples of the EZE/SIMVA tablet and linear pharmacokinetics of simvastatin across the marketed dose range, bioequivalence of the intermediate tablet strengths (EZE/SIMVA 10/20 mg/mg and EZE/SIMVA 10/40 mg/mg) was inferred, although these dosages were not tested directly. These results indicate that the safety and efficacy profile of EZE + SIMVA coadministration therapy can be applied to treatment with the EZE/SIMVA tablet across the clinical dose range.", 
    "165": "Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium have been demonstrated in numerous clinical trials to be highly effective in lowering blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, respectively, and in reducing cardiovascular events. A novel single-pill therapy containing amlodipine and atorvastatin is currently available in the USA and has been approved for use in parts of Europe, Asia and Latin America. This medication retains the proven clinical safety and efficacy of amlodipine and atorvastatin when administered separately. However, it reduces the pill burden associated with coadministration of an antihypertensive agent and a statin for hypertensive patients with additional cardiovascular risk factors. This single-pill therapy may increase patient adherence to these medications and thus improve the simultaneous management of two important cardiovascular risk factors. This strategy may also improve clinical outcomes. An overview of the rationale for the development and use of amlodipine/atorvastatin single-pill therapy in hypertensive patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors and the latest data from clinical trials are presented in this article.",

Therefore, we compared the effects of these therapies either alone or in combination on plasma soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L). This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial with three treatment arms (each 2 months) and two washout periods (each 2 months). Forty-seven hypertensive, hypercholesterolemic patients were given simvastatin 20mg and placebo, simvastatin 20mg and losartan 100mg, or losartan 100mg and placebo daily during each 2 month treatment period. Simvastatin alone did not significantly reduce sCD40L levels relative to baseline measurements when the entire cohort was analyzed. However, simvastatin significantly reduced sCD40L levels from 5.10+/-0.34 to 3.07+/-0.43ng/ml (P=0.002) in a subgroup of 18 patients with high baseline sCD40L levels >2.95ng/ml. Combined therapy or losartan alone significantly decreased plasma sCD40L levels relative to baseline measurements by 14+/-7% (P=0.001) and 13+/-10% (P=0.001), respectively. These decreases were significantly greater than those observed with simvastatin alone (P=0.023 by ANOVA). Significant inverse correlations between baseline sCD40L levels and percent changes in sCD40L levels were observed (r=-0.456, P=0.001 after simvastatin alone; r=-0.476, P<0.001 after combined therapy; r=-0.451, P=0.002 after losartan alone). Losartan alone or combined therapy significantly reduced plasma sCD40L levels more than simvastatin alone in our subjects. Simvastatin, losartan and combined therapy significantly reduced sCD40L to the greatest extent in patients with high baseline sCD40L levels.",

To evaluate the mechanism for hypocholesterolemic effect of n-3 fatty acids containing milk formulation, we fed male Wistar rats with spray-dried milk containing linseed oil (LSO) (source of LNA) or fish oil (FO) (source of EPA+DHA) for 8 weeks. Feeding n-3 fatty acid containing milk formulation lowered the hepatic 3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG Co A) activity by 17-22% compared to rats given control diet devoid of n-3 fatty acids. The cholesterol level in liver microsomes was found to be decreased by 16% and 20%, respectively, in LSO and FO containing formulation fed rats. The bile flow was enhanced to an extent of 19-23% in experimental groups compared to control animals. The biliary cholesterol and phospholipid secretion was increased to an extent of 49-55% and 140-146%, respectively, in rats fed n-3 fatty acid containing formulation. The increase in the total bile acids secretion in bile was mainly reflected on an increase in the levels of taurine conjugated bile acids. These results indicated that n-3 fatty acid containing spray-dried milk formulation would bring about the hypocholesterolemic effect by lowering HMG Co A reductase activity in liver and by increasing the secretion of bile constituents.",

Solubility in various vehicles was determined. The self-microemulsification efficiency was assessed, such as self-microemulsification time, stability, particle size and zeta potential. SMEDDS containing atorvastatin, non-ionic surfactant and lipid were prepared. Droplet size/distributions and zeta potential of the resultant microemulsion were determined.

Statin therapy, initially developed to modify blood lipid concentrations, has also been shown to have potentially important pleiotropic effects, including a reduction in CRP concentrations. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated conflicting results regarding the benefits associated with intensively lowering LDL cholesterol. An analysis of these results suggests that the different effects of specific statins on CRP concentrations may be an important determinant of the observed overall benefit associated with therapy. These studies together prove that while lowering LDL is beneficial, lowering LDL and CRP is better.",

From multivariate analyses, we found independent inverse associations between counts of cultured EPCs and body mass index, mean arterial pressure, and history of cardiovascular disease. Statin use was associated with greater EPC counts, whereas patients receiving azathioprine or angiotensin II receptor treatment had lower EPC counts (all P<0.01).", 
    "179": "This study suggests negative associations in KTR between EPC counts and body mass index, and blood pressure, whereas statin use was associated with greater EPC counts.

    "180": "Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), both zinc-binding endopeptidases, are abundantly expressed in ruptured and eroded plaques in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). The adhesion molecule CD-40 ligand (CD40L), expressed on activated platelets and T-lymphocytes, can activate metalloproteinases and thereby promote plaque-rupture. N-3 fatty acids, through their anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic properties, might reduce the levels of these proatherosclerotic markers and thereby the development of ACS. 300 patients were randomized on day 4 to 6 following an acute myocardial infarction (MI) to receive either 4 g of n-3 fatty acids or a similar daily dose of corn oil for at least one year. We compared levels of PAPP-A, MMP-9 and sCD-40 L at baseline and 12 months in each group, and also looked for inter-group changes. In the omega-3 group, the median level of PAPP-A rose from 0.47 mU/l to 0.56 mU/l (p < 0.001). In the same group, sCD-40 L decreased from a mean baseline value of 5.19 ng/ml to 2.45 ng/ml (p < 0.001) and MMP-9 decreased nonsignificantly from 360.50 ng/ml to 308.00 ng/ml. Corresponding values for the corn oil group were 0.54 mU/l to 0.59 mU/l for PAPP-A (p = 0.007), 5.27 ng/ml to 2.84 ng/ml for sCD-40 L (p < 0.001) and 430.00 ng/ml to 324.00 ng/ml for MMP-9 (p = ns), respectively. In conclusion; both interventions resulted in a significant rise in PAPP-A, a significant decrease in sCD40L and a non-significant decrease in MMP-9 after 12 months of treatment in MI survivors. No inter-group differences were noted.",

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among patients with CKD and reducing its risk in this population is an important priority. Dyslipidemia is almost always present when proteinuria is above 3 gr/24 hours. Roughly two thirds of all patients with end-stage renal failure and kidney transplants suffer from dyslipidemia and should receive lipid-lowering therapy, as suggested by recent Afssaps (French drug agency) and NKF-K/DOQI (National Kidney Foundation-Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative) guidelines. We reviewed recent studies on efficacy, tolerability and prescription recommendations of statins in CKD and renal transplant patients.",

On the other hand, large-scale randomized clinical trials among CKD (4D) and renal transplant (ALERT) patients do not demonstrate that statins significantly decrease rates of cardiovascular disease. They have a beneficial effect on proteinuria and lower the rate of kidney function deterioration in patients with dyslipidemia. Early introduction of a statin in transplant patients did not lead to improved kidney function or prevent loss of the graft. Although most statins are not excreted by the kidneys, the dosage of some must be adapted in CKD patients because of pharmacokinetic modifications induced by renal impairment.", 
    "184": "Statins at appropriately adapted doses have the same efficacy in CKD patients as in subjects with normal kidney function, and tolerance is not a problem. Their effectiveness in cardiovascular prevention in this population has not been demonstrated to date.

The 7 remaining children were responders. Serum noncholesterol sterol ratios (10(2) x mmol/mol of cholesterol), surrogate estimates of cholesterol absorption (cholestanol, campesterol, sitosterol) and synthesis (desmosterol and lathosterol), were studied at study baseline (on plant stanol esters) and during combination therapy with pravastatin and plant stanol esters.", 
    "187": "Pravastatin decreased the serum levels of cholesterol and cholesterol synthesis markers, and increased the ratios of cholesterol absorption markers. Compared with the responders, the nonresponders had higher study baseline (on plant stanol esters) serum cholesterol concentrations (299 +/- 39 vs 251 +/- 35 mg/dL [7.7 +/- 1.0 vs 6.5 +/- 0.9 mmol/L]; P <.001) and higher respective ratios of campesterol (371 +/- 99 vs 277 +/- 67 10(2) x mmol/mol of cholesterol; P = .049) and sitosterol (176 +/- 37 vs 126 +/- 24 10(2) x mmol/mol of cholesterol; P = .008).

In this prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end-point evaluation trial, patients were randomly assigned to receive a high dose of atorvastatin (80 mg/day; n = 4439), or an usual dose of simvastatin (20 mg/day, titrated up to 40 mg/day if necessary; n = 4449). During treatment, mean LDL cholesterol levels were 104 mg/dl in the simvastatin group and 81 mg/dl in the atorvastatin group (p < 0.001). After a median follow-up of 4.8 years, no significant difference was observed in the primary outcome of major coronary events (defined as coronary death, confirmed nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, or cardiac arrest with resuscitation), but the risk of other composite secondary end points (i.e., major cardiovascular events, all cardiovascular events, all coronary events) was statistically reduced in the atorvastatin group compared to the simvastatin group. There were no differences in cardiovascular or all-cause mortality between the two groups. In conclusion, patients with myocardial infarction may benefit from intensive lowering of LDL cholesterol without an increase in noncardiovascular mortality or other serious adverse reactions.", 
    "190": "The production of biomass and lovastatin by spore-initiated submerged fermentations of Aspergillus terreus ATCC 20542 was shown to depend on the age of the spores used for inoculation. Cultures started from older spores produced significantly higher titers of lovastatin. For example, the lovastatin titer increased by 52% when the spore age at inoculation rose from 9 to 16 days. The lovastatin titer for a spore age of 16 days was 186.5+/-20.1 mg L(-1). The time to sporulation on surface cultures was sensitive to the light exposure history of the fungus and the spore inoculation concentration levels. A light exposure level of 140 muE m(-2 )s(-1) and a spore concentration of 1,320 spore cm(-2) produced the greatest extent of sporulation within about 50 h of inoculation. Sporulation was slowed in the dark and with diluted inoculants. A rigorous analysis of the data of statistically designed experiments showed the above observations to be highly reproducible.",

Apolipoprotein B levels are reduced by statins and are a stronger predictor of CHD than total and LDL cholesterol in patients both on and off statins.
