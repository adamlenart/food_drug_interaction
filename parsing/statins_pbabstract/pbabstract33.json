    "0": "Plasma levels of the inflammatory biomarker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) predict vascular risk with an effect estimate as large as that of total or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Further, randomized trial data addressing hsCRP have been central to understanding the anti-inflammatory effects of statin therapy and have consistently demonstrated on-treatment hsCRP levels to be as powerful a predictor of residual cardiovascular risk as on-treatment levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Yet, although hsCRP is clinically useful as a biomarker for risk prediction, most mechanistic studies suggest that CRP itself is unlikely to be a target for intervention. Moving upstream in the inflammatory cascade from CRP to interleukin (IL)-6 to IL-1 provides novel therapeutic opportunities for atheroprotection that focus on the central IL-6 signaling system and ultimately on inhibition of the IL-1\u03b2-producing NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome. Cholesterol crystals, neutrophil extracellular traps, atheroprone flow, and local tissue hypoxia activate the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome. As such, a unifying concept of hsCRP as a downstream surrogate biomarker for upstream IL-1\u03b2 activity has emerged. From a therapeutic perspective, small ischemia studies show reductions in acute-phase hsCRP production with the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra and the IL-6 receptor blocker tocilizumab. A phase IIb study conducted among diabetic patients at high vascular risk indicates that canakinumab, a human monoclonal antibody that targets IL-1\u03b2, markedly reduces plasma levels of IL-6, hsCRP, and fibrinogen with little change in atherogenic lipids. Canakinumab in now being tested as a method to prevent recurrent cardiovascular events in a randomized trial of 10 065 post-myocardial infarction patients with elevated hsCRP that is fully enrolled and due to complete in 2017. Clinical trials using alternative anti-inflammatory agents active against the CRP/IL-6/IL-1 axis, including low-dose methotrexate and colchicine, are being explored. If successful, these trials will close the loop on the inflammatory hypothesis of atherosclerosis and serve as examples of how fundamental biologic principles can be translated into personalized medical practice.", 
    "1": "A 95% confidence interval (CI) in an updated meta-analysis may not have the expected 95% coverage. If a meta-analysis is simply updated with additional data, then the resulting 95% CI will be wrong because it will not have accounted for the fact that the earlier meta-analysis failed or succeeded to exclude the null. This situation can be avoided by using the likelihood ratio (LR) as a measure of evidence that does not depend on type-1 error. We show how an LR-based approach, first advanced by Goodman, can be used in a meta-analysis to pool data from separate studies to quantitatively assess where the total evidence points. The method works by estimating the log-likelihood ratio (LogLR) function from each study. Those functions are then summed to obtain a combined function, which is then used to retrieve the total effect estimate, and a corresponding 'intrinsic' confidence interval. Using as illustrations the CAPRIE trial of clopidogrel versus aspirin in the prevention of ischemic events, and our own meta-analysis of higher potency statins and the risk of acute kidney injury, we show that the LR-based method yields the same point estimate as the traditional analysis, but with an intrinsic confidence interval that is appropriately wider than the traditional 95% CI. The LR-based method can be used to conduct both fixed effect and random effects meta-analyses, it can be applied to old and new meta-analyses alike, and results can be presented in a format that is familiar to a meta-analytic audience.", 
    "2": "Background. \u2003Immune activation has been implicated in the excess mortality in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, due to cardiovascular diseases and malignancies. Statins may modulate this immune activation. We assessed the capacity of rosuvastatin to mitigate immune activation in treatment-naive HIV-infected patients. Methods. \u2003In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study, we explored the effects of 8 weeks of rosuvastatin 20 mg in treatment-naive male HIV-infected patients (n = 28) on immune activation markers: neopterin, soluble Toll-like receptor (TLR)2, sTLR4, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1Ra, IL-18, d-dimer, highly sensitive C-reactive protein, and CD38 and/or human leukocyte antigen-DR expression on T cells. Baseline data were compared with healthy male controls (n = 10). Furthermore, the effects of rosuvastatin on HIV-1 RNA, CD4/CD8 T-cell count, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were examined and side effects were registered. Results. \u2003T-cell activation levels were higher in patients than in controls. Patients had higher levels of circulating IL-18, sTLR2, and neopterin (all P < .01). Twenty patients completed the study. Rosuvastatin increased the CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio (P = .02). No effect on other markers was found. Conclusions. \u2003Patients infected with HIV had higher levels of circulating neopterin, IL-18, sTLR2, and T-cell activation markers. Rosuvastatin had a small but significant positive effect on CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio, but no influence on other markers of T-cell activation and innate immunity was identified (The Netherlands National Trial Register [NTR] NTR 2349, http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/index.asp).", 
    "3": "There is a critical need for alternative, potent agents that can reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in patients with heterozygous familial hyperlipidemia and statin intolerance and those not reaching lipid-lowering treatment goals who are at high risk for cardiovascular (CV) events. The first proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor was approved in July 2015 by the US Food and Drug Administration as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hyperlipidemia or clinical atherosclerotic CV disease, who require additional lowering of LDL-C levels. In clinical trials, PCSK9 inhibitors have been shown to reduce LDL-C levels by as much as 60% to 70% when administered as monotherapy or as an add-on treatment to statins and other lipid-lowering therapies. In studies of PCSK9 genetic mutations, loss of function in the PCSK9 allele was associated with a relative decrease of 88% in the risk for atherosclerotic CV events during 15 years of patient follow-up. The use of PCSK9 inhibitors may eventually support the LDL-C hypothesis that the lower the LDL-C level, the lower the CV risk. Although some recent clinical practice guidelines have deemphasized the importance of numeric LDL-C targets, many clinicians are reluctant to discard them, and this position is supported by recent clinical evidence. We eagerly await the results of the ODYSSEY, FOURIER, and SPIRE clinical outcome trials, which we anticipate will provide further validation that \"lower is better\" with respect to reducing LDL-C levels and improving clinical outcomes.",

Due to cost considerations, self-reported outcomes are routinely collected in lieu of expensive diagnostic tests in large-scale prospective investigations such as the Women's Health Initiative. However, self-reported outcomes are subject to imperfect sensitivity and specificity. Using a semiparametric likelihood-based approach, we present time to event models to estimate the association of one or more covariates with a error-prone, self-reported outcome. We present simulation studies to assess the effect of error in self-reported outcomes with regard to bias in the estimation of the regression parameter of interest. We apply the proposed methods to prospective data from 152,830 women enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative to evaluate the effect of statin use with the risk of incident diabetes mellitus among postmenopausal women.

Patients and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. Delirium was assessed with the validated Confusion Assessment Method for intensive care. Cognitive function was assessed with tests for executive function, language, verbal reasoning and concept formation, and working, immediate, and delayed memory. We defined cognitive impairment as having one of these domains at least two SDs below population norms or at least two domains at least 1\u00b75 SDs below norms.

This led to overproliferation of tracheal tissue, formation of tumor-like growths, and animal lethality. Screening a library of FDA-approved drugs identified several that improved overall animal survival. We explored two hits: the MEK inhibitor trametinib and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor fluvastatin. Oral administration of these drugs inhibited Ras and PI3K pathway activity, respectively; in addition, fluvastatin inhibited protein prenylation downstream of HMG-CoA reductase to promote survival. Combining drugs led to synergistic suppression of tumor formation and rescue lethality; similar synergy was observed in human A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells. Notably, fluvastatin acted both within transformed cells and also to reduce whole-body trametinib toxicity in flies. Our work supports and provides further context for exploring the potential of combining statins with MAPK inhibitors such as trametinib to improve overall therapeutic index.",

However, these proangiogenic effects were not observed in diabetic mice that had been treated with ezetimibe. In addition, the number of ischemia-triggered endothelial progenitor cells in peripheral blood was significantly enhanced in the wild-type mice and in the diabetic mice being treated with simvastatin, but not in those being treated with ezetimibe, after ischemic surgery. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity as determined by acetylcholine-stimulated vasorelaxation recovered notably in diabetic mice that were treated with simvastatin but was not improved by ezetimibe (n\u00a0= 6, each group). Moreover, simvastatin led to a significant upregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation; vascular endothelial growth factor protein levels in ischemic tissues were also increased. By contrast, administration of ezetimibe did not produce these effects.",

The established method was rapid with high extraction recovery and successfully applied for the determination of simvastatin in plasma of 16 healthy volunteers. The results demonstrated that the MRT(0-\u221e), T1/2 and Tmax value of simvastatin were significantly decreased, while the AUC(0-t) and Cmax values of smivastatin were increased by SBP.

However, more than half of the patients have not been able to receive the beneficial effects of this treatment.The reverse cholesterol transport pathway has several potential anti-atherogenic properties. An important approach to HDL-targeted therapy is the optimization of HDL cholesterol levels and function in the blood to enhance the removal of circulating cholesterol and to prevent or mitigate inflammation that causes atherosclerosis. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors increase HDL cholesterol levels in humans, but whether they reduce the risk of atherosclerotic diseases is unknown. HDL therapies using HDL mimetics, including reconstituted HDL, apolipoprotein (Apo) A-IMilano, ApoA-I mimetic peptides, or full-length ApoA-I, are highly effective in animal models. In particular, the Fukuoka University ApoA-I-mimetic peptide (FAMP) effectively removes cholesterol via the ABCA1 transporter and acts as an anti-atherosclerotic agent by enhancing the biological functions of HDL without elevating HDL cholesterol levels.Our literature review suggests that HDL mimetics have significant atheroprotective potential and are a therapeutic tool for atherosclerotic diseases.",

The latter was included to compare the effects of atorvastatin with dietary lipid lowering. Fifteen weeks later, the mice were sacrificed. CholW, but not atorvastatin, reduced plasma cholesterol. Survival increased from 50% to 90% both in cholW and atorvastatin treated mice. CholW as well as atorvastatin treatment increased plaque collagen and fibrous cap thickness, but they did not affect the amount of plaque macrophages and T cells. MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity was significantly lower and the expression of MMP-12, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 was strongly reduced in both treatment groups. Blood monocytes and neutrophils returned to baseline levels (ApoE(-/-) mice before the onset of atherosclerosis). Importantly, atorvastatin but not cholW significantly reduced coronary stenosis (from 50 to 28%) and the occurrence of MI (from 43 to 10%). In conclusion, independent of cholesterol lowering, atorvastatin significantly reduced mortality, plaque vulnerability and inflammation to the same extent as cholW.

It could suppress the stimulation effect of high-fat diet on the transcription of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) and p65, and counteract the downregulation of CYP7A1 and LDLR. In addition, the results of luciferase reporter assay and Western blot showed that the transcriptional activity of HMGCR promoter was inhibited by Zhongtian hawthorn ethanol extract in a dose-dependent manner, while overexpression of p65 could reverse this transcriptional repression effect. These results suggested that Zhongtian hawthorn could provide health benefits by counteracting the high-fat diet-induced hypercholesteolemic and hyperlipidemic effects in vivo, and the mechanism underlying this event was mainly dependent on the suppressive effect of Zhongtian hawthorn ethanol extract on the transcription of HMGCR via nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) signal pathway. Therefore, this novel cultivar of hawthorn cultivar which has much bigger fruits, early bearing, high yield, cold resistance, and drought resistance, might be considered as a good alternative to Shan-Zha and has great value in the food and medicine industry. In addition, to our best knowledge, this is also the first report that the extract of Crataegus could suppress the transcription of HMGCR via NF-\u03baB signal pathway.", 
    "45": "Non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NC-CAH), one of the most common genetic disorders, is often associated with the presence of hyperandrogenism. Recently both simvastatin and metformin were found to reduce plasma steroid hormone levels in this disorder. This study included 8 women with NC-CAH and diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance, as well as 12 matched women with similar glucose metabolism abnormalities but normal adrenal function. Both groups of women, receiving metformin for at least 6 months, were then treated with simvastatin (20\u2009mg daily) for the following 12 weeks. Compared to patients with normal adrenal function, metformin-treated women with NC-CAH showed increased plasma levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone, total testosterone, free testosterone, androstenedione and DHEA-S. Simvastatin reduced total and LDL cholesterol levels in both patients with NC-CAH and normal adrenal function. Moreover, in the former group of women, statin therapy decreased plasma levels of testosterone, free testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate and tended to reduce 17-hydroxyprogesterone. Our results suggest that metformin-statin combination therapy may be useful in the management of symptomatic women with NC-CAH.",

Secondly, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in 2011 approved the first health claim for pharmacologically active RYR dietary supplements.

Statins have also been demonstrated to inhibit the migration of leukocytes across vascular endothelium into tissues. Although most research on the immune effects of statins has been conducted in the context of cardiovascular, rheumatological, or metabolic disease, various studies have shown that statins may have a significant impact on intestinal immunity and mucosal inflammation.

At 26 weeks, low dose streptozotocin (15 mg/kg, i.p.) was given to half of the rats. All rats were followed up till 48 weeks. PPHTg developed as early as week 2 in Group B and stabilized by week 14. Group B displayed highest PPHTg compared to other groups. Atorvastatin treatment (Group D) abolished PPHTg which became comparable to controls, pioglitazone treatment partially blunted PPHTg resulting in intermediate PPHTg. Group B with highest PPHTg showed highest subsequent IR, glucose intolerance (GI) and highest incidence of prediabetes at week 26 and diabetes at week 34 and 46 compared to other groups. Group D rats displayed lower IR, GI, low incidence of prediabetes and diabetes at these time points compared to Groups B and C. ROC analysis showed that triglyceride area under the curve of each time point significantly predicts the risk of diabetes. Present study provides the evidence that PPHTg predicts the development of IR, GI and T2DM in rat model of diet induced T2DM.",

The relationship between T2DM and statins is further complicated since these drugs can cause new onset diabetes (NOD) although there is an overall benefit in terms of preventing vascular events [1, 2].

Yet, the stent surface material directly interacts with cascades of biological processes leading to an activation of cellular defense mechanisms. To prevent adverse clinical implications, to date almost every patient with a coronary artery disease is treated with statins. Besides their clinical benefit, statins exert a number of pleiotropic effects on endothelial cells (ECs). Since maintenance of EC function and reduction of uncontrolled smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation represents a challenge for new generation DES, we investigated the effect of atorvastatin (ATOR) on human coronary artery cells grown on biodegradable polymers. Our results show a cell type-dependent effect of ATOR on ECs and SMCs. We observed polymer-dependent changes in IC50 values and an altered ATOR-uptake leading to an attenuation of statin-mediated effects on SMC growth. We conclude that the selected biodegradable polymers negatively influence the anti-proliferative effect of ATOR on SMCs. Hence, the process of developing new polymers for DES coating should involve the characterization of material-related changes in mechanisms of drug actions.",

However, further clinical studies suggested an improved outcome associated with their use in hematological malignancies. In particular, a survival benefit was reported for patients with follicular lymphoma on statins. Our objective was to assess the outcome of follicular lymphoma patients treated in the PRIMA study with immunochemotherapy according to the use of statins. Among the 1,217 patients enrolled in the PRIMA study, 1,135 were included in the present study. Concomitant treatments at registration were available for all patients. Among those 1,135 patients, 119 were on statins (10.5%) at diagnosis. Adverse events frequencies, event-free survival (EFS), time to next lymphoma treatment (TTNLT), time to next chemotherapy (TTNCT), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated according to the use of statins. The rates of overall and specific cardiovascular adverse events between the two groups of patients were comparable both during induction and maintenance. Outcome in terms of response rates or EFS, TTNLT, TTNCT, and OS were similar regardless of the use of statins (P\u2009=\u20090.57, P\u2009=\u20090.85, P\u2009=\u20090.30, and P\u2009=\u20090.43, respectively) in univariate analysis and after further adjustments for potential confounding factors in multivariate analysis.

The goal of the current research is to assess the efficacy of combined treatment of CoQ10 with Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia induced by high-fat diet in SD rats. 4-week-old Sprague-Dawley male rats were fed normal diet or high-fat diet for 6 weeks. Then, rats were treated with either Statin or Statin with various dosages of CoQ10 (30, 90 or 270 mg/kg/day, p.o.) for another 6 weeks. Compared to Statin onlytreatment, CoQ10 supplementation significantlyreduced creatine kinase and aspartate aminotransferase levels in serum which are markers for myopathy. Moreover, CoQ10 supplementation with Statin further reduced total fat, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. In contrast, the levels of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and CoQ10 were increased in the CoQ10 co-treated group. These results indicate that CoQ10 treatment not only reduces the side effects of Statin, but also has an anti-obesity effect. Therefore an intake of supplementary CoQ10 is helpful for solving problem of obese metabolism, so the multiple prescription of CoQ10 makes us think a possibility that can be solved in being contiguous to the obesity problem, a sort of disease of the obese metabolism.",
