We investigated the effect of current statin use on acute respiratory infections in primary care. Data from anonymized electronic medical records of persons aged 45 years were examined for statin use, chronic morbidity, respiratory diagnoses, vaccination procedures, and immune suppression. Logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for statin users vs. non-users in respiratory infection outcomes. A total of 329 881 person-year observations included 18% statin users and 46% influenza vaccinees. Adjusted ORs for statin users vs. non-users were: influenza-like illness, 1.05 (95% CI 0.92-1.20); acute bronchitis, 1.08 (95% CI 1.01-1.15); pneumonia, 0.91 (95% CI 0.73-1.13); all acute respiratory infections, 1.03 (95% CI 0.98-1.07); and urinary tract infections, 0.91 (95% CI 0.85-0.98). We found no benefit in respiratory infection outcomes attributable to statin use, although uniformly higher ORs in non-vaccinated statin users might suggest synergism between statins and influenza vaccination.",

    "2": "Study participants were eight patients with full PTSD, eight patients with subsyndromal PTSD, and 31 patients with no PTSD who were diagnosed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) interview after a mean of 32+/-8 months after MI. Levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) were determined in plasma.", 
    "3": "Patients with full PTSD had lower HDL-C than patients with subsyndromal PTSD (P = 0.044) and those with no PTSD (P = 0.014) controlling for sex, body mass index, and statin equivalent dosage. Moreover, HDL-C levels were inversely associated with PTSD total symptoms (r = -0.33, P = 0.027), re-experiencing symptoms (r = -0.32, P = 0.036), and avoidance symptoms (r = -0.34, P = 0.025). There were no significant associations of PTSD diagnostic status and symptomatology with the three other lipid measures.", 
    "4": "Chronic PTSD caused by MI was associated with lower plasma levels of HDL-C. The finding concurs with the notion of dyslipidemia partially underlying the atherosclerotic risk in individuals with PTSD caused by different types of trauma.", 
    "5": "Statins, lipid-lowering drugs, have been reported to influence bone metabolism. However, the available information about their effects on bone formation and resorption in vivo is still limited. The present study was undertaken to determine whether the topical administration of mevastatin could increase the bone mass of isografted bone. The tibiae were bilaterally dissected from a donor MRL/MpJ mouse and transplanted subcutaneously in the dorsal region of a recipient mouse. One grafted tibia was topically infused for either 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks with mevastatin, using an osmotic minipump at a dose of 2.5 pmol/hr. The other tibia was infused with 0.9% NaCl (control). Our three results were: (1) Topical mevastatin stimulated bone formation and numerous cuboidal osteoblasts appeared on the surface of newly formed bone. Bone mineral density and bone area in mevastatin-treated bone were significantly increased. (2) Topical mevastatin increased the number of osteoclasts. (3) The expression of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) mRNA and receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL) mRNA were upregulated in mevastatin-treated bone. These results suggest that the topical infusion of mevastatin increases bone mass of isografted bone by increasing bone turnover and, at least in part, by promoting the expression of BMP-2 and RANKL mRNA.", 
    "6": "Amlodipine/atorvastatin (Caduet) is a single-tablet, fixed-dose combination of the dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist amlodipine and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor atorvastatin. The bioavailability of amlodipine and atorvastatin with a single-tablet, fixed-dose amlodipine/atorvastatin combination was not significantly different to that with coadministered separate amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets. In well controlled clinical trials in patients with hypertension and dyslipidaemia, once-daily amlodipine and atorvastatin (administered as the single-tablet, fixed-dose combination or coadministered as two separate tablets) effectively reduced systolic BP (SBP) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, and enabled more patients to achieve BP and LDL-C goals than single-agent or placebo therapy. There was no modification of the effect of amlodipine on SBP when administered in combination with atorvastatin and there was no modification of the effect of atorvastatin on LDL-C when administered in combination with amlodipine. In noncomparative, titration-to-goal, open-label 'real-world' trials, the single-tablet, fixed-dose combination of amlodipine/atorvastatin enabled patients with hypertension and dyslipidaemia to achieve both BP and LDL-C goals. Administration of a single tablet of amlodipine/atorvastatin, compared with coadministration of these agents as two separate tablets, improved patient adherence, according to a retrospective study that utilized prescription refill rates from a large US insurance database. Data from the large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled ASCOT-LLA trial also demonstrated that the combination of amlodipine-based therapy and atorvastatin was effective in preventing cardiovascular (CV) endpoints in hypertensive patients at risk of CV disease (CVD). In summary, amlodipine/atorvastatin offers a convenient and effective approach to improving adherence and managing CV risk in hypertensive patients with dyslipidaemia or at risk of CVD.", 
    "7": "A 29-year-old man, with no significant past medical history, was in his usual state of health until the afternoon of admission. The patient was seated at work eating lunch when he suddenly noticed that his vision became blurry. He covered his right eye and had no visual difficulty but noted blurry vision upon covering his left eye. At this point, the patient tried to stand up, but had difficulty walking and noticed he was \"falling toward his left.\" Facial asymmetry when smiling was also appreciated. The patient denied any alteration in mental status, confusion, antecedent or current headaches, aura, chest pains, or shortness of breath. He was not taking any prescribed medications and had no known allergies. The patient denied any prior hospitalization or surgery. He denied use of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs, and worked as a maintenance worker in a hotel. His family history is remarkable for his father who died of pancreatic cancer in his 50s and his mother who died of an unknown heart condition in her late 40s. Vital signs on presentation to the emergency department included temperature of 97.6 degrees F; respiratory rate of 18 per minute; pulse of 68 per minute; blood pressure of 124/84 mmHg; pulse oximetry of 99% on ambient air. His body mass index was 24 and he was complaining of no pain. The patient had no carotid bruits and no significant jugular venous distention. Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs. Neurological exam revealed left-sided facial weakness, dysarthria, and preserved visual fields. He was able to furrow his brow. Gait deviation to the left was present, and Romberg sign was negative. Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ throughout, and no other focal neurological deficit was present. The patient was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of stroke. Electrocardiogram, fasting lipid profile, computed tomography (CT) scan of head, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of head and neck, and transthoracic echo with bubble study were ordered. The initial head CT did not reveal bleeding. He was started on aspirin (ASA). On the second hospital day, the symptoms improved with resolution of dysarthria. His ataxia had also improved. Fasting lipid profile revealed mildly elevated low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol. His head MRI revealed an acute right thalamic stroke. Echocardiography was significant only for a patent foramen ovale (PFO) with transit of agitated saline \"bubbles\" from right atrium to left heart within three cardiac cycles (Figure). Doppler ultrasound of extremities revealed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. A complete resolution of symptoms occurred by the third hospital day. The patient was discharged on full dose aspirin and a statin and was referred for consideration of enrollment in a PFO closure versus medical management trial.", 
    "8": "Heart disease is the primary cause of death in the United States. Fortunately, intervention measures can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) after a patient has been accurately assessed. Atherosclerotic disease, one of the driving forces behind CVD, is not always detected by traditional risk assessment. Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), as measured by B-mode ultrasound, is a surrogate marker for atherosclerosis and can be used to detect an accelerated disease process and subclinical disease. Advantages of CIMT are that it is noninvasive, relatively inexpensive, and can be repeatedly performed with no adverse effects on the patient. Carotid intima-media thickness is associated with CVD and is an independent predictor of stroke and myocardial infarction. Therefore, CIMT is valuable for clarifying CVD risk, particularly for patients with intermediate risk by conventional risk assessment. Screening for subclinical disease even in low-risk patients may have benefit, especially for those with a family history of premature CVD or those with any of the National Cholesterol Education Program risk factors. The detection of subclinical atherosclerosis allows the physician to implement prevention efforts prior to a devastating CVD event and to investigate possible reasons for increased arterial thickening, such as an occult underlying insulin-resistant condition or residual lipid risk markers. Treatment with several types of drugs has been demonstrated to halt the progression or even reduce CIMT. Carotid intima-media thickness is currently limited by the lack of standardized protocols that may affect reproducibility from measure to measure. Efforts to draft a standardized protocol are underway by the Society of Atherosclerosis Imaging and Prevention that will address this issue. Carotid intima-media thickness provides a valuable tool for physicians to clarify the CVD risk of their patients. Practical implications of CIMT for everyday clinical practice are addressed.", 
    "9": "The reverse cholesterol transport mediated by high-density lipoprotein (HDL) is an important mechanism for maintaining body cholesterol at normal levels and, hence, the critical anti-atherogenic action of the lipoprotein. Recent studies, however, showed that HDL exerts a variety of anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic actions independently of the cholesterol metabolism. On the other hand, statins, inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, were initially developed to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in plasma, and they are now recognized to exert a variety of pleiotropic or beneficial actions. Thus, although the mechanisms are different, both endogenous HDL and exogenous statins regulate cholesterol balance in a negative manner and exert a variety of beneficial actions independently of their cholesterol-lowering activity. These results raise the possibility that statins act in part through modulating the plasma levels of HDL and/or its actions. Here, we reviewed the cross-talk mechanism between statins and HDL in anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic actions, with a focus on scavenger receptor class B type I, one of main players involved in the cholesterol metabolism-independent HDL actions, and its downstream signaling pathway, leading to the activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and the inhibition of adhesion molecule expression in endothelial cells.", 
    "10": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are the mainstay in the pharmacologic management of dyslipidemia. Since they are widely prescribed, their safety remains an issue of concern. Rosuvastatin has been proven to be efficacious in improving serum lipid profiles. Recently published data from the JUPITER study confirmed the efficacy of this statin in primary prevention for older patients with multiple risk factors and evidence of inflammation. Rosuvastatin exhibits high hydrophilicity and hepatoselectivity, as well as low systemic bioavailability, while undergoing minimal metabolism via the cytochrome P450 system. Therefore, rosuvastatin has an interesting pharmacokinetic profile that is different from that of other statins. However, it remains to be established whether this may translate into a better safety profile and fewer drug-drug interactions for this statin compared with others. Herein, we review evidence with regard to the safety of this statin as well as its interactions with agents commonly prescribed in the clinical setting. As with other statins, rosuvastatin treatment is associated with relatively low rates of severe myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and renal failure. Asymptomatic liver enzyme elevations occur with rosuvastatin at a similarly low incidence as with other statins. Rosuvastatin treatment has also been associated with adverse effects related to the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system, which are also commonly observed with many other drugs. Proteinuria induced by rosuvastatin is likely to be associated with a statin-provoked inhibition of low-molecular-weight protein reabsorption by the renal tubules. Higher doses of rosuvastatin have been associated with cases of renal failure. Also, the co-administration of rosuvastatin with drugs that increase rosuvastatin blood levels may be deleterious for the kidney. Furthermore, rhabdomyolysis, considered a class effect of statins, is known to involve renal damage. Concerns have been raised by findings from the JUPITER study suggesting that rosuvastatin may slightly increase the incidence of physician-reported diabetes mellitus, as well as the levels of glycated hemoglobin in older patients with multiple risk factors and low-grade inflammation. Clinical trials proposed no increase in the incidence of neoplasias with rosuvastatin treatment compared with placebo. Drugs that antagonize organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin are more likely to interact with this statin. Clinicians should be cautious when rosuvastatin is co-administered with vitamin K antagonists, cyclosporine (ciclosporin), gemfibrozil, and antiretroviral agents since a potential pharmacokinetic interaction with those drugs may increase the risk of toxicity. On the other hand, rosuvastatin combination treatment with fenofibrate, ezetimibe, omega-3-fatty acids, antifungal azoles, rifampin (rifampicin), or clopidogrel seems to be safe, as there is no evidence to support any pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction of rosuvastatin with any of these drugs. Rosuvastatin therefore appears to be relatively safe and well tolerated, sharing the adverse effects that are considered class effects of statins. Practitioners of all medical practices should be alert when rosuvastatin is prescribed concomitantly with agents that may increase the risk of rosuvastatin-associated toxicity.",

These patients more frequently received glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, thrombolytics, and were less likely to be treated with statins during their hospital stay. Risk of AF occurrence was lower in patients treated with statins (1.9% vs 5.2%; p = 0.021). Among patients treated conservatively, in-hospital mortality was higher in patients with new onset of AF (8.1% vs 33.3%; p = 0.001).

    "16": "FL (10 mg . kg(-1) . day(-1), DM-FL) or vehicle (DM-VE) was orally administered for 2 weeks to streptozotocin-induced DM rats. Cardiac oxidative stress was determined by myocardial 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2alpha) (PGF(2alpha)) and NADPH oxidase subunit p22(phox) mRNA expression. Sympathetic neural function was quantified by autoradiography using (131)I- and (125)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG). FL did not affect plasma glucose levels but remarkably decreased PGF(2alpha) levels compared with DM-VE rats (13.8+/-9.2 vs 175.0+/-93.9 ng/g tissue), although PGF(2alpha) levels were below the detection limit in non-DM rats. FL significantly reduced myocardial p22(phox) mRNA expression. Cardiac (131)I-MIBG uptake was lower in DM-VE rats than in non-DM rats, but the decrease was attenuated in DM-FL rats (1.31+/-0.08, 1.88+/-0.22, and 1.58+/-0.18 %kg dose/g, respectively, P<0.01). Cardiac MIBG clearance was not affected by the induction of DM or by FL, indicating that the reduced MIBG uptake in DM rats might result from impaired neural function.",

    "19": "Total 684 patients (343 males, 60.5+/-11.2 years) with persistent chest pain without critical stenosis on CAG were enrolled. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the presence of MB. Clinical follow-up was performed with respect to readmission after baseline CAG. At a mean follow-up of 37 months, 92 patients (13.3%) were re-admitted because of 79 recurrent chest pain refractory to medication (11.5%), 8 myocardial infarctions (1.2%), 1 life-threatening arrhythmia (0.1%) and 4 deaths (0.6%). There was a significant higher incidence of readmission in the MB group (P=0.038). In multivariate analysis, long MB (hazard ratio (HR) 2.780; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.070-7.218, P=0.036) and spontaneous vasospasm in CAG (HR 2.335; 95%CI 1.055-5.171, P=0.037) were the predictors of readmission. Moreover, additional use of aspirin or statin decreased the readmission rate.",

    "21": "Cholesterol and sphingolipids are abundant in neuronal membranes, where they help the organisation of the membrane microdomains involved in major roles such as axonal and dendritic growth, and synapse and spine stability. The aim of this study was to analyse their roles in presynaptic physiology. We first confirmed the presence of proteins of the exocytic machinery (SNARES and Ca(v)2.1 channels) in the lipid microdomains of cultured neurons, and then incubated the neurons with fumonisin B (an inhibitor of sphingolipid synthesis), or with mevastatin or zaragozic acid (two compounds that affect the synthesis of cholesterol by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase or squalene synthase). The results demonstrate that fumonisin B and zaragozic acid efficiently decrease sphingolipid and cholesterol levels without greatly affecting the viability of neurons or the expression of synaptic proteins. Electron microscopy showed that the morphology and number of synaptic vesicles in the presynaptic boutons of cholesterol-depleted neurons were similar to those observed in control neurons. Zaragozic acid (but not fumonisin B) treatment impaired synaptic vesicle uptake of the lipophilic dye FM1-43 and an antibody directed against the luminal epitope of synaptotagmin-1, effects that depended on the reduction in cholesterol because they were reversed by cholesterol reloading. The time-lapse confocal imaging of neurons transfected with ecliptic SynaptopHluorin showed that cholesterol depletion affects the post-depolarisation increase in fluorescence intensity. Taken together, these findings show that reduced cholesterol levels impair synaptic vesicle exocytosis in cultured neurons.",

    "30": "We investigated the efficacy of short-term high-dose atorvastatin in decreasing the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) subjected to coronary angiography and/or angioplasty. CIN occurs in up to 15% of patients with pre-existing CKD and affects clinical outcome. The protective effect of statin therapy against CIN is still controversial. A prospective, single-center study of 304 patients with baseline estimated creatinine clearance <60 ml/min were randomized to receive atorvastatin 80 mg/day or placebo for 48 hours before and 48 hours after contrast medium administration. All patients received intravenous saline hydration and oral N-acetylcysteine 1,200 mg 2 times/day. Iso-osmolar contrast medium was used. CIN was defined as an absolute increase of serum creatinine > or = 0.5 mg/dl within 5 days after the procedure. CIN occurred in 31 patients (10%), 16 (11%) in the placebo group and 15 (10%) in the atorvastatin group (p = 0.86). Mean increase in creatinine was not significantly different in the 2 groups (0.59 + or - 0.17 in placebo group vs 0.72 + or - 0.26 mg/dl in atorvastatin group, p = 0.31). Persistent kidney injury, defined as 1-month increase from baseline creatinine value > or = 25%, was observed in 30% in the placebo group and in 31% in the atorvastatin group (p = 0.58). In conclusion, a short-term administration of high doses of atorvastatin before and after contrast exposure, in addition to standard intravenous hydration and oral N-acetylcysteine, does not decrease CIN occurrence in patients with pre-existing CKD.", 
    "31": "Analyses of randomized clinical trials are usually restricted to examination of time to first event. However, because many patients have multiple events, this approach precludes much potentially useful clinical and economic data. To assess the effect on overall disease burden in the Treating to New Targets (TNT) study, we evaluated the effect of treatment with atorvastatin 80 versus 10 mg in the period after the occurrence of a first cardiovascular event. In TNT, 10,001 patients with stable coronary heart disease received double-blind therapy with atorvastatin 80 or 10 mg and were followed for 4.9 years. Post hoc time-to-event analysis was used to estimate separate hazard ratios for time to any first, second, third, fourth, and fifth recurrent cardiovascular events. During TNT, 3,082 patients had a first recurrent cardiovascular event, with 1,516, 698, 345, and 197 developing second, third, fourth, and fifth recurrent events, respectively. In patients receiving atorvastatin 80 mg, the relative risk of a first recurrent event was significantly decreased compared to those receiving atorvastatin 10 mg. Significant benefit with the 80-mg dose was also observed for second, third, fourth, and fifth recurrent events. Similar findings were recorded in 5,854 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or metabolic syndrome and in 3,809 patients > or = 65 years of age compared to younger patients. In conclusion, treatment with atorvastatin 80 mg continued to significantly decrease the risk of any cardiovascular event over time compared to atorvastatin 10 mg in patients who had survived previous events. In TNT, analyses limited to the primary end point significantly underestimated the decrease in total cardiovascular disease burden achieved by intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering.", 
    "32": "Although previous studies have documented adherence with certain established heart failure (HF) quality metrics in outpatient cardiology practices, the extent to which there is conformity with other evidence-based, guideline-driven quality metrics in outpatients with HF is unknown. IMPROVE HF is a prospective cohort study designed to characterize the current management of patients with chronic HF and left ventricular ejection fraction <or=35% in outpatient cardiology practices. We evaluated baseline data for conformity with adjunctive HF therapies including pneumococcal vaccinization, hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate (HYD/ISDN) for Black patients, statin therapy, antiplatelet therapy, smoking-cessation counseling, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (<100 mg/dl), and systolic blood pressure decrease (all patients <140 mm Hg or [optimal] <130 mm Hg). Baseline data were available for 15,381 patients attending 167 cardiology practices. Patient characteristics included a median age 70 years, 71.0% men, 9.1% Black patients, 65.2% with ischemic HF cause, and 61.7% with a history of hypertension. Mean adherences or documentations of adherence were only 7.3% for HYD/ISDN and 1.0% for pneumococcal vaccination. Adherence to other adjunctive therapies ranged from 27.4% to 82.0% but none of the adjunctive treatment interventions were associated with high levels of adherence. Conformity with guideline-recommended, adjunctive HF therapies is deficient in the management of outpatients with HF. Critical gaps in documentation or delivery of care exist, especially for the use of pneumococcal vaccination and HYD/ISDN. In conclusion, improved processes of care, better documentation, and/or increased measures to promote adherence to all primary and adjunctive therapies for HF are needed.", 
    "33": "Currently, no consensus has been reached regarding the management of hyperlipidemia in patients who develop statin-associated myalgia (SAM). Many statin-intolerant patients use alternative lipid-lowering therapies, including red yeast rice. The present trial evaluated the tolerability of red yeast rice versus pravastatin in patients unable to tolerate other statins because of myalgia. The study was conducted in a community-based setting in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A total of 43 adults with dyslipidemia and a history of statin discontinuation because of myalgia were randomly assigned to red yeast rice 2,400 mg twice daily or pravastatin 20 mg twice daily for 12 weeks. All subjects were concomitantly enrolled in a 12-week therapeutic lifestyle change program. The primary outcomes included the incidence of treatment discontinuation because of myalgia and a daily pain severity score. The secondary outcomes were muscle strength and plasma lipids. The incidence of withdrawal from medication owing to myalgia was 5% (1 of 21) in the red yeast rice group and 9% (2 of 22) in the pravastatin group (p = 0.99). The mean pain severity did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. No difference was found in muscle strength between the 2 groups at week 4 (p = 0.61), week 8 (p = 0.81), or week 12 (p = 0.82). The low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level decreased 30% in the red yeast rice group and 27% in the pravastatin group. In conclusion, red yeast rice was tolerated as well as pravastatin and achieved a comparable reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in a population previously intolerant to statins.", 
    "34": "Some investigations have looked into the ability of measurements of apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A-I (apoB/apoA-I) ratio to predict cardiovascular events. We hypothesized that a decrease in the apoB/apoA-1 ratio by statin therapy would act on suppression of coronary plaque progression. A 6-month prospective study was conducted of 64 patients with coronary artery disease treated with pravastatin. The plaque volume, assessed by volumetric intravascular ultrasonography, had decreased significantly by 12.6% (p <0.0001 vs baseline). Although a significant decrease of 6.4% and 14.6% was found in the serum level of apoB and the apoB/apoA-1 ratio (p = 0.0001 and p <0.0001, respectively, vs baseline), a significant increase of 14.0% of and 12.0% in the level of apoA-I and apoA-II (both p <0.0001 vs baseline). No significant changes were found in the level of apoC-II or apoE. A stepwise regression analysis revealed that the change in the apoB/apoA-1 ratio was an independent predictor of the change in coronary plaque volume (beta coefficient 0.386; p = 0.0023). In conclusion, our results have indicated that the decrease in the apoB/apoA-I ratio is a simple predictor for coronary atherosclerotic regression: the lower the apoB/apoA-I ratio, the lower the risk of coronary atherosclerosis.",

Treatment with statins is well established for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiac events by lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. There are conflicting reports on the role of LDL cholesterol as an adverse prognostic predictor in patients with advanced HF. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between LDL cholesterol levels and clinical outcomes in 297 patients with severe HF (average New York Heart Association class 2.8). The mean follow-up period was 3.7 years (range 8 months to 11.5 years), and 37% of the patients died during follow-up. The mean time to first hospital admission for HF was 25 +/- 17 months.

Patients with the highest baseline LDL cholesterol levels had significantly improved outcomes, whereas those with the lowest LDL cholesterol levels had the highest mortality. When analyzed with respect to statin use, it emerged that the negative association between LDL cholesterol level and mortality was present only in the patients with HF who were treated with statins. In conclusion, lower LDL cholesterol levels appear to predict less favorable outcomes in patients with HF, particularly those taking statins, raising questions about the need for aggressive LDL cholesterol-lowering strategy in patients with HF, regardless of its cause.", 
    "36": "Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Using Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) reported reduced cardiovascular and all-cause mortality with statin treatment in patients with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and average cholesterol levels who were not eligible for lipid-lowering treatment on the basis of existing guidelines. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of eligibility and mortality in a general population sample on the basis of eligibility for statin treatment using the JUPITER criteria. The study group consisted of 30,229 participants in the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort, an observational study of US African American and white participants aged > or =45 years, enrolled in their homes from 2003 to 2007 and followed biannually by telephone. Among 11,339 participants age eligible for JUPITER and without vascular diagnoses or using lipid-lowering treatment, 21% (n = 2,342) met JUPITER entry criteria. Compared with JUPITER participants, they had similar low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and CRP levels, were more often women, were more often black, had metabolic syndrome, and used aspirin for cardioprotection. Over 3.5 years of follow-up, the mortality rate in REGARDS participants eligible for JUPITER was 1.17 per 100 patient-years (95% confidence interval 0.94 to 1.42). Compared with those otherwise JUPITER eligible who had CRP levels <2 mg/L (n = 2,620), those with CRP levels > or =2 mg/L had a multivariate-adjusted relative risk of 1.5 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.2) for total mortality. In conclusion, 21% not otherwise eligible would be newly eligible for lipid lowering treatment on the basis of JUPITER trial eligibility.", 
    "37": "Statins are the most commonly prescribed agents for lowering levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Although dose-dependent reductions in levels of atherogenic lipids are observed with all statins, the impact of increasing dose has not been fully elucidated. An individual patient data pooled analysis was performed of 32,258 patients in studies comparing the efficacy of rosuvastatin with that of atorvastatin or simvastatin. The impact of increasing dose on lowering LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B was investigated. Doubling the dose of each statin was accompanied by a 4% to 7% greater degree of lowering of all atherogenic lipids. A stronger correlation was observed between changes in LDL cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol (r = 0.92, p <0.001) or apolipoprotein B (r = 0.76, p <0.001) than triglycerides (r = 0.14, p <0.001). On multivariate analysis, baseline lipid level (p <0.0001) and increasing statin dose (p <0.0001) were strong predictors of achieving treatment goals in high-risk patients. Increasing age was a strong independent predictor of achieving goal for all atherogenic lipids (p <0.0001). Achieving LDL cholesterol goals was also more likely in women (p <0.0001), patients with diabetes (p <0.0001), and patients without atherosclerotic disease (p = 0.0002). In contrast, normal triglyceride levels were more often observed in men (p <0.0001) and patients without diabetes mellitus (p = 0.03). In conclusion, doubling statin dose was associated with greater lowering of LDL cholesterol by 4% to 6% and non-HDL cholesterol by 3% to 6%. Greater lipid goal achievement with increasing dose supports the use of high-dose statin therapy for more effective cardiovascular prevention.",

These patients underwent coronary interventions between January 2005 and April 2007 and had at least one additional catheterization procedure through the ipsilateral femoral access site from December 2001 until January 2008. Multivariate analysis was performed to control for confounding variables. The primary outcome was change in artery size.", 
    "40": "The average punctured artery diameter was 6.5 +/- 2.1 mm. The average time between the first case and last follow-up was 349 days. There was no significant change of the punctured artery size over time after the index procedure (P = .15) and no change associated with the use of vascular closure devices (P = .25) after multivariate analysis. Smaller arteries were associated with female gender (-1.22 mm, P < .0001), presence of angiographic peripheral vascular disease (PVD, -1.19 mm, P < .0001), and current (-0.48 mm, P = .001) or former (-0.23 mm, P = .01) smoking status, whereas previous statin therapy was associated with an increase in artery size (+0.47 mm, P < .0001). Vascular closure devices were used less often compared with manual compression in cases preceding the first detection of angiographic PVD (P < .001).", 
    "41": "Vascular closure devices are not associated with a change in the artery size or progression of PVD.

Patients' socio-demographic data, total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) thresholds for statin prescription, indications, data on GP and practices were registered. Statins were prescribed in 11.2% enlisted patients (64.11% PP, 35.88% SP), mostly aged 70+. In PP, thresholds were TC 6.2 +/- 1.09 mmol/L, LDL-C 3.6 mmol/L, in SP 5.4 +/- 1.26 mmol/L, 2,7 mmol/L, respectively. Most frequently prescribed statin in PP was 10 mg atorvastatin (49.28%), in SP it was 20 mg simvastatin (48.36%). Participating GPs were women, aged 39 +/ 5.49, working for 13 +/- 6 years, the average number of enlisted patients per GP 1562 +/- 299. There was statistically significant difference in statin prescription in PP (chi2 = 752.9; p < 0.001) and SP (chi2 = 64; p < 0.001). Statin prescription in PP is due to pharmaceutical marketing and lack of independent continuing medical education. The fact that statins are most frequently prescribed in patients aged 70+ (35.28% in PP 49.35% SP) reveals lack of preventive proactive CVDs approach in younger age groups, which is concerning.",

While a considerable amount of evidence for genetic influences on drug responses has been accumulated within the last decade, predominantly in small studies, its value in routine therapy is still a matter of debate. The aim of this review is to discuss well established examples where pharmacogenomic techniques can improve routine treatment. Examples include genotyping of CYP2D6 in the context of antidepressant therapy, analysis of TPMT variants for the prediction of mercaptopurine-induced bone marrow depression, VKORC1 and CYP2C9 analyses for a better control of anticoagulant administration and the SLCO1B1 variant in the context of statin-induced myopathies.",

Currently, HMGB1-induced NF-kappaB activation pathway has been recognized as a key contributor to the proinflammatory response. It has been proved that chronic administration and pre-treatment with statins could protect brain tissue against ischemic injury. However, little is known about the effects of statins in the acute phase after cerebral ischemia. Thus, this study investigated the atorvastatin's protective role and the underlying mechanisms in cerebral ischemia. After middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), atorvastatin was administered immediately. We found that atorvastatin dramatically improved neurological deficits, reduced brain water contents and infarct sizes at 24h after stroke. Moreover, the over-expression of HMGB1, RAGE, TLR4 and NF-kappaB induced by ischemia was significantly attenuated by atorvastatin.",

Results of the relationship between statins and dementia in previous studies are conflicting. There is no systematic review investigating the effect of statins on vascular dementia (VaD). This systematic review evaluates the role of statins in the prevention of VaD or dementia. The possible causes of conflicting results in the existing published work will be explored.",

The studies covered 1372 cases of dementia from 14 430 participants and 116 cases of VaD from 4924 participants from the USA and UK. There was no association between statin use and risk of VaD. The protective effect of statins on dementia was demonstrated only in a nested case-control study of lower quality and one recently published cohort study. In most other cohort and high quality studies, statin use did not show a beneficial effect.",

    "49": "In the elderly, atherosclerotic diseases such as stroke and myocardial infarction occupy a major part of their causes of death and care. The elderly always have atherosclerosis in their aorta and other arteries and are exposed to risk of attacks. It is the elderly who should receive its safe, harmless and advanced treatment. Advanced stage of atherosclerosis in the elderly is progressed by complicated risk factors such as dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus and specific risk factors for the elderly, aging (and menopause). Treatment of atherosclerotic disease may need special ones targeted for the elderly. Recent studies reported that frequencies of dyslipidemia were not decreased in the older oldest. In the elderly, impaired glucose tolerance occurs and it progresses atherosclerosis. Endothelial dysfunction like impairment of nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability also progresses atherosclerosis. Although we tried to regress the high cholesterol diet-induced atherosclerosis in rabbit aorta with a normal diet with or without statin, regression could not be achieved. NO targeting gene therapy (adenovirus endothelial nitric oxide synthase [eNOS] gene vector) regressed 20% of atherosclerotic lesions through reduction of lipid contents, however, a more integrated strategy is important for complete regression. We paid attention to NO bioavailability and developed two ways of increasing it in atherosclerosis: citrulline therapy and arginase II inhibition by estrogen. Further, we found a close relation between atherosclerosis and endothelial senescence and that NO can prevent it, especially in a diabetic model. Taken together, regression of atherosclerosis can be achieved by not only regulation of various risk factors but regulation of the cross-talk of NO and free radicals.", 
    "50": "Organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B3 (OATP1B3) (SLCO1B3) mediates the uptake of endogenous substrates (e.g. estrone-3-sulphate) and drugs (e.g. pravastatin) from blood into hepatocytes. Structure-based modelling of OATP1B3 suggested that a pore with a positive electrostatic potential contributes to the transport mechanism. Therefore, we investigated the role of conserved positively charged amino acids for OATP1B3-mediated uptake of sulphobromophthalein (BSP) and pravastatin.", 
    "51": "Residues Lys28, Lys41 and Arg580 in OATP1B3 were substituted by alanine, arginine, glutamine, glycine or lysine. Using immunofluorescence, immunoblot analysis and cellular uptake assays, the effect of these mutations on protein expression and transport activity was investigated.", 
    "52": "Immunofluorescence revealed that all mutants were localized in the plasma membrane with partial intracellular retention of the Arg580>Ala and Arg580>Lys mutants. Lys41>Ala, Lys41>Gln, Lys41>Gly, Arg580>Gly and Arg580>Lys showed significantly reduced transport for BSP and pravastatin. Kinetic analyses of BSP transport revealed a significant reduction of V(max) normalized to cell surface protein expression for Lys41>Ala (wild type: 190 +/- 8, Lys41>Ala:16 +/- 4 pmol (mg protein)(-1) min(-1), P < 0.001), whereas V(max) of Lys41>Arg and Arg580>Lys (103 +/- 8 and 123 +/- 14 pmol (mg protein)(-1) min(-1), P > 0.05) did not change significantly. This suggests that the positive charges at positions 41 and 580 are important for transport activity of BSP. Structural modelling indicated that the positively charged side chain of Lys41 is flexible within the pore. The orientation of Arg580 is defined by adjacent residues Glu74 and Asn77, which was confirmed by kinetic analysis of Glu74>Ala.",

Although these agents are used predominantly to reduce cholesterol concentrations in patients with hyperlipidemia, numerous studies have investigated the pleiotropic effects of statins and their potential in the prevention and/or treatment of other disease states, including cancer. Many theories have been proposed as to how statins may affect the risk or development of malignancies, prompting a clinical review of the literature. Studies have revealed statins to be associated with both increased and decreased cancer risk. Most of the published studies have been observational and retrospective in nature, and most prospective trials evaluated cancer as a secondary end point or adverse event, making it difficult to determine causality. Although most of the available evidence suggests a possible beneficial effect of statins on cancer, further study is needed with better designed trials and/or increased efforts in evaluating cancer as secondary end points in all statin trials until definite conclusions regarding statin effects on cancer risk and occurrence can be made.",

Different angiogenic modulating targets are under extensive investigation both experimentally and clinically. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are the first-line agents used in hypercholesterolemia. They are also characterized by having other benefits apart from their lipid-lowering effects. Among these pleiotropic effects are the pro- and antiangiogenic properties of statins. The pleiotropic effects of statins and how they modulate new blood vessel formation are discussed in this review. The currently available data from both animal and human studies regarding the effects of statins on angiogenesis in ischemic heart disease, stroke, ocular diseases, and cancer are also reviewed. Statins are safe, orally available agents that may acquire novel therapeutic indications through their angiogenic modulating effects.", 
    "56": "It is well-known that statin therapy results in significant reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with hyperlipidemia and coronary heart disease. Findings of observational studies on lipids and heart failure demonstrate that statins prevent the development of heart failure and decrease heart failure-related mortality and hospitalization. It is not clear, however, whether these beneficial effects result from their lipid-lowering actions or pleiotropic actions. Besides, some of the effects of statins (e.g. decreasing coenzyme Q and selenoprotein levels) may lead to adverse consequences. Two studies yielded significant information on the efficacy and safety of statins in patients with heart failure: the CORONA study included patients with ischemic heart failure and the GISSI-HF study included patients with heart failure of any cause. In both studies, 10 mg rosuvastatin reduced blood cholesterol and inflammatory parameters without any effect on mortality. In addition, rosuvastatin caused a decrease in the rate of hospitalization in the CORONA study. Both of these studies are important to demonstrate that rosuvastatin might be safe in patients with heart failure.", 
    "57": "Asthma is a disease with a complex pathogenesis and differentiated clinical picture with airway inflammation in its background. Many cells and cell-released substances are engaged in the course of the disease. The basic treatment strategy in asthma is based on chronic administration of inhaled glucocorticosteroids (with a strong anti-inflammatory effect) and beta2-adrenoreceptor agonists (bronchodilatory effect). Much attention has been recently paid to the effects of other medicines on mechanisms important in the pathogenesis of asthma, including beta-blockers and statins. Many researchers have suggested a potentially useful role of some beta-blockers in chronic asthma therapy, particularly considering their effect on the pharmacodynamics of beta receptors in the bronchi. Moreover, statins, due to their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, can also be useful in the management of asthma.", 
    "58": "We have previously demonstrated that inhibition of CAAX carboxyl methylation with AGGC caused redistribution and condensation of the ER molecular chaperones, glucose-regulated protein (GRP)-94 and calnexin; an effect that was attenuated by overexpression of dominant active RhoA. We have also shown that AGGC decreased GRP94 protein level; an effect that was dependent on caspase activity. In the present study, we tested the effects of inhibition of posttranslational processing of CAAX proteins on localization and protein levels of molecular chaperones and phosphorylation and protein level of eIF2alpha. We found that both AGGC, which inhibits CAAX carboxyl methylation, and simvastatin, which inhibits CAAX geranylgeranylation, caused relocalization of GRP94, calnexin, and calreticulin, effects that were not seen during endothelial apoptosis induced by TNF-alpha or ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. These results suggest that posttranslational processing of CAAX proteins is important in maintaining localization of molecular chaperones normally found in the ER. We also noted that AGGC, but not simvastatin, TNF-alpha, or UV irradiation, decreased protein levels of most molecular chaperones. Increased eIF2alpha phosphorylation was observed in the early stages of apoptosis, which was independent of the cause of apoptosis. These results suggest that eIF2alpha phosphorylation is a common early response to apoptosis-inducing stimuli. Interestingly, eIF2alpha protein level was decreased in the late stages of apoptosis induced by AGGC, TNF-alpha, and UV irradiation: an effect that was prevented by caspase inhibition. Thus we speculate that caspase(s)-dependent proteolysis of molecular chaperones and eIF2alpha may be novel signaling pathways of apoptosis. We also speculate that increased eIF2alpha phosphorylation is a defensive response against endothelial cell apoptosis.",

Given the age of the patients admitted to the intensive medicine units, many of them receive previous treatment with statins. However, after admission to these units, statin treatment is generally discontinued. There are no important studies that evaluate the effect of discontinuing statins on mortality. However, the existing studies support the hypothesis that withdrawing statins has a clear harmful effect. Thus, the withdrawal of statins after admission to an intensive medicine unit should be carefully evaluated.", 
    "68": "Research into the pathologic mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases has revealed that CREB binding protein (CBP) plays an important role in cognitive dysfunction. Loss of one copy of this gene leads to a syndrome with severe cognitive dysfunction. We investigated the association between four common variants in the CBP gene and cognitive function in 5804 participants of the PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER). Baseline associations between genetic variation and cognitive function were assessed with linear regression. Longitudinal associations were assessed with linear mixed models. All analyses were adjusted for sex, age, education, country, version of test, and pravastatin use. The intron 4CT and intron 3AC polymorphisms in the CBP gene were associated with better cognitive performance at baseline and during follow-up. Furthermore, the haplotype with the variant alleles of these two polymorphisms also showed a protective effect on cognitive function in all cognitive domains (all p<0.03). Genetic variation in the CBP gene is associated with better cognitive performance in an elderly population. Future research is necessary to investigate the effect of these polymorphisms on the expression of CBP levels and how these polymorphisms affect the gene expression mediated by CBP.",

Staest spread lowered serum total (17.2%), VLDL, and LDL cholesterol and serum triglycerides, while steest spread lowered serum total (13.8%) and LDL cholesterol levels from baseline (p<0.05 for all). Serum cholestanol and avenasterol were decreased in both groups, but campesterol and sitosterol were decreased by staest and increased by steest from baseline (p<0.05 from baseline and between the groups). Serum sitostanol to cholesterol ratio was increased by staest, but in arterial tissue this ratio was similar in both groups. On staest, lathosterol, campesterol, and sitosterol, and on steest sitosterol and avenasterol correlated significantly between serum and arterial tissue. Cholesterol metabolism, eg. lathosterol/campesterol, suggested that plant sterols were reduced in serum and in arterial tissue during staest.",

The evolution of our understanding of vascular thrombosis is reviewed with a current concept that includes a dynamic interplay of the biophysics, chemistry and biology of the blood vessel with the blood and its constituents. Implications for possible future interventions based on these novel concepts are offered, and the significance of improving our understanding of the pathobiology is emphasized.",

These consequences of a chronically activated immune system impact on the acceleration of atherosclerosis, vascular calcification and development of heart dysfunction. Recent evidence suggests that these immune-mediated consequences of uremic toxicity are not only important to stratify the risk and understand the mechanisms of disease, but also represent an important area for intervention. Thus, the aim of this brief review is to discuss the immune mechanisms behind atherosclerosis and myocardiopathy in CKD. We also display the emerging evidence that strategies focusing on modulating the immune response or reducing the generation of triggers of inflammation may represent an important tool to reduce mortality in this group of patients. Ongoing studies may generate the evidence that will translate these strategies to definitive changes in clinical practice.", 
    "82": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by intravascular hemolysis and inflammation coupled to a 400-fold greater incidence of invasive pneumococcal infection resulting in fulminant, lethal pneumococcal sepsis. Mechanistically, invasive infection is facilitated by a proinflammatory state that enhances receptor-mediated endocytosis of pneumococci into epithelial and endothelial cells. As statins reduce chronic inflammation, in addition to their serum cholesterol-lowering effects, we hypothesized that statin therapy might improve the outcome of pneumococcal infection in SCD. In this study, we tested this hypothesis in an experimental SCD mouse model and found that statin therapy prolonged survival following pneumococcal challenge. The protective effect resulted in part from decreased platelet-activating factor receptor expression on endothelia and epithelia, which led to reduced bacterial invasion. An additional protective effect resulted from inhibition of host cell lysis by pneumococcal cholesterol-dependent cytotoxins (CDCs), including pneumolysin. We conclude therefore that statins may be of prophylactic benefit against invasive pneumococcal disease in patients with SCD and, more broadly, in settings of bacterial pathogenesis driven by receptor-mediated endocytosis and the CDC class of toxins produced by Gram-positive invasive bacteria.", 
    "83": "We have demonstrated that pitavastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, enhanced human serum paraoxonase (PON1) gene promoter activity and that protein kinase C (PKC) activated PON1 expression through Sp1 in cultured HepG2 cells. We investigated whether PKC was involved in pitavastatin-induced PON1 expression. PON1 gene promoter activity was assessed by a reporter gene assay using cultured Huh7 cells. PON1 protein expression and PKC activation were measured by Western blotting. The binding activity of Sp1 to the PON1 gene upstream was analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Both PON1 gene promoter activity and PON1 protein expression were elevated by pitavastatin stimulation. The effects of pitavastatin on PON1 promoter activity and PON1 protein expression were attenuated by both bisindolylmaleimide IX (Ro-31-8220) and bisindolylmaleimide I. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that pitavastatin increased the Sp1-PON1 DNA binding, and this effect was attenuated by Ro-31-8220. Pitavastatin activated atypical PKC, but never conventional or novel PKC. Myristoylated pseudosubstrate peptide inhibitor of PKCzeta abolished the pitavastatin-increased PON1 promoter activity; however, calphostin C and G\u00f66976 (PKC inhibitors except for PKCzeta) did not influence the promoter activity. In addition, an overexpression of dominant negative form of PKCzeta expression vector obviously decreased pitavastatin-induced PON1 promoter activation. These observations suggest that pitavastatin activates PKC, especially PKCzeta isoform, which increases the binding intensity of Sp1 to PON1 DNA promoter responsible for enhanced transcription of PON1 gene and increased PON1 protein expression in Huh7 cells.",

This study aimed to investigate the clinical efficacy of rosuvastatin in LDL cholesterol lowering therapy for new or switched hyperlipidaemic Chinese patients.", 
    "85": "This study was a retrospective one in patients who took rosuvastatin in the outpatient clinics of Prince of Wales Hospital during the period of July 1, 2004 to June 30, 2005. The prescribing pattern, the utilization pattern and the side effect profile were recorded. Attainment of lipid goals for each patient was assessed according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP ATP) III guidelines.", 
    "86": "A total of 261 Chinese patients (mean age (64.8 +/- 12) years; 55.6% male) were recruited into the study. The mean LDL-cholesterol level was (3.50 +/- 1.29) mmol/L prior to Rosuvastatin and (2.30 +/- 1.73) mmol/L after Rosuvastatin treatment (P < 0.0001). Rosuvastatin raised the LDL-cholesterol goal achievement rate from 28.0% to 74.3% in all patients combined (P < 0.0001) and from 11.0% to 79.0% for statin naive patients (P < 0.0001). Approximately 4% of patients developed side effects including myalgia, elevated liver enzymes, and dizziness.",

    "88": "Atherothrombotic disease is highly prevalent in Western countries and is associated with morbidity, mortality, and a significant economic burden. The primary pathophysiological mechanism of acute ischemic events in patients with atherothrombotic disease is complex but involves thrombotic occlusion in response to rupture or erosion of atherosclerotic lesions. Current treatments for long-term secondary prevention in patients with established atherothrombotic disease, such as those with prior myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack, or symptomatic peripheral artery disease, include therapies aimed at preventing rupture/erosion of atherosclerotic lesions (life-style modification and blood pressure reduction, in addition to statins and angiotensin II-active agents) and thrombus formation (primarily antiplatelet agents, such as aspirin, thienopyridines (clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticlopidine), and, to a lesser degree, anticoagulants). Despite the proven benefits and broad use of these therapies, the long-term rates of mortality and recurrent ischemic events remain high. This residual risk can be attributed to the fact that atherothrombosis continues in the presence of current treatments; because these agents each inhibit relatively specific pathways, atherosclerosis, thrombus formation, and other processes may progress. These considerations suggest that novel therapies with a different mechanism of action may provide additional reductions in morbidity and mortality beyond those observed with current agents.", 
    "89": "The article deals with the findings of studying the use of rosuvastatin in patients after endured reconstructive operations on the brachiocephalic arteries and aortofemoral segment in order to prevent cardiac atherothrombotic complications. A total of thirty patients were given \"Crestors\" at a daily dose of 10 mg for two weeks prior to surgery and for two weeks postoperatively and were found to have a significant decrease in the average levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins, which was accompanied and followed by certain improvement in the functional state of the vascular wall, with no cardiac complications being observed in either case.", 
    "90": "Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase and reduce the intracellular formation of mevalonate. They are chemical compounds able to reduce total cholesterol by 15-40% and LDL cholesterol by 20-60%, and to increase HDL cholesterol by 5-15%. They also reduce triglycerides by 10- 30%. Statins, blocking the mevalonate pathway, inhibit the prenylation of proteins, which is essential to perform their biological function. A great deal of research has documented the positive effect of statins on bone formation and the importance of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) in mediating this effect. Statins are also able to decrease osteoblast apoptosis. The positive effect of statins on bone formation is accompanied by an inhibition of osteoclast activity, which gives statins the ability to uncouple the bone remodeling processes. Patients taking statins have a higher femoral bone density than those who do not. The lipophilic statins seem to be more effective than the hydrophilic statins in protecting bone. In several clinical trials, but not in all, the use of statins had been associated with a reduction in the fracture risk. In conclusion, statins have a positive effect on bone in vitro, but such an efficacy in humans has yet to be clearly demonstrated. Randomized, controlled trials are needed to provide a satisfactory answer on this issue.", 
    "91": "The role of CRP as a mediator in atherosclerosis and inflammation is being investigated worldwide. In the present study, the effect of CRP on matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-1, 2, 9, and their tissue inhibitor (TIMP-1) gene expression in THP-1 monocytic cell line was investigated. Specific mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase (ERK, p38, and JNK) inhibitors were used to elucidate the signaling pathways involved. Effect of atorvastatin was determined in the presence of CRP on the expression of genes. Time and dose-dependent experiments were performed in the presence of CRP. The results showed that the treatment of THP-1 cells with 100 microg of CRP/ml/10(6) cells for 24 h enhanced the expression of MMPs and TIMP-1 genes significantly. CRP upregulated the expression of these genes via FcgammaRII and utilized ERK signaling pathway to transduce signals. Atorvastatin was able to significantly attenuate CRP-induced MMPs expression and augmented TIMP-1 gene expression significantly. In conclusion, CRP is not only a risk marker for vascular events, but also directly involved in the mechanisms leading to remodeling and destabilization of atherosclerotic plaque. Also, atorvastatin serves as potential therapeutic modality to curb these harmful events.", 
    "92": "Although statins are generally well tolerated, the most common adverse drug reaction from statin therapy is myopathy. This article reviews the current pharmacogenomic knowledge of statin-induced myopathy. Furthermore, we will discuss the importance of recent pharmacogenetic advances for the treatment and management of statin-induced myopathy. Variation in the SLCO1B1 gene is associated with increased incidence of statin-induced myopathy, particularly with simvastatin and less so with other statins. If different pharmacokinetic enzymes and transporters are responsible for susceptibility to myopathy, this may explain differences in the occurrence of statin-induced myopathy in individual patients. Genotyping in patients suffering from statin-induced myopathy may help to personalize the choice of statin for the lowest chance of developing myopathy.", 
    "93": "Insig-1 and Insig-2, two closely related proteins, are essential for feedback inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis. Here, we characterized a line of epidermal-specific, Insig-double knockout (Epi-Insig-DKO) mice lacking both Insigs in epidermis. At birth, Epi-Insig-DKO mice were indistinguishable from control littermates, but thereafter they failed to thrive and died before 6 weeks of age. By 14 days of age, 100% of Epi-Insig-DKO mice exhibited defects in hair growth along with other skin abnormalities, including hyperkeratosis. Hair follicles in Epi-Insig-DKO mice developed normally through postnatal day 7, but they failed to progress to later stages and thus exhibited defects in postnatal hair cycling. Insig deficiency caused a marked buildup of cholesterol precursors in skin associated with a marked increase in 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase protein. Topical treatment of Epi-Insig-DKO mice with simvastatin, an inhibitor of reductase, reduced sterol precursors in skin and corrected the hair and skin defects. We conclude that Insig deficiency in skin causes accumulation of cholesterol precursors, and this impairs normal hair development. These findings have implications for several human genetic diseases in which mutations in cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes lead to accumulation of sterol precursors and multiple cutaneous abnormalities.", 
    "94": "Preliminary findings suggest that statins may have a neuroprotective effect in patients with acute ischaemic stroke. This study investigated whether patients on prior statin therapy and treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) for acute ischaemic stroke have a better functional outcome than statin-na\u00efve patients.", 
    "95": "In a prospective observational cohort study of 476 acute ischaemic stroke patients treated with tPA we investigated the relationship between prior statin use and functional outcome at 3 months, the occurrence of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (SICH) and early in-hospital mortality. Ischaemic stroke subtypes were defined according to the TOAST classification. Favourable outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score < or =2.", 
    "96": "Of the 476 patients included, 98 (20.6%) used a statin at stroke presentation. In the entire cohort, 45.6% of patients had a favourable outcome with no difference between patients with or without statin therapy (45.9 vs. 45.5%, p = 0.94). In the multivariable analysis, statin use was not associated with favourable outcome (OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.6-1.9, p = 0.87). In none of the different stroke subtype groups was statin use associated with favourable outcome. Finally, statin use was not an independent risk factor of SICH or of early in-hospital mortality.",

    "98": "The aim of the present study was to formulate a self-emulsifying drug delivery system of atorvastatin calcium and its characterization including in vitro and in vivo potential. The solubility of atorvastatin calcium was determined in various vehicles such as Captex 355, Captex 355 EP/NF, Ethyl oleate, Capmul MCM, Capmul PG-8, Gelucire 44/14, Tween 80, Tween 20, and PEG 400. Pseudoternary phase diagrams were plotted on the basis of solubility data of drug in various components to evaluate the microemulsification region. Formulation development and screening was carried out based on results obtained from phase diagrams and characteristics of resultant microemulsion. Prepared formulations were tested for microemulsifying properties and evaluated for clarity, precipitation, viscosity determination, drug content and in vitro dissolution. The optimized formulation further evaluated for particle size distribution, zeta potential, stability studies and in vivo potential. In vivo performance of the optimized formulation was evaluated using a Triton-induced hypercholesterolemia model in male Albino Wistar rats. The formulation significantly reduced serum lipid levels as compared with atorvastatin calcium. Thus studies illustrated the potential use for the delivery of hydrophobic drug such as atorvastatin calcium by oral route.", 
    "99": "Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide is closely related to the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A high-cholesterol or high-energy diet was demonstrated to stimulate Abeta formation and deposition in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) pathway and, oppositely, downregulate the secretion of the neuroprotective soluble APP alpha-fragment (sAPPalpha). Monascus-fermented red mold rice (RMR) including multiple cholesterol-lowering agents, antioxidants, and anti-inflammatory agents has been proven to ameliorate Abeta40 infusion-induced memory deficit in our previous study. In this study, the ethanol extract of RMR (RE) and natural RMR were respectively tested for their effect on the mediation of the proteolytic process of APP in cholesterol-treated human neuroblastoma IMR32 cell, as well as their effect on memory and learning ability and the expression of AD risk factors in intracerebroventricular Abeta40-infused hyperlipidemic rats. In the results, RE suppressed cholesterol-raised beta-secretase activity and further resulted in the increase of sAPPalpha secretion in the IMR32 cell. In the animal test, RMR potently reversed the memory deficit in the water maze and passive avoidance tasks. RMR administration could prevent against Abeta40 infusion plus the great damage caused by a high energy diet in hippocampus and cortex involved in the raise of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and reactive oxygen species. The neuroprotection provided by RMR downregulates Abeta40 formation and deposition by suppressing the cholesterol-raised beta-secretase activity and apolipoprotein E expression, as well as mediates the proteolytic process of APP toward neuroprotective sAPPalpha secretion in hippocampus.",

The aim of this study was to demonstrate effects of simvastatine on postoperative treatment, laboratory findings and pericardial effusion during postoperative period, in patients after aortocoronary bypass grafting procedures.", 
    "101": "The study included 80 patients with coronary arterial disease divided in two groups. The study group included 40 patients with coronary ischemic disease subjected to surgical implantation of aortocoronary bypass graft who received standard cardio-surgical postoperative treatment supplemented with 40 mg of simvastatine per day, starting at 8 hours after the patient's extubation until postoperative 14th day. The control group included 40 patients after aortocoronary bypass grafting procedures with standard intensive postoperative treatment. Evaluation included demographic data, surgical reports, postoperative laboratory parameters and echocardiography findings, taken during two days monitoring of postoperative pericardial effusion. Statistical data analysis was conducted using SPSS software. Parametric data were evaluated using Student T-test, while non-parametric data were processed using chi2 test and proportion analysis. Mann-Whitney U test was applied with CI of 95%, i.e., significance level p < 0.05.", 
    "102": "No significant differences were found between the observed groups with regards to demographic data, number of the implanted aortocoronary bypasses and postoperative laboratory parameters. However, the differences in echocardiographically determined dimensions of postoperative pericardial effusions measured during two days of postoperative observation (between the 3rd and the 14th day postoperative) were significant (p < 0.037, p < 0.01).", 
    "103": "In our study, statin therapy consisting of 40 mg/24 hrs was applied with no side effects and without interaction with the other postoperatively applied medications. Simvastatins, applied in the dosage of 40 mg/24 hrs, efficiently lead to significant reduction of postoperative pericardial effusions in postoperative period. In this limited group of patients, statins have exhibited good anti-inflammatory effects. Statins with standard therapy ought to be included in the early cardio-surgical postoperative period. Anti-inflammatory activities of statins should be further investigation on much larger patient sample. So far, there is no record of a large study of anti-inflammatory activities of hypolipemic agents that could waive the doubts into their effectiveness. It needs to be stressed that no large studies of anti-inflammatory activities of hypolipemic agents in cases of postoperative pericardial effusion were ever conducted.",

    "106": "Mean arterial pressure decreased in LPS-treated animals (P<0.05), but not in those also receiving pravastatin. Acetylcholine-induced relaxation of venules was abolished by LPS but improved by pravastatin. Pravastatin also reduced the increase in nitrite concentration and macromolecular leak from venules induced by LPS (P<0.05). The increased leucocyte adhesion seen in LPS-treated rats was also reduced in those also treated with pravastatin. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that pravastatin increased endothelial cell expression of NOS III during sepsis, but had no effect on LPS-induced up-regulation of NOS II.",

Initial work focused on inhibitors of farnesylation, but more recently geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitors (GGTIs) have begun to be evaluated for their potential antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we have developed a nonpeptidomimetic GGTI, termed GGTI-2Z [(5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methyl-(2Z,6E,10E)-3,7,11,15-tetramethylhexadeca-2,6,10,14-tetraenyl 4-chlorobutyl(methyl)phosphoramidate], which in combination with lovastatin inhibits geranylgeranyl transferase I (GGTase I) and GGTase II/RabGGTase, without affecting farnesylation. The combination treatment results in a G(0)/G(1) arrest and synergistic inhibition of proliferation of cultured STS-26T malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor cells. We also show that the antiproliferative activity of drugs in combination occurs in the context of autophagy. The combination treatment also induces autophagy in the MCF10.DCIS model of human breast ductal carcinoma in situ and in 1c1c7 murine hepatoma cells, where it also reduces proliferation. At the same time, there is no detectable toxicity in normal immortalized Schwann cells. These studies establish GGTI-2Z as a novel geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate derivative that may work through a new mechanism involving the induction of autophagy and, in combination with lovastatin, may serve as a valuable paradigm for developing more effective strategies in this class of antitumor therapeutics.",

    "151": "Atherosclerosis begins in childhood with the formation of fatty streaks. Early plaques can be found in adolescence and early coronary disease can be found in young adults. It has been suggested that early treatment may lead to great benefits in later life. This article is a narrative review of the role of lipid-lowering drug therapy in paediatric practice. Increased rates of atherosclerosis are known to occur in children with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH), especially in homozygotes. There is evidence for the efficacy and safety of lipid-lowering therapies in children, particularly with respect to the effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) on lipids and, to a limited extent, on other surrogate measures of atherosclerosis in patients with FH. Diagnosis of FH and its early treatment are recommended in all guidelines. Lipid-lowering drug therapy is recommended for the treatment of homozygous FH at all ages and from as young as 10 years of age for the treatment of heterozygous FH when there is a family history of very premature coronary heart disease (occurring at age <40 years). Controversy exists about other possible indications. Increased rates of atherosclerosis are seen in autoimmune disorders, including type 1 diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus and Kawasaki's disease, and in transplant recipients. All evidence in these areas is derived by extrapolation from studies in adults. These disorders can be divided into those for which percutaneous coronary intervention is performed early and/or for which drugs used to treat the primary disorder increase the rate of atherosclerosis, and those for which this is not the case. In both cardiac transplantation and Kawasaki's disease, increased atherosclerosis can occur as a result of (i) disease-related vasculopathy; or (ii) increased restenosis secondary to interventions. Statins have a good evidence base for reducing rates of re-occlusion following coronary artery procedures, and this justifies their use in these settings. In renal transplantation, statins may have a role to play in patients with persistent dyslipidaemia and additional cardiovascular risk factors. In other disorders, such as type 1 diabetes, the disease process is atherogenic and thus statins may be justified in patients with a long history of disease (>10 years), poor control, and evidence of vascular or endothelial damage or additional cardiovascular risk factors. There is a role for lipid-lowering therapies in children at high risk of atherosclerosis, but the evidence base outside of FH is weak. Lipid-lowering therapy should be prescribed to all children with homozygous or severe heterozygous FH. Based on adult evidence, statin therapy should be considered in patients who have undergone coronary artery procedures or received cardiac transplants, in whom their primary role is to prevent vascular re-occlusion. In diseases associated with a chronic increased atherogenic risk, such as type 1 diabetes, statins should be considered in high-risk cases where additional cardiovascular risk factors are present. At present, the most important need is for trials to be performed in children using accepted surrogate endpoints to define whether lipid-lowering drug therapy is beneficial in this group.", 
    "152": "Despite optimal treatment of high low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol with statins many cardiovascular events are not prevented. Additional therapeutic strategies are required to reduce the residual cardiovascular risk. Large epidemiological studies show an inverse correlation between the plasma concentration of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and the incidence of cardiovascular events. Under physiological conditions, HDL is vasculoprotective and mediates the reverse cholesterol transport. However, new studies suggest that HDL particles represent a heterogeneous population. Under several pathophysiological conditions, HDL was shown to promote atherogenesis and inflammation. Interventional studies and metaanalyses examining the effect of increasing HDL cholesterol have reported mixed results. Inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is a new and potent strategy to increase HDL concentrations. However, the first CETP-inhibitor torcetrapib increased blood-pressure and increased cardiovascular events despite increasing HDL. The blood-pressure increasing effects are not known for more recently developed CETP inhibitors such as dalcetrapib and anacetrapib nor in patients with genetic CETP deficiency. An increase of HDL cholesterol does not necessarily imply an improvement of the functional properties of HDL such as reverse cholesterol transport. An important open question remains the functional characterization of HDL generated by CETP inhibition. Important current clinical endpoint studies with new CETP inhibitors will elucidate whether increasing HDL by CETP inhibition leads to a reduction of cardiovascular events.",

However, blood pressure, triglycerides, and fasting plasma glucose all increased, while high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol decreased, with increased BMI. The percentage of patients having two or three risk factors (such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, and DM) also increased with increased BMI.", 
    "156": "Obesity was not an independent risk factor for CHD in hypercholesterolemic patients on statin therapy; however, it is important to control obesity, a condition in which CHD risks accumulate, in order to improve associated risk factors along with the treatment of each risk factor, thus further reducing the risk of CHD.", 
    "157": "Because of methodological limitations and conflicting results of studies conducted thus far, the possible involvement of human adipose tissue in pleiotropic effects of statins and fibrates requires better understanding. Samples of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue obtained from 23 mixed dyslipidemic patients and 23 normolipidemic subjects were treated in vitro for 48 h with atorvastatin, fenofibric acid or both these agents. Visceral and subcutaneous fat of mixed dyslipidemic patients released more leptin, resistin, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and less adiponectin than respective adipose tissue of patients without lipid abnormalities. In both groups of patients, visceral and subcutaneous tissue varied in the amount of secreted adipokines. In dyslipidemic patients both drugs administered alone affected adipose tissue adiponectin and resistin secretion. Additionally, atorvastatin decreased PAI-1 while fenofibric acid reduced leptin release. A combined administration of atorvastatin and fenofibric acid changed the release of all studied markers by visceral fat but did not affect interleukin-6 and TNFalpha release by subcutaneous tissue. In normolipidemic subjects the effect on adipokine release was more pronounced in visceral fat, in which it was strongest if the drugs were given together. Adipose tissue hormonal activity differs between mixed dyslipidemic and normolipidemic patients and between visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue. Atorvastatin and fenofibrate exhibit their pleiotropic effects in part by changing the adipokine release by human adipose tissue, regardless of its origin. These effects are stronger in patients with mixed dyslipidemia and are particularly pronounced if atorvastatin and fenofibric acid are given together.",

A national screening programme has commenced that aims to reduce the number of deaths from aneurysm rupture by 50%. The programme will detect a large number of men with a small aneurysm who are not in imminent danger of rupture, but who will join a regular ultrasound programme of surveillance. If the aneurysm expansion rate could be reduced, fewer men would be at risk of aneurysm rupture, and fewer would need elective aneurysm repair. A considerable amount is known about the pathophysiology of aneurysm growth. Exploring pharmacological means to delay or reduce aneurysm growth could make a considerable contribution to any screening programme. A number of case control studies have suggested that some antihypertensive drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, and statins may reduce aneurysm growth rates. Data from controlled studies have provided less secure conclusions. Use of these medications, together with lifestyle modification such as stopping smoking, could become standard advice to men with a small aortic aneurysm.

Most surgical procedures performed by obstetrician-gynecologists are associated with pelvic adhesions that may cause subsequent serious sequelae, including small bowel obstruction, infertility, chronic pelvic pain, and difficulty in postoperative treatment, including complexity during subsequent surgical procedures. An increasing number of adhesion reduction agents, in the form of site-specific and broad-coverage barriers and solutions, are becoming available to surgical teams. The most widely studied strategies include placing synthetic barrier agents between the pelvic structures. Most of the adhesions in the barrier-treated patients develop in uncovered areas in the abdomen. This fact suggests that the application of liquid or gel anti-adhesive agents to cover all potential peritoneal lesions, together with the use of barrier agents, may reduce the formation of postoperative adhesions. This article introduces the topical choices available for adhesion prevention mentioned in preliminary clinical applications and animal models. To date there is no substantial evidence that their use reduces the incidence of postoperative adhesions. In combination with good surgical techniques, these non-barrier agents may play an important role in adhesion reduction.",
