Coadministration of ezetimibe and simvastatin provided LDL-C reductions of 44% to 57%, TG reductions of 20% to 28%, and HDL-C increases of 8% to 11%, depending on the simvastatin dose. Ezetimibe 10 mg plus simvastatin 10 mg and simvastatin 80 mg alone each provided a 44% LDL-C reduction.

Drug choice is presumed to be guided by the estimated degree of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowering required in a particular patient and the projected efficacy of any drug-dose combination, as contained in the package inserts for each medication. We investigated whether these expectations were met in a clinical practice.",

    "16": "Low doses of statins rapidly induce the translocation of Akt to discrete sites in endothelial cell plasma membrane that colocalize with F-actin-positive, focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-negative lamellipodia and filopodia. This translocation event requires the lipid-binding, pleckstrin homology domain of Akt. Treatment with phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) inhibitors or the HMG-CoA reductase reaction product L-mevalonate blocks the translocation of Akt in response to statin stimulation. Furthermore, the ability of statins to promote Akt activation and translocation to the membrane is inhibited by cholesterol delivery to cells, but cholesterol loading had no effect on VEGF-induced Akt activation.",

This study was designed to examine the regulation by ox-LDL of the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs). In addition, we studied the effect of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin on this interaction.", 
    "19": "Cultured HCAECs were incubated with ox-LDL (10-80 microg/ml) for 1-24 h. Ox-LDL increased the expression of ACE in a concentration- and time-dependent fashion. The upregulation of ACE expression in response to ox-LDL was mediated by its endothelial receptor LOX-1, since pretreatment of HCAECs with a blocking antibody to LOX-1 prevented the expression of ACE (P<0.01). Native-LDL had no significant effect on ACE expression. In this process, ox-LDL-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK p42/44) played an important role, since pretreatment of HCAECs with the MAPK p42/44 inhibitor (PD98059, 10 microM) inhibited MAPK activation and subsequently attenuated the expression of ACE (P<0.01 vs. ox-LDL alone). In other experiments, we pretreated HCAECs with simvastatin (10 microM) and then exposed the cells to ox-LDL. Simvastatin markedly attenuated ox-LDL-induced MAPK activation, and concurrently reduced ACE expression (P<0.01 vs. ox-LDL alone).", 
    "20": "Our observations provide direct evidence that ox-LDL via LOX-1 activation induces ACE gene expression in HCAECs, and MAPK activation plays a signal transduction role in this process. Simvastatin, which inhibits MAPK activation, also blocks ox-LDL-mediated upregulation of ACE.",

    "23": "As compared with no treatment, the normolipidemic diet significantly reduced lipid levels, while simvastatin produced nonsignificant reductions. In spite of this, NF-kappaB binding activity in peripheral mononuclear cells was reduced in the simvastatin group [2,958+/-5,123 arbitrary units (a.u.)] as compared with no treatment (49,267+/-20,084 a.u.; P<0.05) and normolipidemic groups (41,492+/-15,876 a.u.; P<0.05) (electrophoretic mobility shift assay). NF-kappaB activity in the atherosclerotic lesions was also reduced by simvastatin as compared to nontreated animals (4,108+/-3,264 vs. 8,696+/-2,305 nuclei/mm(2); P<0.05), while the normolipidemic diet induced only a nonsignificant diminution (P>0.05) (Southwestern histochemistry). Similarly, simvastatin decreased macrophage infiltration (4.6+/-12 vs. 19+/-12% of area staining positive; P<0.05) and the expression of interleukin-8 (24+/-12 vs. 63+/-21%; P<0.05) and metalloproteinase-3 (16+/-3 vs. 42+/-28%; P<0.05) (immunohistochemistry), while the reduction achieved by normolipidemic diet in all these parameters was again nonsignificant (P>0.05).",

Treatment of human U-937 and HL-60 cells with TNF alpha or C2-ceramide inhibited both expression and activity of HMGCoA reductase in a time-dependent manner. Maturation of p21(ras) was also inhibited in a mevalonate-dependent fashion. The addition of mevalonate to both U-937 and HL-60 cells could also partially prevent TNF alpha and ceramide-induced apoptosis. These results support the hypothesis that the inhibition of HMGCoA reductase expression and the subsequent decrease in prenylation of proteins such as p21(ras) are part of the mechanism by which TNF alpha induces apoptosis in these cells.",

    "30": "Elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is independently associated with a higher risk for cardiovascular events. Lowering of elevated LDL-C concentrations with statin monotherapy may be insufficient in patients at high risk for cardiovascular events. In fact, consideration of elevated triglycerides (TGs) and/or low concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with elevated LDL-C places them at greater risk. The addition of niacin may enhance or improve the lipid profile of those who require a further decrease of TGs and/or increase of HDL-C even after stable statin therapy. Niacin-ER offers efficacy similar to that of immediate-release niacin, but minimal myopathy and hepatotoxicity (compared with sustained-release niacin). Although no clinical outcomes are available, current evidence shows that the combination product offers adequate lowering of LDL-C and TGs and increasing HDL-C. The data suggest that therapy with the niacin-ER and lovastatin combination product is safe and does not increase the incidence of adverse effects.", 
    "31": "Statins, which competitively inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity and reduce mevalonate synthesis, are believed to exert a plethora of pleiotropic effects. In this report, molecular mechanisms of the inhibitory effect on plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) expression produced by cerivastatin (CRV), the most active compound in this class, were studied using monocultures of human endothelial cell line (EA.hy 926). CRV similar to another statin, lovastatin (LOV), significantly inhibited PAI-1 expression and its release from endothelial cells, nonstimulated and stimulated with TNF-alpha. The inhibitory effect of CRV could be detected at the level of PAI-1 promoter in EA.hy 926 cells transfected with plasmid p800 LUC containing PAI-1 promoter fragment (+71 to -800), as well as at the level of PAI-1 mRNA. The PAI-1 promoter activity was markedly suppressed in the nonstimulated cells and almost completely inhibited in TNF-alpha-stimulated cells. In addition, CRV at low doses (IC(50) of 4 - 6 microM) significantly inhibited mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) phosphorylation. The majority of inhibitory effects occurred at significantly lower concentrations for CRV compared to LOV. The mechanism by which CRV inhibits PAI-1 expression appears to be directly associated with geranylgeranylation of some cell proteins, since the inhibitory effect on PAI-1 expression can be reversed by geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate but not by farnesyl-pyrophosphate.",

Reported barriers included a perception that aggressive management of CHD is thought to be unimportant by support staff yet to require significant staff time.

    "37": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have direct vascular effects that contribute to plaque stability. In the current study, the authors demonstrate that the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors atorvastatin and pravastatin augment the adhesion of human (HSMCs) and rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMCs) to collagen I via induction of alpha2beta1-integrin receptors. Atorvastatin (0.1 microM ) increased the adhesion of HSMCs to collagen I up to 2-fold (p < 0.01) and pravastatin (1.0 microM ) up to 1.8-fold (p < 0.01) after treatment of at least 24 h. This increase in adhesion was concentration dependent and was observed for treatment periods from 16 to 72 h. Inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis with mevalonate and geranyl-geraniol prevented the statin-induced effect on human and rat smooth muscle cells. Flow cytometry revealed an increased expression of alpha2- and beta1-integrins after treatment with atorvastatin (0.1 microM ) at 24 and 48 h. Atorvastatin increased levels of beta1-integrin mRNA after 12- and 24-h treatment in HSMCs, which was inhibited by mevalonate. Furthermore, atorvastatin (0.1 microM ) and pravastatin (1.0 microM ) inhibited chemotaxis of HSMCs on collagen I, which was also reversed by mevalonate treatment. In contrast, inhibition of beta1-integrins with a specific antibody nearly doubled (p < 0.01) the rate of chemotaxis. These data indicate that the chemotactic activity in HSMCs is inhibited in part by up-regulation of alpha2beta1-integrin receptors. The current study indicates that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors increase cell-matrix interaction with collagen I via induction of alpha2beta1-integrins and increased adhesion to collagen I.", 
    "38": "Micronized fenofibrate lowers total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to a similar extent as statins but raises high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lowers triglycerides to a greater extent. The comparative lipid-modifying efficacy of micronized fenofibrate and pravastatin has not been evaluated in dyslipidemic patients. This prospective, multicenter, randomized trial compared the efficacy of 3 months' treatment with micronized fenofibrate (200 mg once daily) or pravastatin (20 mg once daily) in hypercholesterolemic type IIa and mixed dyslipidemic type IIb patients. Two hundred sixty-five male and female patients (18-75 years) were recruited from 28 European centers, and 151 were analyzed. Micronized fenofibrate was at least as effective as pravastatin in reducing levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol in primary dyslipidemia but was significantly more effective than pravastatin in raising high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (respectively, 13.2% vs. 5.6%; p = 0.0084) and lowering triglycerides (-38.7% vs. -11.8%; p = 0.0001). In type IIa dyslipidemia, micronized fenofibrate was as effective as pravastatin in raising high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (+8.6% vs. +8.0%) but was fivefold more effective in lowering triglycerides (-34.3% vs. -7.2%; p = 0.0001). In type IIb dyslipidemic patients with low baseline high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, micronized fenofibrate was 10-fold and nearly 3-fold superior to pravastatin in raising high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lowering triglycerides, respectively. Micronized fenofibrate may be considered an effective first-line therapy for patients with primary hyperlipidemia, particularly those with type IIb mixed dyslipidemia or type 2 diabetes.", 
    "39": "Effects of FR194738 ((E)-N-ethyl-N-(6,6-dimethyl-2-hepten-4-ynyl)-3-[2-methyl-2-(3-thienylmethoxy)propyloxy]benzylamine hydrochloride), a squalene epoxidase inhibitor, on lipid metabolism were compared with those of pravastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, in hamsters. Drugs were given for 10 d either as a diet mixture or as a bolus oral gavage, and similar results were obtained with each type of administration. FR194738 (0.01-0.32% as a diet mixture; 10-100 mg/kg as an oral gavage) dose-dependently decreased serum total cholesterol, non high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and the changes in serum parameters were similar. Pravastatin (0.01-0.32% as a diet mixture; 1-100 mg/kg as an oral gavage) increased serum cholesterol levels, and dose-dependently decreased serum triglyceride levels. Although oral gavage of FR194738 at 32 mg/kg and pravastatin at 3.2 and 10 mg/kg increased hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity, the degree of the changes was far greater with the latter than the former drug. FR194738 slightly increased hepatic cholesterol content at 32 mg/kg, whereas pravastatin dose-dependently increased hepatic cholesterol content until it leveled off at 32 and 100 mg/kg. It is concluded that inhibition of squalene epoxidase and HMG-CoA reductase triggers both hypercholesterolemic (hepatic cholesterol synthesis) and hypocholesterolemic (hepatic cholesterol uptake) mechanisms. FR194738 appears to induce a greater enhancement of the latter rather than the former, whereas pravastatin has a greater effect on the former.", 
    "40": "Hyperlipidemia is primarily implicated in the progression of coronary heart disease (CHD) and its treatment is essential for patients with a history of CHD. Statins such as simvastatin, the lipid-lowering agents, are well-known for their ability to normalize patient's serum lipid levels. The Japan Lipid Intervention Trial study of simvastatin is the first nationwide investigation of the relationship between serum lipid levels and the development of CHD in Japanese patients with hypercholesterolemia. Of 5,127 patients, exclusively with a history of documented CHD at enrollment, 4,673 were treated with open-labeled simvastatin at an initial dose of 5-10 mg/day and were monitored for 6 years. The risk of coronary events tended to be higher in patients with a serum total cholesterol (TC) > or =240 mg/dl compared with total cholesterol <240 mg/dl. The concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) positively correlated and that of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) inversely correlated with the risk of CHD. Each 10 mg/dl decrease in LDL-C and each 10 mg/dl increase in HDL-C concentration reduced the risk of CHD by 8.0% (95% confidence interval 3.8-12.0) and 28.3% (95% CI 13.9-40.3), respectively. A reasonable therapeutic strategy to reduce CHD progression in patients with prior CHD under low-dose statin treatment might be regulating the serum LDL-C concentration to at least <120 mg/dl and HDL-C >40 mg/dl, respectively.", 
    "41": "Hyperlipidemia is a well-established risk factor for primary coronary heart disease (CHD). Although simvastatin is known to lower serum lipid concentrations, the protective effect of such lipid-lowering therapy against primary CHD has not been established in Japanese patients with hypercholesterolemia. The Japan Lipid Intervention Trial was a 6-year, nationwide cohort study of 47,294 patients treated with open-labeled simvastatin (5-10 mg/day) and monitored by physicians under standard clinical conditions. The aim of the study was to determine the relationship between the occurrence of CHD and the serum lipid concentrations during low-dose simvastatin treatment. Simvastatin reduced serum concentrations of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein- cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride (TG), by 18.4%, 26.8% and 16.1% on average, respectively, during the treatment period. The risk of coronary events was higher when the average TC concentration was > or =240 mg/dl and the average LDL-C concentration was > or =160 mg/dl. The incidence of coronary events increased in the patients with TG concentration > or =300 mg/dl compared with patients with TG concentration <150 mg/dl. The high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) inversely correlated with the risk of coronary events. The J-curve association was observed between average TC or LDL-C concentrations and total mortality. Malignancy was the most prevalent cause of death. The health of patients should be monitored closely when there is a remarkable decrease in TC and LDL-C concentrations with low-dose statin. A reasonable strategy to prevent coronary events in Japanese hypercholesterolemic patients without prior CHD under low-dose statin treatment might be regulating the serum lipid concentrations to at least <240 mg/dl for TC, <160 mg/dl for LDL-C, <300 mg/dl for TG, and >40 mg/dl for HDL-C.",

    "43": "Statins effectively inhibit cholesterol synthesis and are currently the most commonly used drugs for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. However, patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and those unwilling to take, or who cannot tolerate statins, and patients with combined hyperlipidemia require a combination treatment. Statins combined with cholesterol malabsorption, caused, e.g., by plant stanol esters or ezetimibe (Schering-Plough Corp/Merck & Co Inc), or with bile acid malabsorption, caused by bile acid binding resins or guar gum, inhibit compensatory increases in cholesterol synthesis and effectively lower LDL cholesterol levels. Combination therapy of statins with fibrates should be controlled by lipidology experts. Recent information on indications and advantages of combining statins with n-3 fatty acids, hormone replacement therapy, or niacin, will also be discussed.", 
    "44": "HMG-CoA reductase, in addition to being the rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, is involved in the regulation of receptors for low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. Clinical studies in men and women demonstrate that inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase (statins), by reducing plasma cholesterol, may limit the development of atherosclerosis and reduce the risk of mortality and ischemic events. Preclinical evidence suggests that under controlled conditions of plasma cholesterol lowering, statins may have ancillary properties or pleiotropic effects, which may directly limit atherosclerosis progression. In this review, pleiotropic effects have been defined as 'ancillary properties of statins, which result in hepatic and/or vascular changes that may or may not be a consequence of inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase.' Beyond the LDL lowering activity of statins, improvements have been noted in endothelial dysfunction through direct stimulation of expression of such vasodilators as nitric oxide and/or reduction in vasoconstrictors. Factors associated with atherogenesis, such as monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, macrophage production of proinflammatory molecules and matrix metalloproteases, smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration and macrophage-induced oxidation of LDL particles have also been reduced by various statins. It is unclear whether the observed pleiotropic effects are independent of LDL-cholesterol lowering or inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, and whether they are clinically relevant; however, one can conclude that the pleiotropic effects appear to be a class effect of statins and can be attenuated by addition of the post-reductase product, mevalonate.", 
    "45": "Concomitant use of gemfibrozil with statins, particularly with cerivastatin, increases the risk of rhabdomyolysis, but the mechanism of this potentially fatal drug interaction remains unclear. Our aim was to study the effect of gemfibrozil on cerivastatin pharmacokinetics.",

Gemfibrozil increased the AUC(0-infinity) of cerivastatin lactone, on average, to 440% (94% to 594%; P =.0024) and that of metabolite M-1 to 435% (216% to 802%; P =.0002) of the control (placebo) values, whereas the AUC(0-24) of metabolite M-23 was decreased to 22% (11% to 74%; P =.0017).", 
    "48": "Gemfibrozil greatly increases plasma concentrations of cerivastatin, cerivastatin lactone, and metabolite M-1, whereas the level of metabolite M-23 is markedly reduced by gemfibrozil. Gemfibrozil therefore inhibits the formation of M-23, which is thought to be dependent on CYP2C8. The increased exposure to cerivastatin in the presence of gemfibrozil may explain the high incidence of myopathy observed with this combination, although the role of pharmacodynamic interactions between these 2 agents cannot be excluded.", 
    "49": "The present review outlines the clinical relevance of pharmacokinetic drug interactions within the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor class. These interactions can result in markedly increased or decreased plasma concentrations of some drugs within this class. However, the relationship between altered plasma concentrations and adverse effects or toxicity may not be linear. It is likely that other variables affect this concentration-effect relationship including: rapid changes in the concentration, concomitant lipid-lowering therapy or host genetic factors that code for different forms or amounts of metabolising enzymes and drug receptors. It is not currently possible to predict which patients will manifest clinically important drug-drug interactions, nor what concentration of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor will cause rhabdomyolysis. Thus, until prescribers have better scientific information from which to develop a 'therapeutic range' for each agent, caution should be exercised. In particular, patients taking a CYP3A4-metabolised agent, e.g. atorvastatin, simvastatin and lovastatin, should not be started on a CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer without close monitoring.", 
    "50": "Nephrotic dyslipidemia is a risk factor for the development of systemic atherosclerosis, and may aggravate glomerulosclerosis and enhance progression of glomerular disease. The greatest and most consistent reductions in LDL-cholesterol are achieved with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors but their efficacy and safety in long-term therapy need to be evaluated. In this study, we gave fluvastatin to 21 nephrotic patients and followed then up clinically, neurophysiologically and by laboratory tests. There was an improvement in the lipogram, with reductions of triglycerides (TG) (33%) and LDL (35%) at three months. There was no clinical manifestation of myopathy and CPK was normal. Electromyographic data showed significant decreases in the amplitude and duration of motor unit action potentials in the proximal muscles with statin therapy, but these changes did not amount to classic myopathy. We conclude that fluvastatin is a safe drug for long-term use in dyslipidemic nephrotic patients. However, we suggest further studies to verify whether the early electromyography (EMG) changes observed in this study may progress or not on its longer term use.",

According to the guidelines, the global assessment of cardiovascular risk is based on traditional risk factors (RF-CV). The emergence of new RF-CV is helpful. However, at every level of risk factor exposure, there is a substantial variation of atherosclerosis. Thus, subclinical disease measurements, representing the end result of risk exposure may be useful for improving cardiovascular risk prediction.

Despite the ability of hormone replacement therapy to improve serum lipid profiles, randomized trials of hormone therapy have demonstrated no benefit in reducing coronary outcomes among postmenopausal women. In contrast, data from over 8,000 women enrolled in the statin trials demonstrate that lipid lowering with statins is as effective at reducing cardiovascular outcomes in women as it is in men and suggest that statins should be considered standard of care for the prevention of adverse cardiovascular events in women at risk for coronary heart disease.",

Statins have been shown to possess modest antioxidant and antiplatelet aggregatory effect. We postulated that statins may accordingly inhibit arterial thrombus formation. To assess the antithrombotic effects of atorvastatin, a commonly used statin, in response to an oxidant stimulus, we fed Sprague-Dawley rats either regular chow, or chow mixed with atorvastatin (1.25 mg/kg) for 10 days (n = 16 in each group). Eight rats in each group were also given oxidized low-density lipoprotein intravenously prior to the induction of thrombus. An occlusive thrombus was created in the abdominal aorta by application of Whatman paper soaked in 35% FeCl3. The time to occlusive thrombus formation was not altered by administration of oxidized low-density lipoprotein in the rats fed regular chow or chow mixed with atorvastatin. However, time to thrombosis was increased in the group given chow mixed with atorvastatin (26 +/- 4 minutes vs. 20 +/- 5 minutes, P < 0.02). To determine the mechanism of atorvastatin's antithrombotic effect, we measured the expression of endothelial constitutive nitric oxide synthase (cNOS) in rat aortas by Western analysis. The cNOS protein expression was enhanced 75% in rats fed chow with atorvastatin (P < 0.01 vs. rats fed regular chow). Plasma levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol were similar in all groups. This study shows that atorvastatin delays thrombus formation in arterial channels exposed to oxidant stress. This effect of atorvastatin appears to be related to increased expression of cNOS, which is known to inhibit platelet aggregation and induce vasodilatation. The effects of atorvastatin are independent of its effects on plasma cholesterol levels.",

The identification and treatment of these patients should therefore be a high priority for clinicians. Guidelines from medical organizations, such as the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP ATP) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA), suggest that patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels > or =130 mg/dL, and perhaps even those with levels > or =100 mg/dL, should receive drug therapy. Optimal LDL-C levels have been set at <100 mg/dL and <115 mg/dL for high-risk patients by US and European guidelines, respectively. However, a recent survey shows that only about 20% of high-risk patients currently meet these goals. In order to achieve therapeutic targets for LDL-C, the statins are the foundation of treatment, as they are the most effective and best-tolerated form of lipid-lowering therapy. Other therapeutic options include bile acid sequestrants, niacin, and plant stanols, although seldom as monotherapy. Combination therapy with a statin and one of these other lipid-lowering agents can be useful in patients who are unable to achieve target lipid levels through monotherapy. There remains, however, a need for additional agents. Some of the new options for reducing LDL-C levels that may be available in the near future include 2 new statins, pitavastatin and rosuvastatin. In patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, rosuvastatin, which is currently under review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has been shown to produce significantly greater reductions in LDL-C than atorvastatin over its full dose range. In comparative clinical trials, it has also enabled more patients with primary hypercholesterolemia to meet lipid goals than atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin. Inhibitors of bile acid transport or cholesterol absorption may also have therapeutic value. The first cholesterol absorption inhibitor, ezetimibe, which has just been approved by the FDA, appears to be most effective when combined with a statin. It is anticipated that such new options will allow clinicians to optimize the management of dyslipidemia in high-risk patients, thereby reducing the morbidity and mortality of CHD.", 
    "112": "3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (HMGR) catalyzes the committed step in cholesterol biosynthesis. HMGR is the target of compounds (HMGR inhibitors, commonly referred to as statins) that are very effective in lowering serum cholesterol levels. These inhibitors have K(i) values in the nanomolar range and are widely prescribed in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. We have determined structures of this enzyme in complexes with 6 different statins (compactin, simvastatin, fluvastatin, cerivastatin, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin). The statins occupy a portion of the binding site of HMG-CoA, thus blocking access of this substrate to the active site. The nicotinamide binding pocket of NADP(H) (the second substrate of the enzyme) is unoccupied by the inhibitor molecules. Near the C-terminus of HMGR, several catalytically relevant residues are disordered in the enzyme-statin complexes. The flexibility of these residues is critical for binding with statins; if ordered, they would sterically hinder such binding.", 
    "113": "Until the recent introduction of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), the potential effect of cholesterol lowering on the prevention of clinical manifestations of coronary disease was a matter of debate. In trials conducted before the introduction of statins, cholesterol levels were lowered, on average, by only approximately 10%, resulting in prevention of coronary events but with no effect on total mortality rates. However, statins have been able to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by a mean of roughly 28%, significantly decreasing both relative and absolute risk levels of coronary events and total mortality. These benefits have been demonstrated not only in middle-aged men but also in women and patients aged >65 years. Aggressive cholesterol lowering has also been shown to yield larger decreases in the incidence of subsequent coronary events than angioplasty, and to reduce the occurrence of such events in patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery, which raises the question of whether these procedures should be relegated to symptom relief, with cholesterol lowering as the primary means of coronary heart disease event prevention. Statins, therefore, have unequivocally shown the importance of cholesterol lowering in the prevention of morbidity and mortality due to coronary disease. Ongoing research will elucidate the role of statin therapy in the prevention of strokes and in the treatment of patients aged >75 years, and future trials will be needed to evaluate the potential role of statins in primary prevention for younger populations who cannot control cholesterol with lifestyle changes.",

Since clinical studies indicate that atorvastatin inhibits the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel, we investigated whether CYP3A4 metabolized clopidogrel in vitro. Microsomes prepared from dexamethasone-pretreated rats metabolized clopidogrel at a rate of 3.8 nmol min(-1) nmol of p450(-1), which is 65 and 1270% faster than the rate of metabolism by microsomes from control and beta-napthoflavone-treated rats, respectively. To identify the human p450s responsible for clopidogrel oxidation, genetically engineered microsomes containing a single human p450 isozyme were tested for their ability to oxidize clopidogrel. CYP3A4 and 3A5 metabolized clopidogrel at a significantly higher rate than eight other p450 isozymes, suggesting that CYP3A4 and 3A5 are primarily responsible for in vivo clopidogrel metabolism. Clopidogrel interacts with human CYP3A4 with a spectral dissociation constant (K(s)), K(m), and V(max) of 12 microM, 14 +/- 1 microM and 6.7 +/- 1 nmol min(-1) nmol p450(-1), respectively. Atorvastatin lactone, the physiologically relevant substrate, inhibits clopidogrel with a K(i) of 6 microM. When clopidogrel and atorvastatin are present at equimolar concentrations, clopidogrel metabolism is inhibited by greater than 90%. Since CYP3A4 and 3A5 metabolize clopidogrel faster than other human p450 isozymes and are the most abundant p450s in human liver, they are predicted to be predominantly responsible for the activation of clopidogrel in vivo.", 
    "115": "Synaptophysin interacts with synaptobrevin in membranes of adult small synaptic vesicles. The synaptophysin/synaptobrevin complex promotes synaptobrevin to built up functional SNARE complexes thereby modulating synaptic efficiency. Synaptophysin in addition is a cholesterol-binding protein. Depleting the membranous cholesterol content by filipin or beta-methylcyclodextrin (beta-MCD) decreased the solubility of synaptophysin in Triton X-100 with less effects on synaptobrevin. In small synaptic vesicles from rat brain the synaptophysin/synaptobrevin complex was diminished upon beta-MCD treatment as revealed by chemical cross-linking. Mice with a genetic mutation in the Niemann-Pick C1 gene developing a defect in cholesterol sorting showed significantly reduced amounts of the synaptophysin/synaptobrevin complex compared to their homo- or heterozygous littermates. Finally when using primary cultures of mouse hippocampus the synaptophysin/synaptobrevin complex was down-regulated after depleting the endogenous cholesterol content by the HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor lovastatin. Alternatively, treatment with cholesterol up-regulated the synaptophysin/synaptobrevin interaction in these cultures. These data indicate that the synaptophysin/synaptobrevin interaction critically depends on a high cholesterol content in the membrane of synaptic vesicles. Variations in the availability of cholesterol may promote or impair synaptic efficiency by interfering with this complex.", 
    "116": "Statins are inhibitors of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, a ubiquitous enzyme critical for the biosynthesis of cholesterol. Because of their cholesterol-lowering properties, statins are extensively used in medical practice, and large clinical trials have shown that statins effectively reduce cardiovascular related morbidity and mortality. In the past 5 years, an important, new concept suggesting that the cardioprotective effects of statins are not necessarily related to cholesterol-lowering actions has emerged. Indeed, in vivo findings have clearly shown that statins exert anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects and that they modulate vascular remodeling under normocholesterolemic conditions. These pleiotropic properties of statins affect important molecules in vascular biology and help preserve endothelial function in acute and chronic inflammatory states of the cardiovascular system, including coronary and cerebral artery diseases, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Emerging evidence indicates that the microcirculation is a crucial target for the pleiotropic actions of statins because of its important role in regulating blood flow, leukocyte-endothelium interactions, and vascular remodeling. Accordingly, this review focuses on the role that the microcirculation plays in the vascular protective action of statins.", 
    "117": "The objective was to study whether coronary blood flow or its response to pravastatin are affected by genetic variation in the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene. Vascular endothelial nitric oxide maintains endothelium-dependent vasodilatation and also mediates antithrombotic actions. Its formation is catalyzed by eNOS, a constitutive enzyme, which has a polymorphic site in intron 4 (4a/b). Some clinical studies have suggested an association of the rare a-allele of eNOS with coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. We carried out a double-blind placebo-controlled study involving 43 men (aged 35+/-4 years), who were randomized to receive either 40 mg/day pravastatin ( n=21) or placebo ( n=22) for 6 months. Myocardial blood flow was measured by positron emission tomography (PET) using (15)O-labeled water. PET was performed at rest and after stimulation by adenosine infusion. PET and lipid analyses were carried out at baseline and after 6 months. eNOS genotyping was done by PCR. At baseline there were no differences in basal or adenosine-stimulated coronary blood flow between subjects with either eNOS bb or ba genotypes. At the end of the study genotypes reacted differently between pravastatin and placebo groups with respect to the change in adenosine-stimulated flow (ANCOVA P=0.008). More specifically, after pravastatin treatment the adenosine-stimulated flow increased by 54.5% in men with the eNOS ba genotype, whereas in the men with the bb genotype no significant change in flow was observed ( P=0.002 for ba versus bb). In the placebo group there were no significant changes in blood flow from the baseline values ( P=0.916 for ba versus bb). After pravastatin treatment both genotype groups showed a similar decrease in serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( P<0.00001 for both). Our results suggest that adenosine-stimulated myocardial perfusion improves after treatment with pravastatin in subjects with the eNOS ba genotype but not in those with the bb genotype. This effect is not dependent on the decrease of serum cholesterol.", 
    "118": "Information about lipid abnormalities and the effect of lipid lowering therapy in the early stage of renal disease is limited, while preventive treatment in this stage might be much more beneficial. Lipid profiles and risk factors were assessed in 150 consecutive, non-diabetic patients. Preventive therapy consisted of cholesterol-reduced diet and atorvastatin 10 mg daily. Patients were considered at risk for cardiovascular disease if LDL-cholesterol was >2.6 mmol/l in the case of manifest cardiovascular disease (n=28) or when they had manifest cardiovascular risk factors (n=105) or if LDL was >3.5 mmol/l (n=17). A total of 128 patients (85%) had increased LDL. In men <60 years and women <40 years, total cholesterol was higher than in the general population. Linear regression analysis showed a decreased creatinine clearance to be significantly associated with the lipid profile. For a 10 ml/min decrease of creatinine clearance, a 0.085 increase of the total cholesterol to HDL ratio was observed (P=0.005). In similar analyses, proteinuria was strongly associated with cholesterol and triglycerides. An increase of 0.28 of the total cholesterol/HDL ratio was observed for each gram per 24 h proteinuria (P<0.001). On atorvastatin 10 mg daily, 30 of 60 treated patients had achieved their target LDL value. On average, LDL-cholesterol was reduced by 39% and triglycerides by 18%. No patient had to interrupt their treatment because of adverse side-effects. In conclusion, the majority of patients had an elevated LDL and other lipid abnormalities. Short-term therapy with atorvastatin and a cholesterol lowering diet appears to be safe and effective. It is probably useful to determine the lipid profile in patients with renal failure already in an early phase and to start lipid lowering treatment as soon as abnormalities are found.",

    "123": "In the new millennium, humans will be traveling to Mars and eventually beyond with skeletons that respond to microgravity by self-destructing. Meanwhile in Earth's aging populations growing numbers of men and many more women are suffering from crippling bone loss. During the first decade after menopause all women suffer an accelerating loss of bone, which in some of them is severe enough to result in \"spontaneous\" crushing of vertebrae and fracturing of hips by ordinary body movements. This is osteoporosis, which all too often requires prolonged and expensive care, the physical and mental stress of which may even kill the patient. Osteoporosis in postmenopausal women is caused by the loss of estrogen. The slower development of osteoporosis in aging men is also due at least in part to a loss of the estrogen made in ever smaller amounts in bone cells from the declining level of circulating testosterone and is needed for bone maintenance as it is in women. The loss of estrogen increases the generation, longevity, and activity of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. The destructive osteoclast surge can be blocked by estrogens and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) as well as antiosteoclast agents such as bisphosphonates and calcitonin. But these agents stimulate only a limited amount of bone growth as the unaffected osteoblasts fill in the holes that were dug by the now suppressed osteoclasts. They do not stimulate osteoblasts to make bone--they are antiresorptives not bone anabolic agents. (However, certain estrogen analogs and bisphosphates may stimulate bone growth to some extent by lengthening osteoblast working lives.) To grow new bone and restore bone strength lost in space and on Earth we must know what controls bone growth and destruction. Here we discuss the newest bone controllers and how they might operate. These include leptin from adipocytes and osteoblasts and the statins that are widely used to reduce blood cholesterol and cardiovascular damage. But the main focus of this article is necessarily the currently most promising of the anabolic agents, the potent parathyroid hormone (PTH) and certain of its 31- to 38-aminoacid fragments, which are either in or about to be in clinical trial or in the case of Lilly's Forteo [hPTH-(1-34)] tentatively approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating osteoporosis and mending fractures.", 
    "124": "Rosuvastatin, a new statin, has been shown to possess a number of advantageous pharmacological properties, including enhanced HMG-CoA reductase binding characteristics, relative hydrophilicity, and selective uptake into/activity in hepatic cells. Cytochrome p450 (CYP) metabolism of rosuvastatin appears to be minimal and is principally mediated by the 2C9 enzyme, with little involvement of 3A4; this finding is consistent with the absence of clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between rosuvastatin and other drugs known to inhibit CYP enzymes. Dose-ranging studies in hypercholesterolemic patients demonstrated dose-dependent effects in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (up to 63%), total cholesterol, and apolipoprotein (apo) B across a 1- to 40-mg dose range and a significant 8.4% additional reduction in LDL-C, compared with atorvastatin, across the dose ranges of the two agents. Rosuvastatin has also been shown to be highly effective in reducing LDL-C, increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and producing favorable modifications of other elements of the atherogenic lipid profile in a wide range of dyslipidemic patients. In patients with mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia, rosuvastatin has been shown to produce large decreases in LDL-C at starting doses, thus reducing the need for subsequent dose titration, and to allow greater percentages of patients to attain lipid goals, compared with available statins. The substantial LDL-C reductions and improvements in other lipid measures with rosuvastatin treatment should facilitate achievement of lipid goals and reduce the requirement for combination therapy in patients with severe hypercholesterolemia. In addition, rosuvastatin's effects in reducing triglycerides, triglyceride-containing lipoproteins, non-HDL-C, and LDL-C and increasing HDL-C in patients with mixed dyslipidemia or elevated triglycerides should be of considerable value in enabling achievement of LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals in the numerous patients with combined dyslipidemias or metabolic syndrome who require lipid-lowering therapy. Rosuvastatin is well tolerated alone, and in combination with fenofibrate, extended-release niacin, and cholestyramine, and has a safety profile similar to that of currently marketed statins. A large, long-term clinical trials program is under way to investigate the effects of rosuvastatin on atherosclerosis and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.",

CRP levels was very effectively reduced after the treatment (-15.92%, P<0.001). No association between basal CRP levels and basal lipids and Lp(a) concentrations was observed.

    "129": "Severe aortic plaques seen on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) are a high-risk cause of stroke and peripheral embolization. Evidence to guide therapy is lacking. Retrospective information was obtained regarding the occurrence of embolic events (stroke, transient ischemic attacks, or peripheral emboli) in 519 patients with severe thoracic aortic plaque seen on TEE since 1988. Treatment with statins, warfarin, or antiplatelet medications was noted. Treatment was not randomized. In a matched-paired analysis, each patient taking each class of therapy was matched for age, gender, previous embolic event, hypertension, diabetes, congestive failure, and atrial fibrillation to someone not taking that medication. Multivariate analysis was also performed. An embolic event occurred in 111 patients (21%). Multivariate analysis showed that statin use was independently protective against recurrent events (p = 0.0001). Matched analysis also showed a protective effect of statins (p = 0.0004; absolute risk reduction 17%, relative risk reduction 59%, number needed to treat [n = 6]). No protective effect was found for warfarin or antiplatelet drugs. The odds ratio for embolic events was 0.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.2 to 0.6) for statin therapy, 0.7 (95% CI 0.4 to 1.2) for warfarin, and 1.4 (95% CI 0.8 to 2.4) for antiplatelet agents.

To accomplish this, the \"complete\" vascular surgeon must understand the common lipid abnormalities, their diagnosis, and treatment. The scientific literature on this subject is truly overwhelming in volume and scope, yet an overly simple \"cook book\" approach is not adequate or appropriate.

    "136": "Mevalonic aciduria (MA) and hyper-IgD and periodic fever syndrome (HIDS) are two inherited disorders both caused by depressed mevalonate kinase (MK) activity. MK is the first enzyme to follow the highly regulated 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase (HMGR), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the isoprenoid/cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. In fibroblasts of MA patients, but not of HIDS patients, HMGR activity is elevated under normal growth conditions. This activity is down-regulated when cells are supplemented with the isoprenoid precursors geraniol, farnesol, and geranylgeraniol, and a mixture of 25-hydroxycholesterol and cholesterol. This indicates that the regulation of the pathway in these cells is not disturbed. The elevated HMGR activity is probably due to a shortage of non-sterol isoprenoid end products, as indicated by normal HMGR mRNA levels in MA fibroblasts. Furthermore, the HMGR activity in MA cells was more sensitive to geranylgeraniol suppression and less sensitive to sterol suppression than the HMGR activity in low density lipoprotein receptor-deficient cells. HMGR activity in MA cells was down-regulated also by addition of its product mevalonate to the culture medium. Thus, it appears that the elevation of mevalonate levels, which are high in MA patients and moderate in HIDS patients, allows the cells to compensate for the depressed MK activity. Indeed, the isoprenylation of Ras and RhoA protein appeared normal in HIDS and MA fibroblasts under normal conditions but showed increased sensitivity toward inhibition of HMGR by simvastatin. Our results indicate that MK-deficient cells maintain the flux through the isoprenoid/cholesterol biosynthesis pathway by elevating intracellular mevalonate levels.", 
    "137": "High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is positively associated with the prevalence of coronary artery disease by epidemiologic data. Prospective studies indicate that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors reduced the plasma hs-CRP concentration and the risk of recurrent coronary events after myocardial infarction. Type 2 diabetes is associated with high mortality risk of coronary heart disease and this high risk may be involved in the inflammatory factors. We have therefore conducted a prospective study to assess whether simvastatin can rapidly reduce the plasma hs-CRP concentration in type 2 diabetic patients with hyperlipidemia. Seventeen type 2 diabetic patients with hyperlipidemia were enrolled in the study after 6 weeks on a lipid-lowering diet. Fourteen patients completed the study, taking simvastatin 20 mg daily for 8 weeks. Fasting blood samples were collected from each patient before and after 8-week administration of simvastatin. In response to 8-week administration of simvastatin, hs-CRP levels significantly decreased from 0.312+/-0.057 to 0.193+/-0.045 mg/dl (P<.01). Plasma LDL cholesterol also decreased significantly from 130+/-9 to 74+/-3 mg/dl (P=.001). This study shows that plasma hs-CRP concentration can be reduced by 8-week administration of simvastatin in type 2 diabetic patients with hyperlipidemia.", 
    "138": "Phosphorylation of cdk2 on threonine 160 is essential for kinase activity. Mevastatin, an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, inhibits cell growth through inhibition of cdk2 and this has been suggested to be due to enhancement of p21 levels. In a prostate cancer cell line, PC3, mevastatin treatment led to elevated levels of p21 and caused a small increase in the p21 associated with cdk2. However, this increase in the associated p21 appeared out of proportion with the resulting dramatic inhibition of kinase activity. Using RNA interference we show that mevastatin inhibits cdk2 activity despite lack of induction of p21, p27, and p57. Instead the kinase was inhibited due to a decrease in activating phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of cdk2 from mevastatin-treated cells with exogenous cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)-activating enzymes restored its functional activity. The only known mammalian cyclin H.cdk7.mat1 complex (cdk2-activating kinase, Cak), was not inhibited by mevastatin, suggesting either that a different CAK is responsible for cdk2 phosphorylation in vivo or that the regulation is at the level of substrate accessibility or of cdk2 dephosphorylation. These results suggest that mevastatin inhibits cdk2 activity in PC3 cells through the inhibition of Thr-160 phosphorylation of cdk2, providing a novel example of regulation of cdk2 at this level.", 
    "139": "Reduction of plasma cholesterol by statins is fundamental to prevent coronary heart disease. Such therapy is often sub-optimal, however, particularly in patients with reduced LDL receptors (familial hypercholesterolemia), and novel or adjuvant therapies are therefore warranted. Cholesterol elimination is profoundly influenced by the rate of its conversion to bile acids (BA), regulated by the enzyme Cyp7a1. Induced fecal loss of BA by resin treatment reduces plasma cholesterol, presumably through induction of hepatic LDL receptors (LDLR). We here describe the effect of PR835, a drug belonging to a new class of lipid-lowering agents that inhibit the Slc10a2 protein, the intestinal transporter responsible for active uptake of BA. Treatment reduced plasma cholesterol by 40% in mice devoid of both the LDLR and its ligand, apoE, while triglycerides and HDL cholesterol were unchanged. Cyp7a1 enzyme activity and mRNA were induced several-fold, and hepatic HMG CoA reductase mRNA increased, mirroring an induced synthesis of BA and cholesterol. The addition of a statin potentiated the effect, leading to reductions of plasma total and LDL cholesterol by 64% and 70%, respectively. These effects could not be attributed to induction of other known hepatic lipoprotein receptors and indicate the presence of new points of targeting in lipid-lowering therapy.", 
    "140": "Increased circulating cholesterol has been long linked to an increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), and is now linked to an increased risk of developing Alzheimer s disease (AD). We first showed the neuropathologic link between CAD and AD as increased incidence of cerebral senile plaques in both disorders. We then showed that AD-like neuropathology occurred in the brains of cholesterol-fed rabbits; including increased -amyloid (Ab). Currently there are a number of transgenic mouse models of AD that exhibit enhanced Ab pathology if cholesterol diet is administered. Culture studies clearly show that excess cholesterol enhances beta-metabolism of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and production of -amyloidogenic peptides, and that sufficiently reducing cholesterol levels by inhibition of synthesis completely inhibits all beta-metabolism of APP. Our finding that the elevated levels of Ab in rabbits fed cholesterol diet could be cleared from the brain by resuming a control diet prompted the hypothesis that lowering cholesterol levels in the blood of AD patients may be of some clinical benefit. Pilot data suggests that therapeutically lowering circulating cholesterol may attenuate Ab production in the cholesterol-fed rabbit brain, may stabilize cognitive performance in mildly impaired AD patients, and may reduce the risk of developing AD. Accordingly, we have initiated a double-blind treatment trial evaluating Atorvastatin Na+ among 120 mild-to-moderately impaired AD subjects randomized to one of two groups receiving placebo or active drug once a day. Atorvastatin is one of a general class of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor drugs called statins that lower cholesterol by inhibition of synthesis. We chose to use Atorvastatin in this AD Treatment Trial because it does not cross the blood-brain-barrier, and believe it would be ill-advised to use a statin that does. This position stems from the observations that excess cholesterol inhibits cholesterol synthesis and increases Ab production, that Ab kills cells in part by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis, and that statins acting at the neuronal level could further exacerbate degeneration in AD by further inhibition of necessary cholesterol synthesis.",

    "155": "Data from 2229 screened FH-relatives, including age, sex, risk factor status and screening outcome, were combined with the Framingham risk function and national disease-specific cost data to arrive at a model-based comparison of survival and costs, with and without the screening programme. Cost-effectiveness ratios were computed for various treatment strategies, with no screening as reference. Costs per life year gained varied between 25.5- and 32-thousand Euros, depending upon the precise treatment strategy after a positive screen. The costs for screening (tracing the FH-positive individuals) were much lower than the follow-up costs (treatment), of which 80% were costs for statins. Consequently, the costs per life year gained of alternative screening programmes are about the same.", 
    "156": "The cost-effectiveness ratio of FH screening is within the range requiring explicit political consideration in The Netherlands. As the costs of statin treatment are the single most important determinant of costs, policy decisions reduce to decisions on the acceptability of statin treatment for this risk group. Pending major changes in statin price, clear guidelines should be developed on how screen positive individuals should be treated, since not all of them have an elevated cholesterol level.", 
    "157": "Besides lowering lipid levels, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) modulate endothelial function and decrease vascular tone. The effect of statin therapy on blood pressure has not been previously examined in renal transplant recipients.", 
    "158": "We identified 113 stable recipients with graft survival>1 year and started on a statin >or=1 year post-transplant with no subsequent alteration in type or dose, as well as >or=6 months' follow-up post-statin introduction along with no changes in antihypertensive medication type or dosage. This \"statin\" group was compared to a control group matched 1:1 by age, gender, donor source, year of transplant, and time since transplant who met identical criteria but were not begun on a statin. Baseline, 6 months, and 12 months outpatient blood pressure were reviewed and compared along with other possible blood pressure predictors. A multivariate analysis was performed controlling for other influences on blood pressure change.", 
    "159": "Blood pressure and baseline characteristics other than lipid levels were similar in the two groups. The systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure decreased by 7 mm Hg (P = 0.005), 3 mm Hg (P = 0.05), and 4 mm Hg (P = 0.007), respectively, at 12 months' post-statin introduction, while no blood pressure change was seen in the control group (P = NS). At 12 months, the systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressures were lower in the statin group compared to the control group (P = 0.05, 0.03, and 0.02, respectively). These changes in blood pressure were independent of changes in serum lipid levels.",

    "161": "Previous studies demonstrate that renal cortical/proximal tubule cholesterol accumulation is part of the renal \"stress response.\" The present study was performed to help define underlying mechanisms, using experimental sepsis as a test model.", 
    "162": "Male CD-1 mice and female low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) knockout mice were injected with a heat-killed Escherichia coli suspension. Renal cortex and serum were obtained from these and control mice either 4, 6, or 18 hours later. Tissues samples were assayed for free cholesterol (FC), cholesteryl esters (CE), HMG CoA reductase (HMGCR) mRNA, and SR-B1 [the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) receptor/cholesterol transporter]. Statin effects on renal cortical HMGCR mRNA and FC/CE levels also were assessed. Finally, the impact of serum from septic versus normal mice on cultured proximal tubule (HK-2) cell cholesterol levels was assessed.", 
    "163": "Sepsis induced approximately 30% and 300 to 500% increases in renal FC and CE content, respectively. Cholesterol accumulation was not blunted in LDLR-/- mice versus their controls. Statin therapy also did not alter sepsis-induced renal FC/CE accumulation. However, statin treatment exerted no discernible intra-renal activity (for example, no rise in renal HMGCR mRNA), despite significant extra-renal activity (25% reduction in serum cholesterol; 400% increase in hepatic HMGCR mRNA). HK-2 cells exposed to septic serum sustained a 40% cholesterol increase, compared to cells exposed to control serum. This response was completely statin inhibited, proving that de novo synthesis was involved. Sepsis markedly suppressed renal levels of SR-B1 (an FC efflux protein). Renal HMGCR mRNA did not fall despite sepsis triggered cholesterol loading, indicating a failure of negative feedback activity.", 
    "164": "Sepsis-induced renal cholesterol accumulation is not simply an intrinsic renal response, since it can be enhanced by circulating \"stress factors\" that drive HMGCR activity. Sepsis also down-regulates SR-B1. Thus, decreased cell FC efflux, coupled with increased synthesis, may synergistically induce the post-sepsis cholesterol overload state.", 
    "165": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) may modulate cellular inflammatory functions independent of serum cholesterol. We tested the hypothesis that statins decrease respiratory burst activity of human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) in response to anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA).", 
    "166": "Neutrophils were isolated from healthy human volunteers, human immunoglobulins were isolated from patients with proteinase-3 (PR3)- and myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA. Superoxide generation was measured by the ferricytochrome C assay and the nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) test. ANCA antigen expression was measured by flow cytometry and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was assessed by Western blotting.", 
    "167": "Cerivastatin and simvastatin inhibited respiratory burst activity to ANCA dose-dependently (1 to 25 micromol/L). Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-primed neutrophils released 26.7 +/- 2.8 nmol O2-/0.75 x 106 PMN/45 min and 10 micromol/L simvastatin reduced this amount to 18.0 +/- 2.1 nmol. The inhibitory effect was confirmed by the NBT test. The respiratory burst decrease could not be reversed by 500 micromol/L mevalonic acid (MVA). In this assay, both statins also inhibited the response to human ANCA. PR3-ANCA resulted in 19.4 +/- 2.0 nmol O2- nmol. This amount was decreased to 6.0 +/- 1.2 nmol by preincubation with 10 micromol/L simvastatin (P < 0.01). For MPO-ANCA, the values were 22.6 +/- 2.8 nmol for controls versus 16.7 +/- 3.1 nmol with statin (P < 0.01). By FACS, simvastatin decreased TNF-alpha-mediated ANCA antigen translocation (from 219 +/- 33 to 180 +/- 35 MFI for PR3 and 24.0 +/- 2.4 to 18.3 +/- 1.1 for MPO). Finally, since p38 MAPK and ERK control TNF-alpha priming, we studied the effects of both statins on MAPK. Western blotting showed that statins inhibited TNF-alpha-induced ERK phosphorylation in a dose dependent fashion, but had no effect on p38.", 
    "168": "These findings demonstrate that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors decrease respiratory burst activity of human PMN in response to ANCA. This effect was independent of mevalonate, but involved inhibition of ERK activation during TNF-alpha priming. Our data suggest that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may help limit inflammatory responses.", 
    "169": "Anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of statins. 3-Hydroxy-3-methyl-gutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors or statins constitute the most powerful class of lipid-lowering drugs. Clinical trials have demonstrated a marked reduction in cardiovascular mortality in patients treated with statins. However, the benefits observed with statin therapy appear to be related, at least in part, with their cholesterol-lowering independent effects. Extensive research carried out mainly in the last decade suggests that the clinical benefits of these drugs could be related to an improvement in endothelial dysfunction, a reduction in blood thrombogenicity, anti-inflammatory properties, and, recently, immunomodulatory actions. In this sense, statins decrease T cell activation, the recruitment of monocytes and T cells into the arterial wall, and enhance the stability of atherosclerotic lesions. Many of these effects are related with the inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis, which serve as a lipid attachment for a variety of proteins implicated in intracellular signaling. In fact, small G proteins, whose proper membrane localization and function are dependent on isoprenylation, may play an important role in the lipid-lowering independent effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. This article summarizes the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of statins and their participation in the different steps of atherosclerotic lesion formation.", 
    "170": "The new combination of niacin extended-release (ER) and lovastatin (Advicor, Kos pharmaceuticals), is a powerful lipid modifying agent and takes advantage of the different mechanisms of action of its two components. Niacin decreases hepatic atherogenic apolipoprotein (apo) B production whereas lovastatin increases apoB removal. Whereas niacin potently increases high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels by decreasing hepatic removal of antiatherogenic apoA-I particles, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase inhibitors ('statins') appear to increase production of apoA-I. Although there is no outcome data with this combination product, each component has been independently associated with a reduction of cardiovascular event risk by approximately 25 - 35%. The results of a long-term trial in 814 patients, where > 600 had been treated for 6 months and > 200 for 1 year, found reductions of 45 and 42% in low density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, respectively, at the maximum dose (niacin ER 2000 mg/ lovastatin 40 mg). HDL cholesterol increased by 41%. In addition, the combination decreased lipoprotein (a) by 25% and C-reactive protein by 24%. The niacin ER/lovastatin combination was generally well-tolerated. Flushing was the most common side effect, with approximately 10% of patients intolerant to niacin ER/lovastatin. Hepatotoxicity in this study was 0.5% and myopathy did not occur. Recent studies indicate that niacin can be used safely in diabetic patients who have good glucose control (HbA(1c) < 9%). Once-daily niacin ER/lovastatin exhibits potent synergistic actions on multiple lipid risk factors and represents an effective new agent in the clinical management of dyslipidaemia. Outcome studies are needed to evaluate if combination therapy would result in additive effects on morbidity and mortality.",

The first group named \"new users\" included patients in whom statin therapy was initiated during March 2000. The second group named \"long term users\" included patients who have been treated by statin therapy for one year or more. A sample of patients were randomly selected among these two groups. Trained Health Insurance advisors analyzed in depth the patients medical history and diet. All biological results were recorded and a complete history of medical therapy was assessed for each patient. An algorithm allowed the advisor to rate for nonadherence according to French medical guidelines.",

Nonadherence concerned: LDL cholesterol level not tested (32%) and/or absence of prior fat-free diet (37%) and/or LDL cholesterol value before drug therapy was below the guidelines/threshold. \"Long term users\": the random sample consisted of 582 patients, among whom 381 (65%) were free of CHD. The nonadherence rate was 71.1% (66.5% to 75.7%). In addition, the nonadherence rate for patients in secondary prevention was 82.1% (79.7% to 84.6%) respectively, corresponding to: LDL cholesterol level not tested (41% and 34%); and/or no change dietary (18% and 12%); and/or unreach the LDL-C target level (24% and 45%).",

Leukocyte-endothelial interactions in the postischemic retina were evaluated in vivo with a scanning laser ophthalmoscope. Statin was administered 5 minutes before the induction of retinal ischemia. P-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) gene expression in the postischemic retina were studied with the semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction. Histologic studies were carried out to evaluate retinal damage.", 
    "179": "The preadministration of statin attenuated the rolling and accumulation of leukocytes, decreased P-selectin and ICAM-1 expression, and reduced the number of apoptotic cells in the retina. Furthermore, histologic evaluation 168 hours after reperfusion showed that statin significantly diminished the resultant retinal tissue damage. The neuroprotective effect of statin was abolished when it was administered along with a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, nitroglycerine-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester.",

    "182": "Saint James' Hospital is a 650-bed tertiary referral hospital. An audit was performed of acute transmural myocardial infarctions for the years 1996 to 1999 inclusive. On average there were 2043 cardiology admissions annually, 9.8% of all hospital admissions. Acute transmural myocardial infarction was diagnosed in 178 patients annually, and was less common during the summer. The figure of 72% receiving revascularisation therapy (thrombolysis 67%, primary angioplasty 5%) compares favourably with 35% in 1992. The main reason for not receiving thrombolysis was late presentation (15%) with contraindications present in only 5%. The case fatality rate was 16% confirming the higher mortality in clinical practice than that of thrombolytic trials. The prescription of aspirin or warfarin (99%) and betablockers (67%) was in line with international trials. The use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (34%) and statins (28%) is similar to other studies but less than would be expected according to trial evidence.", 
    "183": "We compared the implementation of secondary prevention some 18 months following acute myocardial infarction or coronary artery bypass surgery in Ireland in 1994 to that in 15 European countries, including Ireland, in 2000. While there were substantial improvements in the use of statins, b-blockers and the availability of rehabilitation programmes since the early 1990s, more patients now smoke, take no exercise and are overweight. The prevalence of non-insulin dependent diabetes has increased by 70%. In comparison with other European countries, we have the highest use of aspirin and the highest prevalence of smoking in women. Despite a considerable improvement in the use of drug therapy we will not achieve the full potential of secondary prevention unless lifestyle factors, including smoking, overweight and exercise receive greater attention by patients with coronary heart disease.", 
    "184": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in Europe. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is among the most common of its manifestations. Women and older patients are under-represented in most trials of treatment for AMI, as are those with significant co-morbidities. These patients also have a worse long term outcome after AMI. We sought to evaluate the management of AMI in a small non-academic general hospital. A review was performed of cases of AMI during 2000. Ninety-two cases were analysed, 69% were male. The mean age was 70 years. In-hospital mortality was 12%; 30-day mortality was 14%. There was no gender or age difference in mortality. Of thirty eligible patients, twenty-eight were thrombolysed (93%). Aspirin (81%) and beta-blocker (41%) prescription on discharge were below published European and American rates. Females were significantly less likely to receive aspirin or beta-blockers on discharge. Those aged 70 years or more were less likely to receive beta-blockers, statins or ACE inhibitors on discharge. Those with co-morbidities were less likely to receive beta-blockers or statins on discharge. This study highlights the difficulty in realising evidence based guidelines optimal management of AMI in clinical practice. While the outcome with regard to mortality is similar to national figures, there is a need to enhance care, with particular emphasis on secondary pharmacological measures prescribed on discharge."
