    "1": "A total of 74 patients (mean age 44.7 +/- 7.1 years) with hyperlipidemia were enrolled into this study. After a cardiac examination, the serum lipid levels were measured, and the 24-hour Holter monitoring, heart rate variability, and autonomic test results were also evaluated. Erectile function was assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire. Later, atorvastatin 40 mg/day was initiated in all patients and used for the subsequent 12 months. All diagnostic tests (cardiac, biochemical, and autonomic and the IIEF questionnaire) were performed again at 6 and 12 months of follow-up.", 
    "2": "A statistically significant decrease was found in the serum lipid levels at 6 months (P <0.05). In contrast, the average IIEF scores (24.7 +/- 6.4 at baseline) had increased to 25.0 +/- 4.9 and 26.1 +/- 5.9 at 6 and 12 months of follow-up, respectively. Although the parasympathetic activities increased and sympathetic activities decreased with atorvastatin treatment, these changes were not statistically significant (P >0.05). In paired comparison, significant differences were found among the IIEF scores of the three periods (P = 0.013). The difference was more evident after 6 months of treatment (IIEF(1vs2) = 0.475; IIEF(1vs3) = 0.027; IIEF(2vs3) = 0.012).", 
    "3": "Although improvement in the lipid profile occurred early during the statin treatment, restoration of erectile function appeared later, which could be attributed to the restoration of endothelial functions by lowered serum lipid levels.", 
    "4": "Analysing the literature data suggests that coronary angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) fails to completely remove the focus of ischaemia, even in case of successful recanalization of the infarction-related artery. Inadequate post-angioplasty reperfusion of the infarction-stunned myocardium is mainly caused by the so-called <no reflow> phenomenon. Primary coronary angioplasty is capable of decreasing the size of the necrosis focus, being however incapable of completely removing myocardial infarction. Such a situation results from death of a considerable number of cardiomyocytes in the area of ischaemia, to have occurred long before coronary reperfusion is restored. An endovascular intervention in AMI may improve the impaired myocardial contractile performance and save the life of the patients sustaining the cardiogenic shock. However, coronary angioplasty does not preclude the development of cardiac insufficiency in all the patients suffering from acute myocardial infarction, which is a consequence of inadequate cardiac reperfusion and a result of necrotic death of a considerable segment of the heart muscle. Currently, there is no evidence regarding the effect of primary angioplasty on the risk of sudden cardiac death following AMI. An endovascular intervention on the infarction-related artery cannot prevent the development of the postmyocardial-infarction cardiac remodelling, which is a consequence of incompletely restored coronary blood flow within the area of infarction.", 
    "5": "Resistin in serum is associated with high risk in patients with atherosclerosis. This clinical study aimed to investigate whether pitavastatin can regulate the serum level of resistin, together with levels of other inflammatory cytokines and adipocytokines.", 
    "6": "Forty two outpatients (mean age 65.2 +/- 12.6 yr, M/F: 21/21) with hypercholesterolemia were administered 2 mg of pitavastatin and serum levels of resistin, together with serum levels of adiponectin, leptin, TNF-alpha and hsCRP, were measured before, and 12 weeks after enrollment.", 
    "7": "There was no significant gender-related difference in initial serum resistin levels. Pitavastatin significantly decreased LDL-cholesterol after 12 weeks. Initial levels of resistin showed a significant correlation with those of hsCRP (r=0.38, p=0.013), but not TNF-alpha or HOMA-R. Serum resistin, but not adiponectin and leptin, levels were significantly decreased, dropping from 17.1 +/- 9.9 ng/ dL to 15.2+/-10.0 (p=0.001) after 12 weeks of administration. The patient group with a baseline hsCRP > or = 0.1 at enrollment (n=17) had decreased levels of both resistin and hsCRP (p=0.011 and p=0.022, respectively).",

    "9": "Vascular calcification is clinically important in the development of cardiovascular disease. It has been suggested that apoptosis is one of the processes regulating calcification in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). In this review, we discuss the role of apoptosis in inorganic phosphate (Pi)- induced calcification, focusing on regulation of the survival pathway mediated by growth arrest- specific gene 6 (Gas6). Further, we mention the beneficial effect of statins mediated by inhibition of apoptosis which is accompanied by restoration of the Gas6-mediated survival pathway. These findings indicate that Gas6 is a novel target of statins' effects to prevent vascular calcification.", 
    "10": "The present study was designed to investigate whether fluvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, would attenuate the acute myocardial infarction in isoproterenol-treated rat model via maintaining activities of endogenous antioxidant enzymes. Hemodynamic and electrocardiograph parameters were monitored and recorded continuously, cardiac marker enzymes and antioxidative parameters of plasma and heart tissues were measured, and histopathological examination of heart tissues was performed. Isoproterenol-treated rats showed lower of left-ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), maximum (LVdP/dtmax) and minimum rate of developed left ventricular pressure (LVdP/dtmin), and higher of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), in addition, a significant rise in ST-segment and increase in content of lactate dehydrogenase, glutamic oxalacetic transaminase, creatine kinase and malondialdehyde, as well as fall in activities of glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase were observed. Oral administration of fluvastatin (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg, respectively) significantly prevented almost all the parameters of isoproterenol-induced heart failure and myocardial injury that mentioned above. The protective role of fluvastatin on isoproterenol-induced myocardial damage was further confirmed by histopathological examination. There was no significant change in heart rate in all experimental groups. Compared with control group, any indexes in sham rats treated with fluvastatin (20 mg/kg) alone were unaltered (all P>0.05). Our results suggest that fluvastatin has a significant effect on the protection of heart against isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction through maintaining endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities.",

    "12": "A systematic literature search through November 6, 2007 was conducted to identify randomized, placebo-controlled trials of statins that reported data on the incidence of new-onset diabetes mellitus. Incidence of new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus was treated as a dichotomous variable. Weighted averages were reported as relative risk (RR) with associated 95% confidence intervals (CI). A random-effects model was used.", 
    "13": "Five prospective, randomized controlled trials (n = 39,791) were identified. Upon meta-analysis, the use of a statin did not significantly alter a patient's risk of developing new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (relative risk, 1.03; 95% confidence interval 0.89-1.19). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses did not significantly change the results. There was statistical heterogeneity that stemmed from pravastatin's tendency towards a reduction in risk and the other statins showing an increase in risk. The funnel plot could not rule out publication bias.",

    "15": "The study evaluated the effect of the traditional Chinese medicine rhubarb on the stability of atherosclerotic plaque. Atherosclerotic lesions were induced in rabbits through balloon injury with a high-cholesterol diet and then were divided into a control group, a rhubarb group and a simvastatin group. At week 24 recombinant-p53 adenoviruses were locally delivered to the atherosclerotic plaques. At week 26 plaque rupture was triggered by the intra-arterial Chinese Russell's viper venom and histamine. Serological, ultrasonographic, pathologic, immunohistochemical and gene expression studies were performed. The results showed that the incidence of plaque rupture in the rhubarb group and the simvastatin group was significantly lower than that in the control group (42.86% and 35.71% versus 80.00%, both p < 0.05). Serum TC, LDL-C (p < 0.05-0.01), IMT (both p < 0.01), PA (both p < 0.01), PB (%) (both p < 0.01) and the mRNA and protein expressions of TLR2, TLR4 and NF-kappaB (p < 0.05, 0.01, respectively) in the rhubarb group and the simvastatin group were significantly lower than those in the control group. In contrast, AIIc% (both p < 0.05) in the two treatment groups were significantly higher than those in the control group. These results suggest that rhubarb has antiatherosclerotic and plaque-stabilizing properties due to antiinflammation and lipid-lowering effects.", 
    "16": "This paper summarizes several important studies published during the previous year that have an impact on the practice of inpatient internal medicine, because they either modify or reinforce current practices. The selected domains include the treatment of thrombo-embolic disease, the role of implantable defibrillators in left cardiac failure, the management of cerebro-vascular disease, of community-acquired pneumonia, and of type 2 diabetes, as well as the prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhosis and of osteoporosis fractures. Some data stimulating our reflection on the integration of medical education in health care centres and on the validity of some scientific publications are also presented.", 
    "17": "The statins have been proposed as possible therapeutic agents for a variety of autoimmune disorders, including multiple sclerosis. In a genomic screen, we found that glial progenitor cells (GPCs) of the adult human white matter expressed significant levels of the principal statin target, HMG-CoA reductase, as well as additional downstream members of the sterol synthesis pathway. We therefore asked if statin treatment might influence the differentiated fate of adult glial progenitor cells. To assess the functional importance of the sterol synthesis pathway to adult human glial progenitors, we used simvastatin or pravastatin to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, and then assessed the phenotypic differentiation of the progenitors, as well as the molecular concomitants thereof. We found that both statins induced a dose-dependent induction of oligodendrocyte phenotype, and concomitant reduction in progenitor number. Oligodendrocyte commitment was associated with induction of the sterol-regulated nuclear co-receptor PPARgamma, and could be blocked by the specific PPARgamma antagonist GW9662. Thus, statins may promote oligodendrocyte lineage commitment by parenchymal glial progenitor cells; this might reduce the available progenitor pool, and hence degrade the long-term regenerative competence of the adult white matter.", 
    "18": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays an important role in the development of diabetic retinopathy. Previous studies have suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy may reduce vitreous VEGF concentration in diabetic retinopathy. Also HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), known for their beneficial effects on vascular endothelium, might influence vitreous VEGF concentration in diabetic retinopathy.", 
    "19": "Vitreous VEGF concentration of diabetic patients with proliferative retinopathy using statin therapy and/or ACE inhibitor therapy was studied.", 
    "20": "Fifty diabetic patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 21 diabetic control patients without proliferative retinopathy, and 43 non-diabetic control subjects underwent vitrectomy. Vitreous samples were collected at the beginning of surgery, and VEGF concentration was assessed using a chemiluminescent VEGF immunoassay.", 
    "21": "Vitreous VEGF concentration was significantly higher in diabetic patients with proliferative retinopathy using statins than in those not using statins. The diabetic patients with proliferative retinopathy were divided into subgroups according to use of ACE inhibitor and/or statin medication. These groups did not differ significantly in concentration of vitreous VEGF.", 
    "22": "Statin therapy is associated with high vitreous VEGF concentration in diabetic patients with proliferative retinopathy. In contrast to previous reports, ACE inhibitor use did not significantly influence vitreous VEGF concentration in these patients.", 
    "23": "To assess the effect of statins on the circulatory levels of neutrophil chemokines, namely, granulocyte chemotactic protein-2 GCP-2, growth regulated oncogene-alpha GRO-alpha and epithelial-cell-derived neutrophil-activating peptide-78 ENA-78 in patients with diabetes.", 
    "24": "We studied 91 diabetic patients 46 were statin-treated and 45 were not and 28 healthy subjects. We measured the levels of GCP-2, GRO-alpha, and ENA-78 in the serum for the 3 groups using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. This cross-sectional study was conducted at King Khalid University Hospital KKUH, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, from January 2006 to July 2007.", 
    "25": "Circulating levels of GCP-2, ENA-78, and not GRO-alpha, were significantly higher in diabetic patients as compared to healthy subjects p<0.05. Statins dropped the levels of both GCP-2 and GRO-a. The ENA-78 levels were not affected by statin therapy. There was no correlation between the levels of these chemokines with the body mass index and glycemia in the population studied.", 
    "26": "Diabetes is associated with an elevation of GCP-2 and ENA-78, and not GRO-alpha. Statins have a significant role in reducing the level of GCP-2.", 
    "27": "Recent studies suggest that dipyridamole (DP) may exert stroke protective effects beyond platelet inhibition. The purpose of this study is to determine whether statin and DP could enhance stroke protection through nitric oxide (NO)-dependent vascular effects. Mice were pretreated with DP (10 to 60 mg/kg, q 12 h, 3 days) alone or in combination with a statin (simvastatin; 0.1 to 20 mg/kg per day, 14 days) before transient intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion. Although simvastatin (1 mg/kg per day, 14 days) increased endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activity by 25% and DP (30 mg/kg, q12 h, 3 days) increased aortic cGMP levels by 55%, neither statin nor DP alone, at these subtherapeutic doses, increased absolute cerebral blood flow (CBF) or conferred stroke protection. However, the combination of subtherapeutic doses of simvastatin and DP increased CBF by 50%, decreased stroke volume by 54%, and improved neurologic motor deficits, all of which were absent in eNOS-deficient mice. In contrast, treatment with aspirin (10 mg/kg per day, 3 days) did not augment the neuroprotective effects of DP and/or simvastatin. These findings indicate that statin and DP exert additive NO-dependent vascular effects and suggest that the combination of statin and DP has greater benefits in stroke protection than statin alone through vascular protection.", 
    "28": "The development of delayed ischemia caused by cerebral vasospasm remains a common cause of morbidity and mortality after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Preliminary studies suggest that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) may decrease the risk of vasospasm, but additional study is required.", 
    "29": "Beginning in May 2006, our treatment protocol for patients presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage was altered to routinely include the use of 80 mg of simvastatin per day for 14 days. Before this time, only patients with other indications for statins were treated. The charts of 203 consecutive patients over a period of 27 months were retrospectively reviewed, and 150 patients were included in the analysis, of whom 71 patients received statins. These patients were compared with 79 untreated patients to determine whether or not the use of statins was associated with a reduction in the occurrence of vasospasm, delayed infarction, or poor outcome (death, vegetative state, or severe disability).", 
    "30": "Patients who were treated with statins and those who were not had similar baseline characteristics, although more patients in the former group were managed with endovascular coil embolization. There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of patients developing at least moderate radiographic vasospasm (41% with statins versus 42% without, P = 0.91), symptomatic vasospasm (32% with statins versus 25% without, P = 0.34), delayed infarction (23% with statins versus 28% without, P = 0.46), or poor outcome (39% with statins versus 35% without, P = 0.61). After adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics, including the method of aneurysm treatment, statins were still not significantly protective.", 
    "31": "The addition of statins to standard care was not associated with any reduction in the development of vasospasm or improvement in outcomes after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. If there is a benefit to statin use, it may be smaller than suggested by previous studies. However, further randomized controlled trials are awaited.", 
    "32": "We examine the potential chemopreventive role statins may have in prostate cancer, highlight the basic science supporting this role and analyze the human data regarding the association between statin use and prostate cancer.", 
    "33": "Basic scientific evidence suggests that, through cholesterol and noncholesterol-mediated mechanisms, statins inhibit many pathways of cancer formation and progression. A handful of observational studies found statin use was associated with reduced prostate cancer risk, though others found no association. In the last year, however, four large prospective studies have observed similar reductions in the risk of advanced prostate cancer with essentially no reduction in the risk of overall prostate cancer. This may, in part, explain why previous studies, including large metaanalyses of clinical trials of statins in the prevention of cardiovascular outcomes, did not observe any association between statin use and overall prostate cancer risk.", 
    "34": "The exact association between statin medication use and prostate cancer, and whether this association is causal in nature, remains unclear. Recent evidence, however, is encouraging, particularly for reducing the risk of advanced disease. Thus, while at present there are insufficient data to recommend all men start taking a statin medication regardless of their cholesterol profile, the rationale to move forward with further research is clear.", 
    "35": "Statins are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors broadly used for the control of hypercholesterolemia. Recently, they are reported to have beneficial effects on certain cancers. In this study, we show that statins inhibited the histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity and increased the accumulation of acetylated histone-H3 and the expression of p21(WAF/CIP) in human cancer cells. Computational modeling showed the direct interaction of the carboxylic acid moiety of statins with the catalytic site of HDAC2. In the subsequent enzymatic assay, it was shown that lovastatin inhibited HDAC2 activity competitively with a K(i) value of 31.6 micromol/L. Sp1 but not p53 sites were found to be the statins-responsive element shown by p21 luciferase-promoter assays. DNA affinity protein binding assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed the dissociation of HDAC1/2 and association of CBP, leading to the histone-H3 acetylation on the Sp1 sites of p21 promoter. In vitro cell proliferation and in vivo tumor growth were both inhibited by statins. These results suggest a novel mechanism for statins through abrogation of the HDAC activity and promoter histone-H3 acetylation to regulate p21 expression. Therefore, statins might serve as novel HDAC inhibitors for cancer therapy and chemoprevention.", 
    "36": "Evidence suggesting a beneficial effect of cardioprotective medications in patients with lower extremity atherosclerosis derives largely from secondary prevention studies of heterogeneous populations. Patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) have a large atherosclerotic burden with related high mortality. The effect of such therapies in this population is largely inferred and unproven.", 
    "37": "The Project of Ex-Vivo vein graft Engineering via Transfection III (PREVENT III) cohort comprised 1404 patients with CLI who underwent lower extremity bypass grafting in a multicenter, randomized prospective trial testing the efficacy of edifoligide for the prevention of graft failure. Propensity scores were used to evaluate the influence of statins, beta-blockers, and antiplatelet agents on outcomes while adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, medications, and surgical variables that may influence drug use. Primary outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular events < or =30 days, vein graft patency, and 1-year survival assessed by Kaplan-Meier method. Potential determinants of 1-year survival were modeled using a multivariate Cox regression.", 
    "38": "In this cohort, 636 patients (45%) were taking statins, 835 (59%) were taking beta-blockers, and 1121 (80%) were taking antiplatelet drugs. Perioperative major adverse cardiovascular events (7.8%) and early mortality (2.7%) were not measurably affected by the use of any drug class. Statin use was associated with a significant survival advantage at 1 year of 86% vs 81% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52-0.98; P = .03) by analysis of both unweighted and propensity score-weighted data. Use of beta-blockers and antiplatelet drugs had no appreciable impact on survival. None of the drug classes were associated with graft patency measures at 1 year. Significant predictors of 1-year mortality by Cox regression modeling were statin use (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51-0.90; P = .001), age >75 (HR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.60-2.82; P = .001), coronary artery disease (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.15-2.01; P = .001), chronic kidney disease stages 4 (HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.17-3.55; P = .001) and 5 (HR, 3.4; 95% CI, 2.39-4.73; P < .001), and tissue loss (HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.23-2.80; P = .003).", 
    "39": "Statin use is associated with improved survival in CLI patients 1 year after surgical revascularization. Further studies are indicated to determine optimal dosing in this population and to definitively address the question of relationship to graft patency.

    "40": "Niacin (nicotinic acid), the most effective available pharmacotherapy for increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, also lowers triglycerides and hence may be useful, alone or in combination with hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), to offset residual cardiovascular risk in patients with mixed or diabetic dyslipidemia. We conducted a review of published consensus guidelines since 2000 and an English-language PubMed search of prospective, randomized controlled trials and open-label studies from January 1, 1990, through December 31, 2007, concerning the effects of niacin, alone or in combination with statins, on glycemic regulation in dyslipidemic patients (with or without diabetes mellitus). For search terms, we used the title words niacin or nicotinic acid and key words including diabetes, diabetic, dyslipidemia, glucose, glycemic, HbA1c, hemoglobin, hyperglycemia, human, insulin, postprandial, and safety. Retrospective and observational studies, case reports, and case studies were excluded. On the basis of our analysis, the effects of niacin (< or =2.5 g/d), alone or in combination with statins, on fasting glucose (an increase of 4%-5%) and hemoglobin A1c levels (an increase of < or =0.3%) are modest, transient or reversible, and typically amenable to adjustments in oral hypoglycemic regimens without discontinuing niacin. Niacin therapy was infrequently associated with incident diabetes or the need for new insulin prescriptions. Studies showed important clinical benefits of niacin or niacin-statin regimens despite modest effects on glucose control. On a population basis, significant reductions in incidences of cardiovascular events and the degree of atherosclerotic progression associated with long-term niacin (or niacin-statin) therapy in patients with diabetic dyslipidemia outweigh the typically mild effects of this therapy on glycemic regulation. Consensus guidelines recommend monitoring glycemic control after initiating niacin treatment or increasing its dosage.",

    "42": "Orthodontic tooth movement of upper first molar was performed in 32 rats with coil spring for 21 days. The 32 rats were randomly allocated into 4 groups: negative control group (isotonic saline) and three experimental groups (2.5 mg x kg(-1), 5.0 mg x kg(-1) and 10.0 mg x kg(-1)). The simvastatin started to be administered to the experimental groups 1 day before appliances were removed, and once a day there after for 4 weeks. The negative control group received the isotonic saline only. The interdental distance between the first and second maxillary molars were measured, when appliances were removed, and 1 week and 4 weeks after that. After the rats were sacrificed, sections of first maxillary molar and periodontal tissue were studied by immunohistochemistry.", 
    "43": "The number and percentage of relapse was lower in the three experimental groups than in the negative control group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). The lower dose was given, the less relapse there was, with the lowerest dose resulting in lowest percentage of relapse (26.81% and 53.38%). BMP-2 expression in experimental groups was higher than in the negative control group, with the lowerest dose group showing the highest expression (P < 0.001). The BMP-2 expression on the tension side was slightly stronger than that on the compression side (P > 0.05).", 
    "44": "Systemic administration of simvastatin could decrease the extent of relapse of the orthodontic-moved tooth in rat, and the lower-dose of simvastatin seemed more effective. The possible mechanism for this may be that simvastatin functions by increasing the expression of BMP-2 in the periodontal tissue, accelerating the osteoblast activity and promoting bone formation.",

    "46": "A probabilistic Markov model was constructed to analyze the costs and consequences of lifetime treatment with rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin. For this purpose, the results from randomized head-to-head trials evaluating low-density lipoprotein (LDL) changes were combined with the results from a meta-analysis defining the relationship between LDL levels and fatal and nonfatal IHD events. The incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) was derived from a 9-year Portuguese observational study. The eligible population was defined as untreated individuals aged more than 35 years with LDL levels above 115 mg/dl. Death rates due to IHD and other causes were obtained from official data. Resource use in the treatment of MI was estimated by a Delphi panel of eight Portuguese cardiologists with at least 15 years of clinical practice. Costs were calculated from the payers' perspective.", 
    "47": "Rosuvastatin increases life expectancy between 5.5 and 12.1 days per patient. It is cost-saving when compared to atorvastatin, but it increases costs when assessed against pravastatin and simvastatin (euro1,004 and euro684 per patient, respectively). Therefore, rosuvastatin is a dominant alternative compared to atorvastatin, having an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro30,350 to pravastatin and euro39,340 to simvastatin. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, performed rosuvastatin always dominates atorvastatin and is associated with a cost per life-year gained inferior to euro50,000 in 95.7% of the cases when compared to pravastatin and in 67.0% simulations when assessed against simvastatin.",

    "49": "A recently discussed cardiovascular risk factor, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), is known to act as an endogenous inhibitor of endothelial nitric oxide synthase. The aim of this study was to establish 1) the relationship between ADMA and ultrasonographically or biochemically determined endothelial dysfunction in children, and 2) the effect of folate supplementation on these parameters. The study cohort included 32 children with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), 30 with diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1) and 30 age-matched healthy children as the control group. Furthermore, twenty-eight randomly selected FH and DM1 children were re-examined after 3-months supplementation with folic acid. Baseline levels of ADMA and oxidized low density lipoproteins (oxLDL) were significantly higher in FH group than in DM1 and healthy children. Children in DM1 group had significantly lower concentration of homocysteine, but ADMA levels were normal. Folic acid supplementation significantly lowered homocysteine and hsCRP levels in both FH and DM1 group; however, ADMA and oxLDL concentrations remained unaltered. In conclusion, ADMA and oxLDL appear to be associated with endothelial dysfunction in children with FH. Administration of folic acid did not influence these markers in both FH and DM1 children.", 
    "50": "Approximately 95% of statin-treated patients tolerate this form of cholesterol management without any adverse effects. However, given their efficacy in reducing low density lipoproteins and cardiovascular events large numbers of patients are selected for statin therapy. Therefore muscle complications are, in fact, quite common. Limited understanding of the underlying pathophysiology has hampered physicians' ability to identify patients at risk for developing statin myotoxicity. A growing number of published case reports/series have implicated statins in the exacerbation of both acquired and genetic myopathies. A clinical management algorithm is presented which outlines a variety of co-morbidities which can potentiate the adverse effects of statins on muscle. In addition, a rational approach to the selection of those patients most likely to benefit from skeletal muscle biopsy is discussed. Ongoing work will define the extent to which statin-intolerant patients represent carriers of recessive metabolic myopathies or pre-symptomatic acquired myopathies. The expanding importance of pharmacogenomics will undoubtedly be realized in the field of statin myopathy research within the next few years. Such critical information is needed to establish more definitive management and diagnostic strategies.", 
    "51": "The ability of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to modify prostate carcinoma viability in vitro and in vivo when combined with the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin and ionizing radiation was investigated. Treatment of PC-3 cells in vitro with hCG caused a modest increase in numbers of non-viable cells within 96 h. Treatment of cells with hCG followed by exposure to the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin suppressed AKT phosphorylation and enhanced the cytotoxic effects of hCG. The cytotoxic effects of hCG were blocked by expression of BCL-(XL) and dominant negative caspase 9. Treatment of mice bearing PC-3 flank tumors with lovastatin and hCG significantly reduced tumor volume within 7 days; this was also reflected in decreased ex vivo colony survival of the cells which correlated with increased cleavage of pro-caspase 3 and reduced Ki67 immuno-reactivity. In vitro, treatment of PC-3 cells with hCG followed by exposure to ionizing radiation enhanced the cytotoxic effects of hCG, that was further enhanced by lovastatin. In vivo, hCG radiosensitized PC-3 tumors and significantly enhanced the lethality of hCG and lovastatin treatment. Collectively, our findings argue that treatment of PC-3 prostate cancer tumors with hCG, lovastatin and radiation represents a potential novel therapeutic approach.", 
    "52": "Previous studies using quantitative coronary angiography have demonstrated that statin therapy slows the progression of coronary stenoses in proportion to average low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels during therapy. However, no major statin monotherapy study has demonstrated either halted progression or regression of angiographic disease. A Study to Evaluate the Effect of Rosuvastatin on Intravascular Ultrasound-Derived Coronary Atheroma Burden (ASTEROID) assessed whether rosuvastatin could regress coronary atherosclerosis by intravascular ultrasound and quantitative coronary angiography. Intravascular ultrasound showed atheroma volume regression in a single coronary artery with <50% angiographic luminal narrowing.", 
    "53": "ASTEROID treated 507 coronary disease patients with rosuvastatin 40 mg/d for 24 months. Blinded quantitative coronary angiography analyses of percent diameter stenosis and minimum lumen diameter were performed for up to 10 segments of coronary arteries and major branches with >25% diameter stenosis at baseline. For each patient, the mean of all matched lesions at baseline and study end was calculated. There were 292 patients with 613 matched stenoses. Rosuvastatin reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 53.3% to 61.1+/-20.3 mg/dL and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 13.8% to 48.3+/-12.4 mg/dL. Mean+/-SD percent diameter stenosis decreased from 37.3+/-8.4% (median, 35.7%; range, 26% to 73%) to 36.0+/-10.1% (median, 34.5%; range, 8% to 74%; P<0.001). Minimum lumen diameter increased from 1.65+/-0.36 mm (median, 1.62 mm; range, 0.56 to 2.65 mm) to 1.68+/-0.38 mm (median, 1.67 mm; range, 0.76 to 2.77 mm; P<0.001).", 
    "54": "Rosuvastatin treatment for 24 months to average low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels well below 70 mg/dL, accompanied by significant increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, produced regression by decreasing percent diameter stenosis and improving minimum lumen diameter as measured by quantitative coronary angiography in coronary disease patients.", 
    "55": "Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (statins) reduce signs of diabetic retinopathy in diabetic patients and animals. Indirect clinical evidence supports the actions of statins in improving cardiovascular function, but the mechanisms of their protective actions in the retina are not understood. Prior studies have implicated oxidative stress and NADPH oxidase-mediated activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in diabetes-induced increases in expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB). Because statins are known to be potent antioxidants, the hypothesis for the current study was that the protective effects of statins in preventing diabetic retinopathy involve blockade of diabetes-induced activation of NADPH oxidase and STAT3.", 
    "56": "The hypothesis was tested by experiments in which rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes and retinal endothelial cells maintained in high-glucose medium were treated with simvastatin. Blood-retinal barrier (BRB) function was assayed by determining extravasation of albumin. Oxidative stress was assayed by measuring lipid peroxidation, protein nitration of tyrosine, dihydroethidine oxidation, and chemiluminescence. Immunoprobe techniques were used to determine the levels of NADPH oxidase subunit expression and STAT3 activation.", 
    "57": "These studies showed that simvastatin blocks diabetes or high-glucose-induced increases in VEGF and ICAM-1 and preserves the BRB by a process involving blockade of diabetes/high-glucose-induced activation of STAT3 and NADPH oxidase. Statin treatment also prevents diabetes-induced increases in expression of the NADPH oxidase catalytic and subunit NOX2.", 
    "58": "These results suggest that simvastatin protects against the early signs of diabetic retinopathy by preventing NADPH oxidase-mediated activation of STAT3.", 
    "59": "Stabilization of carotid artery plaques by pharmacologic intervention is a promising strategy for the prevention of ischemic stroke. In this study, we examined the effect of 12 months of statin therapy on carotid plaque echogenicity. This study included 81 hypercholesterolemic patients with carotid atherosclerotic plaques. Echogenicity of the largest plaque in each patient was evaluated by ultrasound with integrated backscatter analysis. All patients underwent dietary modification. Forty patients were treated with simvastatin (10 mg/day, n = 24) or atorvastatin (5 mg/day, n = 16) according to the choice by each attending physician. Carotid plaques were monitored by measuring plaque thickness and echogenicity during a 12-month follow-up period. Levels of serum high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-18 were determined in all patients. Total cholesterol, triglyceride, hs-CRP and IL-18 were significantly decreased after 12 months of statin therapy. The change in IL-6 level was not significant. Significant increases in echogenicity of carotid plaques and decreases in plaque thickness were noted after statin therapy. In the 41 patients without statin therapy, carotid plaque echogenicity, plaque thickness and serum levels of inflammatory markers were not significantly altered. Our results suggest that statin therapy in hypercholesterolemic patients for 12 months increases carotid plaque echogenicity and decreases plaque thickness, in addition to lowering serum levels of lipids and inflammatory markers.", 
    "60": "Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) is overexpressed in atherosclerotic plaques by unknown mechanisms. We have examined here the putative mechanism(s) responsible for this overexpression in the atherosclerotic lesion and its potential modulation by simvastatin, both in vitro and in vivo.", 
    "61": "Atherosclerosis was induced in rabbits by femoral endothelial dessication and atherogenic diet. After 2 weeks, animals were randomized to receive either 5mg/(kgd) simvastatin (n=7) or no treatment (n=6) during 4 additional weeks. An increase in PTHrP immunostaining was observed in atherosclerotic lesions of hyperlipidemic rabbits, which was significantly reduced by simvastatin. However, PTH/PTHrP type 1 receptor staining was similar in both groups. In cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), atherogenic concentrations of native LDL (0.125-0.5mg/mL) increased PTHrP expression. This effect was prevented by preincubation with simvastatin (1micromol/L) and was reversed by mevalonate, geranylgeranylpyrophosphate and, to a lesser extent, by farnesylpyrophosphate. Moreover, in transfection studies, we showed that RhoA appears to participate in the mechanism whereby LDL induces PTHrP in VSMC. Finally, native LDL-induced VSMC growth and this mitogenic effect was blocked by PTHrP silencing.", 
    "62": "LDL might be responsible for PTHrP overexpression in atherosclerotic plaques of hyperlipidemic rabbits. The inhibition of this effect by simvastatin provides further insights into the mechanisms of action of statins.", 
    "63": "Plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) has received considerable attention as a potential therapeutic target to further reduce cardiovascular events in the statin era. One therapeutic approach to enhance HDL-mediated atheroprotection involves the use of small, synthetic and orally-active compounds that substantially raise plasma HDL-C levels. However, doubts on the clinical benefit achievable with such treatments have been raised by the premature termination of a large Phase III trial with torcetrapib, the most potent and furthest developed HDL-C raising compound, because of excess mortality in patients receiving the drug. The alternative is the direct administration of synthetic HDL (sHDL), discoidal lipoprotein particles which mimic most, if not all, of the atheroprotective properties of plasma HDL. Short-term treatments with sHDL of different composition caused consistent and remarkable reductions of atheroma volume in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Although at early stages of drug development, sHDL hold vast promise for plaque stabilization/regression, and cardiovascular event reduction.", 
    "64": "Recently, immobilized artificial membranes (IAMs) have been introduced as HPLC column packing materials. IAMs consist of phosphatidylcholine residues, the most common phospholipids in natural membranes, covalently bound to silica propylamine and consequently mimic fluid phospholipid bilayer. Thus, the immobilized artificial membrane provided a biophysical model system to study the passive diffusion of the statin molecules through the cellular membrane. Statins or 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA R) inhibitors are widely used for reducing the circulating atherogenic lipid fractions and decreasing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This paper describes magnesium cation (Mg(2+)) effect on five statin molecules (pravastatin, mevastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin and fluvastatin)-IAM surface association using a molecular chromatography approach. An analysis of the thermodynamics (i.e. enthalpy (DeltaH degrees ), entropy (DeltaS degrees *)) of the interaction of the statin molecules with the immobilized monolayer was also carried out. The DeltaH degrees and DeltaS degrees * values were negative due to van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonding between the statin molecules with the polar head groups of phospholipid monolayer (polar retention effect). However, the increase of statin-IAM association, with the Mg(2+) concentration increase, was associated with an increase of these thermodynamic data. This explains that this interaction was also governed by hydrophobic and electrostatic bonds which became preponderant. The statin elution order was: Pravastatin<Mevastatin<Atorvastatin<Simvastatin<Fluvastatin. This result confirmed that pravastatin, which exhibited the lowest association with the lipid monolayer, was taken up by a membrane transporter. It appeared equally that Mg(2+) supplementation (Mg(2+) concentration range 0.0-2.6 mmol L(-1), including its biological concentration range, i.e. 0.75-0.90 mmol L(-1)) could increase the statin passive diffusion into hepatocytes and their pharmacological actions on cholesterol biosynthesis.", 
    "65": "Ferumoxtran-10 is an ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle potentially useful as a contrast material in magnetic resonance imaging for the diagnosis of inflammatory and degenerative disorders associated with high macrophage activity. In clinical trials, it is currently applied to monitor the effect of atorvastatin therapy on macrophage activity in human carotid plaques. A recent study reported the inhibition of iron oxide nanoparticle uptake in macrophages by lovastatin, an effect which could compromise the suitability of Ferumoxtran-10 as an MRI contrast material in patients on statin therapy. Therefore, we examined the effect of atorvastatin on human monocyte-macrophage uptake of Ferumoxtran-10 in vitro using biochemical assays, magnetic resonance imaging and transmission electron microscopy. Our study showed that non-toxic concentrations of atorvastatin did not affect the amount of Ferumoxtran-10 taken up by HMMs. Furthermore, the intracellular distribution of iron oxide nanoparticles and the resulting MRI signal intensities remained unchanged by statin treatment. These results were obtained using atorvastatin concentrations probably vastly exceeding those reached in patient plasma in vivo. Atorvastatin therapy itself is therefore unlikely to affect Ferumoxtran-10 based macrophage detection by MRI, a prerequisite for the use of this contrast material to monitor lesion macrophage burden during lipid-lowering therapy.", 
    "66": "The role of long chain omega-3 fatty acids (LC n-3 FAs) as cardioprotective agents has become even clearer with the recent publication of the Japan EPA Lipid Intervention Study. This was the largest randomized controlled trial in the field, and it demonstrated that even in a population with one of the highest LC n-3 FA intakes in the world, the addition of eicosapentaenoic acid could reduce cardiac events. A comprehensive analysis of the risks and benefits of fish consumption was likewise recently published that should quiet any remaining fears that there are substantial risks to consuming oily fish such as salmon. A new meta-analysis has now demonstrated that reduced tissue/blood levels of LC n-3 FAs provide a better indication of increased cardiovascular risk than the n-6:n-3 ratio. Finally, a supplementation study in cardiac surgery patients has demonstrated both the time course and extent of incorporation of LC n-3 FAs into the human heart.",

    "70": "It seems likely that independent preclinical testing would have shown that torcetrapib increased blood pressure. Such a finding might have halted the development of torcetrapib prior to clinical trial. Although the early clinical testing of torcetrapib showed favourable effects on the surrogate endpoints, an ability to increase blood pressure started to become apparent. When clinical outcome studies were undertaken with torcetrapib, it was shown not to have any benefit on atherosclerosis and to increase cardiovascular events. These finding might have come to light earlier if clinical outcomes studies had had a higher priority than repeated trials, in different populations, of torcetrapib on surrogate outcomes.",

Ten of 13 (77%) group 1 patients had reduced AST levels after initiation of statin therapy.

There were no significant adverse events reported.", 
    "76": "Use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in patients with elevated AST resulted in normalization of AST levels. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were safe in patients with mildly elevated AST.

    "77": "Inflammation has been indicated to play a major role in the development of atherosclerosis. The beneficial effect of statins has been suggested to be related to their anti-inflammatory properties. We have studied plasma levels of soluble adhesion molecules in patients with hypercholesterolemia before and after 3 months of treatment with atorvastatin and evaluated possible relations to the mutations in low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene. In patients with no LDLR gene polymorphism (group A), lower baseline levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were found than in patients with LDLR gene polymorphism (group B). The soluble adhesion molecules sICAM-1, sE-selectin and sP-selectin, but not sVCAM-1 and sL-selectin, were higher in group B than in group A. sICAM-1 levels decreased in group A by 7% (p = 0.007) and in group B by 21% (p = 0.039), whereas levels of sVCAM-1 decreased in group A by 12% (p = 0.001) and in group B patients by 19% (p = 0.039). Atorvastatin did not change sE-selectin nor sP-selectin levels in group A. However, in group B, the treatment reduced E-selectin and sP-selectin levels by 39% (p = 0.007) and 24% (p = 0.007), respectively. Atorvastatin attenuates the inflammatory reaction in hypercholesterolemic patients, but in patients with LDLR gene polymorphism, this effect is more profound.",

    "82": "Statins are widely used as medication to lower cholesterol levels in human patients. In addition, it was recently reported that they also reduce the incidence of stroke and progression of Alzheimer's disease when prophylactically administered. To date there is only limited information available on how statins exert this beneficial effect. In this study we investigated the neuroprotective effect of lovastatin in primary cortical neurons. We found that lovastatin protects cortical neurons in a concentration-dependent manner against glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity. Interestingly, lovastatin with or without glutamate and/or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) increased TNF receptor 2 (TNF-R2) expression in cortical neurons. It was previously shown that activation of TNF-R2 signaling, which includes phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt and activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB), protects neurons against ischemic or excitotoxic insults. To investigate if lovastatin-induced neuroprotection was mediated by TNF-R2 signaling, primary cortical neurons were isolated from TNF-R1(-/-) or TNF-R2(-/-) mice. We could show that lovastatin is neuroprotective in TNF-R1(-/-) neurons, while protection is completely absent in TNF-R2(-/-) neurons. Furthermore, lovastatin-mediated neuroprotection led to an increase in PKB/Akt and NF-kappaB phosphorylation, whereas inhibition of PKB/Akt activation entirely abolished lovastatin-induced neuroprotection. Thus, lovastatin-induced neuroprotection against glutamate-excitotoxicity via activation of TNF-R2-signaling pathways.",

No correlation was found between the change in the leukocyte count and any of the changes in the lipid levels; changes in either of these are known to be associated with the rate of progression of atherosclerosis. A multivariate regression analysis using other traditional risk factors and medications as covariates revealed that the decrease in the leukocyte count was an independent predictor of inhibition of the progression of coronary atherosclerosis. In conclusion, a reduction of the leukocyte count as one of the non-lipid-lowering effects of pravastatin may be a novel marker of regression of coronary atherosclerosis.",

In this work, adiponectin plasma levels were measured in 102 statin-free subjects from the Spanish population of the Achieve Cholesterol Targets Fast with Atorvastatin Stratified Titration (ACTFAST) study, a 12-week, prospective, multi-centre, open-label trial which enrolled subjects with coronary heart disease, coronary heart disease-equivalent or a 10-year coronary heart disease risk >20%. Subjects were assigned to atorvastatin (10-80 mg/day) based on low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol concentration at screening. For comparison, age and gender-matched blood donors (N=40) were used as controls. Control subjects did not present hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and history of cardiovascular diseases. Adiponectin levels were diminished in patients at high cardiovascular risk compared with control subjects [4166 (3661-4740) vs 5806 (4764-7075) ng/ml respectively; geometric mean (95% CI); P<0.0001]. In the whole population, atorvastatin treatment increased adiponectin levels [9.7 (3.2-16.7);% Change (95% CI); P=0.003]. This increment was in a dose-dependent manner; maximal effect observed with atorvastatin 80 mg/d [24.7 (5.7-47.1); P=0.01]. Adiponectin concentrations were positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol both before and after atorvastatin treatment. No association was observed between adiponectin and LDL-cholesterol before and after atorvastatin treatment. In conclusion, atorvastatin increased adiponectin plasma levels in subjects at high cardiovascular risk, revealing a novel anti-inflammatory effect of this drug.",

The 2004 update to the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines have recommended lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals in high-risk patients. Based on the new targets for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, clinicians will need more efficacious lipid-lowering therapies and improved options for combination therapy.

We have previously demonstrated that individuals, especially those with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, may produce antibodies to CRP. This study was therefore undertaken to determine the possible association between anti-CRP antibodies and atherosclerosis. A total of 103 individuals were identified with or without atherosclerosis, and without clinical rheumatic diseases. They were evaluated with respect to cholesterol, HDL, LDL, high-sensitivity (hs)CRP, and anti-CRP antibody levels, as well as use of statin medications. Individuals with atherosclerosis were much more likely to be taking a statin, and thus have lower lipid levels. However, there was no association between hsCRP or anti-CRP antibody levels with atherosclerosis, statin use, or each other. These observations suggest that anti-CRP antibody is not involved in atherosclerosis, and may represent an epiphenomenon.",

The potential role of antiphospholipid antibodies in the development of atheroma is rather controversial. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that antiphospholipid antibodies could induce atherosclerosis via vascular functional changes. CD1 mice received one single injection of antiphospholipid monoclonal antibodies derived from male (BXSB x NZW) F1 mice with a lupus-like disease associated with an antiphospholipid syndrome and coronary artery disease. One week later, first-order mesenteric arteries (diameter 220-260 microm) were isolated and mounted on a small-vessel myograph for the measurement of the relaxation responses to acetylcholine or the NO donor nitroprusside after precontraction by phenylephrine. Five out of eight antiphospholipid monoclonal antibodies reduced the response to acetylcholine compared with control mice, and this effect was especially marked with one of them. No change in the response to nitroprusside was observed. The impairment was maintained after 3 weeks of treatment and appeared related to a moderate decrease in NO-mediated responses and a marked decrease in prostanoid-mediated relaxations. These vascular functional changes could be prevented by chronic treatment with statins or aspirin. These data could constitute additional elements supporting a direct pathogenic role of antiphospholipid antibodies. We suggest that a sub-population of these autoantibodies could be responsible for the endothelial dysfunction observed in antiphospholipid syndrome.",

Conversely, regular exercise contributes to the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, improves wellness, attenuates age-related decline and reduces risk of premature death. However, it is widely believed that lifestyle interventions are difficult to institute and difficult to maintain and drugs, particularly statins, should be considered as the fundamental tool in the prevention of coronary artery disease. It is therefore a concern that statins may adversely affect the muscle's ability to appropriately respond to physical exertion. Statin therapy can induce skeletal muscle damage in treated patients, despite their being asymptomatic and without increment of serum creatine kinase level. In clinical practice, muscle complaints due to statin therapy are easily dismissed by the patient and physician. Such muscle effects are likely related to mitochondrial dysfunction and may well affect 25% of statin users who exercise and thus constitute one of the most common and underappreciated side effects of statins. Physical activity is affordable to all, as opposed to statins, and should be regarded as one of the most cost-effective ways to prevent cardiovascular disease. Physicians should be aware that statins may interfere with patient's activity levels.",

Statins have recently been suggested to induce anticancer effects against a variety of cancers in several, but not all, in vitro, in vivo, and epidemiologic studies. In the accompanying article by Ogunwobi and Beales, three statins were shown to inhibit proliferation and stimulate apoptosis in two EAC cell lines. These effects were achieved by reducing Ras, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and protein kinase B (Akt)-related cellular signaling. Although these results are promising, they are clearly preliminary, and much additional work is needed to confirm or refute the potential anticancer effects of statins in human BEAC. In addition, the work of Ogunwobi and Beales highlights the importance of developing better, more predictive in vitro and in vivo models of BEAC, and of taking promising, low-risk agents, such as statins, into early-phase therapeutic and preventive clinical trials involving cancer patients and patients with Barrett's metaplasia/dysplasia, respectively.",

Nondiabetic patients with CVD, diabetic patients without CVD, and subjects with the metabolic syndrome form the next three risk categories. The presence of insulin resistance-related metabolic abnormalities is a common denominator in this risk pyramid. Insulin resistance is a core defect in type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. Because insulin resistance may cause the atherogenic dyslipidemia that is commonly associated with these conditions, therapeutic strategies that combat insulin resistance could substantially reduce cardiovascular risk. Evidence suggests that defects in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (which may be inherited, age related, or lifestyle acquired) may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Reduced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation can be partially reversed by improved diet, increased exercise, and administration of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha agonists (omega-3 fatty acids and fibrates). Statin therapy has demonstrated clinical benefits in insulin-resistant patients but residual cardiovascular risk remains elevated. Fibrates also improve the lipid profile and reduce cardiovascular risk in a variety of insulin-resistant populations. Affected individuals should be targeted for therapeutic lifestyle intervention. Patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia who have developed insulin resistance, the metabolic syndrome, or type 2 diabetes should receive more intensive interventions including, where appropriate, statin-fibrate combination therapy, to comprehensively modify the lipid profile together with aggressive control of blood pressure and glucose to minimize risk in this very high-risk population.",

Among 700 strains obtained from culture collections, one strain could convert lovastatin to a novel statin, wuxistatin. The strain was identified as a member of the genus Amycolatopsis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence, morphology analysis, and chemotaxonomic properties. Wuxistatin, a novel HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, was purified by chromatography, and the structure was determined by electrospray ionization mass and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

Nf contains a Ras-GTPase-activating protein domain, which directly regulates Ras signaling. Numerous clinical manifestations are associated with the loss of Nf and increased Ras activity. Ras proteins must be prenylated to traffic and functionally localize with target membranes. Hence, Ras is a potential therapeutic target for treating NF1. We have tested the efficacy of two novel farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs), 1 and 2, alone or in combination with lovastatin, on two NF1 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cell lines, NF90-8 and ST88-14. Single treatments of 1, 2, or lovastatin had no effect on Ras prenylation or MPNST cell proliferation. However, low micromolar combinations of 1 or 2 with lovastatin (FTI/lovastatin) reduced Ras prenylation in both MPNST cell lines. Furthermore, this FTI/lovastatin combination treatment reduced cell proliferation and induced an apoptotic response as shown by morphological analysis, procaspase-3/-7 activation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and accumulation of cells with sub-G(1) DNA content. Little to no detectable toxicity was observed in normal rat Schwann cells following FTI/lovastatin combination treatment. These data support the hypothesis that combination FTI plus lovastatin therapy may be a potential treatment for NF1 MPNSTs.",

    "171": "Prostate cancer mortality rates in the U.S.A. increased in the late 1980s and declined from 1993 until 2003. The purpose of this study is to compare declining prostate cancer mortality rates among states with independent variables that may have an association to explore causes for the decline.", 
    "172": "Annual rates of prostate cancer mortality for men over 50 were obtained from the National Vital Statistic System public use data file for states for individual years from 1993 to 2003. The annual rate of prostate cancer mortality decline for each state was calculated by the Joinpoint Regression Program (Statistical Research and Applications Branch of NCI). Annual rates of prostate cancer decline were cross-correlated to state levels of PSA screening, health insurance coverage, obesity, physical inactivity, diabetes, and high cholesterol for males from 45 to 64.", 
    "173": "Declining prostate cancer mortality rates for white males correlated with high cholesterol levels (R = -0.42, P = 0.002) and PSA screening levels (R = -0.28, P = 0.05). Declining prostate cancer mortality rates for black males correlated with health insurance coverage (R = -0.43, P = 0.03).", 
    "174": "Declining prostate cancer mortality rates are weakly associated with increased PSA screening for white males but there was no association for black males, possibly because blacks have less access to medical care. The strong inverse correlation between declining prostate cancer mortality rates and levels of white males with high cholesterol levels was unexpected but may be associated with the widespread use of cholesterol reducing medications (statins), which are hypothesized to reduce prostate cancer risk.", 
    "175": "Many different classes of medications can cause toxic myopathy. One of the most frequently implicated classes is the statins. Statin myotoxicity ranges from asymptomatic creatine kinase elevations or myalgias to muscle necrosis and fatal rhabdomyolysis. Statins may also cause an autoimmune myopathy requiring immunosuppressive treatment. The mechanisms of statin myotoxicity are unclear. If unrecognized in its early manifestations, complications from continued statin therapy may lead to rhabdomyolysis and death. Risk factors for myotoxicity include concomitant medication use and medical conditions, and the patient's underlying genetic constitution. We review these considerations along with the recommended evaluation and treatment for patients presenting with statin myotoxicity.", 
    "176": "Diabetes is a highly prevalent disease in the United States and is increasing in both incidence and prevalence. Atherosclerotic vascular disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance and frequently co-exists with a variety of cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, and physical inactivity. Hygienic measures such as weight loss and exercise should form the basis of therapeutic interventions in the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes. The role of dyslipidemia as a causal factor in vascular disease associated with diabetes was previously downplayed because total cholesterol was frequently normal or minimally elevated. However, diabetic dyslipidemia is characterized by elevated triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein, and small, dense low-density lipoprotein, the combination of which has been termed the \"lipid triad.\" The role of lipid modification as a means to decrease cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes has recently been clarified by a number of clinical trials. Subgroup analysis in early studies implied the potential for benefit of lipid modification in diabetes. The results of these early studies prompted the design of large-scale intervention trials that employed statin and fibric acid derivatives in diabetes patients. The preponderance of data from the statin trials implicates significant clinical benefit in cardiovascular risk reduction. The fibric acid derivatives have theoretic advantages in diabetic dyslipidemia. However, the robust bulk of clinical data obtained from prospective statin studies is lacking for the fibric acid derivatives, and the results of the major trials are equivocal.", 
    "177": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the developed world. Lower risks of morbidity and mortality in trials of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) have changed the conventional wisdom regarding lipid lowering. Since 2001, there have been surprising results concerning the early benefits of statin therapy, which suggest that some benefits may be derived from effects other than those of simply improving dyslipidemias. The earlier than expected CVD benefits from statin trials have led to the theory that statins have effects other than, or concomitant to, the benefits on serum lipid levels, and that these effects may be at least partly responsible for their early and often significant reduction in CVD risk. These have been defined as pleiotropic effects. Possible means by which statins reduce CVD risk independent of their lipid regulation may include antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory effects, antioxidation, plaque stabilization, and endothelial wall relaxation resulting in lower intra-arterial pressure and increased blood flow.", 
    "178": "Metabolic syndrome, which affects approximately 25% of the adults in the United States, consists of a constellation of inter-related metabolic risk factors associated with promoting the risk for development of cardiovascular disease. Multiple definitions, which include insulin resistance, abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and inflammation, have been proposed. Lifestyle change is the cornerstone of therapy for metabolic syndrome, although additive pharmacotherapy is often necessary in many patients. This review examines the potential for statin therapy to benefit individuals with dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome in both primary and secondary prevention settings.", 
    "179": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains a major cause of death in the United States, and despite continued improvements in cardiovascular care, CHD rates remain unacceptably high. Modification of cardiovascular risk factors is the major strategy for reducing coronary disease and clinical events. Lipid modification therapy has played an important role in cardiovascular risk reduction, and the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are among the most important cardioprotective medications. Early clinical trials of statin therapy utilized low or modest doses of statins. More recent trials, however, have compared low-dose with high-dose statin therapy in individuals with CHD and found high-dose statin therapy to confer more benefits. Is there, then, still a role for low-dose statin therapy? This article summarizes statin clinical trials and focuses on the potential role for low-dose statin therapy in cardiovascular risk reduction.", 
    "180": "Statins effectively lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, and because of this they have become a standard treatment for dyslipidemia and atheroprevention. Unfortunately, statin monotherapy may fail to normalize high triglycerides and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and it prevents only a minority of CVD events. Further treatment of lipid disorders that remain after statin monotherapy should help reduce the residual CVD risk. Fibrate monotherapy lowers high triglyceride levels, raises low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and reduces CVD risk; therefore, fibrates are recommended as an adjunct to statins for treatment of residual dyslipidemia and residual CVD risk. This review provides an update on the benefits and risks of fibrate monotherapy and addresses the benefits and risks of adding fibrates to statins.", 
    "181": "Despite landmark trials demonstrating the benefits of statin therapy for lipid lowering and in the primary and secondary prevention of acute coronary events, many patients do not adhere to medication regimens. Although incremental gains have been made in lowering the absolute levels of total serum cholesterol in the general population, only one third of treated patients are achieving their lipid goals, with fewer than 20% of patients with cardiovascular disease at their target lipid goals. Only half of patients continue taking statins prescribed to them at 6 months, and only 30% to 40% continue taking them at 1 year. Predictors of poor adherence to statins are described, such as female gender and low socioeconomic status. Approaches that are physician focused and patient centered, such as frequent follow-up and serum lipid testing and better education of patients about cardiovascular disease, are suggested to offset a major impediment to achieving the full therapeutic outcomes promised by clinical trials.", 
    "182": "Overwhelming evidence now shows that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (ie, statins) are safe and effective in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Atherosclerosis, the primary cause of heart disease, is directly and independently related to hypercholesterolemia and inflammation, and statins have multiple and independent effects on these conditions. New evidence for the use of statins in neurologic disease is mounting, and the range of therapeutic applications is formidable. Statins are beginning to show benefits in a wide range of neurologic conditions, from common ischemic stroke to rare congenital neurometabolic storage diseases, from acute brain injury to chronic central nervous system inflammation, and from prevention of neurodegenerative disease to acute neuroprotection. A diverse therapeutic spectrum is explained by shared pathogenetic mechanisms of neurologic disease and the manifold pharmacodynamic effects of statins.", 
    "183": "There is evidence that dyslipidemia is associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Experimental studies have established that lipids are damaging to the kidney and animal intervention studies show statins attenuate this damage. Small clinical trials, meta-analyses, observational studies and post-hoc analyses of cardiovascular intervention studies all support the concept that statins can reduce kidney damage in humans. Based on this background, a double blind randomized placebo controlled trial was designed to assess the effectiveness of atorvastatin 10 mg on slowing the progression of kidney disease in a population of patients with CKD.",

High priority should be given to research aimed at the study of pharmacological and natural compounds that could potentially prevent the development of breast cancer in susceptible patients. Tamoxifen has been shown to reduce the incidence of estrogen receptor-positive invasive breast cancer in women with a high risk of developing this condition by nearly 50%, and studies in osteoporosis have revealed a similar protective effect of raloxifene in postmenopausal women. The aromatase inhibitors are superior to tamoxifen in reducing the recurrence of breast cancer in postmenopausal women; large clinical trials are currently evaluating the chemopreventive effect of these agents. The list of agents with the potential for chemoprevention in breast cancer is extensive and continues to expand. There is an immense need to develop drugs that will decrease the incidence of estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer in women at high risk of developing the disease. Herein, we review the most important chemopreventive agents in breast cancer and clinical trials that have evaluated their efficacy.", 
    "188": "Rituximab is used in the treatment of CD20+ B cell lymphomas and other B cell lymphoproliferative disorders. Its clinical efficacy might be further improved by combinations with other drugs such as statins that inhibit cholesterol synthesis and show promising antilymphoma effects. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of statins on rituximab-induced killing of B cell lymphomas.", 
    "189": "Complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) was assessed by MTT and Alamar blue assays as well as trypan blue staining, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) was assessed by a 51Cr release assay. Statins were found to significantly decrease rituximab-mediated CDC and ADCC of B cell lymphoma cells. Incubation of B cell lymphoma cells with statins decreased CD20 immunostaining in flow cytometry studies but did not affect total cellular levels of CD20 as measured with RT-PCR and Western blotting. Similar effects are exerted by other cholesterol-depleting agents (methyl-beta-cyclodextrin and berberine), but not filipin III, indicating that the presence of plasma membrane cholesterol and not lipid rafts is required for rituximab-mediated CDC. Immunofluorescence microscopy using double staining with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against a conformational epitope and a linear cytoplasmic epitope revealed that CD20 is present in the plasma membrane in comparable amounts in control and statin-treated cells. Atomic force microscopy and limited proteolysis indicated that statins, through cholesterol depletion, induce conformational changes in CD20 that result in impaired binding of anti-CD20 mAb. An in vivo reduction of cholesterol induced by short-term treatment of five patients with hypercholesterolemia with atorvastatin resulted in reduced anti-CD20 binding to freshly isolated B cells.", 
    "190": "Statins were shown to interfere with both detection of CD20 and antilymphoma activity of rituximab. These studies have significant clinical implications, as impaired binding of mAbs to conformational epitopes of CD20 elicited by statins could delay diagnosis, postpone effective treatment, or impair anti-lymphoma activity of rituximab.",

    "192": "A retrospective cohort study was performed using data from a large integrated health plan in Northern California, USA. Patients with laboratory or clinical evidence of liver disease were identified and their exposure to lovastatin was determined. The primary outcome was a pattern of liver-test abnormalities associated with a poor prognosis among patients with drug-induced liver disease, based on Hy's Rule. Secondary outcomes included liver injury (defined as moderate or severe, depending on the degree of ALT level elevations) or the development of either clinical cirrhosis or liver failure. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated and multivariate analyses conducted using extended Cox models.", 
    "193": "A total of 93 106 patients met the entry criteria. Lovastatin exposure was associated with a lower incidence of all endpoints, including the primary outcome (IRR = 0.28, 95% CI 0.12, 0.55), moderate liver injury (IRR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.47, 0.65), severe liver injury (IRR = 0.50, 95% CI 0.29, 0.81) and the occurrence of either cirrhosis or liver failure (IRR = 0.29, 95% CI 0.21, 0.38); adjustment for age and sex resulted in some attenuation of this reduction in incidence. The observed effects were generally consistent across a range of baseline liver-disease diagnoses and greater cumulative lovastatin exposure was associated with fewer outcome events for some endpoints.",

    "195": "Vascular endothelial cell activation by cytokines and other pro-inflammatory mediators is an initial event in atherosclerosis and in other vascular diseases. Simvastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, suppressed both tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha- and angiotensin (Ang) II-induced monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells (an initial step in vascular inflammation) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Diphenyleneiodonium and apocynin, both NADPH oxidase inhibitors, also suppressed TNF-alpha-induced ROS and monocyte-endothelial cell adhesion, demonstrating that TNF-alpha-induced monocyte adhesion is mediated through ROS produced by NADPH oxidase activation. Furthermore, exogenously applied mevalonate or geranylgeranylpyrophosphate in combination with simvastatin completely prevented the inhibitory effects of simvastatin on ROS generation and monocyte-endothelial cell adhesion by TNFalpha and Ang II. These results suggest that monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells induced by TNF-alpha or Ang II is mediated via the geranylgeranyl isoprenoid-dependent generation of ROS, and that this is inhibited by simvastatin.", 
    "196": "Lovastatin is one of a series of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors used in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. It may also inhibit atheroma formation by inhibiting the oxidation of low density lipoproteins (LDLs). We investigated the antioxidant properties of lovastatin and its effect on phagocyte-induced genotoxicity in mammalian cells. In a cytochrome c reduction assay using 106 phorbol ester-induced phagocytes as a positive control, lovastatin (10 microM) in its naturally occurring lactone form, had no effect. When converted to its acid form, however, superoxide anion formation was inhibted by 36%. Similarly, lovastatin in its acid form completely inhibited H2O2 formation by stimulated phagocytes. Using the fluorometric analysis of DNA unwinding, single-strand breakage was assayed in MRC-5 lung cells exposed to 106 human phagocytes +/- lovastatin (10 microM, 5 min. incubation). Stimulated phagocytes induced a decrease in double-stranded DNA to 48% of control values which, in the presence of lovastatin, reverted to 91% of control values. Lovastatin acts as an antioxidant by decreasing oxygen radical production by human phagocytes and may be important in abrogating the carcinogenic effect of chronic inflammation.", 
    "197": "Effects of the GABA-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin and the ACE inhibitor captopril on the induction and growth of mammary gland tumors induced by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea in Wistar rats have been studied. It is established that lovastatin administered in a doze of 80 mg/kg two times a week exhibits anticarcinogenic activity, which is manifested by a significant decrease in the incidence of neoplasms and an increase in the survival lifetime in the experimental animals. Captopril administered in a doze of 50 mg/kg two times a week significantly decreased the tumor growth rate. The chemopreventive activity of these drugs can be due to their possible regulatory influence on the processes of cell proliferation, differentiation, neoangiogenesis, and apoptosis. The results of this investigation show good prospects for the further investigation of lovastatin and captopril as chemotherapeutic agents for the prophylaxis of mammary tumor.", 
    "198": "Rho guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) orchestrate signaling pathways leading to cell migration. They are typically responsible for the organization of actin filaments that support actomyosin contractility and cell-body translocation. The function of Rho GTPases depends on GTP-loading and isoprenylation by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGpp). The latter posttranslational modification may be manipulated by agents such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (HMGCRIs) that prevent de novo synthesis of isoprenoids such as GGpp. HMGCRIs have anti-inflammatory properties and substantially reduce infiltration of inflammatory immune cells into target tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS) during neuroinflammation. The depletion of the cellular isoprenoid pool is believed to result in the regulation of antigen-specific T cells outside the target organ and also to prevent migration of these cells into target organs, such as the CNS. In vivo treatment with HMGCRI in the experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) rodent model of multiple sclerosis reduces the capacity of activated T cells to traffic to and within the brain. This presentation shows that geranylgeranylation is fundamental for RhoA-mediated downstream events such as influencing cytoskeletal organization and the migration of T cells. Tethering of RhoA to the membrane by GGpp is necessary for T cell migration and provides a mechanism by which HMGCRI may prevent T cell infiltration into inflamed compartments.",

    "200": "Patients with hypercholesterolemia receiving rosuvastatin 10 mg/d in this hospital were prospectively followed and retrospectively analyzed. Men and women with primary hypercholesterolemia were eligible for inclusion in the study if they were either lipid-lowering therapy (LTT)-naive or had been receiving starting doses of other LLT that had proved ineffective in reaching goals. The primary measurement was the percentage of change in LDL-C from baseline at 12 weeks. Other measurements included: percentages of change from baseline in total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglyceride (TG), TC/HDL ratio, percentage of patients reaching therapeutic goals, and any adverse effects at 12 weeks. Both intention-to-treat analysis and on-treatment analysis were used.", 
    "201": "A total of 447 patients, including 375 LTT-naive and 72 switched patients were enrolled. In LLT-naive patients, rosuvastatin 10 mg/d reduced LDL-C by a mean of 48.9% from baseline (p < 0.0001) by the on-treatment analysis and by a mean of 44.2% from baseline (p < 0.0001) by the intention-to-treat analysis. In switched patients, LDL-C was reduced by a mean of 26.2% from baseline (p < 0.0001) by both analyses. TC, TG, and TC/HDL ratio, but not HDL-C, were also significantly reduced. Overall, more than 75% patients reached their therapeutic goals. The safety profiles were excellent. Only 2.2% of patients complained of myalgia, 0.2% had elevation of creatine kinase > 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN), and 0.6% had an elevation of ALT > 3 x ULN. All the abnormal laboratory tests returned to pretreatment values after drug discontinuation. Only 2.7% of patients discontinued medication due to adverse effects.",

This study was conducted to investigate the cardioprotective effects of simvastatin on reversing electrical remodeling in left ventricular myocytes of rabbit heart undergoing ischemia-reperfusion, so as to explore the ionic mechanism responsible for the anti-arrhythmic effect of statin.", 
    "204": "Forty-five rabbits were randomly divided into three groups: ischemic-reperfusion group (I-R), simvastatin intervention group (Statin) and sham-operated control group (CON). Anesthetized rabbits were subjected to 30-minute ischemia by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery and a 60-minute reperfusion after a 3-day administration of oral simvastatin of 5 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) in the Statin group or a placebo in the I-R group. Single ventricular myocytes were isolated enzymatically from the epicardial zone of the infracted region derived from the hearts in the I-R and Statin group and the same anatomical region in the CON animals. The whole cell patch-clamp technique was used to record membrane ionic currents, including sodium current (I(Na)), L-type calcium current (I(Ca-L)) and transient outward potassium current (I(to)). Simultaneously, the level of serum cholesterol was examined.", 
    "205": "There was no significant difference in the serum cholesterol concentration among the three groups. The peak I(Na) current density (at -30 mV) was significantly decreased in I-R ((-22.46+/-5.32) pA/pF, n=12) compared with CON ((-42.78+/-5.48) pA/pF, n=16, P<0.01) and Statin ((-40.66+/-5.89) pA/pF, n=15, P<0.01), while the peak I(Na) current density in the Statin group was not different from CON (P>0.05). The peak I(Ca-L) current density (at 0 mV) was significantly increased in I-R ((-4.34+/-0.92) pA/pF, n=15) compared with CON ((-3.13+/-1.22) pA/pF, n=13, P<0.05) and Statin ((-3.46+/-0.85) pA/pF, n=16, P<0.05), while the Peak I(Ca-L) current density in Statin was not different from CON (P>0.05). The I(to) current density (at +60 mV) was significantly decreased in I-R ((9.49+/-1.91) pA/pF, n=11) compared with CON ((17.41+/-3.13) pA/pF, n=15, P<0.01) and Statin ((14.54+/-2.41) pA/pF, n=11, P<0.01), although there was a slight reduction in the Statin group compared with CON (P<0.05).", 
    "206": "It is implied that ischemia-reperfusion induces significant down-regulation of I(Na) and I(to) and up-regulation of I(Ca-L), which may underlie the altered electrical activity and long abnormal transmembrane action potential duration of the surviving ventricular myocytes, thus contributing to ventricular arrhythmias during acute ischemia-reperfusion period. Pretreatment with simvastatin could attenuate these changes and reverse this electrical remodeling without lowering the serum cholesterol level, contributing to the ionic mechanism of statin in treatment of arrhythmia independent of a decrease in cholesterol.", 
    "207": "Transplant CAV is the leading cause of graft loss beyond one yr post-heart transplant. Diagnosis can be challenging and the previous \"gold standard,\" coronary ANG, tends to underestimate disease. The purpose of this study was to relate DSE to ANG for the diagnosis of CAV. Prospective annual DSE at a single centre on all heart transplant patients (1999-2006) were compared with results from routine coronary angiograms. Progression of CAV over time as determined by DSE and ANG and associated factors were sought through logistic regression models adjusted for repeated measures. There were 102 heart transplant patients (54 males) transplanted between 1989 and 2006. Median age at transplant was 17 months (0-16.6 yr). The initial DSE was at a median of 10-months post-transplantation. There was a high correlation between an abnormal DSE and an abnormality on ANG (p = 0.002). There was an increased probability of an abnormal DSE with increasing grade of CAV as assessed by ANG (p < 0.001). Factors associated with an abnormal DSE included older age at transplant (p = 0.04), higher grade of rejection (p = 0.002), higher total cholesterol (p = 0.04), higher LDL (p < 0.05), and older age at the time of DSE (p = 0.002). DSE result was not related to HDL, triglyceride or homocysteine levels, or to steroid or statin use. The probability of an abnormal DSE result increases with increasing angiographic grade of CAV, and thus DSE may be used for initial screening for CAV with ANG reserved for confirmation and grading. Patients transplanted at an older age and those with a greater history of rejection were at higher risk of a positive DSE and may require increased surveillance for CAV.",

Several case reports have associated this condition to the use of statins. However, to our knowledge, no case of rosuvastatin-induced gynecomastia has been reported in the literature. We describe a 57-year-old man who developed bilateral gynecomastia after 2 months of rosuvastatin therapy. After switching to a different statin, atorvastatin, his symptoms resolved within 1 month. Use of the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated a possible relationship between the patient's development of gynecomastia and rosuvastatin therapy. The relatively strong effect of rosuvastatin on inhibiting steroidogenesis might have explained why our patient's gynecomastia occurred only with this agent. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of adverse endocrine reactions when statins are prescribed, including newer agents such as rosuvastatin."
