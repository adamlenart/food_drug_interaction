This new approach uses the \"Delivery Gap Theory\" on any active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) to test if it could enhance transdermal drug delivery. The aim of the study was to formulate six different semi-solid formulations (three creams and three emulgels) with 2% pravastatin as the API in order to investigate the \"Delivery Gap Principle\", by determining which formulation would deliver pravastatin best to the target-site (system circulation). The three cream- and three emulgel formulations had different polarities, i.e. a formulation with polarity equal to that of the stratum corneum (optimised), a non-polar (lipophilic)- and a polar (hydrophilic)-formulation. Franz cell diffusion studies were executed over 12h and the optimised emulgel (2.578\u03bcg/cm(2)) had the highest median amount per area obtained. Tape stripping followed the diffusion studies and in the stratum corneum-epidermis, the hydrophilic emulgel (1.448\u03bcg/ml) contained the highest median pravastatin concentration and the epidermis-dermis the optimised emulgel (0.849\u03bcg/ml) depicted the highest pravastatin concentration. During this study, it was observed that when both emulgel and cream formulations were compared; the emulgels enhanced the delivery of pravastatin more than the creams.", 
    "1": "Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) plays an important role in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis. By binding to hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors and promoting their lysosomal degradation, PCSK9 reduces LDL uptake, leading to an increase in LDL cholesterol concentrations. Gain-of-function mutations in PCSK9 associated with high LDL cholesterol and premature cardiovascular disease have been causally implicated in the pathophysiology of autosomal-dominant familial hypercholesterolemia. In contrast, the more commonly expressed loss-of-function mutations in PCSK9 are associated with reduced LDL cholesterol and cardiovascular disease risk. The development of therapeutic approaches that inhibit PCSK9 function has therefore attracted considerable attention from clinicians and the pharmaceutical industry for the management of hypercholesterolemia and its associated cardiovascular disease risk. This review summarizes the effects of PCSK9 on hepatic and intestinal lipid metabolism and the more recently explored functions of PCSK9 in extrahepatic tissues. Therapeutic approaches that prevent interaction of PCSK9 with hepatic LDL receptors (monoclonal antibodies, mimetic peptides), inhibit PCSK9 synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (antisense oligonucleotides, siRNAs), and interfere with PCSK9 function (small molecules) are also described. Finally, clinical trials testing the safety and efficacy of monoclonal antibodies to PCSK9 are reviewed. These have shown dose-dependent decreases in LDL cholesterol (44%-65%), apolipoprotein B (48%-59%), and lipoprotein(a) (27%-50%) without major adverse effects in various high-risk patient categories, including those with statin intolerance. Initial reports from 2 of these trials have indicated the expected reduction in cardiovascular events. Hence, inhibition of PCSK9 holds considerable promise as a therapeutic option for decreasing cardiovascular disease risk.",

The mevalonate pathway is thought to be a potential oncogenic pathway in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer. Simvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) inhibitor, is a widely used drug for inhibiting the synthesis of cholesterol and may also have anti-tumorigenic activity. Our goal was to evaluate the effects of simvastatin on ovarian cancer cell lines, primary cultures of ovarian cancer cells and in an orthotopic ovarian cancer mouse model. Simvastatin significantly inhibited cellular proliferation, induced cell cycle G1 arrest and apoptosis, and caused cellular stress via reduction in the enzymatic activity of HMGCR and inhibition of the MAPK and mTOR pathways in ovarian cancer cells. Furthermore, simvastatin induced DNA damage and reduced cell adhesion and invasion. Simvastatin also exerted anti-proliferative effects on primary cell cultures of ovarian cancer. Treatment with simvastatin in an orthotopic mouse model reduced ovarian tumor growth, coincident with decreased Ki-67, HMGCR, phosphorylated-Akt and phosphorylated-p42/44 protein expression. Our findings demonstrate that simvastatin may have therapeutic benefit for ovarian cancer treatment and be worthy of further exploration in clinical trials.", 
    "3": "This study deciphered the molecular mechanisms of the inhibition of MMP-9 expression using rosuvastatin in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and apoE knockout mice and whether the combination of rosuvastatin and probucol enhanced this effect. The role that microRNA (miR)-497 plays in the regulation of MMP-9 expression was evaluated in cultured HUVECs and apoE knockout mice using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. First, TNF\u03b1 significantly increased mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) signaling and MMP-9 levels, and the transfection of miR-497 prevented this increase. The converse results were obtained after miR-497 suppression. Second, the administration of rosuvastatin or the combination of two drugs decreased MAPK/ERK signaling and MMP-9 levels, and the suppression of miR-497 upregulated these levels. Third, the administration of rosuvastatin or the combination of two drugs increased miR-497 expression levels in the aortas of apoE knockout mice, but the levels of serum lipids and plaque areas decreased, which improved plaque components and decreased the MAPK/ERK signaling and MMP-9 levels. Finally, the combination of the two drugs was more effective than the use of rosuvastatin alone. Rosuvastatin inhibits MMP-9 expression by upregulating miR-497 in HUVECs and apoE knockout mice, and the combination of rosuvastatin and probucol enhances this effect.", 
    "4": "Therapeutic voriconazole concentrations have a narrow window of effectiveness before causing cholestatic hepatitis. After undergoing 1 year of voriconazole therapy for pulmonary aspergillosis, a 44-year-old man began treatment with 30 mg lansoprazole for gastroesophageal reflux symptoms. Within 5 days of starting treatment with lansoprazole, the patient presented with fatigue, jaundice, and cholestatic hepatitis. The hepatitis promptly resolved after stopping lansoprazole treatment. Sixteen months later, the patient was given simvastatin therapy, as recommended by the American Diabetes Association to prevent cardiovascular disease for patients with diabetes who are aged >40 years and have one additional risk factor. Within 2 weeks of taking simvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (statin) therapy, the patient redeveloped fatigue, jaundice, and cholestatic hepatitis. He described both episodes of fatigue and jaundice similarly in terms of onset and intensity. Voriconazole is metabolized by both CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes. Lansoprazole is an inhibitor of the CYP2C19 isoenzyme. Competition between voriconazole and lansoprazole likely led to increased voriconazole serum concentration and acute cholestatic hepatitis in this patient. Simvastatin inhibits the CYP3A4 isoenzyme. After the patient took 10 mg simvastatin daily for 2 weeks, cholestatic hepatitis occurred. The voriconazole concentration remained elevated (4.1 \u03bcg/ml) when measured 15 days after stopping simvastatin. The patient's Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale score of 7 revealed that the cholestatic hepatitis was probably precipitated by lansoprazole. Likewise, the patient's Naranjo score of 9 also revealed that cholestatic hepatitis was attributable to a definite adverse drug reaction precipitated by the addition of simvastatin to the stable baseline regimen of voriconazole. In a single patient, two different inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 pathway stimulated voriconazole-induced cholestatic hepatitis. Although the major cytochrome P450 pathways for the metabolism and clearance of lansoprazole and simvastatin are different, they both likely contributed to the reduced hepatic clearance of voriconazole in this patient.", 
    "5": "We studied the effect of rosuvastatin on the development of early postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in patients after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). One hundred nine men aged 45-70 year was divided into two groups. Group 1 comprised 69 patients (mean age 56.8 \u00b1 5.2 years) who were given 20 mg of rosuvastatin for 10-14 days before CABG and until discharge. Patients of group 2 (n=40, mean age 55.9 \u00b1 5.3 years) did not take rosuvastatin. It was shown that patients of group 2 had better neuropsychological parameters after CABG in comparison with the patients of group 2. Patients of group 1 had lower concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, high sensitivity C reactive protein, and higher concentrations of IL-10. Group 2 patients had worse neuropsychological parameters which were associated with higher concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines. These results may indicate that preoperative therapy with rosuvastatin had decreased the severity of systemic inflammatory response and reduced the development of early POCD after CABG.",

Thus, alternative agents with suitable mode of delivery are needed to promote fracture healing. This study was performed to investigate the effects of direct deliveries of lovastatin and tocotrienol to fracture sites on ossification-related gene expression in fracture healing in a postmenopausal osteoporosis model. Forty-eight Sprague Dawley female rats were divided into six groups. Group I comprised the sham-operated rats, while Groups II-VI were ovariectomized rats. After 8 weeks, the right tibiae of all rats were fractured and stabilized. Group I and Group II were given two single injections of lovastatin and tocotrienol carriers. Group III was given an estrogen preparation at 64.5 \u00b5g/kg daily via oral gavages. Group IV was injected with lovastatin particles (750 \u00b5g/kg), while Group V was injected with tocotrienol particles (60 mg/kg). Group VI received two single injections of 750 \u00b5g/kg lovastatin particles and 60 mg/kg tocotrienol particles. After 4 weeks, the gene expressions were measured. Group VI showed significantly higher gene expressions of osteocalcin, BMP-2, VEGF-\u03b1, and RUNX-2 compared to Group II. In conclusion, combined treatment of lovastatin and tocotrienol upregulated the expression of genes related to fracture healing.",

    "30": "Endothelial dysfunction and injury are central events in the pathogenesis of ischemic vascular disorders. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are mobilized from the bone marrow into the peripheral circulation, where they locate to sites of injured endothelium and are involved in endothelial repair and vascular regeneration. During these processes, EPCs are exposed to oxidative stress, a crucial pathological condition, which occurs during vascular injury and limits the efficacy of EPCs in the repair of injured endothelium. Statins are effective inhibitors of 3\u2011hydroxy\u20113\u2011methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, and are commonly used to manage and prevent ischemic vascular disease by reducing plasma cholesterol levels. In addition to lowering cholesterol, statins have also been reported to exert pleiotropic actions, including anti\u2011inflammatory and anti\u2011oxidative activities. The present study aimed to investigate the ability of atorvastatin to protect endothelial colony\u2011forming cells (ECFCs), a homogeneous subtype of EPCs, from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)\u2011induced oxidative damage, and to determine the mechanism underlying this protective action. MTT assay, acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining, reactive oxygen species assay, western blot analysis and tube formation assay were employed. The results demonstrated that H2O2 induced cell death and decreased the tube\u2011forming ability of the ECFCs, in a concentration\u2011dependent manner; however, these effects were partially attenuated following administration of atorvastatin. The reversion of the quantitative and qualitative impairment of the H2O2\u2011treated ECFCs appeared to be mediated by the regulation of annexin\u00a0A2, as the expression levels of annexin A2 were decreased following treatment with H2O2 and increased following treatment with atorvastatin. These results indicated that annexin\u00a0A2 may be involved in the H2O2\u2011induced damage of ECFCs, and in the protective activities of atorvastatin in response to oxidative stress.",

Among patients not taking the full complement of recommended CVD preventive therapies, use of a polypill-based strategy (i.e. initiating treatment with single-pill combination medication then titrating further therapy as needed) has large potential benefits in reducing global morbidity and mortality. Despite this, few polypills are available on the market due to market failure in the funding of research and development for affordable non-communicable disease medicines.

    "32": "Most hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients worldwide do not receive curative treatments. Alternative treatments for most HCC patients include palliative treatments, such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Although statins may be a chemopreventive treatment option for reducing hepatitis B virus (HBV)- and hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related HCC risks, their therapeutic effects are unknown. This study evaluated the effects of statin on HCC patients receiving palliative treatment.Data from the National Health Insurance claims database and cancer registry databases of The Collaboration Center of Health Information Application, Taiwan, were analyzed. We included HCC patients who were treated between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2010, and followed them from the index date to December 31, 2012. The inclusion criteria were presence of HBV carrier-related HCC, age >20 years, and having received TACE, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy as palliative treatment. The exclusion criteria were cancer diagnosis before HCC was confirmed, surgery, liver transplantation, radiofrequency ablation, or percutaneous ethanol injection as curative treatment, missing sex-related information, HCC diagnosis before HBV, and age <20 years. We enrolled 20,200 HCC patients.The median follow-up duration was 1.66 years (interquartile range, 0.81). In total, 1988 and 18,212 patients received palliative treatment with and without statin use, respectively. HCC patients who received palliative treatment with statin use had lower HCC-specific deaths in all stages than those who received palliative treatment without statin use (P = 0.0001, 0.0002, 0.0012, and 0.0002, and relative risk (RR) = 0.763, 0.775, 0.839, and 0.718, for stages I-IV, respectively). In all-cause and HCC-specific deaths, decreasing trends (P for trend <0.0001) of adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were observed in all stages with no treatment, statin use only, palliative treatment only, and palliative treatment plus statin use. The aHRs of all-cause and HCC-specific deaths increased with the progress in cancer stage and reduced with the use of advanced therapeutic modalities (P for trend <0.0001). Differences in HBV- and non-HBV-related HCC were solely due to statin use. Statin use alone reduced HCC-specific deaths by 36% in non-HBV-related HCC in stage I and 50% in HBV-related HCC in stages II and III. With a relatively substantial reduction in mortality, the therapeutic effects of statin use were stronger in HBV-related HCC than in non-HBV-related HCC.Palliative treatments are critical for HCC patients. Multiple therapeutic methods with statin use reduced the mortality risk. Statins prolong the survival of patients with advanced HCC receiving palliative treatment, thus demonstrating its therapeutic value as an adjuvant treatment. Furthermore, statin-based palliative treatment in early stage HCC remarkably reduced the number of deaths. For patients who cannot tolerate palliative treatments, statin use only might possibly reduce mortality, particularly in HBV-related early stage HCC patients (>50% reduction in HCC deaths).",

Multiple strategies targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibition have emerged as effective modalities for LDL-C lowering. PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies are the farthest along in clinical development and alirocumab and evolocumab were approved for clinical use by regulatory agencies in 2015. In addition to robust LDL-C lowering (nearly 50-65% from baseline), they improve other lipid parameters as well. Adverse events associated with these medications are minimal.

    "60": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 5-10% of women of childbearing age and manifests itself through oligomenorrhea, anovulation, hirsutism, micro-polycystic ovaries. Insulin resistance is a characteristic of PCOS patients and is more pronounced in obese patients. Insulin resistance and consequent hyperinsulinemia are related to many aspects of the syndrome such as hyperandrogenism, reproductive disorders, acne and hirsutism. In the long-term it may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and negatively affect lipid profile and blood pressure. Changes in lifestyle and diet can partially improve these aspects. The use of insulin-sensitizing drugs such as metformin often normalises the menstrual cycle, improving hyperandrogenism and, subsequently, the response to ovulation induction therapies. New molecules have recently been marketed, that produce the same results, but without the side-effects. One of these is myo-inositol, a new insulin-sensitizing molecule which has been successfully administered to women suffering from PCOS. Associations between inositol and other compounds that can increase the therapeutic effect have been proposed. Of these, we found to be interesting the association with monacolin K, a natural statin that reduces cholesterol levels starting point of the synthesis of steroids, including androgens, and lipoic acid, known for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and insulin-sensitizing activity. We decided to assess the efficacy of the product.",

Rapid revascularization is essential for reducing hypoxic damage after grafting and protecting the primordial follicles reserve. Using a mouse model of heterotopic ovarian graft transplantation, we have delineated the role of endothelial Akt1 expression using longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging follow-up to quantify angiogenic response. Endothelial Akt1 activation in ovarian grafts promoted angiogenesis to support the graft during posttransplantation hypoxic period. Similarly, simvastatin therapy activated Akt1 at the transplantation site and improved the revascularization and vascular support of ovarian grafts. These results serve as an important first step toward pharmacological intervention to improve revascularization of ovarian grafts and restoration of fertility in cancer survivors. The pro-angiogenic effects reported here may extend beyond improving ovarian graft reception in fertility preservation and could potentially be used for different organ or tissue transplantation.",

Previous studies suggest that adding other non-statin LDL-lowering agents may further lower LDL-C without negative side effects. Recent guidelines support the hypothesis that driving the LDL-C level below previously recommended targets may have a beneficial effect. Ezetimibe, a cholesterol absorption blocker that inhibits the Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) receptor, has been the focus of recent trials that support its use in cardiovascular risk reduction. For patients not at goal on statin therapy alone, ezetimibe has proven to be a safe, well-tolerated medication that may be used as an adjunct to statin therapy to further reduce LDL-C, resulting in a significant mortality benefit.",

Statins reduce the circulating levels of liver-derived miR-122. Antiplatelet medication attenuates the release of platelet-derived miRNAs. Heparin inhibits the polymerase chain reactions, in particular the amplification of the exogenous Caenorhabditis elegans spike-in control, thereby resulting in an artefactual rise of endogenous miRNAs. As these limitations have not been previously recognised, a reevaluation of the current miRNA literature, in particular of case-control studies in patients with cardiovascular disease or coronary interventions, is required.", 
    "72": "Muscle problems and other adverse symptoms associated with statin use are frequent reasons for non-adherence and discontinuation of statin therapy, which results in inadequate control of hyperlipidemia and increased cardiovascular risk. However, most patients who experience adverse symptoms during statin use are able to tolerate at least some degree of statin therapy. Given the profound cardiovascular benefits derived from statins, an adequate practical approach to statin intolerance is, therefore, of great clinical importance. Statin intolerance can be defined as the occurrence of myalgia or other adverse symptoms that are attributed to statin therapy and that lead to its discontinuation. In reality, these symptoms are actually unrelated to statin use in many patients, especially in those with atypical presentations following long periods of treatment. Thus, the first step in approaching patients with adverse symptoms during the course of statin therapy is identification of those patients for whom true statin intolerance is unlikely, since most of these patients would probably be capable of tolerating adequate statin therapy. In patients with statin intolerance, an altered dosing regimen of very low doses of statins should be attempted and, if tolerated, should gradually be increased to achieve the highest tolerable doses. In addition, other lipid-lowering drugs may be needed, either in combination with statins, or alone, if statins are not tolerated at all. Stringent control of other risk factors can aid in reducing cardiovascular risk if attaining lipid treatment goals proves difficult.",

In time-varying models, taking the progressive increase in LV mass index during follow-up into account, 1 SD higher in-study LV mass index was consistently associated with 13% to 61% higher hazard for cardiovascular events (all P<0.01), independent of age, sex, body mass index, valvuloarterial impedance, LV ejection fraction and concentricity, and the presence of concomitant hypertension.",

Increment in alkyl- and alkenylphospholipids (plasmalogens) was prominent, and consistent with significant statin-induced increase in plasma polyunsaturated fatty acid levels. Comparison of the statin-mediated lipidomic changes in MetS with the abnormal plasma lipidomic profile characteristic of prediabetes and T2D in the Australian Diabetes, Obesity, and Lifestyle Study and San Antonio Family Heart Study cohorts by hypergeometric analysis revealed a significant shift toward the lipid profile of controls, indicative of a marked trend toward a normolipidemic phenotype.

Statin-mediated neuroprotection has been reported after acute cerebral ischemia. Unknown, however, is whether statins can alleviate the outcome of CCH. The present study investigated whether atorvastatin attenuates the cognitive and neurohistological outcome of CCH. Rats (12\u201315 months old) were trained in a non-food-rewarded radial maze, and then subjected to CCH. Atorvastatin (10 mg/kg, p.o.) was administered for 42 days or 15 days, beginning 5 h after the first occlusion stage. Retrograde memory performance was assessed at 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days of CCH, and expressed by \u201clatency,\u201d \u201cnumber of reference memory errors\u201d and \u201cnumber of working memory errors.\u201d Neurodegeneration was then examined at the hippocampus and cerebral cortex.

This CCH-induced retrograde amnesia was completely prevented by atorvastatin (latency: \u22124.3% to 3.3%; reference/working errors: \u22122.5% to 45.7%), regardless of the treatment duration. This effect was sustained during the entire behavioral testing period (5 weeks), even after discontinuing treatment.

    "93": "Low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs) mediate the uptake of lipoprotein particles into cells, as studied mainly in peripheral tissues. Here, we show that nerve growth factor (NGF) increases LDLR levels in PC6.3 cells and in cultured septal neurons from embryonic rat brain. Study of the mechanisms showed that NGF enhanced transcription of the LDLR gene, acting mainly via Tropomyosin receptor kinase A receptors. Simvastatin, a cholesterol-lowering drug, also increased the LDLR expression in PC6.3 cells. In addition, pro-NGF and pro-brain-derived neurotrophic factor, acting via the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) also increased LDLRs. We further observed that Myosin Regulatory Light Chain-Interacting Protein/Inducible Degrader of the LDLR (Mylip/Idol) was down-regulated by pro-NGF, whereas the other LDLR regulator, proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) was not significantly changed. On the functional side, NGF and pro-NGF increased lipoprotein uptake by neuronal cells as shown using diacetyl-labeled LDL. The addition of serum-derived lipoprotein particles in conjunction with NGF or simvastatin enhanced neurite outgrowth. Collectively, these results show that NGF and simvastatin are able to stimulate lipoprotein uptake by neurons with a positive effect on neurite outgrowth. Increases in LDLRs and lipoprotein particles in neurons could play a functional role during brain development, in neuroregeneration and after brain injuries. Nerve growth factor (NGF) and pro-NGF induce the expression of low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs) in neuronal cells leading to increased LDLR levels. Pro-NGF also down-regulated myosin regulatory light chain-interacting protein/inducible degrader of the LDLR (Mylip/Idol) that is involved in the degradation of LDLRs. NGF acts mainly via Tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) receptors, whereas pro-NGF stimulates p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). Elevated LDLRs upon NGF and pro-NGF treatments enhanced lipoprotein uptake by neurons. Addition of LDL particles further led to the stimulation of neurite outgrowth in PC6.3 cells after NGF or simvastatin treatments, suggesting a stimulatory role of lipoproteins on neuronal differentiation. In contrast, pro-NGF had no effect on neurite outgrowth either in the absence or presence of LDL particles. The precise mechanisms by which increased lipoproteins uptake can affect neurite outgrowth warrant further studies.",

    "102": "Statins lower plasma cholesterol by as much as 50%, thus reducing future cardiovascular events. However, the physiological effects of statins are diverse and not all are related to low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering. We performed a small clinical pilot study to assess the impact of statins on lipoprotein-associated proteins in healthy individuals (n = 10) with normal LDL-C (<130 mg/dL), who were treated with rosuvastatin (20 mg/day) for 28 days. Proteomic analysis of size-exclusion chromatography isolated LDL, large high density lipoprotein (HDL-L), and small HDL (HDL-S) fractions and spectral counting was used to compare relative protein detection before and after statin therapy. Significant protein changes were found in each lipoprotein pool and included both increases and decreases in several proteins involved in lipoprotein metabolism, complement regulation and acute phase response. The most dramatic effect of the rosuvastatin treatment was an increase in \u03b1-1-antirypsin (A1AT) spectral counts associated with HDL-L particles. Quantitative measurement by ELISA confirmed an average 5.7-fold increase in HDL-L associated A1AT. Molecular modeling predictions indicated that the hydrophobic reactive center loop of A1AT, the functional domain responsible for its protease inhibitor activity, is likely involved in lipid binding and association with HDL was found to protect A1AT against oxidative inactivation. Cell culture experiments, using J774 macrophages, demonstrated that the association of A1AT with HDL enhances its antiprotease activity, preventing elastase induced production of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1. In conclusion, we show that statins can significantly alter the protein composition of both LDL and HDL and our studies reveal a novel functional relationship between A1AT and HDL. The up-regulation of A1AT on HDL enhances its anti-inflammatory functionality, which may contribute to the non-lipid lowering beneficial effects of statins.",

Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association primary prevention guidelines are mainly on the basis of randomized controlled trials of statin-based low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering therapy for primary prevention of ASCVD events. Despite the clear demonstration of statin-based LDL-C lowering, substantial 10-year and lifetime risks of incident ASCVD continue. Although the 10-year risk is low in young and middle-aged adults who would not be treated according to current guidelines, they ultimately account for most incident ASCVD. If statin-based LDL-C lowering were initiated in them at an age before complex coronary plaques are common in the population, a substantial reduction in lifetime risk of incident coronary heart disease might be achieved. We examine this hypothesis and introduce the design of a currently recruiting trial to address it. (Eliminate Coronary Artery Disease [ECAD]; NCT02245087).",

In addition to risk scores derived from conventional cardiovascular risk factors, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and coronary artery calcium (CAC) have emerged as two of the widely accepted non traditional risk factors for atherosclerotic disease that have shown incremental prognostic value in predicting cardiovascular events. This review systematically assesses the role of hs-CRP and CAC in various studies and demonstrates meta-analyses of the incremental prognostic value of hs-CRP and CAC in identifying patients at risk of future CVD events. Compared with this, CAC showed better incremental prognostic value and might be a better indicator of ASCVD risk in asymptomatic adults.", 
    "105": "Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that clinically leads to increased low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. As a consequence, FH patients are at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Mutations are found in genes coding for the LDLR, apoB, and PCSK9, although FH cannot be ruled out in the absence of a mutation in one of these genes. It is pivotal to diagnose FH at an early age, since lipid lowering results in a decreased risk of cardiovascular complications especially if initiated early, but unfortunately FH is largely underdiagnosed. While a number of clinical criteria are available, identification of a pathogenic mutation in any of the three aforementioned genes is seen by many as a way to establish a definitive diagnosis of FH. It should be remembered that clinical treatment is based on LDL-C levels and not solely on presence or absence of genetic mutations as LDL-C is what drives risk. Traditionally, mutation detection has been done by means of dideoxy sequencing. However, novel molecular testing methods are gradually being introduced. These next generation sequencing-based methods are likely to be applied on broader scale once their efficacy and effect on cost are being established. Statins are the first-line therapy of choice for FH patients as they have been proven to reduce CVD risk across a range of conditions including hypercholesterolemia (though not specifically tested in FH). However, in a significant proportion of FH patients LDL-C goals are not met, despite the use of maximal statin doses and additional lipid-lowering therapies. This underlines the need for additional therapies, and inhibition of PCSK9 and CETP is among the most promising new therapeutic options. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of the latest information about the definition, diagnosis, screening, and current and novel therapies for FH.",

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the associations between statin use and NHL risk and survival. We searched multiple literature sources up to October 2014 and identified 10 studies on the risk of diagnosis with NHL and 9 studies on survival. Random effects model was used to calculate pooled odds ratio (PORs) for risk and pooled hazard ratio (PHR) for survival. Heterogeneity among studies was examined using the Tau-squared and the I-squared (I(2) ) tests. Statin use was associated with reduced risk for total NHL (POR\u2009=\u20090.82, 95% CI 0.69-0.99). Among statin users, there was a lower incidence risk for marginal zone lymphoma (POR\u2009=\u20090.54, 95% CI 0.31-0.94), but this was not observed for other types of NHL. However, statin use did not affect overall survival (PHR\u2009=\u20091.02, 95% CI 0.99-1.06) or event-free survival (PHR\u2009=\u20090.99, 95% CI 0.87-1.12) in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

Regular exercise and physical activity also have significant preventive effects against cardiovascular diseases by simultaneously reducing multiple risk factors. However, statins also produce a number of adverse events, including muscle pain, which increases dramatically in statin users who also exercise, likely limiting the cardiovascular benefits. Most importantly, reduced physical activity participation due to statin-related side effects can cancel out the benefits of the pharmacological treatment. Although exercise training offers more modest benefits compared to pharmacological therapy against traditional risk factors, considering the total impact of exercise on cardiovascular health, it is now evident that this intervention may offer a greater reduction of risks compared to statin therapy alone. However, primary recommendations regarding cardiovascular therapy still center around pharmacological approaches. Thus a new outlook is called for in clinical practice that provides room for physical activity and exercise training, thus lipid targets can be reached by a combined intervention along with improvements in other cardiovascular parameters, such as endothelial function and low-grade inflammation.

The study reveals that the effect of DBT concentration was highest on tensile strength, while SS concentration exhibited pronounced effect on SS flux through the abdominal skin of rat. According to Derringer's desirability prediction tool, the composition of optimized film was found to be 2% of SS, 2:1 ratio of PVA:EG and 40% of DBT. Under these conditions, the SSTF exhibited a predicted value of tensile strength and flux of 11.871 MPa and 43.569 \u03bcg/cm(2)/h, respectively. The in vivo hypolipidemic study conducted for 14 days in hyperlipidemia induced Sprague-Dawley rats reveals that the optimized SSTF exhibited significant lowering of blood lipid level.

Therefore, the aim of this work was to determine if the time elapsed from cement preparation until immersion in the solution (3 min for fresh cements, and 1h and 15 h for pre-set cements) had an influence on its physical properties, and correlating these to the drug release profile. Simvastatin was selected as a model drug, while brushite cement was used as drug carrier.

    "124": "Statins have been shown to exert anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrogenic properties in the liver. In the present study, we explored the mechanisms underlying anti-fibrogenic effects of statins in isolated hepatic myofibroblasts and focused on cyclooxyegnase-2, a major anti-proliferative pathway in these cells. We show that simvastatin and fluvastatin inhibit thymidine incorporation in hMF in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreatment of cells with NS398, a COX-2 inhibitor, partially blunted this effect. cAMP levels, essential to the inhibition of hMF proliferation, were increased by statins and inhibited by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Since statins modify prenylation of some important proteins in gene expression, we investigated the targets involved using selective inhibitors of prenyltransferases. Inhibition of geranylgeranylation resulted in the induction of COX-2 and mPGES-1. Using gel retardation assays, we further demonstrated that statins potentially activated the NF\u03baB and CRE/E-box binding for COX-2 promoter and the binding of GC-rich regions and GATA for mPGES-1. Together these data demonstrate that statin limit hepatic myofibroblasts proliferation via a COX-2 and mPGES-1 dependent pathway. These data suggest that statin-dependent increase of prostaglandin in hMF contributes to its anti-fibrogenic effect.",

A trend toward increased LBM (p = 0.059) was seen in the rosuvastatin arm without differences in creatinine kinase or self-reported physical activity (p \u2265 0.10). In a multivariable regression model, rosuvastatin was associated with a significant positive effect on LBM after adjusting for age, sex, race, smoking status, and detectable HIV-1 viral load. Higher baseline sCD163 correlated with increases in LBM from weeks 0 to 96 (p = 0.023); greater changes in total and leg lean mass were seen among statin users with higher compared to lower baseline IP-10 levels (LBM 1.8 vs. -0.3%; p = 0.028 and leg lean mass 2.9 vs. -1.7%; p = 0.012). Rosuvastatin is associated with an absence of toxicity on BMD and a potential benefit on LBM over 96 weeks of therapy.

It has been suggested that statins may offer a simple and cost-effective strategy to reduce some of the complications that occur in association with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Limited existing randomized trial evidence in the setting of cardiac surgery suggests that statins may reduce the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation. However, any effect of statins on other outcomes is less clear. The clinical significance of specific statin agent and dose, acute statin withdrawal and the potential benefits associated with statin reloading remain important yet currently unresolved issues. Despite limited high-quality evidence, class I recommendations have been made that all patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery should receive statin therapy unless contraindicated.",

Muscle-specific microRNAs (myomiRs) increase in plasma after prolonged exercise, but the patterns of myomiRs release after statin-associated muscle injury have not been examined. We examined the relationships between statin exposure, in vitro and in vivo muscle contraction, and expression of candidate circulating myomiRs. We measured plasma levels of myomiRs, circulating microRNA-1 (c-miR-1), c-miR-133a, c-miR-206, and c-miR-499-5p from 28 statin-using and 28 nonstatin-using runners before (PRE), immediately after (FINISH), and 24 h after they ran a 42-km footrace (the 2011 Boston marathon) (POST-24). To examine these cellular-regulation myomiRs, we used contracting mouse C2C12 myotubes in culture with and without statin exposure to compare intracellular and extracellular expression of these molecules. In marathoners, c-miR-1, c-miR-133a, and c-miR-206 increased at FINISH, returned to baseline at POST-24, and were unaffected by statin use. In contrast, c-miR-499-5p was unchanged at FINISH but increased at POST-24 among statin users compared with PRE and runners who did not take statins. In cultured C2C12 myotubes, extracellular c-miR-1, c-miR-133a, and c-miR-206 were significantly increased by muscle contraction regardless of statin use. In contrast, extracellular miR-499-5p was unaffected by either isolated statin exposure or isolated carbachol exposure but it was increased when muscle contraction was combined with statin exposure. In summary, we found that statin-potentiated muscle injury during exercise is accompanied by augmented extracellular release of miR-499-5p. Thus c-miR-499-5p may serve as a biomarker of statin-potentiated muscle damage.",

We searched PubMed, Embase and Web of Science up to August 2015 for identifying relevant prospective or case-control studies, or randomized clinical trials. Five prospective studies involving 60,911 patients reported the association between statin use and breast cancer mortality. Eleven prospective studies, 12 case-control studies and 9 randomized clinical trials involving 83,919 patients reported the association between statin use and breast cancer risk. After pooling estimates from all available studies, there was a significantly negative association between pre-diagnosis statin use and breast cancer mortality (for overall survival (OS): hazard ratio (HR) = 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54-0.84; for disease specific survival (DSS): HR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.53-0.99).

Additionally, there was a non-linear relationship for the duration of post-diagnosis statin use with breast cancer specific mortality. On the other hand, with regards to the relationship between statin use and breast cancer risk, no significant association was detected.

We previously showed that endothelial Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) regulates vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (Vcam1) expression and neointimal formation after carotid injury. In this study, we determined whether endothelial Klf4 is involved in ischemic AKI using endothelial Klf4 conditional knockout (Klf4 cKO) mice generated by breeding Tek-Cre mice and Klf4 floxed mice. Klf4 cKO mice were phenotypically normal before surgery. However, after renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, Klf4 cKO mice exhibited elevated serum levels of urea nitrogen and creatinine and aggravated renal histology compared with those of Klf4 floxed controls. Moreover, Klf4 cKO mice exhibited enhanced accumulation of neutrophils and lymphocytes and elevated expression of cell adhesion molecules, including Vcam1 and Icam1, in injured kidneys. Notably, statins ameliorated renal ischemia-reperfusion injury in control mice but not in Klf4 cKO mice. Mechanistic analyses in cultured endothelial cells revealed that statins increased KLF4 expression and that KLF4 mediated the suppressive effect of statins on TNF-\u03b1-induced VCAM1 expression by reducing NF-\u03baB binding to the VCAM1 promoter. These results provide evidence that endothelial Klf4 is renoprotective and mediates statin-induced protection against ischemic AKI by regulating the expression of cell adhesion molecules and concomitant recruitment of inflammatory cells.",

    "184": "Statins and dietary modifications are the cornerstone of hypercholesterolemia management. Although it is well known that possible adverse effect of statins can occur due to drug-drug interactions, food-drug interactions are a commonly overlooked aspect. In particular, flavonoids could interfere with statins' bioavailability through different mechanisms, such as competition with cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, esterases, uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases and transporters (P-glycoprotein, multi-drug resistance-associated proteins, organic anion transporting polypeptides, breast cancer-resistance protein and monocarboxylate transporters). Transporters are characterized by low substrate specificity and flavonoid- rich foods could interfere with the bioavailability of all statins at this level. On the other hand, in addition to being substrates of drug metabolism/ transport systems, flavonoids are also able to modulate gene expression of enzymes and transporters. Therefore, long-term transcriptional induction may increase the clearance of statins, despite flavonoids act as competitive inhibitors after bolus consumption. In humans, major interactions were observed between grapefruit juice and statins that are substrates of P-glycoprotein/CYP3A, but other fruit juices also affect the bioavailability of statins that are not metabolised by CYP. Even if flavonoids could play a role in the prevention of hypercholesterolemia, the question whether there's a helpful or dangerous association between flavonoid-rich foods and statins, due to the interactions between flavonoid-rich foods and statins and the potential associated adverse effects of statins, remain unanswered. Therefore, the anamnesis of patients must include detailed information about their eating habits and the present review suggests monitoring and reporting any possible case of interaction between a prescribed statin and food.",

However, whether such comorbidities alter response to anti-osteoporotic treatment is unknown. We did post hoc analyses of combined data from three risedronate Japanese phase III trials to determine whether the presence of DM, HT, or DL affects its efficacy and safety. Data from 885 subjects who received 48-week treatment with risedronate were collected and combined from the three phase III trials.

Bone mineral density (BMD), urinary type 1 collagen N-telopeptide (uNTX), and serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) were measured at baseline and sequentially until 48 weeks. BMD or bone markers were not different between any of the two groups. Overall, BMD was increased by 5.52%, and uNTX and BAP were decreased by 35.4 and 33.8%, respectively. Some bone markers were slightly lower in DM and DL subjects, but the responses to risedronate were not significantly different. Statin users had lower uNTX and BAP, but showed no difference in the treatment response. All the other medications had no apparent effect. Adverse event incidence was marginally higher in DL compared with non-DL (Relative risk 1.06; 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.11), but was not related to increase in any specific events.

More recently, several lines of evidence demonstrate that statins, in addition to their peripheral effects, produce a wide variety of effects in the brain and may be beneficial in neurological and psychiatric conditions. In this study, we allowed rats to self-administer cocaine for several weeks and, at the end of self-administration training, we treated them with low doses of statins daily for a 21-day period of abstinence. Chronic administration of brain-penetrating statins, simvastatin (1\u2009mg/kg) and atorvastatin (1\u2009mg/kg), reduced cocaine seeking compared with vehicle, whereas administration of pravastatin (2\u2009mg/kg), a statin with low brain penetrability, did not. Importantly, the effects of brain-penetrating statins persisted even after discontinuation of the treatment and were specific for drug seeking because drug taking was not altered by simvastatin treatment. Finally, the effects of simvastatin were found to generalize to another drug of abuse such as nicotine, but not to food reward, and to reinstatement of cocaine seeking induced by stress. These results demonstrate that brain-penetrating statins can reduce risks of relapse to addiction. Given their well-known safety profile in humans, statins could be a novel effective treatment for relapse to cocaine and nicotine addiction and their use could be implemented in clinical settings without major health risks.",

Although both men and women bearing the AA genotype showed a higher ratio of full-length HMGCR mRNA/total HMGCR mRNA compared with individuals without it (n=37, P<0.05), overall transcription of HMGCR was decreased and increased in men and women carrying this genotype, respectively (n=37, P<0.01 and P<0.05).

Preoperative statin and antiplatelet use increased from 58.87 to 71.81 per cent (P = 0.0082) and 60.8 to 78.38 per cent (P < 0.0001), respectively. Discharge statin and antiplatelet use increased from 69.09 to 80.37 per cent (P = 0.0037) and 80.47 to 88.11 per cent (P = 0.0148), respectively. Vascular access guidance improved from 32.89 to 76.23 per cent (P < 0.0001). Our results demonstrate the unique regional quality group structure of the VQI\u00ae improves compliance with selected process measures in the So Cal VOICe. Continued data collection will determine the impact of these process improvements on long-term patient outcomes.", 
    "201": "COPD is currently the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Statins are lipid lowering agents with documented cardiovascular benefits. Observational studies have shown that statins may have a beneficial role in COPD. The impact of statins on blood gene expression from COPD patients is largely unknown.", 
    "202": "Identify blood gene signature associated with statin use in COPD patients, and the pathways underpinning this signature that could explain any potential benefits in COPD.", 
    "203": "Whole blood gene expression was measured on 168 statin users and 451 non-users from the ECLIPSE study using the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.1 ST microarray chips. Factor Analysis for Robust Microarray Summarization (FARMS) was used to process the expression data. Differential gene expression analysis was undertaken using the Linear Models for Microarray data (Limma) package adjusting for propensity score and surrogate variables. Similarity of the expression signal with published gene expression profiles was performed in ProfileChaser.", 
    "204": "25 genes were differentially expressed between statin users and non-users at an FDR of 10%, including LDLR, CXCR2, SC4MOL, FAM108A1, IFI35, FRYL, ABCG1, MYLIP, and DHCR24. The 25 genes were significantly enriched in cholesterol homeostasis and metabolism pathways. The resulting gene signature showed correlation with Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease and acute myeloid leukemia gene signatures.", 
    "205": "The blood gene signature of statins' use in COPD patients was enriched in cholesterol homeostasis pathways. Further studies are needed to delineate the role of these pathways in lung biology.", 
    "206": "Elevated cholesterol in mid-life has been associated with increased risk of dementia in later life. We have previously shown that low density lipoprotein (LDL) is more oxidised in the plasma of dementia patients although total cholesterol levels remained unchanged. Increased systemic oxidative modification (oxLDL) and nitration is also observed during hypercholesterolemia. We have investigated the hypothesis that disruption of blood brain barrier (BBB) function by oxLDL and their lipids may increase risk of neurodegeneration in later life and that statin intervention can mitigate the effects of hyperlipidaemia in mid-life. LDL isolated from statin-na\u00efve hypercholesterolaemic subjects had higher mobility by agarose gel electrophoresis (Rf;0.53\u00b10.06) and 8-isoprostane F2\u03b1 concentration (43.5\u00b18.42pg/ml) compared to control subjects (Rf; 0.46\u00b10.05 and 24.2\u00b15.37pg/ml respectively; p<0.05). Compared to HMVEC treatment with the LDL-lipids (5\u03bcM) from normolipidaemic subjects, LDL-lipids from hypercholesterolaemic subjects increased barrier permeability (103.4\u00b112.5 \u03a9cm2 v 66.7\u00b17.3 \u03a9cm2,P<0.01) and decreased cellular glutathione levels (18.5nmol/mg v 12.3nmol/mg) compared to untreated cells (26.2\u00b13.6nmol/mg). LDL-lipids isolated from normolipidaemic subjects shows reduced risk to damage a BBB model compared with LDL-lipids from hypercholesterolaemic subjects. Moreover, a three month statin-intervention reduced the propensity for LDL-lipids from subjects with hyperlipidaemia to damage HMVEC. Post-statin treatment the cytotoxic and pro-inflammatory effects of LDL lipids disappeared. These data support the hypothesis that in vivo intervention with statins modifies LDL lipid oxidation, exerting a protective effect against in microvascular damage independent of cholesterol concentration.", 
    "207": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the change in the expression and the activity of intestinal P-glycoprotein (efflux transporter) with progression of diabetes in rats. Diabetes was induced in Wistar rats using a combination of low dose streptozotocin along with high fat diet. The expression of intestinal P-glycoprotein significantly increased (P\u22640.05) with the progression of diabetes which was inferred from the mRNA analysis of mdr1a and mdr1b genes in the ileum segment of rat intestine. Furthermore, a significant increase (P\u22640.05) in Na(+)-K(+) ATPase activity was observed in the ileum segment of rat intestine with the progression of diabetes. As a result of this, a significant decrease in the intestinal uptake and peroral bioavailability of the P-glycoprotein substrates (verapamil and atorvastatin) was observed along with the progression of diabetes as compared to normal animals. To address this problem of impaired drug uptake and bioavailability, a reported P-glycoprotein inhibitor, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, was experimentally evaluated. The treatment with epigallocatechin-3-gallate resulted in significant reduction in the expression and activity of P-glycoprotein and subsequent improvement in the intestinal uptake and peroral bioavailability of both verapamil and atorvastatin in normal as well as in diabetic animals. The findings of this study rationalised the use and established the mechanism of action of epigallocatechin-3-gallate to overcome P-glycoprotein mediated drug efflux and will also be helpful in therapeutic drug monitoring in diabetes.",

Drug-drug interactions were evaluated in healthy volunteers to develop dosing recommendations for HCV-infected subjects. Mechanism-based interactions were evaluated for ketoconazole, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, digoxin, warfarin, and omeprazole. Interactions were also evaluated for duloxetine, escitalopram, methadone, and buprenorphine-naloxone. Ratios of geometric means with 90% confidence intervals for the maximum plasma concentration and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve were estimated to assess the magnitude of the interactions. For most medications, coadministration with the 2D regimen resulted in a <50% change in exposures. Ketoconazole, digoxin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin exposures increased by up to 105%, 58%, 76%, and 161%, respectively, and omeprazole exposures decreased by approximately 50%. Clinically meaningful changes in ombitasvir, paritaprevir, or ritonavir exposures were not observed. In summary, all 11 medications evaluated can be coadministered with the 2D regimen, with most medications requiring no dose adjustment. Ketoconazole, digoxin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin require lower doses, and omeprazole may require a higher dose. No dose adjustment is required for the 2D regimen.", 
    "209": "Molecular docking techniques have now been widely used to predict the protein-ligand binding modes, especially when the structures of crystal complexes are not available. Most docking algorithms are able to effectively generate and rank a large number of probable binding poses. However, it is hard for them to accurately evaluate these poses and identify the most accurate binding structure. In this study, we first examined the performance of some docking programs, based on a testing set made of 15 crystal complexes with drug statins for the human 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR). We found that most of the top ranking HMGR-statin binding poses, predicted by the docking programs, were energetically unstable as revealed by the high theoretical-level calculations, which were usually accompanied by the large deviations from the geometric parameters of the corresponding crystal binding structures. Subsequently, we proposed a new computational protocol, DOX, based on the joint use of molecular Docking, ONIOM, and eXtended ONIOM (XO) methods to predict the accurate binding structures for the protein-ligand complexes of interest. Our testing results demonstrate that the DOX protocol can efficiently predict accurate geometries for all 15 HMGR-statin crystal complexes without exception. This study suggests a promising computational route, as an effective alternative to the experimental one, toward predicting the accurate binding structures, which is the prerequisite for all the deep understandings of the properties, functions, and mechanisms of the protein-ligand complexes.", 
    "210": "Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) remains a major burden on morbidity and mortality in the United States. Medical professionals and students often use the mnemonic 'MONA' (morphine, oxygen, nitroglycerin and aspirin) to recall treatments for ACS; however, this list of therapies is outdated. We provide a historical perspective on 'MONA,' attempt to uncover its origin in the medical literature, and demonstrate the myriad changes that have occurred over the last 50 years of ACS management. We have developed a novel mnemonic, 'THROMBINS2' (thienopyridines, heparin/enoxaparin, renin-angiotensin system blockers, oxygen, morphine, beta blocker, intervention, nitroglycerin, statin/salicylate) to help bedside clinicians recall all the elements of contemporary ACS management. We demonstrate the mortality benefit for each component of contemporary ACS management, correlating the continued improvement with historical data on mortality after myocardial infarction. We encourage providers to utilize this mnemonic to explore options and guide treatments in ACS patients.", 
    "211": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a high-cholesterol diet in the presence and absence of statin on Cu-Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl (PCO), and nitric oxide (NO) of blood and heart tissue, the antioxidant activity of serum paraoxonase-1 (PON-1), and on the blood lipid profile of rabbits. The animals were divided into four groups each of which included 10 rabbits. Rabbits in group 1 received a regular rabbit chow diet (normal diet) for 8 weeks; those in group 2 received atorvastatin (0.3 mg atorvastatin per day/kg body weight) for 8 weeks; those in group 3 received high-cholesterol diet for 8 weeks; and those in group 4 received high-cholesterol diet for 4 weeks, a high-cholesterol diet + atorvastatin (0.3 mg atorvastatin per day/kg body weight) for 8 weeks. The parameters were measured by spectrophotometric methods. As expected, the atherogenic diet caused a pronounced increase in lipid profile (not HDL) parameters. Rabbits in group 3 showed higher PCO, MDA, and NO levels in circulating and heart tissue compared to the rabbits in group 1. Atorvastatin has prevented or limited LDL oxidation and has showed constitutively beneficial effects in group 4. Increased LDL-C, PCO, MDA, and NO levels leading to decreasing PON-1 activity thus create a predisposition to atherogenesis in this model. But atorvastatin administration partly ameliorated oxidative damage in heart injury of hypercholesterolemic rabbits. Atorvastatin which functions as a potent antioxidant agent may inhibit this LDL-C oxidation by increasing PON-1 activity in atherogenesis."
