Despite improvements in cardiovascular disease prevention efforts, there remain gaps in cardiovascular disease awareness among women, as well as age and racial disparities in ASCVD outcomes for women. Disparity also exists in the impact the traditional risk factors confer on ASCVD risk between women and men, with smoking and diabetes both resulting in stronger relative risks in women compared to men. Additionally there are risk factors that are unique to women (such as pregnancy-related factors) or that disproportionally affect women (such as auto-immune disease) where preventive efforts should be targeted. Risk assessment and management must also be sex-specific to effectively reduce cardiovascular disease and improve outcomes among women. Evidence supports the use of statin therapy for primary prevention in women at higher ASCVD risk. However, some pause should be given to prescribing aspirin therapy in women without known ASCVD, with most evidence supporting the use of aspirin for women\u226565 years not at increased risk for bleeding. This review article will summarize (1) traditional and non-traditional assessments of ASCVD risk and (2) lifestyle and pharmacologic therapies for the primary prevention of ASCVD in women.",

Although the use of statins has been shown to enhance antimicrobial treated Helicobacter pylori eradication and reduce H. pylori-mediated inflammation, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. In this study, in vitro and ex vivo macrophage models were established to investigate the molecular pathways involved in statin-mediated inhibition of H. pylori-induced inflammation. Our study showed that statin treatment resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in intracellular H. pylori burden in both RAW264.7 macrophage cells and murine peritoneal exudate macrophages (PEMs). Furthermore, statin yielded enhanced early endosome maturation and subsequent activation of the autophagy pathway, which promotes lysosomal fusion resulting in degradation of sequestered bacteria, and in turn attenuates interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 production. These results indicate that statin not only reduces cellular cholesterol but also decreases the H. pylori burden in macrophages by promoting autophagy, consequently alleviating H. pylori-induced inflammation.", 
    "7": "Increasing evidence has highlighted the pivotal role that intimal macrophage (iM\u03a6) plays in the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic plaques, which represents an attractive target for atherosclerosis treatment. In this work, to address the insufficient specificity of conventional reconstituted high-density lipoprotein (rHDL) for iM\u03a6 and its limited cholesterol efflux ability, we designed a hyaluronan (HA)-anchored core-shell rHDL. This nanoparticle achieved efficient iM\u03a6-targeted drug delivery via a multistage-targeting approach, and excellent cellular cholesterol removal. It contained a biodegradable poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) core within a lipid bilayer, and apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) absorbing on the lipid bilayer was covalently decorated with HA. The covalent HA coating with superior stability and greater shielding was favorable for not only minimizing the liver uptake but also facilitating the accumulation of nanoparticles at leaky endothelium overexpressing CD44 receptors in atherosclerotic plaques. The ultimate iM\u03a6 homing was achieved via apoA-I after HA coating degraded by hyaluronidase (HAase) (abundant in atherosclerotic plaque). The multistage-targeting mechanism was revealed on the established injured endothelium-macrophage co-culture dynamic system. Upon treatment with HAase in vitro, the nanoparticle HA-(C)-PLGA-rHDL exhibited a greater cholesterol efflux capacity compared with conventional rHDL (2.43-fold). Better targeting efficiency toward iM\u03a6 and attenuated liver accumulation were further proved by results from ex vivo imaging and iM\u03a6-specific fluorescence localization. Ultimately, HA-(C)-PLGA-rHDL loaded with simvastatin realized the most potent anti-atherogenic efficacies in model animals over other preparations. Thus, the HAase-responsive HDL-mimetic nanoparticle was shown in this study to be a promising nanocarrier for anti-atherogenic therapy, in the light of efficient iM\u03a6-targeted drug delivery and excellent function of mediating cellular cholesterol efflux.",

Thus, statins and anti-platelet drugs constitute mainstays in cardiovascular prevention/treatment.

However, washed platelets from HC-patients had increased membrane cholesterol, TF protein and TF-PCA. The platelet TF-dependent PCA was specifically expressed after VWF-induced GPIb\u03b1 activation. Rosuvastatin, but not atorvastatin treatment, normalized the membrane cholesterol, TF protein and TF-PCA in HC-patients, possibly unveiling a new pleiotropic effect of rosuvastatin.

We systematically reviewed the literature regarding the use of medications known to reduce mortality in patients with cardiac troponin (cTn) elevation due to type I MI (\u03b2 blockers, statin, and aspirin) in studies of critically ill patients without Type I MI. All PubMed publications between 1976-2/19/16 were reviewed. Search terms included: \u03b2 blocker or aspirin or statin and intensive care unit (ICU) or critically ill or sepsis; 497 primary references were obtained. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) study population consisted of critically ill patients in the ICU with non-cardiovascular illnesses, (2) mortality end point, (3) severity of illness (or injury) was measured, and (4) the antiplatelet agent was primarily aspirin. Retrospective investigations, prospective observational studies, meta-analysis, systematic review, and randomized controlled trials were included; case reports were excluded. 25 primary references were obtained. The data were extracted and tabulated using data collection headings as follows: article title, first author/year/reference number, study type/design, population studied, outcome and intervention, and study question addressed. Evidence was not graded as the majority of studies were non-randomized (low-to-moderate quality). 11 studies were found through bibliography reviews for a total of 36 references. In conclusion, \u03b2 blockers, statins, and aspirin may play a role in reducing mortality in non-cardiac critically ill patients.

Therefore, we investigated the effects of statin on autophagy markers and evaluated the neuroprotective effect of rosuvastatin against rotenone-induced neurotoxicity. As an in vitro model of Parkinson's disease(PD) we adopted the rotenone-induced neurotoxicity model in SH-SY5Y cells. Cell viability was measured using the MTT assay, and to detect the expression of LC3 and \u03b1-synuclein, immunofluorescence analysis was performed. Intracellular signaling proteins associated with autophagy were explored via immunoblotting. Treatment with rosuvastatin alone increased the levels of mTOR-independent/upstream autophagy markers, including Beclin-1 and AMPK. Rotenone treatment of SH-SY5Y cells reduced their viability and \u03b1-synuclein expression; simultaneous exposure to rosuvastatin significantly restored these parameters. Rotenone enhanced mTOR expression and suppressed Beclin-1 expression, indicating suppression of the autophagic system. However, combined treatment with rosuvastatin also restored the Beclin-1 expression and decreased mTOR expression. We demonstrated the neuroprotective effect of statin in SH-SY5Y cells against rotenone-induced neurotoxicity, as well as the modulation of \u0251-synuclein expression. The neuroprotective mechanism is likely to be associated with enhanced autophagy. The neuroprotective effect of statin on rotenone-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity with modulation of autophagy provides a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PD.", 
    "35": "The omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has multiple actions potentially conferring cardiovascular benefit, including lowering serum triglyceride (TG) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) levels and potentially reducing key steps in atherogenesis. Dietary supplements are a common source of omega-3 fatty acids in the US, but virtually all contain docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in addition to EPA, and lipid effects differ between DHA and EPA. Contrary to popular belief, no over-the-counter omega-3 products are available in the US, only prescription products and dietary supplements. Among the US prescription omega-3 products, only one contains EPA exclusively (Vascepa); another closely related prescription omega-3 product also contains highly purified EPA, but is approved only in Japan and is provided in different capsule sizes. These\u00a0high-purity EPA products do not raise low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, even in patients with TG levels >500\u00a0mg/dL, in contrast to the increase in LDL-C levels with prescription omega-3 products that also contain DHA. The Japanese prescription EPA product was shown to significantly reduce major coronary events in hypercholesterolemic patients when added to statin therapy in the Japan EPA Lipid Intervention Study (JELIS). The effects of Vascepa on cardiovascular outcomes are being investigated in statin-treated patients with high TG levels in the Reduction of Cardiovascular Events With EPA-Intervention Trial (REDUCE-IT).", 
    "36": "The serine protease proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) binds to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) and directs it to lysosomal degradation. This results in decreased numbers of LDLR available on the cell surface to bind LDL particles and remove them from the circulation which in turn leads to an increase in circulating LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations. Since the role PCSK9 plays in LDLC metabolism has been discovered in 2003 there have been major efforts in finding efficient and safe methods to inhibit it. Amongst those the fully human anti-PCSK9 antibodies alirocumab and evolocumab have been studied in a wide range of patients such as in those with statin intolerance, as add-on to statin therapy, as monotherapy and in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and have been shown to decrease LDL-C overall by ~50-70%. Rates of achieving LDL-C goals, depending on individual risk, are up to 87 -98% of treated subjects. Multiple phase III studies with these drugs are already completed and cardiovascular endpoint trials are expected to be concluded by the end of 2016 and 2017 for evolocumab and alirocumab, respectively. In 2015 both alirocumab and evolocumab were approved for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in the European Union and in the US. Preliminary data show an improvement in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality by ~50%. If the large ongoing endpoint trials confirm the cardiovascular efficacy and overall safety of these drugs, PCSK9 antibodies will revolutionarize lipid-lowering therapy.", 
    "37": "Background The Japan Statin Treatment Against Recurrent Stroke (J-STARS) is a clinical trial that administered pravastatin for secondary stroke prevention. Lipid concentrations are a well-established risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases. Elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) indicates a high risk of inflammatory reactions. In clinical trials, internationally approved standardization is essential for obtaining study results that are comparable with those from overseas. Therefore, total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG) and hs-CRP were standardized throughout a 10-year study period. Methods J-STARS specified a single clinical laboratory for blood analyses. Four lipids were evaluated by calculating the total error: accuracy (absolute mean %bias vs. reference value)\u2009+\u2009precision (1.96 among-run coefficient of variation [CV, %]). Accuracy for hs-CRP was ensured using a calibrator traceable to the international plasma protein reference material and precision was evaluated by CV. Results Average total errors (standard deviation, %) throughout the study period were as follows: TC 1.35% (0.290%), HDL-C 2.45% (1.087%), LDL-C 2.65% (0.956%) and TG 3.70% (0.559%). Four lipids met the performance criteria of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The precision of hs-CRP was 3.28% (0.627%), which met the performance criterion established by the American Heart Association/CDC. Conclusions Based on standardization, the results of J-STARS appear to be comparable with those of similar intervention-based clinical studies on statins overseas. These study results will contribute to the establishment of preventive measures against recurrent stroke in Japanese patients. J-STARS is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov under NCT00221104.",

The association between lipid levels and first venous thrombosis has been studied extensively. However, data on the role of lipids in the risk of recurrence are scarce. Objective To assess the association between lipid levels and recurrent venous thrombosis. Patients/Methods Patients with a first venous thrombosis from the MEGA study were included. Follow-up started at the date of end of anticoagulant treatment. Percentile categories of total/low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipoproteins B and A1 were established (< 10th, 10th-25th, 25th-75th [reference], 75th-90th, > 90th percentile). Lipids were measured at least 3 months after discontinuing anticoagulation. Results Of 2106 patients followed for a median of 6.9 years, 326 developed recurrence (incidence rate, 2.7/100 patient-years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5-3.1). With hazard ratios ranging from 0.88 (95% CI, 0.55-1.42) to 1.33 (95% CI, 0.86-2.04) in the highest percentile category vs. the reference, we found no association across percentile categories between recurrence and lipid levels in age- and sex-adjusted models, nor after further adjustments for body mass index, diabetes, estrogen and statin use, and duration of anticoagulation. Subgroup analyses stratified by unprovoked or provoked first events, location (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) and sex also did not reveal an association with any of the lipid levels studied. Conclusions Testing lipid levels did not identify patients at an increased risk of recurrent venous thrombosis in this study, including those with unprovoked first events, and these should not influence decisions on duration of anticoagulation.", 
    "40": "The aim of this review is to report on influence of statins on mitochondria function. Statins are serum cholesterol-lowering drugs. They act by competitively inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (EC 1.1.1.88), the first committed enzyme of the mevalonate pathway. In this way, statins inhibit the endogenous cholesterol synthesis. Emerging evidence suggest that statins impair mitochondria, which is demonstrated by abnormal mitochondrial morphology, decreased oxidative phosphorylation capacity and yield, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Mechanisms of statin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction are not fully understood. The following causes are proposed: (i) deficiency of coenzyme Q10, an important electron carrier of mitochondrial respiratory chain; (ii) inhibition of respiratory chain complexes; (iii) inhibitory effect on protein prenylation; and (iv) induction of mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. These phenomena could play a significant role in the etiology of statin-induced disease, especially myopathy.

    "42": "Obesity can cause or worsen asthma. Compared with common asthma, obese asthma is difficult to control. Statins are effective serum cholesterol-lowering agents in clinical practice, and they also have anti-inflammatory properties, which in theory are potentially beneficial in asthma. Many studies have shown that simvastatin has good therapeutic effect in animal models of asthma. However, the therapeutic effect and action mechanism of simvastatin for obese asthma remain unclear. Leptin, a satiety hormone, is in positive correlation with total body fat mass and may also play a significant role in the pathogenesis of asthma. In this study, we use the method of high-fat diet and ovalbumin (OVA) sensitization and challenge to establish the mouse model of obesity and asthma, and find that obese asthmatic mice has higher levels of glucose, lipid and leptin in serum, and neutrophil percentage in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and more severe airway inflammation and structural changes in lung tissues than non-obese asthmatic mice, and respond poorly to dexamethasone treatment, which indicates that obese asthma might belong to steroid-resistant (SR) asthma. Simvastatin treatment reduces the levels of glucose, lipid, leptin and neutrophil percentage, and improves airway inflammation and remodeling, which can be as a potential therapeutic target used in the treatment of obese asthma in humans. Correlation analysis shows that there is positive correlation between neutrophil percentage and serum leptin/cholesterol level, which indicates that the therapeutic efficacy of simvastatin on obese asthma might be associated with improving dyslipidemia and decreasing leptin level.",

On the basis of proven cardiovascular and renal benefit, the antihyperglycaemic drugs empagliflozin, liraglutide, and semaglutide-the latter being under review for approval by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency-should be preferentially used as second-line treatments in these patient populations, typically in addition to metformin. Further treatment differentiation among the remainder of the antihyperglycaemic drugs should be made on the basis of evidence regarding cardiovascular safety, which is available for lixisenatide, alogliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin, and insulin glargine. The risk of heart failure, stroke, or retinopathy, or prevalent fasting versus postprandial hyperglycaemia, could also be considered in treatment decision making.

Short- and longer-term outcomes in studies in Asian patients were consistent with these findings. Pitavastatin was generally well tolerated and did not appear to adversely affect glucose metabolism parameters (e.g. fasting blood glucose, fasting plasma glucose, fasting plasma insulin, glycated hemoglobin) in short- and longer-term prospective and post-marketing surveillance studies in adults. Moreover, in combination with lifestyle modification advice, it was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of progression from impaired glucose tolerance to diabetes relative to lifestyle modification advice alone in a longer-term study in Japanese subjects.

PDR and maculopathy prevalence were 0 and 0.7% for <10 years T1DM duration. PDR prevalence was 4%, 8%, and 16% for 10-19.9 years, 20-29.9, years and \u226530 years duration, respectively. Maculopathy prevalence was 15.6%, 18%, and 11% for 10-19.9 years, 20-29.9 years, and \u226530 years duration, respectively. In univariate analysis, PDR was associated with T1DM duration (odds ratio (OR) 1.07/year), age (OR 1.03/year), systolic blood pressure (OR 1.03/mmHg), and antihypertensive therapy (OR 10.63), while maculopathy was associated with duration (OR 1.03/year) and statin therapy (OR 2.83). In multivariate analysis, disease duration (OR 1.07/year) and antihypertensive therapy (OR 6.87) remained significantly associated with PDR, and maculopathy with statin therapy (OR 2.27).ConclusionThis study confirms T1DM duration is a strong risk factor for sight-threatening DR. Maculopathy and PDR prevalence within 10 years of T1DM diagnosis is very low. PDR prevalence at 10-20 years was 4% and then doubled for every 10-year interval thereafter up to 16% with \u226530 years duration.

In patients with progression of atherosclerosis despite treatment, an important role could play high level of lipoprotein (a) - Lp(a), particle with a high atherothrombotic potential. Until now, it was difficult to reduce LDL-C to the desired range by recent therapy: combination of lifestyle changes, high doses of strong statins and ezetimibe. Lp(a) was not affected by these measures at all. Recently, we have the opportunity to reduce significantly LDLc and Lp(a), by two treatment modalities. The first is a lipoprotein apheresis that reduces LDL-C and Lp(a) by 60-80 %. The second one are inhibitors of proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 which lower LDL-C similarly to lipoprotein apheresis; Lp(a), approximately by 25 %. Both methods, or their combination could, therefore, significantly affect prognosis of patients with atherosclerosis out of control, in which the treatment by available therapy have not been successful or not possible for intolerance especially in the case of statins.Key words: LDL cholesterol - lipoprotein (a) - lipoprotein apheresis - PCSK9 inhibitors.",

This is certainly true and HLP or DLP overall affect tens of percents of adults. However we cannot overlook the fact that disorders (mostly congenital) of lipid metabolism exist which, though not formally defined as such, amply satisfy the conditions for classification as rare diseases. Our account only includes a brief overview of the rare HLPs based on the dominant disorder of lipid metabolism, i.e. we shall mention the rare primary forms of hypercholesterolemia, primary forms of hypertriglyceridemia and the rare primary combined forms of HLP. In recent years an amazing progress has been reached relating to these diseases, in particular in the area of exact identification of the genetic defect and the mechanism of defect formation, however each of these diseases would require a separate article, though outside the field of clinical internal medicine. Therefore we shall discuss homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) in greater depth, partially also the \"severe\" form of heterozygous FH and in the following part the lipoprotein lipase deficiency; that means, diseases which present an extreme and even fatal risk for their carriers at a young age, but on the other hand, new therapeutic possibilities are offered within their treatment. An internist then should be alert to the suspicion that the described diseases may be involved, know about their main symptoms, where to refer the patient and how to treat them. Also dysbetalipoproteinemia (or type III HLP) will be briefly mentioned. Homozygous FH occurs with the frequency of 1 : 1\u202f000\u202f000 (maybe even more frequently, 1 : 160\u202f000), it is characterized by severe isolated hypercholesterolemia (overall cholesterol typically equal to 15 mmol/l or more), xanthomatosis and first of all by a very early manifestation of a cardiovascular disease. Myocardial infarction is not an exception even in childhood. The therapy is based on high-dose statins, statins in combination with ezetimib and now also newly on PCSK9 inhibitors. Lomitapid and partly also mipomersen hold great promise for patients. LDL apheresis then represents an aggressive form of treatment. Lipoprotein lipase deficiency (type I HLP) is mainly characterized by severe hypertriglyceridemia, serum milky in colour, and xanthomatosis. A fatal complication is acute recurrent pancreatitis. A critical part of the treatment is diet, however it alone is not enough to control a genetic disorder. The only approved treatment is gene therapy. Experimentally, as an \"off label\" therapy, it is used in case studies with a lomitapid effect. We have our own experience with this experimental therapy. Dysbetalipoproteinemia is a congenital disorder of lipoprotein metabolism, characterized by high cholesterol (CH) and triglyceride (TG) levels. The underlying cause of this disease is the defect of the gene providing for apolipoprotein E. It is clinically manifested by xanthomatosis, however primarily by an early manifestation of atherosclerosis (rather peripheral than coronary).Key words: Lipoprotein lipase deficiency - dysbetalipoproteinemia - familial hypercholesterolemia - gene therapy - homozygous FH - LDL apheresis - lomitapid - mipomersen - PCSK9 inhibitors - rare diseases.",

    "77": "The evidence from trials of statin therapy suggests that benefits in cardiovascular disease (CVD) event reduction are proportional to the magnitude of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering. The lack of a threshold at which LDL-C lowering is not beneficial, in terms of CVD prevention observed in these trials, is supported by epidemiological and genetic studies reporting the cardio-protective effects of lifelong low exposure to atherogenic cholesterol in a graded fashion. Providing that intensive LDL-C lowering is safe, these observations suggest that many individuals even at current LDL-C treatment targets could benefit. Here, we review recent safety and efficacy data from trials of adjunctive therapy, with LDL-C lowering beyond that achieved by statin therapy, and their potential implications for current guideline targets. Finally, the application of current guidance in the context of pre-treatment LDL-C concentration and deployment of statin therapy is also discussed. The number of patients requiring treatment to prevent a CVD event with statin treatment has been shown to differ markedly according to the pre-treatment LDL-C concentration even when absolute CVD risk is similar. It produces more likelihood of benefit when absolute LDL-C reduction is greater which is largely dependent on pre-treatment LDL-C concentration. This also has to be taken in consideration when deploying new agents like proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 monoclonal antibodies. Patients with highest LDL-C concentration despite maximum statin and ezetimibe therapy will attain most absolute LDL-C reduction when treated with proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 monoclonal antibodies, hence benefit most in term of CVD risk reduction.",

Furthermore, both statins and Xuezhikang (XZK) are widely used in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease risk because of their pleiotropic effects on the cardiovascular system. However, their effects on sPLA2-IIA are still controversial. We investigated the regulation of sPLA2-IIA by rat thoracic aorta smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in culture. Cells were first incubated with IL-1\u03b2 alone to induce expression of sPLA2-IIA and then treated with several concentrations of statins or XZK for different times in the absence or presence of IL-1\u03b2. We tested the expression of sPLA2-IIA, including sPLA2-IIA mRNA, protein, as well as activity. We found that statins or IL-1\u03b2 increase the expression of sPLA2-IIA in VSMCs and the effect is based on a synergetic relationship between them. However, for the first time, we observed that XZK effectively reduces sPLA2-IIA expression in IL-1\u03b2-treated VSMCs.

Some of these effects such as those presented by anthracyclines, radiation therapy, cisplatin, as well as those presented by hormone therapy for breast cancer-usually taken for many years for some breast and prostate cancers-are long-lasting and associated with cardiovascular events risk more than 20\u2005years after cancer treatment. Cardiovascular testing, diagnostic assessment of suspected cardiovascular symptomatology, as well as laboratory tests for CVD risk factors are imperative. The early recognition and treatment of CVD processes that arise in survivorship years is pivotal, with specific attention to some CVD processes with specific suggested treatment modalities. Preventive measures include adequate screening, the use of medications such as ACE inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and/or beta blockers, statin therapy and aspirin in persons who warrant these medications, as well as therapeutic lifestyle modifications such as exercise/physical activity, weight loss and appropriate diet for a healthy lifestyle. Periodic follow-up with a good primary care physician who understands the risks associated with cancer therapy is important, and referral to onco-cardiology for further management of cardiovascular risk in these survivors is based on a patient's cardiovascular risk level and the type, amount and duration of cancer therapies received during the patient's lifetime.",

It is a common presenting symptom of severe narrowing of one or more coronary arteries, non-obstructive coronary arteries, or even when the coronary arteries are angiographically normal. Patients often avoid activities which precipitate symptoms and have impaired quality of life. Most patients with angina pectoris can be managed with lifestyle changes, especially abstinence from smoking and regular exercise, and anti-anginal drugs. However, the choice of initial or combination antianginals as recommended in the guidelines is not evidence based. In addition, patients with stable angina due to coronary artery disease should also receive aspirin and a statin. Treatment of patients with angina and normal coronary arteries remains to be established. The aim of this article is to provide the readers not only with a guideline-based approach, which varies from one country to another, but also an individual-based approach, which takes into consideration circulatory status and the presence or absence of comorbidities in the treatment decision-making process.

A single oral RC 20 mg dose, randomized, open-label, two-way crossover design study was conducted in 30 healthy Mediterranean Arab volunteers. Blood samples were collected prior to dosing and over a 72-h period. Concentrations in plasma were quantified using a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method. Twenty-six volunteers completed the study. Statistical comparison of the main PK parameters showed no significant difference between the generic and branded products.

The 90% confidence intervals were within the pre-defined limits of 80%-125% as specified by the Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency for bioequivalence studies. Both formulations were well-tolerated and no serious adverse events were reported. The PK results (AUC0\u2192last and Cmax) were close to those of the Caucasian subjects. This study showed that the test and reference products met the regulatory criteria for bioequivalence following a 20 mg oral dose of RC under fasting conditions. Both formulations also showed comparable safety results. The PK results of the test and reference in the study subjects fall within the acceptable interval of 80%-125% and they were very close to the results among Caucasians.

Attention to cardiac and arterial disease may slow deterioration of renal function. Management of risk factors can reduce these sequelae. Areas covered: Modifiable risk factors for arterial disease and relevant pharmacotherapies. Expert opinion: Cardiovascular disease is the biggest killer in renal failure. Statins are viewed as essential in symptomatic coronary disease and have been shown in non-renal patients to improve survival after myocardial infarction. Cochrane recommends statins in renal failure but not in end stage renal disease or transplant patients. Large well powered clinical trials focussed specifically on renal patients failed to demonstrate cardiovascular outcome or mortality benefits of statins when compared to placebo. Other lipid lowering pharmacotherapies are weaker and adverse effects may account for the absence of net clinical benefit in non-renal patients in published clinical trials. Patients should be started on a statin after myocardial infarction, regardless of lipid levels, but the risk of adverse effects in advanced renal failure with its comorbidities predicates employing only essential doses. Optimal antihypertensive and antithrombotic pharmacotherapy are also priorities.", 
    "132": "Parkinson's disease is characterized by accumulation of intraneuronal cytoplasmic inclusions, Lewy bodies, which mainly consist of aggregated \u03b1-synuclein. Controversies exist as to whether high blood cholesterol is a risk factor for the development of the disease and whether statin treatment could have a protective effect. Using a model system of BE(2)-M17 neuroblastoma cells treated with the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)), we found that MPP(+)-induced cell death was accompanied by cholesterol accumulation in a lysosomal-like pattern in pre-apoptotic cells. To study the effects of lysosomal cholesterol accumulation, we increased lysosomal cholesterol through pre-treatment with U18666A and found delayed leakage of lysosomal contents into the cytosol, which reduced cell death. This suggests that increased lysosomal cholesterol is a stress response mechanism to protect lysosomal membrane integrity in response to early apoptotic stress. However, high cholesterol also stimulated the accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein. Treatment with the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin reduced MPP(+)-induced cell death by inhibiting the production of reactive oxygen species, but did not prevent lysosomal cholesterol increase nor affect \u03b1-synuclein accumulation. Our study indicates a dual role of high cholesterol in Parkinson's disease, in which it acts both as a protector against lysosomal membrane permeabilization and as a stimulator of \u03b1-synuclein accumulation.",

The early phase of this decline in coronary heart disease and stroke was unexpected and controversial when first reported in the mid-1970s, having followed 60 years of gradual increase as the US population aged. However, in 1978, the participants in a conference convened by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute concluded that a significant recent downtick in coronary heart disease and stroke mortality rates had definitely occurred, at least in the US Since 1978, a sharp decline in mortality rates from coronary heart disease and stroke has become unmistakable throughout the industrialized world, with age-adjusted mortality rates having declined to about one third of their 1960s baseline by 2000. Models have shown that this remarkable decline has been fueled by rapid progress in both prevention and treatment, including precipitous declines in cigarette smoking, improvements in hypertension treatment and control, widespread use of statins to lower circulating cholesterol levels, and the development and timely use of thrombolysis and stents in acute coronary syndrome to limit or prevent infarction. However, despite the huge growth in knowledge and advances in prevention and treatment, there remain many questions about this decline. In fact, there is evidence that the rate of decline may have abated and may even be showing early signs of reversal in some population groups. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, through a request for information, is soliciting input that could inform a follow-up conference on or near the 40th anniversary of the original landmark conference to further explore these trends in cardiovascular mortality in the context of what has come before and what may lie ahead.",

The purpose of this study is to elucidate the role of hyperlipidaemia alone or in combination with acidosis/alkalosis in the development and potentiation of statin-induced myotoxicity. Statins association with plasma lipoproteins was examined under conditions of physiological and altered pH levels. The effect of this association on cellular uptake and myotoxicity of statins was also assessed at different pH levels using C2C12 cells that overexpress lipoprotein lipase. Lipophilic simvastatin displayed considerable association with the non-polar lipoprotein fractions (triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and low-density lipoprotein). This association contributed to increased cellular uptake of simvastatin by C2C12 cells through lipoprotein lipase-mediated process, resulting in enhanced muscle toxicity in hyperlipidaemic conditions. Furthermore, a combination of low pH environment (representing acidosis) and hyperlipidaemia increased the association of simvastatin with plasma lipoproteins causing potentiation of cellular uptake and myotoxicity of this drug. Comorbidities such as hyperlipidaemia, especially when coincident with acidosis, can enhance statin-associated muscle toxicity, and therefore require extra caution by prescribing clinicians. Hydrophilic rather than lipophilic statins could be a preferable choice in this patient population.",

Interestingly, their biosynthetic gene clusters were shown to reside in the common genetic neighborhood. Despite the genomic proximity of the underlying biosynthetic genes, the production of lovastatin and itaconic acid was shown to be favored by different factors, especially with respect to pH values of the broth.

Patients from the Centre hospitalier de l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al autoimmune myositis (AIM) Cohort with a pPM phenotype, response to immunosuppression, and follow-up \u22653 years were included. Of 17 consecutive patients with pPM, 14 patients had a NAM, of whom 12 were previously exposed to atorvastatin (mean 38.8 months). These 12 patients were therefore suspected of atorvastatin-induced AIM (atorAIM) and selected for study. All had aAbs to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, and none had overlap aAbs, aAbs to signal recognition particle, or cancer. Three stages of myopathy were recognized: stage 1 (isolated serum creatine kinase [CK] elevation), stage 2 (CK elevation, normal strength, and abnormal electromyogram [EMG]), and stage 3 (CK elevation, proximal weakness, and abnormal EMG). At diagnosis, 10/12 (83%) patients had stage 3 myopathy (mean CK elevation: 7247\u200aU/L). The presenting mode was stage 1 in 6 patients (50%) (mean CK elevation: 1540\u200aU/L), all of whom progressed to stage 3 (mean delay: 37 months) despite atorvastatin discontinuation. MAC deposition was observed in all muscle biopsies (isolated sarcolemmal deposition on non-necrotic fibers, isolated granular deposition on endomysial capillaries, or mixed pattern). Oral corticosteroids alone failed to normalize CKs and induce remission. Ten patients (83%) received intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) as part of an induction regimen. Of 10 patients with \u22651 year remission on stable maintenance therapy, IVIG was needed in 50%, either with methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy or combination immunosuppression. In the remaining patients, MTX monotherapy or combination therapy maintained remission without IVIG. AtorAIM emerged as the dominant entity in patients with a pPM phenotype and treatment-responsive myopathy. Isolated CK elevation was the mode of presentation of atorAIM. The new onset of isolated CK elevation on atorvastatin and persistent CK elevation on statin discontinuation should raise early suspicion for atorAIM. Statin-induced AIM should be included in the differential diagnosis of asymptomatic hyperCKemia. Three patterns of MAC deposition, while nonpathognomonic, were pathological clues to atorAIM. AtorAIM was uniformly corticosteroid resistant but responsive to IVIG as induction and maintenance therapy.",

Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, and CENTRAL were searched through July, 2016. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of ezetimibe combined with statins versus statins alone that followed patients for at least 6\u00a0months and reported on at least one of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular deaths, non-fatal myocardial infarctions (MI), and non-fatal strokes were included. Pairs of reviewers extracted study data and assessed risk of bias independently and in duplicate. Quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. We conducted a narrative review with complementary subgroup and sensitivity analyses. IMPROVE-IT study enrolled 93% of all patients enrolled in the 8 included trials. Our analysis of the IMPROVE-IT study results showed that in patients at high risk of cardiovascular events, ezetimibe added to statins was associated with i) a likely reduction in non-fatal MI (17 fewer/1000 treated over 6\u00a0years, moderate certainty in evidence); ii) a possible reduction in non-fatal stroke (6 fewer/1000 treated over 6\u00a0years, low certainty); iii) no impact on myopathy (moderate certainty); iv) potentially no impact on all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death (both moderate certainty); and v) possibly no impact on cancer (low certainty). Addition of ezetimibe to moderate-dose statins is likely to result in 17 fewer MIs and possibly 6 fewer strokes/1000 treated over 6\u00a0years but is unlikely to reduce all-cause mortality or cardiovascular death. Patients who place a high value on a small absolute reduction in MI and are not adverse to use of an additional medication over a long duration may opt for ezetimibe in addition to statin therapy. Our analysis revealed no increased specific harms associated with addition of ezetimibe to statins.",

Knowledge of this pathway has led scientists to investigate the role of statins in cancer prevention and treatment. Statins appear to possess a variety of pleiotropic effects, including inhibition of cell proliferation; enhanced apoptosis; and modulation of inflammation, endothelial function, and angiogenesis. In cancer specifically, experimental studies have found that statins may induce cancer cell apoptosis and inhibit tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. These mechanisms have steered researchers into evaluating the possible benefit of statins in the prevention and treatment of malignancies. This review will discuss the literature supporting the use of statins to prevent and treat cancer.",

In clinical studies, LCZ696 increased atorvastatin Cmax by 1.7-fold and area under the plasma concentration-time curve by 1.3-fold, but had little or no effect on simvastatin or simvastatin acid exposure. A physiologically based pharmacokinetics modeling approach was applied to explore the underlying mechanisms behind the statin-specific LCZ696 drug interaction observations. The model incorporated OATP-mediated clearance (CLint,T) for simvastatin and simvastatin acid to successfully describe the pharmacokinetic profiles of either analyte in the absence or presence of LCZ696. Moreover, the model successfully described the clinically observed drug effect with atorvastatin. The simulations clarified the critical parameters responsible for the observation of a low, yet clinically relevant, drug-drug interaction DDI between sacubitril and atorvastatin and the lack of effect with simvastatin acid. Atorvastatin is administered in its active form and rapidly achieves Cmax that coincide with the low Cmax of sacubitril. In contrast, simvastatin requires a hydrolysis step to the acid form and therefore is not present at the site of interactions at sacubitril concentrations that are inhibitory. Similar models were used to evaluate the drug-drug interaction risk for additional OATP-transported statins which predicted to maximally result in a 1.5-fold exposure increase.",

In this study, Drugbank 2.0 with 1280 old drugs were virtually screened by Glide according to the crystal structure of ligand-binding domain (LBP) of RXR\u03b1. 15 compounds selected were tested for their binding and transcriptional activity toward RXR\u03b1 by Biacore and reporter gene assay, respectively. The identified new scafford ligand of RXR\u03b1, Pitavastatin (1), was chemically optimized.

It is highly likely that the presence of efflux pumps may be one of the reasons for the weak activity of non-antibiotics, as in the case of some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), against Gram-negative rods. The activity of eight drugs of potential non-antibiotic activity, active substance standards, and relevant medicinal products were analysed with and without of efflux pump inhibitors against 180 strains of five Gram-negative rod species by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value determination in the presence of 1 mM MgSO\u2084. Furthermore, the influence of non-antibiotics on the susceptibility of clinical strains to quinolones with or without PA\u03b2N (Phe-Arg-\u03b2-naphthylamide) was investigated. The impacts of PA\u03b2N on the susceptibility of bacteria to non-antibiotics suggests that amitriptyline, alendronate, nicergoline, and ticlopidine are substrates of efflux pumps in Gram-negative rods. Amitriptyline/Amitriptylinum showed the highest direct antibacterial activity, with MICs ranging 100-800 mg/L against all studied species. Significant decreases in the MIC values of other active substances (acyclovir, atorvastatin, and famotidine) tested with pump inhibitors were not observed.

The evidence is strongest for statins. ACC/AHA, NICE, and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines recommend statin therapy based on patients' risk of an ASCVD event, rather than treating to specific lipid levels. For patients with no previous ASCVD event, risk calculators should be used to determine the 10-year risk of ASCVD. The ACC/AHA guideline recommends starting moderate- to high-intensity statins if the risk is 7.5% or greater, whereas the NICE and USPSTF guidelines recommend statins if the risk is 10% or greater. Patients with known ASCVD should receive high-intensity statins unless they fall into special categories (e.g., older age) or do not tolerate high-intensity statins, in which case moderate-intensity statins are appropriate. Liver transaminase levels should be checked before starting statins; guidelines vary on if and when to recheck them in the absence of symptoms. Lipid levels should be rechecked one to three months after starting statins, although guidelines differ on subsequent checks. Other lipid-lowering drugs (e.g., bile acid sequestrants, ezetimibe) can be considered if patients do not tolerate statins. Niacin should not be used. Some evidence supports adding ezetimibe to statin therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome or chronic kidney disease. The role of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors is unclear, but initial studies suggest a decrease in the rate of acute ASCVD events in patients with hypercholesterolemia.",

C57BL/6 mice that received high fat diet (HFD) for 22\u00a0weeks and a low dose of streptozotocin (STZ, 40\u00a0mg/kg) developed albuminuria and had increased urinary cystatin C excretion, and cilostazol treatment (13\u00a0weeks) improved these markers. Histopathological changes, including glomerular mesangial expansion, tubular vacuolization, apoptosis, and lipid accumulation were ameliorated by cilostazol treatment. Tubulointerstitial fibrosis that was indicated by the increases in collagen and transforming growth factor-\u03b21 subsided by cilostazol. Renoprotective effects were also observed in rosuvastatin-treated mice, and combinatorial treatment with cilostazol and rosuvastatin demonstrated enhanced ameliorative effects in histopathological evaluations. Notably, repressed renal heme oxygenase-1 (Ho-1) level in HFD/STZ mice was restored in cilostazol group. Further, we demonstrated that cilostazol enhanced Nrf2/Ho-1 signaling in cultured proximal tubular epithelial cells. Collectively, these results suggest the potential advantageous use of cilostazol as an adjunctive therapy with statins for the amelioration of metabolic disorder-associated renal injury.", 
    "200": "Statins present many beneficial effects in chronic liver disease, but concerns about safety exist. We evaluated the hepatic effects of a nitric oxide-releasing atorvastatin (NCX 6560) compared to conventional statins. Simvastatin, atorvastatin and NCX 6560 were evaluated in four-week bile duct-ligated rats (BDL) simulating decompensated cirrhosis and in thirteen-week carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) intoxicated rats, a model of early cirrhosis. In the BDL model, simvastatin treated rats showed high mortality and the remaining animals presented muscular and hepatic toxicity. At equivalent doses, NCX 6560 eliminated hepatic toxicity and reduced muscular toxicity (60-74%) caused by atorvastatin in the more advanced BDL model; toxicity was minimal in the CCl4 model. Atorvastatin and NCX 6560 similarly reduced portal pressure without changing systemic hemodynamics in both models. Atorvastatin and NCX 6560 caused a mild decrease in liver fibrosis and inflammation and a significant increase in intrahepatic cyclic guanosine monophosphate. NCX 6560 induced a higher intrahepatic vasoprotective profile (activated endothelial nitric oxide synthase and decreased platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1), especially in the CCl4 model, suggesting a higher benefit in early cirrhosis. In conclusion, NCX 6560 improves the liver profile and portal hypertension of cirrhotic rats similarly to conventional statins, but with a much better safety profile.",

The identification of PCSK9 as a key factor in the LDL clearance pathway has led to the development of new monoclonal antibodies. Here we critically review the economic evaluations published in Europe and focused on statins. We searched the PubMed database to select the studies published from July 2006 to June 2016 and finally selected 19 articles. Overall, the majority of studies were conducted from a third-party payer's viewpoint and recurred to modelling. Most studies were sponsored by industry and funding seemed to play a pivotal role in the study design. Patients resistant to LDL-C level reduction were considered only in a few studies. The place in therapy of the new class of biologic should be considered a kind of 'third line' for cholesterol-lowering, after patients have failed with restricted dietary regimens and then with current drug therapies. Otherwise they could result in hardly sustainable expenses even for developed countries.",

The significant reduction of LDL cholesterol of 50-60% and the very good tolerability and safety profile (at placebo level) are shown for both substances. The PCSK9 inhibitors are not as effective only in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. The first long-term data and one imaging study raise hope that the endpoint trials will show the expected reduction in cardiovascular events. Long-term trials have to show the long-term safety. In Germany it is legally regulated which patients can be treated by PCSK9 inhibitors and these prerequisites are largely in accordance with clinical practice.",
