By using the catalytic domain of house mouse HMG-CoA reductase, morelloflavone was found to inhibit the enzyme activity by competing with HMG-CoA whereas it was non-competitive towards NADPH. The inhibition constants (K(i)) with respect to HMG-CoA and NADPH were 80.87 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b5m and 103 \u00b1 0.07 \u00b5m, respectively. Both flavonoid subunits of this compound, naringenin and luteolin, equally competed with HMG-CoA with K(i) of 83.58 \u00b1 4.37 \u00b5m and 83.59 \u00b1 0.94 \u00b5m, respectively, and were also non-competitive with NADPH (K(i) of 182 \u00b1 0.67 \u00b5m and 188 \u00b1 0.14 \u00b5m, respectively). Due to these findings, we suggest that each subunit of morelloflavone would occupy the active site of the enzyme, thereby blocking access of its substrate. The present study thus demonstrates the ability of morelloflavone from G. dulcis to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase in vitro. As a result, this biflavonoid might serve as a new candidate for the future development of hypocholesterolemic agents.",

    "2": "Statin treatment results in substantially decreased incidence of cardiovascular events but the exact pathophysiological mechanism of their beneficial effect is yet unclear. We aimed to examine the effects of up-titrated doses of two widely used statins (atorvastatin (ATOR) and rosuvastatin (ROSU)) on parameters involved in lipoprotein metabolism, in patients with low high density lipoprotein cholesterol values (HDL-C).", 
    "3": "In this RADAR substudy, 80 patients, aged 40-80 years, with known cardiovascular disease and low HDL-C (<1.0 mmol/l), were randomized to receive, after an initial 6 week dietary run-in phase, either ATOR 20 mg (n = 41) or ROSU 10 mg (n = 39). The doses were up-titrated (in 6 week intervals) to 80 mg of ATOR or 40 mg of ROSU at 12 weeks. Serum lipoproteins and lipoprotein metabolism parameters were measured at baseline and at 6 and 18 weeks of follow up.", 
    "4": "Both statins significantly reduced total cholesterol (TChol) and non-HDL-C values with ROSU being more effective for the doses studied (p < 0.05). No statistically significant effect on HDL-C was observed for either statin. Apolipoproteins (apo) B, CI, CIII, AV and E were significantly reduced in both groups (p < 0.05), while the ratio of HDL particles containing both apoAI and apoAII (LpAI-AII) over HDL containing apoAI alone (LpAI) was changed for both statins with the decrease of LpAI being more prominent in the ATOR group (p = 0.028). Cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) mass and activity, phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) activity and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) mass and activity were all significantly reduced in both treatment groups over the follow-up period (p < 0.001). ATOR displayed a more prominent decrease of PLTP activity compared to ROSU (p = 0.043), while ROSU displayed a more prominent decrease of Lp-PLA2 activity compared to ATOR (p = 0.04). Both statins effectively reduced, in a dose-dependent way, high sensitivity C-reactive protein values over time, while no effect on the levels of circulating inter cellular adhesion molecule 1 (cICAM-1) was observed.", 
    "5": "The effects of statin treatment extend further and beyond a mere TChol and LDL cholesterol reduction, as demonstrated by the aforementioned alterations of lipoproteins, enzymes and lipid transfer proteins involved in lipoprotein metabolism and pro-atherogenic and inflammatory molecules. ROSU and ATOR displayed a similar pattern of effect on lipid metabolism with discrete differences in the magnitude of this effect in certain variables. Despite the limitations of small population size and lack of clinical end points, reported data provide an insight for the possible pathophysiological mechanisms implicated in the effect of increasing dosages of different statin treatments.", 
    "6": "Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases share many pathophysiological traits, often impact one another and share several risk factors, though not always to the same magnitude. Therefore, it is not surprising that many classes of cardiovascular drugs have demonstrated effectiveness in the primary prevention, acute treatment and secondary prevention of stroke. Important advances have been made since 2007 in the use of antiplatelets, anticoagulants, antihypertensives, antiarrhythmics and statins for the treatment of stroke. This review summarizes selected clinical trials of cardiovascular drugs completed from 2007 to 2010 that generated important evidence supporting the efficacy of these drugs in stroke treatment. Ongoing trials and preclinical research of promising agents and treatment strategies are also discussed.", 
    "7": "Although statin treatment leads consistently to a reduction in major adverse coronary events and death in clinical trials, approximately 60 to 70% residual risk of these outcomes still remains. One frontier of investigational drug research is treatment to increase HDL, the 'good cholesterol' that is associated with a reduced risk of coronary artery disease. HDL and its major protein apolipoprotein A-I (apoAI) are protective against atherosclerosis through several mechanisms, including the ability to mediate reverse cholesterol transport. This review focuses on the preclinical and clinical findings for two types of therapies for the treatment of atherosclerosis: apoAI-containing compounds and apoAI mimetic peptides. Both of these therapies have excellent potential to be useful clinically to promote atherosclerosis regression and stabilize existing plaques, but significant hurdles must be overcome in order to develop these approaches into safe and effective therapies.",

    "10": "48 rats were used throughout the experiment, which were divided into six groups, eight animals each as follows: normal control group (normal rats which fed with standard diet). After induction of hypercholesterolaemia by feeding rats with high cholesterol diet, the remaining rats were divided into five groups: group 1, hypercholesterolaemic control group (hypercholesterolaemic rats group); groups 2, 3 and 4, rats were given aqueous infusion of ginger (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg, respectively) orally; and group 5, rats were given atorvastatin (0.18 mg/kg) orally as a reference antihypercholesterolaemic drug. The blood was obtained from all groups of rats after being lightly anaesthetized with ether and the following lipid profile [serum total cholesterol (TC), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL-C and triglyceride levels] was measured at zero time and 2 and 4 weeks after ginger and atorvastatin treatment, and the risk ratio (TC/HDL-cholesterol) was assessed.",

    "12": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) represents the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Lifestyle modifications, along with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction, remain the highest priorities in CVD risk management. Among lipid-lowering agents, statins are most effective in LDL-C reduction and have demonstrated incremental benefits in CVD risk reduction. However, in light of the residual CVD risk, even after LDL-C targets are achieved, there is an unmet clinical need for additional measures. Fibrates are well known for their beneficial effects in triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and LDL-C subspecies modulation. Fenofibrate is the most commonly used fibric acid derivative, exerts beneficial effects in several lipid and nonlipid parameters, and is considered the most suitable fibrate to combine with a statin. However, in clinical practice this combination raises concerns about safety. ABT-335 (fenofibric acid, Trilipix) is the newest formulation designed to overcome the drawbacks of older fibrates, particularly in terms of pharmacokinetic properties. It has been extensively evaluated both as monotherapy and in combination with atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin in a large number of patients with mixed dyslipidemia for up to 2 years and appears to be a safe and effective option in the management of dyslipidemia.", 
    "13": "This study aimed to examine the effect of monocrotaline (MCT)-induced pulmonary hypertension on electrical field stimulation (EFS)-mediated relaxation in rings of rat main pulmonary artery and to see whether treatment with atorvastatin or L-arginine would prevent the action of MCT. Rats were killed 21 days after MCT injection (60 mg/kg), and the main pulmonary arteries were isolated. EFS (40 V, 0.2 milliseconds, 5 seconds, 10 Hz)-induced relaxations in vessels precontracted with phenylephrine (10(-6) to 3 \u00d7 10(-6) M) were abolished in MCT-injected group compared with control group. Treatment of MCT group with atorvastatin (10 mg/kg, orally) completely, whereas treatment with L-arginine (500 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) partially but significantly prevented the inhibition. Similarly, acetylcholine (10(-9) to 3 \u00d7 10(-5) M)-evoked relaxations that were markedly inhibited in MCT-group were also protected from inhibition after pretreatment with atorvastatin or L-arginine. Responses to endothelium-independent relaxants sodium nitroprusside (10(-9) to 10(-5) M), pinacidil (10(-10) to 10(-4) M), and papaverine (10(-8) to 10(-4) M) were unaltered in MCT-induced pulmonary hypertensive rats. The present findings suggest that MCT-induced pulmonary hypertension inhibits the EFS-mediated relaxation through suppression of endothelial NO production. Reversal of this inhibition by atorvastatin treatment presumably results from stimulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression. Relatively weak protection elicited by L-arginine might be secondary to impaired endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity caused by MCT-induced pulmonary hypertension.", 
    "14": "In the present study, we determined the therapeutic efficacy of atorvastatin on Coxsackievirus B3m (CVB3m)-induced myocarditis. Mice were administered Eagle minimal essential medium, virus solution, atorvastatin, or virus plus atorvastatin. Atorvastatin was given 3 days after viral challenge, and the treatment lasted for 14 days. On days 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 30 after virus inoculation (same days for the atorvastatin only group), echocardiograms were performed, and blood samples were collected for cardiac troponin I analysis. Myocardial inflammation, cell apoptosis, and Fas expression were detected by histology and immunohistochemistry. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and transmission electron microscopy revealed significant improvement of quantitative pathological features in the CVB3m-infected group treated with atorvastatin. Immunohistochemistry also showed a marked decrease in apoptosis of cardiac cells in the atorvastatin-treated group compared with infected animals without treatment. The differences in the values of cardiac troponin I between the atorvastatin treated and untreated virus-challenged mice were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting revealed that the virus induced marked increases in Fas messenger RNA and protein expression, which was reversed by atorvastatin. These results demonstrate that atorvastatin reduces the histological and functional severity of CVB3m-induced myocarditis and inhibits apoptosis and Fas expression in the myocardium of type B Coxsackie virus-infected mice.",

A total of 25 papers showing absolute lipid changes post-AMI were identified. The combined data demonstrated a mean fall in total cholesterol of 9% to 11% from baseline over days 3-14 post-AMI, whereas for triglycerides, there was a rise of 18% from baseline to between day 9 and 12 weeks.", 
    "18": "After a secondary analysis of SPACE ROCKET data and a comparison of previously published data, we report a 10% fall in total cholesterol after AMI-a difference that is of high clinical significance.

A subset of 308 patients who underwent two or more coronary angiograms at least 6 months apart were examined for net change in Gensini and Sullivan scores over time to determine the rate of CAD progression by genotype and were further classified as 'progressors' or 'non-progressors' based on absolute change per year in angiographic severity score. We replicated the association between the rs10757278 SNP and myocardial infarction and binary (presence/absence) angiographic classifications of CAD. Furthermore, we observed a significant additive association with this SNP, and both severity and extent of CAD using angiographic scores, after adjustment for age, gender, body mass index, traditional cardiovascular risk factors, myocardial infarction, and statin use (Gensini P = 0.016, Sullivan P = 0.005). In addition, there was a significant linear association with CAD progression before and after adjustment for covariates (Gensini P = 0.023, Sullivan P = 0.003) with homozygotes for the risk variant having three-fold greater odds of CAD progression compared with the referent group.",

Patients were converted to either pravastatin or rosuvastatin based on baseline simvastatin dose, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level, and renal function. The conversion protocol was developed to maintain LDL-C lowering with potentially safer statins. Follow-up lipid and aminotransferase values were collected as customary clinical markers of efficacy and safety, respectively, for patients converted per the protocol.

Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain statin-induced myopathy, including reduction of mevalonate pathway products, induction of apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and genetic predisposition. A decrease in coenzyme Q(10) (CoQ), a product of the mevalonate pathway, could contribute to statin induced myopathy.

Therefore the results of randomised clinical trials are not necessarily applicable to patients in clinical practice. This gap can be filled by prospective registries. Since the early nineties a number of prospective large registries in patients with STEMI have been performed in Germany. It could be shown that guideline adherent acute therapies and secondary prevention therapies were associated with an improvement in inhospital and mid-term outcomes. The benefit of guideline adherent therapy observed was especially high in patients with higher baseline risk. Registries are not able to replace randomised clinical trials, but can help to test if the results of these trials are comprehensible in clinical practice. Therefore prospective STEMI registries are an important part of clinical research to optimize therapies and improve outcome in patients with STEMI.",

The antifungal effects of statins revealed substantial differences. The synthetic statins proved to be more effective than the fungal metabolites. All investigated strains proved to be sensitive to fluvastatin.

However, recent clinical trials have demonstrated that there are numerous opportunities to improve stroke prevention strategies and also opportunities to effectively intervene in and treat acute strokes. For patients with diabetes and for those with prior strokes or transient ischemic attacks, it has become evident that aggressive low-density lipoprotein lowering with statin medications will decrease the risk for total and fatal strokes. Optimal anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy for primary and secondary stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation is being carefully defined. With numerous novel factor Xa and direct thrombin inhibitor drugs completing phase III clinical trials, it is likely that additional oral anticoagulant drugs will be clinically available for stroke prevention soon. Additionally, a major clinical trial is nearing completion that may resolve the role of carotid stenting and carotid endarterectomy in primary and secondary stroke prevention. There are recent notable advances in the acute treatment of stroke. It is likely that the time window for thrombolysis for appropriate patients with strokes will be increased from 3 to 4.5 h, permitting the inclusion of more patients in this treatment approach. There is ongoing investigation of intra-arterial thrombolysis and of acute intra-arterial thrombus extraction for treatment of selected patients with strokes.

Compared to patients not taking RAS inhibitors, patients who were taking RAS inhibitors had a lower peak troponin I level (79 vs 120 ng/dl, p = 0.016). Of the patients who had medically treated hypertension, those receiving RAS inhibitors had a significantly lower peak troponin I compared to those receiving non-RAS agents (79 vs 130 ng/dl, p = 0.015), despite equivalent blood pressure across the 2 groups. The beneficial effect of RAS inhibitor pretreatment remained when concomitant aspirin and statin use were controlled for. In conclusion, in patients presenting with a first STEMI, pretreatment with RAS inhibitors conferred a cardioprotective effect. The mechanism of this benefit appears to be independent of an effect on blood pressure control and was not wholly due to the effect of concomitant use of other medicines known to be protective in patients with STEMI.",

Statins have been shown to be beneficial beyond their cholesterol-lowering effects. These pleiotropic effects have been implicated in the protection against atrial fibrillation and the reduction in appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy in patients with coronary artery disease. This meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate whether statins were associated with a reduction in ventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients with coronary artery disease or nonischemic cardiomyopathy. The Medline and Cochrane databases were searched for studies in human subjects published in the English language between 1985 and February 2010. Studies were included in our analysis if they provided data regarding the association between the use of statins and the incidence of ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) in patients with coronary artery disease or nonischemic cardiomyopathy. The occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias was defined as the VT/VF occurrence or appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy for VT/VF. Of the 166 identified articles, nine prospective studies with 150,953 patients enrolled met our inclusion criteria and were included in this analysis. Using a random effects model, statin therapy was associated with a 31% reduction in the risk of VT/VF when compared with the group not on statin therapy (pooled relative risk = 0.69, 95% confidence interval, 0.58-0.83; heterogeneity I\u00b2 = 57.3%).

A multimodal intervention is required to afford renoprotection in overt diabetic nephropathy. Here we assessed the effects of maximal RAS inhibition by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor plus angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) in combination with statin in rats with overt diabetic nephropathy. Uninephrectomized rats made diabetic by streptozotocin were orally treated from 4 (when proteinuria and renal lesions had developed) to 8 mo with vehicle, lisinopril plus candesartan, lisinopril plus candesartan plus rosuvastatin, or rosuvastatin alone. Systolic blood pressure increased in diabetic rats and was significantly lowered by combined therapies. Dual RAS blockade significantly reduced proteinuria compared with vehicle. Addition of statin further lowered proteinuria to control levels. Glomerulosclerosis was ameliorated by RAS inhibitors or statin, and regression was achieved by the addition of statin. Loss of podocytes of diabetic rats was limited by ACE inhibitor plus ARB while normalized by the three drugs. Defective nephrin expression of diabetes was increased by dual RAS blockade or statin and restored by the triple therapy. Tubular damage, interstitial inflammation, and expression of the fibrotic markers transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 and phosphorylated Smad 2/3 in tubuli were significantly reduced by the triple regimen. These data suggest a strategy to target proteinuria to try to achieve regression of renal disease in diabetic patients who do not fully benefit from RAS inhibition alone.",

We also determined whether high-dose atorvastatin affected the inflammatory response of monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) ex vivo. We found that treatment with atorvastatin rapidly and significantly reduced plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in subjects treated for 2 weeks. However, statin treatment had no discernible effect on plasma levels of the inflammatory markers high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, or interleukin (IL-6) and no effect on the cytokine response of monocytes following ex vivo stimulation with LPS.

The aim of our study was to investigate whether atorvastatin inhibits HMGB1-induced vascular endothelial activation, and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism. In this study, we found that atorvastatin, at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10\u00a0\u03bcM, effectively and in a dose-dependent manner inhibited HMGB1-induced endothelial cells (ECs) activation. Incubation of ECs with 10\u00a0\u03bcM atorvastatin reduced adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and E-selectin) expression concomitant with a significant inhibition in HMGB1-stimulated leukocyte-endothelial adhesion. Further experiments showed that atorvastatin markedly suppressed HMGB1-induced Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression, Nuclear factor kappaB (NF-\u03baB) nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity in ECs. Similar effects were also observed in ECs pretreated with the TLR4- specific inhibitor CLI-095, suggesting an important role of TLR4/NF-\u03baB pathway. These findings indicate that atorvastatin attenuates HMGB1-induced vascular endothelial activation.

This study examined the effects of simvastatin and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions on histamine H1 receptors using [(3)H] pyrilamine binding autoradiography. Compared to the saline group, simvastatin (1 mg/kg/day) significantly decreased H1 receptor bindings in the primary motor cortex (M1), ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH), caudate putamen (CPu), accumbens core (AcbC) and prefrontal cortex (PfC) (all p<0.05); however 10 mg/kg/day simvastatin increased H1 receptor density only in the medial amygdaloid nucleus (Mep) (p<0.05), but had no significant effect in other regions examined. The 6-OHDA lesion did not alter H1 receptor binding density in most brain areas, except a trend decrease in the hippocampus (p=0.07) and a trend increase in the cingulate cortex (p=0.06). These results suggested that simvastatin has different effects on the H1 receptors in different rat brain regions depending on the doses. Therefore, simvastatin can modulate histaminergic neurotransmission in the brain, and support the role of H1 receptors in psychoneurological disorders.",

These cells expressed the CYP11B2 mRNA, a rate-limiting enzyme in the aldosterone biosynthesis. LDL and angiotensin II stimulated CYP11B2 mRNA expression in these cells, while a high concentration of glucose, angiotensin II and/or LDL increased aldosterone production. Importantly, atorvastatin (CAS 134523-03-8), an HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A) reductase inhibitor, strongly suppressed their effects on aldosterone production. Atorvastatin also suppressed positive effects of these compounds on the mRNA expression of the angiotensin II receptor type 1, thus atorvastatin exerted its negative effect in part through changing expression of this receptor. Since elevated levels of glucose and LDL, and increased action of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is known to participate in the progression of diabetic nephropathy, it is speculated that the mesangial endocrine system that produces aldosterone locally is a promising therapeutic target for diabetic nephropathy where HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors provide a beneficial effect.",

    "121": "we exposed guinea pigs to cigarette smoke for 6 months. In half the animals, simvastatin therapy was initiated after 3 months of smoke exposure. Pulmonary arterial systolic pressures were monitored weekly with a radiotelemetric catheter; additional physiologic and morphologic measurements were made at sacrifice after 6 months. Precision-cut lung explants were assessed for evidence of endothelial dysfunction, and in situ vascular nitric oxide generation was measured with 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate.", 
    "122": "cigarette smoke increased the pulmonary arterial systolic pressure after approximately 4 weeks. Simvastatin returned the pressure to control levels within 4 weeks of starting treatment, and ameliorated smoke-induced small arterial remodeling as well as emphysema measured both physiologically and morphometrically at 6 months, but did not prevent smoke-induced small airway remodeling either physiologically or morphologically. In precision-cut lung slices simvastatin reversed small arterial endothelial dysfunction, and partially reversed smoke-induced loss of vascular nitric oxide generation.", 
    "123": "simvastatin, as an intervention therapy, reverses the pulmonary vascular effects of cigarette smoke, including pulmonary hypertension, and prevents smoke-induced emphysema, but does not prevent small airway remodeling. This is the first demonstration that an intervention can reverse a COPD-associated cigarette smoke-induced anatomic abnormality. The study also shows the importance of examining all three anatomic lung compartments when assessing the effects of a potential drug intervention in patients with COPD.", 
    "124": "Leptin the cytokine-like hormone is involved not only in local inflammations, but it regulates cholesterol biosynthesis in human monocytes. Since, monocyte-membrane composition in obesity shows considerable difference from control cells, our aim was to elucidate the concentration dependence of the effect of leptin in OW monocytes, and the downstream signaling of high and low leptin concentrations. Control and OW monocytes were stimulated with leptin in the presence or absence of different inhibitors. Our results are as follows: a concentration-dependent biphasic effect could only be detected in control monocytes whereas in OW cells only elevated cholesterol synthesis was found. The signal pathway of 50 ng/mL leptin stimulation involves Ca(2+) signal, activation of PI3K, MAPK and HMG CoA reductase. In the 500 ng/mL leptin-stimulated control monocytes the suppression of cholesterol synthesis was dependent on the Ca(2+) signal, the H-7 sensitive cPKC and PI3K activation, whereas in OW monocytes only PI3K was involved in increased cholesterol synthesis. We conclude that leptin-signaling in OW monocytes is characterized by Ca(2+) influx, abrogation of H-7 sensitive cPKC activation, and by PI3K mediated PKC activation.",

PCOS represents a broad spectrum of endocrine and metabolic alterations which change with age and with increasing adiposity. In fact, during adolescence and youth the predominant clinical manifestations of PCOS are menstrual abnormalities, hirsutism and acne, whereas in peri-menopausal and post-menopausal periods metabolic disorders and an increased risk for cardiovascular diseases prevail. The pathogenetic links between PCOS and metabolic or cardiovascular complications are still debated. However, recent evidence has been focused on a condition of low-grade chronic inflammation as a potential cause of the long-term consequence of the syndrome. In this review we describe the state of low-grade inflammation observed in PCOS. In addition, we hypothesize the potential mechanisms responsible for the generation of this inflammatory state and the role played by low-grade inflammation in linking hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance with the metabolic and cardiovascular long-term complications of the syndrome.",

These statins phosphorylated Akt at Ser473 and subsequently led to increased expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), SIRT1, and catalase. Treatment with LY294002 or Akt short interfering RNA decreased the eNOS activation, SIRT1 expression, and antisenescent property of atorvastatin. Moreover, in streptozotocin-diabetic mice, administration of pitavastatin increased eNOS, SIRT1, and catalase expression and decreased endothelial senescence, but levels remained unaltered in Sirt1 knockout mice.",

This paper suggests the consideration of major changes in the existing management guidelines for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol management based on 2 fundamental principles: return the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level to the normal range and begin treatment closer to disease onset. These principles suggest the value of rethinking all 3 of the principal features of the Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol management: the initiation criteria, the use of variable targets, and the level of the treatment target. Because the principal issue surrounding guideline change is likely to be uncertainty concerning cost and toxicity, the text of new guidelines would have to completely satisfy this concern by strong emphasis on a prudent conservative approach to implementation and would include both cautionary data and caveats concerning the tradeoffs between the potency, cost, and toxicity of statins. The proposed changes in the guidelines, if combined with effective implementation, would likely lead to the displacement of atherosclerotic disease as the nation's number 1 killer. This review provides a logical rationale and discusses the pros and cons for each of the proposed changes.",

    "149": "The plasma concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP), the first acute-phase protein to be identified, increases dramatically following tissue injury or inflammation. Although the physiological role of CRP is still not fully known, it has been suggested that concentrations might increase as part of the acute-phase response for facilitating non-specific immune functions, defense against bacterial pathogens, clearance of apoptotic and necrotic cells to prevent immunization against autoantigens and acceleration of the repair process. In agreement with the evidence that inflammation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, CRP concentrations have been associated with cardiovascular disease, and measurement of CRP has therefore been proposed as a valuable aid to predict and stratify the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. Recently, some clinical and biological evidence in support of the hypothesis that CRP might be also involved in the onset of venous thrombosis have emerged. Native and monomeric CRP exert several prothrombotic activities, including activation of blood coagulation, impairment of the endogenous fibrinolytic capacity, and stimulation or enhancement of platelet adhesiveness and responsiveness. Epidemiological investigations have also shown that CRP concentrations are associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolism and, even more interestingly, that statins might be effective in reducing the risk of this pathology. Although there is increasing emphasis that CRP might not only be a marker but also an active player in the development of venous thrombosis, further evidence is needed to establish which event comes first--thrombosis or inflammation.",

All patients received pravastatin 10 mg/day for 6 months and the change in concentration of total and high molecular weight adiponectin was assessed before and after follow-up. The difference in the change in total adiponectin concentration by patient characteristics was analyzed by an unpaired t-test. Influences of continuous variable factors on the change in total adiponectin concentration were estimated by simple linear regression analyses.

Excessive production of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial dysfunction leading to apoptosis, accumulation and oligomerization of the protein alpha-synuclein, and defective protein disposal by the ubiquitin proteasome system are involved in the complex web of events mediating nigral cell demise. Two agents of current interest, coenzyme Q10 and creatine, may be disease modifying, and large studies are in progress.

These favorable pleiotropic effects may be the basis for their perioperative risk reduction in cardiothoracic and vascular procedures. The published evidence suggests that statins offer significant outcome benefits throughout perioperative practice. Because statin therapy significantly reduces the perioperative risk for patients undergoing cardiovascular procedures, they already are recommended in published guidelines. Beyond cardiac risk reduction, statin therapy also may protect the brain and the kidney in the perioperative setting, both in cardiac and vascular surgery. The pleiotropic effects of statins also appear to have therapeutic roles in the progression of valve disease, sepsis, and venous thrombosis. Further trials are required to provide data to drive their safe and comprehensive perioperative application for optimal patient outcome both in the short term and the long term. Because there are multiple randomized trials currently in progress throughout perioperative medicine, it is very likely that the indications for statins will be expanded significantly.",

Pitavastatin is the newest member in the statin family and received Food and Drug Administration approval for oral use in August 2009. Compared to other statins such as atorvastatin, simvastatin and pravastatin at specific doses, pitavastatin dosed at 1 to 4 mg daily showed similar efficacy in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and altering other lipid parameters according to a number of studies. In addition, pitavastatin demonstrated cholesterol-lowering efficacy in special populations such as the elderly, patients with diabetes, and patients with higher cardiovascular risk. Because pitavastatin is minimally metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes, it is associated with a lower frequency of drug-drug interactions, and this may be a desirable characteristic of pitavastatin. Beneficial effects, such as reductions of coronary plaque volume and fibrofatty composition, have also been observed with pitavastatin. Thus far, the safety profile of pitavastatin is favorable and appears to be similar to those of other statins. Given its encouraging pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, pitavastatin is likely to be a good alternative to other more established statins. The pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic properties of pitavastatin are reviewed in this article.",

However, the role of omega-3 fatty acids in reducing mortality, sudden death, arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and heart failure has not yet been established. This review will focus on the current clinical uses of fish oil and provide an update on their effects on triglycerides, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and arrhythmia.

    "169": "Several evidences suggest that cancer cells have abnormal cholesterol biosynthetic pathways and prenylation of small guanosine triphosphatase proteins. Tomato lycopene has been suggested to have beneficial effects against certain types of cancer, including that of prostate, although the exact molecular mechanism(s) is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that lycopene may exert its antitumor effects through changes in mevalonate pathway and in Ras activation. Incubation of the Ras-activated prostatic carcinoma LNCaP cells with a 24 h lycopene treatment (2.5-10 \u03bcM) dose dependently reduced intracellular total cholesterol by decreasing 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase expression and by inactivating Ras, as evidenced by its translocation from cell membranes to cytosol. Concomitantly, lycopene reduced the Ras-dependent activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB). Such a reduction was parallel to an inhibition of reactive oxygen species production and to a decrease in the phosphorylation ofc-jun N-terminal kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and p38. These effects were also accompanied by an arrest of cell cycle progression and by apoptosis induction, as evidenced by a decrease in cyclin D1 and phospho-AKT levels and by an increase in p21, p27 and p53 levels and in Bax:Bcl-2 ratio. The addition of mevalonate prevented the growth-inhibitory effects of lycopene as well as its increase in Ras cytoplasmatic accumulation and the subsequent changes in NF-\u03baB. The ability of lycopene in inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase expression and cell growth and in inactivating Ras was also found in prostate PC-3, colon HCT-116 and HT-29 and lung BEN cancer cells. These findings provide a novel mechanistic insight into the growth-inhibitory effects of lycopene in cancer.",

Lisinopril users had a 41% reduced incidence of advanced APs compared with the nonusers (odds ratio=0.59, P<0.001). A Mann-Whitney U test revealed that among lisinopril users, patients with advanced APs were on a lower dose of the medication compared with patients without advanced APs (mean dose=17.2 mg vs. 20.1 mg, respectively; P<0.001). Spearman correlation analyses indicated an inverse relationship between lisinopril dosage and number of polyps (P<0.001). There was also an inverse relationship between dosage and size of polyps (P<0.001); higher dosages of lisinopril were significantly associated with smaller size of polyps.

Furthermore, the risk decreased with the number of previous medications, and the use of 3 or more medications was associated with a multiply adjusted odds ratio of presenting with STEMI of 0.48 (99% confidence interval, 0.44-0.52) compared with no medications at admission.", 
    "183": "Use of aspirin, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, or statins before hospital admission in patients with a first acute MI is associated with substantially less risk of presenting with STEMI. The risk decreases with the increasing number of these medications used before acute MI, underlining the benefit of preventive medication in high-risk patients.", 
    "184": "The importance of cancer metabolism has been appreciated for many years, but the intricacies of how metabolic pathways interconnect with oncogenic signaling are not fully understood. With a clear understanding of how metabolism contributes to tumorigenesis, we will be better able to integrate the targeting of these fundamental biochemical pathways into patient care. The mevalonate (MVA) pathway, paced by its rate-limiting enzyme, hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), is required for the generation of several fundamental end-products including cholesterol and isoprenoids. Despite years of extensive research from the perspective of cardiovascular disease, the contribution of a dysregulated MVA pathway to human cancer remains largely unexplored. We address this issue directly by showing that dysregulation of the MVA pathway, achieved by ectopic expression of either full-length HMGCR or its novel splice variant, promotes transformation. Ectopic HMGCR accentuates growth of transformed and nontransformed cells under anchorage-independent conditions or as xenografts in immunocompromised mice and, importantly, cooperates with RAS to drive the transformation of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts cells. We further explore whether the MVA pathway may play a role in the etiology of human cancers and show that high mRNA levels of HMGCR and additional MVA pathway genes correlate with poor prognosis in a meta-analysis of six microarray datasets of primary breast cancer. Taken together, our results suggest that HMGCR is a candidate metabolic oncogene and provide a molecular rationale for further exploring the statin family of HMGCR inhibitors as anticancer agents.", 
    "185": "Macrophages are heterogeneous and include classically activated M1 and alternatively activated M2 macrophages, characterized by pro- and anti-inflammatory functions, respectively. Macrophages that express heme oxygenase-1 also exhibit anti-inflammatory effects. We assessed the anti-inflammatory effects of statin in experimental anti-glomerular basement membrane glomerulonephritis and in vitro, focusing on the macrophage heterogeneity. Rats were induced anti-glomerular basement membrane glomerulonephritis and treated with atorvastatin (20 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (control). Control rats showed infiltration of macrophages in the glomeruli at day 3 and developed crescentic glomerulonephritis by day 7, together with increased mRNA levels of the M1 macrophage-associated cytokines, interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-12. In contrast, statin reduced the level of proteinuria, reduced infiltration of macrophages in glomeruli with suppression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 expression, and inhibited the formation of necrotizing and crescentic lesions. The number of glomerular ED3-positive macrophages decreased with down-regulation of M1 macrophage-associated cytokines. Furthermore, statin augmented ED2-positive M2 macrophages with up-regulation of the M2 macrophage-associated chemokines and cytokines, chemokine (C-C motif) Iigand-17 and interleukin-10. Statin also increased the glomerular interleukin-10-expressing heme oxygenase-1-positive macrophages. Statin inhibited macrophage development, and suppressed ED3-positive macrophages, but augmented ED2-positive macrophages in M2-associated cytokine environment in vitro. We conclude that the anti-inflammatory effects of statin in glomerulonephritis are mediated through inhibition of macrophage infiltration as well as augmentation of anti-inflammatory macrophages.", 
    "186": "A possible neuroprotective role has been recently suggested for 3H3MGCoA reductase inhibitors (statins). Here, we sought to determine neuroprotective effect of statins in quinolinic acid induced neurotoxicity in rats. Rats were surgically administered quinolinic acid and treated with Atorvastatin (10, 20 mg/kg), simvastatin (15, 30 mg/kg) and fluvastatin (5, 10 mg/kg) once daily up to 3 weeks. Atorvastatin (10, 20 mg/kg), simvastatin (30 mg/kg) and fluvastatin (10 mg/kg) treatment significantly attenuated the quinolinic acid induced behavioral (locomotor activity, rotarod performance and beam walk test), biochemical (lipid peroxidation, nitrite concentration, SOD and catalase), mitochondrial enzyme complex alterations in rats suggesting their free radical scavenging potential. Additionally, atorvastatin (10, 20 mg/kg), simvastatin (30 mg/kg) and fluvastatin (10 mg/kg) significantly decrease the TNF-\u03b1 level and striatal lesion volume in quinolinic acid treated animals indicating their anti-inflammatory effects. In comparing the protective effect of different statins, atorvastatin is effective at both the doses while simvastatin and fluvastatins at respective lower doses were not able to produce the protective effect in quinolinic acid treated animals. These modulations can account, at least partly, for the beneficial effect of statins in our rodent model of striatal degeneration. Our findings show that statins could be explored as possible neuroprotective agents for neurodegenerative disorders such as HD.", 
    "187": "Differentiation-based therapeutics are an underutilized but a potentially significant treatment option for cancer patients. We show that lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of the rate-limiting enzyme of mevalonate synthesis HMG-CoA reductase, is able to induce tumour cell differentiation and apoptosis in vitro. We used embryonal carcinoma (EC) and neuroblastoma (NB) cell lines and found that lovastatin promoted apoptosis and induced expression of the neuronal differentiation markers, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and growth-associated protein 43. The apoptotic and differentiation responses were time and dose-dependant and rescued by the co-administration of mevalonate. The expression of TH is regulated primarily by a cyclic AMP (cAMP) response element (CRE) in its promoter. Lovastatin enhanced the expression of a CRE-driven luciferase construct in P19 cells. Furthermore, combining lovastatin with 1\u00a0mM dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate treatments induced higher expression from the CRE construct, enhanced differentiation and cytotoxicity. This study suggests the potential of combining these therapeutic approaches in EC and NB patients.",

The production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in cartilage and chondrocytes were analysed by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR and immunoassay. Cytokine-induced signalling pathway activation was studied by immunoblotting.", 
    "190": "Simvastatin and mevastatin significantly inhibited interleukin 1 (IL-1)+oncostatin M (OSM)-induced collagen degradation; this was accompanied with a marked decrease in collagenase and gelatinase activity from bovine nasal cartilage. The cholesterol pathway intermediate mevalonic acid reversed the simvastatin-mediated protection of cartilage degradation, and the expression and production of collagenase (MMP-1 and MMP-13) and gelatinase (MMP-2 and MMP-9). Statins also significantly decreased MMP-1 and MMP-13 expression in human articular cartilage and chondrocytes stimulated with IL-1+OSM, and blocked the activation of critical proinflammatory signalling pathways required for MMP expression. The loss of the isoprenoid intermediate geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate due to statin treatment accounted for the inhibition of MMP expression and signalling pathway activation.", 
    "191": "This study shows, for the first time, that lipophilic statins are able to block cartilage collagen breakdown induced by proinflammatory cytokines, by downregulating key cartilage-degrading enzymes. This demonstrates a possible therapeutic role for statins in acting as anti-inflammatory agents and in protecting cartilage from damage in joint diseases.", 
    "192": "Lifibrol is a potent lipid-lowering drug with an unknown mechanism of action. We investigated its effects on lipoprotein and sterol metabolism in normocholesterolemic male participants. Seven participants were treated for 4 weeks with 600 mg/d lifibrol and 9 with 40 mg/d pravastatin in a double-blind randomized parallel-group trial. Kinetic studies were performed at baseline and under acute and chronic treatment. Turnover of apolipoprotein B-100 was investigated with endogenous stable-isotope labeling, and kinetic parameters were derived by multicompartmental modeling. Lathosterol and cholesterol metabolism were investigated using mass isotopomer distribution analysis (MIDA) after [1-(13)C]acetate labeling. Carbon metabolism was investigated by calculating the total isotope incorporation into newly formed sterols and measuring the disposal of acetate by (13)CO(2) breath analysis. Total- and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol decreased by 18% and 27% under lifibrol and by 17% and 28% under pravastatin, respectively, whereas very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol did not change. Very-low-density lipoprotein apoB fractional synthesis and production increased under lifibrol but remained unchanged under pravastatin. Low-density lipoprotein apoB fractional synthesis and production increased under pravastatin but remained unchanged under lifibrol. Mass isotopomer distribution analysis indicated that both drugs decrease endogenous sterol synthesis after acute administration, but pravastatin had more powerful effects. Carbon-13 appearance in breath was higher during pravastatin than during lifibrol treatment. Mass isotopomer distribution analysis and carbon metabolism analysis indicated compartmentalization at the site of sterol synthesis, thus suggesting differential effects of the 2 drugs. Although having comparable lipid-lowering properties, lifibrol seems to have a mechanism of action distinct from that of statins. Lifibrol could serve as a model compound for the development of new lipid-lowering agents.",

    "197": "Statins are widely used to lower cholesterol levels by inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis. Some evidence has indicated that statins might have therapeutic and preventive benefits for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We and others also have shown the beneficial effect of statin treatment in reversing learning and memory deficits in animal models of AD. However, data from clinical trials are inconclusive. We previously documented that the adenovirus vector encoding 11 tandem repeats of A\u03b21-6 fused to the receptor-binding domain (Ia) of Pseudomonas exotoxin A, AdPEDI-(A\u03b21-6)(11), is effective in inducing an immune response against amyloid-\u03b2 protein (A\u03b2) and reducing brain A\u03b2 load in Alzheimer's mouse models. In the present study, we examined whether the administration of simvastatin can modulate immune and behavioral responses of C57BL/6 mice to vaccination. Simvastatin was given to the animals as a diet admixture for four weeks, followed by nasal vaccination with AdPEDI-(A\u03b21-6)(11) once per week for four weeks. The cholesterol-lowering action of simvastatin was monitored by measuring the cholesterol levels in plasma. Simvastatin significantly increased the number of the mice responding to vaccination compared with the mice receiving only AdPEDI-(A\u03b21-6)(11). Immunoglobulin isotyping revealed that the vaccination predominantly induced Th2 immune responses. Simvastatin treatment prevented A\u03b2-induced production of IFN-\u03b3 in splenocytes. The adenovirus vaccination altered mouse behavior in T- and elevated plus-maze tests and simvastatin counteracted such behavioral changes. Our results indicate that simvastatin clearly enhances the immune responses of C57BL/6 mice to the nasal vaccination with AdPEDI-(A\u03b21-6)(11). Simvastatin may be effective in preventing behavioral changes associated with vaccination.", 
    "198": "The cardiovascular risk reduction associated with different statins for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and the cardiovascular risk increase associated with excess dietary intake of fat have been quantified. However, these relative risks have never been directly juxtaposed to determine whether an increase in relative risk by 1 activity could be neutralized by an opposing change in relative risk from a second activity. The investigators compared the increase in relative risk for cardiovascular disease associated with the total fat and trans fat content of fast foods against the relative risk decrease provided by daily statin consumption from a meta-analysis of statins in primary prevention of coronary artery disease (7 randomized controlled trials including 42,848 patients). The risk reduction associated with the daily consumption of most statins, with the exception of pravastatin, is more powerful than the risk increase caused by the daily extra fat intake associated with a 7-oz hamburger (Quarter Pounder) with cheese and a small milkshake. In conclusion, statin therapy can neutralize the cardiovascular risk caused by harmful diet choices. In other spheres of human activity, individuals choosing risky pursuits (motorcycling, smoking, driving) are advised or compelled to use measures to minimize the risk (safety equipment, filters, seatbelts). Likewise, some individuals eat unhealthily. Routine accessibility of statins in establishments providing unhealthy food might be a rational modern means to offset the cardiovascular risk. Fast food outlets already offer free condiments to supplement meals. A free statin-containing accompaniment would offer cardiovascular benefits, opposite to the effects of equally available salt, sugar, and high-fat condiments. Although no substitute for systematic lifestyle improvements, including healthy diet, regular exercise, weight loss, and smoking cessation, complimentary statin packets would add, at little cost, 1 positive choice to a panoply of negative ones.", 
    "199": "Although cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) plays an important role in human lipoprotein metabolism, its relation to coronary artery disease remains controversial. The present study evaluated the relation between on-statin CETP mass and recurrent coronary events. The plasma CETP mass, measured after 4 months of statin therapy, was quantified in 3,218 patients enrolled in the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 22 (PROVE IT-TIMI 22) study. Of the 3,218 patients, 150 experienced the combined end point of recurrent myocardial infarction or death from coronary causes during a mean follow-up of 1.8 years. An increasing on-statin CETP mass was inversely related to the risk of coronary events in both unadjusted (hazard ratio [HR] per SD increase 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 0.92, p = 0.005) and fully adjusted (HR per SD increase 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.67 to 0.98, p = 0.027) analyses that included traditional cardiovascular risk factors. A similar trend was observed across increasing CETP mass quartiles (p trend = 0.07). A significant interaction between the CETP mass and on-treatment low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was noted (p interaction = 0.007). A CETP mass greater than the median was associated with a decreased risk in patients with LDL cholesterol less than the median of 80 mg/dl (HR 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.31 to 0.89, p = 0.02), but not in patients with LDL cholesterol greater than the median. In conclusion, an increasing on-statin CETP mass was inversely related to the coronary outcomes in this large clinical trial-based cohort, particularly among those with low LDL cholesterol levels. This finding is consistent with CETP facilitating reverse cholesterol transport in the setting of robust LDL clearance and might have important implications for efforts to optimally target patients with pharmacologic CETP inhibition.",
