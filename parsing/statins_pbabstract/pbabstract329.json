Diabetic individuals may receive greater benefit from statin treatment than non-diabetic individuals, because of a higher absolute risk. Available data are limited, although several randomized trials of primary prevention with diabetic patients are ongoing. The low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal is now considered to be < 100 mg/dl for individuals with diabetes. Pleiotropic effects of statins may be involved in anti-atherogenic or other actions of statin.", 
    "1": "Nebivolol, a selective beta1-lipophilic blocker, achieves blood pressure control by modulating nitric oxide release in addition to b-blockade. This dual mechanism of action could result in minimum interference with lipid metabolism compared to atenolol, a classic beta1-selective blocker. Hypertensive patients commonly exhibit lipid abnormalities and frequently require statins in combination with the anti-hypertensive therapy. We conducted this trial in order to clarify the effect on the metabolic profile of beta-blocker therapy with atenolol or nebivolol alone, or in conjunction with pravastatin. Thirty hypertensive hyperlipidemic men and women (total cholesterol >240 mg/dL [6.2 mmol/L], low-density lipoprotein cholesterol >190 mg/dL [4.9 mmol/L], triglycerides <500 mg/dL [5.6 mmol/L]) were separated in two groups. One group consisted of 15 subjects on atenolol therapy (50 mg daily), and the other group included 15 subjects on nebivolol therapy (5 mg daily). After 12 weeks of beta-blocker therapy, pravastatin (40 mg daily) was added in both groups for another 12 weeks. Atenolol significantly increased triglyceride levels by 19% (P=.05), while nebivolol showed a trend to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 8% (NS) and to decrease triglyceride levels by 5% (NS). Atenolol significantly increased lipoprotein(a) by 30% (P=.028). Fibrinogen levels were equally and not significantly decreased in both groups by 9% and 7%, respectively. Furthermore, atenolol and nebivolol decreased serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels by 14% (P=.05) and 15% (P=.05), respectively. On the other hand, both atenolol and nebivolol showed a trend to increase homocysteine levels (NS) by 13% and 11%, respectively. Although uric acid levels remained the same, atenolol significantly increased the fractional excretion of uric acid by 33% (P=.03). Following nebivolol administration, glucose levels remained the same, while insulin levels were reduced by 10% and the HOMA index (fasting glucose levels multiplied by fasting insulin levels and divided by 22.5) was reduced by 20% (P=.05). There were no significant differences between the two patient groups in the measured parameters after the administration of beta-blockers, except for triglycerides (P<.05) and the HOMA index (P=.05). The addition of pravastatin to all patients (n=30) decreased total cholesterol by 21% (P<.001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 28% (P<.001), apolipoprotein-B by 22% (P<.001), apolipoprotein-E by 15% (P=.014) and lipoprotein(a) levels by 12% (P=.023). Moreover, homocysteine levels and C-reactive protein were reduced by 17% (P=.05) and 43% (P=.05), respectively. We conclude that nebivolol seems to be a more appropriate therapy in hypertensive patients with hyperlipidemia and carbohydrate intolerance. Finally, the addition of pravastatin could further correct the well-established predictors of cardiovascular events.", 
    "2": "Atorvastatin is a synthetic inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. In placebo-controlled trials, it has been shown to achieve significant dose-dependent reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglycerides. This trial compared the efficacy of daily atorvastatin administration with that of alternate-day dosing.", 
    "3": "This was a randomized, prospective, nonblinded, controlled clinical trial. Fifty-four patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 100 to 200 mg/dL were enrolled. Baseline fasting lipid profile (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides), liver function tests (aspartate transaminase and alanine aminotransferase), and creatine kinase were drawn. Patients were randomized to three atorvastatin dose groups. Group I received 10 mg of atorvastatin every day, Group II received 10 mg every other day, and Group III received 20 mg every other day. After 6 weeks of treatment with atorvastatin, fasting lipid profiles, liver function tests, and creatine kinase concentrations were redrawn. Compliance to treatment was assessed at each visit.", 
    "4": "Of the 54 patients enrolled, 46 completed the study. All three regimens significantly reduced total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol compared to baseline. No statistically significant differences existed between the three groups in regards to total, or a percentage, decrease in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol at 6 weeks compared to baseline. All regimens were well tolerated and none of the patients had a significant elevation of liver enzymes or creatine kinase during the course of the study.", 
    "5": "Alternate-day dosing of atorvastatin is an efficacious and safe alternative to daily dosing.", 
    "6": "We previously reported that fluvastatin, a potent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, a strong lipid lowering drug, exerted an anti-atherosclerotic effect at doses insufficient to lower serum lipids in cholesterol fed rabbits. The evidence demonstrated that the superoxide anions from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase plays a critical role in several steps in the development of atherosclerosis. This study was designed to determine the effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on the production of the superoxide anions of NADPH oxidase in isolated rat peritoneal neutrophils. Fluvastatin (1-10 microM) decreased phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 10 nM)-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in a concentration-dependent manner. It also (10 microM) decreased PMA-dependent O(2) consumption of the rat neutrophils. These effects were reversed by the addition of mevalonate, a metabolite in the HMG-CoA reductase pathway. Treatment with pravastatin did not show any significant changes. Fluvastatin (10 microM) decreased ROS, such as hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anions generated by the Fenton reaction, and by the xanthine-xanthine oxidase system. Rats were treated with either fluvastatin (5 mg/kg per day, p.o.) or pravastatin (5 mg/kg per day, p.o.) for 1 week. Treatment with fluvastatin decreased the PMA-dependent ROS generation. The fluvastatin induced effect on the PMA-dependent ROS generation was reversed by the combined administration with 40 mg/kg mevalonate per day. The antioxidative effect of fluvastatin was thought to have caused not only the scavenging action of the radicals but also to have inhibited ROS generation by inhibiting the NADPH oxidase activity. This antioxidative potential of fluvastatin via the inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity may be profitable in preventing atherosclerosis.", 
    "7": "Lowering serum total cholesterol is shown to decrease the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in Western countries,but evidence is limited regarding cerebral infarction (CI). The present study used the Kyushu Lipid Intervention Study to examine the risks of CHD events and CI in relation to reduction in serum total cholesterol. Subjects were 4,615 men aged 45-74 years with serum total cholesterol of 220 mg/dl (5.68 mmol/L) or greater who had no history of CHD events or stroke. CHD events and CI numbered 125 and 92, respectively, in a 5-year follow-up. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, the relative risks of CHD events and CI for 15% or greater reduction in total cholesterol, compared with less than 5% reduction, were 0.78 (95% confidence limit [CL]0.46-1.32) and 0.39 (95% CL 0.22-0.69), respectively. As compared with on-treatment cholesterol levels of 240 mg/dl (6.20 mmol/L)or higher, the risk of CHD events was approximately 50% lower across 3 categories below 240 mg/dl (6.20 mmol/L), and that of CI was 70%lower at 2 categories below 220 mg/dl (5.68 mmol/L). Lowering serum total cholesterol below 220 mg/dl (5.68 mmol/L) seems desirable with regard to the prevention of CI.", 
    "8": "Several clinical and epidemiological studies have demonstrated that a high level of plasma fibrinogen is an independent risk factor for coronary, cerebral and peripheral artery disease. The role of fibrinogen in cardiovascular diseases is mainly due to thrombotic complications in advanced stages of the atherothrombotic disease. However, fibrinogen also plays an active role in the initiation and development of atheromatous plaques. The relations between fibrinogen and ischemic cardiopathies, other vasculopathies and diabetes mellitus are discussed. The controversial effects of statins on fibrinogen are also described.", 
    "9": "Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) is a vasodilator peptide. In addition, PTHrP appears to affect vascular growth and to be a mediator of inflammation in rheumatic and brain disorders. We examined the possible role of PTHrP in the inflammatory process in atherosclerosis", 
    "10": "We immunohistochemically analyzed the cellular localization of PTHrP, the type 1 PTH/PTHrP receptor (PTH1R), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in 26 human carotid atherosclerotic plaques.", 
    "11": "The inflammatory region of plaques was characterized by high PTHrP, PTH1R, and MCP-1 immunostaining in relation to the cap (0.75+/-0.1 versus 0.29+/-0.04, 0.5+/-0.1 versus 0.25+/-0.05, 0.72+/-0.2 versus 0.29+/-0.05, respectively; P<0.05). PTHrP and MCP-1 were colocalized in both resident and inflammatory cells in the plaque. Moreover, in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), PTHrP(1-36) increased MCP-1 mRNA (3-fold at 6 hours) and MCP-1 protein (2.5-fold at 24 hours). This effect was inhibited by either PTHrP(7-34) or various protein kinase A inhibitors and by the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) inhibitor parthenolide. Furthermore, PTHrP(1-36) elicited an increase in NF-kappaB activation in VSMC. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor simvastatin inhibited the PTHrP(1-36) induction of both NF-kappaB activity and MCP-1 overexpression, and this was reversed by mevalonate.",

    "14": "We identified functional promoter polymorphisms and examined their effects in a cohort with and without CAAD. We used the full sequences in 23 white subjects to determine the linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure of the PON1 region and to direct the grouping of haplotypes for disease association testing. There are several discrete regions of the PON1 gene with strong local LD, but the useful levels of LD do not extend across the entire gene. Indeed, PON1-162/-108/55/192 haplotype did not predict additional variation in PON1 activities compared with the 4 genotypes separately. PON1 hydrolysis activity predicted CAAD status, but this was not attributable to the promoter or coding region polymorphisms or haplotype or to the effects of smoking or statin use on PON1 activity.", 
    "15": "PON1 does not have LD across the gene, and use of haplotypes in association studies should consider the LD structure. PON1 activity predicts CAAD, yet 4 functional polymorphisms do not. Additional investigations of genetic and environmental factors that influence PON1 activity as a risk factor for vascular disease are warranted.", 
    "16": "The Cardiovascular Risk Identification and Treatment Center was established in 1997, adopting a collaborative-care clinic model for the purpose of improving the management of high-risk patients with dyslipidemia. This was a retrospective analysis of 417 high-risk patients with > or =1 year of follow-up laboratory data. Analysis included changes in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), non-HDL, triglycerides, and total cholesterol to HDL ratio; lipoprotein goal achievement; Framingham risk score; liver function; and cardiovascular events. At baseline, 66% of patients had coronary heart disease (CHD) or equivalent risk, 45% were not receiving dyslipidemia therapy, and 29% were on statin monotherapy. After 3 years in the program, 56% were receiving combination therapy, 41% were on monotherapy, and 2% were not on therapy. The 3 most common treatment regimens were statin plus niacin (36%), statin alone (22%), and niacin alone (14%). All lipoproteins improved from baseline (p <0.001). Overall, 62% to 74% of patients reached singular lipid goals and 35% achieved combined lipid goals. Patients with Framingham 10-year CHD risk of >20% were reduced from 6% to <1%. Only 29 patients (7.0%) had a cardiovascular event, including 5 (1.0%) who experienced a myocardial infarction. Aspartate aminotransferase/alanine transferase elevation >3 times normal occurred in 1% of patients. In conclusion, a collaborative-care practice model adopting individualized, aggressive pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment strategies is highly effective in achieving lipid goals, is sustainable, and is safe. Furthermore, this approach yields reduced projected 10-year CHD risk. A low rate of cardiovascular events was observed.", 
    "17": "The major juvenile hormone (JH) homolog synthesized in vitro by the adult female Medfly (Ceratitis capitata) corpus allatum (CA) is JHB(3), with JH-III the minor homolog. Methyl-incorporation in vitro in post-eclosion virgin females is age-dependent. Basal activity occurs during the first four days post-eclosion and increases significantly thereafter, peaking at five days. Biosynthetic maturation of the mated female CA is delayed by one day and reduced considerably. The delayed response may be due to direct cerebral or neural inhibition. Synthetic Drosophila melanogaster sex peptide depresses JH biosynthesis by the Medfly female CA in vitro. Male-derived accessory gland peptides of the Medfly are transferred to the female during mating and a Medfly SP-analog may be responsible for down-regulation of JH synthesis by the CA in mated Medfly females. Mevinolin, an inhibitor of the mevalonate pathway, significantly reduces the biosynthesis of JHB(3), while farnesoic acid, a proximate precursor of JHIII, significantly stimulates the biosynthesis of both JHB(3) and JHIII in vitro.", 
    "18": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, more commonly known as statins, are a class of drug widely used for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia in patients with established cardiovascular disease as well as those at high risk of developing atherosclerosis. Their predominant action is to reduce circulating levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol; to a smaller degree, they also increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and reduce triglyceride concentrations. In recent years, however, there has been an increasing body of evidence that their effects on lipid profile cannot fully account for their cardiovascular protective actions: their beneficial effects are too rapid to be easily explained by their relatively slow effects on atherogenesis and too large to be accounted for by their relatively small effects on plaque regression. Experimental models have revealed that statins exert a variety of other cardiovascular effects, which would be predicted to be of clinical benefit: they possess anti-inflammatory properties, as evidenced by their ability to reduce the accumulation of inflammatory cells in atherosclerotic plaques; they inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, a key event in atherogenesis; they inhibit platelet function, thereby limiting both atherosclerosis and superadded thrombosis; and they improve vascular endothelial function, largely through augmentation of nitric oxide (NO) generation. The relative importance of the lipid- and non-lipid-related effects of the statins in the clinical situation remains the subject of much continuing research.", 
    "19": "Cardiovascular disease is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Cholesterol-lowering statins can reduce health risks both in men and women. While this benefit has thus far been attributed to the lipid-lowering effects of these drugs, the importance of their direct actions on vascular tissue is gaining more recognition. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that statins might also be effective in preventing osteoporosis and Alzheimer's disease. Equally interesting are experimental results showing that statins may inhibit growth of certain malignancies such as the breast. When statins are combined with hormone replacement therapy (HRT), even greater beneficial effects on the lipid profile can be obtained. To our knowledge we have investigated for the first time direct vascular effects by combining statins with HRT. We were able to identify significant beneficial effects on endothelial function and vascular smooth muscle proliferation. In the context of current discussions on the benefits and risks of HRT in treating patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, it appears particularly important that interventional studies should be conducted to evaluate the therapeutic relevance of statin/HRT combinations. At present, this is the most important conclusion drawn from the data collected thus far on the combination of these two drug types. There is some evidence suggesting drug-specific effects, particularly adverse reactions and statin interactions, which should be considered when using this combination therapy.", 
    "20": "Coenzyme Q(10) (CoQ(10)) is the predominant form of ubiquinone in man. CoQ(10) functions as an electron carrier in the mitochondrial respiratory chain as well as serving as an important intracellular antioxidant. Lowered blood and tissue concentrations of CoQ(10) have been reported in a number of diseases, although whether this deficiency is the cause or an effect of the disease remains largely unresolved. Some studies have reported lowered plasma CoQ(10) concentrations after statin drug treatment of hypercholesterolaemic patients. However, a deficiency in CoQ(10) status has yet to be demonstrated in patients experiencing the rare myotoxic side-effects of these drugs. Most clinical investigations assessing the therapeutic potential of CoQ(10) have focused on cardiovascular disease, specifically congestive heart failure. Although a number of studies have reported clinical improvement in congestive heart failure patients after CoQ(10) supplementation to standard therapy, concerns about the design of these studies coupled to the small number of patients involved have limited their acceptance. Assessment of CoQ(10) status is generally based on plasma measurements. As plasma concentrations are influenced by a number of physiological factors and may not represent cellular concentrations, platelets, lymphocytes and fibroblasts may provide suitable alternatives for these measurements.", 
    "21": "Elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) are considered to be one of the indicators of poor prognosis in coronary artery disease (CAD). The aim of this study was to evaluate anti-inflammatory effects of atorvastatin in patients with CAD by measuring serum CRP levels.", 
    "22": "After measuring the baseline levels of CRP and lipid fractions, the patients were divided into two groups. In Group A (n = 46), atorvastatin (20 mg/day) was administered in addition to classic antianginal treatment (beta-blocker, nitrate and aspirin). In Group B (n = 32), the usual antianginal treatment was continued. Following 4 weeks of treatment the same measurements were repeated.", 
    "23": "In Group A, CRP decreased from 20.3 mg/dl (95% CI, 9-31.8) to 10.8 mg/dl (95% CI, 2.7-18.9) (p < 0.001). In Group B, CRP decreased from 17 mg/dl (95% CI, 13.1-21) to 12.8 mg/dl (95% CI, 9.7-15.9) (p < 0.01). The decrease in group A was more than in group B (p = 0.003).",

    "25": "Because of the potential for large variability among countries in the utilization and cost of health care resources, it is important to assess the appropriateness of combining economic data across the countries in a multinational clinical economic trial. We show how available tests for interaction can be applied to economic endpoints, including cost-effectiveness ratios and net health benefits. This analysis includes a characterization of possible interactions being quantitative or qualitative in nature. In the absence of interaction, a pooled estimate of the economic endpoint should be representative of the participating countries. We explore the analytic issues by further analysing data from the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S).",

(controlled release tablets) or placebo for 6 months. Patients with inflammatory/neoplastic disorders or elevated values of C-reactive protein were excluded from analysis. A rheological profile (plasma viscosity, blood viscosity, aggregation and flexibility of erythrocytes, filtrability of leukocytes, fibrinogen levels) was done initially and after 6 months. Adverse cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary/peripheral revascularization) were recorded during 12 months. Furthermore, the impact of rheological parameters regarding the occurrence of severe cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, stroke) was evaluated during a follow-up of median 38 months.", 
    "28": "The data of 137 patients (n = 71 placebo, n = 66 molsidomine) were analysed. The difference of rheological parameters between the two measurements did not vary between the two groups. Analysis of event-free survival with Kaplan-Meier technique revealed no difference between the two groups. Multivariate Cox regression analysis with adjustment for diabetes mellitus, smoking and therapy with statin showed a significant association of fibrinogen and plasma viscosity with the occurrence of severe cardiovascular events.", 
    "29": "Treatment with molsidomine 3 x 8 mg/day for 6 months does not improve blood rheology or reduce cardiovascular events. But elevated levels of fibrinogen and plasma viscosity were associated with the occurrence of severe cardiovascular events.", 
    "30": "The effect of xuezhikang on postprandial triglyceride (TG) level was investigated in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) after a high-fat meal (800 cal; 50 g fat). Fifty CHD patients were randomly divided into two groups to accept xuezhikang (xuezhikang group) 1200 mg/day (600 mg twice daily) or not (control group) on the base of routine therapy which included aspirin, metoprolol and fosinopril and nitrates during the whole 6 weeks following-up. Xuezhikang significantly reduced fasting serum total cholesterol (TC) (-20%), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, -34%), TG (-32%) and apoB (-27%) levels, and raised fasting high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C, 18%) and apoA-I (13%) levels (P<0.001). The postprandial serum TG levels at 2, 4 and 6 h decreased 32, 38 and 43%, respectively, in xuezhikang group (P<0.001). The TG area under the curve over the fasting TG level (TG-AUC) significantly decreased in CHD patients accepted xuezhikang with normal (less than 1.7 mmol/l) and elevated (1.74 to 2.92 mmol/l) fasting TG levels by 45 and 50%, respectively (P<0.001). Routine therapy had no significant effect on the fasting and postprandial lipid and apolipoprotein levels. The change of TG-AUC was significantly related to the changes of fasting TG, TC, LDL-C, and HDL-C levels after the treatment, which were related to the changes of fasting apoA-I and apoB levels significantly (P<0.001). Xuezhikang was shown to be beneficial in the treatment of reflecting postprandial triglyceridemia in CHD patients with normal and mildly elevated fasting TG levels.", 
    "31": "Remnant lipoproteins are known to promote atherosclerosis especially in patients with type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP). In the current study, the effects of atorvastatin were investigated with special reference to the exogenous and endogenous apolipoprotein (apo) B-containing lipoprotein metabolism in type III HLP. Four Japanese male patients with type III HLP associated with homozygous apoE2 were studied. One-month administration of atorvastatin (20 mg once daily), after a 4-week dietary run-in, strikingly reduced serum total cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) levels by 52 (P<0.01) and 56% (P<0.05), respectively. Atorvastatin further decreased remnant-like particle (RLP)-cholesterol by 73% and RLP-TG by 65% (P<0.05), respectively. Distribution analysis by polyacrylamide gel disc electrophoresis clearly showed that atorvastatin diminished very low-, intermediate- and low-density lipoprotein particles. The relative particle diameter of intermediate-density lipoprotein became smaller after atorvastatin treatment (P<0.01). Furthermore, ultracentrifugal analysis demonstrated that atorvastatin significantly decreased cholesterol, TG and phospholipid concentrations in all apoB-containing lipoprotein fractions and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-cholesterol/serum TG ratio (P<0.05), implying atorvastatin-induced reduction of beta-VLDL. Finally, newly developed assays of apoB-48 and apoB-100 revealed that atorvastatin markedly reduced these apolipoproteins by 43 and 52%, respectively (P<0.01), suggesting that atorvastatin decreased the number of both exogenous and endogenous apoB-containing lipoproteins. Taken together, atorvastatin improves remnant lipoprotein metabolism in type III HLP both in quality and in quantity. Atorvastatin can be one of the optimal options for the treatment of patients with type III HLP.", 
    "32": "We assumed that assaying serum cholesterol precursors (synthesis markers) and plant sterols and cholestanol (absorption markers of cholesterol) reveals differences in cholesterol synthesis and absorption in the Finnish 4S subgroup divided in high triglyceride-low HDL cholesterol (lipid triad=HTG) and isolated high LDL cholesterol (ILDL) groups. Serum squalene and non-cholesterol sterol ratios to cholesterol were measured with gas-liquid chromatography at baseline, 6 weeks, 1 year, and 5 years on simvastatin. Patients with HTG (n=135) exhibited features of metabolic syndrome and, in spite of similar serum total and LDL cholesterol levels, ratios of synthesis markers were higher and those of absorption markers lower than in ILDL (n=133). The latter patients accumulated to a subgroup shown earlier to be clinical non-responders to simvastatin in 4S. Serum cholesterol reduction by simvastatin only tended to be higher in HTG than ILDL. The synthesis marker ratios were markedly reduced, and more effectively in HTG than ILDL, while the absorption marker ratios were increased, and for plant sterols more in ILDL than HTG. In conclusion, HTG is associated with high synthesis and low absorption of cholesterol, these events being opposite in ILDL. Synthesis is more effectively reduced by simvastatin in HTG than ILDL in spite of similar reduction in serum cholesterol. Patients defined by highest baseline absorption marker ratios in ILDL group are poor coronary event-reducers on regular simvastatin treatment.", 
    "33": "Statins decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, essentially, by reducing LDL-cholesterol levels and, additionally, by increasing HDL-cholesterol concentrations. Environmental and genetic factors are known to affect LDL-C response to statins but less is known regarding HDL-C. We have evaluated the lipid and lipoprotein response to 20 mg/day of pravastatin for 16 weeks in relation to the G/A polymorphism in the promoter region of the apo A-I gene in 397 hypercholesterolaemic subjects followed-up on an out-patient basis. In the study population, 61.7% were homozygous for the G allele and 36% were heterozygous. The A allele carriers had an HDL-C 6.5% higher than the G allele homozygotes (P=0.021 in univariate analysis; P=0.009 in multivariate analysis). However, on segregation by gender and smoking status the effect was significant only in non-smoking males. The A allele carriers did not increase their HDL-C concentrations after treatment (-0.3, 95%CI -3.3 to 2.7%) while G allele homozygotes had a 4.9% increase (95%CI 2.5-7.3%). Differences in the response between both groups were significant before (P=0.008) and after adjustment for confounding variables such as age and baseline HDL-C concentration (P=0.046). We conclude that the G/A polymorphism of the apo A-I promoter region affects not only baseline HDL-C concentrations but also its response to pravastatin treatment.", 
    "34": "It has recently been reported that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) stimulate bone formation. However, the mechanism of stimulation of bone metabolism by statins is not precisely clarified. In this study, we investigated whether simvastatin induces heat shock protein (HSP) 27, HSP70, and HSP90 in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells. Simvastatin increased the levels of HSP27 while having little effect on the levels of HSP70 or HSP90. The effect of simvastatin on HSP27 accumulation was dose dependent. Cycloheximide reduced the accumulation. Simvastatin induced an increase in the levels of mRNA for HSP27. Actinomycin D suppressed the mRNA levels. Simvastatin induced the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase among the MAP kinase superfamily. SB203580 and PD169316, inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase, suppressed the HSP27 accumulation by simvastatin while SB202474, a negative control of p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, had no effect. SB203580 reduced the simvastatin-increased mRNA levels for HSP27. Lovastatin, another statin, also induced the HSP27 accumulation and SB203580 suppressed the HSP27 accumulation. These results strongly suggest that statins such as simvastatin do not stimulate the induction of HSP70 and HSP90, but do stimulate the induction of HSP27 in osteoblasts and that p38 MAP kinase plays a role in this induction.", 
    "35": "Cardiovascular (CV) complications are by far the most prevalent in patients with type 2 diabetes and the principal cause of mortality. Renal complications of type 1 diabetes were the principal cause of death. However, with the advent of dialysis and renal transplantation and because of further increases caused by such management techniques on the already accelerated atherosclerosis of type 1 diabetes patients, CV complications have now become the principal cause of morbidity and mortality. For successful prevention of CV complications in diabetes, clinicians should therefore pay particular attention to the means of attaining goals for the management of established traditional as well as nontraditional CV risk factors. For the most part, such management has been proven to reduce CV events in patients with diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes.", 
    "36": "Fatty acids are an important source of energy which can have an influence on serum lipids. Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, both polyunsaturated fatty acids, have been advocated as replacement for saturated fat. Omega-3 fatty acids, derived from fish and certain green plants, lower serum triglycerides, but they have also been shown to have a direct effect on myocardial contractility, blood pressure, platelet function, coagulation factors, cell-mediated immunity and markers of inflammation. Recently available clinical trial data, including those using the concentrated omega-3 fatty acid preparation Omacor, indicate that omega-3 fatty acids are valuable in preventing sudden death following myocardial infarction. Studies indicate that omega-3 fatty acids are just as effective as, or have a benefit superior to, statins in secondary prevention. Omacor is also useful in the treatment of hypertriglyceridaemia, both as monotherapy and in combination with statins.",

The EPHESUS trial suggests a much wider role for aldosterone antagonists for the management of heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. SPORTIF-III indicates we may have a safer, simpler warfarin substitute soon. ASCOT reinforces the potential futility of statin therapy unless it is well targeted. The results of the COMPANION study investigating cardiac resynchronisation devices and implantable defibrillators were encouraging but inconclusive and/or hard to interpret. UK-PACE again questions the use of dual chamber pacing. T-wave alternans is an interesting experimental technique that may be useful in selecting which patients need an implantable defibrillator, although the technology needs testing in an appropriate patient population.",

    "39": "Polymorphisms of the CETP gene influence CETP activity and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration and might affect the long-term prognosis and response to statin therapy in patients with CAD.", 
    "40": "We used serum samples and deoxyribonucleic acid collected at baseline from a prospective cohort of 1,211 patients with CAD prospectively followed up (median follow-up of 4.1 years), 82 of whom experienced a fatal cardiovascular event. The CETP/C-629A and I405V polymorphisms, CETP activity, and HDL cholesterol were determined.", 
    "41": "Patients carrying the -629A allele had significantly lower CETP activity and higher HDL cholesterol levels. There was a significant association between this polymorphism and the risk of future cardiovascular death. Mortality decreased from 10.8% in CC homozygotes to 4.6% in CA heterozygotes and 4.0% in AA homozygotes (p < 0.0001). This association was independent of potential confounders, particularly HDL cholesterol and CETP activity levels. The clinical benefit of statin therapy was restricted to CC homozygotes, in whom cardiovascular mortality was divided by half (p = 0.01 for treatment x genotype interaction). Similar trends were observed with the CETP/I405V polymorphism, but these effects seemed to be mainly the consequence of linkage disequilibrium with the CETP/C-629A polymorphism.", 
    "42": "In patients with CAD, the CETP/-629A allele had a strong protective effect on future mortality from cardiovascular causes, independent of its role on HDL cholesterol and CETP activity levels. Additionally, this common polymorphism appeared to predict which patients with CAD will experience a survival benefit from statin therapy.", 
    "43": "Proteoheparan sulfate can be adsorbed onto a methylated silica surface in a monomolecular layer via its transmembrane hydrophobic protein core domain. Due to electrostatic repulsion, its anionic glycosaminoglycan side chains are stretched out into the blood substitute solution, thereby representing a receptor site for specific lipoprotein binding through basic amino acid-rich residues within their apolipoproteins. The binding process was studied by ellipsometric techniques suggesting that HDL has a high binding affinity and a protective effect on interfacial heparan sulfate proteoglycan layers with respect to LDL and Ca(2+) complexation. LDL was found to be deposited strongly at the proteoheparan sulfate-coated surface, particularly in the presence of Ca(2+), apparently through complex formation 'proteoglycan-low density lipoprotein-calcium'. This ternary complex build-up may be interpreted as arteriosclerotic nanoplaque formation on the molecular level responsible for the arteriosclerotic primary lesion. In a receptor-based biosensor application, this system was tested on its reliability to unveil possible acute pleiotropic effects of the lipid lowering drug fluvastatin. The VLDL/IDL/LDL and VLDL/IDL/LDL/HDL plasma fractions from a high risk patient with dyslipoproteinaemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus showed the start of arteriosclerotic nanoplaque formation at a normal blood Ca(2+) concentration, with a strong increase at higher Ca(2+) concentrations. Nanoplaque formation and size of the HDL-containing lipid fraction remained well below that of the LDL-containing lipid fraction. Fluvastatin, whether applied acutely to the patient (one single 80 mg slow release matrix tablet) or in a 2-month medication regimen, markedly slowed down this process of ternary aggregational nanoplaque build-up and substantially inhibited nanoplaque size development at all Ca(2+) concentrations used. The acute action gave no significant change in lipid concentrations of the patient. Furthermore, after nanoplaque generation, fluvastatin, similar to HDL, was able to reduce nanoplaque formation and size. These immediate effects of fluvastatin have to be taken into consideration when interpreting the clinical outcome of long-term studies.", 
    "44": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disease that causes relapsing and chronic neurologic impairment. Recent observations have altered certain traditional concepts regarding MS pathogenesis. A greater diversity of cell types and molecules involved in MS is now evident. While remyelination can occur during the early inflammatory phase when damage may be reversible, it is impaired in the later stages, which involve axonal death. These observations have important therapeutic implications.", 
    "45": "Hypercholesterolemia is linked to endothelial dysfunction and enhancement of the endogenous inhibitor of NO synthase. The statins have lipid-lowering and pleiotropic properties, which could exert protective effects on the endothelium in hypercholesterolemia. The association of L-arginine with simvastatin could promote a further improvement on endothelial function in this condition. Thus, we investigated whether simvastatin, with or without supplementation with L-arginine, could improve endothelium-dependent vasodilation. In this study, 25 hypercholesterolemic subjects were treated according to the following protocol: washout period of 1 month; simvastatin (20 mg/day) for 2 months; simvastatin (20 mg/day) + L-arginine (7 g/day) for 2 months. From these patients, 10 were chosen at random for evaluation of vascular function by high resolution ultrasonography of the brachial artery. In subjects treated with simvastatin plus L-arginine, an increase of L-arginine levels (68%) and L-arginine/asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) ratio (67%) were observed. Simvastatin reduced the plasma concentrations of NO metabolites nitrite + nitrate (NOx: 34%), S-nitrosothiols (RSNO: 42%), total cholesterol (25%), low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (36%) and the LDL-cholesterol/high density lipoprotein (HDL-cholesterol ratio (34%). Simvastatin, associated or not to L-arginine, did not affect ADMA levels and endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Our data showed that simvastatin reduced the plasma concentrations of NOx and RSNO without affecting either the levels of ADMA or endothelium-dependent vasodilation in hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "46": "Comparing the dose-response of a new drug to that of a previously studied drug can aid in understanding their relative potencies. Two dose-finding studies addressed the effect of a new drug, rosuvastatin, on its ability to decrease low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. One of these studies included 2 doses of atorvastatin, and substantial additional information is available in the literature about the effect of atorvastatin on LDL-C level lowering.", 
    "47": "The 2 dose-finding studies of rosuvastatin considered otherwise healthy patients who had hypercholesterolemia. Comparable studies of atorvastatin were identified via a MEDLINE search in December 1999. Multiple reviewer consensus identified 15 of 41 studies on atorvastatin published since 1996 that met these selection criteria: reporting of LDL-C level change from baseline at least 6 weeks after treatment initiation, doses administered, and treatment group sizes. Eligible populations had clinical evidence of hypercholesterolemia. We excluded studies with patients who had severe illness or a previous history of transplantation. Data extraction of the mean, sample sizes, and SDs (or CIs) by dose was carried out independently by multiple reviewers. We combined the results from the various studies with Bayesian hierarchical modeling and analyzed them with Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques.", 
    "48": "Combining this study and literature results substantially increased the power to compare the dose-response relationships of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin. Rosuvastatin reduced LDL-C level by an estimated 10 to 17 percentage points more than atorvastatin when both were given at the same dose. Approximately one quarter of the dose of rosuvastatin achieved about the same magnitude of LDL-C level reduction as atorvastatin at dosages as high as 80 mg. This finding does not imply a 4-fold difference in efficacy overall and specifically does not describe the results at higher dosage levels.", 
    "49": "Bayesian meta-analysis of results from related studies allows the comparison of the dose-response relationships of 2 drugs, better estimates of a particular dose-response relationship within an individual study, and the expression of relative benefits (of dose and drug) in terms of probabilities. Explicitly comparing a study's results with historical data using Bayesian meta-analysis allows clinicians to view the study in the larger context of medical research.", 
    "50": "Despite the wealth of clinical evidence that demonstrates a reduction in the risk of coronary heart disease with the use of various lipid-lowering therapies, many patients in the United States are untreated or inadequately treated with these agents. Although the most recent treatment guidelines developed by the National Cholesterol Education Program provide detailed information regarding risk assessment of patients and desired lipid and lipoprotein goals, practitioners need to stay current on any emerging data that may have a significant impact on the management of patients with dyslipidemia. Over the past 2 years, the results of several clinical trials that may prompt the initiation of lipid-lowering therapy in a broader range of patients have been published. This article reviews the findings of these important clinical trials and provides some insight as to how these findings can be incorporated into clinical practice.",

    "52": "The statins reduce cholesterol synthesis through inhibition of HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA) reductase and are widely prescribed for hyperlipidaemia to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic complications. The beneficial effect of lipid lowering by statins in the treatment of coronary heart disease has been demonstrated in large clinical trials. However, statins appear to have additional benefits on vascular function above and beyond their lipid lowering effects. Through inhibition of L-mevalonate synthesis, statins also prevent the synthesis of isoprenoid intermediates, including farnesylpyrophosphate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate. Isoprenylation is important in the post-translational modification of a variety of proteins, including the small GTPases Rho, Rac and Ras, and hence plays an integral role in cellular signalling. Moreover, interference with isoprenylation underlies many of the beneficial actions of the statins on vascular endothelium, which include increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression, pro-angiogenic effects, increased fibrinolytic activity, immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory actions, including increased resistance to complement. This has led to interest in the use of this class of drugs outside the realm of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "53": "Several landmark clinical trials have demonstrated the benefit of lipid-lowering with statins for the primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. The clinical data in support of lowering cholesterol by statins are unequivocal. The established mechanism of action is via sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) activation due to reduced hepatic cholesterol synthesis and secondary upregulation of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor, leading to enhanced clearance of circulating cholesterol and lipids. Although it is widely accepted that most clinical benefit obtained with statins is a direct result of their lipid-lowering properties, there is still some debate as to whether the so-called 'pleiotropic effects' of statins contribute to the clinical outcome in vascular disease, or whether all the beneficial effects of statins are simply due to lipid-lowering. For example, these agents appear to display additional cholesterol-independent effects on various aspects of cardiovascular disease, including improving endothelial function, decreasing vascular inflammation and enhancing plaque stability. Thus, further studies are needed to understand the full impact of statin therapy on each of these processes and whether these effects contribute to the clinical benefits of statins in acute coronary syndromes and stroke.", 
    "54": "For most patients who require lipid-lowering treatment, statin monotherapy is the appropriate treatment. However, in those patients where statin monotherapy does not produce optimal lipid levels, the combination of a statin with niacin, a bile acid sequestrant, a fibric acid derivative, a cholesterol absorption inhibitor or a fish oil preparation may provide improved control. The choice of combination therapy depends upon the patient's lipid profile and tolerability of the medication. Combination of a statin with niacin, a bile acid sequestrant or ezetimibe, a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, should be considered for patients with very high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, while combination with either a fibric acid derivative or a fish oil should be considered for patients with high LDL-C and high triglyceride levels. A number of new lipid-lowering agents are currently in development, including cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors, acyl coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitors, ileal bile acid transport (IBAT) inhibitors, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) inhibitors and dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha and gamma agonists. Introduction of these novel therapies will provide opportunities for developing different combination strategies that may help to optimise lipid profiles in patients who are currently difficult to treat. The introduction of new combinations will require careful study to ensure that the risks of drug interactions and adverse events are minimised.",

Patients aged 70 years and older were treated significantly less frequently then younger individuals (30.6% vs. 61.3%, p < 0.0001). Patients with a history of prior revascularization procedure were treated significantly more often then patients undergoing the first procedure (64.8% vs. 49.8%, p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to detect significant predictors of long-term statin therapy. Only hypercholesterolemia and statin prescription at discharge were identified as independent positive predictors, whereas age > or = 70 years and male gender had negative predictive value.",

As shown, bcr-abl activates the ras pathway by phosphorylation of adapter proteins such as Grb-2 and Crkl. Functional inhibition of p21ras might partially inhibit the mitogenic signaling by bcr-abl. By depletion of cellular mevalonate pools, p21ras proteins can be rendered non-functional as a result of deficient post-translational protein farnesylation. We investigated the pharmacologic effect of mevalonate depletion by lovastatin in conjunction with interferon-alpha 2b (INF-alpha 2b) in bcr-abl positive K562 cells. At various concentrations, both drugs synergistically reduced cell proliferation of CML line K562 in a liquid culture system as well as clonal growth of colony forming units in a patient with newly diagnosed CML. Lovastatin and IFN-alpha 2b in combination led to cell cycle arrest and resulted in significant reduction of phosphorylation on tyrosine, serine, and threonine protein residues. IFN-alpha 2b alone showed little effect on protein phosphorylation but strongly enhanced lovastatin driven loss of phosphorylation. Subsequently, DNA fragmentation occurred in 50% of cells. In conclusion, exposure to IFN-alpha 2b and lovastatin synergistically inhibited proliferation of bcr-abl positive cells and resulted in loss of protein phosphorylation and subsequent apoptosis in K562 cells. Our in vitro model suggests further investigations are required of the potential value of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors as adjunct to therapy of CML with interferon.",

Therefore, we studied the association between high, predicted CHD risk and oxLDL in the Health ABC cohort.", 
    "71": "This cohort included 385 persons with CHD and 1183 persons at high risk; the latter were all persons with CHD risk equivalents: noncoronary forms of clinical atherosclerotic disease, diabetes, and a 10-year risk for CHD >20% by Framingham scoring. The remaining 1535 participants were at low risk. Levels of oxLDL were 1.18+/-0.61 mg/dL for low-risk persons, 1.50+/-0.81 mg/dL for high-risk persons without diagnosed CHD, and 1.32+/-0.83 mg/dL for persons with CHD (P<0.001). The odds ratio for high CHD risk in the highest quintile of oxLDL, compared with the lowest quintile and after adjusting for age, sex, race, LDL cholesterol, smoking status, and C-reactive protein, was 2.79 (P<0.001).", 
    "72": "The odds ratio for elevated oxLDL among persons with high CHD risk before any CHD events was higher than that among persons with established CHD.

The discovery of drugs that inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, constituted a major advance in the treatment of patients with elevated plasma concentrations of LDL-C. The efficacy of statins in LDL-lowering and CHD risk reduction has clearly been demonstrated in a number of primary and secondary intervention trials. Emerging options for the treatment of patients with elevated LDL-C include the super-statins rosuvastatin and pitavastatin, as well as the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe.

    "76": "The treatment of proliferating murine tubular cells (MCT) with simvastatin induced apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner (0.1 to 1 micromol/L). Apoptosis was correlated with Bcl-xL mRNA and protein down-regulation. By contrast, the treatment with simvastatin did not modify the expression of the proapoptotic protein Bax. Simvastatin treatment was associated with cytochrome C release from the mitochondria to the cytosol. We also observed the presence of active caspase 9 and 3 during apoptosis induced by simvastatin. These effects were reversed by mevalonate, farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP), and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP), suggesting the involvement of protein prenylation. Simvastatin appears to alter the balance between cell-life and death-promoting genes, as reflected by the decreased Bcl-xL/Bax ratio. Supporting this hypothesis, overexpression of Bcl-xL reduced the amount of apoptosis induced by simvastatin by 80% when compared with control vector-expressing cells. The overexpression of Bcl-xL also prevented the activation of caspase 9 and 3.",

The pharmacokinetic parameters AUC(0-t), AUC(0-variant), C(MAX), T(MAX), T(1/2) and elimination rate constant were determined from plasma concentration-time profile for both formulations and were compared statistically to evaluate bioequivalence between the two brands, using the statistical modules recommended by FDA. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) did not show any significant difference between the two formulations and 90% confidence intervals fell within the acceptable range for bioequivalence.

    "80": "Recent evidence suggests that the beneficial effects of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors on entothelial function and cardiovascular ischemic events may be attributed not only to their lipid-lowering effects but also to cholesterol-lowering independent (direct) effects on the atherosclerotic vessel wall. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that fluvastatin (Flu) preserves the endothelial function by its cholesterol-lowering independent actions. Rabbits were fed a 0.5% high-cholesterol (HC) diet for 12 weeks (progression phase) and then fed the HC diet either containing or not containing Flu 2 mg/kg/day for an additional 8 weeks (treatment phase). Rabbits fed a normal diet were used as controls. Plasma total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations did not differ during the treatment phase: Endothelium-dependent/NO-mediated relaxation (acetylcholine and A23187) was impaired in the HC diet group, whereas it was preserved in the HC plus Flu treatment group. The endothelium-independent relaxation (sodium nitroprusside) was similar between the three groups. Interestingly, aortic oxidative stress (lipid peroxides and isoprostane F(2alpha)-III contents) and NADPH oxidase component (p22phox and gp91phox) mRNA expression were increased in the HC group but not in the HC plus Flu group. The A23187-induced nitric oxide production from the aorta was increased in both HC and HC plus Flu groups. There was no significant difference in tissue endothelial-type nitric oxide synthase mRNA expression. Plaque area and intimal thickening of the aorta were significantly lowered in the HC plus Flu group. Flu treatment preserved the endothelial function associated with the decrease in markers of oxidative stress in this experiment. These beneficial endothelial effects of Flu are likely to occur independently of plasma lipid concentrations and to be mediated by its antioxidant action.",

Numerous reactants familiar to students of blood coagulation have been shown to contribute to neoplastic proliferation, invasion and metastasis. Recently, considerable progress has been made in demonstrating the ability of drugs capable of inhibiting these reactants to alter cancer progression. Biological features of gliomas within the realm of blood coagulation suggest that clinical trials of such drugs warrant consideration. This approach offers the prospect of a novel treatment for this devastating tumour type that does not share the toxicities of conventional cancer therapies.",

With atorvastatin treatment initiated 1 day after stroke, animals exhibited significant increases in vascular endothelial growth factor, cyclic guanosine monophosphate, angiogenesis, endogenous cell proliferation and neurogenesis, and an increase in the synaptic protein, synaptophysin. Atorvastatin-induced angiogenesis in a tube formation assay was reduced by an antibody against the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (FIK-1) and by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, N-mono-methyl-L-arginine (L-NAME). Atorvastatin also induced phosphorylation of Akt and Erk in cultured primary cortical neurons. These data indicate that atorvastatin induced brain plasticity and has neurorestorative activity after experimental stroke.", 
    "83": "3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. This endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein contains a cytosolic catalytic domain and a transmembrane domain with eight membrane spans that are necessary for sterol-accelerated degradation. Competition experiments showed that wild-type transmembrane domains of HMGR and sterol regulatory element binding protein cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) blocked sterol-accelerated degradation of intact HMGR and HMGal, a model protein containing the membrane domain of HMGR linked to Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase. However, mutant transmembrane domains of HMGR and SCAP whose sterol-sensing functions were abolished did not inhibit sterol-accelerated degradation of HMGR and HMGal. In addition, our mutagenesis studies on HMGal indicated that four Phe residues conserved in span 6 of HMGR and the sterol-sensing domains of other sterol-related proteins are required for the regulated degradation of HMGR. These results suggest that HMGR and SCAP compete for binding to a sterol-regulated regulator protein, and this binding may need the four Phe residues.",

The available data offer the rationale for future in vitro studies aimed at evaluating proapoptotic and antiangiogenic action of this association. If the results of vitro studies should confirm the hypothesis that statins potentiate the action of bisphosphonates, further clinical investigations could be mandatory to evaluate the efficacy of this new pharmacological approach in anticancer therapy.",

    "86": "Low levels of expression and sluggish sterol-mediated regulation have been likely reasons for the failure to molecularly characterize a bona fide LDL receptor (LDLR) in egg-laying species to date. The overall structure of the chicken LDLR, delineated here by cDNA cloning, has been conserved in evolution, since hallmark properties of mammalian LDLRs are already present in the avian protein. The chicken receptor appears to prefer LDL over VLDL as ligand, in compliance with its main role in providing lipoprotein-derived cholesterol for steroid production in ovarian follicular cells. This is also compatible with the fact that estrogen administration increased hepatic LDLR expression in roosters despite dramatically stimulated VLDL production. In cultured chicken embryo fibroblasts, expression of the receptor was induced by incubation with cholesterol synthesis inhibitors such as a statin. Furthermore, preincubation of induced cells with a specific anti-receptor antibody blocks LDL endocytosis, demonstrating that the receptor is ligand-endocytosis competent. Finally, the distribution of LDLRs among the extraoocytic cell populations lends support to a three-cell model for estrogen production within the ovarian follicle. In summary, the molecular characterization of the first avian LDLR reveals novel information about evolutionary, structural, and functional aspects of members of the supergene family of LDLR-related proteins.", 
    "87": "Macrophage apoptosis is an important factor in determining the efficiency of the immune response, atherosclerotic lesion stability, and clearance of aged cells by phagocytosis. The involvement of caveolin-1 in the regulation of apoptosis has been previously suggested in fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Here we show that treatment of thioglycollate-elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages with various unrelated apoptotic agents, including simvastatin, camptothecin, or glucose deprivation, is associated with a specific and large increase in caveolin-1 expression. In contrast, caveolin-2 levels remain unaffected. Induction of apoptosis was measured by changes in cell morphology, annexin V-labeling, and DNA fragmentation. We demonstrate that caveolin-1 in macrophages is present in lipid rafts and colocalizes with phosphatidylserine (PS) at the cell surface of apoptotic macrophages. Our data suggest that caveolin-1 increase is an early event, closely accompanied by PS externalization and independent of caspase activation and nuclear DNA fragmentation. The increase in caveolin-1 levels does not require new protein synthesis, as cycloheximide does not prevent the apoptosis-mediated increase in caveolin-1 levels. We propose that increased levels of caveolin-1 characterize the apoptotic phenotype of macrophages. Caveolin-1 may be involved in the efficient externalization of PS at the surface of the apoptotic cells.",

The assimilation capacity of both strains for mono-, disaccharides and some alcohols is in the same range (Yx/c 0.2 - 0.35), while the red strain has a higher fermentation capacity. In a selected albino mutant, the growth rate, metabolic activity and capacity for production of typical for Monascus fungi secondary metabolites were reduced considerably. Hydrolytic activity towards natural substrates expressed through glucoamylase and protease was approximately 10 fold lower in the non pigment producing strain (0.05 - 0.08 U/mg protein and 0.01 - 0.07 U/mg protein respectively) compared with the red one. Important qualitative differences between both strains was found in fatty acid composition and in the production of citrinin and monacolin. The mutant strain possessed C17, C20 and C22 fatty acids and did not produce citrinin.", 
    "89": "Dyslipidemia has been recognized as an important risk-factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. The current, available therapies of dyslipidemia, their effectiveness, costs, cost-effectiveness and healthcare implications are discussed. At the present time, the lipid-lowering therapies are dominated by statins. Despite a variety of assumptions regarding modeling cardiovascular disease risks and costs, statin therapy is generally cost-effective for secondary prevention and for primary prevention in individuals with additional risk-factors. The costs of drug therapy and the absolute risk of developing future cardiovasular events are the dominant factors determining the cost-effectiveness. When developing clinical guidelines, the cost-effectiveness and proportion of the population to be treated must be considered as well as the total population costs of treatment.", 
    "90": "The reduction of large arterial distensibility has several adverse consequences for the cardiovascular system. This paper reviews the evidence we have obtained by measuring distensibility through quantification of changes in arterial diameter vs blood pressure changes at large elastic and middle size muscle artery sites. Evidence shows that arterial distensibility is reduced in conditions such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes, and congestive heart failure. In some conditions (e.g. hypertension) the alterations are not uniformly distributed in the arteries of different structure and size whereas in others (e.g. diabetes and heart failure) they are widespread. In diabetes evidence is available that distensibility changes occur early in the course of the disease. Evidence is also available that in all above conditions treatment can improve arterial distensibility thereby reversing the initial abnormality. This is due to a variable combination of structural and functional factors. However, technical ability to determine their precise role in distensibility changes in humans is limited.", 
    "91": "Oxidised low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is believed to be the most atherogenic form of LDL. However, while a number of experimental data support this concept, the protective role of antioxidants that may prevent LDL oxidation in atherosclerosis is only partially confirmed by studies in man. Observational and epidemiological data as well as randomised trials failed to provide clear-cut indications, because of mixed results on the protective role of antioxidants against cardiovascular diseases. In spite of the lack of a general consensus, recent data reinforce the concept that a regular intake of antioxidants present in food blocks the progression of atherosclerosis and that the reduced ability of LDL to oxidise may represent a good marker to follow the action of antioxidants. Among their properties statins also possess antioxidant activities and the aim of this paper is to review the scientific evidence for such an effect and its possible clinical relevance.", 
    "92": "Atherosclerosis has many features of a chronic inflammatory disease. Atherosclerotic lesions contain inflammatory cells. Systemic markers of inflammation, such as white blood cells, C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, interleukin-6, and soluble adhesion molecules are predictive of future cardiovascular events. Atherogenic lipoprotein particles, in particular modified low-density lipoproteins (LDL), elicit pro-inflammatory responses of cellular elements of the vessel wall, including endothelial dysfunction and activation of monocyte-derived macrophages. High-density lipoproteins (HDL) oppose these effects by inhibiting the oxidation of LDL, and by down-regulating the expression of adhesion molecules and selectins. Treatment with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) has proven the most successful strategy to reduce the concentration of LDL in the circulation. These compounds lower LDL cholesterol by inhibiting the mevalonate pathway in the liver. Prospective clinical trials have convincingly demonstrated that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can effectively lower the incidence of cardiovascular events in primary and secondary prevention. Post hoc analyses of these trials suggest that the clinical benefit brought about by statins may not entirely be due to their effect on the levels of circulating lipoproteins. In vitro observations of anti-inflammatory actions of statins on vascular cells may contribute to explain effects beyond lipid lowering. It is, however, not clear whether these findings are relevant to the in vivo situation. Further investigation is now necessary in order to determine the relative significance of cholesterol lowering and of ancillary effects on the net clinical benefit of statin treatment.", 
    "93": "3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors are now the standard of care for patients with hypercholesterolaemia. This class of inhibitors, known as 'statins', has been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Accumulating data demonstrates a variety of mechanisms in which HMG-CoA reductase inhibition benefits the cardiovascular system. This review will discuss the pharmacology, clinical trials, and mechanisms, besides lipid lowering, of statin therapy.", 
    "94": "Statins are best-known for their lipid-lowering effects and have been shown to significantly impact the natural progression of coronary atherosclerosis. The mechanism through which they exert this effect is thought to be primarily due to their ability to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. However, there is increasing evidence that statins exert a myriad of other beneficial effects on the vascular wall, thus altering the course of atherosclerotic disease. This article will review the prevention trial literature as it pertains to the effects of statin therapy on atherosclerosis.", 
    "95": "The present study assessed the neurochemical differences between right hemispheric dominant and left hemispheric dominant individuals. The HMG CoA reductase activity, serum digoxin, magnesium, tryptophan catabolites, tyrosine catabolites, and RBC membrane (Na+)-K+ ATPase activity were measured in individuals of differing hemispheric dominance. The results showed that right hemispheric dominant individuals had elevated digoxin synthesis, increased tryptophan catabolites, and reduced tyrosine catabolites and membrane (Na+)-K+ ATPase with hypomagnesemia. Left hemispheric dominant individuals had the opposite patterns. Right hemispheric dominance represents a hyperdigoxinemic state with membrane sodium-potassium ATPase inhibition. Left hemispheric dominance represents the reverse pattern with hypodigoxinemia and membrane sodium-potassium ATPase stimulation.", 
    "96": "The isoprenoid pathway produces three key metabolites--endogenous digoxin, dolichol, and ubiquinone. Since endogenous digoxin can regulate neurotransmitter transport and dolichols can modulate glycoconjugate synthesis important in synaptic connectivity, the pathway was assessed in patients with dyslexia, delayed recovery from global aphasia consequent to a dominant hemispheric thrombotic infarct, and developmental delay of speech milestone. The pathway was also studied in right hemispheric, left hemispheric, and bihemispheric dominance to find out the role of hemispheric dominance in the pathogenesis of speech disorders. The plasma/serum--activity of HMG CoA reductase, magnesium, digoxin, dolichol, ubiquinone--and tryptophan/tyrosine catabolic patterns, as well as RBC (Na+)-K+ ATPase activity, were measured in the above mentioned groups. The glycoconjugate metabolism and membrane composition was also studied. The study showed that in dyslexia, developmental delay of speech milestone, and delayed recovery from global aphasia there was an upregulated isoprenoidal pathway with increased digoxin and dolichol levels. The membrane (Na+)-K+ ATPase activity, serum magnesium and ubiquinone levels were low. The tryptophan catabolites were increased and the tyrosine catabolites including dopamine decreased in the serum contributing to a speech dysfunction. There was an increase in carbohydrate residues of glycoproteins, glycosaminoglycans, and glycolipids levels as well as an increased activity of GAG degrading enzymes and glyco hydrolases in the serum. The cholesterol:phospholipid ratio of RBC membrane increased and membrane glycoconjugates showed a decrease. All of these could contribute to altered synaptic inactivity in these disorders. The patterns correlated with those obtained in right hemispheric chemical dominance. Right hemispheric chemical dominance may play a role in the genesis of these disorders. Hemispheric chemical dominance has no correlation with handedness or the dichotic listening test.", 
    "97": "Since hypercholesterolemia directly modifies the composition of erythrocytes plasma membrane, the influence of statins on erythrocytes has been researched. The beneficial effects of statins on clinical events may involve mechanisms that modify endothelial dysfunction, plaque stability, thrombus formation and inflammatory responses. The aim of the study was to evaluate the hypolipemic efficacy and effects of pravastatin and simvastatin on erythrocyte membrane fluidity and damage of erythrocytes in patients with type 2 hypercholesterolemia in comparison with a control group of healthy subjects. The study involved 53 patients affected by type 2 hypercholesterolemia (mean age, 53.3 +/- 10.3) with initial total serum cholesterol (TC) levels > 250 mg/dL, LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels > 170 mg/dL, and triglycerides (TG) levels < 400 mg/dL. The control group consisted of 30 healthy individuals (mean age 56.9 +/- 6.3). Statins were given for 12 weeks. The dosages for oral administration of simvastatin and pravastatin were 20 mg/day. Laboratory tests were carried out before and after 4 and 12 weeks of the pharmacological treatment. The damage to plasma membrane of erythrocytes was measured on the basis of lipid peroxidation. The fluidity of plasma membrane of erythrocytes was determined by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, using two spin labels: 5-DSA and 16-DSA. The cholesterol level in the membrane of red blood cells was estimated. Simvastatin and pravastatin reduced the total cholesterol concentration and LDL-cholesterol in plasma, as well as the cholesterol concentration in erythrocytes membranes. Hypercholesterolemia induced changes in the basic properties of human erythrocyte plasma membrane, including its fluidity and the intensity of lipid peroxidation. These results indicate that the simvastatin and pravastatin therapy reverses the alteration in the erythrocyte plasma membrane properties.", 
    "98": "We investigated the effect of cerivastatin, a statin, on the development of diabetic nephropathy in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with streptozotocin-induced diabetes.", 
    "99": "Diabetic SHR were given standard chow or chow containing cerivastatin at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg for 12 weeks. Effects of cerivastatin on urinary albumin excretion, mesangial expansion, glomerular macrophage infiltration, and the number of anionic sites on the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) were assessed.", 
    "100": "Cerivastatin did not affect the blood glucose concentration, blood pressure or serum cholesterol concentration in diabetic SHR. However, cerivastatin treatment caused a dose-dependent decrease of albuminuria and hyperfiltration. At 1.0 mg/kg, cerivastatin inhibited the diabetes-induced expansion of mesangial and tuft areas on histological examination of the kidneys, as well as the loss of anionic sites from the GBM evaluated with polyetyleneimine and the intraglomerular infiltration of ED1-positive macrophages evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Whole-kidney expression of mRNA for MCP-1 and TGF-beta, estimated by the real-time quantitative RT-PCR, was increased (both 2.6-fold) in untreated diabetic SHR at 12 weeks. Cerivastatin treatment (1.0 mg/kg) inhibited the up-regulated expression of MCP-1 and TGF-beta mRNA (decreased to 48% and 34%, respectively) in diabetic SHR.", 
    "101": "In this hypertensive model of diabetic nephropathy, cerivastatin decreased albuminuria through suppression of glomerular hyperfiltration, mesangial expansion, and the loss of charge barrier independently of a cholesterol-lowering effect. These preventive effects could be at least partly due to inhibition of macrophage recruitment and activation, and inhibition of TGF-beta overexpression.", 
    "102": "The statins are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase (HMG-CoAR), and are utilized to decrease levels of atherogenic lipoproteins in patients with, or who are at high risk of, cardiovascular disease. This study describes the inhibition of a recombinant, catalytic fragment of human HMG-CoAR by a new statin, rosuvastatin (CRESTOR(R)). Binding is reversible and involves an initial complex [inhibition constant involving the enzyme-inhibitor complex (E.I), K (i), approximately 1 nM], which undergoes a slow transition ( t ((1/2)) to reach steady state is 33-360 s) to give tighter association [steady-state inhibition constant involving E.I and the second E.I complex in a two-step mechanism (E.I*), K (i)*, approximately 0.1 nM]. At steady state, rosuvastatin is at least as potent as atorvastatin, cerivastatin and simvastatin. It is more potent than fluvastatin and pravastatin. For rosuvastatin, inhibition kinetics are competitive with respect to HMG-CoA and non-competitive when NADPH is varied. At 37 degrees C, binding is linked to a large favourable enthalpy change [Delta H degrees =-69.0 kJ/mol (-16.5 kcal/mol)] and a small entropic penalty [ T Delta S degrees =-9.6 kJ/mol (-2.3 kcal/mol)]. These characteristics, and the high affinity relative to that of 3 S -HMG-CoA ( K (d) approximately 6.6 microM), are discussed in relation to the crystal structures of complexes with HMG-CoAR.",

    "104": "A MEDLINE search (1966-December 2002) was performed using SCH 48461, SCH 58235, ezetimibe, and 2-azetidinone as key words. English-language articles were identified and the references of these articles were used to further identify pertinent articles and abstracts. Given the paucity of published articles available on ezetimibe, many of the references cited are abstracts.", 
    "105": "All acquired articles that discussed the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, chemistry, and clinical efficacy of ezetimibe were reviewed.", 
    "106": "Articles were selected based on content regarding the medicinal chemistry, pharmacology, and clinical use of ezetimibe.", 
    "107": "Ezetimibe, approved for use in October 2002, belongs to a new class of antihyperlipidemic agents that uniquely inhibit the absorption of cholesterol by inhibiting the cholesterol transport system located within intestinal cell walls. In humans, ezetimibe reduced cholesterol absorption by >50%. In clinical trials, ezetimibe 10 mg/d reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by approximately 18% and further enhanced the LDL-C-lowering effect of statin medications by an additional 15-20%. In addition, ezetimibe lowered triglycerides about 5% and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) approximately 3%. Ezetimibe is well tolerated. At present, no serious adverse effects have been directly attributable to ezetimibe.", 
    "108": "Based on the data currently available, it appears that ezetimibe has a potential role in the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia; however further data are needed to determine its long-term tolerability and efficacy. The potential roles for ezetimibe include its concurrent use with a statin to further enhance the lowering of LDL-C. Other possible roles for ezetimibe include its concurrent use with a statin to permit a lowering of statin dosage to avoid statin-related complications or its use as monotherapy to treat hypercholesterolemia when statin use cannot be tolerated or is contraindicated. Outcome data demonstrating that cardiovascular morbidity and/or mortality are reduced by ezetimibe therapy have yet to be generated.",

    "110": "A 51-year-old white woman presented to the emergency department with severe weakness, near syncope, shortness of breath, and chest pain. On admission, her electrocardiogram demonstrated bradycardia (40 beats/min) and third-degree heart block. A creatine kinase (CK) level was >7000 U/L. Her medication history was significant for long-term use of atorvastatin (>1 y), a 6-week history of esomeprazole use, and three 500-mg doses of clarithromycin just prior to admission. Her symptoms of weakness, shortness of breath, and chest pain coincided with starting the esomeprazole. During her hospitalization, the woman required pacemaker placement and her CK continued to rise to >40,000 U/L. Screening for other causes of RML, such as thyrotoxicosis, infection, and immune or hepatic diseases, was negative. She gradually improved over a 26-day hospitalization.", 
    "111": "This is a case of RML resulting in third-degree atrioventricular blockade. An objective causality assessment of the adverse reaction via the Naranjo probability scale revealed a probable association with atorvastatin and a possible association with esomeprazole and clarithromycin. The pharmacokinetic profiles of these agents suggest that a possible contribution to this reaction was P-glycoprotein (PGP) inhibition by esomeprazole altering atorvastatin's normally significant first-pass clearance.", 
    "112": "PGP drug interactions with atorvastatin and other hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) may be associated with unreported risks for RML. Further investigation into PGP impact on HMG-CoA appears warranted.", 
    "113": "The Ontario government spent approximately 10% (CDN $148 million) of the provincial medication budget on statins in 1998. This number can be expected to grow in light of new guidelines from the United States recommending that three times as many patients should be receiving antihyperlipidemic therapy. There is scant population-based information on the age and sex distributions of patients receiving these medications.", 
    "114": "To estimate the rates of new use of statin medications among community-dwelling elderly adults in Ontario between 1994 and 2000.", 
    "115": "Data from the Ontario Drug Benefit program were used on all medications dispensed to noninstitutionalized Ontarians over 65 years of age to estimate age- and sex-specific annual rates of patients newly dispensed a statin. Changes in rates were estimated using Poisson regression.", 
    "116": "The number of elderly Ontarians newly dispensed a statin increased rapidly between 1994 and 2000, with age-standardized rates rising from approximately 840 to 2600/100,000 women and from 810 to about 3100/100,000 men. The highest rates of new use were observed among patients of both sexes aged 65 to 74 years. However, the rate of change increased with advancing age so that the biggest increase was observed among those aged 85 years and above, among whom there was an 8.5-fold increase among women and a 12-fold increase among men.", 
    "117": "Statins have been shown to be safe, efficacious and cost effective in reducing the risk of sudden cardiac death and other acute coronary events among middle-aged patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. The present study showed that there was a rapid increase in the rate of statins newly dispensed to elderly patients in Ontario, among whom estimates of safety, efficacy and cost effectiveness are not well quantified. Better estimates of these parameters in the elderly are required because of the high costs and benefits and potential unintended beneficial and harmful effects of statins.",

    "119": "In 20 pigs the second and third diagonal arteries were occluded for 90 minutes, followed by 45 minutes of blood cardioplegic arrest and 180 minutes of reperfusion. Ten pigs received atorvastatin (40 mg orally every day) for 21 days before surgical intervention; 10 others received no statins. Ischemic damage was assessed on the basis of the need for cardioversions for ventricular arrhythmias, regional wall-motion scores (4 = normal to -1 = dyskinesia) were determined by means of 2-dimensional echocardiography, endothelial function was assessed on the basis of bradykinin-induced coronary artery relaxation, and infarct size was calculated by determining the area of necrosis to the area of risk by means of histochemical staining. Results are given as means +/- SE.", 
    "120": "Statin-treated animals required fewer cardioversions (0.11 +/- 0.01 vs 2.87 +/- 0.20, P =.0001), had improved wall-motion scores (2.81 +/- 0.10 vs 1.52 +/- 0.08, P =.01), had lower infarct size (21% +/- 2% vs 41% +/- 2%, P =.0001), and had more complete coronary artery relaxation (34% +/- 5% vs 8% +/- 4%, P =.01). Total serum cholesterol levels were similar between the groups (62 +/- 5 mg/dL for statin-treated animals vs 68 +/- 5 mg/dL for non-statin-treated animals, P =.30).", 
    "121": "Pretreatment with statins enhances myocardial protection during revascularization by means of mechanisms that are independent of their cholesterol-lowering properties.", 
    "122": "Elevated level of the acute phase reactant C-reactive protein (CRP) is a very sensitive marker of acute inflammatory reactions. Using high sensitivity assays for CRP, recent observations indicate that slightly elevated CRP levels which would be in the normal range of conventional assays are a novel marker for an increased risk for cardiovascular events, especially coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. Various large scale prospective trials including the Physicians' Health Study and the Women's Health Study revealed that slightly increased hsCRP levels at base line in apparently healthy persons are associated with a 2-fold increase in the risk of a future myocardial infarction. The predictive value of hsCRP was found to be independent from classic risk factors, in particular from elevated serum cholesterol. An increase in hsCRP levels was also associated with a higher risk to develop peripheral artery disease and with a faster progression of carotid artery disease. Until now, treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) has been found to be the only medication to consistently decrease hsCRP levels, although by about 15% only. Despite the association of elevated hsCRP levels with future cardiovascular events, routine measurement of hsCRP for cardiovascular risk assessment is currently not recommended because of its low accuracy, the lack of a clear cut-off point for elevated hsCRP levels and the lack of an absolute predictive value. So far, hsCRP remains an interesting potential risk marker for cardiovascular disease whose definite relevance remains to be established.", 
    "123": "The statins are lipid-lowering agents that act by inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. This enzyme is responsible for the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate. Products of mevalonate metabolism are critical for several cellular processes of eukaryotic cells, and inhibition of the mevalonate pathway by statins has pleiotropic effects. It has been reported that statins inhibit the migration and proliferation of vascular smooth cells (VSMCs), reduce interleukin-6 expression in VSMCs, improve endothelium-dependent vasomotion, and inhibit the expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and matrix metalloproteinases in endothelial cells. These effects of statins are independent of plasma cholesterol level, and are completely blocked by exogenous mevalonate and some isoprenoids. These findings suggest that statins exert direct antiatherosclerotic effects on the vascular wall beyond their effects on plasma lipids.", 
    "124": "Rosuvastatin is a synthetic enantiomer that is hepatoselective, relatively hydrophilic and has minimal metabolism via the cytochrome P450 3A4 system (similar to pravastatin). Rosuvastatin, like atorvastatin, has a plasma half-life of about 20 h and is a potent inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. The majority of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity in plasma is associated with the parent rosuvastatin compound. In a Phase II study, rosuvastatin across a dose range of 1 - 80 mg lowered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 34 - 65%. Phase III trials have demonstrated greater reductions in LDL-C for rosuvastatin compared to atorvastatin as well as greater increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). The drug appears to be well tolerated at all doses up to 80 mg/day. A starting dose of 10 mg will reduce LDL-C by approximately 50%, which should adequately treat most patients to within the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) goals.", 
    "125": "Cardiovascular disease as a result of accelerated atherogenesis is common in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Dyslipidemia may be a major contributor in this process and can be influenced by lipid-lowering drugs (statins). Moreover, statins may exhibit additional inhibitory effects on the atherogenesis, such as a modulation of the immune system as triggered by oxidatively modified LDL and a reduction of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP).", 
    "126": "We evaluated in a single-blind randomized trial of 28 ESRD patients on hemodialysis, the dose-depending effects of both atorvastatin and simvastatin on lipids, lipoproteins, LDL particle heterogeneity, high sensitive-CRP, and markers of in vivo LDL oxidation.", 
    "127": "Both statin therapies significantly lowered total plasma cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol concentrations to the same extent, whereas reduction in the concentrations of triglyceride-rich particles was less pronounced. Furthermore, statin therapy reduced LDL cholesterol in all LDL subfractions, without altering the overall LDL particle density. After both statins plasma hs-CRP concentrations were not significantly reduced; parameters of in vivo LDL oxidation (plasma ox-LDL concentration and the oxidation level of isolated LDL), were significantly decreased. Autoantibodies against ox-LDL, however, did not change during this trial period.", 
    "128": "These results show that atorvastatin and simvastatin exhibit comparable favourable effects on lipid profiles in ESRD. Moreover, the reduction of in vivo oxidatively modified LDL as shown in this ESRD population, may indicate that these statins exhibit favourable effects on oxidative stress in vivo.", 
    "129": "Patients with combined hyperlipidemia and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels may benefit from combination therapy with a statin and niacin; therefore, we assessed the efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin and extended-release (ER) niacin alone and in combination in 270 patients with this atherogenic dyslipidemia. Men and women > or =18 years with fasting total cholesterol levels > or =200 mg/dl, triglycerides 200 to 800 mg/dl, apolipoprotein B > or cf=110 mg/dl, and HDL cholesterol <45 mg/dl were randomized to 1 of 4 treatments in this 24-week, open-label, multicenter trial: rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg; ER niacin 0.5 to 2 g; rosuvastatin 40 mg/ER niacin 0.5 to 1 g; or rosuvastatin 10 mg/ER niacin 0.5 to 2 g. Percent changes from baseline in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, and other lipid measurements at week 24 were determined by analysis of variance, with statistical testing performed separately between the rosuvastatin monotherapy group and each remaining treatment group. Daily doses of rosuvastatin 40 mg reduced LDL and non-HDL cholesterol significantly more than either ER niacin 2 g or rosuvastatin 10 mg/ER niacin 2 g (-48% vs -0.1% and -36% for LDL cholesterol and -49% vs -11% and -38% for non-HDL cholesterol, respectively; p <0.01 for all comparisons); no additional reduction in LDL or non-HDL cholesterol was observed with the combination of rosuvastatin 40 mg/ER niacin 1.0 g (-42% and -47%; p = NS). Triglyceride reductions ranged from -21% (ER niacin monotherapy) to -39% (rosuvastatin 40 mg/ER niacin 1 g), but no observed differences were statistically significant. Compared with rosuvastatin alone, rosuvastatin 10 mg/ER niacin 2 g produced significantly greater increases in HDL cholesterol (11% vs 24%, p <0.001) and apolipoprotein A-I (5% vs 11%, p <0.017). Similar increases in HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I were noted between the monotherapy groups. Over 24 weeks, rosuvastatin alone was better tolerated than either ER niacin alone or the combinations of rosuvastatin and ER niacin."
