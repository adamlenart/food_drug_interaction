    "0": "Patients with type 2 diabetes are at high risk for coronary heart disease (CHD); frequently, these patients have abnormal lipid profiles, placing them at even greater risk. A syndrome of insulin resistance, hyperinsulinaemia, hypertension, and high levels of fibrinogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor contributes to cardiovascular risk, which is not sufficiently decreased by glycaemic control alone. In several large interventional trials, CHD risk in patients with diabetes was substantially reduced by aggressive lipid-lowering therapy. In patients with diabetes, CHD, low high-density lipoprotein levels, and normal low-density lipoprotein levels, gemfibrozil reduced fatal and non-fatal CHD events. For lipid-lowering in patients with diabetes and CHD, pravastatin and simvastatin are the only HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors shown to reduce fatal and non-fatal CHD events. Of these, pravastatin has less potential for drug-drug interactions and may be safer to use, particularly for combination therapy with fibric acid derivatives, as may now be important for CHD prevention in mixed dyslipidaemias.", 
    "1": "From the viewpoint of nephrologists dealing with diabetic patients with ESRD and the associated complications and devastating prognosis, the need to reduce the incidence, and delay the rate of progression of diabetic nephropathy is obvious. Studies published within the last year have provided support for views that seem intuitively obvious; that improved glycaemic control and reduced blood pressure are associated with delayed onset and delayed progression of diabetic nephropathy. These reports have also demonstrated the difficulty of achieving ideal blood pressure targets and glycaemic control in diabetic patients. Thus, even with available therapy it is likely that improved compliance and achieving targets will have a major impact on disease outcome. There is evidence in several subgroups that ACEi are beneficial over other agents and the favourable side-effect and efficacy profile of these agents makes it reasonable to suggest that they should be used 'first line' in all patients with diabetes unless specifically contra-indicated. However, the failure to readily achieve blood pressure targets and the need for polypharmacy suggest that novel agents are required. We believe that statin therapy will have a major impact on CVD in diabetic patients and is also likely to delay progression; studies assessing the combined affect of anti-hypertensive and statin therapy specifically on the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy will be necessary before evidence-based recommendations can be made. The role for newer agents and targeting high risk groups using genetic markers remains uncertain but we await there development with interest. The future can only get better for patients with DN.", 
    "2": "Several cardiovascular risk factors adversely affect arterial compliance or the distensibility of large arteries. The role of raised low-density lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol is uncertain, most studies having shown little effect. We, therefore, investigated whether lowering LDL would improve arterial compliance. Twenty hypercholesterolemic subjects (LDL cholesterol 4.95+/-1.11 mmol/l) were randomized to simvastatin (20 or 40 mg daily) or placebo, each for 4 weeks. Arterial function was assessed at the end of the placebo and simvastatin periods, systemic arterial compliance (SAC) and pulse wave velocities (PWV) centrally (aorto-femoral) and peripherally (femoral-posterior tibial).", 
    "3": "Lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol was reduced similarly with 20 and 40 mg simvastatin (ten subjects each dose) and data were pooled. Lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol fell 39%, plasma triglyceride fell 18% and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol rose 12%, all significant. Systemic arterial compliance (SAC) and central PWV did not change significantly but peripheral PWV showed evidence of greater compliance after simvastatin (10.1+/-1.3 vs. 9.4+/-1.3 m/s with placebo and simvastatin, P<0.03), distensibility being inversely related to PWV. Improvement in PWV was greatest in those with poorest baseline values, r=0.50; P<0.02.", 
    "4": "Peripheral PWV was alone improved with LDL lowering probably because of the muscularity of that arterial bed; central PWV and SAC (in the elastic aorta) were not influenced.", 
    "5": "To obtain information in vivo concerning the role of Fcgamma receptors (FcgammaR) in atherosclerosis, we used quantitative flow cytometry to measure the levels of expression of FcgammaRI and FcgammaRIIA on peripheral monocytes in patients with severe atherosclerosis. Expression of several other markers was also measured. We found that differences in the levels of expression of FcgammaRI were not statistically significant when compared between patients and control subjects. For FcgammaRIIA, levels of expression were decreased in the patient group, a difference that was statistically significant. Levels of expression of CD14 and CD36 were also significantly decreased in the patient group. The decrease in expression of FcgammaRIIA was statistically significant when the effects of current cigarette smoking status or medication use, including statins, were taken into account. There was also a positive and statistically significant correlation between high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and levels of expression of FcgammaRIIA for all subjects. In contrast, decreased levels of expression of CD14 and CD36 were strongly associated with current smoking status or statin use. In summary, levels of expression of FcgammaRIIA on peripheral blood monocytes were significantly decreased in patients with clinical atherosclerosis. Additional studies are warranted to determine if levels of expression of FcgammaRIIA have utility as a phenotypic marker for assessing relative risk of atherosclerotic disease.", 
    "6": "This study was performed to determine whether the levels of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-l) and soluble endothelial molecule-1 (sE-selectin) were elevated in subjects with hypercholesterolemia who presented with no other risk factors or evidence of atherosclerosis. The effects of administration of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor on the serum levels of these molecules were also examined. Forty hypercholesterolemic subjects (HCh) (19 males and 21 females), without hypertension or cardiovascular disease, received placebo for 4 weeks. The patients were then randomized in two groups; 20 of them (simvastatin group) were treated with simvastatin (20 mg/day) and the other 20 (placebo group) continued placebo administration. After 12 and 24 weeks of either simvastatin or placebo treatment, sICAM-1 and sE-selectin levels were measured. The same parameters were measured in 20 control subjects (C) with normal cholesterol levels, matched for sex and age. HCh had sICAM-1 basal values higher than C (352.4+/-57.9 ng/ml versus 114.9+/-89.6 ng/ml; P<0.001); however, sE-selectin basal values were not different in the two groups. No correlation was observed between HCh sICAM-1 levels and cholesterol levels (total and low-density lipoprotein). Furthermore, cholesterol-lowering treatment with simvastatin did not significantly diminish sICAM-1 levels. Our findings would support the hypothesis that patients with isolated hypercholesterolemia and without clinical atherosclerosis may be silent carriers of arterial subendothelial inflammation, expressed as an increase of sICAM-1.", 
    "7": "F 12511, a novel ACAT inhibitor, lowers plasma cholesterol levels in New Zealand rabbits fed a cholesterol-free casein-rich diet. In rabbits endogenous hypercholesterolemia pre-established for 8 weeks was used to compare treatments with F 12511 and atorvastatin for a further 8-week period, and to determine whether both agents act synergistically. F 12511 appears to be 3-4-fold more potent than atorvastatin in reducing total plasma cholesterol (active doses ranging from 0.16 to 2.5 and from 1.25 to 10 mg/kg per day, respectively) while the hypocholesterolemic efficacy of both compounds at 2.5 mg/kg per day amounted to 70 and 45%, respectively. A reduction by as much as 75% of esterified cholesterol in liver mediated by F 12511 could account for the decrease of plasma VLDL, LDL and apo B-100, whereas a reduction of the LDL production rate has been described as the main mechanism underlying the atorvastatin effect. F 12511 modified adrenal cholesterol balance only at the largest dose studied. In a further experiment the co-administration of threshold doses of F 12511 and atorvastatin (0.63 and 1.25 mg/kg per day, respectively) lowered plasma total cholesterol and apo B-100 containing lipoproteins to a greater extent and more rapidly than either agent alone. In the liver a decrease by atorvastatin in free cholesterol substrate for ACAT may amplify the effect of F 12511 on cholesteryl ester content leading to a diminution, in at least an additive manner, of the assembly and secretion of atherogenic lipoproteins in New Zealand rabbits which have developed an endogenous hypercholesterolemia. Thus, the combination of the ACAT inhibitor F 12511 with atorvastatin can represent a better approach than either agent alone to regulate lipoprotein metabolism in certain pathophysiological situations.", 
    "8": "Cardiovascular disease is accompanied by an impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilatory response. Loss of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression may contribute to endothelial dysfunction. The aim of the present study was to analyze the effect of cerivastatin, a novel HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced downregulation of eNOS protein expression in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). TNF-alpha (10 ng/ml)- incubated BAEC showed a reduced expression of eNOS protein and decreased eNOS mRNA stabilization. This effect was associated with an increased binding activity of BAEC cytosolic proteins to the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of eNOS mRNA. Cerivastatin prevented TNF-alpha-induced downregulation of eNOS protein expression in a concentration-dependent manner (10(-8) to 10(-5) M). Cerivastatin also prevented the binding of the cytosolic proteins to 3'-UTR of eNOS mRNA and was associated with eNOS mRNA stabilization. The reduced expression of eNOS protein by TNF-alpha was also prevented by coincubation with cycloheximide. In addition cycloheximide inhibited the binding activity of the cytosolic proteins to 3'-UTR of eNOS mRNA, suggesting the inducible character of the mentioned-cytosolic proteins. TNF-alpha stimulated the translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), an effect that was not modified by cerivastatin. Furthermore, an inhibitor of NF-kappaB translocation, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate failed to modify both the downregulation of eNOS expression and the increased binding activity of the cytosolic proteins to 3'-UTR of eNOS mRNA by TNF-alpha. The effect of cerivastatin on eNOS expression and the binding activity of the cytosolic proteins were reversed by coincubation with L-mevalonate. In conclusion, cerivastatin stabilized eNOS mRNA and upregulated eNOS expression in the endothelium, and this was associated with a decreased binding activity of cytosolic proteins to 3'-UTR of eNOS mRNA. The effect of cerivastatin on the regulation of eNOS expression was independent of NF-kappaB mobilization by TNF-alpha. These findings suggest that cerivastatin may have beneficial effects on the endothelial dysfunction associated with cardiovascular diseases beyond its effect on lowering cholesterol.", 
    "9": "Blattella germanica has two cytosolic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase genes, HMG-CoA synthase-1 and -2. HMG-CoA synthase-1 gene shows several features of processed genes (retroposons): it contains no introns but has a short direct-repeat sequence (ATTATTATT) at both ends. An atypical feature is the presence at both ends of the gene of short inverse repeats flanked by direct repeats. There is neither a TATA box nor a CAAT box in the 5' region. Comparative analysis with other species suggests that the HMG-CoA synthase-1 gene derives from HMG-CoA synthase-2. Cultured embryonic B. germanica UM-BGE-1 cells express HMG-CoA synthase-1 but not HMG-CoA synthase-2, suggesting that the intron-less gene is functional. In addition, it can complement MEV-1 cell line, which is auxotrophic for mevalonate. We show that compactin and mevalonate do not significantly affect the mRNA levels of HMG-CoA synthase-1 in UM-BGE-1 cells. Compactin induces a 6.7-fold increase in HMG-CoA reductase activity, which is restored to normal levels by mevalonate. HMG-CoA synthase activity is not modified by either of these effectors, suggesting that the mevalonate pathway in this insect cell line is regulated by post-transcriptional mechanisms affecting HMG-CoA reductase but not HMG-CoA synthase.", 
    "10": "Recent studies of hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors have demonstrated that therapy with statins is associated with a significant decrease in the risk of stroke and TIA in patients with coronary artery disease. The underlying mechanism responsible for this effect is unclear. The author presents two patients who had cessation of TIAs upon institution of statin therapy. A variety of non-lipid-lowering mechanisms may account for this beneficial effect. This initial observation, if confirmed by further study, may suggest a role for statin agents in preventing recurrent TIAs.",

Patients who had homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia; type I, III, IV, V, or secondary hyperlipoproteinemia; diabetes; or evidence of liver or renal impairment were excluded. At weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 of the active-treatment period, levels of LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), TG, and total cholesterol (TC) were measured.",

Patients were well matched between groups, with a mean age of approximately 56 years and body mass index of 27 kg/m2; 56.0% of patients (389/695) were female and 97.7% (679/695) were white. Fluvastatin ER 80 mg QPM lowered LDL-C levels significantly more than did fluvastatin IR 40 mg QPM (33.7% vs 24.4%; P < 0.001) and as effectively as fluvastatin IR 40 mg BID (33.9%). More than half of the patients administered fluvastatin ER 80 mg QPM and IR 40 mg BID achieved reductions in LDL-C levels of > or = 35%; more than half of those administered fluvastatin IR 40 mg QPM experienced reductions in LDL-C levels of > or = 25%. The mean reductions in LDL:HDL ratio, TC, and apolipoprotein B levels in the fluvastatin ER 80 mg QPM group were significantly greater than the reductions in the IR 40 mg QPM group (P < 0.001). In patients with mixed dyslipidemia, fluvastatin ER 80 mg reduced triglycerides by 21.8% (median 28%) and increased HDL-C by 14.5%.

    "16": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, or statins, are lipid-lowering agents that have been shown to effectively decrease severe rejection periods and development of transplant coronary artery disease after heart transplantation. Precise regulation of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II) gene expression plays a pivotal role in control of the immune response after transplantation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential role of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in regulating the immune response. We have examined the effects of simvastatin on MHC class II expression in primary human endothelial cells. Using RNAse protection assay and flow cytometry, we observed that simvastatin dose-dependently reduced interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) induced MHC class II expression (mRNA and protein). In contrast, simvastatin did not affect the expression of MHC class I, pointing to specific actions in the MHC class II signalling cascade. The transcriptional coactivator CIITA is the general regulator of both constitutive and inducible MHC class II expression. After stimulation with IFN-gamma, the CIITA gene is selectively activated via one (promotor IV) of its four promoters. Interestingly, mRNA levels of CIITA were decreased after treatment with simvastatin. In addition, using transient transfections of promoter-reporter constructs we observed that the activity of CIITA promoter IV was decreased by simvastatin. In conclusion, simvastatin selectively decreases IFN-gamma-induced MHC class II expression in human primary endothelial cells through actions on the CIITA promoter IV. Thus, the beneficial effects of statins reported after heart transplantation may result from this immunosuppressive action, suggesting possible therapeutic use for other immunological disorders as well.",

ASSESSMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: Both therapies reduced significantly cLDL, TC and triglycerides at the end of the study. Atorvastatin reduced lipids faster than simvastatin at 3 months (p < 0.05), but significant differences could not be observed at 6 months. Atorvastatin reduced cLDL levels by 21.5 +/- 13.2% and 23.8 +/- 13.9% at 3 and 6 months, respectively, versus 16.4 +/- 14.2% and 22.8 +/- 10.8% with simvastatin. By these reductions, 54.2% of patients treated with atorvastatin and 50.0% of those allocated to simvastatin reached therapeutic goals of cLDL control. Atorvastatin 10 mg was more cost-effective than simvastatin 20 mg; 95,406 versus 101,335 pts per patient reaching therapeutic goals, respectively, which means that simvastatin need an extra cost of 24,833 pts per patient reaching therapeutic goals to be as efficient as atorvastatin. Sensitivity analysis to control for uncertainty confirmed the results of cost-effectiveness analysis.",

An independent relationship between HDL cholesterol and CAD was observed in other studies and also suggested by interventional trials. Decreased HDL-C and mildly elevated LDL-C are common in patients with coronary artery disease. Identification of receptors involved in the metabolism of HDL has been the subject of intensive research. The HDL particle may be recognized by different receptors in various tissues. Niacin and fibrate have a remarkable effect on the reduction of triglyceride and elevation of HDL, while their LDL lowering effect is moderate. Statins are effective and safe drugs for CHD, and exert beneficial effects across the lipoprotein profile. Therefore, the effects of statins on HDL-C may contribute to reductions in coronary events.", 
    "23": "Fluvastatin, which is a synthetic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, its metabolites (M2, M3 and M4) and trolox all inhibited the decrease of apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB) and alpha-tocopherol in a radical reaction of human plasma initiated by Cu2+. The concentrations of fluvastatin, M2, M3, M4 and trolox for 50% inhibition (IC50) of apoB fragmentation were 405, 8.55, 1.75, 305, and 43.4 microM, respectively. The IC50 value of pravastatin, which is another HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, was 2880 microM, showing that pravastatin is not an effective antioxidant. Although fluvastatin, its metabolites and trolox inhibited the decrease of alpha-tocopherol in a similar manner to that of apoB, pravastatin did not significantly inhibit the decrease of alpha-tocopherol. Since oxidation of low density lipopotein (LDL) is an important step in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, fluvastatin may reduce the risk of atherosclerosis not only by lowering plasma cholesterol but also by protecting LDL from oxidation.",

Atorvastatin has been shown to induce significant increases in fibrinogen (22% increase; p <0.05) by using the immunonephelometric method. This method also demonstrated that lovastatin use was associated with a 24.4% increase (p < 0.0001) in plasma fibrinogen concentration.

Liver endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was isolated and measured for lipid content and activity of ER enzymes (NK-104: 3 mg/kg, SV: 30 mg/kg). Each statin except CV dose-dependently lowered total cholesterol (TC), with NK-104 showing the greatest effect. Only NK-104 and AV, long-acting statins, significantly lowered triglycerides (TG). A significant reduction of the liver cholesterol content was observed for NK-104 and AV. The liver TG content increased with dose for SV or PV, but not for NK-104 or AV. The TG content in ER and activity of diacylglycerol acyltransferase of ER, increased with SV and slightly with NK-104. Activity of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, which is necessary for both apoB particle formation at rough ER and TG droplet production at smooth ER, increased by SV but not by NK-104. It is suggested that statins with prolonged action lower TG by decreasing cholesterol ester supply necessary for very low density lipoprotein formation and by attenuating an increase in TG production at ER after HMG-CoA reductase inhibition.",

In addition direct beneficial effects of these substances on the vascular wall are discussed. However, progestin addition to estrogen replacement therapy, which is mandatory in women with an intact uterus. is thought to deteriorate at least partly estradiol-induced direct effects on the vasculature. Oxidation of LDL, which mainly takes place in the vessel wall, seems to be a crucial step in the development of atherosclerosis. Therefore, for the first time, the effect of a statin and an estrogen/progestin combination on the in vitro oxidation of human LDL was investigated comparing the monosubstances fluvastatin. 17beta-estradiol and norethisterone acetate (NETA) as well as the effect of the combination. LDL was isolated from human female serum and oxidation was initiated by copper(II)-chloride. The progression of LDL oxidation was monitored spectrometrically at 234 nm for 300 min. Fluvastatin significantly delayed the onset of LDL oxidation (controls = 85 min) by 21 min at 1 microM, by 99 min and by 210 min at 5 and 10 microM. respectively. 17beta-estradiol significantly reduced the onset by 73 min at 1 microM and by more than 300 min at 5 and 10 microM. NETA had no significant effect. The combination of I microM 17beta-estradiol and 1 microM fluvastatin with 1, 5 and 10 microM NETA showed an additive antioxidative effect of estradiol and fluvastatin and no deterioration by the addition of NETA even at high dosages. It can be concluded that treatment of postmenopausal women with fluvastatin and a combination of 17beta-estradiol with NETA may have not only beneficial effects on lipid disorders but may also elicit a direct potent antiatherosclerotic action on the vasculature.",

Prevention starts with good glycaemic control and continues with a comprehensive programme of risk modification, such as lipid-lowering therapy, antihypertensive treatment, and improved lifestyle. With regard to lipid modification, agents such as statins may provide additional, non-lipid effects in both the diabetic and non-diabetic patient. This review discusses recent studies supporting risk reduction, available treatments, and recommendations applicable to the diabetic patient.", 
    "50": "One approach to management of patients with acute coronary syndromes involves use of pharmacologic therapy to passivate plaque for at least 24 hours before interventional procedures are undertaken. This approach is supported by the view that whatever subsequent treatment the patient receives will less likely be complicated. An important factor in revolutionizing treatment for acute coronary syndromes in recent years has been the introduction of potent new antithrombotic and antiplatelet pharmacologic therapies such as low-molecular-weight heparins and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. Incorporation of these newer agents into clinical practice, along with a better understanding of the pathophysiology underlying acute coronary syndromes, has contributed greatly to improved outcomes in these patients. Although the optimal methods for integrating the newer therapies remains to be determined, thus far, they have been shown to lower the risk of acute complications, as well as improve long-term results.", 
    "51": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway, the diverse array of end products of which are vital for a variety of cellular functions, including cholesterol synthesis and cell cycle progression. We showed previously that this enzyme holds a critical role in regulating tumor cell fate, including cell death, as its expression is down-regulated in response to retinoic acid, a potent anticancer therapeutic. Indeed, direct inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase with lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of this enzyme, induced a pronounced apoptotic response in neuroblastoma and acute myeloid leukemic cells. We have now extended this work and evaluated a wide variety and large number of tumor-derived cell lines for their sensitivity to lovastatin-induced apoptosis. These cell lines were exposed to a wide range (0-100 microM) of lovastatin for 2 days and assayed for cell viability using the 3,4,5-dimethyl thiazlyl-2,2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and the induction of apoptosis by flow cytometric and ultrastructural analyses. Lovastatin induced a pronounced apoptotic response in cells derived from juvenile monomyelocytic leukemia, pediatric solid malignancies (rhabdomyosarcoma and medulloblastoma), and squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix and of the head and neck. Interestingly, the subset of malignancies that are particularly sensitive to lovastatin-induced apoptosis correspond to those tumor subtypes that are sensitive to the biological and antiproliferative effects of retinoids in vitro. The nature of the biologically active form of lovastatin has been challenged recently as the growth-inhibitory effects of this drug were attributed to its prodrug lactone form that does not inhibit HMG-CoA reductase function. In this report, we demonstrate that the apoptotic properties of lovastatin are triggered by the open ring acid form that is a potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase activity. Thus, we have identified a subset of tumors that are sensitive to lovastatin-induced apoptosis and show HMG-CoA reductase as a potential therapeutic target of these cancers.", 
    "52": "Adrenoleukodystrophy is a paroxysmal disorder, with recessive linking to the X chromosome, characterized biochemically by the accumulation of extra-long-chain fatty acids. Six phenotypes are distinguished: pre-symptomatic, infantile, adolescent and adult cerebral forms, adrenomyeloneuropathy and isolated Addison's disease. We describe a patient with adrenomyeloneuropathy in whom the presenting symptom was lumbago.", 
    "53": "A 23 year old man with no significant previous clinical history complained of having lumbago for over two years. On examination he had pyramidal signs and reduced epicritic sensitivity of the legs. Laboratory investigations showed adrenal failure, increased plasma extra-long-chain fatty acids concentration, mononuclear cells and fibroblasts. On MR there was a hyperintense lesion of the genu of the corpus callosum. SSEP were pathological while the electroneurogram showed bilateral increase in latency of the F wave. The patient was diagnosed as having adrenomyeloneuropathy and treatment started with hydrocortisone, a diet low in extra-long-chain fatty acids and 'Lorenzo's oil'. The lumbago gradually disappeared while the plasma extra-long-chain fatty acids concentration dropped. The oil was stopped because of moderate thrombocytopenia, and treatment was started with lovastatin 40 mg/day. Two years later the patient has no lumbago and is neurologically stable.", 
    "54": "The lumbago associated with adrenomyeloneuropathy is probably due to demyelination of the spinal tracts. Although lumbago is usually a benign condition, a careful history and examination is necessary in all such cases.",

This study demonstrates that atorvastatin, at a daily dose of 80 mg starting within the first 24 to 96 hours after an acute coronary event (unstable angina or non-Q-wave acute myocardial infarction) and maintained for 4 months, improves the cardiovascular prognosis by decreasing the combined risk of death (any cause), nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest and worsening angina with new objective evidence of ischemia requiring urgent hospitalization (-16% versus placebo, p < 0.05).", 
    "56": "Previous studies have suggested that statins exert beneficial effects beyond their favorable lipid lowering effect. Particularly, the modification of thrombus formation and degradation, alteration in inflammatory response, plaque stabilization and improved endothelial function are thought to be responsible for additional reduction of morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular events. To date, however, it is still unclear whether these effects are elicited by all statins.", 
    "57": "We set out to compare in a controlled, randomized, double-blind study design the effects of almost equieffective cholesterol lowering doses of three chemically and pharmacokinetically different statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin) on hemostatic and inflammatory markers in 99 hypercholesterolemic patients. At entry and 3 months after onset of statin therapy plasma cholesterol and von Willebrand factor antigen (vWf-Ag), fibrinogen, d-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1.2) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured. The effect on plasma values of F1.2, vWf-Ag, d-dimer and CRP was not significantly different between the three treatment groups. The effect of simvastatin on fibrinogen (p = 0.005) was more pronounced than the effects of atorvastatin (p = 0.48 n.s.) and pravastatin (p = 0.15 n.s.). Plasma levels of F1.2 and vWf-Ag (when data of all statins were pooled) were significantly reduced by 7% and 10% versus baseline, respectively. No significant reduction was observed for d-dimer (p = 0.26) and CRP (p = 0.5). Total plasma cholesterol levels decreased significantly (p < 0.0001 in all groups) between 22% and 29% compared to baseline.", 
    "58": "The present study shows similar short-term (3 months) effects of atorvastatin, simvastatin and pravastatin on selected hemostatic and inflammatory parameters in plasma in patients with hypercholesterolemia.

The primary objective of PHYLLIS is investigating whether in these patients administration of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, fosinopril, and a statin, pravastatin, is more effective than administration of a diuretic and a lipid-lowering diet in retarding or regressing alterations in carotid IMT. While the study is in progress, baseline data are here reported to clarify the association of various risk factors with carotid IMT in these medium-high risk hypertensive patients.",

Age was (mean +/- SD) 58.4 +/- 6.7 years, males were 40.2%, current smokers 16.5%, means +/- SD of serum total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides concentrations were 6.79 +/- 0.67, 4.69 +/- 0.51, 1.37 +/- 0.38, 1.59 +/- 0.64 mmol/l (262.4 +/- 25.8, 181.3 +/- 19.8, 53.0 +/- 14.6, 141.0 +/- 56.7 mg/ dl). Means +/- SD of clinic sitting SBP/DBP were 159.8 +/- 9.0/98.3 +/- 4.2 mmHg. 483 of the 508 patients also had 24 h ambulatory BP monitoring, edited and read at a centralized unit (mean +/- SD 24 h SBP/DBP averages 136.3 +/- 14.1/84.0 +/- 10.0 mmHg). Quantitative B-mode ultrasound (Biosound 2000 II 5A, Biosound, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA) recordings of carotid arteries were taken by certified sonographers in the peripheral units and tracings were all read at a central unit. CBMmax (mean IMT of eight sites at common carotids and bifurcations) was 1.21 +/- 0.17; Mmax (mean of 12 sites also including internal carotids) 1.16 +/- 0.17, and Tmax (single maximum) 1.85 +/- 0.48 mm.",

No measurement of DBP was ever associated with any IMT measurement. Likewise, no lipid variable was found associated with any IMT measurement.", 
    "62": "Baseline data from PHYLLIS indicate that in this population of hypertensive patients with moderate hypercholesterolaemia, SBP and PP are with age among the most significant factors associated with carotid artery alterations. However, the narrow range of inclusion LDL-cholesterol and DBP values may have obscured an additional role of these variables.", 
    "63": "Primary and secondary prevention trials have shown that use of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (also known as statins) to lower an elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level can substantially reduce coronary events and death from coronary heart disease. In 1987 and 1993, the National Cholesterol Education Program promulgated guidelines for cholesterol screening and treatment. Thus far, however, primary care physicians have inadequately adopted these guidelines in clinical practice. A 1991 study found that cholesterol screening was performed in only 23 percent of patients. Consequently, many patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein levels and a high risk of primary or recurrent ischemic events remain unidentified and untreated. A study published in 1998 found that fewer than 15 percent of patients with known coronary heart disease have low-density lipoprotein levels at the recommended level of below 100 mg per dL (2.60 mmol per L). By identifying patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein levels and instituting appropriate lipid-lowering therapy, family physicians could help prevent cardiovascular events and death in many of their patients.", 
    "64": "We investigated the antioxidative effects of fluvastatin (FV or (+/-)-FV), each enantiomer ((+)-FV, (-)-FV) and its major metabolites on lipid peroxidation using rat and human liver microsomes. The extent of NADPH induced microsomal (Ms) lipid peroxidation was determined by thiobarbituric acid (TBA) assay. The antioxidative effect of each compound was shown as the percentage of inhibition on the formation of TBA reactive substance (TBARS) against vehicle control. The antioxidative effects of alpha-tocopherol (Toc), a potent antioxidative vitamin, probucol (PR), a potent antioxidative drug, pravastatin (PV) and simvastatin (SV), HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, were also tested. The (+/-)-FV inhibit the formation of TBARS by 40 to 70% depending on Ms concentrations. The antioxidative effects of PR and TOC were comparable to those of FV. The inhibitory effects of PV and SV on the formation of TBARS were less potent than (+/-)-FV, PR and TOC. (+)-FV, (-)-FV, and (+/-)-FV inhibited the formation of TBARS by approximately 50% using rat hepatic microsomes. The antioxidative effects of (+)-FV was comparable to that of (-)-FV using human hepatic microsomes. These results indicated that the antioxidative effects of (+)-FV were comparable to those of (-)-FV, although the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity of (+)-FV was 30-fold higher than that of (-)-FV.", 
    "65": "Oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL) has a major impact in the development of atherosclerosis. Risk for oxidative modification of LDL is usually determined indirectly by measuring the capability of LDL to resist radical insult. We compared three different methods quantifying the antioxidative capacity of LDL ex vivo in dyslipidemic patients with coronary heart disease. Plasma samples were obtained from two double-blinded cross-over trials. The duration of all interventions (placebo, lovastatin 60 mg/day, RRR-alpha-tocopherol 300 mg/day and lovastatin + RRR-alpha-tocopherol combined) was 6 weeks. The total radical capturing capacity of LDL (TRAP) in plasma was determined using 2,2-azo-bis(2,4-dimethyl-valeronitrile) (AMVN) -induced oxidation, and measuring the extinction time of chemiluminescence. TRAP was compared to the variables characterizing formation of conjugated dienes in copper-induced oxidation. Also the initial concentrations and consumption times of reduced alpha-tocopherol (alpha-TOH) and ubiquinol in AMVN-induced oxidation were determined. Repeatability of TRAP was comparable to that of the lag time in conjugated diene formation. Coefficient of variation within TRAP assay was 4.4% and between TRAP assays 5.9%. Tocopherol supplementation produced statistically significant changes in all antioxidant variables except those related to LDL ubiquinol. TRAP increased by 57%, the lag time in conjugated diene formation by 34% and consumption time of alpha-TOH by 88%. When data of all interventions were included in the analyses, TRAP correlated with the lag time (r = 0.75, p < 10(-6)), with LDL alpha-TOH (r = 0.50, p < 0.001) and with the consumption time of alpha-TOH (r = 0.58, p < 0.0001). In the baseline data, the associations between different antioxidant variables were weaker. TRAP correlated with the lag time (r = 0.55, p < 0.001) and alpha-TOH consumption time (r = 0.48, p < 0.05), and inversely with apolipoprotein Al (r = -0.51, p < 0.05). Lag time at the baseline did not correlate with ubiquinol or tocopherol parameters, or with any plasma lipid or lipoprotein levels analyzed. Lovastatin treatment did not significantly affect the antioxidant capacity of LDL. In conclusion, TRAP reflects slightly different properties of LDL compared to the lag time. Thus, LDL TRAP assay may complement the other methods used to quantify the antioxidant capacity of LDL. However, TRAP and the lag time react similarly to vitamin E supplementation.", 
    "66": "Inflammation plays a key role in susceptibility to coronary atherosclerosis and response to therapy. A diverse array of factors modulates inflammation, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and CD14 receptors on the surface of macrophages. Genes encoding for inflammatory markers have variants that regulate their expression and are potential risk factors for atherosclerosis. We prospectively analyzed the possible association of CD14 -260C/T, TNF-alpha -308G/A, and IL-6 -174G/C variants, located in the promoter regions, with the severity, progression, and response to therapy of coronary atherosclerosis in a well-characterized cohort. We studied 375 subjects enrolled in the Lipoprotein and Coronary Atherosclerosis Study (LCAS). Genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction mapping. Fasting plasma lipids and quantitative coronary angiograms were obtained at baseline and 2.5 years following randomization to fluvastatin or placebo. Distributions of genotypes were--for CD14: 100 CC, 184 CT, and 86 TT; IL-6: 152 GG, 153 GC, and 62 CC; and TNF-alpha: 244 GG, 110 GA, and 17 AA. The CD14 CC genotype was associated with incidence of new coronary occlusion (P=0.026); TNF-alpha AA genotype with history of myocardial infarction (MI, P=0.04), and A allele with total occlusions at baseline (P=0.027), and systolic blood pressure (P=0.046); and IL-6-174 CC genotype with baseline minimum lumen diameter (P=0.043) and reduction in lipoprotein(a) with fluvastatin (P=0.03). Otherwise, no association between the genotypes and the biochemical, angiographic, and clinical phenotypes was detected, and neither were genotype-treatment interactions. Functional variants of CD14 -260C/T, TNF-alpha -308G/A, and IL-6 -174G/C, implicated in the susceptibility to infection, are unlikely to confer major risk for susceptibility to coronary atherosclerosis and its progression or response to therapy in the LCAS population.",

    "68": "To an increasing degree, cardiology and endocrinology are finding a broadening interface. There is little doubt that atherosclerosis is in many ways a metabolic disorder, just as it is becoming increasingly clear that diabetes is a vascular disease. Framing such notions is evidence of diabetes as a risk equivalent for coronary disease, and clinical cardiovascular trials demonstrate the impact of altering lipid metabolism. Although the focus has been on statins and LDL, data continues to emerge for other therapies for triglycerides and HDL. These issues are discussed, as are future directions for metabolic therapeutic interventions for vascular disease.", 
    "69": "This article reviews the rationale for lipid lowering in patients who have coronary heart disease, and specifically for post-bypass patients. It has been well demonstrated that after coronary artery bypass graft surgery, atherosclerosis continues to progress in the native circulation and develops at an accelerated rate in saphenous vein bypass grafts. During the last decade, numerous clinical trials based on angiographic or clinical outcomes have clearly shown the beneficial effect of lipid lowering in coronary heart disease. Three trials (CLAS, post-CABG, and CARE) have demonstrated delayed progression of atherosclerosis in SVGs and/or a reduction of cardiac deaths, nonfatal MI, and the need for revascularization after lowering LDL-cholesterol. The recommended target of LDL cholesterol level of more than 100 mg/dl can be safely reached with diet and monotherapy using one of the statin drugs (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors). Despite this widely-circulated information, there appears to be inadequate public and professional awareness of the importance of properly managing hyperlipidemia after coronary artery bypass graft surgery.",

About three weeks prior to admission, the patient was started on clarithromycin for sinusitis. The patient had been receiving simvastatin for approximately six months. He was treated aggressively with intravenous hydration, sodium bicarbonate, and hemodialysis. A muscle biopsy revealed necrotizing myopathy secondary to a toxin. The patient continued to receive intermittent hemodialysis until his death from infectious complications that occurred three months after admission. There were several factors that could have increased his risk for developing rhabdomyolysis, including chronic renal failure.", 
    "72": "Clarithromycin is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, the major enzyme responsible for simvastatin metabolism. The concomitant administration of macrolide antibiotics and other hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors have resulted in previous reports of rhabdomyolysis. Other factors may increase the risk of this drug interaction, including the administration of other medications that are associated with myopathy, underlying renal insufficiency, and administration of high doses of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.", 
    "73": "Macrolide antibiotics inhibit the metabolism of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are metabolized by CYP3A4 (i.e., atorvastatin, cerivastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin). This interaction may result in myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, particularly in patients with renal insufficiency or those who are concurrently taking medications associated with myopathy.", 
    "74": "Thrombosis is a complication of atherosclerosis and monocytes play a determinant role either in the progression of atherosclerotic plaque or in blood coagulation by way of tissue factor expression. Platelets play a direct role in thrombosis and a hyperfunctional state has been described in hypercholesterolemic subjects. Moreover, platelets seem to be able to enhance monocyte activity. Cholesterol-lowering molecules (statins) are reported to reduce cardiovascular risk, either by decreasing the circulating level of cholesterol or by non-lipidic actions such as the reduction of monocyte and platelet activity. The aim of our study was to investigate the influence of platelets on the expression of tissue factor by monocytes and the effect induced by cerivastatin. We measured tissue factor levels by ELISA and the procoagulant activity of stimulated monocytes by a clotting assay on cellular preparations and whole blood in 40 hypercholesterolemic subjects (22 male, 18 female, mean age 52.7 +/- 12 years, total cholesterol 251.6 +/- 19.9 mg/dl) before and after cerivastatin addition. Tissue factor expression was enhanced in hypercholesterolemic subjects compared with normal subjects (31.6 +/- 7.6 vs. 23 +/- 5.8 pg/cells, P < 0.01). The presence of platelets increased the amount of tissue factor (55.3 +/- 7.3 pg/cells, P < 0.001) and cerivastatin reduced the expression of tissue factor in isolated monocytes, in the mixed cellular system, and in whole blood (19.6 +/- 4.1 pg/cells, P < 0.001). In conclusion, tissue factor expression by monocytes is enhanced in hypercholesterolemic subjects compared with normal controls. Platelets enhance monocyte production of tissue factor, and cerivastatin is able to counteract this prothrombotic mechanism.",

    "79": "Pravastatin, one of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) widely used in the management of hypercholesterolaemia, has unique pharmacokinetic characteristics among the members of this class. Many in vivo and in vitro human and animal studies suggest that active transport mechanisms are involved in the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin. The oral bioavailability of pravastatin is low because of incomplete absorption and a first-pass effect. The drug is rapidly absorbed from the upper part of the small intestine, probably via proton-coupled carrier-mediated transport, and then taken up by the liver by a sodium-independent bile acid transporter. About half of the pravastatin that reaches the liver via the portal vein is extracted by the liver, and this hepatic extraction is mainly attributed to biliary excretion which is performed by a primary active transport mechanism. The major metabolites are produced by chemical degradation in the stomach rather than by cytochrome P450-dependent metabolism in the liver. The intact drug and its metabolites are cleared through both hepatic and renal routes, and tubular secretion is a predominant mechanism in renal excretion. The dual routes of pravastatin elimination reduce the need for dosage adjustment if the function of either the liver or kidney is impaired, and also reduce the possibility of drug interactions compared with other statins. which are largely eliminated by metabolism. The lower protein binding than other statins weakens the tendency for displacement of highly protein-bound drugs. Although all statins show a hepatoselective disposition, the mechanism for pravastatin is different from that of the others. There is high uptake of pravastatin by the liver via an active transport mechanism, but not by other tissues because of its hydrophilicity, whereas the disposition characteristics of other statins result from high hepatic extraction because of high lipophilicity. These pharmacokinetic properties of pravastatin may be the result of the drug being given in the pharmacologically active open hydroxy acid form and the fact that its hydrophilicity is markedly higher than that of other statins. The nature of the pravastatin transporters, particularly in humans, remains unknown at present. Further mechanistic studies are required to establish the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships of pravastatin and to provide the optimal therapeutic efficacy for various types of patients with hypercholesterolaemia.", 
    "80": "Several observational studies indicate that reduction of serum cholesterol levels is related to an increase in violent deaths and suicide but the nature of this possible relationship remains unclear. Many confounding factors, e.g. poor health, depression and loss of appetite may play a role in the apparent relationship between serum cholesterol levels and suicide. Two separate phenomena should be considered: lowering total cholesterol and low total cholesterol. This review considers the evidence from epidemiological studies on serum cholesterol lowering and psychiatric disturbances. The available evidence does not seem to substantiate the view that large-scale intervention to reduce cholesterol concentrations could lead to more violent and aggressive behaviour, and generally greater unhappiness. In recent trials using statin treatment, there were slightly fewer deaths from accidents and suicide in the treated group compared with the placebo group. We believe that clinicians should not be deterred from prescribing cholesterol-lowering drugs, to reduce the risk of death from coronary heart disease, when they are indicated.",

    "82": "The effectiveness and safety of simvastatin in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to target levels in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) were evaluated in the GOALLS (Getting to Appropriate LDL-C Levels with Simvastatin) study. This multinational, multicentre, prospective, open-label, study consisted of a six-week diet washout period followed by a 14-week titrate-to-goal treatment period with simvastatin. One hundred and ninety-eight men and women with documented CHD and a fasting LDL-C level between 115 mg/dl (3.0 mmol/l) and 180 mg/dl (4.7 mmol/l) and triglycerides (TGs) < or = 400 mg/dl (4.5 mmol/l) were enrolled. The patients were started on 20 mg simvastatin with dose titration up to 80 mg if the LDL-C remained above 100 mg/dl at weeks 6 and 10. The key efficacy parameters were the percentage of patients achieving US and European LDL-C goals [< or = 100 mg/dl (2.6 mmol/l) and < or = 115 mg/dl (3.0 mmol/l), respectively]. Safety was evaluated by monitoring laboratory tests and recording adverse events. After 14 weeks of simvastatin (20-80 mg) treatment, approximately 90% of the patients achieved LDL-C goals according to US (87%) and European (94%) guidelines. Most patients (72-93%) achieved target LDL-C levels on 20 mg simvastatin. An estimated 14% of the patients required titration to the 80 mg dose. Treatment with simvastatin (20-80 mg) produced statistically significant improvements in all measured lipid variables by the end of the study. The mean reductions in total cholesterol and LDL-C, and the median reduction in TG, were 28%, 41% and 16%, respectively. The increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-1 were 5% and 4%, respectively. Simvastatin was well tolerated across the dosage range. In conclusion, simvastatin, 20-80 mg/day, was safe and highly effective at reducing LDL-C levels. The recommended US and European LDL-C treatment goals were achieved in approximately 90% of the patients. These goals were similarly achieved for a variety of high-risk sub-groups (hypertensives, diabetics and elderly patients).",

It lowered plasma total cholesterol (TC, 7-20%) and triglyceride (TG, 16-39%) levels throughout the experimental period due to a significant reduction of very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C, 61-62%, p < 0.05), intermediate density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDL-C, 49-60%, p < 0.05), VLDL-TG (40-53%, p = 0.06-0.08) and IDL-TG (29-59%, p = 0.06-0.14); low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was not affected. The pattern of the lipoprotein reduction along with a decrease in liver cholesteryl ester (CE, 33.1%, p < 0.01) suggests an intense reduction of VLDL secretion and a marginal induction of LDL-receptor. Enhanced expression of LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) in the liver was observed at mRNA levels (49.5% increase, P = 0.13), which might play a role in the lipoprotein reduction. Histological analyses of aorta revealed that aortic arch showed the most advanced lesions with larger lesion area (70.0 vs 41.3%) and much greater CE content (more than 2 fold) with less macrophages than thoracic aorta. NK-104 decreased the surface lesion area at the arch (23.1%, p = 0.054) and reduced the degeneration of media in the thoracic aorta (69.9% increase in medial smooth muscle cells, p < 0.01). Thus NK-104 preferentially reduced TG-rich lipoproteins (VLDL and IDL) without affecting LDL-C levels and prevented progression of atherosclerosis in WHHL rabbits.", 
    "88": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of cholestyramine in combination with statins on vitamin E levels and their concentration related to LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients with hyperlipidemia. In an open-label, randomized study of 25 patients with elevated LDL-C, 12 received cholestyramine (12 g/d) in addition to chronic statin therapy, which had been started at least 8 weeks prior to the study in all patients. At the start and end of the 12-week study period, vitamin E concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography and cholesterol and triglycerides enzymatically in all patients. Vitamin E levels remained virtually unchanged within normal range before (11.90 +/- 0.71 mg/l) and after 12 weeks (11.69 +/- 0.82 mg/l) of concomitant therapy with cholestyramine. However, the ratio of vitamin E/LDL-C increased from 7.48 +/- 0.56 to 8.58 +/- 0.75 (x 10(-2)) (p < 0.09) in the cholestyramine group but not in the control group. LDL-C concentrations decreased from 162.00 +/- 5.98 to 144.33 +/- 12.48 mg/dl. The authors conclude that cholestyramine 12 g/d given for 12 weeks in addition to chronic statin therapy did not lower vitamin E levels in hyperlipemic patients. However, antioxidant status (vitamin E/LDL-C ratio) seems to be improved by a cholestyramine-associated LDL-C decrease.", 
    "89": "Hypersensitive response (HR), a form of programmed cell death, is frequently associated with plant disease resistance. It has been proposed that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades regulate HR cell death based on pharmacological studies by using kinase inhibitors. However, direct evidence is lacking. Here, we demonstrate that NtMEK2, a MAPK kinase, is upstream of salicylic acid-induced protein kinase (SIPK) and wounding-induced protein kinase (WIPK), two tobacco MAPKs that are activated by various pathogens or pathogen-derived elicitors. Expression of a constitutively active mutant of NtMEK2 induces HR-like cell death in tobacco, which is preceded by the activation of endogenous SIPK and WIPK. In addition, NtMEK2-SIPK/WIPK cascade appears to control the expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGR) and l-phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), two defense genes encoding key enzymes in the phytoalexin and salicylic acid biosynthesis pathways. These results demonstrate that a plant MAPK cascade controls multiple defense responses against pathogen invasion.",

The aim of this study was to test the efficacy and possible drug-drug interactions of the new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) atorvastatin and cerivastatin in cyclosporin A (CsA)-treated renal transplant patients. Subjects and methods. Thirty patients with stable graft function and LDL cholesterol of 130 mg/dl were randomly assigned to active treatment groups (10 mg atorvastatin or 0.2 mg cerivastatin), or a control group. CsA blood trough levels were controlled on a weekly basis and adapted if they changed more than 25% from baseline values (100-150 ng/ml). Lipid levels and routine laboratory parameters before and after a treatment period of 3 months were compared.", 
    "91": "In the group treated with cerivastatin no significant changes in CsA blood trough levels occurred (CsA 116+/-21 ng/ml vs 110+/-20 ng/ml). In contrast, in the group treated with atorvastatin, four of 10 patients had a rise in CsA blood trough levels of more than 25% within 7-14 days of starting therapy. In the remaining patients no significant changes in CsA drug levels occurred. After therapy with atorvastatin or cerivastatin, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were significantly lower compared with baseline conditions. No changes of CsA or lipoprotein levels were present in the control group.", 
    "92": "In our study population both statins were very effective in lowering elevated LDL cholesterol levels. Cerivastatin did not influence CsA blood trough levels, whereas atorvastatin increased CsA levels in four of 10 patients. Further research in a larger study is necessary in order to confirm these results and to investigate the possible reasons for this drug interaction.", 
    "93": "One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the abnormal state of tau. It is both highly phosphorylated and aggregated into paired helical filaments (PHFs) in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). However, the mechanism underlying the hyperphosphorylation of tau in NFTs and neuronal degeneration in AD remains to be elucidated. The fact that hyperphosphorylation of tau in NFTs are also found in the patients with Niemann-Pick disease, type C (NPC), which is a cholesterol storage disease associated with defective intracellular trafficking of exogenous cholesterol, implies that perturbation of cholesterol metabolism may be involved in tau phosphorylation and neurodegeneration. Here, we report that cholesterol deficiency induced by inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis in cultured neurons results in hyperphosphorylation of tau, accompanied by axonal degeneration associated with microtubule depolymerization. These changes were prevented by concurrent treatment with beta-migrating very low-density lipoprotein (beta-VLDL) or cholesterol. We propose that intracellular cholesterol plays an essential role in the modulation of tau phosphorylation and the maintenance of microtubule stability.",

Lipid lowering with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors reduces acute coronary events.", 
    "95": "To test whether lipid lowering with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor retards macrophage accumulation in rabbit atheroma, we administered cerivastatin to immature Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits (cerivastatin group, n=10, cerivastatin 0.6 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1); control group, n=9, saline 0.6 mL x kg(-1) x d(-1)) for 32 weeks and measured macrophage accumulation and expression of MMPs and TF. Serum cholesterol levels after 32 weeks were 809+/-40 mg/dL (control group) and 481+/-24 mg/dL (treated group). Cerivastatin diminished accumulation of macrophages in aortic atheroma. Macrophage expression of MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, and TF also decreased with cerivastatin treatment. Cerivastatin reduced the number of macrophages expressing histone mRNA (a sensitive marker of cell proliferation) detected by in situ hybridization but did not alter macrophages bearing a marker of death (TUNEL staining). Cerivastatin treatment (>or=0.01 micromol/L) also reduced growth, proteolytic activity due to MMP-9, and TF expression in cultured human monocyte/macrophages.",

    "97": "We studied the role of cholesterol in regulated protein secretion in neuroendocrine cells by manipulating the cholesterol content of AtT-20 cells. Depletion of cellular cholesterol levels caused a reversible block of immature secretory granule biogenesis at the level of the trans-Golgi-network, whereas increased cholesterol levels promoted immature secretory granule formation. Cholesterol depletion also blocked the formation of constitutive secretory vesicles, but did not inhibit the transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex. Our results indicate that the assembly of cholesterol-based lipid microdomains is required for the biogenesis of both regulated and constitutive secretory vesicles from the trans-Golgi-network in neuroendocrine cells.", 
    "98": "Policosanol is a cholesterol-lowering drug isolated from sugar cane wax, which acts by inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis. Previous studies have demonstrated that policosanol inhibited smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation in the cuffed carotid artery of the rabbit and in arterial wall damage induced by forceps in the central artery of the ear of rabbits. The present study was undertaken to compare the effects of policosanol and lovastatin on SMC proliferation in the cuffed carotid artery of rabbits. Collars were placed around the left carotid for 7 and 15 days. The contralateral artery was sham operated. We studied eight experimental groups: two controls groups receiving vehicle for 7 and 15 days, respectively, a satellite sham operated control group, four groups treated with policosanol at 5 and 25 mg kg(-1)for 7 and 15 days and a reference group receiving lovastatin at 20 mg kg(-1)for 15 days. Samples of arteries were examined by light and electron microscopy. To evaluate intimal thickening the cross-sectional areas of intima and media were measured. Neointima was significantly reduced in treated animals compared with controls, but the reduction in lovastatin animals was significantly lower than in policosanol-treated groups. The SMC proliferation was studied by the immunohistochemical detection of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and the reduction observed in policosanol-treated rabbits was significantly larger than in lovastatin-treated animals. It is concluded that the protective effect of policosanol against neointima formation in this experimental model was slightly better than that of lovastatin.", 
    "99": "Beneficial effects of statins in preventing cardiovascular events may depend, at least in part, on their anti-inflammatory action.

In the former group, these markers of inflammation were also measured before and after a 2-week treatment with aspirin (300 mg/d), implemented prior to and in combination with simvastatin. A distinct reduction of CRP and TNF-alpha was found in both groups; IL-6 levels were decreased only in subjects with marked hypercholesterolemia. Aspirin had no effect on the anti-inflammatory action of simvastatin.",

    "102": "The effects of feeding cholesterol, sitosterol, and lovastatin on cholesterol absorption, biosynthesis, esterification, and LDL receptor function were examined in the rat jejunal mucosa. Cholesterol absorption was measured by the dual-isotope plasma ratio method; the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, was measured as total and expressed enzyme activities (in the absence and presence of a phosphatase inhibitor, NaF, respectively); mucosal total and esterified cholesterol concentrations were determined by gas-liquid chromatography; LDL receptor function was assayed as receptor-mediated binding of (125)I-labeled LDL to mucosal membranes. Feeding 2% sitosterol or 0.04% lovastatin for 1 week significantly (P < 0.01) decreased the amounts of cholesterol absorbed per day (-85% and -63%, respectively). In contrast, feeding 2% cholesterol for 1 week increased the amounts of absorbed cholesterol 27-fold, even though the percent absorption significantly decreased. With all three treatments, there was a coordinate regulation of total HMG-CoA reductase activity and receptor-mediated LDL binding. Cholesterol feeding downregulated both total jejunal HMG-CoA reductase activity (P < 0.05) and receptor-mediated LDL binding (P < 0.01), whereas lovastatin- and sitosterol-supplemented diets significantly upregulated both of these parameters. In the control, cholesterol-fed, and sitosterol-fed animals, about half of the total jejunal HMG-CoA reductase activity was expressed (in functional dephosphorylated form). However, in the lovastatin-treated rats with 4-fold stimulation of HMG-CoA reductase, only 23% of the total enzyme activity was expressed. Changes in total HMG-CoA reductase activity and receptor-mediated LDL binding in all tested groups occurred with no change in total concentrations of mucosal cholesterol, and only cholesterol-fed animals had increased mucosal esterified cholesterol concentrations. Thus, in response to various fluxes of dietary or newly formed cholesterol, HMG-CoA reductase and receptor-mediated LDL binding are coordinately regulated to maintain constant cellular cholesterol concentrations in the jejunum.", 
    "103": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can be divided into two groups: those administered as the prodrug, i.e., the lactone form (e.g., simvastatin and lovastatin), and those administered in the active form, i.e., the acid form (e.g., pravastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, and cerivastatin). In this study, the influence of the lactone and acid forms of various HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on metabolism by CYP3A4, a major cytochrome P450 isoform in human liver, was investigated by determining the in vitro inhibition constant (K(i) value) using an antianxiety agent, mexazolam, as a probe substrate. In human liver microsomes, all the lactone forms tested inhibited the oxidative metabolism of mexazolam more strongly than did the acid forms, which have lower partition coefficient (logD(7.0)) values. In addition, the degree of inhibition of mexazolam metabolism tended to increase with an increasing logD(7.0) value of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors among the lactone and acid forms. In particular, pravastatin (acid form), which has the lowest logD(7.0) value, failed to inhibit CYP3A4 activity. Taking account of the lipophilicity of the inhibitors, in conjunction with the CYP3A4-inhibitory activity, could be very useful in predicting drug interactions between substrates of CYP3A4 and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.", 
    "104": "Acute coronary syndromes often result from rupture of vulnerable plaques. The collagen content of plaques probably regulates their stability.

The fluvastatin group achieved a much higher peak plasma concentration (23.7 micromol/L) than did the pravastatin group (1.3 micromol/L) under these conditions. Immunohistochemistry revealed that MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-9 expression by macrophages in the intima was lower in both the pravastatin and fluvastatin groups than in the placebo group, whereas there was no difference in macrophage numbers. Numbers of intimal smooth muscle cells (SMCs) (identified by immunohistochemistry) and expression of type I procollagen mRNA (detected by in situ hybridization), however, were significantly higher in the pravastatin group than in the fluvastatin group. Treatment with pravastatin, but not fluvastatin, preserved interstitial collagen content in vivo (detected by picrosirius red polarization). In vitro, fluvastatin, but not pravastatin, decreased numbers of rabbit and human aortic SMCs without altering procollagen I mRNA expression.",

The objective of the present study was to elucidate the role of p27 in butyrate-induced differentiation of the human colorectal carcinoma cell line Caco-2. In this report we show that in spite of the increase in p27 protein expression after incubation with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor mevastatin, alkaline phosphatase activity decreases significantly in this cell line. In addition, mevastatin caused a significant increase in the cell cycle inhibitor p21. All effects could be reversed by addition of mevalonate to the medium. Taken together, we provide the first evidence that in Caco-2 cells p27 may have other functions apart from the regulation of cell differentiation.", 
    "115": "The fragmentation mechanism of simvastatin and lovastatin was investigated using both triple quadrupole and ion trap mass spectrometers. The elimination of the ester side-chain followed by dehydration and dissociation of the lactone moiety were observed as the main fragmentation pathways for both compounds. Another major fragmentation process was a C==C double-bond facilitated rearrangement. Our tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) data suggested that the beta-hydroxy group was involved in the fragmentation by interacting with the carboxyl group generated from the ring opening of the lactone. As a result, a facile neutral loss of 60 Da (CH(3)COOH or a combination of CH(2)==C==O and H(2)O) was detected. MS/MS studies of the structural analogs also provided evidence that the dehydration of the beta-hydroxy lactone generated preferentially the beta,gamma-unsaturated lactones.",

Also the peak concentrations of both simvastatin and simvastatin acid were reduced greatly (by 90%) by rifampin (P < .001). On the other hand, rifampin had no significant effect on the elimination half-life of simvastatin or simvastatin acid.", 
    "119": "Rifampin greatly decreases the plasma concentrations of simvastatin and simvastatin acid. Because the elimination half-life of simvastatin was not affected by rifampin, induction of the CYP3A4-mediated first-pass metabolism of simvastatin in the intestine and the liver probably explains this interaction. Concomitant use of potent inducers of CYP3A4 can lead to a considerably reduced cholesterol-lowering efficacy of simvastatin.", 
    "120": "The cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase gene (CYP7A1) plays an important role in regulation of bile acid biosynthesis and cholesterol homeostasis. Oxysterol receptor, LXR, stimulates, whereas the bile acid receptor, FXR, inhibits CYP7A1 transcription. The goal of this study was to investigate the role of LXRalpha on the regulation of rat, human and hamster CYP7A1 transcription in its native promoter and cellular context. Cotransfection with LXRalpha and RXRalpha expression plasmids strongly stimulated rat CYP7A1/luciferase reporter activity in HepG2 cells and oxysterol was not required. However, LXRalpha had much less effect on hamster and no significant effect on human CYP7A1 promoter activity in HepG2 cells. In Chinese hamster ovary cells, cotransfection with LXRalpha stimulated reporter activity by less than 2-fold and addition of 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol caused a small but significant stimulation of rat, human and hamster CYP7A1 promoter activity. At least two direct repeats of AGGTCA-like sequences with 4-base spacing (DR4) and five-base spacing (DR5), in previously identified bile acid response elements of the rat CYP7A1 were able to bind LXRalpha/RXRalpha and confer LXRalpha stimulation. However, LXRalpha did not bind to the corresponding sequences of the human gene and bound weakly to hamster and mouse DR4 sequences. Therefore, rats and mice have the unusual capacity to convert cholesterol to bile acids by LXRalpha-mediated stimulation of CYP7A1 transcription, whereas other species do not respond to cholesterol and develop hypercholesterolemia on a diet high in cholesterol.",

    "122": "Of 147 patients admitted with acute coronary syndromes, 17 were taking statins at the time of presentation. These were matched with 17 subjects not taking statins. We found that statin therapy was associated with lower levels of sP-selectin, a marker of platelet and vascular endothelial activation. This provides further insight into the extralipid effect of statins in clinical practice and may help explain the greater-than-expected benefits of statin therapy in ischemic heart disease.", 
    "123": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) may exert pleiotropic effects on vascular cells independent of lowering plasma cholesterol. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in these effects, we investigated the impact of statins on production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Exposure of VSMC to angiotensin II caused production of ROS via angiotensin AT1 receptor activation. Pretreatment with atorvastatin inhibited angiotensin II-induced ROS production. Atorvastatin decreased AT1 receptor mRNA levels in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and consistently reduced AT1 receptor density. L-Mevalonate but not hydroxy-cholesterol reversed the inhibitory effect of atorvastatin on AT1 receptor transcript levels. Inhibition of geranylgeranyl-transferase but not of farnesyl-transferase mimicked the effect of atorvastatin on AT1 receptor gene expression. Atorvastatin did not decrease AT1 receptor gene transcription but did reduce the half-life of the AT1 receptor mRNA. AT1 receptor activation by angiotensin II increased the expression of the GTPase rac1, enhanced rac1 GTP-binding activity, and increased the geranylgeranyl-dependent translocation of rac1 to the cell membrane. In contrast, statins inhibited rac1 activity and membrane translocation. Consequently, specific inhibition of rac1 with Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin blocked angiotensin II-induced production of free radicals. Finally, treatment of rats with atorvastatin caused down-regulation of aortic AT1 receptor mRNA expression and reduced aortic superoxide production in vivo. Cholesterol-independent down-regulation of AT1 receptor gene expression and inhibition of rac1, leading to decreased ROS production, demonstrates a novel regulatory mechanism of statins that may contribute to the beneficial effects of these drugs beyond lowering of plasma cholesterol.", 
    "124": "We have examined the effects of lovastatin and pravastatin (competitive HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) on the growth and survival of rat brain neuroblasts. Lovastatin, but not pravastatin, suppressed cell growth by inducing apoptosis of neuroblasts in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Apoptosis was accompanied by a decrease in both Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL protein levels, suggesting that changes in the expression of these genes may contribute to apoptosis following lovastatin treatment. Lovastatin treatment was also associated with decreased prenylation of both Ras and Rho A proteins whereas Rac 1 geranylgeranylation was not affected. Lovastatin effects were fully prevented by mevalonate. The present data suggest that lovastatin induces apoptosis of rat brain neuroblasts by its capacity to decrease the prenylation of specific proteins involved in signal transduction pathways that control growth and survival of neuronal cells.", 
    "125": "The effects of cerivastatin on antiatherogenic properties of high-density lipoproteins were studied in patients with coronary heart disease and hyperlipidemia. Apart from hypolipidemic effects, cerivastatin changed the phospholipid composition of high-density lipoproteins and improved their cholesterol-acceptor properties. This effect was most pronounced in the serum from patients with low content of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. These data indicate that cerivastatin modulates antiatherogenic properties of high-density lipoproteins.",

The creatine kinase level was 3180 U/L at the 3-month follow-up visit, which was thought to be due to simvastatin treatment. Although treatment was discontinued, the creatine kinase level 4 months later remained higher than 3000 U/L. Echocardiography revealed mild pericardial effusion and normal left ventricular function; the electromyogram was also normal. The patient subsequently showed signs and symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism, which was confirmed by measurements of the concentration of thyroid-stimulating hormone (>100 mU/L) and free thyroxine (<2 pmol/L). Thyroxine replacement therapy normalised the creatine kinase and cholesterol levels. This case illustrates the importance of excluding underlying causes of hypercholesterolaemia before contemplating lipid-lowering therapy.",

Hepatic hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors or statin drugs exert a primary action on hepatic cholesterol metabolism, as well as influences on vascular reactivity, thrombus formation, inflammation, ischemia, and plaque stabilization. Trials with statin drugs have reported reduction of cardiovascular events in men and women without clinical evidence of coronary artery disease. Several trials have demonstrated angiographic stabilization with cholesterol lowering and a greater reduction in cardiovascular events, revascularization procedures, and strokes. Recent studies suggest benefits in lowering triglycerides and raising high-density lipoprotein cholesterol with drugs. A clinical approach with available cholesterol-lowering drugs is presented based on National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines and follow-up time tables. Thus, cholesterol therapy offers the opportunity to treat atherosclerotic vascular disease before, during, and after ischemic events.", 
    "132": "In the last decade percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty has become a very popular strategy for the treatment of coronary artery disease, although its efficacy in reducing ischemic events and the subsequent need for revascularization has yet to be proved.", 
    "133": "We reviewed the latest trials that compared percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and medical therapy.", 
    "134": "We discuss the potentially favorable effect of lipid-lowering therapy on coronary atherosclerosis and cardiac events and comment on the results of the recent Atorvastatin Versus Revascularization Treatments (AVERT) study that compared lipid-lowering treatment and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in patients with stable coronary artery disease.", 
    "135": "Medical treatment aimed at reversing plaque growth and promoting plaque stabilization should probably be considered as the initial therapeutic option. Statin class drugs, together with aggressive management of known risk factors, show promise as the first step after appropriate early diagnosis. Revascularization procedures should subsequently be considered for all patients who do not respond to medical treatment or in whom the disease shows clear signs of progression.", 
    "136": "Both high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) coronary artery calcification (CAC) are valid markers of cardiovascular risk. It is unknown whether hsCRP is a marker of atherosclerotic burden or whether it reflects a process (eg, inflammatory fibrous cap degradation) leading to acute coronary events.", 
    "137": "A nested case-control study was performed of 188 men enrolled in the Prospective Army Coronary Calcium study. The serum hsCRP levels (latex agglutination assay) were evaluated in subjects with CAC (CAC score >0, n = 94) and compared with age- and smoking status-matched control subjects (CAC score 0, n = 94).", 
    "138": "Levels of hsCRP in the highest quartile were related to the following coronary risk factors: smoking status, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index, glycosylated hemoglobin, fibrinogen, and homocysteine. The mean hsCRP level was similar in cases (+CAC, 0.20 +/- 0.22 mg/dL) and controls (-CAC, 0.19 +/- 0.21 mg/dL; P =.81) and was unrelated to the log-transformed CAC score (r < 0.01, P =.91). Multivariable analysis controlling for standard risk factors, aspirin, and statin therapy found only that low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was related to CAC.", 
    "139": "Despite associations with standard and emerging cardiovascular risk factors, hsCRP is unrelated to the presence and extent of calcified subclinical atherosclerosis. This implies that CAC (a disease marker) and hsCRP (a process marker) may be complementary for the prediction of cardiovascular risk.", 
    "140": "Statin-fibrate combinations are commonly used to treat hyperlipidemia. These drugs have been previously reported to cause rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure. Whether different statin-fibrate combinations have different risks for rhabdomyolysis is not known. We report a patient who developed rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure promptly after switching from the combination of pravastatin and fenofibrate to simvastatin and gemfibrozil.", 
    "141": "The aims of the present study are to assess the 5 year effects of pravastatin on serum lipids and lipoproteins in women around the menopause and to assess the effects of pravastatin on serum gonadotropins and sex steroid levels over a long-term period.", 
    "142": "We evaluated the long-term efficacy of pravastatin on serum lipid levels (total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglyceride) in 121 patients (47 premenopausal and 74 postmenopausal women) suffering from primary hypercholesterolemia. The effects of this lipid-lowering drug on serum gonadotropins and sex steroids (estradiol, estrone, and testosterone) are also reported.", 
    "143": "Pravastatin produced a remarkable reduction in the serum total cholesterol level of 19.2+/-9.3% (P<0.0001) and 18.9+/-11.8% (P<0.0001), and in LDLl-cholesterol of 25.1+/-18.7% (P<0.0001) and 24+/-18.0% (P<0.0001) after 24 and 60 months' treatment, respectively. In hypertriglyceridemia, pravastatin also produced a remarkable reduction in triglyceride of 29.3+/-27.3% (P<0.0001) and 39.9+/-20.4% (P<0.0001) after 24 and 60 months of treatment, respectively. We found that serum gonadotropins and sex steroid levels changed naturally as a function of age from pre-therapy levels in the premenopausal patients after 60 months of treatment.", 
    "144": "Pravastatin was well tolerated over 5 years and was a very effective lipid-lowering agent for both hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia with no effect on the biosynthesis of sex steroids. These findings suggest that pravastatin can be used in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia with/without high triglyceride levels in women around the menopause.", 
    "145": "The current paper describes a line of cultured rat hepatoma cells (McA-RH7777 cells) that mimics the behavior of rat liver by producing an excess of mRNA for sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) as opposed to SREBP-1a. These two transcripts are derived from a single gene by use of alternative promoters that are separated by many kilobases in the genome. The high level of SREBP-1c mRNA is abolished when cholesterol synthesis is blocked by compactin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG CoA) reductase that inhibits cholesterol synthesis. Levels of SREBP-1c mRNA are restored by mevalonate, the product of the HMG CoA reductase reaction, and by ligands for the nuclear hormone receptor LXR, including 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and T0901317. These data suggest that transcription of the SREBP-1c gene in hepatocytes requires tonic activation of LXR by an oxysterol intermediate in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Reduction of this intermediate lowers SREBP-1c levels, and this in turn is predicted to lower the rates of fatty acid biosynthesis in liver.", 
    "146": "The common -514 C-->T polymorphism in the promoter region of the hepatic lipase (HL) gene affects HL activity. The C allele is associated with higher HL activity, more dense and atherogenic LDL, and lower HDL(2) cholesterol. Intensive lipid-lowering therapy lowers HL activity, increases LDL and HDL buoyancy, and promotes coronary artery disease (CAD) regression. We tested the hypothesis that subjects with the CC genotype and a more atherogenic lipid profile experience the greatest CAD regression from these favorable effects.", 
    "147": "Forty-nine middle-aged men with dyslipidemia and established CAD who were undergoing intensive lipid-lowering therapy were studied. Change in coronary stenosis was assessed by quantitative angiography, HL polymorphism by polymerase chain reaction amplification, HL activity by (14)C-labeled substrate, and LDL buoyancy by density-gradient ultracentrifugation. The response to lipid-lowering therapy was significantly different among subjects with different HL promoter genotypes. Subjects with the C:C genotype had the greatest decrease in HL activity (P<0.005 versus TC and TT by ANOVA) and the greatest improvement in LDL density (P<0.005) and HDL(2)-C (P<0.05) with therapy. These subjects had the greatest angiographic improvement, with 96% of them experiencing CAD regression, compared with 60% of TC and none of the TT patients (P:<0.001).", 
    "148": "-In middle-aged men with established CAD and dyslipidemia, the HL gene -514 C-->T polymorphism significantly predicts changes in coronary stenosis with lipid-lowering treatment that appear to involve an HL-associated effect on LDL metabolism. This study identifies a gene polymorphism that strongly influences the lipid and clinical response to lipid-lowering drugs.", 
    "149": "Plant isoprenoids represent a large group of compounds with a wide range of physiological functions. In the cytosol, isoprenoids are synthesized via the classical acetate/mevalonate pathway. In this pathway, farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) occupies a central position, from which isoprene units are dispatched to the different classes of isoprenoids, with sterols as the major end products. The present work deals with effects of squalestatin (SQ) on the metabolism of FPP in proliferating and synchronized cultured tobacco cv. Bright Yellow-2 cells. SQ is a potent inhibitor of squalene synthase (SQS), the first committed enzyme in the sterol pathway. At nanomolar concentrations, SQ severely impaired cell growth and sterol biosynthesis, as attested by the rapid decrease in SQS activity. At the same time, it triggered a several-fold increase in both the enzymic activity and mRNA levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase. When SQ was added to cells synchronized by aphidicolin treatment, it was found to block the cell cycle at the end of G(1) phase, but no cell death was induced. Tobacco cells were also fed exogenous tritiated trans-trans farnesol, the allylic alcohol derived from FPP, in the presence and absence of SQ. Evidence is presented that this compound was incorporated into sterols and ubiquinone Q(10). In the presence of SQ, the sterol pathway was inhibited, but no increase in the radioactivity of ubiquinone was observed, suggesting that this metabolic channel was already saturated under normal conditions.", 
    "150": "This paper discusses interim analysis of randomized clinical trials for which the primary endpoint is observed at a specific long-term follow-up time. For such trials subjects only yield direct information on the primary endpoint once they have been followed through to the long-term follow-up time, potentially eliminating a large proportion of the accrued sample from an interim analysis of the primary endpoint. We advocate more efficient interim analysis of long-term endpoints by augmenting long-term information with short-term information on subjects who have not yet been followed through to the long-term follow-up time. While retaining the long-term endpoint as the subject of the analysis, methods of jointly analysing short- and long-term data are discussed for reversible binary endpoints. It is shown theoretically and by simulation that the use of short-term information improves the efficiency with which long-term treatment differences are assessed based on interim data. Sequential analysis of treatment differences is discussed based on spending functions, and is illustrated with a numerical example from a cholesterol treatment trial.", 
    "151": "The purpose of this study was to compare the macrocirculatory and microcirculatory effects of simvastatin in hyperlipemic patients. In vitro measurements of lipoprotein levels and macrocirculatory hemorheology were complemented by in vivo measurements of the pulmonary capillary red cell volume (RCVpc) before and after 6 weeks of treatment with 40 mg of simvastatin daily in 30 male patients with hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa. RCVpc was assessed from the vascular component of the lung diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, using the modification of the Roughton-Forster's method. RCVpc was increased in patients (60.9+/-9 versus 40+/-9 ml in healthy controls) and it decreased to 47+/-6 ml after treatment (P=5x10(-11)). The decreases in RCVpc correlated to concomitant decreases in peripheral hematocrit (R=0.68) and serum total cholesterol (-34% on average; R=0.59). Membrane diffusing capacity was normal in patients and not affected by the therapy; suggesting that increased RCVpc was due to increased micropulmonary hematocrit. Thus, it appears that viscosity in microcirculation is greatly increased in hyperlipemic patients and that simvastatin is able to normalize it. Since microcirculatory conditions can only partly be inferred from in vitro measurements the use of lung diffusional parameters was advocated, which enable in vivo assessment of hemorheology in microcirculation."
