In these studies we have shown that the expression of statin is associated specifically with the postreplicative and terminally differentiating lens epithelial cell. By monitoring the synthesis of specific lens crystallin proteins, and the morphological and cellular changes associated with this differentiated system, we have demonstrated a close correlation between statin expression and cell commitment to the G0 nonreplicative cell cycle state.", 
    "1": "The acid form of lovastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, was analyzed by gas chromatography/negative-ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry after derivatization with pentafluorobenzyl bromide and bis-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA). Mass spectrometry of this derivative produced a dominant [M-181]- ion under chemical ionization conditions using ammonia as the reagent gas. The limit of detection was approximately 2 pg injected on column.", 
    "2": "We administered CS-514, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, alone and in combination with cholestyramine to heterozygous Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits. This rabbit model for heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia has hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptors that are assumed to be half as many as in normal rabbits. CS-514 alone lowered plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 50%, and in combination with cholestyramine, it lowered levels by 80%. The membrane-binding assay showed these drugs caused 1.5- and 1.8-fold increases in the number of hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptors, respectively. We also measured the amount of mRNA for low-density lipoprotein receptor by S1 nuclease protection assay in the same livers as above. These drugs induced mutant mRNA for the low-density lipoprotein receptor, which has an in-flame deletion of 12 nucleotides, as well as normal receptor mRNA. CS-514 alone produced a 1.8-fold increase in the amount of mRNA for the normal receptor and a 2.3-fold increase for the mutant mRNA, whereas CS-514 in combination with cholestyramine produced 1.9- and 3.1-fold increases, respectively. We conclude that CS-514 induces mRNA for the low-density lipoprotein receptor, subsequently increasing the receptor protein in the liver, and then reduces the levels of plasma cholesterol, and that the induction is augmented when the drug is administered in combination with cholestyramine.", 
    "3": "The effects of 6,6-difluorocholestanol and 7,7-difluorocholestanol on enzymes of hepatic liver cholesterol were examined. Neither compound affected the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase. 7,7-Diffluorocholestanol had no effect on the activity of acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase or cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase. However, 6,6-difluorocholestanol was a competitive substrate for cholesterol in the esterification of cholesterol catalysed by the acyltransferase. 6,6-Difluorocholestanol also inhibited hydroxylation of cholesterol by cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase but was not itself a substrate for this enzyme. These results show that substitutents in ring B of the sterol can have a significant effect on the binding of the sterol to enzymes and to the catalytic mechanism if the substituent is close to the groups in the molecule that participate.", 
    "4": "The scope of this paper is deliberately restricted to diets and drugs devised to lower blood cholesterol levels in pure hypercholesterolaemia (ex-type II in the international classification). This treatment is twofold: (1) Diets. In all cases except cardiovascular emergencies treatment should begin with a diet. If the subject is overweight, an overall low-calorie diet should be prescribed first. This will be followed by a diet with a low cholesterol and saturated fats content and a high polyunsaturated fats content, the latter including linoleic acid (C18:12) present in sunflower margarine and sunflower, maze and soya oils or eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5) and docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6) present in fatty fish. (2) Cholesterol-lowering drugs should then be prescribed if necessary. The most effective of these drugs are cholestyramine and fibrate derivatives. HMG CoA reductase inhibitors will shortly be available in France. This daily medicinal treatment should of course be uninterrupted, but it may be \"reduced\" in case of excellent therapeutic response.", 
    "5": "The efficacy and safety of lovastatin as a hypolipidemic agent were evaluated in ten adult patients with secondary hypercholesterolemia due to proteinuria (greater than 2 g/d) and (in seven patients) concurrent corticosteroid therapy. Patients were on a low-cholesterol diet throughout the study. After a 4-week baseline period, patients were randomized to receive either placebo or 10 mg lovastatin twice daily for a period of 6 weeks. The dose of lovastatin was increased to 20 mg twice daily for 6 weeks, and 40 mg twice daily for 6 weeks in the latter group. Those patients who received placebo for the first 6 weeks subsequently received 10, 20, and 40 mg of lovastatin twice daily in a stepped dose regimen, with each dose given for 6 weeks. Lovastatin was well tolerated by all patients and none withdrew from the study. Baseline plasma cholesterol concentrations (390 +/- 20 mg/dL; mean +/- SEM) decreased 22% (P less than 0.003) at the lowest dose of 10 mg twice daily, 27% at 20 mg twice daily, and 33% at 40 mg twice daily. Baseline plasma triglycerides decreased by 25% (P less than 0.05) at the highest dosage. Concentrations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol fell by 29%, 34%, and 45% on doses of 10, 20, and 40 mg of lovastatin twice daily. Concentrations of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol increased slightly. Serum creatinine concentrations and proteinuria were not affected by lovastatin therapy. We conclude that lovastatin was a well-tolerated and extremely effective hypocholesterolemic agent in patients with persistent secondary hypercholesterolemia associated with proteinuria or proteinuria and concurrent corticosteroid therapy.", 
    "6": "We report the results of a two center study on the use of the HMG Co A reductase inhibitor, simvastatin, in 44 patients suffering from familial hypercholesterolemia or from primary hypercholesterolemia of unknown etiology. The study included two separate phases: Phase I was part of a multicenter, 4-week, placebo-controlled trial; phase II was a 6-month, open extension trial, the object of which was to reduce low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels to below the 50th percentile by increasing the dose of simvastatin, by the use of additional lipid-lowering medication, or both. Our phase I results were commensurate with those reported for the entire international cohort of 272 patients, indicating a clear dose-response relationship, with approximately 75% of the maximum reduction in LDL-C levels being achieved with 20 mg/day and over 90% of the maximum being achieved with 40 mg of simvastatin per day. In the open extension trial, the results from the 2 centers were essentially similar. Total cholesterol fell by 29% on the 20 mg/day dose and by 34% on the full dose of 40 mg/day. LDL-C levels were reduced by 40% on the 40 mg/day schedule, and triglycerides also fell to between 20% and 40% below baseline values. HDL-C concentration rose by 14% and 17.6%. The effects of simvastatin were uniform, both within and between the two cohorts. The addition of cholestyramine caused a further substantial reduction in LDL-cholesterol to below 55% of the initial value in four patients, whereas bezafibrate further enhanced the fall in triglycerides and the increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, but had only a slight effect on LDL-C levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "7": "Immunoprecipitation of native rat liver microsomal 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, phosphorylated by [gamma-32P]ATP in the presence of reductase kinase, revealed a major 97-kDa 32P band which disappeared upon competition with pure unlabeled 53-kDa HMG-CoA reductase. A linear correlation between the expressed/total HMG-CoA reductase activity ratio (E/T) and the fraction of 32P released from the 97-kDa enzyme established the validity of the E/T ratio as an index of HMG-CoA reductase phosphorylation state in isolated microsomes. Incubation of rat hepatocytes with mevalonolactone resulted in a rapid increase in phosphorylation of microsomal reductase (decrease in E/T) followed by an enhanced rate of decay of total reductase activity which was proportional to the loss of 97-kDa enzyme mass determined by immunoblots. Inhibitors of lysosome function dampened both basal and mevalonate-induced reductase degradation in hepatocytes. In an in vitro system using the calcium-dependent protease calpain-2, up to 5-fold greater yields of soluble 52-56-kDa fragments of reductase (immunoblot and total activity) were obtained when the substrate 97-kDa reductase was phosphorylated before proteolysis. Immunoblots of unlabeled phosphorylated reductase compared with gels of immunoprecipitated 32P-labeled reductase resolved a 52-56-kDa doublet which contained 32P solely in the upper band. These data suggest that a major phosphorylation site of HMG-CoA reductase lies within the \"linker\" segment joining the membrane spanning and cytoplasmic domains of the native 97-kDa protein.", 
    "8": "A series of compounds derived from 7-acyl-(2H)-1,4-benzoxazin-3-(4H)-one was synthesized and evaluated for its lipid lowering actions in animal models. These of three 7-(2-methylene butyryl) 4-methyl and 2,4 dimethyl or 2,2,4 trimethyl benzoxazinone showed very potent activity. Their hypocholesterolemic and hypotriglyceridemic activities were tested in normolipemic and in cholesterol-induced hyperlipidemic mice, rats and Syrian hamsters. Two key enzymatic activities (ACAT, HMG CoA Reductase) of the most active compound were also determined. Additional investigation with these products and other derivatives will be performed using a variety of hepatic enzyme activities to better determine their mechanisms of action.", 
    "9": "To study potential effects of hepatic cholesterol concentration on secretion of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) by the liver, male rats were fed on unsupplemented chow, chow with lovastatin (0.1%), or chow with lovastatin (0.1%) and cholesterol (0.1%) for 1 week. Livers were isolated from these animals and perfused in vitro, with a medium containing [2-14C]acetate, bovine serum albumin and glucose in Krebs-Henseleit buffer, and with an oleate-albumin complex. With lovastatin feeding, the hepatic concentrations of cholesteryl esters and triacylglycerols before perfusion were decreased, although free cholesterol was unchanged. However, hepatic secretion of all the VLDL lipids was decreased dramatically by treatment with lovastatin. Although total secretion of VLDL triacylglycerol, phospholipid, cholesterol and cholesteryl esters was decreased, the decrease in triacylglycerol was greater than that in free cholesterol or cholesteryl esters, resulting in secretion of a VLDL particle enriched in sterols relative to triacylglycerol. In separate studies, the uptake of VLDL by livers from control animals or animals treated with lovastatin was measured. Uptake of VLDL was estimated by disappearance of VLDL labelled with [1-14C]oleate in the triacylglycerol moiety, and was observed to be similar in both groups. During perfusion, triacylglycerol accumulated to a greater extent in livers from lovastatin-fed rats than in control animals. The depressed output of VLDL triacylglycerols and the increase in triacylglycerol in the livers from lovastatin-treated animals was indicative of a limitation in the rate of VLDL secretion. Addition of cholesterol (either free cholesterol or human low-density lipoprotein) to the medium perfusing livers from lovastatin-fed rats, or addition of cholesterol to the diet of lovastatin-fed rats, increased the hepatic concentration of cholesteryl esters and the output of VLDL lipids. The concentration of cholesteryl esters in the liver was correlated with the secretion of VLDL by the liver. These data suggest that cholesterol is an obligate component of the VLDL required for its secretion. It is additionally suggested that cholesteryl esters are in rapid equilibrium with a small pool of free cholesterol which comprises a putative metabolic pool available and necessary for the formation and secretion of the VLDL. Furthermore, the specific radioactivity (d.p.m./mumol) of the secreted VLDL free cholesterol was much greater than that of hepatic free cholesterol, suggesting that the putative hepatic metabolic pool is only a minor fraction of total hepatic free cholesterol.", 
    "10": "This 12-week, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study compared the efficacy, tolerability and safety of simvastatin (a potent HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor) and probucol. Two doses of simvastatin, 20 or 40 mg once daily, were compared to probucol, 500 mg twice daily. Both simvastatin doses were significantly more effective than probucol in improving the plasma lipid profile. Mean reduction in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was 34% with 20-mg simvastatin and 40% with the 40-mg dosage, compared to a mean reduction of 8% with probucol. Simvastatin significantly decreased total cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipo-protein B, and increased high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I. Probucol caused some reduction in LDL cholesterol but significantly decreased HDL cholesterol. Both simvastatin and probucol were well tolerated and no serious drug-related events occurred. Simvastatin appears to be a well-tolerated and effective new agent used once-a-day as an adjunct to diet in the management of patients with hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "11": "Incubations of Hep G2 cells for 18 h with human low-density lipoprotein (LDL) resulted in a decrease of squalene synthetase activity, whereas heavy high-density lipoprotein (hHDL) stimulated the activity. Simultaneous addition of LDL abolished the hHDL-induced stimulation, indicating that manipulating the regulatory sterol pool within the cells influenced the enzyme activity. Blocking the endogenous cholesterol synthesis either at the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase site with compactin or at the 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclase site with the inhibitor U18666A gave rise to an elevation of the squalene synthetase activity. Simultaneous addition of mevalonate abolished the compactin-induced increase. However, at total blockade of sterol synthesis by 30 microM U18666A, added compactin and/or mevalonate did not change the enzyme activity further. It was concluded that sterols regulate the squalene synthetase activity, whereas, in contrast with the regulation of the HMG-CoA reductase activity in Hep G2 cells, mevalonate-derived non-sterols did not influence this enzyme.", 
    "12": "A set of isoprenylated proteins has been detected in rapidly proliferating, suspension-grown murine lymphoma cells. Our evidence indicates that all of these isoprenylated proteins are phosphorylated. Subsequent to a 24 h incubation with mevinolin to deplete the intracellular mevalonate (MVA) level, cells were incubated with [3H]MVA and/or 32Pi and both total cell and subcellular fraction proteins were resolved via 1- and 2-D gel electrophoresis, then assessed via subsequent autoradiography. The phospho-isoprenylated proteins comprise a set spanning a molecular mass range of 21-69 kDa and all dispay acidic pI. MVA-derivatized proteins of 21-24 kDa, which consist of multiple isoforms, are present in both cytosolic and nuclear fractions. Larger phospho-isoprenylated protein species (44-69 kDa) are specifically localized within the nucleus, where applicable extraction protocols indicate that they are part of or closely affiliated with the nuclear matrix-intermediate filament (NM-IF) components. The localization of the 69 kDa prenylated species within the NM-IF fraction, together with evidence of its phosphorylation, supports recent indications that this protein is the nuclear matrix component lamin B.", 
    "13": "There are indications that treatment of hypercholesterolemia by means of drugs reduce risk of atherosclerosis in patients with increased concentrations of atherogenic lipoproteins. Such therapy should be initiated only after satisfactory exclusion of secondary causes of hyperlipoproteinemia, and should be regarded as an adjunct to appropriate dietary therapy. Drug therapy should be strongly considered in patients with total cholesterol above 8-9 mmol/l on diet therapy only. Drug therapy should be considered at even lower concentrations of cholesterol when coronary heart disease is present and in familial forms of hyperlipidemia when increased risk of atherosclerosis has been documented. In patients with increased plasma concentrations of total cholesterol the drugs of choice are agents which enhance the rate of LDL catabolism (resins) or reduce the rate of LDL synthesis (nicotinic acid). Fibrates should be used when triglycerides and cholesterol are both increased. HMG CoA reductase inhibitors offer considerable promise in the therapy of patients with primary hypercholesterolemia. Probucol may be used in combination with other drugs, particularly when xanthomas are present in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "14": "A major factor in the regulation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) apoprotein B (apo B) concentrations in miniature pigs is the direct synthesis of LDL apo B. LDL apo B derived from plasma very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) accounts for only 20% to 30% of total LDL synthesis. Treatment with lovastatin and cholestyramine can inhibit the direct synthesis pathway in this species, thereby lowering LDL apo B concentrations. The present study was carried out to determine if lovastatin alone was as effective as in combination with cholestyramine. The possibility that the direct synthesis pathway was confined to a specific subclass of LDL and the effect of lovastatin and cholestyramine on the metabolism of LDL subfractions were also investigated. Homologous 125I-VLDL and 131I-LDL were injected into miniature pigs during a control period and again following 18 days of treatment with lovastatin (1.2 mg/kg/d, n = 4) or in combination with cholestyramine (1.0 g/kg/d, n = 4). Kinetic analysis of apo B specific activity curves following lovastatin treatment indicated that LDL apo B pool size was decreased by 25% (P less than .025), which was due entirely to a 70% (P less than .025) decrease in the direct synthesis of LDL apo B, since VLDL-derived apo B, and LDL fractional catabolic rate (FCR) were not affected. Parameters of VLDL apo B metabolism were not affected. Lovastatin in combination with cholestyramine was more effective than lovastatin alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "15": "Hypertriglyceridemic patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) have an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and acute pancreatitis. To examine the potential of hypolipidemic drugs for therapy of lipoprotein abnormalities in NIDDM, 10 patients maintaining marked (plasma triglycerides greater than 500 mg/dl) and 6 with moderate (plasma triglycerides 250-500 mg/dl) hypertriglyceridemia, despite good glycemic control, were studied in two phases. In the first phase, gemfibrozil alone (600 mg twice daily) was compared with a placebo, and in the second phase a combination of gemfibrozil and lovastatin (20 mg twice daily) was compared with gemfibrozil alone in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. In markedly hypertriglyceridemic patients, gemfibrozil reduced plasma triglycerides by 52% and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-chol) by 55% and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 23% compared with a placebo. However, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-chol) levels increased (42%), and LDL apolipoprotein B (apoB) levels remained unchanged. Addition of lovastatin to gemfibrozil effectively reduced total cholesterol (25%), LDL-chol (30%), and LDL-apoB (19%). Lovastatin further reduced plasma triglycerides (11%) and VLDL-chol (27%). However, in moderately hypertriglyceridemic patients, gemfibrozil or the combination therapy did not seem to offer benefits over the previously reported study with lovastatin alone. Glycemic control was maintained throughout the study. In conclusion, the beneficial effects of the combination therapy on lipoprotein levels in markedly hypertriglyceridemic NIDDM patients could decrease the risk of development of both acute pancreatitis and CHD.", 
    "16": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) inhibitory activity of 7-(aryl/biphenyl)-6-heptenoic acids was quantitatively analysed using hydrophobicity, van der Waals volume and electronic parameters. The activity was primarily a function of hydrophobicity, and was well correlated with the hydrophobicity of ortho and meta substituents on the aryl/biphenyl moiety. The electronic properties of para substituents on the aryl/biphenyl ring influenced the inhibition. Our equations predict that substituents with positive polar and sigma and negative resonance constants might lead to better inhibition.", 
    "17": "The effects of simvastatin (MK-733), a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, on serum lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins were investigated in 29 patients (12 men, 17 women, aged 37 to 73) with moderate to severe hypercholesterolemia. It was given in doses of 2.5 mg/day for four months and 5 mg/day for the succeeding four months. Total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and apolipoprotein (apo) B decreased by 18% (263 +/- 7 mg/dl to 216 +/- 7 mg/dl, P less than 0.01), 24% (180 +/- 7 mg/dl to 136 +/- 7 mg/dl, P less than 0.01), and 21% (133 +/- 4 mg/dl to 104 +/- 3 mg/dl, P less than 0.01), respectively, four months after treatment. Similar reductions (17%, 24%, and 23%, respectively, P less than 0.01) were observed at eight months. A significant reduction in triglyceride (TG) was observed (173 +/- 15 mg/dl to 136 +/- 11 mg/dl at eight months, P less than 0.01), as was a significant increase in serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (48 +/- 2 mg/dl to 52 +/- 2 mg/dl at eight months, P less than 0.01). However, apo AI and apo AII remained unchanged. Atherogenic indices of (TC--HDL-C)/ HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C, and apo B/Apo AI ratios were significantly (P less than 0.01) reduced after treatment. No significant changes were observed in lipoprotein lipase, hepatic TG lipase, and lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activities. Simvastatin was well tolerated and no critical side effects were noted in the eight-month study period. These data indicate that simvastatin, even at a low dose of 2.5 to 5 mg daily, causes consistent reductions in serum TC, LDL-C, apo B, and TG, and a rise in HDL-C and antiatherogenic lipoproteins.", 
    "18": "Increased levels of cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and VLDL-cholesterol are known risk factors for the development of coronary artery disease. There are multiple drugs that can be used for lowering cholesterol, including lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme step in cholesterol synthesis in the body. The pharmacology of this novel agent is discussed in this article.", 
    "19": "We investigated the hypocholesterolemic effects of lovastatin alone and in combination with gemfibrozil on plasma lipids and lipoproteins in 12 adult patients with well-characterized heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Plasma concentrations of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol decreased from 321 +/- 14 mg/dl on diet only to 207 +/- 8 mg/dl (-35.5%) on single-drug therapy with lovastatin at a dose of 40 mg twice daily, whereas triglyceride concentrations fell by 27.6% (from 145 +/- 20 to 105 +/- 20 mg/dl). Subsequent addition of gemfibrozil at a dose of 600 mg twice daily resulted in a nonsignificant further reduction in LDL cholesterol to 194 +/- 7 mg/dl (-39.6% change from baseline), whereas triglycerides decreased to 80 mg/dl (-44.8%, p less than 0.05 vs. single-drug therapy with lovastatin). Plasma concentrations of high density lipoprotein (HDL) increased slightly during lovastatin and combined drug therapy (from 45 +/- 4 mg/dl at baseline to 46 +/- 4 mg/dl on lovastatin to 48 +/- 4 mg/dl on lovastatin plus gemfibrozil). The response to combination drug therapy in individual patients was heterogeneous and clinically significant decreases in LDL cholesterol concentrations were noted in two of the 12 patients, whereas in three patients LDL cholesterol concentrations increased on the combined drug regimen. One patient developed an asymptomatic increase in creatine kinase on monotherapy with lovastatin and a more pronounced and symptomatic increase during combination drug therapy with lovastatin plus gemfibrozil.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "20": "The effects of two inhibitors of 3-hydroxy 3-methyl glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (tunicamycin and mevinolin) on nuclear division in the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum were examined. Tunicamycin exerted a minor effect on division in synchronized cultures, whereas mevinolin delayed the second, third and fourth nuclear divisions with increasing efficiency. Mevinolin also appeared to be the more potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, which catalyses the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol and other isoprene derivatives. These effects of mevinolin could be partially reversed by the addition of mevalonate, suggesting that mevinolin exerts its inhibitory effects on Physarum nuclear division by decreasing the activity of HMG-CoA reductase.", 
    "21": "Lovastatin is a pro-drug lactone whose open chain beta-hydroxy-acid (HA) is a potent inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA-reductase and thus of cholesterol synthesis. Because the liver is the major site of cholesterolgenesis, it is the principal target organ for agents of this class. In animals, lovastatin is not as well absorbed as HA given per se, but that fraction that is absorbed reaches the portal circulation largely unchanged and is more efficiently extracted by the liver, after which it is reversibly biotransformed to HA and irreversibly to other enzymatically active products. These, like HA, maintain high hepatic gradients relative to all tissues examined. The minimal systemic burden for HA is attributable in part to the metabolic equilibrium, lovastatin in equilibrium HA, the opposing reactions for which appear to be present in most tissues. Excretion is very largely biliary in all species. Detailed comparisons of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiles presented here and elsewhere indicate dogs to be the most appropriate paradigm for humans for study of lovastatin disposition.", 
    "22": "The effects of simvastatin, an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, was studied in 50 patients with hypercholesterolaemia. In the first study, 24 patients with serum cholesterol levels of 10.74 +/- 1.59 mmol/l were treated with simvastatin 40 mg daily for 6 months. Serum cholesterol levels decreased within 4 to 8 weeks to stable values 30 to 36% below the basal value. Serum triglycerides decreased by 16 to 28% and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol increased by 6 to 11% on average. In the second study, 26 patients with serum cholesterol levels of 12.35 +/- 2.05 mmol/l were treated with simvastatin 40 mg daily as monotherapy or combined with a bile acid binding resin for 2 years. Cholesterol levels decreased to values which remained stable throughout the entire study period; after 2 years the decrease amounted to 43%. Compared with monotherapy, combination with a bile acid binding resin yielded a further 12% decrease of cholesterol. In the entire group, triglycerides decreased by 16% and HDL cholesterol increased by 9% on the average. Side effects were limited to slight increases in alanine aminotransferase and creatine phosphokinase occurring in some patients. Simvastatin appears to be an important asset in the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia.", 
    "23": "Tissue selectivity of lovastatin, simvastatin and pravastatin was determined in male rats. Peak levels of active drug were found in all tissues examined between 0.5 and 2 hours after oral administration. The area under the curve describing 24 hour exposure of the tissues to drug indicated that the drugs were preferentially concentrated in the liver. However, the concentration of pravastatin was approximately 50% that of either lovastatin or simvastatin in the liver and 3-6 times higher in peripheral tissues. These studies demonstrate that the hydrophobic prodrugs, lovastatin and simvastatin show greater selectivity than the hydrophilic agent pravastatin towards the liver which is the target organ for inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase.", 
    "24": "Inhibitor-1 purified from rabbit liver could not be distinguished from the skeletal muscle protein by chromatographic, electrophoretic and immunological criteria. Amino acid sequences comprising 68% of rabbit liver inhibitor-1 were identical to the skeletal muscle protein indicating that they are products of a single gene. Total inhibitor-1 activity in heat-treated rabbit liver extracts was similar to that in skeletal muscle extracts, and the phosphorylation state of inhibitor-1 increased from 14% to 42% in rabbit liver in vivo after an intravenous injection of glucagon. Monospecific antibodies to rabbit skeletal muscle inhibitor-1 recognised a single major protein of identical electrophoretic mobility (26 kDa) in each rabbit tissue examined (skeletal muscle, liver, brain, heart, kidney, uterus and adipose). The antibodies also recognised a single major (30 kDa) protein in the same rat tissues, except liver. The results show that while there are interspecies differences in apparent molecular mass, inhibitor-1 is likely to be the same gene product in each mammalian tissue. Inhibitor-1 was not detected in rat liver, either by activity measurements or immunoblotting, irrespective of the age, sex or strain of the animals. Immunoblotting also failed to detect inhibitor-1 in mouse liver, although it was present in guinea pig, porcine and sheep liver. The absence of inhibitor-1 in rat liver indicates that phosphorylation of this protein cannot underlie the increased phosphorylation of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase observed after stimulation by glucagon. Monospecific antibodies to rabbit skeletal muscle inhibitor-2 recognised a 31 kDa protein in each rabbit tissue, and a 33 kDa protein in all rat tissues including liver. The results suggest that inhibitor-2 is the same gene product in each mammalian tissue.", 
    "25": "Simvastatin (MK 733), a new competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, given in daily doses of 20 mg and 40 mg for 104 weeks, has been shown to lower the serum total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol level by more than 30% and the serum apoprotein B level by 20% in 19 adult patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. A slight but non-significant increase of high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels was shown throughout the trial with significant elevation of the serum apoproteins AI and AII only observed at week 52. Mild and transient clinical or biochemical (increases of creatine phosphokinase and transaminases) side effects, observed in some patients, did not necessitate the withdrawal of the medication. Full ophthalmological examinations did not reveal ocular disturbances, particularly no apparent increase of lens opacities, during the trial. Simvastatin seems to be an effective and safe drug as monotherapy in the treatment of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "26": "Lovastatin, a specific inhibitor of the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, HMG-CoA reductase, has been shown to be highly effective in lowering serum cholesterol in animals and humans and thus represents a promising approach to the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease. During the preclinical safety assessment of lovastatin, oral doses that were tolerated by dogs, rats and mice were found to be lethal to rabbits in subacute studies. Postmortem findings in rabbits consisted of centrilobular hepatic necrosis, frequently accompanied by renal tubular necrosis and occasionally gallbladder necrosis. The liver lesions were associated with up to 300-fold elevations in serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferase activities, whereas the kidney lesions resulted in accumulations of serum urea nitrogen and creatinine. The organ damage was preceded by a progressive decline in food consumption and loss of body weight. All histopathological and serum biochemical changes induced by lovastatin were completely prevented by coadministration of mevalonate, the product of the inhibited HMG-CoA reductase enzyme. In addition, administration of mevalonate after the onset of lovastatin-induced hepatotoxicity effectively reversed the toxicity despite continued drug treatment. These findings indicated that the toxicity of high doses of lovastatin to rabbits is a consequence of a highly exaggerated pharmacologic action in blocking mevalonate synthesis. However, supplementation of lovastatin-treated rabbits with oral doses of the major product of mevalonate metabolism, cholesterol, paradoxically enhanced the liver and kidney damage, which suggested that the toxicity of lovastatin stemmed from depletion of a nonsterol metabolite(s) of mevalonate critical for cell viability.", 
    "27": "Hypercholesterolemia was induced in New Zealand white rabbits by feeding them a 0.5% cholesterol-enriched rabbit chow for 2 wk. Half of the cholesterol-fed rabbits were given lovastatin, a potent inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, and the other half were given its vehicle (i.e., DMSO). At the end of 2 wk, the rabbits underwent experimental myocardial ischemia or a sham ischemia procedure. Ischemic animals fed the cholesterol-enriched diet for 2 wk experienced much greater cardiac damage than ischemic rabbits fed the control diet, despite the absence of any atherosclerosis. Lovastatin was shown to protect the ischemic rabbit myocardium by three different indices of ischemic damage: (a) maintenance of creatine kinase (CK) activity in the ischemic myocardium; (b) reduced loss of free amino-nitrogen containing compounds from the ischemic myocardium; and (c) blunting the rise of plasma CK activity. These effects were not due to differences in myocardial oxygen demand between the groups. Arteries isolated from animals fed the cholesterol-enriched diet developed defects in endothelium-dependent relaxation in both large vessels as well as coronary resistance vessels. Acute hypercholesterolemia increases the severity of myocardial ischemia while at the same time impairing endothelium-dependent relaxation. These deleterious changes can be significantly attenuated by treatment with lovastatin.", 
    "28": "3 beta-Hydroxy-5 alpha-cholest-8(14)-en-15-one (I) is a potent inhibitor of sterol synthesis with significant hypocholesterolemic activity. (25R)-3 beta,26-Dihydroxy-5 alpha-cholest-8(14)-en-15-one (II) has been shown to be a major metabolite of I after incubation with rat liver mitochondria. Described herein is the chemical synthesis of II from diosgenin. As part of this synthesis, improved conditions are described for the conversion of diosgenin to (25R)-26-hydroxycholesterol. Benzoylation of the latter compound gave (25R)-cholest-5-ene-3 beta,26-diol 3 beta,26-dibenzoate which, upon allylic bromination followed by dehydrobromination, gave (25R)-cholesta-5,7-diene-3 beta,26-diol 3 beta,26-dibenzoate. Hydrogenation-isomerization of the delta 5.7-3 beta,26-dibenzoate to (25R)-5 alpha-cholest-8(14)-ene-3 beta,26-diol 3 beta,26-bis(cyclohexanecarboxylate) followed by controlled oxidation with CrO3-dimethylpyrazole gave (25R)-3 beta,26-dihydroxy-5 alpha-cholest-8(14)-en-15-one 3 beta,26-bis(cyclohexanecarboxylate). Acid hydrolysis of the delta 8(14)-15-ketosteryl diester gave II. 13C NMR assignments are given for all synthetic intermediates and several major reaction byproducts. The structure of II was unequivocally established by X-ray crystal analysis. II was found to be highly active in the suppression of the levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase in cultured mammalian cells and to inhibit oleoyl coenzyme A-dependent esterification of cholesterol in jejunal microsomes.", 
    "29": "We have constructed hybrid dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) genes which are controlled by the sterol-responsive hamster 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase promoter. Stable transfection frequencies of these chimeric templates into a DHFR-deficient Chinese hamster cell line indicate that the HMG CoA reductase promoter fragment confers DHFR transformation irrespective of its orientation relative to a downstream murine DHFR cDNA. Sterol-regulated levels of DHFR RNA and protein are detected from hybrid genes which carry a properly oriented promoter fragment. Constructions which invert this HMG CoA reductase promoter, however, generate DHFR RNA levels which do not respond to sterols. In the context of these transfected fusion genes, we present evidence of divergent opposite-strand transcription initiating from the HMG CoA reductase 5' fragment. In contrast, the endogenous HMG CoA reductase promoter region shows no apparent evidence of such bidirectional activity.", 
    "30": "Mevinolin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase activity, is a potent inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis. We have tested the effects of mevinolin on cell replication (3H-thymidine incorporation), prostacyclin production (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) and cell death (51Cr release) in cell cultures (human umbilical vein endothelial cells, bovine endothelial cells, human fibroblasts and bovine smooth muscle cells). Mevinolin concentrations ranging from 0.05 mumol/l (reported therapeutic concentration) to 20 mumol/l were used. In human endothelial cells the replication was reduced by 11% at a concentration of 2.0 mumol/l (P less than 0.01). In fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells the reduction was significant already at 0.1 mumol/l (10%, P less than 0.01). The prostacyclin production was reduced in endothelial cells at 1.0 mumol/l (19%, P less than 0.01) and in smooth muscle cells at 2.0 mumol/l (15%, P less than 0.05). At 20 mumol/l both cell replication and prostacyclin production was markedly reduced by about 40% in all cell types. No effects on 51Cr release or trypan blue staining was seen at any concentration. It is concluded that mevinolin has an effect on DNA synthesis and prostacyclin production on the tested cell types in vitro. These effects were, however, observed only at concentrations higher than those recommended for therapeutical use.", 
    "31": "The activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) and the level of its mRNA have been determined at various stages of tomato fruit development. The HMGR reaction makes mevalonate, a necessary component in the synthesis of all isoprene containing compounds, such as sterols and carotenoids. A cDNA clone encoding the active site region of HMGR has been isolated from a tomato library derived from young-fruit mRNA. The clone hybridizes to a one- or two-copy fragment in high-stringency DNA gel blot analyses and detects an mRNA of approximately 3.0 kb. Both HMGR activity and mRNA levels are high in early stages of tomato fruit development, when rapid cell division occurs, as well as in the subsequent early stages of cellular expansion. In contrast, ripening fruit have very low levels of reductase activity and mRNA, even though large amounts of the carotenoid lycopene are synthesized during this period. Furthermore, in vivo inhibition of HMGR during early fruit stages disrupts subsequent development, whereas inhibition during later stages of fruit expansion has no apparent effect on ripening. We conclude that the pool of mevalonate responsible for the synthesis of phytosterols is synthesized primarily during the first half of tomato fruit development. In addition, the final period of fruit expansion and ripening is not dependent upon HMGR activity, but instead utilizes a preexisting pool of pathway intermediates or requires the use of salvage pathways in the cell.", 
    "32": "Two cell lines, derived from human T-cell acute leukemia, one glucocorticoid sensitive (CEM-C7) and the other glucocorticoid resistant (CEM-C1) were grown in the presence of 1 x 10-7 M dexamethasone and were analyzed for their dolichol content. After 24 hrs of incubation, dolichols became significantly elevated in the sensitive but not in the resistant line. Lovastatin, the specific inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis did not affect dolichol levels in either of the two cell lines. The results raise the possibility that dolichol accumulation might be involved in the early stages of the glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis (directed cell killing).", 
    "33": "Extracorporeal elimination of atherogenic lipoproteins with dextran-sulfate-cellulose for lowering of plasma cholesterol levels was tested in 2 patients with familial heterozygous hypercholesterolemia (untreated cholesterol values 12.9 +/- 1.5 and 12.5 +/- 1.2 respectively) in a longterm experiment. One patient was treated weekly for a period of 36 weeks and the other at fourteen days' intervals with simultaneous administration of 40 mg/day Simvastatin (synvinolin, MSD) for 8 weeks. The mean reduction in total cholesterol concentration was 41% in the first case and 54% in the second (combination with Simvastatin). The therapy was well tolerated without side effects.", 
    "34": "In freshly harvested Aspergillus terreus cultures grown for the production of lovastatin (formerly called mevinolin), no monacolin L could be detected. However, during the isolation of lovastatin, significant quantities of monacolin L appeared. It has been discovered that a new metabolite structurally related to the members of the monacolin series is present. This metabolite is unstable and under mildly acidic conditions and elevated temperature, it converts to monacolin L. The subject metabolite is proven to be a hydroxylated derivative of dihydromonacolin L identified as 3 alpha-hydroxy-3,5-dihydromonacolin L. It seems that all monacolin L found later during various treatments of the broth and broth extracts is formed from that precursor via a dehydration reaction. The new metabolite was converted to its phenacyl ester, by means of extractive alkylation, for isolation and structure elucidation by chemical, chromatographic and spectroscopic methods. This ester, on standing, gradually formed the corresponding lactone.", 
    "35": "Newly absorbed retinol is transported in association with chylomicrons and their remnants. In addition, after intake of high doses of retinol, significant amounts are also found in low-density lipoprotein (LDL). As both chylomicron remnants and LDL may be taken up by cells via the LDL receptor, and retinoids inhibit proliferation of some leukaemic cells, we have studied the uptake of retinol in leukaemic cells via the LDL-receptor pathway. HL-60 cells contain saturable binding sites for LDL. The binding of LDL to its receptor has a dissociation constant of about 3.2 x 10(-9) M, and the number of receptors per cell was calculated to be about 2700. Uptake of 125I-LDL by HL-60 cells was increased 2-fold by preincubating the cells with mevinolin. The presence of specific receptors for LDL on HL-60 cells was further confirmed by the finding that exogenous LDL cholesterol was able to up-regulate the ACAT (acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase) activity of HL-60 cells. We then tested the uptake of retinyl ester in leukaemic cells via the LDL-receptor pathway. HL-60 cells were incubated with LDL or chylomicron remnants labelled with [3H]retinyl palmitate. Uptake of retinyl ester associated with both LDL and chylomicron remnants was observed. Furthermore, the presence of excess LDL decreased the uptake by 75-100%, supporting the hypothesis that the uptake of retinyl ester occurred via the LDL receptor in HL-60 cells.", 
    "36": "The localization of reactive cysteines and characterization of the HMG-CoA binding domain of rat liver HMG-CoA reductase were studied using iodoacetamide (IAAD) and short-chain acyl-CoA thioesters. Freeze-thaw-solubilized HMG-CoA reductase is irreversibly inactivated by IAAD with a second order rate constant of 0.78 M-1 sec-1 at 37 degrees C and pH 7.2. This IAAD inactivation is slowed down by pretreatment of the enzyme with disulfides, indicating that inactivation of HMG-CoA reductase occurs mainly through alkylation of specific cysteine residues in the protein. The substrate HMG-CoA, but not NADP(H), effectively protects the reductase from IAAD inactivation. When both HMG-CoA and NADP(H) are present, the reductase is inactivated by IAAD at a rate much faster than the inactivation in the presence of HMG-CoA alone. Of the two moieties of the HMG-CoA thioester, the CoA moiety confers protection from IAAD inactivation whereas HMG is totally ineffective. A series of CoA-thioesters of mono- and dicarboxylic acids of various size were tested for their effect on the activity of HMG-CoA reductase. The CoA analog, desulfo-CoA (des-CoA), and all CoA-thioesters of monocarboxylic acids of up to 6 carbons in length exhibit mixed-type inhibition of reductase activity. The competitive inhibition constants (Ki) for these compounds vary between 1 and 2 mM, whereas the noncompetitive component (K'i) is relatively constant (540 +/- 20 microM). As the acyl chain length increases beyond 6 carbons, the thioesters of monocarboxylic acids become more potent and acquire the characteristics of pure noncompetitive inhibitors. In contrast, the monothioesters of dicarboxylic acids are pure competitive inhibitors with Ki values which are similar to the Ki values of the corresponding thioesters of monocarboxylates. HMG does not affect reductase activity in concentrations of up to 2 mM, yet it greatly enhances the inhibition of the enzyme by des-CoA. Specifically, HMG affects only the Ki value of des-CoA by decreasing it from 1030 microM to 280 microM. The results indicate that reactive cysteine(s) are localized in the catalytic site of HMG-CoA reductase. Within the active site, these cysteines are closely associated with and probably participate in the binding of the CoA moiety of the substrate HMG-CoA. The results are also consistent with the existence of a noncatalytic hydrophobic site in HMG-CoA reductase.", 
    "37": "The clinical consequences of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) result from its metabolic peculiarities that persist from very early childhood, leading to the accumulation of cholesterol in the form of xanthomas in skin and tendons and atheromatous lesions in the arterial wall, in particular, in the aorta and the stem of coronary arteries. Plasma cholesterol concentration markedly increases during the suckling period, soon attaining a level near 1000 mg/dl in homozygotes and 200 to 400 mg/dl in heterozygotes. By age 50, about 80% of FH males suffer from ischemic heart diseases, while only 20% to 30% of the females are moderately affected by coronary atherosclerosis. In addition to the low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level, higher triglyceride and lower high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels correlate with an increased risk of ischemic heart diseases. A very important problem is that most of these patients do not feel themselves to be seriously ill until a severe myocardial infarction (often leading to sudden death) takes place during the third to fifth decades of life. Among the different types of receptor mutations, the incidence of ischemic heart diseases was much higher and more extensive among patients with the receptor-negative type than among those with the receptor-defective type with a residual receptor activity.", 
    "38": "Lymphocyte proliferation stimulated by mitogenic lectins is dependent on exogenously supplied cholesterol when endogenous cholesterol synthesis is blocked with the specific inhibitor mevinolin. Lymphocytes from patients homozygous for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) lack low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, and, therefore, these patients cannot use LDL cholesterol to support proliferation when endogenous sterol synthesis is blocked. Thus, LDL receptors are required for the uptake of exogenous lipoprotein cholesterol by proliferating lymphocytes. As a result, the number of functional receptors can be assessed when endogenous sterol synthesis is inhibited and when limiting concentrations of LDL are employed to support lymphocyte proliferation. Lymphocytes from patients heterozygous for LDL receptor abnormalities can be distinguished from normal lymphocytes since the former require twice the concentration of LDL for proliferation. By contrast, in hyperlipidemia not caused by FH, lymphocyte LDL receptor activity is normal, indicating that plasma cholesterol levels do not account for abnormalities in LDL receptor function assayed in this way. Therapy with cholesterol-lowering drugs, however, can alter lymphocyte LDL receptor activity in patients with heterozygous FH. Patients with heterozygous FH respond to therapy with mevinolin and a bile-acid-binding resin by lowering plasma cholesterol levels. In some patients, treatment with cholesterol-lowering plasma cholesterol levels. In some patients, treatment with cholesterol-lowering plasma cholesterol agents is also associated with normalization of functional lymphocyte LDL receptor activity, thereby providing direct evidence that therapy can alter LDL receptor expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "39": "We assessed plasma lipid levels in children and adolescents who were on various drug regimens and who were attending a specialized lipid treatment center. All subjects had familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), and the study group included 30 subjects with heterozygous (He) and three with homozygous (Ho) FH. In the 30 He FH subjects treated with 5 to 30 g/day of a bile-acid-binding resin, plasma lipid levels were still substantially above optimal (less than or equal to 50th percentile for age and sex), although statistically significant (p less than 0.001) reductions in total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol of 15% and 21% compared with baseline were achieved. In eight subjects who received resin plus niacin, additional reductions in total and LDL cholesterol of 15% and 17%, respectively, were achieved. Even though the combination therapy produced reductions in total, LDL, and LDL/high density lipoprotein cholesterol of 29%, 37%, and 47%, respectively, compared with baseline, resulting absolute levels were still well above optimal. Six subjects with severe He FH received a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitor (lovastatin, 80 mg/day or simvastatin, 40 mg/day), and substantial total and LDL cholesterol reductions on the order of 35% and 41%, respectively, were found compared with diet alone. The decreases were substantially greater than those achieved with either resin or resin plus niacin. In a number of these subjects, absolute lipid levels were approaching optimal levels. In the three Ho FH subjects, the response to HMG CoA reductase inhibitors was variable but generally poor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "40": "This investigation was carried out in 10 male patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia to determine the effects of combined drug therapy with lovastatin and colestipol on the kinetics of apolipoprotein B (apo B) in low density lipoproteins (LDL) and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). Drug treatment produced reductions in plasma total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol averaging 41% and 48%, respectively. Levels of LDL apo B declined by only 34%, which resulted in a reduction in LDL cholesterol/apo B ratios. The major change in LDL apo B kinetics was a marked increase in fractional catabolic rate for LDL apo B, while production rates for LDL apo B were not changed. Combined drug therapy likewise produced a striking reduction in VLDL cholesterol. This change was associated with an increased clearance of a slowly catabolized fraction of VLDL apo B. Production rates for total VLDL apo B were unchanged. Overall, the combination of lovastatin and colestipol reduced plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein fractions to an acceptable range, and the primary mechanism appeared to be via an increase in the activity of LDL receptors and not by a reduction in production rates of lipoproteins.", 
    "41": "Compound 8, a monocyclic analogue of compactin, has been prepared and its efficacy as an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarylcoenzyme A reductase (HMGR) evaluated. The synthesis (Schemes I and II) requires seven steps starting with di-(-)-menthyl fumarate and employs the useful RR-phosphonate reagent 14 to attach the mevinic acid side chain to aldehyde 13. A molecular mechanics study shows that the preferred conformations of 18 (a model for compactin) and 19 (a model for 8) are nearly identical. Compound 8 inhibits HMGR with IC50 = 320 microM, compared to a corresponding value of 32 nM for the compactin ketone, 5. The factor of 10,000 difference in the two inhibitors corresponds to a difference in binding energy of 5.45 kcal mol-1, or 1.36 kcal mol-1 for each of the four carbons of 5 that are missing in analogue 8. This quantitative difference is consistent with the idea that the decalin moiety of the mevinic acids play a purely hydrophobic role in binding the inhibitors to the enzyme.", 
    "42": "Patch-clamp technique and fluorescence polarization analysis were used to study the effect of lipids on the kinetic of Ca2+-dependent K+ channels and membrane fluidity. Cultured smooth muscle cells from human and rabbit aortas were used. 2-decenoic acid (DA) was applied to increase membrane fluidity and cholesterol (CHS) level was varied using mevinolin (MEV) and CHS-enriching medium. In the presence of 0.5 microM Ca2+ and 2 mM Mg2+ more than 40-fold elevation in the probability of the channels been open (Po) was observed under DA action. Treatment of cells with MEV leads to nearly 2 fold increase in membrane fluidity and to more than 4 times elevation of Po. The addition of CHS to the cell membrane resulted in a nearly 2 fold decrease in membrane fluidity and about 2 fold decrease in Po. The data suggest that lipid content affect the kinetics of Ca2+-activated K+ channels presumably due to changes in membrane fluidity.", 
    "43": "Attacks of acute hepatic porphyria have been previously reported to be frequently associated with transient hypercholesterolemia. This investigation was undertaken in order to establish whether the hypocholesterolemic effect of simvastatin (MK-733) is associated with inhibition of porphyrin metabolism. In two experimental models of acute hepatic porphyria--monolayers of chick embryo liver cells induced by DDC, and diethoxycarbonyl dihydrocollidine (DDC) injected rats--simvastatin was shown to increase porphyrin formation. A similar increasing effect was observed in a system which mimics the latent phase of porphyria, non-induced monolayers of chick embryo liver cells. We conclude that simvastatin is a porphyrogenic drug and should therefore be used with extreme caution in patients with hypercholesterolemia who also have latent porphyria. Its administration should be discontinued, at least temporarily, in patients with hypercholesterolemia during acute attacks of hepatic porphyria.", 
    "44": "MK-733 was found to prevent an increase of serum cholesterol levels in cholesterol-fed rabbits, and lovastatin also markedly inhibited their increase. MK-733 and lovastatin inhibited the increase of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and it slightly affected the high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. MK-733 and lovastatin suppressed the increase of serum phospholipid levels and slightly affected the triglyceride levels. MK-733 suppressed the development of atherosclerosis in coronary arteries and aorta, and lovastatin also diminished their development.", 
    "45": "Subsequent to the discovery of compactin (ML-236B) as a specific inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase, a series of compactin analogs have been either isolated or synthesized. Several of these compounds, which include compactin, mevinolin (monacolin K) and CS-514, have been extensively studied. The inhibition of HMG CoA reductase by these compounds is reversible and competitive (Ki = approximately 1 nM). The 3', 5'-dihydroxypentanoic acid portion of the acid form of compactin analogs, which resembles the HMG portion of HMG CoA, plays a crucial role in inhibitory activity. These inhibitors block sterol synthesis both in cultured mammalian cells and in animals. Strong inhibition of sterol synthesis results in a marked increase in HMG CoA reductase activity both in vitro and in vivo. These compounds strongly lower plasma LDL-cholesterol levels in animals and humans. The lowering of LDL-cholesterol levels occurs by an inhibition of LDL synthesis and/or by an elevation of the receptor-mediated LDL catabolism in the liver.", 
    "46": "HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors represent an interesting new class of cholesterol-lowering substances. At the moment there is only one of these substances, lovastatin (Mevacor), registered in Austria. HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors act primarily through an increase of the expression of the LDL-receptors presumably in the liver. By this mechanism they cause a marked reduction of LDL-cholesterol-levels and thus should markedly reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. The once daily dosage of these drugs, their effectiveness in low doses and the low incidence of side effects facilitate the patient's compliance. With the exception of rhabdomyolysis which occurs very rarely when avoiding a combination therapy with fibrate-analoges or cyclosporin, this kind of treatment is relatively free of serious side effects. Results from long-term studies indicate that the hypocholesterolemic effect of these drugs is maintained during prolonged therapy; possible drug-related side effects did not differ from those reported in short-term studies.", 
    "47": "The effect of treatment with simvastatin, a new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, has been investigated in 27 patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia. It produced a significant decrease of cholesterol and phospholipids in plasma, LDL and apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins. Plasma apolipoproteins B, C-III and E were also significantly lowered. The concentration of lipoprotein particles recognized by monoclonal antibodies (BL3, BL5 and BL7), associated with atherosclerotic disease, was also lowered by the treatment. Lipoproteins LpA-II:A-I were not changed, while LpA-I, which has been suggested to be the protective fraction of the apo A-I-containing lipoproteins, was slightly and inconsistently increased.", 
    "48": "In a 6-week multicenter study, we compared the efficacy and tolerance of a treatment with 10 mg of simvastatin, a new inhibitor of the HMG-CoA reductase to that of 12 g cholestyramine in 145 patients whose total cholesterol remained between 250 and 350 mg/dl after 4 weeks of a standard lipid-lowering diet. The decrease in total cholesterol reached 21% in the simvastatin group and 16% in the cholestyramine group (p less than 0.01) while the LDL-cholesterol decreased respectively by 30% and 25%. HDL cholesterol increased by 11% in the simvastatin group and by 7% in the cholestyramine group. The ratios of total to HDL cholesterol and LDL to HDL cholesterol decreased by 28.1% and 35.8% respectively with simvastatin and by only 19.5% and 27.9% respectively with cholestyramine. Triglycerides decreased by 5.8% with simvastatin and increased by 8.5% with cholestyramine. Significantly less adverse experiences were observed with simvastatin than with cholestyramine. Simvastatin at the dosage of 10 mg appeared to be at least as efficient as 12 g of cholestyramine and generally better tolerated.", 
    "49": "Arteriosclerosis, particularly coronary heart disease, is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in many areas of the world. Elevated cholesterol, particularly LDL-cholesterol, has been shown to be one of the major modifiable factors in reducing coronary events. Standard hypolipidemic therapies include resin, fibrates and niacin. This review emphasizes a significant new therapeutic class of hypolipidemic agents, namely the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. These are potent cholesterol lowering agents. Lovastatin is the first agent of this class to receive clinical approval in the U.S.A. Simvastatin, an analog of lovastatin, is also approved in several countries. Both these agents are administered as lactones and hydrolyzed to the open acid forms. Another HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor pravastatin has recently been filed for registration in several countries. A fourth compound (SRI-62-320) which is currently in clinical investigation is a totally synthetic structure. If long-term safety remains good and clinical efficacy as demonstrated by reduction of cardiovascular events is proven, the HMG-CoA reductase class of agents will be a significant advance in the treatment of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "50": "Recent trials have investigated the usefulness of fenofibrate, alone and in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies, in the treatment of hyperlipidemia. Studies of fenofibrate + bile acid sequestrants demonstrate that these two therapies may have an additive effect in reducing total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol and triglyceride levels in patients with hyperlipoproteinemia or familial hypercholesterolemia. These lipoprotein changes have been associated with a regression of tendon xanthoma. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that bile acid sequestrants do not alter the absorption or the plasma levels of fenofibrate. The combined use of fenofibrate with bile acid sequestrants has been found to be comparably effective with the new 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, synvinolin, with respect to the reduction of total cholesterol and LDL. Although synvinolin was more effective in lowering LDL, VLDL cholesterol and triglycerides were reduced to a greater extent with fenofibrate. Another notable difference was that fenofibrate + bile acids more markedly increased HDL levels. The combination of fenofibrate + nicotinic acid also appears to have a beneficial effect on lipoproteins. These preliminary results indicate that fenofibrate may be a useful addition to the present lipid-lowering drug armamentarium.", 
    "51": "Portacaval shunt surgery and liver transplantation have been used to treat patients with severe familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). These operations have usually been performed on patients with homozygous FH, but portacaval shunt surgery has also been used in several patients with the heterozygous form of the disease. Portacaval shunt surgery lowers the low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level by 25% or more in about 80% of patients. The main effect of the operation is to lower the LDL apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 production rate, but there is little effect on the fractional rate of clearance of this apolipoprotein. The operation is only palliative because significant hypercholesterolemia remains after surgery. Liver transplantation restores LDL receptor activity to over 60% of normal, which results in an increase in the fractional catabolic rate (FCR) and a decrease in the synthetic rate of LDL apo B-100. Both metabolic changes cause the LDL cholesterol level to drop by about 80%. After transplantation, homozygotes are also more responsive to certain cholesterol-lowering drugs. It is concluded that liver transplantation is more effective than portacaval shunt surgery for treating homozygous FH. However, liver transplantation should be reserved for those patients who cannot produce functioning LDL receptors and who do not respond to more conservative forms of therapy.", 
    "52": "Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) have had a life-long sustained elevation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Consequently, there is a need to maximally lower their elevated levels, and this usually requires lowering LDL levels more than 50%. Because no single hypolipidemic drug will consistently produce such degrees of lowering, combination drug therapy with two or even three agents is required to produce the desired degree of cholesterol lowering. A prospective trial was designed to determine if combination therapy using three hypolipidemic agents could effectively lower LDL levels in 17 severely affected FH subjects. Colestipol hydrochloride (10 g b.i.d.), probucol (500 mg b.i.d.), and lovastatin (20 or 40 mg b.i.d.) were given to each patient, in varying combinations, over a 25-month period. Lovastatin (40 mg/day) uniformly lowered LDL levels 36%. Probucol lowered LDL only 14% and in a variable manner. The combination of lovastatin and probucol lowered LDL no better than lovastatin alone. Lovastatin plus colestipol lowered LDL 52%; probucol added as a third agent produced no further lowering. Lovastatin (80 mg/day) plus colestipol lowered LDL 56%. Lovastatin increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels 6%, whereas probucol decreased HDL 29%. In all patients there was an effective lowering of LDL levels, ranging from 40% to 70%. Thus, lovastatin plus colestipol is an effective hypolipidemic regimen for producing marked decreases in LDL levels in FH subjects. The addition of probucol as a third hypolipidemic agent adds little to the therapeutic regimen as measured by lowering of LDL levels.", 
    "53": "The authors list the principal normolipidemic drugs. Only cholestyramine (Questran) and some fibrates (fenofibrate: Lipanthyl for instance) are registered for pediatrics. Cholestyramine acts by sequestering biliary acids, and thereby inhibiting intestinal cholesterol resorption. It is the primary drug used for children, when diet has been unable to restore normal cholesterol values.", 
    "54": "Lovastatin was investigated in a single-blind placebo-controlled trial in 150 patients with coronary atherosclerosis confirmed by coronary angiographic studies and those with nonfamilial hyperlipoproteinemia. After 3 months of treatment total cholesterol (TC) level was reduced by 36% (p less than 0.001), LDL cholesterol level by 48% (p less than 0.001), triglycerides level by 19% (p less than 0.001), VLDL cholesterol by 24% (p less than 0.01), whereas the HDL-cholesterol level was increased by 36% (p less than 0.001). Besides, concentration of apolipoprotein A-I increased by 19% (p less than 0.05), apolipoprotein B decreased by 22% (p less than 0.05) and the ratios of LDL cholesterol/HDL cholesterol and TC/HDL cholesterol decreased by 64% and 56%, respectively (p less than 0.001). The side effects of lovastatin were negligible. Thus, lovastatin is a highly effective and well tolerated hypolipidemic drug for the treatment of patients with IHD and hyperlipoproteinemia.", 
    "55": "Because previous studies have shown that a reduction of cholesterol synthesis is one of the earliest effects of dexamethasone on neoplastic lymphoid cells, a study was made to compare dexamethasone to lovastatin, a specific inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, which acts on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. Two cell lines were used, both derived from human acute T-cell leukemia, one dexamethasone-sensitive (CEM-C7), the other dexamethasone-resistant (CEM-Cl). The results revealed a similar pattern of resistance and sensitivity of both lines to lovastatin, although only the dexamethasone effect was reversed by 1 microM RU 486, the antiglucocorticoid steroid. The cell killing by dexamethasone and lovastatin had the characteristics of apoptosis.", 
    "56": "Infant rats (10-16 days) and weaned animals (older than 18 days) were treated with drugs inhibiting beta-adrenergic activity and were sacrificed 4 days later. 6-Hydroxydopamine acts on postsympathetic nerve fibres, and guanfacine stimulates alpha 2-receptors. Both drugs caused a rise in plasma cholesterol and a decrease in hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase activity in infant but not in weaned animals. The activity of acylcholesterol acyl CoA transferase, on the other hand, was decreased after drug administration. Thus, both antihypertensive drugs may cause changes in cholesterol metabolism, especially in infant animals.", 
    "57": "A 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitor, lovastatin, has recently been approved for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. However, the product of HMG CoA reductase, mevalonate (MVA), is an early precursor not only for cholesterol but also for several other essential molecules. Since HMG CoA reductase is found in lymphoid cells, the potential alteration of lymphoid cell function by lovastatin was examined. At doses equivalent to pharmacological concentrations, exposure to lovastatin for 7 days inhibited phytohemagglutinin-stimulated proliferation by 25-54% and natural killer cell cytotoxicity by 25-57%. At higher concentrations (10 microM) for shorter periods of time (48 h), lovastatin inhibited phytohemagglutin and Concanavalin A-stimulated proliferation by 83% and 38% respectively, natural killer cell cytotoxicity by 93%, and interferon gamma production by 98%. The inhibition of these parameters could be largely reversed by the addition of MVA; however, MVA itself was not a stimulant. Overall, the in vitro inhibitions seen with lovastatin raise a concern about potential in vivo alteration of lymphoid cell function seen with long term administration of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors.", 
    "58": "Incubation of 1 x 10(6) bovine binucleate trophoblastic cells (BTC) for 6 h with 0.20 and 0.30 microM-Ca2+ ionophore A23187 increased (P less than 0.01) net progesterone production 49% and 111%, respectively, compared to BTC without A23187. Addition of 3 mM-8-bromo-cAMP with A23187 had no effect on the response. Trifluoperazine (40 microM), an inhibitor of calmodulin, and ethylene glycol-bis-(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (1.0 mM), a Ca2+ chelator, decreased (P less than 0.01) progesterone production. Progesterone production by BTC incubated for 6 h with fetal bovine serum or lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) did not differ. Addition of bovine serum low-density lipoprotein or high-density lipoprotein to LPDS did not affect progesterone production. Aminoglutethimide (100 microM) decreased (P less than 0.01) progesterone production by BTC. These results indicate that progesterone production by bovine BTC is Ca2+-dependent, cyclic nucleotide-independent, and not stimulated by bovine serum lipoproteins.", 
    "59": "Sixteen patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia received double-blind either fenofibrate (n = 8; 200 mg bid) or the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin (n = 8; 20 mg q.p.m. [corrected] or 40 mg q.p.m. [corrected] if LDL-cholesterol did not fall below 3.6 mmol.l-1 after 4 weeks of treatment). Simvastatin reduced total cholesterol from 9.7 to 7.0 mmol.l-1 after 10 weeks (-28%), and fenofibrate reduced it from 9.2 to 7.7 mmol.l-1 (-15%). The decrease was less during fenofibrate than during simvastatin treatment (time x drug: p = 0.02). Serum LDL-cholesterol fell from 8.3 to 5.3 mmol.l-1 (-36%) during simvastatin and from 7.2 to 6.0 mmol.l-1 (-16%) during fenofibrate administration. Again, the effect of simvastatin was more pronounced than that of fenofibrate (time x drug: p = 0.03). HDL-cholesterol increased significantly from 1.1 to 1.2 mmol.l-1 (+13%) during fenofibrate administration and it did not change significantly during simvastatin. Serum triglycerides fell from 1.3 to 1.1 mmol.l-1 (-16%) during simvastatin, and even more significantly from 2.2 to 1.1 mmol.l-1 (-51%) during fenofibrate (time x drug: p = 0.002). Apolipoprotein B fell on simvastatin from 1.9 to 1.4 g.l-1 (-24%) and from 1.8 to 1.4 g.l-1 (-22%) during fenofibrate. Both drugs were well tolerated and had no significant adverse effects. Simvastatin lowered total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations more than fenofibrate, while the latter had more effect on triglycerides, suggesting specific indications for the two drugs in the treatment of hyperlipoproteinaemias.", 
    "60": "The efficacy and safety of 20 mg simvastatin (a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor) and of 16 g cholestyramine daily in the treatment of 34 hypercholesterolaemic patients have been compared after dietary treatment and stratified randomization. The effect of combined treatment with the two drugs was studied in 5 patients with severe hypercholesterolaemia. After 6 weeks of treatment the simvastatin group showed a significantly greater (p less than 0.05) decrease in the mean total plasma cholesterol concentration from 7.88 to 5.48 mmol/l than in the cholestyramine group in whom there was a fall from 7.82 to 6.73 mmol/l. Simvastatin decreased the mean plasma LDL cholesterol concentration from 6.07 to 3.76 mml/l and cholestyramine decreased it from 6.16 to 4.46 mmol/l. Simvastatin also reduced the mean plasma total triglycerides by 24%, VLDL triglycerides by 20% and VLDL cholesterol by 36%, while cholestyramine led to increases in these parameters by 64%, 85% and 63%, respectively. Mean plasma HDL cholesterol concentration and the subfractions HDL2 and HDL3 cholesterol were significantly increased by simvastatin. Simvastatin and cholestyramine reduced the mean plasma apolipoprotein B concentration by 28% and 13%, respectively. The mean plasma apolipoprotein A-I concentration was significantly higher only on simvastatin treatment. Simvastatin did not cause any subjective or objective side effects, while cholestyramine caused gastrointestinal problems in 31% of patients. Small increases in serum alanine aminotransferase (S-ALT) activity were seen with both drugs. Cholestyramine significantly raised the serum alkaline phosphatase (S-ALP) although to a level still within the normal range. It is concluded that 20 mg simvastatin was more effective than 16 g cholestyramine in the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "61": "Low density lipoprotein (LDL), modified by chemical or biological means, was shown to induce macrophage cholesterol accumulation. The cholesterol and protein contents of LDL were decreased (by 10 and 15%, respectively) by incubation of the LDL for 2 h at 37 degrees C with normal washed platelet suspension or with platelet-conditioned medium; these decreases were not affected by platelet activation. The platelet-modified LDL caused a greater increase (by up to 15%) in collagen-induced, in vitro platelet aggregation than control LDL. Incubation of mouse peritoneal macrophages with platelet-modified LDL for 18 h at 37 degrees C resulted in an elevation of the macrophage cholesterol ester content (by 35-50%) as well as an increase in the cholesterol esterification rate (by 40-70%), compared with the effect of control LDL. Macrophage cholesterol synthesis, however, was significantly decreased (by 40-50%), compared with the effect of control LDL. The effect of LDL treated by platelet-conditioned medium was similar to that of platelet-modified LDL. The effect of platelet-modified LDL on macrophage cholesterol esterification was maximal within 24 h of incubation, and it was not significantly affected by inhibition of cholesterol synthesis. The platelet-modified LDL was taken up by the macrophages in a saturable fashion and its uptake was competitively inhibited by LDL, but not by acetylated LDL. We conclude that platelet-modified LDL interacts with the LDL receptor and induces macrophage cholesterol accumulation. Since the modified lipoprotein induces in vitro foam cell formation and platelet activation, platelet-modified LDL could be considered to be pro-atherogenic.", 
    "62": "We examined the long-term effect of pravastatin, a new potent inhibitor of endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis, on glucose and lipid metabolism in hyperlipidemic NIDDM. Ten patients (5 on sulfonylurea, 5 on diet) were studied over 12 months. Five were WHO type IIa and 5 were type IIb. Blood was taken before and then 1, 6 and 12 months after initiating 10 or 20 mg daily of pravastatin. The cholesterol concentration in whole plasma and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), plasma triglyceride and apolipoprotein (apo) B were all significantly decreased within the first month. These changes lasted for 1 year. High density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol increased in the first month but returned to base line thereafter. Low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol tended to decrease in the first month, and was suppressed significantly from the 6th month (11%) to the 12th month (16%). The effect of pravastatin on LDL-cholesterol in NIDDM was slower and weaker than that published for non-diabetic hypercholesterolemia. Therefore, the mechanism by which pravastatin suppresses plasma cholesterol levels in these two conditions may differ. After 1 year, no adverse effects were noted on hematopoietic, hepatic or renal function. Blood glucose level, hemoglobin A1c and the insulin response to oral glucose were unchanged. In addition, serum creatine phosphokinase showed no abnormal increase. Careful ophthalmological examinations before and after pravastatin treatment revealed no development of new lenticular opacities. Thus, pravastatin appears to be a safe and effective drug for the long-term treatment of NIDDM with hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "63": "Patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) constitute a unique population at high risk for the premature development of coronary artery disease (CAD) and in whom long-term hypocholesterolemic therapy to reduce elevated levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is most clearly indicated. Optimal therapy invariably requires diet regulation plus hypolipidemic drug therapy. When used as single agents, the bile-acid sequestrants, cholestyramine and colestipol, lower LDL cholesterol concentrations by 20% to 35% in compliant patients, whereas decreases of 20% to 30% can be achieved with nicotinic acid in doses of 3 to 6 g/day. Bezafibrate, fenofibrate, and ciprofibrate have also been shown to lower LDL cholesterol levels by 20% to 30%, and these drugs are more effective than gemfibrozil and clofibrate. Probucol, neomycin, and D-thyroxine reduce LDL cholesterol concentrations by 10% to 15% in single-drug use. Clinical trials with a new class of drugs that inhibit the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, and that includes lovastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin indicate that these drugs lower LDL cholesterol concentrations by 30% to 50% in patients with heterozygous FH. Combined drug therapy with a bile-acid sequestrant and nicotinic acid lowers LDL cholesterol by 40% to 55%, whereas fenofibrate, bezafibrate, or probucol plus a bile-acid sequestrant results in reductions varying from 25% to 50%. The combinations of an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor with either a bile-acid sequestrant or nicotinic acid appears to be the most promising, and these regimens reduce LDL cholesterol levels by 45% to 60%. With appropriate use, the currently available hypocholesterolemic drugs have the potential to markedly change the natural history of premature atherosclerosis that occurs in untreated patients with FH.", 
    "64": "Simvastatin, a new HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor, was administered to 27 patients for a period of one year. This drug caused a sustained decrease in total plasma- and LDL-cholesterol. No development of cataracts could be observed during this one year follow-up.", 
    "65": "Previous studies in young normal rats have shown that intracerebral administration of the proteinase inhibitor, leupeptin, caused a rapid accumulation of lipofuscin-like pigment in lysosomes of brain cells (Ivy et al., 1984a). On the other hand, we have recently found that the administration of lovastatin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, reduced the ceroid-like pigment and dolichol contents in the crushed epididymal fat pad of rats (Porta et al., 1988). In order to study now the possible modulating effects of these enzyme inhibitors on ceroidogenesis associated with vitamin E deficiency, two main groups of weanling Wistar female rats were respectively fed ad libitum a vitamin E-deficient basal diet, or the same diet supplemented with 16 mg% of dl-alpha-tocopherol acetate. The vitamin E-deficient and -supplemented rats were further subdivided and received for 8 weeks their diets alone or with 2, 1, or 0.5 g of lovastatin/kg of diet. Other subgroups were treated with constant peritoneal infusion of 0.5 mg/day of leupeptin by means of osmotic minipumps (Alzet 2002) consecutively implanted at days 15, 30, and 45. Lovastatin treatment to vitamin E-deficient rats was associated with dose-dependent toxicity, resulting in 100%, 75%, and 50% mortality at concentrations of 2, 1, and 0.5 g/kg diet, respectively. This mortality was mainly due to extensive hepatic necrosis. Food intake and growth rates were reduced, while the relative weights of liver, kidneys, spleen, heart and brain, as well as the serum levels of GPT and GOT were significantly increased over the values of the untreated vitamin E-deficient control rats. The volumetric densities of ceroid pigment and the dolichol contents in liver and kidneys were not significantly modified. Lovastatin toxicity was partially prevented by vitamin E supplementation. However, in these supplemented rats, lovastatin treatment did not modify the volumetric densities of hepatic and renal ceroid, although the contents of hepatic and renal dolichol were significantly increased. No correlations could be found between levels of hepatic or renal ceroid and total dolichol content in vitamin E-deficient and supplemented rats. Leupeptin treatment to vitamin E-deficient rats only slightly reduced food intake and growth rates, and did not significantly modify the relative organ weights or the serum levels of cholesterol, GOT and GPT. Although in both vitamin E-deficient and -supplemented rats the leupeptin treatment consistently showed a tendency to increase the volumetric densities of hepatic and renal ceroid pigment, the differences with the control untreated rats were not statistically significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "66": "The effect of lowering total serum cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol on platelet function, thromboxane formation and platelet sensitivity against PGI2 was studied in platelet-rich plasma ex vivo. Additionally, PGI2 receptors were determined in membrane preparations of these platelets. Twelve patients suffering from familial hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa (FH) were treated for 8 months with simvastatin (20-40 mg/day) and compared with 10 untreated FH patients and 10 untreated normocholesterolemic subjects. Compared with those of healthy controls, platelets of untreated FH patients were hyperreactive, as shown by an enhanced aggregation response and release of ATP and thromboxane after stimulation by collagen (0.3-5 micrograms/ml) and ADP (0.3-10 micrograms/ml). Simvastatin reduced the total and LDL serum cholesterol towards control levels while HDL cholesterol remained unchanged. This was accompanied by a significant decrease of platelet aggregation, thromboxane formation and ATP secretion being no more different from normocholesterolemic controls. In addition, the reduced platelet sensitivity against prostacyclin (aggregation, stimulation of cAMP formation) in untreated FH patients was improved to normal values by simvastatin. This was associated with a significant elevation of the reduced prostacyclin binding sites and might be explained by an improved access of prostacyclin to its receptors at platelet membranes. These data demonstrate that the reduction of total and LDL serum cholesterol by simvastatin results in a normalization of platelet function by (i) reduction of platelet hyperreactivity and (ii) improvement of the sensitivity against prostacyclin towards normal via enhanced PGI2-binding sites.",

    "68": "Twenty-four acutely ill schizophrenic patients (DSM-III-R), 18-42 years old, were treated for 6 weeks with sulpiride. Sulpiride was administered in three different daily dosages (starting with 400, 800 or 1200 mg) according to a double blind randomized administration schedule. The monoamine metabolites (MAM) homovanillic acid (HVA), 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenylglycol (HMPG) and the amino acids tyrosine, tryptophan, glutamate and glutamine were measured in serum before treatment and once a week during treatment. There were no significant differences between healthy controls and schizophrenic patients in serum levels of monoamine metabolites and amino acids before treatment. There was no dose-response effect of sulpiride on serum levels of the monoamine metabolites or the amino acids. The results are therefore based on the whole group of patients. During treatment the HMPG levels were reduced at all points in time. The serum level of HVA was significantly reduced after 6 weeks. The 5-HIAA and the amino acid levels were not changed during treatment. There were no significant correlations among the monoamine metabolites before treatment. During treatment, however, significant correlations were found among MAM and amino acids. Since the biochemical findings during the treatment were not related to the dose or the concentration of sulpiride the results may be related to secondary biochemical effects of sulpiride and/or to changes in the clinical state following treatment.", 
    "69": "The effects of a potent HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, lovastatin, was studied in male Syrian Golden hamsters. Lovastatin (0.1% in food for 6 days) increased hamster serum triglycerides by 12-fold with 2.4-fold increase in serum cholesterol. On continuous treatment serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels gradually decreased to below control values by 12-18 days. When hamsters were fed a mixture of lovastatin and Na-mevalonate no increase in serum triglyceride was observed. [14C]Cholesterol synthesis was increased by 266-fold in livers of hamsters fed lovastatin for 6 days. The increased synthesis of endogenous mevalonate metabolites may be a reason for the decrease in triglyceride levels after 6 days in our studies. The present study suggests that a mevalonate metabolite(s) is necessary for normal triglyceride metabolism in hamsters.", 
    "70": "The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of simvastatin (20 mg twice a day) in the treatment of hyperlipidaemia due to unremitting nephrotic syndrome was compared with that of cholestyramine (8 g twice a day) in a crossover trial in ten patients. Two patients were taken off the protocol, one because he could not tolerate cholestyramine and one because of non-compliance with the cholestyramine regimen. No clinical or laboratory adverse experiences were noticed during the study in the other eight patients. Simvastatin was significantly more effective than cholestyramine in reducing the hyperlipidaemia--it produced a 36% decrease in total cholesterol and a 39% decrease in low density (LDL)-cholesterol, whereas cholestyramine reduced total cholesterol by 8% and LDL-cholesterol by 19%. With simvastatin the apolipoprotein B level decreased by 30%, whereas the apolipoprotein A level increased by 10%.", 
    "71": "Retroviruses code for a virus-specific protease which is essential for polyprotein processing and viral infectivity. The human immune deficiency virus-1 protease is an aspartic protease of 9 kDa which was synthesized by recombinant DNA technology and arises by autocatalytic processing from a polyprotein precursor which has recently been demonstrated by use of a protease-specific monoclonal antibody. The protease was shown to form dimers. Here we demonstrate that synthetic peptides can be used as both model substrates as well as inhibitors for investigation of the protease. 14 synthetic peptides, 7-18 amino acids in length, containing putative protease cleavage sites of the viral polyprotein gag and pol precursors, have been analyzed with the partially purified protease by the use of high performance liquid chromatography. In seven cases, where cleavage was observed, the length of the peptides did not significantly influence the cleavage efficiencies, heptapeptides being large enough as model substrates. No cleavage was observed with a protein preparation purified in parallel from control bacteria not expressing the human immune deficiency virus-1 protease. The protease was not only able to cut next to a proline but also between other peptides indicating that the proline is not a prerequisite. Three peptides with either reduced bonds at the cleavage site or a substitution by statin were inhibitory while another uncleaved substrate was not. The usefulness of small model substrates for characterization of the protease is further demonstrated by determination of a kinetic optimum pH (3.5-5.5) and incubation temperature (37 degrees C).", 
    "72": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death among whites with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Several risk factors--dyslipidemia induced by NIDDM, obesity, hypertension and hyperglycemia--likely contribute to accelerated atherosclerosis. The dyslipidemia in NIDDM is characterized by abnormalities in composition and metabolism of very low density lipoproteins, low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL). However, because of the lack of long-term prospective epidemiologic studies, the relative importance of lipoprotein risk factors in the causation of CAD in diabetic patients is not clear. The World Health Organization Multinational Study of vascular disease in diabetics observed increased prevalence of CAD in diabetic populations with relatively high levels of plasma cholesterol and supports the concept that lowering cholesterol levels may significantly reduce coronary risk in NIDDM. To determine the effectiveness of lovastatin, an inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase, for lowering cholesterol levels, 16 patients with NIDDM and mild to moderate increases in plasma cholesterol were given lovastatin (20 mg twice daily) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled manner for 4 weeks. Compared with the placebo, lovastatin reduced concentrations of total cholesterol (233 +/- 10 vs 172 +/- 7 mg/dl [standard error of the mean], p less than 0.001), LDL cholesterol (140 +/- 9 vs 101 +/- 6 mg/dl, p less than 0.001), and LDL apolipoprotein-B (108 +/- 16 vs 80 +/- 16 mg/dl, p less than 0.001). Plasma triglycerides and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels also decreased by 31 and 42%, respectively. Although HDL cholesterol levels did not increase, the total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio decreased significantly with lovastatin therapy. No adverse effects were noted and glycemic control was well-maintained.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "73": "A randomized, double-blind 12-week comparison of lovastatin and gemfibrozil in the treatment of patients with primary hypercholesterolemia with normal or moderately elevated triglycerides was performed in 334 patients from 19 centers in Finland. Patients with \"high\" total serum cholesterol (240 to 300 mg/dl) constituted Stratum 1 and patients with \"very high\" total serum cholesterol (greater than 300 mg/dl) constituted Stratum 2. In Stratum 1, patients were randomly assigned to either lovastatin 20 mg nightly or gemfibrozil 600 mg twice daily, and in Stratum 2 to either lovastatin 40 mg nightly or gemfibrozil 600 mg twice daily. In both strata, the lovastatin dose was doubled after 6 weeks if serum cholesterol remained greater than 200 mg/dl. Ninety-two and 93% of the patients doubled their dose in Strata 1 and 2, respectively, resulting in average doses of 38.5 mg/day (Stratum 1) and 77.4 mg/day (Stratum 1) and 77.4 mg/day (Stratum 2) by week 12. The dose of gemifibrozil was kept constant. Lovastatin reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 31 and 42% in Stratum 1 and 2, respectively. The corresponding reductions achieved by gemfibrozil were 13 and 18%. In both strata, as well as in patients with Type IIa and IIb hyperlipoproteinemia, lovastatin was approximately 2 to 4 times as effective as gemfibrozil in lowering LDL cholesterol. Although both drugs increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations, gemfibrozil was 1.5 to 3 times more effective. LDL/HDL cholesterol ratios decreased significantly more during lovastatin therapy. Both drugs reduced serum triglyceride levels, but gemfibrozil was much more effective.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "74": "The efficacy of lovastatin, a potent inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase, has been established by numerous studies. At doses of 40 mg administered twice daily, lovastatin produces a mean reduction in total plasma cholesterol of 33%, attributable to a reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 41%. The drug also produces a mean increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 9%, and a reduction in the high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio of 44%. The serious reported adverse effects of lovastatin are myopathy (0.5%) and asymptomatic but marked and persistent increases in transaminases (1.9%). Both are reversible when therapy is discontinued. Myopathy has occurred mainly in patients with complicated histories who were receiving concomitant therapy with immunosuppressive drugs, gemfibrozil or niacin. In an ongoing long-term safety study, 744 patients have received lovastatin for an average duration of 2.5 years up to March 1988. Fifteen patients (2.0%) have been withdrawn because of drug-attributable adverse events: raised transaminases (9), skin rash (2), gastrointestinal symptoms (2), myopathy (1) and insomnia (1). No effect of the drug on the human lens has been observed up to the date mentioned above. Lovastatin has been available in the United States since September 1987. By March 1988, the drug had been prescribed for approximately 250,000 patients. This clinical experience has confirmed the tolerability observed in clinical trials. The good adverse-effect profile of lovastatin is thus now supported both by a substantial body of data in patients treated for over 2 years in clinical trials, and by experience in clinical use with a large number of patients since the drug has been available for prescription.", 
    "75": "Administration of lovastatin to animals at high dosage levels produces a broad spectrum of toxicity. This toxicity is expected based on the critical nature of the target enzyme (HMG CoA reductase) and the magnitude of the dosage levels used. The information reviewed in this paper demonstrates that these adverse findings in animals do not predict significant risk in humans. The reason for this derives from the fact that all the available evidence suggests that the adverse effects observed are produced by an exaggeration of the desired biochemical effect of the drug at high dosage levels. The presence of clear and high no-effect doses for these toxic effects along with the fact that most of the changes observed are clearly mechanism-based (directly attributable to inhibition of mevalonate synthesis) indicate that it is unlikely that similar changes will be observed at the therapeutic dosage levels in humans. This hypothesis is supported by the extensive human safety experience described by Tobert in the following report.", 
    "76": "Cholesterol is a 27-carbon steroid that is an essential component of the cell membrane, the immediate precursor of steroid hormones, the substrate for the formation of bile acids, and is required for the assembly of very low density lipoprotein in the liver. Because as much as two-thirds of total body cholesterol in patients is of endogenous origin, an effective means to control cholesterogenesis may occur by inhibition of its biosynthesis. Cholesterol is biosynthesized in a series of more than 25 separate enzymatic reactions that initially involve the formation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA). Early attempts to pharmacologically block cholesterol synthesis focused only on steps later in the biosynthetic pathway and resulted in compounds with unacceptable toxicity. Recent research had identified that HMG CoA reductase is a key rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway and is responsible for the conversion of HMG CoA to mevalonate. Additional research with fungal metabolites identified a series of compounds with potent inhibiting properties for this target enzyme, from which lovastatin was selected for clinical development. A reduction in cholesterol synthesis by lovastatin has been subsequently confirmed in cell culture, animal studies and in humans. A resultant decrease in circulating total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol has also been demonstrated in animals and humans. Because hepatic LDL receptors are the major mechanism of LDL clearance from the circulation, further animal research has confirmed that these declines in cholesterol are accompanied by an increase in hepatic LDL receptor activity. Lovastatin effectively diminishes endogenous cholesterol synthesis providing useful therapeutic properties for patients with hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "77": "Effects of MK-733 on the absorption and excretion of cholesterol in rabbits were examined using [3H]cholesterol. The animals were divided into six groups; three groups were fed a normal diet, and the other groups a cholesterol diet. MK-733 was administered orally as a single dose of 10 mg/kg on day 8, or multiple doses of 10 mg/kg once a day for 14 days. On the 8th day, [3H]cholesterol was given orally to each animal. In the groups fed a normal diet, single and consecutive administration of MK-733 did not affect the absorption and excretion of [3H]cholesterol. In the cholesterol-fed groups, however, single administration of MK-733 decreased the serum 3H radioactivity slightly, but did not affect the fecal excretion of [3H]cholesterol. However, the consecutive treatment with MK-733 clearly reduced the serum 3H radioactivity. The cumulative excretion of the fecal radioactivity of [3H]cholesterol in the MK-733 group (multiple) was higher than that in the control group. From these results, it is concluded that MK-733 inhibits the absorption of cholesterol from the gastrointestinal wall in cholesterol-fed rabbits.", 
    "78": "Trans-tetrahydro-4-hydroxy-6-[1-aryl-7-naphthalenyl]-2H-pyran-2-ones of general structure 4 were prepared and tested for inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase in vitro. In contrast to previously described biphenyl lactones (2) containing an ethenyl linkage, linkage of the pyranone ring to the aryl moiety in these compounds is via a rigid aromatic ring system, which still allows free rotation of the aryl rings. The imposed conformational constraint is compatible with activity, since members of the series had activity in range 1-20 microM (IC50 values).", 
    "79": "The correlation between low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor activity and concentrations of lipids and apolipoproteins in serum was examined in 12 subjects with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and in four with non-FH type II hyperlipoproteinemia. Concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and of apolipoproteins (apo) A-I, C-II, and C-III were significantly positively correlated with LDL receptor activity, whereas LDL receptor activity was significantly inversely correlated with LDL cholesterol and apo B concentrations, and with apo ratios B/A-I and B/A-II. Neither total serum cholesterol, triglyceride, phospholipid, apo A-I, nor apo E concentrations correlated significantly with LDL receptor activity. Multiple regression analysis, with LDL receptor activity as the dependent variable, revealed concentrations of apo B and apo C-II to be the principal determinant factors. To confirm this, we subsequently calculated the LDL receptor activities before and after administration of CS-514, an inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (EC 1.1.1.88), which increases the hepatic LDL receptor activity and decreases the concentration of cholesterol in serum. This drug increased calculated LDL receptor activities significantly, with a significant decrease in serum cholesterol.", 
    "80": "Two enzymes of mammalian cellular mevalonate biosynthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase and HMG-CoA reductase, have been shown to be regulated by exogenous sterols. It has been demonstrated that these enzymes are regulated, at least in part, by transcriptional control of their synthesis. We have previously described a somatic cell mutant (CR1) of the CHO-K1 cell line that is defective in regulation of the activity of these enzymes in response to exogenous sterols. In this report, we demonstrate that this mutant is defective in regulation of the mRNA levels for HMG-CoA reductase and HMG-CoA synthase by 25-hydroxycholesterol and mevinolin. In the case of HMG-CoA reductase, this loss of apparent transcriptional control is not accompanied by a comparable loss in regulation of synthesis of this enzyme. This observation is consistent with prior studies suggesting that HMG-CoA reductase can be regulated translationally. We also show that CR1 cells exhibit a constitutively rapid rate of degradation of HMG-CoA reductase.", 
    "81": "To examine whether cytosolic acetyl-CoA hydrolase in rat liver is involved in regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis, we investigated the alteration of the enzyme activity under conditions of stimulation (cholestyramine treatment) and suppression [cholesterol feeding, a potent competitive inhibitor of microsomal 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (CS 514) treatment, and a hypolipidemic drug [alpha-(p-chlorophenoxy)isobutyric acid, CPIB] injection) of cholesterol biosynthesis. The enzyme activity in rat liver increased significantly in the early diabetic, cholesterol-fed, CS 514-, and CPIB-treated groups, but no change in its activity was observed in chronic diabetic groups. Cholestyramine treatment to cholesterol-fed rats made the enzyme activity return to the initial level. When chronic diabetic rats were given a cholesterol diet or treated with CS 514 or CPIB, the activity increased significantly. Inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis caused by these treatments induced increase in the enzyme activity with increase in the enzyme protein, judging from results obtained by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. These results suggest that this enzyme has a physiological role in maintenance of the equilibrium between the cytosolic acetyl-CoA concentration and CoA-SH pool for cholesterol metabolism."
