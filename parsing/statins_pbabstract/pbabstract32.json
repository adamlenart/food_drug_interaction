Studies have demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target genes are involved in the formation of atherosclerosis and that atorvastatin might reduce atherosclerotic plaques by regulating the expression of miRNAs. However, the related mechanism is not yet known. In this study, we first investigated the effects of atorvastatin on miR-126 and its target gene, i.e., vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in apolipoprotein E-knockout (ApoE-/-) mice with carotid atherosclerotic plaque in vivo. We compared the expressions of miR-126 and VCAM-1 between the control, atherosclerotic model and atorvastatin treatment groups of ApoE-/- mice using RT-PCR and Western blot. We found the miR-126 expression was significantly down-regulated, and the VCAM-1 expression was significantly up-regulated in the atherosclerotic model group, which accelerated the progression of atherosclerosis in the ApoE-/- mice. These results following atorvastatin treatment indicated that miR-126 expression was significantly up-regulated, VCAM-1 expression was significantly down-regulated and atherosclerotic lesions were reduced. The present results might explain the mechanism by which miR-126 is involved in the formation of atherosclerosis in vivo. Our study first indicated that atorvastatin might exert its anti-inflammatory effects in atherosclerosis by regulating the expressions of miR-126 and VCAM-1 in vivo.", 
    "1": "Few data are present in the literature on the relationship between atorvastatin use and acute pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to explore this issue in Taiwan. Using representative claims data established from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Program, this case-control study consisted of 5810 cases aged 20 to 84 years with a first-time diagnosis of acute pancreatitis during the period 1998 to 2011and 5733 randomly selected controls without acute pancreatitis. Both cases and controls were matched by sex, age, comorbidities, and index year of diagnosing acute pancreatitis. Subjects who at least received 1 prescription for other statins or nonstatin lipid-lowering drugs were excluded from the study. If subjects never had 1 prescription for atorvastatin, they were defined as never use of atorvastatin. Current use of atorvastatin was defined as subjects whose last remaining 1 tablet of atorvastatin was noted \u22647 days before the date of diagnosing acute pancreatitis. Late use of atorvastatin was defined as subjects whose last remaining 1 tablet of atorvastatin was noted >7 days before the date of diagnosing acute pancreatitis. The odds ratio with 95% confidence interval of acute pancreatitis associated with atorvastatin use was calculated by using the logistic regression analysis. The logistic regression analysis revealed that the odds ratio of acute pancreatitis was 1.67 for subjects with current use of atorvastatin (95% confidence interval 1.18, 2.38), when compared with subjects with never use of atorvastatin. The odds ratio decreased to 1.15 for those with late use of atorvastatin (95% confidence interval 0.87, 1.52), but without statistical significance. Current use of atorvastatin is associated with the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Clinically, clinicians should consider the possibility of atorvastatin-associated acute pancreatitis when patients present with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis without a definite etiology but are taking atorvastatin.", 
    "2": "In this study, an injectable in situ-forming gel has been designed and fabricated for the controlled and prolonged release of pitavastatin calcium (Pit) for treating hyperlipidemia. By mixing phospholipids and soybean oil with ethanol, the phospholipid-based platform material (PSE) displayed in a sol state with low viscosity in vitro. After subcutaneous injection, pregel solution underwent rapid-phase separation and gelation in situ thus forming a drug release depot. Pit was loaded within PSE (PSE-P), which achieved prolonged release profiles for 15 consecutive days in vitro. Correspondingly, the pharmacokinetic study in rats demonstrated that PSE-P achieved sustained in vivo release for 15 days after 1 subcutaneous injection. The pharmacodynamic study in hyperlipidemia rats further revealed that the levels of total cholesterol, total triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein decreased remarkably, and the in vivo therapeutic effect was well maintained for over 20 days. Additionally, PSE-P showed mild tissue inflammatory responses and excellent degradability in vivo. Thus, in situ-forming PSE-P gel represents a viable and promising drug delivery platform to achieve long-term therapeutic effects in the management of hyperlipidemia.", 
    "3": "We recently developed several new relaxation filter-selective signal excitation (RFS) methods for (13)C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) that allow (13)C signal extraction of the target components from pharmaceuticals. These methods were successful in not only qualification but also quantitation over the wide range of 5% to 100%. Here, we aimed to improve the sensitivity of these methods and initially applied them to (19)F solid-state NMR, on the basis that the fluorine atom is one of the most sensitive NMR-active nuclei. For testing, we selected atorvastatin calcium (ATC), an antilipid BCS class II drug that inhibits 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and is marketed in crystalline and amorphous forms. Tablets were obtained from 2 generic drug suppliers, and the ATC content occurred mainly as an amorphous form. Using the RFS method with (19)F solid-state NMR, we succeeded in qualifying trace amounts (less than 0.5% w/w level) of crystalline phase (Form I) of ATC in the tablets. RFS methods with (19)F solid-state NMR are practical and time efficient and can contribute not only to the study of pharmaceutical drugs, including those with small amounts of a highly potent active ingredient within a formulated product, but also to the study of fluoropolymers in material sciences.",

ADR nephropathy was induced by a single intravenous injection of ADR into the tail vein. All mice were sacrificed at the end of the 7th week, with the blood, 24-h urine and kidneys collected. The levels of ox-LDL and total cholesterol in the serum, the serum CXCL16, ox-LDL and NF-\u03baB expression were detected.", 
    "6": "Compared with the NC group, the levels of serum total cholesterol and ox-LDL in the ADR and ADR-SIM groups were significantly higher, the level of serum albumin was significantly lower and the expression of CXCL16, ox-LDL and NF-\u03baB in the renal tissue of ADR and ADR-SIM groups was significantly increased. Compared with the ADR group, the expressions of renal CXCL16, ox-LDL and NF-\u03baB in the ADR-SIM group were significantly decreased. Levels of serum total cholesterol and ox-LDL were not significantly different between the two groups.",

These patients were then treated with simvastatin (40 mg daily), micronized fenofibrate (200 mg daily), or simvastatin plus fenofibrate. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), inteleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) release, as well as circulating levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), were determined separately for patients aged between 20 and 50 years and between 51 and 75 years before the study and after 12 weeks of hypolipidaemic treatment.", 
    "10": "Older adults were characterised by higher monocyte release of TNF-alpha and interleukin-6, as well as higher circulating levels of hsCRP, than the younger subjects. The decrease in monocyte release of all investigated cytokines and in plasma hsCRP was similar in both age groups. In turn, the effect of fenofibrate, alone or in combination with simvastatin, on TNF-alpha, interleukin-6, and hsCRP, but not on interleukin-1beta and MCP-1, was stronger in patients aged between 50 and 75 years, and correlated with an improvement in insulin sensitivity only in this age group.",

    "14": "Patients in the age between 51 and 65 years had higher plasma levels of TNF-alpha and hsCRP, and lower plasma levels of adiponectin than patients aged between 35 and 50 years. In both age groups, simvastatin reduced plasma levels of hsCRP, leptin, visfatin, and TNF-alpha and increased circulating levels of adiponectin. This effect was particularly pronounced if simvastatin was administered in combination with ezetimibe. Ezetimibe alone increased plasma adiponectin and reduced plasma levels of leptin and hsCRP only in older adults. Irrespectively of age, ezetimibe administered alone did not affect visfatin and TNF-alpha. The effect of simvastatin on plasma hsCRP and the investigated adipokines did not differ between both groups. In turn, the effect of ezetimibe and simvastatin/ezetimibe combination therapy on leptin, adiponectin, and hsCRP was stronger in older than in younger adults.",

    "16": "Models of atherosclerosis are used in preclinical studies but often fail to translate to humans. A model that better reflects human atherosclerosis is necessary. We recently engineered the ExeGen\u2122 low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) miniswine, in which the LDL receptor gene is modified to drive hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis, and showed diet-related exacerbation of these phenotypes. Five groups of animals, either wild type (+/+) or heterozygous (+/-), were fed either a normal or high-fat diet for 6 months. One group of heterozygous pigs fed a high-fat diet was also administered atorvastatin at 3 mg/kg/day. Clinical chemistry and anatomic pathology parameters were measured biweekly and at termination. The high-fat diet resulted in increased adiposity and interspersion of adipocytes within the salivary glands. The heterozygous pigs on the high-fat diet gained more weight and had significant increases in total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, and LDL compared to wild-type animals or heterozygous animals fed a normal diet. Atorvastatin attenuated these parameters, indicating the statin had a beneficial effect, even in a high-fat diet scenario. Atorvastatin treatment also reduced the intensity of Oil Red O staining in pigs on high-fat diet. Atorvastatin-related amelioration of several indices of cardiovascular pathophysiology in this model underscores its utility for drug discovery.",

In this present study, suspension cultured cells of G. biloba were used to explore the regulation of the mevalonic acid (MVA) and methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathways in response to specific enzyme inhibitors (lovastatin and clomazone). The results showed that the biosynthesis of bilobalide was more highly correlated with the MVA pathway, and the biosynthesis of ginkgolides was more highly correlated with the MEP pathway.

However, the successful use of SV to increase bone formation in vivo largely depends on the local concentration of SV at the site of action, and there have been continuing efforts to develop an appropriate delivery system. Specifically, nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) systems have become a popular type of encapsulation carrier system. Therefore, SV-loaded NLCs (SNs) (179.4 nm in diameter) were fabricated in this study, and the osteogenic effect of the SNs was evaluated in a critical-sized rabbit calvarial defect. Our results revealed that the SNs significantly enhanced bone formation in vivo, as evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, immunohistochemistry, and a fluorescence analysis. Thus, this novel nanostructured carrier system could be a potential encapsulation carrier system for SV in bone regeneration applications.",

The present study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and prognosis of residual lipid abnormalities in statin-treated acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Subjects and Methods. A total of 3,047 ACS patients who underwent PCI and received statin therapy were included. Plasma concentrations of LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG were measured. For the follow-up study, major adverse cardiovascular cerebrovascular events (MACCE; including total death, cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and revascularization) were documented. Results. A total of 93.14% of all individuals were followed up for 18.1 months (range, 0-29.3 months). Of all 3,047 patients, those with a suboptimal goal were 67.75%, 85.85%, and 33.64% for LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG levels, respectively. Multiple Cox regression analysis revealed there were significant increases in cumulative MACCE of 41% (HR = 1.41, 95% CI [1.09-1.82], p = 0.008), and revascularization of 48% (HR = 1.48, 95% CI [1.10-1.99], p = 0.01) in low HDL-C patients with ACS after PCI, but not the high TG group at the end of study. Conclusions. Our results showed there is high rate of dyslipidemia in Chinese ACS patients after PCI. Importantly, low HDL-C but not high TG levels are associated with higher MACCE and revascularization rates in ACS patients after PCI.",

Our aim was to assess the effect of aggressive lipid-lowering therapy with rosuvastatin on plaque regression and instability. Thirty-seven patients with stable angina or silent myocardial ischemia who planned to undergo elective percutaneous coronary intervention and had angioscopic yellow plaques of grade 2 or more were randomized to high-dose (group H, 20 mg/day, n = 18) or low-dose (group L, 2.5 mg/day, n = 19) rosuvastatin therapy for 48 weeks. Yellow plaque was graded on a 4-point scale of 0 (white) to 3 (bright yellow) by angioscopy, and plaque volume was determined by intravascular ultrasound for plaques with a length of 5 to 15 mm. Color and volume were assessed at baseline and after 48 weeks by the investigators blinded to the rosuvastatin dosage, and were compared between the 2 dosing groups. The level of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol decreased from 130.3 \u00b1 25.5 mg/dl to 61.7 \u00b1 16.5 mg/dl (-50 \u00b1 19%: high intensity) in group H (p <0.001) and from 130.9 \u00b1 28.5 mg/dl to 89.7 \u00b1 29.0 mg/dl (-30 \u00b1 22%: moderate intensity) in group L (mean \u00b1 SD, p <0.001).

On the other hand, it has been reported that statins known as inhibitors of isoprenoid biosynthesis and cholesterol lowering agents, may have a direct antimicrobial effect on the some bacteria. The exact action of statins in microbial metabolism is not clearly understood. It is possible that statins inhibit synthesis or utilization of some sterol precursor necessary for bacterial membrane integrity. Accordingly, this study was designed in order to examine if statins inhibit the production of a compound, which can be used in the membrane, and whether cholesterol would replace it and rescue bacteria from toxic effects of statins.",

Fractions containing derivatives of these polysaccharides with molecular weight down to approximately 1 kDa still retained their inhibitory activity. Once digested LWE was applied to Caco2 in transport experiments, no significant effect was noticed on the modulation of cholesterol-related gene expression. But, when the lower compartment of the Caco2 monolayer was applied to HepG2, some genes were modulated (after 24 h). LWE was also administrated to normo- and hypercholesterolemic mice, and no significant lowering of serum cholesterol levels was observed; but reduction of triglycerides in liver was observed. However, LWE supplementation modulated the transcriptional profile of some genes involved in the cholesterol metabolism similarly to simvastatin, suggesting that it could hold potential as a hypolipidemic/hypocholesterolemic extract, although further dose-dependent studies should be carried out.", 
    "38": "Niacin was the first drug demonstrating lowered cholesterol prevents coronary heart disease (CHD) events, with two clinical CHD outcome studies establishing a cardioprotective niacin regimen: 1\u00a0g thrice daily with meals. Though cardioprotective, skin toxicity limits niacin's use, fostering several variations to improve tolerability. One of these, an extended-release (ER) alternative, proved immensely successful commercially, dominating clinical practice despite departing from the established regimen in several critical ways. Hence, improved tolerability may have come at the cost of diminished efficacy, posing a conundrum: Does it still help the population at risk for CHD to broaden a drug's acceptance by \"watering it down\"? This question is crucial at this stage now that the ER alternative failed to recapitulate the benefits of the established cardioprotective niacin regimen in two trials of the alternative approach: AIM-HIGH and HPS2-THRIVE. Part I of this review discusses how vastly the ER alternative departs from the established cardioprotective regimen, why that is important physiologically, and how it may explain the findings of AIM-HIGH and HPS2-THRIVE. Given important gaps left by statin therapy, the established cardioprotective niacin regimen remains an important evidence-based therapy for the statin intolerant or statin averse.",

Lovastatin selectively blocked the activation of Chk1 and ATR kinases following treatment with IR, Doxo and the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea, indicating that the statin antagonizes ATR/Chk1-regulated replicative stress responses. Part of the cytoprotective activity of lovastatin seems to rest on a delayed entry of lovastatin treated cells into S-phase. Yet, because the statin also protected non-proliferating keratinocytes from IR- and Doxo-induced cytotoxicity, cell cycle independent protective mechanisms are involved, too.",

    "43": "One of the major neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the deposition of amyloid \u03b2-protein (A\u03b2) in the brain. A\u03b2 accumulation seems to arise from an imbalance between A\u03b2 production and clearance. Neprilysin (NEP) and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) are the important A\u03b2-degrading enzymes in the brain, and deficits in their expression may promote A\u03b2 deposition in patients with sporadic late-onset AD. Statins, which are used clinically for reducing cholesterol levels, can exert beneficial effects on AD. Therefore, we examined whether various statins are associated with A\u03b2 degradation by inducing NEP and IDE expression, and then evaluating the relation between activation of intracellular signaling transduction, inhibition of cholesterol production, and morphological changes to astrocytes. Treating cultured rat astrocytes with simvastatin and atorvastatin significantly decreased the expression of NEP but not IDE in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The decrease in NEP expression was a result of activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) but not the reduction of cholesterol synthesis pathway. This NEP reduction was achieved by the release to the extracellular space of cultured astrocytes. Furthermore, the cultured medium prepared from simvastatin- and atorvastatin-treated astrocytes significantly induced the degradation of exogenous A\u03b2. These results suggest that simvastatin and atorvastatin induce the increase of A\u03b2 degradation of NEP on the extracellular of astrocytes by inducing ERK-mediated pathway activity and that these reagents regulate the differential mechanisms between the secretion of NEP, the induction of cholesterol reduction, and the morphological changes in the cultured astrocytes.", 
    "44": "We have previously demonstrated that hypercholesterolemic LDL receptor knockout (LDLr(-/-)) mice secrete less insulin than wild-type mice. Removing cholesterol from isolated islets using methyl-beta-cyclodextrin reversed this defect. In this study, we hypothesized that in vivo treatment of LDLr(-/-) mice with the HMGCoA reductase inhibitor pravastatin would improve glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Female LDLr(-/-) mice were treated with pravastatin (400mg/L) for 1-3 months. Isolated pancreatic islets were assayed for insulin secretion rates, intracellular calcium oscillations, cholesterol levels, NAD(P)H and SNARE protein levels, apoptosis indicators and lipidomic profile. Two months pravastatin treatment reduced cholesterol levels in plasma, liver and islets by 35%, 25% and 50%, respectively. Contrary to our hypothesis, pravastatin treatment increased fasting and fed plasma levels of glucose and decreased markedly (40%) fed plasma levels of insulin. In addition, ex vivo glucose stimulated insulin secretion was significantly reduced after two and three months (36-48%, p<0.05) of pravastatin treatment. Although reducing insulin secretion and insulinemia, two months pravastatin treatment did not affect glucose tolerance because it improved global insulin sensitivity. Pravastatin induced islet dysfunction was associated with marked reductions of exocytosis-related SNARE proteins (SNAP25, Syntaxin 1A, VAMP2) and increased apoptosis markers (Bax/Bcl2 protein ratio, cleaved caspase-3 and lower NAD(P)H production rates) observed in pancreatic islets from treated mice. In addition, several oxidized phospholipids, tri- and diacylglycerols and the proapoptotic lipid molecule ceramide were identified as markers of pravastatin-treated islets. Cell death and oxidative stress (H2O2 production) were confirmed in insulin secreting INS-1E cells treated with pravastatin. These results indicate that chronic treatment with pravastatin impairs the insulin exocytosis machinery and increases \u03b2-cell death.

Patients with FH in Hong Kong were found by the identification of potential probands with primary hypercholesterolemia manifesting total cholesterol levels greater than 7.5 mmol/L or LDL-C levels greater than 4.9 mmol/L and undertaking cascade screening of available relatives in the Department of Medicine & Therapeutics, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong since the early 1990s. Our previous study in a group of 252 subjects from 87 pedigrees clinically diagnosed as having heterozygous FH reported the mean plasma LDL-C level as 7.2\u00b11.5 mmol/L. Xanthomata were present in 40.6% of males and 54.8% of females. The prevalence of known CHD was relatively low at 9.9% in males and 8.5% in females. All FH patients were offered treatment with statins and many of them reached the LDL-C goal with a moderate or high dose of potent statin alone. Ezetimibe is usually added for patients who have not achieved target LDL-C levels on statin alone, particularly in patients with established CHD. Some FH patients who have not achieved the LDL-C targets with this combination have entered into clinical trials with new cholesterol-modifying agents such as the monoclonal antibodies to proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9. Increased awareness, early identification, and optimal treatment are essential to reduce the risk of CHD, increase life expectancy, and improve the quality of life of patients with FH.",

Seven and 30-day follow-ups from admission to hospitals were performed. The primary outcome of our study was myocardial reinfarction at 30 days after STEMI. The study population was stratified into 2 groups: STEMI patients with mayocardial reinfarction and without mayocardial reinfarction. Survival curve was constructed using Kaplan-Meier survival methods with log-rank statistics. Multivariable Cox regression model was performed to determine the risk factors for myocardial reinfarction events in STEMI patients.A total of 6876 STEMI patients were enrolled. The proportion of STEMI patients with previous stroke was 9.4%. Rate of 30-day myocardial reinfarction was 2.0% among all STEMI patients. Rate of 30-day myocardial reinfarction was 4.2% in STEMI patients with previous stroke which was statistically higher than that in STEMI patients without previous stroke (P\u200a<\u200a0.001). Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that previous stroke (HR, 3.673; 95% CI, 1.180-11.43) and statin use (HR, 0.230; 95% CI, 0.080-0.664) were independent predictors for 30-day myocardial reinfarction.A large proportion of STEMI patients had previous stroke history.

Wistar rats were treated for 30 days with simvastatin. On the 24th day after the start of treatment, each rat was administered lisdexamfetamine dimesylate for 7 days. The results suggest that simvastatin combined with lisdexamfetamine dimesylate induced a significant increased locomotion and lisdexamfetamine dimesylate administration causes an oxidative imbalance determined by an increment in lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and alterations in the activities of antioxidant enzymes in brain areas; moreover, in the presence of simvastatin, most of these effects were prevented. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the critical roles of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders, associated with increased oxidative stress and changes in antioxidant enzymatic defense. In view of the central role played by lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, the established antioxidant effect of simvastatin therapy is of major interest.", 
    "73": "Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) have great therapeutic potential for many diseases. However, the homing of BMSCs to injury sites remains a difficult problem. Recent evidence indicates that simvastatin stimulates AKT phosphorylation, and p-AKT affects the expression of chemokine (CXC motif) receptor-4 (CXCR4). Therefore, simvastatin may improve the expression of CXCR4 in BMSCs, and microRNAs (miRs) may participate in this process. In this study, we demonstrated that simvastatin increased both the total and the surface expression of CXCR4 in BMSCs. Stromal cell-derived factor-1\u03b1 (SDF-1\u03b1)-induced migration of BMSCs was also enhanced by simvastatin, and this action was inhibited by AMD 3100(a chemokine receptor antagonist for CXCR4). The PI3K/AKT pathway was activated by simvastatin in this process, and LY294002 reversed the overexpression of CXCR4 caused by simvastatin. MiR-9 directly targeted CXCR4 in rat BMSCs, and simvastatin decreased miR-9 expression. P-AKT affected the expression of miR-9; as the phosphorylation of AKT increased, miR-9 expression decreased. In addition, LY294002 increased miR-9 expression. Taken together, our results indicated that simvastatin improved the migration of BMSCs via the PI3K/AKT pathway. MiR-9 also participated in this process, and the phosphorylation of AKT affected miR-9 expression, suggesting that simvastatin might have beneficial effects in stem cell therapy.",

But the biological graft-bone healing still remains a problem. Previous studies have shown that simvastatin (SIM) stimulates bone formation. The objective of this study was to investigate whether surface coating with collagen containing low-dose SIM microsphere could enhance the surface biocompatibility of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) artificial ligaments to accelerate graft-to-bone healing. The in vitro studies demonstrated that bone marrow stromal cells on the collagen-coated PET scaffolds (COL/PET) and simvastatin/collagen-coated PET scaffolds (SIM/COL/PET) proliferated vigorously. Compared with the PET group and the COL/PET group, SIM could induce bone marrow stromal cells' osteoblastic differentiation, high alkaline phosphatase activity, more mineralization deposition, and more expression of osteoblast-related genes, such as osteocalcin, runt-related transcription factor 2, bone morphogenetic protein-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor, in the SIM/COL/PET group. In vivo, rabbits received ACL reconstruction with different scaffolds. Histological analysis demonstrated that graft-bone healing was significantly greater with angiogenesis and osteogenesis in the SIM/COL/PET group than the other groups. In addition, biomechanical testing at the eighth week demonstrated a significant increase in the ultimate failure load and stiffness in the SIM/COL/PET group. The low dose of SIM-sustained release from SIM/COL/PET promoted the graft-bone healing via its effect on both angiogenesis and osteogenesis. This study suggested that collagen containing low-dose SIM microsphere coating on the surface of PET artificial ligaments could be potentially applied for ACL reconstruction.",

They were initially designed as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutharyl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoAR) inhibitors to treat patients with hypercholesterolemia. Recent studies on HCV chronically infected individuals have suggested that their use in vivo in combination with PEG-IFN and ribavirin favor the sustained viral response (SVR). Herein, we describe the effects of a set of statins on HCV entry and on HCV key entry factors in vitro. Our results suggest that all tested statins exert a proviral effect through the upregulation of LDLR. Interestingly, at higher concentration, we also provide evidence of a yet unknown competing antiviral effect of statins (except for pravastatin) through the downregulation of CLDN-1. Importantly, this work enlightens the blunt proviral effect of pravastatin at the entry step of HCV in vitro.",

    "101": "Vascular calcification, both in the coronary and in the peripheral arteries, is associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) risk. However, agents that prevent vascular calcification (e.g. estrogens or calcimimetic agents) might have neutral or detrimental effects on CV events. Moreover, statins and antihypertensive agents do not appear to modify vascular calcification, despite their established benefits on CV disease prevention. On the other hand, recent data suggest that microRNAs play a role in the regulation of vascular calcification. It is therefore possible that modulation of the expression of microRNAs might represent a useful strategy for preventing or delaying the progression of this process.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin in diabetic rats. 2. Diabetes was induced in rats by combination of high-fat diet and low-dose streptozotocin (35\u2009mg/kg). Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin following oral (10\u2009mg/kg) and intravenous (2\u2009mg/kg) administrations to rats were measured by LC-MS. Metabolism and uptake of atorvastatin in primary hepatocytes of experimental rats were assessed. Protein expressions and activities of hepatic Cyp3a and Oatp2 were further investigated. 3. Clearances of atorvastatin in diabetic rats following oral and intravenous administrations were remarkably increased, leading to marked decreases in area-under-the-plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). The estimated oral and systematic clearances of atorvastatin in diabetic rats were 4.5-fold and 2.0-fold of control rats, respectively. Metabolism and uptake of atorvastatin in primary hepatocytes isolated from diabetic rats were significantly increased, which were consistent with the up-regulated protein expressions and activities of hepatic Cyp3a and Oatp2. 4. All these results demonstrated that the plasma exposure of atorvastatin was significantly decreased in diabetic rats, which was partly due to the up-regulated activities and expressions of both hepatic Cyp3a and Oatp2.",

Several factors seem to affect vitamin D metabolism, including the suggestion that therapy with the lipid lowering HMG-CoA inhibitors might modulate vitamin D levels. However, the relationship between statins intake and serum levels of vitamin D is still controversial. The present work aimed to add new insights on the association between statins therapy, and more specifically the generation of statins, and the lipid profile in a population of 106 subjects treated with these HMG-CoA inhibitors. Data showed that despite a higher prevalence of hipovitaminosis D in subjects treated with statins, there is no association between statin generation, total and LDL cholesterol and vitamin D levels. Moreover, second generation statins, the most common treatment of hypercholesterolemia in the studied population, promoted the remodelling of serum fatty acids that was characterized by the increase of arachidonic acid (AA) relative levels without affecting eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) levels. Among statin treated subjects, vitamin D levels did not affect serum fatty acid profile. The statin-related increased ratio AA/EPA suggests a pro- inflammatory status, whose long-term impact should be better clarified in the future.",

Experimental and epidemiological evidence further implies an anticancer effect of these substances. This study investigates the mechanism underlying human lung cancer cell death by lovastatin and the role of the prostaglandin (PG)-synthesizing enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in this process. In A549 and H358 lung carcinoma cells the lipophilic prodrug lovastatin lactone led to a concentration-dependent decrease of viability and induction of DNA fragmentation, whereas its HMG-CoA-inhibitory, ring-open acid form was inactive in this respect. Apoptotic cell death by lovastatin was accompanied by high intracellular levels of the lactone form, by upregulation of COX-2 mRNA and protein, as well as by increased formation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3)-activating PGD2 and 15-deoxy-\u039412,14-PGJ2. Cells were significantly less sensitive to lovastatin-induced apoptotic cell death, when the expression or activity of COX-2 was suppressed by siRNA or by the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398. Apoptosis by lovastatin was likewise reversed by the PPAR\u03b3 antagonist GW9662. Fluorescence microscopy analyses revealed a lovastatin-induced cytosol-to-nucleus translocation of PPAR\u03b3 that was inhibited by NS-398. Collectively, this study demonstrates COX-2 induction and subsequent COX-2-dependent activation of PPAR\u03b3 as a hitherto unknown mechanism by which lovastatin lactone induces human lung cancer cell death.", 
    "115": "Finding pleiomorphic targets for drugs allows new indications or warnings for treatment to be identified. As test of concept, we applied a new chemical genomics approach to uncover additional targets for the widely prescribed lipid-lowering pro-drug simvastatin. We used mRNA extracted from internal mammary artery from patients undergoing coronary artery surgery to prepare a viral cardiovascular protein library, using T7 bacteriophage. We then studied interactions of clones of the bacteriophage, each expressing a different cardiovascular polypeptide, with surface-bound simvastatin in 96-well plates. To maximise likelihood of identifying meaningful interactions between simvastatin and vascular peptides, we used a validated photo-immobilisation method to apply a series of different chemical linkers to bind simvastatin so as to present multiple orientations of its constituent components to potential targets. Three rounds of biopanning identified consistent interaction with the clone expressing part of the gene GJC3, which maps to Homo sapiens chromosome 7, and codes for gap junction gamma-3 protein, also known as connexin 30.2/31.3 (mouse connexin Cx29). Further analysis indicated the binding site to be for the N-terminal domain putatively 'regulating' connexin hemichannel and gap junction pores. Using immunohistochemistry we found connexin 30.2/31.3 to be present in samples of artery similar to those used to prepare the bacteriophage library. Surface plasmon resonance revealed that a 25 amino acid synthetic peptide representing the discovered N-terminus did not interact with simvastatin lactone, but did bind to the hydrolysed HMG CoA inhibitor, simvastatin acid. This interaction was also seen for fluvastatin. The gap junction blockers carbenoxolone and flufenamic acid also interacted with the same peptide providing insight into potential site of binding. These findings raise key questions about the functional significance of GJC3 transcripts in the vasculature and other tissues, and this connexin's role in therapeutic and adverse effects of statins in a range of disease states.",

A weak but significant positive correlation between plasma silicon and simvastatin levels (r = 0.3, p < 0.05) was observed; this may be due to the fact that simvastatin contains silicon dioxide as an inactive ingredient. The mean simvastatin concentration was 9.02 ng/ml. All hypotheses were verified at the significance level of p < 0.05. A statistically significant decrease in the plasma calcium concentration of postmenopausal women, treated with simvastatin suggests that simvastatin may play a role in calcium metabolism in postmenopausal women with osteoarthritis.

The independent variables were the initial burst of ATR after 2 (Y1) and 24 hours (Y2). The optimized formulation was investigated using scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and in vitro drug release in phosphate-buffered saline of pH 7.4 for 72 hours. The in vivo pharmacokinetic study of the optimized ATR-ISG and the corresponding PEG-free ATR-ISG were conducted by intramuscular injection of a single dose (2 mg/kg) of ATR in male New Zealand White rabbits. A double-blind, randomized, parallel design was used in comparison with those of the marketed ATR tablet. Statistical analysis revealed that PLGA concentration and the molecular weight of PEG have pronounced effects on both Y1 and Y2. The optimized formulation was composed of 36.10% PLGA, PEG 6000, and 15.69% PEG, and exhibited characteristic in vitro release pattern with minimal initial burst. Incorporation of PEG in the formulation causes a slight decrease in the glass transition temperature value of PLGA, leading to a slight change in Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectrum due to possible interaction. Moreover, scanning electron microscopy photomicrograph showed smooth surface with disappearance of the cracks which characterize the surface of PEG-free formulation.

The optimized ATR-ISG formulation has shown minimal initial drug burst which confirms the suitability of the ISG system in the prolongation of drug release in patients with chronic long-term therapy.", 
    "146": "Mutations to fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) and phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) signalling pathway components (for example, PTEN loss, PIK3CA, AKT1, TSC1/2) are common in bladder cancer, yet small-molecule inhibitors of these nodes (FGFR/PTENi) show only modest activity in preclinical models. As activation of autophagy is proposed to promote survival under FGFR/PTENi, we have investigated this relationship in a panel of 18 genetically diverse bladder cell lines. We found that autophagy inhibition does not sensitise bladder cell lines to FGFR/PTENi, but newly identify an autophagy-independent cell death synergy in FGFR3-mutant cell lines between mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway inhibitors and chloroquine (CQ)-an anti-malarial drug used as a cancer therapy adjuvant in over 30 clinical trials. The mechanism of synergy is consistent with lysosomal cell death (LCD), including cathepsin-driven caspase activation, and correlates with suppression of cSREBP1 and cholesterol biosynthesis in sensitive cell lines. Remarkably, loss of viability can be rescued by saturating cellular membranes with cholesterol or recapitulated by statin-mediated inhibition, or small interfering RNA knockdown, of enzymes regulating cholesterol metabolism. Modulation of CQ-induced cell death by atorvastatin and cholesterol is reproduced across numerous cell lines, confirming a novel and fundamental role for cholesterol biosynthesis in regulating LCD. Thus, we have catalogued the molecular events underlying cell death induced by CQ in combination with an anticancer therapeutic. Moreover, by revealing a hitherto unknown aspect of lysosomal biology under stress, we propose that suppression of cholesterol metabolism in cancer cells should elicit synergy with CQ and define a novel approach to future cancer treatments.",

This study investigated whether succinobucol (SUC) could mitigate nigrostriatal injury caused by intranasal 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) administration in mice. Moreover, the effects of SUC against MPTP-induced behavioral impairments and neurochemical changes were also evaluated. The quantification of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH(+)) cells was also performed in primary mesencephalic cultures to evaluate the effects of SUC against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)) toxicity in vitro. C57BL/6 mice were treated with SUC (10\u00a0mg/kg/day, intragastric (i.g.)) for 30\u00a0days, and thereafter, animals received MPTP infusion (1\u00a0mg/nostril) and SUC treatment continued for additional 15\u00a0days. MPTP-infused animals displayed significant non-motor symptoms including olfactory and short-term memory deficits evaluated in the olfactory discrimination, social recognition, and water maze tasks. These behavioral impairments were accompanied by inhibition of mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase activity (complex I), as well as significant decrease of TH and dopamine transporter (DAT) immunoreactivity in the substantia nigra pars compacta and striatum. Although SUC treatment did not rescue NADH dehydrogenase activity inhibition, it was able to blunt MPTP-induced behavioral impairments and prevented the decrease in TH and DAT immunoreactivities in substantia nigra (SN) and striatum. SUC also suppressed striatal astroglial activation and increased interleukin-6 levels in MPTP-intoxicated mice. Furthermore, SUC significantly prevented the loss of TH(+) neurons induced by MPP(+) in primary mesencephalic cultures. These results provide new evidence that SUC treatment counteracts early non-motor symptoms and neurodegeneration/neuroinflammation in the nigrostriatal pathway induced by intranasal MPTP administration in mice by modulating events downstream to the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase inhibition.",

The aim of this study was to develop a local delivery device, PLGA-lovastatin-chitosan-tetracycline nanoparticles, which allows the sequential release of tetracycline and lovastatin to effectively control local infection and promote bone regeneration in periodontitis. The size and microstructure of nanoparticles were examined by transmission electron microscopy, Nanoparticle Size Analyzer, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The release of tetracycline and lovastatin was quantified using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. Furthermore, the cytotoxic effect and alkaline phosphatase activity of the nanoparticles in osteoblast cell cultures as well as antibacterial activity against periodontal pathogens were investigated. Finally, the bone regeneration potential of PLGA nanoparticles in three-walled defects in beagle dogs was investigated. The results indicated that PLGA-lovastatin-chitosan-tetracycline nanoparticles showed good biocompatibility, antibacterial activity, and increased alkaline phosphatase activity.

Methods and results SSc was induced in BALB/c mice by daily subcutaneous injections of hypochlorous acid (HOCl, 100\u2009\u03bcl) for 6 weeks. Mice (n\u2009=\u200923) were randomized to receive: HOCl (n\u2009=\u200910); HOCl plus simvastatin (40\u2009mg/kg; n\u2009=\u20098); or vehicle (n\u2009=\u20095). Simvastatin administration started 30\u2009min after HOCl injection, and up to week 6. Aortic and small renal arteries intima-media thickness was evaluated by histological analysis. Immunostaining for \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (SMA), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), and CD31 in aortic tissues was performed to evaluate myofibroblast differentiation and endothelial markers.In HOCl-treated mice, intima-media thickening with reduced lumen diameter was observed in the aorta and in small renal arteries and simvastatin administration prevented this increase. Aortic and renal myofibroblasts count, as expressed by \u03b1-SMA\u2009+\u2009density, was lower in the group of mice treated with simvastatin compared to HOCl-treated mice. Simvastatin prevented the reduction in VEGFR2 and CD31 expression induced by HOCl.

The increased Iba-1 positive cells and inflammatory components in the hippocampus were reduced after the ATV treatment. The anti-inflammatory and LTP protection of ATV were abolished using the replenishment of farnesyl pyrophosphate by the administration of farnesol (FOH). The hippocampal slices culture showed A\u03b2(25-35)-induced neurotoxicity in the absence of the presence of ATV. Treatment with ATV (0.5, 1, 2.5 \u03bcmol/L) dose-dependently prevented the cell damage in hippocampus induced by A\u03b225-35.",

The immunopositive cells were determined using an indirect immunofluorescence technique with using a monoclonal rat antibody. It has been established that development of colitis was accompanied by an increase of total number of ATG16L1-lymphocytes (by 30%, P < 0.05) in lymphoid structures of the colon. However the amount of AhR(+)-lymphocytes has not changed. At the same time has increased the concentration of ATG16L1 protein (by 4-11%, P < 0.05) in immunopositive cells. Administration of simvastatin and ARIL-1 during the development of experimental pathology was accompanied by decrease of total number of AhR(+) (by 24-38%, P < 0.05) and ATG16L1(+)-lymphocytes (by 43% - 2 fold, P < 0.05) in the colon.", 
    "189": "Statins are recognized as a potential candidate to induce the regeneration of bone. However, statins are a strongly hydrophobic drug and it is difficult to administer at the local sites. In this study, the inclusion complexes of simvastatin (SV) with hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD) and randomly methylated \u03b2-cyclodextrin (RM-\u03b2-CD) were prepared to improve the water-solubility and the osteogenic differentiation ability of the inclusion complexes in MC3T3-E1 cells was investigated. The water-solubility of SV increased linearly upon the addition of both HP-\u03b2-CD and RM-\u03b2-CD, due to the formation of inclusion complexes. The osteogenic differentiation ability of the inclusion complexes were evaluated by the production of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and late stage osteogenetic gene expression in MC3T3-E1 cells after 14 days of culture. As a result, the RM-\u03b2-CD/SV inclusion complexes showed significantly higher ALP production and the expression of bone sialoprotein (BSP) and osteocalcin (OCN) than the untreated and free SV-treated cells. Additionally, the production of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) from MC3T3-E1 cells after the treatment with RM-\u03b2-CD/SV inclusion complexes was significantly higher than the untreated and free SV-treated cells. Accordingly, it is concluded that the inclusion complexation of SV with RM-\u03b2-CD is a potential formulation for bone regenerative therapy to improve water-solubility and osteodifferentiation efficiency.",

It shows a pleiotropic effect on airway smooth muscles and inhibits proliferative activities of physiological mitogens. The aim of the present study was to develop and investigate the targeting potential of rosuvastatin (RSVS) to lung as loaded in nanostructured lipid carrier dry powder for inhalation (RNLC-DPI). RNLC dispersion was converted into respirable particle by lyophilization using 5% mannitol as cryoprotectant-carrier. Targeting efficiency of RNLC-DPI was evaluated in vitro for aerosol performance using 8-stage cascade impactor as well in vivo in Wistar rats for pulmokinetics. In vitro aerosol performance demonstrated mass median aerodynamic diameter of <3 \u03bcm with fine particle fraction of >90% at 60 L/min. Improved aerosol performance was observed for RNLC-DPI prepared using l-leucin as anti-static agent. Modified in vivo performance with higher Cmax (1.14-fold), improvement in t1/2 (5-fold) and 35-fold improvement in AUC0-\u221e indicated significant improvement in bioavailability of RNLC-DPI. Lipidic nature and smaller size of particles helped in bypassing macrophage clearance leading to higher targeting factor. Thus, study demonstrated potential of RNLC-DPI for lung targeting and further for COPD treatment.", 
    "191": "Genetic disorders resulting in hypercholesterolemia comprise autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (ADH), as well as other rare conditions such as autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia. All of these disorders cause profound elevations in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and, as a result, greatly increased risk of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD). Genetic loci involved in ADH include LDLR (which codes for the LDL receptor, whose dysfunction causes Familial Hypercholesterolemia, or FH), APOB (which codes for apoB-100, the major protein component of LDL), and PCSK9 (which codes for PCSK9, the circulatory protein that terminates the lifecycle of the LDLR). Importantly, a large percentage of people with a severe hypercholesterolemic phenotype do not possess a readily identifiable gene defect. Thus, identification of a specific genetic substrate is not a necessary condition for the diagnosis of a genetic hypercholesterolemia. Several formal diagnostic criteria exist for familial hypercholesterolemia; they involve lipid levels, family history, personal history, physical exam findings, and genetic testing. As all individuals with severe hypercholesterolemia are at high risk for CVD, treatment is centered on dietary and lifestyle modifications and early institution of lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy. Treatment should initially be statin-based, but most patients require adjunctive medications such as ezetimibe, niacin, and fibrates. Few patients with extreme and unresponsive elevations in LDL will need invasive therapies such as lipoprotein apheresis. Novel agents for the treatment of severe hypercholesterolemia include microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) inhibitors, apoB-100 antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), and monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9. The FDA has just approved two PCSK9 inhibitors, alirocumab and evolocumab, for use in addition to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy in adult patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or those with clinical CAD who require additional LDL-C lowering.

    "196": "Isolated human hepatocytes are commonly used to predict transporter-mediated clearance in vivo. Such predictions, however, do not provide estimations of transporter contributions and consequently do not allow predictions of the outcome resulting from a change in the activity of a certain transporter, for example, by inhibition or a genetic variant with reduced function. Pitavastatin is a drug that is heavily dependent on hepatic transporters for its elimination, and it is excreted mainly as unchanged drug in the bile. For this reason, pitavastatin was used as a model drug to demonstrate the applicability of a bottom-up approach to predict transporter-mediated disposition in sandwich-cultured human hepatocytes (SCHHs), allowing for the estimation of transporter contributions. Transport experiments in transfected human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293 cell lines) and inverted membrane vesicles overexpressing each of the relevant transport proteins were used to generate parameter estimates for the mechanistic model. By adjusting for differences in transporter abundance between the in vitro systems and individual SCHH batches, the model successfully predicted time profiles of medium and intracellular accumulation. Our predictions of pitavastatin bile accumulation could not be confirmed, however, because of a very low biliary excretion of pitavastatin in relation to the hepatic uptake in our SCHHs. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to successfully simulate transporter-mediated processes in a complex system such as SCHHs at the level of individual transport proteins using a bottom-up approach.", 
    "197": "Several recent reports from large clinical trials have described the role of postprandial hyperlipidemia in the onset of atherosclerosis. In this pilot study, the effects of postprandial lipid abnormalities induced by high-fat diet loading on vascular endothelial function in type 2 diabetes were investigated and the effects of ezetimibe and statins on endothelial function were compared. In 20 patients in Study 1, peripheral arterial tonometry tests were performed before and 4h after loading to measure the reactive hyperemia index (RHI). In Study 2, the same patients were randomly allocated to ezetimibe or rosuvastatin. After 1 week of treatment, loading tests were conducted in the same manner. In Study 1, the RHI decreased from 1.86 to 1.60. There were no significant correlations between changes in RHI and the area under the curve (AUC) or coefficient of variation (CV) of each metabolic marker. In Study 2, ezetimibe treatment resulted in a significant improvement in RHI. The two drugs had comparable effects on changes in AUC. There were no significant correlations between changes in RHI and changes in AUC or changes in CV. When age, sex, drug, hemoglobin A1c, and changes in each lipid were evaluated as independent variables with RHI improvement as the dependent variable, drug differences were found to exert the greatest effect on RHI improvement using a stepwise procedure. The results of this study suggest that the progression of atherosclerosis is due to abnormalities in postprandial lipid metabolism and that ezetimibe can potentially inhibit the aggravation of vascular endothelial dysfunction after high-fat diet loading.", 
    "198": "Clinical studies have shown that hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with bone fragility. Homocysteine (Hcy) induces apoptosis of osteoblastic cell lineage by increasing oxidative stress, which may contribute to Hcy-induced bone fragility. Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, ameliorate oxidative stress by regulating oxidant and anti-oxidant enzymes. However, the effects of statins on Hcy-induced apoptosis of osteocytes are unknown. This study was thus aimed to investigate whether or not statins prevent Hcy-induced apoptosis of osteocytic MLO-Y4 cells and regulate NADPH oxidase (Nox) expression. TUNEL staining showed that 5 mM Hcy induced apoptosis of MLO-Y4 cells, and that co-incubation of 10(-9) or 10(-8) M simvastatin significantly suppressed the apoptotic effect. Moreover, we confirmed the beneficial effect of simvastatin against Hcy's apoptotic effect by using a DNA fragment ELISA assay. However, TUNEL staining showed no significant effects of pravastatin, a hydrophilic statin, on the Hcy-induced apoptosis. Real-time PCR showed that Hcy increased the mRNA expressions of Nox1 and Nox2, whereas simvastatin inhibited the stimulation of Nox1 and Nox2 expressions by Hcy. In contrast, neither Hcy nor simvastatin had any effect on Nox4 expression. These findings indicate that simvastatin prevents the detrimental effects of Hcy on the apoptosis of osteocytes by regulating the expressions of Nox1 and Nox2, suggesting that statins may be beneficial for preventing Hcy-induced osteocyte apoptosis and the resulting bone fragility.", 
    "199": "The Russian cardiologic R&D production complex of Minzdrav of Russia, 121552 Moscow, Russia The statins are synthetic xenobiotics alien to animal cells. They are unlikely capable to manifest pleiotropic effect. It is feasible to evaluate effect of statins by stages: a) initially a specific inhibition of synthesis of cholesterol alcohol; b) further indirect activation of hydrolysis of triglycerides in lipoproteins of very low density; c) nonspecific activation of cells' receptor absorption of palmitic and oleic lipoproteins of very low density and then d) linoleic and linolenic lipoproteins of low density with all polyenoic fatty acids. On balance, statins activate absorption ofpolyenoic fatty acids by cells. Just they manifest physiological, specific pleiotropic effect. The statins inhibit synthesis of pool of cholesterol alcohol-lipoproteins of very low density condensed between phosphatidylcholines in polar mono-layer phosphatidylcholines+cholesterol alcohol on surface oftriglycerides. The low permeability of mono-layer separates substrate-triglycerides in lipoproteins of very low density and post-heparin lipoprotein lipase in hydrophilic blood plasma. The higher is ratio cholesterol alcohol/phosphatidylcholines in mono-layer of lipoproteins of very low density the slower is lipolysis, formation of ligand lipoproteins of very low density and their absorption by cells under apoB-100-endocytosis. The statins normalize hyperlipemia by force of a) activation of absorption oflipoproteins of very low density by insulin-depended cells and b) activation of absorption of lipoproteins of low density by all cells, increasing of bio-availability of polyenoic fatty acids, activation of apoB-100-endocytosis. The limitation in food of content of palmitic saturated fatty acid and increasing of content of \u03c9-3 polyenoic fatty acids improve \"bio-availability\" of polyenoic fatty acids and their absorption by cells and also decreases cholesterol alcohol/phosphatidylcholines and biological pleiotropic effect of essential polyenoic fatty acids. According our opinion, atherosclerosis is intracellular deficiency of polyenoic fatty acids. The value of cholesterol alcohol-lipoproteins of low density is equimolar to content of lipoproteins of low density in blood which under low bio-availability can't to absorb cells byforce of apoB-100-endocytosis.", 
    "200": "We investigated a polyethylene glycol non-precipitable low-density lipoprotein (LDL) subfraction targeted by IgG and the influence of statin therapy on plasma levels of these small LDL-IgG-immune complexes (LDL-IgG-IC). LDL-subfractions were isolated from 6 atherosclerotic subjects and 3 healthy individuals utilizing iodixanol density gradient ultracentrifugation. Cholesterol, apoB and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were determined in each fraction by enzymatic testing, dissociation-enhanced lanthanide fluorescence immunoassay and high-performance liquid chromatography, respectively. The levels of LDL-IgG-IC were quantified densitometrically following lipid electrophoresis, particle size distribution was assessed with dynamic light scattering and size exclusion chromatography. The influence of simvastatin (40 mg/day for three months) on small LDL-IgG-IC levels and their distribution among LDL-subfractions (salt gradient separation) were investigated in 11 patients with confirmed coronary artery disease (CAD). We demonstrate that the investigated LDL-IgG-IC are small particles present in atherosclerotic patients and healthy subjects. In vitro assembly of LDL-IgG-IC resulted in particle density shifts indicating a composition of one single molecule of IgG per LDL particle. Normalization on cholesterol levels revealed MDA values twice as high for LDL-subfractions rich in small LDL-IgG-IC if compared to dominant LDL-subfractions. Reactivity of affinity purified small LDL-IgG-IC to monoclonal antibody OB/04 indicates a high degree of modified apoB and oxidative modification. Simvastatin therapy studied in the CAD patients significantly lowered LDL levels and to an even higher extent, small LDL-IgG-IC levels without affecting their distribution. In conclusion simvastatin lowers levels of small LDL-IgG-IC more effectively than LDL-cholesterol and LDL-apoB levels in atherosclerotic patients. This antiatherogenic effect may additionally contribute to the known beneficial effects of this drug in the treatment of atherosclerosis.",

We stratified our analyses by statin use status and found that subjects in the upper fibrinogen tertiles had higher levels of atherogenic lipid parameters irrespective of statin status (p<0.001, all). Significantly, we observed a synergistic effect of fibrinogen and concurrent elevated lipid index for high GS. The adjusted odds ratios were greater in participants who had high fibrinogen levels and also high lipid index compared to those with low lipid index [on statin: 1.725(1.258-2.364) vs. 1.261(0.962-1.652); not on statin: 2.197(1.450-3.328) vs. 1.166(0.417-3.258)].

In patients who have had a stroke or other clinical ASCVD event, a high-intensity statin should be initiated up to age 75\u00a0years unless there are safety concerns, including a history of hemorrhagic stroke. A moderate-intensity statin is recommended if there are safety concerns or age is greater than 75\u00a0years. Atorvastatin 40-80\u00a0mg and rosuvastatin 20-40\u00a0mg are considered high-intensity statins. These new guidelines avoid unnecessary usage of non-statins to achieve specific LDL-C values, thus avoiding potential adverse effects or use of an inadequate statin intensity in patients who are \"at goal.\" When non-statins are considered for additional LDL-C lowering, ezetimibe is the only non-statin clearly shown to further reduce ASCVD risk when added to background statin therapy.", 
    "210": "It was reported that 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), a commonly used herbicide and a possible endocrine disruptor, can disturb spermatogenesis, but the precise mechanism is not understood. Since 2,4-D is a weak peroxisome proliferator in hepatocytes and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1) is also expressed in Leydig cells, this study aimed to investigate the link between PPAR\u03b1 and 2,4-D-mediated testicular dysfunction. 2,4-D (130\u00a0mg/kg/day) was administered to wild-type and Ppara-null mice for 2\u00a0weeks, and the alterations in testis and testosterone/cholesterol metabolism in Leydig cells were examined. Treatment with 2,4-D markedly decreased testicular testosterone in wild-type mice, leading to degeneration of spermatocytes and Sertoli cells. The 2,4-D decreased cholesterol levels in Leydig cells of wild-type mice through down-regulating the expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase 1 and reductase, involved in de novo cholesterogenesis. However, the mRNAs encoding the important proteins involved in testosterone synthesis were unchanged by 2,4-D except for CYP17A1, indicating that exhausted cholesterol levels in the cells is a main reason for reduced testicular testosterone. Additionally, pregnancy rate and the number of pups between 2,4-D-treated wild-type male mice and untreated female mice were significantly lower compared with those between untreated couples. These phenomena were not observed in 2,4-D-treated Ppara-null males. Collectively, these results suggest a critical role for PPAR\u03b1 in 2,4-D-induced testicular toxicity due to disruption of cholesterol/testosterone homeostasis in Leydig cells. This study yields novel insights into the possible mechanism of testicular dysfunction and male infertility caused by 2,4-D.",
