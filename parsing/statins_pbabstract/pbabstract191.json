    "18": "OBJECTIVE An association of the C-857T polymorphism of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) gene promoter region with LDL cholesterol levels has been reported. This study was designed to evaluate the relationship between the TNF-alpha-C-857T polymorphism and LDL cholesterol levels according to statin treatment in subjects with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS DNA was obtained from 322 Japanese subjects (160 male and 162 female) with type 2 diabetes, and TNF-alpha-C-857T polymorphisms were determined by direct sequencing. Serum LDL cholesterol was measured by a direct method. RESULTS Although serum LDL cholesterol levels were significantly higher in the T carriers (C/T + T/T) than in the non-T carriers (C/C) (3.14 +/- 0.86 vs. 2.89 +/- 0.75 mmol/l, P < 0.05), there was no difference in LDL cholesterol levels between the non-T carriers and the T carriers in statin-untreated subjects (2.87 +/- 0.73 vs. 2.89 +/- 0.76 mmol/l, NS), whereas in statin-treated subjects, LDL cholesterol levels were significantly higher in the T carriers than in the non-T carriers (3.43 +/- 0.89 vs. 2.90 +/- 0.78 mmol/l, P = 0.0007). There were no differences in HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels between the non-T carriers and the T carriers in both statin-treated and -untreated subjects. The percent decrease in LDL cholesterol levels after administration of statins was significantly smaller in the T carriers compared with the non-T carriers (27.6 vs. 36.4%, P = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS The mutant allele of the C-857T promoter polymorphism of the TNF-alpha gene may predispose to resistance to the LDL cholesterol-lowering effect of statins and could be one of the markers used to predict the efficacy of statins.", 
    "19": "The growing population of elderly with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is at greater risk for cardiovascular disease given an independent risk of CKD, as well as from added dyslipidemia of aging and renal dysfunction. Changes in lipid metabolism with more isodense and high-dense, triglyceride-rich particles, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and increased triglyceride levels occur with CKD and aging, which are noted to have significant atherogenic potential. In addition, lipid abnormalities may lead to the progression of CKD. Cardiovascular mortality in the end-stage renal disease population is more than 10 times higher than the general population. Treatment of dyslipidemia in the general population suggests important benefits both in reducing cardiovascular risk and in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Secondary analyses of elderly subgroups of various large prospective studies with statins suggest treatment benefit with statin use in the elderly. Similarly limited data from secondary analyses of CKD subgroups of larger prospective trials using statins also suggest a possible benefit in cardiovascular outcomes and the progression of kidney disease. However, randomized trials have yet to confirm similar benefits and targets of treatment for dyslipidemia in the elderly with CKD and end-stage renal disease. Treatment in the elderly with CKD should be individualized and outweigh risks of side effects and drug-drug interactions. There is a need for further specific investigation of dyslipidemia of CKD in the aging population in relation to renal disease progression and cardiovascular outcome.",

Postmenopausal women (76 with normal glucose metabolism [NGM], 41 with type 2 diabetes mellitus [T2DM], and 38 T2DM women with statin therapy [T2DM-ST]) received 2 consecutive fat-rich or carbohydrate-rich meals on separate occasions. Linear regression analysis was performed to assess the associations of fasting CETP and postprandial changes of CETP with postprandial changes in HDL-c. Mean plasma HDL-c concentrations decreased significantly after the fat-rich meals: 0.18 +/- 0.09 mmol/L in NGM, 0.16 +/- 0.09 mmol/L in T2DM, and 0.14 +/- 0.08 mmol/L in T2DM-ST women. This effect was smaller after using carbohydrate-rich meals: 0.12 +/- 0.09 mmol/L in the NGM, 0.12 +/- 0.08 mmol/L in the T2DM, and 0.10 +/- 0.05 mmol/L in the T2DM-ST study group. Higher fasting but not postprandial CETP concentrations were associated with a larger postprandial decrease in HDL-c (beta -0.034; 95% confidence interval, -0.067 to -0.001) after the fat-rich meals. This association was independent of the postprandial increase in triglycerides and similar among the 3 study groups.

Apoptosis and related proteins, including P53, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), cytochrome C, and cleaved caspase-3, were also activated. Simvastatin, at both low dose (10 mg/kg) and high dose (40 mg/kg), further increased expression of phospho-Akt and phospho-GSK3beta, decreased activation of caspase-3, and inhibited apoptosis. Preserved blood-brain barrier and attenuated brain edema were observed following simvastatin treatment. In addition, the neuroprotective effects of simvastatin were blocked by wortmannin (2.5 microg/kg/min), an irreversible PIK3 inhibitor.

In this study, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was exploited as a model system to gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms of atorvastatin toxicity. Atorvastatin-treated yeast cells display marked morphological deformities, have reduced cell viability and are highly vulnerable to perturbed mitochondrial function. Supplementation assays of atorvastatin-treated cells reveal that both loss of viability and mitochondrial dysfunction occur as a consequence of perturbation of the sterol synthesis pathway. This was further investigated by supplementing statin-treated cells with various metabolites of the sterol synthesis pathway that are believed to be essential for cell function. Ergosterol, coenzyme Q and a heme precursor were all ineffective in the prevention of statin-induced mitochondrial disruption and cell death. However, the addition of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate significantly restored cell viability, although these did not overcome petite induction. This highlights the pleiotropic nature of statin toxicity, but has established protein prenylation disruption as one of the principal mechanisms underlying statin-induced cell death in yeast.",

It is now well recognised that, in many critically ill patients, the opposite is true, with hypocholesterolaemia being associated with poor outcomes. In critical illness, particularly sepsis, total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels are commonly decreased, with varying changes in triglyceride levels. The magnitude of the changes seems to reflect the severity of inflammation. Plausible biological explanations exist to explain these associations, including an interaction of lipoproteins with endotoxin and the regulation of cytokine production. It remains unclear whether these observed alterations in lipid profile are a consequence of the physiological disturbance or whether they have a more causative role, worsening organ dysfunction or predisposing to infection. Lipid emulsions provide a vehicle for drug delivery, have become an important part of nutrition, and are emerging as a therapy for specific intoxications. The nature, dietary source and amount of lipid provided to critically ill patients may be enormously important and warrant more rigorous investigation.

An important finding was that when LDL-C level exceed 4.0 mmol/L (154mg/dL) and when willingness to pay is less than 500 EUR per additional PTT, the optimal treatment strategy would be to initiate cholesterol-lowering treatment directly with rosuvastatin 10 mg.", 
    "65": "The results of this study indicate that the optimal approach to initiate lipid-lowering therapy would be to treat patients with the lower baseline LDL-C levels with the least costly treatment strategies, while initiating lipid-lowering treatment with a high-potency statin (rosuvastatin) in patients with moderately high or high baseline LDL-C levels. This recommendation can be assumed to be relevant particularly when the fact that after treatment initiation the majority of Swedish patients will not have any changes in their lipid-lowering medication or dose is taken into account. Finally, since only the short-term results are presented here, it would be valuable to conduct further studies of the long-term cost-effectiveness of different statin treatment strategies that focus on treatment persistence and LDL-C goal attainment in real practice.",

Pitavastatin and its lactone form are minimally metabolized by CYP enzymes, and are therefore associated with minimal drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Pitavastatin 2 to 4 mg has potent LDL-C-reducing activity, equivalent to that of atorvastatin 10 to 20 mg; several clinical trials have revealed consistently superior high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) elevating activity of pitavastatin than that of atorvastatin. Pitavastatin-induced HDL-C elevation has been shown to be sustained, even incremental, in long-term clinical trials. Pitavastatin was as well-tolerated as atorvastatin or simvastatin in double-blind randomized clinical trials. Two-year long-term safety and effectiveness of pitavastain has been confirmed in a large-scale, prospective post-marketing surveillance. The safety and efficacy profile of pitavastatin is favorable for the treatment of dyslipidemia, especially in metabolic syndrome patients. In addition to control of LDL-C, adequate control of triglyceride (TG) and HDL-C, hypertension and hyperglycemia is also necessary in metabolic syndrome patients.

However, their cholesterol-independent effects include regulation of Rho/Rho-kinases (ROCK) and eNOS, proteins centrally involved in various models of acute inflammation. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that simvastatin confers protection after rat hemorrhage/resuscitation (H/R) and wanted to elucidate the mechanisms involved. Fifty-two female Lewis rats (180-250 g) were pretreated with simvastatin 5 mg/kg per day or vehicle for 6 days (i.p.). Then, rats were hemorrhaged to a mean arterial pressure of 30 +/- 2 mmHg for 60 min and resuscitated. Control group underwent surgical procedures without H/R. Two hours after resuscitation, tissues were harvested. Mortality was assessed 72 h after H/R. Simvastatin pretreatment increased survival after H/R from 20% to 80%. Serum alanine aminotransferase after H/R increased 2.2-fold in vehicle as compared with simvastatin-treated rats. Histopathological analysis revealed decreased hepatic necrosis in simvastatin-treated rats after H/R. Hepatic oxidative (4-hydroxynonenal) and nitrosative (3-nitrotyrosine) stress, inflammatory markers (serum IL-6 and hepatic infiltration with polymorphonuclear leukocytes), and actin cytoskeleton rearrangements were decreased after simvastatin pretreatment compared with vehicle-treated rats after H/R. Simvastatin increased eNOS and heme oxygenase 1 expression and eNOS activation. Expression of Rho/Rho-kinase and myosin phosphatase targeting subunit, Thr-MYPT1, a marker for Rho-kinase activity, decreased after simvastatin treatment compared with vehicle-treated rats after H/R. Simvastatin pretreatment exerts beneficial effects in this model of acute inflammation by supporting protective mechanisms that are important for hepatic microcirculation after H/R.",

The prevalence of heart disease has been linked to the adoption of a sedentary lifestyle and the increased dietary dependence on saturated fats from animal sources and the intake of refined foods. Elevated blood cholesterol level is one of the major risk factors for CHD. While cholesterol-lowering drug therapy (statins) has been effective in reducing the risk of heart disease, there are those individuals who are unwilling or because of muscle pains or raised levels of liver or muscle enzymes are unable to take cholesterol-lowering medication. Fortunately, there is evidence linking a number of dietary components to CHD risk reduction. The strength of this evidence has prompted various regulatory bodies to advocate diet as the first line of defence for primary prevention of heart disease. It was therefore decided to combine four dietary components that have been shown to lower blood cholesterol concentrations (nuts, plant sterols, viscous fibre and vegetable protein) in a dietary portfolio in order to determine whether the combined effect is additive. In a metabolically-controlled setting this dietary portfolio has proved to be as effective as a starting dose of a first-generation statin cholesterol-lowering medication in reducing the risk of CHD. The dietary portfolio has also been shown to be effective in sustaining a clinically-significant effect in the long term under a 'real-world' scenario. However, success of the diet depends on compliance and despite the accessibility of the foods adherence has been found to vary greatly. Overall, the evidence supports the beneficial role of the dietary portfolio in reducing blood cholesterol levels and CHD risk.",

In this study, the mokH gene was cloned and driven by the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gpd) promoter for overexpression in M. pilosus. The transformants containing an extra copy of the mokH gene were obtained and verified by PCR and Southern hybridization. The transcripts of mokH in the transformants were expressed significantly higher than those of the wild-type strain. The transformants were stably inherited through the next generation, as determined by observation of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). The transformant T-mokH1 also showed a 1.7-fold higher production of monacolin K than the wild-type strain in a time course analysis. Analysis of the RT-PCR products demonstrated that the monacolin K biosynthetic genes in the transformant were expressed to a greater extent than those in the wild-type strain.

Patients with COPD had lower clot permeability (6.1+/- 1.07 versus 9.2 +/- 0.9 10(-9) cm(2), p < 0.0001), decreased compaction (44.9 +/- 4.5 versus 63.9 +/- 6.1%, p < 0.0001), higher maximum D-dimer levels released from clots (4.23 +/- 0.55 versus 3.53 +/- 0.31 mg/l, p < 0.0001) with a decreased rate of this release (75.0 +/- 8.3 versus 80.9 +/- 8.0 microg/l/min, p = 0.03) and prolonged lysis time (9.84 +/- 1.33 versus 8.02 +/- 0.84 min, p < 0.0001) compared with controls. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed denser clot structure in COPD. Multiple linear regression analysis after adjustment for age and fibrinogen showed that in the COPD patients, CRP was the only independent predictor of permeability (R(2) = 0.47, p < 0.001) and lysis time (R(2) = 0.43, p < 0.001). Simvastatin improved clot properties (p < 0.05) despite unaltered CRP and irrespective of cholesterol reduction. Our study shows that fibrin clots in COPD patients are composed of much denser networks that are more resistant to lysis, and these properties can be improved by statin administration.", 
    "120": "Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is essential for electron transport within the mitochondria and hence for ATP generation and cellular energy production. We recently demonstrated that plasma levels of CoQ10 are an independent predictor of survival in a cohort of 236 patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) followed for a median of 2.69 years. This is consistent with previous studies which have shown myocardial CoQ10 depletion in CHF, and correlated with the severity of the underlying disorder. Several intervention studies have been undertaken with CoQ10 in CHF, including randomized controlled trials with mostly positive outcomes in relation to improvement in plasma levels of CoQ10. A meta-analysis showed that CoQ10 resulted in an improvement in ejection fraction of 3.7% (95%CI 1.59-5.77) and the mean increase in cardiac output was 0.28 L/minute (95%CI 0.03-0.53). In a subgroup analysis, studies with patients not taking ACE inhibitors found a 6.7% increase in ejection fraction. The ongoing Q-SYMBIO trial will address whether CoQ10 supplementation improves survival in CHF patients. CoQ10 depletion may also be a contributory factor for why statin intervention has not improved outcomes in CHF. There is an emerging evidence base in support of CoQ10 as an adjunctive therapy in CHF.",

NADPH oxidase is among the most important sources of reactive oxygen species involved in atherosclerotic disease. Methods/Results- We developed an ELISA to evaluate serum levels of soluble-gp91(phox), the catalytic core of phagocyte NADPH oxidase. In a cross-sectional study performed in 30 hypercholesterolemic patients and in 20 controls, serum soluble-gp91(phox) and urinary isoprostane, a marker of oxidative stress, were measured. The 2 variables were also measured in hypercholesterolemic patients, randomized to diet (n=15), or diet plus atorvastatin (10 mg daily, n=15) and followed for 30 days.

Compared with allografts where neither the donor nor recipient was treated with a statin at the time of transplantation (n = 464), statin use by the donor and not the recipient (n = 75) was associated with a decreased risk of grade 3-4 acute GVHD (multivariate hazard ratio, 0.28; 95% confidence interval, 0.1-0.9). Statin use by both donor and recipient (n = 12) was suggestively associated with a decreased risk of grade 3 or 4 acute GVHD (multivariate hazard ratio, 0.00; 95% confidence interval, undefined), whereas statin use by the recipient and not the donor (n = 16) did not confer GVHD protection. Risks of chronic GVHD, recurrent malignancy, nonrelapse mortality, and overall mortality were not significantly affected by donor or recipient statin exposure. Statin-associated GVHD protection was restricted to recipients with cyclosporine-based postgrafting immunosuppression and was not observed among those given tacrolimus (P = .009). These results suggest that donor statin treatment may be a promising strategy to prevent severe acute GVHD without compromising immunologic control of the underlying malignancy.", 
    "131": "Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR)D4 is a member of the StAR related lipid transfer family. Homology comes from the approximately 210 amino acid lipid binding domain implicated in intracellular transport, cell signaling, and lipid metabolism. StARD4 was identified as a gene downregulated 2-fold by dietary cholesterol (Soccio, R. E., R. M. Adams, K. N. Maxwell, and J. L. Breslow. 2005. Differential gene regulation of StarD4 and StarD5 cholesterol transfer proteins. Activation of StarD4 by sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 and StarD5 by endoplasmic reticulum stress. J. Biol. Chem. 280: 19410-19418). A mouse knockout was created to investigate StARD4's functionality and role in lipid metabolism. Homozygous knockout mice exhibited normal Mendelian mating genetics, but weighed less than wild-type littermates, an effect not accounted for by energy metabolism or food intake. Body composition as analyzed by DEXA scan showed no significant difference. No significant alterations in plasma or liver lipid content were observed on a chow diet, but female knockout mice showed a decrease in gallbladder bile cholesterol and phospholipid concentration. When challenged with a 0.2% lova-statin diet, StARD4 homozygous mice exhibited no changes. However, when challenged with a 0.5% cholesterol diet, female StARD4 homozygous mice showed a moderate decrease in total cholesterol, LDL, and cholesterol ester concentrations. Microarray analysis of liver RNA found few changes. However, NPC1's expression, a gene not on the microarray, was decreased approximately 2.5-fold in knockouts. These observations suggest that StARD4's role can largely be compensated for by other intracellular cholesterol transporters.", 
    "132": "The relationship between statin-induced increases in HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration and statin-induced decreases in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) is unknown. The effects of different statins on HDL-C levels, relationships between changes in HDL-C and changes in LDL-C, and predictors of statin-induced increases in HDL-C have been investigated in an individual patient meta-analysis of 32,258 dyslipidemic patients included in 37 randomized studies using rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, and simvastatin. The HDL-C raising ability of rosuvastatin, and simvastatin was comparable, with both being superior to atorvastatin. Increases in HDL-C were positively related to statin dose with rosuvastatin and simvastatin but inversely related to dose with atorvastatin. There was no apparent relationship between reduction in LDL-C and increase in HDL-C, whether analyzed overall for all statins (correlation coefficient = 0.005) or for each statin individually. Percentage increase in apolipoprotein A-I was virtually identical to that of HDL-C at all doses of the three statins. Baseline concentrations of HDL-C and triglyceride (TG) and presence of diabetes were strong, independent predictors of statin-induced elevations of HDL-C. Statins vary in their HDL-C raising ability. The HDL-C increase achieved by all three statins was independent of LDL-C decrease. However, baseline HDL-C and TGs and the presence of diabetes were predictors of statin-induced increases in HDL-C.",

    "137": "Intake of plant sterols has long been shown to reduce cholesterol absorption and subsequently plasma cholesterol concentrations. Despite competition between plant sterols and cholesterol for incorporation into mixed micelles as a suggested major mechanism for the inhibition of cholesterol absorption by plant sterols, studies exist to support an alternative mechanism. For example, another mechanism may be the action of plant sterols to reduce cholesterol absorption at the cellular level. This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that plant sterols can modulate the expression of transporters such as Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) and scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI) to lower intestinal cholesterol absorption. FHs 74 Int cells, a human small intestine epithelial cell line, were used as a model of enterocytes. The cells were treated with 25alpha-hydroxycholesterol (25 micromol/L) or 250 micromol/L of sitosterol, stigmasterol, and cholesterol for 24 hours to measure genes involved in cholesterol absorption and metabolism by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. 25Alpha-hydroxycholesterol, cholesterol, and sitosterol significantly reduced the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of NPC1L1 and hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, whereas SR-BI mRNA was not altered by the sterols. Western blot analysis confirmed the reduction in NPC1L1 by sterols. Depletion of cellular cholesterol by mevinolin, a cholesterol synthesis inhibitor, increased NPC1L1 and HMG-CoA reductase mRNA; and repletion of cholesterol abolished the increase. Sitosterol, but not stigmasterol, reduced the mRNA levels of NPC1L1 and HMG-CoA reductase to a similar extent of cholesterol. In conclusion, sitosterol can inhibit the expression of NPC1L1 in the enterocytes, which could be an alternate mechanism for plant sterols to reduce intestinal cholesterol uptake.",

The goal of this study was to systematically review randomized trials comparing statins to placebo for HF and compare the impact of different statins. CENTRAL, mRCT, and PubMed were searched for eligible studies that prospectively randomized patients with HF to statins or placebo. Primary end points were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization for worsening HF, adverse drug events, and changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Pooling was performed with random effect methods with summary effect estimates (95% confidence intervals). Ten studies (10,192 patients) with follow-up from 3 to 47 months were included. Three trials randomized patients to rosuvastatin, 1 to simvastatin, and 6 to atorvastatin. Overall, statins did not affect all-cause or cardiovascular mortality but did significantly decrease hospitalization for worsening HF during follow-up (odds ratio [OR] 0.67, p = 0.008). Patients randomized to statins had a significant 4.2% increase in LVEF at follow-up (95% confidence interval 1.3 to 7.1, p = 0.004). Furthermore, post hoc analyses showed heterogeneity among different statins and demonstrated that randomization to atorvastatin significantly decreased all-cause mortality (OR 0.39, p = 0.004), decreased hospitalization for worsening HF (OR 0.30, p <0.000 01), and randomization to atorvastatin and simvastatin led to a significant improvement in LVEF, whereas these benefits were not observed in patients randomized to rosuvastatin. In conclusion, meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated that statins are safe and improve LVEF and decrease hospitalization for worsening HF.", 
    "143": "Statin treatment targeting low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is widely used for cardiovascular risk reduction, but many statin users still face greatly elevated risks. Some experts advocate additional therapy that targets high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. However, the size of the patient group that could benefit from HDL cholesterol or triglyceride therapy has not been reported. Using observational data from a large health maintenance organization, 5,158 patients were identified who initiated dyslipidemia pharmacotherapy from July 2004 to June 2006, continued therapy for 1 year, and had full lipid panels within 6 months before and 9 to 15 months after therapy initiation. Therapy (primarily statins) reduced the proportion of patients not at LDL cholesterol goals from 77% to 22% and the proportion with high triglyceride levels from 34% to 20%. HDL cholesterol levels were unchanged (49% and 50% were less than normal levels before and after therapy, respectively) in the aggregate and in high-risk subgroups (patients with coronary artery disease, diabetes, and 10-year heart disease risk >20%). After therapy, 29% of high-risk patients still had multiple lipid abnormalities. In conclusion, current dyslipidemia therapy substantially improved LDL cholesterol goal attainment in this cohort, but low HDL cholesterol levels were unaffected. About half the patients starting statins could be candidates for additional therapy targeting non-LDL cholesterol lipid fractions.", 
    "144": "Inhibition of platelet thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)) by aspirin is critical in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but some patients have persistent platelet TXA(2) production within 48 hours of the onset of AMI. Statins are known to reduce TXA(2) in aspirin-free patients with hypercholesterolemia. We hypothesized that treatment with aspirin plus atorvastatin could reduce persistent TXA(2) synthesis and aspirin resistance in patients with AMI. We evaluated platelet function in 184 aspirin-treated patients within 48 hours of the onset of AMI. Patients were divided into group A (treated with aspirin alone, n = 139) and group B (treated with aspirin plus atorvastatin, n = 45). We studied collagen-induced platelet TXA(2) synthesis, serotonin ((14)C-5HT) release and recruitment, and adenosine diphosphate-, arachidonic acid-, and collagen-induced platelet aggregation. Persistent TXA(2) synthesis was detected in 25% and 9% of groups A and B, respectively (p = 0.03). TXA(2), arachidonic acid-aggregation, and collagen-induced responses were significantly reduced in patients receiving dual treatment compared to those receiving aspirin monotherapy. Atorvastatin did not modify platelet reactivity in patients with efficiently blocked TXA(2) synthesis. These results strongly suggest a direct effect of the statin on platelet eicosanoid synthesis. This was confirmed in vitro by incubating washed aspirin-free and aspirin (1 muM)-treated platelets from normal subjects with 1 to 20 microM atorvastatin. Atorvastatin in vitro significantly reduced platelet TXA(2) synthesis and collagen-induced aggregation. In conclusion, atorvastatin combined with aspirin early in the onset of the acute event significantly reduced persistent TXA(2) and TXA(2)-dependent aspirin resistance. This could contribute to the clinical benefit of atorvastatin in patients with AMI.",

It was hypothesized that previous statin therapy before hospitalization might be associated with reductions of in-hospital arrhythmic events in patients with acute coronary syndromes. In this multinational, prospective, observational study (the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events [GRACE]), data from 64,679 patients hospitalized for suspected acute coronary syndromes (from 1999 to 2007) were analyzed. The primary outcome of interest was in-hospital arrhythmic events in previous statin users compared with nonusers. The 2 primary end points were atrial fibrillation and the composite end point of ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and/or cardiac arrest. In-hospital death was also examined. Of the 64,679 patients, 17,636 (27%) had received previous statin therapy. Those taking statins had higher crude rates of histories of angina (69% vs 46%), diabetes (34% vs 22%), heart failure (15% vs 8.4%), hypertension (74% vs 58%), atrial fibrillation (9.3% vs 7.0%), and dyslipidemia (85% vs 35%). Patients previously taking statins were less likely to have in-hospital arrhythmias. In propensity-adjusted multivariable models, previous statin use was associated with a lower risk for ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or cardiac arrest (odds ratio 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.72 to 0.96, p = 0.002); atrial fibrillation (odds ratio 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.73 to 0.89, p <0.0001); and death (odds ratio 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.70 to 0.95, p = 0.010).

The target LDL cholesterol of <70 mg/dL is based on data extrapolated from RCTs.

Low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol are common among patients with ACS and predict risk for subsequent cardiovascular events, even on a background of intensive statin treatment. An extensive body of clinical and experimental data suggests that HDL cholesterol may promote favorable remodeling of coronary atherosclerotic plaque and ameliorate endothelial dysfunction, thrombotic tendency, inflammation, oxidative stress, and ischemia-reperfusion injury, which are all effects that might be beneficial after ACS. Clinical trials are in progress to test the hypothesis that strategies to raise levels of HDL cholesterol will reduce risk after ACS.",

Decreasing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels with statins has a major impact on cardiovascular risk reduction, and statin therapy plays a significant role in the management of CAD.

Propensity-based matching, which accounted for each individual's likelihood of receiving a statin, yielded a final cohort of 2,240,638 patients, exactly half of whom received statins. Statins were associated with small protective effects against pneumonia hospitalization (odds ratio [OR] 0.92; 95% CI 0.89-0.95), 30-day pneumonia mortality (0.84; 95% CI 0.77-0.91), and all-cause mortality (0.87; 95% CI 0.84-0.89). These protective effects attenuated substantially after multivariate adjustment and when we excluded multiple observations for each individual, declined over time, differed across propensity score quintiles and risk groups, and were unchanged during post-influenza season periods. The main limitations of this study were the observational study design, the non-specific outcomes, and the lack of information on medications while hospitalized.",

They found no evidence of a chemoprotective effect of statin use, a finding that is consistent with previous cohort and interventional studies that have addressed this issue. We conclude that the best-designed studies of the issue indicate that statin use is neither a major risk factor nor a protective factor for CRC and that we have come very near to the end of the road for the hypothesis relating statins to CRC risk.",

We hypothesized that oral simvastatin would improve vestibulomotor function and reduce cognitive dysfunction after experimental SAH in the rat, and explored the effects of simvastatin on vasospasm and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). In total 160 rats were enrolled. Randomization to simvastatin or vehicle occurred after double intracisternal blood injections. Effects of simvastatin 10 mg/kg/d (SV10), simvastatin 1.5 mg/kg/d, or vehicle on rotarod, Morris water maze, neuronal survival, cerebral arterial diameter, and rCBF were determined by a blinded observer (n=15/group). A dose dependent response to simvastatin was observed, with more rapid improvement in vestibulomotor function, less basilar arterial vasospasm, and improved cortical neuronal survival with SV10. However, rotarod performance in the SV10 group deteriorated after 1 week, which correlated with the increased plasma creatine kinase levels (r=-0.737; P=0.0002). Furthermore, when simvastatin was discontinued after 2 weeks, the usual treatment duration in SAH clinical trials, rotarod performance deteriorated acutely, rCBF returned to control values, and no long-term benefit was observed in terms of visual spatial memory. Continuing simvastatin 1.5 mg/kg/d for 5 weeks resulted in sustained improvement in rotarod performance, reduced escape latency (P=0.001), swimming distance (P=0.002), and swimming speed (P=0.03) versus vehicle (n=12/group). Our results indicate that long-term cognitive dysfunction after experimental SAH in the rat can be reduced by simvastatin. However, treatment had to be extended beyond 2 weeks, the traditional risk period for angiographic vasospasm, to improve long-term outcome.",

Stress testing is not predictive of myocardial ischemia/infarction (MI) or death and is only recommended in patients with unstable angina or an active arrhythmia. Stress testing for patients with 0 to 2 risk factors delays VS up to 3 weeks. In high-risk patients (>or=3 risk factors), it helps to identify patients who may develop myocardial ischemia and would benefit from a 30-day period to optimize medical therapy before VS. Stress testing and coronary catheterization do not predict which coronary artery to revascularize to prevent MI or death. Revascularization does not decrease MI or death rates at 1 month or 6 years. Although beta-blocker treatment decreases cardiac risk with VS, timing and dosage (titration) influence outcomes, improper usage may increase stroke and death rate, and not all VS patients should be taking these drugs. Patients with >or=1 risk factor should be considered to begin a low dose beta-blocker 1 month before VS. Preoperative statin use sharply decreases MI, stroke, and death perioperatively and long-term postoperatively.",

Intermediate risk factors may not require aggressive heart rate control but simply maintenance on a low-dose beta-blocker.

However, the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin has not been studied in patients with end-stage kidney disease undergoing chronic peritoneal dialysis (PD). The goals of this study are to determine the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of a single oral dose of rosuvastatin in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD). This was a nonrandomized, open-label, 1-week trial. Ten stable PD patients were given a single oral dose of rosuvastatin (10 mg). Serial blood samples were obtained over the next 48 hours, and the patients were followed for 1 week while they underwent CAPD. Rosuvastatin plasma concentration peaked (Cmax) at 3.68 +/- 2.3 ng/ml (geometric mean), 4.5 hours (median; range 2 - 6 hours) after oral dosing. The plasma concentration of rosuvastatin was 0.44 +/- 0.23 ng/ml at 24 hours (C24) and 0.14 +/- 0.07 ng/ml, with levels below the detectable range in 5 of 10 subjects, at 48 hours (C48). The area under the plasma concentration-time from 0 to 48 hours (AUC0-48) was 32.6 +/- 1.6 ng/ml/h. These pharmacokinetic profiles of rosuvastatin in CAPD patients are very similar to those observed in healthy volunteers, but different from patients with Stages 4 - 5 chronic kidney disease. A single oral dose of rosuvastatin was well tolerated in this small number of patients. We conclude that pharmacokinetic profiles of rosuvastatin in patients undergoing CAPD are similar to those observed in healthy volunteers. These findings suggest that a lower dose of rosuvastatin (<= 10 mg) may be administered in CAPD patients without dose adjustment.",

    "238": "Hypocholesterolemic activity of RYR is mediated at least partially by enhancement of acidic sterol excretion.", 
    "239": "The use of statins in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has increased, and reduced levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lead to lower coronary event rates. We studied the effect of lipid levels during statin treatment on prognosis in patients with ACS and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).", 
    "240": "Between January 2005 and May 2007, 325 ACS patients who underwent PCI and received statins were evaluated. We measured serum lipid levels at baseline and 4 weeks. The relationships between on-treatment levels of triglyceride (TG) and LDL-C and one-year major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were assessed.", 
    "241": "At 4 weeks, the mean LDL-C level was 72.5+/-23.8 mg/dL and the mean TG was 123.2+/-62.8 mg/dL. MACE occurred in 41 cases (12.6%). Baseline serum lipid levels were similar between the patients with and those without MACE. However, the patients with MACE showed significantly higher TG level at 4 weeks (149.6+/-81.4 vs. 119.3+/-58.9 mg/dL, p=0.026) than those without. High on-treatment TG level (>or=150 mg/dL) were associated with increased adverse events compared to lower TG level in a univariate analysis (hazard ratio [HR], 3.3; p<0.001). In a multivariate analysis, high 4-week TG level after statin treatment was an independent predictor for MACE (HR, 4.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.85 to 9.06; p=0.001), however, baseline TG and LDL-C levels were not.", 
    "242": "High on-treatment TG level (>or=150 mg/dL) was associated with a higher risk of MACE. This finding supports the concept that achieving low TG levels may be an important therapeutic parameter in statin-treated patients following ACS and PCI."
