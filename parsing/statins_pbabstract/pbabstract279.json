Allocation to simvastatin plus ezetimibe produced an additional 18-mg/dL (0.47-mmol/L) decrease in LDL cholesterol level, representing an incremental 21% reduction over that achieved with simvastatin monotherapy (P < 0.0001). There were no statistically significant effects of the addition of ezetimibe to simvastatin on triglyceride or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Ezetimibe was not associated with an excess risk of abnormal liver function test results or of elevated creatine kinase levels and did not impair absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. There were no serious adverse events caused by study treatment.",

The 90% CIs surrounding the mean ratios for AUC(0-infinity) and AUC(0-infinity) for all 3 comparisons were between 0.80 and 1.25, suggesting the absence of a drug interaction for these parameters. For C(max), an absence of a drug interaction was observed between concomitantly administered IDD-P fenofibrate and both atorvastatin and simvastatin; absence of drug interaction was not found for IDD-P fenofibrate plus ER niacin. All treatments were well tolerated; headache was the most common adverse event (AE) (10%). One subject with creatinine kinase levels of 1300 IU/L (>6 times the upper limit of normal) at baseline experienced a seizure approximately 12 to approximately 13 hours after administration of IDD-P fenofibrate plus atorvastatin; this serious AE was deemed to be possibly related to study drug.",

Statin therapy increased the risk of any AE by 39% (OR = 1.4; 95% CI, 1.09-1.80; P = 0.008; NNH [number needed to harm] = 197) compared with placebo. Statins were associated with a 26% reduction in the risk of a clinical cardiovascular event (OR = 0.74; 95% CI, 0.69-0.80; P < 0.001; number needed to treat = 27). Treating 1000 patients with a statin would prevent 37 cardiovascular events, and 5 AEs would be observed. Serious events (creatine phosphokinase >10 times the upper limit of normal or rhabdomyolysis) are infrequent (NNH = 3400) and rhabdomyolysis, although serious, is rare (NNH = 7428). Atorvastatin was associated with the greatest risk of AEs and fluvastatin with the least risk. Simvastatin, pravastatin, and lovastatin had similar odds of AEs. Nonurgent AEs such as myalgia and liver function elevations were responsible for approximately two thirds of AEs reported in trials.",

    "14": "This report reviews data on the development of proteinuria in patients with chronic kidney disease who are treated with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) for dyslipidemia. Although subgroup analyses of statin trials have shown cardiovascular benefits in subjects with chronic kidney disease, concern about statin-induced proteinuria remains high. Experimental studies have suggested that the proteinuria seen with statin treatment results from the inhibition of receptor-mediated endocytosis, the likely mechanism of protein uptake in proximal tubular cells. Transient proteinuria may signify little more than the effective inhibition of cholesterol synthesis at this site. The blockade of protein trafficking in tubular cells is thought to reduce inflammation, slow fibrosis, and diminish proteinuria in the long term. Post hoc analyses of large clinical trials in subjects without overt renal disease have generally supported this notion, showing that statins most benefit patients with the greatest baseline renal deficits. Statins have also been shown to preserve glomerular filtration rate and reduce proteinuria in subjects with nondiabetic renal disease. In conclusion, in the absence of prospective, randomized trials in renally impaired patients, the collective evidence indicates that statin therapy may slow the decrease in renal function that generally attends atherosclerotic disease. The incidence of proteinuria with potent statins is only 1% to 2% when these drugs are given in recommended doses. Several large trials are currently under way to examine the safety and efficacy of statins in renally compromised patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease.", 
    "15": "Combination therapy of rosiglitazone and atorvastatin has been shown to have beneficial effects on glycemic control and lipid profiles in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study investigated the effects of the combination of rosiglitazone and atorvastatin on vascular inflammation by studying their effects on levels of biomarkers in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Thirty patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia were enrolled to receive rosiglitazone monotherapy at 4 mg/day for 3 months and then atorvastatin at 10 mg/day was added for 3 more months as combined therapy. Inflammatory biomarkers, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L), and adiponectin, and lipid profiles were measured at the time of initiation, after rosiglitazone monotherapy and after combination therapy with rosiglitazone and atorvastatin. With treatment of rosiglitazone at 4 mg/day monotherapy for 3 months, hs-CRP levels decreased significantly by 26% (p <0.05) and adiponectin levels increased significantly by 192% (p <0.05), but no significant changes in levels of MMP-9 and sCD40L were demonstrated. After combination therapy, hs-CRP levels further significantly decreased by another 23% (p <0.05) and adiponectin further increased by another 124%. In addition, serum levels of MMP-9, sCD40L, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased significantly compared with baseline levels. In conclusion, combination therapy with rosiglitazone and atorvastatin not only significantly improved lipid profiles but also decreased levels of vascular biomarkers, such as hs-CRP, MMP-9, and sCD40L, and increased serum adiponectin levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

    "21": "While diabetes mellitus is most often associated with hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity, these factors do not fully account for the increased burden of cardiovascular disease in patients with the disease. This strengthens the need for comprehensive studies investigating the underlying mechanisms mediating diabetic cardiovascular disease and, more specifically, diabetes-associated atherosclerosis. In addition to the recognized metabolic abnormalities associated with diabetes mellitus, upregulation of putative pathological pathways such as advanced glycation end products, the renin-angiotensin system, oxidative stress, and increased expression of growth factors and cytokines have been shown to play a causal role in atherosclerotic plaque formation and may explain the increased risk of macrovascular complications. This review discusses the methods used to assess the development of atherosclerosis in the clinic as well as addressing novel biomarkers of atherosclerosis, such as low-density lipoprotein receptor-1. Experimental models of diabetes-associated atherosclerosis are discussed, such as the streptozocin-induced diabetic apolipoprotein E knockout mouse. Results of major clinical trials with inhibitors of putative atherosclerotic pathways are presented. Other topics covered include the role of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and fibric acid derivatives with respect to their lipid-altering ability, as well as their emerging pleiotropic anti-atherogenic actions; the effect of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system by either ACE inhibition or angiotensin II receptor antagonism; the effect of glycemic control and, in particular, the promising role of thiazolidinediones with respect to their direct anti-atherogenic actions; and newly emerging mediators of diabetes-associated atherosclerosis, such as advanced glycation end products, vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor. Overall, this review aims to highlight the observation that various pathways, both independently and in concert, appear to contribute toward the pathology of diabetes-associated atherosclerosis. Furthermore, it reflects the need for combination therapy to combat this disease.",

Group two assigned to receive placebo were men and women chosen from the same geographical area and matched for age, sex, education and presence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Assessment was done with the Mini-Mental State Examination, Digit Span, Picture Test (average and delayed), Trail Making Test, Controlled Oral Word Association Test, Digit Symbol Substitution Test and Auditory Vigilance and Digit Vigilance Test at baseline and after 6 months. Changes between baseline and 6 months in the above parameters of mental function were compared using suitable statistical tests in the atorvastatin and placebo groups. To limit experiment-wise error, performance scores were grouped into five cognitive domains, which were labeled as attention, psychomotor speed, mental flexibility, working memory and memory retrieval. Summary effect sizes were estimated as z-scores.",

    "26": "The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of pravastatin on cholesteryl esters in foam cells of murine macrophages and the relation with caveolin-1. RAW 264.7 murine macrophages were coincubated with 80 mg/L oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) and pravastatin (0~100 mumol/L) respectively for 24 h. When the best control concentration of pravastatin was confirmed, RAW 264.7 murine macrophages were coincubated with 80 mg/L ox-LDL and pravastatin of the best concentration respectively for 0, 6, 12, 24 h. Oil red O dyeing experiment was used to show the lipid droplets in foam cells. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis was performed to determine the content of cellular cholesterol. The level of caveolin-1 was determined by Western blot analysis. The result showed that when macrophages were incubated with 80 mg/L ox-LDL, the ratio of cellular cholesteryl ester to total cholesterol (CE/TC) was beyond 50% through HPLC analysis, and a great deal of lipid droplets displayed in cells through Oil red O dyeing experiment, which manifested the formation of the foam cells. Pravastatin could decrease CE in foam cells in a concentration-dependent manner (1~100 mumol/L). At the concentration of 100 mumol/L, pravastatin decreased cellular CE more than 50%. The effects of pravastatin on the decrease of CE in murine macrophages also displayed a time-dependent manner (incubated with 100 mumol/L pravastatin from 6 to 24 h). Moreover, the expression of caveolin-1 was decreased when the macrophages were incubated with ox-LDL (80 mg/L), while treatment with pravastatin increased the level of caveolin-1 and displayed a concentration- and time-dependent manner. These results suggest that pravastatin could inhibit the development of foam cells through the decrease of cellular CE, which may be related to the upregulation of caveolin-1.", 
    "27": "Transporters play an important role in the processes of drug absorption, distribution and excretion. In this review, we have focused on the involvement of transporters in drug excretion in the liver and kidney. The rate of transporter-mediated uptake and efflux determines the rate of renal and hepatobiliary elimination. Transporters are thus important as a determinant of the clearance in the body. Even when drugs ultimately undergo metabolism, their elimination rate is sometimes determined by the uptake rate mediated by transporters. Transporters regulate the pharmacological and/or toxicological effect of drugs because they limit their distribution to tissues responsible for their effect and/or toxicity. For example, the liver-specific distribution of some statins via organic anion transporters helps them to produce their high pharmacological effect. On the other hand, as in the case of metformin taken up by organic cation transporter 1, drug distribution to the tissue(s) may enhance its toxicity. As transporter-mediated uptake is a determinant of the drug elimination rate, drug-drug interactions involving the process of transporter-mediated uptake can occur. In this review, we have introduced some examples and described their mechanisms. More recently, some methods to analyze such transporter-mediated transport have been reported. The estimation of the contributions of transporters to the net clearance of a drug makes it possible to predict the net clearance from data involving drug transport in transporter-expressing cells. Double transfected cells, where both uptake and efflux transporters are expressed on the same polarized cells, are also helpful for the analysis of the rate of transporter-mediated transcellular transport.",

Antibody titres to MDA-LDL-IgM, Cu-OxLDL-IgG and OxLDL-IC decreased, whereas MDA-LDL-IgG concentrations were increased after therapy. These changes were dose- and LDL-independent. POX-ACT concentrations were significantly positively correlated with inflammation markers before and after therapy and inversely with high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations after therapy.",

Patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) have a marked elevation in the plasma level of low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and they show early development of atherosclerosis. The aim of the present study was to test with a whole blood culture system if hyperlipoproteinemia is associated with increased cytokine production capacity in these patients and if treatment with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors influences this production capacity of blood cells, at both the protein and mRNA levels. The capacity of blood cells in a whole blood culture to produce IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-12, IL-18, and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) appeared to be similar for heterozygous FH patients and healthy volunteers. Furthermore, the capacity to produce IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha in response to LPS was not modified by cholesterol synthesis inhibitors at the level of mRNA expression or at the level of release. On the other hand, the release of IL-1Ra was significantly increased after treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, although only at the protein level. This suggests a possible beneficial anti-inflammatory role for this therapy.",

Regarding the class of the hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA-reductase-inhibitors (statins) case-reports have been published in the literature in association with each individual statin. We present a 60-years-old male who developed twice an acute pancreatitis while being treated with pravastatin. Because some case reports describe the reoccurrence of acute pancreatitis after exposure to a different statin, recommendations for further therapy remain complex. There are also case reports of pancreatitis associated with fibrates and information on rare adverse reactions associated with ezetimibe is sparse.", 
    "40": "Two cases of myopathy associated with ezetimibe are reported. In the first case, a woman on ezetimibe monotherapy presented with muscle pain and an elevated concentration of creatine kinase (CK) on two occasions, with ezetimibe 10 mg and with ezetimibe 5 mg after a washout period. The recurrence of muscle pain after washout and the CK increase both supported the hypothesis that ezetimibe alone can be linked to myalgia. In the second case, a man had been treated with atorvastatin, and ezetimibe 10 mg was added to improve his lipid profile. Two months later, the patient complained of muscle pain and a CK increase was noted. The appearance of symptoms when adding ezetimibe to atorvastatin supports a potential pharmacokinetic and/or a pharmacodynamic interaction between these two drugs. These cases suggest that ezetimibe monotherapy as well as ezetimibe associated with the use of a statin may induce myalgia. The mechanism by which ezetimibe could cause muscle pain is not known.",

The most widely recognized risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) include age, gender, cigarette smoking, sedentary lifestyle, elevated LDL, reduced HDL, hypertension, and diabetes. The consistency of associations between these factors and ASCVD risk across populations is substantial. Our understanding of the pathogenesis and etiology of coronary ASCVD, as well as its clinical implications, has grown tremendously over the past 20 y. The role garlic might play in treating ASCVD has been postulated for many years, but until recently no studies on garlic's ability to inhibit the atherosclerotic process have been reported. A pilot study evaluating coronary artery calcification and the effect of garlic therapy in a group of patients who were also on statin therapy suggested incremental benefits.

Statins are well known for their pleiotropic effects, which are independent of any reduction in cholesterol circulating levels. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of exposure to escalating doses of simvastatin on the sister chromatid exchange rate in cultured lymphocytes in order to identify the influence of statin on genomic damage. Peripheral lymphocytic samples for culture were obtained from 25 healthy volunteers, 20 patients with documented carotid atherosclerosis and 30 atherosclerotic patients on maintenance regular acetate-free biofiltration. Hemodialyzed patients had a greater percentage of high frequency cells (50%) than healthy controls (3%) and a significantly higher average number of sister chromatid (9.82+/-2.1 vs. 4.65+/-2.18). The subgroup of hemodialyzed patients with high plaque score values was characterized by significantly greater values for both sister chromatid exchanges rate and high frequency cells percentage. Our findings demonstrate that there is an association between sister chromatid exchanges and high frequency cells rate and atherosclerosis in acetate-free biofiltration patients. In cultures with added simvastatin, high frequency cells percentages and mean sister chromatid exchanges levels were significantly lower than in cultures with an added vehicle alone, the reduction occurring in a dose-dependent fashion, above all in cultures from end stage renal disease patients. The findings, moreover, demonstrate new effects of simvastatin, which appeared to mitigate the expression of genomic damage in our model. However, it is not yet clear whether this effect is due to the prevention of genomic damage or to the potentiation of the DNA repair capacity. Statins may therefore have an anti-atherogenic action partly ascribable to their ability to provide protection against the development of atherosclerotic plaque.", 
    "56": "Recent clinical trials confirm that aggressive lipid-lowering therapy with statins decreases low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to well below 100 mg/dL in high risk patients, and prevents cardiovascular events. Similarly, aggressive lipid lowering is being explored as a possible means of promoting regression of atherosclerosis and of affording greater protection from atherosclerotic events. A growing body of evidence indicates that intensive statin therapy, particularly in high risk patients, slows the rate of progression of atherosclerosis compared with moderate therapy, and that reductions of > or =40% in LDL cholesterol are necessary to achieve atherosclerosis regression. Questions remain regarding the extent of regression achieved with statin therapy and whether to dose statins to achieve a specific LDL-cholesterol level or a certain percent reduction; however, ongoing clinical trials may provide insight and guidance.", 
    "57": "Innate immunity was originally envisioned as a nonspecific host response to microbial pathogens. However, in the past few years, immunologists have discovered toll-like receptors (TLRs) and their role in recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns. TLRs and other components of innate immunity now help to explain the pathologic mechanisms underlying many common diseases, including atherosclerosis. At this time, C-reactive protein is the most useful biomarker for evaluating the inflammatory aspect of atherogenesis. Yet, operating beneath this commonly assayed biomarker are other components of the immune response. These inflammatory components of atherosclerosis and their genetic variations provide important insights. Today, novel antiatherogenic therapies are emerging, and at the same time a molecular groundwork is being laid for the genetic testing of statin efficacy. However, the adoption of clinical testing will need to wait until new therapeutic choices enter medical practice.",

However, data on the effects of statins on endothelial cells in hypoxia are limited. Here, effect of hypoxia and atorvastatin was assessed in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1). Hypoxia (1% O2) up-regulated vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) but, unexpectedly, it decreased interleukin-8 (IL-8) and placenta growth factor (PlGF) expression. Atorvastatin (0.1-1 microM) attenuated PlGF in HMEC-1 in normoxia while it decreased VEGF-A and IL-8 production both in normoxia and hypoxia. Notably, the expression of VEGF-D, macrophage scavenger receptor-1 (MSR1), transforming growth factor beta receptor III (TGFbetaR3) and inhibitor of DNA binding 3 (ID3) was augmented by atorvastatin in cells cultured in normoxia, while in hypoxia the statin attenuated their expression. These data showed that hypoxia influenced in the opposite way the expression of major endothelial genes, augmenting VEGF-A and decreasing IL-8 and PlGF. The influence of atorvastatin on angiogenic gene expression is complex, and final pro- or anti-angiogenic outcome of statin therapy remains to be established for numerous angiogenesis-related diseases.",

Therefore, we hypothesized that SREBPs are involved in statin-mediated regulation of VEGF production in VSMCs. SREBP1 was robustly expressed, and was activated by atorvastatin in VSMCs, as demonstrated by increased levels of the mature nuclear form of SREBP1, and increased promoter activities of a reporter containing sterol regulatory elements by atorvastatin. Moreover, overexpression of SREBP1a dose-dependently suppressed VEGF promoter activity. Site-specific mutation or deletion of the proximal Sp1 sites reduced the inhibitory effects of SREBP1a on VEGF promoter activity. These data demonstrated that SREBP1, activated by atorvastatin, suppressed VEGF expression through the indirect interaction with the proximal tandem Sp1 sites in VSMCs.",

Pre-treatment with simvastatin abolished the ischemia-induced activation of NF-kB observed in vehicle-treated animals. The evaluation of signal transduction pathways, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), SAPK/JNK 46/54 and p38, indicated that only ERK1/2 phosphorylation was enhanced by ischemia, and this activation was prevented by simvastatin. ERK1/2-inhibitor, U0126, reduced brain ischemia but not cytokine induction.

Blockade of this enzyme by atorvastatin (AT) inhibits the destructive proinflammatory T helper cell (Th)1 response during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and may be beneficial in the treatment of multiple sclerosis and other Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases. Here we present evidence linking specific isoprenoid intermediates of the mevalonate pathway to signaling pathways that regulate T cell autoimmunity. We demonstrate that the isoprenoid geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate (GGPP) mediates proliferation, whereas both GGPP and its precursor, farnesyl-PP, regulate the Th1 differentiation of myelin-reactive T cells. Depletion of these isoprenoid intermediates in vivo via oral AT administration hindered these T cell responses by decreasing geranylgeranylated RhoA and farnesylated Ras at the plasma membrane. This was associated with reduced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 phosphorylation and DNA binding of their cotarget c-fos in response to T cell receptor activation. Inhibition of ERK and p38 mimicked the effects of AT and induced a Th2 cytokine shift. Thus, by connecting isoprenoid availability to regulation of Th1/Th2 fate, we have elucidated a mechanism by which AT may suppress Th1-mediated central nervous system autoimmune disease.",

Cholesterol-lowering therapy using statins significantly reduces the risk of coronary heart disease. However, extensive use of statins leads to increases of other undesirable as well as beneficial effects, so-called pleiotropic effects. With respect to these effects, statins augment the expression of bone morphogenetic protein-2, a potent simulator of osteoblast differentiation and its activity, and promote mineralization by cultured osteoblasts, indicating that statins have an anabolic effect on bone. Chronic administration of statins in ovariectomized (OVX) rats modestly increases bone mineral density (BMD) of cancellous bone but not of compact bone. In clinical studies, there are conflicting results regarding the clinical benefits of this therapy for the treatment of osteoporosis. Observational studies suggest an association between statin use and reduction in fracture risk. Clinical trials reported no effect of statin treatment on BMD in hip and spine, and on bone turnover. Statins also may influence oral osseous tissues. Administration of statins in combination with osteoporosis therapy appears to improve alveolar bone architecture in the mandibles of OVX rats with maxillary molar extraction.

Manipulation of this pathway results in alteration of malignant cell growth and survival in cell culture and animal models, with promising potential for application in human cancers. Mevalonate is synthesized from 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA). Mevalonate is further metabolized to farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), which is the precursor for sterols. In addition, the farnesyl moiety from FPP is utilized for post-translational modification of proteins including small GTPases, such as Ras and Ras related proteins, which play a role in malignant transformation of cells. FPP is a precursor for geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), which is similarly involved in post-translational modification of proteins. There has been intense interest in manipulating the pathway through HMG-CoA reductase inhibition. More recently, the focus has been on manipulating the pathway by post-translational modification of key regulatory proteins through farnesyl prenyl transferase (FPTase) or geranylgeranyl prenyl transferase (GGPTase) inhibition. This review focuses on the mevalonate pathway and the application of rational drug therapies to manipulate this pathway. Included in the review are a summary of agents demonstrating success in preclinical investigations such as; farnesyl transferase inhibitors, geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitors, dual inhibitors, statins, bisphosphonates, histone deacetylase inhibitors and other compounds.

Atherogenic dyslipidemia clinically presents as elevated serum triglyceride levels, increased levels of small dense low-density lipoprotein (sdLDL) particles, and decreased levels of HDL-C. An important component of atherogenic dyslipidemia is central obesity, which is defined as increased waist circumference and has recently been identified as a chief predictor of the metabolic syndrome in certain patients. Another recent study found that both body mass index and waist circumference were highly predictive of eventual development of the metabolic syndrome. Because atherogenic dyslipidemia usually precedes the clinical manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, strategies to treat it are the focus of pharmacologic intervention. For example, the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, benefit hypercholesterolemic patients who have atherogenic dyslipidemia that is associated with the metabolic syndrome. Pioglitazone, an antidiabetic agent that acts primarily by decreasing insulin resistance, improves sensitivity to insulin in muscle and adipose tissue and inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis. Pioglitazone improves glycemic control while reducing circulating insulin levels. The investigational agent, rimonabant--a centrally and peripherally acting, selective cannabinoid type-1 receptor blocker--is the first therapy developed for managing several cardiovascular risk factors at one time. Rimonabant has shown promise in attacking atherogenic dyslipidemia from several vantage points by affecting glucose, HDL-C, triglycerides, and waist circumference in patients who are prone to atherogenic dyslipidemia.",

Despite the vast amount of effort expended in developing a cure, currently approved drugs address only cognitive symptoms that, although important for improving a patient's daily living standard, do not provide a significant delay or halt to disease progression. Early reports that individuals taking anti-inflammatory medications reduce their risk of developing AD has led to the \"inflammation hypothesis\" of AD and the subsequent testing of these drugs in the clinic. Tests of a select few of these medications in AD clinical trials have, however, yielded disappointing results. Reports of statin-based medications reducing the risk of AD have also led to the testing of this class of drugs in the clinic. Recently, the approval of the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine (Namenda) has provided clinical support for glutamatergic processes in the disease and generated a renewed interest in the role of excitatory amino acids in the etiology of AD. In this review, we take a closer look at these three compelling areas for addressing AD therapeutics: inflammation, cholesterol, and glutamate. We present arguments that these components are interconnected and mutually regulate processes involved in AD progression. Special focus is given to inflammation as a central feature of AD that may be acting in synergy with cholesterol and glutamate to mediate the observed pathophysiology.",

Moreover, there is an emerging body of data indicating that statins may have neuroprotective action. Recent studies suggest that CD40-CD40 ligand (CD40L) system is proven to be an important mediator of several auto-immune and chronic inflammation diseases. To address whether lovastatin produces neuroprotection as a potential novel anti-inflammatory pathway through the inhibition of CD40 expression, we examined the possible effects of lovastatin on expression of CD40, apoptosis, level of nitric oxide (NO) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in the cerebral vascular endothelial cells (CVECs) involved in cerebrovascular diseases. Preincubation with lovastatin (10(-7), 10(-6) and 10(-5) mol/l) for 24 hours (h) protected CVECs from TNF-alpha-induced decrease of cellular viability. Further, lovastatin inhibited the TNF-alpha-induced increases of NO level, NOS activity, apoptotic cells and CD40 expression in a dose-dependent manner, and anti-CD40 antibody also inhibited the cellular apoptosis induced by TNF-alpha. In conclusion, our data provide evidence to support a direct pro-inflammatory effect of CD40-CD40L signaling pathway in CVECs, and lovastatin possesses an anti-inflammatory effect independent of its lipid-lowering action involved in the cerebrovascular diseases.", 
    "104": "C-reactive protein (CRP), when measured by a highly sensitive method, is a measure of lowgrade, chronic inflammation and is an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). CRP also has the capacity to interact with other risk factors to increase the risk for T2D and CVD. Population distributions divided into tertiles provide the capacity to predict onset of T2D and associated CVD. Preanalytical as well as analytical sources of variation in high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) measurements need to be standardized in order for CRP results to be optimally useful. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Heart Association have issued guidelines for clinical usefulness of hsCRP measurements. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has taken steps to standardize hsCRP assays by evaluating secondary reference materials to be used by manufacturers to calibrate their assays.", 
    "105": "C-reactive protein (CRP) is a liver-derived pattern recognition molecule that is increased in inflammatory states. It rapidly increases within hours after tissue injury, and it is suggested that it is part of the innate immune system and contributes to host defense. Since cardiovascular disease is at least in part an inflammatory process, CRP has been investigated in the context of arteriosclerosis and subsequent vascular disorders. Based on multiple epidemiological and intervention studies, minor CRP elevation [high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP)] has been shown to be associated with future major cardiovascular risk (hsCRP:<1 mg/L=low risk; 1-3 mg/L=intermediate risk; 3-10 mg/L=high risk; >10 mg/L=unspecific elevation). It is recommended by the American Heart Association that patients at intermediate or high risk of coronary heart disease may benefit from measurement of hsCRP with regard to their individual risk prediction. Elevation of hsCRP is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes development in patients with all levels of metabolic syndrome. In type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, hemoglobin A1c significantly correlates with hsCRP levels and future cardiovascular risk. Also, hsCRP levels increase with the stage of beta-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance. Non-diabetes drugs that have been shown to reduce hsCRP concentrations include aspirin, statins, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, and fibrates. Recent intervention studies have also demonstrated the distinct efficacy of different anti-diabetes treatments on a variety of cardiovascular risk markers. Intensive insulin therapy may reduce inflammation, but this effect may be influenced by the degree of weight gain. Treatment with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma has lead to substantial reduction of hsCRP and other cardiovascular risk markers in several comparator studies. Since this effect was shown to be independent of the degree of glycemic improvement, it can be regarded as a classspecific effect. Whether these findings translate into a reduction of overall cardiovascular mortality will soon be shown by the currently running thiazolidinedione outcome studies. Positive results in these trials will further strengthen the value and acceptance of hsCRP, which is recommended as a predictive laboratory marker for cardiovascular disease risk also in patients with diabetes mellitus.", 
    "106": "There is a growing body of evidence for the role of inflammation in type 2 diabetes. In addition to the evidence presented elsewhere, evidence is emerging that many drugs that have apparent \"anti-inflammatory\" properties may reduce the incidence and/or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. Statins have been found to lower inflammatory markers, and a post hoc analysis of the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS) suggested that pravastatin may reduce the risk of developing diabetes, although the Lipid Lowering Arm of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) found no statistically significant effect of atorvastatin on risk of developing diabetes. Fibrates have been found to lower some markers of inflammation, and a prospective trial found that bezafibrate reduces risk of developing diabetes. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers appear to reduce some markers of inflammation, and a meta-analysis concluded that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers reduce risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Metformin is known to reduce the risk of developing diabetes, and more recent evidence suggests it also lowers C-reactive protein, in part because of its modest weight-reducing effect. Thiazolidinediones reduce risk of developing diabetes, and consistently lower inflammatory markers independent of adiposity effects. High-dose aspirin inhibits cyclooxygenase and IkappaB kinase-beta and reduces fasting plasma glucose concentration, although there has not, as yet, been a large-scale trial to examine the effect of aspirin on the risk of developing diabetes. We conclude that although many drugs with potential anti-inflammatory properties reduce the risk of developing diabetes, it is difficult to prove that such anti-inflammatory properties contribute to their diabetes prevention since nearly all drugs have other, often more pronounced, actions. Studies with more specific inhibitors of inflammatory pathways (e.g., interleukin- 6 blockers) and mendelian randomization (genetic studies) will help determine whether targeting the inflammation axis is a fertile mechanism to treat or prevent type 2 diabetes.",

Following simple liquid-liquid extraction, the analytes were separated using an isocratic mobile phase on a reversed-phase C18 column and analyzed by MS in the multiple reaction monitoring mode using the respective [M+H]+ ions, m/z 559/440 for atorvastatin, m/z 575/466 for ortho-hydroxyatorvastatin, m/z 575/440 for para-hydroxyatorvastatin and m/z 482/258 for the IS. The assay exhibited a linear dynamic range of 0.1-20 ng/mL for atorvastatin and its two metabolites in human plasma. The lower limit of quantification was 100 pg/mL with a relative standard deviation of less than 8%. Acceptable precision and accuracy were obtained for concentrations over the standard curve range. The average absolute recoveries of atorvastatin, ortho-hydroxyatorvastatin, para-hydroxyatorvastatin and the IS from spiked plasma samples were 54.2 +/- 3.2, 50.1 +/- 3.8, 65.2 +/- 3.6 and 71.7 +/- 2.7%, respectively. A run time of 2.5 min for each sample made it possible to analyze more than 300 human plasma samples per day.

    "112": "Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone tumour in young adults. Despite improved prognosis, resistance to chemotherapy remains responsible for failure of osteosarcoma treatment. The identification of signals that promote apoptosis may provide clues to develop new therapeutic strategies for chemoresistant osteosarcoma. Here, we show that lipophilic statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin, cerivastatin) markedly induce caspases-dependent apoptosis in various human osteosarcoma cells, independently of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 signaling and cell differentiation. Although statins increased BMP-2 expression, the proapoptotic effect of statins was not prevented by the BMP antagonist noggin, and was abolished by mevalonate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, suggesting the involvement of defective protein geranylgeranylation. Consistently, lipophilic statins induced membrane RhoA relocalization to the cytosol and inhibited RhoA activity, which resulted in decreased phospho-p42/p44- mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and Bcl-2 levels. Constitutively active RhoA rescued phospho-p42/p44-MAPKs and Bcl-2 and abolished statin-induced apoptosis. Thus, lipophilic statins induce caspase-dependent osteosarcoma cell apoptosis by a RhoA-p42/p44 MAPKs-Bcl-2-mediated mechanism, independently of BMP-2 signaling and cell differentiation.",

Paradoxically, baseline serum cholesterol, but not atorvastatin, influenced viral rebound at week 4.", 
    "114": "Rho-associated kinases (ROCKs), the immediate downstream targets of RhoA, are ubiquitously expressed serine-threonine protein kinases that are involved in diverse cellular functions, including smooth muscle contraction, actin cytoskeleton organization, cell adhesion and motility, and gene expression. Recent studies have shown that ROCKs may play a pivotal role in cardiovascular diseases such as vasospastic angina, ischemic stroke, and heart failure. Indeed, inhibition of ROCKs by statins or other selective inhibitors leads to the upregulation and activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and reduction of vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis. Thus inhibition of ROCKs may contribute to some of the cholesterol-independent beneficial effects of statin therapy. Currently, two ROCK isoforms have been identified, ROCK1 and ROCK2. Because ROCK inhibitors are nonselective with respect to ROCK1 and ROCK2 and also, in some cases, may be nonspecific with respect to other ROCK-related kinases such as myristolated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS), protein kinase A, and protein kinase C, the precise role of ROCKs in cardiovascular disease remains unknown. However, with the recent development of ROCK1- and ROCK2-knockout mice, further dissection of ROCK signaling pathways is now possible. Herein we review what is known about the physiological role of ROCKs in the cardiovascular system and speculate about how inhibition of ROCKs could provide cardiovascular benefits.", 
    "115": "Statins have a variety of properties that are independent of their lipid lowering ability. These anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, and antiapoptotic features have been collectively referred to as pleiotropic effects. Severe sepsis is an intense infection-induced inflammatory syndrome that ultimately results in organ dysfunction. Because so many cascades are triggered during sepsis, merely blocking a single component may be insufficient to arrest the inflammatory process. A growing body of evidence suggests that statins may indeed have a protective effect against severe sepsis and reduce the rate of infection-related mortality. This novel primary prevention concept may have far-reaching implications for the future management of serious infections. Moreover, it was recently shown that statins potentially improve outcome after the onset of sepsis. The stage is now set for randomized clinical trials that will determine the precise role, if any, that statins may have in preventing and treating sepsis.",

At the end of the 12th week, 6 in group A and B were killed randomly and their aortas were removed and the pathologic changes were observed. In the following 12 weeks, food enriched with cholesterol was substituted with normal food in all three groups. Pravastatin treatment was continued or started in the remaining members of group A and group B, but not in group C. At the end 24th week, all rabbits were killed and their aortas were examined for the fatty-streaks or atherosclerotic plaques.

Here we examined whether statins also reduce isoprenylation of gamma-subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins and thereby affect beta-adrenergic signaling and regulation of force in cardiac myocytes. Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (NRCM) were treated with atorvastatin (0.1-10 micromol/l; 12-48 h) and examined for adenylyl cyclase regulating G-protein alpha- (Galpha), beta- (Gbeta), and gamma- (Ggamma) subunits and cAMP accumulation. Engineered heart tissue (EHT) from NRCM was used to evaluate contractile consequences. In atorvastatin-treated NRCM, a second band of Ggamma3 with a lower apparent molecular weight appeared in cytosol and particulate fractions that was absent in vehicle-treated NRCM, but also seen after GGTI-298, a geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor. In parallel, Gbeta accumulated in the cytosol and total cellular content of Galphas was reduced. In atorvastatin-treated NRCM, the cAMP-increasing effect of isoprenaline was reduced. Likewise, the positive inotropic effect of isoprenaline was desensitized and reduced after treatment with atorvastatin. The effects of atorvastatin were abolished by mevalonate and/or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, but not by farnesyl pyrophosphate or squalene. Taken together, the results of this study show that atorvastatin desensitizes NRCM to beta-adrenergic stimulation by a mechanism that involves reduced isoprenylation of Ggamma and subsequent reductions in the cellular content of Galphas.",

Lovastatin affected various IR-induced stress responses in HUVEC: It attenuated the increase in p53/p21 protein level and impaired the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB, Chk-1, and Akt kinase but did not inhibit extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation. Exposure of HUVEC to IR did not change the level of Bax and Bcl-2 and did not cause activation of caspase-3, indicating that radioprotection by lovastatin does not depend on the modulation of the mitochondrial death pathway. Also, IR-induced DNA double-strand break formation and repair were not influenced by lovastatin.",

In addition, statins may have benefits in neuroprotection and recovery after stroke. The mechanisms by which statins protect against, and improve outcome after, stroke probably extend beyond lipid lowering.", 
    "136": "Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been implicated in tissue degradation in varicose veins. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) on the activity of MMPs in varicose veins. MMP-9 was present at significantly higher levels in varicose veins than in controls and was localized mainly in smooth muscle cells at the tunica media, where marked degradation of the extracellular matrix was observed. Both simvastatin and pravastatin strikingly suppressed MMP-9 activity in ex vivo culture of varicose veins. Simvastatin suppressed MMP-9 at both the mRNA and protein levels as well as at the urokinase-type plasminogen activator protein level, resulting in the dramatic suppression of MMP-9 activity induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Therefore, statins suppress MMP-9 activity by multiple mechanisms in varicose veins, suggesting they may have clinical potential for the treatment of this disease.", 
    "137": "The advanced atherosclerotic lesion is characterized by the formation of microscopic cholesterol crystals that contribute to mechanisms of inflammation and apoptotic cell death. These crystals develop from membrane cholesterol domains, a process that is accelerated under conditions of hyperlipidemia and oxidative stress. In this study, the comparative effects of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) on oxidative stress-induced cholesterol domain formation were tested in model membranes containing physiologic levels of cholesterol using small angle x-ray diffraction approaches. In the absence of HMG-CoA reductase, only the atorvastatin active o-hydroxy metabolite (ATM) blocked membrane cholesterol domain formation as a function of oxidative stress. This effect of ATM is attributed to electron donation and proton stabilization mechanisms associated with its phenoxy group located in the membrane hydrocarbon core. ATM inhibited lipid peroxidation in human low density lipoprotein and phospholipid vesicles in a dose-dependent manner, unlike its parent and other statins (pravastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin). These findings indicate an atheroprotective effect of ATM on membrane lipid organization through a potent antioxidant mechanism.", 
    "138": "Statins possess anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties beyond their cholesterol-lowering effects. To determine whether short-term atorvastatin treatment affects the acute phase and humoral immune responses to tetanus toxoid (TT) in normal healthy volunteers, we conducted a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial. Twenty healthy volunteers were assigned a 10-day treatment with atorvastatin (40 mg) or placebo. All volunteers received a TT booster on the fifth day. Subjects in the atorvastatin group had a significant reduction in total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (both p<0.001). Unexpectedly, the production of anti-TT antibodies (predominately IgG1) was three-fold higher in the atorvastatin group 15 days post-vaccination (2306 +/- 468 versus 713+/-21 units, p = 0.008). Atorvastatin also suppressed the post-vaccination rise in platelet and lymphocyte counts (both p<0.05). Acute phase parameters did not change significantly in either group.

We evaluated the effect of optimized medical and revascularization therapy on the incidence of SCD after an AMI. A total of 2,130 consecutive patients (mean age 59 +/- 10 years) with an AMI from 2 European centers (Germany and Finland) was included in the study. In this population, 1,004 patients (47%) were treated with an optimized medical and revascularization strategy (defined as treatment with revascularization, beta blockers, aspirin, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors). Nonoptimized treatment, defined as a lack of any optimized treatment, was received by 1,126 patients (53%). During the mean follow-up of 2.9 +/- 1.3 years, the incidence of SCD was very low among patients who received optimized treatment (1.2%, annual incidence 0.4%) compared with those who did not (3.6%, annual incidence 1.4%, p <0.01). The treatment strategy that had the greatest effect on differences in the SCD rate was revascularization therapy, with the hazard ratio of SCD being 2.1 (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 3.7, p <0.01) for SCD among nonrevascularized patients. Nonoptimized treatment was more often received by older patients, women, diabetic patients, and those with depressed left ventricular function. In conclusion, the incidence of SCD is low in the modern treatment era of patients after an AMI. Coronary revascularization seems to have a great effect on altered the epidemiologic pattern of SCD.", 
    "144": "Mice that lack apolipoprotein E (apoE) display a severe hypercholesterolemia, caused by the accumulation of apolipoprotein B-48 (apoB-48)-carrying remnants of chylomicrons and very-low-density lipoproteins in the plasma. Statins are potent inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis that, when administered to mice lacking apoE, cause paradoxical further increases in plasma cholesterol levels. In the present study, we examined the mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon. ApoE-deficient mice fed a chow diet containing simvastatin developed, as anticipated, an enhanced increase in plasma cholesterol and a decrease in plasma triglycerides. Fractionation of the plasma lipoproteins by FPLC revealed that the lipid changes were confined to the lipoprotein remnants. Western blot analysis of the remnants from the untreated and simvastatin-treated mice showed no differences in their apoB-48 content, indicating that both groups of animals accumulated similar numbers of remnant particles in the plasma. Following the injection of Triton WR-1339, the simvastatin-treated mice accumulated in the plasma significantly more cholesterol and significantly less triglycerides than the untreated animals. These results indicate that the enhanced hypercholesterolemia observed in apoE-deficient mice treated with simvastatin is not the result of an increased number of remnant particles in circulation but is caused by synthesis and secretion into the plasma of lipoproteins that are enriched in cholesterol and depleted of triglycerides.",

Significant reductions in severe sepsis (HR 0.83; 95% CI 0.70-0.97) and fatal sepsis (0.75; 0.61-0.93) were also observed. No benefit was noted with non-statin lipid-lowering agents (0.95; 0.75-1.22).", 
    "148": "Use of statins in patients with atherosclerosis is associated with a reduced risk of subsequent sepsis. Randomised trials of statins for prevention of sepsis are warranted.", 
    "149": "FIELD (\"Fenofibrate Intervention and Events Lowering in Diabetes\") study compared the incidence of coronary and cardiovascular events in 4895 patients with type 2 diabetes treated with fenofibrate (micronized fomulation, 200 mg/day) and in 4900 patients treated with placebo. After a mean 5-year follow-up, the fenofibrate group did not have less coronary events (primary endpoint), neither present a significant reduction in cardiovascular or total mortality as compared to the placebo group. However, it had significantly less non-fatal myocardial infarctions and cardiovascular events in general as well as less coronary and total revascularization procedures (secondary endpoints). The higher rate of starting statin therapy in patients allocated placebo might have masked a larger treatment benefit of fenofibrate on macrovascular complications. The tolerance of fenofibrate was good, even in combination with statins. More surprisingly, fenofibrate exerted a favourable effect on microangiopathy complications, with less albuminuria progression and less retinopathy needing laser treatment (tertiary endpoints).", 
    "150": "Intimal hyperplasia, resulting from a complex cascade of events involving platelets, leukocytes, and smooth muscle cells, may be inhibited by the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor pravastatin, which demonstrates inhibition of platelet activity and leukocyte adhesion and may be associated with inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration. Clopidogrel, an adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor inhibitor, was shown to decrease platelet activity and aggregation but not intimal hyperplasia (IH). We postulated that the combination of both pravastatin and clopidogrel would significantly decrease IH in a rat carotid endarterectomy model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 18) divided by treatment regimen underwent treatment for 2 weeks both before and after an open carotid endarterectomy. Serum collected at the time of harvest was measured for C-reactive protein (CRP), platelet activity, and total serum cholesterol; carotid arteries were removed and processed for IH determination. Control rats (n = 7) received oral vehicle daily before and following endarterectomy. Pravastatin-alone rats (n = 6) received oral pravastatin (10 mg/kg/day) before and after endarterectomy. Pravastatin plus clopidogrel rats (n = 5) received oral pravastatin (10 mg/kg/day) plus a preendarterectomy bolus of oral clopidogrel (4.3 mg/kg) before endarterectomy and resumed pravastatin (10 mg/kg/day) plus oral clopidogrel (1 mg/kg/day) postendarterectomy. Pravastatin alone and pravastatin plus clopidogrel significantly decreased CRP compared to controls (120.2 +/-11.2 and 134.1 +/- 9.9 vs 191.1 +/- 9.2 microg/mL, respectively p = 0.003 and p =0.0024). CRP levels were not different between pravastatin alone and pravastatin plus clopidogrel (p = 0.35). Platelet activity was significantly decreased by pravastatin alone and pravastatin plus clopidogrel in comparison to controls (7.3 +/- 2.2 and 6.6 +/- 2.8 vs 19.2 +/- 6.1 platelet reactive units (PRU), respectively p = 0.048 and p = 0.045). No significant difference was noted in platelet activity between pravastatin alone and pravastatin plus clopidogrel (p = 0.89). Pravastatin plus clopidogrel significantly reduced serum cholesterol compared to control and pravastatin alone (84.0 +/- 6.6 vs 110.4 +/- 7.4 and 117.0 +/- 8.8 mg/dL, respectively p = 0.03 and p = 0.01). Pravastatin alone did not decrease serum cholesterol compared to controls (p = 0.54). IH was not reduced by pravastatin alone compared to controls (p = 0.61) but was significantly decreased by pravastatin plus clopidogrel in comparison to control and pravastatin alone (3.0 +/- 1.1 vs 46.3 +/- 13.7 and 37.4 +/- 14.6% luminal stenosis, respectively p = 0.01 and p = 0.05). Pravastatin plus clopidogrel significantly decreased CRP, platelet activity, total serum cholesterol, and IH while pravastatin alone decreased only CRP and platelet activity. Intimal hyperplasia reduction may therefore be dependent on other contributors, possibly growth factors, cytokines, and oxidative stress. The combination of pravastatin plus clopidogrel may have synergistic or even additional inhibitory effects on IH. Pravastatin plus clopidogrel was effective in decreasing IH in a rat carotid endarterectomy model and may prove a useful therapy for IH reduction in the clinical setting.", 
    "151": "In the last decades, there has been an important progression in the development and assessment of various cholesterol-lowering agents. Until recently, in children under age 10, the focus of treatment has been on dietary and lifestyle adjustments. For children older than 10 years, bile acid-binding resins were also recommended if LDL-C levels remained high after dietary adjustment. However, the lipid-lowering effect of bile acid-binding resins is modest at best and long-term compliance is often poor. In contrast, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are currently widely used in adults and are considered the first choice in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. In the last few years, several randomized trials have shown that statins are also effective in reducing LDL cholesterol levels in children and seem safe at least in the short term. Another novel development is the cholesterol-lowering agent, ezetimibe, which inhibits cholesterol absorption in the intestine. Although efficacy and safety data in children are still lacking, ezetimibe has a good safety profile in adults, either as monotherapy or in combination with a statin. Lastly, two other classes of lipid-lowering drugs include fibrates and nicotinic acid, but most agree that the side effect profile precludes their use in children except in extreme circumstances. Overall, therapeutic options to lower cholesterol levels in children are expanding.", 
    "152": "Release of progenitor cells is observed during inflammatory conditions and contributes to neovascularization. We, therefore, sought to investigate the relationship of circulating progenitor cells and interleukin (IL)-8 in acute myocardial infarction (AMI).", 
    "153": "From patients with stable angina and AMI, serial venous blood samples were obtained. The number of circulating CD133+CD45- progenitor cells, endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), and circulating endothelial P1H12+CD45- cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. After stenting in patients with AMI, an increase in plasma IL-8 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentrations was observed, which was only minimal in patients with stable angina. Only in patients with AMI, this was followed by an increase in circulating CD133+CD45- progenitor cells. In contrast, circulating endothelial P1H12+CD45- cells and E-selectin RNA expression in peripheral blood were only elevated early in AMI, indicating shedding of activated endothelial cells. Multivariable analysis revealed an association of IL-8 and circulating CD133+CD45- progenitor cells in AMI, in addition to statin therapy and risk factor profile.", 
    "154": "In AMI, IL-8 is associated with circulating progenitor cells. In addition to the pro-angiogenic functions of IL-8 and VEGF, this mechanism may contribute to new vessel generation and, thereby, improve myocardial function.", 
    "155": "Despite the benefits of statin therapy, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol management remains suboptimal and many patients do not achieve their recommended target goals. The aim of combination lipid drug therapy in high-risk patients is to achieve LDL cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol goals with a minimum of serious adverse effects. Although statins are the drug of first choice, statin monotherapy may be limited by intolerance of dose escalation or failure to attain non-HDL cholesterol goals in those with mixed hyperlipidemia. Statins plus bile acid resins or ezetimibe can achieve greater than 50% reduction in LDL cholesterol, with little or no increase in adverse effects. Fibrates, niacin, and omega-3 fatty acids, when added to statins, can reduce triglycerides, increase HDL cholesterol, and reduce non-HDL cholesterol to a greater extent than statin monotherapy. The safety profile of combination lipid therapy is acceptable if the global coronary heart disease risk of the patient is high, thus producing a favorable risk to benefit ratio. Careful surveillance of hepatic transaminases, avoidance of gemfibrozil in statin-fibrate combinations, and awareness of statin-concomitant drug interactions is key to safe and efficacious use of combination lipid drug therapy.", 
    "156": "Statins inhibit cholesterol synthesis and are effective in lowering total cholesterol levels in plasma or serum due to reductions in low-density lipoprotein and very low-density lipoproteins, as well as reducing progression of coronary atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, and stroke morbidity and mortality. These agents also modestly raise levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and its major protein, apolipoprotein (apo) A-I. The more effective statins can also raise the levels of large alpha-1 HDL particles as assessed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. High levels of these particles promote reverse cholesterol transport and protect against coronary heart disease and progression of coronary atherosclerosis. The mechanism whereby statins alter HDL and its subspecies appears to be due to reduction of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, with a secondary decrease in cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity, and less transfer of HDL cholesterol to triglyceride-rich lipoprotein acceptor particles. Increasingly, statins will be combined with other agents such as ezetimibe, fibrates, niacin, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors to optimize the entire lipoprotein profile to alter not only low-density lipoprotein, but also HDL, triglycerides, lipoprotein(a), and C-reactive protein, and also to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.", 
    "157": "Statins have been shown to interact with metabolic pathways that potentially affect physiologic functions beyond cholesterol balance. We may broadly categorize non-lipid effects of statins as clinically favorable or clinically detrimental. Whether non-lipid effects of statins are of clinical significance and whether there are differences in non-lipid effects among statins remain points of major current controversy. This review evaluates the available information on potential differences among statins in non-lipid effects.", 
    "158": "Outcomes from recent lipid-lowering trials have led to an update of the third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel's guidelines for treatment of hypercholesterolemia in adults. The updated NCEP guidelines now offer an optional goal of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol of less than 70 mg/dL for high-risk individuals. Epidemiologic and clinical trial data suggest that for every 30-mg/dL change in LDL, the relative risk for coronary heart disease changes by about 30%. Statin therapy effectively lowers LDL and has an overall excellent safety profile in clinical trials. However, the use of high-dose statin therapy also entails greater risk of adverse events, such as myopathy and liver function test abnormalities, and this must be carefully weighed against the potential benefit for each patient. Alternative approaches targeting high-density lipoproteins and triglycerides may offer yet another option for coronary heart disease prevention in high-risk patients.", 
    "159": "Diabetes is known to play a causal role in promoting both microvascular and macrovascular complications. Reducing rates of end-organ damage has been a key objective of multiple clinical trials. In addition to the roles of glycemic and blood pressure control, it is evident that lipid reduction via statin therapy independently helps to reduce the risk of primary and secondary vascular events. This effect seems to remain intact across a broad range of lipid levels, suggesting additional mechanisms for efficacy of statin medications beyond cholesterol reduction. The demonstrated safety and data from recent trials lend support to the argument that all people with diabetes should be started on statin therapy regardless of their cholesterol level. It is also plausible that treating the underlying mechanisms of vascular dysfunction, inflammation, and injury so prevalent in diabetic patients would have similar implications for the patient identified as having insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome.", 
    "160": "HMG CoA Reductase inhibitors, more commonly called statins, are used in the pharmacological management of hyperlipidaemia. At present, the use of these drugs is increasing worldwide. They have been linked to certain adverse drug reactions, including impotence. The aim of the present study is to explore the basis of the association between statin use and impotence using data from spontaneous reports.", 
    "161": "We analysed the cases of impotence associated with statins that were collected by the Spanish and French pharmacovigilance systems. We used cases of impotence as a numerator and consumption data as a denominator to estimate the cumulative reported incidence of impotence.", 
    "162": "Thirty-eight cases of impotence associated with statins have been identified in the database of the Spanish pharmacovigilance system; overall, there was a temporal sequence of events in all cases and the adverse reaction disappeared after drug withdrawal in 93% of the cases. Sixteen patients had also been treated with other drugs. In France, 37 cases were collected. In 85% of these cases recovery from the adverse reaction was observed after drug withdrawal; there was a positive rechallenge in five cases, and 15 patients were receiving other drugs at the same time. No significant differences among reported incidences with different statins were found.", 
    "163": "Considering the widespread use of this drug class and the under-reporting of this particular reaction it could affect a large number of patients. The reaction seems to be reversible in most of the cases after drug withdrawal. Doctors should be aware of this potential adverse reaction when prescribing statins to their patients.", 
    "164": "Many commonly used medications have neurotoxic adverse effects; the most common of these is peripheral neuropathy. Neuropathy can be a dose-limiting adverse effect for many medications used in life-threatening conditions, such as malignancy and HIV-related disease. Epidemiological evidence supports previous case reports of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (or 'statins') causing an axonal sensorimotor neuropathy or a purely small-fibre neuropathy in some patients. The neuropathy improves when the medication is withdrawn. Despite the association between HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and neuropathy, the risk is low compared with the significant vascular protective benefits. Oxaliplatin, a new platinum chemotherapy agent designed to have fewer adverse effects than other such agents, has been shown to cause a transient initial dysaesthesia in addition to an axonal polyneuropathy. Thalidomide, an old therapy currently being utilised for new therapeutic indications (e.g. treatment of haematological malignancies), is associated with a painful, axonal sensorimotor neuropathy that does not improve on withdrawal of the drug. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors are important components of highly active antiretroviral therapy, but are associated with a sensory neuropathy that is likely to be due to a direct effect of these drugs on mitochondrial DNA replication. New research demonstrates that lactate levels may help discriminate between neuropathy caused by nucleoside analogues and HIV-induced neuropathy. Understanding the mechanism of drug-induced neuropathy has led to advances in preventing this disabling condition."
