    "0": "Dyslipidemia conveys a major increased risk of future cardiovascular events in older persons. Data from large randomized controlled trials confirm that statin therapy is as beneficial in older adults as it is in younger persons in both primary and secondary prevention. National guidelines support the use of statin therapy to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in older adults, with the recommended goal of <100 mg/dL in high-risk patients and an optional goal of <70 mg/dL in very high-risk patients. In the majority of high-risk older patients, these levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol can be achieved with initial low doses of an efficacious statin, but in some clinical situations, combination therapy may be considered. Moreover, statins appear to be safe and well tolerated in older age groups. Because of heightened risks of drug-drug interactions, the likelihood of polypharmacy in seniors, and issues of tolerability and convenience, monotherapy with low doses of an efficacious statin may be preferable to combination therapy in elderly individuals.", 
    "1": "Numerous epidemiologic and intervention trials, including many studying elderly cohorts, have demonstrated the importance of lipids in primary and secondary preventions of cardiovascular diseases, including coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke. More recent studies have demonstrated that more intensive statin therapy that reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels to <70 to 80 mg/dL have resulted in more marked cardiovascular event reduction than less intensive statin treatment. The authors review the efficacy and safety of intensive vs less intensive statin therapy. Specifically, 4 such studies with sufficient data in elderly patients, including 2 trials of patients with stable CHD and 2 with acute coronary syndrome, demonstrating the efficacy and safety of intensive statin therapy with high-dose (80 mg) atorvastatin are reviewed in detail. Although elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug interactions when receiving high doses of statins, the present evidence supports the use of intensive statin therapy in most high-risk elderly patients both with stable CHD and following acute coronary syndrome.",

    "3": "Fifty-eight patients with hyperlipemia and 26 normal controls were enrolled in this study. Patients with hyperlipemia were randomly divided into 2 groups: a simvastatin treatment group (20 mg/d) and a control group (without simvastatin treatment). Twenty-six healthy people were served as normal control group(n=26).The corrected IBS values(C-IBS) in carotid arteries,the intima-media thickness (IMT), and the serum MMP-9 levels were measured in the normal control group and the patients with hyperlipemia before and 8 weeks after the simvastatin therapy.", 
    "4": "The C-IBS of the simvastatin treatment group and the control group was significantly lower than that in the normal control group (all P<0.05). The IMT and MMP-9 in the simvastatin treatment group and the control group were significantly higher than those in the normal control group (all P<0.05). There was a negative correlation between the C-IBS of carotid arteries and the serum MMP-9 levels in the patients with hyperlipemia (r=-0.76,P<0.05). Eight weeks after the simvastatin treatment, the serum MMP-9 levels decreased significantly(P<0.05).",

After weaning, male pups were allocated to untreated or treated groups with atorvastatin (low and high doses, 5 or 30 mg.kg.day) in two different periods (from 21 days old to 3 months old and from 3 to 6 months old). The blood pressure (BP) was 30% greater in untreated LP offspring than in treated offspring (from 165 +/- 6 mm Hg to 127 +/- 3 mm Hg, P < .01). After 1 month of treatment, only untreated LP offspring continued with high BP. Compared with untreated LP offspring, atorvastatin reduced blood glucose (less 30%, P < .05) and cardiomyocyte size (less 24%, P < .05), whereas untreated LP offspring had greater interstitial fibrosis (plus 74%, P < .01), reduction of myocardial vascularization (less 25%, P < .01) and major reduction of cardiomyocyte number (less 38%, P < .01) than treated LP offspring.",

Fifty-five patients were randomized to atorvastatin (10 mg/day) (statin group); the remaining 55 patients received no statins (controls). Patients were followed for 1 year. At baseline, the two groups did not differ in age, sex, left ventricular ejection fraction, cholesterol, B-type natriuretic peptide, heart rate variability, or QT variability. During follow-up, 29 patients died (26%) and 2 patients (2%) underwent heart transplantation. Of the 29 deaths, 13 were attributed to pump failure, 15 were attributed to SCD, and 1 was attributed to noncardiac causes. All-cause mortality was lower in the statin group (9/55, 16%) than in controls (20/55, 36%) (P = .017). The same was true of the SCD rate (3/55 [5%] vs. 12/55 [22%], P = .012), but not of the pump failure (5/55 [9%] vs. 8/55 [15%], P = .38).

Analyses showed that patients were usually offered appropriate advice and treatment, with 89% being on a statin. However, the audit indicated a high variability in family tracing between the sites, with significant differences in the frequency of inclusion of a family pedigree in the notes (range 1-71%, mean 35%); the general practitioner (GP) being advised that first-degree relatives should be tested (range 4-52%, mean 27%); and the proportion of relatives contacted and tested (range 6-50%, mean 32%).",

Practice in family tracing appears to vary widely between clinics.", 
    "16": "Whilst statin monotherapy is often sufficient to reach LDL-C goals, treatment may not reach all lipid goals in individuals with mixed dyslipidaemia typically associated with metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes. Double or triple combination therapy, which provides the opportunity to address multiple lipid abnormalities simultaneously, may be required to achieve targets in some patients. Addition of fenofibrate or niacin (nicotinic acid) to statin therapy is likely to be the first option, as recommended by national treatment guidelines; omega-3 fatty acids may also be useful. Careful monitoring is required when adding additional agents given the increased potential for drug interactions and side effects.", 
    "17": "Chronic kidney disease is generally thought to be a progressive disorder regardless of etiology. Over the past 15 years, investigations into the mechanisms of disease progression and treatment designed to slow or halt disease progression have been conducted, largely in the adult kidney disease population. Intervention trials have demonstrated that lowering blood pressure in hypertensive patients and administration of drugs that block the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system are effective at slowing kidney disease progression, including diabetes, hypertension, and various glomerular diseases. In addition, novel strategies including anemia therapy with erythropoietin-stimulating agents have been conducted to determine whether treatment of this common complication of kidney disease can stabilize kidney function. Whereas substantial success has been achieved in more common forms of adult kidney disease such as diabetes and hypertension, slowing progression of some immune-mediated glomerular disease such as lupus nephritis and immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy remain a great challenge. Moreover, there is no proven strategy, including multifactorial interventions, that clearly halts progressive chronic kidney disease that has been studied prospectively in a large-scale, long-term trial. The purpose of this review is to discuss these trials, as they form the underpinnings for current clinical practice guidelines in adults with chronic kidney disease.",

Despite the well-recognized benefits of statins, there is evidence that low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reductions as specified by National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) are not being met. The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of Zo-20 (\"GMP\", Georgia) in achieving the target level for LDL-C in patients with CAD and hypercholesterinemia. 100 patients received 20-40 mg Zo-20 during the 3 months period, all parameters of the blood plasma lipids and adverse events were monitored during the study. 78% of patients reached the target goal for LDL-C, using 28,2 mg Zo-20 daily. No serious adverse events associated with study drug treatment were revealed. Zo-20 seems to be very effective and safety in treatment of patients with CAD and lipid disorders.",

The beneficial effects of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG) coenzyme A (CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) on glucose metabolism have been suggested, but the effects of these agents on adipose tissue inflammation are unclear. The aim of the present study is to define the effects of statins on adipose tissue inflammation and macrophages.", 
    "20": "Pravastatin or pitavastatin treatment of obese mice attenuated an increase in mRNA expressions of proinflammatory genes, including MCP1 and IL6, in adipose tissue. The supernatant of TLR4-stimulated RAW264 macrophages strongly induced the expression of these genes in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which was inhibited by pretreatment of macrophages with either statin. Statins inhibited TLR4-mediated activation of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor (IRF)3 by either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or palmitic acid, resulting in suppression of IFN-beta expression, but not that of NF-kappaB or JNK. Moreover, statins strongly downregulated TLR3-mediated gene expressions by poly(I:C), but not TLR2-stimulation by zymosan A. Neutralization of IFN-beta attenuated proinflammatory activities of the macrophage supernatant.",

    "22": "Excess brain extracellular glutamate induced by cerebral ischemia leads to neuronal death, mainly through overactivation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. The cholesterol-lowering drugs statins have been reported to protect from NMDA-induced neuronal death but, so far, the mechanism underlying this protection remains unclear. Because NMDA receptors have been reported to be associated with the cholesterol-rich membrane domains known as lipid rafts, we have investigated the effect of treatments that deplete cholesterol levels on excitotoxicity and on association of NMDA receptors to lipid rafts.", 
    "23": "Primary neuronal cultures were pretreated with inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis and cholesterol, and NMDA-induced cell death was determined by measuring release of lactate dehydrogenase. Lipid raft fractions were isolated and Western blots were performed.", 
    "24": "Treatment with the inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis simvastatin, which inhibits the first step of cholesterol synthesis, or AY9944, which inhibits the last step of cholesterol synthesis, protected neurons from NMDA-induced neuronal death by 70% and 54%, respectively. Treatment with these compounds reduced neuronal cholesterol levels by 35% and 13%, respectively. Simvastatin and AY9944 reduced the association of the subunit 1 of NMDA receptors (NMDAR1) to lipid rafts by 42% and 21%, respectively, and did not change total expression of NMDAR1. Addition of cholesterol reduced neuroprotection by statins and AY9944, and partially reverted the effect of simvastatin on the association of NMDAR1 to lipid rafts.", 
    "25": "These data demonstrate that reduction of cholesterol levels protects from NMDA-induced neuronal damage probably by reducing the association of NMDA receptors to lipid rafts.",

    "27": "To evaluate the relation between statin use and prostate cancer risk, we conducted a retrospective cohort study during 1 January 1990 to 31 August 2005 among men 45-79 years receiving care within Group Health, an integrated healthcare delivery system. Information on statin use and covariates were obtained from health plan databases. We identified incident prostate cancer cases through the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for prostate cancer among statin users compared to non-users.", 
    "28": "Among 83,372 men studied, median follow-up time was 5.7 years and 2,532 prostate cancer cases were identified. About 14.4% used statins over the study period and median duration of use was 3.3 years. Compared to non-users, hydrophobic statin users had a reduced risk of prostate cancer (HR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.66-0.94), and results are suggestive of a reduced risk among ever users of statins (HR = 0.88; 95% CI, 0.76-1.02) and hydrophilic statin users (HR = 0.67; 95% CI, 0.33-1.34). There was no trend in risk by duration of statin use, and no association between statin use and cancer aggressiveness, stage, or grade.", 
    "29": "Overall, this study does not support an associated between statin use and prostate cancer but a reduced risk cannot be ruled out.", 
    "30": "Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a proinflammatory cytokine with multiple biological functions. We and others have demonstrated that an increased level of circulating IL-18 is one of the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) has been reported to be a potent hypertrophy-promoting factor through RhoA and Rho-Kinase. Mechanical stretch induces a hypertrophic response, partly through the production of ET-1 through Endothelin A receptor (ETAR). Moreover, it has also been reported that mechanical stretch induces cardiac hypertrophy through Angiotensin subtype 1 receptor (AT1R). However, the mechanism by which the IL-18 gene expression is regulated in cardiomyocytes has not yet been fully understood. This study was designed to elucidate the functional significance of IL-18 gene expression in response to mechanical stretch. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes cultured on silicone dishes were subjected to stretch. The moderate 20% mechanical stretch resulted in the elevation of IL-18 expression in a time-dependent manner with the maximal level achieved 36 hours after the stretch. Olmesartan, AT1R antagonist inhibited stretch-induced IL-18 expression. ETAR blockade BQ123 inhibited stretch-induced IL-18 expression. However, the Endothelin B receptor (ETBR) receptor blockade BQ788 did not inhibit this reaction. ET-1 induced IL-18 expression, with a peak induction after 4 hours of incubation. These results might suggest that stretch stimulation of cardiomyocytes induced ET-1 and, subsequently, ET-1 up-regulated the IL-18 expression. Furthermore, Fasudil, a Rho-Kinase inhibitor, and Simvastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, led to a significant reduction in mechanical stretch-induced IL-18 expression. These results indicated, for the first time, that IL-18 expression is induced by mechanical stretch in cardiomyocytes via the ETAR, AT1R, and the Rho/Rho-K pathways. The induction of IL-18 from cardiomyocytes by mechanical stress might cause the deterioration of cardiac functions in autocrine and paracrine fashion. The inhibition of IL-18 expression induced by mechanical stress might be one of the mechanisms that account for the beneficial cardiovascular effects of AT1R antagonist, ETAR blockade, Statin, and Rho-Kinase inhibitor.", 
    "31": "Peripheral arterial disease is prevalent and reflects overall cardiovascular disease state. Best medical treatment is the cornerstone of management to reduce peripheral arterial disease symptoms and to minimize vascular morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to assess the prescription practice of general practitioners in Northern Ireland for patients with peripheral arterial disease. All general practitioners were from the Northern Ireland Professional Medical Directory, and a questionnaire was used to determine the prescribing patterns for peripheral arterial disease. In all, 468 general practitioners responded; 94% prescribed aspirin to nondiabetic patients, and 44.9% prescribed statin, with similar results for diabetic patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, multivitamins, and beta-blockers were not often prescribed. Statin was prescribed to patients with diabetic peripheral arterial disease at a lower cholesterol concentration. In all, 52% would consider statin and fibrate together. Budgetary consideration influenced 6%. Northern Ireland general practitioners are reluctant to prescribe medication that is effective in the secondary prevention of vascular morbidity and mortality in high-risk patients.", 
    "32": "We assessed lipid goal achievement in patients at high risk for vascular events from a general practice (London, United Kingdom). Patients were identified as those with a prescription for hypolipidaemic medication, a significant (>20%) Framingham risk, and from the myocardial infarction register. Two hundred forty-five patients were currently taking a statin (average dose, 23.1 mg/day). Cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and triglycerides changed significantly following statin treatment. Of 285 patients who had taken statins at some time point, 11 (3.9%) were intolerant, 5 of which subsequently tolerated another statin. Approximately 10.1% of patients discontinued statin treatment for unclear reasons. Only 64 patients (29.1% of 220) reached the Joint British Societies' Guidelines on Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease target of a total cholesterol of <4.0 mmol/L; 50 patients (38.8% of 129) reached the low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol target of <2.0 mmol/L. This value of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol is similar to that recommended by the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology. With regard to the General Medical Services guidelines target for total cholesterol, 162 (73.6% of 220) patients reached <or=5.0 mmol/L. The group that best achieved target cholesterol (Joint British Societies' Guidelines and General Medical Services) were those with comorbidities. In conclusion, while reaching General Medical Services targets was satisfactory, the percentage of patients reaching Joint British Societies' Guidelines targets was not. This discrepancy may reflect the presence of multiple guidelines. The current stricter lipid targets are difficult to achieve; possible methods that may be used to improve lipids further could involve using combination therapy, statin dose titration, and better education.",

In patients with a history of MI and/or those who underwent myocardial revascularisation these have to be supplemented with medication. Several pharmacological agents are known to improve prognosis in these patients, i.e. beta-blockers, antiplatelet agents, statins, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi). The present article focuses mainly on the role of ACEi in the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with a history of MI or myocardial revascularization.",

While they are still considered the first line of treatment for suppression of AF, antiarrhythmics often lead to treatment failure, complications and undesired consequences. Pulmonary vein ablation is an invasive procedure which is not always curative. Recently, there have been a variety of studies reporting the potential antiarrhythmic effects of various nonantiarrhythmic agents. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the findings reported thus far about the antiarrhythmic effects of agents which are not antiarrhythmic drugs themselves, but which have been found to offer promise in the prevention and treatment of AF.",

Limited data exist, however, in primary prevention in those aged over 75 years. Although the Prospective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk included patients between the ages of 70 and 82 years, it did not show coronary heart disease risk reduction in primary prevention. Meta-analysis of statin trials, however, reveals significant coronary heart disease risk reduction in the elderly along with potential cerebrovascular accident risk reduction. Lower doses of statins may be required in the elderly due to drug interactions and differences in metabolism related to aging.",

This review examines the evidence supporting the use of omega-3 fatty acid treatment in dyslipidemic states.", 
    "42": "There is now considerable evidence that omega-3 fatty acid treatment at the prescription strength of 4 g/day effectively and safely lowers triglyceride levels and increases low-density lipoprotein size, as well as affecting high-density lipoprotein metabolism. Similar effects have been noted in patients treated with statins, and add-on prescription omega-3 fatty acid therapy significantly increases the proportion of statin-treated dyslipidemic patients reaching their non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals. In addition to past studies showing a cardioprotective effect of low-dose omega-3 fatty acid treatment against sudden death, a recent controlled clinical trial showed that 1.8 g of omega-3 fatty acid in statin-treated patients reduced major coronary events by 19% compared with statin plus placebo treatment.",

In particular, the atherogenic dyslipidemia of diabetes often requires combination therapy to target aspects of the lipid profile beyond low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This article will review the characteristics of dyslipidemia in diabetes, and discuss guidelines and strategies for treatment to reduce cardiovascular disease risk.", 
    "45": "A number of clinical outcomes trials supports the use of statins to reduce cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The disappointing results of clinical trials involving torcetrapib to increase high-density lipoprotein levels may lead to renewed interest and utilization of niacin for the management of atherogenic dyslipidemia. Long-term use of fibrate therapy in patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia has recently been associated with reduction in all-cause, cancer, and cardiovascular mortality rates. Ongoing trials are investigating whether addition of niacin or fibrate to statin therapy is superior to statin therapy alone in preventing cardiovascular events.", 
    "46": "Aggressive low-density lipoprotein control continues to be the primary goal of therapy in dyslipidemia management. Given the growing body of evidence showing the cardiovascular benefits of treating other lipid components, however, it is easy to anticipate that full normalization of the lipid profile may become the standard of care for diabetic dyslipidemia.", 
    "47": "Statins have different effects beyond cholesterol reduction and stimulate angiogenesis. We investigated the effect of simvastatin in diabetes-related healing defects. An incisional skin wound model produced on the back of female diabetic mice (db(+)/db(+)) and their normoglycemic littermates (db(+)/(+)m) was used. Animals were treated daily either with simvastatin (5 mg/(kgi.p.)) or vehicle. Mice were killed on different days (3, 6 and 12 after skin injury) for measurement of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA and protein expression, to assess histologically the healing process and to evaluate wound breaking strength and angiogenesis by CD31 immunostaining. Simvastatin administration in diabetic mice increased VEGF mRNA (simvastatin=4.8+/-0.6n-fold/beta-actin; vehicle=2.3+/-0.4n-fold/beta-actin) and protein expression (simvastatin=5+/-0.7 integrated intensity; vehicle=2.2+/-0.3 integrated intensity) and enhanced nitric oxide wound content at day 6. Additionally, the statin augmented breaking strength and PECAM-1 immunostaining at day 12. Finally, simvastatin administration restored the impaired wound healing process in diabetic mice. Similar results were obtained in normoglycaemic mice. Passive immunization with anti-VEGF antibody (10 microg/mouse) completely abrogated the beneficial effects of simvastatin on healing in diabetic mice. Simvastatin has potential application in diabetes-related wound healing disorders.", 
    "48": "The most compelling evidence for the cardiovascular benefit provided by omega-3 fatty acids comes from 3 large controlled trials of 32,000 participants randomized to receive omega-3 fatty acid supplements containing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or to act as controls. These trials showed reductions in cardiovascular events of 19% to 45%. These findings suggest that intake of omega-3 fatty acids, whether from dietary sources or fish oil supplements, should be increased, especially in those with or at risk for coronary artery disease. Patients should consume both DHA and EPA. The target DHA and EPA consumption levels are about 1 g/d for those with known coronary artery disease and at least 500 mg/d for those without disease. Patients with hypertriglyceridemia benefit from treatment with 3 to 4 g/d of DHA and EPA, a dosage that lowers triglyceride levels by 20% to 50%. Although 2 meals of oily fish per week can provide 400 to 500 mg/d of DHA and EPA, secondary prevention patients and those with hypertriglyceridemia must use fish oil supplements if they are to reach 1 g/d and 3 to 4 g/d of DHA and EPA, respectively. Combination therapy with omega-3 fatty acids and a statin is a safe and effective way to improve lipid levels and cardiovascular prognosis beyond the benefits provided by statin therapy alone. Blood DHA and EPA levels could one day be used to identify patients with deficient levels and to individualize therapeutic recommendations.", 
    "49": "The uptake of drugs into hepatocytes is a key determinant for hepatic metabolism, intrahepatic action, their subsequent systemic plasma concentrations, and extrahepatic actions. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that many drugs used for treatment of cardiovascular diseases (e.g., oral antidiabetic drugs, statins) are taken up into hepatocytes by distinct organic anion transporters (organic anion transporting polypeptides [OATPs]; gene symbol SLCO/SLC21) or organic cation transporters (OCTs; gene symbol SLC22). Because most patients with type 2 diabetes receive more than one drug and inhibition of drug transporters has been recognized as a new mechanism underlying drug-drug interactions, we tested the hypothesis of whether oral antidiabetic drugs can inhibit the transport mediated by hepatic uptake transporters.", 
    "50": "Using stably transfected cell systems recombinantly expressing the uptake transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1, or OCT1, we analyzed whether the antidiabetic drugs repaglinide, rosiglitazone, or metformin influence the transport of substrates and drugs (for OATPs, sulfobromophthalein [BSP] and pravastatin; for OCT1, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium [MPP(+)] and metformin).", 
    "51": "Metformin did not inhibit the uptake of OATP and OCT1 substrates. However, OATP-mediated BSP and pravastatin uptake and OCT1-mediated MPP(+) and metformin uptake were significantly inhibited by repaglinide (half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] 1.6-5.6 micromol/l) and rosiglitazone (IC(50) 5.2-30.4 micromol/l).",

The MetS status (NCEP ATPIII definition, at least three of these five criteria: fasting glucose, triglycerides, HDL-C, waist circumference and hypertension.) of each patient was analyzed (Mann-Whitney test) according to carotid intima-media thickness, number of plaques, and a combined cardiovascular score.", 
    "55": "After exclusion of 6 patients treated with statins or insulin or both, MetS status was available for 140 (90.9%) patients and positive for 10 (7.1%). MetS status was due predominantly to blood glucose and triglyceride levels and was strongly correlated with all atherosclerosis markers (p < or = 0.01).", 
    "56": "The MetS prevalence in this population is low for a group with HIV infection, even after inclusion of the statin-treated patients (11.4%), but remains higher than among the general population. MetS in this population is probably a heterogeneous cluster of side effects of antiretroviral therapy (high triglycerides, lower HDL-C, and hypertension) and direct effects of HIV (glucose disturbances).

Simultaneously, manufacturers are working hard at improving temporal resolution, so that uninterpretable cardiac CT examinations will progressively disappear. Cardiac CT scanners are used primarily to rule out coronary disease in patients with a low cardiovascular risk but must also be able to perform thoracic and cardiac computed tomography. Assessment of bypass graft patency, analysis of ventricular function, myocardial diseases (ischemic or not), valvular disease, diagnosis of chest pain in the emergency department--all can be studied perfectly with this technique. In the near future analysis of the composition of coronary plaque and its monitoring during statin treatment will also become possible.",

This article outlines the current knowledge regarding the use of antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents and statins in patients who have heart failure.", 
    "59": "Inflammation is increased in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and plays a role in exercise intolerance. We investigated whether pravastatin administration is effective in improving exercise capacity in patients with COPD, and whether baseline or serial changes in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) over time are associated with corresponding changes in exercise capacity. In a randomized, double-blinded, and parallel design, 125 patients with clinically stable COPD were randomly assigned to receive placebo or pravastatin (40 mg/day) over a period of 6 months. Plasma hs-CRP levels were measured before randomization and during follow-up. Baseline characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. Exercise time remained stable throughout the study in the placebo group. Exercise time increased by 54% from 599 +/- 323 seconds at baseline to 922 +/- 328 seconds at the end (p <0.0001) in pravastatin-treated patients. A decrease in hs-CRP over baseline values was observed in 79% of patients (42 of 53) treated with pravastatin. Pravastatin-treated patients with a greater percent decrease in hs-CRP had a significant improvement in exercise time compared with those without hs-CRP decrease. A significant correlation was found in univariate analysis between decrease of log-transformed hs-CRP and increase of exercise time. Baseline hs-CRP and change of hs-CRP were significantly correlated with exercise time, even after adjustment for lipid profiles and hemodynamics. In conclusion, these data reinforce hs-CRP as a significant surrogate marker in COPD and underscore an important guide to the efficacy of treatment in COPD trials.", 
    "60": "Although statin treatment is generally well tolerated, it is estimated that 5% to 10% of patients develop muscle-related side effects (MRSEs), resulting in less effective nonstatin alternatives or cessation of lipid-lowering therapy completely. This study was designed to assess the efficacy and tolerability of extended-release fluvastatin (fluvastatin XL) and ezetimibe alone or in combination in patients with previous MRSEs with other statins. This was a double-blinded, double-dummy trial of 199 mostly moderate- or high-risk dyslipidemic patients randomized to fluvastatin XL 80 mg/day (n = 69), ezetimibe 10 mg/day (n = 66), or fluvastatin XL 80 mg/day plus ezetimibe 10 mg/day (n = 64) for 12 weeks. Fluvastatin XL lowered low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 32.8% compared with 15.6% with ezetimibe (between-group difference -17.1%, 95% confidence interval -23.6 to -10.7, p <0.0001); the fluvastatin XL/ezetimibe combination lowered LDL cholesterol by 46.1% (between-group difference vs ezetimibe -30.4%, 95% confidence interval -37.0 to -23.8, p <0.0001). Proportions of patients achieving their National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III target LDL cholesterol were 84% with the fluvastatin XL/ezetimibe combination, 59% with fluvastatin XL, and 29% with ezetimibe (p <0.001 for fluvastatin XL monotherapy or combination therapy vs ezetimibe monotherapy). Incidences of MRSEs were 24% in the ezetimibe group, 17% in the fluvastatin XL group, and 14% in the combination group. There were no instances of creatine kinase increases >or=10 times upper limit of normal. In conclusion, in patients with a history of statin-associated MRSEs, fluvastatin XL alone or in combination with ezetimibe offers an effective and well-tolerated lipid-lowering option.", 
    "61": "Diabetes mellitus is a strong risk factor for atherosclerosis and is often characterized by dyslipidemia. Besides acting on traditional lipids, statins and fibrates may also exert beneficial effects on various pro- and antiatherogenic lipid subparticles. This analysis was undertaken to evaluate combination therapy on lipid subparticles in the Diabetes and Combined Lipid Therapy Regimen (DIACOR) study. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and no histories of coronary heart disease were evaluated (n = 498). Eligible patients underwent a 6- to 8-week washout period of all lipid-lowering medications and were enrolled if they demonstrated mixed dyslipidemia (having >or=2 of the following 3 lipid parameters: low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol >or=100 mg/dl, triglycerides >or=200 mg/dl, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol <40 mg/dl). Patients were randomized to simvastatin 20 mg, fenofibrate 160 mg, or combined simvastatin 20 mg and fenofibrate 160 mg. Lipid subparticles were assessed 12 weeks after randomization by the Vertical Auto Profile II method. A total of 300 patients (mean age 61.6 +/- 11.5 years, 55% men) were randomized. Combination therapy was superior in lowering LDL cholesterol pattern B (-33.9 mg/dl) and dense very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-10.0 mg/dl) and increasing high-density lipoprotein3 (+2.3 mg/dl) and exerted the greatest change in altering the LDL cholesterol size profile. A potential effect on lipoprotein(a) (-0.5 mg/dl) was also found. For those with triglycerides >170 mg/dl, combination therapy was superior in lowering dense very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (-10.7 mg/dl) and LDL cholesterol pattern B (-35.8 mg/dl), the lipids that tend to be formed in the presence of elevated triglycerides. In conclusion, in this trial of mixed dyslipidemic patients with diabetes, combination therapy was more effective in changing a variety of other cardiovascular risk markers.", 
    "62": "This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of ezetimibe (10 mg/day) alone or in combination with atorvastatin (10 mg twice a week) on hypercholesterolemia in 56 high-risk patients intolerant to daily statin use. Ezetimibe monotherapy was well tolerated (2 withdrawals) and induced a mean reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol of 20% (p <0.05) at the third month. However, of the 54 patients still taking ezetimibe, only 5 (9%) were at their LDL cholesterol targets. Atorvastatin 10 mg twice a week was then added to ezetimibe and was well tolerated (3 withdrawals). This combination reduced LDL cholesterol (in a treatment-based analysis) by 37% compared with baseline (p <0.001), with 43 (84%) patients reaching their LDL cholesterol goals. When patients (n = 34, 25 men) with baseline serum creatinine values in the upper 2 tertiles were analyzed separately, there was a significant (p = 0.041) decrease in serum creatinine levels after 6 months of treatment. In conclusion, the combination of ezetimibe plus atorvastatin 10 mg twice a week might be a therapeutic option for high-risk patients intolerant to daily statin monotherapy.",

For the patients with ALI/ARDS, the mean (+/- standard deviation) age was 58 +/- 17 years and 62% were male. The most common predisposing risk factors were pneumonia (50%) and nonpulmonary sepsis (26%). Mean (+/- standard deviation) tidal volume/kg was 7.0 +/- 1.7 ml/kg. Median (interquartile range) duration of ventilation was 6.8 (2.0 to 12.8) days. Median (interquartile range) length of stay in the intensive care unit was 10.0 (5.0 to 18.5) days. The overall intensive care unit mortality for ALI/ARDS was 32.3%. Lower baseline arterial oxygen tension/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were associated with increased mortality.

Pitavastatin decreased the cellular cholesteryl ester content in a dose-dependent manner, and this effect was not via inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase because the 3-30 nM pitavastatin did not inhibit [14C]cholesterol synthesis from [14C]acetic acid and the effect was not influenced by addition of mevalonic acid. Pitavastatin increased neutral cholesterol esterase (NCEase) activity and did not affect ACAT activity, and decreased the expression of CD36 and ABCA1 mRNA. The mechanism of the increase of NCEase activity was that pitavastatin directly modified the substrate state, which was cholesterol oleate emulsified with lecithin.",

Interestingly, HL-60-R2, an all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-resistant HL-60 variant, was twice as sensitive to SV than HL-60. Further studies revealed the particular mechanism of action of SV-induced apoptosis in leukemia. SV directly and rapidly disordered mitochondria with a loss of its membrane potential, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and subsequent irreversible damage with cytochrome c leakage and, finally, SV induced apoptosis through caspase-9 activation, whereas several studies have shown that other statins induced apoptosis to leukemia by the depletion of isoprenoids used for the prenylation of small GTPases, which are essential for cellular signal transduction. Our findings suggest that the mitochondrial pathway plays an important role in the higher potency of SV as a new class of agents for anti-leukemic therapy alone and/or in combination with agents.",

    "86": "Recent studies have shown that the mevalonate pathway plays an important role in skeletal metabolism. Statins stimulate bone morphogenetic proteins-2 (BMP-2) production in osteoblasts, implicating a possible beneficial role for statins in promoting anabolic effects on bone. Here, we investigated the effects of a lipophilic simvastatin on osteoblast differentiation using mouse myoblast C2C12 cells, in the presence of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), an inflammatory cytokine that inhibits osteogenesis. The addition of TNF-alpha to C2C12 cells suppressed the BMP-2-induced expression of key osteoblastic markers including Runx2 and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. Simvastatin had no independent effects on Runx2 and alkaline phosphatase activity; however, it reversed the suppressive effects of TNF-alpha. The ability of simvastatin to reverse TNF-alpha inhibition of BMP-induced Smad1,5,8 phosphorylation and Id-1 promoter activity suggests the involvement of Smad signaling pathway in simvastatin action. In addition, cDNA array analysis revealed that simvastatin increased expression levels of Smads in C2C12 cells exposed to TNF-alpha that also activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), P38, and stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK). Simvastatin potently suppressed TNF-alpha-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and SAPK/JNK by inhibiting TNF-alpha-induced membrane localization of Ras and RhoA. Farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) reversed the simvastatin effects on TNF-alpha-induced activation of Ras/Rho/MAPK pathways. FPP and GGPP also restored the simvastatin effects on TNF-alpha-induced suppression of Runx2 and ALP activity. In addition, simvastatin decreased the expression levels of TNF type-1 and -2 receptor mRNAs. Collectively, simvastatin supports BMP-induced osteoblast differentiation through antagonizing TNF-alpha-to-Ras/Rho/MAPK pathway and augmenting BMP-Smad signaling, suggesting a potential usage of statins to ameliorate inflammatory bone damage.", 
    "87": "Besides lowering cholesterol, statins exert multiple effects, such as anti-inflammatory activity and improvement of endothelial cell function. We examined whether simvastatin (SS) protects against the development of elastase-induced pulmonary emphysema in mice by using mean linear intercepts of alveoli (Lm) as a morphometric parameter of emphysema. After injection of intratracheal elastase on day 0, C57BL/6 mice were treated daily with SS (SS+ group) or PBS (SS- group) for 2 wk. A 21% decrease in Lm on day 7 was observed in the SS+ group vs. the SS- group. Anti-inflammatory effects of SS were observed as a decrease in percentage of neutrophils up to day 3, and in hydroxyproline concentration on day 3, in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). SS also increased the number of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive alveolar epithelial cells between days 3 and 14. To confirm the role of statins in promoting proliferation of alveolar cells, mice were treated with SS (SS+) vs. PBS (SS-) for 12 days, starting 3 wk after elastase administration. After SS treatment, Lm decreased by 52% and PCNA-positive alveolar epithelial cells increased compared with the SS- group. Concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor in BALF and endothelial nitric oxide synthase protein expression in pulmonary vessels tended to be higher in the SS+ group vs. the SS- group in this protocol. In conclusion, SS inhibited the development of elastase-induced pulmonary emphysema in mice. This therapeutic effect was due not only to anti-inflammation but also to the promotion of alveolar epithelial cell regeneration, partly mediated by restoring endothelial cell functions.",

Treatment with simvastatin resulted in reduced expression of macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, increased expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and reduced the number of macrophage infiltration. In quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, simvastatin significantly inhibited upregulated expression of interleukin-1beta, inducible nitric oxide synthase, matrix metalloproteinase-2, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 associated with CA progression. Gelatin zymography revealed decreased activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in aneurysmal walls by simvastatin treatment.

We tested the hypothesis that C. pneumoniae induced inflammatory gene expression is regulated by Rho-GTPase-related histone modifications. C. pneumoniae infection induced the liberation of proinflammatory interleukin-6, interleukin-8, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and interferon-gamma by human endothelial cells. Cytokine secretion was reduced by simvastatin and the specific Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 but was synergistically enhanced by inhibitors of histone deacetylases trichostatin A and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid. Infection of endothelial cells with viable C. pneumoniae, but not exposure to heat-inactivated C. pneumoniae or infection with C. trachomatis, induced acetylation of histone H4 and phosphorylation and acetylation of histone H3. Pretreatment of C. pneumoniae-infected cells with simvastatin or NSC23766 reduced global histone modifications as well as specific modifications at the il8 gene promoter, as shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Reduced recruitment of nuclear factor kappaB p65/RelA as well as of RNA polymerase II was observed in statin-treated cells. Taken together, Rac1-mediated histone modifications seem to play an important role in C. pneumoniae-induced cytokine production by human endothelial cells.", 
    "93": "Angiogenesis requires the mobilization of progenitor cells from the bone marrow and homing of progenitor cells to ischemic tissue. Statins facilitate the former, and the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) enhances the latter. Their combined influence on angiogenesis was studied in vivo in the ischemic hindlimb C57BL/6 mouse model. The ischemic to non-ischemic perfusion ratio increased from 0.29 +/- 0.02 immediately after femoral excision to 0.51 +/- 0.10 three weeks after the surgery in the mice treated with either fluvastatin or SDF-1 alone, which is significantly better than the control (0.38 +/- 0.05, p < .05, n = 6). The combined use of fluvastatin and SDF-1 further improved the reperfusion ratio (0.62 +/- 0.08, p < .05). More cell proliferation, less apoptosis, enhanced bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) incorporation and higher capillary density were observed in ischemic tissue treated with both statin and SDF-1. In vitro mono-treatment with either fluvastatin (100 nM) or SDF-1 (100 ng/ml) facilitated EPC proliferation and migration, inhibited EPC apoptosis, enhanced expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and -9 (MMP-9), and increased Akt phosphorylation and nitric oxide production. These effects were significantly augmented by the two agents together and ablated by inhibitors of either Akt or nitric oxide synthase (NOS). In conclusion, statin and SDF-1 additively enhance progenitor cell migration and proliferation and down-regulate EPC apoptosis, resulting in improved reperfusion via activation of the Akt/NOS pathway and up-regulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression.",

Sixty-three patients (23%) demonstrated progression of disease by ultrasound examination, 27 (10%) progressed to carotid endarterectomy, and three (1%) experienced a stroke during follow-up. Mean CRP levels were higher among patients that progressed on duplex examination (6.7 +/- 1.28 vs 4.6 +/- 0.4 mg/dl, P < .05). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significant difference in freedom from progression of carotid artery disease for patients with 1(st) and 3(rd) quartile CRP levels (log-rank test P < .05). Adjusting for diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, coronary artery disease, aspirin or other anti-inflammatory uses, and statin therapy, 4(th) quartile CRP was independently associated with disease progression (OR 1.8, 95% CI; 1.03-2.99, P < .05).",

In this study, we investigated the influence of mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), the active metabolite of the frequently used plasticizer di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), on gonadal steroidogenesis in vitro. MEHP (25-100 microM) stimulated basal steroid synthesis in a concentration-dependent manner in immortalized mouse Leydig tumor cells (MLTC-1). The stimulatory effect was also detected in KK-1 granulosa tumor cells. MEHP exposure did not influence cAMP or StAR protein levels and induced a gene expression profile of key steroidogenic proteins different from the one induced by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Simultaneous treatment with MEHP and a p450scc inhibitor (aminoglutethimide) indicated that MEHP exerts its main stimulatory effect prior to pregnenolone formation. MEHP (10-100 microM) up-regulated hormone-sensitive lipase and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, suggesting that MEHP increases the amount of cholesterol available for steroidogenesis. Our data suggest that MEHP, besides its known inhibitory effect on hCG action, can directly stimulate gonadal steroidogenesis in both sexes through a cAMP- and StAR-independent mechanism. The anti-steroidogenic effect of DEHP has been proposed to cause developmental disorders such as hypospadias and cryptorchidism, whereas a stimulation of steroid synthesis may prematurely initiate the onset of puberty and theoretically affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.", 
    "104": "Amlodipine/atorvastatin (Caduet) is a once-daily fixed-dose combination of the dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist amlodipine and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor atorvastatin.

In clinical trials, the fixed-dose combination of amlodipine/atorvastatin effectively managed two important risk factors simultaneously in hypertensive patients at risk of cardiovascular disease or in those with concomitant hypertension and dyslipidemia. The combination is bioequivalent to amlodipine and atorvastatin given alone and does not modify the efficacy of either single agent. Amlodipine/atorvastatin is generally well tolerated, with a tolerability profile consistent with that of each single agent. Compared with the coadministration of each single agent, the convenience of single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin has the potential to improve patient adherence and the management of cardiovascular risk in selected patients, thereby improving clinical outcomes.",

A low level of high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is recognized as an important independent risk factor for occurrence of a CV event, and new therapies capable of producing effective, clinically relevant increases in this key lipoprotein particle are in development. These therapies will most likely be assessed in comparison with proven CV-risk-reducing therapies such as statin treatment, rather than against a placebo comparator. Inevitably, therefore, clinical end-point trials will increase in both complexity and longevity. Potential efficacy data on new therapies may be revealed sooner by trials using surrogate end points, biomarkers of disease progression known to correlate with clinical events. For novel CV therapies, ultrasound-measured changes in atherosclerosis, such as the change in atheroma burden or plaque volume measured by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), or ultrasound-measured increase in carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), may represent useful biomarkers.

To determine the beneficial effects of statins on the airway hyperresponsiveness in allergic bronchial asthma, we investigated the effects of systemic treatment with lovastatin on the augmented BSM contraction and activation of RhoA in rats with allergic bronchial asthma. Rats were sensitized and repeatedly challenged with 2,4-dinitrophenylated Ascaris suum antigen. Animals were also treated with lovastatin (4 mg kg(-1) day(-1) ip) once a day before and during the antigen inhalation period. Repeated antigen inhalation caused a marked BSM hyperresponsiveness to ACh with the increased expression and translocation of RhoA. Lovastatin treatments significantly attenuated both the augmented contraction and RhoA translocation to the plasma membrane. Lovastatin also reduced the increased cell number in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids and histological changes induced by antigen exposure, whereas the levels of immunoglobulin E in sera and interleukins-4, -6, and -13 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids were not significantly changed. These findings suggest that lovastatin ameliorates antigen-induced BSM hyperresponsiveness, an important factor of airway hyperresponsiveness in allergic asthmatics, probably by reducing the RhoA-mediated signaling.",

Statins can exert pleiotropic effects aside from lowering cholesterol and blood pressure levels through several different pathways, which may lead to distinct patterns of changes in gene expression in vital end-organs. The aim of the present study was to systemically evaluate gene expression changes in three major end-organs (the brain, heart and kidney) induced by atorvastatin at a dose that altered neither blood pressure nor plasma total cholesterol levels. The stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive (SHRSP) rats, an established model of hypertension and end-organ damage, was treated with atorvastatin (15 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks from 12 to 16 weeks of age. DNA microarray technology was used to identify gene expression changes in three end-organs. In the current experimental setting, 4 weeks of atorvastatin treatment lowered plasma levels of non-esterified fatty acid significantly (P=0.0012) and triglyceride modestly (P=0.07) without altering blood pressure and plasma total cholesterol levels in male SHRSP rats. The level of expression of a number of genes was changed in an organ-specific manner after 4 weeks of drug administration to SHRSP rats. Among the end-organs studied, the most prominent alteration in gene expression was observed in the heart. The identical treatment protocol was applied to age-matched normotensive control rats, Wistar Kyoto rats, and this also caused a number of genes to be differentially expressed in an organ-specific manner. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the potential efficacy of statins in protecting against end-organ damage in essential hypertension and thus lay the foundation for future studies.",

    "172": "To improve the evaluation of the possible antiarrhythmic effect of statins, we performed a meta-analysis of randomized trials with statins on the end point of incidence or recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF).", 
    "173": "The use of statins had been suggested to protect against AF in some clinical observational and experimental studies but has remained inadequately explored.", 
    "174": "A systematic review of controlled trials with statins was performed. Eligible studies had to have been randomized controlled parallel-design human trials with use of statins that collected data on incidence or recurrence of AF.", 
    "175": "Six studies with 3,557 patients in sinus rhythm were included in the analysis. Three studies investigated the use of statins in patients with a history of paroxysmal AF (n = 1) or persistent AF undergoing electrical cardioversion (n = 2), and 3 investigated the use of statins in primary prevention of AF in patients undergoing cardiac surgery or after acute coronary syndrome. Incidence or recurrence of AF occurred in 386 patients. Overall, the use of statins was significantly associated with a decreased risk of AF compared with control (odds ratio [OR] 0.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.18 to 0.85, p = 0.02). Benefit of statin therapy seemed more marked in secondary prevention of AF (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.03, p = 0.06) than for new-onset or postoperative AF (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.37, p = 0.23).", 
    "176": "Use of statins was significantly associated with a decreased risk of incidence or recurrence of AF in patients in sinus rhythm with a history of previous AF or undergoing cardiac surgery or after acute coronary syndrome.", 
    "177": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can noninvasively assess changes in atherosclerotic plaque morphology and composition. The ORION trial assessed the effects of rosuvastatin on carotid plaque volume and composition.", 
    "178": "The randomized, double-blind ORION trial used 1.5-T MRI to image carotid atherosclerotic plaques at baseline and after 24 months of treatment. Forty-three patients with fasting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol > or = 100 and < 250 mg/dL and 16% to 79% carotid stenosis by duplex ultrasound were randomized to receive either a low (5 mg) or high (40/80 mg) dose of rosuvastatin.", 
    "179": "After 24 months, 33 patients had matched serial MRI scans to compare by reviewers blinded to clinical data, dosage, and temporal sequence of scans. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was significantly reduced from baseline in both the low- and high-dose groups (38.2% and 59.9%, respectively, both P < .001). At 24 months, there were no significant changes in carotid plaque volume for either dosage group. In all patients with a lipid-rich necrotic core (LRNC) at baseline, the mean proportion of the vessel wall composed of LRNC (%LRNC) decreased by 41.4% (P = .005).", 
    "180": "In patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia, both low- and high-dose rosuvastatin were effective in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Furthermore, rosuvastatin was associated with a reduction in %LRNC, whereas the overall plaque burden remained unchanged over the course of 2 years of treatment. These findings provide evidence that statin therapy may have a beneficial effect on plaque volume and composition, as assessed by noninvasive MRI.", 
    "181": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) after cardiac surgery is associated with significant morbidity. We investigated whether preoperative statin therapy was associated with decreased incidence of postoperative AF in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, including isolated valve surgery and patients with low ejection fraction (EF).", 
    "182": "A retrospective study of consecutive patients without history of AF (n = 4044) who underwent cardiac surgeries at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital (Houston, TX), from January 1, 2003, through April 30, 2006, was conducted. Postoperative AF was assessed by continuous telemetry monitoring during hospitalization for cardiac surgery.", 
    "183": "A total of 2096 patients (52%) received preoperative statins. Atrial fibrillation occurred in 1270 patients (31.4% in both the statin and nonstatin groups). In multivariate regression analysis, age >65 years, history of valvular heart disease, rheumatic disease, pulmonary disease, and New York Heart Association class III/IV were independent predictors of increased risk, whereas female sex was associated with decreased risk. Preoperative statin therapy was not associated with decreased risk in the entire cohort (odds ratio [OR] 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98-1.31) or in subgroups undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.97-1.43), isolated valve surgery (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.81-1.46), or both (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.72-1.65), or the subgroup with EF <35% (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.84-1.82). After propensity score analysis (n = 867 patients in each group), preoperative statin therapy was not associated with decreased AF incidence (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.92-1.41).", 
    "184": "Preoperative statin therapy was not associated with decreased incidence of postoperative AF in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, including patients with low EF.", 
    "185": "Contrast media cause oxidative stress, which has been suggested as one possible mechanism responsible for contrast-induced nephropathy. Statins appear to have pleiotropic effects, including antioxidant properties. We investigated to determine whether simvastatin pretreatment reduces the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy in a high-risk population of patients with renal insufficiency undergoing coronary angiography.", 
    "186": "We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-center trial, involving 247 consecutive patients with chronic renal insufficiency (calculated creatinine clearance < or = 60 mL/min and/or serum creatinine > or = 1.1 mg/dL) undergoing coronary angiography. Patients were randomized to simvastatin (n = 124; 160 mg total, 40 mg orally every 12 hours starting the evening before and ending the morning after the procedure) or placebo (n = 123). All patients received pre - and postprocedure hydration. The iso-osmolar contrast agent iodixanol was used for coronary angiography in all patients.", 
    "187": "There was no difference between simvastatin and placebo in mean peak increase in serum creatinine measured within 48 hours after coronary angiography, the primary study end point (0.002 +/- 0.164 vs 0.017 +/- 0.230 mg/mL respectively, P = .559). The incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy, a secondary end point defined as increase of either > or = 25% or > or = 0.5 mg/dL in serum creatinine, was 2.5% in simvastatin-treated patients (3/118) and 3.4% in placebo-treated patients (4/118), a nonsignificant difference (P = 1.00). There were also no differences between the 2 groups in length of hospital stay or 1- and 6-month clinical outcomes.", 
    "188": "Simvastatin pretreatment for short-term at high dose do not prevent renal function deterioration after administration of contrast medium in patients with baseline renal insufficiency undergoing coronary angiography.", 
    "189": "Anemia is a risk factor for adverse cardiovascular disease outcomes. However, there is limited information concerning the association of hemoglobin concentration and new onset of clinically recognized coronary artery disease (CAD).", 
    "190": "An historical cohort study was conducted with patients from Veterans Affairs medical centers. Baseline hemoglobin determinations were evaluated with respect to CAD using data from records of 25,622 subjects with no known heart disease. Coronary artery disease was identified from a new diagnosis based on the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition, coding or a new prescription for nitroglycerin. Models were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, creatinine clearance, and use of statin or beta-blocker.", 
    "191": "Among the cohort, 5297 (20.7%) subjects developed CAD over 73,895 person-years of follow-up. Compared with control hemoglobin levels of 15.0 to 17.0 g/dL, the multivariable-adjusted risk of CAD increased with lower hemoglobin levels: an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.47 and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.18 to 1.84 for hemoglobin levels of 9.0 to 11.0 g/dL; an HR of 1.34 and 95% CI of 1.20 to 1.49 for 11.0 to 13.0 g/dL; and an HR of 1.07 and 95% CI of 1.01 to 1.13 for 13.0 to 15.0 g/dL. Hemoglobin levels > or = 17.0 g/dL were also associated with increased risk for CAD (adjusted HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.08-1.37).", 
    "192": "Hemoglobin levels > or = 17 or < 15 g/dL are independently associated with increase risk for new cardiac events."
